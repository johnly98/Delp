It was a fun place to be and it's spacious that makes a great place for a hang out that's not too stuffy. There's a bar on the left side or you can sit in the tables and have a waiter serve you. There are also arcade games , pool tables, and a bunch of other games for everyone to have fun and play with . TV screens everywhere as well. \\n\\nOverall, our group had a blast ! $27 for a pitcher of beer we ended up buying 3 . Definitely a place that I would come again.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The Golden Gate Tap Room is located near the south east corner of Sutter and Powell just a block north of Union Square park.  \\n\\nThe actual place is a few floors up and at the ground level there's security checking for IDs and giving stamps to ensure age of majority was indeed checked before entry.  This place is definitely a sports bar as the identity leaves no ambiguity whatsoever.  Big screens showing games, video games, music, wings, beer and such give the place a life of a clubhouse type of hangout.\\n\\nWhile I didn't feel like having any food I very well could have gone with something since they have options for small and larger sharing type plates.  You can get a small plate of wings or you can get a wing platter with different flavors.  Typical bar type food like burgers, sandwiches, etc are all on the menu here as well as an extensive drink menu with a full bar as well.\\n\\nI wasn't hungry for bar food at the time so I did stay and sit at the bar for just a couple beers because after a long day of going all over the city a nice sit down drink or two was all I was looking for here.\\n\\nI didn't see too many places like this around the area so this being one of the few or only one I noticed was filling a niche in the neighborhood I'm guessing.  Being that there are so many hotels in the area there's a lot of out of towners like myself just looking for this type of place in the area so it works out.\",\n",

Inside is a sports fans' dream with TVs and large screen projections all over the place. They have a mix of high tops, tables, and couches perched in front of the TVs. They also have a number of activities including skeeball, hot shot basketball, and a how hard can you punch game (there were probably others that I missed). \\n\\nThe food was decent, albeit the portions were a bit small for what you paid and the beer was a bit pricey. The staff also seemed a bit preoccupied despite it being relatively slow.  Come here for the atmosphere and the great view for any game or sporting event, the food and drinks should be secondary to any of that anyways, right?\",\n",

I noticed a large beer menu hand written on wood along side of the beer menu is the cider menu. The well drinks aren't on the menu so be prepared to know what to ask for. I didn't and the bartender couldn't believe I was of age. LOL. She asked to see my stamp for verification. Sure. I know I'm old, I just had a few shots before getting here and am confused on what I want to continue drinking without hurling on your nicely cleaned floors. \\n\\nMargaritas it is. I didn't look nor taste like a real margarita but it made due for my state of mind at the time.\\n\\nOoooh look games! Ski ball and other arcade style games and games I've never seen or played before. COOL! \\n\\nFood? Yup, they got that too. I ordered the filet mignon skewers, smaller in size than expected, but very very tasty and well worth every bite. We also ordered some tots fully loaded with the bacon on the side (I haven't eaten pork in almost 10 years but the bacon looked fresh and thick, others enjoyed it). \\n\\nOverall I can't wait to come back! This place deserves 10 stars if I could.\",\n",

I just happened to be both so this is my go to if I want to watch a game, play some arcades, and have a drink or two with friends.  It's a little walk from my work, but it's a great location.  I have recently came here to watch the Warriors games and it was very nice.  My friend and I came here just before the huge crowd and got us a seat right on the bar.  We had the TV right in front of you and people are cheering and celebrating with the victory.  \\n\\nThis place has 3 floors. 2nd floor is where all the arcades is at.  There's TV and tables but it seem a little crowded to be sitting for dinner.  3rd floor: where more tables and seats and perfect to watch the game.  there are 2 pool tables and little bit on the arcade section in the corner.  so if you ever just wanna come here to watch the game or chill with friends.  3rd floor is where you wanna go.  \\n\\nTheir foods are decent.  I usually come here just for bar food, typical wings, fries, fried calamari, and popcorn shrimp.  they all seem super good with the beer.  Service seem to be great and on point.  \\n\\nThey get super busy during games and weekend. so plan accordingly.\",\n",

First of all there is a slow elevator or a trek up some rather steep stairs.  Once I got upstairs it was pretty empty and I was greeted by no one but the smell of sour bar rags and locker room/ feet smell.  Yuck!!  It was a little bit after lunch.  The place was pretty much empty.  So after I took a look around and shook my head, I left.  Listen up if you are gonna profess to be a bar and grill on Union Square clean that place up.  You are missing an opportunity to have classy people patronize your establishment.  The smell alone made me fearful of salmonella or food poisoning.',\n",

The clincher was the Skeeball; I freaking LOVE skeeball. \\n\\nMy sister and I came during the Duke/Kansas game and the place was packed, but the bar service was  fast and friendly. The entire bar had ample open seating, though there were more than a few empty tables that desperately needed to be bussed and wiped down. My Dogfish beer was hoppy and cold just like I like it, and the basket of garlic fries with spicy aioli was AMAZING. Umm... did I mention they have skeeball? And if that's not your jam, there's also a pool table, shuffleboard, foosball, Pac-Man, Buckhunter, basketball, Goldentee, some Marvel Street Fighter-esq game, and probably a few others that I'm forgetting. Either way, if you're not entertained here, you need to take a long hard look at where you went wrong in life.\",\n",
