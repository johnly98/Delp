Also, sundal? I have some trouble eating something that I receive as a blessing at the temple with wine, forgive my upbringing. I don't disagree with the concept offhand - Indian food and wine can and should be paired, but it has to be the right food with the right wine. Indian home-style tiffin food or simple chaats are hard to find in SF and I appreciate the effort to bring them some notoriety, but I left unconvinced that these dishes are those that go best with wine.  \n\nJust a note re: our experience: It's off-putting when a non-Indian waiter tries to explain Indian food to Indian customers without being asked. Often times we come to the restaurant because we know the food, and its presence in a restaurant intrigues us. So we know what it is we are asking to eat, so having someone who can't quite even pronounce a dish name properly tell us what we'd want to eat, and how to eat it, is disconcerting to say the least.\n\nAll of this said, the food was pretty tasty, and others in my group would come again.

Not your typical Indian curries either- it's \"street food\" paired with wine hence the paradox in the name.\n\nCame here for dinner with a friend on a Friday night around 7:40 pm! It looked small when we first arrived at the door but it doesn't feel crammed- more like an intimate ambience good for dates or a cozy one for when the weather is cold out.  \n\nMy friend and I ordered the following: \n-Adai ($14) : described as \"protein savory pancake\" on their menu, made from 4 different lentils, rice,cumin, curry leaves, chilies. Came out nice and warm after about 15 minutes of waiting. The pancake itself isn't actually overly flavorful- it's simple. The coconut chutney that comes with it is what provides that nice contrast, bringing out the cumin/curry flavors of the pancake itself. For all non-coconut fans out there, it's worth noting that the chutney isn't too coconut-y or over the top, or at least balanced with the pancake it's worth trying. Overall, 4/5- it was good but I wasn't dying to eat like 10 more after. \n\n-Sundal ($7) a warm garbanzo bean salad with curry leaves/ coconut/ mustard seeds/ mango. Sounds like an interesting mashup of ingredients but it's very good! Really liked the sweetness of the mango, contrasted with the crunchy  mustard seeds. Big fan and highly recommend getting (especially if you like chickpeas!) 4.5/5\n\nService - We had to wait awhile (40min) for the Sundal because there was some sort of mix up in the kitchen, but the owner was really nice (she's the only one waiting tables) and took it off of our bill. :) its not heavily staffed in the kitchen, and the owner is the only working the front, so might not be great if you're in a hurry but service is good and the owner is friendly and nice.\n\nRecommend if you're trying to try something new for a date or catch-up with a friend!", "author": "Kristie M."}

Yah, but that $150 went to Charmin. =/  \n\nI read about the opening of Indian Paradox on Tablehopper. The owner came to the U.S. to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering but soon developed a passion for wine (she's now a certified sommelier). She also loves Indian street food so Indian Paradox was born. It started as a pop-up and is now a wine bar serving Indian street snacks at the former King Food Subs (RIP Kalbi sammies). I saw a glimpse of the soft opening menu which looked foreign to me. SOLD! None of that yipsterfied ethnic food.\n\nMy friend and I visited Indian Paradox on Saturday night. It was inconspicuous as there's no signage so I had to take a double take before realizing we were at the right spot. It's a very small space with just 4 tables and bar seating so it's best suited for solo dining or for a casual date. \n\nThe vegetarian and vegan friendly menu is small with only 10 items split up into 4 categories: wine nibble (peanuts), street snacks (sundal, churmur, methi muthia, bhel puri), plates (khanda batata poha, dahi sev puri), and more substantial platters (daebli, shish kebab, kheema pav). With exception of two things, I've never seen any of these items anywhere else in San Francisco. Nothing is over $20. Each item had a suggested wine pairing ($10-$15/glass) which we skipped since we both had been drinking earlier and had to drive. \n\nSince it was our second dinner of the night, we shared 3 street snacks/small plates:\n*Bhel Puri: Crispy crackers, puffed rice, jaggery, mint chutneys, tomatoes, potatoes, mango ($12): http://bit.ly/1R5ZKrb\nA must order, the bhel puri was chockfull of bright and fresh flavors (spicy, sweet, tangy) with a satisfying variety of textures. It was purely addicting!\n\n*Dahi Sev Puri: Semolina puffs, jaggery, mint chutney, yogurt, sev, cilantro ($13): http://bit.ly/21x20wx\nIt was love at first bite when I first had these from the DUM truck (only other place that offers it in the SF Peninsula area: http://bit.ly/1pqpE1K). Lots of textures and flavor profiles that explode in your mouth. It's hard to explain so you have to try it for yourself. However, I thought it was quite pricey compared to the DUM food truck. I know it's not fair to compare the prices to a food truck but DUM charges $3 for 3 pieces while it's $13 for 4 pieces at Indian Paradox. \n\n*Kanda Patata Poha: Flattened rice, onion, potato, turmeric, roasted peanuts ($11): http://bit.ly/1Uj1KCa\nThis was our least favorite dish. Not because it was bad but because the flavor was mute compared to the first two dishes and the overall texture was too mushy for our liking. \n\nThe owner was a total sweetheart and you can tell she's really passionate about her love of wine (I overheard a convo she had with the table next to us). She was spread thin though since it was only her and the chef in the back. My only suggestion is to get larger water glasses. The water glasses were teeny weeny and held maybe 3.5-4 ounces of water (size of two shot glasses). I felt bad having to flag someone down to refill my glass since they were busy.\n\nIndian Paradox is definitely recommended for a unique pre-dinner snack or nightcap. Get the Bhel Puri!

Add to that an intimate setting, with service that is personable, friendly and attentive, and prices that are reasonable, and all that elevates Indian Paradox from just another food and wine bar, to one that is refreshing and bold in its approach, yet familial and simple in its execution, rooted in the simple promise of providing people with a food and wine bar to get together and connect while savoring flavorful snacks and nurturing delicious wine. \n\nAnd for those of us from the \"motherland\"...Indian Paradox provides a slice of your mother's kitchen right in the middle of San Francisco. It does not get any better!\n\nMy husband and I were out on a rather wet and windy date night last night (we just adopted a puppy, so lets just say we desperately needed a date night away from parenting duties) and decided to drop in on a whim (my husband's whim and not mine and I'm the Indian and he's the American...how'se that for a \"paradox\"?) and two hours later we left overjoyed and satisfied to have experienced such great food and wine along with the most enriching conversations with the owner Kavitha. We tucked into the masala peanuts, the churmur, the bhel puri, the kanda batata poha, the shish kebab and the mishti doi and nurtured a wonderful bottle of the 2013 F. Thienpont Sauvignon Blanc Bordeaux. \n\nWhat completely caught me off guard was that even though everything was executed in a very simple yet tasteful manner, there was so much more of a story being told on the back end, from the myriad flavors in each dish to the perfectly paired wines to the manner in which every was served. It all immediately took me back home...home to India...to my mother's kitchen...to skipping school with my class mates and sitting on a sidewalk on a busy street eating snacks from the guy making the food on a rickshaw with a portable gas burner...remember that final scene from the movie Ratatouille when Anton Ego tastes the Ratatouille and is immediately transported back to his childhood to his mother's kitchen and he sheds a tear...that was me...last night...when I had my first bite...exquisite.\n\nUnlike your usual low end (Naan n Curry) or high end (August 1five) Indian restaurant, Indian Paradox's focus is on small plates with a custom menu that is tailored specifically to Indian street food snacks that most people are not accustomed to knowing about (unless you are Indian, of course). If you are expecting naan or chicken tikka masala or matar paneer or biryani, that is not Indian Paradox. If you are curious about taking your curiosity for Indian food to the next level, if you are adventurous, if you are expecting simple, yet tasty and flavorful, small plate Indian street food snacks, paired with unusual wines, served in a setting that could very well make you feel like you are at a friend's kitchen, munching on snacks and drinking wine as you process your day, or catch up on your lives or just reconnect...THAT is Indian Paradox.\n\nThe opening of August 1 five and Babuji (both of which I also love) close to the same time Indian Paradox opened and the resulting hype surrounding the former two restaurants have overshadowed Indian Paradox, but perhaps in a way, that has also enabled it to stay \"local\", keep its neighborhood vibe alive and keep it personable and intimate, and also help it to understand its customer, its food and to continue experimenting to keep itself current and most important of all...stay true to its passion to cook and serve Indian street food the way it is cooked and served in India, where its just as much about the food and the wine as it is about people simply coming together to create memories.\n\nKavitha has a successful product in her hands and I cannot wait to see where else Indian Paradox will take San Francisco on its culinary journey of Indian street food and wine! Maybe one day brunch will be on the menu! My husband and I are a fan and we cannot wait to go back very soon with our families, friends and co workers...but let's keep Indian Paradox our little secret, ok?", "author": "Amit S."}

Drab ambience, LED 'candles' everywhere, and a random bucket on top of the kitchen entrance. It's obvious that this is a low-budget high charge operation that lacks any thought towards interior design. Service is extremely slow... food took forever to arrive. Antithetical to street food, which is fast! But all that aside, the food really just was the singular sore point.\n\nNothing tastes like Indian street food or even Indian food. We ordered three things to see if we like anything enough to order more. We got: peanuts, churmur, and dabeli. Nice peanuts, flavourless blob of a mess churmur, and equally flavourless dabeli for $15. Literally boiled and mashed potatoes with almost no seasoning and missing every single garnish! So that's $7.50 per slider-sized sandwich... shockingly priced, especially for the quality. Not only did we not order anything else, we didn't want to take leftovers home either.\n\nWe tried this place because the idea of Indian street food paired with wine sounds exciting.

The potatoes in the puri super bland and so was the chutney. The Kheema was OK but the bread pairing did not go well because it was too flaky to eat with the kheema. \n\nI'd say if you want flavorful street food at a reasonable price then stick to Vik's in Berkeley.

This makes no sense whatsoever, and I can't rationalize no matter how hard I try (did I mention that I really liked the Poha?). Oh, the agony!\n\nAccording to the informational blurb on the website, the paradox is that \"Indian cuisine (especially Indian street food) unlike, say the French cuisine is not what you associate with fine dining, and the whole charade that comes with it.

I'd definitely recommend coming here just for a snack and some wine and good conversation.", "author": "Christina C."}

We meet Kavitha ( owner ) sweet and sassy, but in amazing away ! She warmed us up with her personality and great smile and started to suggest few items for us. She has an amazing wine selection but couple of us wanted a beer.  She pulled out from the fridge an amazing big bottle of German beer that was fantastic . Then we had couple of small dishes she suggested, for starters...MASALA PEANUTS, toasted peanuts tossed with ghee, lemon juice and Garam masala served warm..perfect with the beer! \n\n***** five stars \nBHEL PURI\nCrispy crackers and puffed rice mixed with jaggery and mint chutneys, tomatoes, potatoes, and mango served in a cone . \n\nThis was so freaking awesome we had to order a second helping and then suggested the next few guests sitting by us they should order the same. I told them if they didn't think this was amazing I would buy it !\n\nA definite fave in our books and highly recommend it!!", "author": "Michael F."}

The wait time for this place was very long for the food (we ordered three dishes) to come out. The food was alright, I feel like the flavors and textures didn't really come together for me. We waited over 40 mins for Bhel sev puri, (which was a cold dish), adai, and kanda batata poha. I totally understand everything is made to order and fresh, but I wasn't expecting a 40min wait after we sat down and ordered. I also got kind of erked the waiter kept spilling water on my pants everytime he refilled our water glasses because there was a leak in the pitcher.  That's not really his fault. I also heard it was also his first day. So that's understandable. Also, the place is small and it's hard to move...like at all.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-12", "description": "This is a good restaurant if you are looking for good wine paired with some very flavorful, light and unique cuisine.  Think of it as Indian tapas. However, I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are really hungry, or on a budget.  \n\nI started with the $4 bowl of nuts which were deliciously seasoned with turmeric, amongst other spices.  Next were the pastry puffs filled with yogurt, cilantro and green sauce which we were told to eat 'all at once' with our hands.  They provided a burst of fresh flavors that exploded in my mouth. I was left wanting more.  \n\nNext, I ordered the veggie burger.  This was unlike any I have ever had.  It was spicy, yet also tangy from fresh pomegranates, and had an interesting texture from nuts and beans mixed together.  The veggie burger itself was one of the best I have ever had, but I was disappointed it was served between a couple of cheap, dry dinner rolls. I also felt felt the price ($18) it should have come with some sort of side (a salad of some sort, pickles, maybe some curried potatoes or veggies?). For 2 people sharing a few plates of food and a couple glasses of wine expect your bill to be at least $100.\n\nOverall, the chef here is very talented and unique but I think to gain repeat business they will need to either lower their prices or add more value to the entrees and improve on the bread and some of the ingredients.  I went during peak dinner time and the restaurant was empty the whole time. As it stands now, this is a place worth trying once as a very unique abstraction to the same old cuisine, but probably not one you'd frequent often, unless of course you have a lot of money to burn.", "author": "Daniel K."}

We ordered 3 small dishes to share and it took over 30 minutes for the first dish to come out, 20 more minutes for the 2nd dish and another 20 minutes for the third dish. Keep in mind these are basically appetizer size dishes and it took over an hour for all our dishes to come. I can't imagine how it would be had the restaurant had actually been busy. \n\nOn top of that, for 4 glasses of their basic wine and ros\u00e9, with 3 side dishes essentially (2 were vegetarian) it was over $100 with tax and tip.

You'll be challenged to try dishes you probably haven't heard of, and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the delightful mix of salty, sweet, spicy, sour, and crunchy elements.

She was one of the engineers at my company and left a few months ago to pursue her dream.  I knew that Kavitha was knowledgeable about food and wine.  She'd had a few pop-ups in the city, but I was never able to make it to one of them.  \nI finally stopped by Indian Paradox yesterday and was really impressed.  She doesn't have a sign up yet, but it's not hard to find with your trusty map app.  It's right next door to Bus Stop Pizza.  And no problems finding a parking spot.\nFirst off, I loved the interior.  Colors are great and the space is warm and inviting.  The Indian movie posters and votives are a nice addition.  Fun Indian background music.  And I don't say this often, but her bathroom smells great ;).\nKavitha is very warm and welcoming and the food is amazing.  The flavors and textures are fresh, colorful and unique.  I've never had anything quite like it.  She has a very interesting wine collection and I loved the whites including a wonderful Vinho Verde - brighter and less mineral than the ones I've had in the past.  \nI loved everything we had.  I was saddened that we had dinner reservations as I would really like to try the lamb - next time! \nStop by for a memorable experience.  Once you try it, you'll be back.", "author": "Stephanie E."}
