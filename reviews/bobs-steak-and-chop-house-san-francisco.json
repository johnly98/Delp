I'd eaten there once before a couple years back and had the \"executive lunch\" which was a cool concept for those who wanted a quick red meat fix but, this time around seafood was the star of the show. \n\nI started with the hamachi sashimi which was garnished with edible flowers, and hackle back caviar. Lightly seared, slightly smoky and delicious. Next up was the hamachi collar which was cooked to perfection. Holy crap, it might have been the best collar I've eaten. Flavorful, well seasoned and rich. Lastly was the swordfish sandwich and side salad. For $20 bucks it's a great deal as the fish is lovely and plays well with the slaw and brioche bun. Yum. \n\nCheck this place out and go alternative with seafood over the meats, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

Made a reservation through OpenTable the day before for a party of 6 on Saturday, September 8th at 5:30pm. We were a party of 5 adults and 1 toddler.\n\n*ONION RINGS ($13)\n*JUMBO SHRIMP COCKTAIL OR REMOULADE ($18)\n*MARYLAND-STYLE CRAB CAKE: With Honey Mustard Sauce ($19)\n*FRIED CALAMARI: with Cocktail Sauce ($16)\n*CAESAR SALAD: with Croutons ($14)\n*Kid's Mac n' Cheese ($9)\n\nEveryone just named an appetizer that they wanted and we ended up with the plates above. I'm a veggie girl, so I enjoyed the caesar. The onion rings are massive! You get a huge stack of them. The crab cake was kinda small for five to share, but since we had so many apps, cutting it up into a few servings was fine. The shrimp cocktail and calamari were pretty standard and tasty. They have a kid's menu, so the first thing we ordered was the mac n cheese. A pretty big serving for a kid sized meal. They give you complimentary bread and butter and jar of pickled cucumbers and red bell peppers, so make sure to sample that. I liked the pickles, but I found the peppers a little slimy.\n\nSTEAKS & CHOPS: All entrees are served with a glazed carrot and choice of baked potato, smashed potatoes or skillet fried potatoes which are topped with saut\u00e9ed onions and peppercorn gravy\n*PRIME RIBEYE: 14oz. ($49) x2\n*PRIME \"C\u00d4TE DE BOEUF\" BONE-IN RIBEYE: 22oz. ($62)\n*PRIME FILET MIGNON: 9oz. ($49)\n*PRIME T-BONE: 16oz. ($52)\n\n*SAUT\u00c9ED MUSHROOMS ($11)\n*FRESH ASPARAGUS ($11)\n*ROASTED BRUSSELS SPROUTS ($10)\n\nThe bone in ribeye looked delicious! Definitely the most impressive looking steak. I got the 14oz ribeye which I found a little fatty at spots. The skillet potatoes were tasty and my fav out of the potato sides. I tried the mashed potatoes too and they had a good amount of garlic flavor. I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots, so I left that alone. The sides were nice and simple. Asparagus and mushrooms are two of my favorite veggies, so I enjoyed those. I didn't try the brussels, but they looked good as well.\n\n*BROWNIE SUNDAE: A Peanut Butter and Chocolate Brownie with Triple Chocolate and Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream Topped with Pecan Chocolate Butter Nut Sauce, Whipped Cream and a Cherry\n*Chandon Brut Classic ($15 glass)\n*Cliff Lede Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon 2014 ($145 bottle)\n\nSince it was my bday, the restaurant gave us a complimentary dessert. If you are a chocolate lover, this is a good dessert to share as it's huge. The bottle of red wine we ordered waa nice and full bodied. Definitely went well with red meat. I started with a glass of bubbly as I was the first one here. Nice to sip on while waiting.\n\nService was weird. Our server asked us if we were ready to order and I said we'll order some apps. I started naming apps and he just walked away to help another table. So strange! We wanted to try the pickle jar with our apps, but he took that away without asking. I had to inquire later with our steaks to get the jar back.\n\nI was ready to give this spot four stars, but due to the odd service, I'm bumping it down to three. Otherwise, a nice old school spot to grab a steak. And kid friendly.", "author": "Elena N."}

I requested a little more horseradish for the shrimp cocktail, our server said sure. Then she brought a mountain of it, quite insane! We requested two different salad dressings and she informed us that there would be an additional charge for that. Well we wanted the two so what the hay! Honestly, I do not think they even charge you extra for additional salad dressings at a fast food establishment, nor have I ever been charged extra at any restaurant (fancy or casual) that I can recall.\n\nThe bill arrived and they charged two bucks for the extra salad dressing and an additional two bucks for the horseradish, which the server did not inform us of.

Thankfully we were able to get in without a reservation! \n\nBetween the two of us, we decided to split an order of duck breast and an order of the rib-eye (smallest cut). The duck breast was amazing!!! Super tender. Cooked to a perfect medium-rare. And lots of flavor. I wish the pieces would have been sliced a little thinner, though. But so so good. We could have done without the rib eye and just gotten two orders of the duck. The rib-eye was ok. Wasn't as tender as I was expecting. Flavor was good, and it was quite the hefty slab of meat (even the smallest cut..which is what we ordered). We didn't end up finishing it. The mashed potatoes here are bomb. Very creamy and rich, so I was happy the dishes also came with some other veggies to help cut the grease/richness. \n\nOh, and customer service here is awesome!

I have worked across the street from Bob's Steak & Chop House for 13 years.  I've stayed at the Omni Hotel during trials too.  I have eaten at the restaurant and in the bar so many times, I've lost count.  One of the reasons I eat at Bob's and stay at the Omni Hotel is because when I'm tired, hungry and missing my family due to my work schedule or need good food, Bob's and the Omni Hotel treat me like family.  I know people that work there by name and they make me feel at home.  When tourists or visiting attorneys/staff ask me where they can get a great steak, I send them to Bob's.  Things happen.  It is time for people to stop being in their feelings and be a little more forgiving.  You be the judge of the food and the service.  I am and will forever be a Bob's customer!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-06-19", "description": "This review is more about the bar section of Bob's Steak & Chop House at the Omni hotel than it is about the restaurant section.  I have eaten at both, but more at the bar than I do the restaurant as there are so many other places to eat in San Francisco and it would be a waste of a trip to SF to only eat there.  I have been coming to SF for business for many years, too many for me to even mention.  But that isn't the point of this review.  It about Bob's Steak & Chop House Bar section and restaurant section.  I will first go into the restaurant section.  I have eaten breakfast there and I have finally had dinner there on my last trip.  The breakfast is what it says it is.  A good breakfast cooked to order.  The dinner there was very good.  The steak was cooked correctly to temp and the sides were tasty.  Selection of alcohol is pretty substantial and the wait staff was on point the night I was there.  I would give the dinner/breakfast side 4.5 stars.\n\nNow the reason why I am writing this review.  It for the bar section.  As you may have read from my other reviews, I love burgers.  Not just burgers, but GREAT burgers.  Burgers that are \"JAB\" (just another burger) gets called out here regularly.  Well, the burger at Bob's Steak & Chop House isn't JAB!  By far, one of the best burgers I have ever had in my entire life if not the best.  It boils down to one reason.  Quality of the hamburger used.  They use the cuttings from their steaks to fresh grind their hamburger meat every day.  So you are getting meat from the prime rib cuttings and other fine cuts of meat.  And you can taste it.  The meat is well seasoned and cooked to perfection.  I order my burger medium with minimal accompanying additions to taste the meet and it was cooked medium.   When I suggested the burger this past trip to a gentleman at the bar, he ordered his medium rare and he raved about the burger, his eyes rolled back like he had just had a taste of manna.  Last year on a trip to SF, I was sitting at the bar having one of their delicious burgers and a co-worker stopped by.  I raved about the burger and picked up his tab and he ordered himself one.  The burger was so nice he had a 2nd one the next day instead of leaving to go to a restaurant.  They have really large onion rings which are tasty an seasoned with salt and pepper.  They are fresh large vidalia onions.  Their regular French fries are also tasty.  I believe that I have had at least three burgers on my multiple stays at the Omni and each one has been fantastic.  They have pop corn shrimp for a play on fish and chips with they call it shrimp and chips which I also order with their regular fries, they have wedges, but those are not my cup of tea.  For that burger alone, I would give them 5 stars, but the bar staff is extremely friendly and attentive.   Small seating area at the bar, but again, the burger is fantastic.\n\nAll in all, if you are looking for a fantastic burger, I highly recommend Bob's Steak & Chop House and sitting in the bar area and ordering up one of these Prime burgers.", "author": "L H."}

Starting with the good part: the steaks were fine and cooked as ordered.  Sadly everything else was just meh.... nothing special.  Maybe because the restaurant is in the Omni hotel downtown and they have a captive audience, they feel they don't have to try that hard.  Whatever the case, it was a disappointing experience.  Service was slow and inattentive.  The atmosphere feels tired and old.  And the rest of the food was a bit bland and uninventive.  For the price, you can definitely do better.

We had sub-par experience because my fish dish was not good and the service wasn't amazing either. As a yelp elite, I wrote a review and the General Manager Melanie reached out to me to apologize for my experience and offer us to come back to Bob's for another try. That was the best customer service I've ever received! Of course I took her up on it, but asked to go to the San Francisco location instead as I live here. She was able to accommodate and let the folks at Bob's in SF know about our experience down at La Costa, which provided for a great experience.\n\nWe arrived at 8pm on a Friday and the hostess apologized for our experience at La Costa, and offered us free champagne! Our waitress, Shelley, was super friendly and accommodating. Offered us great recommendations on wine and food, but also gave us space when we weren't ready to decide. We ended up getting a bottle of Meiomi Pinot Noir from California, which was really smooth. Shelly let us try that wine and another Pinot before deciding which one we wanted to chose.\n\nFor food, we started with the mix green salad which they split for us into two plates. My boyfriend LOVED it because it's all of his favorite things. I liked it a lot as well. For my main dish, I got the 9 oz filet steak with a side of smashed potatoes. 9 oz is definitely enough for me, it was huge! There was a little mishap where my steak was switched on the plate with my boyfriend's (I got medium rare and he got medium), but we figured it out and were able to switch. The smashed potatoes were delicious. Super creamy and buttery (clearly unhealthy but very tasty). The glazed carrot was not my thing (I don't like carrots), but my boyfriend LOVED it. We also got a side of brussels sprouts with bacon, which were actually kind of dry so I wouldn't order them again.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Bob's and was so thankful that Melanie invited us back to try it again. Definitely the best customer service I have experienced.", "author": "Jenna G."}

The corned beef itself was okay and I did appreciate they were using relatively larger chunks of meat and it wasn't some sort of ground meat, but it wasn't very impressive.

Being in the Omni Hotel, the restaurant is visible from the street on the ground floor and its entrance is from inside of the hotel.  Arriving early, I was seated at a mid-room table for four though we were only a party of two.  I studied the menu and waited to hear my lunch companion's comments or advice before deciding on my meal.  The menu is relatively large for a steakhouse as they have seafood and other options. After our waiter explained the business lunch special, it was an easy decision.  Since the soup of the day was cream of mushroom (love them shroooms), my meal consisted of a wedge salad, mushroom soup, Filet Mignon medium rare, and cr\u00e8me brulee (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=j55ekn9P2ICcfoXtLayMtw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) (counterclockwise from bottom left).  Everything was executed well and I surprisingly enjoyed the wedge salad (not a blue cheese fan).  Asked the waiter whether the soup was available for takeout but sadly he said no; the garlic crouton added some bite to the soup.  The portions were perfect as I was full and satisfied yet not overly so.\nMy friend had a regular meal portion of the filet mignon which came with only one side.\nFor the price (under $40.00), this meal is reasonable, given the number of courses (four) and the food quality.  There are quite a few steak houses in the area, three within a six block radius now so competition is stiff.\nYes, I will be back and maybe splurge on a dinner here.  Lunch definitely works for me!", "author": "Mike C."}

If this restaurant suffers from inconsistency, I couldn't tell you, because the food and service were spot-freaking-on the evening we visited. \n\nThe restaurant is, as others have already pointed out, resident of the Omni Hotel on California @ Montgomery. Price-wise, it's a rung beneath Morton's; entrees alone will set you back about $40-65, and DO inquire what \"market price\" is as suggested on the menu, because it's more than you'd hope. The digital wine menu is convenient, but I kinda miss the sommelier schooling me rather than swiping left to read the Vinu tasting notes. I digress. \n\nI noted booth seating in my reservation request, which is always a gamble. Padded bench seating with a row of traincar tables isn't a booth, but many higher-end restaurants would like you to believe communal dining is progressive and interesting and that we need to reinstate the social interaction element of dining out. No. Bars exist for that purpose, no? Lucky for me, my request was granted and we were seated off in a private booth with no neighbors thus no hypervigilant honing-in on others' trite conversations (on my part obviously).\n\nOur server was quick, sliding into our little enclave at all of the right moments. We never felt forgotten, and more importantly we never felt rushed; a terrific palette-cleanser following the previous evening's dining debacle. She accommodated my husband's request to reheat his filet after it had cooled - you can't, shouldn't, inhale a filet. The Maryland crab cakes were stand-alone amazing: crispy, not minced too finely (a few rogue crab chunks separated from the patty, I'll take it!) and never mushy. They didn't need any condiments, let alone the honey mustard glaze they were drizzled with. NOTHING was deluged in seasoned drawn butter. NOTHING was greasy, over-cooked, over-salted. Not a mark was missed. It was just a perfect meal that we dreaded finishing so we cushioned the blow with port because they were out of limoncello.", "author": "Julianna O."}

We each chose their bone-in ribeye, which was served by George-an excellent server and good humored gentleman. Steaks were delicious and flavorful, baked potato was perfectly cooked. I was not a fan of the glazed carrot served with the steak. It had a cloying sweetness from cinnamon and sugar glaze which reminded me of carrots prepared for a child's palate. They added nothing to the steak and confused the delicate flavors of the older french bordeaux I brought to enjoy. Mushrooms were pedestrian. Nothing much was added to enhance their flavor-a simple butter and garlic saut\u00e9-with too much water leeched into the sauce from the saute.\nStill, I gave it a 5.

Two of the days were fantastic and one of the days was not very good.\n\nHere's my experience . . . On the first day, I had a waitress named Natalie. Not only was she friendly, but super professional and on top of things.  The eggs Benedict was outstanding. In addition to the eggs benedict, there were some very good fried potatoes, a shot glass of strawberry smoothie, and a little chocolate cake.  The coffee was rich and smooth.  Excellent breakfast and worth the $32.   \n\nOn the second day, I had another waiter (and maybe another chef?) and the food was not as good. The eggs benedict lacked sufficient hollandaise sauce (very dry) and this time, no sweet bite of cake or the little smoothie.  I had to ask for a little more hollandaise and they charged me an extra $2 for it. This made me a little angry as I was spending $30 for breakfast yet didn't get the same great meal as previously - and I had to pay extra? The $6 Coffee service was also not as prompt. I certainly didn't feel like it was a special breakfast. Oh, and I forgot to mention that as a single female dinner who had tipped very well the previous morning, I was stuck in the corner near the kitchen. (Although the restaurant was empty) However, later on, a single male came in and was seated at one of the window tables. Hmmm . . . All in all, a very disappointing experience.\n\nOn the third day, I requested to be seated in Natalie's section, and Lo and behold, the breakfast was outstanding (was given all the little extras) and the eggs benedict had plenty of hollandaise sauce. Coffee was kept flowing and it was a great experience. Based on days one and three, I would have given this five stars.\n\nBottom line, the food was excellent, but the service was spotty. If you can, request Natalie. She's the best waitress at this restaurant and will make sure your meal and experience are great.\n\nAs for lunch and dinner, I have no idea if they're any good, but based on their breakfast, I would guess those meals to be excellent as well.", "author": "Anne J."}

Once shortly after they opened (I remember so well the whole building being gutted while they built out the Omni), a few weeks ago, and tonight for my birthday.\nThe first visit was just ok. It was about 5 or 6 years ago, so I remember it being ok, but nothing special. So, I didn't return.\nI met the wife and some friends at the Omni recently for an event and we decided to dine at Bob's and I was very pleasantly surprised. The long and the short of it is my filet was awesome.\nTonight, after some deliberations about where to go for my birthday, I actually selected Bob's. That should't sound so incredulous to most folks, however I can afford to go anywhere I want (yes I realize I am lucky and I appreciate that more than most who seem to take it for granted). I was so impressed with my filet though that I opted to go back to Bob's. \nI made the right choice. Our server is a really friendly guy from Sacramento and he was a lot of fun. I brought in a superb bottle of wine that we chatted about endlessly and it did not disappoint. The meal though was definitely excellent. \nMy wife, believe it or not, is a vegetarian, so they got her salads wrong not once but twice, but they were apologetic and corrected it quickly. I understand though, because this is not the kind of place vegetarians hang out in. So, easily forgiven as far as I'm concerned. \nI ordered the filet mignon again (this time the huge 16 oz. size) and I was most definitely NOT disappointed. That steak is absolutely divine. It is Prime, so it's among the best cuts you can get. The only difference between the great steakhouses is how they prepare the meat.\nBob's does it right. They do something to char the exterior of the meat while maintaining the juiciness and full flavor of the beef. This is steak candy. Seriously excellent beef, and I've dined at most of the famous steakhouses in the country so I think I can say this is awesome with some degree of confidence. \nFor a birthday treat they brought me a chocolate cake that was totally bomb. It was not light, it was a decadent chocolate cake loaded with chocolate chips, but it was totally perfect.\nSo, if you're not seeking what may be the most memorable steak dinner of your life, or necessarily the best steak house experience you've ever had, Bob's may fit the bill. It is excellent in most ways, but isn't a Hall of Famer. If you're looking for an excellent steak though in a town known more for ethnic varieties, you could do a lot worse than Bob's, Bon Appetit.", "author": "Matt H."}

Our waiter was very good and it helped that the restaurant was more or less half empty. Friday night busy weekend. Maybe that was the first clue!!  First the bread is no where near up to par with almost any San Francisco restaurant. Taste like they bought it from Safeway. Dry bland and needs much improvement. Then we split a wedge salad. Plenty big enough to split but they overloaded it with dressing and therefore was not wonderful. My husband said the rack of lamb was good and my rib eye was ok so hence three stars. The sides of mushrooms had no flavor at all but thanks that our waiter said to order half. Broccoli was very bland. Your dinner arrives with a huge steamed carrot that is seasoned but the seasoning includes cinnamon which I wasn't crazy about.  The fried potato mix was awful. Not sure if that's there special recipe but it has a gravy on it and just had no flavor at all. I think it's time for an overhaul of this restaurants menu.

But, in our defense, we had a guest who was on East Coast time, so for him it was 8:15 p.m.  No one was at the host podium.  After we hovered around the podium for a bit, a waiter (fortunately, not the one who waited on us) came up to the podium.  Before I could even tell him that we were early for a 5:30 p.m. reservation, he spit out, \"Not open until 5:30!\"  I explained, \"We're early for a 5:30 reservation.\"  He snarled \"We aren't open until 5:30!\"  In response, I said  \"Oh okay, I guess we'll wait at the bar across the way?\"  He then just walked away.  \n\nI found his demeanor and attitude rude and offensive.  He could have politely suggested that we wait in the lobby or grab a drink at the bar across the hallway until they opened at 5:30 p.m.\n\nFortunately, after grabbing a cocktail across the hallway (which was seamlessly transferred to our dinner bill), and checking in with who I assume is the regular hostess, we were promptly seated and waited on by a much more pleasant waiter and busboy.\n\nOur party of three shared an order of fried calamari and shrimp platter.  The fried calamari was battered and fried to perfection.  The shrimp was fresh and flavorful.  Both appetizers were served with a delightful cocktail sauce and half a juicy lemon.  I liked the cocktail sauce very much because it was not overly horseradishy, just the right amount to give it a subtle kick.\n\nI don't know where it went wrong.  Maybe instead of the plain old ribeye steak, I should have ordered the bone in ribeye, but frankly, that's just too much meat for lil' old me.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but the Prime ribeye steak from Costco I cooked last week with some Montreal Steak Seasoning and Cajun spice last week tasted better that the ribeye steak from Bob's.  Bob's ribeye steak had good seasoning, but it was more of a medium than the medium rare I ordered.  I think that might've been what ruined it for me.

What a disappointment!\n\nWe came for mid morning brunch.  Our three-course brunch (when there are only a limited number of options) shouldn't took over 2 hours because dishes came out at a snail's pace.  \n\n We were quickly seated at a nice table.  The busboy promptly served us coffee and water (upon request).  Nice touch by the busboy to put my 3-year-old's water in a plastic cup with a cap and straw. \n\nWe ordered our brunch choices and the wait began.  Our waiter served our child's milk in a regular glass - no straw, no cover. Seriously?  We can't have brought the first kid into this restaurant.  We had to repeatedly flag waiters down for coffee refills. If you're going to charge $45 for a 3- course brunch, service should be better.  Waiters don't help each other out. \n\nThe first courses came 45 minutes after we ordered. Lobster bisque was cold and the fruit plate was sad looking.  Waiter was about to serve my husband's appetizer to me and instead of walking around, he reached over me to serve the fruit plate.  I realize he said excuse my reach, but still, I think at a white tablecloth restaurant, the waiter should be willing to walk around.  Moreover, the waiter never came by to tell us what was taking so long.  \n\nMain entrees were better, but came after another 30 min wait. Steak and pork chop entrees were perfectly cooked. Salmon salad was ok - wilted and overdressed greens; salmon did not have a nice sear on the outside.  Shrimp scampi was ok - shrimp looked good but pasta was oily and quite al dente.

(There is nothing 'local' about this place. It feels like any generic high end steakhouse at any upscale mall) However, I was brought to dinner here as a business meeting and who am I to turn down a free steak?\n\nI went with the $58 bone-in rib eye because the waiter said that was their specialty. A $60 steak SHOULD be amazing ... And it was. I have a big appetite and felt that after the fat was removed, the steak was on the small side. I did not feel full the way I do after eating at most steakhouses. For $60 this is a shame.\n\nThe steak itself was good. Well marbled, pretty tender and cooked perfectly to medium rare. The outside had a salty crust but the inside was soft and tender. Would I put it up there with the best steaks I've had? Yep. However, the smaller size for the price was a bit of a bummer.\n\nThe sides were lackluster. The mashed potatoes were typical. The giant phallic looking glazed carrot in the middle of the plate ... Random and strange. Didn't know quite what to make of that. Sourdough bread was kind of disappointing for a San Francisco staple.\n\nI had scotch on the rocks with my steak but the person who took me here had a Martini and it looked huge!\n\nThe service was good but they had 2 waiters for a whole dining room and they were obviously overworked so getting their attention for a drink refill wasn't easy. The decor is dimly lit and lots of classy wood paneling. Very typical of any Capital Grille type of place you'd go to. 'Men's Club ambiance.\n\nOverall, it was a damn good tasting steak. Wouldn't be my choice if I had to eat in SF because it is a bit generic. (Taditsch Grill or Scomas or Gary Danko would be my choice) However, for steak ... Its better than going to a Ruth Chris and good for business meetings.", "author": "E T."}

I was ok with that as long as the steak delivered  which it did.     The presentation could have been a little better.\n\nFood was 4.5 stars..  \n\nOn the other hand our service was excellent.   Right off the bat I told our waiter to bring everything out as fast as possible.  The salad came out within 4 minutes, the appetizer was out within 6 minutes,  and half way though our salads our steaks came out.   \n\nOur jaws dropped.. we were not expecting the steaks for 45 minutes, but we asked and they delivered exactly as requested.

That isn't to say that Martinis are the only reason to come to Bob's, but if you're going to have lunch here (preferably a business lunch where somebody else picks up the tab) you should definitely start it off with a Martini.\n\nI opted for a Hendrick's Gin Martini, up.   They gave me a couple of olives and the pour was very very generous.    It's pricey, at $18 a pop, but it'll definitely get your creative juices flowing for your afternoon meetings.   My coworker had eaten here a few times and suggested we go with the country fried steak, so we obliged.   The meat was tasty though I think next time I come here I'll just go for the meat, straight up, and forgo the deep fried preparation.

Had it been the best beef I have ever had, I would have to say that sadly it was not. Our party ordered a good cross section, from the New York steak to their Tomahawk cut ( which was a rib eye with the  long bone still on it, therefore looking like a Tomahawk)  marketing strategy giving them an extra 15 bucks in hype.\nBetween the add on's for side dishes, creamed corn and creamed spinach, the average tab per person was about $ 90 a person.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-18", "description": "I recently had a business lunch at Bob's Steak and Chop House in the Omni Hotel. I(t was as close as a mortal might come to the \"perfect lunch.\" \n\nBecause Bob's doesn't pander to what I call the \"popular pablum press,\" it doesn't get the kind of attention that several other steak houses receive, particularly the cluster of them along the 101/Van Ness corridor.  \n\nThat afternoon I found out why:  Bob's doesn't need to promote their food.  On a nondescript Tuesday afternoon, the place was jammed, not a single table available.  Fortunately, my host had made a reservation well in advance and there was no wait.  \n\nUpon being seated I quickly realized one thing:  this is a \"guy's place.\"  The decor, setting and feel of the room was definitely \"masculine.\"  While I may not be PC for noting this neither am I blind and brain-dead; the place has a \"red meat/blue blood\" look and feel.  Beautiful woods, thick crisp linens, elegant crystal chandeliers...it just felt stalwart, honest and forthright.  Elegant, without pretense.  \n\nService was great.  By the time my butt hit the chair we were served water and warm (amazing!) bread and fresh rich butter were brought to the table.  Our glasses (tea and lemonade) were refilled with stealth professionalism and the wait staff was very helpful, particularly in making selections from the menu.\n\nI wasn't particularly, hungry, but wanted to taste the beef that Bob's is so famous for (Kansas in origin I believe).  The chef must have anticipated a palate like mine - offering up a crisp green salad overwhelmed (yum!) with slices of rib eye steak and blue cheese.  The dish was perfect: the greens were lightly teased with a vinaigrette that had just the perfect acidity to match up with the beef and cheese.  I asked for more of the amazing bread and butter (seemed like just-churned) and sent the plate back immaculate.  Bread dish & butter also unburdened of evert morsel. \n\nWhat made this otherwise simple and basic dish so memorable was the beef, however.  Generous slices of 3/8\" thick slices (perfect for the dish) were done to perfection - medium rare inside and blackened on the outside.  The cut was rich, flavorful and tender.  The mouthfeel was ideal - full of meaty texture without a fiber of grisly resistance.  And most important:  the beef stood on its own; there was little or no residual spice, salt or flavor enhancer.  Thanks God!\n\nMy fellow diners were equally pleased.  One, deciding to be a contrarian, went for the fish tacos (halibut).  The presentation was beautiful and the flavors were perfect (yes, I begged a bite...too enticing to resist!).  \n\nWe finished with coffee, which was fresh-brewed and refilled without ceremony or disruption.  \n\nSo, what's a \"perfect lunch\"?  it is a lunch that went so smoothly that it was almost forgettable, but so tasty that the memory lingers for over a week later.  Only one warning:  this is probably not the place to take your kale mongering food toady deb friends.  While the menu is eclectic, Bob's knows why it was placed on this planet...and they make not apologies for bringing-on a VERY upscale \"red-meat\" experience (RME).  And while I don't frequently indulge in RME, I am not going to compromise when I do. And Bob's compromises nothing...not even the butter!", "author": "Bill R."}

Bob's even discount's it to $15 if you eat there.\n We started with the Calamari. For me, it was a bit to chewy, nevertheless, still very good.

Undecided of which steak I was going to order, i kept looking at their simple yet full of options menu. The waitress then mentioned that they also had in the restaurant a very special steak, Kobe steak. The meat is generally considered to be a delicacy, renowned for its flavor, and tenderness. So that's what I had. Let me put it this way, it's the best steak I have EVER had. So juicy, not overly seasoned. The steak had so much natural flavor. They actually just served it on a cutting board. Paired it with a delicious Cab, and I had the best steak dinner of my life. \nWe asked to complement the Chef and he came out. He said it's a real treat for him to prepare this kind of steak and took a lot of pride in it. His name is Santana Diaz, and he used to be Sacramento Kings Maloof brothers' personal chef. He gave me his card to call him to make sure he had Kobe steaks whenever we stopped by again. It was a pretty cool move.\nBy the way, the desert is also humongous.

I gave half of my piece away! The sauce on top with the salmon tasted good with the mash side. The whole seasoned carrot was sooo good. Everyone keeps telling me how good the carrot was and I must agree! Mashed potatoes was so good with everything! Especially with the creamed corn in it.\n\nPrime Ribeye - I got to try a piece of the steak and it was very juicy for a medium rare cooked piece. I enjoyed my bite for sure. Grilled onions wasn't a hit for us. We all didn't really like the onions.\n\nCreamed Corn - I love corn! It was very creamy, more on the creamier side which I didn't mind. \n\nCreamed Spinach - There was cheese in it which I love! As time went on with the dinner, this dish got cold and the cheese hardened so it was so tasty after about 20 minutes. Must eat this dish quick. It was also very thick.

The wine list is very poorly done with a handful of the usual corporate selections and very few interesting producers.  Again, I would have expected more.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Attentive, non-obtrusive and friendly. My iced tea was always being filled without me noticing it. Our server gave us great recommendations which we followed. We were not disappointed.\n\nFOOD. Loved the warm bread and generous amount of butter. I ordered the bone-in Cote de Boeuf ribeye upon the recommendation of the server. And my, it was excellent! It was tasty, tender, and cooked perfectly medium-well the way I requested. I liked the marbled meat with a little fat which made it even tastier. I didn't think I could finish it at first because it was huge, but I did! The steak came with a big, tender glazed carrot and mashed potatoes. The caramelized carrot hit home. I don't know how to explain it, except that the taste made me think of and feel like...Christmas. Perhaps there was a dash of cinnamon in the carrot glaze, the same kind of cinnamon sprinkled on hot cocoa I used to drink growing up every Christmas morning. The \"smashed\" potatoes were great, too, although I didn't finish it because I focused more on the yummy steak. We also ordered the crab cakes which we happily devoured, and desserts (bread pudding and creme brulee). We enjoyed the desserts, too, but between the three of us, we left a few dessert bites on the plates because the entrees were so big that we were so full by the time we hit our third course. \n\nAMBIANCE. The restaurant is inside the beautiful Omni Hotel. Walking in, you will right away feel the upscale ambiance of it all. This is the place to eat when you want to celebrate, to treat yourself, or to feel special just because. \n\nIn summary, I would go back to Bob's in a heartbeat. This has now become my new go-to place for steak. It's not cheap, but I always believe that you get what you pay for. And in this case, the attentive service, the delicious food, and the classy ambiance definitely made it all worth it.", "author": "Algo R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-28", "description": "On Saturday, 4/26/14, my girlfriend and I ate at Bob's Steak and Chops for dinner. Bob's is connected to the Omni hotel. Bob's is a restaurant that started in Dallas. They have a good reputation for serving various cuts of prime Texas style beef. \n\nAtmosphere/D\u00e9cor:\n\nThe restaurant is really nice. It kind of reminds me of a combination between Morton's steakhouse and Alfred's steakhouse but Bob's is more upscale in my opinion. The tables and chairs are really nice. They also have booth seating available. The lighting of the restaurant is low to dim which creates more of an intimate setting.\n\nFood: \n\nWhen we first sat down the waitress brought out a jar full of pickles and peppers. I read some yelp reviews that say the pickles and peepers are very good. My girlfriend and I didn't try either. I just didn't trust the fact that there's a possibility of other previous diners reaching in and touching the jars, pickles and peppers not being replaced to fresh ones. I decided to go with the Coute De Beef bone in ribeye 22 oz steak. I ordered the steak medium. I always order my steaks medium but If I'm eating Kobe beef I'll order it medium rare. My Coute De Beef came out well done! I was disappointed. I took a few bites and it tasted really good but it was overcooked. I was so hungry I thought about just eating it and not sending it back but I thought since I'm paying almost $60 bucks for this steak it should be cooked to my liking. The waitress came by and said \"how does everything taste?\" I said, \"Good, but my steak is overcooked, it's well done.\" She took a look at my steak and said, \"Oh yeah, that's way overcooked. Let me take that steak back and I'll have them cook you another one.\" While I was waiting for them to cook my new steak, my girlfriend was enjoying her steak. The manager came over to our table and apologized and said my steak will be coming out shortly. About 10 minutes later my steak came out. I started eating the steak and it still wasn't cooked to medium. It was a mixture of medium well and well done throughout the steak. I didn't send the steak back for the 2nd time, I ate it. The steak came with garlic smashed potatoes and a huge long carrot with some type of cinnamon syrup glaze. The smashed potatoes were excellent. They had a ton of flavor. I didn't care for the carrot. The sweet glaze was a little too much for me. It didn't go well or compliment the steak and smashed potatoes.\n  \nMy girlfriend ordered the 9 oz filet mignon. She liked it a lot. She ordered her steak medium. It came out a true medium well. She wished her steak was medium but she still enjoyed it. She loved the smashed potatoes as well but didn't care for the carrot either.\n \nOur waitress came over to our table and told us that dessert is on the house because of my overcooked steak. I passed on dessert even though it was free but my girlfriend ordered the banana rum bread pudding topped off with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. My girlfriend said the dessert was rich and tasted good. \nMaybe the Executive or main chef wasn't there that night but every steak should be cooked perfectly at a steak house. There's no excuse for an under cooked or overcooked steak.\n  \nService:\n\nOur waitress was great! She was very attentive and when I asked her about the history of Bob's Steaks and Chops, she seemed to know a lot about the history. She explained to me where Bobs' started at and where the various locations are. She was very knowledgeable.\n \nOverall:\n \nBob's Steaks and Chops is a good steak restaurant. They serve high quality prime beef steaks. Even if you overcook a prime steak it's still going to taste good because prime beef is considered top 1%. I would have given Bob's a 4 but the fact my steak was overcooked, technically twice, I had to take off 2 stars. If you're staying at the Omni Hotel and you are craving a flavorful steak, then Bob's is a good restaurant to dine at. I would go back to Bob's and give it another shot and order a different steak but not anytime soon. It's hard for me to give steakhouses high ratings because after eating at Alexander's steakhouse you've have experienced nothing but the best. Other steakhouses don't compare and can't compete with Alexander's.", "author": "David R."}

Broccoli was a bit tough and could have been a lot tender.\n\nAll together, accounting for the food, couple bottles of nice wine, tip and tax, we probably paid around $50~ per person.

The Calamari are always cooked to perfection and though I rarely put lemon on calamari I works perfect here. The preparation allows for the lemon not to overwhelm. Regarding the shrimp cocktail, the presentation is a little different; comes with the cocktail sauce on the shrimp. I prefer it on the side. Regardless, ask for extra horseradish. Why make a bid deal over calamari and a shrimp cocktail - they do it right.\n\nThe Filets and Strips are always incredibly flavorful; great cuts of prime beef and cooked to perfection.

We finished every last bite. I also purchased a bottle of the Gundlach Bundschu 2010 Cabernet for $45 which was absolutely delicious!! My inner wine snob loves cab that is aged in French oak specifically, and this is one of them! The vineyard retails the bottle for $40, so $45 does not feel like you're being robbed by inflation like many other restaurants do... This was a very pleasant surprise! I would recommend purchasing this bottle time and time again if you're ordering any red meat for sure and love a delightful cab at a reasonable price!!! Corkage is $25, take that for what it is.

In any case, onto the Cote de Beauf!\n\nMy that is one tender fine piece of meat stuck to the bone.  That is, the Cote de Beauf.  A few friends of mine decided to go at it on a steak streak for some time and finally came across Bob's, one that I've heard plenty about but never made the effort to go.  But I'm glad I did and tasting that first bite of the savory, meaty, goodness that I've had the privilege of cutting up and devouring was in its own a well rounded moment of indulgence, in its purest forms.  \n\nNot only is this meat perhaps aged, it's got the marbling and with the instruction for a Rare Temperature, they did just that and gave me a bloody great steak.  Not to forget, that big ass carrot that sticks out like an eye sore reminds you who's boss, and that's Bob.  Bob's carrot is perhaps cooked in duck fat as it comes out glistening and separates between the steak and the skillet potatoes which were practically homemade potato chips smothered in pepper gravy.  Delicious all across the board. \n\nI also made the unfortunately mistake of eating a bit too much bread, which was nicely warmed and almost similar to the HOPR bread, but the kicker is the pickles in the jar they provided.  I love slightly salted pickles, and they had it.  So those two items were probably a foolish move, but luckily I did finish my entire meal with no regrets.  \n\nNow.....when to go back.......", "author": "Vincent K."}

In addition to the delicious dungeness cobb salad, we absolutely loved the sourdough round that they served to each table.  Unfortunately, though, near the end of my employment across the street from Bob's, they started using a different baker and the bread just wasn't the same...\n\nAnyway, I hadn't been to Bob's in years and my bf had been wanting to go because his mother once told him that the chicken-fried ribeye was delicious so I decided to treat him to Bob's around the holidays.  To our dismay we learned that both the dungeness cobb salad that I loved so much and the chicken-fried ribeye that his mother recommended were only served at lunch.  To my pleasure, however, the sourdough round of yumminess was BACK!  Thankfully Bob's returned to the baker they had previously used!\n\nEven though the items that we planned to order weren't offered at dinner, we were able to find plenty of things on the menu that appealed to us.  Ultimately, we decided to share the Prime \"Bone In\" Kansas City Strip and the skillet fried potatoes with sauteed onions and peppercorn gravy.  Because we were sharing the steak, our server brought it out to us on two separate plates with separate servings of both the potatoes and the glazed carrot they serve with every entree.  The steak was quite delicious, but the potatoes were a little too crunchy for my taste, and I really didn't care for the glazed carrot.  My bf, however, ate both of our carrots - I guess it's one of those things that you either love or you hate.\n\nFor dessert I was planning on ordering the creme brulee but our server convinced us to try the banana nut rum bread pudding.  Admittedly I'm not really a fan of bread pudding but our server raved about it so much I decided to give it another try.  I thought that the bread pudding was just ok and our server offered to deduct it from our bill since we would've ordered the creme brulee if it wasn't for his suggestion.  However, I told him that it wasn't necessary - the bread pudding wasn't horrible (we did manage to finish it all) I guess bread pudding just isn't my thing.\n\nAll in all we had a great meal and a great time.  Our server was very friendly and helped to set the tone for a great night out.  We will definitely return - but next time we're going during lunch!", "author": "Laura L."}

Should of known better but that's another story.  Bob's is located in the Omni hotel in the heart of san francisco's financial district.  Parking is hell in this area especially on weekdays, but lucky the folks lived close enough where we walked to dinner.\n\nI think the Omni was renovated recently but everything in the restaurant just seemed... old.  From the curtains, to the table cloth, to the carpet, everything looks dated.  The color of everything seems faded as if one too many summers under the sun.  There basically is no good view as the restaurant is at street level and right beyond the wall of tall windows is the bustling after work street traffic.  Maybe some people do enjoy that kind of view, I don't know.\n\nIt is common for hotel restaurants to be overly priced but generally the quality of the food is pleasing enough to pardon the pain in the wallet.  This place lives up to being over priced, but fail miserably to deliver even a mediocre steak.  The only steak they got right was the one cooked rare.  \n\nSeems like it's signature for this place to add a big fat carrot to each steak plate.  So imagine this, a big pot filled with carrots cooking in water until someone orders a steak.  That's how tasteless and overcook the carrot was.  Maybe a little bit classier veggie side?\n\nThey do have very courteous servers.

Wow!!  I then realized that this guy Adam didn't believe we could of paid for this meal due to the way we were dressed??  WTF?!?

This place had to be one of the most elegant and beautiful restaurants I've ever entered. I just saw $$$ signs everywhere I look around the restaurant. They had one of the most comfortable leather seats, it was like sitting on a cloud, soft and fluffy. \n\nFor the first course, I ordered their lobster bisque. That had an excellent flavor and had little chunky pieces of lobster. Some of my colleagues who had the soup said that it was a bit salty, I thought it was just right.\n\nFor my main course, I had their 28 oz Porter House Steak. It's a bone-in steak with a tenderloin and top loin (New York Steak) served with house fried potatoes with gravy sauce and carrot. I ordered mine MR but it came out MW. Since I was at a company dinner, I didn't want to send it back until I told my colleague that it was overcooked. Once the server came to attention, he realize that it was and he took it back to the kitchen. This is really nice of them to do that because they want to Make It Right for their customers. \n\nThe reason why I didn't want them to make a new steak because they will rush it and you don't want rush a porter house steak. Since its bone-in, it takes much longer to cook to perfection. Additionally, everyone else would be finished by the time I get my steak. The server said 10 minutes but it took more like 20 minutes.. \n\nOnce my steak came to my table, everyone was pretty much finished. I sliced the middle part of the steak and it was really rare. Luckily, I can eat a steak that is seared. The server came to attention and asked me if I want it cooked a little more. I really appreciate the servers concern but I just accepted the way it was. \n\nI like eating my steaks R but the porter house is a think cut steak and beautifully marbles with fat, you want it cooked MR. The quality of the steak is top notch. It wasn't chewy at all and had a texture of Maguro (Tuna Sashimi) very very tender. I couldn't finish the steak since so much time has elapsed.\n\nI would have rated Bob's 3 stars but the service and effort deserves an extra star.

Service was impeccable, maybe due in part to the fact that we were one of four tables in the restaurant. Still, our glasses were always full and we were well taken care of.\n\nThe food was delicious, but be careful if you have a small table (i.e. two people). The portions are very large. My wife ordered a few vegetables and I ordered a filet with skillet fried potatoes. We literally left 2/3 of the food to be thrown away... Such a waste too because it was all very good. \n\nMy filet was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well. It had a great flavor - definitely one of the better steaks I've had. The potatoes were great too... crunchy but covered in saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and sauce. The carrot was much larger than I expected. I also tried my wife's broccoli and asparagus and both were cooked very well. \n\nThe beverages were made quickly and very well, and our waiter kept our water filled and made sure we were okay several times. I also ordered one of the less expensive glasses of wine to have with my steak and it was very good.\n\nMy only caveat is that I was too tired from the flight to SF to really be able to relax and enjoy a few drinks and the meal. We ate and promptly retreated to our room for some much needed R&R. \n\nIf there was anything else I could complain about, it's the price. I'm not wealthy nor were we dining on a company card... and $150 for dinner for two is a little high for a hotel steakhouse. I would have preferred to have paid $100 and gotten half the food (that we threw away anyway).

One of the things that I have struggled with since moving to the Bay area is finding what I would consider to be a good steak.  I've been to Alexander's which is good...but any steak that needs a sauce to cover it up is questionable in my mind.  Morton's and Ruth's Chris are consistently good, but very \"chainy\" feeling.  With the exception of Espetus which I don't consider to be a traditional steak place but a Brazilian churascaria and maybe some of the prime rib joints (Broadway Prime in Burlingame, House of Prime Rib in SF as examples), everything else in the Bay seems to be too overpriced for what you get or lean from being \"grass fed\" which to me results in little flavor.\n\nI had the bone-in NY Strip with baked potato and a classic wedge salad.  The steak was thick, incredibly flavored, well marbled, and perfectly cooked.  The baked potato was unremarkable (not a ton you can do with a baked potato...let's be honest).  The salad was exactly what I was hoping for...a good chunk of iceberg lettuce loaded with blue cheese dressing, chopped crispy bacon, and diced tomatoes...simple, yet delicious.\n\nIf you haven't been to Bob's, I would highly recommend it.  All steaks come with their trademark huge, phallic cooked carrot which I generally ignore because I don't like cooked carrots.  Ask them for their pickle jar (which is kind of funny for a nice steak place to bring to your table as an appetizer).", "author": "Steve L."}

It is one of those restaurant where you can enjoy your meal in peace without feeling rushed by the waitor to leave after you have finished your plate. It is a nice place for a romantic dinner for two or a great place to enjoy a meal beforehand with good friends before a night out on the town. Moreover, there is a bar across the aisle that also belongs to Bob's. The bar is also really nice and classy. It is a spot that you can enjoy a drink or two without the loud music or television and loud patrons in the background. The patrons at Bob's are \"mature\" and thus, are not like the loud patrons at some of the places that I've found myself at. They also have finger food at the bar.\n\nSkimming through the menu, I contemplated between the filet mignon or the crab cakes. I decided on the filet mignon because my friend wanted the crab cakes and I can sample off of her plate. The filet mignon was ok. I've never had such a big glazed carrot served to me before. It was huge! I wasn't too satisfied with the crab cakes only because I've had better. \n\nOverall, the setting of this place is nice and service is attentive but the food is mediocre.", "author": "Linh N."}

We ate at the bar, standard ambiance with football games on.\n\nThe reason that Bob's is getting one star is because my and my boss's medium-rare ribeye steaks came out pretty much well done, and when we mentioned they were \"slightly\" overcooked when asked, our waiter proceeded to tell us it was the light setup that made the steaks look darker and that they were actually medium-rare. Not sure how light can uncook/rarify steaks but if somebody knows, please update me. All I know is my tastebuds can taste how cooked a steak is and my knife can feel how tender a steak is.\n\nGlazed carrot and potatoes were pretty good.

Believe me, I've tried to resurrect stale bread, and it had that familiar taste of failure. Complimentary pickles are offered at the center of every table (it looks just as weird as it sounds). I started with the cocktail shrimp, 4 for $16 - decent but not worth the price. The high note of my meal was the beefsteak tomato onion salad. Next, I got the 22 oz bone in rib eye, it was nice that the entrees included sides, but they were very ordinary just like the steak. I especially wasn't a big fan of the carrot (yes, ONE carrot), which tasted like it was cooked in apple cider. And what's up with the creme brulee? I honestly thought creme brulee was impossible to ruin, but this was probably the worst creme brulee I've ever had.\n\nIf i wanted quantity, I would've just gone to Black Angus and saved some $$$.

Even though it's in a hotel, the restaurant has a good steakhouse feel to it, which I always appreciate.\n\nI started off with a martini, and it was pretty big, and quite strong.  Then we decided to share the fried calamari and crab cake for appetizers.  The calamari was pretty good, but the crab cake was amazing.  If it wasn't a steakhouse, I might have to go back one day and just have the crab cake dinner!  \n\nRibeye is my favorite cut, and the last couple of times I went out for steak, they didn't have ribeye -- e.g. Bobo's and other non-steakhosues -- so I was excited for Bob's.  I had heard a lot about the Cote de Beouf, but I wasn't hungry enough for it, so I just ordered the regular ribeye.  Good thing too, because I didn't realize how big the sides were!  The steak came with a glazed carrot and skillet-fried potatoes.  This was a JUMBO carrot, and it was delicious -- \"best carrot ever\" according to one of my friends -- and the potatoes were good too.  The steak was perfectly medium rare, and just lightly seasoned so the meat was accentuated and not overpowered by the seasoning.

You can order just about any drink you want and they can make it for you and if you're like me once in a while you invent a drink and they can make that as well. \n\nThe dining experience wasn't so great. Maybe it was because we at late or it was a busy Friday night. Our server was so so and very slow. The bread and water were great for the first 20 minutes. \n\nOnce our steaks come out they seemed a little greasy okay very greasy! It was like the steaks were fried in oil or something. The over all taste was okay but I've had better steak and I don't even eat a lot of steak. The sides were just lame minus the mash potatoes. The cream of spinach was bland, the country potatoes and gravy was over cooked and maybe under seasoned and the baked potato was also small and over cooked. \n\nWould I eat here again? Maybe because maybe they were just having a bad night.", "author": "Karim R."}

My colleagues and I walked in and were asked if we wanted a private booth which we thought was cool and things were off to a good start.\n\nThat's where it ended. \n\nThe quality of food was very POOR. We all ordered the Kansas Cut Steak and was brought the wrong order for one of the guys. The meal was over priced for what it is. I felt as if I was served from a buffet spread. The veggies were over cooked although the steak was decent. I had much higher expectations for a steak house like this.\n\nThe service was BEYOND DISAPPOINTING. The host had to bring us our food while the table still had dirty appetizer plates. The host insisted on handing one of the guys a scorching hot plate instead of placing it on the table. I had to clean up the table myself to give room for the dinner plates. Prior to that, I also had to get up to bus our old wine glasses because our table was getting cluttered. \n\nCOMPARED TO BOBO'S OR HARRIS, THIS PLACE DOES NOT HOLD A LIGHT TO EITHER.  If I'm paying $50.00 for a steak, I expect a good steak and GOOD service. At one point during the dinner, I HAD to ask the waiter to pay more attention to our table and check in on us. He was dumbfounded and made an excuse that he had a table of four that turned into a party of 22. I understand that it was unexpected, but FIGURE IT OUT, tell your manager or ask for some help. \n\nI DON'T RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE.

Off to a good start...\n\nMy steak (the Rib-eye) was undercooked but still delicious!  I was impressed but the steak itself but the peppercorn potatoes left me a little disappointed.  I expected a strong delicious peppercorn taste but it really just tasted like plain thanksgiving gravy.  The carrot was also overcooked and I wish I could have subbed it for another veggie like broccoli or something.  \n\nMy boyfriend's steak (the New York Strip) was not impressive.  He felt like he could make this quality if a steak at home, and for these prices that is unacceptable.  He also thought the sides were mediocre and was generally unimpressed with Bob's.  \n\nIn a city full of expensive and AMAZING steakhouses like BoBo's and House of Prime Rib you need to stand out or be affordable... this place did neither.\n\nI would not recommend this place if you are going out looking for a special night or amazing steak.", "author": "Jessica J."}

THIS IS ONE FINE STEAKHOUSE!!!!!\n\nUpon your entrance into Bob's the initial impression is spaciousness... very, very high ceilings, and more than enough elbow room between tables. Wood, nice and dark and atmospheric... just the right touch for a steakhouse! Most steakhouses will not have this spaciousness, unless they're located within an older structure. White tablecloths... not necessary for my taste, but that's OK too. \n\nIn my latest visit to Bob's I ordered their Porterhouse (but I have ordered their New York, and Rib-Eye in the past)... this is definitely a Porterhouse upon initial observation! The Porterhouse looked very similar to this ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cj14YLKJk5fWDjYc6auZVg?select=oEv9GdPPYhNWIWf2BbgOKw ). Porterhouse had just the right amount of singed meat on the outside which produced a Porterhouse that ranged from medium at the outer edges to barely rare near the bone. Bob's is not afraid of seasoning the meat... to some palates the seasoning could be a little much. I also like the fact that Bob's leaves some fat on the meat for flavor... Who's afraid of a little bit of fat? This is one helluva piece of meat! \n\nEverything is of Texas-size here at Bob's. The bread was huge. The potatoes we had, slathered on the side, was of the (s)mashed variety with onions mixed in; and of course there is the signature giganto glazed carrot (now the carrot looked like it was grown with something not natural!). Even the utensils were of the Texas variety!\n\nCan't review the after-dinner items on the menu, mainly because there was no room after every meal here at Bob's! \n\nFor the reviewers complaining about the wait time between appetizers and the main dish... I definitely need the all the time I can get to make room for a twenty-eight ounce steak... don't mind the wait at all! \n\nService was excellent... cordial and timely, and most importantly not intrusive. All I ask of any restaurant is... just let me EAT! \n\nThe problem is AFTER consuming such a humongous piece of meat. My son and I WALKED off the meal... all the way down to the Mission district... Dinner? Forget it, had enough already!\n\nWhy do I like Bob's over Ruth's Chris or Morton's? Bob's Steakhouse Steaks LOOKs like the meat came from a cow... where Morton's or Ruth's Chris' steaks seems as if they've been on steroids or a cow-growth-hormone! At Morton's especially... a Rib-Eye looks like a New York, which looks like a Filet Mignon, which looks like...

That is steep... so I am thinking  THIS MUST BE AN AMAZING STEAK....  but after our waiter got my glass of wine... he was missing in action..... no bread at our table... and the single guy at the window seat that came in after us is on his tablet (not looking out the window) already enjoying his salad. We havent even ordered yet.\n\n\nThey sat another couple at our table and the older gentlement is conducting business loudly on his cell phone with the ringer (which is set like a traditional old phone) is ringing non stop thru the rest of our meal.   LOVELY.....\n\nFinally our waiter shows up.... we order steaks.  My wife orders medium rare, I order medium.  the waiter is walking away and I ask him if we can have bread and his only nods while he is walking away... \n\nWe did not see that waiter agian until we were leaving the restaurant.\n\nOur steaks arrive, they dap a teaspoon of everything you want on your baked potatoe then walk away with the condiments ---  I was grateful that we still had butter from the bread.   My wifes steak is cooked perfectly BUT mine is medium RARE... the middle is just not cooked at all....practically bleeding...... I wait and wait and finally flagged down a really nice waitress who takes my steak back.    \n\nMy steak comes back and it was as if they never even bothered putting it back on the grill.... it is still literally rubbery bleeding in the middle.... NOW, NOW I have finally had it!  I asked for the manager and talked to him about how disaapointed we were, he made excuses (lied about the table being occupied that they sat the single guy) and asked me if I wanted a new steak...  I told him at this point NO I do not want another steak, I would pay for my wifes steak, but I would not be paying for mine.  He said fine, there will be no bill for anything and then he had a waiter remove my plate entirely (not even letting me eat the dry baked potatoe).... he should have at least let me eat something, he just had my plate removed.  I came really looking forward to this steak, hungry and I left furstrated and STARVING.... at least they had M and M's in the mini bar!\n\nWe finally saw the waiter again and he acted frustrated and said \"no bill\" and walked away.\n\nSo.... here we are celebrating and expecting to splurge on a nice steak.... we didnt eat lunch expecting this nice meal ---- and I leave without eating and with having a big damper on our evening.\n\nI am sorry, for a place that charges $54 for a steak ? this was the worst trainwreck and poor excuse for an upper scale restaurant.  They should be ashamed.\n\nI will be copying review to the Omni as well as Bob's owner....", "author": "Dyan B."}

The steaks were good enough, no better than dozens of other places, but the side dishes were inedible. Soggy carrots, McDonald's french fries, gloppy salad dressings, and soup obviously full of yesterday's leftovers with strangely mixed flavors. $30 lunches without drinks is just a bit.

While they all ordered the chicken-fried rib eye, I decided to go the \"lite\" route and ordered the scallops.  They were perfectly cooked and really tasty.  The dish comes with ratatouille, which wasn't the best thing I've had, but considering I hate every ingredient in there (squash, bell pepper, onion)  it was actually decent enough to eat.  I would definitely order a steak next time since they are a \"steakhouse\".  The peanut butter ice-cream for dessert was awesome and the highlight of the meal.

My friend and I had filet mignon at $29 each for a 6oz piece with potatoes and glazed carrots on the side.  The filet was okay, not fantastic.  The glazed carrots were meh.  The smashed potatoes were so-so.  Their bread and butter was very good though!\n\nFirst thing I didn't like about this place is that our waiter was pushy - he kept offering us the day's special and everything else to upgrade our order.  We wanted soup but the soup of the day was onion and we did not like that and he offered that he could have lobster bisque made especially for us!  Ha!  Then he asked if we wanted to order sides, that was after we told him all we wanted was the steak.\n\nThen the most insulting part was that three times, waiters came to our table asking us if we were done eating as they wanted to take our plates away - and this happened while my friend still has some steak on her plate and I still had the potatoes and still had my knife and fork wide apart from each other on my plate!  There was no reason to rush us because the place was half-empty.\n\nA really classy restaurant with the prices they charged would have just let us linger and when we asked for the bill is when they would clear our table.\n\nWas it because we used an OpenTable Spotlight certificate and wanted to get rid of us fast?  I can't answer that one.\n\nBut I really think it was rude of them to keep coming to our table asking if we were ready to have it cleared.\n\nAnd for that I give this place ONE star - only because there is no such thing as NO STAR - otherwise I would rate this place NO STAR.", "author": "Carmen F."}

Sort of a disappointment.\n\nDecor wasn't as outdated as I envisioned after reading the other reviews.  It's in the Omni Hotel and in my opinion, steakhouses can get away with the burgundy and oak look.  Here's my take on Bob's.  If you want a bone-in ribeye, this is your place, but don't expect too much from the side dishes.

Was by myself, so wanted a steakhouse where I could sit at the bar.  My hotel concierge suggested Bob's, as it's only a few blocks away from my hotel.\n\nArrived at Bob's and went right to the bar.  There was a single seat, so I grabbed it.  bartender was busy, so I waited patiently for him to bring the wine-by-the-glass menu.  I ordered a glass of cab.\n\nHe brought the wine and took my order.  9oz filet and a baked potato, thanks.  I also saw it came with some carrot dish.  More on that in a moment.\n\nThe waiter has to go get the food.  No runners at Bob's, so the service was a bit slow.  I expected my salad within about 5 mins or so.  Took closer to 15 or 20 mins.  I'm not in any rush, but still...\n\nSalad came.  He topped it with pepper.  Too much cabbage in the tossed salad for my liking.   And the ranch dressing was voluminous and drenching the entire salad.  Points off.\n\nI found it odd that there was no bread offered.  What kind of steakhouse doesn't serve some piping-hot bread?\n\nAnyway, he took the plate away and almost immediately the steak arrived.  It was accompanied by a baked potato and the bartender did the presentation of sour cream, chives, bacon and cheese.   Do I want any?  Sure.  He skimped a bit on the cheese and bacon, but did fine on the sour cream.\n\nThe steak was flavorful.  Not phenomenal, but not too bad either.  The steak was the highlight of the meal.  The potato was not bad once everything was mixed in.  And that carrot.  Holy cow!  That thing was bugs bunny huge!  Just massive and covered in something sweet.  I would have preferred it without the sweet stuff.\n\nI took my time and enjoyed.  The bartender NEVER came over to check on me, so it's a good thing I'm low maintenance.\n\nI quickly pulled out my credit card while he was in view and he took care of the bill.  A glass of wine, a steak, a side salad and tip = $77.

There are 7 of us for dinner followed by some kind of entertainment - as of yet unknown.  There is a lot of talk about economics and especially the housing bubble and its bursting - we fancy ourselves experts and we take turns trying to outdo one another's analysis of the situation.  The drinks are well poured so we keep drinking.  After a couple drinks, someone always picks up the tab - at some point after a number of these evenings, you begin to get the sense that you have not gotten the drinks for some time and this time is probably your turn, when you get that feeling you buy.  Of course this is not policed in any way.\n\nAround 9 -9:30 we sit down at our table.  People around us get looks of concern on their faces when they see us walking towards them - this, obviously to them, can come to no good.  It doesn't help that one in our party is audibly slurring his words.  As he sits we give him some bread before he is allowed to order any more drinks.\n\nWe have another round of cocktails as we wait for our order.  All but one of us gets some form of red meat - the lone man out gets salmon.  WHAT?!?!?!?  He is the brunt of every joke for the rest of the evening.  His explanation, he had steak the night before???  Moron.  He will never do that again - the peer pressure is so great.  You may think I am kidding, I am not!\n\nCouple guys get salads (The Caesar looks good, but the beefsteak tomato with Red Onion is the winner), couple others get soup and the table shares a couple orders of the Shrimp Platter, Mushrooms, Onion Rings and Calamari.  Accepting the mushrooms, everything is very good.\n\nSeeing empty glasses, our waiter asks if anyone would like another cocktail (its probably 10:15 already).  There are a couple cocktail orders and the rest of us order wine which lasts through dinner.\n\nWhen everyone's food arrives the table gets quiet for a bit as it takes in the Baked potatoes, the Creamed Spinach, the broccoli and the Asparagus...  which are all good.  My favorites are the bakers (when I am in the carb mood) and the asparagus which is always excellent...  Ahhh, and the steaks (and of course the silly plate of salmon) - someone let him know what guys night out is all about.  The slight scent of pepper and freshly cooked steaks permeates the air around the table, mixing with the scents from around the large room to form a delicious redolence.  As the moment passes, conversation picks up again and we all start to eat, hardly aware of the pause at all.\n\nEverything is great.  The wine pours and the Zinfandel mixes well with the filet as to nearly bring a tear to my eye... nearly - I am with the guys and this salmon eating fool is the heel this night and I am certainly not taking that away from him. \n\nAfter dinner, of course, cognac for some, coffee for others.  Everyone is visibly relaxed and happy!\n\nBob's is very, very good.

The meat is USDA Prime and is impeccably marbled with delicious fattiness that only my heart attack  jacket (my fat gut) can truly love.  They use a combination of wet and dry aging which I truly prefer.  The steaks are broiled, which in my opinion, is the only way to lock in flavor.

But since I've ordered the same thing every time I was waiting until I tried something else. After at least five visits that hasn't happened. So based on my limited sampling I would recommend this restaurant. The chopped salad followed by the New York Steak and baked potato.  That is my staple meal.  I would advise telling them you don't want the candied carrot that comes with it. Unless of course you like candied carrots. Even then tell them to put it on a separate plate.  Its just a large carrot and they put it right next to the steak. So then that part of your New York taste like a candied carrot. The beef is too good to be touched by the carrot.", "author": "Cindy B."}

I guess there's not much the restaurant can do about their clientele, but it definitely made me as a woman feel uncomfortable.\n\nThen the food was also not amazing.  Maybe this is because I'm a vegetarian and was eating at a steakhouse, but in SF, any restaurant needs to have one good veggie dish that's not just a sandwich.  Oh wait, that's what it was.

I have absolutely no idea where Bob's gets their meat but they must coddle and feed these cows on a nipple because the meat was just that damn good!  My wife got the NY Steak and I got the Ribeye.

These days that was above and beyond what anyone could possibly do.  My wife and I were floored.  Did I forget to mention that the Ribeye was fantastic?  \n\nWhen the bread pudding came my wife's jaw dropped to the floor which really only happens when she sees Brad Pitt ala Fight Club.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-11-02", "description": "Part of my job requires a fair amount of travel and and entertaining clients - at least once/twice per week.  Luckily I have the privilege of trying out a plethora of new restaurants...without paying for them myself.  Aside from \"the scene\" or the hype of a new hot-spot, I like to use one simple litmus test everywhere I go: \"Would I go here with my family/friends and pay for it out of my own pocket?\"  Let's face it, eating out can get really expensive and new restaurants featuring some \"executive chef who once took a yoga class with Thomas Keller\" are a dime-a-dozen and not always worth coming back to...let alone the $50-150+ per person, out the door.\n\nBeing a red-blooded American, I love my steak houses and Bob's Chop House was the last one on my list to try in San Francisco.  I was excited at first and it came highly recommended...more sophisticated than \"Izzy's\" (in the Marina) without the chain-store predictability of Morton's or Ruth's Chris (which are both good).  The service was prompt and polite.  Drinks were stiff and the wine list was extensive, if not a tad over-priced.  The first thing to hit the table was a big jar of pickles & red peppers.  Interesting touch but not appealing to me at all.  The bread arrived and looked pretty fresh but even the hulking steak knife couldn't cut through the little loaf.  Either provide sharper knives or cut the bread before you bring it out.  \n\nOur table tried a variety of appetizers and sides including the $9 \"Beefsteak Tomato Salad\" which consists of two fat tomato slices and about a quarter of an onion sprinkled with Bleu Cheese.  Tasty...but not worth $9 each.  Steamed Broccoli was fresh and cooked just right.  Creamed Spinach (one of two \"must have\" sides at a killer steak house) was unoriginal and didn't stand out from the average mom/grandma/aunt recipe (think: \"Marie Calendar's\" quality).  Sauted Mushrooms were big and tender (perfectly cooked) with just the right amount of flavor in the \"sauce\" to not overpower the subtle flavor of the mushrooms.  \n\nMy entree plate came with a large carrot....which I promptly moved out of the way and something they called \"Skillet Potatoes.\"  Every steak house has it's signature potato dish and this was it @ Bob's.  Imagine dumping out a bag of unsalted,  thick-cut potato chips from Trader Joe's on a plate followed by a ladle of sauted onions in a flavorless goo...ok...keep thinking about it...pretty gross, huh?  They were tough to chew and Impossible to cut with the large (but dull) steak knife (yes, I politely asked for a new knife - and it was of the same caliber).\n\nAnd now, the main event, for 50% of Bob's grade, the MEAT....\n\nI ordered the 20 oz. Prime Rib-Eye \"Cote de Boeuf\" ($41) at the recommendation of the waiter who insisted this was not just bigger than the 12 oz Rib-Eye (obviously) but I would notice the difference in flavor.  I prefer my slabs of meat medium rare...which is pink throughout and in my opinion, optimized for maximum tenderness and juiciness.  This was a \"bone-in\" cut with allot of fat and gristle.  So yeah, the dull steak knife came back to haunt me again.  Once I performed surgery on that bad-boy, I was left with about a 14 oz steak - which is really more than enough.  The meat had a decent flavor and was relatively tender (the dull knives not allowing for very small pieces) so it was OK.  Cooked to order, and seared just right on the outside.\n\nBut \"OK\" is the problem.  Bob's has a nice location in the Omni Hotel downtown (\"A\" for the after-work crowd), decent setting (B) and good service (B+) but it all goes straight downhill from there.  The bread/appetizers (B-), sides (C-) and Steak (C) were flat-out disappointing - especially for the value (D).  Our party of 4 had one round of drinks, one $45 generic bottle of Pinot, 2 apps, 2 sides and 4 steaks (from $30-41 ea) and we walked away for just under $400.  I don't consider myself a food-snob but I've \"been there, done that\" all over SF, NY, LA, etc - so I know what $400 should get a party of 4 and this was \"insult to injury\" on a grand scale.  \n\nTake your clients and/or your Dad/Friends elsewhere...no matter who is paying.  Harris' is your best bet for an upscale steakhouse, Izzys for casual and I'm not touching the Morton's/Ruth's debate with a 10-foot pole.

I highly recommend the bone-in ribeye for those of you complaining about lack of flavor or juice.  There's no better choice of meat than a ribeye for the marbling...and the bone helps seal in the juices as well.  Bob's has the best ribeye I've ever had.\n\nI think they need to do something about the atmosphere.  Bob's isn't the type of place that cares about something like that - they'd rather worry about the steaks.  But in San Francisco, it's a huge issue with foodies - especially Yelpers.  So while the plain decor is typical in it's home town (Dallas), you have to design a better interior for SF.  Cater to your audience, Bob...it's an obvious problem with these reviewers.\n\nBut...if I was in an alley eating his ribeye, I'd be happy...so I don't care about that stuff.

First, it was a flying nightmare with delays and layovers; however Bob's Steak and Chop House definitely saved the entire trip for me.  \n\nAfter flying out at 7am from Charlotte, NC, dashing to a conference in Palo Alto, I was beat and ready for some good pampering by the end of the day.  \n\nBoth my co-worker and I were determined to salvage our trip by treating ourselves to a night on the town in San Franciscio.  After a quick nap (i'm an East Coast girl, so at 6pm it felt like 9pm), my co worker and I headed into the city around 8:30pm.  It was a Thursday, so there was a lot of activity and people out and about.  \n\nNone of us really knew the SF area- and were in search of food.  We parked in the shopping district which was a mistake as all the shops were closed by the time we arrived. \n\nWe found a nice looking couple to ask for recommendations or directions for a nice place to eat.  Lucky for us, they were not tourists ,and were pretty enthusiastic about recommending places to eat.  \n\nI know the the SF area has some GREAT foodie places to eat, so the girl asks us what type of food we are looking for, as there were many many places she and her bf could recommend.  So my coworker blurts out: \"we want a nice steak dinner\".  The girl perks up and says she knows a FABULOUS place; Bob's Steak and Chop House, the restaurant in the Omni Shore Hotel, conveniently located a mere two blocks away.  \n\nOh, and by the way, she works there as a server.  So thank you so much Audrey for the great recommendation, and my coworker and I did end up having a fabulous meal. :)  \n\nBy the time we sat down to eat, it was around 9pm, and hardly anyone else was dining at that time of night.  We practically had the entire restauarant to ourselves.  Our waitress; Shelly was gregarious and friendly.  \n\nSo it's 9PM and I was ready for a glass of wine.  I ask for a recommendation on which Shiraz is the best, and was surprised when the sommelier didn't choose the priciest one on the list.  Matchbook Shiraz is pretty darn good (i even hunted it down here in DC).  \n\nConfession: this was the first time I actually had a fancy steak dinner in a fancy steak restaurant.  So I had to ask Shelly the difference between all the steaks ( iknow, shame on me).  however she was happy to give me a tutorial on steaks.  And I ended up getting the Porterhouse steak.  \n\nWhen my food came out, all I can say was that it was beautiful.  My steak was cooked perfectly; I had asked for it be done medium rare, and it was melt in your mouth bliss.  The sides were a spiced glazed carrot and mashed potatoes; each equally well executed.  At one point I was unsure whether to finish my steak or potatoes- they were both that good.  I opted to finish the meat.  \n\nBy the time we both finished our meals, we were happy enough to just go back to the hotel.", "author": "Jaemie D."}

Satisfying your in-laws who will eat at only 5 restaurants and are not adverse to following a waiter into the kitchen when they are no satisfied is an even more difficult task.  The last time my in-laws came to S.F. my wife and I took them out to dinner.  We agonized over where to take them at first.  They like two kinds of food: Chinese and steak.  My wife was terrified to take them to a Chinese place because they might walk faster than Jane Kim can piss me off.  That left us with steak.  We immediately said, \"Bobs\".  Why?  Because it's damn good.  \n\nLet's start with the pickles.  Pickles?  Yup pickles.  There is a jar of pickles on the table that Snooki was lose her poof over.  They're awesome.  Be careful not to eat too many.  My mothe-in-law ate two, and then brought some home. I should not spend so much time on pickles.  They're just evidence that everything at Bob's is great from start to finish.  Speaking of starters, the calamari is awesome.  Once again, don't eat too much or you'll ruin your dinner.  And dinner rocks.  Now, I don't eat steak, so my opinion may seem kinda meaningless.  However, I can comment on the fish.  I have said many times that steakhouses have the best fish.  Bob's may have the best steakhouse fish I have ever had.  So, my fellow sissies, if you love fish go to Bob's.  But I should give you a clue about what Bob's specializes in.  Steak.  My in-laws ate, and ate, and ate.  They did not look up.  They did not pause.  They did not say a word.  They focused on the task at hand.  This is the ulitmate compliment.  When my in laws eat everything in silence they are happy.  Go to Bob's and make yourself happy.", "author": "Chris I."}

With dinner we ordered a bottle of wine, Pinot Grigio.  I love my wine and enjoyed this bottle.  My 9 oz. (there are 3 choices of size) medium rare steak was another perfect addition to my meal.  I ordered the baked potato.. but next time I'm gonna opt for the smashed, not mashed but smashed, potatoes.  I don't get the deal with the extremely large carrots served with each entree.. but it was tasty too with an apple cinnamon flavor.  \n\nThe service was perfect as well.

The service was so good in fact, that I couldn't recall how many glasses of wine I had, because he was the one keeping our glasses full.  \n\nIt was a quiet place for a Sunday, but I guess that whole area is just quiet on Sundays and I have no complaints with quiet in the city :)", "author": "Michelle N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-25", "description": "There's just one word to describe Bob's Steak & Chop House: AMAZING! Now, amazing is a word that I do not throw around lightly. It's usually reserved for a select few things, such as hitting a 5-team NFL parlay in Vegas or Amy Adams' tits in The Fighter. But my friends, the food at Bob's is just truly that: amazing.\n\nThe boss & I checked out Bob's for our Christmas Eve dinner last night after bailing on the fam back in New York 'cause of the snow. We initially were supposed to spend a week in the Rotten Apple, but had to come home to SF as soon as Delta started cancelling flights on the East Coast. Alas, we had to cancel a reso at Quality Meats in Manhattan, which left me hankering for a big 'ol NY steak. We decided to try Bob's after seeing their ad in, of all places, US Airways magazine. They were mentioned in the same breath as David Burke's Primehouse in Chicago, so we figured we'd give it a shot.\n\nAnd boy, are we glad we did! We ordered the Smoked Salmon app, another NY staple that I didn't get to indulge in, 6 huge cuts of perfectly smoked salmon served with hard-boiled eggs, onions and toast points. The salmon was great, but the real stars of the show were still to come. I had the 16 oz. filet mignon with the baked potato. The steak was absolutely fantastic, cooked to a perfect medium-rare with a beautiful crust on the outside while staying fork-tender in the middle. It was honestly the best steak I've had in SF, hands down. The baked potato is served with sides of sour cream, bacon, chives, and shredded cheddar, so you can customize the topping level to your liking (I, of course, went all-in). Wifey had the nightly special, which was a 6 oz. filet with a blue cheese crust accompanied by a 6 oz. of Pacific Red Snapper with pesto and blue cheese mashed potatoes. Her filet was cooked as perfectly as mine, with the blue cheese crust adding a deeper, smokier flavor. The ol' lady LOVED her filet, but the snapper took her breath away. She is a pesto freak, and the pesto at Bob's is better than top-notch. For you pesto lovers out there, Bob's makes the most intense, flavorful pesto you'll find anywhere, which leant just the right amount of taste to the light, flaky fish. We also ordered a side of creamed spinach, which was perfectly thick and rich and topped with an awesome cheese crust. Trust me, the spinach is an absolute must!\n\nOf course, we split a banana-rum bread pudding for dessert. The banana flavor was omnipresent in the crumbly pudding, accented with caramelized bananas and golden raisins in a pool of banana-rum sauce. It was truly the perfect ending to a memorable meal. If you're looking for a real NY steakhouse experience, add Bob's to your list immediately!", "author": "Michael T."}

Couldn't even taste the blue cheese, probably strained chunks from a salad dressing jar. Fries were not cooked through and the onion ring batter had the mouth feel of velour. On top of that, the substituted rings were  $6 DOLLARS to sub (of course this wasn't mentioned by the server). The whole lunch, barring the $3 diet Coke and $3 iced tea, felt like it was summoned from either the frozen depths of the kitchen, or reheated rings and fries from earlier. Only upside, the pickles were good and the bartender and server were pleasant.

And we like it bloody - seriously, if we had our choice, we'd ask for it to be mooing.  \r\n\r\nWe've only been to Bob's twice.  But it's quickly becoming the top on our list, in terms of steakhouses.  \r\n\r\nAs for appetizers, the shrimp platter is a great appetizer to share among two or three people.  It comes cooked in three different styles, each one of them accentuating its own unique set of aromas, juicy flavors and textures in shrimp.  The crab cakes are  very nice (crispy on the outside) -  they're as good as the ones at Tadich Grill (on California street).  \r\n\r\nThe bread that they serve at Bob's is always warm and fresh.  It comes in the shape of sourdough, but is sweet and soft (and slightly chewy) in the inside like French bread.  Highly addictive - you don't even need butter or sauces to eat it, but if you DO have sauces, you must indulge.  \r\n\r\nNow... on to the meat.\r\n\r\nThe first time we went, I ordered the 9 oz filet mignon, which was cooked to perfection.  It was tender, juicy, and delightfully tasty.  My hubby ordered the rack of lamb, which was juicy, favorful and moderately gamey (we like it gamey).   We would recommend trying it with the mint jelly, just to add to the taste and texture.\r\n\r\nThe second time we went, we graduated to the 20 oz. Prime \"Cote de Boeuf,\" as recommended by our waiter.  It was juicy and tasty, but we prefered the filet mignon.  \r\n\r\nThe glazed carrot which accompanies the meal is prepared with a nice spicy flavor and the skillet fried potatoes topped with sauteed onions and peppercorn gravy are decadent and smooth.\r\n\r\nThe portions are BIG, so be prepared to fill your stomach in its entirety (or to take home some leftovers).

Prices were $10 higher per plate than the value. The premium is due to it being essentially a hotel restaurant- connected to the omni, and I'm sure the prices are propped up by people on expense accounts. There is no steak house ambiance or any ambiace for that matter, much less any other reason that would be deserved of the premium prices. I think given the choice I would prefer one of the larger chain prime steak houses, which is something I don't say often. Too bad. There are just too many better places to go in SF (however poor the options in the fin district may be). Again, nothing wrong with the food, it's just not a premium steak house.

We started off with one of the only ways to start a steak dinner with friends, with a nice cold martini which I must say hit the spot. My friend brought a killer bottle of wine so they took it for us to open it up and wait for us to begin the feast. They seated us in a small private room with a booth and gave us a very friendly waiter named George who was on top of it all night long. My friends were very hungry and ready to make me pay so we started with the shrimp appetizer, very good, a total of six shrimp prepared three ways, a little pricey for what you get however it was very yummy. Then onto the chop salad and the tomato salad both of which were also very delicious and in this case very decent portions for the three of us to share. \n\nNow it was it was time to start the feast and that is what we did, all three of us ordered the COTE de BOEUF which is their special 22 ounce bone in rib eye steak which was prepared as close to perfect as I could expect, not too fatty however the bone leaves it with great flavor! Of course my friends were going to order it up since I was paying so they also ordered two lobster tails that were ask for price and very very expensive yet very very good! We also went with the smashed potatoes which was a hard choice over the baked potato and the creamed spinach which I would have to say was my least favorite thing of the meal. We topped it off with some dessert wine which I was in the bathroom when my friend ordered so I am not sure what it was however all three were nice choices. \n\nEven with picking up this rather expensive bill, I must say the look on my friends faces and the pleasure I got to enjoy while eating this food and being waited on by George and his funny personality that I walked away a very happy man.", "author": "Bobby B."}

They carry this thinking out with the best ingredients and fixings money can buy which makes this a good value at the relatively high price they ask for their premium burger. The meat is a generous, hand formed thick, round patty charbroiled or grilled to order, plated on white china and served with chilled fresh lettuce, tomato and onions, a spear of good pickle and a choice of high quality fries, salad or slaw.  Service is as it should be in a five star hotel that charges a premium for their food and ambience and the staff are attentive to details, large and small.\n\nThe fries here are worth noting as are the onion rings, and like I said it brings meaning to the phrase stolen by one of the fast food burger chains when they advertise their 'Whopper' which is a whisper compared to this huge offering.

We went here on the recommendation of a prior dinner my fiance attended at this establishment.  He kept saying the chicken he had was good & prices were reasonable.  We sat down and ordered some drinks and awaited our server.  I peered down and nothing was priced below 29.99 for the entrees.  The 29.99 options were the pork chops, and some fish item.  Steaks started at 31.99.  No chicken on this menu! HA HA  We split a salad which was good, and huge plenty for two.  Then we each ordered the rib-eye which came with your choice of potato and honey glazed carrot.  The rib eye was good - but 30+ dollars good - questionable.  The Carrot totally freaked me out. A whole carrot peeled and glazed sitting on my plate.   I had a hard time eating it... why can't they cut the carrots up? One big Carrot (and by big I mean a road divider between your meat and potato) on your plate is not appealing.  The Baked Potato was like another other - expect the server came around with a caddy with sour cream, onion, bacon and cheese.  A fancy way to dress a potato - maybe this is why a rib-eye was 31.99??  OK and one last comment - what the heck is up with the jars of pickles and stuff in the middle of the table with tongs? It's SO weird.....  I didn't see a single person eating a pickle.... we opened the jar and closed it.  No thanks.  Our server was very nice & service was quick.  We didn't even have a reservation and they sat us right away.  The food was decent - the 3 stars is for the cost - a bit pricey for what it really is.

I've tried the huge 39 oz porterhouse and lamp chops on different occasions and both were consistent in quality and preparation.  It's one of my favorite chophouses in San Francisco and the state.", "author": "Foodie B."}

Their salad was soggy and the dressing tasted like bottled dressing.  The steak was ok.. I mean, how can you go wrong with steak. It's either cooked the way you like it  or not.  I tried their countryfried steak for a luncheon and it's like diner food.  I wouldn't recommend this place.  It looks busy because it's in the heart of the financial district.  Food is blah.", "author": "Cj P."}

In general, I'm not a huge fan of hotel restaurants and I dunno if I've ever been to a hotel steakhouse outside of Vegas so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was very pleasantly surprised by my experience at Bob's.  As I was sitting at the bar, waiting for my friend, I discovered that they had Chimay on tap, which was a no-brainer for me.  I also had a well-made Belvedere Martini later in the night.  Since we were sitting at the bar, I was worried that we wouldn't be able to order from the full dining room menu but that wasn't a problem.  I chose the the 18 ounce Kansas City Strip.  It was a great piece of meat - very flavorful and moist and cooked to my specification of medium-rare.  My friend enjoyed his NY Strip too.  Although the steaks are pricey, they aren't out of line with what you'll pay at other top steakhouses in SF.  Plus they come with a choice of potato.  For whatever reason, all steaks also come with this gigantic carrot in the center of the plate which can't be substituted for anything else.  It occupies a good chunk of the plate and I was very tempted to remove it from my plate and throw it on the counter.   Also, the list of wines by the glass wasn't great.  However, other than these minor shortcomings, I had a great experience at Bob's.  I would definitely come back.", "author": "Saw T."}

It came highly recommended. I was hungry for dinner so I opted for an appetizer and some drinks. I had the crab cakes, I don't think they were that good, lots, of crab, but not exactly what I was looking for. They say Maryland style, but only Maryland does them Maryland style with luscious lumps of whole crab meat. Sigh, so that was a tad disappointing. Had a dirty martini and a glass of wine. I am NEVER going to do my world wide tour if I have keep having nights like this. Umm.  I think for what it was the price was moderate like 40 bucks. Maybe I have been living in the bay too long. Who knows! Gorgeous place, EXCELLENT SERVICE. Friendly, attentive and unfailingly polite. Dude you feel like a celeb or something. I was seriously sitting there thinking this must be how the other half lives. People going out of their way to make you happy. It made me vow to work harder on this damn LSAT, I want to be the top 10 percent. Nice looking older white men (all married), a good looking brit my age. Of course, you have the trash coming out for a night trying to shake off the dust from the trailer park, but hey, who am I to judge. I had a great time and the hotel offers wi-fi which extends to the restaurant. Next time I am getting the damn porterhouse, cause I'm worth it.", "author": "Jocelyn F."}

We were seated in a dark, dungeon-like corner by the entrance. The young lady who seated us didn't even offer us a candle or lamp since the lighting was so, so dim. Our waiter was excellent, polite, attentive and the busboys were always checking for empty water glasses and empty plates to clear. Food was decent but small with a large price tag to boot. I didn't think a 9 oz. steak should set me back $47 and a scotch on the rocks almost $13. Our bill was almost $150 for two plates, two drinks and a coffee. A fortune! I naively believed that my being dressed to kill would've merited a better table, but no such luck. I glanced out of our dark \"cubicle\" to see guys in Hawaiian shirts and ultra casual attire seated at prime locations. Something was totally wrong with that picture. When I was looking for the bathroom, some guy in the reception area whistled at me and thumbed me in the direction I should walk to. Whistling at a man in a suit and tie? I thought that was reserved for hippies or the homeless. The BEST experience that evening was my wife and i being together on a long deserved date. Next time I think we'll go to our usual haunt: Houston's on the Embarcadero. Bigger portions, lower prices and an actual view...of people and scenery.", "author": "Al S."}

Perhaps I shouldn't have cuz most folks think it's pretty average and/or over-priced, so I was skeptical going into it.  Well, as usual, my fellow yelpsters were right on the mark.  I had the Sirloin steak, and it was delicious, but $50 when all you get is a carrot?  And what's up with the pickles and bell peppers as the free appetizer?  The house Cabernet was very good though.  I went on a Wednesday, so I assumed that the patrons would be old, grizzly, wealthy folk that were quiet and unassuming.  Wrong there.  There was 2-3 pretty boisterous groups that made it hard to hear the conversation at our table.  Made me wish I was with them!  I'm glad I went to check it off the list, but I wouldn't necessarily go back since it's rather expensive for what you get.  For my money, I'd prefer House of Prime Rib, or even Izzy's.....", "author": "Scott G."}

The steaks were good, very tender and juicy, but the carrot and potatoes were the best part of the meal, and IMO if you are a steak house you better make your steaks the best part of a meal.  For $40-50 a plate, I just expected a little more I guess.  Service was attentive, but a bit stiff.  Casual atmosphere was nice, and the bar seemed to be pretty lively.", "author": "James S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-01-08", "description": "Just OK. I'd read the reviews here and thought this would be perfect for a birthday dinner. We were sat in a tiny room off of the main dining room, not even music. Although our waitress was very nice, it really felt like we were a distant second priority. We waited 15  minutes before anyone came to our table, we had to ask for water, and 15-20 minutes between courses without so much as a busboy coming by. I worked in restaurants in NYC for 5 years, the restaurant wasn't busy enough to warrant this neglect. The food was only warm when we got it, presentation wasn't anything near the level the prices would normally command -  warm steak, potato, meager portion of veggies, all lost on this big white plate. Nothing like the photos.  I hope couple who goes there has a better experience for $189.", "author": "Chris D."}
