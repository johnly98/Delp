My husband had the coconut chia pudding bowl which he loved (it actually inspired me to make some once we got home) and I went with the veggie avocado toast. The toast was delicious (avocado with some chopped onions, tomatoes, and cucumber) but it was definitely a smaller portion than I expected. Which was fine. I just wish I had ordered something else since I was about to get on a 5 hour plane and wouldn't be landing until 9pm local time, so wanted to something that would last me for the day. The fella next to me had the bagel sandwich and that was the direction I should have gone for sure. It looked awesome. I'd definitely do the toast again, but maybe as fuel for a long day I'd go with something more hearty. \n\nI also got the cold brew coffee which was fantastic.\n\nSeating is limited so we had to share the big hightop communal table with a few other patrons and it was fine.", "author": "Annette J."}

My back-up plan is to come here when Saint Frank on the next block is too full up which is quite often on Saturdays. That place can get crazy-busy where getting coffee to go is your only viable option since the laptoppers have taken over all the available tables. So then where do you go? I guess down Polk Street to Aquatic Park at which point you've already emptied out the cup. That's when I realized I needed a Plan B, and the Fueling Station is my Plan B. It doesn't feel nearly as harried or crowded as Saint Frank even though the leftover laptoppers appear to spill over here.\n\nWith a bit of a Vietnamese twist, this is more of a family-run cafe since they serve actual food here, a quirky hodgepodge of salads, waffles and banh mi sandwiches, but the coffee and tea still appear to be the main focus and what most customers order. I went with a $3.25 Iced Green Tea (photo: http://bit.ly/2eOxIqt) and was able to secure a table without incident as I was waiting for Jamie W. to arrive.

It's not a place for exotic coffee or housemade pastries, but as a result, the prices can't be beat, and I never spend over $10 for breakfast. The lattes are just perfect on cold mornings. Love the banh mi and quiches as well. The caf\u00e9 itself has plenty of seating options and loads of power outlets, so you can spend some time here. \n\nMy favorite aspect of Fueling Station is the staff--every time I come in, they are so incredibly sweet and friendly.

In an area that offers either sit down service or strictly coffee, this place feels, smells, and tastes like you are in your best friend's kitchen. Lillian, the owner, welcomes you in as if you were in her home every morning. The coffee is Contraband and the food is delicious. \n\nOk, once you've had your coffee fix, try her Amish Lemonade. It's amazing. The menu speaks for itself but if you're feeling a bit sweet & a bit savory, just tell her. The things this woman does with waffles will have you running back for a refuel in no time. My favorite is the caprese waffle with a poached egg on top. \n\nDon't think too hard about it. Just stop by, say hello, and fuel up.
