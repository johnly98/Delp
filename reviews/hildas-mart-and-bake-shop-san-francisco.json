I found this place through a Yelp search for Filipino bakeries in the city cause you know I'm all about that u-Bae-by life as of late  until now I've frequented bakeries in Daly City and South SF but haven't found much ube options in the city.\n\nI finally made a excuse to be in the area on a weekday afternoon. I lucked out on residential parking but I don't expect parking to always be this convenient. \n\nWhen I arrive the staff a middle age woman working the store was very pleasant. She answered all my questions and basically allowed me to fanboy with enthusiasm as I vented out my tecent obsession for ube. \n\nThey are well known for their Mong Hopia (crispy shells with mung bean filling) but unfortunately they don't make Ube Hopia \nIt baffles me they don't make Ube Hopia given Ube's large popularity with Filipinos and non-filipinos.

Ranging from rice cakes (puto, kutsinta, and) to their famous sweet mung bean paste filled pastry (hopia). The bake shop is tucked within a residential area, so parking is limited. When walking in, it's more of a grab-n-go kind of place. \n\nThe hopias are freshly made. Each hopia comes in a tiny cupcake wrapper.  The outer layer is flaky and delicate, the sweet, slightly thick mung bean paste stays in tact with each bite. It pairs well with a hot cup of tea or coffee. Have it for breakfast, dessert, or your next gathering! I always find myself eating a few in one sitting! \n\nOnto the rice cakes, puto (rice cake) is white, fluffy and has a slight buttery taste to it. It also resembles a mini muffin. Kutsinta is orange and more on the sticky side. It is firm, jelly-like, but has a soft and gummy texture. \n\nAlso they start running out of fresh hopia around early-mid afternoon, so it's recommended to call in advance and make a reservation of the quantity of hopia you would like to guarantee you won't leave Hilda's empty handed!", "author": "Cindy C."}

It said it will on right side, but it's actually on a corner on the left side.  Parking frenzy was evident. Customers were double parked while driver stayed in car. What pissed me off was customers who got their order, stayed in parking space while others, including us, would drive down all street. This black SUV got order (saw the pink box and only business in this 'hood) and sat on her drivers seat while she ate her buy. UGGG come on people,  get your order and LEAVE, to free up a \"legal\" parking space.\n\nAnyways, I'm not a hopia fan. But if you like it, you'll probably love it. However if you don't, it might change your mind from store bought processed packages from Asian stores.  It was good as it was flaky and soft. They only have one kind-yellow (bean) filling.   Since I tried a steamed rice dough ball, a few years ago  that puto was sour and off putting.  But Hilda's puto changed my mind. It just taste like a steam rice ball. My friend said I probably tasted a spoiled one as it was super sour to me years ago.\n\nService was not friendly, but the flow was smooth and consistent. Basically say your order, get your order and get the heck out of dodge. \nIt seems if you speak the lingo, your treated s bit friendly. Just saying. \n\nI'd probably have someone buy some, but have no interest finding no parking. Business should consider parking if they get a second location.

Unlike some mongo hopia whose center is so dry that it literally comes apart after you bite into it, this hopia stays intact! The mongo stays somewhat gooey and the outside is so flaky. I recently went back when visiting friends and bought a dozen to take home to my mom. She didn't say it was the best she's had but she did say it was almost like the hopia in the Philippines and the best she's had in the states! \n\nThey also sell other Filipino desserts such as puto, cassava cake, leche flan, etc. I would have given this place a 5/5 but damn, I can't get past the rudeness of the girl on the phone when I called to make sure they still had hopia left.

I have been eagerly wanting to try their hopia because we're a big fan of hopia. Whenever we're in San Diego, we go to the famous hopia store there and buy dozens to bring home to our family. We were hoping it would be the same case for this place... Unfortunately, the taste of the hopia didn't live up to its hype.\n\nThe customer service was bad, actually, more like terrible. When we arrived, there was a bell that goes on to alert people in the back that someone walked into their store. We could hear people from behind the wall and waited for God knows how long. We waited patiently and in fact, my fianc\u00e9 went in and out of the store so the bell would ring again in case they didn't hear us the first time. One woman came out, said hello and disappeared. We thought she was about to help us but she never came back.  She didn't say anything along the lines of \"I will be right with you.\" Nothing about \"Sorry, we know you're here, but give us a few moments because we're busy.\" She popped out of nowhere and disappeared.\n\nAnother customer arrived and waited 5 minutes before asking us if we've been served. When we told her no we haven't been served, she said, \"oh yeah. I come here all the time and customer service is pretty bad.\" I finally got tired of waiting and called out because it didn't look like anyone was coming out anytime soon.\n\nWe were hoping the hopia would make up for the unsatisfactory customer service experience, but it wasn't good.  It had a nice texture but it lacked flavor. I'm thankful we only bought one hopia for 90cents to sample. We were planning on ordering dozens if we liked it. I'm glad I finally got to satisfy my curiosity for their hopia and we don't expect to come back either.\n\nSorry, but this place isn't for us.", "author": "JD W."}

Get it together people lol). Yes you read that right, UBE PUTO.  One of the best ever too! They don't get hard like other putos after only a day sitting out.  It stays soft and squishy and they give you some fresh grated coconut to put on it, OMG drooling thinking about it .\n\nAnd kutsinta yum!!! get that too! The round orange dessert found at most Filipino parties also served with fresh grated coconut.\n\nI've heard their dinuguaan (\"chocolate\" meat aka pigs blood stew) is hella good too, but I have yet to try it.  But hopias, ube putos and kutsintas oh my!  Those are my go tos.  The last time though, they had fresh Karioka (deep fried rice flour balls coated in sugary syrup) and I couldn't get one because I had already bought a 50 count of hopia ( I got a big family) \nand a 25 count of ube puto. \n\nBut if you're coming on the weekends, call ahead and get your order on.

They have other assorted desserts as well; their specialty is the regular white puto or ube puto, along w/other Filipino desserts. The only drawback is street parking, you have to keep driving back & forth to find parking. Another thing, they do not accept cheques or credit card; payment must be CASH only.", "author": "Cris M."}

Located in what feels like a residential area of SF I searched for parking and prayed that Hilda would not let me down as I crossed the bay in search of an ube flavored puto. \n\nYou see, I will drive miles for anything ube. \n\nThey were out of hopia :(  but somehow I left with half a dozen of the ube puto ($5) and a sheet of maja blanco ($15). Ube was kind of light and airy, and very light sweet taste. Maja blanco is coconut crack. Flan's tropical cousin is sold to you with toasted coconut to sprinkle over it. ((love that))\n\nNot sure if on Sunday they make less goodies as the display case was kind of bare. I was hoping to find leche puto, alas another day.

Of course, not having tried either before, I had no baseline to compare them to, but, as a standalone pastry, the hopia was super tasty, and somewhat reminiscent of Chinese pastries: almost a cross between suncake, old wives cake, and mooncake. \n\nThe puto, on the other hand, was not nearly as in-your-face flavor wise. Very subtly sweet from the rice used, and super sticky, I only later found out that it's traditionally eaten with things like sugar, or other additional flavorings. Not bad, and reminiscent of Chinese fa gao, though I much prefer the latter. \n\nAnd, if it makes any difference my Filipino friend said both were pretty good and rather authentic, though the puto was much stickier than any she's had in the past.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Not accessible at all, given the two steps at the front entrance. The surrounding area is also rather hilly. That said, since the shop is pretty small, and the front door faces the counter, you can just tell them what you'd like from there, and have them bring it out to you. This DOES mean you need to have an idea beforehand of what you want, since you won't really be able to browse.\n\nBathroom - No idea, given the above, but they're unlikely to have public ones.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Kinda like a fat kid that loves cake, I'm a skinny kid that loves rice cake! Mochi, tteok, puto -- I love rice cake from all cultures. Thanks to Yelp, I found out about this bakery and it was like a blessing from the rice gods! It's definitely one of my new favorite bakeries where you can find fresh, uncommon, ooey-gooey baked goods.\n\nThere are SO many rice cakes to choose from at Hilda's!! There's so much here to try that I don't understand why people just get the puto/kuchinta/hopia. Here are some of my favorites you can get here: \n\n- Puto, a round ball of rice cake that is one of the most popular of Filipino desserts. A touch of salt balances the flavor nicely. You can get it in plain white or other flavors.\n\n- Kuchinta, an orange, UFO-disc shaped little rice cake. Has a mild banana/pandan leaf taste. Also very popular.\n\n- Sapin-sapin, a yellow and purple layered rice cake that is a sticky and sweet hot mess! One of my favorites!\n\n- Biko, a piece of sticky rice that is coated with a layer of syrup on top, toffee I believe. This IS SO GOOD, it's so soft and moist! This is probably my favorite by far and is a must buy when you visit Hilda's.\n\n- Maja Blanca, A sort of pudding made with coconut milk, corn starch, sugar, and bits of corn. Topped off with toasted coconut. It's a popular dessert made at home by many of my Filipino friends. It's very filling!\n\nIf you don't see anything at the counter you like, you can ask for for what you want and they will pack up your order. The woman who works there is really nice too!\n\nThe area surrounding Hilda's is quite notorious, with muggings and even shootings happening close by. I've never been a victim or witness of any crime and this neighborhood is filled with working class families, so I don't expect to encounter anything awful. Just in case though, grab your rice cakes and don't look anyone in the eye!", "author": "Enari L."}

Because no matter how good your hopia is, if you have clientele who are not local, you have to deliver more than just taste to keep them coming back. I'm one who does not worry about going out of my way or paying a little extra, but I would also favor exceptional customer service over great taste. 'Coz really, we're talking hopia...there are a lot better things in life than hopia so let's get real here. \n\nIf you show up without pre-ordering, you would've just wasted your gas & time because you would likely go home with nothing. If you forget to bring cash only, be prepared to drive around looking for an ATM. When you do get there, expect no parking...bring someone else who could drive around while you finish your transaction or risk having one of neighbors threatening to have your car towed even if you promise to take no longer than 5 minutes. If you do decide to call ahead, might as well go there in person and be prepared to come back the next day. Because if you are unfortunate enough to actually have someone answer your call, they would gladly put you on hold and conveniently forget about you. Then they will leave the receiver off hook so that you and everyone else will forever get a busy signal. Kind of smart really...they don't want to deal with your complaints after they piss you off.\n\nI can't imagine a place doing such great business making its owner millions selling hopia that they are willing to lose customers over such poor phone etiquette & lousy service. Lots of luck to the owner 'coz the only way you're gonna have me eating your hopia again is if someone else gives them to me for free...would not spend my own money or  put myself through the frustration of having to deal with the incompetent staff.", "author": "Ruth A."}

But, if you actually go inside, it is super clean, the staff is super friendly (once they come out of the back room and wait on you) and the treats are the best in the Bay Area.  The lady who served us was very conscientious about packing the treats, so that the ones with toppings would not get squished and the warm ones were positioned in some particular way (very grandmotherly - there clearly is a right way to pack them!).  Taste-wise, we have tried other top contenders and Hilda's blows them out of the water.  Really awesome.  Thanks!  As a tip, make sure to ask for the treats you want, even if not in the display case.  They often have more in the back that just haven't been put out yet.

Bonus star for the obscurity.\n\nSince I'm utterly clueless about Filipino desserts (this is one cuisine that has definitely not crossed into SWPL territory yet), I just went in and repeated the 3 magic Yelp-words over and over: Puto Kutchinta Hopia.  I had no idea what they meant, only that much deliciousness would ensue.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Hopia is definitely the most glamorous of the 3, being a Baklava-esque flaky pastry filled with sweet bean paste.  The puto are just sticky balls of sweet rice, and the kutchinta are orange-colored wafers of chewy rice goo (like the tteok you get at Korean places).

I've read some of the negative reviews on here and for the most part people are absolutely telling the truth. The customer service isn't great (standard Asian establishment customer service), and the location makes it a pain to find parking. Also, the cash-only thing is pretty standard in SF but the good news is there are several ATMs on Mission which is 2 blocks away. I've seen them turn large orders away because the customer didn't order in advance and Hilda's didn't have enough inventory to fulfill the order. Despite all of that, the items here are very good. I think if you abide by their rules (make larger orders in advance, bring cash, and prepare to drive around a bit to find parking) you are in for a tasty treat, especially if you've got a taste for phillipino baked goods.", "author": "Ken C."}

There were 3 of us waiting and one lady was knocking on the door since they were supposed to be open at 9:00am on Sundays.  After almost an hour a lady with a bad attitude opened the gate.  We felt like it was such a big burden for her to open the gates.  They only had a few packages of cuchinta available.  Asked her if they had any puto, she said none and they're closing because they had to go somewhere.  So she was rushing us to go and leave.  Asked what time they'll be open again she said she didn't know maybe around 1:00pm.  Asked if they were going to have puto she said just come back maybe they'll have but maybe they won't.  While I was talking to her she would walk in and out towards the kitchen.  Can she be more friendly than this?  I've been to this place a few times and have encountered this woman with such bad attitude so unfriendly.  Why do they put people in the counter that seem to not like their job?
