Cheap drinks, TV's, bar food, and a lot of games like beer pong, pool, shuffle board, pop a shot.. etc. Good also as a warm up bar. A good place to meet and have 2 or 3 before hitting your main spot.\nBy default I come here a lot. I just don't want to spend $5 for a Budweiser/ Bud Light.  Some domestic beer prices for comparison:\nPerry's $5.25 (12 oz bottle)\nBus Stop $5.50 (14 oz draft)\nHorseshoe $5.00 (14 oz draft, $3 on Sunday)\nDel Mar $6.00 (12 oz bottle... all beers are $6, so stupid)\nBlue Light $4.50 for 16oz bottle or a draft (honorable mention)\nMonaghan's $4 for 16 oz can (not bad if you pour it in a glass)\nBAR NONE $4 for 16 oz draft or 24 oz can. \n\nNow I understand why some high end restaurants or wine bars charge $7. The rent is high, the remodel of the space was expensive, the ambiance is very nice.. i get it. BUT when you just want a few beers with the boys and don't care about food or the wine list, I'm not paying $6.\n\nI won't get into all of the bars/restaurants that do not offer \"normal\" \"domestic\" beers but only fruity $7 IPA's and if you're lucky a Stella. If it's a restaurant I actually get sparkling water if there is nothing I want. Took me years to do it but I like it. SF is expensive but you can still save a few bucks if you try.

Everywhere I had been had seemed a little more upscale than what I was used to at home. I welcomed that glitz into my trip there. My best partying buddy from all of my college years invited me out to Bar None with him on my last night in San Francisco and I am pretty glad I didn't pass it up. \n\nThe clientele and vibe here is young, fresh out of college, and packed. I hadn't had an experience like this since I was a fresh faced grad myself. The bar area is of ample size, but on a Saturday night, it was packed Wall to Wall. The place is a little dark with uplighting. The bartenders are fairly attentive despite the packed place.  \n\nThe main attraction here is the frat party style games the tables are set up for in the back. Beer Pong, flip cup, and my personal favorite, Boom Cup, are all available. I was the lone 30 something among a bunch of twenty one year olds slapping cups and yelling at newly made friends. I had a ball and wished I had a place like this in Louisville when I was younger. \n\nI would suggest this place if you like a young dive bar.

I prefer bars that treat their patrons as humans. \nA group of friends and I were in the back playing games at 1:40am and we had just bought a new pitcher of beer a few minutes earlier. Suddenly, out of the blue, a big burly bouncer came and informed us, along with the others in the back of the bar, that the bar was now closed and we had to immediately make our way to the front. There had been no last call, not even a warning as we purchased the pitcher. We made our way towards the front, thinking that perhaps the bouncer had meant that the back of the bar was closed and we could just hang out at the front of the bar for the last 15-20 minutes that the bar was to be open, according to their posted hours. Apparently not. A minute later, the bouncer came over again and told us that we had to leave at that very moment. I still had about a third of a glass of beer left, so I asked if I could have just a minute to finish my drink as I stood near the door. Instead, the bouncer pushed me, PHYSICALLY PUSHED me out the door.  This whole exchange, from when the bouncer told us we had to leave the back of the bar, to when I was pushed out, couldn't have been more than 3 minutes. That is a ridiculously short period of time to expect to clear out a bar, let alone for any group to finish a pitcher of beer. Being physically pushed by the bouncer was very upsetting, and I do not understand why Bar None allows their employees to treat patrons in such a degrading manner.", "author": "Elizabeth B."}

Located right off Union street, Bar None is set almost in an underground tunnel.  Walking in, we were immediately greeted by the door guy who checked our IDs and started a friendly chat with us. Bar None has a long bar with around 10 beers on tap (standard selection of Lagunitas IPA, Shock Top, Stella, etc) as well as full liquor to choose from.  All the way in the back you can find air hockey, skee ball, pool tables, and random arcade games.  My fianc\u00e9 and I grabbed some beers and set up for a few games of air hockey. Just leave your ID with the bartender and in exchange you get the paddles. Also, there is a change machine located in the back for convenience.  When I first spotted my all-time favorite Skee Ball I jumped at the chance to play, however the bill machine was stuck. The awesome friendly bartender quickly jumped from behind the bar to come help me out.  Apparently some idiots in this place tend to stick quarters in the dollar bill slot causing it to get jammed... the bartender helped us out removing the coins and even giving us a dollar for a free play (thank you!) \nIn all, this is a great gem of a dive bar located among the high end bougie bars of the Marina.

Vibe: Very crowded and very fratty - lots of Southern Tide and visors. \n2. Drinks: Nothing fancy - a selection similar to a college house party. Beer is super cheap (which is nice for the amount of BP that goes down).\n3. Bar: Slow, and a bit understaffed. We waited 10+ minutes to get a pitcher of beer. \n4. Location: Fairly central, close to nice eateries, shops, and other bars. \n5. Amenities: Pool, air hockey, skee-ball machines, darts, and 4 or 5 BP tables (though the wait is pretty ridiculous).\n6.

And super cramped and dirty :( As you walk further into the bar, they have a foosbal table, beer pong (pretty cool - but I honestly wouldn't want to play with the cups they recycle and the ball that rolls around the sticky-ass floor...), basketball, air hockey (you'll need to trade in your ID for the puck and the thing to hit it with - if you don't return it, you'll be charged!) and other arcade games - pretty neat. When you check in, you'll also get $3 wells! But I think that's already their standard pricing, hahaha.\n\nThis place basically reminds me of a college party...

If not, you should have.\n\nSmack dab in the middle of Union St., this place is drowning in beer (literally) and filled with arcade games, think skee ball, foosball, pool, and even one of those boxing things, and of course, BEER PONG! That's what all the college kids come here for, right?\n\nThe scene: ridiculously sticky floors (my shoe literally was stuck to the ground so much it came off throughout the night), spilled beer everywhere, frat boys responsible for spilling the beer everywhere, girls way too dressed up for such a gross bar and potentially also contributing to the beer floors, and all the general rowdiness and tomfoolery you would expect. \n\nProbably nothing about this place is actually a positive, but it does what it sets out to do well, (create a frat scene) and for that, it gets 4 stars.  \n\nQuick notes:\n-clean beer pong cups in the back of the beer pong pit. Please get new ones. Reusing other people's beer pong cups is gross. \n-bathrooms are disgusting, but also in the beer pong pit\n-last call is ~20 minutes before 2am and they start kicking out people aggressively. If you need to go to the bathroom, this is your last chance. Neither Bar None nor Bus Stop down the street will let you go back in after you are out.\n-No food around here after 2, but there is a hot dog man outside usually. $4 a hot dog.\n-surge pricing for uber, lyft, etc. in this area @2am for sure.

They will yell, curse, push you around and look for trouble. Just to mention one of the few things that happened: One customer hear my friend say a word in Spanish and turned around looked at us and said to his friend \"Oh no, I better get out of here. There are a bunch of Hispanics\". What is that? I was the only one of Spanish origin at the table, but we all felt very insulted.\n\nSTAFF: the bartenders are... ok (not dicks or nice) UNTIL 1:30am comes around. My friend purchased a pitcher of beer at around 1:20am. Not even 10mins had passed and the already-by-then drunk staff came over to our table yelling at the top of their lungs \"GET MOVING PEOPLE, WE ARE CLOSING, GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!\". One of the people I was with asked if we could finish the beer we had just purchased and the staff responded \"I GIVE YOU 1MIN THEN I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO TAKE YOU OUT MYSELF\".\n\nOur group, comprised of three girls and two guys, started walking to the door, completely in shock of what was happening. I decided to approach a bartender to ask him if this was normal and if that staff member was OK, he said \"YES, AND PLEASE GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE HE PUSHES YOU OUT\". So yeah... he was nice enough to give us a warning about two of their crazy staff members who were already grabbing people by the arm and pushing them towards the door.\n\nThis was truly the worst experience I have ever had. It was even scary at some point. Once outside (1:37am) the staff turned off the lights, got out and locked the doors. Zero cleaning people. One of the drunk, tall, bulky member of the staff who had been pushing people out just walked to his car, put up the music to the loudest and made a U-turn while speeding, coming close to hitting one of the customers who had just left the bar... maybe another scare tactic... I don't know... but he was a TOTAL ASS.\n\nMaybe this was just a one night thing... but I came out of there truly hating this place and I would NEVER, EVER recommend it to anyone in the world.", "author": "Tabata A."}

The place was pretty crowded - as expected on a Saturday - but I was still able to get a drink the minute I walked up to the bar. They had plenty of bartenders behind the bar so there was never a long line. I checked in on yelp and unlocked the \"$3 well drinks\" deal and got 2 vodka cranberries. The bartender gave me a token for a free drink that I used later in the night, so including tip I spent $10 on 3 drinks. That's a steal for a bar in the marina. \n\nTowards the back of the bar there are a few tables for beer pong, a pool table, a basketball arcade game (only $.50!), and skee-ball! \n\nWe were looking for a loud and rowdy bar with a college atmosphere and didn't care much about the cleanliness of the place.

Bar None is a great place to go to play drinking games. They have plenty of tables to play beer pong or flip cup. They have a pool table and other bar games. If you are into bar games, Bar None has the equipment to suit you.\n\nHowever, Bar None is one of the filthiest places you will ever visit. I'm not sure they ever clean anything.

The bathrooms look like they belong in the lowliest establishment in a third world country. That might even be an insult to third world countries. But, a person can get on fine with this level of care, as long as the staff is up to snuff.\n\nBar None hires men who have no thought except for the next opportunity to pound someones face, and closing time is the perfect place. Take a second too long to react to an order to vacate, and an employee will be in your face telling you to throw a punch. Doesn't matter if you are walking towards the exit, trying to leave, they will accost you as you exit. They want to fight. Bar None employees understand that as long as you throw the first punch, they are justified in beating you, and they want you to throw that first punch. They antagonize their late night patrons, looking for the fight that normally wouldn't happen. As you walk away, down the street, they scream after you to come back and show that you are a man. To them, you aren't one if you don't attack them.\n\nAt most bars you expect the bouncers to stop fights, here you should expect them to initiate or at least join in.

I wasn't thrilled with the idea of going because I've never really liked the crowd or how dark and dirty it is inside. However, my friends all wanted to go so I tagged along. Big mistake. \n\nThere were 3 bouncers at the door and almost everyone got in. One of my friends handed a bouncer his ID and the bouncer handed it back and said \"$5 dollars to get in\". Well the idea of paying to get into this place is laughable (and nobody else was asked to pay) so my friend thinks its a joke and laughs and tried to walk past him. The bouncer then placed his hands on my friend's neck and shoved him several steps away. The bouncer kept shouting that he was going to wring anyones neck that crossed him and that he would choke my friend. This scared most of the other people in line and they started to just hand the bouncers their IDs without making eye contact and without saying a word. Since everyone was so intimidated it reminded me of the episode of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld. Why, when there are so many better options, would you still enter this place where trash greets you at the door? \n\nIf you wonder what my friend did, he walked away to smoke a cigarette while I grabbed the rest of our group that got inside so we could leave. Bar None needs to provide their bouncers with proper training to prevent lawsuits for using excessive force. Why didn't we do something to get his guy in trouble? I keep asking myself the same question but I guess we were just shocked that my friend was singled out by some power hungry bouncer that was looking for trouble. The whole situation disgusts me.", "author": "Christina E."}

While I can understand Ligaya's hatred of this place on a higher level (we both went to colleges in *the* college town), I was actually ok with it's existence.  Here's why:\n\nFirst, it is cool to know that you can play official beer pong somewhere.   Sure, the guy pontificating about beer pong rules like it's the Magna Carta is annoying, but it just gives people like me a chance to use the term \"douche bag\"  more often in everyday conversation.\n\nSecond, Bar None is actually a much bigger bar than most marina bars, so maybe you can squeeze yourself into a meathead-free zone.  I was, in full disclosure, here at 1 in the afternoon and the crowd was pretty amped up even by early afternoon standards.  \n\nThird, they gave us rolling rock on tap for the beer pong.  I love Rolling Rock, much to the chagrin of my more cultured friends. \n\nLast, if you love tater tots (I do not), your $6 order of tater tots is huge.\n\nSo, in reading over my friends' reviews, I don't disagree with what they are saying.  I'm sure if I tried a Saturday night excursion into this place, I would be outta there in 5 minutes or less.

This is not a place I typically go to because of it's crowd and general extreme frattiness (even compared to other Marina bars).  \n\nThat being said, my friends and I picked BN for a pre-Final Four game watch venue because we really just wanted to play flip cup.  BN is the best place for such activities, and for this they get a full 3 stars.  Otherwise, I probably would not be caught dead here.\n\nThe Bar None folks are smart - beer pints are provided in plastic, not glass, cups and there's a stack of beer pong/flip cup cups available in the corner for you to grab at your leisure.\n\nPitchers of Bud Light are $14, which seems a little pricey to me but hey, when you have a group of roughly 20 people playing flip cup, that's what you do.  I do wish I had clorox wipes with me to clean the tables off before playing, but oh well.  The bathroom was surprisingly not terrible and accessible from both sides of the bar.\n\nFor the times I want to relive college shenanigans, I can think of no better place than Bar None to do so.

Well, it's SF so it should be mixed. Along with the looking for parking like playing darts in the dark, it's a typical joint that SF has to offer in the Marina area.\n\nFirst impression: dark, dingy, DIRTY.\n\nSecond impression: grenades, land-mines, beached whales with boots.\n\nThird impression: drunktards, douches and pricks.\n\nDress policy is addressed in this place's name: none - The fashion police would have a ball at this place. If there are guys who are looking for a place that does not regulate on dress shoes, dress shirts policy, this is the place to go.\n\nThis place has lighting issues. I'm not sure what type of ambiance they're trying to create about it's sure a fuglee one. For a place that has beer pong in the back, they're sure playing a lot of Lady Gaga, Ke$ha, and Beyonce. Should I be concerned?\n\nThe folks playing beer pong: you guys realize every time the ball drops on the ground, it's filthy right? It drops in the area near the bathroom hallway. And the bathrooms are disgusting and flooded. So you dummies are going to pick up that pong ball, play with it, get it in your beer cup then drink the beer? GROSS.\n\nTo the drunk idiot next to me: I don't care if you're drunk or pretending to be drunk, can you please not push me? Clearly there's hella room to stand around and have a good time. Have some courtesy and learn to respect people's personal space. This is California after all, prick.\n\nThe drinks at this spot were good. Mixed drinks were up to par. The beer seemed to be a hit with my group but considering it's all the same old on-tap offerings, it's not hard to please.\n\nI only came here at my group of friends' request. Otherwise, I rather not. It's a good spot if you don't mind the rude patrons, the stupid displays of peacocking and level-5 clingers trying to buy you drinks.", "author": "Stephanie N."}

I came here to watch the recently failed Niners game (so sad) and this was actually the second bar that we went to. The first one, which shall remain nameless for now, was WAY too crowded, so we tried out Bar None. Low and behold, there was plenty of room to watch the game, and several TV's strategically placed so that wherever you stand you have a good view.\n\nThe place got pretty crowded, but there was never a time I started to feel claustrophobic or had people pushing up against me. This place is much bigger on the inside than you would think looking from the outside, which is always a bonus.\n\nAs for the drinks, I don't know how my friend did it, but whenever we needed more, she would disappear for about a minute and return with pitchers of beer. Now, yes, you get some kudos automatically when you're a girl, but this was during one of the most popular football games in San Francisco, and the bar was packed. She definitely had mad skills and we never had to wait for more than a few minutes to get refills of our beer, which I don't know if I give credit to Bar None or to my friend for this.\n\nThe only thing I wish would have been different is to have more chairs in the back room. There were a few tables and chairs but a lot of empty space, they could have fit quite a few more chairs, especially along the back, so that more people could have had seats. But such is life, it's a bar, it's not expected, just would have been nice.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

So the reason why I hate this place is because of the racist shits that come here. My friends who are colored folk (we're brown and yellow people) were playing beer pong, having a good time. Then busloads of douchebags in retarded kickball t-shirts (both male & female) inundate the bar and think they own the joint. They try to kick my friends off their table \"just cause\". No, how about we leave when you beat us. Even though that's clearly fair they still whined and told on us to the manager, who even agreed that he can't just make us leave like that.\n\nSo thank god my friend is really good at beer pong because he killed every douchebag there. I've never been prouder of being Asian. I almost changed into my kimono and played a victory song on my lute. I don't know how he stayed so calm with these dumbasses accusing them of cheating every shot they made and with this one particular mindless steroid-injected freak yelling in their face every 5 minutes about some bullshit, because I was flipping my lid, cussing a girl out for wagging her finger in my friend's face, and wringing my hands with how much anxiety I felt at the possibility of losing to these assholes.\n\nMy friend's brother who had nothing to do with anything walks in later and immediately gets yelled at and told by a douchette that you and your friends shouldn't be allowed here for the next 3 months. He had no clue what she was talking about. We laugh about this now.\n\nAlso, amidst all the senseless yelling, they try sending over their one lapdog Asian ambassador to talk some sense into us but he just ends up barking in our faces like he's got something to prove. I could've vomited.\n\nI give this place 5 stars if you're the type to like bar fights because this place will give you a great reason to start one. Don't forget to invite me. These spoiled brats are all bark and no bite, cowards who deserve a good spanking.

Maybe it's the mix of stale beer and Bath & Body Works that assaults your nostrils as soon as you descend into the bar entrance. Maybe it's the lovable Polynesian bar back that fistbumps everyone, even after taking care of some bodily fluid left behind by one of the regulars. Maybe it's the trough style toilet that reminds me of the old days at Candlestick & the Oakland Colosseum. Whatever the reason, as I enter my fourth decade on this planet, I am still a regular here (and as of 12/25/10, I'm the Duke).\n\nOne of my favorite memories here: Fellow yelper Joe M. and I stopped by at 5pm on a whim for A game of beer pong (not beirut). One game turned into two, and two turned into five. Mind you, drinking games are not Joe M.'s area of strength so he ended up taking down 3+ of the five pitchers. By 7pm he was nice and saucy for his next event: a celebration for his buddy's third year of sobriety!!!\n\nEnjoy Bar None for what it is. Don't hate. It's frat-tastic.", "author": "Chris F."}

Strangely enough, there wasn't a single TV playing the niners...? Odd since they are a San Francisco team. I guess that just goes to show how transient this city is. But anyway, our bartender was SO nice. His name was Matt and he was more than accommodating, checking on us frequently and offering us a free shot here and there. He was so friendly and quite honestly, in a city with not very many overly friendly people, it was refreshing.

I actually met someone I dated for a few months at Bar None, and now I understand why you don't decide to date someone you meet at Bar None.\n\nThey were also uneducated on Bartab. I met the Bartab peeps at Mas Sake's anniversary party this year, signed up, and have been a user... so imagine my surprise when they had NO idea what the Bartab feature was. Too bad... not sure where the lack of meeting of the minds happened, but either the Bartab people need to lay it out better, or the management isn't relaying the message to the staff. I lost 2 Bartab credits... (my friend and I sent each other drinks on a Friday) and were told we couldn't use it on a Friday. Fail... it's the principle!", "author": "Kristin F."}

But such wasn't the case. \n\nThey offered a pretty decent amount of taps, which I was satisfied. What beer I was drinking, I honestly couldn't tell you. Usually I refer to the website to refresh my memory, but unfortunately, their draft list isn't posted on the website. You'll have to ask one of my lady friends for what beers I drank. After the 5th pint, it gets a little fuzzy. Playing cricket (darts) was fun. Some dude came over to our table and gallantly invited us to play beer pong with them, but we respectfully declined. I can't imagine playing beer pong in a public place - picturing the little cup filled with the ping pong rinse water with floaties of Lord know what. It makes me hurl just thinking about it. And no offense dude, but we want to hang out with each other without inviting other dudes into the mix. And just when I was thinking that in my head, my friend recognizes one of my dude friends from across the room: \"Hey...isn't that David?\" And of course, I had to say hi. I know what you're thinking. I stayed true to my word about it being a ladies night.\n\nI would come back again.

What? The staff sided with you...but you want to flame them? That tells me what I need to know about him/her. \nThere are several posts from people that love to play beer pong...but hate other ppl that play beer pong. My suggestion to those ppl? Stay home. \nTo the person that complained \"...it's always either too empty or too crowded.\" Are you freakin' kidding me? That one doesn't even make sense. \n\"It's too loud...on a Friday night\" *sigh* it's.too.loud....on.Friday.night. Stay home and read a book. \nI know some of you like to flame people/places for the hell of it, or rag a place to be funny and that's your right as an American but at least include an actual (and honest) review. \nI was staying with a friend that lived relatively nearby and we stopped in on successive nights. I'm a little older than the target demographic, but I had a really good time both nights. \nGranted, as the evenings progressed, it got more crowded. That's the way it works at pretty much every bar I've ever been too. \nI didn't actually play beer pong. It's not my thing. I watched several games each night, however.  There were some nice people, there were some that were a little annoying. There were a few people that got sloppy late in the evening, but the one's that stepped over the line were dealt with pretty quickly, I thought.\nThe drinks, were more than fair, as were the prices. The staff was friendly to everyone, save a few douchey kids that started trouble then tried \"it wasn't me\", \"do you know who my father is\" and \"you can't do that to me/kick me out/deny me entry,,,I know the law\". I was actually hoping the staff would throw a couple of them a proper beating, but I was disappointed. \nThe bottom line is, this place is what it is. Is it spotless? No. Is it a fancy or \"nice\" place? No.  Is it fun, absolutely.  Is the staff friendly? Yes, to me & everyone that I saw that wasn't being a jerk. Are the prices reasonable and the drinks stiff? Hell yes to both. \nI probably wouldn't be a regular, since I'm too old to get that drunk too often, but I would absolutely return for a great time.

We must have came on an off night because it was not busy at all. Lots of open space and plenty of tables in the back to chill out at. Apparently they used to have a beer pong table but they took it down so the room in the back is just an empty room. I wonder if that's the reason it wasn't busy in there. But anyways. We sit in the back by the pool table. We order up some beers. $4. Sweet. Now these are my types of prices. The bar is huge. Lots of stupid games one could play - darts, pool, video games...to keep you busy. \n\nWe actually meet these Marina people and they invite us to play drinking games with them. We do and they're actually cool people. I mean I don't want to pigeon hole everybody that lives in the Marina as not being cool but these people were really cool.

Be aware however that if a bar has beer pong, guys who play beer pong will be there too.  Don't get me wrong, i have enjoyed a good game at this bar, as well as many backyards, and many of my good friends play.  But with the good come the bad, and you cant choose who comes here.  I wouldn't be surprised if cans were crushed on foreheads, and holes were punched in walls just to see if they could do it.  I mean....this is the marina. I'm kind of a marina hater....don't take it personally if you live there.  Its a stereotype for a reason.\nIf you really want to play beer pong, you would be better off making your own table using wood, a net, and buy some cups.  You can choose your company this way, and probably do it for cheaper.  \n\n1 star for selling beer by the pitcher.  I always like bars that sell by the pitcher.

Every time, I am immediately reminded of the extent of how much this place sucks (Note: I chose the word 'suck' at this juncture because it highlights the intellect of the lame-wads that populate this place).\n\nI'm quite certain that on any given night Bar None boasts the highest population of post-college Frat Boys who still believe that the pinnacle of coolness is wearing a cheesy, sexual innuendo t-shirt (think anything sold on BustedTees.com) and a pair of aviators. 90% of this bar's patrons probably believe that Eddy Money's Take Me Home Tonight is the best song ever written. It would be shocking to find that anyone who frequents this bar doesn't have CollegeHumor.com as their default homepage. To put it quite bluntly, this bar is a hipster's nightmare. If you wear tapered jeans, avoid Bar None like the you avoid Lacoste.\n\nAdditionally, the bartenders, who attempt to maintain a cooler-than-thou aura, are quite mediocre at best. They actually served me tequila shots without lime - I'm pretty sure that's covered in the first day of bartending school in Bartending Lesson 1: Don't be an idiot.\n\nA small back area of the bar is dedicated to beer pong. This is convenient if you (1) have an IQ represented by a single digit number (2) are a freshman at any school with a ranked D1 college football team or (3) enjoy spending a majority of your night explaining elbow rules to Sigma Nus.\n\nThe Verdict: As far as I'm concerned, this bar succeeds in only one aspect: it has alcohol. I would not recommend attending this bar. If the imminent San Francisco quake hits tomorrow and God manifests his vengeance through destroying every bar aside from Bar None, buy yourself a case and drink at home.

As we stood outside contemplating going straight to Blue Light, we noticed Bar None.  It didn't seem too bad from outside, so we checked it out.\n\nOf course, Bar None is (in)famous for its beer pong, but it all takes place in a back corner, and you can easily ignore it if you wish.  To be honest, it looks like a fun game to me, if played with due irony of course.

Bar None will supply that with beer pong in full tow.\n\nThough a little crowded on a Sat night, I was pretty happy with this place.  The bartenders were attentive, the drinks were decently priced, and the beer pong was a ragin'.  Sure, it's a little dirty down there (beer cups *everywhere*) but you can't really expect much less.

If, that is, you consider a below par frat party where you still have to pay $8 for a well vodka tonic a success. They hold \"power hour\" every night from 9-10. Need I say more? The fact that it seems to always be insanely crowded in here serves as a benefit to patrons who are 9 times out of 10 too drunk to stand on their own, the density of the crowd generally keeps them afloat. It's the marina version of the Abbey Tavern - those of you who are familiar with the abbey should instantly understand the dynamic here at Bar None.\n\nThe darts and kickball after parties make it an occasionally unavoidable weeknight destination but I avoid it like the plague when at all possible.

For example, if I walk in to an asian massage parlor, I'm clearly not going there for the purpose of getting a massage.  Thus, it wouldn't make any sense for me to rate said massage parlor on how good a massage I get.  That would be stupid.  As another example, when I walk in to a strip club, I don't expect the strippers to serve me a venti half caf latte.  And again, I wouldn't rate them based on that criteria.\n\nNow, with those caveats in place, you have to give the same treatment to Bar None.  You don't go to Bar None expecting excellent service and the best drinks on the planet.  Don't expect to have a calm and soothing environment where you can chill out with your lady-friend.  \n\nYou go to Bar None to get a pitcher of beer, play some beer pong and relive your college days.  If you go here expecting ANYTHING else, then I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.  The whole atmosphere is geared towards reliving those days when we all went to frat parties and waded through an ungodly amount of drunk people to get up to the front of the line so we could do a keg stand.  And keeping that in mind, it does a very good job of providing that kind of atmosphere.\n\nThe bartenders are great at pouring shots and pitchers; I wouldn't venture much beyond that.  The bathrooms should be avoided at all costs; again, even there Bar None does an excellent job of replicating the fraternity party atmosphere.  Did you ever walk in to a bathroom at one of those parties sober?  \n\nAnd finally: beer pong.  Play it.  You know you miss it!  You know you loved it!

They're actually nice guys that you could chat it up with while you're waiting to get in, even during busy hours.\n-Bank ATM (it was either WAMU or BofA, I forget) right across the street, so you don't use the one inside with a 5 dollar surcharge.\n\nCONS:\n-For the kind of bar it is, Bar None is quite small.\n-The place is dirty. The floor is sticky and sometimes it smells disgusting.\n-Calling the restrooms dirty would be an understatement.\n-The place gets really crowded on weekends, so in consequence getting a drink on a busy night is dependent on who is willing to move away from the bar when he/she got his/her drink, and usually they don't leave for a few minutes because they take more than one round.\n-No DJ, music from what I remember comes out of a jukebox (it's something different, but not something I could get comfortable with)\n-For the most part, the crowd is pretty rowdy.\n\n\nSounds like a bad review right? Only reason why I'm giving this place three stars is because there wasn't a night that I regret going here instead of some other bar. Plus, it's always fun watching people who are more drunk than you are. Of all bars I go to, people tend to get way more destroyed here than other places I've gone to.\n\nExamples:\n-Britney Spears' \"Slave\" came on, and this cute blonde who was a rabid fan of hers tried to destroy the jukebox because she wanted to steal the CD so bad.\n-Two drunk guys started to brawl inside, only to be escorted out, and apologize to each other telling each other \"Sorry bro I was drunk, I don't even know who the hell you are\"\n-Two drunk girls fighting each other, only to realize they were sisters fighting over some short dude in a tank top.\n\nRandomness at its fullest.

When I went to the restroom, I saw a latrine and one bathroom stall with black and white walls.  Personally, I don't prefer latrines because 1)They always smell,  2)Everyone can size each other up, and 3)If somebody's drunk, prepare for a golden shower since he can't aim right.\n\nOn to the Beer Pong! Four tables were setup parallel to each other. Pitchers and plastic cups were flying everywhere.  10 plastic cups filled half way with beer on each end placed in a bowling pin configuration, one ping pong ball, and two players on each side.  The floor was soaked in beer and sweat, but no one really cared.  My sidekick and I had the pleasure of getting a good beat down by Jacob and Vy's precision aiming.  I swear there was something else inside three of the cups other than beer because the liquid was clear but yet it tasted like beer.  To be a gentleman, I agreed to drink most of the beer cups if the other team hit a goal. Yeah right, who was I kidding? I just wanted to get plastered!  The play was great fun and everyone did censored things to keep us from getting our ball in the opposing side's cups (I have pictures).  When a guy tried to stop our ball from rolling around the floor, he stepped on it and flattened it.  I went to the bar and got 2 more balls; one for play and one for keepsake.  \n\nAttention!

Regardless, if beer pong is your thing and you rationalize that the alcohol will kill any potential strains of bacteria, bar none would be a worthy stop.  Don't get me wrong, I liked beer pong...  in college, I liked to play it...  in the comfort of my or a friend's house, mainly because if I am going to ingest bacterias and other weird crap, I would prefer to do it in an environment of my own or one of people I generally know.  I can see flaws in this logic, but I digress.  \n\nMoving on the bar had a decent selection of beers (can't compare to the east coast bars in that...)  and the woman at the taps was very nice and was explaining the flavor of a certain beer that none of us heard of, it was loud, so we could barely hear here, but I saw the head nod and smile from her.  She did a good job pour my buddies Guinness, as well.  They do have a dart board section as well, we ended up playing that while having drinks, nothings better then combining alcohol in a small area, with lots of people and sharp pointy things.  It is worth mentioning that the men's room doesn't have a traditional urinal, some people may not know what I am describing, but it is essentially a long trough (If you used the bathrooms at a Oakland Raider game you'll know what I'm talking about.).  This long trough has no partitions so essentially if it is busy and you need to go you will stand shoulder touching shoulder as 3-4 people try to do their business there, I wouldn't have a problem with it, except the guy next to me was really plastered, to the point his head was leading towards the shoulder of the guy directly to his right and his stance was swaying, I saw this and tried to hasten my business because I didn't want to me caught in his splash show should he start pointing to me...

If it's not then you're probably not reading this review so get out of here!! Go!! I've been to like 10 billion bars in my life and this one is nothing special but definitely not as bad as everyone says. I've been kicked out of here for nothing so i guess that kind of sucked but whatev's. I will give this a average rating of 3 stars, because it is an average bar. So what if it has beer pong?

I really wish I could meet this guy again- The bar itself is just a crowded college bar, nothing special, but when my roommate and her girlfriends wanted to go out to the Marina and we found ourselves here it was no biggie, we were already a couple drinks deep. So anyway, it was time to head over to the loo and I was groovin to the music on my way, and this guy picks up on it and we totally start Swing dancing in the middle of the crowded bar, for like two whole songs. I was doing the whole swing dancing thing at the time, so it was awesome and amazing that we both were up for it. Anyway, so I was too cool for school and I didn't give my number out or anything, but to this day, I still remember how awesome it was. In my mind I cannot remember how gross the bathrooms were or whatever, or who else was there, all I remember was a great dance in a super crowded, hot bar. 4 stars for fun, but not 5.

If you are a borderline alcoholic who happens to be in the marina then I recommend Bar None on a Thursday night.

The biggest problem is that most of us who live here have matured beyond that point! However, there must be some group of people whose dynamic still resembles that of PCU or Van Wilder, because this place manages to stay in business (Sorry PCU, you're a good movie and I hate to mention you along with this place but its just to make a point). Now, don't get me wrong, I once embraced the same virtue-questioned, half-drunk, fraternity meat-head lifestyle of this bar's patrons. The difference though was that I grew out of that phase and into adulthood.
