The mango green tea was good. \n\nI would mosdef just come back and eat here again! Customer service was on point. They even had two TVs playing kids shows which both of our kids watch! Like Oddbods!

The train concept was super fun and servers were really friendly- although I think they've grown a lot and they get super busy so maybe they don't know how to manage it anymore. \nLast couple times I've been there I always get really annoyed about service- even tho I request help on the screen I will always have to catch someone while they walk by cause they just won't came otherwise... I stress to the point that I don't get to enjoy my meal. For example, I have to wait a long time for plates, new sticks or spoons, even when my food has already arrived and it's getting cold. I always tell myself I won't comeback but the sushi is not bad and the location is really good and when I'm hungry I think I can put up with it.  I work on a restaurant and I would advice them to get someone to work as a busser, because the line is always super long even when there's several tables empty just because no one has time to clean them! - I'm not opposed to wait, since I understand what they're going through, but sometimes is just too much. Same happens while we're eating there, plates will pile up and I will have to ask several times for them to be removed.\nI'm trying to be friendly and just advising some things me and my friends have noticed because the sushi and food is actually pretty good and we would love to come to this spot if this things improve.", "author": "Barbara D."}

Indeed, it's Hikari (Dawn), San Francisco's first bullet train sushi, the next conveyor belt sushi bar of the future!  After asking a couple of staff about this brand new sushi bar, I find it very interesting before I took my leave.\n\nBy Saturday, it's better to take this opportunity to try out any of their iPad after I was seated almost next to a whacky middle aged woman on my right side.  A pair of nigiri wasn't my aim in the bullet train sushi bar; therefore, I haven't touched the wasabi and a pickled ginger.  Miso soup wasn't always my signature starter since I closed it off to make way for soba noodle soup bowl with ebi kakiage.  Potato croquette?  I closed the frenchy one I chose before and picked the grilled mushrooms as my appetizer.  Dragging unto the right hand iPad screen to get to warabi matcha, and I have up to three selections out of four before I'm done.\n\nFirst up, speeding towards my right destination was my grilled mushrooms!  Tasted smoky when chewing the mushroom flavor and it's so good than it was once bland.  Next up, warabi matcha of the dessert section!  These mochi cubes covered in matcha powder and lathered with Japanese black honey are truly a sweet treat which I saved the best for last.  Finally, a soba noodle bowl and ebi kakiage, only be delivered to me by the hands of the male wait staff.  While the mini bowl of soba noodle was good as warm, I love the crunchiness of the battered tempura shrimp and vegetables mixed together.\n\nEating in Hikari was great!  There are plenty of things I want to bring up about my experience here.  When tapping on the iPad for the right selections, there's no time limit and I can change the selections back.  Whenever I need help with the self service features, I asked for any wait staff or I asked one of the customers on my left or right side.  Food service was as quick as the 200 mph bullet train.  Every time the red button blinked and sounded, that means my food came to my right destination.  Tap the flashing red button, and the bullet train goes backward towards the kitchen area.  Best customer service!  Highly recommended!    ^_^", "author": "Jimmy C."}

Anyway, as I was passing by on a quiet Tuesday evening, I wasn't sure about trying this place because it struck me as just a locomotive variation on the sushi boat concept. When I entered the almost-empty space, I was cordially led to the long counter against the wall where I was staring at an iPad with a sliding pictorial menu (photo: http://bit.ly/2odUFaV). I also noticed two sets of tracks that ran back into the kitchen, so I assumed the bullet train was riding those rails.\n\nI took it from there since I'm Asian and don't require instructions. The menu was pretty standard for a J-Town sushi restaurant. I started with my litmus test, the variety-pack Chirashi which came as an $18 Dinner Set with miso soup. Ironically a server brought me the generic soup (photo: http://bit.ly/2MXF9xY), but it dawned on me that there was the risk of a miso tsunami if it travelled at full speed on the train. My chirashi box did come on the 8:20 from Osaka complete with sound effects.\n\nFrankly it was a middling combo of medium-quality fish highlighted by a lot of roe with a bed of slightly overcooked rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2MTIKwV). I pressed the red button to send the train back. You would think that would be enough, but I also ordered a $7 plate of Ankimo, three slices of monkfish liver that tasted a bit on the dry side (photo: http://bit.ly/2LxXQTW). The best thing I had was the $3 Teba, which are chicken wings served up as yakitori (photo: http://bit.ly/2PJaqmz). The bullet train must have had a hypnotic effect on me (video: http://bit.ly/2P9N1K4) because...\n\nFor reasons unknown, I came back a couple of weeks later to try some of the other items. My other litmus test was the $13 Hamachi Kama which came on the 7:45 from Nagoya overcooked and a little too charred (photo: http://bit.ly/2LxAVbl). I also tried the $6 Hamachi Sashimi, which struck me as pricey for three slices (photo: http://bit.ly/2wm48RQ), and the $3 Negima, a rather skimpy version of chicken yakitori (photo: http://bit.ly/2LxXjkU). The $2.50 Matcha Pudding was the last bullet train home to Yokohama, but it refused to deliver above the school cafeteria level (photo: http://bit.ly/2NpKbQN).\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...too much focus on transportation appears to mean less on the quality of the fish\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...certainly spacious enough though where's the clickety-clack, rotating train schedule?\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...they work in the background and let the train create the 'magic'\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I hear the train a-comin'\n\nRELATED - Looking for more dining options in Japantown?

They have a wide selection of Japanese dishes, including appetizers, sushi rolls, nigiri, rice bowls, etc. You can only place up to 4 orders at a time, and the food comes served to your seat via a bullet train shaped plate. Pretty nifty :)\n\nI came for Sunday lunch around noon and there were plenty of empty booths and seats. We ordered a variety of dishes and shared everything. My favorites were the karaage ($6), which had the right amount of crispiness and batter, and the gyoza ($6), which even my picky friend admitted was good, but their sushi rolls were solid as well. Also, we got a dessert (matcha cheesecake) on the house, which was sweet of them!\n\nOnce we ordered enough dishes, a fun screen popped up on the iPad and we had to choose one of three treasure boxes. Not sure what else you can win, but we won an order of salmon nigiri! I thought it would be some toy, similar to what you can win at Kula down in south bay, but I like the idea of winning food a lot better :)\n\nI also appreciated that prices were on par with your typical Japanese joint; I was half expecting things to extra pricey here due to the bullet train concept and its prime location in Japantown. We each paid ~$25 for the meal, which isn't bad at all.\n\nThe only thing is that it can slightly awkward to order, as there are multiple pages to scroll through, and really only the two people closest to the iPad can order, but other than that, it was a fun lunch experience!", "author": "Dianna H."}

I happened across this place from a random advertisement that popped up one day and I absolutely loved the concept, and on a Saturday afternoon, we decided to give it a shot!\n\nHikari is a pretty good sized restaurant with the draw that it is (as far as I know?) the only bullet train restaurant in SF. Basically, you order via a little iPad device at your table, and then when your food is ready, a cute little Choo drives out to your table and drops off your food for you! \n\nWe ended up going for some different nigiri and a roll, and soon our little locomotive was out to our table! Not just a gimmick restaurant, but actually really high quality and fresh fish!\n\nPrices are very reasonable which is saying a lot given this is a place in Japantown.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-24", "description": "Hikari prides itself on being San Francisco's first bullet train sushi restaurant, however, the execution of this fails to reach the standard already set in the Bay Area by Kula.\n\nBeing big fans of the novelty and fun of bullet train sushi, the boyfriend and I decided to try having dinner here with some friends since we were in Japantown at the New People building next door. We thought they would be extremely busy at dinner time on a weekend, but there was actually plenty of space inside and we got to choose whether we wanted to sit at a booth or at the bar (opted for the latter so we could all play with individual screens). \n\nA quick glance at their menu, an iPad touchscreen that you can navigate and order from, showed a variety of nigiri, rolls, hot and cold appetizers, noodles, donburi, skewers, and desserts. They even had sashimi plates, which sometimes seem to get omitted from bullet train sushi menus and was a plus for me! \n\nDespite our initial excitement, a few things brought our experience down from there.\n\nFirst, prices in general were expensive. Second, quality was mediocre at best. You don't go to bullet train sushi expecting top grade fish, but the items were priced as if you were at a regular Japanese restaurant - for example, the 15 piece sashimi platter was nearly $30, yet the cuts were underwhelming in size and taste, and cold as well, as if they had just been frozen not long before. A small unagi donburi was $14 and mostly consisted of rice. The nigiri ranged from at least $3 for mostly non-fish items, to $4.50 for the usual maguro, and up to $8 for fatty tuna. Compared to when we are at Kula, which charges up to $2.75 for basic nigiri, we were much more careful and restrictive regarding choosing what to order. \n\nFinally, the bullet train system was not as advanced as others that we have seen - there were only two rows of trains, and you had to press a button manually to return the train to the kitchen. With a lot of people sending multiple orders, this could cause some back-up. There was also no disposal slot for finished trays, which resulted in more clutter at your table. \n\nOne perk was that we got a \"prize\" screen every so often after ordering a certain amount of food, and choosing the correctly colored treasure chest rewarded us with a complimentary mochi dessert, which was cute...but didn't save the whole experience. The service was pretty good and our water was refilled and empty dishes taken on a regular basis. However, the amount of money we spent between two people seemed outrageous for the quality and quantity of food, and would likely have been better spent at a nice Japanese restaurant.", "author": "Brittney K."}

Enjoy, while mommy knocks down several bottles of sake\". J/k but I love this mommy's style: https://bit.ly/2HqxOSd. \n\nSeveral days ago, I read on Hoodline that there was a new sushi restaurant in J-town, Hikari that touts themselves as being the first bullet train sushi restaurant in the San Francisco. I immediately checked Yelp and saw they got raving reviews...but I should of read google reviews too because my friend and former yelper, Albertino M's review was on point: https://goo.gl/maps/xUQHMaFcCht. Hikari is really a hit or miss.\n\nBefore getting into that, let's talk about how Hikari works. Walk in, get seated, then start ordering on the iPad: https://bit.ly/2HgRjz5. You can only order 4 items at a time and you can denote what order they come in. Your order will arrive shortly via \"bullet train\". Pick up your order, then hit the red button, and the bullet train returns to the kitchen. \n\nI ordered the following: \n*Chicken Karaage ($6): https://bit.ly/2EDDepS\n*Zuke Sake Nigiri: Marinated Salmon (2 pc - $4.50): https://bit.ly/2JCkpHj\n*Aburi Sake Toro Nigiri: Seared Salmon Belly (2 pc - $5): https://bit.ly/2JzsZGO\n*Aji Nigiri: Horse Mackerel (2 pc - $5): https://bit.ly/2HaORtZ\n*Uni Nigiri: Sea Urchin (2 pc - $8): https://bit.ly/2IK15GV\n*Otoro Nigiri: Fatty Tuna 2 pc - $8): https://bit.ly/2HuvREA\n\n(+) Super sweet staff.\n(+) Fast service, I was in and out in less than 20 minutes for lunch because it was completely empty. \n(+) Easy ordering process, unless you're one of the dinosaur senators questioning Mark Zuckerberg at the committee hearing. They would think the iPad was a painting. \n(+) Fun for kids, they will enjoy seeing their food arrive via the bullet trains.\n(+) Large variety of non-cooked and cooked items: soups, salads, cold apps, hot apps, nigiri, maki rolls, udon, yakitori, and lunch plates.\n(+) Reasonable prices. Nigiri pairs: $4 - $8, Lunch specials: $10-$11, and Udon/Soba: $6, etc.\n(+) Otoro was the best cut - super fatty and melted like butter (albiet thin). \n\n(-) If you're looking for good sushi, this is not the place. The shari (sushi rice) is flavorless and the fish is low quality. \n(-) Zuke sake, aburi sake toro (they forgot to sear it), and aji were all stale and very dry.\n(-) Inconsistency in shari (sushi rice) and neta (fish) sizes. I'm not trying to be nitpicky but the differences were very noticeable when lifting the neta up. Also, you can see the cuts widely vary in the Yelp pics. \n(-) Chicken karaage had a hard, chewy batter.\n\nI'm in the minority here but even though Hikari was reasonably priced, the food was 3 stars at best (and that's being generous). I wasn't expecting great sushi for the price but I was bummed that the fish was stale and dry. For a good value, Amami is hard to beat. \n\nIMO, Hikari is strictly a novelty sushi restaurant for families with kids. Since I don't have any, unfortunately, it's unlikely I would return. 3 stars plus .5 star for the sweet staff but rounding down.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Man oh man was I SO disappointed. It was definitely overpriced for the quality. We only ordered three things after scrolling through the ipad menus. We figured we'd eat somewhere else after since we didn't like most of the selections they had to offer. I got a roll with eel, egg, and some other stuff in it. It was just okay. My boyfriend got some spicy salmon roll which was mostly rice... there was barely any fish in it at all. I guess the only good thing we had was the udon, but it was pretty standard in flavor and needed a lot extra of that orange seasoning.\n\nI loved the idea of getting my sushi delivered to me on a cute little train, but that's all it was - cute. It wasn't as high tech as Kula in Cupertino. There was no place to dispose of your plates immediately. You had to push a button for the train to go back rather than it immediately going back once it sensed the plates were removed. What if we never pressed the button, what would happen? There was only one train that would deliver sushi to the whole row of people besides you. I could definitely see this being a problem in terms of wait time...\n\nThe only reason why this place gets a two stars is for the service. The servers were very nice, but I would not come again or recommend this place if you're looking for something to fill you up. Kula is better in terms of price and efficiency!", "author": "Sydney C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-04-14", "description": "Overpriced, mediocre, and a LONG wait time. \n\nIt's a cool concept that will definitely draw crowds in - ordering on an iPad and waiting for your food to come out on a cute little train. The only problem is, there are only two trains per row that can only hold so much, serving at least 10+ people. At one point, one of the trains got stuck and a server had to push it manually... \nThis results in a very long wait time and you can order only 4 items at once. We waited over 30 minutes to eat 4 pieces of nigiri and another 20 minutes for our sushi roll to come out. It got to the point where I was so hungry and impatient that I didn't even want to wait for the roll anymore and just leave, but the server insisted that it was still coming. \n\nWhen the roll finally came, it was nothing special and totally overpriced. For $13, the Hikari train roll is just a California roll topped with assorted fish and a raw quail egg in the center of the plate atop a bed of raw onions. The \"seared and marinated\" salmon nigiri ($4.50) was also disappointing, it wasn't seared at all and the slice of salmon was super thin. The other nigiri we ordered were hamachi, amaebi, uni, and unagi. These are all normal priced at $5-8 so if you're expecting prices like Kula Sushi in Cupertino, this is not it. The only thing that was worth the money is the uni, at $8 for two pieces. \n\nOverall, don't come here if you're hungry or in a group because you'll probably end up waiting for over an hour just for mediocre sushi. You can't even order it all at once! I get that they're new and probably still working out the kinks but that can't justify my terrible experience here. Our total for 6 items was already $54 and we left hungry because we didn't want to order more food and have to wait even longer. Pass on Hikari!", "author": "Cecille W."}

Order from a tablet, items shoot out of a cool bullet train (JR?) Oh how I miss Japan! This reminded me of Genki in Japan, and Kula/Kura which is the same thing but cheaper and more options. There's a bar side where each individual will get their own tablets, which by the way was way too high up EVEN FOR MY TALL FRIENDS. I swear it's not even because I'm so tiny. Then there's tables where you can sit together and order on one tablet. I think it's more fun to get to use your own and order your own, so we opted in for the bar. \n\nThe food came out randomly and was quite slow, even though the restaurant was quite slow. \n\nThe experience was cool overall, although I'd probably would opt out of coming back. It's fun to get to do this but food wasn't spectacular to say the least.\n\nUpdate: they charged me the wrong amount on my credit card.... look out on your bank statement. I'm taking off another star", "author": "Melody W."}

The bullet trains were initially very exciting to watch but they became distracting over time. One of the two trains that were serving food along the booths became broken, and we had to manually push them back towards the kitchen each time a table took their plate. The food was not bad for sushi boat quality, and the menu offered many appetizers and sushi rolls in addition to nigiri. However, the sushi rice was not great and kept falling apart.", "author": "K.

I've been lazy lately, and when i heard about the opening of this place, i was excited to try it.  I've been noticing the construction of this place for about a year and was glad that they finally opened. I've seen a couple of these restaurants in Asia, so it's cool to see the first one in SF.  It's right across the Peace Plaza and when you walk in, it's actually pretty spacious. Hikari is actually a train line that takes you from Tokyo to Osaka, so i think the name of this place is actually pretty fitting.  They have long tables for party of 4 and 6 and they also have bar side seats for couples or individuals.  \n\nThe way this restaurant works is that, you order from a Ipad and you are allowed to order 4 items at a time.  The menu comes in 4 different languages, English, Japanese, Korean and Chinese.   From the menu, you'll have your choices of Nigiri, Gunkan/rolls, appetizers, noodles(soba/udon),  Rice/Yakitori, drinks (beer, wine, ice tea, soda and etc) and specials(desserts).  They give you a pen,which makes it easier for you to select your items.   After your selection, you place your order and the red light at your station will light it, indicating that your train with the food is arriving soon.  When it arrives, it beeps.  You remove your items from the train and press the button so it can return to it's main station.  The concept of this is to cute, I saw a lot of kids around me having fun with this, but as a grown up, I was having just as much fun. I got super excited when the train arrived, I felt like a kid again. \n\nSo let's get to the food.  As I said earlier, they have Nigiri options.  What i love about the screen is that they have broken up the nigiri options into sections.  They broke it down by Maguro, salmon, Whitefish and etc.  which is great when you only want to eat a particular fish.   I ended up ordering the Salmon, Zuke salmon, Hamachi, Uni, Aburi toro, scallop and kanpachi. All of these were pretty fresh, my favorite was the zuke salmon and the hamachi. The scallop was also my favorite because it tasted sweet and the portion was good. But the most amazing dish of the night was the Carpaccio, which had the right amount of sauce to go with the salmon and scallop.  I finished the dish as fast and if i had more room in my tummy, i would've ordered 10 more of this dish!  It had the melt on your mouth feel when you were eating it. My friend got the Chicken katsu with a bowl of rice. The batter was perfect and it was just fried to perfection. Not too dark and not so hard where it was too crispy.  \n\nOverall, i enjoyed my visit at Hikari.  What i also enjoyed seeing was they they had a great selection of ice teas, they had mango green tea, Passion fruit black tea and much more.  The service was super nice and i spoke to the owner and she mentioned that they are still working on the menu, and will be adding more items.  I will be back for more food once they add more items!", "author": "Belinda C."}

Everything we ordered was delicious. The fish was very fresh. My favorite was the Hamachi sashimi. It was very fresh. To describe the flavor can only be compared to eating the finest butter yet crunchy. The udon was delicious. I did like the 49er roll and the Lion King roll. If you like a hint of spicy, this is the roll for you. It wasnt the type of spicy where your mouth was on fire but made its presence known and then quickly disappears. I would highly recommend going, especially if you are a sushi/sashimi connoisseur. I was lucky enough to meet the owner, Vin. He is very nice. \n\nThe service was amazing as well. The cool thing is that your food arrives on a Bullet. Which was cool. You dont have to worry about your order sitting to be brought out to you. It comes to your table right after it is made. We had the fried giant squid, and it arrived at our table right after it came out of the fryer so wait a little bit before taking a bit.", "author": "Serene W."}

I was expecting this place to have overpriced terrible sushi and be only popular for the the gimmick... and don't get me wrong, the gimmick is great but the sushi wasn't bad either! Ok this will not compare to sushi fresh flown in from japan but for around $4 for an order it was still fairly fresh and tasty. They also have sushi which is slightly seared which I absolutely love... also! They had otoro for like $8 which is not bad at all compared to many of these higher end places! The uni was also fine and not terrible. Other main cooked dishes were around 11 ish and so all in all, you could have a very good meal for not too bad price... also the trains!!

It is good to see this kind of restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no wow factor with Hikari.  Sushi was pretty much average, prices are a bit on the high side, and the bullet train system is probably the same speed or slower as having a waiter or sushi chef bring it to you.  Definitely, it is not as fast as the other restaurants I've been to.  Also, similar restaurants have a greater selection of other offerings such as mini rice bowls, poke, and so forth.\n\nThis is a new restaurant so they have growing pains and have some areas that they could improve at.", "author": "Re-pley Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-17", "description": "The current 3.5 yelp rating of this place is accurate. No health hazard. But also inartfully crafted. For example, tekka maki is a very standard dish. The finished product here looked as if I had taken a stick of room-temperature butter and squeezed my fist until lumps fell out between my fingers. The fish was visible, and not just from the ends of the roll.\n\nI'm not sure who cut the sashimi either. They cut it in exactly the opposite direction it is supposed to be cut. Sashimi should break apart easily as you chew. That has to do with the chef using the proper technique to cut the fish in the right direction. It tasted like whoever prepared our sashimi had never sat down and eaten at a sushi restaurant before.\n\nThey also didn't seem to get the concept of the train they so well advertised. I understand that we front-loaded a lot of our order, but the concept is to serve us as the food is prepared one dish at a time. Not make us wait 20 minutes to prepare the dish that likely takes the longest to prepare--chawanmushi (by the way, did the pour the whole bottle of yuzu juice in there??? That being said, consistency of the egg was interesting)--simply because that was the first thing on our list. And also, don't serve the other 6 dishes all at once. Prepare the fish for one dish, send it out, then start preparing the next dish. Again, it felt whoever was serving us had never been to an automated sushi restaurant before, let alone Japan.\n\nAll things considered, it's been over two hours, and I've experienced no...digestive problems. Again, the food tasted okay, but there was just no soul behind it. That's quite a front when you stiff us with a $50 bill for two when we could have had a more enjoyable experience that was more diligently prepared at other restaurants for a fraction of the price. If management were wondering, that's why there's not a line out the door, even in SF which loves gimmicky restaurants and activities.", "author": "JWest M."}

I went when it wasn't super crowded and everything I ordered was fresh, hot, made to order and delicious. \n\nTheir natto nigiri was on point. 49er roll was also fresh and delicate.

My kids have experienced the original ipad sushi experience in Tokyo and we were hoping to find it on our Japan cruise.  We could not locate it during our online research and our cruise cancelled a port due to typhoon so on our return to SF we wanted a memorable sushi meal.  We were willing to settle for conveyor belt but my search led me to Hikari which offers ipad/bullet train sushi.  What does this mean?  You use an ipad at your table to browse the menu and place your order.  You can take your time and order a few items at a time and keep adding more items.  When ready, a little whistle blows and the screen changes.  Unfortunately, it is in Japanese for the message but a picture shows you what is being delivered to the table.  Then you watch the track to see the little bullet train deliver your food tableside.  You are then prompted to remove your items and then press the \"return\" button to send the train back to the kitchen.  It is such a simple but clever idea!  The food was good and the experience extremely memorable.  I will definitely return when traveling on business in October.", "author": "Maria K."}

Udon was great, although the tempura that was served with the udon had way too many onions and shrimp tasted like it wasn't cooked fully.

I wanted to order more things but there wasn't a lot of items on the menu & it was kind of pricey. My friend ordered the unagi roll & another roll, the vinegar was too strong on the unagi roll.

This place has been very nicely renovated- clean and modern decor. \nWhile this is one of the first bullet trains style sushi places in the US, they are commonplace in Japan.\nI personally like shinkansen bullet train style better than kaitenzushi revolving sushi bar style (places like Kula) because the sushi is made to order rather than sitting on the conveyor belt. This should mean fresher fish for the customer! (Also less chance of getting sick and less food wasted) \nHowever, if you are a sushi snob and into omakase style, this place isn't for you. But if you want simple nigiri sushi, rolls, and general Japanese food in a nice setting this is a good option. \nI can see this becoming a big tourist spot for Japantown. It's great for families and kids. Everyone can get something they want. There are A LOT of non sushi options. The dessert choices were pretty solid too.\nHowever, BEWARE the food quality compared to price was a bit expensive. The quality was just ok.

This place finally opened across the street from the japantown plaza (I think opened for less than a week). Entered a dainty little place if you ask me for a similar conveyor belt/ sushi boat sushi concept but miniature style. Once you walk in, you can't help but noticed a bunch of iPads readily available to take your orders. After getting seated you'll wonder how come the ordering screen's so high up and hard to reach (for the shorter arm folks). Don't be silly like us loosing our blood flow just trying to place orders! There is an iPad pen provided to help you out!! We forgot about it Dx \n\nVery self explanatory ordering system. Varieties of categories to choose from and you just add what you want to your cart by selecting how many quantity of the order you would like. You'll notice fairly quickly that it's limited to 4 pieces per order since it'll let you know you won't be able to place another, once your order come, you'll be able to place your next one. I'd say the selection was alright. Not too many choices but also enough for you to browse. Would recommend adding more selections in the future once you gauge more with your customers.\n\nPrice I must say it was a bit above average for what I'm tasting. We're looking about ~$3-10 per order (comes with 2 pieces each). \n\nOnto the food portion, it's fairly decent in my book. Have I had better for this type of concept sushi? Yes. Have I had worse? Definitely. It's kind of just in the middle where it's alright. Definitely not a place I would wait in line for (like the revolving sushi place in Cupertino formally known as Kula Sushi but now renamed as Kura Revolving Sushi). Oh and not to mention the color of their plates reminds me of the ones from Kura as well, except they don't have a plate disposer for games. Tried out the hamachi, salmon, unagi, and marinated salmon nigiri, their $2 kumamoto oyster, and their hamachi Kama. As you can tell, wasn't all that exciting for us to try only a number of things before we *ahem* hopped over to Benihana to catch their happy hour because their food were more worth it and filling for their price. You're literally just sitting next to a straight conveyer belt where the food goes back and forth like a train. BUT, do recommend to try their hamachi Kama, made just right.\n\nOverall fun concept, maybe more suitable for family and kids.

We ordered the spicy tuna roll, tuna roll, salmon avocado roll, tuna nigiri, marinated tuna nigiri. I think the average wait time for each roll or order was about 5 to 7 minutes. Of course, they came out on these cute bullet trains that stopped in front of us and once we take the dishes off, we can send the bullet train back to the chefs in the back by pressing the red button in front of us. We ordered using the tablets set in front of us. There was also a button that we could push if we needed server attention. One of the downfalls of this place is that they had some of the Main dishes labeled as sold out, such as fatty tuna, so we were limited in the things that we could order which was very disappointing.\nInside was pretty spacious and comfortable. Service was pretty good for the most part except for when we first came in and no one acknowledged us for the first 5 minutes although the same waitress had been walking back and forth passing us and never once looked up to greet us or acknowledge us. That was a bit disappointing but other than that it was pretty decent service.\nI don't think I would come back but if you're looking for something interesting or cool to try out such as the bullet train Sushi then I think it's good for a first time. However, if you are really looking for Quality sushi, experience and service then I think it's best to go elsewhere.", "author": "Hu L."}

But I want to write about Hikari because the staff is nice and I really want this place to thrive.  \n\nThe bullet train is really for the kids.  I came with my niece and nephew.  (2/3 of the people there came with kids too.)  But when you sit at a large table (for 6), there's a reach issue when it comes to ordering.  There's only one screen by the food delivery area and since the kids wanted to see the bullet train deliver the food up front and personal, they sat by the order screen.  This in turn created a big issue in which the grown-ups had to reach over the kids to order.  Every. single. time.  And the people on the far side could barely see the menu (two seats over) and did not have access to ordering food themselves.  I think orders per table would increase dramatically if there is another order screen on the other side of the table.  Also, the downtime between ordering was boring to the kids as they kept wanting to see the bullet train come out so it would be helpful to have more games on the screen to entertain them (then the adults could perhaps use another screen to order?).  I understand that this is additional cost to the restaurant but since there are only a few (I think six?) tables, I think the incremental revenue would make it a worthwhile investment. \n\nThere's a good variety of Japanese food so it's not just sushi as many in my family do not eat raw food due to personal preference and allergies.  As the same time, you shouldn't come here expecting sushi that tastes like they just got flown in from Tsukiji Fish Market. Portions are on the smaller side but this actually works well in this setting because we got to try many different things (i.e. a mini chicken udon is only $6).  \n\nLike other reviews had stated, sometimes there were a few items that took quite a long time to come out and the kids got anxious (\"Where's the train?\").  \n\nStaff was attentive and friendly and really tried hard to make our visit as comfortable as possible.\n\nThis restaurant doesn't take reservations so we went early and was able to grab a table without waiting at all.  \n\nOverall it was a good experience for the kids and the food was decent enough for the adults.  I would recommend this place if you have young kids (10 or under).", "author": "Isabella F."}

You order on an tablet that's hooked up on the table.  When you press order, you wait for your food to arrive via the BULLET TRAIN that will stop in front of your table.  As you wait, the bullet train may deliver other food to other people, so sometimes you get all excited, just to watch someone else's food pass by.  But, eventually, the train will stop in front of your table, and you'll pick up the food, send the train back and dig in!  \n\nYou can order in multiple rounds, but be wary, if you explore the menu too long, your arm will start to hurt as you explore through the options.  Still fun though.  \n\nWe ordered an avocado roll, salmon sashimi, a rock and roll and an edamame.  All of which was really good.  The whole thing came out to be around $30 with a nice tip, which is totally reasonable for SF.  And it came with hot tea, which I loved. \n\nThe line was non-existent when I went on Sunday afternoon, you can press a button to get service and the servers were great, and the bullet train while a little cheesy was totally fun.  As we were about to leave, a family with kids sat down, the kids were so excited to see the bullet train come out with their food.

I found out from the owner that this place has opened for just two weeks and he said it took two years to remodel. For a revolving sushi place, it is quite comfy.  I like the privacy I had sitting at the booth. Food was good. The steamed eggs was so good!  We liked the scallops, sweet shrimps. The sushi here is way better than Kula but it is more expensive here of course. The iPad we ordered from flashed out 3 Treasure chests in the middle of our dinner. We picked one and got a prize! We didn't know what it was until the dish of seaweed salad stopped next to us on a bulletin train. I took one star out because the placement of the iPad was too high and my friend who sat next to the button got very busy.  She had to press that  button to return the bullet train back to the kitchen after every dish. The button is also high up.  Imagine stretching your arm during the entire dinner! But this could be a good thing if you have kids who need to do something.  We really like the owner. After we told him how we didn't like the placement of the iPad, he unlocked it and just made the iPad portable for us. He even sent us a free mochi dessert on a train. He knows he has a lot of things to work on. He's a very humbled guy. I really like him!", "author": "Tina L."}

Tried to come in at 1pm for lunch, locked and closed even if it supposedly closes at 2:30pm. I shouldn't have went back for dinner. Workers there were friendly and attentive. We were seated quickly. Having never been there before, I thought servers would instruct on how things worked. Didn't. However, it's kind of straight forward (except the fact that you need to manually return the bullet train post-arrival). Ordered 3 things to start... 3 small plates and about 40 min later (roughly about 25+ min of which was waiting for those plates), the bullet train niche was not worth it. With booths filled, my party of 2 sat in the empty bar area, where service for food was clearly neglected. Quickly got our bill and bounced. Sure, it's new and sure whatever \"give it a chance\" and I guess taste wise is alright but I don't see how it can be successful even if it was better organized. Hypothetically, if the bar where I was sitting in was packed (about 20 seats or so) and there are literally only 2 trains that could run at once AND you have to manually push a button to return each time, no one would get their order in decent time or maybe even correctly. Even on a day where there is 2 people at the bar, the bullshet train takes a longer wait than the muni and that's saying a lot. In conclusion, it's a no from me.", "author": "Emily M."}

It's in a great location where you can explore a bit and come back when around when you think it's time.\nFood= (2) : budget quality; didn't get me sick but didn't taste great either.\nService = (2) : took a long time for a food to come, also hard to wave down servers despite not having to serve food.\nPrice = (3): decently priced for what it is.\n\nSetting, Seating, Wait: \nCame in on Friday night around 7ish. Didn't have to wait long (30 min) since it's sort of new, but I'm sure it'll be tough on the weekend. Place seats pretty well. 12 booths and maybe 16-20 at the bar. Pretty efficient with space. Also I don't think this is Japanese-owned. Based on my experience, Japanese-owned sushi restaurants usually will provide you with oshibori. Being that I'm Chinese, I overheard the staff + manager/owner speaking Chinese so I'll leave you to judge for yourself. \n\nFood: \nFew key things: ordered Uni, Ikura, Otoro. Uni was no good. It didn't come in nice big pieces and it didn't taste fresh. Tasted very metallic and not very fresh. Ikura tasted very bland and alarmingly warm. Otoro's texture was a little firm but was decent. Did a quick peak of the kitchen through the window and it looks like one Japanese sushi chef just supervising a group of non-Japanese food preparers, which brings up my second point. \n\nService: \nRestaurant was pretty packed when I was seated (by the bar). Each section (bar + 2 rows of booths) has two tracks- up and down- each with a train housing two plates. I don't know if it's inexperience or an understaffed kitchen or poor design, but food was not coming out as fast as it should. I'm not surprised however. The menu has nigiri, rolls, tempura, rice dishes, noodles, dessert. The kitchen probably had maybe 10 people working and trying to fill 50+ orders coming in all at once. On a busy night, expect to wait for about 30-45 minutes for your order to start arriving one at a time. We didn't see the train come out more than 7-8 times before we saw our food- so 30 minutes, maybe about eight orders. Also there were about 4 people working front of the house- seating, bussing, working the POS. Wait staff was very friendly though- when you can get their attention. I think the owner skimped big time on the staffing thinking the trains will cut out of most of the labor requirements. Big mistake- I think they should address that issue quickly, especially when it's still new and first impression is huge in this city's restaurant industry.\n\nPrice: \nI don't think the quality was that great for the price you're paying. Very gimmicky concept so that's where you're paying the premium for the experience. I could tell the owner invested a lot of money on the concept and the design of the restaurant but skimped on the food quality and the logistics. For the price, I'd rather go across the street to Nijiya and get better quality product, but I digress.\n\nCool/cute experience to impress a date (unless he/she can distinguish good sushi from bad then no, stay away!), but not a place I would bring my parents or friends. I wish them the best of luck and I hope they succeed. I'll probably return a few months from now if judging by the reviews they've improved. For now, it seem like it's not all there.", "author": "J C."}
