{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-30", "description": "I really don't understand why people love Souvla so much when there are places like this around. Not only is Zaytoon cheaper, but I think the quality of the meat and the variety on the platters is beyond what Souvla has. I guess the only thing missing is ample seating space, but to me that's no big issue.\n\nI came here on a Friday night about half an hour before they closed, and the employees were all super friendly and didn't make us feel bad about going so late. It is a typical fast casual restaurant in that you order and pay upfront at the counter, so I guess that helped a bit. The nice cashier was even friendly enough to clear our plates for us, as we were their last customers of the night. She was very great and I loved how friendly and helpful she was despite the late hour.\n\nThe food itself was also amazing. The meats (both the kebab and the chicken) were incredibly tender and juicy, while the salads, hummus, and pita were as perfect as could be. We were both especially impressed by how the pita struck a perfect balance of fluffiness and crunchiness - not an easy task. I also appreciated how my kebab plate came with some blocks of feta cheese, which was just a small touch that made an excellent flavor pairing with the pickled onions and garlic sauce.\n\nOverall, if I had the choice I would definitely pick this place over Souvla any day. The only thing I didn't check out was the dessert menu, but I'll be sure to do so next time!", "author": "Jenny D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-22", "description": "Rating: 3.5 stars\n\nI recently ordered takeout from Zaytoon, so I can't speak to service. The place is pretty small with just a few bar-counter-esque seats and a cute little parklet outside. I was happy to note from the menu that the prices are very fair - nothing is more than $10.95! I ordered the chicken platter ($9.45) while my friend got the Kebab Platter ($9.95) and asked the staff to sear my chicken a bit more, which they were happy to do!\n\nOpening the to-go box for the chicken platter, my first thought was whoa this is a solid-sized portion. It came with a good amount of shawarma-style chicken, 4 pita halves, and a cucumber tomato salad. My only wish is that they gave more tzatziki sauce than just the tiny container I found inside, given that you need some sauce to accompany the chicken and that hummus costs extra. The chicken itself had excellent flavor and was well-marinated / cooked. The pita didn't taste super authentic, but I don't mind much. \n\nWhen we opened the kebab platter box, our reaction was a bit different. It had the same sides (pita, salad, grilled tomato which I had skipped on) but there were only two small kebabs. It was definitely a much much smaller portion of meat even though it cost slightly more. So my tip would be to avoid the kebab platter and stick to the chicken or lamb platters to get more bang for your buck. Similarly here, we felt the tiny container of tahini sauce could have been a bit larger - its things like this that will go a long way and elevate Zaytoon to a 4/5-star rating. Like the chicken, the kebabs also had great flavor and were quite juicy so we enjoyed them.\n\nOverall, I liked Zaytoon given the prices and high quality meat. But, I just wish they weren't so stingy with their sauces and made portions the same / kept them decently sized no matter what you order.", "author": "Sabina S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-14", "description": "4.5 STARS\n\nLast month, I was at a busted-looking taco truck in back of the Uber building. I wanted a cheap and light lunch so I ordered one taco. I gasped when the guy said, \"Seven-dollars, please\" (no prices listed on the menu). I gasped again when no foodgasm ensued. Kinda like being with a minute man. Ladies, you know what's up...or not.\n \nYesterday, I was reading about a new Mexican restaurant in Russian Hill opening today where A [single] taco with no crema, no guacamole, and no sides is $12. With tax, healthy sf tax, and tip that's $16 for ONE taco. Ridiculous. \n \nMy point is, food prices are insane in San Francisco so I love it when I can get a satisfying meal for around $10 or less.   \n \nI was on my way to an appointment and stopped by Zaytoon for a quick lunch. There's only several stools for seating and a public parklet outside so it's more of a to-go spot. Street parking is only doable during the weekdays around the mornings or lunch. \n \nZaytoon's menu is straight forward with salads, wraps, burgers, and platters. Protein choices: Falafel, lamb, chicken and beef kebab. Everything is under $10.95. Gluten-free option is +$2. The meats are sources from Niman Ranch and breads are locally sourced. Cc's accepted. \n \nI ordered the Lamb Shawarma Wrap ($10.95) to go. Don't forget to check-on Yelp for 10% off.\n \nWhile waiting for my wrap to be prepared, the Steve Harvey Show was showing on their tv. The topic: \"The 30-Day Sex Challenge\" where couples do the horizontal mambo every day for 30-days. Normally, I wouldn't be able to peel my eyes away from the screen but one of the ladies on the show looked like my mom. So...I stared at the empty parklet outside instead.  \n\nLuckily, my wrap was ready to go in less than 5 minutes. \n\nWhen I unraveled the foil, I was pleasantly surprised to see my wrap generously STUFFED with lamb: http://bit.ly/2cVnaaR. The Niman Ranch lamb was robust with spices, and the sumac seasoned onions with sweet broiled tomatoes created a wrap that was jam packed with layers of flavor. I requested it \"spicy\" and the hot sauce had a good, lingering heat (medium spicy). The wrap was tightly wrapped so there was no leaks. I saved the other half for dinner and it kept well with zero sogginess. Minor gripe: I wish the lavash was toasted more. \n\nPrevious picture(s) of the wraps looked skimpy - Ed U's lamb shawarma from 2010: http://bit.ly/2crk4Zi. I'm glad they have since beefed up their fillings and I hope it stays that way. \n\n4.5 STARS rounded up in hopes that their skimpy shawarma was of yesteryear and thick, g-i-r-t-h-y wraps are here to stay!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

A very friendly delivery person delivered the rest of his goods and returned just as I arrived.\n\nNot much to do about this, but the platters arrived in kind of a mess-- I'm glad they were in a plastic bag that contained a lot of the leaked liquids, but the hummus got mixed with the babaganoush (and to some extent, everything else) to the point it wasn't clear whether they even included the extra hummus or not.\n\nAs long as you aren't the type who needs every ingredient separated, the food was still good and hearty without feeling too heavy.

I ordered medium spicy and the end I started eating from, I tasted absolutely no spice so I initially thought the spices were on the weak side...until I got towards the second half of the wrap.

Jamie W. and I came upon it quite by accident at Sunday Streets when we had time to saunter about and discover places we would normally see from the scum-encrusted window of a 14-Mission MUNI bus. It's a small place with counter seating just for about six - so expect to wait for a seat or just get it to go.\n\nThe selection is really straightforward, just five things - falafels big and small, two shwermas - chicken or lamb, and a mazza platter - with optional sides. Even though the mazza platter sounds good with hummus and dolmas, both of us went for the shwermas ($7.95). I had the lamb, and on the plus side were the chunks of marinated rotisserie lamb (see photo). The downside was that everything else was not that outstanding with the grilled lavash bread just too chewy for my taste.\n\nOn the scale between Baladie (my favorite) and what you'd get at a suburban mall in the middle of Hicksville. this one lands slightly north of the middle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-16", "description": "As far as I could tell there are only about 6 items on the menu, which are listed on the wall. I got the Mazza plate which had 2 dolma, 2 falafel, tabouli, babaganoush, hummus, some tomato/cucumber salad, 2 cubes of feta, assorted olives, 2 (seemingly homemade) pickles and the star of the plate was a pile of delicious pickled red onions that we're sprinkled with what seemed to be Turkish sumac. My husband got the chicken schawarma wrap which was great, they asked him if he wanted it spicy and he said yes and it was not spicy but it was still good and we asked for chile on the side and they brought a crushed red chile oil which satisfied my husbands tastebuds. My complaints would be the tomato cucumber salad was watery and bland and seemed a little old- the cuces were soggy and deflated. Also the price was a little steep- we'd only go back if it were a few bucks cheaper- I just don't like spending $23 on lunch for 2 unless we're gonna have tons of leftovers. Each item was $8.95 and the sodas (cans) I guess we're like $2 each which is totally stupid now that I think of it. That's the prob with this place- you don't know what u can order other than what's on the menu and as far as anything displayed (drinks) u could end up spending way more than you want. I also wasn't overly thrilled with the huge tip jar with a sign on it that says something TI the effect of \"do the right thing\" that is sitting right in front of your face at the cash register. I don't think ordering at the counter and having the guy walk 3 steps to ur table to bring the food constitutes a tip and I don't want to be pressured to. If  that job deserves a tip, every occupation does. I'm not docking them on that obviously, but if I owned the store id require a more humble tip jar. \n\nThe food is good, some items lacked a little flavor and the prices are not too unreasonable.

I saw this place on my way to Jay's Cheesesteak and thought \"hey maybe I'll try that for lunch sometime\". Well, fast forward a few months and I've made Zaytoon a regular stop on the lunchtime carousel for my co-workers and myself. Be sure to ask for their frequent buyer card because once you try it, you'll become a fan too. \n\nThe falafel itself is moist with just the right amount of crunch on the outside. I usually order the deluxe with eggplant & potatoes but this place packs in enough falafel balls that it's not necessary in order to fill you up. The hot sauce could be a little hotter but it's definitely not bland. They even wrap your wrap in tinfoil with arrows pointing you to the open side (I found that out after my second trip lol). If this isn't the best falafel in The City, it's pretty damned close!", "author": "John B."}

Well, at least Zaytoon knows what's up.\n\nI ate here a long while back, but remember the Falafel Deluxe being warm and comforting. What I don't remember (and am pretty sure I would), is it having yogurt sauce on it. However, this is what my friend and I are pretty sure she encountered on her deluxe wrap the other day.

We parked our butts in front of Zaytoon Wraps, and The Crepe House.  I went for Zaytoon, and she went for T.C.H.  \n\nOver the battle of the next door neighbors, Zaytoon won.  I ordered the Falafel Sandwich.  Holy shit.  Finders keepers losers weepers, this wrap was at least a foot long and I had to doublecheck my receipt to make sure I didn't order the \"Big ass falafel wrap- finish in half an hour and win a shirt and pic on the wall challenge\".  The wrap had at LEAST 6-7 falafels in it, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, and a tahini sauce that at first bite was unassuming until a second later you're doing the hah-hah-hah! I need water dance w/your mouth.  Top it off w/the great outdoor seating ambiance only Valencia can deliver, a sprinkle of Mission District hipsters, and girly gossip, that for $6.95- will guarantee you another visit.", "author": "Rho T."}

Don't let the smallness of the space fool you, the food packs big flavors for great prices.\n\nThe menu is short and sweet, ranging between 7-8 bucks. The Falafel Deluxe won me over. Crunchy falafels with fresh cucumber-tomato salad, strings of seasoned onions, parsley, tahini AND grilled eggplant! Sans the potatoes I asked to omit so as not to go into a carb-induced coma, falafels and friends were neatly wrapped in a lavash bread for easy delivery to my mouth, then straight into my happy stomach! Now baby, baby, how am I suppose to eat my falafel any other way from here on out? Easily, it was the best I've ever had (and baby's been around the falafel block a few times).\n\nAlternatively, you can opt for a regular falafel wrap here, but why? Go for a chicken or lamb shawerma wrap instead if a vegetarian meal sounds less than satisfying. There's also a combination of favorite Middle Eastern noshings such as (more) falafel, dolmas, and baba ghanoush under the pseudo name Mezza Platter. Since they use only fresh & local ingredients (free range chicken, Niman Ranch lamb, etc.), I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order. Plus, the portions are generous and they give you a little side of olives, mini pickle, and a sweet sesame candy. I can't believe I ate it all in one sitting plus a baklava dessert! I blame my excess partially on their personable service, but mostly on my lack of self restraint from super yummy foods.\n\nAlthough small, the space is clean and cute. To avoid claustrophobia altogether, eat your food on the lovely sidewalk patio seating buffered with flower boxes. It's a great spot for watching the passerby's on Valencia street, while enjoying a tasty Middle Eastern wrap.", "author": "Rina W."}

I found this place thanks to yelp and I'm glad I fought to find parking on a nearby side street to embark on the culinary adventure that is Zaytoon Wraps. \n\nThe restaurant is super small and easy to miss if you don't pay attention. Or you could just follow the smell of fresh falafel frying and yummy shawarma meat cooking. Upon entering, it's a clean, modern space with friendly employees. The menu is really simple with a handful of options like Falafel wrap, Chicken or Lamb Shawarma with a couple sides. I wanted meat but wasn't in a lamb-y mood so I happily chose a chicken shawarma and sat down to wait at one of the barstools at the counter facing the window. \n\nWhile I people watched I was wondering why I was sitting inside since it was such a nice day outside and plenty of public patio seating for both Zaytoon Wraps and the crepe restaurant next door. But being on my own I didn't want to take up a 4 person table outside by myself so I let others enjoy the outdoor space. I was by the door anyways so I couldn't complain. \n\nWhen my food arrived I realized I had a problem....the wrap was GARGANTUAN. I wasn't expecting anything that big but I plowed through and just about finished it. The whole time I was unashamedly dripping yummy juiciness down my face.

You get mounds of lean lamb (perhaps too lean for some who like that lamb fat) and its well complimented by the other ingredients.  Sometimes when I get food from Truly med the tahini sauce is overwhelming, that doesn't seem to happen here, if anything you don't get enough of that tahini flavor.  The mix of onions, cucumber, and roasted tomatoes, is solid but somehow reminds me of a Mediteranian Pico de Gallo and as a result the overall wrap was slightly burritoish.  \n\nThe meza plate was delicious but... we got all these delicious things and only one half of a pita to eat all that humus etc.  This seems like a gross oversight that should be fixed, however the quality and quantity of all the other food in this plate was excellent.  \n\nService is fast and friendly and they even included sesame candies in our bags.  I dig that little extra step of customer service.", "author": "Paul T."}

The Mission has tons of great burrito joints and pizza hand-pie restaurants, but few places to score Schawermas or Falafal hand-pies, so Zaytoon is a welcome addition to the hood.\n\nSo I went in one evening and scoped the menu. Pretty basic, and they don't have any corn/clam combo pies on offer, but what they do have is tasty. I got a falafel hand-pie and absolutely devoured it. The veggies are fresh, the falafel not too greasy, and the hummus not insanely garlicky (hate that). The sizes are pretty good too, which is necessary when you're paying $7 for a fucking falafel hand-pie.\n\nThey have a nice little section offering pre-made hummus and other goodies as well if you're into that sort of thing. Service is fast, friendly, and they take cards, which is great because the last thing I want to do when I'm craving an Arabic hand-pie is walk all the way from 22nd and Guerrero to Mission and 23rd to take out cash at BOFA. And don't tell me to use the ATM across the street at Pride Suprette (ROFL!) because it charges you like $4 fucking dollars and that just isn't coo.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan, and I'm glad a spot offering a new spin on the traditional hand-pie is right around the corner.", "author": "Brent F."}

Wrong! 1 cab ride and a sprint down the block later I ran in the door at 9:04 profusely apologizing for my lateness. The workers were super chill about it, and not even in a \"chill out, crazy lady\" kind of way. I've had experiences at other restaurants where the door would have definitely been locked by 8:55 and the employees wouldn't even open it despite the puppy faces you make through the glass.\n\nSo the thing itself; chicken shawarma, is huge! Like two meals worth of food. The marinated chicken was super juicy and flavorful. The only flaws were that some of it leaked out through the foil wrapping and paper bag and got on my gym bag.

And I've been waiting patiently for Zaytoon's grand opening ever since they first staked their claim on this perfectly located little spot on Val & 23. But alas, looks like I'll have to wait longer for a 'decent' taste of home. \n\nWe ordered the falafel deluxe sandwich, a lamb shawarma sandwich, and a side of hummus and spent $22. Overall it was disappointing.\n\nThe hummus was runny... like it was diluted with too much tahini. Granted, I have high standards for hummus. And the sandwiches looked malnourished leaving a ratio of way too much dry lavash for a small amount of filling.  \n\nAs for the falafel deluxe, all the standard fillings including the falafel were good (just not enough of them) but the eggplant that made the sandwich 'deluxe' was rubbery and lacked flavor. The shawarma was fine -- a bit dry and not enough of it to justify the price.\n\nEven if the place was cheaper, I still would not have been impressed but at this price, I will likely not come back -- even though I constantly crave middle eastern food and this place is so conveniently located. \n\nPerhaps if they upped the ratio of filling to lavash, I'd consider giving it another try...", "author": "Amy S."}

Couldn't even finish it...possibly because I also sampled the Mazza Platter which is an experience not to be missed! \n\nI have one word to say about it....FRESH. Everything is made fresh daily and the Falafel is cooked upon ordering and well worth the extra few minutes wait.  The Tabouli was so very fresh and not mushy or bitter at all. Cucumber salad, Falafel, Tahini sauce, Baba Ganoush, Humus, Dolmas,   Pickles, and of course OLIVES. 5 to be exact and each unique in texture and flavor.  I have a real appreciation for the Baba Ganoush since it is so labor intensive to make and this is by far the best! And you can order many of these items to take home in pre-filled containers found in the drink refrigerator.  \n\nFor all you meat lovers out there....the meat here is excellent quality for this unbeatable price. Like I said earlier, the Lamb is ORGANIC! I have also sampled the chicken and will definitely get the Chicken Shawarma next time.  I recently purchased a chicken wrap & stale tortilla chips at Hobee's  (home of fresh/organic) and for the exact same price ($7.95), you can get a Shawarma wrap at Zaytoons and there is no comparison in quality and flavor for what you are getting! \n\nThe place is small but this is San Fransico right?

It's taste brings back memories of my mother's cooking when I was a kid. \n\nFirst, chicken shawerma. Chicken is soft, juicy, and tender. The combination of chicken and shatta (hot sauce) is like a match made in heaven. Don't worry, for those of you who don't like spicy Zaytoon caters to you too. The sandwich was juicy and the taste was phenomenal. Think I'm exaggerating? Try it yourself. \n\nLamb shawerma. The quality of lamb is top notch. They use Niman Ranch meat, the best quality meats around. Like the chicken, the lamb is juicy, tender, and delicious. That with all the dressings that the chef puts on makes for a great meal that will leave you satisfied for hours. \n\nFalafel. So good. Fresh, fresh fresh. The tahini sauce is great. I usually don't like it but I eat it here. I don't know how else to describe it. Tasty and fresh. \n\nCustomer service. One of the guys behind the counter all the time, his name is Chris, is a very very nice guy. If you aren't sure what you would like because its your first time he will describe the different items and suggest something that would fit your liking. He is friendly, nice, and very efficient. The other people that work are also very nice, but most of my countless trips to Zaytoon have been with Chris behind the register. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend it.

The service was nice and the place although small is really clean.   I paid $11 for a lamb/beef wrap which in my opinion a little in the pricy side by a couple dollars.  But hey at worth it if it's good right?   It's a decent wrap however not what I'm use to.   I'm looking more of a wrap you would find in Greece or even the little cart stands in New York.   The meat was good but really cut into small pieces rather than slithered off the meat stand.   So it kept falling out if the wrap while I took a bite.  The sauce isn't the normal basil yogurt sauce but I'm thinking it's their signature sauce.   Which was really watery and I totally made a mess every time it took a bite into the wrap.  The sauce isn't bad but it's kinda tart like I'm guessing maybe they add a little lemon juice and mayo (dunno I have a feeling this isn't a yogurt sauce)?  Not sure but all I could taste was the sauce which to me was a little salty.  I wanted to taste the meat more like one would if you dug into a steak that was lightly seasoned but didn't get that.   I liked the wrap but didn't love it and for $11 I may not want to come back for something I kinda liked.   I'd much rather go for a restaurant burger for the same price.", "author": "Wendy K."}

I had the Lamb Shawarma and it tasted almost the same as TM.  The size is a bit smaller, but as others have said, that is a good thing.  However, they need to cut down the size of their lavash because its too bready.  Even if it means throwing some lavash away (or lavash chips) it would be better with less.  They definitely win by having olive oil and hot sauce at the table.  Plus they serve Med pickles, which I can't figure out why others do not.  Although these were not the best I've had, something is better than nothing.\n\nWe also had some babaganoush which is basically the same as everywhere else.  Nothing special, but fine.

A unique thing about this place is they order their lamb meat fresh everyday, and do not freeze their product ever. The chef and owner Chris is very forthcoming of information, and will even let you see the refrigeration if you want. Overall, if you are looking for something that is like a sandwich with a touch of awesome, this is a must try. One spicy shawerma and you will go back again and again - just like everyone else.

You'd be better off going to Truly Med on 16th near Valencia or Old Jerusalem on Mission near 26th - even then those places are just OK, this place however is pretty lousy.  I feel bad for those of you who like it, then again ignorance is bliss.", "author": "Z M."}

I spent a chunk of time in the middle east and love me some falafel.  I went with my little 4 year old and ordered him a regular falafel sandwich, no onions, and a deluxe for myself (has eggplant and potato) with a side of fries.  Fries came out first, obviously from the freezer, thick and not so tasty.  Then my boys falafel... i mean wait.... they said it was the regular one but it had eggplant and no onions, though the eggplant was hidden.  Then the deluxe came out, with onions.  Took us a few bites to figure it out, then we traded.  He picked out the onions and I shoved them in mine.\nFalafel was fresh.  That's a star for me.\nThen my friend came, ordered the mazza plate, with a little bit of everything.  Her words \"This hummus comes from a can.  There is no trace of a garbanzo bean\"  Seems that everything on this plate, except for maybe the falafel, was not fresh and came from a can.\nAND why am I paying $8 for this?!?!?!\nBack to Old Jerusalem we go.", "author": "J E."}
