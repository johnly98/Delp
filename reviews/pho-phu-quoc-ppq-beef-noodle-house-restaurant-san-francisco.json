I actually highly prefer going to PPQ over Kevin's across the street.  The food is better, it's less crowded, and it feels less \"manufactured\".  At Kevin's you get your food in about 10 seconds, but at PPQ, there's the still the sense that they're actually cooking your food to order.  The service isn't the greatest, but after you put your order in, you should get your food pretty quickly (5-10 minutes).  \n\nFor about $10, you get a huge bowl of food.  The pho broth is definitely on the better side for San Francisco, and they aren't skimpy with the noodles or the meat either.  You get a pretty sizable portion of meat if you order the large bowl, and most of it is pretty good!  There is a decent amount of fatty beef slices that I prefer not to eat, but other than that I think the pho here is pretty solid and worth it at the prices they charge.\n\nIf you're a Kevin's regular, I would recommend giving PPQ a shot when you don't feel like waiting in line!", "author": "Tim L."}

One was for the beef pho and the other for beef tendons, tripe, etc.  Got the order, opened it up at my friend's place only to find out both were just the beef order.\n\n2)  Years ago when i frequented this place, they were generous with the meat portions.  Now the meats are cut super thin and small and there's barely any in the soups at all.\n\n3)  This is the worst and the reason why i won't returning.  I went into the restaurant for a bowl of pho in the early evening recently and was guided towards a table near the rear.  After i sat down and ordered, i could smell the rank stink coming out from what i assume was their bathroom.  It smelled like a hobo camp of piss and shit and was so horrible i could taste the smell.  How difficult was it to clean the bathroom and if they couldn't, close the bathroom up and spray it with frebreeze??

I used to love getting their curry pho, but it seems to be inconsistent.. sometimes it's spicy with a lot of coconut flavor, other times not spicy and much less coconut. Then sometimes not spicy and too much coconut lol ya know what I mean! It's a mix of inconsistency, but at least the meat is always tender! They use different noodles for the curry pho than regular pho. The noodles used in the curry pho are smaller and usually seem to be cooked a bit too long, making them soft and mushy. I opted for something new and tried the Satay pho, and I actually enjoyed it more than the curry pho. There wasn't anything about the soup that made it very memorable, but it's a refreshing change if you're used to getting the curry pho, and also because I prefer the regular pho noodles.\n\nMy two stars for this review actually comes from the service/cashier. Aside from the usual not-so-kind service, we saw a discrepancy in our total and how much we were charged. Our total for four people was $68 and some change (yes we were hella hungry), we split the check in two cards and were charged $35 each.. but 35 x 2 = 70 amirite?? Unless math has changed over the years\n\nAn extra $2 isn't a huge deal, but we wanted an explanation. If they made a mistake, that would be fine but when we asked the cashier why we were charged $35 each when our total was $68 something, she said \"oh, I thought it was $69.?? so we rounded up to 70.\"\n\nWhat in the!!!!!! Since when did places start rounding up totals?! Even if you thought our total was $69 and some change, THEN YOU NEED TO CHARGE US FOR $69 AND SOME CHANGE. $2 may not seem like a lot or noticeable, but imagine if they charged 100 customers an extra $2, they're cashing in an extra $200 a day!!

My daughter was not unhappy but not satisfied with her dish. There was only three meatballs and there was a few very small slices of beef in her soup. The broth wasn't to her liking, it was heavy on the spice flavor rather than beef flavor and the soup felt heavy and filling, not light and fresh.

It has great value for money and very delicious noodle bowls. It's located on the very active Irving street. \n\nI tried the crispy chicken and loved it. 9/10\nWe also got the pork summer roll from the appetiser list and that was super 9/10. It has a mint addition to the toll which I loved. \n\nI have been back 2 times since and tried the beef satay noodle bowl 8/10 and the chicken curry bowl with coconut milk 8/10. \n\nThe prices are also very good, one bowl medium size ranges from $8.50-$9.00 approximately and this is a full meal. \n\nNote : The portions are HUGE so I always get the medium and not large for myself. \nThey serve hot tea with the meal and it's free of charge.

They have some variety in menu options from curry chicken pho to five spice chicken garlic noodles. It's a smaller space and it can get crowded and their tables are really meant for 1-4 people and not large groups. Service is friendly and the food is good. This is definitely going up there on my list of go to pho spots. They don't have small bowls for the noodle soups, only medium and large. Prices are very reasonable at under $10 and super filling (a medium is more than enough for me). \n\nCURRY CHICKEN PHO\nI'm a big fan of coconut and curry and this definitely hits the spot for that craving.\n\nCRAB NOODLE SOUP\nOr Bun Rieu. I found the flavor a bit underwhelming in this because I wanted a stronger flavor. Still good though. Something to note is that the vermicelli noodles are a bit thicker and firmer than the standard pho noodles I am used to. \n\nFIVE SPICE CHICKEN GARLIC NOODLES\nYou can get five spice chicken pho or garlic noodles although with the pho version, you get the five spice chicken on the side and the pho is just regular beef noodle soup with nothing else in it. Their garlic noodles are tasty and so is their five spice chicken. A little more pricier than a bowl of pho but worth it if you're not craving pho.", "author": "Diana C."}

This may not seem important but it is important to have hot broth esp when you have the noodles at room temperature before you add the broth. Otherwise the noodles stick together and it's not a great pho experience. Also for an Asian restaurant service is great. I always make a few edits to my order and every single time they accommodate my changes and don't charge me extra for making a change. Side note, I usually ask for no noodles and an extra plate of bean sprouts since I am watching my carb intake. And when I bring friends who eat carbs they don't mind putting my noodles on the side for me to give to my friends who want extra noodles. The food quality here is good. I always order the rare beef and tendon or 5 spice chicken. If I am eating carbs my favorite is their pork and egg roll plate. It's so good! The pork has so much flavor and you can tell it's been marinated with a lot of care. My husband loves their spicy beef noodles and curry noodles.

Is it just me or do a lot of places in sf not serve bun no hue and bun rieu?! So I'm happy they have it if I'm desperately craving it, but I was a little disappointed in the taste. Less fishy/ crabby and less sweet than Yummy Yummy's on Irving. Not really sure where I'd choose to go if I was craving bun rieu as neither places really hit the spot for me. The pho was okay, just typical pho. If I wanted that I'd rather go to Kevin's as their pho tastes a little more flavorful even if there might be a longer wait. The chicken wings we ordered as an appetizer were pretty good though. Not too much flavor aside from what a plain chicken wing tastes like, but dipping it in the fish sauce or adding a little salt and pepper made it better.

From his 24+ check-ins at PPQ it's clear he's found something at PPQ he really likes (per his review,  Satay Beef Pho - #5) and I wish I'd read his review before I ordered.  My Pho, Rare Flank Steak & Meatballs (Pho Tai Bo Vien, $8 or $9.25), failed to wow me.  The broth wasn't flavorful and the meatballs were an odd, light color of indeterminate origin.  I was that person doctoring up my bowl with every sauce on the table, not my usual style.  \n\nAround me, every table was taken.  It's true that Kevin's was closed that night but I suspect that wasn't the driver.  I choose instead to believe that diners fall either into the PPQ camp or the Kevin's camp and I'm in the latter.  \n\nThere's a lot of other things on PPQ's large menu.

It's such a perfectly crafted dish, imbued with cultural significance as rich as its broth. My go to here is the to tai bo vien which is the sliced rare steak with meatballs. The place is usually packed and the staff are usually running around trying to keep up with the endless sea of hungry patrons. \n\nOne thing worth explicitly and specifically mentioning is the five spice chicken which is a standout item here. You can get it spring rolls (favorite), garlic noodles, vermicelli, or even with your pho (comes on the side). I haven't run into it at any other shop I've been to but I'll be damned to find somewhere else that does it better. It's always tender and perfectly cooked with a tinge of sweetness to balance the savory flavor. I'd recommend getting the spring rolls as an introduction to it and letting it speak for itself. \n\nNow I will stand to say that the broth is not the most stellar one that I've ever had and that Sac does indeed have some places that I'd say stack up better. But that doesn't mean it's not good. It's still rich its in own right and definitely worth eating any day of the week. And with no callousness, I don't think I'd ever choose Sac over SF for anything, much less just for some broth. lol. \n\nSoup always comes with tons of meat and tons of noodle. You could definitely survive on a small but I always go for the large for a full kick. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the five spice chicken vermicelli and while I can't ever give up getting soup when I come, there may come a day when I go mad and order both so I can enjoy the amazing flavor of both dishes.\n\nHot tea is available on request and I think service is fairly decent, given that I've only been there less than a handful of times when it's not packed to the brim with customers.\n\nAll in all, PPQ puts in the time and effort and I'd like to see someone to present a better place for pho in the city.", "author": "Charles M."}

You can tell not a lot of people work there as a lot of different people assist with each order (your server is different from the person who brought you water or took your order or delivers your food), totally don't mind it because everyone helps each other out.\n\nMy baby sister got the bun with egg rolls and chicken I think, her friends got the curry chicken pho noodles and I got the satay beef pho noodles and all of them were amazing! We also got an appetizer of the beef capachio (I think I spelled it wrong) but it is very similar to a ceviche! The meat was rare with red onions, lemons, green onions, a sauce, and loads of peanuts! Very fresh and very delicious!! The meat tasted amazing and melted in your mouth like butter!\n\nThe chicken curry was delicious as well, it had a nice wonderful coconut sweet and savory flavor and the chicken was cooked perfectly- it tastes like the chicken was marinated in the curry sauce! The bun with egg rolls was delicious too, you can tell the noodles were fresh and the egg rolls were freshly made because it had a nice crispy crunch to it! My beef satay noodles were just as delicious, the sauce was made with their signature PPQ sauce and it was not greasy at all! With each meal, they put a bunch of noodles and meat in each bowl! The beef satay pho bowl was a nice soupy meal for a cold day as the curry chicken bowls were too! If you're thinking the beef satay bowl as similar to bun bo hue, it's not- this one has more of a peanut- chili base as bun bo hur has more of a lemongrass base. Each bowl was about 8.00 or 9.00 but oh so worth it! \n\nAll in all, I am so glad my sister recommend to eat this place! Definitely coming back here for sure!", "author": "Rosie T."}

I was told that the curry pho is delicious in addition to the Five Spice Chicken, so we went.\n\nHe wanted the #1 pho on the menu and said it was his favorite, while I ordered the Five Spice Chicken with Rice and a Taro Milk Tea.\n\nLet me start with the Milk Tea. It was delicious! It came with real Taro (not powder) and little tapioca in the drink! I wished the straw they gave were bigger but it made us take our time with the drink and not down it all at once.\n\nThe Pho was quite good, but perhaps because we took the food to-go, it wasn't as good as it should have been. It was probably not as hot by the time we got around to eating it.\n\nThe chicken though, was well marinated, but not too salty or sweet. And then it came with this mildly spicy vinegar sauce that went very well with it. Remember not to put too much though!\n\nOverall this was a great Pho place and even though Pho is not my go-to dinner place, I would absolutely eat at this place again no question asked! :) Even if I wasn't feeling like eating Pho that day.", "author": "Kimberly W."}

I someone managed to roll out of bed and make it to work and once lunch time came around, my co-worker suggested pho to bring me back to life. I'm never to turn down pho and was hoping some broth would be exactly what I needed. We hopped in the work truck and me our way to the Sunset.\n\nAs we made our way into Pho Phu Quoc, my first impression was that it was small but bustling, which is always a good sign. Fortunately, we lucked out and as we entered we were quickly seated towards the back. The extensive menu has plenty to choose from but I typically always order a chicken pho. I settled on #9, the shredded chicken noodle soup ($8.50), which is hand pulled chicken in chicken broth with flat noodles. \n\nIn addition to the pho, I also shared the Five Spice Chicken Rolls appetizer with my co-worker. The rolls run for $6.95 and are soft rice paper rolls with their five spice chicken, lettuce, mint leaves and vermicelli noodles. With our order in, we sipped on hot tea as we waited for the appetizer to come out. Less than 10 minutes later, the chicken rolls were served and we devoured them before I could even get a shot of them. An order comes with three rolls, sliced into six pieces. \n\nMoments after I took my last bite, the pho came out and I was pleased with my choice to get a medium bowl as the large would of been too much even for me. The pho was steaming hot and was exactly what I needed with my running nose and headache. The chicken was tender, the broth was flavorful without being greasy, and the noodles were plentiful. I did like the combination of flavors but it needed heat and Sriracha was the only hot sauce provided, unfortunately. \n\nOverall, I was pleased with the pho at Pho Phu Quoc but it wasn't as flavorful or delicious as I would of hoped. In the city of San Francisco, you have more than your fair share of options and although PPQ is passable, it doesn't have me rushing to come back. I will say that service was great and the Five Spice Chicken Rolls were a must have, and perhaps next time I'll order the Five Spice Chicken pho. \n\nAmbiance/Decor: 1/5\nFood: 3/5 \nService: 3/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 3/5\n\nPros:\n+ Large selection of pho broths\n+ Delicious Five Spice Chicken Roll appetizer\n+ Reasonably priced \n+ Quick service \n+ Credit cards accepted\n\nCons:\n- Not the most flavorful pho (#9)\n- Only hot sauce is Sriracha", "author": "Alexander E."}

Even though I usually cannot finish the entire thing, I had no problem today... Either I was super hungry or they reduced their portion size... However, today the five spiced chicken arrived quite a while after my noodles. The five spiced chicken was a little oily and one of them had some bones in it.

Tables here are pretty cramped closed together.  I wasn't too much in the mood for pho so I went with the Five Spice Chicken Egg Noodle soup (medium for under $8).  She got the #1 pho with all the goodies.  \n\nI was surprised at how busy this place gets, I mean a pho place with a waiting list is pretty rare.  Finally our soups were served.  Liked how they kept the five spice chicken separate.  The skin could have been crispier and a little less greasy, but it was still pretty satisfying.  The egg noodles were plentiful and cooked perfectly.  The soup wasn't greasy and was flavorful, but a little too herby (star anise?) for me.  As others have mentioned, it is a little pricier than most pho restaurants, but at least the broth is flavorful!  I had a piece of my friend's beef from her pho.  Theirs is cut into strips instead of the rounds.  \n\nI can see why it's popular, but I don't think I would go out of my way for a bowl of pho or noodle soup here.

The dark meat chicken was really flavorful, with moist and juicy meat and a well-seasoned, crispy skin. However, the accompanying beef broth with pho was tasteless. It was extremely bland and needed loads of sriracha and hoisin sauce for added flavor. Many rave about PPQ's curry chicken vermicelli noodle soup, so I may give that a try next time if I were to revisit.\n\nI'm sure there's a playful war between PPQ and Kevin's, with regulars constantly arguing which of the two is far more superior.

Trust, it was not love at first sight, I took time to appreciate this delicious meat compared to all the other joints on Irving.  And yes, I've been to many, like too many.  Anyway, I usually go for number 1, which has everything in it.  I sometimes opt for the bowl with no beef ball because they taste kind of funny to me.  It doesn't have the elasticity of other beef balls I tried.  Or maybe I'm picky.\n\nImperial Rolls - I always order this as an appetizer.  Love their imperial rolls here.  Always crunchy, crisp and a delight to eat.  I usually wrap it with a piece of lettuce, cucumber and a mint leaf and proceed to dipping it in the yummy fish sauce.  10/10 would recommend these rolls!\n\nBeef Carpaccio - tried it once, but fell in love!!! Raw slices of thin beef ribeye meat topped with lime, peanuts, fish sauce and green onions!!!  Didn't think it would taste that good, but the quality of their meat is great and super fresh.\n\nVermecelli noodles -  I liked it very much when I got bbq prok with eggrolls, but this is the dish they did skimp noodles and meat.  I wasn't that full after my meal =/   The quality of everything in the bowl is great, but just wasn't so filling.\n\nPorkchops over rice - Meaty portions of porkchops over rice.  Tasted delicious and not too much fat on the porkchops.\n\nBun bo hue - ehhh... Could be better, not the go-to for BBH.

The Vietnamese restaurant across the street had too long of a line, so we happened upon PPQ. \n\nWe were seated pretty quickly and got to ordering. The restaurant seating was a bit cramped and service was a bit spotty - sometimes staff was very attentive and other times they looked pretty confused coming out of the kitchen. \n\nBut at the end of the day, all I care about is the food. And boy, was the food delicious. I ordered the #1 Pho, and it was incredibly satisfying. The broth had the deep, savory flavors I look for in noodle soup, and the variety of proteins in the soup melded together perfectly. Noodles were al dente without being too soft. Overall, it was a very balanced, delicious, and satisfying bowl of noodle soup, something that I am constantly on the search for.", "author": "Olivia T."}

My server (didn't catch her name) did everything with a smile, even refilled all of the guests' water!\n\nThe place was lit. Literally. You can see it from the other side of the street, from Kevin's Noodle House. Since Kevin close at 9PM on the weekend, we decided to give PPQ a try and I'm glad we did. Their #1 Special (The-Everything-Combination pho) was sooooo good. Broth was perfect. Meat-to-noodles ratio was fair. Their medium bowl was around $8~ but it sure filled me up.

Same goes for the bun rieu broth. While PPQ may have better quality beef, it is also about 2$ more than kevin's, which is not worth it. The bun rieu was mediocre. There was a ton of noodles in the bun rieu and not much meat, but for 10.25 it still wasn't worth it. \n\nOverall, I would stick to kevin's for beef pho since their broth taste much better and it is also cheaper.

We were a short stroll from 19th Avenue and Irving, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to try Pho Phu Quoc since we both like Perilla a lot. That's the mini-chain of Vietnamese restaurants that shares the same owner. This pretty standard-looking place looks to be just as popular - although we were lucky to catch it in between waves of dining packs.\n\nPho Phu Quoc doesn't have quite the same menu as there is a greater emphasis on - big surprise! - pho, as we saw a lot of slurp-worthy bowls on the other tables around us. Jamie impressed me by ordering the $9.50 Papaya Salad with Shrimp, which was quite refreshing after a long afternoon at the park with julienned papaya, basil and carrots topped with poached shrimp, chopped peanuts and fried shallots (see photo). It was a nice mix of textures and flavors - crunchy, sweet and slightly savory. We followed this with a $6.75 plate of Imperial Rolls, three of them deep-fried, cut in half and stuffed with ground pork, taro, shredded carrots and silver noodles with a ramekin of puckery nuoc mam sauce (see photo).\n\nNot so healthy a choice but delicious nonetheless. We both went for the $9 rice plates for our entrees which come with a bit of a side salad and more of the nuoc mam sauce. Jamie ordered the Charbroiled Pork Rice Plate, which was very much like a plate you can order at Hahn's Hibachi (see photo). Foolproof and tasty but not terribly unique in execution. Mine was more unusual, the Shredded Pork, Charbroiled Pork & Baked Egg-Loaf Rice Plate, a combination plate of savory carnivery with the egg-loaf a frittata-like creation that must surely have Gallic origins (see photo). Quite good with a good variety of flavors. We'll definitely make a return visit when we're in the 'hood, probably to try the pho. People were really slurping that loud and clear.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good, sturdy, no-frills Vietnamese well executed\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...standard-looking\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...fast and furious\nTOTAL - 4 stars...worthy fare if you're in the area", "author": "Ed U."}

I love the soft rice noodles, the hearty broth, and just the saltiness of the dish. So when I went out of San Francisco and tried other places, I was just thinking that it isn't as satisfying as this place right here! This is definitely my go to place. I'll come here pretty often for my pho fix. With that being said, let's jump into talking about the service and food quality!\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE/AMBIANCE: this small restaurant is located on Irving. Isn't the most convenient place for me, but you can take the 28 and get dropped off right near it. It's a pretty humble size, but I've never been when it was super packed. I get seated right away, and they usually let you just choose a place to sit. I get a menu and they offer tea at no extra charge, which is nice. I only get pho here, haven't tried the imperial rolls here, but I want to try! Waiter/waitresses here are pretty nice and understanding. Recently I decided to try and customize my meat combination, and they happily did so with no trouble. So I like that a lot! The waitress I usually see there always refills my water and checks in on me. She's very nice! I think the one thing that cracks me up is hearing 96.9 KOIT on the radio they play while I'm eating. Nothing is better than listening to Kelly Clarkson while slurping on my meal! Haha. There are always chopsticks, spoons, and condiments on the table. Would rate ambiance 4.5/5. Not a full rating since I just feel like the women at the cash register aren't the friendliest. However, nothing is super horrible about the vibes from this place. I come here for the delicious pho! Let's talk about that real quick. \n\nFOOD QUALITY/PRICE: When I first started coming, I would get a medium #1. However, i don't really fancy tendon or tripe, so instead now I get the well done brisket, flank steak, and meatballs with thin noodles and beef broth. It's DELICIOUS. Not sweet like some other places I've been. It's nice and salty, and very filling. I add some mint leaves, lime, and it's amazing. Seriously one of my favorite places taste wise. Overall, I end up paying under 10 dollars for my pho since that's all i get. However I tip pretty generously, so usually I end up paying around $11.50. I'm going to try their imperial rolls soon, since many seem to enjoy them!\n\nOverall, this is a great find. However I've always been curious about Kevin's noodle house across the street here. Might try it, and update on which one I prefer. However I feel like I'm so attached to this place. Keep on doing good stuff PPQ. 4.5/5!", "author": "Kiki C."}

I never ate in the restaurant itself.  \n\nSo after my roommate raved about PPQ & their Coconut Curry Chicken Pho, we both decided to phone in a to-go order about an hour before they closed. The guy who picked up was basically a \"get to the point\" kinda guy & hung up. Our other roommates were already on Irving so conveniently we had them pick up our food.  About 15 minutes later, we got a call from my bf saying that they had run out of the coconut curry broth. REALLY? I honestly don't get what they expected us to do... get there & realize they were out and have us wait even longer for a new, different order....? Like brehhhh---but whatever, no big deal. We both ended up ordering 2 orders of the garlic noodles, 5 spiced chicken, & imperial rolls.  It came with a side of fish sauce with some red peppers or something in them. Anyways, I was pleasantly surprised because the order was HUUUUGE & I was not expecting such large cuts of chicken! I know PPQ & Perilla are owned by the same people, but for some reason I felt like Perilla's garlic noodles tasted better? The noodles were a bit on the greasy size, but I still ate most of it. Ha! The chicken & imperial rolls were also pretty tasty, even better with the fish sauce.  Overall, I enjoyed the food, but I would've preferred less oil/grease on our noodles & wished they would have given us more a heads up about a Coconut Curry Pho. Some guests wouldn't be as chill as me, so eventually that kind of practice might catch up to them. I will be returning though--hopefully dining in!", "author": "Julie Ann B."}

Basic everything. You can find these dishes in any other Vietnamese restaurants so there's really nothing special. My boyfriend's friend raved about this place literally every time I see him so I was curious to see what he was talking about. He told me the imperial rolls and coconut curry are the only food items that I needed to order.  \n\nOf course, I don't listen to his coconut curry recommendation because I do what I want. Lol just kidding. I was not in the mood for curry that night, and a light dish such as a pork vermicelli sounded appealing. My boyfriend got pho and ordered the infamous imperial rolls. Food came out super quick. Looking at both of our dishes, there was no love put into it at all. Literally, they threw crap together and called it a day. I was pretty appalled by what my dish looked like because I've been to countless Vietnamese restaurants and I've never seen such sloppiness. The pho barely had any meat. All I saw my boyfriend eating was hella noodles, which is not okay. Additionally, I had to flag down the waiter to give us the bean sprouts which should come with the pho from the start.\n\nOn top of all of this, the imperial rolls never came. The imperial rolls are an appetizer, which should come before our main dishes. Hence the word appetizer. The pho came out first, and I already had the feeling they forgot about our imperial rolls because before I knew it, the pork vermicelli noodles came out next. When we made a point to our waitress about not receiving the imperial rolls, she did not give any sort of apology and really, did not give a crap. Ummm.....good bye. Now thinking about it, I totally regret leaving any tip at all.  \n\nNext time, I'll give this place another chance for their curry and imperial rolls for the sake of our friend, but if it weren't for him, just no. We would have been better off at Kevin's right across the street. What an utter disappointment.", "author": "Veda T."}

(just my two cents) - regardless, the Pho is worth it - great ingredients in simply rice noodles and chicken.\n\nAlso of note - their breaded Calamari and Imperial Rolls - both outstanding - the breading and cut on the Calamari is unique in that is it a very healthy cut of Calamari steak bites vs ringlets and the breading is WOW - crunchy, flavorful, and damn good!

I ordered Bun thit noung change gio, which is vermicelli served over a salad with grilled pork or beef with an egg roll. Although the egg roll and meat were cooked well, the noodles were a bit too stuck together and they did not nearly give you enough fish sauce on the side for pouring over your food. Also the fish sauce itself is far too sweet and too salty. The pho here, is decent, the broth could be better and the portion isn't great.

We came with my in-laws for a quick bite and scored a serendipitous parking space right in front so I thought we were in for a treat.  Kiss of death would prevail as it was a full moon out on Friday the 13th and the meal itself, at least my own bowl of pho, was disappointing at best...\n\nI was looking forward to ordering some pho tai gan which wasn't on the menu but a popular enough dish elsewhere that I thought I might be able to order on the fly.  As soon as I tried the waitress gave me a dull \"what are you talking about\" look.  Ironically, I wound up ordering the #2 Pho Tai Nam Sach, and yes, I thought of pulling a Jack Nicholson and tell them to hold the sach.  I noticed that the large bowl is only a dollar more than the medium so I went with that and it was a pretty prodigious sized bowl of noodles.  Famous for their certified Angus Beef, it was pretty shredded when I ordered it on the side.  The noodles themselves were initially very clumpy which is a pet peeve of mine but fortunately the broth was served hot enough where it wasn't an issue to loosen up, particularly since I ordered the tai on the side because I like rare beef to actually be rare.  The broth though lacked the beefy depth that I was looking for, in fact I doubt it was beef-based at all, it tasted more like chicken.  They gave us the usual Thai basil, bean sprouts, sliced chili, and lemons instead of limes but they were pretty miserly about it as we all had bowls of pho and they didn't provide any extra garnishes to account for the four of us...\n\nMy sister-in-law ordered the five spice chicken in her pho which I guess PPQ is known for;  I didn't try it but it reminds me of a brick chicken with a spicy coating.  We also ordered an order of Goi Cuon Chay or Veggie Summer Rolls which came with a soy vinaigrette dipping sauce.  Not bad, just ok...\n\nEveryone else seemed to like their bowls of pho, so perhaps I'm the one who was picky.  I usually go to my beloved Pho Filet 2 in San Gabriel once a week to satisfy my pho cravings so I guess I'm going to have to wait til I get back from my vacay and hope I don't have withdrawl symptoms.

When I tried calling a waitress to take our order she completely ignored me. I was waving at her and she just stared off into the distance. My friend to,d me that we weren't in her section but as if I'd know which section belongs to who. She could've at least told me that someone else was going to take our orders. We placed our order with our correct waiter and our food came between 5-10 min after that. \n\nI ordered b2 imperial rolls with five spice chicken vermicelli for $9.25. It was pretty good. The five spice chicken was sooo good.The imperial rolls were super crisp and delicious. I thought the noodles tasted pretty much like every other vietnamese vermicelli that I've tastes. The one thing I was a little disappointed with was that this place didn't have that chili flakes in the oil condiment that I love eating and so I had to make do with sriacha and hoison sauce. \n \nAfter getting the bill and and paying, we waited for the cashier to return our change but she didn't and I guess decided to keep it. I get really annoyed when cashiers do this and they think we tip when we pay. It really makes me not tip people when things like this happen. In the end we just left because she just kept the $2 extra. Oh well she just got less than 10%.

Frankly, my low score is due to one main factor: service was outrageously horrible.\n\nIt was pretty empty for a Saturday afternoon, so we were seated immediately.  My mother's been talking about their curry chicken noodle soup for a while now.. apparently, it tastes like this Burmese soup my family loves.  What a disappointment... the soup was extremely oily and there was way too much coconut that it completely overpowered the curry.  In addition, they used flat rice noodles... it just didn't go well with the dish at all.  \nScore: 2/5\n\nNext, I saw pictures of the crab meat noodle soup on Yelp and knew I had to try it.  I was totally in love with the previous crab meat noodle soup I had at another Vietnamese restaurant.  This was probably the main dish that I was excited for.  Guess what, they got my order wrong and brought out a nasty starchy egg-drop-like soup with broccoli... WHAT IS THIS?!  I've never seen this dish.. ever.  I saw maybe one or two tiny pieces of crab floating around... \n\nI kindly asked out waitress what it was... this was definitely not the noodle soup I ordered.. where were the tomatoes?  the crab?  the noodles?!  Impatiently, she said this was what we ordered and said no exchanges.  Great.. we had to pay for this disgusting thing when it was clearly their fault.\nScore: 0/5\n\nOh, and I forgot to mention, the owner was just sitting towards the back giving me the most evil glares from the minute I walked in.  After the little situation with our waitress, she walked over to her and presumably asked what happened (I assume because they were staring and pointing in our direction).... uhg.. it made me furious! \n\nI tried my grandmother's 5 Spice Chicken dish too.. So grossly oily..  \nScore: 0/5\n\nNeedless to say, I'm totally not happy with this place and would never go back.  It's understandable if there was a language barrier and they didn't understand what I was ordering.  But I ordered in Chinese.. and they still got it wrong.\n\nNo thank you.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

The Pho bowls came out after waiting some time, with the rice plate no where to be seen for ten minutes. We asked someone to check on our order, and without even asking what we ordered she quickly gave us a generic, \"Okay 5 minutes.\" We reminded about the egg rolls a few times and didn't come out until we were absolutely stuffed and finished with our respective bowls and plates. We had to take the egg rolls to go, which made them inedible, for we all know, left over egg rolls aren't the same...\n\nThe two (large size) bowls of Pho are super huge and filled to the brim with broth and noodles.

Let's also remind ourselves here that Pho is sold primarily by street vendors and is targeted towards the poor in Vietnam. I have eaten pho in Vietnam and its significantly cheaper than most other dishes you'll find; the same should translate to Americas standards. Instead, we have made pho trendy causing the prices to hike for such a simple dish. This is where Pho Phu Quoc steps in and rears its ugly head. \n\nThe service was quick but inattentive. The tea was hot. The pho tai was standard... nothing special, at all. minimal meat, brick-like noodles. so-so broth that i had to douse in siracha (good broth shouldn't need much/any) And... drumroll... $8.64 for a medium bowl BEFORE TIP.  W.t.f.\n\nYou re better off going to Kevin's across the street for a better soup in a bigger bowl for a cheaper price.

On the multiple occasions I have been here, the server has taken a while to refill water, never asked how the food was for us, and would often sit around unless called upon by a table. I must admit that I do like the pho from Kevin's Noodle House across the street better than PPQ, and if I'm going to get pho from inner sunset I will most likely go to Kevin's. What will bring me back to PPQ, however, is the word on the street that their curry pho is really good.

It was really good, though I felt like it was more like a dish that would go with rice than a soup with noodles. The portions were perfect and when I couldn't finish a meal, they made sure to separate the soup from the noodles to prevent the noodles from expanding and absorbing all of the soup!\n\nHowever, the only problem with this place is that their service is extremely poor. Every time that I've gone here, it seemed like during the duration of my stay each visit, their service would get worse. Initially, they would be available for all questions and make sure you were ready to order. Once you placed your order, however, it's like the entire staff does not see you anymore. By the end of the shift, you even wonder if they remembered that you have yet to pay for the bill. \n\nOtherwise, the food is great, and if you don't mind being super thirsty when your water runs out, and waiting a while just to pay, go get some pho!

We got seated and waited a good 15-20 mins just for someone to come up to the table. The place was not packed either. The waitress then took our order. We got part of our food and did not receive plate to eat it on for about another 10-15 mins we had to wave down the woman 4 times. She stood around staring at the customers instead of helping them. Then after the second part of the meal was on the table she then decided to bring our drinks. After we were done the meal we sat at the table for another 20 mins waiting for the check after that we just went up to her for the check because once again she was just standing and staring.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-12-27", "description": "I always order one of two things when I'm at PPQ - it's either #2, Rare Beef, Tendon, & Tripe Noodle Soup (small $5.25) aka Pho Tai Gan Sach or Five Spice Chicken Rice Plate with jasmine rice ($5.95) aka Com Ga Quay Chao.\n\nWhen I'm craving pho, #2 is my staple.  I think the only difference between #1 and #2 is minus the beef balls.  And yes, I need to load all the sides into my hot soup as well...the bean sprouts, the jalapenos, the lemon juice, and the rest of the green stuff.  And I always use the red Sriracha hot sauce and the plum sauce for dipping.  (I don't squeeze it into my soup like I know others do.)\n\nThe problem with the rice dish (for me, at least) is that it comes with a HUGE helping of rice...probably the equivalent of two rice bowls.  And when I'm eating that chicken and using the dipping sauce...I can't say no to the rice.  It doesn't matter how late it is or how hungry I'm not, I just have to eat my white rice with that yummy as hell five spice chicken.  And what makes it even more special is that not all Vietnamese restaurants have a five spice chicken dish.  So, sometimes you just have to forgo the pho and get the chicken and rice!\n\nService is basic if anything.  Last night, my rice dish arrived a good while before my friend's pho dish arrived.  You had to wonder if they were killing the cow out back since it was taking so long.  Usually pho comes out first, but not in this case.  I was halfway done with my meal before any signs of her soup arrived.  \n\nI like how they have the napkin dispensers out because if you're like me and when you're eating pho, you need hella napkins.  One is for the mess you're making and the second reason is for how often you need to blow your nose from the heat of the Sriracha sauce.  \n\nI rarely ever stray from those two, and sometimes I'll even throw in a Vietnamese ice coffee to complement my meal.  But if you catch me there, odds are you'll find my face buried in a bowl of hot soup or stuffing my face with rice.  \n\nSidenote:  I once got a real bad case of food poisoning from here.  It was January 2003, I ordered #2 and my three other dining companions also ordered pho as well.  The only difference was that I used all those side things and no one else did.  I had a real bad case of it - the shakes, the fever, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.  It was coming out from all ends.  And yes, I do know it was from there because that was the only meal I had that day.  I conclude that there was probably some cross contamination going on.  So, you ask why do I still bother going there?  Well, percentage-wise...I've eaten there a lot and it was just that one time.  Plus, I attribute my severe reaction to my body readjusting after spending some months abroad.  It's never happened again...from there, at least.", "author": "Teri C."}

The #1 PPQ Beef Noodle Soup has all the goods - I get it sans tripe.\n- The Imperial rolls are perfectly fried and not at all greasy.\n- If you sort of wanted Mexican but got conned into Vietnamese, get the charbroiled pork wraps and pretend you're eating an Asian burrito. \n- This is not a place for a romantic first date - it's a place to get your grub on; the ambiance is what you'd expect from a pho house in the Sunset - bright lights, kitchen-style tables/chairs and Asian-motifs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-19", "description": "Been coming here since I was in high school so nostalgia befalls me for 3 stars.  It's more of a 2.5 for me.  I was also here last week when I had no other option later in the evening.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are a bunch of PHO'real jokes out there already so I'll skip that however tempting it might be. Props to Ringo M. newly Elite yelper for the Fergie reference calling it PHOgalicious. I see you. \n\nLet's start off on a good note and to the point (PHO jokes aside) with what you should order because I wouldn't come here if I didn't have to.\n\nGo for the curry chicken noodle.  If you are anything like me and love some fresh aroma and flavor added ask for extra onions and cilantro to brighten up that light tasty curry. The curry isn't strong and pungent like that of an Indian style of curry and not super sweet like that of a Thai curry.  It's more in the middle on both ends of smell and taste.  The pleasant and subtle sweetness of the curry soup is thanks to the coconut milk they put in there.   There's a much better spot for this on Noriega but over here this is on the top of my list.\n\nThe five spice chicken is alright here. They always use a marinated dark meat so it always comes out juicy and tender.\n\nYou can't go wrong with the appetizers like the fresh spring rolls and egg rolls.  Any restaurant that can manage to screw this one up is a failure.\n\nThe 3 stars for this review is because I personally don't like their pho broth as much as other pho spots. Beef soup of the pho is the star of the show here and yet it falls short.  I ordered the Pho Dac Biet aka Combination Beef Noodle Soup.  A little more on the bland side with not much going on.  What I mean is that you can taste a soup that has been cooking for hours on end creating depth of flavor in the soup base from its ingredients. Then there are some that just seem like it has been cooking for the minimal amount of time needed to get it boiling lacking depth, and rather monotonous to the taste.  Keep in mind that although I speak in terms of depth, most restaurants would load up the MSG so it's hard to say what they do here.  I love a good soup without the MSG if possible. Nonetheless there's gotta be a great base before all else. Some of my friends like their soup so I'm sure it is a preference thing.  For me I want some love in my soup.  Whoever it is behind that range stove should be making love to my soup for hours before it even gets to me.  No love here.\n\nBring floss if you are going for the ox tail.  A nice tender ox tail needs to be  braised properly also with a little bit of love.  No love here either.  The ox tail is rather tough, fibrous, and surely lacking flavor.  If you happen to try it out anyway and didn't bring floss, you're in luck... they have plenty of toothpicks. Take full advantage of those.\n\n2 stars for their service.  A little slow side most often times.  We could be sitting there for awhile and still no one comes to take our order just like last week.  There's also this one girl that always has this funny attitude.  It's hard to ask her anything because she expects us to know every detail on the menu as a customer.  She's been there working there forever so I had a few instances of that.\n\nI'd very much rather head 6 blocks down to Yummy Yummy for better service, variety, and depth of flavors or to Quan Ngon on Irving for better soup bases.", "author": "Colin M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-11-02", "description": "As far as the overall quality of food is concerned, I'd rate Pho Phu Quoc between 3 and 4 stars.  The imperial rolls and charbroiled beef wraps is what kept me coming back to this place for over a decade.  The level of service is where they lost me as a long-time customer.  There are two separate situations that motivated me to try out new restaurants.\n\nThe first instance was where I ordered the Ox Tail \"with\" potatoes and carrots in a savory sauce.  The savory sauce was there, ox tails, but no potatoes.  When I received the dish, I really didn't eat much of it.  I explained the situation to the waiting staff, and showed the description of the entry on the menu.  \"I ordered the Ox Tail, and as you can see here your menu says \"with potatoes\".  However there are no potatoes?\"\n\nThe response from the waitress was a blank stare with really no explanation for the missing ingredient.  Considering I ate very little of the dish I was expecting at least some sort of concession to be made.  Nothing was offered.  After some insistence and pressure on my end, they finally agreed to remove the entr\u00e9e from the bill.\n\nThe second instance of poor service was when I ordered two items for pick up.  After driving across town to pick up the order, it appeared nothing had been processed.  I indicated I had spoken with a man over the phone who according to the lady at the register had never received my order.  They offered to take the order right then and there while again not offering any sort of concession for the miscommunication.  I declined the order and instead went to the restaurant across the street. \n\nI understand that mistakes can happen, but the response should never be a blank stare, especially in the restaurant business.  I've decided to find another restaurant for my occasional imperial roll craving.  Perhaps it's a language barrier.  Either way, I feel the level of service at this establishment needs major improvement.  If both situations were handled with a sense of courtesy and respect, I'd likely still be ordering meals here.", "author": "Frank T."}

Affordable, fairly consistent, and efficient to an extent. Not the best, but at least we know what to expect.

Somehow this place jives right with them, kind of like your favorite haunt that hipsters, foodie wannabes, and many others hate because of other criteria, but somehow memories, sentiments, that one particular decent dish that appeals to you, and things misunderstood by others except you, make you enjoy this spot.\n\nSure it is not San Jose, Orange County/Westminster Vietnamese. And you can order in Cantonese without getting WTF looks. Perhaps the Vietnamese food nerds and pho snobs prefer 100% Vietnamese stuff (or fusion overpriced crap) and don't like Vietnamese Chinese approaches even if average?\n\nThere's another pho place across right the street.

Talk about an easy no fuss deal that doesn't compromise taste or quality.\n\nFirst up are the imperial rolls and chinese chicken salad. The rolls are thick, hearty, crispy, and ready to be dipped in their special sauce. (There is Hoison sauce & Sirachi available as well.) The salad blends well with cabbage, tender slices of chicken, nuts, and light (definitely NOT overpowering) dressing.\n\nNext up are the bowl of garlic noodles and your choice of Roasted Crab or Peppercorn Crab. The Peppercorn is my FAVORITE of the two. It comes out deep fried, seasoned perfectly with garlic, onions, salt & pepper.  The crab is awesome and meaty. (Be sure to ask for a side of vinegar.) The garlic noodles are a PERFECT complement to the crab. They are not full of grease, like from other places, and for extra crunch & seasoning I top them with the baked garlic and onions from the crab entree. Mental note: Don't forget to wear your bib!! Cracking crabs get messy!\n\nLastly, the fried banana and 2 scoops of coconut and mango ice cream. The sweet banana is deep fried with a light syrup base, and paired with both flavored ice creams.

I judge a bowl of pho by the quality and tenderness of the beef, and the first time I came I was not blown away. In fact, I remember it being chewy, mealy, and overdone.\n\nA friend of mine recently recommended I try their Chicken Curry Pho and substitute the chicken for rare steak. People, this is seriously as good as it gets. It's getting to the point where I crave this curry pho just as often as I crave regular pho. The beef that they put on the curry pho is sliced so thinly, and comes in the bowl rare (which is a must have in my book). Tip for the curry though: Stir the beef around when the curry comes hot, as the curry broth does not cook the beef quite as fast as regular pho so make sure you get it all cooked in the beginning.\n\nAnother tip: You can get the curry with either pho noodles or vermicelli. I prefer the vermicelli. One time they didn't ask me and just gave me pho and it was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nI've had the Viet coffee before too which is also excellent!

My boyfriend and I decided to try it last Sunday night--what a mistake.  We were sat and given menus and after five minutes a waitress, who seemed friendly enough, came over and asked us what we wanted.  I was hemming and hawing a lot, also my boyfriend had never had pho before so we told her we needed a bit longer.  Probably 20 minutes later, another waiter finally came over and very rudely took our order.  I was planning on ordering a drink but was so taken aback by his rudeness/apparent disdain for us (gave him the benefit of the doubt and figured maybe he was just busy) and decided to wait to order it when he brought the food.  \n\nI got asparagus and crab soup and a tofu salad and my boyfriend ordered the ox tail pho.  He basically just dropped all of the items on the table and ran away.  My salad was okay--the tofu was tasted fake and overly fried but the dressing was pretty good.  The soup, however, looked like chopped up asparagus thrown into dish water.  It tasted bland and flavorless with no discernable sign of crab (I wouldn't mind if they scrimped on the crab but it was $8).  My boyfriend's dish looked like ramen cooked in beef broth.  The ox tail was so tough and undercooked that he couldn't even eat it--LITERALLY because neither of the waiters came back over to us to ask how things were and didn't give us silverware or even water.  There was no way this meat was coming off the bone without a heavy duty knife.  We were pretty angry at this point because plenty of other tables had water and silverware, and if the staff was so busy, they wouldn't all be staring into space or looking at their smart phones near the counter.  \n\ntl;dr: Horrible service, incredibly rude staff, food is terrible, do not eat here.", "author": "Kate R."}

While standing to wait for our table, I saw a couple tables that had big bowls of what looked like spicy soup, not the typical pho I've had elsewhere, and I wanted to try it. The menu didn't have pictures, though, so I had to guess (or ask the waitress, but that's less exciting).\n\nI guessed right by ordering the Curry Chicken Vermicelli Noodle Soup. It was delicious, and the medium size was plenty for me (I was solidly hungry; 9/10 on the hunger scale). My friend got the Veggie Combo Noodle Soup, large size, and it was too much for him (he said he was quite hungry, too, so order wisely).\n\nWe originally came here on his recommendation, but the Veggie Combo soup wasn't up to par. The broth tasted a little bland, and broccoli pieces were HUGE, as were the tofu chunks. Why not chop them into something closer to bite-size if the only utensils your customers have are spoons and chopsticks? The chunks of chicken in my curry soup were also on the large side, but they fit in my spoon and were quite tasty. My soup was spicier than I expected but still in the \"good spicy\" range.\n\nOur soups were served with the typical plate of bean sprouts and basil. Hiding beneath them were a couple lemon wedges and two or three slices of (I think) jalapeno pepper. The sprouts and basil seemed fresh, and they complemented my curry soup well.\n\nThe prices and service were both quite fine. Tea was served quickly, and one pot lasted us almost the entire meal.

Ironically I had not actually gone out to try out some of the places in the neighbourhood until this week. It took my getting sick to venture into the cold to get some of that yummy goodness. \n\nI asked around before going, and even Yelp'd a few places before giving PPQ a try. I ordered the medium #9, Shredded Chicken Noodle Soup (Pho Ga Xe Phay) to go.  I didn't mind the wait as I love to people watch. The restaurant seemed cozy and I am thinking of going back with some friends for a sit-down meal there and try out some of the other things they have to offer.\n\nWhen I got home, I found the broth was separate from the chicken, noodles and cilantro. Smart move. There was also a bag of sprouts, lemon, jalapeno, and basil along with that really yummy spicy sauce. The broth alone is sweet and the chicken and noodles cooked perfectly.  Add in the condiments, and you have a bowl of Heaven. The spicy was perfect to help kick this cold in the butt, and because you have control of how much chicken and noodles and spice, you don't have to worry about having a ginormous bowl of spicy soup that you can't eat, if you can't handle the heat (I can!). \n\nThe medium was perfect for 2 meals and I am so glad I finally gave PPQ a try. You can even phone ahead for pickup. It's a rather casual place, where you can bring a group of friends, and it is within walking distance (as are most places around here) from the bars or other areas of attraction.

I used to write in a food blog, but then I realized that Yelp was probably a more appropriate forum for these kinds of food essays, so I'm slowly going through the process of transferring my blog posts to Yelp.  \n\nAnyway, here we goes.  A blast from my writing past, but still relevant to the food community, I suppose:\n\nOne of my favorite joints for a simple bowl of pho or Vietnamese food in San Francisco is PPQ Restaurant on 19th Avenue and Irving in the Outer Sunset. You can always locate it as you're walking down Irving St. because it's got a cardboard cut-out of a large cow standing in front! Suh-weet! They straight up tell it like it is. I like that. Honesty.\n\nSo, this joint serves up your standard Vietnamese fare, including bowls of pho, vermicelli and rice plates, egg rolls and spring rolls, and other noodle plates. The prices are very reasonable, ranging from $5-$8 for a generous entree, and the atmosphere is casual.\n\nIt's pretty fun to go here with large groups, because it's one of those kinds of joints.  Noisy and unpretentious.  I dig. \n\nRecommended dishes:\n+ Five-spice Chicken with imperial rolls. I've never had this, but apparently, this is one of the signature dishes at PPQ.\n+ When I discover a certain food that I like at a particular restaurant, I tend to become a creature of habit and order that dish over and over again. Charbroiled pork with egg rolls and chopped peanuts on top of vermicelli with a bowl of fish sauce!  This is one of my favorite dishes at Vietnamese restaurants, and I often get it because I know it will be stellar wherever I go.  The charbroiled pork is cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of charred taste and tenderness. The egg rolls are always perfectly crispy. I've never had a bad egg roll in this dish. It's a safe and tasty choice! MMM! And at PPQ, it's #15! I recommend!\n+ All their phos!  Are excellent!  I mean, they're all pretty standard, but still all excellently made!\n\nNow, let's sing a song!\nT to the\nA to the\nS T E Y\nFood\nYOU TASTEY\nT to the\nA to the\nS T E Y\nFood\nYOU TASTEY\n\nANYWAY.\n\nAnother good thing about PPQ is that it's located on Irving Street, which many consider to be the \"New Chinatown.\" Not nearly as crowded or historical as San Francisco's Chinatown, Irving Street is where the local Chinese-American community go to get their hair cut, to eat out and grab a cup of tapioca (naw, we don't call that stuff \"boba\"! that's only for the SoCal crowd), to buy their groceries. There's a good mix of cute accessory and stationary shops, grocery stores (Sunset Super on 25th and Irving), Asian and fast-food restaurants, hair and nail salons, many bakeries, and even a Bay Area/Frisco merchandise and clothing store. The local high school kids at Lincoln and Lowell High Schools also come here to hang out and eat after school too, so expect to see lots of loud crowds of happy kids.\n\nAfter you fill yourself up with a hearty lunch at PPQ, you should definitely stroll down Irving and grab yourself some tapioca and walk the calories off.\n\nWalk it off!\n\n-Vivian C., circa 2007", "author": "Vivian C."}

Definitely just a place to go when you're drunk and in a pinch when Pho Kevin across the street is closed (exact situation that drove us there). The prices aren't ridiculous, but definitely pricier than Vietnamese food should be. Both the vegetarian rice plate my friend had and the vegetarian pho I had were just basic noodles/rice with a bunch of bland tofu, baby bok choy, and broccoli dumped over it.

PPQ!\n\nMy brother is the King of Pho, and when he mashed his way to PPQ upon our return from Half Moon Bay, I knew we would be in for a treat!\n\n... I recently dubbed Pho the Gio as my favorite Pho spot, but it's over... I am returning to PPQ today just to eat the Lemon Beef and try something else out on their menu!  \n\nI am now officially no longer a Lemon-Beef Virgin.. I've watched my brother eat this before at  Pho Ha Tien on Ocean Avenue, but it did not look visually appealing and the beef just tasted \"gamey\" to me... He's been raving about this for some time now, and I knew that if he drove us all the way to SF just to eat  when we could have easily hit up Gellert Square for lunch, my cousins Sheila and JR and I would be in for a treat.\n\nAs soon as we entered the restaurant my eyes began to wander at everyone else's food.  I could already see that the portions were huge and the quality of the food was to my standards!  I was equally shocked that my brother did not order Pho and instead selected the Curry Chicken Soup for JR and himself.  When someone strays from a norm, you know whatever they chose is going to be good! Sheila and I opted for noodle dishes and both ordered sides of chicken soup!\n\nWe did not wait too long for our food, and upon serving us the Lemon Beef, my excitement escalated to PURE JOY!  The color of the beef was rich and the presentation with the crispy fried garlic and peanuts made the whole dish more appealing to the eye!  Jason mixed in the house special sauce and 2 slices of Lemon, gave it a stir, and within minutes I was already planning the next time I would be eating this dish and all the people I wanted to enjoy it with!\n\nMy BBQ Pork over Vermicelli was also outstanding!  There was also something about the rolls and the crispiness of the shell that I really loved.  I also tasted Jason's Curry Chicken Soup order which was also delicious.. it had the perfect balance of coconut and curry!\n\nI kept thanking my brother all day for taking us there... I could see myself ordering the Lemon Beef with a side of noodles the next time I go... So simple and so good!\n\nDoes anyone know if they fry their own garlic or can I buy that in a bag somewhere!?!?! OMG SOOO GOOD!\n\nPPQ YOU OFFICIALLY PASSED my QUINT-ESSENTIAL PHO REQUIREMENTS!!!\n\nPs: the Proudly advertise that they passed their February 12, 2009 Inspections with 90 Points! Good For You guys!

Can you please take the dumpster out when customers are not around??\n\nUnfortunately my bf came here religiously. So there would be occasions where I would reluctantly return. The final straw for me came one night through the dinner of a couple next to us. Randomly, the woman next to us started pointing at her dish and showing us. We took a look and it was a LIVE SLUG! I'm talking about at least 2 inches long, disgusting, slimy, alive. I wanted to throw up right there. They took the plate back and I'm pretty sure the couple got a free meal. Now when I've explained this story to others, I've been told that this could happen anywhere because most restaurants neglect to wash their greens before serving them.

Why now? Why PPQ? I've been to the best pho places in town, and I always order the same thing. I'm so predictable. I always order the number 1. It's a repetitive yet pretentious habit.\n\nTonight, things changed. I ordered the number 7. What is number 7 you ask? It's the noodle soup with five spices chicken. They serve it on two separate dishes so you can decide the fate of the chicken, they leave the meat drowning to you. Well, the bean sprouts definitely took a dive with the leaves, and peppers. But the chicken had to be savored by itself.\n\nGood service? Sure! Too bad they don't take American Express, but that's expected from most asian restaurants. Heck, if I had a restaurant I'd be cheap too. =P\n\nBut hey, where's the dessert?

A plate of bean sprouts, basil and sliced jalapenos was brought to the table and almost immediately after that came my gigantic bowl of pho.  I'd estimate the wait was less than 2 minutes.  The piping hot chicken broth was clear and I could see a mountain of rice vermicelli sitting in the middle of the bowl.  Shredded pieces of silvery lettuce floated on top of the flavorful broth, which featured fish balls, fish cake, tender slices of calamari and firm, butterflied shrimp.

I love adding sriracha in my food, jalapenos in my sandwich, once in a while I also cook a killer spicy chicken tikka masala at home.\n\nThe food has been going downhill since a few months ago. A few months ago I came in for the curry chicken noodle, and was so disappointed I didn't come back until a few months later. NOT SURE if PPQ switched chefs or what, but food does not taste the same anymore.\n\nI used to love this place so much. Used to come here for dinner once every 2 weeks, and there was evan a point where I came once a week at some point in time, when the chef of PPQ was consistent with their chicken curry noodle soup.\n\nThe past few months, PPQ has not failed to disappoint me as a regular. Service as usual was great, but the last 3 times I've visited, the chicken curry noodle soup tasted terrible. \n\nLIST OF SCREW-UPS (All on different days):\n\nFirst screw-up: the noodle soup was SPICIER THAN USUAL. Normally the soup is spicy but perfectly balanced with the perfect amount of coconut milk and chicken stock. I had to take water breaks between eating the noodle soup, which made it less enjoyable. Still, not bad, but not as good as last time.\n\nSecond screw-up: Not sure what it was about the soup, but flavor was completely off? Still, this wasn't enough to prevent me from coming back. I thought maybe I just came in on a bad day. I'm a relatively forgiving customer.\n\nThird screw-up: Came in with my boyfriend last week. WAY OVERSPICED!!!! My boyfriend is Vietnamese and the Vietnamese can HANDLE SPICY FOOD. That was how spicy the curry noodle soup was. The waiter was even kind enough to give us both two big bowls of chicken stock to add in the soup. But evan then, STILL so spicy that we needed to drink a lot of water in between! Not the delicious kind of spicy, but the \"wrong measurement\" kind of spicy. It totally killed my palate. \n\nOn top of that, the next morning, both my boyfriend and I had upset stomachs and my face developed many red tiny bumps (which for me means that there was an extreme amount of spice in my food). First time this happened with PPQ. \n\n**I really hope the owner realizes that their curry noodle soup flavor is not the same as before and make some drastic changes with the chef/kitchen staff before they lose more loyal customers.** \n\nTil then, I'm taking a LOOONG break from PPQ.", "author": "Ree W."}

I was quite disappointed. First of all parking here sucks, we had to circle the streets like vultures. Second, the gentleman at the front desk was not very friendly. The whole time we were there I didn't see him crack a single smile. He didn't even greet us when we walked in. He just asked \"how many?\" I'm not sure if he's running the place or not but he definitely didn't have that warm hospitality vibe. Also, while we finished our first order of noodles and waited for our second I felt rushed because they kept asking us if we wanted to go boxes. The place wasn't even packed so I can't see why they would be so eager to get us out.\n\nThe two of us ordered 2 portions of garlic noodles, garlic eggplant, and shaking beef cubes which came out to $50.\n\nGarlic Noodles: Fairly small portion for the price (hence the reason why we got 2). The noodles were quite dry and not very garlicy. I thought the one from Crustacean was much better (it wasn't dry and had all the buttery garlicy goodness that you would expect from garlic noodles).\n\nGarlic Eggplant- This dish was the best of the three. It was flavorful and garlicy and the eggplant was cooked just right, not too mushy. \n\nShaking Beef Cubes (Bo Luc Lac)- this dish wasn't all that great. It didn't really taste like the traditional vietnamese one I'm used to. Perhaps maybe because it's run by Chinese people that the dishes have more of a Chinese influence rather than vietnamese.\n\nVerdict: For $50 (none of which was even for seafood), I feel like I could have gotten better food elsewhere.

PPQ's pho is triple in price compared to the ubiquitous chain Pho24, and it's probably even far more expensive when compared to street stalls.  However, the quality of the beef is superior.

Like some others have noted, the Five Spice Chicken here is the best you'll find almost anywhere.  The pho is also great.  Love how this place lets you have the option to change the noodles and the soup as well.\n\nThey meat that they use here is higher quality than all of the other places around.  It's very tender and has none to very little pieces of meat that are tough and rubbery.  Rice places and Vermicelli are better than the actual pho here, but the pho is still very good.  I go for flat noodles every other time and sometimes go for the curry soup also.  Imperial rolls here are good also.  Five Spice Chicken pho or the Rare Flank and Meatball pho with meat on the side are my 2 usual orders.\n\nAs far as the service goes, its very fast and usually pretty good except for these 3 or 4 times (in a row) where I asked for flat noodles but they gave me the regular pho noodles... No biggie I guess because I was in a large group during those occasions.\n\nWhat I don't like though, is how small this restaurant feels.  They cram so many tables and chairs to fit as many people as possible, that there's hardly any room to walk around without your crotch or butt in someone's face.  Also hate when you wait for a table, and more and more people come in trying to wait right next to you. You end up having 10 people crowding the door, making it impossible to get outside without everyone having to go outside.\n\nAll in all, food and location are why I go.  Close to Wonderful Foods if I wanted to get tapioca right after.  Price wise, it's just barely more expensive than Kevin's Noodle House right across the street, but for a reason (because the food tastes better).", "author": "Kevin K."}

I've always touted it as my favorite pho in the city, and I've tried most of the usual suspects.  \n\nSo, now that we have kids who are willing and able to try more interesting foods, we took them to PPQ for a little early dinner.  \n\nGot there around 6:30 and got a table right away.  Decor has been cleaned up a bit, but they can use some new tables and chairs.  We ordered both the fresh spring rolls and the Imperial Rolls.  Both were good.  Full porky flavor to the Imperial rolls, albeit a tad greasy.  Standard spring rolls were a little bland, not enough herbs and too much noodles.  \n\nWe got he grilled shrimp plate for the Z-man (child 1 aged 6) and the grilled pork for ms. Cheese (child 2 aged 7)  They were straight forward well seasoned and tasty.  The pork was a little under caramelized but the shrimp were yummy.  The particular Jasmine rice they use at PPQ is always a notch above other places and cooked perfectly, which is something most places don't get credit for.  Ms. Cheese commented that it was some of the best rice she's ever had.  (Agreed)\n\nWe got a #4 rare beef and meatball pho and a chicken pho.  They forgot to bring the beansprouts/veggies on the side so had to ask.  (Staff at this place has all turned over it seems in the past year).\n\nThe meat was scarce and cut in very small pieces - not so nice.  They changed their meatball spec which was down right not good.  The chicken pho was clean and the chicken had a good full chicken flavor.  Overall the pho did not live up to the many enjoyable years of eating here.

The French controled  it when they colonized the rest of Indochine until they were defeated in 1954 at Dien Bien Phu in Laos by Ho Chi MInh. \n\nThe Americans controled it during their Vietnam War, and the Cambodians took it after that., but then the Vietnamese took it back when they defeated the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot the murderer. \n\nNow it is a tourist destination with beautiful white sand beaches and hotels, with mostly fisherman and the production if fish sauce. They plan to have an international ariport soon, and build it up as a grand tourist destination to the likes of Phuket, Thailand. \n\nPerhaps the Chinese influence of the Island carries over to this restaurant, or maybe because it is in San Franciso, but I didn't think it was very Vietnamese. Everyone working there when I ate spoke Cantonese and acted Cantonese, from the waiters, the cooks, and the cashier. \n\nThe Pho Tai Bo Vien (beef noodles soup with rare beef and beef balls) also tasted more Chinese than Vietnamese. The broth  flavor was bland, with out the hints of key Vietnamese ingredients you find in authentic Viet Pho places. \n\nOn the plus side, the Large bowl is very Large, with a lot of noodles., but average or perhaps below average in  quantity of the Tai and Bo Vien beef. \n\nAnother hint of its Chinese influence: all the decorations are Chinese with Chinese writing. Also some of the dish offerings don't seem authentic Viet, more of a mix with Chinese. \n\nSo if you want Chinese-Vietnamese, go here.

And like the other commenters say, their pho itself isn't the best, but they advertise using Harris Ranch meat, and you can taste the difference. kind of...\n\ni also suggest their imperial rolls and their lemon soda. they literally squeeze the lemon in front of you while they're making the soda, so that's always nice.\n\nThe service leaves much to be desired.

It reminds me of eating fried quail x 10, because there is more meat and it is flavored really well. The skin is slightly crispy and it comes on the side, so it won't become soggy in your soup. Vegetables included bok choy and a few carrot slices.

Is there a stash of spoons, chopsticks, and napkins at the table for you to get on an as-needed basis?\n4. Do you order by number because you can't pronounce the item (and the wait staff has to look at the menu to recall the number when you order by the item's name)?\n5. Is the restaurant run by Chinese people?**Validity in trial stages of research.**\n\nIf you answered \"yes\" to all of the above questions, you may be in a passable pho place. What does that mean? It means that for those who don't know any better (such as myself), the food is decent but you have no idea whether it's authentic VIetnamese food. The fact that PPQ is run by Chinese people and has a largely non-Vietnamese customer base may indicate the food has a Chinese twist. But again I wouldn't know since I also like Slanted Door, which probably also isn't the most authentic Vietnamese you can get in the city. \n\nAll the items I've tried - pho, vermicelli, rice plates - are decent or passable that I'd come back to eat because it's cheap and decent. I wouldn't tout to others that it's the best Vietnamese food I've had though. Oh and you come here to eat and just that. The service is tailored for that function only. You probably won't get refills on your water unless you ask. They service staff isn't rude or anything but you'll only see them initiate contact with you when you're seated to give menus, when you order, when your food comes, and to give you change.

You can't go wrong with anything from here, pho, rice plate, or vermicelli. I ordered my usual, the Five Spices Chicken rice plate. My cousin got the same chicken except with vermicelli and Imperial rolls, and my aunts got pho. The food here is inexpensive yet fulfilling and delicious, but who knows how much MSG they use.\n\nThe restaurant is getting old and it could use a makeover, but it does its job. There's not much decor inside. The servers are kind of nonexistent, especially if you're sitting in the corner facing the front windows of the restaurant: they're the kind of servers who would give you your first kettle of tea, take your order, and drop off food. Then they just fall off the face of the Earth, and you'll need to get up and walk to the counter to get your check or a box.\n\nIn the end this is the best place I've ever encountered for Vietnamese food, and I've been returning here for years. I do wish they would improve their decor and customer service, but if you're ever in the Irving area searching for a bang-for-the-buck place to eat at, PPQ is always a safe bet.", "author": "Felix C."}

The chicken curry pho I ordered, basically tasted like a thai chicken curry with the coconut juice, thrown into soup. It was okay, a little oily for my taste tho. The spring rolls we're pretty delicious, although it was nothing spectacular. A small bowl of pho was about 7 bucks, and the spring rolls were about 5-6 bucks. Again, pretty average.\n\nOverall, it was just an alright experience. Nothing special about this place at all. I think the place across the street was a tad bit better in terms of flavor.

The first taste you can really taste the Saigon cinnamon. But then I don't know...after a while of tasting the soup the flavor dies away. It needs salt.\n\nThe service was horrible.

Most of them have a rich clear broth and rice noodles as the base, to which any combination of the following meats can be added:  Flank stank, brisket, tendon, 5-spice chicken, meatballs, tripe, seafood.  The broth, meat and noodles are quite tasty on their own, but the fun (or phun!) part is doctoring up your bowl with all sorts of goodies.  Waiters bring a plate stacked with bean sprouts, sliced chilis, fragrant thai basil and lemon wedges.  Each table has bottles of Siracha and Hoisin sauce too.    \r\n\r\nMy only gripe is that the rice noodles sometimes come in one big clump at the bottom of the bowl.

Granted it was right by the door, which can get rather drafty, but I had my jacket so it was tolerable, and I knew I got lucky, as a lot of other parties stepped in after I got my table.\n\nAfter a quick perusal of the menu, I picked the #1 Large.  (duh!)  It came out within about 5 minutes.  I looked at the huge bowl, spotting thin slices of still raw meat atop of the steaming soup.  Somehow I knew this was gonna be good.  I let the meat stay on top, knowing that it would be plenty hot and plenty tender when I got my eat in gear.  And it was nice and tender -- even the pieces of flank, which I'm usually wary of being rather chewy at other pho places.  And the tendon was soft, could slice it with a fork.  \n\nThe only possibly 'bad' thing was that I totally underestimated how much noodles they would give me.  I ran out of meat long before I ran out of noodle.  Oh well, lesson learned.  Maybe I should order more meat next time.  Top notch pho for your dollar!", "author": "Gerald C."}

He sat down an ordered a large something-or-other.  An old, world weary though still spry with his tongue, man came in also and ordered a small bowl of something or other.  And two women with two violent little girls came in too.  Since the women were asian, I couldn't tell to whom the future husband beaters belonged.  \n\nI ordered the pho tai and the imperial rolls.

Just a few minutes before the soup, but not so long that I lose my patience and burn the roof of my mouth again.  The soup was the right distraction to allow the imperial rolls to cool down from their volcanic heat.\n\nPho Tai: the beef they served was all in strips.  Long, inch wide strips.  They were marbled too, so it was not too lean.  And there was a decent pile, but it was strips.  Not sheets.  Not good.

Their portions are huge - it's often difficult to finish a small bowl.  When I get my bowl of rare beef pho, I stir a swirl of Sriracha (\"rooster sauce\") and Hoisin sauce (the dark-brown slightly sweet sauce in the unmarked squeeze bottles).  A handful of bean sprouts, basil leaves, and a squeeze of lime make it complete.  The shrimp rolls are mouthwatering and very fresh-tasting; they come with a deliciously tangy peanut sauce.\n\nThe restaurant has never been less than bustling, and there is little on the walls to dampen the noise level.  Bathrooms are less-than-stellar, but serviceable.  They no longer serve beer, which is a disappointment.  If you like your food spicy, their Thai iced tea cuts the fire very well.

I came here following the buzz about the Imperial Rolls and Five Spice Chicken.\n\nBoth the ambience (there's actually a paint scheme and a skylight!) and the prices elevate this place from the status of \"dive\" to more of a cafe (though you can take comfort in the fact that it's still cash only).  Imperial Rolls are definitely way better your average egg rolls, though I didn't bother to look up what was actually in them.  I ordered the Five Spice Chicken \"rice dish\", which to my surprise wasn't a fried rice dish but several large strips of chicken with rice on the side.  It's not particularly spicy but it's very flavorful, cooked with the skin on like an asian duck dish.\n\nAnother must-try here is the Vietnamese Iced Coffee.  They bring you out a little contraption in which hot water is dripping through espresso grounds into a cup of sweetened condensed milk.  Then when it's done you pour it yourself into a glass of ice.  Super strong, creamy and sweet...incredibly addicting but far too skimpy on the portions.", "author": "Wes M."}

Even without all the oil, the broth is still pretty flavorful.\r\n\r\nSome of my favortie dishes to order here are the Beef Pho, 5 spice chicken, sizzling platter beef with lemon grass, and the tender greens or asparagus.

I am usually very laid back about whereever I eat, and think that most restaurants taste pretty good. I am also a big fan of pho and honestly can't really remember ever complaining about any pho house I've been to. However, this is the first time that I have been shocked at the quality of this place. How did it even get this many stars on Yelp??? I felt totally tricked because that's what lured me there in the first place.\n\nAbout the pho: Very very very very bland. I am a huge fan of broth and their broth is probably the worst ever..so bland. Even when I add sriracha sauce, it barely did anything to the taste. Just became water + sriracha sauce. They also totally skimped on every topping. I also asked for them to add tendon, and then they forgot. It took me forever to flag them down to tell them they forgot, and finally they came back with this tiny tiny sauce bowl with like..3 tiny slivers of tendon...in WATER..and it was hard as a carrot. I was so annoyed by this point. My bf's pho tasted equally nasty. For the first time in my life, I left a restaurant barely touching my food. It was that bad. And I was soo disappointed.\n\nConclusion: Go to Turtle Tower. Their broth never disappoints!!! Or just go to King of Noodle down the street. They never disappoint in portion and quality.

Pho broth is tasty and soup sizes are decent for both large and small.   A friend of mine told me once that Pho should be evaluated by how much you don't need to add to the soup, and maybe that is why PPQ has consistently given me a really small bean sprout/mint leaf/lemon/pepper plate for two people getting soup.  Unfortunately, my GF loves bean sprouts, which often leaves me with none.  If you have more than one person ordering Pho, then ask for more of what you want. \r\n\r\nFor rice plates, the bbq pork here is one of my favorites.  The five spice chicken is just ok, and here, I like it better in the soup than with rice cause' the 5 spice flavor is not very pronounced.

It's interesting, this green piece of paper. It appears that many restaurants have it pretty well hidden. To find it is a scavenger hunt. Perhaps this is what they do to keep you entertained while you wait. In this case, the hunt had a clue but no answer. We looked everywhere! The inspection score was nowhere to be found.\n\nWe had a party of 8 that eventually grew to 11. Every table was packed and there were a few other people waiting, but they somehow managed to make enough room for all of us to sit down. Wanting to get away from my usual vermicelli dish, I ordered the BEEF STEW with RICE. It was delicious! The beef was tender and flavorful. Attached to each piece of meat are tendon pieces (as there should be, my mom later told me). I am not a fan of tendon, but even without eating about  1/2 of my dish, I was still extremely full. For those of you who are ordering pho, be warned that the SMALL bowl is quite large as is. Most of the guys at my table ordered the small bowl, and it was just right. \n\nBig portions at tiny prices ($6.95 for my dish). The food came fast. Service is non-existent, but expected. Due to our earlier failure at finding the inspection score card, I was a bit on-guard all through dinner. My eyes scanned the room more frequently than usual as I was nervous about finding a roach or another critter of sorts crawling on the walls. Thankfully, I did not (although that doesn't mean they are not there--i just can't say for sure). \n\nWhat I did find was that they were cash only. Good thing it costs less than $10.

I will share with you my little secret: you can order it with pho noodles instead of vermicelli for a nice variation on the usual texture & flavor.  The waiters are accustomed to this substitution, so don't worry, they won't look at you funny.  \n\nOther mentionables are the imperial rolls, vegetarian spring rolls and the 5 Spice Chicken, which you can order as a side to your other dishes.  I am not crazy for their pho -- I find the broth lacking and often watered down.  Sometimes it can be good though.  You just have to catch them on the right night.  Speaking of night, my meal is for some reason 8 times better when I eat here at night, compared to lunch.  My curry chicken soup has been fraught with flavor and texture problems when ordered at lunch.  I also find it is more crowded at lunch, especially weekends.\n\nAttention purists: the herb plate a lot of times comes with lemons, not limes.  I know, what a travesty.  Don't ask me why they do this.  That's just how they roll.  Doesn't bother me though... lemon actually goes better with the #8 than lime.  And with #8 on the menu, why order anything else?  So maybe if you are finnicky about having lime in your pho, this might not be the perfect spot for you.\n\nP.S. if you get cold easily, try for a table in the back as it can get a little drafty by the front door.\n\nConclusion:  a happy return to 4 hot cocks", "author": "Molasses C."}

The flavor of the broth wasn't all that great today, some days it's good, sometimes not.. i guess it's a hit or miss. \n\nThe Egg Rolls tasted really divine today.

I had never tried pho and figured it couldn't be more amazing than posole or gumbo.  \n\nAnyway, I found myself at PPQ one night recently when el bf decided that I should finally try it.  I wasn't quite sure what to order, so I just picked the five spices chicken soup.  Ha!  Some soup.  I wasn't convinced!  I just received a soup with chicken broth with a bunch of rice noodles thrown in, served with a SIDE OF CHICKEN.  Uh, no.  I am not going to add stuff in my soup.  They should have put it in in the first place!  I scoffed and declared pho overrated.  My bf cautioned me and said to give it another shot sometime.  \n\nWell...I did... at Yummy Yummy.  That awful cold snap in early January drove me to eat anything that was piping hot.  That time, it wasn't that bad, so I decided that PPQ was worth another shot.  So, we were back at PPQ celebrating le bf's birthday, which happened to be about a month later from the first time I was there.  This time, I got the spicy chicken curry dish and MAN, was I won over.  This time, I was served an aromatic bowl of semi-sweet and spicy curry with tender pieces of all-white chicken meat and the most pillowy potatoes I have ever put in my mouth.  This one was most definitely a winner.  \n\nSince then, I have found myself thinking about their glorious pho.  I tried other curry pho, hoping I could relive the magic, but they failed.

My friend kept telling me to order a five spice chicken dish before we got there, and so I ordered the imperial roll and five spice chicken vermicelli.  Their menu also offers the five spice chicken with either rice or pho.  But I was in the mood for vermicelli.  My dish consisted of a big bowl of vermicelli with, well, imperial rolls and five spice chicken cutlets.  The vermicelli was made just right.  I wasn't sure what was in the imperial roll, but it tasted like taro.  That was very good.  But it was the five spice chicken that made the dish great.

So, when I returned to SF, I had sort of acquired a taste for big bowl-fuls of pho. \n\nSo, I've been on a bit of a quest, searching for the best pho in the city. And so far, this is my favorite. Turtle Tower's broth is a bit bland for my taste, and I prefer condiments. Other spots in the Tenderloin have sort of fallen short overall, and Tu Lan isn't really a pho spot. But PPQ make a lovely heaping bowl of pho, and you can order extra raw beef on the side, or - even better - simply order the five spice chicken pho. This is my absolute favorite. \n\nThe five spice chicken pho comes with beef broth and the crispy  boneless five-spice chicken leg is served on the side. This means you can dip the chicken in the broth while still keeping the fried yummy bits crisp. They also serve all the pre-requisite condiments (basil, sprouts, chiles and lime). \n\nTrue - I love Vietnamese food so much that I visited Vietnam last spring just to try the pho from the motherland. This is good basic Vietnamese street food - nothing fancy - but the best pho had the warm tasty broth, just like PPQ. The atmosphere here is vaguely sterile - typical for your cheap Vietnamese restaurant - and the menu is extensive (I typically get the green papaya salad and the spring rolls, too, though these are pretty basic and not worth the Inner Sunset trek). \n\nOverall, I'm still looking to try Yummy Yummy across the street (while in Vietnam, I learned you never say \"Yum Yum\" since it has sexual connotations; \"yummy yummy\" is preferred) and the newly opened Pot de Pho, but in the meantime, this place is great on a rainy afternoon.", "author": "Chrissy L."}

Stir up the noodles, find all kinds of goodies underneath, like sprouts, mint, peanuts, pour on the vinegar sauce, then slip the chicken on top. Takes a while to eat, which is good for a hangover. Their broth is nowhere near as good as Yummy Yummy, so I stay away from the clear pho and go with the bun.\n\nAs others have suggested, curry pho is also life-affirming. Haven't seen it much elsewhere, coconut milk base, reminds you of Thai food, very addictive.\n\nPlace is incredibly popular, try to come off hours, like mid-afternoon on the weekend. If truly incredible pho is your thing, and you believe it starts with the broth, like me, then this maybe isn't your place. But the five spice chicken really is superior, and you can even order just a plate of the chicken.\n\nService is brisk and impersonal, not a place to linger unless you're with a big group.

Too bad they don't speak Vietnamese (!) and they don't use the wide noodles. But I can't find those noodles anywhere else either. Bad experiences mean you probably went late at night or at a slow time. Despite the quote I had to share (below), I believe the most auspicious times for restaurant pho are morning and noon. What you doing ordering a rice dish at a pho restaurant, foo? Vietnamese cuisine is highly specialized, like the ancient craft neighborhoods of Hanoi. Vietnam II for bun cha gio thit nuoung. Anh Hong for 7 kinds of beef and table-top grilling. Thap Rua in the Tenderloin for pho ga (chicken pho). Thanh Long for crab. That place on Larkin where all the construction workers go for Vietnamese sandwiches. Le Soleil used to have an exquisite banh xeo (crepe) but I haven't been there in years.\r\n\r\n\"Morning, noon, afternoon, evening, late night, anytime is a good time for a bowl of pho. During the day, having an additional bowl of pho is like brewing a second pot of tea when the company is enjoyable; almost nobody would turn down an invitation to a pho shop. And the beauty of it is that pho makes it possible for a poor man to treat his friends without breaking the bank.\" \r\n-Nguyen Tuan, Canh Sac va Huong Vi Dat Nuoc (Scenery and Flavor of My Country)", "author": "Katrina D."}

We also had the pork spring rolls, they weren't my absolute favorite, no specific reasoning behind that, I think we would have been happier with the shrimp ones.  I had the pork vermicelli dish, lots of mint and greens under rice noodles, topped with delicious grilled pork.  It was really tasty with the siracha hot sauce and some fish sauce poured on top.  The BF had the chicken curry in clay pot.  YUM, it was a generous portion of wonderfully seasoned curry with loads of white meat (ie. identify able cuts of chicken).

I'm not really a big fan of PHO but my boyfriend & our friends took me here a few times & I'm already starting to crave it! If you look through the menu, there's a lot of appetizing entrees. THE main reason why a lot of my friends go here is for the five spice chicken! It's just cut up pieces of chicken but the seasoning makes it worth while. It comes with rice, tomatoes, or cabbage. If you're feeling cold, I suggest you get the five spice chicken pho -- PHO & five spice. My main dish is Curry soup Pho with five spice on the side :) TRY IT, at least once you won't regret it. Also, try coming in before 10pm so you won't have to wait 'cause seats go fast. I did give this place four stars only because the service is really dull, they just ask you or order ... give it to you & never return to tend to you about any needs (water, napkins, forks, & etc).

Here, like the movies made by M. Night, suspense of disbelief is in order.  Yeah, I mean that routinely when I now start writing reviews of good Asian restaurants.  Service is not the main thing to write about here, right?? \nEverything that I've had here has been terrific.  All my friends who have been here have enjoyed their plates of 5 spice chicken or good bowl of pho.  Some have even slurped up the entirety of the soup and broth in the curry chicken noodle (I won't point out who right now).  Obviously, I like the place a lot.  Reminds me of my grandma's cooking and places that I go to when I return to L.A. for Vietnamese food.  \nBut if you're looking to enjoy some exotic food at a good price range, please bring at least four stomachs (by that I mean friends) to the table when you order the carpaccio (perfectly seasoned with Vietnamese spices and garnish).  It's enough for 4 peeps, but too much for two as Paola and I have found out twice :)  If not that, imperial rolls or even the calamari is pretty tasty.\nGo there and eat now!\nps they now accept credit cards.", "author": "felix c."}

You should judge a good Pho by its broth. With the colonial French influence, Properly made broth should be cooked like consomm\u00e9, with beef bones and other vege/herbs, chilled and de-greased, and then reheated to serve with the Pho. The broth here is decent, but nothing close to a real good pho. \n\nThat said, their pho is one of the better ones in the area, and the place is always packed. The cold weather of the sunset and lack of better pho around probably contribute heavily to that. The rice dishes are okay here, but not as good as across the street (Pho Hua). \n\nThe service here is mediocre, but at least it's reasonably clean. \n\nBottom line, it's better than most pho places around that use MSG or instant bouillon, but if you want a truly good pho, go somewhere else.", "author": "Paul C."}

I'm a pho fanatic so I was excited to find a good place (it had been recommended to me by a vietnamese friend so i had high hopes to start out with). The place looks like and is run like your standard pho/vietnamese restaurant. Bare, basic, no frills, that's fine. But the pho? Was really bland and honestly, not that good. They didn't even give me cilantro to add, just basil and the other sides. Plus, there were no other spices in the broth like onion or garlic, which really does make a difference, just plain ol broth. My hubby's coconut milk soup was yummy, hence the notch up to 2 stars. I took the rest of my soup home because I couldn't finish it and as i type this, the leftovers are stil in my fridge, which is a rarity if I like a dish. OH!

My pho had only type of veggie (chinese broccoli) but the tofu tasted fresh.

Upon arriving home, I fell into bed and didn't wakeup until 11 hours later. For the rest of today, I felt tired. So far, I'm having two types of MSG reactions: 1. Severe headache or 2. Immediate sleepiness. Woke up thirsty. Also, J informed me the bathroom was not clean. Bill for two including 20% tip was $24.There is a Vietnamese restaurant next to San Tung a few blocks away whose veggie pho I prefer.

Okay, I have been to this place a few times, and I haven't been impressed with their service or food.  I will give this place 1 kudo however, but then it is downhill from there.  The only positive I find about this place, is that it's open until 11pm, and for some reason I always find my tummy rumbling late at night, so this was a desirable attribute to me --- the food however -- NOT SO MUCH!!  My favorite pho dish is the well done beef brisket, but theirs is riddled with nasty fat and rare meat. I know usually the meat will cook in the broth, but the pieces of meat they put in the soup look like discarded meat you would give to your dog. GROSS!!!!  Anyway, I know that you can't judge a place based on the first time you have eaten there, so I tried ordering the pho a second time. Unfortunately, I ordered the spicy pho, which was so spicy you couldn't even eat it with a full glass of water, and the noodles were way overdone. The only semi-positive meal I had at this place was the 5 spice chicken pho -- which was just okay.  After getting my inedible meal from the waitress, I asked for a plain bowl of pho. She basically found the smallest bowl in the place and filled it with just noodles, and a tiny bit of broth that immediately soaked directly into the noodles, she just placed it on the table and didn't even ask us if that's what we wanted, just assumed. Who just orders a side of vermicelli noodles, and overdone vermicelli noodles at that? -- a la Celeste\r\n\r\n********************************************\r\nSkip this place, you can find better pho places in the city that are just as affordable.

This thing can't be killed with a swat of a slipper (requires at least steel toe boot).  I must really like this place b/c we actually send it back and order another one and yes, we ate the replacement.  Funny thing was, we got takeout and my typically super anal girlfriend actually scooped it out and pondered for 1/2 a second as to whether we should just heat up the noodles and eat it with some consideration that heat kills the germs of insects.  Either that or we would give it to her father to eat.  I mean, it's like a 2 mile drive and difficult to find parking and we were hungry and...  She didn't say it, but I could see it in her face and she could see it in mine.  Not \"that\" good but \"good enough\" to actually ponder that thought for a split second.   They did give us our money back and replace our food, and yes, we still ended up eating food from there and yes, it was pretty damn good (though neither of us was able to finish the food b/c the image of the floating insect lingered).  So we gave them a mulligan.  And yes, aren't i lucky to have this girl?  Honestly, this place is good, as the long line outside waits and I don't want to shut down a well-liked family restaurant.

My personal favorite is the five spice chicken pho... it's almost as if i get the best of both worlds..i want five spice chicken bun and a bowl of pho.......... gracias. not the best pho i've had in SF, but definitely has a clean taste. Good for one of those days you have a headache and it's cold & you need something to warm that lil belly ballooning from SF food up...", "author": "Jeannette L."}

That place has more selection, better prices, and overall tastier pho. I come here for their roast pork in clay pot. That dish is amazing! Unfortunately, I don't think it's on the menu anymore. Since then, I have been able to order it once and not the other time. I hope they bring it back. If you're reading, bring back Roast Pork in Clay Pot!!!", "author": "Luke F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-09", "description": "For many years our favorite Vietnamese restaurant has been PPQ. As regulars, we tend to order the same dishes - the curry chicken vermicelli soup (a very spicy, complex soup with white tender pieces of chicken and spices); the beef papaya salad; and the crab-tofu ball tomato based soup. The imperial rolls are savory. Looking around, it seems that everyone has their favorite 'regular' dishes - and people eat with great enjoyment, including ourselves.", "author": "Tamara F."}

The service is fast and friendly, and they know me well enough...maybe because I almost always order a large #4 with asparagas and a soy milk. But occasionally I go wild and order a #2 or maybe a beer. ;)", "author": "Mark M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-09", "description": "The pho here tasted mediocre, I had better. Service was ok, atmosphere nice is laid back and nice (kinda loud but which pho place isn't like that?), I did get burn on the face with broth (another story and not the restaurant fault) . My only complaint is that its own by chinese  (maybe thats why more chinese go here than viets?). Doesn't really taste authentic. I guess to me pho taste better when it's made by vietnamese people. I also think that they could've done better with the 6 dollar bowls. Other places you get a whole lot more stuff in it for the same price.", "author": "Thu-Nhi D."}

I had the 5 spice chicken rice plate and thai tea. It was AWESOME. Thai tea was a bit sweet, but it had ice, and I LOVE ICE! I love chewing on ice, but I have to stop chewing on ice since my parents had to dish out 1k to pay for my root canal(that hurt like hell), because I chewed on ice too much 0_0! Yeah, well anyways good food and good pho:)", "author": "Lola Y."}
