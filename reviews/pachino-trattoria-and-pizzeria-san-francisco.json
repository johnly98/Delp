The bucatini was entirely overcooked and stuck together like mush. I wondered about the sauce, given its mysterious sticky yellow texture, if it was actually cheese or some other alien substance. I don't think it would be an exaggeration to say that this was the worst pasta I've ever had. A 10 year old could have made a better plate of pasta.\n\nClearly this was not an isolated incidence give that another user also had a similarly poor experience. Impossible that this is a 4 star restaurant. \n\nGuy at the counter was unfriendly. I'm over it.", "author": "Isabella S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-29", "description": "There's nothing worst than spending the time and the money and walking out of a restaurant feeling unsatisfied.  NO WAY this is a 4-Star Yelp restaurant.  Both food and service are awful!  Take a look at the pictures: watery pasta, burnt pizzas, thickly crusted ravioli...  THERE's NO WAY THIS IS A 4-star YELP Restaurant.  You've been warned.  This place is a joke.\n\nThis is s small local restaurant in SF on Kearney Street, kind of a hole in the wall and tucked in between SF Chinatown and Financial District.  The restaurant seats probably no more than 30 people inside and they also added a couple of outdoor tables stretching the seating to the max.  There are only 3 guys working and they are BUSY.  2 servers, 1 cook.  \n\nWe had a Yelp reservation at 6:15 and arrived at 6:10 and were seated right away.  As we walked in, the food DID NOT smell good... that should have been a dead give away... but we persevered, trusting the 4-Star Yelp reviews.\n\nOur party ordered the following -- and EVERYTHING JUST PLAIN TASTED BAD.  Was the chef off tonight or something!?!? \n\n1.  Cod Fish with Risotto $26.  Fish had absolutely no seasoning and tasted like nothing.  A simple salt and pepper could have done wonders.  Risotto was undercooked a bit and did not have the smooth texture.  It was like pieces of rice, a bit crunchy yet overwhelmed with cheese flavor.\n\n2.  Ravioli $19.  Ravioli skin was too thick and too tough, also a bit sought to chew through.  Tomato sauce was watery. Filling was not flavored adequately.  An underwhelming dish... eatable but very blah.\n\n3. Pappardelle Bolognese with \"5-hr meat sauce\" $17.  Typically you cannot go wrong with any pasta with meat sauce but they manage to screw this one up too.  The \"5-hr meat sauce\" was just this watery tomato sauce with small pieces of meat.  Pasta was cooked soggy and not al dente (as opposed to al dente risotto!!)  \n\n4.  Verdure Pizza $17.  The pizza is where our whole dining experience went WAY south than it already has.  As if all the other dishes were not already bad enough... we took one bite into the pizza and it's lukewarm in the middle.  Yuck.  Have you ever had a crusty hot pizza yet the middle is just barely warm and dough is doughy?  Speaks to the uneven oven temperature.  \n\nWe spent the next 5 minutes trying to flag down our server who is busy rearranging tables to seat other parties.  By now, it's about 7 and the rush began.  We informed our server that the pizza is cold to warm on the inside and he snapped \"What do you mean its cold?  It just came out from the oven?\"  I replied \"it's cold in the middle\".  He huffed and simply took the pizza away.  No apology, no trying to understand.  Just rolled his eyes and went.   5 minutes later, he came back with the same pizza, now BURNT.  This is unacceptable.  At the same time, imagine the waiter and how he would reply if this time, I were to tell him that the pizza is now burnt!?!?  Anyway, by now, it's around 7:20 and I'm starving ... I typically don't eat the edges anyway so too a few bites and called it a day.  \n\nWhat would have been a bad experience now just took a dive and went from bad to worse.  \n\nBad food, bad service, rude waiter, uncomfortable cramped seating... do yourself a favor and go to North Beach or Chinatown only a few blocks away.\n\nTake a look at the pictures:  watery pasta sauces, burnt pizzas, thickly crusted ravioli...  THERE's NO WAY THIS IS A 4-star YELP Restaurant.  You've been warned.", "author": "Winnie W."}

The thin bacon sprinkles were overcooked to the point of being extremely crunchy and burnt. The sauce itself lacked any flavor, being very bland, watered down, and having no creamy flavor often expected from this dish. So after the waiter sprinkled pepper on, all I could taste was the pepper and bland noodles. \n\nOverall really disappointed.

The pizza was about 8 small to medium sized slices and was delicious. Good for 2 people to share or 1 person if you're really hungry.

Thanks to my handy dandy Yelp app, Pachino Trattoria & Pizzeria checked every box for me...for us! It was a huge win. \n\nIf you've been to Italy, you'll appreciate the authenticity of the service, food, and atmosphere. The owners of this place are the real deal. The menus are simple with a refined selection of classic Italian favorites...and big win for me...I didn't suffer from the too-much garlic stomach syndrome after my pasta. \n\nWe started with a nice glass of prosecco and ordered up a beautifully-presented and deliciously fresh caprese salad. Then we ordered two past dishes to share--pasta carbonara and pappardelle alla bolognese. The winning dish, by far, was the carbonara. It was rich and lightly creamy with a generous portion of bacon. Sorry, but I didn't think the bolognese sauce was flavorful enough. I also expected it to be heartier. \n\nFor dessert we opted for lemon cake and cappuccino.

There is nothing extremely fancy about their margherita, but what made it a star on the table was how exceptionally well it was done despite its simplicity. The crust was baked to the right texture, the sauce was sweet yet tangy, and there was the perfect amount of cheese on top. I only wished there was more than one basil leaf.\n\nTHE PASTA:\nI ordered the Orecchiette Pachino, and while the sauce wasn't special, the freshly-made, al dente pasta made me want to constantly shovel pasta into my mouth.

Another yelper posted pictures of the bucatini carbonera for MealPal and that was exactly what I got too: just some boiled noodles with a little bit of some disgusting butter substitute, and one sad looking piece of meat that is smaller than my pinky finger nail. So dry, so bland, like they didn't even want to waste salt crystals on this. There is nothing else other than the noodles, not even a sign of any garlic pieces. How is it that they are getting away with it - it's so sad it's funny. \n\nI'll have to say this is the most awful, most untrying Italian food I have ever had, if we can even call it Italian food.\n\nMost utterly disgusting. I have to wonder how does a restaurant like this survive in the financial district? MealPal is a good way to introduce new restaurants - this is an opportunity for owners to capture future patrons, not push them away with terrible food. I've tried a great many places through MealPal that I wouldn't have otherwise walked into. If Pachino's does not want to be a part of MealPal, then just don't partner.

I must have passed this place a hundred times without giving it a moment's thought, but for some reason, Jamie W. and I were feeling like Italian and didn't feel like venturing up to North Beach on a rainy evening. We settled into a rather snug table for two within the extremely compact space that makes up the restaurant. The kitchen is hidden on the way to the restroom in the back. The menu is pretty standard Italian, which was in line with what we wanted.\n\nWe were pleased to get warm sourdough rolls, one for each of us, which we slathered with olive oil (photo: http://bit.ly/21RunuZ). First up was a shared appetizer, the $12 Grilled Calamari which came on a small mound of Tuscan white beans with roasted peppers and arugula leaves (photo: http://bit.ly/24L5z6S). In hindsight, it was probably the highlight of the meal since the combination was unique enough to make the flavors stand out. Unfortunately the same can't be said about the $15 Bucatini Carbonara, which I found rather bland on its own and was in dire need of the red peperoncino flakes to give it any sort of life despite the crisped pancetta visible among the noodles (photo: http://bit.ly/1QwByQL).\n\nJamie fared better with the $16 Pesto Chicken, Sundried Tomato and Feta Cheese Pizza, a special that evening served rustic style with plenty of basil and cheese on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1QwBBMk). It was definitely more satisfying for the price than the bucatini. We gave the place another try a couple of weeks later, and our food selections were a bit more to our liking. For our appetizer, we tried the $11 Caprese Salad, which presented fresh mozzarella slices, grape tomatoes, and lightly dressed arugula as an Italian flag (photo: http://bit.ly/21Ruab4). This was certainly not the first time a trattoria served a caprese salad this way but it was a tasty starter.\n\nFor his entree, Jamie tried the $15 Spaghetti Della Nonna, which was as back-to-basics as you could get with a trio of big meatballs nestled on top, a bit mealy in texture despite the size (photo: http://bit.ly/1Rw3TV1), while for mine, I went for the $19 Spaghetti Frutti Di Mare, which despite the plethora of seafood, disappointed with the lukewarm temperature of the pasta (photo: http://bit.ly/1TDgpbJ). Yet, despite the restaurant's shortcomings, it's hard not to like a place that remains so serviceable on a busy stretch of Kearny where the worker drones demand everything to go, go, go. Yeah, we'll probably come back when we're in the mood for no-frills, no-fuss Italian food.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty standard Italian fare with some hints of creativity\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...cute enough spot but quite tight when it gets busy\nSERVICE - 4 stars...our server was on the ball\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if you want quick Italian with no frills at a decent enough price, well abbondanza to you!", "author": "Ed U."}

My friend & I came in based on Yelp recs & loved the pizzas; they have the usual wood-fired/Neopolitan-style options & you can also start with a Margherita & add your own toppings. Had interesting special pizzas too (more on that later). They do use San Marzano tomatoes and have buffalo mozzarella (as an option). The dough/crust was really good, really well developed flavor, and I love making my own pizza so I'm kind of particular about the dough & notice when it is especially good. A neighboring table had a green salad and it looked super fresh and good. Wish we had ordered one! They also had specials like a wild boar & broccolini pizza, & a gnocchi with Gorgonzola and spinach. I'm glad we decided to split dessert because the limoncello tote was so creamy & amazing with white chocolate curls on top. After we opted for dessert a four-top came in just for dessert so the yummyness on that front must be well-known. The afogatto (espresso w gelato) and tiramisu looked especially good. I think the owner & a family member were taking care of everyone- we felt super welcome. Tips: We made a last-min reservation on Yelp & they were ready for us & we noticed they were constantly checking for new reservations coming in and preparing tables for people. (I am always suspicious making a last-minute reservation because I feel like no one's going to know we're coming LOL) There we're also a few people who came in to order takeout, and they were really great about accommodating them as well, (I.e. Not making them feel like a burden as it sometimes happens when you are grabbing takeout) so you could do that if you really didn't feel like a dinner out and wanted to just eat at the hotel. On that note, this would be a place I would feel totally comfortable dining alone, as you sometimes end up doing when you are in a city by yourself on business. It was a lovely choice for our last dinner in San Francisco after we were seafood-out, as if that's possible LOL, and just wanted some good pizza comfort food.

But as usual, I got there late. We probably took about 5 minutes to decide on what to eat, and then another 5 to actually get the waitress' attention so we could order. But once the waitress came over, she told us that she had to make a little adjustment to the menu - basically, they weren't serving any of their pastas.\n\nPersonally, I think that's outrageous. The employees failed to mention that when they seated my friend? The reason we were there is because their pasta seemed like a wonderful option. For someone who doesn't want pizza, there's really nothing else I could order. So we left. I'm not sure if that's rude or not, but I wasn't going to force myself to order a Starter as dinner or stuff myself with a 12\" pizza.\n\nI had really hoped to try their pasta.

We got a nice bottle of red for about $30ish dollars.\n- They give a big ole roll to start that fills ya up.\n- The grilled calamari was actually good.\n- Prices weren't horrible. A pizza, an app and a bottle of wine with tip = $85. It would of been better if we enjoyed it more, but read on.\n\nThe cons:\n- Service was ok. We actually ordered two pizza's and he only put one in. That ended up in our favor as we were stuffed and disappointed after the first.\n- The pizza wasn't awesome. Not bursting with flavor, soggy and might I use the word, soupy? Toppings falling off, including the cheese, a ton of extra water from the vegetables. I get it, as a huge pizza fan, it's hard.

This place had a really nice, neighborly feel to it which was a pleasant surprise given the area. \n\nFor starters, we had the grilled calamari. This has to be one of the best calamari appetizers I've had in a long time. If you come here and you like calamari, this is a definite must have. The smokey char on tender calamari is balanced by the fruity flavors of roasted bell peppers and olive oil. The hearty white beans went really well with the squid. You could really taste all of the flavors of this dish in the beans. \n\nWe got two pizzas for two people because 12\" somehow sounded small at the time. Total overkill but at least we got to try more food and take home leftovers. Can't complain about that right? \n\nWe had the special: smoked mozzarella, anchovies, roasted bell peppers and cherry tomatos, and the diavola: tomato sauce, arugula, fennel sausage, and a Serrano pepper in the middle. They were very different but both were very tasty - you couldn't pick a favorite between the two. The special was more smokey and savory whereas the diavola was bitter and sweet. The crust on both was well done if you like the crust on Italian pizzas. \n\nThe price was pretty reasonable as well - 50 some dollars for two pizzas and a generously portioned  appetizer.

Although I do have high expectations for a restaurant rated 4.5 stars on Yelp, which is how I heard about them in the first place.\n\nI was starving when I sat down, so I was glad they started off with some warm bread buns! Those were so good I was almost stuffed completely by the time the pizza came out.\n\nI ordered the Diavolo - spicy house made fennel sausage, arugula, tomato, and serrano pepper. The pizza was pretty thin and the crust was well textured (crispy + a bit chewy), but the center was completely soggy. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it was from the very fresh tomatoes they used on the pizza. All the ingredients they used were very fresh, and the sausage was great. It came with two peppers, one on either side of the pizza. However, I still feel that a top notch pizzeria should know how to prep the tomatoes so it doesn't make the center dough all soggy. That was basically the biggest downside. \n\nI also sat on the outside, and it was slightly difficult to get the attention of the wait staff, since they were mostly rushing around on the inside during evening dinner crowd. \n\nI couldn't finish the whole pizza by myself and took some of it to go.

I legitimately don't know where to start with this place because the whole experience grated me down to the core.\n\nI came here with a group of five at 5pm. Immediately after entering the restaurant, the hostess let us know that it was a reservation only place and then abruptly began ignoring us. I looked around the restaurant - they only had two groups in the entire place. I just brushed it off.\n\nWe walked out and she ran after us ten seconds later attempting to excuse her strange behavior with the excuse that she had to check for other reservations before seating us.\n\nWe were seated, and it took ages to get menus in front of us even though it was extremely slow in the restaurant.\n\n--\n\nWe ordered:\nComplimentary bread - bland, mostly crust, and resembled hockey pucks more than bread.\n\nDiavolo and Pistacchi e Salsiccia pizzas - slightly burnt. Both crusts were charred and not pleasant at all. The pizza was soggy in the middle - I couldn't pick up a piece without everything sliding off the end of the limp slice. You would think that this place would have at least decent pizza after declaring themselves mainly as a pizzeria.\n\nGrilled calamari - good flavor, but contained mostly beans. I paid $12 for beans.\n\nFish brodetto - the pasta was overcooked and soggy. The broth and/or seafood components were probably prepared wrong, so it made the whole dish smell absolutely rancid.\n\n--\n\nIt took twenty minutes for my party to receive our food, and most of it wasn't even hot.\n\nNear the end of our meal, there were two plates of pizza left on the table with two slices on each. A waitress came and told us to get the pizza slices so she could grab our plates. She. TOLD. Us. This was the hugest issue, in my opinion.\n\nIt's unacceptably rude to even ask somebody if they're done with a plate when there's clearly still food on it. This girl didn't even ask - she TOLD us to get the multiple slices off the plates.\n\nWhen I didn't grab the slices quickly enough because I already had food in my hands, she took the pizza plate and dumped the slices onto my plate and then walked away. I was in shock. Who the hell does that?\n\nWe were in the restaurant for a total of about 45 minutes. We were rushed at the end of our dining period, but I still had to ask for the check 5 minutes after finishing my food and twiddling my thumbs because nobody brought it.\n\nConclusion:\nThe food here was terrible and not worth any amount of money. I could heat up a better frozen pizza for a quarter of the price.\nThe service was the most heinous feature of all. I'm shocked that people like this exist.\nI'm not sure why their Yelp ratings are so high; I was definitely misled by them.\nDon't waste your money, time, or patience here.", "author": "Michelle N."}

Had to ask two times for a sparkling water and when we said \"OK\" to more bread it never came either without us asking again and the most remarkable is the 50!!! (Yes FIFTY) minute wait for a pizza. \n\nHonestly I don't see the big fuss about this place.

This place is tiny. If you order pizza, it might take a while. Food is good here. There was a  beets carpaccio special that night, and it was amazing. Mix of golden and red beets. For my entr\u00e9e I got a Margherita pizza with pepperoni added, which was good. It's super thin though, but very fresh with good sauce. I think the meals for my table took a while because my pizza took a while to bake. \n\nThe service here can be good depending who you get. There is a male and female server the night I was there. The male server was on the point, but our main server was the female. She took a while to come take our order, so the male server took it. Since our meal took a while to come out, we asked her if it would be out soon, but she never checked on it. When we were done with our meal, we asked for the check, but she never came with it. In the end, we had to ask the male server if he could get the check, and he got it within a minute or less.\n\nOverall, the pizza is good here, but the service can be hit or miss depending on who you get. It took us about 2 hours to finish our meal, and we're usually done within an hour at most restaurants. If you're not in a rush to go anywhere afterwards, this place should be fine.", "author": "Lisa T."}

I guess he was a busboy? He was attentive and in clearing plates, scraping crumbs off the table, and, when he overheard me ask for balsamic vinegar, immediately grabbed it. The weird part though was that when I asked him to take our order, he told us that the only waiter would help us soon. Not odd in and of itself, but the we had to wait another 10 minutes because the one waiter was taking the order of a large party, taking the time to joke and explain every dish on the menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-18", "description": "I'm honestly surprised that this place gets such great reviews because it was really nothing special. We had ordered the Bruschetta and Dei Rei Pizza from Caviar delivery service. The Brushetta was soggy from sitting in the over abundance of olive oil from the pesto but, we still managed to get it down. On the Caviar website it states that it has \"toasted almond\" which, it did not - it was pine nuts. HUGE DIFFERENCE in both texture and flavor. The pizza? Well, where do I begin? Everything was STONE cold because for some reason it took 30 minutes to make a delivery .3 miles. Now, I'm a person that takes A LOT of taxi cabs all over the city, I know exactly how long it takes to get from them to us. Not sure why these delivery people seem to have such a hard time with this concept but, they are failing miserably and making restaurants look horribly bad. The description of the pizza says 4 cheese, would you expect Blue Cheese to be one of those cheeses? It wouldn't have been so bad if we didn't keep getting mouthfuls (mind you, I LOVE Blue Cheese, just not mouthfuls of it) of it - over powering everything. If you are going to use such a potent cheese, break it up more and distribute it more evenly otherwise, it defeats the purpose of the other ingredients. The description also did not mention ANYTHING about pesto as a sauce, this caught me off guard and had I known, I would not have ordered from here since I had pesto linguine for lunch. The prosciutto was almost transparent and looked like flesh that was being tanned - it was far from looking appealing. This was most likely a result from being one step away from being frozen, I'm sure it would have been more appetizing had it actually been somewhat warm. There was also no hint of \"sage\" and trust me, I know sage well, it's one of my favorite spices and I use it often. So, for $40.56 we got stone cold, soggy...... ~censored~  They also need to update their menu descriptions and leaving out major ingredients is just bad business.", "author": "Jamilah A."}

Place was very tiny and every table was taken. We decided to wait it out for a table and wow I'm glad we did. The service was slowish but we didn't mind too much as the only person working tables (owner?) was hustling as best as anyone I have ever seen without sweating a drop. The appetizer bruschetta were bites of heavenly balance. Fresh, light and sweet. I had spaghetti and meatballs and my boyfriend had the cheese ravioli. Each were so gooooood! Pasta was hand made and cooked at the right amount, sauces flavorful yet not over powering, meatballs tasted so homemade in the best of ways.

Personal favorites:\n\n- Gorgonzola gnocchi\n- Prosciutto shaved truffle pizza\n\nWe went here for a friend's birthday celebration and the owner was very warm and accommodating.  However, the server we had was pretty rude:  She kept clearing plates off of our table to the point that there were still items left such as bruschetta that she'd try to take away if we didn't stop her.  She interrupted conversations by taking our personal plates with food still left on them just so we'd \"have a clean plate\".  At the end when our dinner party was winding down, she again interrupted everyone's conversation and comfort by scraping food scraps off a paper covered tablecloth.  There were three slices of pizza left on the table, and she just grabbed them off and left without asking us what we wanted to do with them.\n\nOur experience would have been superb had there not been this server continuously rude and in the way the whole night.", "author": "Joy W."}

But the food was just uninteresting. \n\nI liked that Pachino places full bottles of olive oil on the table for dipping in the nice, warm bread our server brought shortly after he took our order. But the oil was bland. There are lots of reviews here that rave about the olive oil; I don't get it, unless people are so tickled with the fact that there's a whole bottle at the table (which is cool). The oil was so mild that dipping bread into it was like dipping into canola oil.\n\nMy friends and I ordered four dishes - a salad with bitter greens and a balsamic dressing, a pizza with vegetables, the pasta special (with a sausage ragout and fava beans, and a pasta with bolognese sauce). The salad was beautiful and tasty. The pastas - not so much - again, bland. The sausage ragout was particularly disappointing as it had sounded so good, but was bland and a bit watery. The number of favas in the dish was underwhelming, I had hoped for more. The Bolognese was similarly bland. \n\nThe pizza was kind of a mixed bag. The crust was beautifully done - crispy and yeasty. But the toppings were - bland. \n\nI think Pachino could be quite wonderful with a little more attention to the dishes, and with better oil. But I'm going to give it two stars now. I'd definitely come back for salad and pizza because the place itself is so enjoyable, in the hope that perhaps the kitchen had a bad day when we came.", "author": "David G."}

I ordered the meatballs and beet salad. The meatballs were great - came with ricotta, extra sauce in the bowl, and some bread for soaking up the sauce. The beet salad wasn't that great - the beets looked very \"jelly\" and left a slime on my plate. They tasted that way too. Some spinach was thrown on top with some avocado and pistachios. The beets just had a weird texture to them that I've never had while eating beets before. A gentleman came to the table to clear our dishes (I think maybe he's the owner?) and asked me if the salad was ok. I politely said not really, the beets were a little jelly and not great. He walked away and visibly rolled his eyes at me, scoffed, and shook his head. He asked - I gave him an honest answer. I felt it was inappropriate to roll his eyes at me just because I didn't like his beet salad.\n\nAdded to that the service was incredibly slow. The place was damn near empty when we got there at 11:45 but for some reason we had to wait to get seated for a good 15-20 min. After clearing our plates we sat there for 20 min before we actually had to flag the waiter down to get the check. Once we got said check it took them another 15 min or so to come back with the credit card. It looked like they only had 1 waiter for the entire restaurant. \n\nAll in all I wouldn't come back here.

Came here for lunch with an old friend from the Bay Area. According to my friend, parking was not easy to find. She parked in a nearby parking garage for $4 an hour. We went a little over an hour and they were kind enough to charge her $6 total. On the other hand, I walked here from Union Square. It can be easy to miss if you are not paying attention, since the entrance is not loud or showy.\n\nThe inside is classy and romantic, half-dark with lamps at each table. We sat at a two-person table right by the door and it was fine. Not a lot of people are coming in and out, so draft from the door was not an issue at all. The owner is a charming Italian man named Francesco who took our order as soon as we were ready. He brought the food out for us himself and described what he was putting in front of us. The pizzas were gorgeous. I got the Pistacchi e Salsiccia (pistachio pesto, sausage, mozzarella, basil) and my friend got the Diavolo (spicy sausage, arugula, tomato, and pepper). Both were delicious and artfully presented. Both were huge, too. I could only eat about three slices and had to take the rest of my pizza home. My grandpa straight from China loved the Pistacchi e Salsiccia, and he is very selective about what he finds delicious. I think he would like to come here with me next time he visits SF.\n\nThe volume of the restaurant is pretty quiet. When I was waiting for my friend to find parking, I could hear the entire conversation of the double date going on behind me. The group consisted of two Asian American girls and two Asian American guys, girls on one side and guys on the other, so maybe it wasn't a double date, but maybe an acci-date. They left a little bit after my friend arrived, and the only other customer in the place was a middle-aged, well-dressed gentleman dining by himself. My friend and I were able to catch up on about six months' worth of life events (I live in Seattle, she stayed in the Bay). I liked that the setting was quiet and intimate, however I'm surprised more people don't come here for lunch.

My first bite into the meatball had some gristle (we're talking huge here. ick), and the overall texture of the meatball was not good. The spaghetti was whatever, the sauce forgettable, but the price? It's a crime to charge that much for that pasta. \n\nThe wine the waiter recommended didn't sit well with me after the meal. I can't place it... it hadn't gone bad, no hint of mold, cork felt fine, but it just... tasted cheap. I mean, I wasn't expecting much from any of the wines. The priciest bottle they had was $44 (and I think ours was $38?), but I don't get sick from wine, not like this. It wasn't a \"I-drank-so-much-oh-I-feel-sick\" kind of feeling, but rather \"what-kind-of-$2-wine-did-I-put-into-my-body??\" feeling of just ickiness (apologies to all the amazing French wines I had for under 5 Euros and to Two-buck Chuck). \n\nThe only saving grace was the pizza (pistachio and sausage).

Yeah, this place is legit!! From the staff who mingled with me in Italian to the amazing wine selection & decadent main dishes to choose from this place had me from hello to goodbye.  I really enjoyed the pesto pizza (my #1 recommended dish) but the pasta (capellini  - angel hair pasta with white wine, shrimp, tomatoe,  arugola and garlic) was really good as well.  My only regret: that I didn't stay for dessert.  I foolishly went to some gelato place that I'm sure didn't deliver the same authenticity that this place could have provided in that arena.\n\nSo in hopes of passing along the Yelp baton do yourself a favor and stop into this lovely little piece of Italian heaven.

We came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed. There was a huge ~20 person party and the restaurant was super hot and crowded. Although no one was seated outside, we asked if we could sit out there and the owner (?) said, of course! I immediately felt bad realizing we'd have to make wait staff come outside just for us but the owner insisted it was fine. He was extremely warm, funny, and welcoming. We shared the grilled seared caesar salad, the funghi and taleggio pizza, and the tiramisu. The pizza was amazing! The mozzarella and mushrooms were incredibly fresh and the crust was thin and perfectly crispy. The tiramisu was the BEST I've ever had and I'm glad I saved room for it! Tiramisu can be overwhelmingly sweet and heavy but Pachino's was perfect - just sweet enough and sooo creamy.\n\nService was also wonderful and the wait staff/owner never seemed annoyed serving us outside.

However, both sauces for the pasta dishes have unpleasantly sour notes, not appetizing at all.

To give a warm, heart-felt example to my other elites (and now, being a gold elite, I feel like I have a greater duty to use my gold seal with accountability), I'll be generous and move towards the 3. But to be honest, it would be a 2.5.\n\nFirst of all, I am completely flabbergasted that this place got 4.5 stars. My friend, visiting from NY, gathered all of her Bay Area friends to a dinner here last night. We had a party of 9, and though 9 is a pretty large party, we were one of two tables populating the (small) restaurant. We met at 8:00, but due to the rain and usual fashionably late social stigmas, we didn't put in our order until about 8:30. Everyone ordered a typical item... pasta here, pizza there. The hubs and I decided to share their salad du jour (local sardines and orange slices) and to share their Spaghetti Carbonara. The only spaghetti I've experienced (both at home and out) was with tomato sauce, so I was feeling adventurous, coupled with the comfort from my husband reinstating that carbonara is delicious.\n\nI know we had 9 people (again), but we waited 45 minutes for our food to arrive. at 8:30 pm on a Wednesday night. Sure, it could've been because there were so many orders, but there was only ONE other table in the restaurant (with TWO PEOPLE! They even got their meal AND dessert before we got our entries!). They took so long that they even refilled our bread baskets. Side note, bread not impressive. First one I ate was stale. Second was kinda fluffy, but very thin with lots of bubbles on the inside.\n\nWe finally got our salad, which was pretty tasty. 2 large sardines roasted, great seasoning. There was a small bunch of seasoned arugula, peeled oranges and thin slices of what seemed to be radish, tossed in a viniagrette. Standard enough. The carbonara was a huge disappointment. Since we ate the salad first (mind you, we only took a few minutes), the carbonara ended up being a sticky ball of soggy pasta, white sauce thickened and acting as a glue holding all of the noodles together. When I finally forked my way through the pasta to create individual strands, I could only make out a few pieces of thinly-sliced meat in the mess. Noodles cooked too long and sauce was mediocre. I was so hungry that I inhaled it, but it was inhaled sadly.\n\nThey added their own 18% tip at the end, which I know is standard with large parties, but I think is a generous tip for mediocre food that took 45 minutes to produce. My husband said he would never come back. I think I have to agree.", "author": "Becky K."}

The manager could not have been friendlier throughout the process, and was happy to oblige, despite to fact that we would be taking up half of his restaurant on a Friday night. That was easy. Getting there on time would be the bigger challenge.\n\nAfter happy hour boots at Schroeders, we (no surprises) showed up almost 40 minutes late for our reservation, calling the restaurant twice from happy hour to push it back. The manager was STILL cool as a cucumber, what a pro.\n\nAs far as the actual restaurant experience, food was a strong value.

The restaurant only has a handful of tables inside and a couple outside, so we were happy to get right in.  We had just come from the Rickhouse bar one block down, which is a great place to get drinks before you settle down with some really great Italian food.\n\nOur server may have been the same person that other reviews refer to - the owner/chef that is incredibly friendly and takes great pride the food they prepare.  He was very attentive, polite and deeply appreciated the complements we provided at a few points during our meal.\n\nI had the bean soup with prosciutto, which was a special that I hope they continue to offer.  It is probably the best soup I have ever tasted.\n\nTheir wine list is brief.  There are about a dozen bottles to choose from.  If you just want to order a glass you simply pick by varietal and receive the house selection.  I went with the montepulciano, which stood up well to the pizza I ordered that had spicy sausage and spicier peppers.\n\nThe thin crust pizza was fantastic.

I've made it a personal challenge to try to find other establishments that offer a worthy competitor to it, and Pachino has officially made it onto my list.

The place is TINY (less than 10 tables) so definitely make a res even for a Monday night. When we arrived, two waitresses were running the FOH and neither acknowledged our presence for over 5 minutes (which is really hard to do since the place is so very small). After feeling invisible for awhile, we literally had to walk right up to one of the waitresses to get seated. Once seated, the waitress was very nice. \n\nWe ordered two glasses of cab, both were fine but seemed overpriced for the quality.Very average bread was delivered to the table with nothing to dip it in except for a very unflavorful olive oil concoction that we made ourselves. We wanted to start with the caprese salad and the appetizer meatballs, but they were out of meatballs so we went with the caprese and the grilled calamari with white beans. Both were pretty bland and lacked flavor. The pesto that garnished the salad had literally no flavor, the tomatoes were very distinctively strange tasting and the mozzarella had a tough texture. The grilled calamari was completely unseasoned, the actual calamari in the dish was very little, it was mostly filled with white beans. \n\nThe only kinda redeeming quality was the main couse we shared - saltimbocca, prosciutto and sage, white wine sauce, served with spaghetti. It was creamy and delicious but the portion was very small, and you could tell the dish had been drowned in heavy cream to make it so delicious but lacked any other seasoning or creativity by the chef. Still, we enjoyed it after topping with lots of red pepper, parmesan, and pepper. \n\nWe probably won't go back but if we do, will get the pizza.", "author": "Piyali F."}

You can easily identify this place by its neon sign, which is clearly visible at night when all their neighbors are closed. The interior is tiny and dimly-lit; there are only a handful of tables inside, and a few outside. The tables are white-clothed and the seats are comfortable, although sandwiched alongside each other in an uncomfortable fashion. \n\nI didn't look at the prices or menu when I went in, because I wanted to try it out nonetheless, but it was more expensive than I had presumed. I paid $28 without tip for spaghetti and meatballs ($16) and a glass of red wine ($10). As I was one person, I was clearly not a priority for the restaurant employees(owner?) who served me. They were not mean, but I suppose uninterested in my patronage. One waiter for all those tables seems to be a stretch... I received my glass of wine after waiting ten minutes... I received my packaged meal 5 minutes later...\n\nAs I was trying to finish my wine before I left, I was asked to move tables, so a larger party could be accommodated. Okay, no big deal, but you could've served my drink immediately and I would have already been gone. Even when there are a lot of people breathing down your neck, you don't want to shortchange anyone on the 'experience' at a restaurant; even if they are only getting take-out. In my opinion, this isn't easy to do, but it's important with establishments of this size. I see they have a lot of business whenever I walk by, so maybe they don't care about service, but it's important to me.\n\nWhen I got back to my studies and started eating, I understood why anyone would like this place. The food is great. The people who work at this restaurant are actually Italian, and it shows. I would recommend coming here with a party of two or four: that should give you the best possible impression of the place. Also, come here to sit down and eat, don't get take-out.

I was hoping for a taste, but I was too slow.\n\nOur server was so warm and welcoming. He had an innate sense when to check on us, and when to let us visit. We recently buried two people we love and the conversation became emotional. Like magic, a little extra wine appeared in my glass. So kind! He shook my hand and thanked me by name as we left.

When we arrive half an hour early last night (happened to be in there area), the server (who I assume is the owner) was able to seat us at a large table, but then proceeded to ignore us for a good half an hour. When we finally flagged him down, it became clear that he thought our reservation was FOR eight, not AT eight. Oops. After that was cleared up, it was smooth sailing. \n\nPrice: Moderate, we spent about $90 for a bottle of house red, a pizza, ravioli, two espressos and a tiramisu. (Hey it was v-day, we went all out)\n\nAmbiance: Dim, romantic, a little crowded so if you don't like people listening, and possibly partaking, in on your conversation, this probably isn't the joint for you.\n\nService: pretty good\n\nFood: Delish! One of the best wood fired pizzas I've had in SF. I had the Genova, which was mozzarella, asiago, rosemary and sausage. Bf had ravioli which were also delicious, although not mind-blowing.

We came in as customers and left feeling like we'd made a couple of friends. Service: five stars\n\nWe ordered:\nRoasted beet and goat cheese salad: four stars. Perfect mix of flavors and texture\nChicken saltimbocca: three stars. My partner adored it. The flavor was fantastic, the meat was just a tad overcooked and dry. The accompanying pasta was glorious, though. Fresh spinach on the side, perfectly cooked. \nHangar steak in chianti sauce: three and a half stars. Gorgeous cut of meat. The sauce did not overpower the meat and it really let the greens served with the meal shine. \nCreme caramel - three stars. Nice.\n\nLovely wine recommendations with our meal, their wines by the glass are good quality and nicely priced.\n\nWas it expensive? Yes. Worth the money for the dining experience, imo. We felt truly welcomed in the space, well taken care of, and the food was nice. Portions were on the smallish side if you're used to contemporary American dining out style portions and this might contribute to a feeling of things being overpriced.

They did bring a replacement meal to go in a matter of minutes, for which they get the second star; but the service was unapologetic. Our ravioli with meat sauce was without meat. The spaghetti carbonara was a semi-solid mound of creamy pasta with a few pieces of bacon mixed in. All in all, it was not an experience we would wish upon others.

I agree what everyone says about the service, it's very mediocre.  We had to ask for bread, then butter.  We didn't  want to bother to ask for olive oil.  $13 salad came, nice but seemed too pricey.  It would be nice if they had some pasta on the plate with the entree. In fact they only have three pasta dishes all three with lots of cheese. \n\n Presentation is very bland-- no basil leaves, nothing but the entree.   \n\nSo, the atmosphere-  nothing on the tables-- no table cloth, no place mats. Paper napkins.   TV  above (I always think of a sports bar when there's a TV).  This place did not feel like an Italian restaurant to me.\n\n The prices are the same as Belden Alley, but they don't deserve to be.", "author": "Dennis N."}

I definitely recommend booking in advance too--this place was packed due to being small, and a lot of people faced uphill wait times sans reservations when walking in. Also, when you find parking directly in front of wherever you're going, you have to assume it'll be a good night. And overall, it was. The pizza takes forever but it's really good. The Margherita pizza with pepperoni my girlfriend had was solid, but takes forever to make. My pappardelle was tasty, but the pizza was better. My only complaint is the wait times and overall service. While the owner (I assume it was the owner) is also the waiter, and has to accomodate both the inside and outside tables and does his best, we still were in there for a long time. The pizza has to cook awhile, but after around 20 minutes when I asked one of the other servers when we'd be served, she said she'd get right back to me and never did. Often enough, I saw the one cook they have in the back just waiting around for orders to fill, but maybe she had things in the oven and was waiting for them to bake. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But when we were finished and waiting for the check, I again (foolishly) asked the other server for the bill and after another \"I'll get it to you right away\", she never came back and I was forced to ask the owner for it again. I'm not sure if she just ignored me or would get it to me the next day, but being at a restaurant for over 2 hours is pretty crazy. I don't know if I'd be back simply for the wait times. The food is good, however.", "author": "Dan M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-29", "description": "First, let me just say that the pizza here is really good. Wood oven pizza with high quality ingredients. The crust had the right crispness and char, and the sauce and cheese were correctly proportioned. I have yet to find a pizza in the Bay that meets all of those criteria, so well done, guys.\n\nHaving said that, there are some issues here. Thing 1: this place changed its name from Quattro Stagioni to Pachino Pizzeria last week. I called last week to place an order (based on QS's menu) and was told they were doing some renovations and would reopen this week. No mention that the menu/prices/ownership had totally changed. Luckily the pizza was still good, but I would have wanted them to be more up front.\n\nThing 2: When I did place my order this week, because I didn't know that it had changed hands, I was expecting QS's prices. Boy was I wrong! The individual-sized margherita with prosciutto and arugula which was $12 on the QS menu cost me $17, bringing it into overpriced land really quickly.\n\nThing 3: When I called this week to place my order, I was placed on hold for 25 minutes before I finally gave up. I called back 10 minutes later and was helped. Did they forget? Were they not prioritizing answering the phone? Either way, it was kind of irritating.\n\nBottom line: if you will pay any amount of money for good pizza, this is your place! But, I can't in good faith rate this above a 3 when you could get the same thing in NY for 2/3 the price. My quest to find good pizza in the Bay may slow down a bit after this one, though.", "author": "Rachel G."}

The food was fresh, warm, and very tasty.  The only reason for the four stars versus five was because the starter salad needed a little more pizazz.\n\nThe dessert however, was tiramisu, and it was incredible.

I randomly ended up at Pachino, because the wait at La Fusion was 40 minutes and my hunger pangs could not wait that long. I was skeptical to say the least, since great pizza is hard to come by. \n\nWe decided to order both a pasta and pizza to split (partially since I was scared the pizza would be mediocre and I've never met a gnocchi I didnt like) and a couple glasses of wine. The pasta came out first and it was solid, home made gnocchi with a nice Gorgonzola cream sauce like my Dad used to make at home. Good and we demolished. \n\nAs we are finishing the owner, a very friendly and nice host, brings out our pie featuring wild boar sausage, mushroom and olive. I was shocked to say the least and the pie looked exactly like the pizza I had eaten in Napoli 10 years back. \n\nThe crust was charred just a bit and had risen well above the center of the pizza, which was still nice and thin, with just the right amount of toppings. A true pizza should be like a pie, the crust should be one of the best parts and not a Atkins disposal remedy. The crust on the pie was perfect, light and fluffy, but with a crispy outer layer that had a great crunch to it. The mozzarella seemed like a high quality product and the sauce was definitely not overly seasoned and tasted really fresh. \n\nSure, maybe some of it was the shock factor of walking into a restaurant that I didn't know existed and receiving an amazing meal, but I still think this Pizza is top notch. Obviously I will have to go back and I can't speak to consistency since I have only been once, but I would highly recommend based on my one experience.", "author": "Nick B."}

We shared a special grilled peach salad with fresh mozzarella, arugula, and addiction. Then I had the most unusual Filipino linguine ever. Fresh linguine and a mix of seafood was served inside a fresh baked topper of baked bread (kind of like pot pie crust, but made with fresh pizza-like dough). It sounds odd, but once you opened up the top, you could sop up the broth with the delicious bread. My husband's classic pepperoni pizza was also quite good-probably a good idea to share one with two people as it was quite ample.", "author": "Jonelle D."}

Pachino is a walkable distance from the Square and although the space is small, the food was amazing. The prices were more than fair considering the quality we received. \n\nWe also ended up chatting with the owner. His father had a restaurant in the North End in Boston (Boston's Little Italy, essentially). He also gave us inside tips on how to spend our time in the city, which we followed up with and enjoyed!\n\nDefinitely a place to check out if you're a resident or visitor to the city!", "author": "Ila C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-02", "description": "This restaurant is a little slice of Italy in the middle of downtown San Francisco.  The food, the ambiance, the owner who did the majority of serving - all made me feel like I was back in Rome.  \n\nFirst tip, it's a tiny little place so get there early or make reservations!  Luckily we got there just before 6 pm and got a table, but as the evening wore on the owner turned away many would-be patrons since they just didn't have space.  And the fresh baked bread you get to munch on while you wait for your food was delicious, very light and airy.  \n\nSecond tip, pay attention to the specials on the board, because there are tons of them and I would have tried every single one if I could have.  The special I ended up ordering was the cioppino linguine, which is basically a mix of seafood served with pasta, but it ended up being so much more.  It consisted of sea bass, salmon, lobster, shrimp, mussels and clams served in a delicious light tomato broth on top of a generous portion of fresh made linguine.  But what set it apart was that the entire bowl was completely wrapped in pizza dough and then the whole thing was baked, so the seafood steamed inside a cocoon of dough and became nice and crispy.  You have to cut through the top of the dough to get to the seafood but then you can dip the crust in the broth as you enjoy your meal and it was just perfect, SO good!!  \n\nThird tip, you must try the pizza.  My husband ordered the reliable pizza margarita, but it was fantastic.  The crust was super thin with just the right mix of crispiness in the middle and chewiness on the outer crust.  The sauce was fresh and flavorful with the perfect portion of fresh mozzarella.  Totally reminiscent of pizza we'd had in Italy.\n\nFourth tip, if you can somehow find the room after enjoying a delicious meal, try the tiramisu.  It was light and not too sweet and the best I've ever had, period.  \n\nThe only reason why I gave 4 stars was because the service was a bit slow.  The owner took in-house orders, served, took phone orders, and seated customers - with only one other person busing tables and running food.  He needs to have at least other person helping out on the floor or at least answering the phone and it would run much smoother.  But he was perfectly charming and very nice so if his only fault was trying to do too much himself then he's forgiven as far as I'm concerned!  The next time we're in San Francisco we'll definitely be back.  You MUST try Pachino's!", "author": "Melissa H."}

Im just going to be honest, this isn't out of anger or anything like most of the bad reviews on Yelp are. We made a reservation an hour before we came and when we did end up coming we got in right away no problem... Me and my parents ordered pizza margarita and spaghetti and meatballs. Pretty simple.. Turns out they didn't have any bread left so I couldn't try there olive oil that they have broadly placed on the table. The walk-in table that came in after us had gotten their food a few minutes before us. The pizza was alright but it didn't have that great of flavor. Also the meatballs didn't have any flavor at all, weird considering that those are probably the most popular two things that I would assume would be made well at an Italian restuarant. The staff were all very friendly and nice till we were looking for dessert. Waited for about 10-15 minutes for them to notice us looking at them. The restuarant is not very large and they had to walk by us many times to get to the other tables. For dessert I ordered one cannoli. I think they realized how they had treated us and gave us three cannoli's. I started writing this before i had ordered and received dessert so i have changed my review from a two to a three because they had realized their mistake. Great service.", "author": "Shane L."}

Authentic Italian pizza from a wood-fired oven just like the pizza I enjoyed in Umbria and Toscana.

The first was a fresh mozzerella with proscuitto that was loaded with ingredients over the crispy crust.  The second \"try\" pizza blew my palate away...fresh squash blossoms, fresh zucchini, onions and a little truffle oil.  Mamma Mia!  \n\nThe individual size pizzas are sizeable.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-07", "description": "I love Pachino and I regret that the other reviewers did not have the same brilliant experience that I had while visiting San Francisco this last week. As a Chef, I am very selective about Italian so it was not so typical for me to choose a place on a whim just around the corner from my hotel. I was sold in a heartbeat to dine there when their Prosciutto-Arugula-Burrata pizza was listed first on their blackboard, I didn't even need to look at the menu. The pizza was as good or better than I've had in Italy, the recommended Pinot Noir wine was perfect with it, and they even offered me the chocolate-amaretto mousse they'd made for New Year's. It was all exquisite, to say the least. \n\nEven though on this Tuesday night the place was not terribly busy, I was still treated like a VIP (as were the other customers around me) and I have absolutely nothing but kind compliments to offer about the service. I met a few of the employees and the owner, all of whom were wonderful. I felt like I'd landed in a small, warm, friendly neighborhood haunt, which can be very unusual for the Financial District of a big city. \n\nI returned to dine there again for late dinner and also for lunch during my stay in the city, because I felt so at home.\n\nI would gently encourage others to take the early reviews here with a grain of salt. Pachino is relatively new and perhaps has yet to place itself on all the big maps, but it certainly deserves another chance if diners ate there some months ago. The owner and new manager care deeply about the quality of their food and service, and given the chance, surely they will demonstrate that over and again.\n\nBy the way, the poached pear salad is outstanding, as is the grilled flank steak with Chianti wine sauce. And don't miss the amazing tiramisu (also something I am extremely snobby about) if it's available. Buon appetito!", "author": "Diane S."}

The pasta, pizza, and salads are all melt in your mouth good. I took one-star away because they took my favorite dish off the menu, the salmon over risotto, which I've never stopped dreaming about. I suppose they wanted to replace it with a healthier salmon option, because now it's just salmon over \"corn salsa\" with some kind of mediocre sauce. The new variation of salmon is \"meh\" at best, but on the bright side this change has forced me to become more creative about ordering different things. I don't know if I would eat from here as often without my office footing the bill since it's a bit expensive, but the quality is indicative of the price in this case so don't be deterred.", "author": "S H."}

At peak times I'd imagine many get turned away as the place is tiny.  But thankfully it wasn't an issue for us, and we both completely enjoyed the meal, the service, and the feel of the place.  The atmostphere is quant, small, intimate, and authentic.  We felt as though we found a small gem.  As others have said, the menu and wine list is not large, but everything we had was delicious.  We both will be coming back.", "author": "Kim H."}

While staying in SanFran with my family members, we decided to try pachino based on the good reviews it's received thus far. Words I'd use to  describe Pachino are: warm, clean, and cozy. The owner, a native of Italy, adds a true personal touch and sees to everyone's satisfaction. This place is the polar opposite of a chain restaurant, its a high quality establishment with true italian cuisine. My dad, sister, and I enjoyed brick oven pizza,( which was delicious), while mom enjoyed gnocchi which she raved about. I'd like to return with my husband and hopefully have the lovely dining experience I enjoyed so much with my family at Pachino.", "author": "Talia R."}

That being said, this is the best pizza I've ever tasted in the U.S. and Brazil (I have not been to Italy).\nThe crust is unbelievably amazing! It's a combination of just the right amount of crunchy and chewy. The ingredients are super fresh and very high quality. I love that they have Peroni on tap.\nLast time I went, I had tiramisu and espresso for dessert and it was also excellent.", "author": "Andre C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-18", "description": "Fantastic small place. Because it's so small, it feels different than most other places. The owner pays attention to every table personally and makes sure everything is as good add it can be. He always introduces the specials for the day but is at the same time very upfront and honest about what from the menu he cannot make for the day because he is missing an ingredient that day. The food is fantastic and many recipes are from his family from Italy. Will keep coming back.", "author": "Ratko J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-09", "description": "It's really hard to not like this place.  I can't say the food was the best I've ever eaten, but there's a lot of charm here that I haven't experienced anywhere else.  Maybe it's because our server seems to know (and hug) everyone that walks in.  Maybe because, when I asked him for recommendations, he says things like \"I make the pizza dough in house with a two-day rise,\" \"I make the tiramisu with a genoise,\" \"I make most of our breads for wholesale, but I put some aside for us,\" and my favorite, \"I made the peach panna cotta this morning, but I think I sold it all.\"  It's kind of like having your grandma reincarnated as a humble Italian man.  Pizza diavolo was delish--if you make your own pizza, you know that an overnight rise at a minimum is a must--and surprisingly filling; the ricotta tortellini with short rib ragu tasted like something my Grandma would make, in a good way.  Mozzarella is also made in-house, and the caprese salad was better for it.   We finished the meal with his tiramisu; I personally prefer my tiramisu to have the texture of an Italian tres leches cake, so if you like yours on the drier side, this is your place.   Also, the tiramisu was actually a bit frozen in the center...but again, I can't help but like the place regardless. All of this was washed down with a glass of white wine, two words beginning with a B at the end of the BTG menu, that was fabulous--round and peachy like a Sancerre but with a crisp Pinot Grigio/Sauv Blanc finish.", "author": "Ashley B."}

The great food kept me going back, and I am very glad I did.  They have worked out the service issues that had concerned me before and now it is just the restaurant with the best pizza in the city.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  The restaurant itself is small (cozy) but well decorated.  It's like a little piece of Italy in the Financial District.  The pizza is ahhhhhmazing.  I highly recommend the prosciutto and burrata and the diavolo.  I have yet to try the pasta and other entrees only because I can not be steered away from the pizza.  The rolls they serve are incredibly delicious as well.  I can't recommend this place enough.  I am glad to see it getting so popular and would encourage anyone to try it.", "author": "Michael C."}

When we walked in, we felt like we were in a small neighborhood cafe in Italy, not right in the middle of the financial district. We started with one of the daily specials - the Potato Gnocchi in Meat Sauce. The pasta was perfectly cooked and tender, covered by a marinara sauce with a delicious blend of meats. We followed the Gnocchi with a specialty white pizza featuring carmelized onions, roasted almonds, green olives, and huge dollops of mozzarella cheese - exquisite flavors, honestly the most delicious pizza we've ever had! The two dishes were so filling that we even took some of our pizza back to the hotel. We will definitely be back on our next visit to San Francisco!", "author": "Ellen B."}

I really have nothing bad to say about this place--I had an excellent meal. The decor was simple--dark with exposed brick interior; the place was small and smelled great; and peeking at other diners' plates elicited serious salivation. Everything looked delicious, and my friend and I settled on the grilled calimari appetizer, which was great--tender and flavorful! Although many menu options looked wonderful, I opted for a favorite dish (but seldom-ordered)--spaghetti carbonara. The half order was great (I could have eaten the whole order but restrained myself, and was proud of it!) and not expensive. The chocolate mousse for dessert was also lovely. Our waiter, I believe, was the owner, and he was extremely professional and courteous without being aloof, inattentive, or, on the other hand, overbearing. Though the immediate surroundings leave something to be desired, if you find yourself in the area I recommend this place, and I would absolutely return for a meal during my next trip to San Francisco. The pizza did look amazing!", "author": "Corinna L."}
