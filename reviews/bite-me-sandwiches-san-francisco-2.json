When picking a spot for our weekly office lunch, I decided to try Bite Me Sandwiches. Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, July 28th around 12 noon.\n\nI got the San Fran: Chicken breast, bacon, avocado, jack cheese, mayo, mustard, Mojo (special garlic sauce, contains mayo) lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onions, banana peppers, and pepperoncini on Sliced Sourdough ($13.35) and Chips: Zesty Jalapeno ($2.45). I loved all the ingredients in the sandwich, but I wanted more filling. I love giant sandwiches since I'm not the biggest bread person. Also, I felt like the sandwich was a little dry. The chicken was actually pieces of chicken breast, so it needed more sauce or something for added moisture. The chips were your standard kettle cooked chips. Nice and crunchy. A coworker of mine also ordered the Macaroni Salad ($4.05 small). I had a bite and enjoyed it with some hot sauce. She loved it and finished the whole thing.\n\nGlad I was able to try Bite Me. Plus, who doesn't love the name of this place?! But do I want to bite into them again? Probably not. There are better sandwich shops out there.", "author": "Elena N."}

When you see a bunch of meat listed on sandwich, you may think you're getting a cold cut monster like the J.J. Gargantuan, but the meat portions never get absurd.  Probably better for your blood pressure and cholesterol in the long run.\n\nAbe: Simply Pastrami & Swiss Cheese.  This is *not* your typical NY-style deli pastrami.  It is thinly sliced, a modest portion and loaded with tons of fixings.  With all the other toppings going on, it was hard to really appreciate the meat as distinctly pastrami instead of just some random cold cut.  It was tasty for sure, just leave your fixed pastrami notions at the door.\n\nItalian Hoagie: Four types of Italian cold cuts (ham, prosciutto, mortadella, salami), but didn't seem like an overwhelming amount of meat.  With all the flavorful toppings *and* a big splash of Italian dressing, the meat was overshadowed a bit.  Loved the holistic flavor profile, but far from a gut buster.", "author": "Adam B."}

There was only one person in the place.\n\nMe - Yes! No waiting in line! Sweet.\n\nThere were two dudes behind the counter. One did obviously not want to help me at all. I couldn't tell if he was actually working there or not. The other guy finally came over and was friendly.\n\nI ordered the Danny Zuko as recommended on Sour Dough. (I'm sorry people, I just don't like Dutch Crunch. Hate on haters.) I asked for it with mustard and he said it comes with everything, question mark. Me - yes, everything. Then he listed everything off which I found reassuring and made me more convinced I wanted it all.\n\nspoiler - I want it all.\n\nI took the sandwich to go. It was nice and warm in my hands. Ate it at the office, all of it. Every last bite. The turkey was nice and fresh, not sliced. It was juicy but not overly so. It dripped on the wax paper, but not on my desk. Always appreciated. After finishing the first half I went for the second. Very full, but not in an uncomfortable way. It was spicy, but with just enough kick to be spicy and no lingering pain. Really good all around. I'd go back and try something else for sure.\n\nNot a five though. Really solid sandwich. Nice service once the right guy came over, good menu, nice ingredients, but I didn't moan out loud or embarrass myself or anything which means it was excellent, but not orgasmic.", "author": "A. T."}

Ingredients are generic quality and stingy. \n\nIf you go here, try to get something as basic as possible... they really need to up their game.

I ordered the Axel Foley (I do like the movie genre names for their food) - and took it back to work. \n\nThe AF is hot links and pastrami w/jack cheese. The hot links were so-so, and there was so little pastrami it's hard to make a judgement. \n\nSecond and last visit - walked in, again into a cloud of some unknown odor that can suppress your appetite - not sure was it was. This time I tried the Dude Abides - meatball with bbq sauce and cheddar cheese. When I asked if I could swap the cheddar for mozzarella, I was chastised and told I needed to stick with what they came up with -I just obliged out of just being stunned. It was fairly bland, nothing special - I think the bbq sauce is just something out of safeway. \n\nNo thanks Bite Me - I tried, twice - too many other places to sample.", "author": "Tom C."}

Also, their service is terribly slow. Therefore, I always end up ordering by phone and in advance the simple ham and cheese.\n\nThese sandwiches are nothing specially unique or original, when it comes to flavor.

My go to favorite is Lou's Cafe, but I was in this neighborhood and went in to try them out. I was there in the middle of the afternoon, and there were no other customers at the time. So, hard to evaluate loudness or how slow they might be when busy (presumably during lunch rush). I was greeted fairly quickly from the friendly counter person when I came in. I was not in a hurry, and I would describe the service (making the sandwich) as leisurely. Or perhaps she was just particular in what she was doing. I had the San Fran (chicken, avocado, bacon, jack). I always look for avocado-containing choices and they have several on the menu. The food is the reason to come. Prices are on the lower side for premium sandwiches in SF ($7-8). Loved their bread and the combo. The decor and furnishings are pretty informal/industrial/minimal.

Now on to the taste of the sandwich,  it was not good at all and with today being in the 80's the last thing I want is a super dry sandwich.  They would need to triple the amount of condiments used to make it tastes ok, and same also for my lady sandwich.  So the last thing that pissed me off was they used the oldest trick in the book for sandwich Makin, and that not adding no meat on both ends of the sandwich.
