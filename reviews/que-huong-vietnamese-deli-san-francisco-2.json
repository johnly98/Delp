While not the best, this place is decent and it's worth repeat visits. Even my folks liked their version and that's coming from an old world palate. The banh cuon cha lua (fancy pork roll) is the way to go.\n\nYou can get banh uot instead as it doesn't have fillings. However, banh uot allows you to include sides; besides cha lua you may add charbroiled pork, shredded pork skin, roast pork, have it vegetarian, etc. Their other items such as Bun Thit Nuong was okay - too much lemongrass in the pork marinade. Goi Ga (chicken salad with cabbage) is bland and needs a lot of nuoc mam.\n\nThe place is a hole in the wall but there are limited seating inside, maybe for half a dozen eaters. People getting to-go orders is more common. Note cash only, and you may order through the yelp app. They close a bit too early at 6pm.", "author": "Peter L."}

That might be how you feel sitting on Irving, among dozens of mom-and-pop Chinese restaurants, but it's okay. I know you're here.\n\nInstead of venturing out for delicious but pricey banh mi out in FiDi, as I'm apt to do, I come here for packed and tasty sandwiches. Fun fact: banh mi is much more popular among Vietnamese American communities than it is in Vietnam. You can take the colonialism out of Asia, but you can't take the resentment out, that's for sure.\n\nHistorical tidbit aside, I come here for their cha lua and nem nuong. They have other classics, like xiu mai and bo kho, and non-sandwich dishes like banh cuon and bun thit nuong. Although it's still expensive compared to a Lee's Sandwiches in San Jose, I think this is as good as it gets. Emily T. mentioned that this was her childhood haunt, and I totally see why. The prices are affordable, hovering around $6 for a sandwich that comes packed with pickled veggies and meat, and there's loads of Chinese and Vietnamese customers streaming in. If you want jalape\u00f1os, you'll have to ask, but they don't cost extra. \n\nThe kicker is the kewpie mayo/butter they smear on the inside. If it's anything they don't skimp on, it's that. I love getting globs of super soft, creamy butter oozing out as I squish it down. When you choose to add pate, as I always do, they also layer it on thick. They use the well-spiced good stuff -- not too salty, but very much so the liver we love and adore. These both make the bread, which often errs on the side of 'scrape-your-gums' crusty, much more palatable.\n\nGet your dessert fix here, too. They have lots of traditional drinks and desserts, meaning that you can get your che ba mau and soybean milk here. I've seen people order fruit milkshakes as well, although I never have.\n\nThere's limited seating, so I'd take it to-go and sit in your car, which is inevitably parked in a spot just off Irving that's about a foot too short for your trunk. I promise you that no matter where you're eating it, though, it's downright delicious.", "author": "Gwen W."}

They use a lot of fillers in their items now and started charging more on top of that. The sandwiches are ok, but they don't bother to cut off the fat which isn't very appetizing when you get a mouth full of rubbery fat.

We were driving thru SF on our way out of town and I was looking for places that sold bubble tea (boba) that wouldn't be too far out of the way off of 19th Ave.  I looked on Yelp and found TeaWay on Irving at 21st Ave, and it was the ONLY place advertised as being open at that hour.  SO - we ventured to TeaWay only to find IT closed and the tiny deli next door open.  I peeked in, and after looking at their drink menu, I was convinced they sold boba, so we ordered a banh mi and spring rolls and I ordered the fresh watermelon with boba.  \"We don't have boba here.\"  ugh. \n\nAND they don't take plastic.  Husband had to go to Wells Fargo 2 blocks down the street.  \n\nHow was the food?  I LOVED the spring rolls.  They put BASIL in them!  Wow.  What a lovely burst of flavor and an unexpected change of pace!  The (get this) pan-fried bbq chicken banh mi was just ok.  Tell me, though... how would one define \"pan-fried bbq\"?  Is it pan fried and then put on a grill?  Or grilled THEN fried?  At any rate, for all that cooking prep, I'd expect a little more flavor.  The chicken was bland and uninteresting.\n\nThe bread was definitely on the older side.  I saw the lady pick up a roll and question if she should use it.  She shrugged her shoulders and started slicing it in half.  steeeeeRIKE.\n\nWe were able to watch them prepare their banh mi varieties for the day, so when we unwrapped our sandwich (in the car, long gone at this point), we were very disappointed to see that they did not put any pate on ours, as they had on EVERY other sandwich we watched them make.  boo.\n\nThat aside, the sandwich was difficult to eat because the cucumbers were cut so thick, as were the carrots.  And there was no extra sauce/flavor on the sandwich to make me go WOW.  I honestly don't think there was even a jalapeno!\n\nHere's what I'll say about the sandwich:  My husband and I shared HALF of the banh mi, and never went back for the rest.  It was $4.  I'm not one who enjoys saying \"Ah, just toss it in the trash! It was only $4!\" because I really hate wasting food.  But - it was only $4, and it was worth about $2.\n\nIf you read other reviews about this place and their lackluster customer service, we experienced THE exact same thing.  Don't expect niceties.  Don't expect idle conversation while the lady makes your sandwich.  Just go in, order, pay cash and go.\n\nI am very curious to know what the deal was w/ TeaWay next door.

What sets this place apart from your usual Vietnamese sandwich joint is how they handle the bread and the meat. The bread is always toasted to a perfect crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle! The meat, especially the bbq chicken, is surprisingly tender, juicy, and sweet. The sandwiches are perfect for lunch since the size is not too big or too small. These little details definitely separate this shop from a place like Lee's sandwiches and make the extra dollar or two worth the admission price. \n\nIf your looking for something more filling, you can't go wrong with the bbq pork or pan fried bbq-chicken vermicelli orders with imperial rolls. Its a tad more expensive (about $7), but that's the usual price for vermicelli. The fish sauce is totally different from other Vietnamese restaurants in that its sweeter and has a kick that compliments the meats and noodles deliciously well!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-07", "description": "This place will always be close to my heart.  I consider it to be the undisputed champion of Vietnamese sandwiches in the Outer Sunset.  Que Huong used to be even more hole in the wall than it is now, operating a few stores down from their current location in what could only be described as a shoebox.  However in a shocking twist of fate they were evicted, leading to the scariest 30 seconds of my life when one Saturday morning, as I approached my favorite sandwich spot eager to taste that sweet Vietnamese nectar on my tongue, I placed my hand on the usually wide-open door and found it to be locked and bolted! Empty, cold, cleaned-out. I hadn't even been given a chance to say goodbye.  My one true love was dead.  I almost flung myself into traffic right then and there.  But luckily I didn't because miraculously they rented out a new location on the same block and were open for business that day!!  I saw to my delighted surprise that their new place was even roomier (now with tables for customers!), a testament to their success.  I ordered my sub and let the juices run down my chin.  Chewing and weeping, I thanked the sandwich lady and skipped down the middle of the street as a double rainbow lit up the sky.  I tell you, unidentifiable mechanically-separated mystery pork has never tasted as good as it did that day.\n\nThe cuisine at Que Huong is hand-crafted by two sweaty women who work the counter without a break from dawn to dusk.  They are ultra-efficient sandwich-making machines!  Each sandwich has it's own magic flavor, but all come on a freshly-toasted french baguette.  Que Huong's baguettes are crunchier than Eternal Springs', and a bit smaller.  However the sandwiches are always packed with meat.  Each sandwich also comes with a cucumber spear and shredded carrots soaked in what must be crack cocaine because I am so fucking addicted to it.  In fact I always order extra veggies on my sandwich at Que Huong, guaranteeing that I will get not one but two cucumber spears and a heaping spoonful of their pickled carrots in secret yum sauce. Warning: I think this place also uses straight up butter as a spread.  So if you're looking to lose weight, stop reading now.\n\nSo you're at Que Huong and you're ready to go to flavor country?  Let's discuss some options. The king of all Viet subs is the pork combo, and QH's combo sub is OF THE GODS.  Layer upon layer of thick juicy salty meat.  I can't tell you what kind of pork they use, because like all Vietnamese sandwich meat it is largely unidentifiable. I CAN tell you however that it is damn yummy.  Mixed into the combo you may find some kind of pork cake, as well as some kind of pork with a perfect ring of fat around it, and of course the aptly-named \"fancy pork\". Together this blend is a cacophony of flavor, very meaty.  After all these years, the pork combo is still my favorite, my go-to.  Looking to branch out a bit?  Try option two: the pate sandwich.  This is not for beginners.  It is only (ready for this?) pate and veggies (and hella butter).  If you've never tried Vietnamese pate, I recommend ordering the combo sub, then take your finger and rub along the inside of the bread (just shove it right into your sandwich... that's right, just like that, that's good).  See that dark paste all over your finger, lick it.  Your welcome.  Now imagine a sandwich FILLED with that shit.  I love that sandwich, like sexually.  Warning, if you eat the entire thing in one sitting you may feel icky (that's a lot of pate you're eating).  Another option (here's a curveball): the vegetarian sandwich.  I know what you're thinking: \"Why would I ever eat a vegetarian sandwich?? What do you think I am, some sort of vegan hippie scum???\"  No no, calm down, it's not like that.  This sandwich is still super unhealthy so we're good!  The veggies are dripping in grease (despite the prominently displayed \"No Grease\" sign hanging behind the counter).  The sandwich, though lacking pate, is bursting forth with hot salty mushrooms, squashes, other stuff, fried tofu, and all the other accoutrements.  Trust me, it's legit.  A great alternative if you're not feeling pork but you still want to eat a pound of butter.\n\nThere are of course other great things on the menu.  All the pork dishes (with the exception of shredded pork) are absolutely delectable.  Try the roast pork, bbq chicken, anything really it's all good.  Finish it off by popping next door to Tea Way or Quickly for some boba (Quickly is excellent as you know, but Tea Way lets you scoop your own boba!).  Overall I give the Sunset Viet sub experience a 4.5 out of 5. If it wasn't for the questionable quality of the meat, this place would be a perfect 5!", "author": "Jonathan S."}

The sandwiches are made by the gods themselves. Four dollars for pure bliss; now that's what I would call a good deal. It's really speedy, and you can see the ladies making it right in front of you (so you can see what they put into your sandwich). \nLet's start off with the banh mi. The best one that everyone gets is the BBQ pork, which is one of the best foods I'd ever had (basically, it's now a staple in my fridge). The meat is super seasoned and tender, and the bread is crisp, yet oh-so-soft on the inside, basically a bite of heaven. The veggies they put inside taste super fresh and the sauce they put over the sandwich is really tasty. I like to add pate for $0.50, because it takes the sandwich to a whole different level, and it mixes nicely with the juices of the pork. \nAnother great dish is the steamed rice noodles with BBQ chicken. Of course there is pork, too, but I prefer having a variety of meats, once in a while. I really enjoy this dish because it's piping hot when you get it and the sauce is really something- it's not like other sauces, a little bit sweeter and milder.
