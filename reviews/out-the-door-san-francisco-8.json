Not bad, but nothing that made me think \"Ooooh this is interesting!\" or \"Wow so tasty\".\n\nThis is a review for their brunch menu at the Bush location. It's pretty limited, and you won't see some of their classic items (like my favorite Claypot Chicken from Slanted Door/ what you can find at the Ferry Building location on weekend brunches). I suggest that if you want tastier food, you should check out the location at the Ferry Building. It's significantly less comfortable a dining location because there's only a little bar and some standing tables there, but they share a kitchen with their sister restaurant Slanted Door, which serves the same dishes at about 2-3x the price. ANYWAY,\n\nFor brunch, I came with a group and between us we got the soi man roll, spring rolls, chicken pho, beef pho, chicken congee, and banh mi. Honestly, there wasn't much else to choose from. I usually do quite enjoy rice plates, but looking at other reviews and pictures the food looked pretty dry. Table beside us ordered the rice plates and they looked dry to me. \n\nMy beef pho was pretty flavorful. The broth was good. There wasn't much meat in it, but that was alright for me. I think the quality of the beef is pretty decent here. However, at $15 for a regular pho, I'd get it elsewhere. It was definitely passable, at-the-very-least average pho. The thing is, if not because my friends wanted to come here, I probably would not come here for pho. I got the pho because I just wasn't too enticed by the other dishes. Chicken congee is usually pretty good here, but I wasn't feeling another grain dish after the soi man roll (sticky rice). \n\nSoi man roll was alright, spring rolls were alright. Too much vermicelli and not enough greens for me in the spring rolls. Also, they definitely put like a bit of mayo or something on the pork, or margarine? It was a little less flavorful than mayo, but oddly greasy and creamy. I didn't really like that addition since I like my spring rolls refreshing. I mean, like Spring, right!?\n\nOur server turned out to be very attentive and nice. But when we first entered, the staff wasn't helpful at all. Saw us standing and waiting to get seated with our reservation, but just kinda looked at us and stood at the back. I was like uhhhhhhhh... but then after a while he looked to his coworker and sloooowly sauntered over. Sloooowly sauntered to seat us at a table in the far back in the dark. Place was very empty so it wasn't like he was busy tbh. Our server however, was a different person, who was way more effective at his job and very friendly and nice.", "author": "Su Lin Y."}

It always tastes very seafood-y/fish-y to me, and I have a real seafood aversion.\n\nHaving written that, a friend recommended it, and I saw there were vegetarian options, so away we went. Boy, am I glad I did!\n\nShe started with some fresh spring rolls (they had shrimp in them so I passed, but she loved them). She then had the green papaya salad, which looked super fresh, and again, she really enjoyed; I asked them to make the grilled 5-spiced chicken with tofu instead of chicken, and they complied -- and it was delicious!\n\nMy one unfavorable comment I'd share is it was pretty expensive for lunch -- over $60 for what I described here, plus coffee and tea. So I might suggest saving it for a special occasion or for dinner.

For one it was a tad hard to find because there's no huge sign denoting the restaurant.  Only if you walk by can you see the small menus on the windows of the restaurant. Upon entering the vicinity you can visually see that it is spacious and very modern. The decor is pleasing to the eye, but the servers on the other hand killed that ambience for me. I was going to dine in, but it took the front so long to just acknowledge me and to just let me know that there will be a small wait that when she approach me I just asked for the to-go service. She pointed to the bar and said I could order there. \n\nUpon encountering the bar I grabbed a seat and waited a bit for a menu or for the servers/bartenders to ask for what I wanted. 10 minutes in and no help. I can understand the idea that you are busy, but it doesn't hurt to let a customer know that you would be right with them. \n\nThe bartender finally came over and handed me a menu quickly and tended to other customers. At least I received a menu. I waited about another five to ten minutes, but it seemed like a life time, to get my order taken. I order a simple dish and iced coffee. \n\nThe order time took about another 20-25 minutes because I finished an episode of Friends while waiting. \n\nI took the food to work, which is across the street, and delved right into it.\n\nFor the price I paid it was just average. There are better Vietnamese restaurants in the city that have better pricing and service. Don't waste your time here. I wouldn't recommend this place.", "author": "Daw M."}

It's near the Filmore District that has a lot of nice shops and some nice restaurants that you can walk to. You kind of have to know where this places is to find it or you will miss it. It is across from Walgreens, which help, but there is no sign on the door. It just says OTD.\n\nOn the food, we ordered lemongrass chicken, crispy imperial rolls, grilled pork with spicy sauce, and jicama and grapefruit salad. Everything came out great. We started with the imperial rolls, which I wish there was more of because they were so good. They came out hot and crisp. The sauce was sweet and bit tangy. The grilled pork was my favorite thing. I love anything with a fried egg, and the spicy sauce was amazing. I wish the pork was sauteed and in it and then had more served on the side, but the next time I go, I'll just ask for extra. The grapefruit salad was light and refreshing and I also enjoyed the chicken. The lemongrass gave it a nice taste and it wasn't overwhelmed by the the sauce.\n\nI love tea as well, and I really liked the green tea that I got as well as the presentation. My friends got the vietnamese coffee. It looked great, but was entirely too sweet for me. \n\nService was quick and they got the food out to us quickly. If I was by myself I would probably sit at the bar to have a view of the kitchen.\n\nI'll be back when I'm town. Hopefully my favorites will still be on the menu.", "author": "Alanna T."}

They serve all the hits from the Slanted Door menu and everything is prepared, plated, and tastes exactly the same.\n\nWe had a reservation for 4 of us around 6:30 on a weekday and were seated right on time. There was still plenty of space at the bar area both when we arrived and when we left, so smaller groups could definitely get by without a reservation if you go early.\n\nThere's an excellent wine and cocktail list. Our table had 1 bottle of Donkey and Goat \"Twinkle\" Mourv\u00e8dre (exactly what this means, I don't know, but it was local, fantastic and slightly effervescent) which paired pretty well with the dishes we ordered.\n\nBetween 4 of us we shared the imperial rolls, dungeness crab noodles, jicama and grapefruit salad, roasted vegetables and fried chicken. The portions were enough for everyone to get a taste, but we weren't completely full. This is definitely a restaurant you come to for the seasonal flavors and pairings, rather than the portions. Even so, for the price, a bit more food on the plate would be nice. The imperial rolls and dungeness crab are completely worth it though. I've visited multiple locations and order both dishes every time. \n\nI also prefer this location over the Ferry Building because of the staff. The staff here are friendlier (probably because they are less rushed) and very helpful with navigating food allergies. I am allergic to wheat so they were able to modify dishes to be gluten free no problem. The restaurant is small, but feels cozy rather than cramped.

The friend I was with had been there for lunch and loved it, so suggested for dinner.  Not impressed.  We did not have a dinner reservation and it was a Friday night, so yes, that's our fault, but hostess was so rude and unwelcoming, that we should of walked out then.  Instead, after hearing her rambling on about how booked they were, she led us to the counter overlooking the kitchen.  That was the best seat in the house if you ask me, however the place is small, over crowded and lots of diners with screaming kids.  AND i know it's SFO, but the prices were outrageous, and I am from NYC, so usually much doesn't surprise me - and for the serving size, forget. Oh, and smallest wine pour on the planet.  Maybe 3.5 ounces for $13.00 glass - we decided to start with two appetizers - the shrimp dumplings and the imperial rolls - literally both were to delivered to our table within 7 minutes - didn't even have a bite in our mouth when the waitress came over and wanted to take our dinner order.  We told her were would like to get through our appetizers first, and our small wine pour, before ordering dinner.  That apparently did not sit well with her because five minutes later she was breathing down our necks. That's when I decided I did not want to spend another minute in this place or anymore money I had to on bad service, okay food and being way over charged.  Once we told her we would not be staying for dinner, she rushed over the check and stormed off.  Such a horrible experience - never going back.", "author": "Lauren A P."}

My intention was to make it the best birthday for him even though I didn't have much time to make plans.  I called to make a reservation and the lady on the phone was pretty short.  I explained to her that it was a special celebration and as much as I tried to explain the situation, it felt like she didn't want to listen or was too busy to help me out.  I think I remember some fuss about not being able to guarantee the reservation.  I asked her about the menu and seemed like she was pre-occupied.  When we got there, we were seated at the bar.  I asked to see if we could be seated at a normal table if one comes up, though their attitude wasn't very warm - even though I told them that it was a special occasion.  \n\nWe ordered an appetizer and two mains.  The food was ok, though not absolutely amazing.  It was standard Vietnamese food, though pricey because of the ambience, decor and atmosphere.  They were dishes that we would likely be able to make ourselves at home.  As it was his birthday, I tried my best to make the best out of the situation.  We watched our food being made at the bar which was nice and entertaining.  They were able to coordinate a piece of cake with a birthday candle and I was grateful that they were able to do something to make my love's day.  \n\nService was good, though I would really recommend improving the front of house service!  First impressions are massively important and I googled this place as a recommendation from their sister company.  Will likely go to another place for a special occasion next time.

One per person is enough, and the flavor was good + sauce was divine. (I'm all about the sauces!)  \n\nHue bean Dumpling--Surprisingly, I liked this better than the shrimp dumpling, and trust me, I am NOT a veggie/vegan person normally. The dumplings were bite-sized (in comparison to the shrimp dumplings which were the size of a coaster) but came in orders of 6. They had a very nice sweet, starchy flavor to them that went well with the salt of the sauce they were dipped in. \n\nRolls: \n\nCrispy Imperial Roll--In my opinion, this is a MUST-get. Everything about this roll is right in terms of texture and flavor. The fried roll complimented by the crunchy peanuts complimented by the lettuce. All is right in the world with this roll. \n\nSoup: \n\nDungeness Crab + Corn Soup. I know you may not want to spend your calories here filling up on soup, but the broth was amazing and the sweetness of the corn went well with the sweetness of the crab. If you're into soup, you will not regret the decision to get this. \n\nMains: \n\nDungeness Crab Noodles--This was my favorite dish in terms of flavor. It's power-packed with all things good and they give you a hearty helping of crab meat. \n\nChicken Clay Pot--The clay pot is where it's at. The only complaint at the table was that this was dark-meat chicken and not white-meat chicken. I loved it, and wanted to basically lick up every part of the caramel sauce. Would highly suggest getting a side of rice for maximum sauce-sopping. \n\nVegetables: \n\nCorn Dish--LOVED everything they served with corn. It was very sweet, perfectly cooked, and I wanted to eat it with everything. \n\nOverall the service was amazing.

But, OTD is not just overpriced Vietnamese food for yuppies as other reviewers have stated. To compare Charles Phan's food with a cheap Pho joint is comparing durian and jackfruit. This restaurant uses top notch local ingredients and the freshness of the produce and meat is obvious. It truly reminds me of Vietnamese food that I have had in the fanciest of restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City. \n\nThe Imperial rolls and papaya salad are to die for and the yummy tea selection is a great accompaniment to all the dishes. Pretty much everything I've tried here is super tasty. Again, the FRESHNESS  to me really sets the food here apart from the rest. What's also great for me is that my young kids love the food here. Unlike most restaurants, the menu items at OTD appeal to both parents and kids, so the little ones don't have to resort to some janky chicken tender/spaghetti kids' menu. Fresh veggies are in almost every menu item, and my kids gobble it all up because the dishes are prepared with so much flavor to appeal to even the most discerning toddler palettes. \n\nThe ambiance is minimalist, industrial, and modern. But, the design surprisingly still gives off a cozy and homey feel. Also, this restaurant is clearly managed well because the servers are all on point, the place is very clean, and with it being busy pretty much all the time it runs like a well oiled machine. Service and ambiance goes a long way. Yes, you pay a little more for this experience versus the super authentic Pho #56 type place because all things considered, the rent in Pac Heights is higher, the servers and staff are well trained and experienced, and quality food just costs more. \n\nHonestly, this place is so good they don't even need a sign outside. Clearly the people in the neighborhood know it is here and appreciate its goodness. There are so many regulars that eat here daily, yes daily.

Definitely a pricier version of your typical Vietnamese food, but this restaurant has minor tweaks that bring the \"fusion\" to the restaurant. Spacious and minimalistic decor with attentive servers. I had the lychee tea, but it lacked lychee flavor. We started off with the Soi Man Roll, which is very similar to the dish Com Suon (Vietnamese rice plate), but made into Banh Tet form. There was an egg inside which is not usual in the Viet dish, but it definitely brought a texture and taste I really liked. The fish sauce helps with the flavor too. Being that I like the chicken pho at Slanted Door, I opted in for pho because it never disappoints & sure enough, it didn't. The broth was super rich in flavor and plentiful noodles to leave me full. My sister had their beef with really crispy baby potatoes and egg and my mother had the 5-spice chicken with a poached egg (the fusion part) on top. The chicken had a very nice crisp to the outside and juicy chicken on the inside - chicken done right! My mother is also a fan of coconut and panna cotta so we had that for dessert.

It was Brothe's Birthday and he had the best time! Your staff were tremendous in every way. I appreciate that you went above and beyond to make sure everyone in our party was taken care of. You asked each person individually if they had food allergies. That was kind of you. \n\nHere's the deal, OTD: I think you're hella cute. You mean well. And you're in a posh little nook of SF. However, with that being said I believe it's important to acknowledge the weaknesses in our relationship. Though I think you're hella cute, I know you're over charging me based on your expensive outfit and sleek atmosphere. \n\nWhy anyone would pay $36 for 6 meager, scallop sized bites of shaking beef is beyond my comprehension. I LOVE shaking beef. Yours was not up to par. It was overcooked and flavorless. It should have been tender and succulent but it just wasn't. Your spare rib appetizer also had the potential to be outstanding. But the rib meat was so tough and laborious to get off the bone I couldn't enjoy it. The sauce was scrumptious but the meat fell short. I also didn't care for your cellophane noodles. They were bland :(\n\nI am not an idiot. I know I'm paying you almost like one would pay for an escort: for you're good looks and fast, filling appeal. That's why I keep coming back for your shrimp spring rolls and imperial rolls. They're very, very satisfying. In fact, your shrimp spring rolls are the best I've ever tasted. I was also pleased with your string beans and chicken clay pot, though the portions were \u00fcber tiny. \n\nOTD, I really gotta give it up to your happy endings. You do know how to please people. You really got my loins burning once the desserts started bursting out. One after the other they just kept getting better and better. The ginger cookie and ice cream was unexpectedly packed with decadent, usual flavor. The moist cake with pineapple custard was phenomenal. And of course, since you are by nature a crowd pleaser, the chocolate peanut butter pie was to die for. Must haves to end the OTD experience. \n\nLike I said earlier, I know we can never take our relationship to the next level because you're over priced and you know how to work me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-11-13", "description": "Disappointing, lackluster dishes: the jicama and grapefruit salad (which I've had many times at the Slanted Door), was shockingly bad, a plate of red cabbage with three faint slivers of jicama; this was not a main ingredient, but more like a garnish, and 4 small pink grapefruit slices. The salad I've come to expect should be sparkling clean, with bright bold explosive flavors, tangy and slightly sweet, layered and complex. This salad was nothing like what I've had before. It was basically a shredded pile of red cabbage. The dressing was flat and barely covered it, the candied pecans seemed an afterthought. I ate it only because I was starving. We got the fried chicken and brussel sprouts, the chicken was excellent, terrific flavor of breading, crunchy and faintly sweet, with pickles on the side and shredded carrots. It's solely because of the fantastic chicken that I'm giving two stars. The sprouts as a side were awful; not crispy and not braised properly, they were insipid with zero flavor, and if a Vietnamese restaurant can't do flavor, it has nothing going for it. We also got the panna cotta with passion fruit gelee and coconut flakes; this was good, not great, the texture was firmer and not as creamy than what I've had at Slanted Door. Am I being unreasonable comparing it? I don't think so ... a pile of raw cabbage and mushed sprouts just doesn't cut it, especially not at these prices. The saving grace was the service, which was awesome, our server friendly, patient, and efficient. And of course, the acoustics are a nightmare for aging ears, all hard surfaces, noise bouncing off ricocheting from table to counter to walls. We got out of there as fast as we could. I don't get it: the Phan experience is something to write home about, but something was sorely off in the execution of these dishes. Because of the remarkable chicken, I know the kitchen has cred and potential, but it needs a serious tune-up, re-training, or overhaul, and someone to oversee the subtleties of each dish as it goes out, e.g. a plate of barely dressed raw cabbage with three microscopic slivers of jicama ... seriously?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-21", "description": "I had no idea there was an Out the Door in Lower Pac Heights. I was bummed about the closure of the one at the Westfield Shopping Centre as it was the only decent place to eat in the food court that didn't require taking a tray to a table that was never available. They had to close it because of a flooding issue, and there is now a useless Asian import store in its place, at least useless to me since I'm not in the market for a ceramic elephant flower stand. Anyway, I was taken to this location by a colleague new to the city who was thrilled with Charles Phan's operation. I remember that euphoric feeling when I went to Slanted Door for the first time two locations ago in the Mission.\n\nIn the meantime, so many like-minded upscale Vietnamese restaurants have come and gone that I have forgotten how good the food can be in the right hands. I was with two people, so I was able to share a number of dishes that would have been elusive to me otherwise. We started with two of the classic $10 rolls - the first was the Spring Rolls with shrimp, pork shoulder, and mint rolled in transparent rice paper and served with a spicy peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/13Qft3Q); the other was he Crispy Imperial Rolls, deep-fried with pork, shrimp, mint, peanuts and red leaf lettuce (photo: http://bit.ly/18xlqM2). Both were expertly executed, immaculately presented and resonantly flavorful. Who am I to complain if the prices are roughly twice those to be found in the family-run holes-in-the-wall in Little Saigon?\n\nWe then shared three entrees, and while none sang out with transcendent glory, each offered certain joys. The first was the $20 Stir-Fried Louisiana Prawns with Roasted Chiles and Ginger in Caramel Sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1dOC2Me). Yes, I wrote 'Caramel Sauce'...and the sweet-savory combo fell short in this case even though the prawns were big and fresh. The second was quite pricey for the quantity, the $36 Shaking Beef since it was made with fancy-schmancy Grass-Fed Estancia Ranch Filet Mignon and mixed with Watercress and Red Onions in a Lime Sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/14w2DOu). Of course, it was deliciously tender. It had to be as there would have been a riot otherwise. It was certainly the priciest shaking beef I've ever had. The third dish was the cheapest and ironically the most satisfying.\n\nIt was the $18 Dungeness Crab mixed with Cellophane Noodles, Garlic, Green Onion and Sesame Oil (photo: http://bit.ly/15Amusz). I basically love any noodle dish, and the unadventurous flavor match between the see-through noodles and the shards of fresh crab really worked together. Our evening was just getting going at that point, so we decided to have $2.50 Pacific Espressos (photo: http://bit.ly/12GdgsR) and share the $8 Strawberry-Pistachio Tart, which provided bitefuls of creamy sweetness to the end of our meal (photo: http://bit.ly/14w2RFn). The 2011 Giornata \"Il Campo\" from the Central Coast was the lovely, hearty Sangiovese red that accompanied our meal. We closed the place as the staff gathered at the community table eating housemade burritos that looked awfully good. Too bad they won't be on the menu.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...upscale Phan creations are tasty, keep your credit card warm\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious and modern like the late, lamented Westfield place (photo: http://bit.ly/15AoMI6)\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice enough, not overly warm\nTOTAL - 4 stars...now I have another Out the Door to go out the door for", "author": "Ed U."}

I have been coming to this Out The Door restaurant since it opened.  It is down the street from my house and is a great place to take friends who want to try something delicious and different.  Last week I wanted to surprise my niece with a lovely dinner out for the holidays, so of course I made a reservation here.  I was so excited to take her so she could see what a great unique place this is to have dinner. \n\nLike I said I live in the neighborhood and have eaten here more times than I can count. I even do take out on occasion when I want to treat myself after a long day. I have always been greeted by name as I am a regular.  Last week I was more than disappointed and may not return.  Here are the bullet points:\n\n* We were seated and waited TEN minutes to be acknowledged by the waitress\n*When she arrived there was no apology so I said \"Oh we are so excited. This is her first time here!\" The waitress barely cracked a smile and was visibly uninterested.\n*She disappeared for awhile and then finally returned.  I ordered a glass of wine and we said we need just another minute to order.  My wine came about ten minutes later again.  She had disappeared and had clearly forgotten to put in the order because as she reappeared she saw me and went over to get the wine.  We ordered the food.\n* The food came and was just delicious and savory.  My niece was delighted. BUT we never saw the waitress again. SHE NEVER CAME BACK!\nI was not asked if I wanted another glass of wine, never asked if the food was ok or if we needed anything else. What kind of service is that... She again had disappeared in the back.\n* Then to make matters worse, when she did appear she was talking with the other staff AND THEN sat down at the bar and started eating her dinner with her back to us.\n\nNow mind you the restaurant wasn't crowded as with all holidays in SF people head out and places are less crowded.\n\nI was appalled by the lack of service and her blatant disrespect for the customers she was serving.  She was one of the single most rude servers I have ever encountered. As I have said Out The Door has been my FAVORITE restaurant by far and has won me over with the folks who USE to work there.  This waitress was obviously unhappy and didn't give you know what about her service. At the end I was so upset and hurt that my niece had such a horrible experience.  I told the bartender upon leaving my utter dissatisfaction of the entire experience.  She on the other had was enjoying talking to the other servers and eating her dinner. He apologized but said the manager had left and that he really wasn't in a position to do anything but he would relay the experience.  I am certain she didn't care.  For the very first time I left a small tip and was even on the verge of not leaving one at all after paying $90 on such a terrible experience.  Now mind you if she had ever came back and checked in I would have had a couple more glasses of wine and dessert.... She didn't even deliver the check to us!!\n\nI hope that this message is heard and feedback is given.  At this point I do not plan to go back and would not recommend it to anyone which is sad. Part of dining out is the food but certainly the ambiance and service are just as important.", "author": "lawana s."}

Out the door is right up the street from our apartment and we frequent it a lot for brunch. We love Vietnamese food and the food here is very good. The spring rolls, lemongrass pork with rice, daikon cake and shredded chicken salad are our favorite dishes. My husband is Vietnamese and he also agrees that the food is good and authentic.\n\nHowever, every single time we come the service is very, very poor. We never once have been greeted at the door and it takes 10-15 minutes for anyone to come to the front of the restaurant. The food comes out at different times and the all around vibe of the restaurant is disorganized and slow. It feels that they could make a few changes to how they operate to make this a much better experience. I'm always shocked that a Charles Phan restaurant would allow for such poor organization.\n\nHoping out the door reads these common complaints and does something to change and make the restaurant great.", "author": "Simone B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-06", "description": "It's a small restaurant, you might have walked by not knowing it was a restaurant. It also doesn't have a giant sign outside either making it even harder to find. It has a very modern feel to it. Nice ambiance and during dinner there's dim lighting. They have big glass windows so during the day sunlight can shine in. Their kitchen area is open and you can sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the food.\n\nOut the door is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant. It's more upscale and has an American twist to it. It's definitely pricier than your average vietnamese cuisine too. However, everything I've eaten here has had lots of flavor with good balance.\n\nThings I've tried:\n\nPapaya Salad- 3.5 stars. good appetizer, refreshing. wasn't too salty and sour. Papayas were fresh and crunchy. Not outstanding from your average papaya salad.\n\nDaikon Rice Cakes- 3 stars. pretty good, tasty, your average daikon rice cakes you can get from a dim sum place. Overpriced though for what it is.\n\nSpring Rolls- 3 stars, average vietnamese spring rolls. overpriced again.\n\nNow Why I'm giving them 4 stars- the chicken porridge. it had great flavor very rich and the porridge wasn't super thick almost soup like. It seemed like they made it using broken rice. It's a small portion however :(. It goes great with the fried chinese donuts too. EVERYONE SHOULD AT LEAST TRY THIS ONCE!\n\nDungeoness Crab Cellophane noodles- 4 stars. very tasty and decent sized pieces of crab, but small portion for the size you pay\n\nShaking Beef- 4 stars. Very flavorful dish as well. Beef was tender and juicy with a crisp exterior.\n\nSlow Cooked Eggs- 4 stars. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Came with a good amount of beef.\n\nThey also have a unique tea selection to choose from.\n\nService has always been great.\n\nEvery time I've been there has been no wait or line out the door.\n\nTheir food is tasty. I would stick to dishes you can't order from a typical vietnamese restaurant (fresh spring rolls, daikon cake, imperial rolls, vietnamese crepe, rice rolls) because they're pretty pricey and you can get the same thing for less elsewhere. And also, for the price, you don't get that big of portions either.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

They serve trendier, almost fusion-like Vietnamese food that is decent, but leaves you wanting more. Their brunch menu has more traditional rice plates as well as more typical brunch items with an Asian flair. I had the chicken porridge, which had great flavor and a nice crispy element with the fried shallots on top. It was a good-sized bowl of homey comfort food, and ended up being my favorite dish. My boyfriend had the five spice chicken plate, which came with a pretty generous portion of grilled chicken. The flavors of the marinade melded well with the charcoal flavor of the grill and I liked the addition of the pickled veggies, but the plate as a whole was nothing special.

Of course they didn't tell me that this was their policy until after I spent the time an energy to have FedEx come pick up the card to overnight it back to me.  The management was rigid and unreasonable and unfriendly  in meeting me half way.  I offered to fax my ID to FaceTime or anything to show it is my card.  Their policy is their policy.

Then again, I have not been back to SF in years.  Shame on me on all counts.\n\nSo two college buddies, a great friend from my camp counselor days and I decided to go to Out The Door for a more casual Sunday lunch.  Great idea... except this was a holiday weekend and they were doing a special brunch instead of the regular menu... or maybe they do that every Sunday.  \n\nYes, I was disappointed, as there were many dishes I wanted to try... but sometimes you just go with it.  We went with it.  Oh boy, did we.  The four of us can eat a lot of food... and we did.  \n\nWe started with the Crispy Imperial Roll, fried and a bit heavy, but of course delicious.  Wrapping them in lettuce gave me the false impression I was being healthy.  The Spring Rolls were light and tasty and so much better than I make myself at home.  Duh.  But they have inspired me to go a step... or two further.  Speaking of which, Charles Phan's cookbook looks amazing.\n\nThe Green Papaya Salad and The Shredded Chicken Salad were both so delicious and heavenly... Yes, I just used the word heavenly to describe the salads.  The layers of flavors and textures were so interesting and worked perfectly.  I could eat either one of these on a daily basis!\n\nThe Soft Scrambled Eggs With Grilled Atlantic Salmon, Beets, Potatoes and Arugula Salad in a Mustard Vinaigrette was really good, but my least favorite of the entrees.\n\nThe Slow Cooked Eggs With Slow Smoked Coffee Rubbed Brisket was insanely delicious.  Heavy and filling, but Mmm!\n\nA Sausage dish I do not see on the menu was sent out to us... so tasty...\n\nAnd my hot Vietnamese Coffee added another kick that my under-slept body needed.\n\nBut my highlight, aside from the salads, was the Lemongrass Pork Over Rice with a Fried Egg, Pickled Veggies and Spicy Soy Sauce.  It has inspired me to try to do something like it with the lemongrass I am growing in a pot in my backyard.  \n\nOur server was fantastic... and her recommendations were right on.  My hot Vietnamese Coffee added another kick that my under slept body needed.\n\nEverything was perfect... and this is a good lesson to learn... be open to what is around you.  We went in wanting lunch from the regular menu but got some killer food I would not have ordered or expected.  \n\nSo will I be back?  Hell yes!  For breakfast, lunch, brunch or dinner!

I know little to nothing about what to expect from Vietnamese food, perhaps because there isn't much to be in found in Tucson, Arizona. But I do know that I thoroughly enjoyed my entire meal here, whether it's \"authentic\" or not, it was damn delicious. The space is quite small, so definitely make a reservation! I love an open kitchen and this place has one but it's not intrusive which makes the small space work. We sat at the community table and had a blast. Their local wine on tap and beer.I believe that's about it (no liquor!). We enjoyed cava and white wine with our feast which included spring rolls, pan seared scallops, crab noodles, wok Louisiana prawn and the lacinto kale. We got to sample bites from other items ordered by our group- the imperial crispy rolls, fried chicken and sea bass crudo. Seriously, I everything was fricken delish. The prawns were probably my least favorite, but they were still flavorful. The scallops for divine and I'd for sure order those again and for sure  on my next visit I'm getting my own order of crispy imperial rolls. Four stars for the service. They literally forgot the dinner order for one of our guests and didn't notice or let us know that the dish was sold out until the rest of our table got their entrees. They didn't do much to make up for it. Luckily, the rest of us ordered way too much food, so we had plenty to share while our other guest waited. I'd definitely return on another visit to SF.", "author": "Isabella J."}

After many great meals at the Slanted Door, my man and I were psyched to try OTD, so close to home. We made reservations, got all gussied up, and were ready for a great date night. I even said, \"This could become our new go-to neighborhood kinda-fancy place!\"\n\nWomp womp.\n\nInterestingly, the two things that bothered me most about our experience are things that I hardly ever complain about at restaurants -- service and noise level. Whenever people complain about service I'm like, oh boo hoo, your waiter didn't compliment your earrings. He brought your food and cleaned up after you. Deal with it. And with noise, it's like, stop whining. You're at a restaurant, not in your living room. It's going to be a little loud. But OTD helped me reach a whole new level of understanding.\n\nOf note, the service problem appeared to be based in the kitchen, not with our waitress, who was friendly and competent. But we didn't get our appetizer for about 30 minutes after being seated, and we didn't get our entrees until abut 55 minutes after being seated. Un. Acceptable. Furthermore, this didn't seem to be an issue to any of the staff, including our waitress, who never apologized for the delay or even acknowledged it. So maybe that wait time is standard here? Not okay with me, though.\n\nI love the decor and industrial look of the space, but seriously, it was SO LOUD it was distracting. And unattractive. We were literally SHOUTING at each other. And so was everyone else in the restaurant. Every time my boyfriend said something I had to scream, \"Eh? What?\", like a damn hard-of-hearing grandma. Not a good look for date night. Some sound-dampening tiles would go a long way in this concrete box.\n\nOh, and the food? It was fine. Soup dumplings, asparagus, lamb. The wine on tap is fun. But overall, nothing special, didn't really feel worth the price, and not nearly as epic as the meals we've had at Slanted Door. And due to the aforementioned issues, we passed on dessert and hit up the frozen yogurt place on Fillmore instead just for some instant gratification and peace and quiet. Sad.\n\nAnyway, I might go back again with a larger group, get more dishes to try, drink more wine so I could get boisterous, and expect to have to scream at each other to be heard. But we definitely won't be back for date night. Disappointing.", "author": "Megan D."}

I was one of the first diners at the little place on Valencia and have been a committed diner to this week. I eat lunch at OTD at least once a week and order out at least twice a week.

I have tolerated most of this and have kept coming in...\nTwo weeks ago I came in and ate dinner.

On one trip, we had reservations and had to wait, but got to enjoy a drink at the bar.  The other time we walked in off the street and were seated right away.  The reservation night was a Friday night, and I think the walk-in was during a weeknight.  Makes sense.  Anyway, we sat at the same table in both occasions, and in both instances felt like we were a little too close to the table next to us.  I like my space, especially when I'm on a date.\n\nOnto the food!  For appetizers, we have had the following:\n- Spring rolls, shrimp, pork shoulder, mint, spicy peanut sauce\n- Hue dumplings, mung bean, scallion oil, spicy soy\n\nTo be honest, the dumplings were less than memorable, but Greg absolutely LOVES the spring rolls.  I have to admit, they are incredibly delicious, especially since the peanut sauce they serve it with is warm.\n\nMains:\n- Shaking beef, grass-fed estancia ranch cubed filet mignon, watercress, red onions, lime sauce (obviously)\n- Mary's organic chicken claypot, caramel sauce, ginger, chilies\n- Prather ranch rotisserie pork loin, five spice, spring onions, crispy fingerling potatoes\n\nSides:\n- Jasmine rice\n- Hodo soy beanery yuba, kabocha squash, black trumpet mushrooms, glass noodles\n\nThe shaking beef and claypot chicken are the usual favorites, especially if you've been to The Slanted Door.  Is the Shaking Beef dish overpriced at $36?  Probably.  Would I order it again when I end up back at Out the Door? Probably.  Between that and the claypot chicken, they are solid choices to share.  On both occasions we shared a bottle of wine to go with dinner, so we're usually pretty stuffed by the time dinner is over.  Service wise, there isn't anything out of the ordinary that we got at OTD, but sometimes no recollection is better than a memorable bad experience.  It isn't a place we frequent very often, but when we have dropped in, it's been consistently delicious.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Soon are awesome host (who was kind enough to not only put us up, but gave up their bed for us) laid out some options on where to grab some breakfast nearby. One option grabbed our interest when Breakfast and Vietnamese was mentioned in the same sentence. \nOut The Door it was then, as our host mentioned \" You can get scrabbled eggs and bacon anytime at home.\" \n\nAfter a short walk we entered a door with the initials in small letters that read OTD, I would have never found this place on my own. \nInside was very modern and slick. We sat up at the bar to watch the magic happen. \n\nWe decided to share some of the appetizers to start off. We tried the Beignets, Steamed Pork Buns, and the best (and first for me) home made Cherrie Pop-tart I have ever had. Each selection was amazing on its own. \nWife and I both ordered the Chicken Pho which was damn tasty, but when I tried our friend's Chicken Porridge I instantly wished I had that instead. \nA very good and different breakfast that for sure scrubbed away that shameful hangover pretty quick. \nNext time in this city I really hope we end up back here for round 2!", "author": "Noel J."}

The last time I was in to pick something up, I was discriminated against and asked that my dog not be near the `other guests'.  This is not only illegal but it's downright insensitive and alienating.  My dog goes where I go and this is only the second restaurant in the entire city that has taken issue with him.  The Globe being the other.  The bartender started with the cold shoulder, somehow silently signaled the manager without making any eye contact or making an effort to greet me and then she came over and it was all over.  I explained to her that it was the restaurants responsibility to be aware of the laws and train her staff on them since clearly she was not and had not.\n\nI am positive that since I am in the minority that this won't effect their business much unless people think twice about giving their money to a restaurant that discriminates and humiliates people with disabilities.

We were all at least 10-15 minutes late and they held our table, no questions asked. Our server was prompt and friendly.\n- Must-haves: chicken claypot, porkchops, dungeness crab noodles.\n\nOVERALL CONS:\n- Way way way overpriced, and you get really small servings.\n- Do not order: pork meatballs, warm chocolate cake \n\nOnto the dishes...\n\n* Crispy imperial rolls, shrimp, pork, mint, peanuts, red leaf lettuce - The rolls had a great crisp. The sauce was a little weak and light, and too sour - more options would've been nice. I honestly would've enjoyed the rolls by themselves; the lettuce and noodles weren't really necessary.\n\n* Grilled pork meatballs, red leaf lettuce, vermicelli, pickled daikon, pineapple-anchovy sauce - I found the pork rubbery and oily, the sauce too tangy and sour. Our server had even specifically recommended this dish, but it wasn't worth it. Plus the veggie sides didn't really go with the pork. Overall when you made a lettuce wrap all the ingredients just didn't go well together.\n\n* Dungeness crab, cellophane noodles, green onion, sesame oil - Although the cellophane noodles (vermicelli) were a little overcooked (way too soft, broke apart too easily), I loved the flavor of this dish and found myself getting seconds and thirds. The crab meat was sparse but great and the dish was light, not too oily\n\n* Seared day boat scallops, saut\u00e9ed spinach, crispy shallots, spicy pineapple coconut sauce - The scallops were done well, slightly rare on the inside and more seared on the outside. The spinach went really well, but I was disappointed by the sauce which was way more heavy on the pineapple (and more sour than sweet). Also there was something like only six scallops for a ridiculous price (over $20).\n\n* Mary's organic chicken claypot, caramel sauce, chilies, fresh ginger  - Delicious! The sauce was strong & flavorful (probably mostly soy sauce, but hey can't go wrong with that). The meat was tender yet firm. And the dish came out steaming. I found myself spooning the extra sauce onto my rice just so I could have more of it. Only problem was there was SO LITTLE meat!!\n\n* Grilled niman ranch country pork chop, crispy fingerling potatoes, spicy soy - These pork chops were absolutely delicious. Spiced just right. Seared on the outside and soft and tender meat on the inside. And the crispy fingerling potato halves - a perfect complement!\n\n* Thai basil ice cream with orange pizelle - The basil flavor was really unique & we enjoyed that a lot. The pizelle was a great touch, added a bit of sweetness & crunch. However the texture of the ice cream was much more like a sorbet & way too light, not creamy enough.\n\n* Warm chocolate cake with candied peanuts - Very disappointing, I'm sure the worst warm chocolate cake I've ever ordered at a restaurant. It was dry - but they try to trick you into thinking it's moist by drizzling the whole thing with what's probably a cheap Hersheys chocolate syrup. Not exactly warm, & no hard outer shell to crack into!!\n\nWe were recommended the Papaya Salad and I regret not getting it. It looked amazing and unlike any papaya salad I've ever had. Also we were going to get the pho but changed our minds when our neighbors all got it - didn't look that appealing, and the noodles didn't look like the best quality.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

While I don't mind hole in the wall places, these days I prefer the blend of a good space, decor, service, and food. OTD manages to captivate me with the simple, modern decor, impeccable service, flavorful food, and open clean space. \n\nOnce again, three seating options. A communal table, individual tables, or counter seating (by the kitchen or by the bar). The perk of sitting by the bar is the free wine samplings. OTD offers a wide selection of wine and beer so you have the opportunity to experiment while waiting for your food to arrive. \n\nFor brunch, I had the chicken porridge as it is #56 on 7X7's The Big Eat 2011-100 Things to Try  Before You Die. Nice rich consistency and not watery like certain porridge. The chicken tasted fresh and good. I would love to have this on a foggy SF day as it warms the soul so this may be my next winter cooking project.\n\nFor dinner, we shared the jicama salad, shrimp in clay pot, and jasmine rice. The shrimp was slightly spicy and the best part was the shrimp head, an excellent source of protein. I recommend the jicama salad as it is light and a perfect appetizer.", "author": "Sophie C."}

This might be trendy, but it makes for terrible acoustics. Even half-full, the place was roaring. We tried to go on another occasion when it was busy, and we again walked Out the Door, because it was unbearably loud.\n\nOrdered the snow peas, and the lamb stir fry. Asked for low sodium. Peas were small portions for the price, overseasoned but edible, lamb was tough and overcooked. Sent the lamb back and asked for the chicken claypot. I can honestly say, it's the saltiest thing I've ever tried to eat. I started to feel sick after only a few bites. \n\nPrices are high, and I was pretty unhappy at this point.

Maybe because it's so much more prevalent there, or I just go crazy as soon as I'm transplanted back into an urban setting...\n\nIt was heartbreaking when the Westfield location closed down...yes, it was inside a mall...yes it was located adjacent to the Food Court...yes it's soooo touristy....BUT WE DIDN'T CARE!!! It was totally convenient for us, (The Ferry Terminal is cool, but sometimes, you don't want to trek all the way to The Slanted Door near the whipping winds and cold damp waterfront...) the environment is always casual and easy going...and you can go to Bearded Papas out in the Food Court for a Cream Puff afterwards!!!! It's the simple things that are the bestl!!!\n\nBut enough griping, until they finish the higher end restaurant on the upper floor, we don't have much choice, but since we had never been to the location on Bush Street, we decided that we would venture out of our tourist bubble...(hovel...whatever...)\n\nLocated in Pacific Heights, Out The Door is the third venue of the OTD brands and is a tribute the original Slanted Door on Valencia Street.  The nearest intersection is Fillmore, a chic, trendy street that houses some of the on-point boutique stores in the city, on a hill no less....\n\nThe building and architectural interior is modern minimalism, a clear departure from your classic, slightly patronizing, Asian-esque interiors that's been bastardized and conceived in every iteration-to the point of comical.  Most of Charles Phan's restaurant departs from this tired approach, focussing on the essence of design with simple clean line and little adornment...I will say tho, the bent sheet metal banquette is a little cold....\n\nMenu Roundup:\n\nDrinks:           Blenheim Ginger Ale\n                        Lychee Infused Iced Tea\nAppetizers:   Crispy Imperial Rolls\n                        Lotus Sticky Rice\nMains:            Mary's Organic Claypot Chicken\n                        Banh Mi\n\nIt's always a tradition that we order the Blenheim Ginger Ale at Out The Door - the biting sharpness of ginger effervescence provides the liquid balance to the heavy, addictive, flavor saturated dishes we love!\n\nCrispy Imperial Rolls (Cha Gio) with Rice Vermicelli Noodles, Mint and Peanuts\nIt's always good to start off a Southeast Asian meal with some rolls...and to treat ourselves, we got the fried version: Crispy Imperial Rolls with Shrimp and Pork! It's a ceremonial process, you take the Lettuce Leaf, place some Vermicelli Noodles and the roll on top wrap it up and dip it into the Fish Sauce and let the flavors fill your mouth with abundance...The fresh leafy vegetable crunch contrasts with crunch of the fried roll beautifully, along with the savory Pork and Shrimp with the tangy Fish Sauce, it's a scrumptious appetizer that will please any appetite.\n\nAs we had just posted out review for Kirin Restaurant last week, the Dim Sum was still fresh in our minds, so when we saw it on the menu, it had to be ordered.  Definitely distinct, the Sticky Rice soaks up the fragrance of the Lotus leaf, and with an all vegetable cast, it had a lightness to it that you normally don't get, and then with the Crispy Shallots and scallions on top, it added a Southeast Asian flair.\n\nWhat I really adored about this Out The Door location is the proximity and view to the open kitchen; it's a portal into the creative collaboration of divine ingredients transformed by way of heat, caramelization and the knife...\n\nAnd watching the Claypot arrive onto the counter from the oven, lid on, with steam spewing from the tiny hole screaming to be let out of its confinement just adds to the dramatic entrance as it makes its way to the table, it's contents revealed, fragrance and all.\n\nThis chicken dish is a rice lover's must have:  Baked Chicken in a Claypot Casserole with Minced Thai Chiles, Ginger in a Caramel Sauce, just a touch salty so as to require a mouthful of rice to compensate and sate the palate.  It's a slow moving catch-22, eat some chicken, need some rice, need more chicken, need more rice to eat more chicken...and so on and so on..it's a culinary Sisyphus...but without the labor...and the hell...(maybe not the best analogy).. Anyways, it's a delicious dish, despite my last description...\n\nAnother dish that is one of my favorites: the Banh Mi.  A culinary evolution between French and Vietnamese.  Lemongrass marinated Pork with Pate with all the Southeast Vegetable & Herbs, Shallot Mayonnaise and Soy...It's light, it's savory, it's so good!!!!\n\nNow that we've eaten here, I can't imagine coming to SF without having my first meal off the plane at Out The Door on Bush Street.

The interior is very modern, L.A.-like, which given that I'm from L.A., felt very welcoming. A lot of the restaurants here in S.F. seem to be more the homey, hole-in-the wall like but this restaurant is not the case. \n\nThough they got the decor, ambiance, and service right (I think), the food is what brings down the rating for me. My friends and I got the pork over rice, the sticky rice over sweet potatos and coconut milk, the imperial rolls (basically the fried spring rolls/appetizer), the chicken clay pot, and the glass noodle with crab meat... (can't remember the exact names of the dishes). I have to say the sticky rice over sweet potatoes and the clay pot was great. The pork over rice with the over easy egg was also very good (albeit very greasy and a bit too cancer-inducing burnt/crunchy). The glass noodle dish was really disappointing. \n\nThe portions were very small for the price. The chicken clay pot is probably the best dish out of the ones we ordered, but when the server opened the clay pot it looked as though it was half empty, not sure why the portions are so little. \n\nAnyhoo, I'd go here again with friends if they insist... it's just - be warned - some of the food here is a hit or miss. Oh, and pricey. You're definitely paying a premium for the ambiance.", "author": "Elizabeth P."}

In terms of flavor alone, this meat might be my favorite among other shops. Only comes with carrots, a thin slice of cucumber, and cilantro. Pate works well with the flavors. Sparse on meat though, only one layer loosely folded over itself.  Bread was the biggest letdown, not crunchy at all. The exterior was not soft but more like a shell that lost it's crispness, possibly due to sitting in a box for a bit. Toasting it in a toaster oven regained the crisp but it was drier overall of course.

I would suggest sticking closer to the Vietnamese side of things here as that is the roots of this place.

We've been to the old OTD in Westfield and really like the shrimp and pork spring roll and we ordered that here as well.  That is probably the best dish.  We also ordered the calamari which was good, stir fried lamb which was average, cellophane noodles with crab (nothing special) and fried chicken which was very average as well.  I feel the food is a bit over priced given the quantity and the amount we paid.  I think I would just stick with the spring roll if I were to come back.

I've ordered pho here a couple of times and it was great, delicious, made with quality ingredients. However, it comes in a small bowl and inside of 2.5 hours, I'm hungry after eating it.

Being a fan of the Slanted Door, I figured that I'd give it a shot.  \n\nThe first pleasant departure from the \"Slanted Door experience\" was the fact that we could just walk in and get a table.  Try and pull that move at the Ferry Building--not gonna happen, unless maybe there was a kitchen fire or a bomb scare.  Upon cozying up to the uber-clean bar for snack service, I chose some belly warming chicken porridge.  I could hear the angels singing in the background, approving my choice.  I love congee or jook and this did not disappoint.  It hit the spot and the gorgeous sauteed shallots were perfect with the broth and chicken.  Nice work again Mr. Phan.  The menu was simple with lots of comfort food choices--right up my alley.\n\nAmazingly enough, the staff was nice and even warmed up a bit after taking my order.

I HAVE TO SAY, I felt a bit out of place as the only Asian in a Vietnamese (should be called Asian Fusion restaurant)...HMMMM..\n\nThe place has a trendy, modern vibe which is all the craze right now with new restaurants, but I don't see that as much of a reason to mark up the prices on their rather simple foods.\n\n(MEH!) Chicken Porridge with Chinese Donuts [$9.00]: Olivia and I had them split a single order into separate bowls for us and it was pretty filling. It was good, but for $9!? Honestly, I could find that on Irving (not even going to bother comparing it with Chinatown) for half the price with the quality still intact.\n\n(MEH!) Five Spice Chicken Vermicelli *comes w/ imperial rolls* [$14.00]: Looked impressive, but that was not the five spice chicken I had in mind! (I tend to compare stuff like this to the normal Vietnamese restaurants I frequent like PPQ, Loi's, and Kevin's) The chicken was a bit bland by itself so I dumped all my fish sauce all over since it was in dire need of it.\n\nIf you have money to spare and really enjoy the Americanized ambiance with your food, by all means ignore my review.

I ordered a fried egg and good thing that came with her food but my porridge no where to be seen.  I have experience working in a restaurant and I do understand things get backed up. However, I never received any type of acknowledgement for the fact my food was so much later to the table until I asked about it. The porridge was luke warm and I did get a new egg.

The pho and payaya salad were good. My two favorites were the steamed buns and the beignets! The beignets were different from the beignets I've had at Cafe Du Monde but they were different and unique in a very buttery and tasty way. \nService was very slow. Our waitress didn't bother to refill our drinks or even check up on us.

The food was pretty good-- or at least started out that way. However my friend had the shaking beef and was not a fan, neither was I. For 36$ it should be a melt in your mouth fillet, but instead had a lot of fat and was overcooked on the outside-- chewy almost.\n\nThe biggest problem here was our waitress, 'Whithney' she completely forgot 2 dishes our group ordered. When we brought this to her attention she quietly said sorry and asked what they were. Her reaction was almost vacant -- like we were the furthest thing from her minds. And she continued to set the dessert menus on our table. No offer to bring the dishes or a dessert or for anything complimentary. Pretty much no remorse. Bizarre to say the least. Especially when this place is just way too expensive for what it is. Yes it's sleek, yes it's pac heights, but our bill came to $120 for 3 people and we BARELY got anything in my opinion -- but really shitty service.\n\nI may come back at one point, I may not.... I'd frankly rather go to SPQR, Delfina, Jackson Fillmore Trattoria, or any number of great restaurants in this neighborhood where I feel the value of what I am paying for and that the service level matches it.\n\nThis place says is called 'Out The Door' but is really just another 'Slanted Door' without the impeccable service level.", "author": "Sara H."}

It's a cool, rather unusual feel. \n\nMy date and I split two appetizers, a dessert, a bottle of wine, and each ordered an entree. The portions were small enough that we both came away at the perfect level of full. Beware that just an entree will not fill you up unless you are not at all hungry. Since the prices are pretty high this knocks off a star from what would otherwise get 5 stars in my book.\n\nWe ordered:\n+ Spring Rolls with Shrimp, Pork Shoulder, Mint, and a Peanut Sauce they claimed was spicy...it was not spicy by any means. These were good though certainly not anything spectacular. They were your basic spring rolls but with the addition of a small amount of pork shoulder. ($10)\n\n+ Ahi Tuna Tartare with Sesame Crackers. The tuna was cut into larger chunks than tuna tartare often is, which I really liked. It made it seem more fresh somehow. I would get this again for sure. ($14)\n\n+ Banana Leaf-Wrapped Petrole Sole with Mushrooms and a Cilantro sauce. This was SO GOOD. The portion was really small, but the fish was wonderfully moist and the hedgehog mushrooms underneath were fantastic. Mmm. ($24)\n\n+ Fried Chicken with Sriracha Butter on the side. My date ordered this on the waiter's recommendation. It was really good, though a funny dish to have at a Vietnamese restaurant, in my opinion. \n\n+ Vietnamese Coffee-Cocoa Tres Leches. Tasty, but not particularly special. ($8)\n\nIn addition to the bottle of wine, we also ordered a St Peter's Organic English Ale that was served in a wine glass. It was really good, though for $10, I would say that this 4.5% alcohol beer was overpriced.\n\nOverall, good impression.

OTD is a strange mix of chrome, marble, hard benches, and food served on Asian plates that my Gung-Gung and Po-Po used to have.  One server brought me water and asked if I was ready to order.  I wasn't.  She literally turned and took two steps when another person asked me if I was ready to order.  Um, hello, it's two o'clock in the afternoon and there is no shortage of tables.  What's the rush?  The crispy egg noodles w/ prawns, scallops, squid, carrots, broccoli, and shitake mushrooms sounded just right for my craving.

Starving, we Yelped the closest Vietnamese restaurant; Out The Door popped up. The airy decor is lovely and I adore the fact that you can sit at the counter to watch the chefs whip up your meal. That's about all the pros I can say.\n\nIt took upwards of 10 minutes to waive down our waiter after staring unblinkingly at him. Not even bothering to ask for our drink orders, he seemed already put out when I asked to place our food orders. He excused himself for a few minutes before coming back and finally writing it down.\n\nOur pho tai (beef) and pho ga (chicken) arrived about fifteen minutes later in much smaller bowls than I had ever seen pho served (especially at $10 per order). And the taste... I've never tasted pho like that. Bland yet over-salted; slices of meat that were speckled with an equal amount of fat; and lacking the rich complexity of a soup simmered overnight. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth but it deserves to be stripped it of its \"pho\" label. \n\nMore so, they do not have condiments at the table. They only gave one small dish containing Sriracha and Hoisin sauce and a spring of basil between my companion and I. The waiter never came back to check how things were so I had to waive at him to ask for more Sriracha as he walked by... but he kept walking. He may have been busy grabbing an order or dropping off a check but simple etiquette, especially to paying customers, is not that difficult -- in fact, it's your job.\n\nI noticed most customers during this Sunday afternoon did not have heavily Vietnamese dishes. I saw a slew of salads and eggs on the surrounding tables. Nary another bowl of pho in the place. Perhaps I should have drunk in the sight before I fed my appetite. \n\nIf you want Americanized overpriced brunch, Out The Door will hit the spot. But if you want a more authentic meal that is double the proportions at half the price, you should probably amble on over to the Tenderloin (may I suggest Ha Nam Ninh).

Upon sitting down, I immediately noticed the familiar kitchen setup to the likes of chinese fast food joints, with the woks and the long swiveling faucets.  The cook at the wok section just finished a dish of calamari, which was sent back after a taste by the head chef, I was somewhat impressed by the standards.\n\nThe waitress was very attentive and informed me that the Chicken Porridge is only available for lunch.  I should have checked with my fellow Yelpers before going.  Disappointed and yet hungry, I opted for the spare ribs starter and the claypot caramel chicken.  My expectation was Vietnamese fusion.  Unfortunately, the only thing that was fused together was the higher price and the not so authentic food.  \n\nThe ribs were tasty and tender but not very meaty, the taste of hoisin sauce was unevenly lathered on, covered with scallion sprinkles.  The claypot caramel organic chicken was underwhelming.  The sauce was thin and the taste was nothing special.  A good caramel chicken in claypot can easily be found in any good old vietnamese restaurant for 1/2 the price and double the size.  As a side, I had the corn with Japanese mushroom.  The mushroom provided a nice smokey flavor, and each kernel was knifed off of a cob, fresh?\n\nIn short, overpriced vietnamese food cooked in a chic decor.  The food is nothing special, and not very innovative.  However, I must go back to try the chicken porridge at lunch time to check it off the 7x7 list...........", "author": "Raymond W."}

What was a surprise to me was finding out that there are three different restaurants affiliated with it called \"Out the Door\", which are much smaller and apparently oriented towards take outs for the neighborhoods they're in.\n\nTo be honest, my experience here was just OK. While the decor and atmosphere were nice, the food wasn't anything life changing, and the service was average. Both our dishes were WAY over-salted, and frankly overpriced for the quality of the food. The spicy sliced lamb that I ordered was cooked just right (medium-rare), but it was hardly spicy - I cook with Chinese red peppers all the time, and it only takes a couple to make a dish rip-roarin' hot; this dish had easily three times as many red peppers (and jalapenos!) on it and I'd call it mild spicy at best (hint to the chef: if you want to make it spicy, crack the peppers open and let the seeds simmer in the oil for a couple moments before you mix in the food).\n\nThe wait staff was friendly and courteous, but slow and didn't really pay attention to us. I found myself waving down our waitress several times while she was talking with other staff about whatever, and she seemed oblivious to us. Their conversations looked work related, not idle chit-chat (thankfully), but seriously, at least every couple of minutes look up at your seats to see if people need something... we ended up getting other servers twice to get what we needed. It shouldn't have to be that way. However, kudos to our waitress for being friendly and letting me have a taster of a $12 glass of pinot before I ordered it - many places won't do that.\n\nOn the plus side, the location is good, especially for anyone that's going to be in and around the Fillmore and wants to stop in for a bite to eat. Don't take someone here on a big date, there are much better places to go for the money you'll fork out. But if you're looking for something to fill you up that's not bad, give it a try.

After a long day of work and class, my friend and I were both feeling under the weather and decided that a hot bowl of pho was exactly what we needed to feel better. Using my ever so handy Yelp app on my phone, I found a couple of vietnamese places in the hood and decided to check out OTD because of the mostly favorable reviews and close proximity to my apartment.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I am used to being persecuted because of my \"lifestyle\" -- even in 2010, so many restaurants are vegephobic. Still, the lack of effort from the OTD staff was alarming to me when I asked for what I thought was a simple request. Ideally, vegetarian pho would be made with vegetable broth, but I'm a realist and I eat at many hole-in-the-wall non-english-speaking vietnamese restaurants and I know that the majority of those places probably bring me pho prepared with beef or chicken stock -- and you know what, I'm ok with that. I'm all about compromise: you take out the meat, I'll deal with the beef broth.\n\nHOWEVER, unlike Fergie, OTD refused to meet me half way, which left me more than a little disgruntled. If your food is prepared fresh, there is no reason why it can't be prepared without meat, yet I was told that the staff \"didn't have time\" for my request. RUDE.\n\nSo I was subjected to trying to form a meal out of the various vegetable sides, none of which refreshed my struggling immune system like a hot bowl of pho would have. In addition, it was unnecessarily expensive and portioned so small that I shed a single tear, not unlike the tv commercials where the native american guy sees all the litter in the woods.", "author": "Wayne F."}

My deal with vietnamese style cuisine is that if I'm paying more than $6 bucks for a pho soup, I expect some kind of wow factor in the food, or the service and decor to be top notch.\n\nThe restaurant is very chic and modern looking, but casual enough that the family with children at the table next to us were not out of place. The food was standard but good. There were a lot of items on the menu that looked appetizing, but we stuck to soups (perhaps due to the rain outside).  I enjoyed my shrimp and pork wonton soup, and would recommend it.\n\nThe reason I probably won't come back to OTD was because of the service. Nobody came to greet us when we entered, so we started walking towards an empty table. That's when we were helped. We had several different waiters, and none of them were friendly or personable.  We had to stop someone to order an extra lemonade because the first waiter left before we finished ordering. Overall, the waitstaff seemed hungover, careless in their attitude, like we were bothering them, and too out of it to take their job seriously.\n\nThis place has potential, but I just don't see the appeal of paying a higher price for Vietnamese staples unless the atmosphere and vibe are going to be more than decent.", "author": "Roxane W."}

Each time we've politely asked for at least one selection that might please a less aggressive palette.  Each time we've been told \"the chef has chosen these wines to pair with the food and that is that.\"\n\nPersonally, unless \"chef\" is paying for the meal out of his own pocket, I get very tired of hearing \"what chef wants.\"\n\nSo last night we brought our own which was fine - until the bill showed up with a hefty $25 corkage fee. By way of reference, according to \"Corkage for Dummies\" (www.foodandwine.com/articles/corkage-for-dummies_\"...corkage fees seem lowest in San Francisco and Los Angeles... on average, $10 to $12\". \n\nI asked to see the manager who was entirely and immediately dismissive. I asked him if he viewed the surcharge as reasonable and the answer was \"that's our policy.\"  I pressed a bit saying \"don't you think this is a bit greedy?\"  Again, stone wall indifference.\n\nPerhaps that attitude is rooted in the arrogance of present popularity.  If so, as the novelty of the concept wears out, a bit of empathy and warmth might creep out to replace all that icy indifference.\n\nHere's the deal.

Got the Papaya salad to start, delicious.  In between our salad and entrees we waited for about 20 mins. Backed up due to call in orders and a few woks our server explained to us.  Comped our dessert which was nice of them for the long wait.  For our entrees we got the shaken beef, which was amazing and seared scallops which was okay, rubbery and not too much flavor. Was still a little hungry so we ordered another app, the calamari, which was grilled then supposed to be crisp. Ate a few, good flavoring but not crispy at all.  The GM , wish I got her name, then came around asking how everything was and she noticed the calamari, immediately said that's not how it supposed to be cooked. She then took it back and offered us a new calamari which was a lot better. I thank her for that attention to detail, made our experience a lot better. Our dessert we chose the cheese cake, which was very good, I'm not a sweet tooth kind of guy, so I didn't each much, but the few bites I had were very good! All in all trying to get dinner at a nice place on a Saturday without reservations after a Giants game is tough, so we really appreciated the accommodations. Will be back, maybe for lunch though, where demand is less.", "author": "Vance O."}

Cripsy imperial rolls were your traditional imperial rolls from a Vietnamese restaurant. Chicken porridge was bland and had a few thin strips of chicken. Grilled lemongrass pork was forgetful. \n\nTo top it all off, I waited 40 minutes for the take-out order. Was told it would take 15 mins. So I come back in 15 minutes after a quick trip to Walgreens around the corner. They tell me it would take another 5 minutes. Those extra 5 minutes actually take another 25 minutes. I sat around and saw 3 other take-out orders go out before mine.\n\nI am now a believer that there is no such thing as fancy Vietnamese food.

The Porridge came with a side of rau ram, fried shallots, black pepper and chinese donut.  Mix everything together in the porridge and it is PERFECT!  It's a bit pricy for porridge, but since it was on The List I had to order it.  My kids LOVED the chinese donut, we had to ask for more.  Normally chinese donut is very oily tasting, but this one was chewy and bready and had a perfect crisp to it.  The porridge was the perfect consistency and flavor and had a generous amount of chicken in it.\n\nWe also ordered the Vietnamese Crepe (Banh Xeo), Beef Pho and also Daikon Rice Cake.  The Banh Xeo was served with a side of lettuce, mint leaves and fish sauce.  The Banh Xeo was very crispy and had a generous amount of bean sprouts, pork and shrimp.  We were very surprised at how much we liked it.  Daikon Rice Cake tasted good too, thought that the spicy soy dressing that they serve it was going to be spicy BUT it didnt seem to bother my kids.  The Pho at this location taste like it does at Westfield Centre.  No complaint's, it's just perfect the way we like it.\n\nWill definitely come back, there are so many things on the menu that we want to try.", "author": "Tammy N."}

I paid for my food and waited for the staff to finish putting it together. I waited near the hostess stand to keep out of the way of the staff. After a while, I politely asked the hostess if my order was ready. The hostess' attitude was sh*t and she was not nice at all!!  She was definitely having a bad day...maybe because she was working on a holiday or maybe because she was upset about having to serve people in a restaurant. Who knows? She was crabby and full of attitude.  She is the hostess with the shaved part of her hair...please avoid her...boo!!! Anyway, when I asked her about my food she rolled her eyes with a sour look in her face and said, \"I don't know I'm not the one manning the to go orders.\"  Wow...what a gem! Good hire with this one OTD!! If you're going to serve food that is really tasty and delicious you should also have people that work in your restaurant that have skills in just being nice. Not too much to ask for...just be nice. I mean you're working in the customer service industry, isn't being nice kind of a pre-requisite? I left with a sour taste in my mouth from her bad attitude.

The soup was herbal, soothing, and had my father moaning. I ordered the green papaya salad. It was fresh, crisp, sweet. I loved the fried onions as an accent. \n\nThe crowd is a mix of hip working professionals and families. Since it is smaller than its mother restaurant, I suggest keeping the parties to a maximum of four. A great spot for catching up with a friend or a casual date.

My least favorite was the papaya salad, which was a bit bland (I'm used to the spicier Thai green papaya salad). The summer rolls were great, especially since they added shitake mushrooms. \nI ordered the vegetarian banh -mi, which may be the most unique and delicious version of the sandwich I've ever had. It comes on a homemade french roll, with asparagus, avocado, shitake mushrooms, pickled daikon & carrots, and a perfectly light mayonnaise based spread. For ~$12(I think) it's definitely the most expensive banh-mi sandwich I've had, but totally worth it!\nMy friend got the shrimp vermicelli, and I only had a bite but the shrimp were spiced and cooked perfectly.\nThe service was friendly and fast.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-02", "description": "Attempting to fancify Vietnamese food is sort of a crime against nature in my opinion.  Vietnamese should be eaten in a dingy, cramped hole in the wall perhaps with chopsticks that look suspiciously like they haven't been washed in a while.  That's where the good stuff is.  So it just felt a bit odd eating Vietnamese in a clean, chic restaurant that takes reservations.  I would have been okay with it had the food blown my mind.  Or even been pretty decent.  But it just wasn't all that great.  Probably the best thing I had was the crispy imperial rolls.  But what the hell were you supposed to do with the lettuce and noodles on the side . . . I guess wrap the already wrapped rolls with the lettuce and noodles?  It was a bit puzzling.  The chicken porridge was sort of a bore, but let's face it, it's porridge and is pretty much boring by definition.\n\nWhat really upset me was their Vietnamese coffee.  Usually Vietnamese coffee packs a punch, and one delicious sip will send you into a tizzy of caffeine induced mania.  Whatever they gave me was like watered down Starbucks with cream.  As a person with a passion for Vietnamese coffee, this utter desecration of it was pretty devastating.\n\nThe service was attentive enough, but our server had the emotion level of a cyborg.

There are about 10 other things I want to try so I will wait until I try some of those and will then update my review (though I find it hard to believe that those things won't be delicious, too). \n\nWhere to start? Okay, we'll start with being seated at the kitchen counter since there weren't any more tables available when we came in. What luck! Now I can't imagine sitting any other place - can actually have a better conversation with the person you're with because you're closer to them. Also watching the food being cooked is like eye candy. Also, extremely ideal if you're sharing all of the dishes. \n\nNow we'll touch on the service. Keep in mind it was a busy Sunday morning. I was starving when we first came in yet we didn't know exactly what we wanted yet. We started with the steamed rice cakes with pork and shrimp and some o.j. while we looked at the rest of the menu. Then when she came back, we only had figured out one more thing that we wanted and put in an order for that...while still looking at the menu. She came back a bit later and we could finally place our final order. She could not have been more sweet and patient with us. \n\nNow to the food. \n\nThe steamed rice cakes with pork and shrimp were great and unique. The imperial roll (which my boyfriend insisted upon) made me a fan of imperial rolls! Keep in mind, he knows I'm not a huge fan of fried food and he told the waitress I wasn't going to want them - so she suggested that he get a half-order. This ended up being a problem since I ended up being a fan (what's not to love about making a roll out of lettuce, mint, vermicelli noodles and a fried roll with all sorts of goodness in it and dipping it into a sweet and salty sauce???). We also got the soft scrambled eggs with crab and the baguette. Eggs were cooked perfectly. Baguette was the perfect texture. \n\nWe were both contently full from this meal...though we wanted to try about 4 other things (the egg scramble with rice cake, the vermicelli bowl, the pate...to name a few).

It's nothing like the other OTD's (not that the other ones are bad). They have a completely different menu and serve all day. They do breakfast lunch and dinner but my favorite is weekend brunch. It's nice to find a place that serves a non American \"comfort food\" brunch. The staff is super friendly and the food is extremely consistent. I will never get sick of their Pho (best broth I've had to date in this city).\n\nThis is a great example of how to highlight the amazing ingredients we have access to in the bay area. Add in the service and the execution and they have a recipe for success!\n\nI haven't read the other reviews on this place but I did notice they're not great. I do find it funny that some of my favorite places have the worst reviews on Yelp, i.e. Flour and Water and Nopalito to name a few...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-26", "description": "Overall, I'm a big fan of OTD.  The service is impeccable, the large space serene and quiet even when crowded (a trick I wish other restaurants in SF would heed and apply), the ingredients fresh, tasty, and beautifully plated.  A big plus is that it's in the neighborhood, there's a community table and OTD welcomes the single diner, and the vibe is low key friendly.  \n\nI learn something new about Vietnamese food each time I'm there.  The entire staff is well-educated about the food and it's fun to talk with them about it.  It's not in that too precious \"flaunting, let me educate you\" manner  but in the way someone who knows their ingredients and likes to talk about food way--very natural and just enough.\n\nMy only problem with OTD is the cost.  I generally realize I'm hungry about 9 PM, too late for a Mollie's salad, way too late for Delfina's pizza or meatballs, and so I head to OTD.  I must say it's not a tragic choice, just pricey for an Imperial roll and papaya salad; no wine or beer.  It's about $23.00 with tip and tax.  I had cellophane noodles with crab (very, very little crab), an Imperial roll, and tea once.  It was over $35.00.  \n\nTwo people could easily run a tab over $100.00 with a couple of rolls, a beer and a glass of wine, splitting a salad, a noodle dish and a clay pot, and splitting a dessert.  Other Out the Door's seem less costly.  They, however, don't have the lovely milieu.  I walk in and the cares of the day fall away.  Some evenings that is more than worth the extra money even without the glass of wine.\n\nFor those who use walkers or wheelchairs.  I use a walker sometimes and have gone in OTD with it.  The staff was great.  I was given my choice of seats and not herded to the back of the room.  My treatment was matter-of-fact, polite, and \"no big deal.\"  It was so refreshing not to feel as though a spotlight was turned on me (I go back when using my cane in appreciation).  The wait staff asked if I wanted my walker moved out of the way while I ate.  I said yes.  It was moved to where I could see it but no one would trip over it.  I was asked when I would like it returned to me.  It was returned with no fuss or big production.  THANK YOU OTD!!!", "author": "Julia C."}

But the other reviews about the bland, too oily food are, quite frankly, correct.  \n\nI went for lunch today because I was walking up Bush and happened to see a new restaurant.  I crossed the street and became immediately excited that it was Out the Door!  The no-personality hostess had to ask the waiter if it was okay if I (being just me, no one else with me) sat at a table alone, rather than the counter.  Honestly, I'm short, and I don't sit on bar stools if I can help it - my feet never reach the rungs.   \n\nI ordered the 5 spice chicken with vermicelli, because that's what I always order - anywhere they have it.  I would eat vermicelli for every damn meal if I could.  After I ordered, the woman sitting next to me got hers, and immediately asked for extra fish sauce.  The waiter tried to tell her that they put the sauce on, and it seeps to the bottom.  I thought  \"oh, that's probably true - she's gonna be sorry when she has too much fish sauce.\"  Then I got mine.  And guess what....almost NO sauce.  Just oil.  Lot's and lots of oil.  My skin is very silky smooth right now, and my tongue is still coated with oil  2 hours later.  No biggie.  I ordered extra sauce.  Applied the sauce.  STILL bland.  WHAT?  So I asked for some hoisin sauce - whatever, I always put that on at the end anyway to switch up the flavor a little.  I proceed to eat, but the chicken is flavorless.  The imperial rolls were tasty (it's difficult to screw up fried foods).  Then toward the end I use my chopsticks (thankfully),  to break open the last, and largest, piece of chicken.  Raw.  ???? Seriously????  I better check again.    Oh yeah.  Raw.  The waiter promptly took it away, and the manager came over.  I wasn't all that upset, but it was nice of him to come over - he was GREAT. \"Obviously, it's on the house\", and can he get me anything else?  Hmmmmm....tell me about the coconut bun.  YES, he says!  It's wonderful, I'll get that for you.  And ohhhhhhhhh YES - it is wonderful.  \n\nSo, free coconut bun, and the vermicelli was comped.  I'll go back again, and be specific about no oil on my noodles to see how that goes.  But be forewarned OTD - I'm only coming again once.

Thought that was a nice touch. I tried the lychee infused ice tea ($3.50) - deliciously fragrant.\n\nFor dinner we shared the Green Papaya Salad ($8), which was fine and tasted like other papaya salads I've had, and the Prawns in garlic and shallots ($18), which had great flavor, plump shrimp, but overall portion size was small. Side of white rice ($2) additional.\n\nWe were filling a need for a different flavor and ordered the Vegetarian Spring Rolls ($8). These were surprisingly good. I say surprising because I typically avoid the vegetarian stuff, preferring the shrimp and pork variety. But this had really good flavor and texture from the wood ear mushrooms (one of the few varieties I like), mint, and veggies. It just tasted super fresh.\n\nSo now I understand why some people like OTD.  It offers an upscale dining experience and vibe, with solid good food. The upcharge comes from saving you the trek to the Tenderloin for better and cheaper food. It's all about trade offs, right?", "author": "Cindy W."}

As good as the food was, I was unable to carry on a conversation with my dining companion with shouting and competing with boisterous patrons all over the restaurant.  I mentioned it to the server and she said that she is starting to loose her hearing due to the noise level.  This can be remedied:  There are nothing but hard surfaces throughout the restaurant, nothing to absorb noise anywhere.  I think that this can be improved upon without insulting the interior designer, who put little thought into acoustics.   One must consider all the senses when dining.  I had a headache by the time I left and spoke to manager who agreed that something has to be done.  Why take someone to dinner if you can't talk to them or have to strain your voice through the meal? Pretty much defeats the purpose of dining out.  Manager was nice enough to comp the appetizer for the bad experience.", "author": "blaine s."}

It was rainy and cold, and I couldn't imagine any meal being anywhere near as satisfying. I was meeting a friend at her apartment in Lower Pac Heights, and Out the Door was the closest Pho we could find. Since moving to San Francisco and into the Marina, I haven't really had any good Pho and I was having MAJOR withdrawals! \n\nThe restaurant was very nice and clean looking, and we were seated right away. Our server wasn't super friendly by any means, but she answered my questions and got the job done, so I won't complain. Maybe she was having an off day. Anyway, I started with a chicken steamed bun. I had never had one before because they are always filled with pork and I don't eat pork, so I have nothing to really compare this one to. It was ok. Nothing special. I moved along to my main course, the Beef Pho, which was $12! Pretty pricey for Pho, but I was expecting it and just dealt with it because I REALLY wanted some hot, steamy, delicious Vietnamese Soup that I had been deprived of. The soup itself wasn't bad, and the noodles were cooked to perfection, however, the beef was not good at all. I ended up pulling about 4-5 pieces that were just fat out of my soup. The flavor of the meat wasn't great and was just downright disappointing. \n\nI'm not sure that I would return to Out The Door--there are just too many good restaurants in San Francisco to waste my time on a mediocre one like this.", "author": "Holly G."}

The front desk staff is not baby-crazy, but most of the waitstaff is.  The first time we ate there, the entire kitchen came out one-by-one to say hi to B and squeeze her cheeks (this may be because B is the cutest baby in the entire world, so YMMV).  The chef also sent over a special bowl of rice porridge from off the menu because he thought B would like it.  She did, and we may have taken a few bites too.\n\nThe food here is amazing--lots of the same stuff you can get at Slanted Door, but without the endless wait and noise.  Most kids could find something they like on the menu.  We usually deconstruct some spring rolls for B, and order an extra side of non-spicy vegetables for her.  For us, our favorite is Chicken in a Clay Pot, but we've always been happy with what we've ordered, even when I got the sardines last time (I really ate two whole fish, bones and everything!  Well, not the heads).  And they have wine on draft, which is tasty and cheap.  The Free Flow Sauvignon Blanc is especially good with spicy foods.\n\nHigh chairs?  Yes.\nChanging tables?   Didn't ask, but I don't think so.\nStroller-friendly?  They will store your stroller in a closet if it's small, or stash it in a corner if it's not.\nNoise level?  Not too bad, but I bet it gets really loud as the night progresses (lots of flat surfaces for noise to bounce off of)\nGeneral baby-friendliness?  Rather high, but I'd go during an off time to be sure.", "author": "Jennifer G."}

The service is really good and careful. The menu selection is easy to read and simply laid-out with prices very affordable. \n\nThe coconut pulled bread, chicken bun and the beignet were delicious.

The portion was perfect with diced assorted fruits and bacon bits. The warm maple syrup was just perfect.

There are numerous restaurants that do provide an authentic meal and there are others that are aspiring to something different.  I don't get the impression that OTD is attempting to serve strictly authentic Vietnamese food, rather this OTD, and Mr. Phan's other Vietnamese restaurants are strongly inspired by Vietnamese food, but its not your mother's cooking.\n\nOn to the experience.  We sat at the bar and our server failed to bring us one of the appetizers we ordered, the green papaya salad.  The problem is, that it took over 15 minutes for the salad to come after we informed our server that it had not arrived.  This salad must already be prepared, at least its components, well before service.  Then, our entree arrived approximately 30 to 40 minutes after that.  During the interim between our salad and the entree, our server never returned to take an additional drink order or apologize for the wait, although a manager did come over and acknowledge the wait.  When our entree, short ribs, did finally arrive, however, the ribs were cold in the center near the bone.  This is inexcusable.  I understand things can get cross in the kitchen and take a bit longer, but especially when it does come late, it must be properly prepared.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that the meal cost over $100.  At such a price, the shortcomings in service and execution of the short ribs earned this OTD location 2 stars.  I get the sense that the Phan empire is expanding a bit too rapidly to maintain the quality service and preparation that was the impetus to the rapid addition of new Phan restaurants.", "author": "Colleen B."}

The friendliness has improved a smidge, which is cool (I got smile the other day!). But the efficiency is still poor.  I've gotten to the point now where I insist on ordering my drink before my food because otherwise I am at least half way through my salad (sometimes finished) before the wine arrives.  Without any apology.  Why does it take longer to pour a glass than it takes someone to make a salad?  The cooks are busier than the person behind the bar - I watch.  It is such a mystery to me.  And forget trying to get your spring roll as your second course - I say pointedly every time that I want it after the salad and it always comes first - another seemingly simple timing request that cannot be met.  So again, I insist on waiting until after my salad has arrived before I order my springrolls. Sucks that I have to do this, but I cannot resist the food so I keep coming back.

No, it's not the sleek real estate that Slanted Door offers, but that's um, a function of the lack of a beautiful body of water called the Bay to provide diners with picturesque views of sailboats, the Bay Bridge, and Treasure Island.  None the less, Out the Door offered the same fare at slightly more reasonable prices (or were they the same?).  The service was excellent and friendly.\n\nI had the crispy imperial rolls and the asparagus and dungeness crab soup.

For starters, I absolutely love their salads which are very refreshing, light and tasty! I love their Green Papaya Salad (w/ tofu, picked carrots, rau ram, roasted peanuts & fish sauce), Jicama & Grapefruit salad (w/ red cabbage, candied pecans & sweet soy sauce) and daikon rice cakes (w/ shiitake mushrooms, cilantro & spicy soy sauce). Their Vietnamese crepes (banh xeo) are very authentic (loaded w/ shrimps, chicken & sprouts), crunchy & perfect! Their Banh Cuon (more like banh nam) is a steamed rice cake with ground pork, onions and mushrooms are really good, just slightly on the soft side. I also love their noodle bowls, especially grilled lemongrass pork, grileld garlic prawns and grilled five spice chicken breast all noodle bowls come w/ egg rolls (different but quite tasty!). Another must try is their Shaking Beef dish which is filet mignon sauteed w/ watercress, red onions and lemon - although it's not very authentic it is still very delicious and perfectly cooked dish.\n\n Unfortunately, one of Vietnamese fame dishes, pho, was a huge disappointing miss. The broth didn't have the proper seasonings of anise star, celery seeds, cinnamon, coriander & etc and it tasted very bland. In addition, it's not served with the traditional pho noodles. Seriously?! If you compare it to a regular soup then it's not too bad but it's definitely not cooked well enough to be called pho. Lost a star because of the price-- $12 for small pho bowl during lunch. Are you kidding me?\n\nOverall, delicious food w/ a pricey menu. Come early or late during lunch hour-- trust me, it gets really busy!", "author": "linh d."}

The service over time has really gone downhill and it shows in the quality of food.  The waiters seem unhappy to be there. \nIt was a late lunch and  I was dining at the counter when someone placed an enormous platter of food close to me.  I realized  this was the feeding station for the wait staff.  They all took turns filling their dishes from this big platter and either sitting down for lunch or grabbing a bite on the go. I felt as if I were an intruder at a cocktail party. \n After that was over, the counter was cleaned and our waiter brought the entire contents of the cash register to the counter and started making piles of bills. He was there close to a half hour counting and adding thousands of dollars. we were 15 feet from the front door and in full view from the street.  I felt so uncomfortable that they were inviting a holdup and I would be in the middle of it. \nThe whole experience has turned me off to all the Slanted Door restaurants.", "author": "carmine g."}

Every single time I have been, they botch the order (e.g., they bring me another person's glass of wine or food, forgot something we ordered).  About half of the time someone drops something and it shatters on the floor.

Their original to-go style caf\u00e9s located in the ferry building and Westfield shopping plaza offer excellent gluten free friendly Vietnamese noodle dishes, spring rolls, and rice bowls that boast organic, local ingredients. With Out The Door's somewhat newly opened restaurant location, you can find inspired variations on those tasty takeout dishes in a more elegant setting. For the gluten free crowd, their wait staff is knowledgeable about which dishes are safe (at the ferry building location they have a list of menu items that contain common allergens). Our waiter directed us to the beef pho and five spice chicken dish, served with thin rice noodles (had to be modified to be gf by omitting a soy sauce marinade). Both meals were exceptionally flavorful, in part because of their seasonal, fresh ingredients. For any trained gluten intolerant eater, you know that finding great Vietnamese food can sometimes be a challenge due to the common use of commercial soy sauce and hoisin sauce (both contain wheat). With restaurants like Out The Door, gluten free folk  aren't left with a plate of plain rice and steamed vegetables. Instead, we can share in the fun of slurping down a bowl of spicy noodles with all of the traditional flavors intact.\n\nFor photos and more gluten free friendly restaurants in San Francisco: www.GFinSF.com", "author": "lauren v."}

So, when some friends came into town from back east, I thought I would take them to OTD since I knew the food would be good, but maybe a little less expensive.  I also fully expected the menu to be less extensive, so I didn't have crazy expectations to begin with. I just wanted reliably good food and service. \n\nOur reservation for 4 people was for 9:00, but we didn't get seated until 10:00.  In the meantime, our server was very polite and apologetic and comped us some spring rolls.  Great, we said, thanks!  Waiting was not a big deal particularly because we were all drinking and having a good time.  However, we didn't get seated until 10:00 and our food didn't arrive until 10:45 at which point my husband and I realized that our fish clay pot dinner was exactly that--two chunks of fish in a pot.  No veggies, no rice, nothing.  Sooooo, we politely asked for rice and were informed that the entire restaurant was out of rice!  An Asian restaurant who runs out of rice?  Really?  We were nice, and they were trying to be nice (though you could tell that by this time they were ready to close as it got freezing cold in there and some of the staff in the back started moving boxes around.) so they brought us a small bowl of glass noodles.  It was a weird combination--fish and glass noodles.  I think it's really important to be upfront about the fact that you must order sides separately here, least you end up with a piece of fish for a meal.  Just tell me, and I would have ordered more. It's not a big deal. \n\nAnyway, so we left hungry and I returned home to eat a bowl of cereal.   \n\nI'm really hoping that OTD is only experiencing temporary discombobulation due to being new in the area.

Why open three more mediocre ones?  \n\nThis experience was wicked blah, if you know what I mean.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-07", "description": "After our 4th or 5th time here having a perfect dinner, I realized a Yelp review is long overdue.  The food here has been perfectly executed every time.  We've had the same dishes like the shaking beef at Slanted Door and the old Out the Door at the Westfield--for some reason the same food is much better executed here.  Their fish offerings change periodically but are always good.  Today it was halibut with a lemongrass sauce that had almost a pesto quality--delicious.  I have never, despite trying many many places, ever had a fresh roll as perfect as the ones here.  The rice paper skin is perfectly soft.  Often places don't soak them enough or let the rolls sit around so the skin gets a little hard/chewy.  Many places overstuff them so you lose the flavors of the individual ingredients inside (often the shrimp gets lost).  These are the right size with the right proportion of ingredients, and the peanut sauce takes these over the top.  We love the crispy imperial rolls.  Their shanghai soup dumplings are surprisingly good given this is not a Vietnamese dish.  They always change-up the vegetables but they are always good--tonight baby bok choy with slivers of fresh shiitake mushrooms.  Often at Asian places the desserts are not amazing.  But the desserts here are off the hook.  The mini berry pies and ice cream sandwiches were way beyond what you would expect.  Instead of the usual dark cookie you'd expect on an ice cream sandwich, they used freshly baked sugar cookies of some sort that were just bursting with flavor.  And the ice cream inside was impressive in taste and texture.  I don't even like dessert but really enjoyed these.  I love that the food here is not heavy--no cream, minimal oil, just clean fresh flavors.  Of course, a meal here can definitely add-up, but I really feel given the beautiful atmosphere, the fantastic service, and the quality of the food, that the price tag is well worth it.

The attention to food quality is up to par with that of Slanted Door.  Albeit, this is a more casual menu as far as menu items go.  The jook is pretty tasty and comes with the fried bread.  I still need to go back to actually sample everything else, but I will for sure come back to eat other things.  The pricing is very reasonable for the area, and you can easily drop in on your own as they have good bar and communal seating.  The only thing I'm not sure I like about the place, is that it's kind of nice inside.  Therefore, I might feel out of place showing up in my sweats after a run.", "author": "Simon Y."}

Unfortunately, I tainted my chicken pho broth with Sriracha sauce before actually sampling it.  I can at least tell you it smelled good.  The porridge was a delightful consistency, the rau rum (akin to cilantro) brings a much needed zing to the mix.

Not that I don't like this place, but I have only gone there for brunch so far, and I don't think their menu really shines for brunch; I have to say that my brunch experience is really 3.5 stars.\n\nI would say that this place is an excellent addition to the neighborhood.  Went there for brunch, it had a very varied menu for brunch (a couple of egg dishes, beef or chicken pho, chicken rice porridge, etc).  We started with iced coffee and beignets, along with some coconut bread.  The ice coffee was typical for a vietnamese coffee (dark coffee with sweeten condense milk).  The beignets and coconut breads were really good; the beignets were rich and the coconut bread was kind of sweet.  I had the chicken porridge; while it was good, the spices in it was a little different from the typical chinese porridge that I grew up on (can't really say what the difference is), so I have to say that it is not my favorite.  One of my friend had the baked egg dish, it was OK, but then I am not a big fan tomato sauce on my eggs.  Someone else had the poach eggs (I think on top of pork), which I thought was better.  But honestly, if you come here, maybe you should focus on the Asian dishes.\n\nService was good, but I think they are still working it out: they gave us the wrong menus when we sat down, and we had to ask for the sugar and a spoon when someone got a cappuccino.  \n\nOne of the other reviewers disagree that the prices were affordable.  I think the prices are affordable for the neighborhood; sorry, you are not going to get bargain pho in Pacific Heights.

Love Vietnamese food and was pleasantly surprised to see it in such a modern setting.\n\nOver the three visits, I managed to sample the Salad Roll, Grapefruit Jicama Salad, Papaya Salad, Beef Pho, Roast Pork Baguette, Claypot Chicken, and Lemongrass Chicken.  Umm, that wasn't all on my own by the way.  Note that the menus are different at each place, and that pho isn't necessarily on the dinner menu it seems like.\n\nThe first four were very good, with the mint coming through in the roll, and rau ram herb coming through in the Grapefruit Salad to make them distinctively more complex than regular Vietnamese food.  There was almost too many of them, but the candied pecans on the Grapefruit Salad were almost addictive.  Baguette had more pork than any sub I've ever seen, bordering on obscene almost, but was very tasty.  Pho was above average, but not mind-blowing.  I prefer the firmer dried noodles and I think these were the softer fresh variety or else they had been overcooked a bit.\n\nClaypot and Lemongrass Chicken were not so spectacular though.  For the price of these two mid-range dishes and the caliber of the place, one expects something more than the usual I think.  While the Claypot was merely pedestrian, I found the Lemongrass Chicken to be devoid of any lemongrass flavour at all.  DIning partner agreed too and we thought it tasted more like Kung Pao Chicken, with all the chilis dominating the flavour.  Sold as Kung Pao, it might have been a 4 star dish, but sold as Lemongrass Chicken, I'd give it a 2.\n\nBTW, the manager comp'ed me a side of bok choy when he saw me eating the Claypot Chicken without any rice (small effort at going low-carb), probably thinking that I was going to die from the salty sweetness.  Small touch, but to notice that detail when the room was pretty full and happening is what gets OTD a fourth star from me.  Also heard him tell one of the servers where some food critics had just been seated, and reminding him to make sure they had a good experience, so this guy was pretty on the ball.\n\nSo all in all, a four star experience slightly blemished by a couple of lower ranked dishes.

It was a saturday afternoon, practically no one was there, and we still watched our pho sit there for like 5 minutes before our server brought it to the table!  Eating lukewarm pho is not very fun.  \n\nAlso, my fiance ordered the beef pho, and raw beef was on top.  our server said \"the beef is supposed to cook in the broth\" but since the broth was not piping hot the beef was pretty gross. we told the server that the broth wasn't that hot anymore, and she said \"well it looks hot enough.\"  \n\nthen our server took the pho away while we were still working on it, and took the beer away while there was still beer in the bottle!  talk about annoying. \n\nthe pho itself wasn't that great either.  no vegatables and very oily broth.  they also skimp on the siracha and plum sauce.  instead of putting a bottle of siracha sauce and a bottle of plum sauce at every table, they only have one bottle at the counter, and you have to wait for the server to put it in a tiny dish and bring it over to you.  and then you probably have to ask for more and it will take them like 10 minutes to bring you another little tiny dish of sauce.  they also brought out a tiny dish of the fixings that go with the pho (eg bean sprouts, cilantro, basil, lime,etc ) for my fiance and i to share.  i asked if we could get a second dish so that we could each have the fixings, and this also took another 10 minutes to bring out, so our pho was tasteless and got even colder.\n\nwe went over to our favorite spot in oakland for pho the very next day, and it was SO much better it wasn't even funny.  superb broth, tons veggies in it, tons of tofu, tons of fixings, tons of sauce, and great super fast service.  all for 1/2 the price!\n\ni give this place 6 more months, tops.", "author": "rockridge o."}

Take a detour off the busy drag of Fillmore and a couple doors down on Bush you'll find the second location of Out the Door. It's much smaller and more intimate than either of it sister restaurants downtown, but still serving up those delicious concoctions with an Asian flare. The chicken clay pot was absolutely amazing, with a thick, flavorful sauce accompanying the tender chicken pieces perfectly. The rice soaked up the sauce and we were able to enjoy every last bite. Once again, Phan has also done a great job with vegetables, this time cooking up roasted corn that pops sweetness in your mouth and green beans that I could have eaten by the pound. The same old favorites remain, like the crispy imperial rolls and the shaking beef, but new additions are really great. Lastly, Phan has decided to go with the new fad of \"wine on tap\" and it's definitely worth a sip...or two. Now I can enjoy one of my favorite downtown spots in the heart of the Fillmore.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

The food is very consistent and fresh, and the kitchen is extremely accommodating re reasonable requests (less spice, no nuts, etc.).  The wait staff is well trained, efficient, relaxed and professional.  (No, I don't work there.)  The managers are friendly and welcoming to regulars, patient with newcomers negotiating what might be an unfamiliar menu, and models of diplomacy when situations get sticky.  Hands down, this is my favorite place to eat on Fillmore Street.  If there were a suggestion box, however, I would recommend the following:  improve the wine list, especially the very weak and limited by-the-glass list.  The wines are okay (I'm trying to be nice) -- like wine brought to a book club -- but I think the quality overall is far below what the kitchen puts out.  Second complaint: -- and I'm hardly alone in saying this: the restaurant is offensively and stunningly loud, especially at peak hours.  There's not a soft surface (other than human bodies) in the place.  Metal, tile, steel, marble, wood...  I have friends who, when I say, Meet at OTD?, will say, No, let's go someplace where we can talk.  (Actually, talking is fine -- it's listening that's the problem.)  Related problem -- the banquette along the wall is metal and cold, cold, cold.  No cushions, no pillows.  Sure, people have more \"padding\" than they used to, but, even so, why not a little bit of man-made comfort?  I'm posting this message so that people will know that the food and service at OTD are stellar, the wine list weaker than it should be, and that maybe, if enough people feel similarly (and give feedback), someone high up in management will address the noise level and provide customers a bit more comfort -- in exchange for their continued patronage.", "author": "Tiny M."}

We expected the best  having been to the Slanted Door many, many times, always with a very good outcome.  This is not what we found at OTD however.  It's extremely loud--like Slanted Door.\n But unlike SD, which  can be forgiven because the food and service qualities way overcome this negative, OTD was a total bust.  The Spring Rolls were, in fairness, acceptable as a starter, but the Melon soup was was extremely salty ( to encourage  drink sales?), the Shaking Beef was tasteless with several pieces being tough and others being close to rare and chewy, and the rice was extra dry and tasteless. The crowning disappointment was that the Imperial Rolls (\"cha gio\") a Vietnamese staple and delicacy were totally miserable. The shrimp and pork fillings were only half cooked and terrible tasting, not to mention a health hazard.  \nHaving reached this point, we decided that it would be good to let the the waiter know that there were some real issues with the food and make them aware of the what we had encountered. This with the objective of expecting him to provide feedback  to the chef, who surely would be interested in how his or her food was being (mis)prepared.  We were seated at the counter and our (very polite) sever called over a person who was apparently one of the restaurant managers. In the spirit of being helpful we explained the experience to the manager, a young man with a spiked mohawk.  To our surprise he immediately became defensive, and with regard to the undercooked fillings for the Imperial Rolls, stated that  he personally had several years of experience making  these rolls and that they were always properly cooked. He stronglypointed out that we were wrong with our findings.  So much for constructive comments. At that point my wife, who is  a gourmet and an excellent Vietnamese cook, and I simply looked at him in amazement, realizing that any further conversation would be futile.\nHopefully for the new restaurant, this was a one-off occurrence and not something you will encounter.  However, based on our experience we are doubtful and this is definitely not a place we would recommend.  With all the choices in SF, it is not a restaurant we will visit again. We suggest you don't waste your time and money", "author": "K Michael F."}

The iced tea tasted like the Wildroot hair tonic my father used to use.  The \"bavette\" steak comprised three small pieces of beef surrounded by french fries drowned in gravy--that's right, french fries in gravy.  We sent the tea back, of course, and then they tried to charge us for it.  I have had a number of takeout meals from the OTD at Ferry Plaza, and only rarely have they risen above mediocrity.  The famous Slanted Door itself is an intolerable environment, a complete assault on the eardrums, and better Vietnamese food can be had at almost any other Vietnamese restaurant in the city.  The whole outfit, in my view, is a fraud.", "author": "Francesco D."}

That stuff goes for $1.50 in downtown San Jose. I've become a fan of Out the Door though based on it's other offerings, namely the chicken rice porridge which I grew up eating but rarely make at home because I don't want to invest the time to wait for the rice to cook when I could just drive here and get it. I've also enjoyed some of their other dishes but it's the rice porridge that keeps me coming back, for those of you who enjoy rice porridge (aka congee and jook) OTD's is flavorful and light with lots of \"Chinese donuts\" and greens to fill out the flavor and add some interesting texture. It brings me right back to weekend mornings when I would enjoy a bowl before heading off to Kumon. Asian peeps you know what I'm talking about....", "author": "Cathy T."}

Great spot for people watching on the street and the light coming in from outside.  Well decorated in simple, yet earth highlighting tones and materials.  The flowers on the tables and through the restaurant were small, yet unique and elegant at the same time and lended a touch of color to the room. Four of us had the vietnamese coffee and beignets, which was reminiscent of the Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.  The coffee could have been a tad stronger, but mostly good.  Having just been in NOLA two weeks ago, and missing it already, this is just what we needed.  Two ordered the soft scrambled eggs with dungeness and chives - incredible!  Light fluffy eggs, perfect crab, hint of chives, crunchy hot mini baguette, only thing missing is the potato side that normally fills the plate at most places.  To be honest, we didn't really miss it much.  One had the slow cooked eggs with the Niman Ranch brisket.  Loved it!  Souvied eggs over tender beef brisket hash with a crunchy hot baguette.  If you love hash, you must try this.  We had the Strawberry and Chantilly Cream Pancakes together as breakfast-dessert.  Excellent!  Very small, but very, very good.\nSaturday Dinner was our next meal.  We ordered to go for 11 people a half hour before we needed it.  This is not recommened, however, they pulled it off  no problem.   We had discussed the vegan options on the menu with them earlier and had ordered half vegan dishes and half meat.  It was a huge hit!  One of the few times our vegan friends were able to have a full plate of food from take out.  Two of them even tried some new things!  We had both imperial rolls and spring rolls, papaya salad, jicama and grapefruit salad, daikon rice cakes, dungeness with cellophane noodles, stir fry gulf prawns, day boat scallops, shaking beef and some other things.  Everyone loved it.\nSunday - we made it in time for brunch.  New orders were the fried eggs and ham and the banh mi pork xiu mai.  All hits.  \nExcellent, personable service from Marianna and Gus, and Valerie handled the take out order with ease.", "author": "Monica S."}

We both were suprised when we showed up at 8:30pm and there weren't any open tables. We waited only about 10 minutes for a table. We started off with the crispy imperial rolls which were perfect! Then we shared the Shaking Beef, his long time fave and now I am a big fan. We also got the scallops, they were cooked perfectly but neither of us cared for the sauce they were in.

When it arrived, I felt it needed a kick (it tasted more fried than spicy) and attempted, discretely, to get my server/bartender's attention (she was standing across the bar, chatting) to no avail, until a customer seated near her noticed me and nudged her to come over.  I requested a  couple of wedges of lemon and  she returned with 3 slivers (from the bar); I asked, politely, if I could have  wedges instead and she looked at me like she was just 'oh so bothered' and said she'd see if the kitchen could do that ?!?  She then returned with a whole lemon, cut in half...\nFor the rest of my meal (I ordered the standard spring rolls to follow) she was surly (as if trying to get her attention had totally offended her sensibilities). As I exited the restaurant there was no one at the door to say 'thank you', nor was it ever apparent that a manager was in charge and cared, even remotely, about the experience the diners were having.  The staff, I had observed in my previous visits, all seem oddly unhappy, and brusque - as if they were the stepchildren of the employees at the Ferry building who clearly make bank nightly.  Something is truly remiss at this location.\nThere are many restaurants on Fillmore, a half a block away, that I will choose to patronize instead and since OTD is around the corner on an otherwise unpopulated strip of Bush Street, it'll be easy to forget it exists.", "author": "heather D."}
