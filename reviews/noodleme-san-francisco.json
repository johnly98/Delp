Our delivery order from NoodleMe arrived on Friday, May 18th around 12:15pm via Caviar.\n\nI ordered the XO Habanero with Egg Noodles: Egg noodles, cabbage, kale, bean sprouts, bamboo, kimchee, XO-habanero flavor, and pork broth ($9). I'm not big on noodles in my soup, so I put those aside and added everything else to the broth. The noodles did resemble wonton mein for anyone wondering what the noodles may be like. The soup had a decent amount of flavor. Though I do like my pork based soups to be meatier. And for a habanero broth, I found it lacking in heat. It wasn't even really spicy at all. The dish did come with a good amount of toppings though.\n\nFor people who prefer milder flavors, I think this may fit the bill. But I found their noodle soup to be rather bland. When I see habanero, I need super spicy. This barely had any heat. Okay if you are just craving a somewhat brothy asian soup.", "author": "Elena N."}

I was surprised when arriving just after noon to see about 15 people past the door. It took 20 minutes until food was in hand; fortunately, they're smart to have people fill out their orders in line so they're not wasting time hemming and hawing at the register. Staff have always been friendly and helpful.\n\nOrdering in advance online is definitely the way to go, especially since there's only a few counter-style seats and the place gets cramped. Sadly, I typically get the Veganese but sub wheat noodles (closer to ramen-style noodles) and there's not a way to do this online. The best reason to order to-go? The super awesome package design of the takeout carrier! Your broth sits on top, separate from the ingredients so they don't get all soggy. They fit snugly in the cardboard wrap holder. On my first walk back I was a little nervous but those containers aren't going anywhere. Every time I get comments wondering where this smart lunch package came from.\n\nPortions are quite large and in range for the price point of ~$12-$15 before tax. I'm always thankful for vegetarian and vegan options, especially when priced lower than the meat options (as they should be!). Ingredients are fresh and the broth is flavorful.

But the pick-up experience was quite disappointing, as I waited 26 min after I arrived to get my food, which is already 3 min after the quoted pick-up time. It completely defeats the purpose of quick noodle soup and ordering online, and I think I would've gotten my food faster had I been waiting in the physical line. I do feel that this is just one of those crazy days, based on the Yelp reviews I've read, and there were only 3 people working the noodle assembly line. So I will update my review in the future if that experience changes. But for now, minus one star for that super long wait.\n\nI had the Veggie Delight, with rice noodles, mushrooms, soft boiled egg, corn, tofu, seaweed, green onions, and the XO habanero vegetable broth. The ingredients tasted fresh. I love that they are not stingy about the toppings. There were plenty of mushrooms and corn and tofu and etc. in my bowl. The broth was flavorful and not too spicy. The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. But as other Yelpers indicated, the egg was cold like other toppings. The broth was lukewarm as other Yelpers mentioned as well. Towards the end of my bowl, everything was cold, which made me sad. Minus one star for these details.\n\nI like the different options and the ability to customize your own noodle soup bowl. Price is alright for FiDi lunch spot. Shop is small and cramp during lunch hour rush. Best bet is to take it to-go and nuke it for a bit in the microwave at work.

Perhaps that was my mistake.  I didn't make it my true custom cup of noodles.   Still, reading the menu, it sounded right up my alley:  egg noodles, sweet onion mix, prawns, ground pork, spicy tofu, pork broth, habanero flavor and fried shallots.   The only customization I did was to skip the prawns and get an egg instead.   Hell, the server was even so kind as to give me an extra egg!\n\nSo why 3 measly stars, you ask?   It was a decent cup of noodles, but it certainly didn't tantalize my taste buds.  I must say the most disappointing part of the meal were the sad and lifeless egg noodles themselves.   They really didn't add anything to the dish.   The pork was rather bland and I'm not sure how that constituted as spicy tofu.   It was tofu, tasting like tofu always does:  nothing.\n\nTo recap, service was impeccable and friendly and the concept is great.

If the pork shoulder is not tender, it would be wiser to serve them in slices rather than cube. Pork shoulder is one of the toughest cut and requires long cooking time under low heat to tenderize therefore if you don't have the time, may as well take it off the menu. Also they were tasteless so I give pork shoulder a 2 out of 5 (5 being highest).\n\nOther ingredients (minced pork, mushroom, sprout, green onion, etc.) were ok but again the minced pork is overcooked and tough, I guess this is the result of them trying to keep it warm thus overcooking it. I give other ingredients 2 out of 5.\n\nThe soup was supposed to be pork broth but I couldn't taste nothing but Miso and salt. I felt thirsty after I finished the bowl, signs of MSG. I give the broth 2 out of 5.\n\nOverall, each ingredient in my noodle soup has its own taste and does not go well together.\n\nHowever if you are in a hurry and are only up for a quick bite, their service is decently fast however the line builds up after 12:10ish so get there earlier.\n\n16 dollars is just too much and with their location, I bet half of this goes to rent.

An ample amount of ground pork, also full of flavor.  There were 3 shrimp which were basically unseasoned, but a little broth helps jazz them up.

I ordered the wheat noodles (ramen) with the miso/pork broth and an egg, and it tasted pretty good. Everything was very flavorful (although also kind of salty). The egg was also pretty runny inside, which was a little disappointing since it cost $2 extra. \n\nThe bowl was packaged quite nicely so that the soup liquid was separate from the vegetables, meats, and other ingredients. This made it easy to transport, since the restaurant itself doesn't have any seating. My only concern is the price - I felt that it was a bit expensive for noodles. This might be due to the fancy packaging, which eventually just gets thrown away anyways. The portion was a good size, and the bowls it can range anywhere from $10-15 depending on if you decide to add meats or other toppings.\n\nOverall, a fun experience and concept!

This place left me with mixed feelings. I liked what they were trying to do and I can definitely see where they're coming from, but I don't see much value in using this approach with noodles. Noodles are supposed to be cheap, and with the customizations, the price is not worth what you get, in my opinion. I opted to make my own bowl because the set bowls on the menu were like $11-$13. But when I got down to the end of the assembly line, the $2 add-on egg turned my DIY bowl into $12....I mean seriously, $2 for an egg?! So not worth. Portion sizes aren't that big either. I went with the ramen noodles, spicy tofu topping (not that spicy at all), and spinach and bean sprouts for my veggie choices. For soup I chose the pork-based broth and miso flavoring. The flavor was good, but the soup was too salty. \n\nThis place also uses a ton of packaging. Your soup comes in a separate bowl, your noodles/toppings come in its own larger bowl, and both bowls are then packaged together with this fancy cardboard holder thing. Makes it super easy to carry (and they put in the utensils and napkins too), but sigh, sort of unnecessary.

Then you get to choose 3 types of veggies/ herbs that go in your noodle bowl. You can choose from an assortment of either veggies, tofu, onions or cilantro/ other herb mixes. \n3.  The next step is to choose your protein. They offer soft boiled egg, spicy tofu, pork, prawn, chicken, meatball and mushroom. \n4.  Then you choose your flavorings and broth. Their are two options of broth either vegetarian or meat (mushroom or pork&chicken. Flavorings include: miso, red curry, xo habenero, peanut curry and lemongrass-ginger. \n\nI ordered my noodle bowl with rice noodles, spinach, cilantro/basil mix, and their sweet onion mix. Then I opted for a soft boiled egg along with the spicy tofu. For flavoring I got their mushroom broth with their xo habenero flavoring and umami. Overall it was delicious. Although there was too much herbs/ onions in my soup for my liking. The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly but the spicy tofu was not spicy at all. The habanero broth was super flavorful and definitely has a good kick! (Pro tip! Don't be afraid to ask for a sample. I was curious to know how the habanero flavoring tasted like and I asked them if I could sample it and they were super nice about it! ) \n\nSince there are so many options, ask questions and ask for samples!

Added the \"salsa\" from the condiment bar) \n\nCute space, cute packaging, fun condiments to try, and the perfect meal for a cold rainy day.

I went in today after the general lunch mob and I was greeted at the door with a menu. Once inside, the place smelled exactly like I expected it to, a good sign of what was to come. This is basically a build-your-own ramen bowl, or you have the option to select from one of a few pre-configured bowls. I chose to go with the latter and order the Miles Davis bowl containing wheat noodles, veggies, a nice mix of proteins, in a pork broth. I was intrigued by the process for building. I just finished eating my bowl and it was quite tasty! I would have liked a little more spice, but that was my fault for not stopping by the condiments bar before leaving. Or maybe they could have reminded me of that?\n\nThe packaging process is impressive, but I felt a little excessive. I understand to keep things fresh, but it was just so much to be thrown away. They might consider asking how soon the food will be eaten and package accordingly. Maybe that takes too long? I don't know, I've never ran a food business so I am sure I am missing something important. \n\nThe bowls are priced kinda high, a little higher than Ramen Bar around the corner. Granted, NoodleMe had more protein (chicken, ground pork, and egg) than anything I have gotten at Ramen Bar, but I might be ok with that at Ramen Bar considering they have seating options. \n\nThe staff was nice, although obviously a little slow from getting used to everything happening around them. Maybe not enough prep/ training before opening. I expect this to get better though with time. \n\nSo, 1 star down for packaging and price. Otherwise I am happy this place is here. I will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Gerard C."}

Ordered the veganese soup with the mushroom broth and I really enjoyed all the flavors, including the tofu and shiitake mushrooms. I thought everything tasted really fresh. I saw a lot of complaints about the packaging, but i thought it was rather clever - the broth is separate from the noodles and other fillings because the container is compostable and gets soggy with the broth, and they keep it all together with a cardboard holder. My only complaint is the price of course, but it is within range for most lunch places.

I am a vegetarian so I chose build your own bowl option. I tried wheat noodles which were very greasy. They added very less quantity of all the vegetables which I asked to add which basically meant I just had noodles in my bowl. Thats why I asked them to add spicy tofu. I regretted my decision as the tofu was so much salty I could not eat. Also they charged 1.50 for the tofu which made my bowl cost $11.50. The broth Xo Habanero and mushroom was again so much salty that the total bowl saltiness got doubled. I through away the food after having some as I was not able to eat at all. I was feeling very frustrated to throw $11+ doller food. I am not sure how they are serving such food that too at so much high cost. There are so many nice options available just across the street which are lot healthier tastier and comes for around half of the price.
