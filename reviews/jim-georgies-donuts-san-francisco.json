I remember as a kid I would come here in the early morning hours, slugging along my Father's side. He worked really early and would take me along, the plus side was I could order as much donut holes as physically possible.\n\nSome of my favorite memories are in this restaurant. Walking in to see my uncles, and uncles uncles' and other relatives sitting along the back. Sharing hugs and getting money from each of my family members, I would walk out with a cool $20 in dolla dolla bills ya'll! \n\nIt's a quaint diner, simple food for the neighboring working class residents. It's family owned, supported by the neighborhoods and now accepting credit cards HEYOOO!! \n\nThis is a staple, not only in my neighborhood but in my family. My family, from all over the Bay Area, comes by just to grab a quick bite to eat. I'm sure it's more for nostalgia, but I'll never give this place up.", "author": "Mileti A."}

Burgers,  grilled cheese & breakfasts are traditional and great! Prices are very reasonable. \nThey also have donuts and coffee if that's what you only want. That's cool  too.\nAt this writing, I was on this street looking for something for take out. There are alot of eateries on this street. Couldn't decide. So I went with this place. A for sure place I'm familiar with. Another big plus is that they're open really freaking early for the working folks. Other eateries seem to cater to other folks at 8am! Snap! Morning's half over!\nI'm here now. It's 5pm. Place is full! Grill is very busy! Alot of chatter in here. That's a tell tale sign. Lastly the staff always cordial with a smile!

I'm not sure what separates them from the rest.  \n\nI usually buy a dozen and 6 pack donut holes.  No...the dozen isn't for just me!!  I share them!  Except for the donut holes!  They're all mine!  They taste like air!  I don't feel one bit guilty popping those suckers in my mouth one after the other.  My second favorite is their buttermilk bar.  It reminds me of my Grandfather.  Breaks apart, nice a fluffy!\n\nI've also had a BLT there for lunch.  It was your typical homemade BLT.  Tasted great with crunchy bacon and ripe red tomatoes.\n\nIt's always packed so I usually grab food and go.  It's small with only a handful of tables available.

The name of the restaurant sounds Western, but I think it's owned by Asians (at least all the staff are Asian and their photos are featured at the front counter). I'm personally a fan and have come here multiple times for breakfast. It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly why I like this place so much because while the food is great, it isn't outstanding and normally I rate my restaurants primarily on their food. It must be the case that I love the atmosphere here and listening to the staff make small talk with the loyal crowd of returning customers.\n\nWhat I liked:\n* Very filling and tasty breakfast combos. They cook it for you fresh.\n* Fair prices for the quantity of food you get, though I think it is cash-only.\n* Very friendly staff and generally warm atmosphere. A lot of the customers are returning customers and the staff seems to know them well.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n* The donut I had was a bit too sweet? Honestly, there isn't anything solid that I dislike about this place.", "author": "Michael M."}

My first caveat is that I don't have a sweet tooth, and just the thought of Krispy Kreme donuts sends me into insulin shock... \n\nBut, I was hankering for an old fashioned burger--so armed with some greenbacks (cash only), I dropped into this old school dive and ordered a double cheeseburger with fries. The very cheerful and patient lady behind the counter asked if I wanted everything on it. I did. Then she asked if I would mind accepting a previously made order identical to mine that was still hot, but the to-go customer had not arrived yet and she was concerned they might no-show. \n\nI accepted the order since I was ravenous, I picked up a chocolate covered cake donut for dessert (shocking, I know--it's for review purposes only... ;). \n\nThe fries were warm, squishy but not soggy. And they tasted great with my concoction of ketchup and hotsauce. The burger was hefty--great sign! The patties were a bit thicker than I had hoped, and the cheese cap leered at me as it oozed down the face of the burger. The patties were seasoned simply and were juicy! The lettuce had crunch, onions were sweet and snappy. The pickles crisp and the tomatoes, flavorful. The buns had been toasted lightly.\n\nThe cake donut was not as dense as the ones I am used to, and had a strong vanilla scent to them. They were not bad, just not what I was expecting. \n\nWhen it was time to leave, I returned the to-go condiments I did not need or use in the bag to the lady--who had been chattering in a foreign language to the male cook. I asked if they were Thai--turns out they are Cambodian! So I rolled off my best \"Chomreab Suor\" at them with palms pressed together and fingertips on my chin in respect.\n\nAfter complimenting them on their food, I thanked them in Cambodian \"AwKhoon\" and ambled out with a full belly and a broad grin having dropped barely $8+ for a satisfying lunch.", "author": "Lu-Shien T."}

Used to come here in my pre-undergraduate days as a kid and it would always be a great time with me and my friends when we were growing up together. \n\nCheeseburger and fries were always so consistent --- fries were always so hot right when it was being served, being a stubborn kid, holding the fries and feeling the hotness on my fingers, then transferring it to my mouth was me being naive as I've burned my pallet and tongue a few times like this. I would have to cool off the fries with some ketchup and the fries would always be salted the right amount; not too salty either! The cheeseburger here is made on their grill that you can see yourself and you can just smell the great aroma when you walk by the restaurant. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions were always fresh whenever you ordered the cheeseburger here, yes, the cheeseburger and fries were always one of my favorites at J. Georgie's. \n\nMy ultimate favorite thing at J. Georgie's were their doughtnut holes! They're absolutely fantastic and if you have yet to try their doughnut holes when they're fresh, then you're missing out on way too much!

There are about a half dozen long communal tables inside (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vVuPM8g9SA9m-iIOM_93dA?select=6IdfM4A9f-3JPJpbjsDiIA) and everybody sits together.  I order food to eat in often because I find it's a great way to meet my neighbors and many of the folks who work in our neighborhood.  Neighborhood gossip fuels many of the conversations inside, and it's often fun and always interesting.\n\nThe Asian family that runs the restaurant is super nice.  In addition to offering fresh brewed coffee and tea and a window full of fresh donuts J. Georgie's serves up all day breakfasts and huge burgers that won't hurt your wallet.  Check out their double hamburger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vVuPM8g9SA9m-iIOM_93dA?select=ypgLL-SD7J8vQDy6wFBVWA).  That's two quarter pound beef patties fried up on the same griddle that they use to fry up bacon and served on an oversized bun with mayo, shredded lettuce, a slice of onion, a thick slice of tomato and pickle chips.  The huge burger comes with a large order of meaty fries all for a measly $5.40.  The burgers are a bit on the greasy side, but if you eat them slowly often you can taste some of that bacon fat taste mixed in with the beefy taste.  So good!\n\nBecause I get out from work around midnight on most weekdays I've often walked past this restaurant in the middle of the night.  The lights in the back of the restaurant are usually on, and I can smell the aroma of the fresh donuts being fried up in the back.  Most of their donuts are in the 80 cents range but they do make donut holes also and those cost much less.  They carry canned sodas, bottled juices, Berkeley Farms dairy products and an assortment of flavors of Jarritos in their refrigerated unit.  Cash only.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

It's a diner.\n\nJ Georgie's is a Portola district classic, for sure. It's hard to explain why I love it - the place is pretty beat down, you order your own food (no service) and it's cramped. But there's something strangely nostalgic and comforting about it - and not just because they serve mostly \"comfort\" food. Come here with no expectations other than walking out a full belly and a full wallet.\n\nEating here brings me back to my high school days. If I only had a few dollars I would take myself to J Georgie's and split some fries with a friend for $1.50 or get a few glazed donuts with a chocolate milk. Nowadays I come here for breakfast sandwiches or clubs, which are wholesome and delicious. It's the type of place where you could sit for hours and no one looks at you funny or makes you feel like you haven't ordered enough food to justify the seat you're taking. It's welcoming, in a hole-in-the-wall type of way.\n\nAs long as I can remember, there has been a group of old men who get together here every day. Just goes to show, this is the type of place with a lot of regulars, whic hspeaks volumes about the place.

I finally got to enter when my husband was craving a donut. From my first visit, I noticed that it looked quite gloomy because it appeared with little lighting inside where the tables were, along with its old and un- updated interior. Anyways, their donuts were good. \n\nOn Labour day, my hubby decided we try having breakfast here as its nearby. Hubby ordered a breakfast combo that consisted of sausages, eggs, toast, and hash browns. I bought myself a regular coffee. It was a very simple and easy to make kind-of breakfast but I appreciated it because it gave me that \"out of town\" and road trip feel which I find heart- warming. There's something about those cheap, and convenient breakfast joints when you don't feel like preparing at home. Surprisingly, the regular coffee tasted good too for such a cheap price that you can refill.  I also realized that they can turn on the lights in the dining area and no longer felt gloomy. However, my suggestion to the owners with be to at least make some little interior updates to create a brighter and clean atmosphere. I hope they pretty-up this place.", "author": "Erika K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-06", "description": "Simply put, this is the place where local San Franciscans, that reside in the Portola-Silver Terrace areas go to on their way to work.  Decent breakfast, hot coffee, and doughnuts are the main menu fare.  There are also burgers and other flat-topped items.  \n\nI have not been in a while for breakfast, but it is one of the few places that have kept their sign and menu in an ever changing neighborhood. I have stopped for coffee and a doughnut when I am up that early and my waist can afford it.  (Who am I kidding?  Screw my waist!)\n\nThe doughnuts are always fresh. I attribute that to the quick turn around and the steady traffic in the mornings.\n\nThe only downside to this place is that they do not have a parking lot and due to bus stops and parking restrictions it is still sometimes hard to find a place to park.\n\nBy observation, I watch most locals take the risk of running in and out, grabbing their wares, and hoping that a parking attendant has not placed a ticket on their vehicles by the time they have come back out.", "author": "Joshua C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-04-16", "description": "I used to love donuts when I was a kid. I would look forward to getting one from Safeway whenever I went grocery shopping with my mom. And then in high school, I remember trying Krispy Kreme for the first time and it felt like a literal orgasm in my mouth or a slice of heaven. Since then, I don't know what's happened but I've had a falling out with donuts. When I eat Krispy Kreme now, it's just a donut to me. I don't like it but I don't hate it, but considering how unhealthy it is, I'm glad I don't care much for it. \n\nBased on these reviews, I was hoping I would get that childhood Krispy Kreme experience when I bit into my donut but alas it was just a donut. I did like it slightly better than Krispy Kreme though because it wasn't throw it in my face sweet. And I do appreciate the fact that this place makes their own donuts. Not many places do that anymore. \n\nI also had the omelette and an orange juice. For some reason, I was expecting the OJ to be fresh squeezed. Technically it was, but it was prepackaged. No biggie, just mentioning it as a detail for you readers. As for the omelette, it was very filling and the condiments (tomatoes and whatnot) were very tasty. I didn't have high expectations for this either but just noting that the omelette isn't shaped like an actual omelette. It comes with bread and hash browns. Make sure to tell them you don't want your bread buttered if you're lactose-intolerant or just don't like butter on your bread. As for the hash browns, they're pretty flavorless but that's where ketchup comes in. \n\nLastly, we were sitting at the second to last table at the back of the store and I could smell the odors from the bathroom. That was quite unpleasant so I'd suggest sitting closer to the front of the store. One table distance really makes a difference.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back to this place if someone else wants to but I would definitely never ask to come here myself.", "author": "Karen C."}

It is missing the \"& Hamburgers\" which is what really caught my eye. \n\nThis place is basically in my neighborhood - well it's within easy walking distance anyway. But I noticed it because it's near a 101 South entrance. And when I would drive to work, it would look at me while I was waiting to turn left on to the freeway. \"Donuts and Hamburgers?  That's an interesting combination.  huh!\".\n\nWell Saturday morning I woke up early and walked over here and grabbed a donut. It was pretty good, and the place was packed. I figured that was a good sign, and I planned to come back again to try some more food.\n\nYesterday, Tuesday, I was working from home in the morning like I always do. And when I left at 10am I was hungry. So I decided to go back and try out some of their cooked food. I had french toast and eggs, and you know what? While it wasn't fantastic, it was pretty good. \n\nThis place has a pretty good neighborhood eatery feel, with people reading newspapers on the long tables, and such. The employees are nice and cheerful, the food is decent or better (I've yet to try the lunch food) and the prices are fair. And, oh yes, it is within half a mile form my place. I will be back!\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI went here for lunch today, and the lunch was good, and cheap, and I love, love, the neighborhoody feel of it. It is now 5 stars!", "author": "neil c."}

Just seeing it from a distance takes me back to when I was a kid, when my mom would surprise me with a donut from there when she came home from work, or sometimes while walking down the street towards Walgreens, we would make a surprise turn into Jim Georgie's.  I was so proud to be tall enough to reach the counter and point to which donut I wanted.  TOP NOTCH FOR ALWAYS DISPLAYING DONUTS IN THE WINDOW - LOVE IT.  When I was old enough to walk around and spend money on my own, I'd get a small bag of fries to munch as I walked home.  I think I went to high school with the daughter of the family that runs it now.\n\nTo this day, if ever I am walking past that window, I can't help but look at the donuts and briefly flash back to my childhood.
