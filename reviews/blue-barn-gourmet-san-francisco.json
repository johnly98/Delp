My order (The Tostada salad) came in an adorable, massively sized to-go box, and was packed to the brim with salad, which I was very impressed with. Although I was starving and devoured the whole thing, the salad is definitely large enough to be split over two meals. The Tostada consists of romaine, chicory chop, toasted corn, black beans, cherry tomatoes, jicama, scallions, herbs, pumpkin seeds, tortilla strips, white cheddar & chipotle-agave vinaigrette, and cost $13.75.\n\nThe romaine was not super crunchy, did not taste incredibly fresh, and the ingredients seemed a little wilted, but I will give Blue Barn the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to being smushed at the bottom of a delivery bag for 45 minutes. The chipotle-agave vinaigrette was incredibly flavorful, complements the salad perfectly, and really gives the salad a \"southwestern\" profile. Perhaps if I ordered and dined in-store, the ingredients would taste fresher and look more alive. I would not recommend ordering their salads via third-party delivery apps.\n\nBlue Barn is a little more expensive compared to its competitors, which I am not sure is warranted. While Blue Barn Gourmet delivers an awesome salad, I would recommend Split (and even sweetgreen) before recommending Blue Barn. Nonetheless, you cannot go wrong with any of the salads here.", "author": "Claire L."}

I visited SF for work and ate here 4/5 days that I was in the area.\n\nThe salads are freaking bomb dot com. I was obsessed with the spring salad. I added steak, medium rare and fell in love with every bite. The salad has everything you can imagine and it keeps you full all day. I think the salads are intended to be shared but I ate the whole thing every time because I didn't have a fridge in my room and because the salad was that good.", "author": "Shelley C."}

Right?\nBig mistake on my part!\n\nThis location on Chestnut Street is tiny and badly designed to accommodate eating there... I would order to go.\n\nI ordered a simple, but pricey, fried chicken sandwich and fries with an iced tea. About 30 minutes had gone by and I still was waiting for my food! I thought something is definitely not right, since people that had come in after me were receiving their food orders. I finally enquired about my order and the woman who appeared to be running the show located my food and dumped it on the table... no apologies... nada!!\n\nSome advice: Warm, friendly customer service makes up for any mishaps in the kitchen. Also if you're the manager and are having a hectic, busy day fulfilling food orders, it's always a good idea to be upfront and inform the customer at the time of placing the order that there maybe a longer than usual wait of say 20 mins or more.\n\nLong wait + dismissive customer service + inflated prices = Blue Barn Gourmet \n\nNO THANKS!

My tuna salad kept me full from an early lunch until a late dinner.\n\nThey have a great selection of a lot of different types of salads, and even a build your own option, though it was a little overwhelming to choose ingredients while standing at the counter so I opted for one of their ready-made options. My to-go salad came in an adorable box that looked like Chinese takeout, so obviously photo-worthy. The salad had a generous scoop of tuna tartare, tons of greens, and enough mix-ins that I didn't even need the lemon miso dressing for flavor.\n\nThis is definitely a post workout type of spot.

I said I was going to be in the area for work, I headed there early to avoid traffic and walked around the plaza. It was great timing because there was a farmers market there. I walked around and tried a few samples until I got hungry enough for a meal. I was excited when I saw Blue Barns' menu because it was all very health forward. I decided to get a quinoa bowl, adding salmon and avocado. You get to fill out your own card saying what kind of protein, base, and what vegetables you like to add. I believe I paid about $16 for my bowl, which isn't bad considering I ordered salmon and added avocado along with a few other extra vegetables. It took about 15 to 20 minutes to come out. There is indoor and outdoor seating and available parking in the parking lot outside of the Plaza. They serve you in a very cute Chinese takeout style box if you get your food to go. I ended up eating half of my meal outside and saved the other half for later. The portions are huge and if you get the quinoa bowl, you could probably make two meals out of it. Overall, I wish there was a Blue Barn closer to me because I really enjoyed the food here.", "author": "Addy G."}

Fortunately I was attending an event at Fort Mason, so it was the perfect opportunity to rendezvous with Nina Y. and catch up. We were deciding between eating a salad or Italian food. I wanted something more on the refreshing side, so Blue Barn it was.\n\nFrom the moment you walk in, it's clear this is more of a to-go place, though I hear there's another Blue Barn location down the street that's less so. At any rate, I was able to snag some seats at the communal barstools while waiting for Nina. Ordering was pretty quick after that. I got their spicy tuna salad, which was massive! Ingredients include mixed greens, chicory chop, spicy ahi tuna, avocado, mango, snow peas, cucumber, scallions, sesame seeds, soba noodles & miso-ginger vinaigrette. WOW.\n\nThe salad was a bit pricey ($16.75) but you definitely get what you pay for. It's rare I'm unable to finish a salad because of how light it's supposed to be, but the to-go box was dauntingly large. An observation, not a complaint, of course. It also had a good amount of dressing, though I wish I had asked for more.\n\nGood place to stop by if you're looking for a quick bite to eat or need something for the road. Though it can get pretty crowded, it seems like more people leave with their food than sit and eat, so there's a high probability you'll find somewhere to sit if you decide to dine in.

I rarely ate raw vegetables growing up, so salad is not in my repertoire of food and I usually don't venture out to this area of San Francisco. Blue Barn Gourmet though can probably convert those who do not like salad into salad eaters. Note, this Blue Barn Gourmet is not the one I went to, rather, there is a walk-in store right around the corner that has more of a \"To-Go\" kind of style and only serves salad. \n\nSALAD: Fattoush + Chicken. That champagne-sumac vinaigrette I tell you. There's something about it that makes it so tasty and it's the right amount they give you to perfectly season the whole thing. The nicoise olives add the perfect saltiness with the feta chese and then they put in the pita chips inside to give it that additional crunch that is not quite the same as the romaine. Somehow, all of that comes together in a salad that is actually filling, tasty, and makes me want to eat more. \n\nSERVICE: It isn't a sit-down full service kind of place, but the people were nice inside. \n\nOverall, Blue Barn Gourmet is one of those you only go once in a while to treat yourself to saying, \"hey, I deserve a salad meant to be eaten by humans that tastes great\".

The masala chicken won hands down in my opinion. It had an excellent curry flavor, but was not overwhelming. It was also stacked nice and high and served on a hearty slice of wheat which made for a very substantial bite. The popper on the other hand looked pretty small. It featured pepper jack cheese and goat cheese with a slice of bacon and some pepperoncini. The pepper jack definitely provided the nice little kick. But as a redeeming factor, the sandwich was delivered piping hot so the cheese was all nice and gooey - yum!\n\nSpace is limited to say the least inside Blue Barn but we were able to snag a couple stools on the bar. It was definitely cramped though so it's probably not the place to sit and draw out a lunch. \n\nMy friend and I still did though and spent nearly an hour here eating and catching up on a bustling Sunday afternoon.

Masala was light and refreshing with bean sprouts as an unexpected but welcome touch. The soup was good: creamy, heavy with just right croutons but a bit too sour.\n\nOverall this place offers a decent experience.

It's with the staff and the staffing. \n\nI will not be going back to the Blue Barn, either the one on Chestnut or the one on Polk. The staff on Chestnut always seem to be having a bad day. I don't know if they're overworked or underpaid or both, but most of the time they are short with the customers and often times they are downright rude.\n\nI tried to call in an order for pickup and they simply didn't answer the phone. For the better part of an hour at least. I would just have assumed it was a busy weekend, but then I checked the reviews here on Yelp and see it's a common complaint. If it's your practice to not accept pickup orders when it's busy, say that on your website. Don't leave your customer to figure out whether they've dialed the wrong number or if your phone is out of order.\n\nFailing to get an answer at the Chestnut location I called the one on Polk. The phone was answered right away. I said I wanted to order for pickup and the man who answered said he'd be right with me. And then I was disconnected.\n\nKeep in mind that as your customer, one who loves your food, my choice was not whether to walk over and place an order in person or to wait to order on a day when your staff wasn't overwhelmed. It was whether to keep banging my head on the same wall or find another restaurant that doesn't have the same issues.\n\nI ordered from The Grove on Fillmore. Which also has outstanding food.

Also before anything else, if you're a Blue Bottle fan, they sell their boxed coffee here! \n\nToday I got Rooster sandwich and Provo melt!\nRooster (as it sounds) is grilled chicken with melted white cheddar and avocado, and etc for $12.50.\nIt was good, not great though. Their chicken lacks a little seasoning. I was a little disappointed because I paid slightly more for a sandwich.\n\nOn the other hand, their provo melt for $11.75 was definitely worth getting. It's almost like turkey panini pressed but melts style. Their bread was tucked in greasy butter, and this might sound not appealing but God can tell you how good this rich buttery goodness this melt was! So definitely order this if you're feeling bready!\n\nSmall restaurant, can get pretty crowded during peak hours. Otherwise, its a really chill place for lunch!\n\nCheers!", "author": "Inge C."}

Anyways, the salad consists of mixed greens tossed with mango cubes, cucumber, scallions, peas, sesame seeds, crunchy dried soba noodles, topped with a fair portion of \"spicy\" ahi tuna and half an avocado with miso-ginger vinaigrette.

While a bit small, the cute and cozy decor in the restaurant makes you feel like you're actually in some sort of a modernized barn. I really like how all salad ingredients are presented out in the open for you to see- which can be a testament as to how fresh their ingredients are. If you order a salad to-go, they provide you a cute chinese take out box to eat your salad. They have a large range of salad dressings to try, including the acai-lemon 'master cleanse' vinaigrette, which is my favorite. \n\nOut of the sandwiches, I've only had the buffalo blue so far and I looooovee it. The chicken is well marinated with a spicy kick of buffalo sauce. If it gets too spicy, you can dip the sandwich in a blue cheese dressing. Tastes just like buffalo wings. YUM! \n\nOne thing to note is that since this is a small space, it is very noticeable when it gets packed. I've found that in the times that I've come here, some of the waitresses are too busy to notice you and service may take a little longer than what you may want. \nThe salads and sandwiches may be a bit pricier than most people (AKA, me) like but I suppose for such good quality ingredients in a prime location on Chestnut street, it works out.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

For my boyfriend who always used to ask for seconds as a child, it's not enough food. For a petite Asian female like myself, I consider their portions a full lunch.\n\nOn to the quality of the food - delicious salads. I ordered the Spicy Tuna salad and it blew me away. Light dressing didn't overpower the greens. Ample slices of fresh, fatty tuna lie on top of greens, mango (yum), avocado (yum), and soba noodles. The flavors and textures complemented each other and I was glad I ordered it.\n\nThe Ragin' Cajun sandwich on the other hand - not impressive. The ciabatta roll was hard as rocks and a lot of bread, little in between. Dry and boring.\n\nThe menu is overpriced. What's the most you've paid for grilled cheese? 6? 7? At BBG it's 9.25. Organic and slow food obviously have higher price points, but it should also be balanced with affordability. I guess when consumers are willing to meet that price point it's not such a big deal. But to me it's not worth it.\n\nIt's definitely more of a to-go place - the interior space is small and the line takes up half of it. The outside has all but 3 small tables.

And while I'm at it, for such exorbitant, inflated salad prices they could really have a better ingredient to greens ratio - if more than half of the bites I take are just lettuce with dressing, I am not getting my money's worth.", "author": "Krissi P."}

My husband and I eat a vegan diet (with the exception of fish every once in a while) so, wherever there's a  large fresh bowl of organic salad - we're there. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded absolutely amazing that we ordered a few items to share. Those items were: the spicy tuna salad, the detox salad and the falafel sandwich. As hungry as we were, we had an extremely hard time finishing off that delicious masterpiece of a falafel sandwich after conquering our giant bowls fresh veggies. The spicy tuna salad was unlike any other salad that I have ever tasted. They give you a hefty amount of ahi tuna, avocado, mangos and greens that you would think it cost much more than $12!\n\nI highly, highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of getting lots of fresh food for their money and enjoy to nom away in a cozy and clean environment.", "author": "Melissa L."}

My most favorite salad in the whole city!!!  \n\nBlue Barn is the real deal.  They've got the cutest entrance, the outside actually looks like a barn.  The ingredients they use are absolutely scrumptious!  They even do a weekly product box, which is probably really solid.\n\nEvery time I go here I get the exact same thing... The detox salad with almonds instead of quinoa, oranges instead of cranberries, and add tofu.  Yum.  Delicious salad perfection.  I love that they use a ton of ingredients (11 total) so this salad would be tiresome to replicate at home.  Also the dressing is so tasty and wonderful! And they never put on too much, just the right amount.\n\nBrings me to my next point on Blue Barn, they ALWAYS get my order right.  Even though I custom order (dangerous thing to do at some restaurant, I'm looking at you The Grove).  The quality of the salad, and the amount of salad dressing they use is ALWAYS consistent.  Perfection.  They have their kitchen system down to a fine art.\n\nFinally, the only reason I don't give more stars is because they don't have nearly enough seating area.  It's always jam packed, so I pretty much always have to get my food to go.  They are opening a new location on Polk though,  so fingers crossed that that one will be more spacious!", "author": "Evelyn N."}

I might ask for a little bit of the garlic aioli to give it a little more flavor but everything was fresh and healthy.\n- Beets and Greens salad - This was a solid standard beet salad. A bit heavy on the dressing and a hefty serving. \n- Truffle sando - This might have been my favorite. They give a good amount of meat so it's filling and the garlic aioli is awesome.\n- French fries - They are yummy and salty.\n- Rooster and Hen sandos - Highly enjoyed by friends but I didn't get to try them.\n\nThe food was fresh, properly portioned and came out pretty quickly.

Gross I know, but what happened after was even more appalling. \n\nThe surly snot-nosed girl at the front took five minutes to come over and when she did and saw the beetle, she just ran away with a little squeek for someone in the back, which we thought would be a manager.  Nope, a chef came out and took the plate away...another 5 minutes passed and no one has said sorry or come and spoken to us, finally the same insconsiderate idiot that jumped back, came and said that she could offer me a free side salad for the NEXT TIME I CAME IN!!  Obviously this was absurd and I had to ask for the manager, still no apology at this point.\n\nTen minutes after that, the manager comes down and barely says sorry and after yelling and begging, she said she can only get my meal refunded when my three friends are sitting there with salads in front of them that could easily be beetle, cockroach or god knows what ridden.  Obviously, they did not eat, I did not eat and she only refunded the one of our meals and we did not ever receive an apology.\n\nThese pretentious pricks here think they can charge $15 for a basic salad and not treat people with respect because they are in the marina and there are thousands of girls with hefty plastic cards looking for a low-carb meal.

I had an order of several items for a business meeting and I called Blue Barn last week to find out how to best go about the ordering.  I was told they open at 11 and I should simply call in 20 minutes prior to pickup.  I attempted to call in my order this morning and at first the phone wasn't picked up even though it was after opening hours.  I kept trying and finally somebody picked up the phone, but didn't say anything, and very apparently just set down the handset because I could hear the chatting of the employees in the background.  I said hello several times, but to no avail.  I eventually hung up and tried again and got a busy signal.  I finally decided to drive to the place and put my order in there.  The place was not very busy (yet) and I was helped right away.  I mentioned to the young lady that I had tried to call several times and that evidently the phone had just been put down - seemingly on purpose.  She just said \"I'm so sorry\" with a very fake smile, while she was raising her eyebrow at one of her co-workers because of my comment.  I ended up having to wait almost 30 minutes because of the fact that the staff chose to not pick up the phone at all or just simply set it aside.  The behavior of the young lady was not business like, but rather rude.  No matter how good their food may be, it is not a cheap place to eat and with the attitude I encountered today, I will make sure to give my business to a different establishment next time I have to organize a business lunch.", "author": "Maria R."}

This is, in fact, where they earn there 2 stars. \n\nHowever, that's where it stops. I have been several times over the course of my years living in the area. And, WITHOUT FAIL, I have been disappointed every SINGLE TIME. \n\nIt's like I have a cartoon bubble over my head when I order that says, \"forget this person's order,\" or \"get this person's order wrong,\" or, \"be a complete snot to this person.\" \n\nToday, all 3 -- maybe that's what has convinced me to write this (overdue) review. \n\nI tried BB again, with an open mind, and high hopes that my past experienceS were flukes.  First - I stood there (no line) for about 5 min before someone took my SALAD order. Then, proceeded to watch 4 or 5 people get helped right away after me. I also took note of their orders -- ALL salads. \n\nI waited...and waited...and waited. Still no salad. (How long does a salad take when there was no line?)\n\nThen I proceeded to watch every single person that was in front of me get their orders ahead of me. We all also ordered TO GO. \n\nThere was nothing special in my order that should take extra time. Standard lettuce, veggies, vinagirette -- toss toss toss -- put in to-go container. DONE. Employees finally noticed I was waiting and checked on my order. It hadn't even been started. (see above - \"forget this person's order.\" )\n\nSo, I wait...wait...wait..some more. FINALLY get my order and the employee acts like this is my fault. Gives me some attitude and ends w/ a condescending, \"thanks for waiting\" (see above - \"be a complete snot.\")\n\nGet home. Open my salad box and notice it's wrong -- where is my chicken? where is the manchego? And, why do I have the chipotle vinaigrette (my salad is supposed to have lemon)? (see above \"get this person's order wrong.)\n\nAfter all that...well, you guessed it... I starting yelping. These things may seem little, but really - when you're getting food to-go and have paid a decent price for it, the little things matter. And when they are CONSISTENTLY wrong, it shows a lack of caring and respect for your customers that I just can't appreciate.\n\nSo, that's it BB. I gave you lots of chances. I won't be back.

Blue Barn is one of the best go-to's I've found in the city and if they opened up a second location in Pac Heights, I wouldn't complain...", "author": "Sarah S."}

Well, it's a food that makes you pissed off when you're eating it (http://citymisadventures.wordpress.com/2010/07/23/angry-food-day/).\n\nAfter a sweaty cardio dance class with my friend Jenny, we decided to add \"dinner\" to our post-workout plans, which originally was just \"froyo.\"  Normally I'm not hungry after working out, but I didn't want J to starve, so we headed to Blue Barn in hopes of finding relatively healthy food so as not to completely negate our exercising.\n\nI see Blue Barn as a more yuppie/trendy Pluto's, but at the same time, I haven't been to Pluto's since moving to San Francisco (the one I went to was in Palo Alto).  The inside of Blue Barn is incredibly cute, but it's incredibly cramped.  As rustic and thematic the big communal table is, I think they would best utilize the space if they'd put in a few small tables instead.\n\nThe line is long and doesn't move very quickly, and there were lots of people sitting and standing around waiting for their order around 7:30 PM on a Wednesday.  Maybe it was because it was the first warm day of the year?\n\nI decided on the Detox salad ($9.25) because I wasn't hungry, and I felt like being moderately healthy so I could gorge on froyo later.  Despite not liking salad, I had to admit this was pretty good, not because I like shoveling leaves into my mouth, but because the red quinoa made for an interesting texture.  I also liked the slices of green apple, but the radish and scallions (or some other sort of onion) overpowered everything else.  Overall it was a good, light, refreshing option.\n\nAs a future resident of the area (for those of you who've read my review of my current residence, you'll know that I'm incredibly excited to get out of here next month), I'm glad to know that I've already found a go-to spot for healthy eating.", "author": "Tori S."}

The menu items are all AMAZING and they have unending selections of salads, sandwiches, grilled cheeses, and if that's not enough for you, there is a build-your-own salad bar. Really good quality ingredients - niman ranch bacon, cage free eggs, organic everything (including tofu!) AND the best discovery I just made: They have Blue Bottle coffee!!!! You order at the counter, give them your name, and if you are seated outside or at one of the tables inside, they will bring the food to you.\n\nOne should know that It is more of a quick take-out or stop-and-go sandwich joint, due to the limited seating. I love their new extended summer hours (open until 9pm), and how healthy their menu items are, BUT at the same time, they make everything so tasty! Their secret? They use great dressings (all organic, even their ketchup!), and sauces, but they do a lighter approach, so it doesn't give you a  heart attack. The salads are all dinner salad-sized - so you certainly have enough for more than one person. Soups change on a seasonal/daily basis. \n\nThere is always a line out the door - given the quality of their food, the affordability, and the plethora of choices - so be prepared for a wait if you come on a nice day or during a popular lunch/dinner hour.  They are a small but quaint joint. Even non-salad eaters can be tricked into liking salads from here! Can't wait to try the grilled cheese next time!", "author": "Tammy H."}

The bread was lightly toasted, so that was a nice contrast with the soft, creaminess of the egg salad. I also liked how they put a little bit of egg salad on both slices on bread, then all the other stuff in the middle, instead of putting a huge glob of egg salad on one side because that usually results in spillage & a mess.\n\nGood variety of salads, sammies, and best of all: grilled cheese sammies!!!

Order at the counter - make your own salad ($8.50, includes 6 toppings), choose one of their salads ($8 - 11), sandwiches ($7 - 9) or soups. They also sell drinks, cookies, and chips.  The takeout boxes are so cute (like Chinese takeout boxes).  \n\nI had the Chinese chicken salad ($9.50).  It's a pretty salad with plenty of variety; they cut and julienne the carrots, crunchy soba noodles, almonds, scallions and romaine lettuce into small, even pieces and sprinkled sesame seeds on top.  The extra large, meal sized salad was crispy, crunchy and fresh.  It comes with a small piece of foccacia.  I didn't like the sweet and sour vinaigrette dressing though - it was too sweet (tasted like sweet hoisin sauce).  I wanted something more sour, light, and tangy.  The chicken was dry.  I think it would have been better with red onions, cilantro and a different dressing.  \n\nSeating is limited and you may have to share the large communal table.  It does look like a barn inside with exposed beans and blue walls but in a rustic, charming way vs. a dirty, farm animal way.\n\nIf I found a dressing that I like, I'd give it four stars.  \n\nP.S.

I attempted to call back for the next 20 minutes either the phone would just ring or go to a busy signal. I finally attempted to call from my cell phone which was answered immediately.

I trust her taste in food and we headed to the Marina.\n\nWe ordered a salad and a sandwich, and shared  the food.  For the salad, we ordered the Nicoise - - it was fresh, tasty with JUST enough dressing for taste, and even had artichoke hearts and potatoes!  Delicious!!\nFor the sandwich, we shared a provolone turkey.\n\nHOLY SMOKES that was one fine sammich.... with toasted bread and a slight amount of butter..... beautifully melted cheese with thin but abundant slices of turkey....fresh tomatoes and the works.  The only thing I'd have liked to have is some sliced fresh jalapenos, and it'd be a meal of the gods.\n\nOverall - the reason Intermezzo remains on the list is because it's healthier and cheaper.

Oh. My. Goodness. That's the Marina for you!! Pretty much only one guy was eating a sandwich...with fries!! Gasp.\n\nI ended up following my heart and stomach and ordered the \"Rooster\" sandwich which was...DELICIOUS. Usually I'm a little apprehensive about shelling out money for sandwiches considering I could probably make most of them given the right ingredients. This one I could definitely not duplicate! There was this amazing sauce going on and the chicken was delicious! Throw in the extra bit of avo and a $2 side of fries and I was HOOKED!! \n\nThe bf ordered the \"Skirt\" sandwich which was a little lighter on the sauce with a deliciously cooked steak sandwiched between ciabatta. The dijon mustard and arugula gave it a good kick and it seemed to be a pretty good choice too. I hate it when I have a bite of someone else's food only to discover that it's better than mine but am happy to announce that at this particular meal, this was not the case - the Rooster ruled!\n\nWith delicious food, a super relaxing ambiance (not to mention beautiful weather) and an incredibly nice staff (I'm serious!!

Last Saturday I was extremely disappointed by the service. The guy and the girl at the cashier were paying no attention to what was going on around them and were mostly busy chatting and joking around. I placed my order (a sandwich and a salad) and waited inside the shop. The guy passed by me a number of times so he should have noticed I was there for a while. I waited patiently since I know the food usually takes a while (10-15 min). No one ever called my name when my order was ready. 30+ minutes in, after noticing that people who ordered after me were receiving their food, I walked up to the girl and asked if my food was ready. It turned out my sandwich and salad have been sitting there for a while. Sandwich was cold. Worst of all was her reaction - she was distracted, rude and did not even try to apologize. It looked like working with customers was the last thing she wanted to do.  Very poor experience.", "author": "I T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-07-20", "description": "Once upon a time I loved this place but the service and quality has just taken such a dive I feel I need to modify my previous review.  My frustration has been building for some time now (I've been a regular since they opened) but as organic farm fresh take out is limited I have continued dining here and have bitten my tongue but I just cannot do it any longer.   \n\nThe short version:\nFood: 4 stars\nPrice: 3 stars\nConsistency: 2 stars\nCustomer Service: 0 stars! \n\nThe longer version: \n\nThe food is good because it's fresh and it's local.  Sadly, if you are ordering take-out, odds of you receiving everything you order are a crap-shoot and odds of the workers to give a hoot are even slimmer.  We get take out from here about once a week (again, not because we like patronizing them, but we like buying organic and don't always have time to cook) and frequently u-pick salads are missing an item, or it's the wrong salad, or they've run out of something major and don't tell us until the last minute.  (Tonight they ran out of salad. HA! Seriously, greens, the salad place ran out of mixed greens.  It's almost funny.)  What get's me is not that they ran out, but that when we went to pick up our order they were rather matter of fact, like it was no big deal that we came to pick up an order that doesn't exist.  An sincere apology for the inconvenience would've been better customer service in my opinion.  However, this is small potatoes compared to previous bad customer service experiences we've had in the past so here are a few of them finally written up.  I should've done this a long time ago.  \n\n\n3 big ones.\n\n1: Recently my mother-in-law was visiting to help with our new baby and she went to pick up some food for us.  I wrote an order down for her to bring (as no one was answering the phone after several attempts at calling) and when she tried to hand them the order, written on paper, they told her she needed  to fill out the paper provided by them.  She explained to them that she didn't have her glasses with her (she's 70 with bad eyes) and asked if they could fill it out for her and they said they were sorry she needed to fill it out.  She had to have another patron in the restaurant fill it out for her and when she turned it in, the cashier snidely thanked her for filling it out (as though she was capable from the get-go and decided to follow directions) upon which my mother-in-law said, \"I didn't, like I said, I couldn't. I had to have another customer do it for me!\"  \nSeriously Blue Barn, you couldn't even help an old lady fill out an order form? A form that you're just going to input into a computer anyway?!? That was already on paper?! I'm mad that I ever went back to you after this! Shame on me for not taking the time to complain then.  If not for being overwhelmed with a new baby I certainly would have.\n\n2.  While I was pregnant (7-8 months ago) I came in when it was not busy (I would not ask for modifications during rush hour, I know better) and asked for a sandwich I routinely get but asked them if they could heat up the meat because I was pregnant and couldn't have deli meat unless it had been heated.  They said they were sorry they couldn't make modifications even for health purposes.  I said I'd be thrilled if they could just throw it on the grill or toss it in a microwave ( While I'm not sure they have the latter I know that they have a grill) and they said sorry but no.  I'm just surprised given that I'm a regular, it wasn't busy and they have a grill that they put beef and chicken on they couldn't throw some cold cuts on the grill for me in my current state. Again, they just don't really give a damn about their customers.  \n\n3:Dining in the restaurant once, my friend asked for extra dressing as her salad was done lightly.  As we were sitting in the establishment dining I was very surprised when the girl made us pay for the extra dressing.  I can understand charging if it's take out, but when you're dining in? That's just tacky.  \n\nBlue barn, I'm done giving you money for over priced salads.  Not because of the cost, but because of your inconsistent service and seriously crappy attitude.  You're just not THAT good.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

I'm always looking for a good sandwich/salad place and I really haven't found one yet. The salad here was really bland. The lettuce wasn't very good quality and tasted too \"watery\" and wasn't flavorful (albeit, I know lettuce isn't THAT flavorful, but there was something off). I had the cobb salad, but the whole lettuce thing can apply to all the salads. I also tried the rooster sandwich on recommendation of the person taking my order, but that was just meh too. Good bread, but the sandwich was uninspired and wasn't high quality enough to make up for the lack of creativity.

I work 4 blocks away so I call in and order and then go pick it up. and 2) multiple times when I have ordered the build your own salad I would get like small pieces of something I didnt order.

At the Blue Barn, all the sandwiches are made with love (or at least take long enough to create the illusion of love) and the staff is very attentive and kind.  The list of sandwich options is broad and wide and should have something more most anyone.  From veggie options to delicious chicken (I recommend the Rooster and Kickin' Chicken highly), I don't think there is anything on the menu that has been anything short of fantastic.  The Falafel is great in theory,  however, the bread choice creates an unusual balance that makes the sandwich a bit mushy.  I would recommend getting it with a crunchier bread (or crunchier falafel).\n\nIn addition, the grilled cheese options are quite awesome.  Crunchy, melty, and delicious, they epitomize what a grilled cheese should be.

I debated giving this place two stars, as its food almost serves as its saving grace (in the 3-4 star range), however, after further consideration, one star seemed more valid as I will never return to this place.  \n\nBack to the point...\n\nProblem #1: this place is setup as if it were going to be fast, however, it is begrudgingly slow!  After a few previous frustrating experiences, I took the liberty of timing them today, and it took no less than 18 minutes from the time I paid at the register until the time my to-go sandwich was ready.  Did they have to kill the chicken in the back?  What are they doing here?  This is what I have found myself asking each of the few times that I have visited this place.  I am ordering a (albeit good) relatively basic chicken sandwich for lunch...what could possibly make it take 18 minutes when the place isn't even that busy?  \n\nProblem #2: I reiterate, everyone there must be taking slow pills, so even when the place is relatively not busy there is always a line of a few people, which will take 5-10 minutes to get through.\n\nProblem #3: While you would think the snail's pace at which the place operates might lead to them being very detail-oriented or having some other redeeming quality, apparently it does not.  They often mess up little things such as today when they forgot to put dressing on my girlfriend's Chinese Chicken Salad...and since it was a to-go order, we didn't realize this until we were home.\n\nGoodbye Blue Barn, and good luck continuing to exemplify an operational disaster.", "author": "Cameron D."}

I arrived 5 minutes after they opened at 11AM and waited 25 minutes to get a simple salad because they had so many phone orders and there were 3 people ahead of me in line. \n\nThere are several girls who work the register and pretty much all but one of them have a major attitude and act like you are bothering them. The woman making the salad never has a smile on her face, looks depressed, and after she makes the salad, while you are there staring at her,  will refuse to actually hand you the salad. Instead, you must wait until the person at the register finishes handling their transactions and phone orders. Then, that person hands you the salad.\n\nI guess they have their rationale as to how they do things, however if it's busy and people are standing around, I feel they should just hand you your food so you can get out of there.\nThe food is healthy and I like their salads, but sometimes this place is ridiculous with the wait, and amount of phone orders.

Rave reviews for both sandwiches.\n\nThe Sheep features an originally Spanish manchego cheese, mild chorizo and fig jam. Dave is going through a fig fetish and loved this--the bread was browned just right and buttery, and the fig jam wasn't too overpowering. I personally felt like I couldn't taste the chorizo enough, but that may just have been my inner Muslim rebel wanting to revel in the explosion of porky sin on my tastebuds.\n\nMoving on to more halal/kosher Semitic delights, the Swiss sandwich was the heartier of the two and included sauteed onions, two types of cheese (Jarlsburg & Gruyere), mustard and pastrami, all adding up to one fierce reuben-evocative sandwich. It also went better with the tomato soup, which we both ordered.\n\nMy favorite part of the soup was the crunch of the green spring onion that was cut up into it--and not just as garnish either, it was more part of the dish. Although we took our food to go down to the Marina, the soup was lukewarm at best. Says Dave:\n\n\"while i am not particularly intimately familiar with the thermodynamics of tomato soup, i submit that either tomato soup has a generally flakey specific heat or the original temperature simply wasn't that hot\"\n\nAlso lukewarm: the staff. I agree with other reviewers on their service critique, but I thought there was something refreshing about a California barn employee that didn't hee and haw at their customers.", "author": "Liane G."}

After getting parking easily and buying candy at the Walgreens, the age old of question of what to do about dinner reared its ugly head.\n\nWhen you're going to a movie, the movie takes priority over a decent meal. And, in the Marina, the food establishments catering to the post-fraternity brother and sorority sister clientele don't really understand this very well. The relaxed pace starts when you stand around waiting to be helped. We've walked out of numerous places.\n\nEnter: the Blue Barn Gourmet\n\nWe'd passed by the place on another movie excursion, but had been packed to the point where we couldn't see what all he hoopla was about. When we passed by a couple of nights ago, we saw a couple of people and some seats. Decided to give it a try after realizing there was something both of us wanted on the menu.\n\nOther Yelpers seems to have had a problem with the service, we couldn't have had a more pleasant experience. The woman at the counter was friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the restaurant and food, so much so we took her as the owner or partner. And, it wasn't only us. She and the woman prepping the salads were nice to the stroller mom and dad who followed us. Nothing but friendly. The next day we came and recognized us, again, welcoming us back.\n\nThe first night I had the Beets & Greens salad. Perfectly roasted beets, goat cheese, caramelized onions, pecans, and delicious lettuces. I tried a bite of the sheep panini: manchego, fig jam, chorizo. The next day we both had salads: Chinese chicken and nicoise salad.\n\nFor all those who think it's pricey, I will agree that it's more expensive than I would like -- especially since free is the starting point of negotiation in my mind. Blue Barn is actually worthy of the expenditure. The salad portions are large. The ingredients are extremely fresh. I like the idea they are sourced locally. It's still a better deal than many places in terms of the cost-value price relationship.\n\nSpecial notes: you will run into Marina people here. If you like them, great. They are everywhere. If you're not so thrilled about the self-obsessed set, you might want to get take out. The place is small with only a dozen or so seats. You'll definitely have to bear them.\n\nSome warm weekend (chant with me: rain, rain, go away, come back during a work day), we have plans to grab it to go and head to the Marina green and have a picnic.\n\nTo sum up, terrific friendly service, delicious food, and a great little business that I hope continues to thrive.", "author": "Dave B."}

My favorite by far is the provo. It's an ewwy gooey mess that's perfectly toasted and paired with arugula, tomatoes, turkey, and some kind of delicious aioli. The fries are amazing!\n\nThe venue itself I don't care for much - it's cramped and small and they try to make it look like a 'blue barn' but I'd say they failed miserably. \n\nMy least favorite part is the service - a good sandwich takes time to make so that I won't complain about. A smile would be nice - I've never gotten it. I don't need small talk - I get it - you're busy. But I'd at least like to feel welcomed or something?! \n\nLast time we asked about the bathroom and a girl stated that they didn't have one. I said really - then where do you go? She then clarified a public one with such attitude. Okay smartass! She then went on to say since they are considered a take out place they don't have to provide a restroom. Starbucks is across the street she said.\n\nThere is seating outdoors and inside. Yeah you can't seat a lot of people, but can't really call yourselves \"to go\" when you have people eating there and you ask them for here or to go.\n\nRegardless, their stuff is good.

Anyway, we both had the burrata grilled cheese and my hubby had a cup of potato soup. Well, I found the sandwich disappointing. It wasn't hot, and the cheese was so watery it was more the consistency of melted mayonnaise than cheese. Maybe burrata isn't good for melting? I thought it was like mozzarella, though...there wasn't a lot of it either. My husband liked it more than me but maybe that's because he was dipping it in the soup? After finishing the panini and heading down chestnut street, I ended up having to order some more food elsewhere as the sandwich was not filling at all. Too bad.

Pretty impressive.\n\nHowever, you can tell that they don't yet have the manpower to cater to such a big demand. We had to wait quite awhile for our sandwiches while doing the mamba with incoming/outgoing customers in their cramped space.\n\nThe employees there are very amicable, with great attitudes and lots of smiles. The inside actually feels a little barn-like, but not necessarily in a good way. It was dark & drafty, which could be remedied by... turning on the lights! Maybe this is a kink they still need to work out, but I swear I saw lights installed, just not on.\n\nI tried their Hen sandwich which is citrus-herb-roasted chicken, crispy prosciutto, sharp provolone, tomatoes, arugula, avocado, thyme aioli, & honey mustard on sourdough bread. (*phew* That was a mouthful.) It's a little pricey at $8.50 a pop, but it has \"Gourmet\" in its name, so it's expected. It was savory, but the mustard was a little overpowering. The pressed sourdough bread was a nice touch though. Oh and they included a piece of old style bubble gum in my friend's sandwich. What a cute idea! But hey! Where was mine?\n\nOverall, the place is a pretty Marina, frou frou kinda place with high end drinks, salads, cheeses, crackers, and sandwiches. Their create-your-own salads sound veeery tempting. You get to select 6 toppings, which includes a variety of gourmet fixings like sun-dried tomatoes, candied pecans, pomegranates, ricotta salata cheese, soba noodles, etc. Even the dressing choices are fancy: chipotle agave, lemongrass nuoc cham, champagne-saffron vinaigrette, roasted red pepper caesar. YUM-O. I'll be swingin' by again to get a fancy pants salad and maybe a side of their tantalizing Rustic Potato Salad. I just hope I don't have to wait too long.\n\nSidenotes:\n\n-This place really isn't designed for you to eat at, seeing as how they have only 2 little tables.

HUGE and 2. they had a veritable smorgasboard of incredible-looking fresh veggies and mix-ins.

I've definitely been missing out! Everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious so I had a really hard time choosing. I finally decided upon a chicken sandwich with some sort of bbq sauce and slaw and it was so so so good! I can't wait to go back and try more of their sandwiches and salads!\n\nService was very friendly and the interior is beyond cute but the limited seating puts a damper on things and the prices are a little high for sandwiches/salads - hence four stars instead of five.

The staff is polite and wecoming and it appears that the other customers follow suit (all the people sitting near me or in line have always been courteous and polite although, obviously, this might not be everyone's experience).  The most important thing, though, is the salads are absolutely wonderful. They have great ideas or you can create your own.  The salad comes in a  big bowl and if you want, it is already tossed with the salad dressing.  In so many other restuarants, I am often tossing a salad on a  plate with the ingredients falling all over the table (I don't get it....why some basic things other restuarants don't seem to see?).

Great location if you're already in the Marina and when I went on a weekday afternoon there was plenty of room to sit.\n\nCoupla cons (there are always cons even in the best of places):\n\n1. The woman who took my order was a bit snappish (actually downright surly) and wouldn't break a smile even when I made a joke. Now that could have something to do with my joke - but all the same, not the energy I was looking for on my first visit! \n2. My salad with a small Pelegrino came to nearly $18. That's pretty zesty in this economy.

My wife and I went in there shortly after it opened last year. We waited an extremely long time for our food and felt increasingly crowded as more and more people entered the tiny shop to order. We wanted to sit down and eat but there were only 4 seats in the whole place so we got the food to go and were generally unhappy with the experience (though the sandwiches we got were fine if a little pricey). \n\nWe recently returned about a week ago to try it again and noticed that BB had made some improvements. They had removed a huge display case that took up about 30-40 square feet of the interior space, replacing it with a long bar with 8 stools that effectively tripled the indoor seating capacity. Our sandwich and salad still took a few more minutes than we would prefer to get but not the 20 minutes we waited the first time.\n\nA note on the food: I've eaten the tuna sandwich there both times and it was good. My wife did not like the turkey sandwich she had the first time but really liked the Chicken salad she got the 2nd time. As for prices, the food is a little pricey (if I remember right I think the tuna sandwich was $8-9 and the salad about the same). If you want salad it's a much better deal at Pluto's on Scott st nearby.\n\nI should also note that the woman who ran the register on our recent trip (who I think may also be the owner) was extremely friendly.", "author": "Dylan S."}

I am pretty easy to please but one place has crossed the line and that place is Blue Barn. I live in the neighborhood and LOVE their salads (my bf and i go 1-2 times a week) but recently it has really gone downhill and no one there seems to care.  It's like when your parents say they are \"disappointed\" (instead of \"mad\"). I want them to improve so badly. Don't make me go to pluto's.\n\nIssues:\n1) their online menu is so old. They need to update the seasonal salad and also they need to update other stuff like for example the beets and greens salad currently has pomegranate seeds in it instead of blueberries (which is on the menu). If I am ordering on the phone how the heck do I know that it changed? We are in SF, I am sure you can find someone to update your absolutely bare bones website for you\n2) a piece of cardboard (a little bigger than a silver dollar) was in my to-go salad about a month ago. nuff said\n3) did not include a main ingredient in my standard, off the menu to-go salad this past weekend and when I called they apologized and offered to refund (just) the price of that particular ingredient the next time I come to the store. this is not a billing issue. And if i wanted just a bunch of lettuce i would grab some at safeway. I wanted the salad I ordered. Nothing more nothing less.\n4) stop taking advantage of us, blue barn! we love your salads and will probably come back either way BUT.... Hire a few more people and stop making us wait so long! you know when it's busy. Come on... please! \n\nIt's hard when you get a to-go salad and you are all the way home when you realize the problem. Big picture I have a great life, not much to complain about... but this is not big picture this is a review of one business that sells salads and on a purely transactional basis I just want the salad that I ordered!

It is really small inside so be prepared to wait for a table if you come at a peak time.  I ordered the Detox Salad which sounded delicious based on the description on the menu.  I got my salad pretty quickly and right as I was about to take a bite out of a few slices of apple I noticed a bunch of fuzzy mold on them.  I took my salad back to the counter and politely asked if I could get a new salad because there was mold on the apples.  The girl at the counter had a bit of an attitude as she inspected the apples for the mold but they did make me a new salad pretty quickly.  The apples looked mold free so I dug in only to get a huge mouthful of mint!  Maybe I'm in the minority here but I loathe mint, like seriously hate it.  Had mint been listed as one of the ingredients in this salad, I would have asked for no mint or simply not ordered it.  Please advertise your ingredients in the salad!!  Since I had already returned the salad once for my moldy apples, I couldn't bear to ask them to make me a new one without the mint so I sucked it up and ate because I was starving.  The salad overall was lacking flavor and the dressing didn't do much to help it so I probably wouldn't order it again.  My friend's salad looked really yummy and so did her grilled cheese.  We also had french fries that were pretty tasty.  I'll probably come back if I'm in the area and try something new ... they did have several things on their menu that sounded tasty, I'll just stay away from the Detox Salad.", "author": "Ali K."}

Imagine you grew up in a small town where the dating pool was similarly small.  However, luckily for you, there was a fun, cute girl/guy.  That's Plutos.  Plutos is good, reliable, and may not be the flashiest, but you like it and are comfortable with it.  You date off and on for years.  Imagine then that one day a new girl/guy moves to town, from the big city.  She reminds you of Plutos, but she/he is fancier, dresses better, and is more exciting.  That's Blue Barn.  You got out with Blue Barn once, and next thing you know you're spending more time with her/him than with Plutos.  Blue Barn's tastes are more expensive than Plutos, but it's definitely worth it. \n\nIn other words, Blue Barns salads are better than Plutos.  They have far more ingredients and they are tastier ingredients too.  They have better dressings.  Their sandwiches are better too (I like the \"rooster\" and the \"hen\" a lot...just talking about sandwiches) and they have a lot of those, as opposed to the few offered by Plutos.  They don't offer some of the sides that Plutos does, but that's ok.  It is more expensive, and perhaps a bit too much for a sandwich or salad, but so far this hasn't kept me away because they are tasty.  The people that work there are nice.  Besides the prices, my biggest complaint is the lack of seating.

I make this distinction because while I LOVED the beets and greens salad, the Spinach salad was lacking, specifically b/c the blue cheese dressing tasted like watered down yogurt, and blue cheese crumbles and balsamic dressing would have been better (in fact, I confiscated some of my friend's dressing and was MUCH happier). \n\nANYWAY, with 2/3 salads being very good (and the option to tweek and/or create my own) I will definitely be back here to work my way through the menu!", "author": "Hanna L."}

I've walked by numerous times and seen people chowing down on delicious and huge salads. The inside is pretty small and there is one long table and two smaller tables. They also have a few tables outside on Chestnut. You can order salads or sandwiches and they of course have soups. You can also make your own salad. I like the to-go little cartons, they are super cute. Since this was my first time, I ordered the beet salad, which was amazingly delicious when I had it at home awhile later. It had beets, strawberries, candied walnuts, sauteed onions, feta and who knows what else, but all I can say is that it was delicious! Of course with that much cheese it was probably slightly unhealthy, so next time I'm going to ask for less cheese. They give pluto's a good run for their money.", "author": "Natalie S."}

Even the bread was excellent - fresh, crunchy, and of course, the sandwich was served warm. YUM!!!! I went back a couple of days later, and tried the burrata. Again, totally delicious!

It must be me bringing in some luck with these stores ... hehheh... Pretty darn impressive for a place that JUST opened ... everytime i pass by BB, there's always a line out the door ... \n\nAnother deli on Chestnut, woo hoo... A combination of Lucca & Plutos. +1\n\nLucca // Pluto is still on the tops for me. Way better, well I haven't tried the salads yet, so.\n\nThis cute lil wooden shack looking deli is a new spot that seemed to have opened recently. Staff is friendly, willing to give you a sample or two, but you can't beat Lucca on endless and a wide variety of samples...BB's sample consists of their side salad which wasn't all that spectacular, but i give +1for trying.\n\nHave varieties from salad (available from mixed or dry) for $7.50 to Chef specialty salads($8-15) to sandwiches and paninis... you get to pick and choose your own salad in the back, kinda like the Pluto concept or they already a few for you to pick and choose from.\n\nI decided to go for their BUDDDHA, sandos from the kitchen, and for $8.. lemme give you some useful pointers, my friend ... I have to say\n\n1. $8 was so not worth it. basically, a normal looking sandwich for $8. woohoo. Note the sarcasm, thanks! -1 \n2. AND Yes, you are prolly paying a portion of their rent...\n3. Repeat #1 & #2. \n\nWhat is Buddha? Imagine a glop of hummus, red pepper, onions, cucumbers, watercress, roasted portbellos and feta on toasted whole wheat... didn't taste no hummus. AT ALL! -1 well, I did, but I expected some huge chunk, and hummus goes better with pita, not toasted wheat. Perhaps if they had more cucumbers, and in big pieces, like the ones you put over your eyes for an eyepack ... they were diced up into eety bity quarter sizes ... again, that's just me.\n\nLimited seatings, you can only fit 6 people, which faces the infamous Chestnut street. Uh... you either have a cafe style concept seating at least 15 or keep it small and cozy.. iono... sry folks, im in the mood of  \"this and that\" \n\n\nill say it again, and again, but it was just too tiny. yea, its worth another look, but not anytime soon.\n\n\nTIP: Closed Tuesdays, but opened other days 'til 9pm. +1", "author": "Jennifer S."}

She had asked me to picked it up for her four times now.Two of those time they forgot the dressing. I know the first time I went in was a bit busy and hectic so I don't blame them and neither does my boss's boss. But the second time I made sure I went in early and I made sure I ordered everything correctly. Well they forgot it again and I am embarrass to say that if you can not remember easiest thing like salad dressing then what  else will you forget next time? My boss's boss just got so pissed off at them and at me on the same wagon. Why is it my job to have to remind them to check on salad dressing?Well sorry to say that they just lost their biggest client they could of have cuz they were talking about having this place cater their next staff luncheon.", "author": "S F."}

The place is small and is located in a very busy street, parking was stressful. Their menu choice is pretty decent. You can either choose the menu salads they have or make your own for $9. They have a wide selection of salads, dressings and toppings to add to your salad. If you want a fast lunch on the go don't come here unless you call ahead. My friends and I waited for about 30 minutes for our salads the first time but once we called ahead for the order it was quicker. I recommend the hearts of romaine with the garlic caesar dressing. \nThe first time I went my salad was ruined because instead of white cheddar cheese they added blue cheese which I find disgusting. But the second time I got exactly everything I asked for and the salad tasted great. They also have options of adding sirloin steak, chicken or grilled shrimp to your salad. I recommend this place for those of you who love salads and like to make your own.", "author": "Shirley E."}

The sandwich was heavy on the turkey and light on the lettuce and tomato.  You've also got to love cheese with your sandwiches, which I don't.  $8 was a bit steep for a veggie depraved sandwich in my opinion, though the Blue Bottle coffee was good and strong.  \nI liked the way they designed the space to be barn-like.  I also liked the long high table on the left as you enter.  It appeared conducive to conversation with neighborhood folk while one waits for their sandwich to be produced.  There was a bit of a wait for this, and my friend's sandwich was even later in coming.  I thought they has forgotten his order, actually.  It did eventually appear.\nThis spot is definitely geared toward take-out, as people point out here.  The staff were sociable, attractive, and friendly.  I liked that they called your order out by name.  Also, the bazooka gum packed inside of the sandwich wrapping was an unexpected and nostalgic touch.", "author": "Roland C."}

Each and every sandwich at Blue Barn is a home run, chock full of the highest quality local, organic ingredients and executed with care (down to the Bazooka gum and napkins neatly tucked into the paper wrapping). I especially appreciate Blue Barn's approach to sandwich composition -- they riff on classic combinations (turkey and cheese becomes roast turkey with goat cheese and sundried tomatoes) but without getting too fancy pants or overdoing the number of ingredients. Yes, Blue Barn is a little pricey at $7.50-9 per sandwich, but the portions are hearty and you are clearly paying for ingredient quality.

At the time we decided not to review the place b/c we were also hoping to have some Blue Bottle coffee which they couldn't serve yet b/c they didn't have their machine. So, we got our sandwiches (he had tuna and I had manchego and pancetta) and went to Peet's for coffee instead. The sandwiches were okay, my hubby was kinda sad that he didn't get a piece of Bazooka Bubble Gum wrapped along with his sandwich. But with or without the gum, the sandwiches were just okay, too pricey for what we were expecting - they were kinda smallish. Anyhoos, we went back and although this time we didn't get food, we did finally get Blue Bottle coffee. And though it took a while, there was just one girl in the front, and there weren't any fancy leaf designs in my hubby's cappuccino or my latte, it was still a pretty good cup of Blue Bottle coffee.

I work in retail right down the street, so when I make it in to Blue Barn I usually order their turkey sandwich, which is one of the best I've ever had....they have some special sauce they put on it or something that makes it ridiculously incredible!  Their salads are also a little expensive but super, super delicious....and the portion they give you is so big you can have it for the next 3 meals.  The staff there is also really nice and there is plenty of seating to enjoy the nice Marina sunshine outside...although they do get pretty packed around lunch time during the week.", "author": "Isaac W."}

This is so much better than Pluto's, except their pricing is a little bit on the high side. Staff is much friendlier than Pluto's too, which makes it the ideal neighborhood grub hub. One thing I should mention, they don't have many seats available, so on busy rush hours, better get it To Go.", "author": "Chanli S."}

There isn't much seating room here, so my friends and I often take our food to go. I am not a big \"meat\" eater and this place has so many vegetarian choices! Some of my favorite choices include the burrata sandwich, the buddha sandwich, and the fattoush salad.", "author": "Sarah R."}

Blue Barn has things like apples, pears, greap fruit, spicy agave chili dressing, and other cool additions that you can put in your salad. It's expensive, but like I said, all i really want in life...", "author": "R M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-15", "description": "Good paninis and salads.  Really fresh ingredients.  I had their wakame salad and added chicken.  It was a big bowl - didn't know how I'd finish it but I managed to!  My friend got the mozarella/tomato panini and it was really good.  We also got a side of fries (kind of defeats the healthy purpose) but they weren't too greasy and very tasty.  They were the \"frites\" style, thin and crispy.  I definitely want to go back and try their other salads, particularly their chinese chicken.  It's small in there but cozy.  Can't be afraid of other's listening in to your convo!  Oh, and did I mention they serve blue bottle coffee?", "author": "Ming Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-10-24", "description": "The Rooster sandwich I had was pretty tasty, yes, but the service was VERY slow (20 mins to get a sandwich?) This only exacerbated the problem of being tortured by the sound of schmaltzy Jack Johnson music they had playing--on and on and on--an entire album of this crap? Stick to good service and good food so people aren't waiting in a crammed area. It would also help to ask the mothers to wait outside with their double-wide strollers.", "author": "Brad T."}

I love the feel when you walk through the doors, I never knew a salad could taste so good, and the people that work there are so friendly! What more could you ask for??", "author": "Hallie P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-07-29", "description": "The food, although delicious, was tasty because of how greasy and fatty it was.  There were no real alternatives that both tasted good AND were good for you.  I would normally give a place like this 4 stars because it's not like I didn't know it was going to be unhealthy.  I gave it 3 stars instead because of the customers.  The group of people in there when I went are the types of people that give Marina residents a bad reputation.  Unfortunately, the restaurant can't do anything about the customers who come in.", "author": "Josh C."}
