It's an uphill battle for me to get here, like literally, I have to walk half a mile up hill but it's worth it. The staff is super friendly and helpful.\n\nThe food tastes great especially if you like Italian delis. If you don't, then I don't know why you're reading reviews for an Italian deli. My only gripe is that I am no bread expert and spotting breads from the breadbox is pretty tough for me. The only bread I can tell from sight is dutch crunch but they never seem to have it when I get there. Also, the seating is limited so I always have to grab it to go. If I'm ordering for a friend, I think it's weird I have to hold their bread. \n\nI haven't bought anything other than a sandwich but the selection of cheeses, meats, and wines is pretty solid.", "author": "Larsen R."}

It's one of two spots in San Francisco where you can get a great Italian cold cut sando and pack your bag with other goodies from the store. My other favorite, Lucca on chestnut. Honestly, it's a tie for who's better in my book. I digress...\n\nOrdering Molinari is best done via the yelp app because you never know what the lines are going to be like at this institution. This past week I grabbed a cold cut sandwich to go and spent a glorious Indian summer day eating in Washington square park. Could I get more Sf? Don't think so. \n\nThe sandwich was packed with all kinds of great meats a little lettuce, tomato and mustard. My only complaint is the French roll is terribly difficult to eat. It's tough and by the end of the monster sandwich, your jaw is a bit tired. Get it with a different bread like foccica and you'll be stoked!", "author": "Benjamin F."}

Their deli meats are sold in most grocery stores now.  Ohh the sandwiches are delicious...true great quality sliced deli meats and local fresh baked bread/rolls. Cute store setup with an old fashion turn of the century SF Italian shop look with other staples like olive oil, vinegars, cookies...\n\nIt was crazy busy on a Saturday afternoon. The tiny deli was packed with wall to wall folks. Do yourself a favor and grab a pull number right when you step in. We pulled #9 (109) and they were serving # 90.so be patient. You have to wait for your number to be called to make a purchase. That includes ordering a sandwich, ordering sliced meats, and  buying any shelf items. \n\nIf you order a sandwich....things to know...the sandwich menu is towards the back of the shop. Muscle your way back there through the crowds of already waiting folks. Also grab, with tongs, your choice of sandwich bread from the big ole bread box. Once your number is called out, hand over your bread to the folks over the counter and tell them what sandwich you want. Gotta warm you this place gets packed, standing side by side with the masses and your bread clutched in your hand within sneezing distance from everyone. Next time I'll be prepared and bring my own baggie to safeguard my bread. \n\nThey have only 2-3 small bistro tables out front. So plan on taking your food to go.", "author": "Lillian W."}

This thing topped out at $11 which is fair and I really didn't know what I was getting into until I sat down at one of the three tables outside and unwrapped the beast. It was piled high with cold cuts and cheese; although I have to admit I do like my meat sliced thinner. Just the right amount of oil and vinegar helped to meld all the flavors together. The bread was the perfect density and the meats were cured extremely well. The provolone added a nice nutty flavor to the sandwich.

When, the deli guy asked the question of toasted before or after, I really had to think about it. I really dont want my sandwich heated up until the meat taste different. The meat and the deli guys reason for the meat being toasted was quit apparent. The meat tasted funny. Like it absorbed all the flavors in the cold case (other meats and foods in the cold case).  The deli guy then pointed to the condiments,  I told him I wanted everything.  Nit a mind reader,  but the regular would be mayo, mustard.  I also told him include the pepperoncinis before we got to the spead condiments. He wraps the sandwich up and asks for payment. Damn it my card really fidnt go through, so I passed him my other card. Signed the receipt and headed back to work. I was so hungry. I opened the sandwich and found that the  sandwich lacked mayo and mustard. The sandwich was 11.50, the deli guy charged me 10.50, which after eye balling my sandwich closely saw the charge was just. Damn!", "author": "La-Rae A."}

The store is old mom & pop and the sandwich counter guy is a sweet smiling guy.  Most of their sandwiches are pricey at $12 but I thought to splurge and got a Luciano sandwich special(Parma prosciutto, sweet coppa, fresh mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, onions with lettuce on grilled focaccia bread). I chose rosemary bread.  The meat was sliced fresh there in front of me.  Service was slow because the shop is small and it's just a mom & pop, but I felt for $14, it was definitely worth it!!   They accept CC.  When I bit into one of the two cuts of the LARGE sandwich, I felt that EXPLOSION of taste from all of the sundried tomatoes and the meat.

If i really want to step back in time, I head into Molinari's where it smells of cured meats, tomato sauce and cheese, it almost sounds the same, except missing is the heavy Sicilian accents. \nThis is one of the last handful of REAL Italian  establishments left.  I miss Vanessi's, Panelli Brother's  and all the Italian bakeries that have sadly closed their doors taking their recipes with them.  Thanks for letting me reminisce, I'll get on with it.  \n\nIf you want a sandwich, grab a number, head over to the bread box and pick out your bread.  I recommend ordering the specialties, say,  for instance,  the Molinari Combo without any changes.  I tastes best with the works, unless you really hate mustard, but I'm just saying that you might end up loving mustard after eating these sandwiches.  You will not find options for pickled kimchi, arugula, essence of aleppo  oil, aged goat cheese in these sandwiches.  Your options are simple, keep it simple and keep the line moving.

Just like a pasta dish is only as good as the noodles and pho is only as good as the broth. You get the picture. \n\nSorry, but as a native San Franciscan, this place is overrated and overhyped....thanks to Bourdain.\n\nOne thing that irked me is that if you order a sandwich, you pick out your roll of choice from a bin. Even though there was one tong, I saw another customer who arrived after me use her hands (no restrooms for customers, no hand sanitizer, no parchment paper available). You know damn well, there be some people who shuffle through the bread bin with their hands looking for the \"best\" looking roll. Let your imagination run wild here as to where those hands have been. I did...hello, snot pickers and snatch/crotch scratchers! I cringed. I used the tongs to dig out the farthest roll from the top....a sourdough roll.\n\nThe owner gentleman was nice (greeted me upon walking in) but the lady who made my sandwich was not. I was obviously a Molinari noob when she instructed me to grab my own bread. I ordered the Renzo Special: proscuitto, coppa (hot or mild), fresh mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes sandwich ($11.50) and she didn't ask me if I wanted hot or mild coppa--she made my sandwich with mild as default: bit.ly/1jyBzao. I wrongly assumed all sandwiches come with the basic trimmings and spreads. They don't, you have to request it. Of course I didn't know this until I unwrapped my sandwich. So make sure to request every ingredient you want in your sandwich (it's otherwise dry)! \n\nAs I've said, a sandwich is only as good as the bread. The [untoasted] sourdough roll was ridiculously hard, stale, and sharp enough to cut the roof your mouth (this was at 11 am). It was so hard that I couldn't even bite into it. I ended up having to break bread like Jesus, except my disciples were hangry pigeons so I can actually eat the sandwich. Had the bread been fresh and higher quality like Acme or Josey Baker, the sandwich would have been excellent. The fresh mozzarella was deliciously creamy and nicely offset the saltiness of the cured meats. The sun-dried tomatoes added a tangy sweetness, though a bit hard.\n\nQuality meat and cheese for sure but that bread doe. Ugh.\n\nThankfully, I still have all my teeth...for now.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Molinari has been in North Beach for a long time, and even though most of their meats are now prepared in a different facility, the owners still maintain the look and feel of a classic Italian deli. They are located on Columbus near the heart of North Beach.\n\nOn a recent food tour, we stopped here for some sandwiches. With all the meat and cheese options, you can quickly get overwhelmed. We had a special sandwich with soppressata, marinated red peppers, fresh mozzarella, and basil spread; it was very delicious and a good place to start. If you do not have a favorite already, browse the reviews for some good suggestions. Otherwise, you can just grab some ingredients and become your own chef at home or the park.\n\nYou can find Molinari salumi all over Northern California, but there is always something special about heading to the source for a real treat.

Knowing that I was returning this week, I made it a point to stop by to pick up some deli meats to make my own sandwich with the sheet of plain focaccia from last week that I froze.  They do sell focaccia at Molinari if you did not have a chance to get it from Liguria.  \n\nSince we came a little earlier before dinner, we did not get a chance to try their sandwiches this time around.  There is a system for sandwiches here where you grab a number, then your French roll which you would then hand to them when your number is called.  We still had to grab a number for the deli and they will freshly slice for you based on what you want.  I got 1/4 lb salami, 1/4 lb mild/sweet coppa, and 1/4 lb mortadella with pistachios.  Other offerings include soppresata, prosciutto (both domestic and di parma), etc..  Since they had a promotion for fresh Italian Sausage, I bought a lb of the links as well which I froze and may be making an appearance soon in a Baked Ziti.  They also sell their Molinari Salami for $8.95 for a small which would be great to go with a hard cheese which they have a huge variety of as well.  \n\nDried and pre-packaged items from Italy is also available so I picked up a box of Ziti and a bottle of passata (fresh tomato puree).  Looks like that ziti dish will be hitting my blog soon!!\n\nUpdate:  Here is that ziti I made and coincidentally my 300th blog post - http://www.cookwithzee.blogspot.com/2015/11/baked-ziti.html", "author": "Joyce Z."}

They do that crap in many crappy supermarkets, but you would never see this in a good upscale Deli....even Whole Paycheck Market cuts fresh stuff for you.\n\nAny ingredients that are precut are going to lose flavor & freshness immediately....how dare they.\n\nI did pick up some Gnocchi on sale & some very pricey Parmesan cheese, \n\nwhich they claimed was \"the best\"  ( IT IS NOT )\n\n.....a Rocca Brand....\n\nwhich while it is an Italian Reggiano, it may be no better than Costco's or WF's.  \n\nAccording to my Goggle search, it is rather a generic Parmigiano Reggiano.\n\nI could find several much more interesting PR cheeses under the Ambrosi or Merro labels online.\n\nI really hate when a place totally brags about something that they are FOS about. The Rocco brand, at about $19/lb is not likely to be that \"special\".\n\nJudging by the zillions of pics of their sandwiches, they do look quite pathetic.\n\nMolinari, like Mara's, down the street have seen better days, and now appeal to tourists & younger Yelpers who have not traveled nor experienced much in their brief lives. \n\nI am not even sure if these Deli owners have any real current culinary connections with modern day Italy....I surely did not see anything special.\n\nMy local Italian Deli (De Palo's in Shell Beach) hand makes an amazing homemade Mozzarella Cheese fresh every morning.....& it is a whole block away from my Condo.....they also have great Biscotti....\n\nYes, I am spoiled....I also grew up in an Italian neighborhood in Brooklyn NY.....", "author": "Paul M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-14", "description": "After eating their Italian salami for years the time has come to visit the location that started it all: Molinari Deli in San Francisco's  North Beach.\n\nThe exterior looks exactly as you would expect for an old school deli that has been in business for ages. Actually it looks even older considering they moved to this location back in the 60s, though they have been established at the end of 19th century. It has this cool semi-dirty look that is so specific to these places in North Beach that have been around forever.\n\nWhen you walk in, the shelves stacked with Italian delicacies look at you from all sides. The long counter with staff behind splits the room running vertically across. Behind are all sorts of deli meats, cheeses, pickled veggies...Heck, they even make their own mozzarella. If you want a sandwich you grab a number and wait. This place is always busy so the wait will most likely not be short but worth the while. If you're getting a sandwich make sure to grab your roll from the pile and take it to the counter when your number gets called. The store has all sorts of Italian groceries to kill time while waiting so you might even pick some unexpected items to take home.\n\nMy favorites here are definitely the cured meats with their super delish hot coppa sliced thin being a standout. You can't go wrong with anything sliced here...it looks so good that I wouldn't even mind trying that (otherwise nasty) head cheese.\n\nThe service is very old-fashioned friendly and each customer is treated like a regular. Some guys behind the counter even speak Italian. Like some reviewers noted parking in this area is not the best and my advice is to park in the North Beach garage on Vallejo St. \n\nIf you are in the area, looking for authenticity, and/or on the budget there are no better options than Molinari: this is essential San Francisco experience. I cannot recommend it more highly...5 stars well deserved.", "author": "Vedran V."}

Apparently, this place can make it happen. This place is a very \"old-school\" looking traditional Italian deli right in San Francisco. I walked inside, and grabbed a tiny piece of paper from a small red machine dispenser. The piece of paper had a number on it, and you have to wait for them to call the number. \n\nI ordered a Molinari special with everything, and asked for mozzarella cheese and a focaccia roll. You may have to pay extra, but this $10 sandwich is really large. It should be enough for two lunches for a man. Everything refers to lettuce, tomato, onion, mayonnaise and mustard. I took a bite out of this sandwich, and I had a nice wonderful feeling after each and every bite. The bread was fairly fresh and had a nice chewiness. The meats inside the sandwich had a nice fresh taste, and the portions are excellent. The mozzarella cheese, the mayonnaise, and the fresh vegetables enhanced the flavor very significantly, and I thought I was eating an almost perfect cold sandwich. I felt like a very happy carpenter who just had a very tasty lunch after a hard working but rewarding morning.\n\nI saved another half of that big sandwich for about 24 hours, and it was enough for a good lunch during my flight out of San Francisco to the somewhat decent city of Boston. As long as you put the sandwich in a refrigerator and give it a tiny \"reheat\" back to room temperature or a tiny warmness, the sandwich should still be good. This is not a good place if you are in a rush, because there seems to be a queue. The location is not too bad, it's very close to Chinatown, and it's within walking distance to Coit Tower. \n\nOverall, I thought I had the biggest, tastiest and the most wonderful cold cut sandwich in San Francisco so far. If I wanted to bring my lunch, I would love to come back to buy some cold cuts to make my own tasty sandwich. This place is possibly one example of San Francisco's cold sandwiches at its finest, and these guys have been doing it for a very long time, since 1896.", "author": "Ambrose C."}

Ok, fine. So I figured they picked their own bread out and soon found the bin they had picked them from. The meat and cheese selections were as expected from a deli that's been around so long. They even had some gourmet items to choose from. I ordered the, \"South Beach sandwich\" with a side of Calamata olives and a bag of chips. Excellent!

I also grabbed a bag of sriracha kettle chips and 1/8 lb. of hot dry salami to nibble on. We walked down to the park to a bench and dived into the bad boy. It was just great.

A lot of stores and restaurants in the Bay Area use their meats, so it's a foodie thrill to come to the source of these high-quality products. First step: grab your choice of bread roll from the case opposite the meat counter. They have a number ticket dispenser, but it wasn't that crowded when we went on a Thursday around noon. When it's your turn to order, hand your bread over to the server and he will put together your yummy sammich. My friend and I both got their special for $7.75, which is a combination of classic Italian meats, including my favorite, salami. I got mine with all the regular additions of lettuce, tomato, onion, pepperoncini, and mustard, so minus mayo and cheese. \n\nMolinari's is one of those places where technique is not really so important, because the authentic, freshly cut meats and breads make even the simplest sandwiches shine. In addition, the service is personal and fun--our server man smiled as he teased me in a friendly manner about my condiment preferences, and later when he saw me peering into the store from our table outside he gestured in a \"sandwich good?!\" kind of way and of course I responded in the affirmative.  \n\nI'm not even sure if Molinari's overhang is labeled with its name, but thankfully I recognized the store from photos on Yelp so didn't miss it while power-walking down Columbus.

I've been wanting to try Molinari for a while now. I had high hopes for this place based off the reviews I've read on YELP and what people have told me first hand. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nMolinari Delicatessen reminds me of a typical Italian deli. The deli itself was very cluttered inside. It was like they hired a hoarder as their interior designer. They have a lot of Italian food items spread throughout the deli. I'm assuming most if not all of these products are from Italy. They have a few tables located outside. \n\nFood: \n\nI ordered the Smoked Ham on a French Roll with mayo, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, provolone and American cheese. I'll start off with the bread. When my girlfriend and I arrived at Molinari we were told to choose a roll. There's a designated area where you can hand pick your own bread roll. I know a lot of delis have this option but in a way it's really unsanitary and gross when you think about it. You don't know who touched the bread rolls. We all know that a lot of nasty people don't wash their hands after using the restroom and in general. If you really think about it those bread rolls probably have all kinds of human fluids on them. At least some other places have tongs to get the rolls out. There weren't any labels informing the customer of what type of rolls there were. I wanted a French Roll and when I asked the guy that worked there (possibly the owner) he didn't even know if there was a French Roll in there. He even made me pick up the roll to show him. He said that's not a French Roll. He told me he had some French Rolls behind the counter. I proceeded to put the roll, that he asked me to show him, back in the container with the expectation of him telling me to give it to him because I touched it and I was surprised that he said nothing. So someone that day got a roll with my FUNK on it....Sorry!\n\nWhen I took my sandwich out of the bag it felt beyond hard! Every French Roll that I've eaten at a deli has been really soft. Usually Sourdough Rolls are very hard. I went back in and asked the employees if their French Rolls are supposed to be hard. They told me yes. I shook my head as I walked back outside to our table. The first bite of my Smoked Ham Sandwich was a challenge. The French Roll was so damn hard! I could of definitely broke a window with this sandwich. The roll was hard as a rock. Even though the roll itself tasted really good I don't see how somebody can enjoy the actual sandwich. It was very time consuming while eating this particular sandwich. It took me over 30 minutes to eat this sandwich. I could usually eat a sandwich in about 5 to 7 minutes. My jaw muscles were very sore from all the chewing after I ate this sandwich. The Smoked Ham was really good and had a lot of flavor. It was definitely some of the best deli ham I've ever eaten. The condiments and cheeses were fresh. I think it would have been a really solid sandwich if the French Roll was softer. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Turkey Pesto Special on a Sourdough Roll with fresh mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes and marinated peppers. She said her sandwich was terrible! The Turkey had no flavor. The mozzarella tasted like nothing. The pesto was over oily and the basil in the pesto was not even chopped finely. The sun dried tomatoes didn't taste good. They were really soggy and had a sour flavor. The peppers just didn't taste good as well. My girlfriend also said the bread was just whatever. She gave her sandwich a 1. If she could of given her sandwich a 0 she would have. She only ate half of her sandwich because it tasted like crap. \n\nWe ordered a side of Macaroni Salad and Asiago Cheese Pasta Salad. They were okay. The Macaroni Salad had a weird flavor. Overall it was underwhelming. \n \nService:\n\nThe guy that made our Sandwich who I'm assuming was the owner was kind of rude and not personable. Don't be in customer service if you don't like people. \n\nOverall:\n\nMolinari Delicatessen is definitely not worth the trip. Their sandwiches are way overpriced for what you get. We spent almost $30 for two weak sandwiches and two shitty pasta salads. IKE'S blows this place out of the water! I won't be coming back.", "author": "David R."}

I've had Molinari bookmarked for a while due to the 7x7 things to eat list which recommended the Renzo Special. From Yelp reviews I surmised I should get it on the foccacia bread and get it toasted. At 3 PM in the afternoon there's only a handful of people. I took a number though it was unnecessary. They took out a huge leg of prosciutto for the sandwich and just took a few minutes to assemble and another few minutes to toast. During that time I browsed around the store. Yes, it's a pretty cool deli but my heart belongs to Lucca Ravioli - a similar old school Italian deli in my hood where I've been shopping for 8 years (hopefully the guys at Molinari approve of this). \n\nThe sandwich was okay in the end. I'm not a big fan of their foccacia bread. The dough was like normal fluffy white bread but studded with green onions. I prefer the foccacia that's more holey and stiffer if that makes sense. The prosciutto was good though - nice and meaty. Went well with the mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes.

The guys behind the counter had a great banter of English and Italian going on, making me feel welcome while being simultaneously entertained by the genuine old-school interaction with customers.  You won't get this kind of connection with the folks behind the counter at your local Chipotle.\n\nI was instructed by my local acquaintances to pick my bread (all of which was fresh and smelling great) and bring it to the counter, where after some deliberation I chose the Renzo special.

If I had read Yelp first maybe I could have avoided the mistake of ordering them as I see nothing but sandwiches reviewed in the 8 pages I just read.\n\nMy husband and I love veal and spinach or beef and spinach raviolis. They have become impossible to find and if you do either the dough or the filling is not good. By good dough, I mean al dente. So we knew Molinari had a great reputation and gave them a call inquiring if they made raviolis. The guy who answered the phone said yes.  His wife makes them daily and they always sell out. So we decided to have them for our New Year's Eve celebration.  What a disappointment and mistake.\n\nWe ordered 4 pounds.  We cooked the first two and planned to freeze the other two.  My husband drove from Sunnyvale to get them and I guess we were optimistic.  Wrong. We followed the directions and boiled them 3 minutes. The dough turned to slime on the top side, broke open and we couldn't even fully drain them as the filling liquified and was pouring out with the water.  Still we sat down and tried to eat them with the beautiful homemade tomato sauce from the tomatoes I grew this summer.  The texture was like eating a bowl of slimy cream of wheat. We threw them away and decided to cook the other two pounds.\n\nFor the next batch, we put them into the boiling water and took them out the second the water came to a boil.  This time when we drained them most of the filling stayed in. We sat down and gave them a try but still they were inedible. Just a big plate of slimy texture - filling and pasta. For some reason, they use rice flour.  Not sure if it is in the pasta or the filling.  I suspect maybe both which might account for the texture.  Also no spinach or swiss chard in the filling either which we were assured they made them with.\n\nI am sorry to write such a bad review but I really hope to spare other fellow ravioli lovers out there a bad experience.  Wish I would have known.  We wasted time, money for gas and the raviolis.  And it ruined our New Year's Eve Party.\n\nI now wonder if the ravioli making wife selling out the raviolis every day is just hype to get the ravioli deprived to come in and buy once.", "author": "Judy A."}

Walking into the store, the smell of sausage and fresh bread greets your nose.  It will be crowded but it's worth the time to wait.  If you want a sandwich, feel free to select one from a bin filled with fresh bread then let the clerk know what you want in your sandwich.  While your soon-to-be-eaten sandwich is being built, feel free to look at the items on the shelves and the sausage hanging from the ceiling.  These guys make the best pepperoni sausage I've ever had and everytime I'm in the area, I try to bring some back to munch and share.

Savor the first bite because it's the start of a vacation for your tastebuds!

And to top it all off, a girl tried to walk in there with her dog (luckily the store employees told her to leave him outside).  Which means that.. you get the picture.\n\nI ordered the Molinari Special ($6.75) which is basically a hefty salame sandwich with peppers, onions, cheese, mustard, and mayo.

Their own meats are great, they're for sale all over town including Safeway, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's, and it's great to come to the source. If you order a sandwich here you get a healthy heap of their meat, and some other nice stuff like sundried tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil pesto spread, etc.\n\nThe only two minuses, and these are big ones if you're going out of your way for a deli. First, the sandwiches themselves are nothing special in terms of conception, flavor, construction. They don't have any patent on great sandwiches, they just pile on some good ingredients. Second, beyond the sandwiches there's almost nothing to buy here, not too many salads, sides, accompaniments, or surprises. You just come in and you order a sandwich. To be fair there are a lot of Italian pantry items like chestnut flour and olives, just nothing you would want for a picnic.", "author": "Gil S."}

Oh, and be courteous, use the tongs!\n3) Select what you want. If it's not a special sandwich, then decide what cheese, and if you want 'everything' on it.\n4) When your number is called, tell them what you want and hand them your bread choice. \n5) Then you wait for your unbelievably delicious sandwich to be made.\n6) ENJOY\n\nI got the pastrami with Swiss and everything, warm.

I spoke to the owner a few times and he barely knows English and yet we had a nice conversation. \n\nI came here a few times to get the the Molinari Special which he recommended. I had the soft bread and it was loaded with a lot of meat. 7 or 8 different slices of cold cuts, mayo etc. The sandwich was pretty big and you can actually finish it in one sitting. I did. Also bought creamy cheese and their bottled orange soda. They have things and can goods imported from Italy. I assume they have imported a lot of yummies from their homeland.\n\nI wish they weren't located on the corner which has a slight hill and gets pretty windy outside. Makes it difficult to enjoy a meal when constantly trying to chase down your napkin and moving hair out of the face. Esp when the table is tilting back and forth.

So this review is based solely on what I ordered, the Renzo Special. For $12 this sandwich came with hardly any meat and way too much bread. It looked nothing like every other Yelp review of it, so I'm pretty confused as to what happened. My friend and i both ordered it and were pretty let down. Anyways it came with sundried tomatoes, prosciutto and mozzarella (but hardly any). I would maybe come back here and give a different sandwich another shot if I was in the area, but then again there are so many great delis in north beach so that's not too likely to happen.", "author": "Allison D."}

The freshly made to order sandwiches are the best I have ever had. And when I say freshly made to order I mean it. \n\nYou hand pick your freshly made bread and hand it to a specialist behind the counter to build your sandwich. In my case the Renzo Sandwich. They then take each ingredient from the deli case and slice everything from the meats, sun dried tomatoes and mozzarella there and then. Nothing on my sandwich was pre-sliced. On a nice day (like when I visited), we took our meal a few blocks north to Washington Square for an impromptu picnic. Which is a great way to enjoy any meal.

I didn't mind standing around for a while because my attention was completely monopolized by the wide selection of meats and cheeses. I wanted to try a slice of everything. \n\nWe shared two sandwiches, the Italian combo and the North Beach special. The Italian combo was a cornucopia of various sliced meats -- I think the guy put in coppa, mortadella, headcheese (at my request) and a few other nameless slices. The North Beach special (or was it the South Beach? I forgot) had sweet peppers, sun dried tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and prosciutto. Both sandwiches were fabulous, although we both agreed that we preferred the second one. \n\nThey could easily charge 50% more for the sandwiches here and everything just screamed quality and freshness. On a nice day, heck, even if the weather was crummy like yesterday, order a few sandwiches at Molinari, get a bottle of wine at one of the many wine shops in the neighborhood and go to Washington Park for an impromptu picnic.

The moment they told me to pick a bread from the box to make my sandwich I was a bit surprised and then I was like \"Ah, yeah. I'm gonna pick me a winner!\"\n\nTruth be told, that's just empty words, really. As there's not any way to walk out of this place without being a winner. The food is so good and the selection of Italian deliciousiness is so ripe that you'll have no other option. \n\nThe way to go is with the Molinari special with everything. Put your trust in their hands and believe me, they will make your taste buds soar like the tubed cured meat that is hanging in this shop\n\nWhile it was the dude's first day on the job, he made my Molinari special like a champ. That sucker was seriously one of the best sandwiches I have eaten.\n\nThe joint also has a lot of goodies. Such as pates, imported wines and vast selection of goods you probably could only find in the mother land of Italy. From the meat hanging on the walls to the other side filled wines, it's just a massive taste of Italy that you can't forget. \n\nThe servers there have a bit of a sass, but it's nothing worse than talking to someone from Jersey, youse know? \n\nI was looking for an Italian wine and wasn't finding it. Asked the workers and bam, they not only found it, they also suggested a couple of bottles like it. Now that's what I call service. \n\nBut back to the sandwich for a moment. The thing was delicious. You really can't go wrong with it as they pile the meat and other fixings up to make it incredibly delicious. It doesn't move around all that much either, which is something of a pet peeve for when I have sandwiches. \n\nStructural integrity and proper foundation laying in your food is always essential. You'll not spend all that much money here and walk away stuffed with a little filling of culture. Get what I'm saying. \n\nNo way you can go wrong and if you're visiting the S.F. area or live here and haven't had this in a couple of months, you need to get down and enjoy it as it's a staple of the North Beach area.", "author": "Javier J."}

I also have to thank fellow Yelpers for teaching us the tricks & keys of how to order & what to do when you get here so we wouldn't seem so \"lost\". I will pass on this advise to others to make your experience easier as well.\n\nCame here on a Saturday. I've read so many reviews that this place can get busy. Came here a little bit before lunch (noon) I was expecting to see a crowd, but luckily as we approached I didn't see a line out the door, good sign. Walked inside and it wasn't so bad. There were about 5 groups/couple of people ahead of us.\n\nYou walk in and it's just a mish mosh of everything everywhere! Stuff on the wall, stuff hanging, pictures, & just a lot of stuff on shelves & everywhere that makes it feel like a little neighborhood deli that more than likely carries everything & anything you're looking for. The deli cases & counter are the main focal point of course. If you glance up stairs you can see what may have been a seating area at one point way back when, but now you can see the wooden beams upstairs have been turned into wine racks with dozens of wine bottles.\n\nYou walk in & the first thing you need to do is grab a number. Second thing you do is make your way towards the back where you'll find the bread bin & grab a piece of bread. Now you just look over the menu & figure out what delicious sandwich you want them to create for you. There are plenty of signs & descriptions to help you in your decision process. Especially on what you want IN your sandwich... Be sure to read the board that tells you everything they offer & what \"everything\" can mean.\n\nI had the Renzo's Special: Prosciutto, FRESH mozzarella, pesto & sun dried tomatoes. The first thing I noticed is the Prosciutto that the man behind the counter pulled from the deli case. I've seen prosciutto in many different places and they're mostly round. The prosciutto he pulled out looked like the whole leg. Not just the \"rounds\" that you usually see in the stores. He cut my Prosciutto from the more square part of the leg, big, fat & juicy. First PLUS! Then he pulled two fresh mozzarella balls out of their deli and sliced them right in front of me on the counter. Talk about fresh! They have chips & drinks in a freezer case if you want to complete your meal. All in all the sandwich was a great portion and DELICIOUS!\n\nWe got there at just the right time, because after we placed our order and got one of the 3 tables/chairs that were outside, more people started to come in. There came a point where they got pretty busy that people outside walking up turned around because they didn't want to deal with the crowd. Too bad for them. I could even hear a few people say that they've wanted to come here, but didn't want to deal with the crowd. Believe me people, it's worth the wait! Patients rewards here!\n\nIf you find yourself around the Ferry Building area, Molinari's is just blocks away. It's a great scenic walk. You pass the TransAmerica Pyramid plus see a little bit of Little Italy & a glimpse of Chinatown down a couple streets.\n\n'Til the next food find...\n\nEat it... Love it?...

They're also large, so if you aren't super hungry it's not a bad idea to split one.  Most range from $10-12.\n\nIt's definitely a little intimidating walking in for the first time, not knowing how the system works.  You walk in, grab a number immediately, make your way through the crowd of people hanging in front of the deli counter to the \"bread bin\" (in the middle of the shop against the left wall) and grab your choice of bread.  Then you figure out what you want to order from the deli board and wait for them to call your number.  You then hand your bread to the gentleman that called your number, let him know what sandwich you want, and pay attention because he's going to ask you some follow up questions (with everything?  what kind of cheese?  who do you know here?  just kidding.) \n\nThe Molinari Special is definitely the most popular, and it's delicious, but next time I'm excited to try one of the Gourmet Sandwiches.

Finally something that makes sense in San Francisco - a city where the Palace of Fine Arts is home to a children's museum and the Presidio (a military base) is home to the Disney museum.\n\nHere's my tourists guide for ordering a sandwich at Molinari:\n1. Take a number.\n2. Look at the menu board and pick a sandwich.\n3. If the sandwich is not on foccaccia, grab a roll in the open wooden bin that is opposite the cash register.\n4. If you want a drink, pick one out of the refrigerator case while you wait.\n5. There are limited tables that are only outside and they don't have napkins. Consider eating the sandwich elsewhere and/or bring napkins.\n\nThe \"Molinari Special\" is a basic sub that is heavy on mustard and mayo which interfered with the meats. It's not hard to find a better sub and wouldn't have this one again. So if you're looking for a great Italian sub, this is not the place. But for a wonderful non-traditional sandwich, the \"Luciano Special\" on pressed focaccia bread with prosciutto, sweet coppa, dried tomatoes, and fresh mozzarella is worth a return visit. It's a great contrast of saltiness, meatiness, sweetness, and tanginess.\n\nThe deli case is better than most Italian shops because it has all varieties of Molinari salame and coppas. I like the Molinari style where it's not t too peppercorn hot, but has plenty of fatty meatiness. The rest of the deli is small and the selection is small. The cheese selection is more unique than most Italian delis, but below cheese stores or markets with large cheese cases like Whole Foods.", "author": "Brian U."}

Iti deli's are a passion of mine, and in LA there are three great ones: Sorrrento's, Bay Cities and Giuliano's, all top notch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-30", "description": "After hearing about the legendary sandwiches, then reading the amazing Yelp reviews my curiosity had peaked. Molinari Delicatessen is a quaint Italian deli that serves up good sandwiches and Italian fare. The place is small but almost every part of the shop is covered in wallpaper, decorations, and products. My first time in at lunch time and it's packed. I didn't need to ask for sandwich protocol because everyone was holding a piece of bread and a blue ticket. There's also a small sign up above the counter.\n\nSo you take your ticket, wait for your number to be called, and pick a piece of bread out of a clear acrylic bread box. It feels strange just standing there with a piece of bread in your hands. It was hard not to start chewing on a piece. Even though there's about six guys behind the counter making sandwiches they take their time and don't rush. They clearly see the line and know that their customers aren't going anywhere.\n\nOnce you hand them your piece of bread you tell them what special you want. I'm pretty sure you can customize whatever sandwich you can imagine. I got the Molinari Special, aka Italian Special. It's the only special that doesn't list the ingredients but I overheard from everyone it's the best. It's a sandwich full of Italian meats, peppers, your choice of either Swiss or Provolone cheese, lettuce, and tomato.\n\nIt's a good sandwich. It's sure better than most sandwich chains because of the fresh meat and crusty bread. My only complaint is that since the meat is pre packed into a layer before sliding into the sliced bread, it tends to slide out when you chew your sandwich. Meat slippage is an annoyance of mine. A perfect sandwich should never slip. But that's just me.\n\n____\n\nGood sandwiches and meats. I'm interested in how good their pastas and other products are.\n\nNote: The only seating is about three tables with chairs out front.", "author": "Michael H."}

These guys know what they're doing--the fat was meticulously trimmed, and the prosciutto was thin sliced paper-thin. The flavor was amazing. We could have stayed there eating prosciutto all day!\n\nWe recently stopped by again for some sandwiches to go. It's a bit of a machine. First, grab a number from the paper number tape. Second, grab your bread out of the bread case. Don't bother trying to order a sandwich without completing these two steps first; you will upset the balance of the universe.\n\nI had the Molinari special. It's basically your typical Italian cold cut, stacked high with premium Italian meats and served on a nice hearty roll (see step two above).

Not presented well on the sandwich, but tasty individually.\n\nSalame: Got the two pounder.  Something nice about having a big salame in the house.  Pretty mild, but a great balance of meat and fat.  Best sliced as thin as you can at home with some mustard to dip it in.\n\nOnion Foccacia: The onions added a good contrast to the greasy meat sandwich fillings.  Could have been fluffier.

I've been to some great sub shops in Chicago (Bari, Fontanos, Vinnie's, JP Graziano, etc...)  In fact, I go to Bari at least once a week.  Their sandwiches are that good.  The other places listed are not too far behind.  I went into Molinari's thinking it'd be comparable.  Wrong!\n\nFirst off, at Molinari's you get to pick your own bread from a bucket.  Not bad right?  Again, wrong.  Maybe it was because I was there after the lunch rush (around 3PM) but the bread was stale and hard.  I am not talking about hard crust, I am talking hard through and through.   Compare this with Vinnie's in Chicago.  If Vinnie's runs out of bread, they just stop selling sandwiches.  No compromise to quality.  You always get fresh awesome bread (from the D'Amato bakery down the street).\n\nSo now to the actual fixings on the sandwich.  I asked for everything that normally goes into an italian sandwich and I ended up with mustard?!  I've never had an italian sandwich in Chicago with mustard on it.  Most places in Chicago wrinkle their nose at you if you ask for mayo on italian sandwiches.  I hate to think what they would do about mustard.  Aside from the mustard, the quality of the ingredients did not compare.  The taste of Bari italian subs just jumps out at you.  You get a mouthful of distinct flavors in every bite.  Molinari's sub was more bland.  I mean, it's better than say Subway, but that's not saying much.  Also, where was the giardiniera?  Bari makes their own giardiniera that is absolutely killer.  I wanted some more kick to my sandwich that was provided (I blame the lack of kick on the mustard).\n\nAlso, prices are not \"reasonable\", at least not compared to Chicago.  The sandwich I got was about $7.  I could have gotten the same size sandwich for $5 in Chicago.\n\nThe guy who made my sandwich was friendly enough.  In fact we talked a little football (since I was wearing a ManU jersey).  He seemed liked a fine enough fellow.  I just question his sandwich making skills.\n\nI will be back in the future to give this place another try since I still can't believe that this place is rated so highly.  Maybe I just got the wrong sandwich?  Or the sandwich maker was having a bad day?  \n\nI am not trying to say food in Chicago is better than SF (sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't).

Just to forewarn, the sandwiches are huge and could easily feed two people, depending on how much you can put away. I saved the other half of mine to eat later, and it was still just as delicious.\n\nMolinari's also offers a plethora of fresh meats, cheeses, homemade pastas, as well as a variety of freshly made deli salads and sides.

I even walked by the deli daily going to and  from work for months. Never did i decide to pop in for a sandwich. \n\nWell, Today after an early work out and running around doing some errands, 3pm hit and I was starving. Walking through China Town, thinking about pork buns or tacos or pizza, I decide Hey... Lets give Molinari's a try. \n\nBoy was I glad!!!\n\nI picked my number and stared at the board trying to decide which tasty sandwich I should try. I had to make sure I picked a good one because this place is supposed to be soooo great!  I made my decision mentally, but thought I would ask someones opinion. With out batting an eye the man yells back, \"The Luciano Special\".... Ding Dng Ding! I was sooo happy because that is what I wanted.\n\nSo, I ordered the Luciano Special - Parma Proscuitto, Sweet Coppa, Fresh Mozzarella, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Onions, Lettuce on Grilled Focacia Bread. Watching the guy behind the counter slice the fresh Proscuitto on to my sandwich made my mouth WATER!!! The mozzarella was ooozing out of my perfectly toasted sandwich.\n\nSo, I get my sandwich and decide to enjoy this treat right out side the deli and enjoy this sandwich and some sun. The flavors came together magically. I had planned on eating half and saving the rest for later. Instead of people watching and soaking up the sun, I put my head down and DEVOURED the sandwich... The crunchy bread, Fresh cuts of deli meats, super soft and gooey cheese, crunchy lettuce and onions.... Way to go guys... You NAILED it!", "author": "Miguel V."}

Washington Square park was on the mind...\n\nBut I was hungry...\n\nNot like, \"Meh...I could eat.\" More like, I was HUNGRY...ravinous, starving...you know, like the Italian level of hungry. You know what I'm talking about, there are different degrees of hunger and Italian is the highest. This is the time you know you are willing to drop 10 bones on a sandwich as long as it cures what you've got goin' on.\n\nSo on my quick jaunt down the hill to the park, I b-lined for Molinari's Deli. Inside the store makes you feel like you are in some tiny little tuscan village market, picking up your groceries for the day. They have a large assortment of cheeses, pastas, crackers, bread, salami, olives, wines, cookies etc for taking home to cook. But in the back, they have a sandwich counter and deli salads/pastas for take-away. \n\nI ordered up the caprese sand-o with mozzerella, tomatoes, fresh basil, roasted peppers etc on garlic foccacia bread. The guy behind the counter gave me a taste of a few salads and I selected some shrimp tortelli to accompany my sandwich. The last five days of hitting the gym were going to make this lunch's guilt factor melt away...I was not messing around. \n\nI took this masterpiece with two beers and posted up in the park for the next few hours to catch the warm summertime rays. Despite my afore mentioned hunger, I still could only put back half of this gigantic sandwich. It was fragrant and spicy and cheesy and fresh and everything good. Do yourself a favor and hit up Molinari's next time you decide to make a picnic in the park. You will not be sad you did.\n\nSmall disclaimer, if you are a young female, be prepared to be oogled and hit on by the entire Molinari's staff.

Personally, I don't think that a sandwich has the capacity to knock my socks off--it's essentially just bread and meat.  However, for what Molinari does, they do pretty damn well.  I think the sandwiches are awesome for a couple reasons:  (1) there really is a difference in flavor (even if it's just in your head) when the deli meat is freshly-sliced to order; and (2) the improvement in flavor exponentially increases when said sandwich contains a whole hell of a lot of that freshly-sliced meaty goodness.\n\nAfter a long urban hike, this sandwich really hit the spot.

Obviously, it's got the history, and therefore some cred. They do actually have Italian import goodies in there, but much of it appears 40 years old. I do dig the floor-to-ceiling decor. But overall, a disappointing tourist trap of the North Beach variety. \n\nThe thing is, the sandwiches just aren't great. Maybe it's me, but I don't enjoy bloodying the roof of my mouth with a stale white roll that is 80% crust. Not to mention, if you don't pick that roll out of the bread bin before they call your number, they will skip right over your ass. And inevitably, you'll have number 61, and a large family of fatassed Nebraskans who try to talk to the counter guys in what they perceive to be Italian (both counter guys are 3rd generation American, FYI), will have number 59. And because you realize it's going to take all freaking day for them to get their eight pounds of prosciutto, you procrastinate in picking your stale roll out of the bin. Then all of a sudden they call your number and you're screwed. \n\nSo let's say you actually have your bread ready to go when they call you, and you hand it over and ask for salami and swiss with everything. Because the \"salami will blow your mind,\" so what else would you get? So it takes them about ten seconds to slap together your \"mind-blowing\" sandwich, which consists of the aforementioned salami, pre-sliced limp cheese, iceberg lettuce, tomato, French's yellow mustard and a few pepperoncini shavings, and you hand over $6.00 for the privilege of bloodying your gums on their stale bread. \n\n\nP.S.

I anxiously strolled into Molinari's Delicatessen and read the big board and figured out the system.  \n\nAs tourists stand by dumbstruck trying to decide, here's how the whole thing works. It is simple. Grab a number. Do it no matter what. Figure out what you want - there's a North Beach Special Sandwich there which is wonderful. Go to the bread bin opposite the meat case and select your bread. Use the tongs - what are you, an animal?\n\nWhen Mister Man calls your number and asks you 'whaddaya want' Soprano-style, you counter with your memorized answer and give him the bread you've selected. Hopefully, the sandwich will include their outrageously tasty sun-dried tomatoes and peppers. Just typing that made me weak in the knees.\n\nWhile your sandwich is being created, go to the refrigerated case and get your drink. I got a Vitamin Water. Order something else to go with your sandwich. I got 1/4 pint of mozzarella/tomato salad which is my favorite. Oops I think I just drooled.\n\nThey take credit cards, debit cards and cash. It is at this point that you can marvel at the fact that all this will cost you around $12 or $13 - and if weather permits, you can eat outside and watch trippy North Beach go by. Cheap food of exceptional quality - PLUS cheap entertainment. \n\nHow can you go wrong? You can't.  Cheaper and just as authentic as lotsa places in New York's Little Italy.

These were necessary items especially for large family reunions where lots of appetizers were necessary.\r\n\r\nWe came to Molinaris for the salami (and other cold cuts), prosciutto, and teleme cheese (very nice smeared on a grissini).\r\n\r\nIt's still here, and this alone is a good thing...still making excellent sandwiches, serving up a fair sample of deli items and stocking numerous odd imported items.

Coppa, prosciutto, genoa, soppressata, toscana, provolone, mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, pepperoncini.  There was an astounding amount of meat and accoutrements on those sandwiches.  \n\nAlso, the wonderful sandwich maker was very patient with the two of us as we wavered back and forth between our countless meaty options.

They freshly sliced the meat and put a very very generous helping into the foccacia bread.  It was accompanied by fresh Mozzarella, Sun-dried Tomatoes, Onions, Prosciutto, and a thin slice of Lettuce.  Minimal healthy stuff! Just the way I like it! O=) I know I will die of a heart attack soon but at least I died happy! lol  The sandwich was huge, but too me it wasn't anything too special.  Don't get me wrong, it was flavorful but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary.  \n\nThey had a fully loaded meat case on one side and cheeses displayed on the other.  We asked about the meats because there were some that we didn't recognize and he immediately gave us a slice to try.  Then we decided on getting salami and asked which one he recommended.  He got so excited and said he had the perfect one... immediately pulled it out of the case and sliced 2 beautiful slices for us to try.  We got 1/2 lb and the meat was so beautifully sliced and positioned on the paper.  I took photos!

We're not talking about some 2 foot sub from Safeway's deli, or some pathetic multi-foot long from Subway, we wanted a legit sandwich that was ready to party.  I tried Marina Subs, I tried Yellow Submarine and I tried King Foot Subs...everyone that answered the phone thought that I was crazy and/or playing a practical joke on them.  To their credit, I WAS asking for a 6-foot sandwich, and I WAS pretty pumped about it...so maybe I did sound crazy.\n\nMy roommates and I were in full distress mode when I decided to dial one last number, Molinari's.\n\nEmployee: Molinari's\nMe: Yeah, hi, I'm wondering if you guys do party subs?\nEmployee: Yeh\nMe: You do?!\nEmployee: Yeh, how big?\nMe: Like...6 feet?\nEmployee: When do you want to pick it up?\n\nThe ninja and sandwiches party was saved!  And we owe it all to Tony at Molinari's.  He was real friendly, and helped me through the process, and to order a sandwich of that magnitude...it actually is a process (They specially order the bread from a local bakery in advance, and then have to put together 6 ft of sandwich and wrap it up).\n\n4 stars because the sandwich was delicious and 6 feet, minus 1 star because it was crazy expensive...I'm even ashamed to admit how much we dropped on it.", "author": "Josh T."}

A stop here on the way back from work is a must for me. I pick up a pound of fresh pasta, some pesto sauce on occasion, some fresh mozzarella, etc. Also, great olive oil, a step up from TJ in quality and much more reasonable for the quality than Safeway IMHO. Yes standing in line during lunch is lame, but the sandwiches are phenomenal. Also, try some of their more unique cured meats like the bresaola (cured beef) it's worth the steep price. I also prefer this place to Palermo deli, which is less touristy but somehow also less satisfying.\n\nMinus one star however for being closed Sundays and the early closing (5:30, but I've come by at 5:15 just to find them closed).", "author": "Ross G."}

With that being said, now I can tell you my experience with this wonderful place.  \n\nSo I have been here on more than one occasion now because my first experience was so great!  I came here with a few friends for a late late lunch on a Sunday afternoon so needless to say, the normal line was not there.  We waited behind 5 or 6 other people but got served in about 10 minutes.  I ordered the Joe's Special which is a vegetarian sandwich with mozzerrella, sun dried tomatoes, pesto and some other stuff.  It was DELISH!!!!!!  The weather was nice, a bit chilly but still tolerable so we sat outside on one of the few tables on the street.  It was a great spot for a casual lunch with friends.\n\nOn another visit however, things were relatively the same as the first visit except a  homeless man came toward me yelling.  The irony of it all was that he was saying \"Speak proper English.\"  But his was so slurred and un audible that I could barely make out what he was saying.  It was awesome.  My friends and I ignored the man believing that it was better to quell the flames than to fuel the fire.  So that's pretty much the reason why this place receives 4 instead of 5 stars.  Oh and sometimes you can't get a table outside so you have to bring your lunch elsewhere to eat it.

I knew how the ordering system worked from other Yelp reviews, so thank you Yelp reviewers! I was excited to try the Dutch Crunch bread and so we picked out our rolls from the bin (FYI: please use the tongs provided) and waited for our turn. I ordered a turkey sandwich with mayo, lettuce, and tomato. My husband ordered the sun dried tomato turkey sandwich and our friend got a pastrami sandwich. They took credit cards for payment and we even got to speak a couple of words of Italian with the deli guy. Our lunch was enjoyed back at our rented apartment on the rooftop deck on a beautiful SF day. We all thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and it was plenty filling, saving our other half for another day. Delizioso!", "author": "Tammy G."}

Did my Yelp research and went with Molinari, which I had been eyeing for a while, but was never there in daylight! Was not too crowded at late lunch, scored the foccacia, meat was great, but sandwich was just too bready for me. In Italy, I had been turned on to schiacciata, which is thin bread and a fabulous bed for maximum meat flavor. I am a mortadella gal from my Italian grandfathers tutelage. He used to have to come over to SF from Marin to get our fixings for anitpasto plates. This sand wich was light on the meat, too heavy on bread. Next time, Lucca gets a shot. Italian product stock in store was also just ok, though wine selection was excellent and well priced. May try ravioli sometime, but gnocchi was filled, boo.", "author": "Erin S."}

The sandwiches aren't anything but the best italian sandwiches I've had, anywhere.  The bread is from a bakery up on grant and filbert I believe, and its always fresh and good.  The meats are to die for, everything from the turkey to the spicy cappicola.   My favorite sandwich right now is the Renzo, but that's subject to change.  On top of that, they have a great and not outrageously priced selection of cheeses, lots of italian imports (pasta, wine, various sauces) and the staff are cool friendly.  You gotta grab a ticket when its busy, which adds to the character.  I just can't think of anything to say against this place.  Makes me glad I live 2 blocks away.", "author": "Sam C."}

I don't think I've ever heard truer words before or since.\n\n  I've grown up around great Italian food and great Italian delis and my passions run deep. An Italian deli can brighten up even the darkest of crappy work days or busted relationships in much the same way Ben & Jerry's and Cold Stone do it for seemingly everyone else. But beware the faux Italian deli's that can sometimes be found in shiny new suburban shopping centers sporting Hormel meats and processed cheesefoods! Thankfully Molinari's has never sold out and is still the old school neighborhood Italian deli. The kind your nonni would have been going to for 30 years, on a first name basis with everyone there, patrons and staff... except really crowded with tourists (but that's ok, great things should be shared). The meats are hanging, the pasta, sauces and sausages are made fresh in the back, the bread comes from down the street and everything is exactly the way it should be.\n\n  My only gripe would be the fact that there is no fresh made foccacia. Sure you can get foccacia anywhere these days, but it's that crappy, fluffy, crumbly McFoccacia stuff that is about as authentic as the General Tsao's chicken at Panda Express. Oh and I guess I should gripe about them closing at 5pm. Still, both of those gripes don't constitute knocking off a star.\n\n  Their sandwiches are superb, mine being \"the most expensive sandwich I've ever sold\" (though it's still reasonable for a lunch in NB): hot coppa, toscano salami, buffalo mozzarella and all the trimmings.\n\n  The bread is fresh that day, the meats and cheeses are sliced to order and if you need any Italian kitchen ingredients, this is the place to go. Floor to celing wines, salt-packed capers and anchovys, san marzano tomatoes, pannaforte, etc. Plus there are patio tables so you can people-watch over your monster sammich.

They have some of the best Italian cold cuts anywhere in the world and the sandwiches are the bomb.\n\nI will respond to a handful of the reviews.\n\n1) To the person who complained about sun dried tomatoes on every sandwich.  If you don't like them order the sandwich without.\n\n2)  This place is not expensive.  It is cheaper than Quiznos and ways better quality.  I mean where else in the city can you get a great, large all meat sandwich and a soda for $7.50?\n\n3)  Finally, for the person who said they only have 1 type of bread, you are totally wrong.  They usually have at least 3-4 types of italian breads.  Would you complain at a German deli if they only had rye?  I don't think so.", "author": "Chris L."}

Whether it's cheap eats or gourmet dining, San Francisco can be called a food mecca.  Am I biased, not at all, but I live here!\n\nWhen I moved across the continent to the East Coast in 1999, after a short while, there was one thing I really missed, one thing I hungered for. My mouth watered for bacon and not just any bacon, pancetta Italian bacon. A delicacy not unique to San Francisco, surely? Of course not, depending on where you live, there is usually a good italian deli, usually an ability to find a decent salami and succulent italian sausages. But good hand cured pancetta, that's an entirely different story.\n\nI lived too far from Washington D.C. to get to Dean and Deluca for goods and let's face it, good though they may be, they are also overpriced. I also lived out in what would be considered the sticks, so I was nowhere near a deli and Safeway's deli counter had nothing so esoteric as pancetta. What's a girl to do?\n\nI did what any hungry person would do, I found a way! If I was flying back to San Francisco for a visit, I always included a stop in North Beach to my own holy grail of an italian deli, Molinari's for pancetta, which I then froze and carried lovingly in my luggage and doled out as slowly as I could manage. At this I was not successful and it never lasted nearly as long as the cravings. I induced friends to do the same, or people in the San Francisco branch of the law firm I worked for, yes, I was desperate, I would have them freeze and send me pancetta through inter-office fedex.\n\nSo, now eight years on, I am returned home and it was not too long before I found myself making a pilgrimage to the mecca for all things good that are Italian. Molinari's on the corner of Columbus (cross Vallejo). It is a well known spot for people working in the Financial District to take a short hike to Molinari's for a delicious hand-made sandwich at lunch time (remember, take a number and pick your roll for your sandwich in advance folks).\n\nEnough about me, though.\n\nMolinari's has all sorts of delicious prepared foods, fresh pasta and Italian goods on the wall, you almost feel like you've stepped back in time to an old-fashioned grocery.  As a matter of fact, you have.  Molinari is 100+ and going strong, Thank God.  If it's a sandwich you want, go here, if you want to stock your pantry, go here, if you want the most delicious domestic salami and other delicate cured meats, go here.  There is no better spot in SF to satisfy that rustic craving for cured meats and cheeses.  The wine selection is pretty good.  The guys are friendly, helpful with questions and quick as they can be and it's entertaining just to shop there.  I love Molinari and, unless you're a vegan or dead, you'll love them too, trust me on this one.", "author": "Donna H."}

Few come close to Molinaris, and many have failed.  So snag your number, head for the bread trough, and make sure you know what you want. Don't be an idiot and ignore the boys behind the counter calling your number.\n\nHands down, my favorite deli in San Francisco.  It's even better than Genova's Deli in Oakland.  Monster sandwiches, with premium meats hand sliced to order.  The herb seed bread is my favorite, but the foccacia upgrade is always another great choice. The cold foods are a plenty.  The pasta salads are creamy and darn tasty.  Mortadella, Head cheese, Roast Beef, supreme slices of Prosciutto, Coppa, Salami, you name it baby; the meat is all that, and a bag of chips.  They're always consistent with the right amount of everything.  My father told me stories about an amazing ox tongue they used to carry back in the days.  I'm sad that its not there, but I mean this place was up and running since the 1800's. If your unsure, the Italian sub is a must try.  A little bit of the best they have all in one packed sub. \n\nThe fresh pasta's are a must take home for the home cook.  Light, almost airy with a heavenly texture, the reasonably priced pastas are ohh so yummy.  Fresh pastas cook fast so be careful not to over cook. There are many great selections of wines, specialty cheeses,  oils, vinegars and other specialty items.  I've had my eye on the big bag of dried porcini mushrooms.\n\nWomen, I suggest flirting with the boys behind the counter. The boys seem to provide a \"little extra\" for a smile.  It's sad that it doesn't work for me, but I'd come back any day. It's worth the wait, and the money.  Molinari's please don't ever close, for I have no other to turn to.

The counter guy yammered on about how \"most people think the white stuff on the salami rolls hanging overhead is flour. It's not. It's mold.\" WTF, over? He's carrying on about nitrates and who knows what the fuck else. I don't know..B is the house cook and she says it's all good and I'm sure I've ate a lot of shit that can kill me from McD's and numerous random Taco stands, but still, this case was def TMI...", "author": "Morris D."}

Not sure what you call it.....maybe a dutch crunch roll? Some type of white bread roll that they slice in half.  They don't even have it behind the counter. You have to grab it from a bin, where people may or may not have probably already touched it. I'm not a germaphob at all, but it's a little disconcerting to know that someone probably had their germy un-washed hands all over my bread. Now that I know this, I will never, ever go here again for a sandwich. With the plethora of other great sandwich spots in north beach, why would I go here? Yes, this is a real deli though...they've got salami hanging from the ceiling and wall to wall pasta, sauces, and olive oil.

My boyfriend took me here because I was craving for a prosciutto sandwich. You go in, grab a number, pick out some bread for your sandwich and wait until someone calls your number. The day that I came, it was super crowded ..waited about 15 min for my sandwich, but the wait was well worth it because I was very pleased with my sandwich. Coincidentally one of my boyfriends old high school friend worked here so he made him a totally different sandwich with all sorts of different meats with some delicious bread. I liked how he just created something and it turned out bomb. We walked over to washington square park and enjoyed lunch on a nice sunny day.

Great place! People were really nice. It was my first time so I didn't have a number ticket or my bread ready but since there was no line they just laughed and helped me anyway. They put a generous amount of meat on my sandwich,and the ingredients tasted very fresh. Although I am not a big fan of the really crusty bread that comes with the sandwich it is a very authentic Italian style and added to my back in Italy experience. Very good sandwich and very reasonably priced. Anything that makes me call my friend and tell her about it while I'm still eating it deserves five stars in my book.", "author": "Andrea B."}

However, on August 17, 2012, I needed some pasta. I went in and picked up three boxes of pasta. I went to the counter. About 20 customers were there already waiting to have sandwiches made. I stood at the counter to see if there was a counter person who take my money for the pasta and I would not have to wait for the sandwich makers to make at least 20 sandwiches. That didn't happen. The sandwich preparers looked at me several times but never asked to help me. I put the pasta back on the shelf and left. I returned later when I thought they would be less busy. They still had about 20 customers. I picked up the three packages of pasta again and stood at the counter. Once again there was no counter person. I had to wait about 30 minutes before I could purchase the three boxes of pasta. This was after the employees had made about 20 sandwiches. I left after my pasta purchase. It seems that on Saturdays, Molinari's is a sandwich shop and not a deli.

Maybe it's the memory ot tasting those salty slices of deliciousness when my relatives used to bring a salami home after visiting SF, but I've been hooked since I was a kid.  Now I bring the salamis home for folks.  I love the hot salami and their prosciutto as well.  Now that the airlines don't serve meals, I look forward to my salami, hot salami, prosciutto and fresh mozzrella sandwich on rosemary foccacia bread on the plane.  I always get looks of envy as I bite in!  I've also purchased their dried porcini and Italian tuna.  If you've never had Italian tuna, you're in for a treat--really wonderful flavor.  The service at Molinari is always fun--they can spot the Hawaii people a mile away and know we're there for a sandwich and to lug back pounds of salami for eager relatives and friends.

I regret not taking in every experience she offered me but I am proud I have them in my mind n heart til this day to share with my kids. Of course there was the usual lessons of life speeches (rolling of the eyes remembering the embarrassing ones) but the BEST was our walks that came along with them before opening the bar and during bar hours (while the old timers watched the bar for her =)). From Alice across the street at the chinese restaurant that used to be there to Liguria Bakery she showed me the world through food. Molinari is one favorite of \"ours\" that I cherish. Not only do they bring me back to the great days my grandma was here with us but they are the ONLY true traditional italian deli I will forever remember. The cold cuts were/are unforgettably fantastic. I feel horrible for walkling into this deli making faces and rushing to get out when I was younger. \"Grandma hurry the cheese smell is making me gag\". How embarassing to be so unappreciative!!! Now a days I just fight the urge to go because of the wonderful memories this place brings onto me which sometimes are uncontrollable I have to keep walking and drop a few happy/sad tears. The way I still get a DELIGHTFUL sandwich here is by chickening out and sending a buddy or colleague. MMmmMM Prosciutto, Hot Coppa and Salame....don't forget the melt in your mouth headcheese!!

They do have seeded, soft and Dutch crunch ones in there.  Their roast beef isn't too bad, tender and not overly salty and the mustard they use is quite good.  It's a great place to get a sandwich for under $7 while some are over $8 and even better to pick up a box of the imported La Florentine Torrone from Italy for only $8.49!  (Victoria's Bakery on Stockton St sells it for nearly $10!) I love the delicious individually foil-wrapped then boxed orange, vanilla and lemon with almond nougat pieces.  They are heavenly and have no preservatives. The boxes of La Florentine Torrone are located on the shelf right above the bin of bread.  Some stores sell the individual boxes for 50-75 cents a piece for just a bite!  They're hard to find except in Italian delis or specialty stores.  I didn't have enough hands to get a box of their store made ravioli to carry home, but they sure look like the ones that Lucca Deli in the Mission sells.", "author": "Ry T."}

Definitely the best in the city, Molinari's reputation is based primarily on the quality of their cold cuts--mortadella, coppa, salame, roast turkey, cured roast beef, and particularly, prosciutto (even head cheese, if you're into that).  The trick with the Molinari sandwich is to avoid frills.  The idea is to appreciate the flavour of the meat itself (in Italy, a sandwich is typically just bread, meat, and cheese), therefore, when it comes to a Molinari sandwich, mayo and mustard are an abomination...this is the best tip i've ever been given.  Always say, \"No mustard, no mayo, only olive oil,\" and you can't go wrong.  The staff are fast, efficient, and friendly, and the place has a great old-world charm that seems to have largely gone missing in North Beach.  It's the best quick lunch i can think of, and the outside seating along Columbus is a great place to dig the neighbourhood.", "author": "J. Brandon L."}
