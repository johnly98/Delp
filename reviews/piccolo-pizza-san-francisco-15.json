The pizza was hot and fresh. It came with Parmesan cheese and hot peppers. \n\nI was in the mood for deep dish and Piccolo was one of the few places that delivered deep dish to me. The deep dish options on the menu are just with cheese. If you want other toppings you need to add them. To my surprise that I received was not deep dish, but actually cheese stuffed crust with regular pizza. And oh boy was it delicious! I would highly recommend it to anyone!", "author": "Alan H."}

It is combination of meats, lightly sauced, generously cheesed on a yummy non over-powering crust. The sauce is just the right tangy to compliment the ooey gooey of that cheese and the greasy of the meats. Perfect pie to soak up all the alcohol consumed beforehand or just as a late night treat.\n\nI can't guarantee,  but I believe this large pie is $20/$25 but the slices are so big and the cheese and meat plentiful that it takes only 1 to 2 slices to satisfy your craving and roaring beast of hunger. \n\nJust do it....you won't be disappointed!", "author": "AmErica A."}

A huge plus is that they are open until 3 am and deliver! Their pizza deals are also ridiculous. You can get two large two topping pizzas + 2 liter soda for $29. There isn't anything crazy about this pizza but definitely a solid pie that satisfies any pizza craving you are having. I love a good mushroom + sausage pizza and the delivery usually arrives within 30/45 minutes. I would really recommend this place any time of the day, especially if it's late at night and you really want some pizza", "author": "Eric L."}

The garlic bread was decent, garlicky with cheese melted on top. Yum . It came with a side of ranch which I thought was unusual- hoped it would be marinara or something. Pizza was quite good, definitely exceeded my expectations! Crust was light, dough was good. I thought the toppings were great too, reminded me of a combination pizza. Service was fast. If you eat in there are some tables and a small counter to sit at. They also sell individual slices, pasta, appetizers (onion rings, mozzarella sticks, jalape\u00f1o poppers, wings....). Overall solid no frills pizza and pasta!! Yum!!", "author": "Amanda C."}

This crust was homemade and hand-rolled/tossed on the premises, which should be the starting point for any pizza place with an iota of pride (Yes...I'm looking at you Round Table)\n\nThat said, my slices were just above average. From the choices displayed I ordered one chicken/spinach/pesto ($4) and one pepperoni ($3.25). Each slice was hefty. The crust was good but not great; a little too doughy for me...and not very sturdy.  The toppings were generous but the cheese didn't wow me. But my two slices filled the void in my tummy for just over seven bucks. 3.5 stars.\n\nPaying here was a clusterF. The people in front of us took a long time just to pay (several minutes). It turned out the credit card machine was having issues. They finally worked out a solution of some kind...not clear.  When it was our turn, my friend S. tried to pay with her card; but she got inscrutable results after two attempts.  So the counter guy asked for cash, which I happened to have. (But then S. felt the need to check her card statement to make sure she wasn't actually charged)  Why didn't they just post a sign saying \"Cash Only\"?\n\nBut I'd go here again if hungry, and I had cash on me. Though I'd probably look around a little more first.", "author": "Dan B."}

Cheap, delicious, fast delivery, a large pizza, and a unique taste all to itself, Piccolo is definitely on our rotation now.\n\nThe crust is different from others that we usually get in that it's somewhat sweeter, but still tasty. We ordered the Margherita pizza for the two of us for delivery. The order came in under the time estimate which was great and at a perfect temperature. \n\nTheir large was a good size for two people for a dinner with leftovers for the next day, provided you eat relatively normal sized portions. The denseness and volume of the cheese reminded me a lot like street food pizza you might get late at night, but way better quality. Overall the pizza just was some of the best I've had in this particular style.\n\nDon't let the looks fool you, this is some grade A pizza!", "author": "Cassandra J."}

The pizza was okay. This reminds me of Irving Pizza. If you are around here and are craving a slice of pizza, this will do the trick. The credit card minimum is $5.

They sell NY style thin crust pizza and it is the best tasting NY style pizza in San Francisco. In the East Bay my favorite place is Bluebird Pizza. \n\nYesterday, i put their pizza to the test ordering a cheese pizza and a chicken pesto pizza from several places and tasting them together. When compared - Piccolo's really stands out.  The cheese pizza stood out because the sauce was full of flavor and balanced the other flavors well. The sauce complimented the cheese and soaked flavor into the crust. I would not have realized how important the sauce was if I had not done the taste test. As for the chicken pesto, Piccolo's was also the clear winner. There were tons of whole leaf basel and the flavor was great. The other chicken pesto pizzas were somewhat bland tasting and had no fresh flavor in comparison (although they tasted good before I bit into the Piccolo Pizza). \n\nI cannot believe this place only has 3 stars. It makes me wonder if they are just rated average because they are not popular or because they are a hole-in-the-wall.  However, if you just want good taste - then go here.", "author": "MrandMs Squirrel S."}

We inquired again to where it was, and the guy pointed us happily toward the famed establishment, with a mouthful of pizza. \n\nFinally getting to the place, it was a bit busy for it being 12:30 am (probably normal for this place), and they had a bunch of pizzas just sitting out under the lamps. They looked really delicious, but I don't know why I didn't eat. My friends ordered the chicken/spinach and pepperoni pizza, along with a bunch of fries.

This YouTube clip pretty much sums it up: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_c7SbkGaLk\nIs that the old hag in \"The Princess Bride\" shouting \"BOOOOO! BOOOO!\" as Buttercup walks down the aisle? Yes, yes it is. Because that's exactly my reaction to Piccolo Pizza. BOOOOOO!\n\nOrdered a greek salad and added chicken breast for an extra $2, angel hair pasta with tomatoes and onions, and tiramisu. Instead, my roomie and I received:\n\n-caesar salad with chicken, DRENCHED with dressing -- dressing was so thin and watery that the lettuce and croutons were soggy. I had figured I'd get chicken breast that would then be sliced and served on top but instead got cooked chicken chunks. Not too big of a deal except they were overcooked and dry... I'm guessing they just heated up the pre-cooked chunks-o-chicken they use as pizza toppings but the extra step was unnecessary -- thanks to the heat-y chicken, the parmesan shavings melted and coagulated to form a weird, sweaty disk of cheese. On top of a salad. Grasping for eloquence but the only word that comes to mind is 'barf-tastic.' \n\n-spaghetti with marinara. Either they don't know the difference between angel hair and spaghetti, or they were lazy and didn't bother to call me to say they were out. Because maybe I wouldn't even notice the difference!!!!!!! Dude, I did. And I wouldn't have cared so much if you hadn't cooked the shit out of it. \n\n-tiramisu. I'll let you know how it tasted later. Unfortunately, it's frozen solid at the moment. \n\nWhen I called the tell them about the errors and request a refund, the guy said there wasn't anything he could do because I had prepaid for it via GrubHub. Then he told me to call the next day. It's very possible that the refund process is more complicated for GrubHub orders, but his tone and \"call back tomorrow\" felt extremely dismissive. He kept asking why I was requesting a refund -- BECAUSE YOU TOTALLY EFFED UP MY ORDER, that's why. I didn't even bring up the issue of quality. I hope all will be resolved but after reading a few of the other reviews here, I won't hold my breath.\n\nBut refund drama aside, that salad of theirs.... good god. Every time Piccolo Pizza serves that salad, a baby unicorn dies.\n\nUPDATE: GrubHub refunded the order. And there was much rejoicing.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

It's gotten much better here and I have yet to be hassled.\n\nOnce I ate here drunk and grabbed a shaker that I thought was cheese because it was in the cheese shaker.

What makes Piccolo good is great value, especially their coupon meal deals. Just hang onto the menu and mention the coupon when you order. I've even ordered online. Also, they deliver late for all of you who need to soak up some of the night's partying or if you're a night owl like me. Some of their other menu items are good, too, especially the chicken wings and don't forget to ask for their bleu cheese dressing. Even if you don't get one of the deals, they often throw in some soda. I also like that the meat is halal - turkey Canadian bacon is pretty good on the Hawaiian. Probably can't hurt to save a few calories if you're eating pizza which is not something I really care about, but it also keeps the pizza from getting too greasy as my friends who introduced me to the place say.\n\nI like this kind of pizza - chewy crust, lots of toppings, sauce that isn't too sweet, and lots of cheese.

After finishing off last night's impulse-buy extra large pizza, and eating 2 cans of soup and a box of unchicken nuggets, I still found myself craving grease, salt, and sugar. With a side of sauce. \n\nThese guys came to the rescue, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the results. Let me first point out that the customer service here ROCKS. Both the gentleman answering the phone and the very cute delivery boy (this is a Tunisian-run operation) were exceptionally friendly and very pleasant. It should also be noted that their prices are amazing and you'll be hard pressed to spend more than $20. My lasagna ($8) is HUGE. Like, it could feed 4 or 5 people easily. There are tons of fresh-tasting veggies in there and there's lots of nicely crisped cheese on top. It's extremely salty (and I *heart* salt), though and very acidic. On the upside, there is none of that freezer-burn taste so common among Pizza Delivery pastas. The mozzarella sticks ($5 for 6) were yummy but not as cooked as they could have been. A few minutes in the oven solved that. I also ordered Tiramisu ($3.25) in order to push my bill up so I could get a free 2 litre soda (on orders over $15). It's very good. \n\nI'd give them 4 stars based on the service and the short time it took them to get my food to me. I think it was about 35 minutes. But I'm going to have to 3-star them for now since even terribly hungover, the food wasn't that great. I really want to try their pizza and hopefully that will give me a legitimate reason to 4-star them for real.", "author": "Autumn K."}

I  ordered through one of those on line delivery portals that seem to only be able to sign up crappy restaurants like Paraat, Go- Getters, and the Front Room. The restaurants receive the orders in writing, so there shouldn't be any problems. Right? The delivery guy calls from his cell phone. He asks me to come wait by the door - while he parks his car!!!! That's a big, big, big, red flag that I am dealing with idiots. It's Saturday night. I live in the Theater District. He will not find parking easily. He doesn't know dick about door codes!  Anyway, I call the restaurant, and ask the lady to to call the driver. Tell him to use the door code when he gets here! He came in with one of my neighbors. I don't know what they are calling BC at Picccolo Italia, but it ain't salad dressing! This was a small container of warm, strangely flavored mily - looking water? It was white. Any, similarities between that substance and BC dressing ends there. The wings themselves were actually pretty good.  The burger had ONIONS, which I could smell the second I opened the bag. They weren't on the side (if they were I may have been able to avoid their taste), but on the burger itself. What does this mean? It means that my burger is going to taste like ONIONS! For all you people who work in restaurants, and just pick the onions off in situations like this and send it back out. People who hate onions, can still taste them! They have juice - you lazy people who shouldn't be working in restaurants in the first place! Simply picking the onions off does no good! It's called \"cross contamination\" just like with germs!  Anyway, I call back . The man who answered the phone can say \"hello\" in English  perfectly, and nothing else. When I finally get him to understand the problem. He gets flustered. I ask to speak to a manager or someone who  speaks English better than him He says - no one else is here. I say I know someone else is there  - I spoke to her less than 10 minutes ago! He says it again  and hangs up!! I call back.  He does it again! What the hell? I wait a bit, call again, the lady picks up. I explain the problem with the food, and about Mr. Hang up man. I can tell - it's not going to matter. Anyway, the guy uses the door code when he re-delivers the burger. It takes one minute for me to get to the door. I open it. He's not there!! He was sitting in his car! He comes up  with the bag. I close the door, turn around, and look at the sandwich.  I can't believe it! This  burger is prepared exactly the same way -  onions and all! I open the door. He's just getting into his, too expensive for just pizza money looking car.  I called him back up to the door. I ask him why this burger looks like the one I returned. He gives me this confused Scooby Doo looking stare. What's so hard to get about ketchup and mustard ONLY? When he finally understood the problem ('cuz it's sooo complicated) he gestures for me to just pick the onions off! I am furious by now. (Actually, I was full from the  wings - and furious! But, I could have cared less about the burger by then. Now, it's  just a matter of principle.  I would have paid for the right burger anyway.) I demand my money back on the spot, rather than let him leave with both bags like he wanted to do. He tries to grab for the bag in my hand, while pretending like he didn't have the 5.50. I'm like no way buddy. He finally coughs up 5.30 after much fumbling. Close enough! I gave him his 2 onion burgers back  and closed the door! Piccollo -never again!", "author": "ML G."}
