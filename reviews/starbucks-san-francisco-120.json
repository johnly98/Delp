For as tight as San Francisco may seem this location has a lot more space inside but pretty much nothing outside as far as tables or chairs.  The inside is wide and open and has ample seating and tables for the amount of people hanging out doing the SB thing seems spacious however neighbors can be rather loud if on the phone etc.\n\nStill for a place that's across the street at Zynga where all food and drink is pretty much given to all the employees this place is still lively enough with enough customers to be considered busy but with enough room during a weekday to accommodate people looking for a table and sit for a while.", "author": "Lambert P."}

My hunch is that it used to be the little nook with the child-size picnic table in the back, where the shelves are now stocked with merchandise. \n\nI came after the usual rush (around 4pm), where seating was aplenty and there was no line. I ordered my drink and discovered the mobile charging pads for the first time. Unfortunately, I could see very few wall charging outlets for my laptop. But I figured I might as well take advantage of the free power on (certain, not all) tables, and asked the barista how to use it. Without pausing in her potion-making, she kindly explained that I had to find one of the plastic rings hanging on the signs on the table. There would be one specifically for the USB port on my phone. And really, it's just that easy - take the color-coded charger (white for iPhone 5, the lightning port), then place the ring on the charging mat. There are some issues I already see with this: for people with bulky cases, you'll have to hold the ring in contact with the table to actually charge, and not all ports are supported. But that's not a Starbucks issue. \n\nSeating options abound. Love seats, window-side counters, personal tables, and communal workspaces all find a home here. There's a single bathroom stall in the back that smells faintly of urine. It's large, as are most Starbucks bathrooms, but a little less tended to. \n\nThe employees here just seem downright helpful. Besides my own experience, another person was being personally helped by an employee who explained to her which items were on sale and helped her figure out the pricing on items one by one. Another also went around and politely warned us that they would be closing in 20 min. Verdict? A chill place to study in a nice area, if you avoid the peak times and have enough battery on your laptop.", "author": "Helen S."}

I will always go with a Pete's over a Starbucks given a choice, but that isn't always the choice. I don't hate Starbucks coffee, it will do in a pinch. \nThis particular Starbucks, however, is worse than that standard one. The coffee is on par, the staff is as friendly as always, the store is pretty spacious, but there is a lingering smell. This is about a half block down from where I work, so I frequent it and that smell is always there. I can't even describe the smell, but it isn't pleasant and that doesn't bode well for a place where I'm purchasing food items. \nHowever, I gave it 3 stars because apparently the smell isn't strong enough to make me not come back.", "author": "Scott C."}

It was back in 2008 when I was on a leisure trip to California starting from the north of the state to the south. It's funny, but I'm now thinking the coffee I got there was literally the first American drink I had on American land, since my plane arrived at 6am and on the way to the hotel I told the cab driver to stop immediately when I saw the Starbucks logo when passing by. Oh, I digress.\nSo, I've been to some European locations, and honestly they all look kind of the same, and this one wasn't way different, but the atmosphere was great. I guess it was because of the people, though, there weren't many of them early in the morning. What I saw was really nice staff, people looking busy as honey bees, giving a burst of energy to the whole cafeteria. This, perhaps, was my first touch to the real American people.\nI got my usual caramel latte and the taste was quite the same as always, only it was served with really big smiles. I love the way people here always smile, and address you all the time with mister, miss, etc. It is nice, makes you feel special.\n\nI know this isn't a real review, but this is how I felt it, and this is how I remember it. And since I had really good times in Cali, and this Starbucks was where it all started, there are these kind of romantic thoughts when I'm writing this, and they make me want to go again at the exact same Starbucks for a new adventure!", "author": "Marcy W."}
