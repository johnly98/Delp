I had to go in. I'm weak. \n\nI ordered a breakfast sandwich that had bacon, egg, and Gouda between two buttery biscuits, and ordered a treat for to go. More on the treat later.!\n\nThe sweet woman working behind the counter warmed up my sandwich and when she brought it to me, she told me she can warm it up more if I'd like. I had to ask for it to be warmed more. Not her fault. Just the way the biscuit crumbles. Am I right? Anyway...the sandwich was good! She warmed it up for probably 4 minutes total but the egg and cheese was still a little cold. I blame Karl (the fog). Looking past this minor dilemma, the breakfast sandwich was good! I say 4/5. \n\nSo this treat was a beer custard filled donut. What?! I'm crazy like that and had to try it. Even though it the beer was cooked down, I waited until work was over to eat it. I...was not into it. It was a strong beer taste, which should have been cool, but it did not work for me. I would much rather have a beer and a donut together by not as one. Also, I found the pastry part too bready instead of light and fluffy donut, which totally bummed me out. 1/5 for this. Heartbroken, really.\n\nI am willing to give another one of their sweet treats a try, but I need some time o get over this donut situation.", "author": "Jess G."}

My friend and I arrived on Saturday, January 20th around 12:15pm.\n\nI ended up getting a few donuts: Lemon curd, Sugar, Glazed and a Banana fritter. I grabbed them for takeout, so I had the lemon curd doughnut when I got home. I liked the flavor of the curd, but I found the donut to be way too bready. And it wasn't sweet enough. I think it would have benefited from a sugar coating to give it that sweetness. I felt the same way about the banana fritter. Good flavor in the center with the fresh banana, but still too bready. The sugar and glazed were more of the same.\n\nI feel bad giving this spot such a low rating as I love my neighborhood spots. But their donuts just weren't up my alley. I like mine light and fluffy and these were dense and bready. One of my friends raves about their pies. Especially the buttery crust. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong items?

It's that good. \n\nMy favorites so far have been the fritters; one time they had a strawberry banana fritter and that was just so yummy. The other time I tried their savory scone, which was zucchini and feta...also amazing and spicy!\n\nIt's a tiny place and I have a feeling the people who run it are a bit overwhelmed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-18", "description": "Jamie W. and I stumbled upon this charming little bakery because there just happen to be an open parking space when we arrived in this little neighborhood. We had no itinerary for our Outer Richmond field trip but a sweet nosh sounded good, so we lived in the moment, or more like a \"moment on the lips, a lifetime on the hips\" moment. Gee, I didn't know that owner Esa Yonn-Brown was the pie half of the late, not all that lamented Pig & Pie in the Mission. I mostly gorged on the pig side of menu but had a slice of her Butter Pie once and it was indeed buttery and quite delicious.\n\nPaula Deen was wrong about so many things but not about the butter. Once we entered the space, we saw several content-looking consumers amid the many delectables spread out in a tidy fashion on the counter (photo: http://bit.ly/2nDipDG). The sweet and savory galettes looked good, so did the seasonable fruit buckle and of course, the large scones which I understand were a legacy leftover from the previous occupant, another bakeshop called Nibs. We settled on a couple of the $3 Cowboy Cookies which looked fresh, thick, and most inviting (photo: http://bit.ly/2mePrwZ).\n\nWe only found out about them when we were up in the woods of Cazadero at Raymond's Bakery and tried a most luxuriant one (photo: bit.ly/1PL5pVx). This one was also really good with a hodgepodge of classic cookie ingredients - chocolate chips, coconut, pecans, rolled oats and presumably a whole lot of butter to keep it all together. It was like the greatest hits of homemade cookies packaged into one. With picnic benches and lots of well tended foliage, the casual back patio was an idyllic setting to nosh on our cookies and plot out our day (photo: http://bit.ly/2nlrfJ1). I can see why regulars come here in a constant stream.\n\nCOOKIES - 4 stars...the classic cowboy cookie, well turned\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...quaint inside, bucolic outside, very \"neighborhoody\"\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a small business serving quality baked goods is always worth supporting", "author": "Ed U."}

Before I could taste anything, the smells and sights told me that I wouldn't be disappointed. Sure enough the goodies lived up to the expectations one would have of butter AND love!   \n\nMy favorites are the savory gallettes which are easy to eat while driving. I live in the Sunset but occasionally drop off my son at Wash High, which is the perfect excuse to grab breakfast at BL. From pies to quiches, to choc chip cookies and ham/cheese croissants, BL never disappoints.\n\nInitially, I was annoyed at the limited coffee selection since there is only one kind and one size coffee. What you do get is a cup of flavorful, medium roasted joe. In time I came to realize that the coffee actually showcases the baked goods. I really don't need another Starbuck experience, and BL does it right by offering one simple, quality cup of coffee. Another issue I initially had was spending what seemed too much at a bakery. I don't think I've ever walked out having spent less than twenty-something dollars. Then I looked at what I actually purchase on any given visit. In fairness, it can be two gallettes, coffee, hot chocolate, a slice of cake, a ham & cheese croissant, and maybe a cookie---of coarse I'm going to spend money! It is all well worth it.\n\nSo even if I try to find something to complain about (and believe me, I always find it), Butter Love can do no wrong!\n\nYet, I wouldn't be myself without at least one complaint:  some Mondays, I forget it's the day they close and I head over. At the locked door I realize my mistake and my heart breaks. No Butter Love for me that day.", "author": "Angie A."}

It has a lot of Outer Richmond charm by keeping it simple, charming, and kindaaa rustic? There's a back patio, but it looks like it needs a little TLC.\n\nThe coffee is straight forward and simple, and iced coffee isn't more expensive than regular coffee! I'll try a latte in the future, and it would also be cool to see the coffee get more fancy but still simple (??) in the future! But this is a BAKERY not a coffee shop...\n\n..the pastries. Goddamn. I'm so happy that they have a ton of savory options! I believe the selection depends on the day, but there was a quiche, savory bread pudding, sandwiches, pot pies, and some other savory thing I never heard of. The sweets look great too! I tried the bread pudding made out of their ham and cheese croissants. It was SO tasty. Not overpowered or salty by the ham, still maintaining the integrity of the croissant, but with added moisture from.. IDK how bread pudding is made! But I'm definitely coming back to try more -\u00a0my only problem is having to pace myself so I don't gain weight!!\n\nThe owner and cashier were very nice and answered all my questions. They seemed a little nervous for whatever reason, but I promise y'all are doing great! The prices are not cheap, but they're not crazy expensive either! It really depends on what you get, but I believe they range from $2.50-6? I hope that this place does well, but somehow stays under the radar still! With how delicious the pastries are, I can see it getting busy and selling out!\n\nSome suggestions: music was a little loud when I came, so the other customers were kinda shouting at one another to talk, which made it hard to study lol. There's room for improvement in terms of the coffee and pastry menu. If I didn't come in wanting coffee, I'm not sure I would have seen the menu! Maybe put it at the register?

It's one block past the Balboa Theatre, and I'm very sorry I didn't notice it sooner!!!\n\nWe bought 4 types of baked goods - \n\nThe mixed berry gallette was utter perfection.  How did they do the crust so perfectly?  Nicely tart flavor.  My European husband was thrilled with this one, because American baked goods are often too sweet for him.\n\nThe chocolate cherry scone was soft, not too sweet, and the tart dried cherries were a perfect compliment.  We all agreed we would have liked a few more cherries, though - a little cherry per bite would be ideal.\n\nThe parmesan and rosemary scone was perfectly balanced.\n\nThe savory ham bread pudding was great - the texture was divine.  We just thought it needed a bit more bite to it - just a slightly sharper flavor would have added to it  maybe scallions or onion or sharp cheddar...\n\nThe customer service was great:  friendly and quick.  The place also looked very clean, too.\n\nI was also happy to see a 9-person-long line; it's great when local businesses are thriving.

Prior to this shop opening, I had never heard of Butter Love Bakeshop or tried any of their baked goods (as some of the other reviewers had). I only saw this opening on Yelp and decided to check it out. The actual shop was pretty hard to find since there is no awning or large bold sign. You can easily drive by and miss it (which I did). When I walked in, the shop was empty with bare yellow walls, wooden tables, and light blue chairs. It resembled a homey cottage, except it almost looked like they hadn't finish decorating. There was an elegant display of their baked goods on the front counter, which was mostly out in the open. \n\nI tried the chocolate chip cookie ($2.50), which was large, sweet, and delicious. I also had their apple cheddar scone ($3), which was good, but a tad on the bland side. I probably would have chosen another flavor, but that was the only savory flavor they had available. They also offer a variety of pies and baked good including chicken pot pie, filled donuts, plain and savory croissants, breakfast sandwiches, and many more. They also serve Mr. Espresso coffee, which is a local, Bay Area coffee roaster. Majority of their baked goods were room temperature, but they can heat it up for you upon request. \n\nButter Love Bakeshop is definitely a nice addition to the local neighborhood. It's family owned and operated and the products are offered with much butter and love. There is also additional seating outside on their back patio.

Though, to be fair, my gold standard is the fresh-out-of-the-fryer doughnuts from Kingpin in Berkeley, and that's hard to beat.\n\n* Brown Butter Snickerdoodle Cookie - I'm not really a huge fan of snickerdoodle in general, so I may be biased here, but at the recommendation of the staff, and hearing that this wasn't a flavor they usually do, I picked up one. And, while nice and soft, I found the overall flavor to be a bit lacking and bland.\n\n* Chocolate Chip Cookie - Like the snickerdoodle cookie, this too, was fantastically soft when it was fresh. And, while not too sweet, as chocolate chip cookies tend to be, it had the opposite problem of being a little too bitter for my liking.\n\n* Mango Brown Butter Scone - By far my favorite pastry of the batch, with that nice crispy crust, strong mango flavor, and just a hint of sweetness to top it all off. While not as good as the ones at Arizmendi, it's definitely something I'd stop in for again.\n\nNow, we had also been eyeing all the various pies, both sweet and savory, that they had on display there, ultimately not picking up any of them. Apparently this was a mistake, according to other reviewers, so I'll reserve further judgment until next time.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - While not exactly small, the part of the bakery that's open to the public is only about the front third of the shop. Seating is a bit limited, so I'd suggest stopping in, picking up your goodies, and leaving. Both the counter display and the register are around your typical dining table height, so neither visibility nor getting and paying for your pastries should be an issue.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

It's an inevitable habit that has me searching for new bakeries to try. I've tried Marla's and yes they're good, but Butter Love Bakeshop is definitely going to give Marla's some competition. Located in Richmond district it Butter Love Bakeshop blends in with its surrounding with its minimalist exterior. \n\nThe inside of BLB is awkwardly spacious, as if they forgot to add furniture or decor. Maybe it's the new hipster way of decorating, who knows. At the front counter, their baked goods are on display; I could almost count the number of pastries on display with my fingers. There was such a low supply which made me wonder if they make fresh batches once the ones in display sell out. Not sure. As far as their inventory  they had: croissants, donuts, chocolate chip cookies, blueberry cake and some cheese Danishes. \n\nAs soon as I saw the blueberry cake, I went in for it. Their slices are pretty big, which makes up for the $4.50 price. The pastry itself satisfied my sweet tooth; it was spongy but not overly moist which is always one of my pet peeves when eating pastries. I was pleased with my blueberry cake slice choice. I also tried my coworkers chocolate chip cookie and it was fine. I like that it had coconut flakes (I'm obsessed with coconut anything). \n\nI'd say this a good place to pick up goodies during a sweet tooth craving. Def not a place where I'd go to sit and have coffee with a friend. The interior needs to be more welcoming and cozier for me to want to hang out here, but hey the baked goods are yummy!", "author": "Stefany Z."}

I occasionally stop in for a cup of coffee, a cookie or a savory scone and it's a generally quiet place to enjoy some time to myself. Most of the time, I'll get a pie and I have always been pleased - whether it's when the pie has been pre-ordered or just to get a slice to go. The pies are seasonal, so bear that in mind - this is not a place where you want sticky, sweet stuff in the pie -- these pies showcase the fruit and the crust is amazing. My personal favorite is their peach pie.  I have ordered pies from this shop for awhile, right around the time they first opened their doors and love their variety of pies - all made with love and talent.

I love supporting local businesses, especially ones that put their roots in neighborhoods with less activity. But I left this bakery with a very bad taste in my mouth (figuratively speaking, because they clearly didn't want to sell me a pastry).\n\nIt was not busy when I arrived at 8 am, and since I'd never been, I asked the man behind the counter what some of the items were. WOW, you think I'd ask him to remove a wart from my foot. NO smile, ZERO friendliness, and acted like that was the last place in the world he wanted to be. He has to ask the baker a question at one point so she came out to the counter, and she was the same way - totally apathetic as though they were doing me a huge favor by identifying a few items to a new customer.\n\nThat's exactly what I don't want when I'm overpaying for a couple of pastries - a side of scowl. \n\nMaybe this place should rethink its attitude toward customers if they want to survive in the Outer Richmond, a close knit neighborhood where a smile goes a long way.\n\nWhat a disappointment.

Decor is fresh, clean, and welcoming. Joshua and Isa had an array of scrumptious-looking baked goods on the counter.  I selected 2 spinach & parmesan scones, a savory beef & cheddar hand-held pie, and a PB&J donut.\n\n--scones: tasty, but admittedly, my heart still pines for Nibs' (the former bakery in this location) spectacular scones.  \n--beef & cheddar pie: Hot out of the oven, this was great.  The crust was a little crisp and not too doughy, and the beef/cheddar/pea filling was generous and well-flavored.  At $5, I considered this a pretty good deal; it's certainly a lot bigger than the empanadas sold at a certain well-known SF empanada shop.\n--PB&J donut: this was not consumed until about 6 hours later, shared with my husband and son.  The donut has an appealingly complex, yeasty flavor that I much prefer to the standard donut shop.  The dough is also a bit denser/heavier than typical donut shop donut. The PB&J was piped in through the top--standard PB&J.  I like this and would try other flavors.  It probably would be even better if eaten fresh at time of purchase.\n\nFor anyone who is curious about what happened to Nibs:  The owners told me that it wasn't the rent of the business space, but rather, the rent of the house they were renting.  Single homes are not rent control-protected, and their owner jacked up the rent something like triple what they were paying.  Since they have dogs, finding something equivalent they could afford seemed impossible.  They told me they were moving to Placerville.  Big loss for our city and our neighborhood.  I'm happy that Butter Love Bakeshop is here, though.  It's a good alternative to those who find Marla's prices too high.", "author": "Karen C."}

They can't help the view, but they could fence off their garbage area (or at least pick up the cardboard boxes) and do some landscaping.  \n\nWe sat inside, and there was a constant, loud, horrible buzzing noise that nearly drove us out of the place.  I don't know how anyone can work with that noise.  I believe it was coming from the florescent lights.  A row of about a dozen tubes line the center of the ceiling, but only two of them were illuminated.  The burnt out ones probably cause the buzz.  This place is lucky to have several skylights in addition to the front window, and there was so much natural light that the electric lights were not needed.

I have tried almost every pastry in there, brought my friends and made them try them and EVERYTHING IS GREAT. And then I ordered a pie yesterday, an apple sounds plain enough, you think how is a plain old apple pie going to be amazing, but it's fall so there's not many other fruits around so I went for it......WHY OH WHY DIDN'T I GET A SECOND ONE SO I COULD EAT IT ALL BY MYSELF?!?!?!?!?!? Filling was simply flavorful apples, thinly sliced so they cooked perfectly and the crust!!!!!!! It was like a layered flaky croissant made into a pie crust. It was flaky and light and hearty at the same time.", "author": "Susanne A."}

I crave their homemade biscuits with cheese and bacon every week but need to make sure I get over there early before they're sold out. I always get a cowboy cookie for later and a galette for the husband.  Unfortunately for hubby, the poodle got to the galette first and really enjoyed it ;)  I'll have to make sure the goodies are not in the dog's reach next time! The scones are great as are all of the cookies. Highly recommend!", "author": "L H."}

Yelped this place and it was closing in 5 minutes but I made it in time. They had their chocolate chip cookies, which look amazing, in a big glass jar, but they also had some fresh on a cookie sheet. I asked for four cookies and requested the ones that hadn't yet gone in the jar because I wanted them more crisp (they soften in a closed container). My request for something sweet was met with a sour response of \"No these in the jar are left from yesterday and we need to sell them first.\" I politely asked again but more pointedly, and explained my reason, and she refused.  So, brilliant baker people, not only didn't you sell the old a$$ cookies baked yesterday (seriously? I thought bakeries sold day old stale items at a discount anyway!!), but you didn't sell any cookies at all. Not to mention. I will never come to your lame bakery again. Clearly customer service is not a priority at this weak establishment.", "author": "Steve B."}

Cute shop to enjoy a bite, esp. on a rainy day.  Bought an apple galette & a buckle (you read that right): the galette pie crust was made by the owner's 10-year old daughter, and it's pretty good...flaky & buttery.   Buckle is interesting: a little denser than the galette, but the milk chocolate chips with kumquat peels inside give this pastry a nice balance of sweet and citrus tartness.", "author": "Jessica S."}

Sadly, the piles of undercooked dough had to be thrown out.
