Flash forward one year and countless visits from both my NY local Bay Area family and let's just say we go out of our way to eat here as much as we can! For appetizers we order the Poh Pier Tod #1, the Garden Rolls #14, the Satay #2, and the Katong Thong #8. Honestly, we could probably get full of these appetizers and end our day BUT their dishes are to die for too. Our go to dish every time we visit is the #21 Pad Kee Maou and ask for it medium spicy or spicy if you yourself is feeling spicy! For the less adventurous, #37 is essentially a Thai dish similar to Beef and Broccoli and tasty as well. \nHonestly, you can't go wrong at this place...plus the waiters and waitresses are so kind and helpful with suggestions based on what you like and don't like!", "author": "Vanessa O."}

We came around 6 and it was not crowded yet and very small and cute.  We order the following #9 angel wings, #37 Chinese w broccoli with beef and # 68 assorted veggies pineapple tofu tomatoes in sweet and sour sauce song with some steamed rice.  The chicken wings came out and it was stuffed with something but wow I really liked it and I liked all the veggies and noodles it came with. I have to admit when our main entrees came out we practically devoured the Chinese broccoli with beef dish. I so would come back for just that alone!  The sweet and sour dish was just ok to me as I felt like it was too sweet for me but I still ate it. Our waitress always kept our glasses of water topped off and she checked on us just enough too. We ended up sharing dessert with was fried banana and coconut ice cream!  Wow that dish was more than enough for the both of us and the best way to end a good dinner too.  I definitely will be back to this place if ever in the area again.

Trust me, I have tried the green curry at pretty much every place north of Market. The green curry comes piping hot (this is really important to me), great spicy heat (pretty spicy, but not uncomfortable), and the chicken is high quality. I have tried with beef too and would probably get it again. \n\nOther things I have had:\n\nThe #62 soup - it's delicious, but I think it was a bit lemony for me or maybe was too much salt. Hard to tell - I give it a 3/5 and worth trying if you love Thai soup, but not something I would order over the pad see ew or the green curry. \n\nPad See Ew - not on the menu, but it's a classic Thai dish that they can make and it's also the best in the city (my opinion). I have had the green curry and pad see ew at Lemongrass and it's just not quite on the same level as Yukol Place. \n\nGreat wait staff that pours you enough Thai Tea to put you in the stratosphere. Ambiance in there is very old school zen. \n\nP.S. if you google some of the top Thai places in SF, you'll come across Kin Khao which is delicious, but I waited over an hour and every dish was over $25. It's not somewhere I would rush back to. However, if you don't mind spending a little extra and you can get a reservation on open table, you will enjoy, but I don't think it's better than Yukol. Yukol is much more traditional and it's everything you want in a Thai restaurant.", "author": "Ryan A."}

I'd never been to Yokol before but, have driven/walked past it a million times so I figured why the heck not. My order was pretty close to their \"quittin time\" so, I took my food to go and ate at the neighboring bar, Monohans. \n\nMy order (chicken pad thai, cucumber salad) took all of 5 mins to prep (one of the many reasons I love Thai food) and it was piping hot when I opened it. I started with the salad and found their traditional dressing to be pretty good. Let's be honest, it's sugar, vinegar, and lime juice. Yum. The pad thai was cooked really well and the noodles were really comforting. I'm usually not a huge fan of tofu but, that was also solid. I'm aware that pad thai is probably the most \"gringo\" order at a Thai restaurant but, it's an easy go to and tough to screw up. \n\nAll in all, it's a good option for cheap eats in the Marina area. I believe my total bill was around $15 bucks, so you can't beat that. The service was friendly and seems like it's a family run spot. I'll be back...", "author": "Benjamin F."}

It was a very simple salad with nuts, but the vinaigrette made it special.\n\nI also had the You and Me Spring Rolls! This is very, very similar to a dim sum dish in which basically a steam roll skin is wrapped outside of a regular spring roll. This gives more texture/distinction with the soft and fluffy skin of the steam roll and the crunch of a spring roll! I would say that this is one of the must-trys, although a little bit pricy for what it is.\n\nAnother appetizer we had is the duck larb (cooked in chilli pepper, onions, fresh mint leaves, and lime dressing with a touch of rice powder). Oh my, this is probably one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life. The duck skin was crispy, crunchy, and the meat was incredibly tender. The dish was just full of herbs, spices and was savory - a true appetizer in the sense that it completely \"open your stomach and appetite.\" This is a must try from this restaurant.\n\nI also ordered the Tom Yum Goong (Spicy and sour prawn soup with mushroom, onion, lemongrass, slices of tomatoes and lemon leaves). This was very surprising because I was expecting the thick, coconuty type of soup base, but this is very light and without the coconut flavor. It still retained the spicy and sour essences of Thai food.\n\nOn top of the food, the service was excellent. I felt like I was having a three course meal with the server bringing salad, appetizer, and then entrees out timely.\n\nI want to go back to San Fran to go to this place again :(", "author": "Sophie C."}

I ordered the Pad Thai (#56) and the Phrik Khing Gai Kung (#19) for pick-up.  I was super in the mood for Pad Thai and unfortunately wasn't completely wow-ed by Yukol's but it was pretty good.  It has an authentic and casual feel to the restaurant and definitely see myself coming back here for Thai in the Marina.", "author": "Eric M."}

It's either super white-washed, tasteless, or extremely expensive (usually a terrible combination of all three).  When Gatip Thai closed down, Husband and I panicked: where were we going to get our Thai food fix without spending an arm and a leg at Osha??\n\nSo we decided to explore the neighborhood a bit and ended up at Yukol Place.  It's relatively empty usually during the weeknights, but I noticed they do quite a bit of delivery or take-out service.  Great, because we get better service - and they are really wonderful and nice here.\n\nWe LOVE the crispy spring rolls, the fried shrimp appetizer, and the prawns in a clay pot with glass noodles.  Freaking delicious.  I also ordered a soup one time, which was basically a clear broth laden with glass noodles, chicken and pork, and lots of veggies.  The perfect chilly SF night meal (or if you're sick and want a nontraditional chicken noodle soup).\n\nPrices are super reasonable - definitely way less than Osha.  There's a pretty good selection of different meat or veggie dishes and curries.  Plus, the portions are generous - perfect for a starving CCG after a day of work and volunteering.\n\nSeriously friendly service - I'm a huge fan of this place, and I'm glad we can put it into our Thai food rotation.", "author": "Tori S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-21", "description": "YUKOL PLACE THAI CUISINE\nThis is one of the best Thai restaurants I've eaten at. After a long day in the city, my friends and I were starving and were looking for some good Thai food to fill our growling stomachs! We walked by a couple Thai restaurants before deciding on Yukok Place Thai Cuisine, based on the number of clientele and nice-looking/authentic Thai environment and decorations. We were immediately greeted with friendly service, and without further adieu, we opened up one of the most fancy-looking Thai menus (with a portrait of a Thai woman and binded with wooden coverings on the outside). With lots of choices to choose from, we decided upon the following:\n\n1) Kaeng Karee Gai: boneless chicken in mild yellow curry with potato cubes -- this Thai curry was delicious!!! Very creamy, thick, and tasty, the curry was the perfect topping to the steamed rice. The curry was good enough that even without meat, I would enjoy it just with rice. Be that as it may, the chicken was tender and soft. Delicious! \n\n2) Ped Yang: boneless roast duck in honey, black bean and ginger sauce served in a bed of steamed spinach and cabbage -- this dish was an absolute delight! the duck was savory and the honey/black bean/ginger sauce gave it a nice sweetness.\n\n3) Three Amigos: combination of saut\u00e9ed shrimp, chicken, and scallops -- with three choices of meat, what's there to complain about! Slightly spicy, this dish went well with rice. With a variety of veggies to round out the meatiness, the Three Amigos was an excellent House Special that everyone should order.\n\n4) Angel Wings: boneless chicken wings stuffed with silver noodles, black fungus and chicken, served with sweet and sour sauce -- this was one of the most unique appetizers that I have ever tried. Not your traditional chicken wings, these were stuffed and dipped in a sweet and sour sauce that was perfect! You can taste the crispiness of the roasted chicken wings with the chewiness of the stuffing!\n\n5) Pad Thai: pan-fried Thai style rice noodles with shrimp, tofu, ground peanuts, egg, and bean sprouts in tamarind sauce -- this was one of the best Pad Thai I have ever tasted! The noodles were delightfully chewy and the sweet sauce was perfect. They gave lots of shrimps in this dish, so if you're a seafood lover, try this Pad Thai!!! Add some lime, and it's perfection! Best of all, the Pad Thai wasn't dry at all! I enjoyed the Pad Thai so much, I had to order another one for take-out for lunch the following day!\n\nI love this place!!! Combined with the excellent ambiance of traditional Thai decorations, the service was very friendly; the owner even taught us how to say \"thank you\" in Thai (even though I already forgot how to say it)! The prices were very reasonable, ranging from $9.50-$12.00 a dish, on average. Give Yukol Place Thai Cuisine a try; you won't be sorry! You'll find yourself coming back over and over again!", "author": "Stanley C."}

The coconut milk soup helps you warm up on a cold night, but it's nothing worth savoring over.  II experimented with the garlic quail, which was tender and cooked well.  When I asked about the garlic quail, the waitress couldn't tell me much except it was good.  However, it was so difficult to eat that it ruined my appetite.  Even the dessert was just okay with large fried chunks of banana, paired with coconut ice cream and whipped cream.  I've had it made better with smaller slices of banana to complement the ice cream, which shoes this place may lack the initiative and attention to detail just to get the dish out.  \n\nService is fast and friendly, but not helpful for recommending good dishes.

Chicken and crispy noodles were in separate dishes, and a platter of chopped limes, bell peppers, peanuts, and ginger were presented alongside. \n\n-Woon sen soup (glass noodle soup): Just what we needed-- hot, savory clear chicken broth with lots of yummy vegetables, tofu, chicken, and thin glass noodles. Portion would serve two, or three people at most.\n\n-Vegetarian pad thai: Good. The noodles are a lot thinner than I'm used to at other Thai restaurants, but the flavor was nice.\n\nYukol's exterior is unassuming, but inside it's warm, intimiate and inviting. Service is polite and friendly, and they were quick to refill our water and Thai Jasmine tea without us asking. If I lived in the Marina, I'd definitely come back again, or get takeout service.", "author": "Elaine C."}

There isn't a lot of Thai restaurant in the city that offers authentic taste, this one definitely made the list! \n\nOnce you open the door to Yukol Place you are greeted with a gush of curry smell. Yummmy! The place feels very classy with dim lighting and candle burning on every table. I loved how their napkin has a rose printed on there. \n\nWe ordered the Katong Thong for appetizer which is crispy buttercup filled with small dried shrimps, green peas, and diced chicken, served with cucumber salad on the side. YUMMMMYYY! It was SO delicious! We wanted to order another one but decided to wait and see if we still have room after we get our main dishes. \n\nI ordered the Kaeng Panang (spicy red curry) with chicken with bamboo shoot, carrot, and mushrooms, it was very tasteful. It was my first time trying red curry since i always order either the yellow or green curry at other Thai restaurants. It has just the right amount of spiciness for my taste, but the boyfriend said it could use a bit more kick. The chicken however was a bit on the dry side, but it was not horrible. I did see the table next to us ordered the Kaeng Ped which is boneless roast duck in red curry. I have to give that a try next time i come to Yukol. \n\nHe ordered the Pad Thai. I am not a big fan of Pad Thai because it's a bit too sweet for my taste. So the Pad Thai here was no difference to me. I took a few bites and went straight back to my delicious curry! \n\nThe servers here are all very nice. The service is quick and the dishes have good presentations. I highly recommend the Katong Thong and red curries! I will definitely be back for some more authentic Thai food!", "author": "Jenny G."}

For what they charge, the quality of the ingredients should be higher.\n\nIn the past when I've ordered rice, the rice came in pot; this past time we received one small pressed cup mound and that's it.

At Yukol, you can enjoy a comfortable atmosphere (not pretentious), genuine service, and some tasty authentic Thai food. \n\nWe started with the Chicken Satay and were pleasantly surprised by the tender chicken and complex peanut dipping sauce paired with a delicate cucumber salad. \n\nFor the main course, we wanted to try both a noodle and curry dish so we opted for: #27 KAENG DANG ( Choice of beef, chicken, or pork in medium spicy red curry with bamboo shoots, cauliflower, baby corn, bell pepper, and a touch of basil) with chicken. \nWe also ordered the: # 56 PAD THAI ( Pan-fried Thai style rice noodles with shrimp, tofu, ground peanuts, egg and bean sprouts in tamarind sauce.) with chicken instead of shrimp as well as a side of rice.\nBoth dishes were packed with flavor and the generous portions were great for sharing. \n\nDue to the portion size we had some leftovers and opted to have them packed. The check was paid promptly and we waited several more minutes for our to-go bag. Assuming that they forgot we exited the restaurant (it was really not a big deal and the packed portion was very small). However, to our surprise what I believe was one of the owners followed us outside apologizing and handing us a full order of the delicious PAD THAI. Apparently there was some confusion in the kitchen and our to-go portion had been discarded so they took the time to fix a full order to-go. Not many restaurants offer this level of caring and service.\n\nOverall, the food was good and the service was great.

It was less than 12 hours before the big race, and Lovie and I were ready for some no holds barred carb fest. Since we ate some rather dismal Spaghetti Factory spaghetti the night before, we were ready for a change. I brought up a Thai place that was in the area (Tom Yum), but to my disappointment, it closed down. This place was just steps away from our hotel, and looked pretty busy, so we thought, \"Why not?\"\n\nThe atmosphere was nice, cozy, romantically candlelit. We were seated next to the window next to another Asian girl-Caucasian guy couple, whom I noticed during our dining experience were pretty square. Oh well. \n\nThe service here is impeccable, along with the food:\n\nSoup:\nWe had the #16 Tom Yum Goong. A hot and sour prawn soup with lemongrass and tomatoes. Two words: yum yum! The perfect start to dinner on one chilly night. The spice and sour hit spots on the palate that I normally wouldn't have. Very similar to a Filipino soup dish that uses tamarind powder for the spice. The whole clay pot bowl was killed within minutes.\n\nMain Dishes:\n#24 Pad Ka Meur - chinese eggplant with prawn and chicken sauteed in a garlic chili sauce. This was delish! One of my favs, though, Lovie didn't care so much for it. The eggplant was cooked perfectly...still somewhat tender, but not mushy. \n\n#56 Pad Thai - Pad Thai me baby...I love how every came separated so I got to mix it. Since I'm not a big fan of bean sprouts, I was able to control the bean sproutage. \n\nAll this with cups of jasmine rice, a Tiger beer, and hot Thai tea, we demolished everything.

The knock on here is that the menu is relatively small, and one of my friends ordered something that looked almost exactly like mine....", "author": "Jon H."}

I'm not a Thai food expert, so all you Thai food enthusiasts may disagree.  But, for the everyday citizen looking for some quality Thai food that bursts with flavors...order from here.\n\nI especially like the Green Curry.  And, I usually DISLIKE Pad Thai.  However, I tried my friend's and it was the best I've ever had.  Get the sticky mango rice too.  Sooo good.  So much better than Osha.

We were were the only two customers in the place.  Shortly after we sat down a well dressed woman knocked at the closed door.  We heard her explain to the waitress if she could order takeout for five as she was on her way to Napa!  Sure enough they let her in as she waited for her order.\n\nNeedless to say we were impressed but the biggest surprise of all was the lunch--complete with soup, salad and entree.

We had spring rolls, green papaya salad and pepper beef (the pad thai is for tomorrow). I was so impressed. The food was hot, delivered faster than we expected and utterly delicious. I'm putting them on autodail tomorrow!\nThe pepper beef came with a HOT sauce that I thoroughly enjoyed and included a large wedge of salad to wrap it in (I just ate the lettuce and had the beef on rice), the green papaya salad was generous and included plenty of peanuts. The spring rolls came with a sweet sauce and was vegetarian (I think). A great meal.

Or maybe I've been spoiled by a vacation in Thailand or living in Berkeley for 4 years, but either way after reading all the positive reviews from yelp my only reponse can be... seriously?!? My first time here was definitely a one star experience, but I was dragged back by a friend, the name of the restaurant hadn't rung a bell, but the minute I walked in, the lightbulb went off. But by then it was too late to walk out, and we had already spent a good hour arguing over where to eat in the first place.\n\nLuckily my 2nd experience was better than my 1st. But my expectations were extremely low and I was starving. \n\nStarted with Angel Wings - Which I had actually remembered having my first time, it's usually a really good thing or a really bad thing if I remember only one specific dish. In this case, it was a good thing, cause it was the best thing about the meal last time and the best thing about the meal this time. It was piping hot, the chicken was perfectly crispy, and the vermicelli misture inside was cooked wonderfully.\n\nKAENG DANG(Red curry with Pork) - last time I had the green with pork and it was very disappointing. But the red fared better, needed more spice though.\n\nPAD MA KEUR (Saut\u00e9ed prawn and chicken with Japanese eggplant, egg, onion, and fresh basil in chili garlic sauce) - my friend's favorite dish. The eggplant was soooooo good because it soaked up all the wonderful flavors of the sauce, but the prawn and chicken were both overcooked. If I sat there and picked only at the veggies it woulda been the perfect dish.\n\nSticky Rice covered in Coconut sauce served with fresh mango. It's impossible to have a bad experience with this dish, unless you overcook the rice or something. I remember last time they had run out, so actually that was a bad experience, but this time they had it, and it was warm, gooey, and delicious.\n\nI am convinced that there is no fantastic Thai food in SF, only mediocre.

I had seen this place on Lombard a few times but never realized it was so good. In my opinion it was much better than Lemongrass, Pad Thai, Gaittiip and a few other unremarkable places I had tried around town though admittedly I have not been to any of those in the past two years. \n\nYukol has a very clean and serene interior with a distinctive Thai architecture feel to the building entrance. The service on a Sunday evening (few patrons) was fantastic and they literally filled our water glasses after every 1-2 sips and served multiple scoops of rice for us so needless to say they were extremely attentive though I do not know how the service would fare on a busy night (assuming they have those). \n\nI give Yukol 4 1/2 stars for taste/service/ambiance and 3 1/2 for value since the portions are just a bit small and sometimes the shrimp content in a dish is low (like 2 shrimps in the appetizer), though the prices are reasonable at $10-12 per med-small dish. \n\nFor something different and delicious try the Meekrob appetizer #7 (crispy noodles with chicken, shrimp and tofu mixed with a sweet and sour sauce). Yum. [Update note: This appetizer dish had more oil than I thought and although delicious I had an oily after taste for several hours after so go easy on the portions if you try it.]\n\nAlso amazing was the #24 House dish with eggplant, chicken, and shrimp. We also had the Pork Pad Krapow (#34) and while also good it was too similar to the eggplant dish so I probably should have ordered a curry or something more unique. \n\nI should note that all 3 dishes were a bit on the oily side though not as bad as many of the other Asian restaurants around town. I did not really see huge pools of oil or anything but I did notice an oil aftertaste that I had about 30 minutes after I finished eating so people may want to save that after dinner chocolate mint. \n\nOur total for the 2 entrees, brown rice, and the appetizer with 1 sweet Thai tea was $36 plus tip which seemed reasonable given the quality/taste/service and small amount of leftovers. \n\nI will definitely be going back to this place next time I am craving Thai food.", "author": "Mike L."}

And the food, made from quality ingredients, is incredibly flavorful. I mean, really... it's DELICIOUS. I'm not an expert on authentic Thai cuisine, but I do know what I like. The only real knock on the place is that it could use a broader selection of dishes to choose from. The menu is just a little bit limited, but what they do they do well. \n\nYukol isn't as cheap as some of the other options in town, but you get what you pay for and really, it's not that pricey all things considered. Hands down, this is my favorite Thai restaurant in San Francisco.", "author": "Don W."}

Its solid, but I think of 4 star places as pretty darn good places, and I don't see this place as any more than average.\n\nI've had take out 3 times and have dined in once.  \n\nPros:\n* dine in, as usual, is a better experience.  Things don't glop together as much and the crispy stuff stays crispier.\n* Angel Wings - these are pretty good.  It would be nice if the portion was a little better.  its solid, not great though.\n* service dining in is attentive and the staff is friendly\n* they deliver - which is a nice bonus\n\nCons:\n* a lot of dishes are similar and not distinctive.  \n* the menu is fairly standard - you can get the usual Thai standards.  I guess that's a positive from a certain perspective (not mine though.)\n* personally, I've sampled maybe half their menu and I've not found one memorable dish that makes me come back.\n\nI guess that's my whole problem with them being a 4 star restaurant.  There's not one signature dish that I really was impressed by, nor does it represent a tremendous deal or anything.  it just blends in with the rash of so-so Thai food in this town (there are few better than mediocre, but that's another review.)

We also had the phrik khing gai kung, which was prawns, chicken, green beans, mushrooms, red peppers, and tomatoes in this sweet-sour-spicy curry sauce (no coconut milk). That was probably the highlight of the night, my boyfriend WAY overate and nearly finished that dish. \n\nOne star removed because, while very polite and kind on the phone and in person, we were not given an option to pay with a credit card. When the delivery person came to the door and I held out my card, they said, \"Ohhhh. I won't be able to give a receipt, I'll have to make a slip on this one.\" When I said I wasn't asked on the phone how I'd be paying (they just said thank you and hung up), they said, \"Oh yes, because we prefer cash.\" I don't want to say it's sneaky, because they totally took my card, but that kind of omission isn't going to do anything but annoy the customer.

I understand that the VEGGIE'S section of the menu says that diners should alert their server if they cannot eat chicken broth, oyster sauce, and fish sauce.  Thanks for the warning, but when I alerted our server, she said the only items on the entire menu that could be made without fish sauce were Nos. 21 and 55.  Two items out of dozens?  Fine, except that neither of those items is listed under VEGGIE's, so it's a real possibility that the chef will be so focused on not using fish oil that he'll forget to hold the meat that normally comes with both dishes.", "author": "John S."}

The last visit changed my opinion.  I'm not sure if it is a hit and miss situation, but I'm leaning towards it being a dish selection issue.  \n\nLook & Feel:  The place is not what you would expect from the outside.  It's clean and decorated nicely.  You can definitely show up casual and feel right at home.  \n\nService:  the wait staff was great.  Water was consistently filled, rice was served, and plates were cleared timely.  The place was not super busy, so that could have been why we received extra attention.  The place started to fill as we left and most customers looked like repeat visitors.  \n\nFood:  I wouldn't consider myself an expert on Thai food, but I have visited many places all throughout the bay area and think I have a good handle on what is top notch.   The marinated beef dish seemed dry, although the accompanying chili sauce was excellent and the flavor was good.  We had the Pad See Maoeu (flat rice noodles) and that was tasty, but was overwhelmed with veggies.  The balance of sweetness was spot on, but it just seemed like I wanted more noodles.  We had to have a curry dish to round things out and the duck got the nod.  As far as the curry goes, it had great flavor.  There was a nice heat to it and felt balanced.  As for the duck, 95% of it was butchered well but I did get a big chunk of ligament which required removal.  I topped off my meal with a hot thai coffee, which came nicely presented.  I'd say this was my highlight of this dining adventure.  Upon my 2nd visit, I had the pad thai, boneless curry chicken w/potatoes, and a corn/chicken/pork appetizer that looked like a deep fried fritter.  All of those dishes were excellent.  The chicken was tender, the pad thai was  not overloaded with fish sauce, and the curry sauce was perfect.  \n\nPricing:  we got out of there for $45 with tip.  This included 3 dishes, a glass of wine, and my coffee.  For the marina, this is pretty hard to beat.  Unless of course, you go to the other thai place (Gatip).\n\nStick with the standard Thai dishes and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Simon Y."}

Plus, the food is incredible! I have been here a few times, and every time it has been delicious. The first time we went, it was at lunch, so the atmosphere was very casual. The next time, we went for dinner, and it actually had ambiance! It was romantic and sweet, with candles and dimmed lights. I loved it. It was a great touch and just added to the great food and service. The only downside is parking... once, we wound up driving around for 30 minutes looking for parking. But it's not really Yukol Place's fault that there's no parking... right? Bottom line is, this is top of the line Thai food in SF--if you haven't tried it, you need to.", "author": "Bridgette A."}

Found the place via Yelp, so thanks to the previous reviewers. the beginning part of dinner would leave one with reservations, but the food turned out so yummy and the bill was surprisingly small that I felt compelled to share my experience and highly recommend that you try it too. \n\nI went on a Monday around 7pm and the place was deserted except one couple.  There were multiple take-out orders though, but it was upsetting when those customers placed their order after mine but got their food first. \n\nAnother thing, I despise the outrageous charge for rice ($1.50 for white rice  and $2.50 for brown), so I planned on getting a noodle dish to avoid it. My husband and his brother got #18 (wide noodles with chicken, shrimp, basil) that they thought were fantastic. I got #21 (chicken, Japanese eggplant, bell peppers, basil) that I thought came with noodles. When I found out it didn't, I asked for some plain thin rice noodles, which I wasn't happy about at first, but found it a worthwhile move in the end. My dish was SO good I didn't want to stop eating. Hope the restaurant would consider making it standard to include noodles with dish #21. \n\nOverall spent $24 (that included 15% tip) for three people's dinners plus one drink. My order was big enough to have lunch the next day too. Would definitely come back when I'm in SF again.", "author": "Helen H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-08", "description": "I love this place. My first experience was during one of the power outages in December. \n\nIt had been a great day: I braved traffic to drive all the way to Half Moon Bay for work. I thought I was going to die but I refused to turn back. I made it through the downed trees, over Devil's Slide-that was shut down later in the day-and got to work to find the power out. No one called to say - \"Erin, don't drive 2 hours because the powers out!\" Well they couldn't. So I don't fully blame them. \nI got home to enjoy the peace and quiet of the Presidio. I had a great storm day planned out that involved movies, hot chocolate and naps. But alas! I arrived home like a warrior returning from battle to find the power out there too. \nLater that night as the sun went down (was it even out that day?) my roommate and I decided to brave the weather. We rewarded ourselves first at Final Final with a few drinks and then headed towards the Marina to find food. We saw Yukol from far away because of a tree that had fallen across the doorway. There were still a decent amount of people inside despite the obstacles so we settled on Yukol.\nThe staff was very friendly and prompt. They were kind enough to let us sit down even though half of our group was missing. We held the table for a while without ordering and they didn't seem to mind. I think they could tell we'd nearly been blown away that day.\nThe food was also fantastic. The medium spicy curry with baby corn and mushrooms was awesome! Their Pad Thai was far more flavorful than most, which was a great surprise. I, like most people, always order Pad Thai and I've been getting bored. But Yukol renewed my love.  Not that I would've stopped ordering it because I've been bored, but it's still nice to know that it can be made right. We also ordered one of their specials. I think it was a lobster spring roll of some sort. The cook came out to say hi and ask how everything was! That's not something I experience too often in Thai restaurants so I was quite stoked.\n\nMy love of Be My Guest Thai has been transferred to Yukol. They have it all (unlike some loves that choose to play with my heart) Yukol delivers and has great food!", "author": "Erin G."}

I ordered the Thom Kha Gai soup (vegetarian) and the Kaeng Panang Curry. I specifically requested the curry to be as mild as possible as I can't handle too spicy. \nI started with the soup and I was very pleased with it. It consisted of a variety of fresh veggies and had just the right amount of spice. Next and finally, I moved on to the main course: the curry. I took one bite and immediately felt a burst of fire in my mouth. I couldn't take another bite and my mouth and lips are still burning from the spicyness. :( I am not one to call and complain but I decided to at least call to let them know. I certainly wasn't going to walk back down there and get another but maybe they would offer me a discount or something for next time. I called and was very nice. I said to the girl that answered that it was my first time ordering at the restaurant as I was looking for a new thai spot. I told her that the soup was excellent but although I had requested that the curry be as mild as possible it was fire hot. She apologized, didn't offer me a thing and said goodbye.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-10", "description": "Simply among the best Thai food places in the entire city.  I used to live around the corner and ate here 2-3 times a week.  Consistently outstanding.  Even though I live in Glen Park now, I still try to visit Yukol as often as possible.  The pad thai is hands down the best in the city (sorry Osha...but it is true).  Don't stop at Go - proceed directly to Yukol.", "author": "Aaron D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-13", "description": "I've never actually eaten at this restaurant, but it's the best Thai delivery I've found in the Marina/Cow Hollow area. I love Thai food, have spent a month eating in Thailand, and have a fairly high bar for Thai food. Compared to the best, I'd give this a three. Compared to alternatives in the area, I'd give it a five.", "author": "Look and C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-20", "description": "I LOVE their Pad Thai and could eat it every night! (that's why they get 5 stars)! It's quick, easy, and they don't slather their food in oil. I also loved it because I could ask for something to be prepared with less oil. I love the staff. Their Thai food is some of the best around - then again, I usually stick to one thing when I go Thai - Pad Thai. My friends have had other stuff, curry, etc. which they have liked as well.", "author": "Michelle D."}

Everything we had was delicious...I ate until I almost exploded. My favorite was probably the yellow curry", "author": "Joy Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-24", "description": "this is the type of place that serves a lot of starch - rice noodles, rice, & not so much veggies. they're very sweet (the wait staff that is, although come to think of it, the food was too), service was good & caring, but there's only so much they can do to make up for a big fat plate of rice w/ some tofu/shrimp on the side. and i ambitiously got the tom yum - not really sour, a huge full bowl of rice noodles, that swelled up absorbing all broth. i was only there for lunch, and only once, but i won't go back.", "author": "Kim Y."}

The tom-yum soup is quite good and their curries are excellent too.  Yes, its not the best Thai food but a great value for the money as compared to others in the 'hood.  I recommend it!", "author": "Mike D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-05", "description": "Whatever Yukol might lack in ambiance due to its unfortunate Lombard St. location, it more than makes up for with fantastic food and friendly, fast service. The dishes consistently combine fresh ingredients in great sweet and savory combinations, and I've always been impressed with the quality of meat in their dishes. I have never gone wrong trying one of their specials, either. Lastly, it's cheap, especially for a popular Marina place. Try everything.  I haven't been to Kwanjai, so I can't compare.  I'm all for competition, but Yukol is excellent enough that I don't need to dabble away.", "author": "jack r."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-21", "description": "Minutes from the golden gate bridge, Yukol Place is located in the crappy motel section of lombard street.  America's Best Motel, The Travelodge and the Sea Captain inn are all just blocks away! More significantly, Yukol Place is also located on the same block as two other Thai eateries.  I have tried them all,and it is only yukol I have given my repeat business, as everything they have is quite delicious.  Try the tom ka gai and any of their Thai Curry offerings.", "author": "Mark K."}
