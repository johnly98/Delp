I am not a big pizza eater, as I usually find it to be very heavy and oily, but man, id Del Popolo's amazing. They have refined their crust to perfection - its super soft, beautifully blistered for awesome texture, and every last bite is light and tasty.  \n\nThe toppings are always generous, perfectly balanced and distributed, and you can tell they use really quality ingredients, as the flavors seem to burst forth in each bite.  \n\nI have sought out both the physical location and the food truck several times since first coming here, and each time they do not disappoint.  Also, their staff is always super friendly and professional. The last time, I'm sorry to say, I was in an argument with my boyfriend and our server took me off guard with a question, so I ended up very curtly answering him.  The entire night though, he was still friendly and composed. So sorry and it won't happen again - keep being great Del Popolo fam!", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

It's a really mixed experience:\n\n(1). The broccolini and the kale salad were great.\n(2).  Our server recommended the margherita, the Bianca and salami pizzas with the house made sausage and peppers as toppings for the margherita.  The main issue for me was that the pizza crust was doughy and soggy (it's not what I would expect from a wood fire oven).  It was a real let down after the great appetizers. \n(3).  The desserts were OK - the creme fraiche panna cotta and a split order of chocolate ice cream and blackberry-lime sorbet (these two flavors and consistencies went really well together).\n(4).  Service was good and the food came out fast. \n(5).  The ambiance was good - it's nice to see a restaurant centered around a wood fire oven.  \n\nOverall, this is a 3.5 rating but I rounded down because of the pizza dough (it's a pizza place after all). The above meal plus a glass of wine each plus tax plus tip cost about $60 per person. I would not recommend this place but I'm glad I checked this place out.\n\nP.S.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-04", "description": "I think the Del Popolo Pizza Truck is an ingenious idea, in order to be able to create some of the best tasting Neapolitan-style pizza pies in the Bay Area, owner Jon Darsky successfully figured out a way to put a five thousand pound pizza oven in a food truck! As you approach the mobile food truck, you'll immediately notice that this is no truck at all but it's a giant shipping-container-on-wheels with one wall of completely built of windows, so you can look inside as the crew cooks pizzas in their massive wood-fired oven as you look to see what you should order of their menu. Overall the huge rig feels like it's a statement on the overall realm of design as it does on the modern day food delivery system.\n\nI had the opportunity to see the Del Popolo pizza truck at a family member's wedding recently, guess the bride and groom were such fans of their authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas that they had to host their wedding guests with this specialized pizza truck. Everything with the Del Popolo truck was extremely organized as they arrived early and parked themselves outside of the San Francisco Film Center in the Presidio and they set up and organized as they were ready to serve plenty of pizza from 4-6pm. And for the next two hours the pizza just kept coming out again and again. Since this was a pre-arranged deal that the wedding couple set up we could only go with four pizza options but there was no need to stand in line to order, it became an easier task just to wait in line for the crew to just put out the pies on the ledge in front of their truck, and there were no more than three present at all times, all different pizzas and all piping hot fresh from that huge pizza oven.\n\nWe got a chance to try four of their signature pies including their hallowed Margherita with crushed tomato, mozzarella, basil, the Housemade Sausage pizza with crushed tomato, mozzarella, fennel sausage, gypsy pepper, red onion and Calabrian chili, the Market pizza with roasted pepper, caramelized onions, San Andreas sheep's cheese, salame di manzo and thyme and a uniquely made to order Pork Salami pizza. Although I loved all of the options they gave us, and trust me I am no pizza neophyte, my personal favorite was the Housemade Sausage pizza because of the perfect pairing of the fennel sausage, red onions and Calabrian chili all made for a delectable highlight. All of the pizzas they cooked at Del Popolo had the perfect amount of char on the bottom to each pie that made everything well cooked and tasting refined. Topped with optional Parmesan cheese and red chili pepper, every pie tasted full of sublime character and flavor. \n\nI've had my eye on Del Popolo pizza for some time and now that I've had the opportunity to try out a sample of the freshly baked pies they offer on their food truck, I can't wait to go to their brick and mortar restaurant on Bush Street in San Francisco's lower Nob Hill area. Owner Jon Darsky clearly had the intention of making authentic Neapolitan-style pizzas in a wood-fired oven that could hit extremely high temperatures, and it's nice to know that he insisted on not  compromising on that vision when he decided to start with a mobile operation. This way every pizza lover can mangia on their own to see what kind of pizza pie tickles their fancy when it's cooked to perfection.", "author": "Jason F."}

The pizza was quick and the line moved even quicker. I really enjoyed the extreme freshness of everything. This truly was a very, very made on the spot kind of pizza. \n\nI got Margherita ... because this is the type of occasion one gets such a pizza. It was amazing.

It's $12-$13 for a perfectly sized personal pizza and $0.50 for the covered to go box. I decided to forgo my diet for a special team outing. Ordered, warm service and recognized my teammates as regulars by name. Pretty quick too, not a few minutes until my pizza was ready. \n\nMy Italian coworker approved of this place but agreed that the pizza wasn't up to par as the previous times they had it. He was also critical of mascarpone as a cheese topping on the special pizza and skeptical about the bacon and squash. \n\nI got the Margherita. Mmm doughey goodness and flavor though the texture was off. The crust never achieved that bubbly flakey light crispiness I sometimes dream of in Neapolitan pizza and my friends rave about as Del Popolo's characteristic. Crust was limp and gummy even on the thick outer edges, like it was underdone. The bottom had a slightly burnt bitter char. Toppings tasted great but watery, I preferred the freshness and uncooked nature of the crushed tomato and basil. \n\nOn the second time, I opted for the Bianca instead which was better than the first experience and more flavorful. The crust was crispier, less chewy but slightly burnt. It was light and had a naan like consistency. The cheese toppings and basil were subtle, mildly creamy but there wasn't a lot of them and they sank towards the center. I'd definitely get the Bianca over the Margherita again.\n\nThe quantity was just right. The pizza didn't leave me in a carby food coma state like a heavy sandwich does or the competing Acai bowl truck that gives me the sugar rush jitters. Highlights are the quality ingredients and fresh out of the oven experience. Crust was a letdown, if it were more consistently cooked it'd be a 4 and perhaps it was an off day.", "author": "Truc N."}

The freshness of the ricotta and mozzarella really shine on this simple pie.\n\nHowever for the Magherita, the description which states \"crushed tomatoes\" is pretty much what you get. Rather than a tomato sauce, simmered for hours with herbs and  garlic, it tastes like the juice from freshly crushed tomatoes. For most people, they'll -appreciate it.

Since pizzas are make to order on the truck, the line moved a little slow. But I didn't mind since I was really excited to try their Margherita pizza!\n\nFor Outside Lands, they were only serving the Margherita (crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, basil) at $12 each. They offered one option for extras. Pork salami for an additional $3. I stuck with the regular Margherita since I just wanted something simple. \n\nThe pizza came out bubbly and hot! The crust was nice and chewy and had a great crisp to it! I also loved the mozzarella and basil! The one thing I didn't care for was the tomato sauce. It was a little too sweet and acidic for me. My first bite was a little jarring due to the sauce. But I loved the crust, mozzarella & basil so much, I kept eating the pizza while trying to brush away the sauce. Yes, it got a little messy, but all those elements were that good!\n\nThe truck itself is gorgeous! Glass windows on the side so you can see the pizza making action! It's got a great rustic feel with the brown frame coloring while adding a dash of contemporary flair with the numerous glass windows.\n\nI would love to stop by this truck again so I can try some of the other pizzas they offer.

I'm not sure if this is going to be one of their regular spots but I liked the location. \n\nPizzas were made incredibly quick and the crust were perfectly blistered from their wood burning oven that they were able to secure inside this truck. \n\nDel Popolo, I will be seeing you again very soon.", "author": "Esther A."}

Enjoyed both but not sure the raw squash added much to the salad. Split the house sausage pizza and the margherita w spicy salami. Both came out with the majority of the outer crust and bottom burnt.  Burnt black. Unfortunately it gave the pizza a bitter taste. I was seated near the oven and it seemed as though all the pizzas we're coming out similarly well done. We had three beers, solid IPA's, which went well w the pizzas but were small pours ( I think they list them as 10.5 ounce pours). So for a party of four, 3 beers, 2 small plates, and 2 pizzas for 94 dollars. Overall, disappointed.", "author": "S W."}

The reportedly $180,000 food truck carries rugged beauty within it's industrial design. You can actual see three people making the pizza from the dough to dressing to baking. The pizza oven is an unavoidable attraction as well. It feels a bit Wizard of Oz-ish to boot.\n\nWhen we visited they offered two kinds of pizzas, margherita and meat. The meat offering was bit strange because they had pepperoni and spicy sausage on the menu but it seems like they only give you one kind of meat depending on how they're making.\n\nThe pizza has a very appetizing look to it. With the steaming pizza cloud billowing off the melted cheese, and the pillowy puffiness of the dough; this is a great looking pizza. The approximately 10-inch personal pizza is cut into quarters. I ate one myself but you could easily split this between two people.\n\nSome people are saying that this pizza is undercooked, doughy, and \"almost like naan bread\" -- to certain extent they're right. The pizza has a great look but the peaks and edges of the pizza have torched burnt edges. The second thing you'll notice is that the pizza is surprisingly limp and without crisp. It's as if the dough was given enough time to pillow up but not actually cook through.\n\nBut does it taste good? Yeah it still tastes good. The dough, basil, and golden baked pepperoni taste great. The only thing that goes strange is the dough. You're expecting something crispy, light, and just slightly raw; yet, this goes too raw. I think the only reason this place is getting the amazing reviews is because it's straight out of the oven. I bet if you let the pizza sit for about fifteen minutes, you'll think this pizza wasn't that good.\n\n____\n\nAmazing truck and good flavors. I just hope they work on the cooking technique.

Del Popolo is the pizza truck with a pizza oven in it; it's pretty cool.\nI had a margarita style with an orange fanta and felt like i was 12 but with better pizza. There was a crispy yet soft crust and a good sauce with a just amount of cheese. There were some carcinogens present but I didn't mind that too much. It was a solid pizza that I would eat again but it didn't blow me away, didn't open my eyes to the true light.\nYes, Enjoyable.\n\nThe down side has nothing to do with Del Popolo. The down side was the line which was a longer wait than the time it took to cook the pizza. Additionally the people in live all talked way to loud. Some things are private and some things are boring and somethings are just not worth shouting about. Also if I ever get stuck in live behind the guy I was in line this time(looked like he was trying to be both Black Keys all at once) I will shove him.

They were offering three pizzas (pies only, no slices!): margherita (mozzarella and tomato sauce), bianca (with ricotta, basil, garlic, and some heat), and \"meat\" (which had some other toppings).  Notes!\n- We got margherita and bianca.  Both were great, but the bianca was the surprise winner for me: much more flavor despite lacking tomato sauce.  We all agreed we liked the variety and preferred to get tastes of both.\n- The awesomest thing was definitely the crust.  It's technically thin crust, but it was unique among pizzas I've had: a little gooey on the inside (like almost undercooked) but deliciously toasty (as in small parts were dark brown) on the outside.  Not sure if they only placed pizzas in the over when ordered... if so, they cook damn fast.  If not, the place is a little slow! :)\n- We got two pizzas to split between three of us, all modestly above average sized guys.  It was the perfect amount.  So get a takeaway box if you order a pizza solo, but don't try to share one pizza between two people either.\n- Oh right, it's the coolest looking truck ever.

Seemingly overnight the \"roach coach\" morphed into the \"food truck\", parked in nicer neighborhoods, and became a major source of cutting-edge cuisine in hip foodie cities for discerning consumers.\n\nThey did, however, continue to reproduce like roaches.  \n\nSlider, BBQ, and ethnic-with-a-twist (\"street food +\") trucks painted with a catchy graphic on a converted step van multiplied like mushrooms in an Oregon cow pasture after a rainstorm.\n \nCity laws forced the trucks to park randomly rather than in a dependable location. Devotees had to twitter and tweet ,if they were lucky, to locate their favorite truck each day.\n\nClearly someone needed to provide a  permanent space where these cutting edge mobile restaurateurs could gather and prosper and be compared.  \n\nSomebody did.  Thanks.  In San Francisco it's called SOMASTREATFOODPARK. I found a stunning new gem there recently in the Del Popolo truck.\n\nThis split-level steam-punk styled truck is turning out perfect Neopolitan thin-crust pizzas. Yes, \"split-level\"!  The 20' oceanic shipping container that some twisted and brilliant designer converted into a mobile kitchen towed behind a semi has side-to-side, floor-to-ceiling removable glass doors/windows, framed by Jules Verne style metal.  All while affording a complete view of the making of your pizza.\n\nYou may need to read that again, but you won't really appreciate it until you see it.  At customer level in the front they take your order and deliver the pizzas from (believe it or not) A REAL ITALIAN-MADE WOOD-FIRED PIZZA OVEN! \n\nSERIOUSLY.  IN A TRUCK.\n\nHalf a human higher behind them in the rear of the kitchen are the guys that actually crank out the pies.  Oh sure, they could have been on the same level as the server.  Anyone else on foodtruck earth would have been happy to do that. But then you couldn't see them strut their pizza stuff. And these guys have LOTS of pizza stuff to strut.\n\nI am so much more impressed when I am served a simple perfect thing than I am when I am sold a complicated pretentious failure.  The latter is too common.  Even in food trucks (see Fish Truck review).\n\nDel Popolo has only 4 pizzas (3 when I was there, no potato).  They are done perfectly so there is no need for anything else.  \n\nHere is their menu:     http://www.delpopolosf.com/about.php#menu\n\nYou won't need or want anything else.  Except maybe a beer or sangria at another booth if you are at SOMA STREATFOOD PARK.\n\nhttp://somastreatfoodpark.com/\n\n\nAll hail Del Popolo!  What \"roach coach\" was to become \"food truck\",  Del Popolo will be to what \"food truck\" will (has?) become. Eat here now and take a giant step into the future of mobile dining.

Granted there were a little crispy burnt spots on the pizza, it had a nice smoky flavor to it. \n\nThe Meat, on the other hand (Fresh mozzarella, Yukon Gold potatoes, pancetta, rosemary), was good but not \"omg it's so good!\" good. This pizza was decent. It was salted which was a little odd to me, but I'm a fan of salt so I was ok with it. It was a ... \"why does this taste like there's salt, oh wait, there is salt on this? huh? i guess it works?\".

The heated patio with outside bar is a lovely place to enjoy the wood-fired pizza.\n\nI shared the margherita pizza and the white pizza (ricotta and garlic i think) and both were cooked well with a pleasantly charred thin crust. I enjoyed the white pizza more than the margherita because it was a bit more flavorful. I couldn't pick up as much flavor as I would have liked from the tomato sauce on the margherita but the cheese and basil were great. There was another pizza offered with a meat topping but that is the extent of what the pizza truck offers. The pizzas are personal sized so don't expect to have leftovers if you order one per person but that amount does the trick for a regular meal. I was at the truck on the earlier side of the evening so the wait was minimal and they were able to take the time execute the pizzas well.\n\nAt $10 a pop the pizzas are reasonably priced. It looks like the prices have been consistently creeping up so I am very curious to see where they land, especially considering this is food truck dining lacking the ambiance and service of a brick and mortar establishment (most of the time).\n\nI will probably revisit the truck but only at this location or another like it.

No surprise the line was 30+ people long.\n\nThe pizzas they're making, though... they just aren't very good.  \n\nTo be fair, I had one.  Once.  I ordered the margarita pizza.  It was bland and undercooked.  The oven is so hot that the crust chars and bubbles on the edge/top, but aside from that, it's squishy and spongy.  I guess some people like pizza like that, but I don't.  It was more like naan bread than anything else, and utterly flavorless.  When you're throwing away your edge crust instead of stealing other people's, you know you aren't eating good pizza.\n\nThe sauce was bland.  It didn't taste like good tomatos, it wasn't too sweet or salty, it was just... bland.  The mozzarella they use had no bite, didn't taste like much at all.  Honestly, the only thing I could really taste on the pizza was the basil.  Everything else was pretty much just spongy, chewy, doughy matter in my mouth. \n\nI didn't try the white pizza (white sauce, garlic, ricotta cheese, some other stuff), so that might be better.

It's amazing to see three people manning this place and spitting out a couple of pizzas every few minutes.\n\nThe Bianca pizza with meat was amazing! It's a small personal size pizza, but it size does not matter here! On second thought, more would've been good. Drool. The pizza dough was cooked to a soft, doughy, and chewy texture. The tomato sauce with garlic oil tasted pretty heavenly. The ricotta and mozzarella cheese made a perfect combo on top of the pizza. The peperoni was the only thing that didn't knock my socks off me... it tasted like peperoni.  \n\nOverall, it's one really delicious tasting pizza, but it hurts the wallet so much. Bianca costs $12 and the meat costs $3. My advice is to skip the meat, which gives about 12 slices of pepperoni. If it was cheaper, this will definitely become my favorite lunch time haunt. However, it's too pricy for me to become a regular.", "author": "Steven B."}

I think seeing the truck alone is worth the price of the pizza.  \nOn the day I went there were two varieties the margherita and the blanca (you guessed it, white) with options for pepperoni.  The pizzas are authentic Neapolitan style.  In a group we ordered each and even had one more margherita with the pepperoni.   The pizzas were baked perfectly and the dough was extraordinary.  The overall taste of the pizza's were very good.  The one disappointment was the pepperonis.  For an added $2 you get 4 slices per pizza's, which I wouldn't complain if they used some type of artisenal meat but this looked and tasted like your standard store bought pepperoni which is like putting Raghu on homemade pasta.", "author": "Joe G."}

Though a bit loud and crowded, the decor was nice and the atmosphere inviting. We both ordered a pizza; the margherita and the house sausage. When the two pizzas were delivered to our table, the waiter mistakingly forgot the toppings we requested and offered to redo it for us. When he brought it back not only were the sides of this pizza completely burnt, but also the first pizza (house sausage) was also burnt as well. Furthermore, both bottoms of the pizzas were almost completely black. When we told the waiter about this his only response was: \"our ovens are at 1000 degrees, this is how we cook our pizza,\" and walked away without any further comments. This was just plain rude in my opinion. Now I understand that this is the style of pizza but the degree at which this pizza was burnt was completely unacceptable and is not how \"this style\" of pizza should be, or is even, cooked in a restaurant charging these prices. All in all, I am completely dissatisfied with the food and the service here and will not be returning and will be telling others of the poor service received at this failed attempt of an up-scale restaurant.", "author": "Alex G."}

So today, finally my wait ends.  I went to Mint Plaza in the city to order the Margarita Pizza.  They had a 150 pizzas to make and sale, that's it.  I got there just in time, before the crowd came in and there were already about 10 people waiting for their order.  They only make two pizzas the Margarita and something else.  I was torn the other pizza was White garlic cream but I played it safe and ordered the Margarita.  LOVED IT! The sauce was light, very tasty and there was a lot of flavor.  The pizza is very tasty, without a doubt.  So if you're in the city, tweet Del Popolo and find out where they are parked, they only make a certain amount of pizza pies.  I'm sure they go fast.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-04", "description": "I recently found out there are two major SF pizza trucks (that I know of): Casey's (review forthcoming) and this. And now that I've tried both, it's no contest: Del Popolo is far superior, offering a fantastic pie for a reasonable price. And even when you compare it to immobile pizza shops, it stacks up VERY favorably.\n\nPros: \n-Excellent pie (I had the marghertia) with tasty sauce, yummy chewy crust, fresh mozzarella, and a splash of olive oil. Despite coming off of a truck, it's in my San Francisco Top 5 Pizza Places. I'd say 1) Tony's. 2) Una Pizza Napoletana. 3) Pizzeria Delfina. 4) Gialina. 5) Del Popolo. Though I've got plenty of other places to try yet. :-)\n-Good price. $11 for the marg. It's a tad smaller than a lot of the Neapolitan-style pizzas I've eaten, so I guess that makes it comparable to the $13 for a larger margherita at lots of my other favorite SF spots, but it's still enough for a \"lunch pizza\" and much, much more reasonably priced than Casey's, which is $17 (!) for the same pie.\n\nCons:\n-My big issue -- and perhaps this was an isolated incident -- but we ordered 2 margs and a sausage. The two margs came out simultaneously, but the sausage was not the next pizza out of the oven. In fact, it was about an extra 10-minute wait. I'm not sure what their system is and if it was broken or working properly in this case, but I was annoyed because by the time I got to sit down and eat my marg it wasn't piping hot anymore.\n-Cash only. This is more Yelp's problem than Del Popolo's, but be warned that this truck does NOT accept credit cards even though Yelp says it does. Maybe they do on other days (we went on Sunday to their Presidio location).\n-This is a nitpick, but I could've done with a bit more cheese. Del Popolo's pie is a lot redder than it is white. Didn't stop it from being delicious, though.\n\nAlso, this isn't a con because you can't fault Del Popolo for its own success, but as others have noted, be prepared for a long line. It never let up the whole 2 hours we hung out on the Presidio grass near the Del Popolo truck. This isn't a place to stop for a quick bite to eat.
