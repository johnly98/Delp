There was plenty of seating in the narrow layout of the place. The liquor selection seems about what you'd expect for a dive bar.  We ended up with Tokyo Teas which were strong enough for $11.  Kind of felt them after having 2.  They have one of those cool spin to win a beer/shot wheels.  But the price kind of stopped us from actually playing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-15", "description": "Good ol' Dragon Lounge. My friends and I have been going here periodically over the last three years and we've always had an interesting experience each time here. So when I moved out to Taraval a couple months ago, I knew I'd be likely to stop by here more often. Little did I know that I'd quickly become a regular to the extent that I did.\n\nSo the first thing you'll notice about Dragon Lounge is the chill atmosphere and the friendly bartenders. My friends and I often come here to catch up or just relax with some drinks after a meal somewhere in the city. The staff members are all very friendly and I've even become acquainted with many of the bartenders that have worked there over the years. They're very easy to talk to and will even drink with you should you need a drinking buddy. With numerous TVs at the bar, we can usually watch whatever game or show interests us with ease. This was especially important to me during the NHL playoffs when many bars in SF would only play the Giants games or the NBA playoff games despite my beloved Sharks playing that night in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. \n\nNow should you ever get hungry while drinking there, the owner is really chill about us ordering food from elsewhere and eating inside while we enjoy the drinks there. They even have some sort of partnership with Yelo Gelato Crepe Caf\u00e9 next door so that if you order food from there, they'll walk over and serve it to you inside Dragon Lounge so you don't have to leave your drinks while waiting for your food to be ready. The best part is that they usually stay open until Dragon Lounge closes so you'll always have it as an option for some late night snacks to sober up on. They even now serve hot dogs and hamburgers on their menu! \"Hot Dog Coming Soon\"...no longer. It has arrived and dang is it delicious!!!\n\nOverall, if you're living in the Sunset, especially near Taraval, you should definitely come and kick it at Dragon Lounge. Awesome bartenders/staff, numerous TVs, decent drink prices, and friendly regulars, what more can you ask for from your neighborhood bar. If you do stop by, be sure and try their signature drink, the Dragon Extreme. It's like an AMF but much more delicious. Or for the brave few out there, try the \"Gaj\", a drink named after me. It's basically a combination of 4 Dragon Extremes put together into a Giant pitcher with a cherry on top for kicks. While you can share it with you friends, I applaud those brave enough to try it on their own. See you at Dragon Lounge!", "author": "Gajan K."}

Went on a Saturday.\nThis is definitely a quiet place around 10pm.  The pool table was open during this time.  When I first walked in, the first thing I thought was, \"This place is so calming.\"  It was cozy and friendly, and the girls who work there really care about their customers.  They filled my water without me asking--but rather because they thought I was getting a little red and tired.\nOnce it hits 11-12, people start flooding in, but it wasn't super loud.  Rather gave off a warm feeling.  They have game machines, no dancing, and put on the mainstream music on their jukebox.  Yes, there were more Asian guys than girls, but it being SF it was a number of mixed races and ages.  Definitely give this place a chance.  4 stars for it being a good place to wind down.", "author": "Janet T."}

Like the place where the asian clubbing crowd goes on their off nights.  Sure, modern R&B is king on the jukebox, but everyone is just here to chat, shoot pool, even watch football.\n\nChoosing a cocktail here was a bit odd (if only I'd done my homework I could've ordered the Euge -- total bonus star for that).  They didn't seem to know how to make an old-fashioned or a white russian , though I saw lots of rum & cokes getting made, and various things with lots of sodas, liqueurs, and maraschino cherries.  Hardly anyone was drinking beer.  In the end we opted for Manhattans, which were done well but pricey for Parkside.  Decor is nice, my only complaint is that the lights behind the bar are too bright.\n\nSo, yet another contender for my local bar of choice.  Sadly, I think I fit in more in the Inner Sunset, but from the reviews, Dragon Lounge seems like a great place to run into some of my fellow west-side Yelpers.

In fact, I used to take the L Taraval every day and I thought it was some hip dentistry with some cool lights on the outside. It isn't located on a bar street but there really isn't anything else around other than residential houses and the library across the street.\n\nBut trust me, this is where you want to come at night if you're in the Sunset and you just want to hang and kick it. The bartenders here are all super chill and friendly, they'll always personally come over and ask you if everything is OK and if you need any more drinks. \n\nThe drinks are also very reasonably priced. We always order a pitcher and it'll always come out to about 5 bucks a person.

The bread and butter of this place is clearly creepy middle aged guys, because several of them were seated at the bar vying for the attention of the bartender, and from the way were talking to her they seemed to be regulars. They kept buying her shots and flirting with her and she wasn't all that concerned with anyone who wasn't perving on her, which was basically just me and boyfriend. She made me the weakest drink I've ever had, it was basically just cranberry juice, and normally I would just let it go but I had to be intoxicated to deal with the atmosphere in there. So she poured me an extra shot and at least wasn't a bitch about it. I had two more drinks there that she made stronger, but never gave me a clean glass, and my boyfriend had to wait way too long to get her attention every time he wanted another beer because she was so preoccupied flirting with the creepies.

Occasionally I get carded buying cigarettes. Occasionally I get carded buying beer at Safeway. But this is the first time I've walked in to a dark bar and been carded immediately. Was it my boyish good looks? Was it the company I walked in with? I don't know. I never did get an answer. This will haunt me. \n\nWe ordered pizza to quell our appetites after 15 gallons of German beer. No more Taraval Pizza for me. I will go to Taco Bell or the Chinese place down the street if I ever feel the need to eat at Dragon Lounge again.

There is definitely an ethnic 'scene' here, but hey, that's cool with me. \r\n\r\nBoth of the bartenders were drunk and kept spilling the drinks -- they didn't really respond to some people trying to make orders either. However, they were really nice people, so I feel bad to complain about it. For example, my friend is a real lightweight (she happens to be Chinese). She gets dizzy and all red-faced whenever she drinks. One of the bartenders came over and suggested she should get something light and take an antihistamine like benadryl before drinking. Guess its an asian thing! We got her a buttery nipple shot and that seemed to do the trick. :)\r\n\r\nThat aside, it is a mellow place to just hang. They have very comfy couches and pool tables too.\r\n\r\nAnother funny thing, they set the clock in the bar 20 minutes fast. When it hit 2, the bouncer (a skinny and tall white guy) starting kicking everyone out. We all checked our watches and it was 1:40. Oh well.", "author": "Prasant R."}

Now more than likely you are not going to travel from other more popular bar hoppin' districts in the city to come to a bar sitting on the quiet streets of Taraval and the Outer Sunset, but if your in the neighborhood and just want a place to kick it and have a drink than I recommend the Dragon Lounge.\n\nSo, with this drinking spot you never really know what to expect as far as the amount of occupants on any given day during the week. Mondays though they regularly have capcom vs marvel tournaments which I say attracts a nerdy crowd, but hey who am I to judge. On friday & saturday's it can get pretty filled with regulars and even young people, but for the most part this really isn't the spot to pick up chicks... Now sunday's are usually pretty dead which can leave you hanging with just you and the bartenderess, which I might add can be a good thing as with this place they are all pretty Hot! I don't know what the hiring criteria is but all the girls that work there are really attractive and it seems their attire to work really pleases the male customers. In any case they are all really friendly and work hard to make sure you are not empty on a drink. If you become a regular you may even get to know some of the bartenderess' a little bit as they are great to talk to and take shots with while at the bar (don't forget you are the one buying them the shot!). But don't get too attatched as with this place high turnover seems to be apparent. \n\nOther things about the bar are that it has a pool table, a good amount of surrounding t.v.'s for games and such, a jukebox ($1 for pop songs), and an actually pretty good drink menu. Now I would recommend the 'dragon extreme' as with a couple of these will definitely get you feeling buzzin' if you are a heavy weight when it comes to drinking. \n\nNow, as far as complaints I cannot think really of any now but it is truely a special place on Taraval that deserves your attention for a drink if you are in the area. I would say the prices are fair, the bar is cleaner than most and the bartenderess' are great especially if you do become a regular at the Dragon Lounge.", "author": "Gabriel V."}

Okay... off to Dragon Lounge I go.  \n\nWow, I never knew it was so close to Marco Polo Ice Cream.  From the outside it looks exactly like what it is - a bar for the locals.  I go in at 5:45pm expected to see the old Fahey's bartender working.  Unfortunately its already the asian bartender.  Dont' get me wrong, I much prefer staring at a pretty asian girl than an older white guy but I wanted to see this \"changing of the guard\" at 6pm but I guess it doesn't apply on weekends.  Oh well, I do see some locals.  I sit down and immediately one inebriated local starts talking to me... offering up first pumps.  Hmmmm interesting.  I turn to the tv and watch the Yankee/RedSox game.  But he is a bit loud even while talking to others who are just in the next seat of him.  Hmmm time to move.  I do all the way down to the other end of the bar.  \n\nHave me a guiness.  Hmmm  doesn't look like they know how to pour a guiness...   Okay, moving onto some scotch.  Not much of a selection of single malts.  Hmmmm  what does this place have then?  Well, it's got a pool table in the back room.  Polite friendly bartenders.  And also a nice female owner who I met and conversed with.  The crowd is definitely a bit shady looking and there were some really drunk guys at 6 in the evening (they told me they have been drinking all day long) but its a nice place to unwind.

Greenish paint, dragon statues, lounge like seating around the bar, flat LCD TV's at both ends of the bar,  and the obligatory TV game set at one end of the bar that seems to be the trend nowadays. There is also a single pool table in the back which is always taken.\n\nThe crowd at certain hours can be seedy... or seem seedy. Mostly asian of the chinese decent. Non threatening, but they sometimes feel to be staring or putting out funky vibes. They talk amongst themselves in a lound or whatever manner, but if you are the social type, good luck in trying to strike up a convo with someone you don't know. They just didn't seem to be very approachable.\n\nOverall though the place is a regular ol bar. Drink prices are fair, and the food is so so. Mostly CostCo forzen food prepared in the back a la microwave or oven. Usually the owner, or the owner's mother, will be at one end of the bar monitoring everything taking place behind the bar...

I came here with some friends to get some drinks and I first ordered a snake bite which is Guinness on cider.... bartender looked at me like i was crazy because she didn't know how to make it. The owner had to tell her how to make it even after i told her how to make it... It was pretty crappy cause since she basically poured the Guinness straight into the cider, it was all mixed up and didn't have the same great taste as at other places that make it (i.e. Firefly sports bar on Noriega and 31st). Also, they charged me 7$ for that botched drink, firefly charges 5$ for it done right. Second drink I ordered an old fashioned, the bartender again had to ask the owner how to make the drink.... when she finally asked me what type of whiskey i wanted... she poured the whiskey straight into a shooter cup not a ball cup. I'm assuming she didn't put any sugar or symple syrup into it cause i could not taste it, nor did she put any angostura bitters which is a must for an old fashioned.  once she was finally done making this monstrosity she put tons of ice into the shooter glass overflowing the rest of the cup and all my drink. charged me 7$ again. I definitely wouldn't come back to this place for drinks since the two drinks i ordered besides beer and shots they fucked up.

These poor girls are all super young and have to wear skanky clothes, and have absolutely no clue what they're doing behind a bar. \nAnd the drinks are overpriced. \n\nThe old lady came over and checked our table for empty glasses no less than 3 times during the 15 minutes or so we were there, and was obvious about her desire to have us leave. Kept picking up people's not quite empty glasses to try to rush us out of the bar!\n\nThey have a $20 minimum for cards, so when my too-drunk friend went to pay his tab and wanted to pay with cash since he only had $9 on his tab, they took advantage of his drunkenness, wouldn't let him pay with cash, and added an $11 drink for the bartender onto his tab, to bring it up to $20. When the rest of us (we were all pretty much sober except the one poor guy who went alone to deal with his tab) came to his rescue and questioned why he got charged $20, the timid bartender said he bought her a drink, and seeing her bartender being asked a simple question, the scary looking owner came over. She claimed that the $11 Mai Tai (!!!) had already been made and drank by her bartender (not true!) so my friend had to pay for it. When I pointed out that it's illegal for bartenders to drink on the job, she just said \"everyone does it.\"  You mean everyone who bribes the cops to not pay attention to their shady-ass bar dealings? (just a guess but it seemed like the kind of place)\n\nAnyway, I feel sorry for the girls who work there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-08", "description": "Asian bar catering to the young Asian crowd.  Drinks aren't all that cheap but it's a neighborhood bar, so you go there for convenience.  Good place to just go for a drink and chat with friends.  Police station's right across the street.  You can't be too noisy when you smoke outside though or the security guy will tell you to shut up for disturbing the neighbors.", "author": "Mich C."}

Eventually (as I can be easily persuaded) a couple of friends got me to go in and I had to start laughing.......the end of the bar where I met the guys was nuttin but Irishmen laughing and cursin at each other talking about the days work or who was completely trashed last night....THE other end of the bar was all youngish Asian guys with the exception of the two who were probably about 150 combined.....So i plopped myself down with the guys met the bartenders......Mai (I'm not sure how in the hell to spell that) and Amanda are two of the most smokinist hottest (think super hot anime girls in tight black tank tops) chics Ive seen behind the bar........( still not anywhere near our Sunday night bartenders but eh...its a different place).  TAKE WARNING THOUGH....if they like you...you will end up plowed beyond belief wondering how the hell you re gonna make it all the way home.......the girls are great......Ive been in there enough times now that they know my drink they know my name they know who I come in there with.......and the know a few of my secrets.....EXACTLY WHY I do not come in there with anyone......Still not a bar I wanna make my \"spot\" but for once in awhile it is a cool place", "author": "Shaunna K."}

The bartenders are really really good looking Asian women that are out of their way friendly. They like to talk to you as they get your drink and even offer pretzels. The music was pretty good too. I don't know if it was a jukebox or Ipod.", "author": "lance l."}
