The tart filling was super bland and did not have a creamy, full-body texture. The crust was ok; it was thick and crumbly, but didn't have any buttery goodness.\n\nThe almond croissant and cheese danish were both meh. Neither were flaky / airy. Both were dense pastries and the fillings for both were negligible.\n\nThe blueberry kouign amann was the worst thing we got. It had this overly thick, syrupy casing of sugar and nuts on the bottom side of the pastry. I get that kouign amanns are supposed have caramelized sugar but this amber casing of syrup would protect the pastry well into the 22nd century. The pastry was meh and the blueberry part of this was a sad spread of jam in the middle.", "author": "Jessica C."}

I've convinced at least 3 of my coworkers of the goodness of this place.\n\nSimply put, I'm not a big fan of sandwiches, because I usually just want something plain / simple.  Andersen does this really well!  Their bread is so freshly made everyday, and the pastries are so worth the price.  I will never ever buy another cranberry walnut bread, especially if it's not from Andersen!  This bread, combined with half an avocado - like dang, my tastebuds are on fire!\n\nSecond, for SO SO SO LONG, the SF Andersen locations refused to honor the \"Sandwich/soup/salad combination\" they have at other Andersen locations!  Ridiculous, in my opinion.  But now that they DO honor it, I must say, I am at Andersen on a weekly basis.  Prices are good for a lunch meal in SF!\n\nI also really like this location.  It seems very central and is accessible off of the Montgomery Bart/Muni stop.  Lines do sometimes go out the door, but they move pretty fast. \n\nThe staff is also really friendly!

Through the years, this brand has been nothing but good to me! \n\nI visited this location today, though, and was completely disappointed by my first bad experience with this chain. To be clear, customer service and cleanliness were completely fine- my only issue was with the quality of the food I ordered. \n\nI bought the matcha cruffin (that's croissant/muffin for you folks not yet on that hype) and thought it was one of the worst pastries I've had to date. It was incredibly dry and just tasted like a stale croissant. While it was labeled as a matcha cruffin, there was only a small teaspoon sized bit of matcha on the top, making it look like this thing was loaded with the stuff. After opening the cruffin, I saw that the other 95% was empty. \n\nNot only did I feel tricked by this dry, misleading matcha cruffin, I felt nauseous after. I have a pretty strong stomach and can isolate it to this darn thing because I didn't munch on anything else for the hours surrounding this visit. All in all, I don't think I'll be stopping by Andersen for a while, unless the Andersen team gives me a very good reason to.

It was very conveniently located close to my former workplace so I frequented the bakery quite often; the only times I ever found it crowded was on Thursdays (as that's the day for Farmer's Market in Crocker Galleria).\n\nTHINGS YOU MUST TRY:\n1) Creamy French Rolls: My numero uno FAVORITE will forever be their CREAMY FRENCH ROLLS!  It's a 12\" crispy french baguette roll sliced lengthwise & filled with a custard filling!  They are SO addicting! You can ask them to cut them into small slices and -- voila -- the perfect party/company snack!  At about $2/a roll, just THINKING about them make my mouth water!\n\n2) Milk France: At just $1, this will keep your sweet tooth in check.  It's about the size of a small muffin and even resembles it a little, but under its crisp fluff top, there is a small dollop of condensed milk.\n\nMoving on... Those are the two things I would say you HAVE to try!  Their cheese danishes are decent.  The jalapeno cheese bread is all right, but it is a bit on the greasy side.  I've also tried their blackberry pastry and the raspberry cream cheese danish -- both were flaky and yummy!  Lastly, their coffee is pretty good and their cafe au lait is fantastic!\n\nThis Andersen Bakery location is ideal for an on-the-go pick me up. And if you want a nice breakfast alone or with company, you can always grab your food/coffee and take it to the roof top garden at the top of Crocker Galleria.\n\nService is fairly consistent.

Their pastries are to die for!  \n\nTheir breads are soooo delicious!  Nice and sweet, crusty on the outside and soft in the inside.  This is the prime example of the perfect loaf.  They also have good rolls.  Their pisano roll is yummy and kills my pizza craving, and the international cheese roll is as good cheesy goodness as it gets.  Try the cheddar jalapeno, it's very tasty but be prepared for a messy snack.\n\nI would come here everyday, but fear of carbs keeps my visits to once every few weeks.  Especially because I just can't help myself and I eat the whole damn loaf during the course of one workday!", "author": "Jennifer S."}

I know this is a bakery, but the bread wasn't even good.  It tasted like a store-bought loaf.\n\nWorse than the food was the service.  On my second visit there were only 2 people working and it was one guy's first day.  The other woman there didn't seem interested in helping him, and kept leaving him alone in the front to go do who knows what in the back.  There was a line of customers, and he didn't know how to use the register yet.  Poor guy!  He had to keep running back to find her, and when she finally came she just glared at him and told him to go slice some bread.  It took her forever to take all the orders and make everyone's sandwich herself.\n\nThe first time I came to this place the service wasn't that bad, but it wasn't good either, and neither was the soup I got.  It tasted salty, and like it was from a can.  Too bad, this place is so close to my office and would be really convenient!", "author": "Rachael S."}

They make an excellent birthday cake as well; the custard filling is real custard, the cake itself is fluffy and light, and the decorations will look great!

The croissants come in light almond paste fillings(not heavy at all), soft and puffy, with sprinkle of almonds, icing sugar and cocoa powder to finish the top. Every bite you taste, it blows you away. Then, I went there almost every breakfast and lunch. At one point, I felt as if my good karma has finally reincarnated. Just that said, my enlightment has finally ended today. Buddha has officially put a halt at me from entering my stage of nirvana.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-13", "description": "Simply excellent.  You can't get pastries as fresh as this anywhere in the city (well, you CAN, actually... but the only other place would be Specialty's, and they categorically SUCK).  And you're certainly not going to find anything of THIS quality.  Come here when you want an almond croissant fresh out of the oven (STILL WARM, they're so fresh!).  And their craft is truly inspiring: light, flaky crusts, fruit fillings that don't hit you over the head with their acute sweetness.  Subtlety seems to be the name of the game here, and it's a good thing.  Easily my favorite source for baked goods in the city.\n\nUPDATE, 08/29/2012 (though maintaining the 5-star rating): I've been away from the Financial District for a few years, but I recently have been back, and went to re-visit Andersen Bakery.  I'm happy to say that they're still making their beautiful pastries.  But I need to make a PARTICULAR shout-out about their Almond Croissant: This is, quite possibly, THE BEST Almond Croissant I have had in the city (and I have had quite a few).  It is certainly my personal favorite.  The one they do at La Boulange (the running favorite, it seems) is, to me, a bit heavy-handed: heavy on the almond paste (I never thought I'd hear myself say something like that, but their almond croissant demonstrates to me that you CAN, in fact, get too much of a good thing), plus even more ON TOP of the croissant, thus making it VERY heavy.  It's just kinda OVERKILL, if you ask me.  I WOULD still like to be able to WALK after eating their croissant!  By contrast, the one at Andersen Bakery has all the delicacy that the one at La Boulange & other places lack: It's light, flaky, airy, with just the right amount of almond paste (and that almond paste is not too sweet, either).  It is simply Delightful.  And you don't have to feel bad about yourself after eating it, either!  They are baked on-premises, and are frequently warm from the oven.  If I had to offer one criticism, it would be that they sometimes overdo the powdered sugar on top of the croissant.  It doesn't really detract from what's underneath, though.  It's still a lovely experience.  Add to this the unassuming, \"Hidden Gem\" nature of the place (It's rarely crowded), and I chalk it up to a Win-Win.  Am happy to see that they're still cranking out their pastries with the same quality that they were years ago.", "author": "Eric H."}
