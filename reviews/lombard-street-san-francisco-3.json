Not to mention the millions of tourists everywhere, I feel bad for the residence here, it's even worse than Beverly Hills garden park! I remember I could see this street much better when I came here as a child, and I was even shorter then! So it must be less flower bushes and much less tourists. \n\nAnyways I think it's better to rent a car drive down the turned street now, that way you might see better, walking down the handrails were not helping anything really! I wasn't impressed with this tourist trap but sister and parents were happy to hang around.

And the first San Francisco season was my favorite. Where did they live? Lombard Street. I remember it to this day. Now, early 90s San Francisco is much different than 2018 San Francisco but I still got a bit of a thrill whenever we walk by the street when I'm in town. \n\nThese days, the designation \"curviest street in the world\" makes it a tourist destination, not the Real World. Folks come to check out the street and drive slowly down its steep, windy roads. It's a sight to see if you're in the area but perhaps not worth going out of your way to come to if you're in town. But at dusk, when the sky is hues of pink and purple, and you can see the rest of SF in the distance, you can definitely see the appeal of visiting and spending a bit of time here. It certainly makes a great photo op.", "author": "Annette J."}

There are various bushes and shrubs along the narrow and curvy brick road. Cars may drive slowly down the hill, but drivers need to maneuver carefully among the congestion and tourists.

The 10-15 min walk will be faster than waiting for the cable car which runs every 20 min\n2. Standing on Lombard/Leavenworth corner gives uphill view of cars coming out \n3.

Lombard Street is basically this windy, zig zaggy road that goes down a hill with some nice views of San Francisco. It's easily accessible by car or on foot. \n\nWhen I was a kid, I thought Lombard Street was this giant hill that you had to climb in SF. Many years later when I revisited this attraction, I realized you can come here and soak in all there is to see on Lombard Street and leave within about 10-15 minutes. \n\nI've only come here during the night time and even though you can't see the city and streets as clearly, this place is still very beautiful. You can drive your car up and down Lombard Street or just take a stroll around it. There's stairs on both sides so you don't have to actually walk along the street itself. If you prefer to walk, there's parking all around on the streets; just follow the parking rules. \n\nIs this the best attraction in SF? Definitely not. But is it worth checking out and showing your friends? Of course! You may even just be walking around the city and perhaps come across this gem. It's not imposing on the city at all; it's just one of those cool things that are wedged into the beautiful city.\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

There are eight sharp and narrow turns that are said to make it the most crooked street in the world! The street is closed to public transportation, so the only way to drive crooked is to do it yourself (or an Uber.....but let's keep that one on the down low, lol). If you do not have access to a car you can easily visit because there is a Cable Car stop at the top of the street, making it easy for visitors to access the street. You can easily walk down some of the stairs that follow the same crazy path as the road. For those driving be advised that there are private driveways and garages at each turn, so please be respectful of those that live this crooked life daily.\n\nOverall I recommend making a stop to take in the most crooked street in the world, it's an interesting experience and the view from the top is actually quite nice, almost as good as the view looking up at the crazy turns!", "author": "Brian M."}

While the steps don't follow the exact zig zag of the street, it's still something to experience and say you've been there.  You can also get better pics of the street while on foot.\n\nI was appalled to read some negative experiences that residents on the street have endured, from urination on door stoops, to idiots climbing on  residential rooftops to snap \"better\" pictures, to personal bodily attacks from the people blocking driveways and getting honked at by homeowners to move out of the way.  As the world turns, a few a-holes ruin it for the rest of us, well-behaved travelers who enjoy the area while abiding by laws and showing respect for its residents.\n\nFACTS:\nBuilt in 1922.  Specifically designed because the cars of the time could not make it up/down its 27-degree grade.

There are small gardens that surround the winding brick road and when there are hundreds of people standing around taking pictures of it, we feel the urge to do the same.

Don't waste your time driving down it. Get out of your vehicle, snap your photos from the top, sides and, preferably at the best angle, the bottom of the winding road, then leave because there isn't much else to see here.

There were lots of people around taking photos from the start of the street.  \n\nWe took a few photos and made our way down the path.  We stopped at a few places to take photos and it wasn't too crowded so we could get decent shots.  It's lovely with the flowers planted along the street.  Walking down the street, you can see the entrances to the homes and also the car parked in the driveways.  I would think it's a pain living here to wait a long time to get on the street to get home.\n\nThe bottom of the street was busier than the top with lots of people taking photos.  Good thing the streets around aren't very busy so people can stand in the middle and take photos.

If you choose to walk, be sure to wear appropriate, non-skid footwear to safely gain access.\n\nThis one-block, eight-hairpin-turn section of Lombard Street, created in the 1920's to accommodate cars that could not maneuver the original 27% grade, is a picaresque sight for any tourist.  I particularly enjoyed the view from the bottom of the block, taking in views of the shrubbery and hydrangeas not yet in bloom (April) as well as sweeping views of East SF and Coit Tower.  Tourists were abound, standing in the middle of the street, selfie sticks and all, to gain their coveted photos.  Traffic police in the area did well to keep the cars moving down winding road as well as manage some of the more obstinate tourists who would not move for the cars trying to pass by.   \n\nMy second unintentional visit occurred while following a GPS to get back to my hotel.  Driving through the turns of this block was certainly an experience, but I am glad I had the opportunity to spend some time walking around and taking in the sights prior to.  The posted 5mph sign was strictly followed mostly due to the crowds that slow traffic.  I did marvel at the skill it must take for residents of this area to turn into their driveways from these curves.  \n\nI'm glad I had the opportunity to check out this famed sight of San Francisco but having seen it now, would probably pass by on future visits to the city.

Cars are coming down continuously and the street itself if extremely crowded by people so it is impossible to make a decent photo. But the main problem is that even if there was nobody you couldn't manage to make a nice photo of the street simply because there isn't a spot from which you can catch the curve. Simply nothing can be seen by standing on the street level. If you have a drone you  might be able to do nice shots otherwise forget it.

I went at night so the details weren't as visible, but the lights of the city... just breathtaking.  \n\nIf you're not driving in the city, take the cable car to get here. Walk a little into the curves to get better pictures.  There aren't any restrooms nearby and don't leave your trash.

Worth a Visit - Go Early in the AM to Beat the Crowds. \n\nMy mother and I visited the famous Lombard Street during the early morning of July 31st. \n\nWe were riding the Powell-Mason cable car and decided to hop off to check out Lombard Street. The Powell-Hyde cable car also stops here, but at the top of the street, while Powell-Mason stops at the bottom. The street is also easily accessible via MUNI bus (which is the cheaper and faster option, if you are not looking to experience the cable cars). \n\nLombard Street is one of the most crooked streets in the world. From where the cable car dropped us off, we hiked uphill on Lombard Street until we arrived at the base of the curvy section. There were huge and gorgeous flowers blooming along with lush vegetation growing in between the curves of the street. The street was lined on both sides with beautiful houses. There was a sidewalk with steps on both sides of the street which made it easier for walking up this very steep hill! \n\nWe arrived early in the morning to Lombard Street, at around 7 AM, which meant that there was nobody else there and we had the entire street to ourselves. It was lovely and the atmosphere was very peaceful, quiet, and relaxing, which I enjoyed (I very much dislike crowds of people). I highly recommend coming here early in the morning as well if you would like to avoid the throngs of people and crowds that would be there later in the morning and afternoon. \n\nAfter climbing to the top of Lombard, I was amazed at how high we were and we were rewarded with such incredible and beautiful views of the city! I could see Coit Tower, the downtown area, the bay and more. The photo opportunities from here were amazing. \n\nWe enjoyed the views at the top of Lombard for a little while before catching the Powell-Hyde cable car from the top of the hill, going towards Fisherman's Wharf. \n\nLombard Street may be popular but despite it being a huge tourist attraction, it was worth the visit for me!", "author": "Brittany T."}

I consulted for a tech company in San Francisco for 20+ years and on one of my first trips my co-worker and now best friend, John M drove me down this hill. I am glad he was driving because there is no way I would want to do it by myself. There is just too much pressure with all the tourists staring at me. \n\nThe name Lombard came from the street in Philadelphia. The curving back and forth design was first proposed by Carl Henry and in 1922 they built it. The design was created to reduce the hill's natural 27% grade, which is too steep for most cars. I am sure it was never intended to be a tourist attraction. It is funny how something that was created for a practical purpose becomes a tourist trap. \n\nI am just glad I had a local seasoned professional drive me down. You can do it yourself but beware of the other cars and tourists in your way. You also might want to get the full insurance on your rental car, just in case. Remember that this one block section of Lombard Street is steep with eight tight hairpin turns. Am I scaring you now?\n\nSan Francisco is an interesting place to drive and Lombard Street adds to that flavor. I've been freaked out in my rental car going over a hill and not being able to see the other side. How do they do those car chases in the movies? There is no way in real life a car could be going that fast over these hills. I must also say you haven't lived until you've parallel parked on a hill.

I'm terrified on standing on a skateboard alone, but I'll make this my roller-coaster ride.\n\nI took the hard way coming UP here: walked from Fisherman's Wharf, to Ghirardelli Square, circled Russian Hill Park, and hiked up Hyde St. Phew! Worked up a sweat. \n\nWas it worth it?\n\nWell...\n\nThe altitude of this part of Lombard Street is just like any other deep hill you'd find in San Francisco--except there's a zig-zag in between, but no one really walks down on it because it is jammed with traffic. Trying to stand in the middle of the top, just to get a photo is scary, with a vehicle coming right at you. I get it: the appeal is the zig-zag and there's a joy in watching cars pass by in an unparalleled manner, but there's no joy if I can't go down that hill. But it was fun to finally trek down somewhere, after all that climbing. It's hard to get a great picture when you're up at the top of the hill because there's dozens of cars coming in, and it is filled with tourists who are possibly acrophobic to walk down. A friend of my mother's, who is a long-time SF resident, told us the street used to be filled with flowers, and now looks like one huge pile of grass. Probably would've made a difference since it is pretty unique. \nThe only way I'd come back here again is if I were to go down the hill in some sort of transportation, whether it's a scooter, rollerblades, car, motorbike, whatever.", "author": "Sharon T."}

Safely located on either side of the road, are designated sidewalks that allow pedestrians to navigate the street without facing the danger of the giddy drivers who maybe more focused on the joy-ride.\n\nA gardner's dream. Beautiful gardens adorn and decorate the street with lush Hydrangeas, Rose Bushes and Boganvillia plants all over. \n\nThis is a tourist trap. Crowds of selfie and groups photo takers liter the area. Many of them choosing to ignore the \"stay out the street\" and \"stay off the wall\" posted signs in order to \"get that perfect picture\". What many didn't (or chose not to) realize is that the pathways and street run though private homes and may tourist seemed not to care that they were infringing on the personal properties of others. Maybe with English not being their language they didn't realize the interpretation of the signs. I saw one young lady stick her cell phone in a garden bed, just to get a photo and didn't care that she was technically trespassing. They owners were either not home or didn't care.\n\nOnce and You're Done. You've go to check it out at least once while you visit the Bay Area. If you feel adventurous then take it for a ride. A cable car stop is conveniently located at the top of the street, but if you have your own vehicle you may find one or two parking spots. For the gardeners out there, it's definitely a treat to see the flowers in bloom so, sprint would be a great time to visit!\n\nhttp://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d106232-r275292874-Lombard_Street-San_Francisco_California.html#", "author": "Philip T."}

It was fairly late in the evening, so there weren't a ton of other cars around.  We followed the car in front of us down at a very slow pace.  No one was behind us, so my boyfriend quickly zoomed around the block to go down again - he wanted to take the turns MUCH faster.  We made it about halfway down, brakes squealing, but came across another car going VERY slow and had to halt our NASCAR-speed attempt.  One more time around the block to give it one last shot - but by then there were several cars very slowly taking the trip down.

The only way to get there is obviously by going up a very steep hill. Cable cars run up and down the street, but on a weekend or time of day when tourists are around, the car will probably be full by the time it gets to you because a ton of dumb tourists have stood in a massive line at the starting point filling it up before it gets to any of the stops going up the street. You will just have to walk unless you specifically get a cab. Worse, the view when you get to the top isn't really that interesting. It will look better from the bottom looking up, so you'll have to walk down to really look at it anyway.\n\nDriving is just as unpleasant. Again, a ton of tourists will be forming a parade of cars to drive down the crooked curves.

This takes you to a four-way stop with a left onto Lombard, one block south of the winding road.  This seemed like a better option than the long line along Lombard.  \n\nBe careful of foreign tourists and idiots here....driving as a tourist in San Francisco is tricky enough but with the gawking and pedestrian traffic this is not relaxing for the driver.

Go to union square do shopping/eat and take the cable car from there. Cable car has stop right at top of croockedest street and then you can walk down on this street if you like. I felt this was an overrated attraction. Personally I think they made this street on purpose to attract tourist. They could have made similar street on the other side(you will see).\nYou can go there from Coit tower too. Not that far but be prepared to walk on slanted hilly roads.

The access point at Hyde street is easy enough to get to.  There were other cars descending, but they weren't a problem, they just moved on through.  The main issue was all the tourists on foot who were literally standing IN THE STREET trying to get pictures.\n\nGet out of the way!

It happens every Easter Sunday at 4PM...and yeah, I had never heard of it either until Jamie W. told me that crowds gather at the foot of the crookedest street in the world to see an army of thrill-seekers careening those sharp, brick-laden curves in their customized Big Wheels....yep, I mean those plastic, low-riding Mattel tricycles for ages 5-8.\n\nI guess I knew I was part of the hip crowd when I saw Justin of Justin.tv carrying his own Big Wheel up the hill to compete. Actually \"compete\" is not the right word since it is really more similar to the running of the bulls in Pamplona. However, instead of a potential goring by an aggressive Spanish bison, I imagine a skinned knee and long-term podiatry issues are the most one could endure in this sport.\n\nAs a spectator, I endured a suffocating atmosphere of carbon monoxide as autos were stuck in their tracks among the throngs of onlookers on the street. The actual race happens so quickly that you would barely notice it were it not for the roar of the crowd. But it is a typically eccentric event among many in San Francisco, and you sure can't beat the price.

No tickets needed, and no overpriced gift shops!\nSeriously, though, \"the crookedest street in the world\" is a must-see for any visitor to San Francisco. It' easy to get to with a quick trip on Van Ness St. either by car or bus, straight to Lombard. You'll be amazed by the slope of the hill leading up to it and if you're on foot, you might be quite winded by the time you get to the top. But, what a thrill to see the gorgeous view of the North Beach area of the city leading right down to Coit Tower, across the sparkling Bay and the Oakland Hills off in the distance.\nIf you have access to a car, you absolutely must drive down the street. Have a friend hold a camera out the window to shoot a video of the drive down. Too fun!\nOne slight disappointment is that, because of the angle of the street, you won't get a really super great picture of the street - not like the ones you see in postcards. You'd honestly have to be standing at the top of Coit Tower with a super zoom to really see the curves.\nNo matter.

It make me happy to see my friends/family in the passenger seat with the camera clicking non-stop when we are driving down Lombard street.\n\nSuggestion: It is fun driving up Lombard street from Van Ness since it is going upward and everyone is leaning back on the seat looking at the sky but it can ruin your brake pad/shoes and transmission gear. This can be really bad if you have to stop and move many times. My suggestion is to take Hyde street and turn into Lombard. You don't have to stay in line with all the tourist. \n\nIf you are driving from 101 South (Van ness), make a turn to Broadway and then left on Hyde. Hyde street is mostly 1 way street but near Lombard it is 2 way street. You can also drive thru the first Swenson Ice Cream shop while on Hyde Street. Hyde Street is where the cable car run so sometimes you have to be patience when driving behind them. \n\nAlso from the intersection of Hyde and Lombard, you can see both Coit Tower and Alcatraz on a clear day.

But, Lombard street isn't just any street, that's why it so many reviews - and is one of San Francisco's most popular tourist destinations. The best part about seeing Lombard Street when you're on vacation compared to anything else is that you can be at Lombard Street for 20 minutes or less and be completely satisfied. The curvy part of Lombard Street is one block and can easily be walked in about five or less minutes. I recommend starting at the bottom or top - does matter which is first and then walking up or down. Make sure to check out the view from different angles as you go up or down because you can see in the distance you can see both Coit Tower (which is only about a twenty minute away walk) and the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge. You definitely could drive down Lombard Street (one way only) which is a fun experience but walking it is much better because you can stop to take pictures at the top, bottom and all the beautiful landscaping along both sides.", "author": "Michael G."}

I see it all the time, cars backing up to Van Ness, and there's no reason to. If you come in the morning, you won't wait. Come before 9AM and you can drive down it over and over. \n\nIf you have no choice but to come in the afternoon/evening on the weekend, and you don't mind being a jerk, continue north on Van Ness to Francisco, take a right. Then follow the road as it curves up and to the right. This will put you on Larkin. Then take a left onto Lombard and your wait will be significantly less. \n\nDo enjoy, but if you get stuck in traffic, you've been warned, so please respect those living in the area and don't honk in frustration, I've heard enough vuvuzuela-type noises in the last month.", "author": "Jeff O."}

When I came here it was flooded with tourists, yes I was one too, but dang they took up the entire street. Walking down this street I was afraid what happens if I trip, but luckily I didn't. I wondered how cool it would be to rollerblade down this street. When I reached the bottom it was a pretty cool view to see all the cars moving in zig-zag movements. Argh darn those tourists! They reached the bottom, but they stood there and took a gazillion pictures. So all my pictures had them in it. Luckily I bought a postcard and it was tourist free.", "author": "Sandy C."}

Lombard Street?\n\nThis is a story about a Street. Stay with me peeps, this is not just any Street and we drove up and down it. Hubby drove, but I want to drive! It's my turn, it's my turn, watch out for that turn!. Ten hairpin turns in all makes for the world's crookedest Street. \n\nThe red bricked street has high cement curbs and beautiful flower gardens along the one way street. If you choose to go sailing down, chances are these will stop you in your tracks. Some of San Francisco's wealthiest Real Estate is along Lombard, with colorful Victorian mansions. The street was designed to be able to switch back down the one way hill. \n\nOnce on the top take a few minutes to view the magnificent city below, as well as the Coit Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and Fisherman's Wharf. \n\nIn 1922 a past resident thought up these switchbacks to ease traffic on this 27 degree slope.\n\nWhether you take in it's magnificent views by day or night, this is a must visit.  At night when no one else is around, you could take your foot off the brake, leave go of the wheel and play bumper cars.  My bad? I suggest you do not drink and drive.", "author": "DJ M."}

(Trying to sound enthusiastic while thinking about my brake-to-gas-at-a-stop-light-with-other-cars-all-around mishap from years ago.)\n\nMy vaca host was driving while P and I were snapping pictures of every steep hill we were about to ride down. \"Whooaaaaa\" Yeah, we are dorks! Whatever. It was fun. \n\nWe parked pretty close. I was puzzled by the crowd of people in the middle of the street. Like us, some had cameras with them. I thought it was the scene of an accident, but realized they were standing in front of the one-block marvel that is the famed crooked part of Lombard St.\n\nMy guess is that this block is so steep that they had to convert it to a one-way swerving lane. Garden beds of bella hortencia (sometimes called hydrangeas) graced the street. It was a one-block magical ride, like something out of a musical with pretty parasol ladies in pastels and gents in seersucker suits. There were sidewalks and smooth paved pathways on either sides of the block. *Cool* \n\nWe got back in the car to drive through it. No one swerved through it very fast unless they were begging to have a date with cell mate #691212. \n\nThere was no trouble finding another parking spot either. Yay! We made our way back over to the bottom of said block to gawk some more. It was hard to take pictures of the curvy lanes even with my arm stretched all the way up, so I had the bright idea of sitting totem-pole style on top of my 5'10\"  vaca host's shoulders. P snapped a picture of my butt as I climbed up there. I dunno why she did that. At least my butt is nice. I have to admit I was very scared up there. My vaca host told me to stop molesting his head.

On busy days, city police officers will be at the top of the hill, directing traffic and ticketing people who turn to enter the street from the wrong direction (believe it or not).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-07", "description": "Lombard Street is actually a long major street in San Francisco running east to west, however when mentioning the street the image of the \"most crooked street in America\" title comes to mind (that or any number of tv or movie references to the street you've ever seen). This curvy (about 8 hairpin turns) 1/4 mile section of Lombard is between Leavenworth and Hyde streets. The curvy section of the street was designed in 1922 due to it's extremely steep 27 degree incline. The street is paved with red bricks and features gorgeous landscaping both between the turns as well as along the staired pedestrian walkways on either side. If you're visiting and want to check out the street for yourself the best place to photograph it (if you have a 200mm or longer zoom) is several blocks away on Lombard and Stockton otherwise going right to the base of it is good too. Once you walk to the top of the curvy section (which is at Hyde St) then it's a very quiet and picturesque walk down Hyde to Ghirardelli Square and Fisherman's Wharf (or you could wait for the Hyde Street Cable Car ($5) to bring you down). In case you're wondering this isn't the only windy street in San Francisco (it is the best looking though) there's actually another one on Vermont between 20th and 22nd. If you're amused by the interesting streets of SF then it's worth going a couple blocks away to Filbert (between Hyde and Leavenworth) as this is one of the cities steepest streets.", "author": "Matt E."}
