The most painful thing around North Beach is the availability of street parking. Managed to find one after close to to 30 mins.\n\nMy impression/ review of most places breaks down as follows:\n\nAmbience (1/1): nice place, great history. Really liked the huge ceiling fans!\nService (1/1): attentive and quick service, friendly servers \nFood (1/1): Compliments to the chef for some tasty food. I wasn't super impressed by the plating or presentation. But hey! Everything tasted great.\nPortion Size (0/1): Typically for brunches since I am substituting two meals for one I expect to be stuffed. Comstock Saloon brunch will not do that for ya! We had three dishes and two drinks and I still have room for desserts ( which was one of the three dishes)\nPrice (0/1): for the amount of food and the general feeing of not being full, paying $70 seems a tad overpriced. I don't mind the price but not until it allows me to feel that I did sub two meals for one IMO.", "author": "Ellie P."}

What's the catch?  2 \"adult\" beverages (beers are fine) and it's yours.  \n\nIn celebration of Emperor Norton's 200th birthday on a Sunday, Comstock Saloon changed the game a bit:  Free Pork Belly Benedict was on offer with the same catch.  Worth a trip across the City?  I think so.  \n\nComstock Saloon is a fun place.  \n\nThis visit was my first time dining at Comstock though not my first time drinking there.  Drinking, I've always done in the front room which is impeccably old-timey but not quite as much so as the attached room behind it.  Both feature excellent bartenders who'll stir up visions of SF's Barbary Coast days in both grooming and dress.  It's authentic, not kitschy, and appropriate when you realize that they're plying their trade in San Francisco's second oldest bar.  \n\nThe back room is where you'll find the original \"air conditioner\" which needs to be seen rather than described.  Everything about the place seems from another (better?) time though in a way that works for today.  If you're a visitor to SF, this is a good bar from which to enjoy a taste of the City's past.   \n\nIf there's anywhere to celebrate old SF the Comstock is it and they were in full swing for this historic occasion.  I counted no less than 4 Emperor Nortons present and drinking as well as a host of women in old Victorian garb doing the same.   The food though, that's all 2018.\n\nThe free Pork Belly Benedict turned out to be more like a half order as I've never known Benedict to cover only 50% of an English Muffin or be served with only 1 egg.  It was good, but maybe a bit of deceptive advertising.  \n\nA burger ($15) was excellent even if it was served without fries (an extra $7, ouch).  The menu promised Malt Vinegar Chips but my server warned that they were on the burger, not beside it, and even though I wished for a burger with traditional sides I admit: this was a filling and delicious burger, perfect to sop up the alcohol you'll want to consume here.  \n\nCocktails are executed to perfection.  A Pisco Punch ($13) was man enough to confirm that I ought not have a second, even if it meant missing out on the free lunch.  Ditto on the Manhattan ($11).  Comstock Saloon also has Happy Hour deals which, despite the free lunch offering, might be a better value proposition.  \n\nI'll happily return for a stiff cocktail, a delicious burger, and a sample of San Francisco's history.

I give the place points for getting me and my boyfriend our drinks quickly and a unique atmosphere, but the bartenders here are just plain rude. \n\nAfter taking the payment for our drinks (I paid cash, boyfriend paid with card), the bartender disappeared to the back for 10 minutes. My boyfriend and I started to wonder where our change/card was so we asked another bartender who was standing by if we could get our change/card. The bartender sarcastically replied, \"Looks like you haven't even finished your drink but sure, I'll go find the other bartender\". That was a little offsetting but we didn't say anything to him \n\nOnce the original bartender returned, my boyfriend asked if everything went alright with the card (remind you he had been gone 10 minutes with it) and the bartender looked like we had said something bad and replied defensively and harshly that he was busy relieving a coworker? Ok no problem. My boyfriend replied, \"Oh ok sorry I just get paranoid sometimes when my card is missing for a long time\". The bartender replied, even more defensively, \"Why? Why would I do something with your card?\", rolled his eyes and finally gave us my cash and his card.\n\nWhen I received my change, he shorted me and I was too intimidated and didn't say anything because I didn't want to cause even more drama. We chugged our drinks (which weren't amazing tbh) and got out of there as quickly as we could. \n\nI hate leaving bad reviews but this just dampened the rest of the night and put us in bad moods.

Like any individual who has his/her credit card disappear, I became a tad worried. We politely asked another bartender to track the original bartender down. But he remarked \"you haven't even finished your drink, but sure, I'll track him down\" in a snarky and condescending tone. It was an offsetting comment, but we let it slide because we were getting concerned about the whereabouts of our card and money. \n\nThe original bartender finally came out, short-changed my girlfriend, and was combative and rude. He was offended that I would suggest foul play on his part, when all he had to say was \"my bad\" or \"I'm sorry.\" It appeared as if he went out of his way to be argumentative with me about it and made us feel very uncomfortable. \n\nMy girlfriend and I then chugged our drinks and left: ending what was a great night on a sour tone.

The Boot to the Head, for example, consists of a simple glass of Anchor Steam complimented with a shot of Four Roses bourbon which comes in the most adorable boot-shaped shot glass.

I went for brunch this past Sunday with a friend and we shared the shrimp and grits and tres leches French toast. Despite the fact we each ordered and wanted to share, the dishes came about 15 mins apart from each other, and were not worth the wait. The shrimp and grits was flavorful, but came with two whole fried shell-on shrimp on top that were very messy to de-shell and eat. See picture with this review. That was frustrating to have to prepare my own food after it was served. I would have much preferred two de-shelled or tail-on only shrimp that I could use my utensils to eat. In regards to the French toast, it was very flavorful, but unfortunately burned on the entire bottom. The whipped white chocolate Chantilly cream was very heavy and melting before it even reached our table. Personally, I would not recommend this restaurant for brunch as there are other places in North Beach with better foodservice.", "author": "Lauren C."}

I needed something less boozy as I needed to drive  us home. I've also started a love affair with Campari this past year, and I've come to appreciate that signature bitter flavor.

The fries was super salty and had a lot of spices on them, but the Miller ranch sauce was incredible!! Portions on the fries weren't huge, but decent for a parties of 3-4. \n\nDrinks: The 5 of us all ordered off the cocktail menu on the first page. None of us really enjoyed our drink a ton. One tasted like straight lemonade, one straight mint, one straight scorch, one straight bourbon, and mine (Greenbriar cocktail) tasted like straight water (I'm not an alcoholic I promise). A couple of us got another drink (no cocktails this time) but I refrained. Next time, I think I would order a specific drink from their very diverse selection of liquors to see if those are any better. They don't really have an extensive beer selection.\n\nAtmosphere: The ambiance of the place is the real reason to come here. It's dimly lit with spacious (room for 6) seating in semi-private booths divided so you can't see behind you). There was a jazz ensemble playing some easy jazz on the 2nd floor balcony. They came around after a set to collect tips but were super courteous about it. In our case, he came to our table about 2 minutes after we had sat down and asked if we had just arrived (we were all looking at menus). \n\nService: The waitress was attentive, even going so far as to admitting to her confusion after we switched the seating order (which changed the drink order) on her. She was quick and aware. All the staff was dressed professionally in black and the bartenders had ties on. \n\nThis would be a good place to come on an upscale date or in a small group for a drink or two, but don't expect to grab a casual beer here.", "author": "Jacob R."}

She shoved me so hard I almost fell. Not a great way to start the evening. Anyway we couldn't be served upstairs because it was reserved for a party (understandable). We went to the other side and sat at a table and she ended up being our waitress so I confronted her. I told her she shoved me really hard and almost knocked me over and she said she was sorry but she is busy with so much attitude. I told her she should really say excuse me instead of shoving people; being busy is no excuse to not have manners. She got upset and walked away. I'm glad she didn't service us, definitely didn't want someone who lacked the basic skills to handle customers. To make things even worse she went back to her fellow coworkers to talk about the situation where we all can see her/hear her. Whoever manages this place should really make her work in the back where she doesn't deal with customer interaction. I have never received so much attitude from a waitress. At least pretend to be genuine when saying sorry. I have worked in a bar/restaurant and I get that it gets busy but I have the basic skills in communicating if I needed to get through people.

A and I wanted to spend our evening in North Beach but didn't want Italian food so, after talking about going to Comstock for a while, decided to give it a try. I made a reservation on Open Table (do it or you will wait 5ever) and luckily, they had our table ready early since we were STARVING since we usually eat at 6. Comstock has an interesting setup with 2 bars/in different rooms. The longer room where the host stand has a second floor where live musing was playing overlooking the diners. We were sat in the back corner of the wider room near the kitchen. This space was cozy though we constantly felt a draft from the door opening and closing. Our host asked if we had been there before and gave us suggestions to order both the Fried Brussels Sprouts and Fisherman's Roll which was a nice touch.\n\nI really was excited to try their drinks and had plans to have two during the course of dinner since I couldn't decide on which to drink. I started with the Barkeep's Whimsy ($13) which allows the bartender to basically run wild and create a drink. The waitress asked for my likes and dislikes, the only of which I said I didn't like Whiskey. Not very helpful, I know, but I will try most anything else. A ordered a Manhattan since he is boring or \"classic\" as he likes to say. We probably waited about 10-15 minutes for our drinks which was fine since the bar was busy and there was only bartender. Most of Comstock Saloon's drinks are also labor intensive so extra time is expected. While we were waiting for our drinks, we ordered food. Now, both of us were really hungry so we got an appetizer in addition to our main courses. Shortly thereafter, our drinks came and I was pretty unhappy with what I was served. I don't even know what it was as our waiter just set them down without any explanation to what the bartender had made for me. It was really sour and had what we think is tequila and grapefruit. I was not a fan and was puckering the whole time I drank it. A's Manhattan was fine, an average Manhattan for sure. It was after our first tastes we decided we would not have 2 drinks here as originally planned.\n\nWe ate:\n\n-Fried Brussels Sprouts ($9): SO GOOD. Easily the best Brussels Sprouts ever. Thanks to the host for the recommendation! There was nothing healthy about these but they were a perfect appetizer. I wish I had ordered 2 for my main dish.\n-Fisherman's Roll ($18): My order which came with a side of fries. I was not a fan of the overall sandwich and was not expecting Shrimp/Mayo salad. I really don't love chicken salad or anything similar so I wasn't too happy with this. The fries were great though and not too greasy.\n-Comstock Burger ($17): This was my boyfriend's order and I wish I had gotten it. The burger was juicy and delicious. The fries were the same as mine.\n\nThe food was good, especially the brussels sprouts, but I feel like there are SO many places in the city with similar food and a similar ambience that it doesn't make sense for us to trek all the way up to North Beach. The drinks were underwhelming and, especially in that neighborhood, there are SO many good places to get a drink. I just can't picture us coming back.", "author": "Carrie W."}

We didn't see waitstaff for nearly ten whole minutes--and actually I wasn't sure at first that there were any.\n\nEventually two tables in the back opened up. Four of the girls took one table, and my husband and I took the other. About two minutes after this a server finally came out and without even making eye contact said, \"uh, we have a waiting list for these tables.\" And then walked away. No, \"would you like to get ON the list?\" or letting us know where we should go/should have gone to get actual service, a polite attitude, nothing.\n\nOn our way back out, we noticed the last two people who had been waiting with us had just ordered at the bar and were now just standing around near the doorway with their drinks.

I have to say though, I think the drinks at Devil's Acre were better but these were quite good, too! One complaint would be there were only 2 beers on tap which was kind of odd to me! Our appetizer of their potatoes were AMAZING. So tasty! I loved my kale salad. Husband loved his burger and fries.

We had planned on going to a few venues during the evening, but ended up spending the whole evening there - because of the bar staff and the quality of cocktails. We mentioned what we preferred or didn't for that matter to the bartender, and requested that he pair cocktails and snacks till closing time - and he did the job beautifully.\n\nIf you're in town and looking for a great low key, elegant, and fun place, I'd definitely recommend Comstock!", "author": "Priya P."}

That's a very interesting block to explore, right at the junction of chinatown and the Financial District.\n\nParking is street only which means there is no parking. Like most things in this area you are best served by getting here in some way that does not involve driving, but if needs must, there's a parking garage not too far away. \n\nThis is one of the more historical saloons in the area having housed the San Francisco Brewing Company right after the big one in 1906. It retains sections of the original bar counter and the architecture is clearly from another century.\n\nThe splendid bar offers counter seating for about a dozen or so, and there are some small barstool/table combos here and there for those that want (slightly) more privacy. One of the oddities is that this bar has two completely different entrances with slightly different physically separated sides to it. The difference is that one side has slightly better seating if you are coming here for more food then drink. The tap selection while small is decent. The wine list is offers much better choices then the beer, but the cocktails are where the action is at here. The happy hour is fairly epic, offering decent pricing on high quality items-house cocktails, select wines, beers/shot combos (the shot is served in a tiny glass boot.) and bar snacks. The menu is any too deep, but offers decent pairing for wine/beer snacking. Pricing is in the mid to high range a drink or tow and a light plate will hit you for about 20 bucks, more if you go the premium cocktail route.\n\nThis as you can imagine  is a popular spot and at peak times-happy hour, friday/saturday nights it'll be standing room only. The potential for wait times for a table is present at peak times, so some planning ahead might be in order.\n\nOverall a nearly perfect place for social drinking with great small plate options.", "author": "Steven W."}

Our service slapped the menus down and asked if we were eating dinner. We were initially taken aback - maybe his introduction was unintentional? and decided to stay for a round to check it out. We sat by the window to people watch although there was a live band in the second room of the bar. After a Negroni (which my husband said was delicious) and my glass of Cabernet, we decided to move elsewhere.

They've got that here. \n\nOr at least they did when my party of 5 came a few Saturdays ago for dinner. \n\nTo be honest, my time at Comstock was probably the first time I wasn't totally annoyed by having to hear jazz music while I'm doing something that I otherwise love (eating + drinking). The really good news was that the band is located on the second level of the place so they're out of site and because the place is already so loud, you can barely hear anything to be distracted by. With that, I will give them props that for a jazz hater like myself, this was the least offensive jazz music I've been acquainted with probably ever. \n\nWhat I did find to be turn off was that after the band stopped playing (which might as well have just been from someone's ipod since you can't see them from the lower level we were seated and it's fairly hard to hear with the general saloon noise and all), someone from the band went around to every table and seat with a jar to basically panhandle for tips as we ate our meal. It was strange and kind awkward and with a place as small as Comstock is, seems odd to even allow that because how much are they really going to collect in return for interrupting diners and just generally being uncomfortable. \n\nI don't know how often this occurrence is, so I'm going to give the benefit of doubt and go with an over-star rating because the service, atmosphere, and food otherwise were very good. \n\nI loved my wine and I got to try my first bourbon-soaked cherry. The menu was super San Francisco, with not a huge number of options, high-quality ingredients and more than casually priced dishes. \n\nI'd chowed down on some dive bar cheese and Ritz crackers as my pre-game so I wasn't super hungry, but did order the 'bucket of shrimp', which was exactly that- a big bucket full of ice chips with 6 shrimps hanging over the edge accompanied by 2 lemon slices and a side of cocktail sauce. It was shrimp - nothing much to report there. It was exactly as I ordered though I kind of wished I'd put the $15 that the shrimp bucket cost towards a real meal because the stuff my dining partners got looked far heartier and flavorful, further proving that all my regrets in life are food based. \n\nI'd love to come back on a regular, non-jazz weeknight for a drink and perhaps some food that doesn't come in a bucket for my next trip because I think they might def have it going on here.", "author": "Candice G."}

I order Manhattans like I order Diet Cokes: with pretty much every meal I have. Thus, if I say they make one of the best I've ever tasted, I'm not exaggerating. On the other hand, their Happy Hour special at this time--the Holland House--was only OK. Told it was 'citrus-y,' I didn't quite except the lemon to smack me in the jaw and override the gin entirely. Next time I'll try their famed Cherry Bounce--apparently listed \"one of the 50 best cocktails to try before you die.\" Considering the fact that a Cocktail Quest is pretty much exactly what I would seek to accomplish were I to know my specific expiration date, I appreciate this.\n\nNow for the special stuff: This saloon was started way back in 1907 (and the building itself housed the second oldest bar in San Francisco). It was named for Henry Comstock of the famed Comstock silver lode in Nevada. The space is extremely cool-looking, very frontier-chic, and one can imagine oneself in Edwardian shirtwaists or boating hats, sitting at the dark wooden bar under the framed 19th century illustrations and watching the horses and carriages clatter by. The effect is enhanced by the hipsters who frequent this place: their beards and waxed mustaches, their suspenders, bowler hats, and watch chains, and their adorable bobbed-hair, red-lipsticked girlfriends in their high-buttoned Mary Poppins shoes make you want to order a Sazerac, unfold the newspaper, rave about the Queen and bitch about the Kaiser.\n\nI'll be back for the food, too.

(Even though it literally took me 30 seconds just making eye contact with the bartender).\n\nThe other server we had at our table, a waitress with short-ish blonde hair, did the same thing as the other waiter after our large party arrived.  She asked if we'd like more drinks (sans any emotion on her face) and then waited about 15 seconds while the new arrivals scanned the menu and then strutted off without a word.  Wtf dude no one here can give guests at least a minute to make drink decisions?  Just the way she went about it came off really sh*tty and made us all feel like the wait staff didn't want us here at all.  \n\nShe came back again in about 10 minutes and did THE SAME THING.  She never took a single drink order, she came twice asking, and both times didn't wait more than 15 seconds before she left rolling her eyes.  \n\nWe weren't even being rowdy either, we were just chatting and trying to have a good time, but the servers totally ruined our time here due to their butthole attitudes.  \n\nIt was only after we ordered about 10 drinks did the original waiter with the grey hair and glasses start to act like he was a nice human.  (I'm 110% sure he just wanted our tips which is why he didn't want us going to the bar....)\n\nThanks for the drinks Comstock, but some of your waitstaff seriously need their attitudes checked, I would never come back to drop that much money and be treated like that, that's never ok in my book.", "author": "Christina L."}

This review is for the service. \n\nSarah L was our server, and unfortunately was probably having a very bad day. She kept taking the menus away from us (because they have a shortage), but we couldn't look at the drinks or discuss what was worth getting because she literally kept taking the menus away every chance she got. I asked three times (three!) and she said only when we were ready to order we could have them. A solution might be for every table give one menu, instead of taking three away every time? \n\nWe decided to just take photos of the menus but it still took ten minutes to even get the menu so we could take a photo. She completely forgot about an appetizer, never brought it up, gave us the check without us asking if we were finished, and also took the food menus away from us while we were eating our appetizers (before we had ordered our main courses). \n\nWe were here for a birthday dinner and honestly the hostility was just so much it really impacted us.

Their wine menu also spans several pages of their hip, leather-bound drink menus.   I got the Black Butte Porter, which the bartender poured for me so I didn't have to embarass myself, which was nice.   Their draft beer selection is only two beers though, which surprised me.   What's a gastropub without a decent selection of pitchers to split?\n\nMy friend and I also ordered the bacon-infused potato fritters, which was yet-another name for mashed potato bites that seem to be growing enormously in popularity.  These were pretty tasty though; served piping hot with a dipping sauce that I can't quite remember anything about other than that it was good.  I'm sure the other menu items are just as tasty and freshly prepped, though.\n\nAmbiance is clean, quiet, and dark.

The happy find was the Manhattan ($9).\n\n-Tasty?  The pickled egg you can tell is pickled only if you eat it by itself, but if you eat it the way the Hangtown Toast intended, which is one strip of crispy bacon with a slice of egg on top, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fL02NLRFLMQT7Pot44gxhA?select=4CPZjVcYH6OtiLTaf_Bj8w  then the pickled flavor is lost (not necessarily a bad thing).\n\nAs for the Manhattan, it was the Perfect Manhattan, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fL02NLRFLMQT7Pot44gxhA?select=yedEYQMWfIDfLfYQw2z_zQ confirmed by my Manhattan/Old Fashioned-loving hubby.   The sweet vermouth was just right.  This makes the 5th star on this review.  The 3 Brandy cherries skewered and sitting in the drink were fantastic.  These tiny cherries had the right balance of sweetness and tartness, and none of the fake chemical taste of a Maraschino cherry.  I loved these cherries.\n\nThankfully these awesome brandy cherries also exist in the Cherry Bounce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fL02NLRFLMQT7Pot44gxhA?select=Xl8Odl28IEdDP4Hl1iletQ, which was Bourbon, cherry brandy, lemon, Angostura, and Champagne.  $10.  I normally associate Cherry with cough syrup but this was absolutely delicious.\n\nWe also ordered the $8 Corn Fritters.  These were delicious as well.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fL02NLRFLMQT7Pot44gxhA?select=IzT71zUxdE9z_Ll8UjZX-w\n\nWhile Nacho got a second Manhattan, I got a Lagavulin 16-year (Scotch - Islay) to try.  It's peaty.  I still prefer Speyside more.  This Lagavulin was a generous pour, but at $16, I expected it to be. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fL02NLRFLMQT7Pot44gxhA?select=N3KvQAF0EJsklIgclq4GGQ\n\n-Service:  Friendly - from the hostess to our waiter to the bus boys, they were all nice, attentive and our water glasses were always promptly filled.\n\n-Ambiance: There's a tiny outside area but inside is best when there's a band playing.  On this particular night, a jazz trio filled the air.  What's not cool about them is that they came downstairs and hawked for money twice during their short show.  As for seating, there is the long bar, some booths and a couple of tiny table.  I didn't visit the back (which was promised to be quieter), but be assured that this place is happening.\n\nIf you happen to find yourself in the area during the day, they offer \"free lunch\" with a 2 drink minimum on week days.  The lunch items are light bites like sandwiches, etc.  I recommend lunch somewhere else.\n\n-Worth the trip/try?  Definitely.  If you are new to the area, ignore Google Map's pin.  This place is north of Happy Donut/Lifemark at the Pacific/Kearny/Columbus junction.  It's more like Pacific and Columbus.  \n\nHonestly, the Pickled Egg/Hangtown Toast itself was not worth $6 (1 sliced boiled egg on a few strips of bacon) - but if you're gonna hit all 100 things on the 7x7, then go for it.   \n\nIf you're with great company, have an appreciation of jazz music and a hankering for delicious drinks, Comstock is your place on any night.", "author": "Winnie L."}

Such magic everywhere....\n\nAmidst the sparkle and pop of amateur firecrackers outside the front door, I basked in the glow of my South Side - beautiful.

My husband and I were greeted at the door by a very nice young woman who took us to a very nice part of the bar area where we could see everything.  We asked a cocktail questions to find the best fit and even though we had dinner reservations we went for their oysters and fried cheese balls (and excuse me for not typing the proper name for it).  What a delight it was.... the oysters were fresh, the sauces were perfectly made.  And when those fried cheese balls arrived with this creamy sauce on the bottom, I almost passed out.  Had we not had other plans we would have tried everything on their modest but delicious menu.  \n\nI will conclude by saying for some reason we got super special love that night by the waiter who may have been the owner of the place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-22", "description": "I am editing this review based on recent experiences at (trying to get into) this place.  \n\nAlthough everything I said in my original review is true, I feel I must warn potential customers that the \"greeter\" (tall man at the doorway) has consistently been the most negative aspect of this entire establishment.  I've been told by him (sarcastically) to both get/not get a reservation.  One time I was asked \"Why would you bother getting a reservation tonight?\"  and another time I was asked \"Maybe you should consider getting a reservation next time (with an extremely sardonic tone).\"   Whether I should or shouldn't get a reservation is beside the point - The greeter is suppose to make you feel welcome and put on a good face for the institution.  On the most recent visit, I was accompanied by a few Asian friends.  When the greeter saw them he said \"Maybe you guys would be happier at Mr. Bings across the street.\"  The addition of a racist suggestion to an already caustic tone was enough to turn me off of this place forever.  \n\nUnfortunately, the beautiful idea and environment that is Comstock Saloon is forever masked by the hideous face that is the greeter.  \n\nGo to this place and try to make it beyond Cerberus.  If you can, it will be a real treat!   \n\nOriginal Review:\nComstock Saloon occupies a very special place in my heart.  Walking in the doors is like walking back in time.  It has actually been open since 1907!  There are original wooden articles everywhere - a bar, alcohol rack and old-style pulley paddle fans (it is unclear whether these are made from wood or metal as they are rather high up).  However, the piece de resistance is definitely the live jazz music pouring down on you from the (slightly) hidden mezzanine.  \n\nLive music generally begins around 7:30 PM and lasts for hours.  The performers I have seen are all spectacular.  They range from lone singers majestically accompanying themselves on the piano, to 3 and 4 piece jazz bands (with piano, string bass, Flugel instrumentation).  If you are listening to the larger bands, choose your seat location wisely.  Since the musicians are in the mezzanine, the horns tend to project directly down towards specific tables.  It can become extremely loud and prevent you from having any conversations that aren't shouting matches.  \n\nThe drink and food menu is extensive and full of quality items.  I have certainly not tried everything on the menu, but of the cocktails I would recommend Blood and Sand (Scotch, sweet vermouth, orange, and cherry liqueur) and White Lily (with absinthe and rum - very strong!).  My personal favorite appetizer is the Scotch Egg.  For those of you who do not know, this is a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat, coated in bread crumbs and baked or deep-fried.  It is a delightfully heavy British food.  The prices here are fair, but certainly not cheap.  It therefore attracts a more mature and well-dressed crowd.\n\nThe bar setting is speakeasy-like.  Since windows are in abundance here, it does not really feel like a speakeasy until after sunset when the windows seem to disappear and the dim lights inside emit a cozy glow.  At this point, you begin forgetting where you are and drift into that lull that only jazz and good drinks can bring you to.", "author": "James Y."}

She was totally cool about splitting our tabs, too, which I always appreciate. \n\nMy one complaint is that it wasn't a very convenient spot for a group to just stop in and hang... the bar area is very narrow and the seats were reserved for those ordering food.

There was only one bar tender so service was a tad slow, but, he was very good at mixing drinks. A bit of a show for each one and he seemed to take pride in it. Lots of interesting things on the cocktail menu. Although the beer selection was not memorable.\n\nWe also had reservations that night for dinner. When I asked the bar tender who to speak to, the host seemed to just appear out of nowhere and even knew who I was. He already had a 'reserved' tag on our table. And they easily transferred the bar tab to the table.\n\nThe menu for dinner wasn't super exciting. Not a ton of variety, but good enough considering the overall experience. I had the sausage polenta dish while she had the half-chicken. Both very good, but not blow-away. I recall more seafood options. The quality was there. A bit pricey, but hey, this is North Beach SF so that's to be expected.\n\nThe kicker was the excellent customer service. Everyone from the bar tender to the host to the server was so nice and accommodating. We felt very welcomed and not rushed like at some other places. I can't speak for other days of the week, but at least for a Sunday this was a very pleasant experience overall. We'd definitely consider going back even though it's a bit of a trek.\n\nAlso!

We needed some substance to soak up some of the alcoholic libations in which we partook.  The beef shank & bone marrow pot-pie, arugula salad sounded like just the thing to settle down our tummies.  I guess the crust did the trick, but it was the saddest excuse for a pot-pie ever.  Pot-pies should have some savory gravy soupy stuff to complement succulent chunks of meats and vegetables.  There was no soup or gravy.  It was SO dry.\n\nThe only thing saving Comstock Saloon from 1 star after the disappointing pot-pie was the friendly efficiency of the hostess, and the clever skill of the bartender.

They also have a bartenders choice that many of my friends opted for, the bartenders--despite being busy and crowded--listened to the likes and dislikes of their customers which left everyone very satisfied.

Customer service tends to run a little slow so do not go here if you are looking for speedy service that gets you in and out.  Also...you will get treated much better if you say you are having food rather than just drinks.\n\nI did want to yelp about the rude/awkward experience on 4/8/15 at around 9pm.  We arrived and asked for a table for the two of us.  There was a booth that just opened up and we were hoping to get it.  There was no wait, just us on a Tuesday night, and it looked like our wishes would be granted.  As the hostess approached she pointed to a table for two right by the door.  I asked her if we could have the booth instead because we didn't want to sit by the entrance door.  Her response was something along the lines of: \"...but the door doesn't open very often and it is not very cold for it to be an issue.\"  Two things wrong here: 1) She assumed I was going to be cold when the issue was it was a squishy spot 2) There was a booth and no wait so why not a booth for us?  I looked at her and said, \"So you're answer is 'no,' we cannot have a booth?\"  She insisted that the table was fine, which we would have taken if there was a large party that needed it, but there was no one on the waitlist, just us.  The hostess then made an unhappy face and asked if we were just having drinks.  We advised we wanted have a meal with drinks.  This was when things shifted in our favor.  She happily sat us in that booth.  So lesson is: they don't really want to do much for you if you are just having drinks...but if you let them know you are having a a meal...customer service will increase by 100%.\n\nI'm glad customer service got better when we said we were ordering food as our bill came out to about $125 for two people and at that price range, I believe good customer service  should come with it, right?", "author": "Tara K."}

And I do mean an honest-to-goodness meal. This is not some sad deli sandwich thrown together carelessly. It is chef's whim, however, so there's only one option per week. \n\nOn this particular Friday, my girlfriend and I were delighted to try the \"bunny in a bun\" which is a cute name for what turned out to be a rabbit salad, lightly dressed with currants and served on a toasted brioche bun, with a frisee salad on the side. If you've never had rabbit, just know that it doesn't really taste like chicken (our waiter described it as being more similar to dark meat turkey, which makes sense to me). And most importantly, this was a really excellent sandwich. If they offered this on the regular lunch menu, I'd totally order it again!\n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed the special house cocktails ... I started with cherry bounce (the brandy soaked cherries are a delightful garnish) and followed up with the shotgun wedding (very minty & refreshing).\n\nService was impeccable and our waiter made excellent recommendations as well. All in all, Comstock Saloon offers a great deal when you consider the quality of the meal and drinks, but it's not an everyday lunch spot either unless you're taking advantage of a company expense account...or indulge part in 2-cocktail lunches on the regular ;) But absolutely worth the splurge for a special lunch to wind down the week!", "author": "Jenny N."}

Out of everything that evening he was the one who ruined my meal and my appetite. \n\nNeedless to say I will never be eating here again.  Not because of the slowness of the meal, but solely because of the way I was treated as a paying customer by the manager.", "author": "Rose Z."}

The place is decorated really well and has a great ambience, feels like a nice cozy place to grab a drink and something to eat. \n\nWe ordered a few appetizers and an entree to split. The tater tots were nice and the pork sliders on biscuits were great as well. Just a heads up though - the sliders came out right off the stove and when I took a bite, really hot oil/juices squirted out and kind of scalded my hand, so maybe let the sliders sit for a bit before you take a bite. Despite the too hot juices, the sliders were delicious. \n\nIn addition to the two appetizers we got the duck pot pie, which was scrumptious. It was a great hearty dish but with just the right portion size so we didn't feel uncomfortably full despite the two starchy/meaty appetizers we'd gotten. We ate every bite of everything we ordered!\n\nFor drinks we tried the Pisco Punch and the Cherry Bounce, both of which were great. My favorite was the Bartenders Choice, where the bartender mixes you a drink of his choosing. Unfortunately I don't remember what was in it. They also had some live music going which was great.\n\nThis is a great place to come with a date or a few friends to have a drink and some good, quality (but not fussy) food. Perfect for a midweek pick me up but also great for a weekend.", "author": "Yishian Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-20", "description": "The Good: Lovely decor/atmosphere, great roast chicken, attentive bus staff (our water glasses were always full), reasonably priced.  \n\nThe Bad: Everything from a glass of wine, to a cocktail, to a plate of oysters, to a hamburger took much too long: 10-15mins for a drink, close to an hour between courses. The place is crowded and insanely loud, making it hard to get anyone's attention (except the great bus people who seem to be everywhere).  The food was decent, but not great (except for the fab roast chicken), not really worth the wait.   After 2+hrs we were dying to get out of there, making the finale all the more frustrating. As we were waiting for our bill (I had to literally reach out of the booth and grab a server who wasn't ours as he walked by) the nice hostess came over and asked if we needed anything else because she needed our table.  Uh...are you serious?  We had to wait a ridiculous amount of time for everything and then we were asked to hurry up and go. Give me a break. \n\nThe Ugly: Is it a bar or a restaurant? A tall, gruff gentleman (manager?) told many of us, as we tried to fight the crowd to get to our table, that it is a restaurant.  I understand that they serve food, but if you're going to *insist* that you're a \"restaurant\" then there needs to be a MUCH greater focus on customer enjoyment/comfort. \nWe were not allowed to keep food menus at the table because they \"are paper and they'll get ruined\". And though the cocktail menus are bound (\"in leather, so please be careful\") we couldn't keep one of them either because there were not enough to go around. Huh?   \nThe live music is a nice touch and very good but the volume level is *ridiculous* for a meal (we were screaming at each other).  As was the fact that one of musicians came to our table, plopped down a big tip jar and stood there until we put money into it.  It was bizarre and awkward and not what I'm looking for at dinner. We asked him if it was possible to turn down the volume and I could swear it actually got louder.  It's also unfortunate that staff members (ala tall, gruff guy) clap extremely loudly at the end of each song and give patrons the stink eye if they don't also. So we're supposed to stop our conversations to acknowledge the band every few minutes? \nOnce again, I am at a restaurant or at a bar/club? Everything about the place, including the level and type of customer focus/service, makes it feel like a bar. \n\nSo, if you're looking for a lovely, lively, loud bar that serves decent food and cocktails (and you're not in a rush) then I'd recommend Comstock.  If you're looking for a restaurant experience I'd suggest you go elsewhere.", "author": "Ellen H."}

I hadn't had a real meal in about a day, and I was running on empty energy-wise, but I was still distracted by my dissatisfaction with the food. It could be that my tastebuds were off after all the travel, but one of my dining companions shared similar thoughts without my prompting.\n\nThe brasserie-style elegance and the confidently comforting service hit its marks, saving this review from being two stars, but leading me to expect similar attention to the execution of the menu. We shared a solid sardine starter, with a satisfying balance of fishiness and tartness. The pretzel, apparently famous, failed to impress me--I'm a fan of anything doughy, but I didn't get why this dough was good enough to make into its own dish. I love avocado, but the bread in the \"Alligator Pear\" toast was so charred as to taste irrevocably burnt. \n\nI'd forgive these starter slight missteps for a good oyster po' boy--indeed, I'd forgive a lot of things for a crusty loaf overloaded with crisp lettuce and fat oysters. Instead, I got a plate of salt, from which I eventually just picked out the few shriveled (and oversalted) oysters and left the rest. I know I'm more sensitive to salt than most, but I couldn't handle this--even the salad tasted salty to me. \n\nComstock Saloon, for all its charms, has left me bitter.", "author": "Alice S."}

They added to the very cool, hip vibe - a little more casual and a whole lot less exclusive than Bourbon and Branch.\n\nI've noticed that other reviewers have said this is a good place for groups. I think this might depend on the time of night. There's a big area with various forms of seating toward the back. However, the rest of the bar is booths that fit maybe 4 people per side. We came with a rather large group of around 15, and this made seating difficult. We ended up squishing 5 people per side of the booth, and everyone else stood around the end. Regardless of the ruckus we caused, our waiter was quite pleasant and took our orders very quickly. He remained attentive and witty throughout the night.\n\nThe bartenders themselves knew how to make a great drink. Try the Saint's Buck - it looks like a girly drink (yes, it has ginger beer), but it's actually quite strong. The brandy adds a bite. Three of us in our party tried the Manhattan - it was smooth and worthy of its fame.\n\nMy favorite part of the night was ordering my Pimm's cup! For $10, you get a beer mug full of Pimm's, soda, and an extra shot of gin. The garnishes were over-the-top. The entire group thought it looked great. It tasted pretty good as well.\n\nThe crowd was a little bit older than your typical North Beach night scene.

And I would've had to badmouth you all over town, but I can't.  Because of your fritters.\n\nCoworkers and I were hungry and wanted a drink after work on a Friday.  We walked to Enrico's only to find that there was a private event going on, and that they wouldn't be open til 8:30.  8:30!!  It was only 5:30, and we wanted fuud.  Stat.\n\nSo we walked around the corner and saw a few empty tables at Comstock Saloon, a place none of us had ever been.  We were seated right away after telling the host that we were expecting 4-6 people (there were only 2 of us at first).  He said sure, and then gave us a table for 4, telling us that he could add on chairs later.  Happy hour drink special was $6 for a beer and shot, but they only had 3 choices.\n\nThe two of us ordered drinks: a South Side (like a very minty mojito) for her and a Pisco Punch for me.  We were joined shortly by two others, and one had a Sierra Nevada and the other a Grey Goose Pineapple.  All the drinks (besides the beer) were really, really, REALLY strong.  Ick.  We're no strangers to alcohol, but none of us could handle my Pisco Punch (which, when made correctly, is very delicious).  Even the Grey Goose Pineapple was primarily vodka.\n\nWhen another person showed up, we pulled a chair from the neighboring table, which was empty.  A few minutes later, the host came back to tell us that we couldn't just start pulling chairs because there would be none for the other table.  Um, okay.. like you have no other chairs for the invisible people?  Awesome.\n\nWe decided to order the jalapeno corn fritters, and there were about 6 in each order.  Fried to perfection and drizzled with lime juice, they were heavenly with the way-too-strong drinks.  Two of my coworkers ordered another drink, and after they didn't show up for 20 minutes, we asked a different waiter, who was bringing a drink for someone else, where ours were.  He asked us when we ordered it, to which we responded, \"20 minutes ago.\"\n\n\"They're coming out.\"\n\"Can you please check on it for us?  It's been 20 minutes and we haven't gotten the drinks.\"\n\"Once we put it in the computer it's made.\"\n\"Well, we feel like this is a valid concern - we have been waiting 20 minutes for two drinks.\"\n\"Look.  There are 10 of us bartenders and we're trying to make drinks for 50 people.\"\n\nAnd with that, he walked away.  Excuse me??  No, you are not trying to make drinks for 50 people ALL AT ONCE because the tables aren't even filled up.  And what is WITH THE ATTITUDE?\n\nWe decided to order another thing of fritters, plus the pig in a biscuit, and the Picnic Plate, which consisted of toasted bread, some ham, a bean salad, \"cole slaw,\" a small scoop of pate, and three cherries.  Luckily these came out pretty quickly.\n\nAfter the two drinks finally arrived, we noticed that one of them was in a smaller glass than the other one, yet they were charging the same price.  Another coworker ordered another drink, and again it took more than 15 minutes, and we had to flag down another waiter to get the status check.\n\nThe host came back and told us that we couldn't keep pulling chairs (there were 6 of us now), even though the waitress gave us an extra one.  We told him that there was no one at the other table, and that one of us would be leaving soon, so the other table could have the chair back.  The host kept giving us attitude about not taking another chair.  LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHAIRS, SRSLY?\n\nThe picnic plate was probably the worst thing I had in a long time (next to the time I found dead moths in my box of cereal that had been opened for a few months).  The bread slices were small, the ham was overly cured and tasted like a way-too-salty prosciutto, and the cole slaw was pretty much a very sour, salty cabbage.  The bean salad lacked flavor, and seriously, three cherries?  I didn't bother eating them.\n\nI peaced out of here before the bill arrived (don't worry, I paid my share!) and decided that I would never, ever come back, except maybe to order some fritters to-go.  NONE of us could finish my drink because it was so awful - way WAY too strong.  Everyone else's drinks were overly strong too, but not as strong as mine.  I hate leaving anywhere unsatisfied to that extent, because in this case, it wasn't just the drinks and some of the food that sucked, it was the service too.\n\nCompletely and utterly disappointing for such a cute little place.", "author": "Tori S."}

Unfortunately, my poor planning resulted in never getting to eat a proper dinner here, and instead indulging in drinks and a post-dinner picnic plate. I have no regrets. The pot pie will just have to wait until next time.\n\nTheir drinks are well mixed, but a bit pricey. Some of the drinks are Bourbon and Branch prices, and while the ambiance was good, it wasn't Bourbon and Branch by a long shot. It was just a hair shy of the quality of 15 Romolo's cocktails, actually, so I would consider these a little overpriced.\n\nTheir picnic plate was just what the doctor ordered. I don't remember what I'd had to eat that night, but I'm pretty sure it was enough for dinner. I don't know why I suddenly decided that my contribution to a picnic plate with meats and pickles was necessary, but I'm sure glad I decided that.

They went all out -- from the Indian totems to the curio cabinets, these nifty spinning fans, and more, the decorations spoke for themselves.  The live band playing in the overhang won my heart.  I can't remember the band's name for the life of me, all I know is that I had a great time!\n\nMy boyfriend and I sat at the bar for a few hours.

We sipped, conversed, and laughed all night.\n\nOur bartender, Jeff, made sure that we never went thirsty.  He even answered my curious questions about bartending practices.  I pretty much learned all that I need to know about bartending in that one night.  At one point, my boyfriend decided to try Jeff's specialty mixed drink (containing spices, hot sauce, and other ingredients that we guessed).

The shell was the perfect burnt and flaky buttery crust, and although the inside had good big chucks of steak, that's all it really was.  Not the pot pie with cream or goo, just a hunk 'o steak with a thin crust around it.  I could see the parts where the bone marrow was neatly placed onto, but frankly the tiny strands weren't enough.

The mild soft white cheese with the pepper jelly (think like what you dip Thai spring rolls in) made for a fun dipping experience, though I could definitely eat the crackers alone.\n\nPig in a Biscuit: Three pulled pork sliders on buttery biscuit rounds.  The fat from the pork and from the biscuits was a little overwhelming and would have been better if cut with vinegar or something spicy.  Despite that, still more interesting than a BBQ laden pork slider on some boring bun.\n\nChicken-Fried Rabbit: I felt like Jessica Simpson when I ordered this - \"Is it chicken or is it rabbit?\"  It was rabbit that tasted a bit like chicken karaage since it was very must like chewy and juicy dark meat.  Bread and deep fry anything and it won't be half bad.  Nice bar snack, but really didn't let the rabbit shine.\n\nHouse-Corned Brisket: A full corned beef supper treated like a charcuterie plate.  Bite sized everything (corned beef, cabbage, potatoes) with rye crostini to assemble your snack and then smear grainy mustard on top.  The corned beef was firm, yet tender though doesn't compare with old time favorites like Tommy's Joynt.  I personally like that it was snack size because the proper meal is often gut wrenching, though I can imagine some folks would feel gypped.  \n\nBeef Shank & Bone Marrow Pot Pie: Like one of those flaky handheld Australian meat and gravy pies.  There were no bones to extract marrow from so it must have been integrated into the mix.  Extremely savory and salty pie filling.  Too intense for one person alone, so glad I was sharing.\n\nShortcake: Was hoping for the maple bourbon pudding, but they weren't serving it when I was there (despite being listed on the menu).  This dish was worthwhile due to the fluffiness of the bread.  It was a pleasant departure from the chalky scone-like standard.  Of course the macerated berries and fresh whipped cream are always appreciated.", "author": "Adam B."}

The waiters and bartenders were all dressed up like the old'en days. its pretty neat.\n\n A simple delicious small (but everything on there is good) menu, yummy (sometimes really strong) drinks, really delicious coffee (french press), old fashion saloon style decor.

Its on the small side. only 2 pieces of egg, but it has bacon and this sauce on it that makes for wonderful tasting bites.\n2. Potatoes with cheese curd - It's like a poutine and very good!

I have previously been here for their bar scene, which can really be a totally separate review.  Their drinks are made by some of the best bartenders in the city and if you do not find anything on their cocktail menu that inspires you, then go for the barkeeps whimsy where they will create a cocktail for you based on what spirits/tastes you prefer.  I have yet to receive a bad drink here.  Yet...I digress from the main review from the meal...\n\nSnacks: Do not miss the BBQ chips with Ranch.  I know....you are thinking why pay for something that you probably have at home and can eat on the couch.  I even gave my husband a questionable look when he ordered it and I will repeat what he told me \"Trust me\".  These are made from scratch chips with just a sprinkling of BBQ seasoning and O.M.G. the Ranch.  It is thick, creamy, and perfectly balanced.  I would smear that on toast, my steak, eggs, pretty much anything.  It was to die for.\n\nApps: We ordered the green salad with sweet herbs, fried grits, and buttermilk lime dressing.  Hands down the best part of this salad is the fried grits.  They more resemble small croutons and are delicious.  The buttermilk lime dressing gave the salad a nice tang.\nWe also ordered the corn fritters with jalapenos which were o.k. by themselves however when eaten all together with the jalapenos and dipped in the accompanying pepper dip they were excellent.\n\nMain courses:  The husband ordered their steak which he said was cooked to perfection at medium rare.  They served it with heirloom tomatoes that had sat there and soaked up the juices of the steak.  Those were phenomenal and I think they should create an appetizer from just those being marinated in steak drippings.\nI had the chicken pot pie which was filling and tasty.  I could have gone for a more flakier crust, however it was a cold evening and it hit the spot.\n\nService:  Impeccable.  Our waiter was friendly, informative, and attentive.  \n\nAtmosphere: I love the cozy dining room and the saloon feel to the place.  It is a hideaway where you can run and have a moment of peace after a busy day with a good meal and cocktail.\n\nOverall this place is great.  If we lived closer i.e. in the city and didn't have to fight for parking in North Beach, we would be there more often.  Whether it is for a quick night cap or a sit-down meal, you really can't go wrong at Comstock.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

In fact, I tout their Sazerac solutions on the regular, even more so now that I've recently deemed Rye's mixture a bit too sweet to the tooth for my taste. However, I know now that a good thing taken with a little extra sugar trumps primped perfection served with the veiled vinegar of prejudice any day. \n\nI am a semi-regular at this vintage piss-trough of a bar (the vintage piss-trough being a good thing) and I even know a few of the staff by name though I'm sure they'd be hard put to remember mine if they can't even recall the names of the music-makers that nightly imbibe the joint with a jaunty, jazz-age vibe. No matter; faces and names are not the beef at stake here. My quarrel stems from personnel who find it necessary to remind patrons to tip the waitstaff for their toils. Really? No, freaking duh. \n\nBut it IS tacky to address this issue, no? I do hate to bring it up but here it comes; you started it.\n\nWe left a $12 tip for a $54 not because you or anyone else reminded us to do so but because that's what you do. \n\nSure, Americans may find their culture lacking in certain aspects, especially when compared to the rich dynasties and sophisticated histories of nations abroad, but dammit do we ever have our culture of tipping and proper cocktail crafting on lock-down. If my party of Sazerac-curious friends I brought in last night were assumed by staff to have \"discovered\" the place in an as seen on TV feature then we couldn't help but conversely assume that the staff appraised our less than FiDi-after-five attire (dress-code?) to be appropriate for streetside seating, not to mention, again, that tacky little reminder concerning service compensation. Blech. \n\nThe overall unspoken vibe at Comstock last night rang derisive, and I'm embittered by the voiced affront that suggested our party as part of wave of second-class flotsam washed ashore via Fisherman's Wharf.

The food was a hit and miss. The sardine toast was very tasty. The beet salad was yummy too. We also ordered marin miyagis that came out at room temp (boo!) and the side of lamb meatballs that were left uneaten because they were unacceptably salty. The other BIG bummer (those meatballs being the biggest)  was the crowd that hugged up against the bar. Loud obnoxious tourists that drowned out the mediocre rag time band that was doing their best up in the rafters. Too bad this bar doesn't exist on a road less traveled.", "author": "Angela M."}

Old West feel with really cool fans above the bar. What a great space!\n\nWe had the Rabbit 3-Way appetizer, the beef shank pot pie & the Cioppino. Dessert was the banana burbon pudding. For drinks we both had the Blood & Sand.\n\nRabbit 3-way: Love the concept. Fried rabbit nuggets, rabbit terrine & rabbit rillette. Execution was not as great as the concept. Seemed dry, over-salted and not especially exciting.\n\nBeef Shank Pot Pie: Boyfriend enjoyed this but said the bottom of the pie crust was soggy.\n\nCioppino: The sauce in this was outstanding. Spicy & flavorful. However, they were very skimpy on the seafood: I counted 4 mussels, 3 small chunks of fish and a lump of crabmeat. I don't know about you but when I order cioppino, I expect to see the entire SEA up in that bowl. Served with a sourdough crostini which was a nice touch.\n\nBurbon Pudding: Delicious! This was the highlight of the meal.\n\nBlood & Sand: What I expected but not very strong.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the meal, but with a $100 tab for 2 people I expect to be blown away.

We had people coming and going all night, and the waitress did not miss a beat!  Even with the whole check debacle...they don't do split checks (always a huge annoyance), but it was handled and ended up working out!  \n\nWe started out with a few appetizers including the \"pig in a biscuit\", pretzel with mustard and cheddar mayo, and corn hominy fritters!  All delicious and just the right amount to share!  The Saints Buck cocktail ended up being my drink of choice and was perfect and refreshing!  I also tried the Cherry Bounce which also was great, but sweet, and if you are in for the long haul...a little too much if you ask me.  Cocktail are going to run you about 10$ a piece, but it isnt just a rum and coke here...you are getting a great drink and usually an even better pour. \n\nThe space gets VERY crowded.

My husband had the Dry Aged Ribeye\u00a0- mushrooms, spring onion, oatnut crumb, and seared foie gras. I had the Day Boat Scallops\u00a0- cauliflower, lemon relish, and pea shoots. My husband's meal was well executed. Despite being very specific that I wanted my scallops over cooked - so that they were cooked all the way through, not seared, they came out simply seared. I did send them back and they came out the way I requested the second time. The atmosphere is great - lovely old saloon. A live jazz quartet was playing the night we were there.

It's a throwback to gas lit times where real men wore mustaches and sometimes the women did, too.  \n\nThe San Francisco bar scene never ceases to amaze me with their legit drinks and knowledgeable bartenders.  I'm used to swilling light beers, Long Islands, and variations of college cocktails (off brand soda + middle shelf liquor) in DC but in SF you gotta be too legit to quit.\n\nHaving said that, there are lots of starchy appetizers to soak up the strong drinks, but I found the fritters bland and the Alligator Toast less so.  The fritters tasted just frittered though, that's a plus.  And the service is very good.  Everything here is meant to ease you into a night of adult beverages and conversation.\n\nThe bar area seems to fill up much faster than the dining room, so much so that servers have to exit through the front door and re-enter through the other front door to deliver appetizers to buzzed guests.  There is a tricky ghost door on the dining room side that has an old-timey 'use other door' sign for patrons, which didn't stop wave after wave of folks from trying to open said non-functioning door. I was trying to save them some dignity by not looking but it's very distracting in an amusing way. \n\nIt's hard to give this place a full 5 stars though because our experience was detracted by a very large group of...aspiring bankers?  Drunk yuppies are universally gauche, regardless of what coast I'm on.

My litmus test is asking for an old fashioned the proper way without the modern era abomination of muddled fruit salad shite. Every bartender that served me delivered an oldie exactly how they should be.  \n\nThe inside is cozy and when present the live jazz band upstairs creates a relaxing atmosphere. On weekends it was always packed during prime hours. Most of the time I was able to snag a seat at the bar by waiting 15 minutes or so.  I can imagine after a recent appearance on Bourdain's Layover the attendance has increased so you may not be so lucky. \n\nThe drinks are fabulous.

From the time we put in our drink order it took literally about 40 minutes to get a drink, in between which we were given several apologies and told they were understaffed on a HUGE weekend for them.  The North Beach festival.  Makes no sense!  Why ask ONE person to come in when you know the streets are going to be crowded.  And even at that, the place was not even anywhere near being full of guests.\n\nAnyhow, our drinks came 40 mins later and were made wrong.

Too many old saloons make old drinks.  Not the Comstock.  The bartenders here know what they're doing and take great care in making the best cocktails.  They actually have 2 bars...the old wood bar that seats about 9-10, and the smaller bar on the other side in a space that used to be a barber shop.  They call that bar the \"monkey bar\".  Not sure why.  Both bars operate transparently, so wherever you can get a seat, go for it.  So...the drinks are first class, what about the food?  No clue.  I didn't eat here, just had drinks both before and after dinner.  However I saw a lot of the food come out and it all looked good.

Two of my favorite things to eat.  The scotch egg was pretty tasty, a little too spicy which masked some of the other great flavors but enjoyable.  The meatballs were pretty good also but maybe with a little tweaking could've been really awesome, they were slightly bland but still enjoyable.  Price point was good.  The bartender came over to drops the drinks off and was on point.  Polite, concise and friendly.  Nice job bra! I'd give 4 stars but our server was rude.  And made me feel like a piece of you know:/ I had to leave early to go to my restaurant job so I asked if I could split my cheque, for two small dishes it shouldn't have been too challenging but she informed me that they don't split cheques.  So I asked if I could just pay a set amount on our cheque, she said no, and then told me she was too busy to help me.  Telling a customer who wants to pay for their food that you're too busy to help them is probably a sign that you shouldn't be working in the industry.  Why should I be humiliated in front of my guests for wanting to pay? Sorry for wanting to use this futuristic and inconvenient technology known as a credit card.

At first, I thought he was a little over the top, but after a while, I realized he was pretty cool and highly entertaining.  He makes some fantastic drinks too.  Exactly what a bar like this needs.\n\nHad a Southside ($8) made of Gin, Lemon, Sugar, Mint, and Seltzer as well as a Martinez ($12) made of Old Tom Gin, Sweet Vermouth, maraschino liquer and bitters.  For some reason, perhaps because of the ingredients, I thought I would really like the Martinez and that the Southside would be just okay.  As it turned out, reality was the exact opposite and the Southside was the real star of the two for me.  The reason for this was that despite the list of simple ingredients, the bartender used just the right amount of each to turn it into something really special.  A touch more or a touch less of any of the ingredients and the balance would have been off.  This was one made perfectly...mine was so good!!!\n\nI really liked what they did with the decor of the former SF Brewing Company and the band playing overhead brought back memories of some clubs I've been to in LA.\n\nAs I sat at the bar enjoying cocktails and good conversation with the fun couple next to me (Hello to Manuel and Alicia!), who should walk in the door, but Francis Ford Coppola himself.

Decided to eat here with a friend since it was close by to where we had to be after dinner. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE Comstock Saloon. They make awesome drinks and the scene here is incredible. The food however, is inconsistent. Since it was my first time eating here, I decided to go with the 3 course pre-fixe menu.\n\nThe pre-fixe menu consisted of a cold pea soup, a prawn salad, and a beef dish. I did not enjoy my soup. It was mixed with sour cream, cold, and just was too thick and sour for my taste. It looked amazing, and I probably should have just looked at it instead. Might have even enjoyed it moreso. The salad though, WOW. Amazing salad. The prawns had a little crispy coating over it, which was just lightly fried. Salad was very well seasoned and didn't have that heavy feel to it. In all, just a great combination of a light prequel to my entr\u00e9e that I would order over and over. My entr\u00e9e was a beef dish topped with mushrooms and a side of sauteed vegetables. Yummy vegetables, but I was just confused by the meat. It looked like a steak, smelled like a steak, but was not a steak. It was a mushy round piece of meat that was squishy in the middle. To be fair, it wasn't half bad, but god damn the sauce was salty.   \n\nIf I were to come back, I would not order the pre-fixe menu again. I should have listened to everyone and gotten the bone marrow pot pie, but I wanted to be charismatic and go with a different choice. That choice busted me in the ass. Service here is great as always, and the waiter was very cordial. Great drinks, just don't know if I'd eat here considering my dinner was $55.", "author": "Michael W."}

I sought out a joint to live up to SF's cocktail reputation and Comstock did not disappoint.\n\nI hoofed it over from Union Sq on a warm, sunny afternoon.  I stumbled in to find 3 other patrons chatting with the bartender and sipping drinks under a large paddle wheel type fan - definite vintage feel.\n\nI was thirsty from my trek and figured I needed a long drink to start.  The Southside Punch seems to be a bit of a signature drink so I went for that.  Wow, I could have slurped down three!  I've put this drink into my own rotation at home.\n\nI had heard the bartender talking about Death in the Afternoon, so I inquired about it for round two.  I wasn't smitten by the champagne base so I asked for another suggestion.  But the bartender replied \"No, I'm making you a Death in the Afternoon.\"  Of course it was just what the doctor ordered!  It was my last cocktail before heading to dinner.  It was in the afternoon.  It was perfect!\n\nThe bartender was quite friendly and engaged me in pleasant cocktail geek conversation.  The tab was $20 for two quality cocktails and I had a good buzz going.  It was a screaming deal as far as I am concerned.\n\nIf I lived in the neighborhood, I'd spend every Friday afternoon here.

If you order 2 cocktails, you can get a dish for free (which changes from week to week and is not on the regular menu).  The first week we tried it they brought us a lovely rabbit stew.  Very, very good.  Then last week, they brought us a pot roast over polenta.\n\nBad enough that the polenta was completely tasteless (I'm not so sure they even salted it?), but the meat was like rubber.  I honestly thought they microwaved it.  We politely informed the waiter that it wasn't so great - and he was very nice... but mentioned that they don't even have a microwave.  I have NO idea how they ruined what was clearly a lovely cut of meat this way without the help of a microwave.  It was a real bummer.\n\nSo, we ordered a few appetizers to make up for the sad meat, but nothing seemed to be going well that day. The scotch egg was overdone and over-salted, the fritters were overdone... it was just not their day.\n\nI'm big on consistency.

I realize it was the cheapest bottle on the menu, but it was still $28 and there were only a few wines on the menu and this one should have been chosen with more care.\n\nPigs in a Blanket - by far the standout dish. This is worth ordering again. The pork was delicious and it came inside these lovely biscuits with homemade pickles, coleslaw and mustard on the side. The whole dish worked beautifully. I would recommend going to Comstock for this and cocktails.\n\nSalad with creamy dressing - this was literally lettuce covered with the most flavorless dressing ever. There was no flavor.\n\nRabbit fried chicken - It was a good dish. I was fairly full by the time they served it but the rabbit roulade and the fried rabbit nuggets with celery salad were quite good.\n\nSausage and white beans - I was unimpressed. I didn't think the flavors worked well together. And personally, I do not like very buttery dishes and this was served with a greasy piece of toast.\n\nOverall, I would recommend going to the lounge for drinks and the pigs in a blanket, but on the whole I thought the food was too pricey for the quality.", "author": "Jordana M."}

Came around 9, 9:30, which apparently is the exact time that everyone comes because we spent 30 minutes or so being pushed and elbowed as we tried to enjoy our drinks by the bar.  But then we scored two seats and we really got to enjoy the evening.\n\nDrinks are made with precision and care.  The cocktail menu is mainly old standards with some modern twists.  I really liked the Hop Toad and my bf asked for a bartender's whimsy of \"something like a negroni\" and really liked what he got.  Our other round of drinks (Martinez and Blood and Sand) were kind of abrasive and not as special.  \n\nAt the prodding of the bartender, we decided to get a snack and had the hangtown toast-- pickled eggs and bacon on super thin rye cracker toast.  It was pretty delicious and the perfect bar snack.  Made me curious about the rest of the menu.\n\nIts a loud, bar scene, definitely no place for a romantic dinner.  Large booths are reserved for diners.  Cool old style New Orleans theme with the fans-- and on Sat. night they even had a jazzy live band with stand-up bass and trumpet.\n\nSolid cocktails, button down shirt crowd, tasty bites.

I have been following Comstock bartender Matty from place to place since he was at Citizen Cake, maybe five year ago?  Since then my tastes have changed a number of times, but Matty continues to hit the bullseye every time I ask him to just make up something not on the menu.\n\nLast time I was in, I had a different bartender who not only remembered the costumer who sat down right next to me (who, as it turns out, had just flown in that afternoon and had made a special trip back to Comstock after having been in only once before on a previous trip) but what he liked to drink as well.  Now, this bartender ended up making me the wrong drink by mistake (I ordered something with a name very similar to one that is on the menu, and that he must make 50 times a day) which, you know, happens from time to time, right?  What matters in a situation like that is how it is handled.  In this case  I was only charged for the drink I had actually ordered, and I got to sample the other one (which I ended up liking) while I waited.  No problem there.\n\nAfter reading some of the negative reviews on here, I sincerely hope the management realizes that service like that isn't just the reason that customers like myself come back, but possibly the thing that brought us in in the first place.  I'd like to think that everyone who comes in gets treated as well, and that the staff is appreciated by management and clientele alike.\n\nAs a full time musician, I've got to say the live music has been top-notch, not your typical \"background music\" but still understated and appropriate to the size of the room.  Thank you for that!  Oh, and the food is great.  Don't expect anything healthy, and don't come with a giant appetite after working out at the gym.

Upon telling our bartender JB this his reply was, \"and we won't ask you for a password.\" \n\nAs soon as my friends Nicole L. and Chris J. walked in we were greeted by a fantastic host who said it would be a couple minutes if we wanted a booth and showed us a menu. The menu is a soft leather bound creation (and yes the bar does smell of rich mahogany). After perusing the menu I went to the bar and said to myself, this is the kind of place I can get a real old-fashioned. Brandy Old-Fashioned sweet.. with orange. The owners brew their own brandy, which makes your mouth extremely happy.  I'm going out on a limb to say it was the best old-fashioned I have ever had... and I'm from Wisconsin. (Did I mention it's also only 8 bucks?!)\n\nWe were seated quickly and our server JB did a great job. All 3 of us were huddled around one menu and literally within 30 seconds he appeared to place another in front of us. Nicole went with the appetizer, the cheese crackers (which are like crack covered cheese-its with pepper jelly mmmmm). Chris went big and got the beef and bone marrow pot pie. Talk about comfort food, the crust was buttery and flaky and I really understood why my mom always called it \"mud meat\" when she put beef in the crock pot. Per usual I ordered dessert, I went with the Bourbon pudding with shortcake. WOW... seriously WOW, that is all I can say. \n\nTo sum up the food I will again quote our fantastic server, \"I would eat pot pie and bourbon pudding for every single meal if I only needed to live to 27.\" \n\nIt was fairly busy but all the waitstaff and employees were attentive to everyone's needs. Best hospitality I have experienced in a long time. \n\nKudos to you Comstock, and I am sorry Romolo.. but you are very close to being replaced as my regular watering hole.", "author": "Hailey P."}

The space is gorgeous -you've seen the pictures,  all lovingly refurbished, from the polished wood bar, to the lazily-rotating fans, to the player piano. Yes, they kept the old (now non-functioning!!) piss trough under barstools. Hilarious and a nod to the past. There are booths in the bar area, a sitting area in the back and a separate dining room. Love the tile, the ridiculously soaring ceilings and textured wallpaper in here.\n\noh? the food? just wait. Belly up to the bar and order yourself something strong - I had the Manhattan, followed by the Sazerac - both done right. If you aren't inclined for alcohol they serve ginger beer and sarsaparilla (!!). \n\nOk, the food. Crackers with cheddar cheese spread - so tasty. Can this really be bar food? I'm never going back to hot wings. The potato fritters were lightly-fried, potato-bombs of goodness. The crock of beans can be had vegetarian and non-. The non-veg is savory and delicious. Finally, the beef shank and bone-marrow pot pie: I think this will be their signature dish. I have never tasted pot pie so complex in flavor and light. It's hard to share once you start eating it!\n\nOh and dessert - I love the desserts. They are the kind of desserts my grandma used to make - desserts forgotten and such a pleasure to rediscover. The filbert cake is a savory cake with whipped cream. It comes out warm and is perfect for anyone who doesn't like really sweet desserts. If you do have a sweet tooth, I recommend the confections plate: sassafras (which tastes like root beer) candy, peanut brittle, and chocolate fudge. \n\nAll in all, I had a terrific night. The mustachioed staff dashing around were helpful and friendly. You can also tell there is real genius in the kitchen. Comstock has transporting ambiance and food- it's everything I imagine the perfect saloon to be. I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Mission S."}

We also ordered the fried oyster cocktail, the crock of beans, and the beef shank and bone marrow pot pie.\n\nThe oyster cocktail was delicious with perfectly fried oysters, though at times they were hard to get out of the cocktail cup (they kept sinking into the cocktail sauce).  The beans came with a biscuit (tasty but a bit chewy in a non-biscuit-y way on the outside) and included salt pork.  It's a subtle dish and similar to something I make in the slow cooker at home.\n\nThe pot pie was delicious, though small.  The side of salad is a perfect accompaniment as the pot pie itself is rich.  at $18 it seems pricey for the portion but bone marrow isn't easy to come by.  \n\nI definitely recommend this place for a date (in the dining room where it's pretty quiet) and with friends in the bar room.

When you step inside you feel like you are traveling through time, or probably more accurately, walking onto a movie set.  The staff and musicians dress the part of this Barbary Coast saloon and restaurant.  Every detail of the interior design dates back to historical periods from the wallpaper to the glassware to the wood furniture and lighting.  The clientele in their modern day clothing, and with their modern day portable electronic devices, are the only things reminding you of present day.\n\nMany people go for the classic cocktails, which are created using a variety of sherries, bitters, brandies, and herbal liquors and include drinks such as Manhattans, John Collins, and Sazeracs.  The food is also based on the fare served at the turn of the century.  Pork terrines, Hangtown Toast, and Shrimp Louie among the dishes.  For our dinner three of us shared corn fritters, jalapenos, and basil yogurt dip; fried rabbit with rabbit toast and celery & fennel salad; arugula and watermelon salad with goat cheese.  The corn fitters were light, fluffy and sweet.  They paired beautifully with the spicy jalapenos and the tangy yogurt dip.  I don't know if I've ever had rabbit before, the fried rabbit was served as three little nuggets of juicy, tender rabbit meat with a nice crunchy coating.  A slice of toast topped with shredded rabbit was served alongside.  The shredded rabbit was moist and rich.  The celery and fennel salad offered a nice complement to the rich flavors of the rabbit.  Lastly, the peppery spice of arugula was paired with the sweet watermelon and tangy, sweet goat cheese to provide a nice bit of green to the meal.", "author": "Chad G."}

What I CAN'T get is a bone marrow pot pie. So.\n\nAt 6PM on a Friday night, we were seated by a window, through which we saw the antics of more than a couple of unsavory characters. My friend ordered a Sazerac (described as \"boozy\") and I ordered a Pisco Punch (which I will call \"delicious\"). Along with our drinks, we placed an order for the crackers with pepper jelly -- which I could eat every day, for breakfast even -- which arrived promptly. It took the drinks much longer than the 5-10 minutes others have quoted, and then it took 20 minutes of furtive glances at our server to get the chance to order food.\n\nWe ordered the crock of beans with biscuit, the fowl, and the pot pie. I was under the impression that the portions were small, but we WAY over-ordered. Everything was fairly yummy, but we barely touched the beans. We just didn't need them! The pot pie was ridiculously rich and creamy, and I found myself doling out bigger and bigger bites to my companion. There was no way I could finish it myself.\n\nEven though I was stuffed, I would have considered the platter of confections, which reminded me of the treats my grandmothers made when I was a kid. However, the service was just too slow.

This bar is freakin awesome! a little small, not much sitting room, but the ambiance makes up for it. The drinks are really exotic and one of a kind. The place is attached to a restaurant, but i didn't wander into that part. There was a live band that played some cool folk music on the level above. Prices for drinks were probably typical of most expensive bars in San Fran.

But he made it all good by simply apologizing, offering good advice on the menu, and getting my order to me in good order.  Simple hospitality.\n\nChicken soup told the tale of the restaurant.  A good, tasty chicken stock that contained abundant and fresh vegetables that retained real taste.  And there was chicken in the broth as well.  Very nice.\n\nCrab salad was a tulip shaped glass that contained a nice helping of fresh and tasty crab over cocktail sauce.  Very nice again.\n\nFinally, the beef and bone marrow pot pie.  The flakey crust was buttery beyond belief and somewhat overpowered the beef and marrow.  But when sampled on their own the beef and marrow obviously had been freshly prepared and were of good taste.  \n\nThis place is a really nice alternative to all of the faux Italian in North Beach.

The menu sounded creative & interesting but the pickled egg was hardly pickled and the beef short rib & bone marrow pot pie was dry (it had a great, flaky pie crust but the filling was rather plain -- not indulgent -- as one would think bone marrow would be). My boyfriend thinks the Chicken Fried Rabbit with rabbit toast appetizer was excellent -- rabbit was tender & moist, yet crispy on the outside. The chile vinegar was a perfect compliment, he thought. I thought the rabbit was great for what it was but realized rabbit just isn't my favorite thing.\n\nDECOR/ATMOSPHERE: Great that they had a live band playing -- good rag time music -- but it was a bummer that the main seating was in another, side room. The dining room was cold and the wait staff apparently had to go in and out to bring in deliveries or something, which caused an intermittent draft.  We both loved the old west saloon style -- lots of wood, great wallpaper, nice lighting. Re loudness, something about the acoustics, made it an overly noisy place, esp. near the bar area. While it was much quieter in the side dining room -- and that's where we ate -- it was disappointing not to be able to hear one another and thus spend more time post-dinner at the bar. \n\nSTAFF: Seemed like an overall friendly place.\n\nCOCKTAILS: We tried both the Saint's Buck (Brandy, elderflower, lemon, Angostura, ginger beer) and the South Side Cocktail (Gin, lemon, sugar, mint, seltzer). Our fave was the South Side -- crisp and refreshing. Nice balance of acidity. Saint's Buck was good too. Ginger gives it a nice kick.\n\nIN SUM: Would I go again? It was a decent enough place that if my friends wanted to meet there for dinner or Happy Hour, I'd go again, but, particularly given the prices here, I'd never pick it as my first  choice. \n\n(Note that if this place had lower prices, I'd likely give it a four.

The list is short, but everything we had was fantastic!  Plus, there's always the option of The Bartender's Whimsy, where you put yourself at the tasty tasty mercy of the house mixologist (with maybe a suggestion or two).  We ordered both a bourbon whimsy & mezcal whimsy, and neither disappointed.\n\nBut I hadn't realized the food would be so amazing!  We started with the chicken fried rabbit and celery salad.  The rabbit meat was tender & succulent, and battered in a light, fluffy, perfectly seasoned flour.  The toast was buttery and delicious and topped with decadent rabbit confit.  The celery salad (sliced celery in a tasty dressing) went very nicely with it.\n\nBeef shank & bone marrow pie was HEAVENLY.  Stupid rich, and definitely in the heart-attack-on-a-plate category, but tender, creamy, perfectly cooked, and served in a flaky pastry pie.  (Served with nicely dressed greens.)  Griddled trout with alligator pear relish & smoky corn was slightly healthier, but just as delicious - flaky and tender, & perfectly complimented by the sweet, savory, & smoky relish.\n\nFor dessert, we had the maple bourbon pudding with shortbread.  This was definitely tasty and maple/bourbon flavored, but it was a little too sweet & ordinary for my taste (I prefer slightly more adventurous dessert with more variety to them).  Still, some people with LOVE it.\n\nIn addition to tasty noms & elixirs, the place has a neat steampunk kind of atmosphere (aspects of it remind me of Alembic, like the paddle fan).  The servers were dressed appropriately (not to mention being extraordinarily attentive), and there's even a pianist playing all kinds of music on an old upright in a nook above the dining area, which adds an old-timey vibe.\n\nWe were surprised at how un-crowded the place was; although we'd gotten reports that it was usually horribly busy, we were seated right away (though it did fill up later).\n\nWill definitely be back!", "author": "Angela B."}

We sat at a table in the bar area because bar stools were all taken, some with people in them other stools with people's coats, messenger bags etc. :( it took the waitress 20 minutes to even come and take our order. My husband ordered a scotch and I ordered a Moscow mule.  I asked if they made the cocktail with ginger beer not ginger ale, because it makes a big difference in taste, the waitress said oh yes of course!  Well, another 20 minutes and still no drinks and nobody even checks on us we have to stop someone as they wisk past our table.  When we finally got someone to stop by our table the waitress said yeah, I know we're busy.  Then she asked what we ordered and I told her she had the audacity to say, that the Moscow mule took special crushed ice and that is why it as taking so long. REALLY??????!

But when Comstock moved into this location, I instantly forgot my woes. \n\nIf this place weren't so devoted to creating expert drinks and crafting a complete experience from them, then its Old West, late 19th century saloon motif would seem comically ironic. But when I went here, I realized that irony was in no way the aim -- the folks at Comstock really are just dedicated to the business and culture of cocktails, and their aim is to please. \n\nSo yes, there are bartenders in vests and tiny ties, and yes you'll feel like you stepped back in time a bit when you walk through the doors. But that's only to enhance your experience there. \n\nWhat to drink? I am a huge fan of the Saint's Buck (brandy, elderflower, lemon, sugar, bitters, seltzer) because I love drinks with a slightly herbal, earthy taste. I also recommend choosing the Barkeep's Whimsy, where you tell them what kind of liquor you enjoy and they'll surprise you by whipping up something custom.

They were professional yet humorous and very helpful/attentive/positive the whole time.  My only knock would be that the pork and beans with biscuits could use some work. The pork is sometimes in HUGE chunks that need to be broken down to smaller bits to be comfortably eaten. It makes for awkward in-bowl cutting. The biscuits were great but there weren't enough of them in proportion to the pork and beans, and finally the pork and beans was only marginally better from what any average person could make at home. I was expecting maybe a little sweetness or spiciness but it just was what it was. Pork. Beans.\n\nDrinks were solid, and the picnic sampler app was enjoyable - any way you could get us those cherries without pits? I tried to gently chew them to get the pit out, but for one of them I completely bit the seed and it shattered in my mouth...my fault I know but I wish it could've just been some sort of cherry compote/jam/spread/pieces instead to avoid all the effort.\n\nThis also marks the first time I've ever raved about olives as a side dish. The olives are influenced by the orange zest they sit with. They are exemplary. Best olives I've ever had.\n\nOn the food alone I'd give them 4 stars, but the service easily bumps it up to 5.

While the bus boy frantically looked to clean up the mess he made, he did a poor job of wiping the floor. Thankfully we were in an area that would dry quickly because of the fire and would not be subject to much foot traffic.\n\nShortly thereafter, the waitress stopped by and took our drink order.

Maybe that was my mistake; I should have just picked a tried and true item off the menu.  But I was feeling adventurous and figured how could I go wrong?  Well, I did, or rather, the barkeep did.  I was served an extremely sour lemon, apricot liquer update on the lemondrop.  Mind you, I cut my cocktail teeth on lemondrops.  I would have been a little disappointed in the barkeep's creativity had I been served a lemondrop, but I would have enjoyed drinking it.  Instead, the balance on my mystery drink was all off - so tart, my tongue burned slightly for the rest of the evening.  Any apricot flavor was slight and jarring when I could taste it.  Of course I did not send it back b/c that's like admitting defeat, that you're not adventurous enough for barkeep's choice.  But here I am complaining anyway!  Point being, just don't get the surprise drink, and if you do, don't be too shy to send it back.  My boyfriend had two bourbon based drinks.  One was good, but too icy, and I could barely taste the bourbon in the second one - too much ice and seltzer.  All in all, the balance was off on all three drinks.  I'm willing to think it was an aberration, but still will think twice before coming back.\n\nFor food, we enjoyed the hangtown toast, shrimp sandwich, and rabbit three ways.  All three dishes were excellent.  The shrimp in the sandwich was super sweet and tender.  Ham accompanies the shrimp, and the pairing is so delicious.  The rabbit three ways came with fried rabbit, rabbit terrine, and some other way that I forget.  The fried rabbit itself was possibly the best fried anything I've ever had.  The meat was steaming and tender beneath a tasty, crispy batter.  We also loved the sliced pickled eggs on the hangtown toast.  Yum!", "author": "Pearl L."}

We said fine and waited until 4:10.  When we asked if they were then open the man in the bar yelled to us they would open when they were ready.

I'm not normally a bourbon drinker so I was looking forward to trying something different. And I'd never had any type of pickeled eggs so that was a new experience as well. Overall the combo was pretty good. the sourness of the eggs went well with the warm sweetness of the manhattan. We also had a side of some type of rabbit which wasn't bad, but i probably wouldn't order it again. And split a buttermilk dressing salad with some tasty impression of croutons mixed in.

We made reservations for a large party to celebrate a special occasion. I purposely checked their menu and website to see if they had any restriction or cutting fee and was happy to see that nothing on their menu or site stating any fee would be charged. As soon as we stepped through the front door, the manager, a young Asian female approached us and tried to force us into a \"deal\" to be able to bring in our cupcakes! I explained to her that I didn't see anything on their website or menu that indicated there would be a fee. She told us that dependent on how much we spend, she will determine at the end of the night if a fee would be applied. I was completely shocked at her clear lack of professionalism and customer service. I approached her at the end of the night since we had drank and ate plenty to cover any kind of extra fee, she again had the audacity to say she still needed to think about it, proceeded to talk to our waiter and asked him to come around the table again and try to con more drinks and food out of our 12 people table.

Absinthe could not accommodate our group as our numbers would be more than 50. So in taking a chance I went to the Saloon to feel them up. \n\nI went with a friend to have a few of their offerings and discuss if the location would suffice for our use. I love what they did with the building. The ambiance is light and it appears they have removed the kitsch the \"San Francisco brewing Company' had when it was here; note that while it is put up in saloon style it has an elegance of the bygone era they are trying to evoke. \n\nI suggest if you go here plan to spend time in the bar trying the varied drinks you'd not get elsewhere in this expert fashion. Take time to peruse the combination of foods you can savor with your drink and the company you're keeping. I really recommend bringing friends or business associates and taking your time to enjoy the all of it will be worth it. \n\n\nWe started with just the corn fritters, Wow, they are delicious, they are fresh, hot, and tres yummy. Fresh pickled thin sliced jalape\u00f1os accompanied the plate. The flavor was balanced the fritter was moist to where it was almost creamy but it was light in texture, the peppers were perfection of a light pickling and sweet heat. These are a must and I wonder what else will be after a few more perusals of their fare. I followed that with the egg noodles in cream of mushroom sauce. The mushrooms were in crimini and chanterelles in a sherry cream sauce. I advise, do not share, get your own plate, be greedy. I make egg noodles, so does mom, grand mom, etc. they'd be proud to eat this stuff, and the sauce is balanced light in the weight of flavors yet delicious. I use port and morels similarly. I liked this very much. I am a wine snob so though I found they serve For De Cana rum... a favorite of mine, I accompanied this with (the company of a friend and) a delicious French pinot noir. \n\nI planned to give these guys a run for their money, to get my business, and I worked in the industry, set up wine tours, worked bar, planning event, and I feel they are worth a daily visit for good times and should be looked forward to visiting for a special occasion. I admit there are more quiet intimate spots to go to in this great city, yet this should be on your list for fun and good food. \n\nNote I came in near the end of happy hour and yes people were there in droves and happy. It seemed to be a real good time. The staff though swamped with people was accommodating and ready to serve. I will have to go back to try a few drinks now I know I will sit for a fuller spectrum of a meal and savor the company, food and time. \n\nI loved the staff, they are very energetic, and attentive, I like that the bar staff is reserved yet if you need to order or ask they are all business. in a busy environment this makes efficiency happen. I wish i could recall who waited our table as she was fun, put up with our flavor of humor, helped us out with everything, and got applause from us. Water glasses and other needs were attended to by every staff person who was handy and without our asking, they asked, or offered. Having been on the serving end of the industry, not all hospitality staff is conscientious, but here they seem to be. \n\nIf you by chance happen to come in, look for me, I'm the happy chunky girl who laughs a lot and is soooo cheerful", "author": "Jennifer H."}

The potato chips were also good, but need something for dipping.  The corn fritters were not my favorite, but that's ok, there are plenty of other things on the menu.

We wound up spending THREE HOURS there and hardly noticed--the service was so considerate, the drinks were nice and strong, and the food was delicious!  Even on a slow Monday night, there was a live piano singer and I am a sucker for any live music--especially a jazzy piano and a female singer.\n\nThe venue itself is pretty small, so I can imagine that it can get crowded pretty quickly on more popular nights.  I will be interested to seeing what it would be like to come back again closer to the weekend.\n\nMy sister and I had the South Side Cocktail (yummily minty, reminds you of a mojito without lime), the Country Jam (really really really strong...at least for me!), and the Blood and Sand (I remember it being good, but I don't remember any details).\n\nTo eat, we had the chicken fried rabbit, pig in a biscuit, and the hamburg steak.  The chicken fried rabbit and rabbit toast was SO TASTY--I don't know what it was about the seasoning, or maybe it's just the fact that I love fried food--but eating that alone made me feel like the evening was a success!  The pig in a biscuit was also really good--they were three slider-like biscuits with \"crispy pork\" (kind of like pulled pork without the sauce mashed into a patty), coleslaw and pickles on the side.  Lastly, the hamburg steak was really juicy and I am still regretting that I could not finish my half of the steak after eating all the other food.\n\nHere's a shout out to the awesome service which secures the fifth star of my review--I only wish that I could remember your name!  (I will blame the Country Jam for that).  The best word that applies to our server was considerate.  He seemed to know that we were out for a relaxing evening, giving us plenty of time to enjoy our drinks before ordering food, but making sure we didn't feel neglected or rushed.  Our food was also timed well so that we could have the right amount of time to enjoy our appetizers before entrees (I know--not a novel concept, but appreciate nonetheless).\n\nThanks Comstock Saloon!  We'll be back =)", "author": "Eileen H."}

The chicken fried rabbit was probably the tastiest appetizer (and we tried almost all of them between our group). The main dishes were solid, if not the kinds of things that would blow your mind (think fancy pub fare). \nWe had a large group and that caused some service struggles (I am guessing their kitchen is challenged when a big group comes in) and our two tables ended up being served at least 15 minutes apart, so some of our group ended up leaving while many of us were still eating our entrees. Very nice servers, just seemed a little strained with the big group.\nAll in all I'd say I would absolutely go back any day of the week for cocktails, but would likely find someplace else to eat unless I was feeling too lazy to trek around.", "author": "Elizabeth E."}

If I could I'd give them 3 1/2 stars for the drinks, there was some consistency that was lacking... for instance: the barman's whimsy found me with a remember the maine, lovely, made with carpano instead of regular vermouth, but the gin mule my girlfriend ordered was made with ginger beer instead of ginger syrup, or it could've been one of those nights when the ginger syrup lacked any punch, but that characteristic bite of eastern bliss was sadly missing from the mule. When we got around to Satan's Whiskers it was a little heavy on the OJ and my digestif, a sazerac, was heavy on the sugar and lacked that blend of bitters and alcohol to sugar that makes it a very easy drinking cocktail. I don't think the cocktails are bad by any stretch of the imagination, the menu's Saints Buck is fabulous as is the Martinez, there was just a lack of consistency. \n\nNow, as for the food, here's where they earn a solid four stars. Good nibbles on the appetizers, a great pot pie of beef shank and marrow, the rabbit is great, as are the pickled eggs... oh yeah, bacon, pickled eggs, rye how can you go wrong?! \n\nAs for the music, a join that has live music every night, good solid mixology and tasty nibbles, well if I could give them a 4 1/2 I probably would as they've only been around for 3 months and I think like a wine a good cocktail joint needs aging and who knows they may get the ghosts out of the machine over time.

We had crab cakes with fennel, pickled eggs on bacon, pork sliders on a biscuit with coleslaw, which were all very good. The build it yourself sliders were definitely a favourite. Also, they have a happy hour special where you can get a beer and a shot for $6. The three combos are an Anchor Steam and whisky, a Tecate and tequila or a Pilsner and Dutch gin. Each combo came with its own presentation - Tecate in a can with a lime, whisky shot in a mini boot, gin in a blue euro glass thing... Definitely just made it more fun. We also had some really good mixed drinks. \n\nOverall, just really good attention to detail and great service.", "author": "Jason M."}

I was served by the owner and asked him about Bourdain n' stuff blah blah blah. ANYWAYS, I can see why he came here in the first place. It's a very trendy/hipster/divey bar all in one. They offer a ton of different drinks which you can find in a readily available menu. I've heard that their cocktails were excellent so I tried the Blood & Sand which was quite good. Despite the drinks, I absolutely fell in love with the ambiance. It's very laid back and the crowd is awesome too with a mix of locals, tourists, hipsters, businessmen, and other out of the ordinary people. But man I can not tell you how much I love this place. This has become my favorite bar of all time, in the whole world.

The atmosphere at Comstock is very laid back, with gigantic fan leaves hovering over head and a good old western movie type vibe.  I came here last night for a late night snack which evolved more into a meal.  I recommend the two toasts that I tried: mashed black eye pea toast with spicy cabbage and the hangtown toast which consists of pickled eggs, oyster dressing and bacon.  Now you might be wondering what the heck is this and I admit, that I was skeptical of the ingredients at first, combining a bunch of different things that I do not eat on a day to day basis.  Putting all doubt aside, I can tell you that they taste phenomenal are are priced super reasonably at  roughly $5 a plate.  I also had the pozole like soup - braised pork, hominy and chile stew with watermelon radishes and lime.  That was a meal in itself and cost just $8.  Staff was super friendly and very attentive, cocktails were strong and food was amazing.  Overall, I am a big fan - solid food for a solid price with a one of a kind atmosphere.", "author": "Jason M."}

Food was amazing: we had pig in a blanket, fisherman's breakfast (trout, hash browns, chard, easy egg), salad w fried grits and two desserts, a caramel cake pudding thing and a chocolate pecan tart.  Everything was transcendent.  Definitely up there with the top bar food/ restos in the city.  We sat in the dining room - thank god, because the bar room was sardine-style packed because it was Friday night.  Ambiance was good and liked the live band.\n\nWhy it didn't get five stars: we had a reservation for 4 people and we ended up having 6 people unexpectedly.  When we told the restaurant staff, the host was incredibly rude and said something like \"that's what reservations are for in case you didn't know.\"  UNACCEPTABLE.  I say this having been a hostess for over 6 years.  He proceeded to act totally put out even though we were profusely apologizing and offering to go to another restaurant.  It was so bad that I couldn't enjoy the meal for the first 30 minutes and ended up going to speak with him and apologize again for the unexpected extra two guests.  If you work in a restaurant, guess what, SHIT HAPPENS and under no circumstances is that reaction acceptable.  Either apologize and say that unfortunately, you can't accommodate groups of 6 or make it happen and don't make your customers feel like shit.  Fire this host.  Server was not overly friendly either but that was fine.\n\nAside from that tense incident, a wonderful experience!", "author": "E C."}

We were having drinks on a Saturday night and everything was good until we got the check. My boyfriend simply asked the waiter why there was an 18% gratuity added to the bill when it was a bill for 3 people - as this is usually reserved for bigger parties. The waiter started getting rude with us because we questioned this and soon there was full on yelling and F-bombs directed at us. My boyfriend managed to remain calm throughout this experience, while still standing his ground, especially after the waiter went nuts. It wasn't even about the money for the 18% it was simply the principle of sneakily adding it on there when we weren't even a large party.  Beyond the fact that this guy as beyond rude to us, I cannot believe he started yelling at us and literally peppering in very loud F bombs throughout the conversation. I'm sure all of the people in the back room were put off by this as well since he was not even trying to be discreet.  I will never go back to this place", "author": "Lindsay A."}

Entrees were fine, but only that (pot pie and an uninspired pile of greens) and a unique cornbread/mushroom thing.  The bourbon pudding dessert was extra fine.  But service, well, sucked.  I've not felt that ignored in awhile.  We sat in a mostly empty dining room (an early dinner; the bar was full); there was lots of staff focused on moving chairs and tables and setting and re-setting silverware and glassware at other, empty, tables.  But it took a long time for someone to ask if we wanted a drink.  I had to ask for a second, but not from the waitress, who had disappeared.  And I had to fill my own water glass.

The other evening, after watching \"Harry Brown\" at the Embarcadero Cinema, I really needed a drink (if you saw the movie you know what I mean) and decided to walk up to the Comstock.\nThey've done a great job of capturing the old turn-of-the-(last) century ambiance of the building, complete with the belt-driven ceiling fans, without making it the least bit kitschy or touristy.  The bartenders definitely know their craft, and it was most enjoyable to listen to their comments to each other about various recipes for unusual cocktail order, but nothing seem to have stumped them.  I had a \"South Side\" cocktail, a gin drink with which I could easily fall in love.\nI didn't eat, so I have no comments on the food or dining service, but I'll certainly be back to investigate that as well.", "author": "Tom R."}
