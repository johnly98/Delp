It came with a choice of a side: broccoli, rice, or fries. Also comes with a soup (they had clam chowder or salmon bisque) or salad. I got the clam chowder and it was really nice with the free fresh sourdough bread and large amount (!) of butter at the table. The clam chowder was more on the light side (not that white creamy Boudin-style) but it was still very tasty and felt homemade.

As far as I can tell, nothing has changed in those 40+ years - the menu is still basic, perfectly prepared fresh seafood with a basic side (boiled potatoes, fried potatoes or rice) and the same option of appetizer - potato based clam chowder that is really quite splendid, or a side-salad. (Go for the chowder!!!) The bread is fresh daily and brings me to my childhood - it's traditional sour dough San Francisco style (like Boudin always made) with a dense, moist center and a super chewy crust. Our recent visit, two at our table had the fresh crab - cooked and then served cut into pieces, shell in tact, in a dish full of butter and garlic. One person had fried oysters and raved about them! I had grilled prawns - cooked to just done, staying tender and moist and juicy. \n\nWe arrived at 4:30 (they open the doors at 5:00) and were not the first in line but we did make first seating. The wait as we left was up to 1 1/2 hours - but they do provide free wine while you wait which is why, I'm pretty sure, folks are willing to wait this long!\n\nInteresting crowd - mostly older folks who all seem to have some propitiatory feeling about the place and always talk to the \"newbies\" with an air of knowing. (My in-laws were always excited to share the history and let others know how it is done!)

The food did not blow me away, but it wasn't bad. The shrimp cocktail was just exactly what you would suspect. The Tuna (that I got) was just not quite as flavorful as I wanted, but at least it wasn't overcooked.  The wasabi butter that came on the side was REALLY strong, so I didn't actually use much of it.  The Salmon that my husband got, I felt was better.  The clam chowder had a really good clam flavor - it was not on the creamy side (which happens to be my preference) but I still thought it was well done.  \n\nReally what struck me about this place is that it was NOT filled with hipsters.

I had the Filet of Sole Newburg which was a creamy dish that went well with the side of rice (you get choice of rice or potatoes...possibly something else but I can't remember right now). Be careful when you eat this, because I did find some bones in there that I almost swallowed! For the soup, I went with the chowder which was fine- nothing special, but good 'cause it was nice and hot.\n\nI doubt I'll be back but it's a cute little spot that kind of brings you back 'cause it's been around so long. It's on the expensive side for just okay food.", "author": "Kathy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-02", "description": "My review is based solely on the food.  The free wine while you wait is a nice touch, not the best wine, but it is free so you can't be too picky about it.  I ordered the filet of sole with the clam chowder, one of my friends had the spicy snapper with the chowder, while another friend ordered the same as I but with the bisque instead.  \n\nThe clam chowder is not cream based, interesting flavor but I prefer the traditional chowder.  The sourdough is nice but the butter is not warmed for easy spreading, straight out the refrigerator.  The sole newburg sauce was good but if it wasn't for the sauce I would have been disappointed with the dish.  My friend said her snapper just tasted like fish with seasoning on top, nothing stood out to her about it.  She wanted to order the potatoes with it but our waitress said they weren't seasoned.  \n\nI felt bad for the woman at the table next to us as she was with a group and said she was vegetarian, not pescatarian.  She asked for the vegetarian options and it was broccoli. When it came it was a heaping mound of steamed broccoli and nothing else.  Not recommended for true vegetarians.  \n\nMy main gripe I have with this place is it is a limited menu.  If it's a limited menu the food should be outstanding, it should be the best of the best.  I wouldn't go back because I could go to the pier and get something better for equal or less.", "author": "Shonda B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-29", "description": "A close friend who travels on board cruise ships as the boat doc once recommended this low key, low profile restaurant. He was very specific. \"I have traveled around the world many times and I'll dare say their Petrale Sole is one of the best I had anywhere.\" I have to try PC, as I can't ignore my doc's orders! The restaurant was not fancy schmancy. In fact, it was basically no frills and down-to-earth.... like starting dinner off with a boring loaf of sourdough with plain ol' butter. The quaint exterior of the building gave PC a charming and old-fashioned appearance, shrouded occasionally by the enveloping fog. The interior is congested with many tables and antique booths tightly jammed in every nook and cranny. It did exude a cozy and welcoming aura once you step inside not to mention the cool glass of complimentary white wine in your hands for having to wait for a table.\n\nI was amazed as to how simple the menu was. There were only three basic styles of cooking.... Baked or grilled or pan-fried.  Add in a couple of soups and salads and there you have it, the whole menu of PC in a nutshell.\n\nWe wanted to start off by sharing an order of saut\u00e9ed and pan-fried calamari steak. Since it appeared in the menu only as a dinner entr\u00e9e ($18.75), my server cleverly suggested ordering the entr\u00e9e without the sides and she knocked $6.00 off from the entr\u00e9e price. Sounded like a deal! Calamari is relatively cheap, in abundant supply and ecologically sustainable. PC's calamari was first pounded, egg washed and batter dipped and lightly fried to give the calamari a golden brown crust. In spite of its tough or rubbery reputation, the texture of PC's calamari was so super tender that a fork was all you needed. Coupled with the lip-smacking egg batter, the tender steak earned a well deserved 5 stars. I was told the abalone was prepared much the same way but at $45 a pop, I'd rather stick with calamari and try my luck at diving for abalone off the Mendocino coast!\n\nPetrale sole ($24.95), a Pacific Coast fish, is prized for its delicate, mild and sweet flavors. The fillets were quickly saut\u00e9ed and pan-fried with a sauce of white wine, shallots, butter and herbs. PC then plated the fillets with saut\u00e9ed button mushrooms, a sprinkling of capers and a gentle squeeze of lemon. The sauce wasn't overwhelming so I can still taste the natural flavor of the fish. Even though the prep sounded so simple, I can't somehow make it to taste this good at home! The carb of choice was rice pilaf that tasted exquisite like fried rice and good to soak up the excess sauce.  I guess my doc was right about the sole, though I think I had better elsewhere. (4 stars). Besides, the calamari had the edge! \n\nThe Spicy Red Snapper ($20.68) didn't have the \"wow\" flavor I'd hoped for but my wife said it was still a keeper in the menu.  I personally think that the fish was a tad over grilled and the meat a little drier than I would like. It was labeled as spicy but not in any true sense of the word. The outer crust of the snapper had a robust, tangy char of some kind of mixed Cajun spices and herbs, cayenne pepper perhaps being the most discernable. (3.5 stars). The red snapper's meat was a little firmer and did not have the melt-in-your-mouth quality like the sole.\n\nAll in all, a great seafood place.... the price is right; the food is unpretentious and seafood perfectly executed. I just love old established restaurants like this one.  Parking can be a challenge in this neighborhood.  No reservations are taken and the system is kinda funky and disorganized. A lady comes around to take your name without writing it down and then pours you a glass of white wine!", "author": "Geoff G."}

I ordered the crab cake appetizer, large patties of crab, add some lemon and tartar sauce and it's perfection. The only other really noteworthy dish was the calamari steak, nothing I've ever seen before, a giant thin steak of pan fried calamari. Extremely tender and the right amount of chewyness.

There was no shortage of meat and they didn't just serve the small crumbly pieces, there were big chunks of claw meat. YUM!!!\n\nEach dinner we've ordered we've loved!\n\nEntrees come with soup or salad. Their clam chowder was full of clam and instead of being a creamy broth they seem to have pur\u00e9ed potato to thicken it up. I know clam chowder is subjective, so I will just note that this particular one is a favorite of mine!\n\nTheir Cesar salad is done just right. Nothing fancy, just tasty!\n\nThey take great care to make sure their customers know they appreciate their business and apologize if they've had to wait.

Cassava does scallops way better and way less expensive.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the parmesan halibut, which tasted like chicken was encrusted with what tasted like Kraft parmesan.

I'm willing to bet people are thrilled when they arrive to find a lengthy wait, because it means plenty of wine to kill the time. I'm not much of a wino (my extensive knowledge consists of knowing that one is red and one is white), but their red wine was fine by me, maybe a little too sweet, though. We had time for two glasses before our table came up. \n\nThey have a menu (duh), but the thing to do here seems to be ordering off the chalkboard full of daily specials. I could have eaten everything on there, but for some reason the king salmon with crab newburg spoke to me. It said \"order me, and eat my deliciousness\". Done. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine for the table. Why? I don't know. Is the wine still free once you've been seated? They gave us some bread, which I normally avoid but I was starving at this point. Appetizers seemed like the thing to get, so we ordered up a shrimp cocktail, which was a little underwhelming. The shrimp were so tiny; like microorganisms. \n\nMy entree arrived and I dug in. Gotta say, I don't remember ordering a crab newburg dish before, and I probably won't again. The salmon and crab were stacked inside a casserole dish, which was smothered in newburg sauce (whatever the hell that is) and baked. It's a heavy, rich meal that completely masks the flavor of the seafood. I mostly enjoyed it, but knowing what I know now I can't say I'd order it again.", "author": "Anthony A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-27", "description": "A solid 4.8 star dining experience that rounds to a 5! I loves me some Pacific Cafe! This is my family's go-to spot for birthdays or any special occasion when we want to take a quick day trip to the city and enjoy some bomb seafood in a cozy, homey restaurant.\n\nThey recently added a new special (salmon & prawns) that I've gotten the last few times I've gone and that I will continue to get. I've always gotten the prawns fried (which their amazing cocktail compliments perfectly!), but my dad recently got his grilled and they came in this buttery garlic sauce of pure goodness that gave me a serious conundrum on how I should order them on my next visit. (Talk about first world problems!) Until, that is, my brother suggested that we each order the prawns differently so we can share them and have both. (I knew he would come in handy one of these days.)\n\nThe last couple of times I've been, the salmon has been very tender. There was one time that it was a little dry, but it's usually cooked right. A small knock is that it seems a bit bland to me. It does come with an herb butter, although I'm not really one for putting butter on fish. I prefer spices to give flavor. And I'll admit that my husband cooks just about the tastiest, moistest salmon ever, so the bar is set ridiculously high. \n\nThe only other tiny knock I have would be the clam chowder. Please keep in mind that along with being a salmon snob, I'm also a bit of a chowder snob. (I blame it on all the times I've been to Oregon and gone to Mo's, which is the epitome of what the inventor of clam chowder envisioned it should taste like.) I prefer my chowders to be on the creamier side, and Pacific Cafe's is more broth-like. That's not to say that it isn't flavorful (because it is), it simply comes down to personal preference (aka my chowder snobbery).\n\nNow back to the highlights, which include potato goodness that comes in fry form! In the name of Merlin's beard, get the fries! They're a must-have! We asked the waiter about them (the wait staff is incredibly friendly, btw), and he said that they're parboiled and then fried. They have a light, crisp texture with the perfect crunch. I was shocked to hear that they're fried because they're not greasy at all.\n\nIf you've never been, you've gotta add it to your list of must-try seafood restaurants in the city!", "author": "Megan M."}

Parking was pain, especially since when we arrived, there was a guy standing in a prime street spot, holding a glass of wine, loudly protesting that his wife was arriving imminently to park in that spot.  Ok, then.  Not the restaurant's fault, but not a promising start.\n\nThere was a wait, of course, so we settled down in front with a complimentary glass of wine.  Not the worst idea in the world!  We were seated fairly promptly, but then apparently forgotten about, since it took forever for a waiter to show up.  Despite the fact that most of the menu was on the handwritten specials board, he seemed surprised that we had questions, and overall was not very attentive throughout the meal.\n\nThe food was a mixed bag.  Soup (Pacific chowder and something else I've forgotten) was fine, but nothing special.  The seafood mains were excellent -- I had shrimp and scallops and the boyfriend had flounder, and it was all really good.  Sides, however, seemed kind of dated -- red potatoes were boiled and plopped on the plate, no butter, not smashed, nothing.  They should have just let the seafood speak for itself and not bothered with a side.\n\nOverall, I think this place is living in the past.

We shared crab cakes as our appetizer.  They were tasty especially with the cup of tartar sauce.  For my entree, I had the scallops scampi.  Kudos because the scallops were not overcooked, which happens too often; and the garlic chunks were too big, even for a garlic lover like me.\n\nTo be fair, Pacific Cafe's seafood might be more than decent, but my perception may have been tainted by the fact that I had recently dined at Tadich Grill, which undoubtedly is an older and better seafood restaurant.", "author": "Christina L."}

Super friendly guy (forgot his name).\n\nWe had abalone, among other things. Now, abalone is not something you order every day. In fact, this is the first time in my life I'd ever had it in a restaurant - I usually go with family to get them ourselves and then cook them at home. \n\nPacific Cafe knew exactly what to do with the abalone. VERY delicate handling (well, after tenderizing the crap out of them, of course) with very light seasoning. Can't get much better. \n\nThe service was great.

This is a small restaurant and to appease those waiting in line they provide you with a complimentary glass of wine - an uncommon gesture, but most appreciated. We started with sourdough bread and butter which we devoured.  After a long day visiting the city there was no guilt!  The side salads were average and I was a little disappointed in the clam chowder.  It was a bit bland and tasted like canned soup.  Three of us ordered the parmesan crusted halibut.  It was a bit overcooked/dry, but generously portioned. I'm not typically a fan of the seafood and cheese combination, but the parmesan complimented the meaty halibut.  Another one of our guests ordered the salmon and shrimp.  They were both juicy and perfectly cooked.  Dessert of cheesecake and praline ice cream topped the meal off perfectly.  The service was attentive and personable, especially for one in our party that had extreme allergies.  A great place to end our visit to SF!", "author": "Janet F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-24", "description": "This is one of those needle in a haystack restaurants that you wouldn't know about it unless someone mentions it. I love supporting long established restaurants such as this one. My gf took me here for a date and it was a great restaurant. \n\nI read some reviews may say that the service is slow or that the dishes need more seasonings or what not. I say its great because its slow because the restaurant is small and many people are waiting, is that slow or is that because the restaurant is great. I believe its the latter. Besides you get free wine while you wait for your table, so that's another bonus. More seasonings, ladies and gentlemen its a seafood restaurant. The seasons were just right with a side of lemon left on your table. You can taste the fresh fish which I love. Any more seasoning it might as well be battered. haha\n\nI digress. Let move on to the food:\n\nAppetizer:\n\nCrab cakes - To die for. So good. I've never had crab cakes like these before and I've tasted plenty in the east coast where you see them in every restaurant. \n\nWith each meal you get soup or salad: We opted for the soup.\n\nCrab bisque - To be honest I've never had a bisque so I had nothing to compare it with. Its definitely filling because of the heavy cream but its a bit too heavy for my liking. A cup is definitely a way to go if you want to try it with someone.\n\nClam chowder - I'm glad they call it Pacific Clam Chowder instead of Manhattan or Boston. It was so fresh and light. I loved it. Not so heavy on the cream and you can taste each clam in every bite.\n\nEntrees: Each entree comes with a side, rice pilaf, red potatoes, and broccoli.\n\nScallops with Broccoli - The scallops were perfectly cooked. Crisp outside but tender inside.  I'm glad I was able to share that with my gf. The broccoli was good but I love broccoli so I had nothing to complain.\n\nSpicy Snapper with Rice Pilaf - The rice pilaf was ok but I think next time I'll get the red potatoes. It might bring out the snapper more. But the grilled snapper was so good. The spiciness was not that spicy to me. I'd prefer have it hotter but I understand it may lessen the integrity of the fish itself.\n\nOverall this place is cute for a nice dinner with your SO. While we were sitting there, I was telling my gf I wonder how this place was in its HeyDay. This restaurant has character and a long history. \n\nSo my recommendation is to try it first before you make a judgement call based on people's comments. But if you like seafood without all the complications of being \"fusion\" then come to this place.", "author": "Angie P."}

I knew from the warm greeting from the guy at the door and the complimentary glasses of white wine that he gave us that I was going to like this place.\n\nOf course you want what's fresh so we checked out the blackboard with the dinner specials.  We went with some of the grilled options:  Ahi Tuna for BF and \"Spicy\" Snapper for me ($24.48 and $18.68).  A good deal since it comes with soup or salad.\n\nThe soups were great especially with the big hunk of sourdough bread that was already on the table.  The soup of the day was a Salmon Bisque that definitely did not skimp on the cream.  BF loved it but I preferred the Clam Chowder.  Not too creamy and well seasoned with chunks of clam, potatoes, and celery throughout.  One of the best I've ever had.\n\nOur entrees were generously portioned.  They come with a carb of your choice (potato, rice, or fries) but they let me get the veggie of the day instead (broccoli).  BF's Ahi Tuna was supposedly medium-rare but it was a little overcooked.  He dolled it up with some of the delicious wasabi butter and some soy sauce.  My \"Spicy\" Snapper was indeed spicy with a generous amount of cajun-ish seasonings and nicely cooked.  The tartar sauce was addictive.\n\nWe were pretty full but of course I had to see the dessert menu ($5.25 each).  I was happy to see that they had my favorite cheesecake on the menu, Zanze's.  It was delicious as always.  BF had Fat Angel Bakery's Fresh Fruit Crumble which was like a mini blueberry and peach pie.  He liked it but it would have been even better warmed up in an oven instead of a microwave and with a dollop of ice cream.\n\nOur meal was very reasonably priced (around $60 + tip) and service was efficient and friendly.  I can see why Pacific Cafe has been around for 36 years and I hope it will be around for many more.\n\n(Thank you BF!)\n\nAJ1\n\n----------------\n\nUpdate 5/19/11:\n\nAdding another star!\n\nMomma C. loves seafood and reasonable prices so we headed straight to Pacific Cafe which continues to rock.\n\nNote to Greedy Self:  You do not need an appetizer.  The Steamed Mussels we got were t-t-t-tasty tasty.  However, by the time I ate that, plus the sourdough bread, and the cup of Pacific Clam Chowda that came with the entr\u00e9e, I barely had room for my entr\u00e9e.\n\nIt was a good one too:  Crabcakes.  These two babies were about the size of hockey pucks and chock full o' crab and herbs.  Delicious!  Momma C. and J liked their respective Spicy Red Snapper and Salmon and Prawns combo.\n\nCan't wait to go back!", "author": "Amy C."}

Definitely overpriced for the quality. \n\nWe have been here a few times since we live nearby. The big downfall is the service. Staff is not very friendly and always hurried. They make you feel like you are inconveniencing them by eating here. We would have to be starving to bother going back. They only got a 2 instead of 1 because the food was okay and the quaintness upon arrival is nice...until any of the servers open their mouths.", "author": "Kristin K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-12", "description": "This is my favorite seafood restaurant in the city.  Their 'specials' menu always has something great - I try to order something new each time I come in. (The crab cakes are the best I've ever had).  My boyfriend and I venture to the new 'hip and happening' places all over the city and end up coming back here often when we want consistently good fish (with great portions). None of that \"where is the fish on my plate?\" thing happening here. The servers are all wonderful, the service is amazing, you can really tell that the staff loves working there - which I think is really important. \n\nI'm surprised that there are any reviews under 5 stars for this restaurant. It really is my favorite in the city. \n\nI've spoken with a number of people waiting outside who don't know what to order -- and I'll highlight some of my favorite items below: \n\nCrab Cakes (A must! Get them as appetizers if you're not ordering them as a meal - you won't be disappointed -- get at least 1/2 a crab cake per person when ordering as an appetizer. You can dip them in tarter sauce - but if you want to really enjoy their flavor eat plain or with a squeeze of lemon). \n\nSand Dabs (are my favorite! ... but it's \"bone-in\" so that can be tricky -- especially for a date night! My boyfriend thinks most people won't like them - but if you like a nice little light fish and don't mind working around the bones - you should try it)\n\nThe Combo is a crowd pleaser (Salmon + Prawns)\n\nThe Crab Louis Salad is very large and a little intimidating - but is a great option - especially if you're on a low/no carb diet\n\nThe Seared Ahi (with wasabi butter) is my boyfriend's favorite - it's a generous cut of ahi. \n\nIf you love fish, in the sense, that you really love the taste of fish on it's own -- I would recommend grabbing one of their specials off the board that isn't served with a sauce. The fish is really fresh and I've always had a great experience when I'm eating a large piece of fish here with just lemon on it. \n\nIf you're thinking you'll get a soup - try their Salmon Bisque - it is really quite tasty.\n\nWine? My boyfriend's favorite is Napa Cellars Chardonnay - crisp and refreshing. \n\nDessert? Caramel Praline is my favorite ice cream in the entire world and I ask for it every time I'm here (the dessert/ice-cream menu changes often). So if you love rich, delicious, amazing ice cream - then ask for that. If they don't have that -- the toasted almond is also a fan favorite.\n\nThe cheesecake is very light and fluffy. It's great when you want a dessert that isn't too heavy. \n\nIf you're in the Richmond district and you're looking for a great place to eat - this would be my first recommendation. I hope you enjoy the food and the service as much as I do.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

Chefs who put out some amazing deliciousness!  Crab cake fan?  Best in SF here, hands down.  Nice quite and quaint location on the corner of Geary Blvd. and 34th Ave.  Street parking only, but its good to note here that there is a parking lot located at 34th and Clement just inside Lincoln Park.  Then just a nice quick little walk.\n\nI have been here several times and have never been disappointed.  So rarely do I order off the regular menu due to the fantastic specials of whats in season up on the chalk board.  Portions are generous.  If indulging in an typical 3 course meal,  you will most def be taking some of that good stuff home with you afterwards.\n\nThe only potential downer that can happen here is dealing with what can be a long wait at times.  And believe me, most evenings from just after open (5pm) to past dinner peak times, there will be a wait.  However, you are provided with free wine while you wait!  You cannot beat that!

We had just had some appetizers at the Jazz Crusaders show at Yoshi's and were not really too hunger but I needed a fix of seafood before heading home to Sac.\n\nI ordered the rex sole with mushrooms and capers with red potatoes and wasn't totally satisfied with the meal - the sole and mushrooms were cooked to perfection, but a caper/mushroom sauce was missing to bind the dish together. The two med red potatoes were steamed and presented as two whole potatoes - they seemed awkward on my plate.\n\nMy wife's Salmon bisque was perfect,  and the two desserts of Peach Ice cream and a three layered chocolate mouse were yummy.

I enjoy this place even w/o the wine as I never drink any of it. There is a wait during busy times such as weekends, but I find that dining on the weekdays is the best time.  Boudin french bread is served and if you eat it all, the staff gladly brings you more.\n\nI generally start with a shrimp salad with a thousand island type dressing.  You could also have it w/o the shrimp as both are served on chopped romaine lettuce.  I enjoy the taste of the salad dressing as it is tangy w/o being overpowering. I've had just about everything on the menu and I crave the sand dabs when they have it.  You have to de-bone it, but there is an art to it and is part of the dining experience.  Rice pilaf or red potatoes are options that provided\n\nThe staff is very attentive and seem genuine.  Our bill is usually about $50+ for two.

Complimentary wine while you wait for your food!\n\nStarted off with the Crab Cocktail ($13.95) - holy crap this was delicious. I had the Halibut Parmesan, and my boyfriend had the Salmon and Shrimp combo. I've never ordered Halibut at a restaurant because my boyfriend's dad has such easy access to fish, but I thought I'd give it a shot. The flavor was amazing, but the fish was a bit tough - almost like chicken. I just had expected it to be softer and more tender, but then again, I can't really judge because I had never ordered it. My boyfriend's plate looked good and the salmon was good. Came with soup or salad (I had lobster bisque soup and he had Caesar salad) and red potatoes. Finished off with Cantaloupe Ice Cream.

Overall, we think it's a good place to go to but you should have a clear idea of what you're looking for or rather, order with care.", "author": "Shauna S."}

The shrimp tasted fresh and the sauce they were drenched in was delicious.   For the entrees, we ordered the halibut, snapper, and saut\u00e9ed shrimp.  The halibut and snapper lacked flavor.  The saut\u00e9ed shrimp were full of flavor and cooked to the right amount.  Overall, the service was really good.

I was a little sad since the lure of free cheap wine passed out to patrons for enduring a wait seemed unnecessary, but they were still kind enough to pour us a glass.\n\nWhen was the last time I had a glass of Chablis? I didn't even know they still made it. It totally hit the spot.\n\nWe were seated in a booth by the window. This place is no frills as far as ambiance, but that's what I loved about it - let the food be the stand-out.\n\nAnd boy was it. We started with the shrimp cocktail. Mounds of tiny bay shrimp that were succulent and plump, and served with housemade cocktail sauce. A perfect start.\n\nFor entrees I ordered ahi tuna with wasabi butter and my dc ordered grilled salmon. Entrees are served with your choice of soup or salad and we decided to get one of each so we could share; clam chowder for him and caesar salad for me.\n\nI am generally wary of caesar salads as the dressing is often make-or-break for me, but theirs was spot-on. Not overly-dressed and not gloupy, with crisp, fresh romaine and crunchy croutons. Very good enough.\n\nThe clam chowder was great too; not too fishy as is often the case, and well-seasoned. \n\nOur fish arrived, as well as a side of broccoli with lemon butter sauce, and we dove in. Both fish were cooked perfectly; seems an easy thing to do, but I am always surprised at how often I am served overcooked fish. The tuna was a huge, thick slab of pink yumminess and the wasabi butter added a nice bite. On the side was rice pilaf which was fair, but I wasn't there to eat rice, so no harm, no foul.\n\nThe salmon apparently was delicious too but I didn't try it as it's not one of my favorite fish. The accompanying steamed red potatoes were more boiled than steamed and were rather mushy and tasteless. Again, not there for the sides, so no big deal. The broccoli more than made up for it.\n\nWe forewent (is that a word?) dessert and instead just had coffee and finished our wine, marvelling at the great dinner we enjoyed.\n\nAlthough I generally try not to visit the same places on subsequent trips to the same city, I will most certainly be back to Pacific Cafe.", "author": "Melanie S."}

She raves about his place so needless to say I was excited to see what they had to offer.\n\nWe went there on a Tuesday night and were seated quickly, we were also offered free wine (red or white.) My friend had the white and I had the red, the red wasn't horrible but it certainly wasn't the greatest but hey, it was free. The white wine was horrible, we each took a sip and just left it behind; once again, at least it was free.\nThey were out of the tuna which is what we had hoped on getting so I got the clam bisque as well as the salmon with prawns.\n\nThe clam bisque was flavorful and hit the spot. It was served at just the right temperature and served in a timely manor as well.\n\nThe Salmon and prawns, the prawns were good but nothing special. I don't know if the prawns were supposed to be flavored but they surely didn't taste like they had any seasoning or flavoring. The salmon were extremely hot when I received it, not even the potatoes were as hot as the salmon (odd that it was this hot when the clam bisque was just perfect.) The salmon was far to dry and over cooked. The salmon was so dry and over cooked I couldn't taste any sort of freshness to it. Its like they kept cooking it to make sure it was actually dead.\n\nThe bread that they gave us was alright but then again I'm not a big bread girl, my friend on the other hand is. She accidentally dropped the last piece of the bread and put in the basket to as for more bread as she had dropped this piece. The waitress came by quickly with a new basket and tried to dump the remaining bread that we had in the basket into the new basket of bread. Instead of just dumping into the new bread basket which was bad enough, the old bread (that was the one that had fallen to begin with) fell on my plate of food!

Yes there was complimentary wine while you wait which is a very smart business tactic though I don't drink alcohol so it didn't do much for me.

It was even spicy for my partner, who's Indian. He liked it though he preferred to have the spices mostly marinated, he felt like it was mostly sprinkled on top for an extra kick. I had the calamari steak, which was buttery and good for the first several bites. After I ate about 1/3 of it I felt like it was too much for me and I couldn't finish it. Even with the potatoes between bites, I felt like it was too much of the same taste. Maybe in small bits in moderation, or with half the calamari steak with something else it would've been better.\n\nThe chocolate cake and coffee was very good though I felt a little rushed because the amount of people waiting made me feel guilty.

The waitress encouraged us to order fish and chips, off the menu since we had three kids with us. I said, what fish would you recommend? She answered, Halibut is really the only decent option. So we did. They charged us $26 PER order. We ordered two... so we spent $52 + tip + tax for just the kids' super dry fish and chips that nobody enjoyed. It's our fault for not asking the price, but she said it was what most kids ordered so we were expecting kid-friendly prices. This was in addition to our regular meal of seafood, which was regularly priced and regularly  cooked. I don't understand how this place gets the $$ rating. You hear about review fraud, and this place makes me wonder... we left feeling totally duped. \n\nSecond, the place was super cramped and GERIATRIC. With kids, you end up eating dinner at 5:30 and the place was packed with people that were in their 70s-80s. That should give you a good idea for what you're getting. I typically love traditional restaurants that are throwbacks to a bygone era, but this vibe was not nostalgic-- it was staid and smelled like old people that took forever in their one bathroom. \n\nOh yes, that brings me to my next point, the bathroom... Let me take a deep breath here. If you need to go to this restaurant for any reason, GO POTTY BEFORE YOU EAT HERE. It is not even a quarter bath. It's like a 1/8 bath. I don't like to touch many things in a filthy public bath, but you can't help rubbing yourself all over the place because just to turn around and flush means that you're bumping up against the sink. Forget about having to take a toddler. Nuff said. Let your imagination fill in with Trainspotting clips here...\n\nMost importantly, the food was subpar. My shrimp louie salad was disgusting. It was thousand island and bay shrimp over dried lettuce (brown edges and all). All three fish dishes (other than the dry fish and chips) were mediocre. I could do better with some salt, butter and a pan. The only thing I ate was the clam chowder (it had a nice kick). \n\nAside, the free wine was really bad. It was sour and smelled weird.

The waiter came by only reluctantly throughout the evening and barely looked at us or spoke. That would have been okay had the food been good, but sadly it was awful.\n\nWe got the shrimp cocktail to start (hard to mess up), then the crab cakes and the grilled salmon as mains, one with clam chowder and fries, the other with crab bisque and rice pilaf. Wow, nasty... the crab cakes, admittedly, were okay. Not the bland stuff you usually get. The rest was cafeteria-quality food.\n\nClaw chowder tasted like it was out of a can, really gross. Crab bisque was a gelatinous blob of cream and corn starch with maybe a hint of crab in there somewhere. Definitely didn't have that fresh shellfish-stock taste that makes a great bisque.\n\nI had two bites of the rice and couldn't do any more of it. Just really awful, overcooked, seasoning tastes like out of a box. Fries I didn't try b/c they looked so bad.\n\nThe salmon was cooked very poorly. Overdone and tough on the outside, raw in the middle, and served with a slab of butter dumped on top. I felt sorry for the fish. Also, we could see the cooks in the open kitchen from our table, and I watched my salmon sit under the heat lamps for over 5 minutes before the accompanying crab cakes came out. Not cool. They also looked like they hate their jobs, which is also not cool when they're practically cooking in the dining room.\n\nAll of this might have been okay if we were paying $12.99 a plate, but it was more like $25.99 a plate. You can get light-years better seafood in SF for the same price and eat in a place that doesn't look like they haven't changed the decor since they opened in 1974. \n\nI would definitely never come back here.

It is our time at the end of the week to catch up and just enjoy each other. It's more than going out, it is friendship and keeping that \"flame\" going.  \n\nSo this Saturday was another opportunity. We just wanted a nice, relaxing and laid-back dinner after a really exhausting work week. Pacific Cafe was the perfect place.  It was homey and unpretentious. People were casually and warmly dressed for the cold Richmond district weather . \n\nThis restaurant has been around since 1974 and as San Francisco as you can get--local, friendly and specializing in seafood.

We didn't mind since it was nice to be cozy in this cold weather--or sit outside of the restaurant and start a friendly conversation with others who are waiting for their table.\n\nSince BF does not drink, so I got 2 glasses of nice Chardonnay. (Woo Hoo!)  The staff came out to REFILL our glasses but 2 glasses of wine are pretty much all I can handle.\n\nIt didn't take us long to get seated at one of the wooden booths, probably about half an hour.

Let me just say that it was the best fish soup I've ever had!  Not fishy but creamy and really flavorful. BF loved his clam chowder which was not overly rich.\n\nFor our entrees, BF had the PARMESAN HALIBUT and I had the CALAMARI STEAK. Both seafood dishes came with a choice of rice, mashed potato or french fries They were really delicious and seasoned well. Tender and not tough or dry.\n\nI didn't finish my calamari steak because I HAD to eat dessert.  BF and I splurged.

They give rustic bread and butter and serve large portions of salmon, prawns, snapper, halibut or another catch of the day. The staff are warm, professional and efficient.\nOn my last visit, there was a line out the door, but within 20 minutes we were seated. I ordered the salmon and prawns and was delighted by the prawns soaked in garlic and butter sauce. After the prawns, I used red potatoes to soak up the rest of the buttery flavor. My water glass was never less than half full. When we wanted to leave, the check came immediately. In all, a simply lovely neighborhood restaurant.", "author": "Nicole S."}

Every time we visit San Fran, we would plan one night to come to Pacific Cafe. It has always been so much fun standing around talking to people from all over while drinking several glasses of complimentary wine, as if you are at a foodie home group. \nTo be fair, the seafood has always been very fresh, something that is absolutely necessary and I appreciate this place for that. My son had raw oysters as an appetizer, which he said was delicious. We had chowder, but I am a purist, having grown up in Boston, and the base had way too much flour in it for me, preferring a cream reduction, as well as too much thyme. Maybe that's a regional difference because my son who lives here liked it.\nI got scallops scampi-style, once again very fresh, with tomatoes and garlic, but there was almost no flavor to it because the chafing dish was full to the brim with oil; I don't even think it was butter. I want to taste the garlic in scampi!\nMy husband had fried oysters, which he normally loves, but the fat used to fry them had not been changed frequently enough, as evidenced by the dark color, saturation of grease and burnt taste. He was very disappointed. Fresh seafood is totally spoiled by improper preparation.\nOur son's girlfriend had white fish with lemon and capers that was simply and excellently prepared. Our son had salmon and fried shrimp which he also said was very good.\nUnfortunately, I think the family tradition has been broken because my husband says he won't go back.", "author": "Anna Marie P."}

It was a long hour listening to your life story about moving from Detroit to San Francisco, your hotel preferences for the area, and your thoughts on healthcare reform, but the restaurant tip made it all worthwhile.\n\nFood: The scallops with lemon butter were cooked perfectly. The crab appetizer was an ice cream scoop size of fresh dungeness crabmeat served with cocktail sauce. My friend's crab cake appetizer was off the hook. Salmon bisque was really creamy, so depending on your taste that could be good or bad. The grilled salmon was bland, but it was fresh and was cooked well. Most of the dishes are not overly seasoned or doused in sauce, just served with some liquid butter, lemon, and homemade tartar sauce.\n\nPacific Cafe isn't some hoity toity place, which is what I really appreciate. It's just fresh seafood, cooked by pros, showcasing the pureness of the ingredients.

How many places can you say that for?  \n\nDelicious seafood.  Don't come here if you don't want seafood.  That's what they do, and they do it well.\n\nCozy atmosphere.

(And too bad she isn't a yelper to tip the scale here.) \n\nWhat she would have raved about: the free wine while waiting. That won her over instantly. I am pretty sure you could serve her frozen dinners after that and she will still be like \"well, they are nice people....\" The other couple of stars from her would be for the ambiance and the food, both comforting. The fact that it's a homey establishment older than her eldest kid means there is history and tradition here. And the menu is simple and straightforward. Nothing \"avant-garde.\" You pick your fish, you pick your side, and you get what you ordered. When they say potatoes, you get two solid red potatoes, nothing trendy like sweet potato fries with wasabi dipping or something. \n\nNow, for me, the reception is a little different. First, I don't drink wine so I gave mine to my MIL. I do like the homey ambiance and decor and especially the nice wooden booths a lot. I also enjoy a simple and straightforward menu, but I was a bit disappointed with the dishes. I had the Snapper \"Spicy.\" They said it's kinda Cajun flavored and my mouth instantly watered reminiscing over the Cajun-style seafood pasta at Maritime Cafe. Unfortunately my fish was over cooked. I am not sure how the fish can seem to be moist but rubbery at the same time. But it was. And as I tried my husband's halibut Parmesan, I felt like his fish was kinda overcooked too. More disappointing was the sides: the red potatoes that came in two solid uncut potatoes! I didn't know what to do with them. And my husband's choice of rice looked like what Airlines serve. The Chinese in me is very picky about rice. \n\nThere was one thing we can all agree on: the pacific clam chowder was fantastic. Not as creamy as New England clam chowder, but so flavorful! \n\nDining experiences like this really puts me in awe of how complex food is to a person. It doesn't just provide taste, but triggers a whole array of psychological components that pushes some flavors forward and suppresses others. Why else would my parents still eat only Shanghainese cuisine after being in the States for over 20 years? Do American food not also provide the 5 tastes: sweet, bitter, sour, spicy, umami? But somehow a certain whiff, a certain color combination, a certain smile of the waitress reminds them of something familiar and comforting. And then, they have no desire to eat anything but that.", "author": "Candice B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-16", "description": "The thing I remember most about this place is FREE WINE while you wait. My bf and I came here on a Friday night around 8pm and had to wait about an hour, and we were pretty drunk by the end of that hour. When I saw \"free wine\" in the Yelp highlights, I was thinking a free glass or 2, but the old Asian man just kept coming out of the kitchen refilling our glasses when they weren't even half done! It was awesome, but it wasn't at the same time because I felt like I was too drunk off of cheap wine to really enjoy my food. I remember having ordered the crab cake, shrimp salad, salmon bisque, clam chowder, and parmesan halibut with rice pilaf. I really liked the crab cake, clam chowder, and parmesan halibut, but I wasn't really a fan of the salmon bisque (but I think I'm just not a bisque person) or the shrimp salad (the shrimp was too soupy).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-25", "description": "I think this place gets high marks due to the free wine. I was intrigued myself after reading the yelp reviews. No reservations? A line before opening? \n\nSounded awfully familiar (e.g. Burma superstar, Kappou Gomi). \n\nSo ... it had to be good right?\n\nWell, I guess that depends on your definition of good.\n\nWhat I ordered with my bf:\n\nAppetizer crab cake, Turbot in Parchment, Clam chowder, Salmon Bisque.\n\nYes, that is all we ordered. We don't really eat a lot and I'm glad we didn't order a second entree because frankly I was disappointed.\n\nCrab cake: The appetizer size is $9.50 and you only get one crab cake. One! I expected there to be two small ones at least for $9.50.  All right, it had a lot of crab in it... but there wasn't much crab flavor. It wasn't sweet and the texture was mushy. I'm guessing they used frozen crab for this. In addition, the crab cake came to the table a bit on the cold side. Ick. Seafood, especially fried/pan fried seafood must be served piping hot. There was also nothing special about the flavor. Most times when I have crab cakes in restaurants I go \"mmm YUM!\" None of that here. Disappointing. To be honest, I've made a better crab cake myself...\n\nClam chowder: This tasted different from most typical clam chowders. The consistency was a lot thinner and more potato-ey. I didn't really mind it. But the sad thing is... it sorta reminded me of rice gruel (or rice soup... aka \"jook\" for you Chinese). It was a bit of a turn off... but the taste was acceptable.\n\nSalmon bisque: I read a lot of positive reviews, so I was looking forward to this. I was disappointed. The soup base was too cream heavy. Now, I love cream soups, but I couldn't even taste any salmon flavor. Might as well have called this soup salmon colored cream soup because that's what it was. The only reason why I knew it was the salmon soup was due to the color of the soup and the teeny tiny bits of salmon floating in the soup.\n\nTurbot in parchment: This was all right. I agree with another reviewer who said the taste was kind of bland. Yes, it was rich due to the cream. It was even kind of salty. But somehow the overall taste was bland. \n\nI don't know, maybe we didn't order the right things. Sorry, but free wine isn't enough to entice me back to this place. The food did not live up to the hype nor the wait in line.  To be honest, Kincaid's and Scott's Seafood do this type of food better. If you're satisfied with mediocre food and free wine, then by all means, give it a try.", "author": "michelle l."}

My usual rule with seafood is to never order it at a restaurant on Sundays and Mondays. You can thank Anthony Bourdain for that one. However, after a quickie view of Yelp reviews we decided to take a leap of faith.\n\nGood sign number one: it was a Sunday night around 8:30p.m. - the place was packed! Good sign number two: the place did not reek of fish. Good sign number three (and my favorite): Complimentary wine while you wait for your table. Uh, yes please.\n\nOn to the meal. We ordered a crab cake to start - moist, delicious and I loved the tartar sauce. We also opted to try the Pacific Clam Chowder which was quite possibly the best clam chowder I've had in a very long time. For our entrees I ordered the grilled halibut and my fiance had the spicy red snapper. Both were cooked to perfection. \n\nWhy four stars and not five? The sides. Their special vegetable side that night were green beans so we thought we would try them. Unfortunately it turned out to be a  green bean  faux pas. They were way overcooked.  Both of us ordered red potatoes for our dinner sides but they ran out, so he had the rice and I had the steak fries. I tried his rice and it was well...not great (think pilaf out of a box). My steak fries were just fine. \n\nWe topped off our dinner with the amazing Mitchell's ice cream - a San Francisco institution. Who knew vanilla bean could taste this good! \n\nThe bottom line is the lackluster sides didn't matter, the main focus as it should be is the seafood which was just top notch.

At any other restaurant in the world you hope there is no line, but here... the longer the line the more free wine. Genius. \n\nFor the food itself, we got the crab cakes for an appetizer as various other reviews suggested. They were amazing. Definitely the best I have had in quite some time. They come with a remoulade sauce or something, but really they don't need it. Every main course comes with three options for a side. We both got potatoes and they were what you would expect out of a red potato. I think it is pretty smart to have only these basic (always good) sides as it lets the cooks focus on each order of seafood that comes in. \nMy wife got the Spicy Snapper with a side salad. I was a bit envious honestly. It was one of the cheaper items, but oh so good. The Cajun spices were perfect, not heavy handed and it was cooked perfectly. The Shrimp Louie dressing was soooo good. Tangy and simple.\nI got the Abalone because I had never had it before. It was the most expensive item and the server (to his wonderful credit) made sure I knew I was about to pay a lot for a relatively small portion of food. It was delicious, and I am glad to have tried it, but when we go back I will be looking forward to getting a cheaper item that is equally delicious with a bigger portion. I gotta emphasize though, it was so tender and good. Fans of abalone will not be disappointed at all. They clearly put effort into this one.\n\nThe service was perfect. Everyone seems so genuine. No on is trying to sell to you, they know their shit, and they are very helpful and attentive. The host is on top of his game with the free wine. He even went outside to make sure anyone in the cold had some too. The beer selection was a bit lacking, but they got a few locals. I am not a big fan of wine, but my wife loved their selection and the Chardonnay she got.", "author": "Cahde H."}

Parking is difficult in that area, especially at night, but it's really worth circling the block a few times to find a spot for your wheels. \nTo make it fun, the restaurant supplies free wine to those in the line. Not the best wine, but definitely makes the wait tolerable. \n\nThe food is simple and delicious. I have been at Pacific Cafe many times, tried many items, and have never been disappointed. I wish I could recommend a specific dish, but I will be doing a disservice by suggesting that one dish is better than others. \n\nThis place is great for good food with a small group of friends. Any party of more than 4 people is a challenge (even though they will make accommodations.) It's not a romantic place per se, unless you like 70's woodhouse decor. But the dated decore somehow works with the place, and adds to the overall atmosphere of a neighborhood gem that has been successfully serving great food for a few decades. \n\nBTW - the men's restroom is a trip - I find myself spending more time there than I should, just looking at old photos of San Francisco. \n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "O Z."}

We got there for the first seating which starts at 5PM...that means we got there a little after 4PM. Within a few minutes, there were a half dozen others now waiting. By the time they started seating everyone, there were at least 20 people waiting to be seated. Visit their web page at www.pacificcafesf.com to see a picture of people waiting outside for the first seating. This is a small place with only 15 or 16 tables (some tables only for two). About 15 minutes before we were seated, they indeed served us free wine while we waited.\n\nThey provide sourdough bread while you wait for your meal. I ordered the Petrale Sole with rice. My meal was very, very tasty. My friends ordered the Parmesan crusted Halibut...who gave me a taste...bingo, another great tasting prep. They also tried a shrimp louie...I didn't taste it, but it looked good. The serving sizes were generous and commensurate with the price you're going to pay. That being said, even though you're on the outskirts of the downtown San Francisco area, you're still in SanFran...so prices are moderate. But again, the portion size is large and hearty. For me, it was too good not to finish my plate...however, a couple of my friends took some of their dinner home - doggie style! I like eating seafood and my meal was definitely one of the best I've ever had. Next time I'm in this area, I'll definitely return. If anyone is just visiting from somewhere far away...and don't think they'll be back in a very long time, I strongly suggest you have one of your dinner nights here. You'll be glad you did. Yeah, I'm just a random reviewer...don't believe me, then consider this...they were considered one of the \"2013 Best of San Francisco\" restaurants. Sorry, they only do dinner and don't take reservations.", "author": "Terry K."}

And during my last trip home to visit the fam, they decided to take me on a journey to their old San Francisco favorites. After years of them reminiscing about this spot, I now understand why they used to be regulars. \n\nPacific Caf\u00e9 embodies San Francisco charm. Nestled on the corner of Geary Blvd., this tiny caf\u00e9 is full of quirks. Fun pictures on the walls, antiquey brown booth seating and old signage out front. It's very unassuming and can get lost in the lurking fog and maze of up and down, topsy turvy streets that make up The City. But once you visit, you'll never forget it. This place is highly popular. Everyone wants a bite of their authentic San Francisco seafood.  \n\nAs a result of its popularity, the waiting area is crowded. The restaurant itself is teeny tiny and the supply of tables does not match the demand. No reservations are accepted, and there are usually more people in the waiting area than those actually eating. My recommendation is to get there a little before they open at 5pm because the early birds will beat you to it and you'll end up waiting for over an hour, especially since those early birds linger at their tables.\n\nI loved the complimentary wine they served while we were waiting. Even though the quality of the wine is close to that of a box of Franzia, I still loved it because it added to the overall experience. It also gets everyone in the waiting area talking, laughing and enjoying themselves... just enough to where the wait doesn't seem to be AS bothersome (even when the wait listed crowd spills into the street out front).\n\nFinally upon being seated at a table I was ready for my feast from the sea, and this feast did not disappoint. I ordered the ahi tuna and it was cooked to perfection - tender on the inside and accompanied by a wasabi glaze. Among my family, they ordered the salmon, shrimp and petrale sole. The shrimp were huge, succulent and swimming in a delicious buttery scampi sauce. The salmon and the petrale sole looked exceptional as well, and both were accompanied by sauces that brought out the natural favor of the fish - or so I was told. \n\nSome of the menu is written up on chalkboards above the kitchen, and there are always new specials - that's how you know it's a fresh catch. This place will charm you to the core with its quaintness. I left feeling happy, full and nostalgic.", "author": "Lindsey Q."}

It is true that you are provided with complimentary wine as you wait (even if you are outside) and they pour with a heavy hand.  Yes, you will probably have to wait for a table, but under these circumstances, why complain?\n\nThe food is phenomenal, starting with the ubiquitous sourdough bread and Pacific Cafe's delectable Shrimp Louie.  Amongst the four of us, we shared the crab cakes (tons of crab, little filler), fried scallops (great way to prepare scallops), spicy snapper, and Parmesan crusted petrale sole. I give this place five starts because  I would order each one of these dishes again.\n\nThere's not much to add to what has already been said here.

Even then, I would see a small group of people huddling outside on a cold night, which is a frequent occurrence out there.\n\nAfter all these years, I finally came here to chow down and walked away satisfied although I'm not sure if I would rush back here for a meal. It was raining that night so the crowd wasn't there since we were seated within 5 minutes around 7:15PM. Here are my highlights and thoughts\n\n- Complimentary glass of white wine while you waited\n\n- Crab cakes appetizer were fantastic. I'm usually very weary of ordering them from restaurants since they're typically dry but these were very nicely done. It's not cheap, $10 for 1 or $18 for 2.  I estimate they are probably around 4\" to 4.25\" in diameter\n\n- Friendly service, our server was attentive without seeming to lurk over our meal\n\n- I ordered the Filet of Sole Newburg  with fries which was decent but made a mistake. This dish is stuffed with crab and topped with a cream sauce. I just had the crab cakes so the flavor is all too similar and too heavy. I had choice between this and a Grilled Tuna with wasabi sauce... although I asked the server for recommendation, all she mentioned was they are too completely contrasting dishes. If she would have kept in mind that I ordered the crab cakes, then she could have mentioned the similarities and warned me. The fish wasn't bad but is definitely not memorable. Fries were house cut thick style and were not bad and not soggy or overly salted.\n\n- My girlfriend ordered fried scallops with small red potatoes. The scallops were very fresh and tasted sweet. Since they are just lightly fried, there isn't flavoring from heavy sauces which is fine by me. The potatoes were just served as whole pieces. I wish they would have done something with the potatoes such as lightly grill them or add some herbs/seasoning. Just seemed a bit lazy to serve plain boiled potatoes.\n\n- I do like the place, it's cozy and the booths offer some privacy. It's a nice place for a date night or just hang out with some friends enjoying drinks.\n\nI can honestly say I've had better seafood, but from what I sampled that night, the food is fresh which is important when eating seafood. Most of the dishes seemed to be grilled in some way so tailor expectations on the flavor if there is no sauce that is cooked with the seafood.", "author": "Andrew L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-10", "description": "Okay, here's my guide for eating at the Pacific Cafe:\n\n1.  Get there BEFORE they open, maybe even considerably before--I'm not kidding.  They don't have a parking lot, and available parking is meager in that neighborhood.  You may have to park up to two blocks away.\n\n2.  Even when getting there before they open, there will be a line outside the door.  Get a place in that line and keep it--they do not take reservations.  Plus, make sure YOUR WHOLE PARTY is with you, because they will not seat you if you are waiting for others to arrive.\n\n3.  If the place fills up before you are seated, then you are going to have to wait for a vacancy to open up.  In the meantime you get free wine while you sit down and look at scrapbooks and restaurant decor.  You won't be the only ones waiting, and the customers just keep coming in.\n\n4.  Once you are seated, get ready for some incredible seafood and fantastic service.  I recommend the deep fried prawns.  The place can be a hassle to get into, but it's all worth the trouble in the end.  It's an awesome place that I recommend again and again to my friends.", "author": "Matthew D."}

No Long Islands poured here, but as you might have heard by now, everyone waiting for a table is offered a complimentary glass of wine.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning of what is always a pleasant dining experience.  You'll start with a bottomless basket of Boudin (sourdough, and if it's not Boudin, pardon my alliterative license).\n\nThe menu offers a list of time-tested favorites, and a chalkboard hanging on the wall announces the nightly specials, whose prices are not dramatically different from those on the menu.\n\nWith a dinner you'll be offered a choice of salads or  soups.  On the Friday evening I attended, one of the soup choices was, oddly enough, clam chowder, which the waiter recommended over a salmon bisque, and it had a thinner-than-usual consistency (thanks for holding the flour and milk) but plenty of clams and flavor.\n\nOne of the specials was ahi tuna, which I chose with well-done French fries as the side, fried just right, always a heartwarming aspect of a satisfying meal.\n\nDessert choices included coconut ice cream and mango sherbet, of which I chose the former.  Good though it was, and as much as I like coconut, I'd really like to try mango sherbet next time, if it's still on the chalkboard.\n\nThis place has been around for about 40 years, and it might give the impression of being frozen in time.

I've never heard anyone mention it before, but seeing as they open at 5 and every booth in the exceptionally cozy interior is full by 5:01, I think we have to add this to the ranks of high-demand, low-capacity seafood cult classics a la Swan's Oyster Depot or the Marina's Pacific Catch, albeit a better-kept secret than most.\n\nWe ended up waiting an hour for a table, which would normally dock them a star, but when you can sit on a sidewalk bench with a glass of free chablis, the minutes just seem to float on by.  Nor do I freely hand out 5 stars at this price point ($20+ for most dishes).  But the portions on both the Halibut Parmesan and Fillet of Sole Newburg were enormous, and between the former's tub of irresistible tartar sauce and the latter's super-rich cream sauce, we couldn't even finish everything (fortunately they're used to this, and are quick to offer you a compostable take-home box).  And did I mention it was all damn tasty? (Although the clam chowder is really no match for the crab bisque).  In short, I think I've finally found the perfect indie-yet-unpretentious spot for seafood, and it even feels like you get your money's worth.\n\nPS: once again a restaurant with \"Pacific\" in the name has a decor that strikes me as remarkably Seattlesque (see also Moki's Pacific Grill).", "author": "Wes M."}

As promised, a nice glass of white wine was offered to pass the 15 minutes or so we waited for our table.  Consistent with many other reviews, the ambiance and warmth of this neighborhood cafe was readily apparent creating greater anticipation for a great meal ahead.\n\nUsing recommendations from other Yelp reviewers, we ordered the parmesan-crusted halibut and petrale sole. The salads were a nice accompaniment to the meal.  However there was a long wait between our salad and the entree.  When our meals arrived, they were less than what we expected.  My crusted halibut had the consistency of being fried akin to fish and chips with the fish was anything but flaky as another reviewer reported.  My wife's sole was again quite basic with a overabundance of sauteed mushrooms and capers that smothered the central element of the meal.  We both ate some of our fish but we both left portions to the side because it didn't appeal to us.  \n\nThe $25-30 price of the entrees exceeded the quality of the seafood dishes.  There are many better values to be found in the city.\n\nMaybe we hit this place on a bad night with a temporary chef, but it is unlikely that we'll be frequenting this cute neighborhood eatery again anytime soon.", "author": "Brent V."}

I thought it would be more casual, you know, with the wait staff in regular clothes and tennis shoes but I was surprised to see that they were dressed rather presentably well, in formal black and white (with a vest too!)  They have table clothes, use cloth napkins and not paper napkins! I felt it somehow didn't match up with the decor, but I'm not complaining, that just took me by surprise!\n\nI used to live in the area and I always walked by but never got a chance to eat there because, frankly, the exterior wasn't inviting to me.  It looked really old and it wasn't flashy (to catch my eye) in the least bit; a very modest exterior with a classic wooden sign.  I guess here's another example of why you shouldn't judge a book by its cover, so to speak.   I'm glad my boyfriend took me here because I had a generally good experience.  \n\nIt's a very small place so expect to hear your neighbor's conversation, or perhaps the table next to mine was just extra loud. hahah..it's funny because I felt like I shouldn't be hearing a lot of their discussion yet I know all about their issues by the time dinner was over. It wasn't my fault they were basically announcing their affairs to the world! \n\nAnyway, they have pretty fresh fish and they know the origin of where all their fish come from (for those wary of the difference).  You'd be surprised some restaurants don't know or care!  The food was decent and the service was nice enough.

It's been open since the 1970s, and all the furniture is as stately as that'd imply.  The place has a history and it's not afraid to tell you.  The patrons are generally a bit older and perhaps more conservative, at the table next to us was a Russian Orthodox priest in full regalia, with a napkin precariously tucked in to avoid having his habit stained.  \n\nThe service, as everyone else noted, is exceptional.  There is wine or beer as you're waiting in line, for as long as you're there, and the serving staff brings you more attentively.  They were also super helpful regarding helping us choose, and then later, when my sand dabs arrived, on explaining to how to eat them.  \n\nUnfortunately, the food was nothing particularly exceptional.  My Sand Dabs were plentiful but pretty flavorless, the bread was a bit stale, and Julia and Robert felt meh about their dishes too.  Definitely not worth the $30 we paid per.  So, in conclusion, if you're interested in a wonderful welcoming atmosphere and ambiance, or just want to drink without paying for it, come here.  Otherwise, check out somewhere else for your American style seafood goodness.", "author": "Leon K."}

The portions of fish as also more than adequate.  I brought my mother here and as an avid fish eater she was surprised by how large the serving was.

On this occasion, while still having an enjoyable evening, I was underwhelmed by the food. \n\nThe place was crowded at 8:30 on a Saturday evening - no room in the foyer area, people waiting on the sidewalk outside. Not a problem, as the host comes out very regularly to those waiting with complimentary glasses (and refills!) of house wine. A very nice touch! Eventually, we were seated, after a wait of about  45 minutes.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is quaint and comfortable - wood-paneled booths and various fish images & other bric-a-brac on the walls all around. There is a menu consisting of (mainly) fish and seafood dishes, and an additional set of specials on blackboards around the restaurant. The staff are friendly in an old-school no-fuss kind of way. Our waiter patiently went through the details of all the specials with us and assured me that the steak dish was good (even though fish was their specialty!) Despite this, I went for the \"spicy\" snapper, and started with the salmon bisque. (The entrees come with soup or salad making the cost of the meal more reasonable than it first appears when you see the menu.) My friend got the clam chowder, followed by the \"combo\" of salmon steak and fried shrimp. The combo turned out to be a success - delicious big, breaded shrimp, and fairly tasty salmon. And the appetizer soups were excellent - perfect for the chill, foggy Outer Richmond evening. My snapper, however, was disappointing - bland fish and fries, no accompanying vegetables - a let-down.\n\nNevertheless, I feel I should be generous in my review. The food is somewhat hit-and-miss, depending on what you choose. All-in-all, however, this is a great place for a different San Francisco restaurant experience.", "author": "donal c."}

As we guessed, the place was filled with seniors and a handful of younger folks. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple, pick an entree and you get a choice of soup or salad and  rice, red potatoes or French fries.  Don't forget to look up at the board for specials. It is more extensive then their printed menu. I got the  Petrole Sole and Oh boy was it greasy!!  The butter it was cooked in overwhelmed the fish completely. I ate half of the fries and barely made it through one of the two sole fillets. The shrimp Louie salad was ok. I picked out the shrimp pieces and tried to eat the romaine leaves that weren't drenched in dressing. Half of the salad was untouched. The bread was also  very good. It was waiting for us at the table and covered with a towel, but to our disappointment it was cold. We wondered if they got the bread from Azemendi bakery and joked around that it's probably just Boudin bread. We asked the waitress and yes, they do get their bread from Boudin, haha. \n\nI tried a bite of my gfs dish (Filet of Sole Newburg ), which was baked in a little casserole dish. Omg, they looove butter here. Super rich and almost too rich to eat. She made it through half her fish and pushed it away. Some of it looked raw still but we weren't sure. \n\nOverall, the glass of complimentary wine upon being seated was nice. We didn't need more after that. There wasn't a wait at 6pm also.

When the check came they decided this lack of attention did not deserve a tip.  So they left the money for the bill and departed.  \nWell this you will not believe.  This rude nasty man chased them out the door and yelled \"come back another time when you are not nervous\".  \nWhat a nasty mean person.  He should loose his job.  This seems to be a new group of help at Pacific Cafe. I know this is their anniversary but if they keep this up it could be their last year. I know we will not be back and i will make sure all of the people I know who go there think twice about going back.  They have cut their menu down and frankly the food is less than stellar.  Oh and the prices have continued to rise.  If you are going to raise prices you should have better food.  If I could have given no stars i would have but Yelp does not give that option.", "author": "Susan K."}

Delicious but evil.  Do you have any idea how many glasses a person can consume, on an empty stomach mind you, while waiting 30-45 minutes?  Too much, thats how many.  By the time our name was called, i was feeling mighty relaxed, glossy eyes and all.  On the plus side, you dont even realize how long you've actually been waiting for a table.  I suspect this is why they hand out the complimentary wine.  Im on to you Pacific Cafe!\n\nWine before dinner would be a good thing for most.  Me, well, i tend to lose my appetite for food once ive been cruisin the booze train.  At any rate, i browsed the specials and the dinner menu and decided to have the grilled salmon and red potatoes.  God im predictable.  Before our entrees came out we had an oyster cocktail appetizer.  I cant say i was a fan of this, sorry.  I dont know why i was expecting them to still be in the shell.  The raw oysters were cut up into pieces and put into a little glass.  Dont get me wrong, they were good, but i wasnt won over.  \n\nMy salmon was a nice sized hunk of fish and was very good, perfectly seasoned, with a nice herb butter on top.  I wasnt able to finish my meal at all, i was stuffed to the brim, but that didnt stop me from trying someones parmesan crusted halibut.  It was very good as well and i was kicking myself for not stepping out the norm and ordering that instead.  Next time, definitely.  Aside from the free wine before dinner, i also had a glass of sauv blanc once we were seated.  Im ashamed to say, i sent it back.  That was a first for me.  I replaced it with a glass of pinot grigio and that was more to my liking.  \n\nI'll definitely be back to dine here.  I love seafood and Pacific Cafe has wonderful fresh seafood and there were many other things on the menu that i want to try in the future.  They dont take reservations but trust me, you wont mind waiting.  Service is beyond friendly and the restaurant itself is nice and quaint inside.  Im very much appreciative of being taken here....but next time, you've got to keep me away from the complimentary wine.", "author": "Juv C."}

The food is quite good, not the best in the city, but good. If your in the area then make an effort to try it at least once. The gentleman working there is nice and friendly, but the lady who works there needs to lighten up a bit. She seems moody all the time when we visit, and makes the experience a bit unpleasant. You will know the one I'm talking about when you visit. Service and experience is important to us customers to keep on coming back. I would recommend the bowl of mussels to share for starters, and the combo of salmon and giant shrimp to finish. If you have room then definitely order the toasted almond ice cream there. I would recommend for them to get a cappuccino/latte machine instead of serving basic coffee. The system they have there is lame for the seating. I would recommend having your whole party there at one time or they won't seat youeven though you are starving and willing to order more. I think it is a stupid system to have to wait for you whole party considering all the tables are empty almost when you arrive there at 5pm. I figure while you wait you provide more revenue to the restaurant by sitting at your table a few minutes longer instead of standing at the front. They do give a complimentary glass of white wine while you wait, but they do need to improve their wine list big time. Prices aren't bad if you share, but they could bring down the food prices a bit especially with the moody lady walking around. I'll be back, but the restaurant needs to improve a bit with their system and service. And, that isn't only coming from me. Overall, good food if your in the area....Enjoy", "author": "Mark L."}

It's not free. The prices for the food more than covers off on that. Let me drill down into the specifics of this crime scene. The place has been around forever, since the 70s. As such there are plenty of seniors who like to frequent this joint. They get so drunk and happy off the \"free\" wine that they love to tell you what a fabulous place this is on their way out. My party of 3 got spooked when one senior citizen popped out at us from a corner booth to tell us what a great decision we made coming to PC. She drawled on about how she's been coming here since the 80s. Spotting drool on her lower lip, I leaned away from her as a younger relative helped her with a coat.\n\nShaken, but undeterred, we sipped our overflowing glasses of wine. Only after a few sips, the waiter came back out to return our status back to overflowing.  Generous would be an understatement. In total, we only had to wait 30 mins for a table and once we were seated, the ambiance was quit cozy. Unfortunately the moment of comfort was kept brief when one of my guests noticed large white flecks in her water. We requested a new one without a problem, but we stopped sipping our wine after that. \n\nWe ordered the oysters cocktail. Gross. Why would you present oysters chopped up in a glass? Why remove them from their shells only to have shell pieces floating in the oyster juice? Not a good sign.\n\nEntrees arrived. Crab Louie for me, Mussels for one, and Prawns for the other. Crab Louie was OK - not sure why they have to have giant, 3 inch diameter slices of cucumber and tomatoes that require me to work so hard. Prawns were OK, nothing special. The mussels, however, were super dry with almost no broth. Throughout our meal, the wait staff was attentive and very polite, I had not problems there. But there was certainly concern in their eyes and we all detected a tone of suspicion from them due to our untouched glasses of wine. \n\nThat's right, we weren't drunk, and so the food had to stand on it's own. Well let me tell you, it couldn't. \n\nI like to try every place twice just to be sure, but for over $30 per person? No thanks, I'm done with PC. If you want to get drunk for \"free\", and you're over the age of 50 with money to burn, you will love this place.", "author": "Cherry P."}

Until he mentioned it and looked it up on his iPhone to show me a picture of the street view, I'd never even seen or heard of this tiny, hidden gem of the Richmond district.\n\nSo, after making a list of restaurants we wanted to try, my coworker and I decided to bring our girlfriends along for a \"show and tell\" of friends and try Pacific Cafe, since all of us live in the Richmond. We'd heard that they doled out free wine while waiting, so we set a time to meet up - 7 pm on a Sunday night.\n\nAt first we were told that it was a 45 minute wait, so we took our wine and stood outside, feeling somewhat like yuppies (well, I guess we all are yuppies in a sense). Thirty minutes passed. We looked at the wait list, and there were still about 7 names ahead of us. More wine. Another thirty minutes passed. 4 names ahead of us. Finally, we were seated after about an hour and a half.\n\nNormally, anywhere else I wouldn't have waited more than 30 minutes. However, Pacific Cafe was such a great place; the ambiance was very warm and cozy, and the people (other customers and the wait staff) were all very friendly (maybe it's the wine?). My girlfriends and I decided to order 4 different dishes with all different sides and appetizers, so we could all try everything out.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\n\n- the rainbow trout with fries, which were basically a quarter wedge of a potato. The fish was absolutely delicious; we didn't squeeze the lemon on top (oops) but there was a lump of butter in the middle, which we spread over the fish.\n\n- the sole, with a mushroom and caper sauce, served with rice pilaf. This was also delicious, although I wasn't a fan of the sauce. I like my fish very plain, so I can taste the actual meat of the fish itself. The rice was excellent though, and I'm convinced I'll never be able to do the Atkins' diet.\n\n- the ahi tuna, seared on the outside and served rare on the inside, with a side of wasabi mayo. This was probably my favorite, because the tuna was very, very tender and the wasabi mayo went so perfectly with it.\n\n- the red snapper, which was seasoned on both sides with a spicy mix of ..well.. spices. This fish had the most flavor on its own because of the way it was seasoned, and the meat was also very tender.\n\nAs for the appetizers, we had the Shrimp Louie salad, the Caesar salad, the clam chowder and their crab bisque, which was the special for the night. As an anti-fan of creamy soups, I ditched the bisque in favor of the clam chowder, which had no cream in it. It was the first time I'd tried a non-cream-based clam chowder, and it was absolutely delicious because the seafood taste wasn't overpowered by the cream.\n\nWe couldn't fit in dessert, but there's always next time, right?", "author": "Tori S."}

Alison had the Snapper Spicy with Clam Chowder and french fries.  Both were totally delicious, the Snapper boasting a crisp, robust char of chili powders, pepper and herbs, the Salmon being a more modestly straight-forward piece of fish, wish the aforementioned slathering of garlic-herb-enhanced sweet cream butter.\n\nThe red potatoes were cooked to perfection, as were the fries, both delicate and crisp.  The prawns were delightfully butterflied and lightly fried.  The Salmon bisque had an incredibly delicate hint of fishiness, creaminess and small bits of salmon which worked well texturally.  The Clam Chowder was the surprise stand-out with it's stew-like consistency and taste - a flour and oil based flavor that reminds me of my own Mother's beef stew - with pieces of mussels and potatoes reminding the brain it is actually, in fact, a chowder.\n\nI will be back again, when lovely company deems it necessary.

HOWEVER, they do give you complimentary wine while you wait.\n\nThey have their daily specials on the chalkboard that you can read to plan your meal while you wait to be seated.  It is also a great opportunity to strike up a warm conversation with your fellow SF neighbors.  \n\nFor starters we had the crabcakes and they were so large we could have shared one and been content.  For my main course, I had the spicy snapper and would recommend to everyone especially if you like spicy foods.  I forgot to mention that you also receive a cup of soup or a nice sized salad with every entree.  That is a great deal that you don't always see in SF restaurants.  My roommate had the parmesan crusted Halibut and loved it.  She doesn't care for fish all that much but she commented that it was less fishy than she thought it would be.  \n\nThey had some great looking desserts, Mitchell's Ice Cream, Zanze's Cheesecake and a lemon square that caught my eye.

We were NOT disappointed!\n\nThere were about 4 groups waiting in front of us (it's a pretty small/intimate place), but we were immediately greeted and brought glasses of free white wine (note to all wine drinkers - the free wine is just a white house wine, but it is good - not too sweet, but not tart... think a house merlot, but white... drinkably good).  The glasses were constantly being refilled by this sweet waiter named Ron.  He spoke with us for awhile and even prepped us that our waiter had been there since the restaurant's inception.  \n\nI got the Rainbow Trout and it was woooonderful.  Not too buttery like some 'fish' places.  All five of us were very happy with our fish selections - though it IS filling and none of us were able to finish our plates.  \n\nOn price - well yeah, it IS kind of expensive for the Entrees ($18 - $28), but if you include the glasses of free wine... (you don't really need an app. with the yummy free bread)... it wasn't outrageous.  And the service was great - because the waiter knew WHEN to come over - and when to stay away to let us talk... he even helped call us a cab at the end of the night because they let us stay to finish up as the restaurant was closing.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, wonderful, neighborhood restaurant experience.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I was super excited to come here and my expectations were probably high. Too high. I loved the idea of having a tiny menu - meaning that they know their fresh fish and they will cook it well, right?\n\nI will admit that it was part my ignorance that I didn't fully understand what I ordered. I saw some fancy French word that described the sauce (or technique) paired with \"Sole\" and it was the first thing on the menu - I thought, in a place like this, everything has to be good. Plus it was supposed to be \"stuffed\" with crab. Yum, right?\n\nUnfortunately, my Sole came covered in cheese sauce that looked like Velveeta. I don't care if there's a name for that special cheese sauce that seems fancier than it actually is... it was overcooked fish covered in Velveeta. I tasted the crab a little bit but the sauce was a bit overwhelming... and I'm a girl that loves shells with Velveeta, but that comes in a box for $4. This was in a fancy restaurant that cost me $24.\n\nWe had a group of six (five of us ordered fish) and it looked like everything was a bit over-cooked and over seasoned. I don't think I would have raised this much stink if the prices were affordable... which it wasn't for the food that we were served. At the risk of sounding like a San Francisco snob, we live in a city where fresh and affordable seafood is plenty and accessible. This place is not worth the drive, when there are hundreds of great seafood places in the city.\n\nTo their defense, maybe I shouldn't have ordered the first thing on the menu. The ambiance was nice, clearly it's a popular place, we got free (but pretty gross, but free) wine while we waited for 20 minutes - not too bad considering how many people were waiting after we left. \n\nConclusion: Over priced, over cooked, over it.", "author": "N S."}

Great for dates, family dinners, etc. Parking is pretty easy. \n\nThey open at 5pm, so if you want to get seated right away show up at 4:45. They start serving wine in line before they open.\n\nAnd yes, they serve wine while you wait. (And 7up/etc to kids. Older kids can get 7up in a wine glass if they ask!) So don't complain about them not taking reservations. If you want to take full advantage of the free wine, show up at 6pm (probably the busiest time). They'll also give you bread in line if you ask. \n\nAnother bonus... They aren't super pretentious about carding in line. I look young, like really young, I know that. I don't blame people for thinking I might be under 21, but I do hate when people see my ID and give me crap about it. I look EXACTLY like my driver's license.

I'm sure a lot of people would find this charming and comforting.  If the food were good enough, the long wait and the fact that it's way out in the Outer Richmond wouldn't matter.\n\nTo be fair, we only tried one fish dish, the ahi tuna.  The tuna steak was huge, but it was dry and cooked all the way through.  I guess I've just been spoiled by delicious seared sushi grade ahi.  The wasabi butter did nothing to revive the flavors.  I wasn't very hungry but I was really there to try the soups.  I ordered the bowl of the crab bisque, which was good but a little too creamy.  I preferred the clam chowder which wasn't creamy like New England clam chowder.  It was chunky with clams and the soup was thick, kinda like gravy.  Yummm gravy in a cup.  The side dishes were also boring like the red potatoes that were just boiled and flavorless and the whole head of lemon butter broccoli. \n\nMost fish dishes were about $20 and I think the crab cakes were a little more.

This place is old and my parents are old and 80% of the customers are old too. I wonder what's going to happen in ten years when their clientele starts to move to Phoenix or Palm Springs or their doctors start to put them on special diets and they can't eat out so much.\n\nAnother thing about this place is that unless you're down to eat dinner at 5:30 or so you can expect to wait a while. But this is ok, because they'll serve you free glasses of cheap strong wine (it's a chablis; who drinks chablis anymore?) while you wait, even if you're standing outside on the street. So after a few glasses you won't mind waiting so much, and when you do sit down you'll be a little buzzed and inclined to order more.\n\nThe food itself is not particularly unique; pretty standard dishes made with fresh seafood. The fried oysters are tender and buttery and the Ahi with wasabi butter is also worth checking out, but bear in mind that I've been buzzed on cheap wine every time I've ordered these. The clams are good too but honestly it's hard to screw up clams.\n\nThe service is also really friendly and attentive.

I don't think all places should look hip and modern.  In fact, a lot of the hip-and-modern looking places spend too much money on presentation and not enough money on food.  Places with really dated interiors (the hip and modern of the '60s, usually) aren't always that bad, because their complete lack of regard for updating their decor often denotes a commitment to doing what they do best, which is serve the food they served in the '60s.  If they've been around that long, they are probably doing something right.\n\nPacific Cafe looks like it will be one of those old-school seafood places.  You get that vibe from the decorating within and the really nice warm colors you see when you're looking at this place's windows through the Geary Boulevard fog.  But when you actually order and get your food, it's as if you're in a slightly hip restaurant.  The portions aren't really small, but they're not as hearty as you'd expect from this kind of place.

When we left, the small waiting area was packed.  Entrees were $20 and up.  The focus is seafood.  Wait staff is old school and professional.  I'm pretty sure we were the youngest people in the restaurant, which hardly seems possible.  If the clam chowder is any indication of the rest of the food, I'd brave being part of the \"mature\" crowd to try dinner.

'do you think that that raccoon is hungry or horny?'  ...yeah.  well hey, one couple responded to my mild outburst.  we've become friends since that evening.\n\ni'm a fan of this place.  i'm protective of this place.  some people take advantage of the free wine.  drunk, i once thought that a guy w/a short mohawk, who walked up the street, followed a couple of people in to get some free wine.  the following conversation ensued:\n\nme (to stephen):  (shocked)  he's just here for the free wine!!\nstephen:  really?  how do you know?\nme:  i KNOW.\n(i follow the guy inside, to where the sign-in sheet is.)\nme (to guy):  yknow, you have to write your name in to get seated.\nguy:  yeah, i'm just looking to see where i am on the list.\nme:  (pauses, looks at list):  where are you?\nguy:  (points to the last name on the list):  here.\nme:  (pauses again.)  you sure that's you?\nguy:  yeah.\nme:  (pauses again.)  ok.

It was  soupy bowl with pieces of sole sprinkled throughout and despite all the sauce it had no flavor at all.  NONE.

No fancy preparations to hide imperfections of the fish, but that's not to say some of the dishes can be rich.  Take, for instance the Turbot baked in parchment with crab and shrimp, or the top of their standard entree list, Sole stuffed with curried crab and shrimp in Newburg sauce.  Has it invoked a Pavolvian response from you yet?\n\nThe specials make it even more difficult to choose an entree as there typically are even more selections from THAT board then there are on the menu itself.  And they're all so tempting too (such as a combo plate of grilled wild salmon and scallops you could have either baked or fried).  Shoot me.\n\nYou can also choose your entree accompaniment:  rice, potato or veggie.  Pick the red potatoes and you'll get boiled potato -- I say go for the rice instead, or a veggie (you just might get a whole broccoli crown on your plate).\n\nAppetizers?  Calamari vinaigrette is refreshing, the oyster bisque I had was a delicious and compact A-bomb of a meal in itself, and the shrimp louie I tasted was almost as rewarding (but I guarantee you won't like it if you're turned off by salad greens swimming in dressing).\n\nDessert?  You probably won't have any room left unless you save part of your entree in a to-go bag.\n\nEverybody likes to comment on the free wine they pour for people waiting to dine.  What an effective ploy, I say -- the wine is remarkably bad and gave me a headache, but I say kudos to them for upholding some basic customer satisfaction principle.

It's just table wine, but wine is wine, and after my second glass I don't even realize that I've been waiting 30 minutes for my table.\n2. Entrees come with a salad or soup. You can choose from their clam chowder or, my favorite, a shrimp louis salad. And it comes with lots of shrimp for a side salad that is included in the meal. \n\nI have tried most of their dishes, but the only one that I didn't like was the Ahi tuna steak. It was a bit overcooked for my taste. Otherwise, great halibut parmesan, good trout, fresh scallops. Also love the crab cocktail. \nService is usually great. Attentive waiters, timely service. Price is reasonable for good seafood. Parking is a pain. The wait can get long. So I'd recommend going on a weeknight or going early on the weekends.", "author": "Jessie C."}

Nothing too spicy, no sushi, nothing too far removed from the Italian restaurants, good Irish pubs, and other traditional Northeast American fare.\n\nI took my folks to Pacific Cafe, and it was just perfect. We went on a Friday night, but with the glass of gratis chablis, the nice park benches outside, and the beatific smile on the waitress/hostess, the wait didn't seem long at all. We ordered the calimari vinaigrette, and the calimari was nice and tender--not at all chewy like at many places that serve unfried calimari. I had the ahi tuna steak, which was delicious. Service was friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere was warm and inviting.

Did I say it's in the OUTER Richmond already? On the Plus Side: Fantastic Oyster Bisque; amazing mussels; great tasting fish dishes. The Clinchers: free wine while you wait; Mitchell's Rum Raisin and Zanze's Cheesecake on the apres meal menu; really nice owner who works the floor as well!!\n\nGood date place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-23", "description": "My story of the Pacific Cafe starts in April 1976;  I had just moved to Palo Alto from SoCal and I was cruising on Geary Blvd. at about 5:15 headed to the Cliff House when I caught a glimpse of a very long line outside of what appeared to be a restaurant.  At the next block (35th) I made a fast right turn, went around the block, double parked (didn't take me long to pick up on that nasty San Francisco habit) and jumped outta my car.  I started interviewing the people outside the restaurant (there were several) with glasses of wine in their hands and they all raved about the place.  I usually don't like waiting for a table so I mentioned that and I was adviced to show up at about 4:45, 15 minutes before it opened and I would get right in.\n\nThe next day, I did just that and got right in.  Well, I've always been a seafood lover (did lots of deep sea fishing, crabbing and claming growing up) so I know good seafood when I see and taste it; I wasn't dissappointed.  The sour dough bread was to die for.  I quickly learned that forget about the butter on your bread and instead ask for the tartar sauce as soon as you sit down and dip your bread in it.  I don't know what their secret is with that sauce, but take it from someone who ordinarily disdains that sauce on seafood or anything else, this stuff is world class.\n\nAnyway, as the years went by I feasted on their simply prepared halibut, salmon, swordfish, occasionally sea bass. (I would always remove the big square of butter that they put on top and instead used the tartar sauce -fab-U-lus.)   Then one year I stumbled upon the Louisiana Shrimp, WOW (provided, you are a garlic lover).  I discovered something new to dip that fabulous bread in- as well as those fried potatoes.  Let me pause here about the side choices of those fries, rice and red round potatoes.  Unless you are a glutton for punishment, DO NOT order anything other than the fries.  The rice and red potatoes are hopeless boring and besides with the fries you can dip them into the tartar sauce as well as the garlic sauce of the Louisiana Shrimp.  And speaking about the extras, the price of the entree includes clam chowder or salad.  Can't go wrong with either so long as you are not expecting some heavy cream based boston type chowder.  If that is your cup of soup, better go for the salad.  However, if you are willing to be a little adventuresome, then indeed try the chowder (dip a little bread in it) and add a little pepper and tabasco sauce to it, you'll love it.  As for the salad, I usually go for the tasty Louie dressing (also something to dip some bread in-- I guess by now you realize I love dipping that sour dough in anything that tastes great (just not butter).\n\nAs far as the appetizers, forgot the oysters because as much as I love this place, me thinks those things are out of a can.  If you like tangy, unfried seafood try the marinated calamari- very tasty indeed (don't forget to dip some bread in that light sauce).  When crab is in season go for the crab cocktail or any crab entree offered.\n\nAll this and I haven't even mentioned the free wine while you wait.  It took me 10 years to get into that.  The reason is that I was in no mood to wait anywhere from 30 to 75 minutes for a table.  Well as luck would have it, one day because of traffic I arrived at 5:15 and had to wait the standard hour.  And the free wine started poring.  Damn, I said, what was I thinking all those years?  From now on I show up and wait the darn average of 30-45 minutes and enjoy the wine.  I also learned that very interesting people are waiting in line with you and you can have some terrific conversations with them.  It is always interesting hearing their story about when they first discovered the place.  While most are from SF and the rest from around the Bay Area, you'll find the occasional tourist who has stumbled onto the it and of course will have an interesting tale of how they found the place.\n\nLastly, there is the staff and the water.  Back in '76, I was a 12-13% tipper (hey, what you'd expect? I was just a young guy.)  When I go to Pacific Cafe I usually tip about 25% (that's just me).  I have come to know and love the several people who have worked there for years and years and years.  When I am there, it feels like home.  As for the water, well its Hetch Hetchy water, the best water in the world; it's mountain water right there in SF.\n\nSo, go to Pacific Cafe enjoy the free wine, the people waiting with you, the 70s decor (at least they repaint the place often and in fact have modernized their choice of orange; it's now more of a burnt orange), the staff and of course that stupendous bread, water, tartar sauce and fish (and remember don't get the rice or red boiled potatoes).", "author": "Frank G."}

It was exceptionally good the night I went and I couldn't tell if it was the wine talking but I really enjoyed it.  You get a choice of soup or salad and a side with your order.

This place is an icon, on the level of Legal Seafood in Boston.\n\nMost everything is fresh, presented simply, perfectly cooked. Salads are great, desserts are killer. very good wine list, warm intimate interior. I strongly recommend dishes from the fresh menu, the chalkboard; the regular menu dishes are very good, but not as over-the-top as the fresh menu.  Service is good, usually outstanding. Most of the folks who work there have been there for decades. No reservations. You get a glass of wine if you have to wait for a table, and between 6:15 and 8:30, you will have to wait 20-45 minutes. This is a popular restaurant, well known and loved.\n\nThe building is older and a bit eclectic, with a tile entrance that harks back to a century ago.  Lighting is balanced, decor is historic, the finishes are rustic, functional and pleasant.  It's cheerful and noisy inside, but not overwhelmingly loud. \n\nThe wait is hard on kids, so if you bring them, arrive before 6. There is only one table that will seat more than 4, so this is not the place for a large group...however it's great for a group of 4.  The restaurant is wheelchair-accessible, but I wouldn't recommend it during peak dinner hours.

Service is great--greeted with a free glass of chilled white wine as you wait by a smiling friendly host.  The servers are attentive and friendly as well. \n\nSo, again, I'm no seafood lover by any means, so the fact that I've gone to this restaurant twice in the last two years say a lot.  The sourdough bread they serve is usually still toasty and lovely, that my party and I can eat two baskets full no problem.  Every entree is served with a soup or salad and a side of rice, potatoes or veggies of the day.  My companions and I may be boring, but go with what we love; we all order the halibut parmesan, and I order it with a side of steamed broccoli.  With a little lemon and some tartar sauce, that piece of fish is as good as a steak (well not  exactly, but i would imagine so if I was a pescatarian, which one of my companion was).   The crusty goodness is delicious and only heightened by the lemon.  Mmmmmmm...I'm looking forward to my leftovers!  And that's another thing, the portions are generous.  \n\nGo to Pacific Cafe for simple, no frills, well seasoned seafood and exceptional service.

We roll in around 6:30, chug a glass or two of free white wine and, when our name comes up, we slide into a wood-paneled booth.  As others have noted, the free wine is a brilliant strategy. If I ever arrived at the Pacific Cafe and there wasn't a wait, I'd feel a little let down. We give each other pep talks (\"chug-a-lug!\") to get the most of our waiting time. \n \nThe Pacific Cafe is so reliable. There is nothing particularly innovative about the menu and innovation would be inappropriate.  It seems only right that rust figures prominently into the Pacific Cafe's color palette. But alas, this is the rust of comfort and not neglect. As some fathers say, if it ain't broke don't fix it. \n \nWithout fail, I order the crab cakes with red potatoes and the caesar salad or, in crab season, the crab bisque. The wait staff has me all figured out; they know they don't have to ask. The same size and shape as hockey pucks, the dense, creamy crab cakes have a brown buttery crust.  They are satisfying with fresh lemon squeezed on them.  The potatoes are plain old boiled potatoes--undisguised, undressed--just as the lord intended.  . . . and all this with a sourdough bread slice with cold, salted butter. mmm. \n \nI have only strayed from this choice a few times and I was somewhat disappointed--I found the parmesan halibut to be bland and the clam chowder seemed to have more gristly bits of sand than most.

It was the orangey glow and the small crowd that seemed to be gathered outside.  Pacific Cafe is a seafood restaurant of innate simplicity, they concentrate on market fresh fish alongside a few staples.  My first experience there led me to the crab cakes which were melty hockey pucks of shellfishy glory, beautifully textured crab which obviously came from a legendary recipe.  It has been there since 1973 and survived through the years despite attacks from the Lobster Liberation Front and the threat of building collapse and whilst I can't claim to have been dining there since 1973, the ten or so times I've been there have been wonderful.  \n\nHighlights of the menu are the crab cakes and the halibut but the real show stopper there is the calamari steak meuniere.  They take the body of a squid the size of which i've only dreamed of, pound it flat, lightly coat it and pan fry it.  Served, as are all their meals with the choice of rice or potatoes and preceded by a free shrimp louie salad you can dine like kings, drink the free wine (even if it is rubbish!) and generally pig out for $20 a head.\n\nThe drawbacks are of course it's popularity and the fact they do not take reservations.  If they did, you wouldn't be able to get a table for months and that is not what PC is about.  Get there early or midweek and you stand a better chance, i've seen waits up to 2 hours on the weekend!\n\nLove this place, it's as old as me and just as set in it's ways!", "author": "Tony S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-16", "description": "I had always wanted to eat here and a few weeks ago I finally got to. Apparently they don't take reservations. My friend and I got there early, around 6pm, and we got a table right away. We also got parking right out front and there were plenty of spaces available on both sides of Geary. This is the outer Richmond so it's not as difficult to park as the inner Richmond. \n\nWe are both light eaters and after looking at the prices we knew we had to split something. I hadn't realized that it was a tad pricey before suggesting it to her. The first thing that was a little disconcerting was that they offered us free wine as soon as we walked in, which was nice but neither of us drink so we declined. Then they offered it to us 3 more times while we were sitting at the table, even adding with surprise \"are you SURE you don't want free wine?\" which I thought was a little over the top since we had declined it repeatedly by then. I had a vision that someone was gonna come over to our table to strong-arm us, push my head back and pour the wine down my throat whether I wanted it or not. I felt that I wasn't being listened to/heard and that my request was not being respected.\n\nAt first we were talking about whether we should split the crab louie or the baked halibut and as I always ask the waitperson what they recommend I waited till our waitress came over to ask her her opinion. I guess she was having a bad moment because she literally rolled her eyes at me and snapped \"those are 2 very different things\" and would not give me any other answer or suggestion. I thought maybe she was angry that we didn't want the damn wine. We finally decided to split the crab louie and when she came back to take our order and we told her what we wanted she actually snapped at us and said \"that's ALL????\" I was taken aback and raised my eyebrows at her. We went ahead and each ordered a cup of their salmon bisque (even though I don't usually eat diary). I think that part of the reason I ordered it was out of fear. I was fearful that the waitress was going to become even angrier and bite me and I was also fearful that perhaps the salad wouldn't be enough. Well I was wrong. The salad was HUGE!!!!!!! I had asked the waitress if it was big enough to split but again, she didn't really give me an answer, she answered my question with another question. I finally gave up. But in a passive/aggressive moment (that I'm not proud of but hey I'm human) I exclaimed when it arrived - \"this is big enough to feed 5 people\" but it really wasn't quite that big. It was perfect for my friend and me and there was even some left over. There was a very very large portion of crab and that crab was delicious. There were sliced eggs and avocado and other delectables. It was probably one of the best crab louies I've ever had - other than at Tadishes. The salmon bisque I thought was pretty good but not fantastic. Mine was hot on the bottom and cold on the top, I had to stir it up for a warmish medley.\n\nAfter a bit our waitress lightened up and was not as cranky though she certainly didn't become someone I'd want to snuggle with on a cold night.\n\nAfter our meal we had some time to kill because we had plans that started a little later. I looked around and saw a huge line of people waiting for seats and I stopped a waitress, not ours, and asked her if we should hurry and leave and she said, \"oh no, please take as much time as you like, you are customers\". I thought that was so amazingly sweet!!! We didn't sit there for long anyway because I hate to keep other people waiting but that waitress really was exceedingly pleasant. \n\nI would definitely go back for the crab louie and refuse to be intimidated by a waitress in a foul mood.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

We alternate between enjoying buttery dungeness flavor of the crab straight out of the shell with dipping some of it into the sauce. The hearty bread is also good for sopping up the tasty sauce and we usually can't get enough of it. We start with the moderately spiced and comforting salmon or crab bisque, and the salad with shrimp louie dressing!  In order to afford pricey dungeness for both of us we often split everthing and order an extra salad and perhaps a veggie.  \n\nThe rest of the daily menu items are predominately straightforward preparations of fresh seafood, either grilled, baked, or pan-fried. The printed menu seafood is more old-skool continental stuff, still good though. \n\nPacific Cafe is basically unchanged since we started going there in the mid 80's, and so is the menu.  No fussy, self-conscious presentations and no Cal, Pan, Neo, or Fusion anything. What a relief. We have been going there for so long that the spicy snapper which used to be 9.98 back is now more like 15.98 due to inflation. We also like the halibut parmesean. \n\nNotice: the clam chowder is not the creamy Boston style you might expect. It's \"pacific\" clam chowder, which is broth based. We have learned to enjoy it when we are in the mood for it. Still looking for the best creamy clam chowder, though. You'd think we'd have it here in SF but it's hard to find. Their bisques make up for it!\n\nEnjoy the free cheap wine while you wait and wait and wait for a table, and even if you come for the first seating as we do, they still give you a glass of the comp wine when you are seated. Refills are only while you are waiting. Once at the table you are expected to order from the wine menu. If you still want to drink more. \n\nAn interesting observation is that even when the restaurant is full, the environment is not overstimulating. We've gone here after an exhausting day and enjoyed having a relaxing meal. It's always relaxing to eat here even though it doesn't look like \"it's been designed and conceived to be relaxing\". Like I said, not self-conscious or considered. Just a regular nice place, with giant huge steak fries.\n\nAvoid the Pacific Cafe over in Marin.

I deviated from this rule twice.  The first time, I met some great people in line, and the long wait went quickly.  The second time, the wait was sooooo long, and all 3 of us drank so much free wine that I barely remember dinner.  So, we're back to the 5pm rule!  Get there early, get seated, enjoy... and avoid the wait!\n\nMy favorites are the specials.  I've been known to call ahead to see if they have the Ahi w/Wasabi butter.   Yum.  The piece of Ahi is huge, so my husband always gets half of it.  However, he never wants to share what he ordered, which is usually super delicious, too.\n\nWhat makes me like this place so much is the atmosphere (I love the booths, the chalkboard menus that come to your table, the huge orb lights above, and the casual elegance of the brown and white linens.  I find it a great value - you get that free wine, some hot bread, a soup or salad, and a starch...  with really gigantic entrees, most in the $20 or less range.", "author": "Kimberly M."}

Since this place is more of a neighborhood joint, and is always popular after 6p.m., we got here shortly before opening and were (as always) greeted with a complimentary glass of sparkling wine while waiting. (Very nice touch!) It's a good thing we got there when we did, as the place filled up rapidly shortly after we arrived. I was lucky to partake in the Abalone Steak and my sister in law had the seafood salad. Mine was scrumptious, along with the rice and salmon chowder and my sister in law's seafood salad was fantastic as well. Also, we had a crab cake appetizer that was fairly decent too! The staff was very accommodating and speedy. All in all, it was a great perfect spot for me to impress a family member for local seafood and an extra plus was that it was close to the Cliff House for a Sunset Irish Coffee to top off the evening!", "author": "Timothy L."}

After a few minutes, we were allowed to wait inside which was much appreciated.  Free wine was served as we get close to 5pm.  As far as free wine goes, I must say it was decent.  After everyone in line at 5pm got seated, some were left to wait and I feel sorry for them because it is going to be a long wait.  We ordered a small order of crab cake as appetizer and for main courses we had the petrale dore and salmon and crab newburg.  We also ordered the clam chowder and oyster bisque. Overall flavor was good but I prefer my meals served at higher temperatures.  The crab cake and clam chowder were lukewarm.  It felt like they have been cooked and left sitting for awhile.  Same goes for the mushrooms on the petrale dore (although the fish was still very warm.)  On the positive side, the clam chowder was not heavy with cream and it was quite flavorful.  I also like the boiled potatoes which were done just right with all the original flavor still intact without being smothered by butter or sour cream.  On the negative side, both the clam chowder and the lobster bisque had too much pepper and a bit too spicy for my taste.  The lobster bisque was too heavy with cream and despite the pepper still had a fishy taste to it.  The newburg is an extremely heavy dish that I would never order again.  Overall, the value was good but for the quality of the food I am not going to get out of my way and endure a 30-minute wait again.", "author": "Amy L."}

Do the math - it's a long time. He can tell you about the daily specials, the restaurant, or even why the prices end the way they do [with nothing rounded]. Very friendly and open to questions, Frank smells of the fragrant flower lei that he wears. Anytime he passes by the table, all I think about is Hawaii. Olfaction and memory - there's definitely a connection. Frank does his job well. Service, in general, is quite good. Water was refilled, and plates were moved out of the way quickly. Even with the limited space, Pacific Cafe is very accommodating to large parties. There was a table of 11 next to our table of 9. While waiting, I was certain that we would only be seated after the other party had left. But nope - lucky us! Wood panels, which are placed in between tables to turn them into smaller/cozier booths, are removed for the larger groups. Ingenious!\n\nThe wait can be rather long, even if one gets there as early as 5:30. It is to be expected, so get there when you are not quite hungry yet. That'll help when they start pouring the wine! I wrote my name up on the clipboard. Like magic, wine appeared in my hands after I shuffled my way back towards the entrance. It didn't suck all that much to be the line bitch for the group... Everyone trickling in later on also partook in the free vino, but I probably had the most refills because of line bitch duty. With our large party, we were seated around 6:30. An hour's wait with wine and good company? Not a problem! Of course, it would've been an even more pleasant wait if it was not cold and sprinkling outside. There is an inside waiting area also, but that can get a little crowded.\n\nI had a difficult time deciding on my meal and was fortunate that others at the table ordered a variety from which I could do a little taste testing. There is a printed menu, as well as specials on a chalkboard that change regularly. I ended up with the fried oysters - juicy, meaty, yummy. Spicy Snapper and Salmon and Crab Newburg were also ordered. All entrees arrived with a soup or salad [Shrimp Louis or Caesar], and potatoes [fries or steamed] or rice. The food was excellent, nothing too dry or overly salty. I like my seafood fairly simple, and they didn't overdo any of what I had tried. I hear that the crab cakes are amazing too. That's on my list for next time because there WILL be a next time.

Neither one of us drinks, but were impressed with the offer of free wine and the plentiful refills as well as attentive service.\nThe coup de grace(?) I must say was the extra nice touch I discovered upon leaving the restaurant and Bay area; I realized that I had accidently left my son's Giants cap (to be a surprise upon returning to So.Cal) under the table; when I called the restaurant and we verified that indeed the black cap under the table was mine, and that not enough time to return to the City prevented our return to the cafe. \nThe staff was kind enough to mail the cap back to us, and was pleasantly surprised that I had sent postage on to them.\nThat is service and most certainly a cut above the rest:)!\nThank you Pacific Cafe, we will be back:)!!", "author": "Jill B."}

It's only a few blocks from where my wife and I live and we like to walk to it, then wait outside with the crowd. We're not big wine drinkers but Pacific Cafe does make you feel special by plying you with free wine while you wait. The outer Richmond can get bitter cold even in the summer so sometimes it's not so pleasant waiting outside. The restaurant is small and I am sure they would have doubled their seating long ago if they could. They certainly have the continuous patronage to expand.\nHowever, waiting outside and getting warmed from the inside with wine has become a tradition for this place. We ran into a couple who used to live in the neighborhood but moved out of SF some years ago... they come back periodically just to wait in line outside, drink wine and meet folks. It is true you can strike up some great conversations in the outside waiting area. I would say it's not good for groups over 5 people just because their seating is so limited.\nThe food is great, the service good.

My hubby got the crab cakes. We thought they were ok. Not bad, but nothing extremely special. My mom loved her salad, but didn't seem enthralled with our steak. My dad loved his shrimp. All in all, we enjoyed our dinner. They were very obliging of our one year old daughter and were extremely nice, and the food was really good to boot so we'll definitely be back and recommend you check it out.", "author": "Jennifer P."}

I was disappointed to say, even though I have to admit it, I ate a whole lot here.   Came here with a group of friends on a Thursday night and it was packed. About 30 minutes wait. But they did serve us complimentary wine as we waited so the wait wasn't so bad. \nFirst we all had the clam chowder soup, which was nice. Not creamy or heavy, but a light version, a little spicy(very sensitive to spices) for me, and a bit salty but good overall. My friends ordered salmon with scallops, ahi tuna, crab cakes, and I had their halbut. We all(4 of us total) agreed to try from each other dish. First all, my friend said the scallops were overcooked, and after trying it, I have to agree. It was not soft and tender, but on the harder side. The salmon was not that tasty either, on the bland side for me. The crab cakes were okay, but overcooked on the top, it looked burnt too. My halibut was okay, but I thought it could have more flavor to it, on the bland side for me. The ahi tuna was overcooked and sent back. When the waiter saw it, he agreed and without question took it back. The second one was pretty good. My friend shared a big piece with me and I really enjoyed it. It went great with the wasabi butter! Portions are good size.  We had dessert here as well, Mitchells ice-cream and a chocolate mousse tart. Service was decent, but the waiter didn't ask how our meal was going.  Maybe he knew?  Price is on the upper side.  So some hits and minues with mostly minues. We didn't have a good night here, like we all hoped it would be.", "author": "Leon C."}

We went on a Monday night, so the famous wait was nonexistent, which was a plus. The place is cozy, nothing fancy, and the servers kept emphasizing the \"free\" wine. We ordered some appetizers, namely oysters and bay shrimp. Ok people, take it as a warning sign when oysters do not come in the shell! These were small, slimy oysters packed in a serving glass. I didn't try them personally, but only three people at the table (out of six) did and two said they were pretty bad. The bay shrimp coctail was ok, pretty plain, small shrimp. \nNow, on to the entrees...\nEverything here is $20-40 per plate, and the fish comes with salad or soup, and a side of vegetables or potatoes or something like that. I decided (regrettably) to have the grilled scallops. There were about 6 of them on my plate alongside some red new potatoes, which were boiled. The potatoes ended up being much more palatable than the scallops, which had a strange, off putting flavor. They were very salty and almost tasted as if they were cooked in rancid butter. Needless to say, I didn't finish them - after a couple of bites I was done. They were also accompanied by even more butter, as if the butter might improve the flavor or something. I think better preparation would have helped, say rinsing the scallops well in fresh water and grilling with just a touch of lemon, salt, and pepper with olive oil instead of butter would have helped immensely. I spoke to other members of our party and all agreed that the food was bad to mediocre at best, and not worth what we paid in the slightest.\nThe one memorable thing was one of the servers - we asked where we could get a chocolate cake or torte to go and she went out of her way to recommend two places and even call one of them to see if they were open, even though we could have been pushed to purchase desert from them. I appreciated this gesture very much.", "author": "Mercedes C."}

Combine this with some totally plain boiled red potatoes and you have a very dissappointing meal. Argh! The chowder wasn't very good either.

We were lucky to get a seat in the waiting area (us girls anyway) and chatted away while sipping on the free white wine while we waited for our table.  Can't say exactly how long we waited as we were having a great time anyway, but I'd estimate it to be around 30+ minutes.  It would be nice if they took reservations but I wasn't bothered by our wait especially since it was primetime Saturday night.\n\nI had the ceaser salad and Petrole Dole with capers and mushrooms with red potatoes.  Both super yummy!  My friends also enjoyed their food.  We all shared the cheesecake and a chocolate mouse cake for dessert.  Both lovely. Oh, and us girls had turned down a refiling of wine while were waiting but the lovely man secretly filled them back up after we got to our table.  Usually you start paying for your wine once you are seated.  But we each had 2 glasses of wine and didn't pay a dime.\n\nIn the end our bill came to around $120 for the 4 of us, not including tip.  For San Francisco and the yumminess of the food, I thought that was pretty good.  This will definitely be a regular place for my husband and I since we live so close.

He said, at the maximum, Lauren you can only give them 3 stars.  Well, here is why:  (And I agree although there is a part of me that wants to be more generous because the ambiance was cozy and nice) They said the wait would be 20 minutes.  Grrrrr, we both (him and I) hate when restaurants claim a wait of 20 minutes but end up being around an hour.  All restaurants say 20 minutes.  It is often the ubiquitous name for \"just take a seat and we'll try to get people out of here as quickly as possible\".  well, my friend is from new york and new yorkers know when it is appropriate to kindly remind the host that he is a big fat liar.  This is true.  Tell us like it is, my friend, tell us if we will be sipping wine for an hour.  It might be ok.  But we don't want to be handed lies.  ...\"we can handle the truth\".  The wine was fun, though, and something we thought was a nice touch.  The service was very attentive.  The host, I thought, very kind and I might add cute.  The crab bisque soup delicious and matched with some nice sourdough: divine.  Our main dishes, though, were specials but weren't that special at all....bummer man!\r\n\r\noh, but my friend andy and I came up with a free way to get some wine.  Go there, drink the complimentary wine, say you have an appointmen and you have to leavet and there you go: free wine.\r\n\r\nWow, I sound like a cheapo and a wino.  I wish it were better.

I had been here on a date many years ago, and always remembered the Pacific Cafe as 'the restaurants that serves you wine for FREE, while you wait in line for a table'.. It was still true!!  Roy, the waiter, came out,gave us 4 wine glasses, filled them TO THE TOP, as we sat outside and talked. He then reappeared, 20 minutes later and refilled all our glasses.. We had to wait about an hour [as this place is very popular]...but who cares?? we kept getting our glasses filled [again to the top!]...I think we had about 4 glasses of wine by the time they called us for our table. \nThe Petrale Dore was amazing...served in a incredible sauce with capers and mushrooms. Their 'dinner salad' consisted of a shimp salad- fully loaded with shrimp, and you can get red potatoes or rice with your dinner. This came with all the wonderful S.F. french bread you could eat, plus the free wine... what is NOT to like?  \nOnly minus is do not order their cheese cake...it isn't cheese cake,but some fluffy imitation trying to taste like cheese cake..[The Lemon square was 1/2 way decent].

When we're up in the city to visit our girls, we have to consciously resist going to the Pacific Cafe every single time.  We've committed to try new restaurants since there are so many here, but I would be content to dine here every time we're in town.\n\nThis is a cute, homey place.  The chefs, servers, and hosts are extremely customer service-oriented, cheerful, helpful and seem to genuinely love it that you have come to their establishment.  \n\nIt is genius to serve wine to patrons as they wait (sometimes 1-1/2 hours - yes.. we have waited that long) for a table.  It's part of the dining experience at Pacific Cafe and even though it is not great wine (Chablis maybe from a box or jug), it takes the edge off and helps you relax and unwind as you chat with the folks around you.  \n\nThey serve the best sourdough bread I've had.  Everything we've ordered has been fantastic.  The clam chowder, parmesean-crusted halibut (everyone MUST try this.  It is incredible), prawns, sole, salmon, oysters, scallops, sand dabs, and crab have all been fresh, perfectly prepard and swiftly served.

I always hear people mention this place as a good seafood place and, in a city with a well-deserved reputation for a variety of good food--whether in a fancy setting or in a bar--I can't for the life of me figure out why this place gets mentioned.  The free wine while waiting and the friendly, professional staff certainly make you root for the place.  Granted, this is only my second time, but both times, about 2/3rds of the way into the meal, I was overwhelmed by a serous taste in my mouth that only comes from what seaman and non-seaman alike would call an excess of thousand island dressing.  In fact, the shrimp louie, the calamari salad, even the featured scallops, all suffered an ignoble death by cheap cream sauce, and put together, with the help from a couple glasses of the house white while waiting, caused a gurgling in my belly that left me hovering over the toilet in the men's room, contemplating existence.  I did enjoy the portraits of the Cliff House as I wiped the spittle from my mouth, but it was not enough to overcome the viscosity of the experience.  Now, I am far from a foodie, and routinely am left quite satisfied by the hospital cafeteria where I work, but this place left me feeling quite poopy.  Fool me once, shame on Hugh.

And at Pacific Cafe you still drink Chablis and even when it's free it still taste, unfortunately, like Chablis.  There was a time (the '70's) when using a chalk board to list your fresh specials was quirky and innovative.    \n Oh yes, it was sometime after high school, in '78, when my parents investment in a 16 unit building on Haight Street (\"gee Bernie, do you think the neighborhood will ever be worth anything?\" my mother asked) started to pan out.  They were going out to dinner every week!!!  Sometimes they invited their poor daughter, the waitress, along.  I can still see mom in her black velvet blazer and white \"bow-tie\" blouse (Mayor Feinstein was a fashion icon for middle aged women) and dad in his Harris tweed, shirt open at the neck, NEVER a tie, sitting in a wood booth at Pacific Cafe.  They were on the cusp of making it; retirement was visible on their horizon.  No early bird specials for Bernie and Harriet, just plenty of fresh fish at Pacific Caf.  In 2001 dad went to the big multi unit in the sky.  This is where tenants never flush Kotex, dimes never stall garbage disposals and god did what the Supreme Court wouldn't do -- outlawed rent control.  Mom (still here, going on 90) lived long enough to see warnings about both eating fish (toxins), and the probable extinction of many species, become reality.       \n Would the current reality of Pacific Caf live up to my memories?  I went with mom and some relatives last year.  In '78, most salads were iceberg with dressing ladled on top -- a salad tossed in vinaigrette (as I remembered their salads to be) was a gourmet treat.   The current shrimp Louie salad was OK but a bit retro.  My daughter had the chowder and she loved it.  At 15 she is the product of posh private schools (her school cafeteria is \"locally grown organic\") and, at times, pickier than her mother.  The others had the bisque and they were impressed.  I had spoonfuls and I was impressed.  Turns out my cousin is allergic to all fish so he had a steak.  Not a grass fed piece of foodie heaven, but I don't think he's fussy.  My fried scallops seemed to be of the frozen breaded type but they were sweet and I wanted deep fried comfort that night.  The Parmesan Halibut was very tasty and moist.  The tuna was cooked to order and the wasabi butter was tasty.  Filet of Sole was my mom's choice and it was quite good.  Big fries (chips) real potatoes and plenty of flavor, just as I remembered, but the rice never did it for me.  A great meal for the price if you choose the right components.       \n The wait is worth it because being trapped in a fog cloaked vestibule drinking Chablis with strangers is a Westie experience that can't be reproduced elsewhere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-16", "description": "This place is definitely over rated. The food was good, but not that good to get a five star rating. Sauces for the seafood was too over powering and you cannot taste the fish. I think shrimp and crab should never be baked together with any fish. The flavors of the shrimp and crab would cancel out and overpower the fish. What's the point of having fish when it taste like crab? They serve the thick base clam chowder soup and it was alright. I personally like the watery clam chowder soup. Nothing special about the appetizers. Would I come here again? No, there are much better seafood places I rather go.", "author": "HUNG L."}

Great place to go at night with friends to drink free wine while waiting for a table and watching kitties begging for scraps out back.\n\nI had the Ahi Tuna with Wasabi butter which tasted fantastic. Almost feels like you are eating tuna sashimi. A friend got the halibut with Parmesan cheese crust which was AMAZING! I don't know why or how, but one bite of that and suddenly there was a PARTY in my mouth!\n\nPortions are huge, we all really had to pack it in to clean our plates.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-21", "description": "I first learned about Pacific Cafe on one of those Local Access shows (I think it was Around the Bay or something) and i immediatley wanted to try it.  Im constantly going to SF from the east bay and am always looking for good places to eat.  So yesterday was my mom's birthday, so i took my parents there.\n\nWe spotted it around 4:30, but spent about 15 minutes looking for parking (definatley give yourself time) and walked a short 2 blocks back up to the resteraunt.  It was about 4:45, but there were already about 10 people waiting in line! After we got there, about 6 more people got in line behind us! The free wine wasn't great tasting, but if you want a cheap buzz, it will do.  No complaints here. \n\nThe crowd in front of us was definatley older, probably 65+ but hey, I like old people, theyre cute! but the line behind us was a little younger, 40+ (then there was me, 22 with my parents...I felt like a kid) \n\nThe menu is short and sweet, and the speacials are written on the blackboard and on a litle white board the waiter brings around to you.  For apetizers we all had clam chowder (the soup or salad was included in our dinners because we all got daily speacials) and a Crab cocktail and a Bay Shrimp cocktail.  (We like to eat :-))  Before our apetizers came, we ate the most delicious SF sourdough bread, not so sour that it makes you suck in your cheeks, but with a hint of that puckery taste.  With soft butter it was DELICIOUS.  They kept bringing more, but try not to eat alot! Portions are pretty good here.\n\nThe clam chowder was so good, but different than typical chowders.  A thinner soup, with a touch of spice really hit our tummies well.  \n\nThe wait staff is SO attentive, constantly filling your water/soda/wine etc and taking away all the used plates and silverware as soon as you put them down.  It sound hurried, but you can tell theyre just trying to make your time more enjoyable.  There are no suits and ties in this place, Track jackets, Jeans and Teva's (with socks hehe) was the dress code.  Very relaxed and casual.  \n\nOur dinner arrived! In perfect time...I ordered the Grilled Jumbo Prawns, and for me it was perfect.  Im very picky and I hate sauces, creams, etc.  They came plain, just butterflied inshell prawns with melted butter and some french fries, grilled perfectly.  Four prawns was definatley enough food.  Unfortunatley the french fries wernt very good, but my Dad liked them, so maybe it was just me.  \n\nMy mom ordered the Crab Cakes, two HUGE cakes, 80% crab!!! She could only finish one and barely a half.  She was very satified to say the least.\n\nMy dad ordered the Ahi tuna with Wasbi butter, which he said was soooo delicious, and for those who dont like Wasabi...or butter... it comes on the sidde in a little cup so you can try and put it on as you like, a big plus for us.  \n\nDesert was 2 pieces of cheesecake, and chocolate chip ice cream for me.  The cheesecake was plain, no nonsense, just deliciously light cheesecake, perfect for anyone who is a fan of plain NY cheesecake.  Two huge scoops of ice cream which I couldn't even finish.  Neverthe less it was delicious, just like everything else.\n\n\nI would DEFINATLEY recommend Pacific Cafe for anyone looking for a good meal, anyday of the week.  They aren't open for lunch, but they open every day at 5PM and start turning people away at 10 to hopefully cloe around 1030.  Not for night owls, or kids, unless your kids eat shellfish, steak (they have one New York Strip available on the menu)  or other fish.  Do vegetarians eat fish? I dont know, but if you dont eat fish or beef, dont go, they dont have a vegetarian option as an entree (but they might be able to work something out with a salad or... somthing)  Also, they can accomadate parties of 8 in a booth, but any bigger and i think you would be turned away.  Also i didnt see any high chairs, and only 1 table (mainly booths) so if your larger person try sitting in the booth before they make it your permanent table, my dad is a about the size of a running back, and only had a teeny bit of room between him and the table, which are totally stationary in the booths.\n\nBe ready to lighten your wallet at the end, but I think it was a fair price, $120 not including tip for the freshest, tastiest sea food ive tasted in a long time ad great service.  We gave a 20% tip because we were so pleased with everything, so it came out to be $50 per person including tip (without any cocktails or wine besides the free stuff)\n\nA great place to eat!

Very hard to find parking but that's SF. Just talking writing about this place makes me want to go there. We live about 4 blocks from Pacific Cafe.  A great place for fresh seafood. A place to take someone who is visiting SF. So far that is what we have done and everyone we have taken to this place, they also loved it. It's  great to go right when it is opening so that you don't have to wait. If you are the first to be seated you still get a glass of free wine, We did. If you come later it's a long wait but if you sip wine then it does not seem like you are waiting long.

This strategy leads to gross over ordering, consuming massive amounts of bread and butter while spending 3 solid months on a low carb diet where you forgot the taste of bread and butter, and not caring while you consume mass quantities because you're so hammered you considered chewing on the potted pines outside. This leads to praising the food which is ok, not amazing, but definitely solid every time, to being the best damned fish I ever did have, as you snap up some french fries unaware that you were actually eating scallops which your friend said were prawns because he was as drunk as you are and nearly stabbed himself in the eye with his fork.

ALOT) so it was a nice surprise for my roomies.  we decided upon the calamari, ahi tuna, filet of sole newburg, and the turbot baked in parchment. EVERYTHING was delicious and cooked to perfect. nothing tasted \"sea fishy\". my ahi tuna was like a rare steak and the wasabi butter was just spicey enough to get kicked in the teeth with but not enough to where i couldnt eat. we ate everything but didnt stop there! oh no.... we had mango sorbet and tirimasu for dessert!!! the mango sorbet was like literally eating a fresh mango. it was soooooooooo good. and the tirimasu? i would take a bullet for it. \nso as you can see by my long ass review (and if you have even made it this far) i super enjoyed my 2 hour long meal at the pacific cafe. if you drive by and see me in the window, honk and wave, because i'll be there ALLL night.", "author": "Aly L."}

The service was discreet and fluid, the food was cooked to perfection (especially the really crunchy fries with mayo), and the ambience was mellow and cool.

It looks the same, the menu is the same, and that's just how I hope it stays.  It's really not worth the lines, even if they do give you all that free wine (a tradition I love!) but it's worth the experience for a family outing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-01-14", "description": "I have been to this restaurant dozens of times, even though I have never lived anywhere near it (way out on Geary, near the Cliff House). It's a cozy little old-school seafood place, with a moderate selection of primarily fish items on the menu. Being that I'm not a white fish fan in general, I get the salmon every single time I go, and I always enjoy it. I'd recommend choosing the french fries as the side, because they are super-thick homemade jobbers, that taste delicious when dipped into the tartar sauce. Yummm.  The main thing for me about this restaurant though, is not it's food. It's that it's so popular, and the seating is so limited (maybe 12 booths?) that there is always a wait outside. And the wait can be long. I've waited over an hour many times, and have probably waited for almost two hours, more than once. And although this might seem INSANE to some (especially since depending on the season, the fog and wind can be intensely bone-chilling out there!) -- the thing that makes it so acceptable is how the hostess keeps coming outside, pouring free glasses of house Chardonnay. So the longer you wait, the more you drink, and the less you care about how long you've been out there, or how brutal each gust of wind might be on your exposed fingers, as you clutch the stem of your wine glass. It's actually a real bonding experience with the folks that you are eating out with, as you huddle on the sidewalk, waiting for your name to be called. I've been part of some great conversations out there, that can get more and more interesting, with each sip of wine. And then FINALLY, when our name is called -- I invariably have to carefully stabilize myself by touching the tops of the booths as I make my way back to our seats... making certain that I don't do a loopy fall into the aisle, before dinner is even served. And at the end... after I've enjoyed my salmon and french fries... my head will have cleared, and I'll be all warm and full and will have completely forgotten about the near-Arctic earlier waiting experience, and will only have happy thoughts about what a wonderful restaurant this truly is.", "author": "Zoe H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-06-10", "description": "My bf took me to dinner here for our anniversary. I loved that they serve free wine while you wait in line. For someone like me though, who is a total light weight it isn't so good as I was drunk by my second glass (they aren't shy about refills) since I had nothing in my stomach and we waited for an hour (they don't take reservations). Luckily I didn't embaress myself too much. Anyway the food itself was ok, I had \"spicy\" snapper, which was clearly just seasoned with bit of cajun spices and grilled. Simple, and spicy but since snapper isn't that flavorful, kind of boring, I would have preferred a sauce. It was served with thick cut fries which were more like potatoes. The bf had crab cakes which he liked and I thought were ok, a bit too mayoie for me. However we both had the salmon bisque and it was fabulous! it had a nice kick to it and I could have had another bowl. For desert we had the chocolate mousse cake which really wasn't mousse like at all, it was just a super rich dense chocolate cake. The food was brought out very quickly and service was somewhat short, I imagine they want to turn tables over as quickly as possible. Overall it seems they are going for a simple preparation and presentation, which is good for some items but not all. I did have a nice evening though so I would have given pacific 4 stars, but it would have been based more on the company, which isn't quite fair, so three it is.", "author": "Meg L."}

Pacific Cafe is a cozy local's hangout that serves only the freshest seafood.  There is a large specials board with the evening's offerings that will guarantee you're in for a delicious meal.  When you finally nab a table with your complimentary wine in hand, you'll find fresh cut lemons on the table and a basket of incredibly fresh Boudin Sourdough with enough butter to get you well on your way to a heart-attack.  All seafood entres included a cup of soup (never tried it) or a choice of house salads (choose the Louie w/bay shrimps practically a meal in itself). As for entres there are many to recommend but if the Grilled (scampi sized) Prawns are on the menu.....ORDER THEM!  The wait-staff is very friendly as are the other patrons that you'll be spending quality time with on the sidewalk.  So if you have a craving for the Freshest Fish at a reasonable price head to Pacific Caf, you won't be disappointed.", "author": "toni u."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-07", "description": "The only reason Pac Caf gets 4 stars is because I think their sides are a bit boring. Albeit, I love their rice - and it's not that anything tastes bad - the broccoli is cooked perfect and the potatoes are seasoned well, they're just a bit boring in comparison to the city they live in. Having said that, I think that's the restaurants point. They pride themselves on simplicities, and they're great at it. The fish is absolutely amazing. My boyfriend gets the Parmesan Halibut every time, and I swear every time it's a little better! I myself vary, but if I can recommend anything it is the fried scallops. You've never tasted anything so simple yet so delicate! It's just the best seafood, and I'm promising you that you will not find better service anywhere in this whole city. After the first time in (we live 1 block away) Frank new our faces and our names. You must converse with this man! He's been everywhere, knows everything and is just plain old pleasant. The other server, a woman, seems to be the same way but in the...maybe 5-10 times I've been there Frank has been my server. Free (albeit boxed and fairly poor) wine until you're seated, or even while you eat if you ask, which honestly after a lemon wedge and a carefree attitude is pretty perfect for a weekend. I just flat out love this place.", "author": "Angie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-27", "description": "This place is very, very good and exactly as advertised.  The decor's nothing special at all (doesn't pretend to be), but the service is very efficient and friendly and the food is very high quality and fresh.  They have excellent staples on the menu and the daily fresh fish options are plentiful and are always top notch.  With every entree ($14-22 typically) you get a choice of fries/rice (I always go for the rice, which is very good) and a soup/salad (the salads are caesar or shrimp louie - the latter is very good for a gratis side salad).  You will, however, invariably wait a long time for a table...this place is very popular.  The couple of times I've been here, I've had to wait between 40-60 mins.  But they do offer you free red/white wine (mediocre, but not bad) while you wait, which is a nice gesture.  A quick tip - if you're willing to eat dinner towards the end of the night (8:30-9:00'ish), the wait will be much shorter, if at all.  My wife and I went just last night, and by the time we were finishing (around 8:45'ish), they were seating people right away, and still giving them a free glass of wine!\n\nBottom line - if you want a good piece of fish, some free wine while you wait, and don't want to pay an arm and a leg, this place is an absolute institution that caters to those needs.  And if they have the crab bisque, get it!", "author": "Mike L."}
