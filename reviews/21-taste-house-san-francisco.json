A quick yelp search using \"black garlic ramen\" returned this so here we came without knowing any details. \n\nOrdered: Tonkotsu black mild spicy and katsu egg don. We're too hungry that we placed our order with little attention to the costs.\n\nThe place: I don't think it's been around for too long but it gave me the hole-in-the-wall kinda feel. Deco? what deco? Service was pretty good tho. Parking could be a problem, it's all by luck.\n\nThe meal: \n - The don came out first and the portion is BIG. I found long grain rice, that's a let down. But the pork and the sauce saved it. \n\n - The ramen is BIG too in portion size. Meat to noodles ratio is ridiculous in terms of ramen, about 3/1. I liked all the meats and the eggs but the noodles are like... packaged? I love garlic and the broth is super garlicy, loved it!", "author": "Rio T."}

I consider that a pretty good deal in the city. The filling was nice and creamy and had at least 2 pieces of octopus in there.

It comes with lobster, roasted pork, pork shoulder meat, kikurage mushrooms, a little crab, half a seasoned soft-boiled egg, quail eggs, spinach, etc. He said it was good but not great. I tasted the broth and the broth was pretty tasty. You can kinda tell the seafood isn't completely fresh. I don't recommend getting this if you can get itchy from non-fresh seafood.\n\nFor the price, I think it's a good spot if you just need a simple ramen fix that's tasty.

Although ramen seems to be the main draw, they also do other Japanese staples, like noodle dishes without soup, donburi, and curry rice. They offer ramen in the four main styles of broth you'd expect: tonkotsu, shoyo, miso, and shio. The toppings are quite customizable, and reasonable in price. There are a few \"special\" pre-made bowls, which are quite satisfying. You can also customize the spice level and each type of ramen comes with a different kind of noodle, too. The broth can be a little salty (but it could have been because I went for the shio (\"salt\") ramen), yet rich in flavor and spices. The noodles are soft and well cooked. I like the option to include quail eggs. They also do special \"lobster ramen\" which comes with a crawfish.\n\n21 Taste House is a great place to go for a quick meal.

I was kind of whatever about this place and the ramen as it was pretty mediocre. \nI got the medium spicy lobster pork tonkatsu ramen and it came with half a soft shelled crab and tiny little lobster on the side.  \nAlthough the soup and cha siu were pretty decent, I recommend getting something different than what I ordered because of the lobster and soft shelled crab. \nI ended up not finishing my bowl after trying a bite of the soft shelled crab and getting a fishy taste out of it// sort of like fish tank taste? And then I tried again with the lobster and got the same kind of fishy taste. \nI normally eat a lot of fish prepared in all kinds of ways, so I'm more than okay with fishy tastes. But the crab/lobster tasted just weird and too fishy, which I never thot was possible for me. \n\nFor the price and convenience in location, this ramen is pretty good but honestly I'd rather just save my money and go to some other ramen joint in Japantown or something that does a better job.", "author": "Daisy S."}

Each item has it's own picture and list of ingredients explaining what broth and toppings each ramen is made of. In addition to ramen, they also have donburi and tapa items. I'm reviewing the Tonkatsu House special and the Garlic Tonkatsu. The regular Tonkatsu was pretty flavorful and great amount of toppings and not too oily. THe only complaint I have is that they didn't use actually \"ramen\" noodle (see pictures below). The texture of the boil egg was on point, but the marination could be better.  \nSide note: they have two sizes - small and large. Small comes with a quail egg instead of a whole boil egg and of course, smaller portions. \n\nSERVICE: \nSuper friendly and quick! They also have free wifi which is always a plus :) \n\nAMBIANCE: \nThis place is located right next to city college and has metered parking as well as residential parking. The shop is actually decently sized with max capacity of 49 people to give an estimate. Good for parties 2-6. \n\nOverall, I would come back again if I were in the area and craving ramen.", "author": "Samantha F."}

My bf and I used to come here for our quick ramen fix, but probably not anymore.\n\nThey re-vamped the menu, and it looks great with new pictures and better organization. The old menu was sort of all over the place. However, now you can choose between two sizes of ramen (small or large). I ordered a small (black garlic tonkotsu ramen) because I could never finish the normal bowls. I figured it would have the same toppings that the other bowls had before. My bf ordered a small (honey pork belly ramen).\n\nWhen we got the bowls, we both noticed the huge size difference. How depressing!! :( I also noticed that there was no bean sprouts in my soup like they used to have, and I only got 2 pieces of chasu compared to the 4 pieces that they used to give... Also, for a small, you now only get one quail egg instead of a soft boiled egg (they let you know this on the menu). The noodles were also lacking here, I think they give around 1/2 the portion that they used to.\n\nSadly, we won't be back.", "author": "Tara A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-01", "description": "Been there twice and love this place so much, seeing it only have a 3.5 star so I have to write this 5 star review from the bottom of my heart.  First of all, to give you some background, I'm a ramen lover, I eat A LOT of ramen and I love spicy food. \n\nHonestly, before found out this place I tried most ramen houses in San Francisco and none of them satisfy my standard. Many of them are popular and have good ratings on Yelp but all of them are meh to me. So the first time I stepped into this place I expected nothing either. I ordered House Spicy noodles in medium spicy and Omg, I instantly fell in love with it. The broth was flavourful and PERFECT, not too salty nor too oily, and doesn't feel like it's anything made from powder. Not to mention they throw in soft shell crab, lobster tail, perfectly cooked pork, soft boiled quail eggs, some veggies to make it look like a FEAST while only paying as much as what you pay for a bowl of ramen elsewhere! With all the seafood in the soup, it doesn't have any overly fishy taste either.\n\nBefore I started writing this review, I glanced through some reviews for this place and I saw someone wrote that this is the best place ramen she has had. And I agree with her at least to the extent that it's the best Japanese style ramen in San Francisco I've had so far. It might sound exaggerating to some of you, but given that I love ramen and I eat a lot of them, this is truly the first Japanese style ramen I wanna have it again after having it twice already. Their service is fast and they have free wifi.\n\nThe second time I was there I had the house spicy ramen again, but this time I ordered the extra spicy. For all you spicy lovers out there, get this one! This is even better than the medium spicy! If you can't take much spicy food, medium spicy is also great! I also ordered their house special fried rice to go, and I love it too! I can't say it's the best out there, but def top 3 as well. It has a lot of varieties of meat and veggies in it, tastes delicious, and the portion is big enough to have one person to have for 2-3 meals :)\n\nSo this sums up my review. If you don't like ramen, don't like seafood, and don't like spicy food, I cannot guarantee that you'll like it. I seldom write reviews but am willing to take my time to review the ones I truly enjoy. :3", "author": "Shirley X."}

In lieu of ramen I ordered the squid ink ramen which was stuffed with imitation crab meat and other previously frozen seafood items. The broth was okay but definitely would not order again.\n\nI also ordered the veggie fried rice which was very comforting to me and reminded me of what my mom would make as a kid. A little crispy but still moist and not too much soy sauce but not bland. Also while eating I noticed 2 college aged kids come in and they both ordered fried rice as well.

It seemed to be missing the other ingredients (mushroom, green onion and butter, unless the butter melted before it got to my table).  The ramen was OK, nothing really special.  The people that I was with said their food was too salty, and one of them had the same order as mine.  The portion is pretty large.\n\nOverall: 2.5 stars (rounded to 3 stars)\nWould I come back?

BUT this place is decent for this area. \n\nI was super hungry so then I searched up food then this place came up. Despite of it's stars, I came because there was still some good reviews and thought to try it out myself. I ordered the Tan Tan ramen. It was good! A the broth started off being a little thick then when I started mixing the ramen all together a couple times, it started to get thinned out. I asked for mild spicy because the lady had warned me about it being real spicy (mild was NOT spicy at all) SO if you're a big fan of spicy but don't want to eat spicy, just order the regular spicy. The mild is barely spicy. I ended up having to add more chili powder. When the broth is that thick, it's kind of bland eating it without any spice. It gets tiring to eat so I had to add some spice to eat. \n\nI also ordered a fried teriyaki chicken appetizer which I looooved! It's exactly what it's called. Fried chicken, with a teriyaki sauce drizzled over it. The texture and taste all together is just amazing!\n\nOverall, I think this place is okay. It's definitely a place I'll keep in mind when I'm in the area and hungry. The place isn't too big either and especially because it's so close by schools, it gets packed during lunch time.

Some that were close by had a \"health warning\" and that wasn't going to work. \n\nThen I found \"21 Taste House.\" I saw that it had good reviews, some vegetarian selections, and more than Ramen to choose from. The price was within our budget so I suggested to the Steering Committee that we give it a try.\n\nWe showed up about a quarter to 5pm and there was enough space available for the 7 of us. The service was quick and pleasant. We had appetizers: Vegetarian spring rolls, goyza, and pickled selection of seaweed and kim chi. That kept us happy and busy until our meals showed up. \n\nAbout half of us got the same Domburi: Tonkatsu with egg over rice. Which I can testify was delicious. The rest of our group got various Ramen selections. Mostly everyone said what they ordered was delicious. The telling moment was when all conversation stopped because everyone was busy eating. The portions were large enough that a couple of us had to ask for To-Go boxes for the left overs. Only one of our group wasn't thrilled with her choice but I feel it was because it was very foreign fare for her. She still ate most of her meal though.  \n\nI am very pleased with \"21 Taste House\" and can't wait to take my family there because the food was good, the price was reasonable, the people were friendly, it's open until late, as well as being open on Sunday, there's free WiFi, and it is close to my home.", "author": "Nora S."}

As I walked by I noticed the posters of their photographed ramen selection on the front window and it caught my attention!  I'm a visual person so after looking at ramen bowls perfectly staged it didn't take me long to decide on giving it a try.\nWe were greeted and seated right away by the friendly waitress.  My eyes had decided on the spicy ramen but after perusing the menu I decided to go with the pork rib donbury since I've never seen that dish on a menu before.  I'll cut to the chase...it was delicious!  It was a bowl of rice with steamed cabbage and perfectly slow cooked pork spare ribs in a slightly sweet, anise, and asian spiced bbq sauce.  My girlfriend had the butter corn miso ramen and the broth blew me away!  It was a miso based broth that was just the right amount of salty and deep flavor, the noodles were cooked just over al dente, the soft boiled tea egg was cooked perfectly, as well as the tonkatsu roasted pork.  The dish that really stole the show was the Teba-fry (house special fried chicken wings).  It was love at first bite!  The chicken was well seasoned, coated in flour, then deep fried.  The skin was extra crispy!  They sprinkle it with their homemade chili powder and it was a nice touch to remind you that you are in a Japanese restaurant.  Last but not least was the side of homemade kimichi...to be honest, it's the best I've had in the loooong time.  I'm from Hawaii and have been eating kimchi all of my life.  I don't know how to explain it, you'll just have to try it for yourself ,but I'm not kidding....it's seriously good!  \nIt's a small resaurant which consists mainly of tables for 2 and 4, but with some rearranging they could accommodate larger parties.  I did a rough count and counted 26 seats.  The bathroom could use a facelift and the decor is nothing fancy, but this should not be expected for a place where the meals are priced for those looking for good food but within a modest budget.\nI have no problem dining here again...matter of fact, I'm looking forward to it!", "author": "Shanda B."}

It was short grained rice, but a low quality.Very interesting that this was one of the lunch \"Bento Specials\". \n\nRamen was the other dish at our table. Seemed like a miso base. Noodles were egg noodles. Just something very odd about the flavor. About as Japanese as Mushu Pork or Egg Fu Young.\n\nChinese tea pre-brewed in \"da big pot\".\n\nThe Service\n\nNice & pleasant.

The ramen came with 3 fatty slices of pork, 2 quail eggs, half of a soft boiled egg, one nori piece, spinach, and kikurage mushrooms. The broth was very flavorful and you can taste the spiciness.

It's great when you get to school early or get out early. Various ramen available for those chilly SF nights like tonight & donburi & other rice plates available if you're not in the mood for soup. By far the best thing I've had here is their chicken karaage appetizer. The portion for a \"small\" is worth the $7.95 you pay, at least in my opinion. It's not your typical karaage. Teriyaki glaze & kyupi mayonnaise zigzag the tops of the chicken pieces, and then they sprinkle nori (seaweed) strips & katsuobushi (bonito fish flakes) atop the sauce drizzled chicken. I ask for mine with no katsuobushi because I'm allergic to fish & they're very accommodating about that. I have however, also brought it home for the rest of my family with the katsuobushi on top and they love what it adds to the chicken. In other news I've only had their Black Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen and it's delicious. You can also add sides of things like egg, kimchi etc to your bowl of Ramen. I definitely recommend this place. It's a little on the small side with no good place to park around other than street parking but I take the bus everywhere so that isn't an issue for me.

Whaaaahht?) doesn't say anything related to Japanese ramen. Its location, across City College San Francisco, can be thought of as brilliant. Aren't noodles supposed to be for the price conscious?\nI'm Japanese (from Hawaii, not Japan), but I am always looking for a close noodle place. Of course, it needs to be worthy of driving and finding parking for. Ocean Avenue can be challenging, but if there is a will there is a way. We tried a Vietnamese noodle place on Ocean near Keystone Way, but I got a terrible MSG headache soon after eating there. My search continued.\nI recall seeing 21 Taste House after a trip to Whole Foods. I know, WHOLE FOODS??? Well, they are great if you are picking your kid at 6pm from afternoon soccer practice and haven't started dinner yet. Anyway, back to 21 Taste House. I saw a sign on the sidewalk in front of their place and caught my eye. Ramen?? *note to self* gotta check this place out!\nWent there with my daughter first. They have a great selection of ramen styles, definitely one to suit anyone's fancy. I pretty much go for the tonkotsu style (pork broth) ones. My daughter got the butter corn ramen, which I never knew such a thing even existed. The portions are great and the pork cuts and fixings in the dish are nice too! For the price, you can't beat it in the neighborhood.\nOur friends took us to Ajisen in the food court at Westfield mall. They swore Arisen was worthy of the drive to Soma and paying to park! Well, 21 Taste House is waaaaay better (in my opinion)! Sure, the tables aren't sticky like at 21 Taste House, but are you there to eat ramen or touch the tables? *pa dum pssh*\nI've only tried the ramen, so say much about the other items on the menu.

Putting aside the fact that it's undercooked, they slather it in teriyaki sauce. Probably an attempt to mask the fact that it's mostly fat and undercooked meat.

Hard to find these dishes in the city. Beef teriyaki was yummy too but a bit too greasy for my liking. Ramen noodle is very chewy like those top ramen places in Bay Area. It has way more ingredients than any other ramen places I tried! Not to mention all the dishes are cheaper than other places serving similar food. \n\nWaitress was very friendly, services was fast, food was yummy, I'll definitely go back and try other dishes.", "author": "Y Y."}

This place is small but really good.  My only complaint is that they don't have Tsukemen which is my favorite type of ramen.  Also, take note that it is BYOB.", "author": "Eddie C."}

My friend and I decided to try this place out and their menus have typos on it. Service was good though, the waitress checked up on us often but this could be just because we were the only ones there. Seems like a family-owned restaurant. I would come back, but mainly because of the low prices rather than particularly good food. The portions are reasonably sized. A small complaint I have is that my rice noodles were broken up into many pieces instead of being in long strands. CASH ONLY!", "author": "Cindy L."}

The person who come to the restaurant at the same time have checked out and leave already. That's unreasonable. I have only 1 hour for my lunch.

It is a tiny little place where I had to stand up a couple of times to let the employee go into the room, which is not so cool when you are in the middle of having your meal. I ordered the fried rice with a slice of pork and fried egg and the food was aweful and bland. I guess the chef forgot to put some salt in the dish. And I saw a customer walk out of the restaurant because he couldn't wait for the waiter to come and take his order; the waiter seemed to forget to pay attention to him. This will be my first and last time visiting to this tiny little restaurant. Very aweful experience.", "author": "Dennis W."}

When I saw rice noodles I was thinking Yunnanese and southwestern Chinese cuisine, but it turned out not quite as I expected. Not that it was bad -- the flavor was OK -- but it was more of a cross between Cantonese, Vietnamese and Yunnanese. You could sense that it was trying to be a Yunnanese rice noodle place, but isn't quite there yet. If you're not after a specific southwestern Yunnanese kind of flavor, then you might find it to be OK.", "author": "Chris L."}

This ramen place makes each bowl individually with love. It's not the classic pick a broth and add toppings (each for a dollar). All the toppings are included and they give you a large and fulfilling amount. The service is fast and great. We get the same server each time and she always smiles and even remembers our order. It's a little hole in the wall place but by far the best ramen on this side of town.", "author": "Chanelle W."}

I couldn't eat it all, since it was a huge bowl on it. The server came over and said \"Was there something wrong?\" I said, \"No. It's good.\" No issues about her asking me this. However, this next comment she made was completely rude. The server said, \"What's up with this then?\" I said, \"I am full.\" First of all, who the heck says this to a customer?! Not everyone eats the same amount. Needless to say, I won't be coming back.", "author": "Brittany H."}

They have free wifi too so I sometimes come for some lunch and hang out on my laptop. They are always realy nice not to mention the fast service.

Really nice staff, very attentive and hard working.  Great to have a solid ramen place locally.  Every time we've come, we've tried a different ramen, and they've all be really satisfying.", "author": "C P."}
