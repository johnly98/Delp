We ordered\n- Thai Iced Tea (2 stars)- It was too sweet. Thai iced tea is one of my favorite beverages and I was disappointed that the one I had here was not upto to the mark. \n- Vegetarian crispy rolls (2.5)- The outer layer of rolls were crispy (as the name suggests). But the inner filling was not fresh and did not taste good. Again, disappointing! \n- Pumpkin Curry (3 stars) and pad thai (wd Tofu) (2.5 stars). Both dishes were average. Nothing too special. According to me, one can get the same stuff at other authentic Thai places for cheaper price and better quality.\nOverall, I felt the food was not worth the money I spent.", "author": "Nikita L."}

I came here with a large group of coworkers, so we tried pretty much all the food.\n\nFor my drink, I went with the pineapple millionaire ($17), which has Elyx vodka, St. Germain, pineapple tonic soda, passion fruit puree, fresh thai basil, and smoked chili. I know the price seems high but you get a huge serving that comes in a giant metallic pineapple cup, so I think it's worth it! It tasted like a fruity punch, and I could barely taste the alcohol. My type of drink!\n\nFood-wise, my favorites from the happy hour menu were the french fries ($6) and beef jerky ($9). We ordered so much of the beef jerky...they were an easy snack to eat with your hands and were SO good!! They also offer dollar oysters which are hit or miss. The first time we were here, the oysters were small and overly briny and none of us were a fan, but we tried again our second time around and they were much better. I would start with a small order initially and order more if you like them.\n\nWhat I really liked was that it wasn't too crowded on a Friday afternoon. There were maybe 15 of us, and we had a hard time picking a place that would be able to accommodate all of us without a prior reservation. The lounge opens at 5, and since we arrived right then, they were able to quickly put together some tables and chairs for us. Plus most of the seating consists of couches and other comfortable chairs, so it gives it a more relaxed, homey atmosphere. \n\nWould definitely come back again for happy hour!", "author": "Dianna H."}

I do think my meal was more Asian Fusion rather than Thai inspired but was still very enjoyable.\n\nFor appetizers, we started off the their Dungeness Crab Rangoon and Long Beach Prawns.\n\nDungeness Crab Rangoon -- http://bit.ly/2HIqtNA\nCrispy wonton filled with dungeness crab meat, cream cheese water chestnut, onion, carrot served with plum dipping\n\nLong Beach Prawns -- http://bit.ly/2HLG0vZ\nCrispy coconut crushed tiger prawns served with onion, peanut carrot & iceberg slaw\n\nBoth were pretty much standardized appetizers, cooked well, and had good portions for starters.  You can actually have one of these for a meal with side of rice.  The rangoons had a nice amount of crab and cream cheese filling inside and the prawns had a nice coconut crust.\n\nThen for my main, I went their Volcanic Beef (http://bit.ly/2HG4Ddz).\nWok-fried grilled premium flank steak with basil and black pepper in lava sauce garnished with onion rings\n\nI honestly decided on this because it caught my attention from their yelp picture gallery.  Visually very appetizing.  It was a bit much on the salty side, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would order it again.\n\nI'm happy that I finally got a chance to try Osha.  It's little bit on the pricey side, but the quality of their food justifies the price.  I would love to come back again and it's a great spot to cater to large groups of friends or family.", "author": "Rodney H."}

The food is truly mediocre, and the prices would be too high even if the food wasn't so unremarkable.\n\nYes, it's \"Thai food\", but every dish is 50% sugar. I seriously wonder if the dessert and sweets stores near here are struggling with supply issues because Osha Thai has a stranglehold on all the sugar delivery. Diabetics, avoid this establishment.\n\nI'm being a little unfair - most Thai restaurants in most American cities share the same practice of catering to the American High-Fructose-Corn-Syrup-Addicted palate. I don't think it's unreasonable, though, to expect better of a Thai restaurant in SF, where probably something like 30% of the population is on keto (or at least in an on-and-off again relationship with keto like myself).\n\nHey, at least this LA native can add another tally to \"evidence for LA's culinary superiority over SF\".

The decor and location are fantastic, but there are a lot of down sides. Service was slow, and for the quality of food it was definitely over priced. \n\nI was excited to try the crab pad thai, and unlike previous photos does not include any large chunks or claws. The crab pieces are very fragmented and I even found shell in mine. The sauce of the pad thai was overly sugary and more ketchupy than anything. The flavor was just not there, and the sauce wasn't balanced.. there was also zero spice. \n\nThe papaya salad was a let down and only included three tiny shrimp that were supposedly \"grilled\". The sauce was far too vinegary, without any real flavor - it was definitely the worst dish of the night. \n\nI guess the \"best\" dish was the fresh rice rolls, they were neat, but beyond the sweet sauce lacked any real substance and flavor. This appetizer came to $11.95 for basically some rolled rice sheets and sweet sauce.. totally overpriced. \n\nThe worst offender for overpriced was the tea. Can you believe for $5 each they serve 10 cent bagged tea?! I was expecting so much more from a Thai place.. honestly I've never had such terrible tea at a Thai restaurant.. ever. Do NOT order the tea, save yourself the trouble and go to Starbucks or anywhere else instead. \n\nAfter we received all of the food at the table, our waitress never came back, no one asked how our meal was.

Several of us got their sea bass dishes, and the grilled sea bass was just awful; it was not grilled but soaked - and I mean SOAKED - in butter. You could squeeze it out of the filet.

The charge is $100 pp if you're interested in their full menu, includes appetizers and champagne for the New Year's Toast while watching the firework show just accross the street. This is private only for those guests who paid to get their tickets. They are located in front of the Ferry building so paying the $100 is not so bad. There's also an after party in the back, so dancing is the next event after watching the fireworks. Theres also a photo booth that you can enjoy.

It was so good, but I was utterly stuffed. The portion sizes are definitely generous.\n\nService was very nice and they were able to quickly accommodate our party of 10.

Walked in on a Sunday and was greeted and seated(you know I love that)!  Ordered a Napa Smith Pilsner to start and was not disappointed. \n\nThis place got packed quick but when I arrived (4 p.m.ish) there were only three other tables seated. I ordered the crispy wontons which weren't bad but tasted under seasoned. Very plain. Following this my Duck in red curry arrived which was amazing. The duck was crispy but had Pineapple and grapes mixed into the Red curry sauce making for that heat sweet taste. Thats right, heat sweet. Amazing.  The portion is large so you won't leave hungry. \n\nI also tried the Osha Seafood which our server said was her favorite dish. The shrimp and scallops were cooked thoroughly and the sauce was not at all spicy like I thought it would be.

This place is such a disappointment. It's unfortunate because the atmosphere is actually very nice. However, the food and the service are just atrocious. My expectations for this place were fair walking in, but diminished upon the arrival. The rolls tasted like they were made in the back of Denny's with spite, and doubled in price. The food tasted frozen and thrown in the fryer. This wouldn't be surprising if we went to a corporate chain.

Please read it through. \n\nI'll begin with the good:\nThe location was nice. Across the street from the Ferry Building. It is abundantly clear that this is a tourist hotspot. The atmosphere inside is beautiful. The drinks came in a nice mason jars design. And unfortunately that's all the good things I could say about the OSHA on Embarcadero. \n\nNow for the real reason I'm writing my review:\nWe make a reservation for 9, and upon arrival they mess up our seating arrangement by giving us one less seat. Not a big deal, it's a simple mistake. However it's how they handled the situation that left a sour taste in our mouths. They suggested to put a seat at the edge of the table essentially blocking off their path to walk through. This was not our problem. When we finally sat down we realized there was not enough elbow room since we are a big party (and naturally order a lot of food). We asked if we could combine our table with the one right next to us (since there was no one sitting there and it was still fairly early--the place was practically empty). They, understandably denied our request claiming it was reserved. However, in the hour we spent there the table was never claimed by anyone. This was their first offense. \n\nNext when we ordered our food, and by god that couldn't even save our experience. The food was such a disappointment. For one the waiter didn't know what he was doing. The food tasted frozen and as though it was just thrown in a deep fryer. Clearly this wasn't the case for all, just most it. For instance, the quality of the egg rolls tasted eerily similar to the ones we buy at Smart & Final. We find better quality from the shops on Clement St. We couldn't make ourselves to finish our dinner there. Only making it to the appetizers, we finally ordered the check and made our way out.\n\nThe most heinous part occurred once we left. As we're walking outside past the window we see the waiter and hostess reading the note we left--they acted \"VERY PROFESSIONALLY\" with their next move. The hostess glared us down with a sinister stare and gave us the old middle finger salute!\n\nBy far the worst experience I've had at any Thai Restaurant. I will give them this though; it was hot topic for discussion on our way home hahaha. They ruined our Mother's Day dinner as we found ourselves finishing our dinner elsewhere.", "author": "Jerry C."}

The restaurant is very clean and the service is on point. They are very attentive. The Thai decor was beautiful. I'd have to say presentation is a 5 Star. \n\nFor starters, I got the papaya salad. It was a little on the sweet side. I ordered spice level 5 and It was not spicy at all. Everything was ok, but I was expecting more authentic Thai food. The Osha tartare was good. The tuna and the wonton chips was fresh. The Angel Wings are wings. Nothing special. The pad Thai was a little on the sweet side too. If you like sweet, there you go. The Bangkok roti was also good. I think the carbs with butter and curry tasted marvelous LOL It was good!\n\nFor the main entree, I got a volcanic beef. I loved the flavor but the meat could've been a little more tender. That's my only complaint about that dish. \n\nI had a cocktail and fell in love. The dilemma is so good. If you like cocktails, I hear the others on the menu are good, I just loved the dilemma so much that I didn't try any others. \n\nOverall, I don't think this is an authentic Thai restaraunt but think it's in a prime location with great views.

We came here with a party of seven without reservations on a Saturday night for a light dinner.  It was a planned get together to share funny stories and reminisce about a friend and coworker of my wife's who left this world way too soon.   \n\nOsha Thai, given its large size, premium location, and trendy environment is very conducive for a relaxed evening with friends to share some bites, drinks, and of course conversations.  The food itself has some hit and minor misses:\n\nAngel Wings - definitely one of their better appetizers.  Nice crispy, sweet and spicy fried goodness.  Six per order (4 stars)\n\nEmpress Noodles - This noodle dish is worthy of royalty!  Deconstructed ramen dish with noodles, eggs, and greens in the bowl.  Then, a sweet miso broth on the side.  Finally, an impressive protein platter of fish balls, crab claws, and pork three ways: braised pork, crispy roasted pork belly, and char siu.  This is ramen meant for sharing.  The wife found the broth too sweet to her liking but everything else was excellent. (4 stars)\n\nClay Pot Taro Rice - This reminds me a bit like Korean bibimbap, but I found the rice on the dry side.  The fried egg on top was a bit overcooked and also dry (3 stars)\n\nService was friendly and efficient.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-06", "description": "This is one of four locations of the Osha Thai full service restaurant chain that are still standing in the city of San Francisco. Some would consider this one the most tourist friendly as it has a full dining room facing Justin Herman Plaza and the San Francisco Ferry Building and it has a sleek and sexy dining and drinking lounge on the other side with an entrance inside the courtyard area of Embarcadero building number four. We came on a Monday all the way from the East Bay and surprisingly traffic was light and parking in the nearby streets was even better. So now I know what day is best to come to downtown by car. We were here to celebrate a birthday in my party and one of us diners loves the food at the other locations so we thought why not try out one of their signature locations which as been here for at least a full decade. \n\nUpon entry, you'll notice how different this location looks from all of the other ones in the city. Open, nicely lit and spacious with plenty of square shaped tables and long tables for intimate diners and big parties. We were lucky enough to get there so early in the evening that they placed us in one of their sofa tables with two small cushioned stools on each side of a low slung table, which was perfect for dining, if you don't mind crouching a bit down. The menu at this Osha is like all the rest divided into types of foods from starters to main courses like land, sea, curries and rice and noodles. Our party wasn't super hungry but still wanted to get a nice sampling of their foods. They also had a \"Back to Original\" menu which had a lot of \"classic\" Thai dishes like the Emperor Noodles which for $24.95 featured Kurobuta pork belly, BBQ pork, crispy pork belly, 5-spice egg, crab meat, pork balls served with traditional egg noodles and classic clear broth. Not only did this provided a great deal of food but it also gave us a chance to try a traditional the Thai noodle soup, which I found comparable to the traditional Chinese won ton noodle soup rather than Japanese ramen.\n\nWe also went with the Volcanic Beef which was wok-fired grilled flank steak with basil, bell peppers and black pepper served in Lava sauce and garnished with three onion rings on top and served with a bowl of white rice. Thirdly we went with the Garlic Lamb Ribs which were deep fried marinated rack of Australian lamb on a bed of their \"summer salad.\" I really liked the taste of their Volcanic Beef which for twenty dollars was one of their more affordable dishes. It felt more like the traditional Vietnamese \"shaking beef\" than a Chinese beef stir fry. But our Garlic Lamb Ribs was an overcooked miss and it featured only three ribs for their dinner plate. When one of my dining mates said she had been just a few days prior for lunch and it featured four ribs on the dish we were left wondering had things changed? After inquiring with our server we found out it had changed (in a matter of days no less!) that yes since the racks were cut larger they were now only serving three pieces. With less meat and our dish being too well done our table complained to the manager saying we were loyal customers and came here not only for their food but that dish in particular and they acquiesced with making our table an additional two racks of lamb freshly made from their kitchen. Now that's what I call good customer service.\n\nFrom there it was only up, as they were nice enough to comp our table a dessert due to the fact it was a member of our party's birthday. They normally don't do this but on this day since a member of our party was such a loyal customer and raised such a stink, they wanted our experience to be just right, so we were given any choice, we went with the Mango Mania which was a unique blend of a Mango Ice Cream Parfait with coconut sticky rice and fresh mango. It was the perfect summer treat. Osha Thai always has good food and great service, so much so, we are greeted with a traditional Thai greeting with clasped palms and a curtsy with a traditional hello in the Thai language. That extra special greeting and care just proves how authentic Osha Thai can be.", "author": "Jason F."}

The restaurant is beautifully decorated, fresh flowers and cultural artwork everywhere. Our servers name was Max - he was very friendly, attentive, and had some great recommendations. We ordered samosas to start, and pad see ew and the lamb curry to share. The samosas were delicious, but worth noting that they are not typical samosas - they were small bite-size pieces and the order comes with 5 so you may want to adjust the order so each person can have 2 of the mini samosas. Both the entrees we ordered were super delicious. The pad see ew was my favorite, but the lamb curry was also super yummy. I would advise ordering extra sides of rice is you are sharing the curry as it only comes with 1 small side of rice. Also worth mentioning, the curry dish was enough to share but definitely not any more than 4 people. We also ordered a bottle of sparkling rose($45), and a Phucket Tea ($27, meant for 4 people) to share. Everything was yummy, and the food came very quickly.

Generally speaking, American diners favor being checked up on through out their meal: \"how's your food\", \"is there anything else I can get you\", \"would you like the check\"...this can be equated to having good service. However, in Asian culture and restaurants, it is presumed RUDE to interrupt dining guests unless they need something. Of course there are exceptions to each restaurant's style, but generally if you've ever been to a dimsum, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai place you'll notice that the understanding is that you'll call a server over if you need something (which one can argue is a more practical use of their time tbh..). Simply raise a hand or make eye contact w the server. I am not saying there is a \"right\" way. But, please be aware of this cultural difference before assuming a restaurant has bad service for \"ignoring\" you. \n\n+ classy and cultural restaurant decor and setting\n+ food was great!\n+ service was fast. Food came out in 10min\n+ they know how to PLATE. Forreals.\n+ extensive seating. There's even a lounge in the back!\n+ good for romantic date, one person meal, or group setting\n+ nice ambiance\n+ surprised I did not food coma back at work...\n\n- $$\n- they skimp on rice, which is the thing they should least skimp on. \n- wish the menu had more pics, but I guess that's what yelp is for!\n\nThai food is usually not this pricey, but even for someone like me who is a huge budgeter, it was worth the cost. The food comes out plated in an extremely artful way, you can tell that great care went into the preparation of your food.\n\nBut does it look as good as it tastes....? Yes! I LOVED the volcanic beef, textured so well: moist and tender while bursting w flavor. \n\nAlso really enjoyed the spicy eggplant. Not too oily, and not over or undercooked. \n\nFor drinks I cautiously ordered the lychee ice tea. I'm already pretty familiar w the Thai tea and coffee, so wanted to try something diff. I was not disappointed! The lychee ice tea is on the sweeter side, but very refreshing. \n\nHowever, I was not that impressed with the rice/spring rolls. It was lacking in ingredients, essentially felt like just lettuce wrapped in rice roll.\n\nOverall: In terms of ambiance, setting, and service, I could not have been happier. The server was handling 12 of us during lunchtime on a Wed - not easy. The food and drinks came out pretty fast, from sitting down to heading back to the office, it was 1 hr. Perfect timing for that busy lifestyle, though maybe they could have not been as busy that day. \n\nBetween the food taste and quality, ambiance, and plating, I can see why they charge a good chunk of change. Even so I will be remembering this place for the occasional time I pamper myself w some high end Thai food.", "author": "Connie L."}

Not to mention that the meals are all super expensive too, starting at around 13 dollars even with no meat (papaya salad, I'm looking at you). The food is definitely good but the prices paid are pretty extreme, especially for take-out. If we were dining in, I suppose the prices could contribute to the fancy dining environment, premium dinnerware, decor and tables and such. However, with the prices being the same or similar on the to-go menu (available on their website) it is much more appealing to get a to-go lunch from elsewhere. I think I'd only come back here again if there was a reason to impress, as the prices don't make me want to come back of my own accord.\n\nTo conclude, it makes me think it's the Olive Garden of San Francisco; people come for the name and the facade of amazing food with high prices.", "author": "John B."}

It's a really great selection if you have younger kiddos who haven't quite developed their tastebuds to try new dishes outside of their comfort zone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-23", "description": "11/13/15:  This place has some really bad food and drinks, but mostly edible and unmemorable, and one spectacularly crazy good dish.  I can't say I enjoyed this place much, but if you pick the right food and drinks it'll be alright.  And despite the really fancy and trendy atmosphere, the prices are relatively reasonable, so at least you aren't getting raped money-wise.\n\nSo, here are my notes:\n\nfrom The Restaurant:\n\n1. Lava Guava $13: Very colorful.  Cannot remember details, but it was balanced in sweetness, tartness, and kick.  6/10.\n\n2. Lychee Martini $13:  A very nice lychee martini.  Good lychee taste, but clearly still a martini.  The folower was a really nice touch.  8/10.\n\n3. Frog Legs $12.95:  Damn, must be some of the skimpyest frog legs I've ever had anywhere.  Looks like they picked us the runt from the swamp or something--almost no meat at all.  Just bite after bite of bones.  Total waste of $13.  1/10\n\n4. Herbal Chicken Wings $9:  I remember the wings themselves were okay, but the sauce was almost pure honey which was kinda strange.  Can you imagine dipping your wings in honey?--I just don't get the idea.  Anyway, didn't use much of the \"sauce\" and it was fine.  5/10.\n\n5. Kurobuta Pork Neck $19.95:  THIS is The Only thing this night I would say is positively extraordinary!!!  YOU MUST GET THIS if anything.  Trust me.  The meat is so amazingly tender and juicy.  And the flavoring is spicy and intense.  AMAZING MEAT.  This plate alone is worth coming here--get yourself a drink, skip everything else, and buy TWO of these!  10/10\n\n6. Papaya Salad $10.95:  Sorry, do not remember anything about this.\n\n7. Lamb & Chicken Satay $13.95:  It was okay.  Don't remember specifics, but it wasn't anything memorable either good or bad.  5/10.\n\nfrom The Lounge:\n\n8. Berri Acai Mule Happy Hour $7:  So, the drinks from the restaurant were pretty good so I was looking forward to more.  Well, my gf got this and I can't really remember the details except it sucked.  Not spit-out-right-away horrible, but that you wouldn't want to buy this given the choice.  3/10.\n\n9. Slyx Silken $12:  Same deal as the mule--can't remember anything except you don't want this.  3/10.\n\nSo I dunno what the deal is, but at least from what I've tried the lounge-specific happy hour drinks are quite bad.  Order from the restaurant's drink menu if you can.\n\nHopefully this helps you out a bit in navigating their dangerous maze of edible traps and gets you through the night relatively pleasantly.

My company ordered food from them the same day my friend coincidentally wanted to get lunch with me here. Since my company already purchased my meal, I didn't want to let it go to waste or just leave the meal at work to then repurchase the same meal at the restaurant. So I went to the restaurant to meet my friend. I explained the situation to the waiter and asked if it would be ok if I ate my meal FROM THEIR RESTAURANT at their restaurant. My friend was purchasing his food, and my food had been purchased as well, just not right that second. The server said yes, in fact he would put it on a plate for me. So he took my meal and then came back and apologized that he could not do this since it came from outside. I shrugged and said that's fine, I will plate it myself. So me and my friend are in the middle of our meals, and a different server comes up and admonishes me and tells me they don't allow this. I show her the packaging, how it's labeled from their restaurant. Like they made me this meal. Yes it left the building, but why does it matter??? She argued with me a bit, then tried to say it might be from a different Osha Thai. Why does it matter at this point? You already told me it's okay, but now that we are halfway through our meal you're going to interrupt us and say never mind you changed your mind? Then she backtracked and said they would allow it this one time. Jeez thanks for going so out of your way for me. The whole thing just struck me as so rude. If it had been an issue we would have ordered my friend's meal to go and eaten outside, but they originally said it was fine so this just felt like a really crummy way to treat your customers.

It's located in a very touristy area of San Francisco (right next to the Embarcadero, across from the water). My friends and I were here on a Friday night and there was a lot of available seating, which was sort of surprising since other nearby restaurants would likely required at least an hour's wait. However, even with the surplus of seating, my friend and I had to wait until our entire party was here in order to get a table.\n\nSo we waited at the bar area and ordered some drinks. There is a nice bar area with comfortable stools. There is a tropical cocktail menu, with a lot of island-inspired fruit flavors. I got the Thailander, which basically tasted like a delicious fruit smoothie. Ours drinks also came with a small complimentary bowl of peanuts, which were very well-seasoned. The drink prices are very standard for SF ($10-15 range).\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the pad see you, which had a generous portion. That said, the meat to noodles ratio seemed off--there was a lot of chicken, but not a lot of noodles, which is probably good for the meat lover. However, the issue was that the dish just tasted very greasy and needed more noodles to offset the greasiness. The broccoli was crunchy and didn't have much flavor. The bright side is that the food was extremely affordable for San Francisco standards--$13 for the pad see you. The service was pretty solid; our waitress kept refilling our water glasses.\n\nSo if you're looking for an affordable  restaurant near a BART station (it's a 5 minute walk from the Embarcadero stop) and in San Francisco, Osha Thai is not a bad option.", "author": "Marcy S."}

We had the \"crying tiger\", which was very enjoyable, the steak was super tender, the sticky rice was a nice accompaniment. The papaya salad was SPICY, I like spicy food and it had a kick I tell you. After a few bites, I know I got my ass kicked. The Angry prawns was very tasty. And we ended the meal with a classic, mango with sticky rice, it was awesome. The $$ is pretty reasonable.", "author": "Brian W."}

They printed his name on the menu with a \"Happy Birthday!!\" so that was a sweet touch. \n\nService: Will Kang has the best customer service, i made so many changes the week of the reservation and he was completely happy to accomadate, he responded to emails in just a few miniutes and he was there during the dinner to explain what each dish was.

It would be nice if having a reservation earned a patron a slightly more friendly reception!\n\nBut that was our only hiccup as the rest of the evening was delightful! My Thailander cocktail was just as beautiful and tasty as the description implied, lusciously fruity and that bartender sure don't mess around - yeehaw!

As for our entrees, I received a tasty dose of humility - I ordered up their yellow curry with chicken (which tends to be my default at a new Thai joint) requesting mild spiciness, while my friend went with the crab fried rice. I thought that was a rather underwhelming selection! Little did I know, when both dishes were set before us and we piled up our plates - that crab fried rice was without question the very best fried rice I have ever had!

We headed straight into the lounge since they're only opened at night and it's way cozier there to chat and catch up. \n\nI love this lounge and location for all the reasons that it's next to bart and it's legit AF. I mean, authentic decorations that adorn the entire lounge, the hallway to the lounge and every inch of the inside. Heading into the lounge, there's a huge private room for parties that is just the most breath taking view. It's absolutely beautiful inside here. \n\nAside from the decor, the lounge itself is a wonderful place to chill and catch up at. I mean, the seating especially makes you feel like you're a queen or king here! You have to see it to believe it. It's pretty dark inside, but spotlights help you see what you're eating. It's a full bar with your favorite top shelf selections. There's a variety of speciality cocktails, as well. \n\nYou have options of the \"very\" happy hour/lounge menu as well as the full menu that they offer at Osha right next door. Very happy hours are mon&tues from 5-10pm. Wed-Fri from 5-9pm. \n\nI like a good mule and lucky me, that's exactly what they had. The Berri Acai Mule (7) sounded delicious, but they were out, so it was substituted for strawberry instead. It was super refreshing with strong hints of ginger beer. This doesn't have a kick, so it's basically like drinking strawberry ginger ale! \n\nThai tapas all around for everything at the table. Everything was presented so pretty and though the portions looked small, it was more than filling! Chieng-Mai Lettuce Wrap (7) was spicy and the menu didn't state it! I should of known better and asked, but nevertheless, the chicken was flavorful and they only used the baby hearts of artisan romaine lettuce for your wrap. We also had some truffle salt french fries (6) fried to perfection with a great crunch. \n\nGreat spot for happy hour- with late happy hours! Everybody wants to just lounge there forever since it's so cozy and comfortable there. The wait staff were professional and accommodating.

We saw how nice and lively the place was an figured we give it a try.\n\nIt was quite crowded and noisy, not bad at all just a bit uncomfortable because I could hear the conversations taking place next to me since they had sat us along the wall with these disjointed two-person tables. Not ideal for an intimate dinner.\n\nWe ordered a bowl of Tom Kha, and veggie spring rolls to start with. Both devoured quickly by the two of us. Then we split the tofu pad thai and the pineapple fried rice. Presentation is everything here. While it is very clean, organized and appealing here, I do not see myself coming back. This establishment is very much catered to the surrounding businesses, no doubt. The ambiance and artwork provide many conversation starters and seating does not provide too much intimacy or privacy, nothing meant for personal relation type outings, I suppose.

I have to say, I prefer the lounge. It's a little more casual and fun. Though if I'm in the mood for a real sit down dinner, I'd rather be in the main dining area. The private rooms are fun too. The first time I came here in 2009, it was for a huge birthday dinner. I know there was a minimum we had to make, so everyone individually ordered and paid for drinks at the bar. Luckily everything counted towards our min. In the end, we all shared the cost of our meal and it was around $45 each. Not bad for a private room.\n\nIn the past couple of years, I've just randomly dropped by Osha's lounge if I'm in the area.

If you ask them to make any of their curries as vegetarian, they are happy to oblige. This location is growing on me and I have to admit I'm a fan of the clean, sleek Asian bistro type decor. Very cordial service and slightly more upscale in atmosphere, without outrageous upscale prices.\n\nMy faves on the menu include the Tom Yum soup, tofu salad, fresh veggie rolls and their yellow curry with veggies. Good quality and freshness. On a chilly day their soup and curries hit the spot. I've gotten over the fact they don't offer a lunch special and just enjoy this location for the wonderfulness it is.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

Yes, their decor and the atmosphere is rad as hell but dang, I wouldn't wanna pay $15 for an entree of meh tasting crab fried rice. I've had better...like Chaaba on Irving street.\n\nTheir waiters/waitresses are attentive but the food quality isn't amazing for the price you pay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-07", "description": "Of the three Osha Thai locations that I've been to, I tend to gravitate towards this one the most.  Admittedly though, that's somewhat by default since I can never find parking by the one on Geary and the service at the one on Second St. was downright awful the last time I was there (no, don't remember to bring out my dish on time, but please, do try to take it away while I'm still eating).\n\nIf you've been to any Osha Thai (save for the one on Geary, which is more of a noodle joint), the menu here is identical, with a lot of appetizers/small plates, curries, soups, noodles, rice plates, and entrees (meat/seafood/vegetarian) to choose from.  While some of the dishes I've tried are fairly creative, plated well, and taste pretty decent, most of what I've had hasn't been very overwhelming:\n\n-- KUROBUTA PORK BELLY - Slow Braised Kurobuta (Black Hog) served with Secret Five Spice Reduction and Flower Sticky Rice...$20\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/osha-thai-san-francisco-3?select=P5fToGteNL1Vx5LnLLHDGA#c2gyQsLCVivPZMdQSug8WQ)\nPretty solid dish, and one of the best one I've had here.  The portion is a little light for the money, but it's both tender and tasty (the five spice added a nice layer of flavor).  Don't overlook the rice though; loved the chewy, coconut flavor!\n\n-- GREEN CURRY PAN FRIED Spaghetti Stir-Fried with Chicken, String Beans, Bamboo Shoots, Basil, Bell Pepper, and Chili with Green Curry...$12\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/osha-thai-san-francisco-3?select=P5fToGteNL1Vx5LnLLHDGA#_sl9W-lGsrxliO_OxccXRQ)\nIt tasted fine, but the curry was really thin and could have packed a bigger punch.  Plus, the chicken was pretty dry.  At least the vegetables were pretty fresh, though I think rice/stick noodles would have been better than spaghetti (so random).\n\n-- VOLCANIC BEEF - Wok-Fried Grilled Premium Flank Steak with Basil and \nBlack Pepper served with Onion Rings in Lava Sauce...$18\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/osha-thai-san-francisco-3?select=P5fToGteNL1Vx5LnLLHDGA#cmqTrHGE8IBMT3nYQQtFng)\nIt may be one of their more popular dishes, but each time I try it, I'm less and less impressed.  Most recently, not only were the onion rings cold and unappetizing, but a few pieces of the beef was less than \"premium\" (super tough and dry).\n\nAmong the other dishes I've tried over the years, I've also had the Angel Wings, Pad See Ew, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry Chicken, Pumpkin Curry, and Ka Prow Kai (stir fried ground chicken) with mixed results.  The latter two are both solid dishes that I would get again, but you can easily find better versions of the rest.\n\nPerhaps it's because I've started to take them for granted after all this time, but it's unfortunate that Osha Thai doesn't seem as impressive as they did after my first trip here.  However, I do appreciate how consistent they are with their food, as well as how parking is relatively easy and that they have a lounge and outdoor seating.\n\nTHREE AND A HALF STARS rounded down due to the wealth of average to mediocre dishes.", "author": "Mike L."}

Well considering all those stupid SF mandates (Hello, we have Obamacare, why are we still funding that slush fund known as Healthy SF?) and the high commercial rents, I was willing to give them a pass due to the prices.

A lot of the reviews are just decent, but for a party of 8 it was good. We made reservation for late afternoon, but ended up arriving a whole hour earlier and we were hungry, so we called to see if we could come in earlier instead and they were cool with it. The food came out pretty quick, we were all able to eat around the same time, and I think everyone enjoyed their meal for the most part. I really enjoyed my lychee iced tea because it was freshing and the lychee flavor was there. The service wasn't bad at all and everything went smoothly.

I swear this place used to be $2-3 cheaper a few months ago. Even Thai food is getting increased with cost of living these days! That being said, this solid 4 star establishment is more of a 3.5 star after the price bumps. Let me explain:\n\nThe reasonable:\n+ Dining experience: Well decorated and fancy-ish. I recommend this as a great \"first date\" place since there's a nice ambiance at a decent price. \n+ Full bar: I love places with full bars! HH specials include $3 beers and $4 shots. I haven't tested the bartenders here with any complicated cocktails but they can definitely make anything off the cocktail menu. \n+ Decent food: The food quality is pretty high. I really like the Pad See Ew, Pineapple Fried Rice, and the Green Curry.\n+ Location: The restaurant is conveniently located in Embarcadero 4, near the Hyatt and the Ferry Building. Perfect location to grab coffee or go for a walk after lunch / dinner.\n+ Hours: Open fairly late (10:00pm) for those young professionals (like myself) that need to order dinner when working late. \n\nThe less reasonable:\n- NO RESERVATIONS (during lunch hours): No reservations between Noon and .. 1:30(?) which makes it difficult to arrange a large lunch here. Usually, I just schedule the lunch for 11:30-11:45am which does offer a reservation. Your whole party must be present to be seated.\n- Credit Card Limit: 4 cards per bill. This is where Venmo comes in handy. \n- Hit and Miss Service: I've come here with a party of 15 and got in and out in less than an hour while other times, I come with a party of 4 and the lunch can be up to 2 hours. The servers are all really nice but not that attentive. I'd suggest blocking off a couple hours just to be safe if you're coming for lunch.\n\nThis place is a 3.5 star restaurant but it gets the bump since they're a family owned and operated business. That's becoming more rare these days.", "author": "Chris W."}

I know Thai food is supposed to be sweet, and me, am a huge Thai food lover (I'm half Thai myself and have been to Thailand several times), but this was just too sweet. The 5 Spice pork noodle soup didn't have many noodles and I felt like I was drinking sugar water because the soup was so sweet. It didn't have much depth in the flavor, or maybe it did, but the sweetness was too overpowering. The first several bites were delicious but after a while, the sugar made me feel sick. Same with the Thai iced tea. For appetizers, I got the calamari and the vegetable spring rolls. The calamari had a lot of sticky sweet sauce that had a strong mayonnaise flavor, which I'm not sure if I liked or not. The spring rolls on the other hand were quite good. Now, being done with the meal, I feel like I just drank a gallon of syrup.

I was carrying my daughter and tried to walk in to meet a friend who had a table and was waiting for us. The host and waiter came up to me right away and said sorry you cant use the restroom. I told them I'm not using the restroom and my friend is right there so i am going to sit with her. He cut me off and said i couldn't come in, stuck his arms out and blocked me from walking to her. I kept trying to explain to him that my friend already had a table but he just kept cutting me off while i was speaking. Even if i did wanted to use the restroom who the fuck denies a mother and their child especially if I'm carrying her. My friend finally waved me down and his dumb ass finally realized that i was meeting her and took his hands down from blocking me so i can walk to her. He then apologized but i was not having it so after my friend finished her cocktail, i made her leave.

The portions are good and the pieces of meat, vegetables and tofu are always a good size. We thoroughly enjoy everything they offer whether eating there or getting take out. The only issue we have with the food is their inconsistent spicy level. If you request for mild, it might be too spicy. If you request for spicy, sometimes it's perfect while other times it's mild or overly spicy but we sweat through it because those that like spicy really don't mind it. Despite this spice level issue, everyone in the office gets excited when we order from here because it's a treat to eat expensive yummy Thai food. The prices are pretty high but it's to be expected for an ornately decorated restaurant on the Embarcadero who also plates their food with orchids and banana leaves.

It's really nice inside and a good spot to celebrate a special occasion or just to get a nice dinner. The prices are a little bit higher than your usual Thai restaurant but I think it's worth it. I wasn't super blown away with the food, but there was one dish that stood out to me that I LOVED-- the crab fried rice! I would say that was my favorite dish out of all the ones we tried and I highly recommend it. We also got the vegetarian Pad Thai and Thai Spicy Pan Fried with chicken. The Pad Thai was really sweet and needed some vinegar and chilli sauce to help out the flavor of the dish. The portion was also a little small compared to the other dishes we got, which was kind of odd. The plus was that it came with a good amount of vegetables. The pan fried chicken was quite tasty and is another dish I'd recommend as well. You can say our experience with the food was a mix of hits and misses.\n\nIn terms of service-- we were here celebrating my mom's birthday and they had nothing complimentary for birthdays which was a bit surprising (especially for being a \"nicer\" establishment). Oh well, complimentary dessert isn't expected but I found our waiter a little rude when I just inquired if they did anything for birthdays. On top of that, service was a bit slow and we found ourselves having to always flag someone down for attention instead of having our server check in on us every now and then. Had to knock a star down for not so great service.\n\nBesides the service, I think this is a good spot on the Embarcadero to get a decent meal; if anything, you'll enjoy the decor and have a nice area outside to walk around after your meal.", "author": "Renu A."}

It seemed like a popular place since many of the tables were reserved at opening. We were lucky to grab a free table for 2. The place is dimly lit with large velvet red chairs and golden tables. Quite palatial compared to the other places I've been. \n\nWonderful happy hour drinks. I ordered the Singha beer which was $3 and it came with a large bowl of roasted peanuts. My friend ordered a cocktail and it was sweet and strong. We will definitely return again for drinks. \n\nWe were about to order some food off the happy hour menu, but the table next to us beat us to it. So we decided to wait to see what the food was like, and I'm glad we didn't go through with it. Each dish was tiny, smaller than typical appetizer portions. We weighed our options and decided that we were better off ordering more drinks instead of spending the same amount for a tiny smidgen of food. \n\nThe service is fantastic; our server checked on us multiple times and made sure we were doing alright.

I have known Osha to be pretty popular so I was expected a wait when I first arrived.However, it was not very busy and we were seated right away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-22", "description": "I've been to several of the Osha Thai restaurants, and every single one of them has their own unique flare in decor.  That's probably my favorite part.  This particular Osha Thai sits conveniently along the Justin Herman Plaza in the Embarcadero, so I would highly recommend taking a nice little stroll around the Ferry Building after your meal (especially if you go at night - everything's all lit up, and the Bay Bridge is definitely a beautiful sight to see if you're not from the area).  In addition, to my experience, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get seated here.    \n\nUnfortunately, I have mixed feelings about the food.  Here's the break down on what I've tried...\n\nAPPETIZERS\n\nBeef Wasabi Rolls (Carrot, celery and mint wrapped in sliced grilled premium flank steak served with watercress salad)\n- Quite flavorful, but the portions are extremely small (you get 5 pieces); the beef is some times a bit chewier than expected.. inconsistent\n\nSOUP\n\nTom Kha(Spicy coconut soup with lemon grass, galangal, Kaffir lime leaf and mushroom)\n- I really like this.. the spices, the lemongrass, the mushrooms.  My only suggestion, ask if you can have it without the meat options.  The chicken is always super dry, the shrimp kind of taste like rubber, and the mixed seafood is pretty unflavorful too - tastes like it's been frozen and defrosted several times)\n\nLAND\n\nVolcanic Beef (Wok-fried grilled premium flank steak with basil and black pepperin Lava sauce garnished with onion rings)\n- This is probably one of my favorite dishes.  The presentation looks amazing.  The beef is tender, juicy, and packed with flavor.  Definitely a must try.\n \nDuck Curry - I'm not sure what was in this, but it was my favorite dish that time around.  Once again, it was packed with flavor.  I loved the sauce.. it was just perfect with rice.\n\nSEA\n\nLemongrass Sea Bass (Steamed marinated sea bass with lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf topped with fried lemongrass served in a clay pot)\n- This was very mediocre.  I was just tempted because it's served in a clay pot.. nothing special.\n\nHeavenly Halibut (Fillet halibut filet steamed Asian style in spicy garlic lime dressing, Lemongrass and basil served with mushroom and spring cabbage)\n- I usually love halibut, but this dish was a bit too bland for me.  It honestly just tasted like fish with some lime juice on it... ehh.. I'll have to think twice before I order it again.\n\nEmerald Snapper (new item on the menu)\n- I liked the sauce, but I wish there was more of the fish.  Two tiny little pieces... and tons of eggplant... ehh..\n\nCrisp Salmon (Crispy salmon topped with dry fried mango, pineapple, onion red bell pepper, yam and crispy Thai basil)\n- Yeah, no thanks.  The salmon was really dry and the sauce just didn't mesh well with the dish.  Will not be getting this one again.\n\nFRIED RICE\n\nPineapple Fried Rice \nFried rice with egg, tomato, onion, green onion, cashew, raisins, pineapple, chicken and prawns\n- Good, but I think it was a little too salty.  Again, inconsistent.\n\nCrab Fried Rice  (Fried rice with egg, onion and green onion with fresh crab meat served with fresh cucumber)\n- Another must try!  \n\nOverall, the food here is mediocre.  It's pretty inconsistent in terms of tastes - could be really salty one time and perfect the next.  Prices can also be on the heftier side... essentially, you're paying for the atmosphere and location.\n\nService was nice and attentive... no complaints there.\n\n\"Osha Thai is like the Thai version of \"PF CHANGS\" China Bistro.\" - SO TRUE!", "author": "Cecilia S."}

The rice paper is best when thin IMO and I think there was shrimp in there but I couldn't taste it. Maybe I'm just spoiled by Vietnamese fresh rolls?\n\n-Their version of Drunken Noodle.

The dishes often come either TOO salty or TOO sweet. Nothing is consistent. One time I loved my pad thai, the next I wanted to drown it and myself in hot sauce and soy sauce. The food is also horrendously overpriced given the quality - they do give you a lot, but when you don't want to eat it, what's the point? \n\nThe cocktails are $10 - and lately they've gotten weaker and weaker just full of fluff mixers. They do still get points for creativity. \n\nservice: (3/5) - the staff is okay -  nothing special. \n\nAccessibility: (4/5): Osha's always been that place you go to on a saturday night when you realize you don't have a reservation anywhere else and don't want to wait in line for 1-2 hours somewhere else better. This is the place's saving grace - ease.  You can always find some sort of street parking behind the restaurant or even on the embarcadero and there's also a parking structure. \n\nVerdict: I think with each visit, I fall out of love with OSHA Thai. The food has gotten less and less tasty, which makes the amount you pay for it not worth it. I've gone to the point where I'd rather just eat frozen pad thai from safeway.", "author": "Christine B."}

I made the reservation for a large party very last minute, and the people I talked to on the phone were very nice and helpful. When we were greeted at the restaurant they were just as nice, so I was really excited! our server was a joke. We sat down and he didn't come greet us for 20 minutes. No waters. We told him we didn't want to order until the last person in ur party was there, yet he continually was rushing us and asking us to order even though we clearly were still missing a person. When she did come, he passed by our table many times without checking on us. He was chatting with the hostess right behind our table instead of actually being attentive so I had to get his attention to come get our order. Our food came out about 2 dishes at a time, at least 5 minutes apart. That's so awkward and unprofessional in a large party. But wait! It gets better! My sister surprised me with a birthday cake and he brought it out, but he didn't light the candles before coming out. Then, everybody was done singing, but he could only light two candles. He kept telling them to stop singing. Just created a really awkward moment during something thats supposed to be special. He didn't bring out the correct number of plates and spoons. I was so disappointed in our service, and so pissed we still had to tip him due to automatic gratuity. The food is fantastic, but our server ruined the experience.", "author": "Sarah K."}

They wouldn't seat us without everyone in the party present even after we offered to preorder ahead of time for our friend who was late.\n\nThey seated us in a back room of the lounge where we had to go outside into another building and where there were less than 3 servers for 30+ people. On top of that, our table was sticky and we weren't given water even after asking several times. We ordered, and we were finished eating before one of my friends entrees came out. We waited awkwardly for another 10 minutes after and then asked a server (after multiple attempts to flag one down) what was going on. This seemed to be a common occurrence as I saw partial tables with doggie bags while their colleagues were still eating.\n\nAfter being given the runaround for over an hour after ordering from multiple staff who avoided contact, they apologized and said they had forgotten to put the order in. They removed the entree from the bill and comp'd us an appetizer of rice noodles in rice paper with lettuce. This appetizer of rice and sauce with leaves was terrible and cheap and the entree still came out even later. \n\nWhen it was time to pay for the bill, it took over 10 minutes to flag someone down to ask them to bring the check.

But next year I will be consulting this review while I look over the menu. Now you know my secret. These reviews aren't for you; they're for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-01", "description": "My FAVORITE Osha Thai location (\"IF\" I had to choose)!\n\nI'm not keen on chain restaurants or on Americanized Asian \"Foo Foo\" cuisine b/c I believe the best and most authentic Asian eats can be found at Mom and Pop type places. With that being said, The Osha Chain is more about the shee shee ambiance and is a place I would bring people to introduce them to Thai Cuisine. \n\nThe Embarcadero location is my favorite among the OSHAs (the worst is the Geary location--the food is inconsistent and terrible quality) b/c of its picturesque location across the Ferry Building. It also has several private rooms which makes it perfect for large parties and a back lounge which is a good place to kick back w/ some drinks (Fyi, drinks are STRONG! My Sat night was a blur thanks to just 1 AMF).\n\nOn Sat, 2/26/11, my friend was having her Birthday Bash upstairs at Sens, so I suggested that we come here beforehand for her birthday dinner since it can easily accommodate large parties. She made reservations 1 wk prior which required her to come in and fill-out paperwork (WTF?) and put a $10 deposit per person. I've never heard of such a thing and I find that rather a huge inconvenience. Seriously, who would require such a thing?!?!?! But I digress...\n\nOur party trickled in at 7 PM for our 6:30 PM reservations b/c of parking difficulties. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated. This was my 5th time dining at this Osha location. I've tried various dishes and below are my FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS.  \n\nA P P E T I Z E R S: \nAVOID any of the sashimi type apps like the Tuna Tower ($12) and Salmon Sashimi Salad ($12). The fish doesn't seem to be fresh as it has a slimy texture. Stick w/ the Fried Apps!\n\n*Thai Samosa ($8), Crunchy Calamari ($10) and Fish Cakes ($8) have always been solid; served fresh-out-of-the fryer, crisp, and fresh. The accompanying sweet thai chili sauce has the perfect balance of salty, sweet, and spicy.\n\n*Lamb & Chicken Satay ($12) is also a good option. The lamb and chicken is perfectly grilled, tender and juicy. The accompanying peanut sauce is savory, sweet, spicy and adds a decadent nutty creaminess.\n\nE N T R E E S: \nAVOID any of the fish dishes like the Ying Yang Seabass ($24) and Grilled Seabass ($24). Although the fish is cooked properly (tender and flakey), the accompanying sauces (i.e. curries, sweet hot mustard) are so overpowering that it drowns out the delicate flavor of the fish. \n\n*VOLCANIC BEEF ($18): This is MY GO-TO dish! The beef is wok seared to a medium well and is tender and juicy. The basil and pepper sauce is the perfect blend of sweet and savory w/ just the right amount of kick. The onion rings are fried to a light golden brown. They add a nice crispy texture contrast to the beef and an additional layer of sweetness. I highly recommend ordering the Coconut Rice for an extra $2 as a subtle nuttiness and exoticness to the dish.\n\nThis past Saturday, I wanted to change it up a bit and ordered the HONEY DUCK ($18) w/ Coconut Rice (+$2). The duck was what you would find at a Chinese BBQ Restaurant sans the bones. The sliced duck was slathered w/ a honey glaze and then laid on top of bok choy. It was also served w/ a boiled egg and a black soy sauce. \n\nAlthough I only ate half the dish, I was pleasantly surprised at how well the duck was prepared (assuming they just didn't buy it at a nearby Chinese restaurant). Duck can be very fatty but the cuts of duck served were lean and tender w/ a thin, crispy skin. There was also fried duck skins similar to chicharrones which were rich, crunchy, and addicting. The thick honey glaze overpowered the already well-seasoned and flavorful duck. It had a very viscous consistency and added too much sweetness to the duck. I would have preferred if the honey glaze had been provided on the side so I can control the sweetness. The boiled bok choy was overcooked and limp and the accompanying black soy sauce was unnecessary since there was already honey glaze sauce from the duck.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nFast and friendly, but not very attentive. Water glasses are refilled, however, if you need something you will have to flag down a member of the wait staff.\n\nOSHA is an ideal place for large parties esp if you're on a time-crunch. The kitchen cranks out dishes quickly, so your large party can have an enjoyable dinner w/in 1.5 hrs.  \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nDark, contemporary and sexy accented w/ Thai Gold Shrines and fresh flowers. This Osha offers outside patio dining (perfect on a warm evening), a main dining room and private rooms.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nDifficult street parking. A parking garage is located across the street at Embarcadero 3 (closes at Midnight). Weeknight/Weekend rates are $3 for the 1st hour and $3 for each add'l hour. \n\nAs much as I am a twinkie, I'm a total FOB when it comes to eating, so Osha and King of Thai just don't do it for me.

It's in the Embaradero Shopping Center which is right across from the Bay Bridge. After dinner it's nice to take a walk around and now that it's holiday season they put up the ice skating rink right outside. Parking isn't too bad either since we came on a weeknight.\n\nService: The servers were very attentive - almost TOO attentive since me and my friends were busy catching up and the waitress kept popping up several times before we were ready to order. She made a few suggestions when we had questions and I felt like she didn't steer us wrong so that was a nice touch. \nI just wanna throw in we tried to get several of the staff to help us take pictures of us but they all came out weird because of the lighting or angle. So while the staff is nice... they're not the best photographers LOL.\nWe stayed there for 2 and a half hours just catching up and never felt rushed and the servers always kept our water glasses filled.\n\nThe food is decently priced considering the quality, taste and decor of the restaurant but I was surprised that the portions have gotten smaller over the last few years.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-03", "description": "My boyfriend and I decided to eat dinner here last night after skating at the holiday Embarcadero ice rink since they were one of the few places still open. Osha is very nicely decorated, but the tables are so crowded and the atmosphere was so noisy even though the restaurant was barely half full. We were originally seated between two other couples with barely 6 inches of space on either side, so I asked to be moved. (I've worked in restaurants before, specifically Thai restaurants, and it's not proper to seat guests in the most crowded area of the restaurant when there are less crowded areas available. And no, those tables were not reserved; we made it in just before the stopped seating for the evening.)\n\nOur server moved us to the back near the restrooms. To our right was a very noisy couple and to our left was some sort of weird buzz/hum that was coming from the bathrooms. This for me was an issue since I'm hearing impaired. The table was far enough across so that I could hardly hear my boyfriend, but all of the restaurant noise on top of that made any sort of conversation impossible. He had to text me from across the table just so I could understand what he was saying!! Fortunately, some tables cleared up, and the couple next to us requested to be moved. I also asked to be moved, but the server told me that they had \"closed that section for the night\". There were other tables available in the open section, but I didn't want to ruin my good evening by being a fussy customer, so I didn't say anything. \n\nAfter about ten minutes, someone came by to take our order. I ordered the lychee iced tea, dungeness crab rangoons, and yellow chicken curry. (Call me biased, but I always judge a Thai restaurant by their curry and rangoons. It's probably because they've been my favorite Thai dishes since I was a child, but also because they're both so simple.) My boyfriend ordered Thai tea and kra pow chicken. Our drinks and appetizer arrived within the next ten minutes, and our entrees within the next ten minutes of us finishing the rangoons. (I saw a lot of reviews complaining of slow service, which I thankfully did not experience since we went at a slower time, but I wholly believe their service can be slow during peak hours. There didn't seem to be enough servers for a restaurant that big.) Someone came by while we were eating and asked us if we'd be wanting anything else since the kitchen was closing up for the night, so I asked for a dessert menu, which contained all of the typical Thai desserts. Fried ice cream, fried banana, black sticky rice with custard, and mango sticky rice. They also had some less conventional desserts, but we decided to go with the mango sticky rice, which was one of the least expensive desserts at $9. The service up until this point had been pretty decent, but we didn't get our check until about 10 minutes after we had finished eating dessert. Not a big deal, they ran our credit card pretty quickly and we were out the door, but it was the one slow point of service I noted throughout the night. \n\nSpecifics about the food:\n*Lychee iced tea: something I've never seen before, but it was absolutely refreshing and delicious. I probably won't be returning to Osha ever again, but if I do, I'm definitely ordering it again.\n*Thai iced tea: better than most places, but not the best I've had. \n*Dungeness crab rangoons: the insides were very good due to the fact that they use real crab whilst most Thai restaurants use imitation crabmeat, but there was something about the shell that was just... wrong. They didn't have the typical fried wonton wrappers, but instead something much thicker and more cracker-like. I didn't like it. My boyfriend told me that I make better crab rangoons at home with sticks of frozen imitation crabmeat and Philly cream cheese. \n*Yellow chicken curry: very standard and run-of-the-mill curry with chicken, onions, and potatoes. There was also a couple pieces of red bell pepper thrown in there, but I don't care for bell peppers, so I just put them aside. My boyfriend makes better yellow curry, and he's a white guy who googled the recipe. (Not to patronize his curry or anything, it's actually really good.)\n*Ka pow kai- pretty basic basil chicken. It's not a dish I eat often, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it and has asked my mom for her recipe. We'll see how his version turns out, haha. \n*Mango sticky rice: very good. The rice was warm and the mango was cold, just how it should be. Presentation was also quite pretty and came with a cute little mint leaf and raspberry garnish, but the portion was incredibly small. \n\nOverall, Osha is pretty neat, but there is just NO WAY that meal was worth the $70 we paid for it. Sure, the food was pretty good, but the extremely noisy and very dark atmosphere combined with the fact that I've had much better Thai food for a much better price means we won't be returning. I could have made the same dinner at home for less than $30.", "author": "Joanna M."}

Osha Thai has a diversity of Thai delicacies and dishes that are well executed! The presentation of the food is not only very appealing, but the food tastes even better! They combine different chilis, spices, sauces, and unique flavors which burst in your mouth. Osha Thai's food excites your palette, satisfies your tastes buds, and fills your stomach!

But every time I go back, my overall experience is less and less fulfilling.  The prices have gone up and it is now in \"rip off\" territory.  Most of the apps are over $10 a fair number of the dishes are over $30.  All of that wouldn't be an issue if the food was good, but it's not.  \n\nI had the Pad Se Ew, which was.....well, ewe.  Mostly noodles and very little accoutrements for $14.  My friend had the chicken wings which she said were overfried and meatless (which is great for a vegetarian but tragic when you're eating something that has been murdered for you but there's nothing to eat).  She also had the salmon, which was left mostly uneaten.  Overall, the food was not bad; it just was not that good.  At least the service and drinks were on point.\n\nAstonishingly, the place was packed with people who (1) do not know what good Thai food tastes like, (2) don't care about value, (3) are desperate for Thai food in the financial district, or (4) just want clean place to eat with OK but overpriced food....or some combination thereof.  If you do not fit into any these categories, there's not much reason to go here.  \n\nNote: There are two sides to the restaurant:  the main dining room and an adjoining bar area.

Last Thursday, my girlfriend and I as well as two of our friends had dinner at Osha. The restaurant aims to take traditional Thai dishes and to elevate them by using quality ingredients or in some cases, to put their own spin on them. In my opinion, they missed the mark.\n\nOsha is very impressive when you walk into it. The interior is expansive and elegant. However, the tables are too large. It was a struggle to talk my friends, because they were sitting so far away, and the restaurant was pretty noisy (probably from other people who were forced to shout to be heard). \n\nThe servers were friendly, but not very attentive. We waited quite a while before they even came to take our drink orders. We also had long waits in between courses. I expected better service considering the price and the decor of the restaurant.\n\nFor an appetizers, my girlfriend and I shared the Thai Samosas. They were good, but could have benefited from having a sauce to dip them in. There was also a \"fresh cucumber salad\" which was really just some chopped cucumbers and carrots that did not taste like they were seasoned in any way. It was basically like they just tossed some raw vegetables on the side. \n\nFor my main dish, I had the Bo.Lan Lamb. The lamb (which was cubed and cooked in a wok) was served in a \"Jungle\" style sauce with a fried egg on top. The lamb was well-cooked, and the sauce tasted great. It had just the right amount of spice to it. The fried egg was good too, although I felt like it didn't really go with the lamb. A bite containing a little of each wasn't as good as a bite of each one separately. Maybe they should have used a poached egg if they were wanting the yolk to spill out of the egg and mix with the lamb.\n\nThe food was a bit pricy for what it was. \n\nOverall, we weren't impressed.

We had about 90 people and fit into the space perfectly-- not too squished in there, but no awkward empty space either (standing reception style). The food was delicious (yummy appetizers that were easy to eat while standing) and enough to feed everyone a light dinner (or more if you were really hungry). Beer & wine came included in the package. Price is very reasonable for a private space. Our event planner, Will, was SO easy to work with, very friendly, and knew what he was doing. Our party was only booked for 2 hours, but we had a lot of people still hanging out. In the future, I would book a longer time period if possible and grant clearer access to the bar for those who wanted mixed drinks. \n\nOverall, great experience.", "author": "Amanda S."}

There's a bar area where my friend and I sat, fast service and fast drinks. \n\nThai Iced Coffee for a whopping $4: It was so good and very sweet, however I think the sugar overpowered the caffeine, so I ended up crashing after leaving the restaurant! It was so bad I had to sit down, food coma mixed with sugar overload? Not a good combo!\n\nSpicy Thai Noodle (which is essentially Pad Kee Mao) for $11: I always order this at Thai restaurants. I asked for spicy and it turned out just mild, sadly. So I use the hot sauce tray they had and added more pickled jalapenos and red peppers. It was still mild! They should have pickled serrano peppers instead. I think the majority of the customers in this restaurants are working Americans (esp during lunch hours), so the spiciness have been dumbed down quite a bit. Plus  the noodles turned out okay, something was missing in it. It was very oily and I think I've had better noodles for just $8 or less at a less fancier Thai restaurant! I also didn't like the bamboo shoots in it, and I wish they added more bell peppers/serrano peppers. Overall, an okay meal. \n\nMost of the items on the menu are pricier in comparison to other Thai restaurants, and the taste is just okay. It's a great place to eat lunch during work hours, but I don't think I would go out of my way here to pay for a more expensive more Americanized Thai food. The inside decor was nice, and as I was walking out, I noticed there were more seating outside and inside! Big restaurant. The bathrooms were nice.", "author": "Rita K."}

Having worked in the SF FiDi for over the past 5 years, this location of Osha Thai is a popular choice for work gatherings and/or casual meet-up lunches.\n\nI have always been a fan, which is why it pains me so to have to jot down this review. It's been several months since I've dined here, and today decided to have a fun girls-only lunch with my coworkers. We walked in a little after 1:15PM on a Thursday and found the restaurant 80% empty as groups were wrapping up on lunch hour. We were promptly seated at a table for 4 near the bar area. \n\nImmediate observations:\n#1: What the heck happened to the prices?! We thought we were looking at their dinner menus for a second. They raised their prices across the board! $16-$20 for a Curry?! Same price range for an entree with rice?! RIDICULOUS. I wonder if they're trying to compete with the newcomer - Crystal Jade, who charges an arm and a leg for a piece of dim sum. Well, whatever the case, let me make a mental note of this and consider not coming here next time.\n\n#2: Service. What service?! We saw more wait staff re-arranging glassware and table clothes than we noticed who remotely seemed interested to help us. \n\nAlright, so we quickly decide on our orders and the server promptly walks away into the kitchen after taking our orders.\n\nFood came out relatively fast. Which I would expect for it being as empty as it was. We were famished and excited to dig in, but almost immediately one of the girls noticed after half a bite that her almost $20 chicken dish was COLD and the outside tasted like it had been sitting out on the kitchen counter for a while. We each took a piece from her plate and collectively agreed that the food tasted old and definitely not hot or fresh!! So we tracked down a server and asked if we can get a fresh order.\n\nSomeone came back and communicated that they would cook a new plate of the chicken dish and would take 5 minutes. Great, that was nicely appreciated.\n\nWhen the food came back, it looked like a completely different dish! The colors were lighter and definitely \"just cooked,\" which just confirmed how awful the previous plate really was. \n\nUnfortunately, service continued to suck throughout our meal. It would take a while to get our waters refilled. No one ever really checked back to see how we were doing. However, when we started to move a bit, signaling the end of our meal, a staff promptly dropped our bill on our table, placing it in front of the girl whose food was cold. Hello, rude!!? It kind of sucked that no one offered to comp her meal, or even offer a discount on anything!! There was no explanations and hardly an apology. We thought they could have done something to make up for their error.   \n\nAnyways, we left feeling very 'meh' and I don't know why our experience today sucked so much!! I would really hesitate to come back again. With the high prices I pay, I would expect impeccable and friendly service and great tasting food, and I felt Osha came very short on both ends today.", "author": "Jing D."}

I thought since it will be peak dinner hours on a Friday night, I'd make a reservation. I thought it was pretty darn convienent to make a reservation on their website. So my friends and I show up about 8 minutes early to our reservation and she said our table was not ready yet. I already had a bad feeling about this place when the lady said the table wasn't ready. I always thought that when you have a reservation there will be table waiting for you, but I guess not. Reserving online at this place will only put your name down ahead of time. \"When a table is ready, we will seat you first,\" is what the lady said. 4 stars for that. \n\nLooking at the menu, everything, including appetizers were pricy. The menu falls under the $11-30 range. I got the pad thai and my friend got the yellow curry. Each costs $14. It was my first time having pad thai and I liked it.  Both portions for these items were small at first glance. And they were. It looks like two handfuls of food. Like if you were to scoop up their pad thai with both of your hands, it will almost fill up. I was surprised that the pad thai filled me up even though I am a big eater. So 3 stars for that. \n\nThe service was better than average. Your water glass is never empty. They come along and ask if everything is okay. They ask for permission before taking anything anyway. BUT when you pay for your bill, it seems that all they care about is the tip, which is understandable. I've been a waitress for 6 years and I almost never cared about how much tip I will get at the end of someone's meal. We told our waiter \"Can we have change please?\" I know he understood that. Then he opens the bill to check it. Um, excuse me, if we ask for change, that means we paid cash and not card. He comes back a minute later and asked us \"You don't want change right?\" Come on man... I give them 3 stars for that. \n\nThe ambiance was really nice. It was one of those big, dim restaurants with fancy tables and chairs. My friends and I were seated near the window in this couch like area with pillows. This restaurant is big, which means a lot of people just bleeding out the door, which means the noise level is high enough that you can't even hear the person next to you. So I give them 3 stars for that. \n\nOverall, it's a good looking place to have dinner if you want to feel fancy. Not the best choice if you are super hungry and a big eater. If you have money to burn and you aren't the biggest eater, definitely go here. Would I go again? Giant maybe.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

Got the tuna appetizer which comes with chips and avocado and the fresh fish is always good for me. For my entree I got the volcanic beef. It was so delicious!

Since they both work in the area, they decided on this little spot and asked me to meet them there. Since I no longer live in the City, I decided to make use of BART from the East Bay which turned out to be rather nice not having to drive from the Dublin/Pleasanton area into the city and deal with parking. We had a lunch reservation of 11:30am, which was a perfect time. Upon entering Osha Thai, and being greeted and seated accordingly to our reservation party. Since it was a rather nice day, we decided to take a table on their patio. We thought it was a good idea at the time! The restaurant's interior appeared to be dark, almost like a night club...maybe it was just my eyes not adjusting from the sunlight fast enough? None the less, the staff were all very polite, and within minutes we were seated and our server was ready to take your order for drinks and appetizers. However, she neglected to give us menus to see what was available for drinks and appetizers! Other than that slight oversight, things were cool! Okay, so I'm just going to break it down for you here on how the rest of the dining experience went! Osha Thai is a cool little spot the staff are very friendly and attentive to your table. Speaking of table...ours was slanted to one side, and a little shaky? I'm not sure if was just due to the ground being uneven or it was just a bad table? None the less, it made us pay attention to the location of our drinks on the table more, LOL! for a party of three, here's the breakdown.\n\nDrinks:\nThai Iced Tea ($3)\nRegular Iced Tea ($2)\nLychee Iced Tea ($3) \n\nAppetizers:\nFried Oysters ($13)\n\nEntree:\nLemon Grass Chicken w/ Brown Rice ($13) + ($2) for the Brown Rice\nPapaya Salad ($9)\nVolcano Beef w/ Brown Rice ($17) + ($2) for the Brown Rice\n\nDessert:\nCreme Brule ($8)\n\nGrand Total = $78.30 ( Not Including Tip) \n\nOverall, the lunch was pretty good, this is more like a fusion of Thai, not authentic cuisine. I had to remind myself, I was in the City again, and I am paying for a bit more for my dining experience. However, the food was well prepared and served at the right temp. Our meals weren't overly spicy, so you were able to taste the different spices which enhanced the flavor of the meal, and not kill it! My friend had ordered The Volcano Beef, and she shared a few bites with me, and I must admit it was actually pretty darn good, the beef was tender and well seasoned! I had the Lemongrass Chicken which to me was well balanced with lemongrass, onion and other spices and had a sweet kick to it! Again our server was very attentive  from the start to finsh.

It's freaking LOOOOOUUUUDDD!\"\n\nLiterally, I can hear everybody's conversation in the room. I honestly don't want to hear about your business. I want to enjoy my food. Ugh. Prior to sitting down, you'll find yourself hitting every single chair that you will pass by and knocking over a purse or so because the person next to you is somewhat like they're eating WITH you. Anywaise, to summon up that part, if you don't mind being in a clustered-f***, then this is the place for you. Oh, one more thing, service sucks! \n\nOther than that, the food is freakin amazing. I had the curry with the giant prawns inside. I think it's called \"angry\" something. It comes in a lil hot pot with about 5 super giant prawns. Sooooo goooood. FYI, do not eat the pea aubergine or at least that's what I think it is. It's very bitter and I believe it's just for decor. I didn't realize that until I took a huge bite into it. \n\nMy husband had the crab pad thai. Really really really good. They didn't make it extra spicy as he asked. I had a little taste of it and it was not spicy at all. But, he didn't mind. It's just that good. And it comes in a good portion as well. \n\nAlthough there are ups and downs with this place, I still recommend giving it a try. Just not when you're on a romantic date. :)", "author": "K S."}

Instead the food is watered down and wretched. Think Thai curry from a mix plus frozen ingredients. Service is nonchalantly absent minded.  Forget your entree?  Oh, never mind, you'll get it in your next reincarnation.  And if you sit outside the chairs are covered with white bird droppings -- contrasting nicely with the black rattan.

Wow! It was a really busy night so that sort of attention is impressive. Overall the service is pretty good considering how big they are. \n\nOne downer was that it was so loud! The table felt too long so that I felt rather far from my boyfriend. It was hard to really have a conversation with him because you have to raise your voice a bit. But besides that, I love the ambiance. \n\nThe food is pretty good though. They're all really flavorful. We had some pork belly and crab fried rice that was really good. The prawn appetizer that we had was okay. The flavors really  make your meal feel heavy, which I don't like. Oh well.", "author": "Connie Y."}

Their Chicken Pad Thai was made a certain way, but perhaps the ingredients changed.  I visited today which is a Sunday at around 7 before catching a film.  They were packed so I went over to the bar to order take-out.  \n\nOrdered Pad Thai with Chicken.  I didn't have to wait long, they bagged it and off I went, only to return because I had forgotten my beverage, which quite frankly I assumed would be handed off at the same time as the rest of my order.  \n\nNeedless to say, I ate the food.  Since I ordered chicken, I thought I would only find chicken.  It had tofu, and hints of seafood to the taste.  Quite frankly I was bummed.  So I returned after my film.  \n\n3 stars for the food.  It was explained to me that it is custom to use oyster sauce, but I would like solely chicken in my chicken Pad Thai.  The iced tea was a bit too sweet for me.  I wish it had more caffeine, was stronger, or had a 'kick' to it.\n\n5 stars for the gracious service.  It was a great experience.  The supervisor on duty was well-mannered, keen on detail, and humble.  The hostess was helpful and I appreciated her work ethic or care.  \n\nWhile I may not order Pad Thai in the future, I think I will return because of the experience I received from the staff.  While some of the patrons and matrons weren't the most down-to-earth or type of people I would want to be around, the staff here made all the difference.", "author": "C L."}

The Pad See Ew here is a 10000x saltier. I barely finished half of my dish, and that was after a whiskey mixed drink (Thuk Thai? can't remember. Pricey, at $13) and not having eaten all day. With that being said, I love their Pad See Ew on 2nd Street, where it's at a normal salt level.\n\nBut I get that there is a lot to be had here, like a much better nighttime ambience and a lounge just for drinks in the back.

Wow amazing flavor all around.  I could eat about 2 plate fulls of those.  For the main course i had the BBQ & Crispy Pork which was quite a treat.  It is several strips of BBQ with a sweet glaze.  The edges of the BBQ pork are crispy like a pork rind.  It was soft yet crunchy at the same time.  I also had the pleasure of tasting the Kurobuta Hog Chop.\n\nKurobuta pork chop grilled to perfection served with fried yam, asparagus and secret tamarind/raspberry reduction.  I was pretty shocked with this item and how well prepared it was.  The chop was amazing and the sauce just leaves you wanting for more.

I ordered a Thai Spicy Pan Fried noodle with tofu (which is fried), and it was decent. It was really wet, but I don't think it was oily. My food wasn't super hot either, and I could have done with more vegetables. The noodles were okay, but a lot of them were stuck together. It wasn't very spicy, and I think overall flavor could have been stronger. I also got hungry really soon after, so maybe the portions were too small? I don't usually get hungry so soon after eating dinner. The price was also really high, but I guess that's to be expected in SF.

I love that that they have plenty of flavorful vegetarian dishes and are able to make my food extra extra spicy upon request. \n\nThe restaurant is modern but inviting. The chairs are a little hard and scratches the back of my leg when I am being animated during an amusing conversation, but they are in keeping with the Thai look.  The waitstaff are hit-or-miss but none has ever been rude or completely negligent.  It is really hopping around lunch time so try to go before 11:45 or after 1:30. They accept reservations so that is helpful if you're going with a big group or meeting someone at a set time. I usually order for pick up, though, since it is just downstairs from my office.\n\nMy favorites are as follows:\n\nAppetizer: Salmon Rolls \n-- Very light and flavorful. They really whet the appetite as opposed to getting you almost full even before your entree arrives.\n\nSalad: Tuna Poke \n--The flavor of the tuna is not messed up by the dressing. The seaweed and cucumber really complement the fish well.\n\nRice plate: Spicy Eggplant\n--My go-to dish when I am being vegetarian (i.e. Lent). Very good since they can make it really really spicy! Bonus point: you can request brown rice for an even healthier option\n\nCurry: Pumpkin Curry (spiciest they can get it)\n--Quite spicy but the sweetness of the pumpkin helps take the edge off a bit. Just really my favorite out of all their curries.\n\nNoodle: Thai Spicy Pan Fried \n--Just really very delicious.  All the vegetables they use mix really well. You can also ask them to make it very mild if you're not into spicy food.\n\nThis place is a winner. Only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars in good conscience is because they are on the pricey side and I know that I can find the same calibre food (if not better) for less.", "author": "Clarice O."}

Overall the portion was average for the price of the dish. \n\nMy only complaint is the grapes and pineapples were a bit too sweet for the dish and sometimes overwhelming so I ended up not eating all of them and just went for the duck.

I looked through the menu and I ordered Thai iced tea and yellow curry. My girlfriend ordered two appetizers and her main dish. While I was waiting for my food I shared the appetizers. The first one was vegetarian crispy roll, described as silver noodles, dried mushrooms, cabbage and carrots served with sweet & sour plum dipping - I would rather describe them as deep-fried vegetable rolls. The second one was crispy wontons which I cannot find on the restaurant's menu online and that I would describe as deep-fried chicken/prawn triangles. The two were good but nothing out of the ordinary in terms of flavor. I would say that the second was more pleasant than the first one. The chicken/prawn combination was rather unusual but flavorful. The yellow curry (which I ordered with chicken) eventually arrived along with a cup of white rice (which I did not order). It was mildly spicy and there was a good amount of potatoes, onions and maybe something else I cannot recall now. I put the rice in the yellow curry dish and I enjoyed it for a while but then I started to get tired of the chicken which was abundant and somewhat too big. I ate the entire dish and it was decent but, again, there was too much chicken and it was too big. My Thai iced tea was really good. It was served in an unusually weird glass for an elegant restaurant. All in all the experience was good. Our waiter, apparently his name is Pop, was nice and responsive. The only thing I didn't like was that when I asked for a spoon for the yellow curry - for some reason they served the dish with a plastic spoon that you would typically see in Chinese restaurants - he came back with a spoon and did not hand it to me but attempted to put it on the table which, obviously, did not have a tablecloth. There are two issues with this and I will never stop hammering waiters and restaurants for it: the first problem is that I asked for the spoon and not the table so the spoon needs to go in my hands (not on the table) and the second is that the table is not clean, no matter how much you clean the granite top, especially if you just mop it with a wet cloth. Ergo: putting spoons on the table is just a BAD habit that spreads microbes around! This place serves dishes that start at about $13-$15 and go up to about $18-20, mostly because of the location. I cannot give more than 3 stars to this place.", "author": "X. Y."}

If you enter through from Embarcadero Street area, you will reach the main restaurant. Both areas are nice; it just depends what vibe you are looking for.

If I graded on a curve, I would give them all a C as they're all average. Well maybe a B because I would probably be a nice professor. Osha, well she's a special student when it comes to Thai Food 101. She always sits in the front, asks questions and isn't afraid to stand out and try something different.\n\nIf you are going to go to Osha and just order curry or your pad thai like any other restaurant, I feel like you're not taking advantage of Osha's uniqueness. It is like going to a nice sushi restaurant and order a California roll. Be adventurous and order something random that you find else where.\n\nAt my most recent visit we ordered the Volcano Beef and the Bangkok Roti. Initially I was skeptical of how the Volcano Beef would turn out because it just sounded really cheesy. The onion rings on top of a large serving of stir fried beef formed a cone that represented a volcano. It sounded like the least authentic item, but when you put it in your mouth it actually had a flavorful taste. It was sweet and slightly spicy, but nothing that would make you thirst for extra water. The Bangkok Roti was good but didn't get as good of marks as the beef. You don't often see dishes with Roti (Like a deep fried flat bread), but it went surprisingly well with the curry. My main complain was that the curry was too strong as it was too savory. I had to ask for a bowl or rice to try and spread the curry thin with more carbs. \n\nIf you are in the mood for Thai and feel a little adventurous, you might want to give Osha a try.", "author": "David C."}

I came here three times since it's really close to my office, twice for lunch and once for dinner. The price is ok given the Financial District location. The standout point for Osha is their creative modern-asian infusion flavor, so don't be afraid to try the interesting pairing you never heard before.\n\nFood (4/5)\n- Thai Samosa (4.5/5): It's hot and crispy with a good flavor. The pairing cucumber salad balanced off the strong flavor within the fillings of samosas. My thai friend said it's pretty good samosas.\n- Tuna Tower (3.5/5): Tartare is one of my favorite dishes, so I always order it in lots of restaurants. The flavor of the sauce is interesting since it adds the asian twisted flavor on it. However, the main part of the dish, tuna tartare was not fresh enough and they cut it into big chunk pieces, which failed to make it look like a tartare. Not recommended.\n- Firecracker Prawns (4/5): jumbo prawns with a decent salad, good appetizer for drinks, nothing special though.\n- Osha Kobe Bites (4/5): the plating was beautiful and the caramelized balsamic sauce was amazing while the beef was just ok. I mean given the price, you can't expect an Alexander's Steakhouse's kobe beef lol.\n- Pomegranate Duck (5/5): The duck meat cooked perfectly, tender but not dry. The reason I love dish so much is that I never tried eat duck with pomegranate infused. It was definitely a brave pairing but end up working pretty good. \n\nDrinks (4/5)\n- Green Tea Mojito (3.5/5): My friend ordered it. I tried and the green tea flavor was not strong in it and personally I think it's a little bit too sweet Mojito. But I am not a sweet-love person.\n- Pisco Sour (4.5/5): Pisco sour is always on my top 3 classic drink list. It was smooth and mixed just as the level I prefer, not strong not light, right in the middle.\n\nAmbiance (4/5)\nIt's definitely always busy around lunch and dinner time on weekdays since it's in the 4 Embarcedero center.

Thank goodness Osha Thai is open until 11pm! I was really impressed by the restaurant decor--it was beautiful. When visiting any Thai restaurant for the first time, I always order the pad thai. Not only because ordering the same thing allows me to compare the quality of food to other restaurants (and not because I haven't tried other types of Thai food), but also because I just love pad thai! \n\nI'm just going to be straightforward: BEST. PAD. THAI. EVER. It was tasty and delicious! The serving size was very large, and I guess you would say, \"true to size\" for the $12 that you're paying. That being said, the prices for the other dishes are pretty reasonable. My friend ordered the crab fried rice. She was satisfied with her dish as well. We ended the night by splitting the espresso creme brulee. It was good and though I could not help but lick my spoon, it was lacking in the expected crackling, caramelized top. \n\nWe did not have to wait long for the food. The service was nice enough--though I did notice that it took a LONG time to refill my water glass. The only annoyance of the night was in paying the bill. One of the waitresses, upon receiving our payment, bluntly told us that gratuity had not been factored into our bill. I was put off by it because it was unnecessary for her to comment on that. It was a DUH moment since most restaurants usually automatically factor it in with parties of 6+ people. I did not have to be told. Plus, it was not like we were not going to tip anyway--I tend to just pay the bill first and leave tip on the table. Anyway, that sort of soured our moods and we ended up tipping less. \n\nBut despite that incidence, I guess I could handle such service so long as the food is good. I would go back.

It comes nicely presented with chunks of beef with three big fried onion rings atop and some elaborate flower decoration. However, it tastes like what I could get for $7 at another Thai restaurant in basil chili chicken. Flavorful? Yes. Worth the price? No.\n\n2) Crab fried rice (~$11-12): I liked the crab fried rice the most. It has a nice, mild flavor. I've never actually had crab fried rice before, and at $11-12, it's more reasonable than the volcanic beef. However, again, the food itself isn't worth the price.\n\nThe premium here is the ambiance - the interior of this restaurant is gorgeous. Red everywhere, with nice dinner tables. The walls are glassy, so you can see outside to where the ferry building is. \n\nService was good, but at the end of the night, most my friends paid with cash and one paid with card.

The Yellow Curry is also a tasty item that is in the $12 price range as well. And oh goodness, the soups are SO good. You literally have to get them! Either the Tom Kha (traditional coconut one) or the Tom Yum (lemongrass and some other spices and flavors) -- you can't go wrong here (if you ask me :D ). The most recent time I came here, I was feeling sea food, so I dropped $20 on the Osha's Sea (literally all types of sea food like calamari, prawns, salmon, scallops, mussels, crab, topped with eggplant) and it was sooo good. Yum Yum Yum. \n\nAnd don't forget dessert! I've tried a few items on the menu and they are all good. Anything with ice cream = win.

The beat sprouts were fresh as wel - perhaps because my friends didn't mix the bean sprouts in with the noodles is why they though it was mushy?  who knows.\n\nThe Kobe steak bites were presented nicely and tasted quite delicious.  Meat was tender and cooked to perfection - not too rare and not overly charred.  Goldilocks would have been delighted.\n\nThe samosas were deliciously vegetarian; the pastry was different from your typical indian samosa.  It had hints of southeast asian roti that has been deep fried - flaky yet with the proper density and weight for a samosa. \n\nPapaya salad was SPICY - you have been warned.\n\nANGRY shrimp was delightful, not only in name, but in flavor.  Slightly spicy (nothing compared to the papaya salad). The shrimp are huge and accompanied by eggplants and peppercorns on the stem. This dish was the talk of the table - name, composition, sauce, etc.  Yummay!\n\nThe Crab Fried Rice was... OMG!...  a must eat, especially when still hot from the pan (wok?).  I'm rather picky about my fried rice, but man, SO glad the birthday boy made this request.\n\nThe eggplant basil thing (also vegetarian) was very flavorful as well, and had a distinctly different flavor from the eggplants stewed in the ANGRY shrimp.

In fact, you can walk through the buildings to get to the next and only cross very small mid-street intersections. The walk takes 10 minutes TOPS... and that is if I were walking with my 85 year old grandmother in toe. They charged us $88 (yes, EIGHTY-EIGHT DOLLARS) for \"service charges\".

We usually go to the Glen Park location at least once a month, depending on when our Thai food binge begins. We decided to try a new location and this one was closest to Broadway where we were going later in the evening. Luckily we found parking very easily :) but the location was a little bit different, we actually found the lounge area first but got directed to the restaurant quickly.\n\nI love that we were greeted traditionally by the hostess. I think Thai culture is so important and is what is lacking at the Glen Park location but anyways it was awesome. I wai'd back and was happy to be seated immediately.\n\nOur Order:\n-- Kobe beef with salad: 1st time ordering kobe beef at Osha but I guess this is a new item. Wow the beef was so tender and delicious but the salad which was more like a slaw similar to papaya salad was super flavorful and spicy! It was a nice fresh way to start the meal.\n\n-- Larb Chicken lettuce wraps: Fresh flavor and spice kicked this lettuce wrap into gear fast. There was so much flavor it was hard to describe but definitely a winner. \n\n-- Tom Kha Gai: The GF enjoyed this dish. I can only assume that it was delicious because she finished it. She said it wasn't spicy which for me I would have asked for spice but as long as she enjoyed it, it's all good.\n\n-- Volcanic beef: Normally the volcanic beef is a bit spicy but this one wasn't. I wish there was a little bit of a kick but given that our first two dishes were spicy, it was ok because it's so flavorful and tender.

The Pad Thai and the Thai Ice Tea were too sweet; I added water to the ice tea and didn't touch the pad thai.

Basically the girls in the lounge talk back to you if you question anything about the food, drinks or bill, they don't check on you, and they have a superiority complex with their attitude even though they are the ones serving the food and drinks and not the other way around. \n\n2. The dishes in the restaurant are good, many of them are not spectacular, however I must note the VOLCANIC BEEF  is very good. It has a unique combination of spices in the sauce that I have not had anywhere else. That's a must here! We also ordered the country chicken, it was pretty good, really fried, and tasted like a better version of typical chinese sweet and sour chicken. There are a few other good dishes, too. Just look around at what other people are eating and use that as a clue. Their Thai soups are also decent if you are in a soup mood. \n\nThe appetizers are teeny tiny and expensive for what you get, so just get entrees and maybe a glass of wine, and don't expect to be romanced by your server and you'll have a nice time.", "author": "Alanna R."}

The location is covenient for the business crowd and is popular mostly for that reason.  If this Osha Thai were located elsewhere in the city, they would have to improve on many aspects for customers to return. \n\nLast evening's experience was typical of my past visits.  A group of seven co-workers, including myself had a 5:30 p.m. reservation.  We were seated at a table for six, leaving one of our group to be seated at the very corner of the table.  The restaurant had several larger tables available where we could have been more comfortably accommodated but we were told they were reserved.  We were in the restaurant until 7:30 p.m. and no one was seated at the large tables during our meal.  I don't believe they were reserved as they were never set.  Why make paying customers uncomfortable, hoping a large group will drop in for dinner?   \n\nOur meal wasn't bad, it was just OK but all of the dishes arrived barely warm.  My food was cold after placing on my plate.  Not very appetizing.  Also, while seated at the bar prior to the meal, there were two bartenders and another individual, manager type, taking care of task and not waiting on customers.  It took close to 10 minutes before we were approached for our order.  \n\nThis isn't the place if you are looking for a good, authentic Thai meal. Many Yelpers  love Osha Thai.

We were in the area, and I decided to treated my man to lunch a Thai lunch sense he hasn't really had a taste of Thai.\n\nWe were there right at noon on a Saturday and there was plenty of seats, inside and out  and quick hostess service.  The waiter presented himself quickly, and offered us menus, and drinks right away. We ordered the porkbelly with sticky rice, the sticky chicken wings, and the scallops wrapped in bacon (not quite Thai), and my favorite the Padthai with chicken.\n\nPorkBelly: was very tender, and had a nice flavor when paired with the rice.\n\nChicken Wings: Good Flavor!

We later decided to stay for dinner, so we ordered Crab Fried Rice (5/5 stars), Pineapple Fried Rice (4/5 stars), and Pad See You (tastes like any other Thai restaurant).  Overall, the food and drinks were decent, but definitely overpriced.  \n\nNow for the service. Wait, what service?  The workers here don't know anything about customer service.  They constantly came and take away our plates and forks in between orders as if they wanted to kick us out if we aren't going to eat anymore.  On top of that, we were not honored the Happy Hour price on our cocktails because we weren't in the Lounge, which did not open until 5.

This aside, the food, its quality, the service, and prices are horrific and leave me wondering why they haven't gone bankrupt.\n\nUpon stepping in, the waiters dash toward the door from schmoozing with each other to greet you.  They mimic stereotypical, Southeast Asian customs but fail horribly with a cheesy bow.  When you're seated, they hand you menus and flock back to their click to continue socializing. \n\nMy friend and I shared a tofu appetizer and I had the shitake mushroom, baby bokchoy plate. Both tasted like fastfood Thai.  The tofu was overcook and highly drenched with sauce.  It was like an over-processed McDonalds tofu patty.  The bokchoy was undercooked.  The accompanying mushrooms were slim and buried under a mountain of bean sprouts.  I was insulted by their skimpy, money-saver tactics:  more filler ingredients and less quality, main ones. \n\nLater, when my friend and I were about done, the waitress came by to clear the table.  Due probably to a lack of training, poor focus, and overall insincerity with customer service, she dropped and shattered four ceramic plates on the floor right next to us.  Thankfully, the remnants didnt fly into our faces or into our feet.  Some did stain my nice white shoes.  It scared the crap out of us!  \n\nLastly, to ad further insult to this horrific dining experience, the waiter just came by with the bill without making any adjustments to accommodate the terrifying bomb of plates. I politely asked to speak to the manger.  Instead of immediately making adjustments to any degree, he insisted on emphasizing the clumsiness was accidental and not spiteful   \"I KNOW THAT!  I DIDN'T IMPLY OR BELIEVE IT WAS MOTIVATED BY SPITE!\" Only after highlighting that the incident almost gave my friend and I a heart-attack and how lucky we were NOT to incur bodily injury or damage to our clothes did he provide a 10% discount.  \n\nMy friend was super nice and still insisted on providing a tip.

I'm really disappointed to have to write a bad review, but the treatment my party and I got was just beyond the pale when it comes to rude.\n\nI'm an Osha Thai fan.  I was just at their Union St. restaurant last week and, when I can, I have lunch at their food court location at 1 Market St. I'm addicted and every other time I've been to an Osha Thai location I got incredible service.  Therefore, it was a no brainer to set up a group meal at Osha Thai's Embarcadero location when the chance arose.\n\nWhen I arrived one other member of my party was there.  The hostess was friendly and took us to our table.  Our meal was going to be a set menu since we'd already paid for our meal, so we didn't need regular menus.  I'm assuming the hostess wasn't aware of that.  She took us to our table and placed the menus.  A few minutes later the manager comes to our table and without a word snatches the menus up. We were aware that we were getting a set menu, so all he had to do was make some friendly small talk.  We were both like \"um, ok.\"\n\nOne person in our group didn't make it.  But, again, it was a prepaid meal.  It was odd when the waitress told us that we'd not get a 4th plate as we'd decided we'd share it. Again, we knew full well that our cards had been charged for a meal, so Osha Thai had our money. After that was pointed out, we did get a order of fried rice and shared that along with the other main dishes, family style.\n\nAfter that we just enjoyed our meal and chatted. Eventually, they cleared our table and brought the dessert course. We were having such a good conversation that we didn't even order drinks. We didn't need them.\n\nThe service and our meal was good enough to overlook the manager's attitude problem.  However, when we got up to leave, I lost my balance.  Next to our table was a fake marble column with a flower display on top of it. It fell over. The staff rushed in to clean it up.  My meal companions asked if I was okay and outside of a small cut on my leg, I was fine. We then went to leave when the manager approached us. \n\nWe all thought he was going to do 1) apologize for having a flimsy stand next to a table and 2) check to see if I was okay.  Instead, he started going on about how the flowers cost $100 and that if we didn't pay for it someone from his staff would have to pay for it.  B.S. It's a business expense and things fall over at times in restaurants and in retail establishments.  Are you telling me that they also penalize their employees if someone drops a glass or breaks a plate? \n\nWrite it off. We looked at him like he was nuts and pointed out that it was a flimsy stand and that none of us had been drinking. He continued to talk about how it was an expensive display and that someone would have to pay for it. Again, we looked at him like he was insane. He then tried to make us feel guilty and said that the staff would have to pay for it but that we could just go, so we did. Again, b.s. because neither a customer nor the staff shouldn't have to pay for a flimsy display placed way too close to a table.\n\nLet me make it 100% clear that the low rating is specifically because of the manager who was on duty the night I was there: Dec. 12, 2012.  \n\nThe hostess, our waitress, and table staff were great. The manager on duty was rude from start to finish and he also was rude to his staff.  Maybe it was a bad night for him, but I've lived and traveled far and wide and dined in restaurants in NYC, Paris, and even Bangkok. He was unprofessional, ungracious and needs to be given a job in the Osha Thai's main office as he simply doesn't deal with people well.

It's a little dull--they definitely hold back a little on some of the spiciness and funky fish sauce etc. that more authentic Thai restaurants use but the food is still decent.  \n\nThe space is clean and new looking.  Very hip.  It's got a lounge area and a private dining room you can reserve for events etc.   I guess for me the big thing is that this place doesn't feel like a Thai restaurant.  It's pretty upscale for an ethnic restaurant.  And if we're truly being picky, I guess this isn't a true Thai restaurant but more of a Thai fusion.  But for me, its just weird having such a nice space and eating Thai food.  I guess I'm too used to eating Thai food out of takeout boxes or in run down hole in the wall places. 3.5/5", "author": "Bryan P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-05", "description": "Went here early on a Friday night when the restaurant was about a quarter full. The three of us got seated quickly at one of the \"couch\" tables with our menus, and then sat for almost a half hour before a young woman poured us some water and quickly disappeared. Ten minutes later she came by again quickly and filled our water glasses. We started looking around the restaurant and saw what looked like a waiter and waitress just hanging out by the waiter stand. After staring at them for a while, the waitress came directly to our table and.... filled our water glasses and started to make a quick getaway. We called her back and asked if we had a waiter or waitress as we had been ready to order for over a half hour. She gave us a look of annoyance, put down her water jug, and pulled out a pen and paper tablet to take our order.\n\nOur appetizers arrived very quickly along with the cocktail I ordered and was hoping to get before I started on the food. The cocktail, which I believe was called a \"Sazerac\" (I can't find it on their online menu), was advertised as Bulleit rye, aromatic bitters, orange bitters, and absinthe. What I got tasted like a heavily watered down well bourbon with a splash of orange bitters. Very flat and absolutely no trace of absinthe. For the appetizers, we got the \"Long Beach Prawns\" and the \"Tuna Tower\". The prawns were quite tasty though they were missing the iceberg slaw that was listed on the menu. The Tuna Tower looked amazing, but the tuna tartare was a little fishy smelling/tasting and the mango was incredibly underripe. The sauce on the tartare was quite good, and I would love to try this made with fresh fish and ripe mango.\n\nWith the main course, we ordered the \"Totally Scallop\" and \"Hung-Lay Curry\". When ordering the curry, I asked if it came with rice or if we needed to order it separately. She said it came with rice, yet it arrived without rice. Upon asking where the rice was, the waitress said that you had to order rice separately. I reminded her that I had asked about the rice and she said she would bring it out. In the meantime, we started on the scallops. The scallops themselves were very good in a basic yet solid coconut and peanut sauce. The bok choy though were steamed to a complete, limp mush. They stayed on the plate.\n\nTen minutes later, the rice for the curry finally arrived in the form of being dropped on the table without a word by our waitress as she walked by. Upon tasting we found that instead of getting pork belly, which was supposed to be the centerpiece of the dish, we got some dry, stringy, and bland cubes of pork that were what you'd expect from shoulder or butt roast. There was no way that this was pork belly, and when I brought it up with the waitress, she argued with me over it. After she went in back and spoke with someone in the kitchen, she quickly came out, grabbed the dish, and asked what we wanted instead. We told her that we didn't want anything else and asked for our check, which thankfully did not include the curry.\n\nOverall, this place has possibility but is suffering from some of the most horrible service that I have ever experienced and a bad case of trying to cheap out on their ingredients, which probably works most of the time when dealing with the tourist crowd in the area. They get one star for the prawns and scallops, but we will not be going back for them. Might try one of the other locations and see if it's any better, but this place hands-down sucks.", "author": "Cosmic C."}

Turns out meals are a reasonable $10-$20, and you get large portions worth your money.\n\nI ordered the Pad Thai with beef - it was better than most places I've had Thai food! Not too oily or saucy, and just enough peanuts to give a crunchy texture but not overwhelm the noodles. The food came our very fast as well - it seemed like only minutes after I had ordered that my meal was at the table.\n\nThe service was great too - I don't think I've ever seen my water refilled that quickly when it was low. The waiters/waitresses and hosts/hostesses were very accommodating, while also keeping the meal focused on more personal talking time rather than being interrupted by the usual \"How is everything going?\" I've encountered at most restaurants.\n\nThe only con about dining here is that it's pretty loud, but other than that I had a really great time.

We had a reservation, but had to wait more than 10-15 minutes, while the person who was supposed to seat us ran around setting tables and negotiating with large groups that had just shown up without a reservation.  Other waitstaff were available to set tables -- so this seemed an odd and inefficient allocation of responsibilities, leaving a couple dozen people waiting in line unnecessarily long.\n\n  When finally seated, we waited another 15-20 minutes before the waiter took our order.  And then, suddenly, it was rush, rush, rush. They clearly wanted our table.  We'd barely had 20 minutes to eat our food, when a waiter came up and put our bill on the table.  They cleared our plates, without asking if we wanted to take anything home, nor if we wanted any dessert or coffee.  We did, in fact, want coffee.  They brought it -- luke-warm -- with the bill, again (which we'd not asked for) and then immediately resumed hinting that we should wrap up and leave.  Three different waitstaff came up to our table within five minutes to ask \"is everything alright?,\" and whisked off the table anything we weren't using at that moment, including my napkin.  \n\nThen, one of the waiters came up and told us that if we wanted to stay at our square table for 4, we three people had to move to a table for 2.  If someone had told me the expectations of the waiters here was that customers would move through at the pace of a McDonald's, I would have gone elsewhere for a relaxing Saturday evening dinner with friends.  \n\nAs for the food -- I say this as someone who lived in Thailand for seven years -- meh. The green chicken curry had nice heat, but was a little sweet, and didn't have enough fish sauce.  The seabass with lemongrass was excessively heavy on soy sauce.  The fresh vegetarian spring rolls had a thick skin and were bland, despite the slighty spicy peanut sauce.  The deep-fried vegetarian spring rolls were nothing special, and the dipping sauce cloying sweet and not sufficiently spicy.  We tried to order mango salad, but asked for the shrimp on the side, since two of the three people at our table were allergic.  They said that was impossible, because the salad was premade.  Ok, so we got the salmon sashimi -- certainly not authentically Thai, but it actually did have some green mango in the salad, and wasn't half-bad.   The eggplant -- more Chinese than Thai -- was ok, but nothing exceptional.  The minced chicken with basil was ok, but a little sweet.\n\nIf you want an authentic experience of great Thai food, you'd do better at a restaurant in the Outer Richmond, like Patpong.  No special ambiance to speak of, just a quiet and comfortable neighborhood joint, but with great, attentive service and excellent food.  Osha, by contrast, appears to have decided to cater to large groups at the expense of smaller parties, and to throw civility out the window in the process.

A friend recommended this place and raved about the one he went to at their other location.  We apparently went to the lounge part of the restaurant instead of the restaurant.  The staff was friendly and walked us over to the restaurant and we were greeted by the host.  There was no service until 10 minutes later when a waitress with an attitude showed up.  She was not friendly and never smiled at us.  Not that I care if she smiles at us, but at least smile back or have some personality.  In the middle of dinner, a false alarm went off which is really the highlight of the night.  \n\nWe ordered the coconut shrimp and also the mango salad (which was by far my favorite) for appetizers.  For main course we had their pan fried noodle (which I thought it was like the Chinese crispy pan fried noodle but that was not the case) which is basically the same thing as drunken noodle with a twist.  We also had their scallop which came in  4-5 pieces for $18.  That dish was cooked with a peanut sauce and the scallop was very bland if you don't dip with the sauce.  We ended the night with fried banana which was really good.  \n\nOverall, the ambiance was nice, the staff was not so friendly, and I will go back for appetizers and desserts only.  lol", "author": "Vivian H."}

This one had a mild sweetness with a whole lychee to nibble on and a kick of chili - my kind of drink. \n\nKar Thong Tong appetizer (a.k.a. shrimp boats) - My friend and I are still thinking about them 5 days later. 5 golden fried shrimp each propped in a ceramic boat, atop chopped mango, bell pepper, peanuts and onions on bits of fried potatoes (which we thought was corn). \n\nWe also happily devoured the Pumpkin Chicken Curry, topped with crispy yam. The Yin-Yang Sea Bass ('seared sea bass filet + cabbage set on top of thick red curry and green curry sauces') and Pad See You ('rice noodle pan fried with Chinese broccoli, egg, black soy bean sauce and choice of chicken, beef or pork') were also good, but not as memorable. \n\nI look forward to going back for more KTT, Lychee Pattaya and Pumpkin Curry. *4.5 stars*", "author": "Cathy K."}

Very trendy, hip, and all-together a cute spot to have lunch AND dinner (preferably not in one day though please). Service is actually pretty good. The dishes are served quickly, especially their most popular dishes (which I'll go into more later). They have so many guests that they want to turn it around quickly, which they do a great job of doing. \n\nLocation: This particular spot is located along the Emarcadero. As busy as it is, it's niiiiiice, not only because its VERY picturesque but because its close to little shopping spots (i.e. Nine West, Victoria Secret, Banana Republic, L'occitane, etc.), the Ferry Building, and Farmers Market. There's also parking available @all the four Embarcadero garages.\n\nFood time: mmmmmm, everything is good. I don't think I've tried anything from here that wasn't good.

The bf ordered the country chicken and was slightly disappointed because it kind of just tasted like some regular old orange chicken. I also tried a bit of my friend's Thai fried rice with crab and it was very flavorful. Overall the dishes were very hit and miss.

First of all, don't count on happy hour.  When I was there on Friday, it wasn't available because the LOUNGE was reserved for a private party from 5-7.  If that is the case, wouldn't you think the restaurant would honor happy hour in the BAR?  NOPE!  That isn't how it works.  You are just SOL.  \n\nSince happy hour is advertised on their website as lasting until 8pm, we decided to have a drink at the BAR and to check back at the LOUNGE at 7:00.  When we did, my friend was told that there wasn't going to be any happy hour that evening.  Totally misleading, right?  Moreover, the bartenders at the BAR weren't paying any attention because the response I got to my question about what was going on with happy hour was a glass of Singha beer which I never ordered.  And then the bartender has the nerve to look peeved when he has to take it away.\n\nSince we were already there, and it was the end of a long week, we decided to stay put and have dinner in the dining room.  The food was for the most part fine.  We had prawns cooked in a curry with lychee and pineapple which was pretty to look at and had a nice sweetness.  There was also some crab pad thai that was rather bland and didn't have much crab except for two small crab claws.  The third dish was roti with beef green curry, which was a miss.  The majority of my disappointment came from my expectation of thin Malaysian roti.  Instead I got puff pastry that didn't soak up curry at all.  To top it off, the beef was lean and therefore, too tough to be enjoyable.  \n\nWhen we got the check, someone came by every other minute to pick it up until I finally give in and paid the damn thing.

Even the table next to us noticed how long we were waiting for our food and suggested we ask for the bill to be comp or discounted.\n\nWell the manager came by and asked how we were doing.  I was polite and said my food took over 25 minutes and my co-workers arrived another fifteen minutes after that.  I ask her to comp or discount our bill and she said she would.  Her immediate response is \"We're very busy\" and gave me a half hearted response to my request.  No apologies at all.  \n\nShe even came by again shortly after to say she applied a discount.  Well to my surprise, when the server dropped off the bill, she had applied a whopping $2.50 to the bill!!!\n\nWe left the exact amount due with no tip, then another server came by to pick up the bill and I told him that the $2.50 discount was an insult after we waited over 40 minutes for our food.  Other tables did not have to wait like we did.  Again response was \"we're very busy\" no \"I'm sorry.\"  \n\nThis is so disappointing, as I've eaten at the Tenderloin Osha Thai and the SOMA  locations over the years and always had good service. \n\nThe decor and furniture for this Osha Thai was weird too, tables and chairs were set up to be a lounge I guess for their evening business.

The steak that was used was really good, which is probably what made it expensive since they were cubed cuts of some really good beef, definitely not some cheap stuff.  What makes this dish I suppose \"American\" is the onion rings that they put on top of the stack of meat.  The Pad Thai that I ordered is pretty good as well, a lot better than other thai spots, but it is highly priced.  You want the same stuff, just go grab some at King of Thai.  You want to know what's really good though, was the Bacon wrapped Scallops, I highly doubt that is Thai Food, but it was damn good.  The cocktails are way too expensive for the lack of amount of liquor too, hook it up if it cost so much!!\n\nThe decor of the place is top notch and is really nice and warm feeling.

But here's the thing.  They've got good food.  I especially enjoyed their selection of apps, most notably the beef wasabi rolls, the tuna poke that they Thaified by combining spicy, sweet and savory flavors; wasn't too impressed with the duck rolls that Osha tried to fusion with Mexican by wrapping the thing in a flour tortilla which was a failed effort and not so creative.  The lychee martini was strong and sweet and creeps up on you so don't down those--martinis are meant to be sipped and not gulped, a lesson I have yet to learn.

The wings- I shoulda read Janice C's Yelp prior to and emphasized it to him, since he sounded pretty set on the wings. Like her, I expected it to be like stuffed like other restaurants (which I've never tried, but always wanted to), but it just came in a sweet fish sauce and some seaweed.  It was okay.  I enjoyed the volcanic beef, the sauce was nice and the beef was tender and cut into perfect sized cubes.  The onion rings were tasty too, but a little soggy (expected though).  The bbq & crispy pork were on top of a bed of bok choy & came with a nice sauce over the bbq portions & a side dipping sauce of soy.  The pork tasted like you would get it from a Chinese deli, only better at the deli.  The food also came out fairly fast.\n\nThe service, while not very conversational or bubbly, was very attentive.

Lunch options are not short at the Embarcadero but sometimes you want something a little bit better than fast food. I won't say that Osha Thai is significantly better than getting a bowl of soup from The San Francisco Soup Company or a sandwich from LuLu Petite but if you want to feel relaxed, pampered and have a deep craving for Thai food then Osha Thai seems to be the spot where most people go.\n\nOsha Thai is packed and though the staff does not seem to be surprised at the volume of customers they get, they do seem to be ill prepared and untrained on service. The waiters walk around spacey and when we reminded ours that we were supposed to have one more dish and where was it she had seemed to forgot we had even ordered it.\n\nOsha Thai is real cool looking. It's one of the trendiest and sleekest Thai restaurants I have ever been in. I could see why people come here. It's a far cry from boring cubicle life. The food, however, was nothing to rush out of the office for. \n\nFor starters we got the duck rolls. It was roasted duck with slivers of cucumber, green onions, cilantro, carrots, and chives. They rolled it with a tortilla! Since when were tortillas used in Thailand? This is where fusion goes wrong. I know burritos are famous in SF but they do not belong in Thai restaurants. The duck rolls would taste so much better if they were rolled with rice paper or egg roll wrappers. In fact, those two ingredients are probably cheaper than a pack of tortillas. At least the rolls came with a sweet dipping sauce that actually made it tasty.\n\nFor entrees we got the Pad See You and Volcanic Beef. The Pad See You was bland but the Volcanic Beef was spot on. Volcanic Beef is one of my friend's favorite dishes at Osha Thai and she was right about it. The Volcanic Beef was pretty fancy and it reminded me much of the beef dish at Tao in NY right down to the stacked fried onion rings. It was flank steak wok fried with basil and black pepper. The sauce is spicy and it tastes great with white rice. I could have finished the dish all on my own but of course my friend and I were sharing.\n\nOsha Thai gets so much praise and hype in the Bay Area. I just don't see what the big deal is.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-22", "description": "I came here tonight for happy hour, and this particular incarnation of Osha Thai is totally fancy pants.  I suppose that's to be expected, since it's by the Embarcadero.  I've been to two other Oshas - the one in SoMA and the one in the Tenderloin.  The SoMA one is also fancy pants, but the Tenderloin one is modest and unassuming - and I guess in comparison to the Embarcadero and SoMA ones, it would even be considered ghetto.  \n\nAnyway, that's the first thing that struck me about this Osha.  How fancy schmancy it was, with its dark interiors, fires, loungey atmosphere, and couchy seating.  The happy hour actually takes place in the back area; it's definitely got that sort of ambiance if you're looking for that.\n\nSecondly, the prices. $6 for their signature cocktails, $5 for regular cocktails, and I think $3 for beer.  The happy hour small plates are all $8, and most other full-on entrees are priced in the teens.  If memory serves me right, the Osha in the Tenderloin is several dollars cheaper for identical items.  I guess you're paying for this location and the ambiance, but anyway, the drink prices are standard for the location, but the food pricing's on the more expensive end for this type of food.\n\nThirdly, the food.  It was decent and tasty, as most Thai food is.  But honestly, most Thai places, whether it's King \"McDonalds\" of Thai or something more revered like Marnee Thai, taste similar to me - the only difference that I can taste is the amount of grease they infuse in your dish, or the amount of food they give you.  And I felt similar about this Osha: standard Thai food, not mind-blowing.  We got the Thai samosas, pad see ew, pad thai, fried rice, and the cucumber salad.  Everything was fine, though the samosa was pretty amazing.  It was $8 for 4 samosas though...wallet hurt. \n\nFourthly, the drinks. I got a Bangkok by Night, some type of rum-based drink with strawberry and banana liquer.  It was really strong (which I like), and tasted very medicinal (read: BAD) which I did not like.  I also tried the lime hurricane and the mojito, both of which were much better than the rum drink.  The mojito was the better of the two.  Note, though: Drinks were strong.  It normally takes me several drinks to start feeling anything (alcohol dehydrogenase FTW), but here it got to me after one. \n\nAll in all, it ain't worth the price.  The ambiance is nice if you care about that stuff, the food is generic Thai (aside from the samosa, which was admittedly BOMBIN'), the drinks are strong (and I guess can be nastily medicinal too!).  \n\nOverall:  It's a good, but pricey happy hour.  I had fun, but probably would not come back here again.  There is better (and cheaper) Thai food and drinks to be had.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Right off the bat, I fell in love with the beautiful decor. The interior design is so impressive. Everything looked right - from the lighting to the tabling to the flower pond display in the bathroom. I would say its truly reflective of its location (FiDi), so don't be surprised when you see important business men & women throughout the restaurant. \n\nTIP: They have a semi-hidden back room (almost like a second dining area when the front is too full). Request to sit here if you want a more relaxed environment as the front gets too noisy. \n\nI came here with 7 people - and boy did we do work on that menu. I would say the food came out not too long and not too fast, and they were definitely friendly. One of the ladies we came with was a regular and she was getting treated not as customer but as a friend. So cute! Anyway, run-down of the food, which is what we're really here to discuss:\n\nDRINKS:\nLychee iced tea - Recommended by someone at our table. Sweet (not too much though) but perfect on a hot day. \n\nAPPETIZERS:\nBacon Wrapped Scallop - I was kinda confused: how is this Thai? One of my Thai coworkers said that it's for sure not authentic. With that said, it was okay. Not a stand out. However, it is a scallop wrapped in bacon....how can that not be good? \n\n*Casanova Prawns - DELISH! The prawn was sooo good! I loved this. Came with a cup of mango, tomato, salsa-ish medley. Perfect complement to the prawn. Probs my favorite appetizer\n\n*Dungeness Crab Rangoon (?) - I'm not exactly sure if this is what we ordered but we had crispy wontons with a tomato, mango, avocado \"dip\" that was also really delish. Very well made! \n\nENTREES:\nWe did family style which was the best idea EVER because I got to try so many dishes!\n\nVolcanic Beef - I thought the flavor was definitely on point, although it wasn't my favorite of the entrees. Topped with onion rings though! \n\n*Lemongrass Chicken - FAVES! I loved the flavor in this dish. Sweet and sour! Yummy! RECOMMEND!\n\nHeavenly Halibut - Very well cooked! Also not quite memorable for me (then again, I only had a small piece), but the garlic lime sauce was interesting. I just liked that we had fish to balance the meaty dishes we ordered. \n\n*Pad See You (also Pad Kee Mao) - So, we ordered both pad see you and pad kee mao. Why? Because I LOVE spicy and to fulfill my spicy needs. Although, the pad kee mao was not that spicy....at all. I did like the flavor though and the veggies. Both dishes were pretty much as good as you'd want your rice noodles to be. Recommend as a a default noodle dish!\n\n*Green Curry Chicken - FAVES! I loved the spice to it! Perfect. Also, I liked all the bamboo in the dish. The curry sauce was soooo yummy. I was very happy!\n\nSpicy Eggplant - Always gotta order an eggplant dish! It really doesn't take much for me to enjoy an eggplant dish. This wasn't an outstanding dish, but it was still good. Very standard. \n\nDESSERTS:\nMango Sticky Rice - Here's one thing: I've never been a fan of sticky rice. I think it's because my mom always made it and after eating rice as an entree, do I really wanna eat it for dessert? And sometimes - it's just too sweet! So really, this might have been a great dessert, but my childhood issues just never allow me to enjoy sticky rice. I did like the coconut cream though!!!!\n\nFried Banana with Ice Cream - LOVE THIS DESSERT. Ice cream and fried banana is always the best choice! I thought the friend banana was a little elementary made as I've had better, but still...what's not to enjoy? \n\nOverall, I'd say the food isn't authentically delicious. There wasn't any dish I hated or thought was really bad. It was either just okay or really good (not amazing though). For the most part, everything was flavorful. The plating was beautiful, so if anything, this restaurant knocks aesthetics out of the ballpark. \n\nDining experience is really 5 stars! If you're looking for GREAT genuine Thai food, you probably shouldn't come here. However, if you want a fancy nice dinner with satisfying dishes, I recommend Osha for sure.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

When we started to eat, and Forrester stop by just to check if everything is okay.\n\nWe finally noticed the service we were not expecting.  We notice Forrester giving directions and instructions to one of the crew to a table that needs water or something.

This is gonna be a great night!\n\nSometimes you just have to be spontaneous.  Plans change.  My friend wanted to get out and about on her birthday so I suggested Osha Thai in the Financial District.  I'd been here several times before but never on a Friday night.  After we found parking we headed in to the hostess stand and asked for a table.  None were available so we made a run toward two bar seats that were open.  \nI already knew I was gonna order a Lychee Martini but as soon as she saw Chimay Tripel (on tap) it was love at first sight.  We had just gotten our drinks when we were told our table was ready.  We didn't get one of the sofa tables but a table close to one.  We were seated next to a glass window which at first was a little chilly but once we got the drinks down we warmed up quickly.   Our server was super nice, friendly and came back often to check on us.  We ordered the Tuna Tower as an appetizer. It wasn't what I expected but it was tasty enough.  For an entree the Birthday girl ordered the Pumpkin Curry and I ordered the Volcanic Beef.  I had their Kobe bites on a prior visit so I knew the beef would be delectable.  The Pumpkin Curry wasn't at all what I expected as I don't really care for Pumpkin but the heat snuck in and made this dish very tasty.  The Birthday hummed and said she loved the dish.  The Volcanic Beef actually sang to me.  It was amazing.  The dish was beautiful to look at and the aroma was intoxicating.  We were warm and buzzy as we were working on our 2nd drinks for the night.  I had a Thai Smile which had Jack Daniels and Cinnamon in it.  My friend had a Thailander which I think had Basil and Mango with other stuff which was savory and good.

I can tell that they have a good formula for their pad thai and curries.  Another one of my qualms is they tend to serve smaller portions.

All 3 dishes were well prepared.  While the spring roll seemed more of a specialty roll that belonged in a sushi place, it tasted good.  The pumpkin curry was a recommendation from a friend who lived in San Francisco and frequented Osha.  It was on point!

The Yellow Curry was pretty flavorful and was served in a cool looking asymmetrical bowl! The only downfall of the main dishes were that the bowl of rice is way tii small! It comes in a coconut shell which probably contains only 500 grains of rice! It was just a hassle, portioning my rice to my dish. By the way, the main dishes serving sizes are pretty good! The dessert sizes aren't. Overall, i rate Osha with three stars, because it's pretty good food, nice atmosphere, but overpriced.", "author": "Briana H."}

I am salivating just thinking about it...like pavlov's dog. :P Osha's Sea Curry is an amazing combination of prawns, salmon, scallops (large ones!), mussells, crab claws, and deep fried eggplant in a delicious curry sauce. Honestly one of the best, if not THE best, curry I've ever had the pleasure of devouring. Tip: for those who love it spicy, this dish is SO good with a bit of sriracha sauce. \n\nThe bf ordered the Volcano beef which was as beautiful as it was delicious. It reminded me of the shaking beef at Xanh (MV) or Tamarine (PA). I think the shaking beef at Xanh is a bit more tender, but the portion and presentation at Osha is much better. \n\nAs a whole, Osha Thai will probably be my go-to Thai place in the city. I have vowed to try them all. With lovely ambiance, nice service, great food at a reasonable price, what more can you ask for?", "author": "Jeanne S."}

So much more upscale and fancier, and the menu shows it.\n\nI came here for a birthday dinner with a party of 20. They put us in a different room, closer to their lounge area. Loved the oversized wicker-like chairs and large dining tables!\n\nEveryone ordered whatever they wanted.  The +1 and I ordered the fried tofu for our appetizer, and Osha's Sea and crab fried rice for our entree. \n\nThe appetizer was typical - generous portions of crispy tofu served with a sweet sauce topped with peanuts. But our entrees were fantastic! Osha's Sea consisted of almost all of the seafood you can think of - scallops, salmon, shrimp, mussels, real crab and sauteed eggplant in curry sauce with light coconut milk. Great flavor with a hint of spice, just perfect! However, we were nearly done with the dish when I discovered a chunk of what I thought looked like chicken. I took a bite - it was the salmon. I thought it was too tough for the delicate textures of the other proteins in this dish.  \n\nWe were surprised that the entree came with rice on the side. If we knew that, then we wouldn't have ordered the crab fried rice. But on the other hand, I'm glad we did. Definitely no imitation crab in this fried rice. Real crab pieces and crab claws served with several slices of cucumber and an orchid for decoration.  Simple, yet delicious.\n\nThe waiters and waitresses handled our large party divided into two tables very well. No mix up of orders, and everyone got all that they wanted. That's a big plus, especially for a big party! \n\nNOTE: they validate parking!", "author": "Kimberly S."}

The last dish - a soup- came when we had all polished off the food and assumed that the last dish was forgotten. Who eats soup last? My co-workers thai iced tea never came, despite three reminders to waitstaff.  The scallops were not fresh and had a poor texture.  Soggy vegetables in the Pad see ew noodles.  The pumpkin curry almost made up for these faults, but was hardly worth the trouble.  Together with the painfully loud interior, I couldn't believe we were paying $15 each for the meal.

However, I almost always come at off times, so your experience during busy times may be different.  I've been to Thailand a few times and, at least in flavor, this place is comparable to the good places I ate there... probably not as good as the best, and 5-10x more expensive... but good. \n\nSo why not 5 stars?   I love the flavors of thai food, but almost always want something other than water to wash it down... and no free refills!  :(   They are very good about service and refilling your water, but at $3 a pop, 2 people drinking iced teas gets silly quickly.  \n\nMy staples:\n- Tom Kha Soup - both soups are delicious but I like the Tom Kha better.  It has more flavor and is more interesting to me, and very different from what you'd normally get as soup.  The coconut milk and chili play off each other so well.  \n\n- Duck curry - flavorful and tender duck, great balance of veggies and meat, intensely flavorful sauce, and easily stretched with rice.  Love the coconut rice with it, as well.  Yes it's fatty, but fat is the messenger of flavor!\n\n- Volcano beef - ask for it spicy.  Yum.  Super tender, decent quality cuts of beef, and a party in your mouth.  I love the contrast of textures between the accoutrements with the dish as well. \n\n- Kurobuta Pork Belly - it's slow cooked bacon from a special pig! inch thick pieces!  Covered in a 5 spice sauce.  what could possibly go wrong?   This is just as good as it sounds. \n\n- Lemongrass Sea Bass - probably the only thing even remotely healthy on my list, but it is really freshing and tasty.  Great texture.  Not a huge piece, but enough to get some bites out of.  mmmmm.  Intense flavors that somehow still allow the sea bass flavor to come through.\n\nThis place is surprisingly kid friendly on weekend lunch or weekday dinners, early.

Lady at the door doesn't even bother to greet me .  And so I proceeded to ignore her very existence as well.  Our meal consisted of Pumpkin Curry with Chicken, Ginger Beef, and Crab Fried Rice.  Plus Thai Iced Tea.  Everything was just meh.  Pumpkin curry - I've had better.  Ginger beef- chewy, there was ginger??  Crab fried rice - best out of the three but for some reason, I don't remember tasting the crab.  Thai Iced Tea - too sweet.\n\nFor real, don't expect much from service during the lunch rush.  Waiter appeared quite impatient with us as we kept denying his request to take our order.  Would it kill him to give us a couple more minutes?  And don't be alarmed by their eagerness to take away your plates even when it's obvious you're only halfway done.  They like to assume that you're done with your food just because you've put down your fork and everyone's just talking at the table.

I went in today for a co-workers going away party to find an explosion of people waiting in line to be sat (first mistake we made).

Less than 10 minutes (with having to ask 3 separate times if we could double check the back room that I knew was empty). \n\nStarts off great, we all order drinks and sit back to enjoy. A table of 3 guys sat next to us and a table of 5 sat behind us (roughly 5 min after we sat). We got our drinks and asked if we could order. The waitress said we had to wait until she spoke with the 3 guys next to us. Granted - greet them, but you can't say no you can't order. So we wait. She takes their order goes and puts their drinks in, greets the table behind us and then she returned. Beers = half empty, stomachs = fully empty. Finally order. 10 min later the food at the table next to us starts to arrive, then the table behind us, then more for the 3 guys...us still nothing. 20+ min go by and finally 2 dishes came out and then 3 and then 4...we are still missing 3. 10 more minutes the guys next to us (between 3 of them) received 5-7 dishes and yeah I truly wish I was exaggerating about this. Finally we get her she forgot the one order and the other 2 were promised in 2 minutes. It has been an hour since we were sat and suck for me I got to go back to work with no food, pissed off and with no apology or explanation.\n\nLuckily, my coworkers stayed behind to talk to a manager and here's the kicker: the manager explained that because we ordered \"different types of food from different types of areas of the kitchen\" he couldn't get us our food all at once.

It wasn't very spicy which was fine but it wasn't really much of anything else either. It was a decent sized portion but I can't say I left satisfied. I've definitely had better pad thai at other places.\n\nI did enjoy the spring roll appetizer though. They came with a spicy peanut sauce that was very tasty - they could have used some of that on the pad thai. And the boyfriend's shrimp fried rice was good too. I guess I just ordered the wrong thing.\n\nOverall I was just not that impressed and I don't think I would go back.", "author": "Holly R."}

The restaurant is just dark enough to feel cozy, and is nicely decorated with dark wood panels. It feels like a casual nightclub. The place was about half full and we were seated immediately. \n\nI got the mango salad, which is a small ball of lettuce with shredded mango and green onions all surrounded by cucumber slices, and topped with three shrimp, and it seemed like there was some kind of light lime sauce, with a sprinkle of hot pepper. It was refreshing and delicious. Kind of like a mango version of papaya salad. I also got the lychee iced tea, which comes with a peeled lychee in the drink. Pretty sweet and lychee tasting, was good. We also got tom ka gai, which was very tasty.\n\nFood came out pretty fast, and people are nice. The ceilings are low and smooth so it's very loud. Probably good for a party but slightly annoying if you want to be low-key. Definitely want to go back though.", "author": "Kelly B."}

Actually, I think the service was better at dinner time - everything came out fast and we didn't have to wait too long for the check to come.\n\nEverything we ordered was delicious, and filling. Obviously not the same size portions as ordering take out from your local favorite Thai restaurant - but I was pretty surprised we had leftovers. Between three people, we ordered:\n\nCrispy Tofu Salad ($8) -- so tasty and fresh!\nPad See You with Chicken ($11) -- which I've never had before, but everyone raves about it here on Yelp and I am a fan!\nPanang Curry with Beef ($16) -- very good, and very meat-y!\nPrawn Clay Pot ($17) -- also one of my favorites. The shrimp is super jumbo sized, juicy, and flavorful.\n\nI've read that you usually have to pay for rice, but maybe it came with the curry for free (?) because I wasn't charged for it.\n\nAlso had beer & cocktails at the Lounge behind the restaurant. The lounge is separated from the restaurant, and therefore Happy Hour prices do not apply if you are in the restaurant having dinner. Happy Hour is now until 10pm Monday through Friday, instead of until 8pm Thursday and Friday. $3 beers, $6 well cocktails, and $7 signature cocktails. I think the price is still a little bit much for the signature cocktails, but meh, still tasty. I'm not much of a beer drinker. And green tea mojitos are surprisingly refreshing.

Tuna Tartar - small portion of tuna with bunch of other stuff\n3. Kobe beef - $35 for 4-5 pieces of thinly sliced beef.....really????\n4. Mango moose - yum!!\n\n\nShocking factor #1: \nThe girl waitress did not know what a Panna Cotta was.  I saw a Mango Panna Cotta on the online menu so I asked for it for a dessert. The poor girl made me repeat it 3 times and still didn't get it. Educate yourself before you work at food industries...\n\nShocking factor #2: \nDo not get \"kobe beef\", unless you want to get ripped off. You would expect a decent portion of very good quality meat when you pay $35. Well not here.  You get about a whole 5 pieces with some over-marinated mushrooms and a rice bawl. The beef was tasty, but the sauce was too sweet, and the portion really needs to be twice as big to be fair.\n\nShocking factor #3: \nI saw this in another review, but there WAS a piece of rock in my plate too. It was mingled in a Tuna Tartar. Red fag! \n\nShocking factor #4:\nThey don't take reservation for 2 for Saturday night. But you can sit at a bar and drink so that makes up for it.\n\nShocking factor #5: \nThis is part of the bad service. The food came really fast. Normally it is a good thing, but not when it's TOO quick. The main courses came even before we finished the appetizer. Who does that? \n\nOther than that, I like the atmosphere with pretty decoration, so my star goes for that.\nOh, and make sure to bring a winter jacket because if they seat you by the window you will freeze to death without it.", "author": "Cartman P."}

(Most Thai enthusiasts should suddenly hit the back button but let me explain-- I haven't had one in a while, we were a group, and I had to order quick.) I asked for some lime with it. Lime-- one of the most basic of Thai ingredients. The waitress shrugged. \"Only lemon; no lime.\" I was astounded. \"What, are you sure?\" She repeated, \"Only lemon, no lime.\" I couldn't friggin' believe it. Folks, there's no way in hell I believed her, and at $13 a plate, I wanted lime. I went to the bar and asked for lime. The bartender immediately gave me a glass filled with lime wedges. Well there goes the tip. At least the food would be good. Well, I was wrong again. The shrimp went uneaten-- a first for me. They were like chewing gum. I've never known a Thai to overcook shrimp. Well, this was no longer shrimp... this was chewing gum. The rest of the dish was so/so. Absolutely no spice, but the noodles were Ok. Then again, not sure how you could mess up noodles, sugar, oil and salt. The waitress only gave me a fork, no spoon or anything to help break up the noodle mass. The bartender saw me struggle and signaled to our helpless waitress to give me a spoon. (Btw, spoons are the basic Thai eating utensil-- not giving one to a patron is like saying \"f-you.\")   Osha, never again, what a major disappointment.

We ordered lamb and chicken kabob with peanut sauce (sauce was good, meat was a bit done), pad thai (over-sauced), spicy eggplant (not a strong taste), lemongrass sea bass (not a strong taste), and green curry (the best dish of the night and one of the best curries I've had).  \n\nOverall, it was nice to have tried this Osha location but it is not something that I would go back for or make me want to crave Thai food.

Feels wrong going to a place called Osha when you work in Human Resources/Risk Management, but the food was oh-so-right!  Got there early and put my name down on the list (even if you're meeting people and they aren't there yet, get your name down on that list pronto!) and when my friend arrived, we were seated quickly.  I love the dark interior and the bar looks amazing so I'll have to try to head down there again after work one day. \n\nWe had the shrimp pad Thai and the tofu and asparagus.  Food was out in minutes, though I wish it took a little longer because the asparagus was a little undercooked and tough.  Still had good flavor though, lots of garlic.  The pad Thai was really good.  Service was extremely fast, water was refilled several times, but don't expect any side interactions with the staff.  They are on a mission to take orders, serve food and clear tables, which I don't mind if I'm heading back to work.  Hopefully dinner service is a bit slower though so you can relax during the meal, partake in the decor and view.  \n\nAfter Easter, I'm going to have to head back down to try the Volcano beef that everyone is talking about (it was Friday - I was trying to be good).", "author": "Maria S."}

The dishes are either hit or is consistently crappy. \n\nPapaya salad- Pretty good. One of the better papaya salads in the city. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too fishy. Good balance of flavors with a nice alfalfa garnish to balance out the acidity.\n\nCalamari- One of the worst dishes they have. The calamari is way too dry and overcooked. Not enough seasoning and flavor. The sauce is gross. It's like Mae Ploy mixed with dijon mustard and honey. Way too sweet for me.\n\nTofu- I was expecting a crunchy chinese style tofu dish, but was surprised with an agedashi type of soft tofu. Same sauce they smothered the calamari with. The tofu was cold and bland. \n\nVolcanic Beef- You MUST order this! It's the best thing they serve! The beef is bursting with flavor. Very strong star anise flavor brought out with a dash of brandy. The thai basil and yellow bell peppers were fresh and flavorful. The garlic brought everything together very well. The cubes of steak, themselves, are very tender and fatty. Great wok-grilled aroma. Deeelish! \n\nPumpkin Curry- Subtle curries are characteristic to Thai cuisine in contrast to Indian curries, which I find to be far too offensive to my taste buds. This dish was overpowered by the coconut milk.  Needs a bit more garlic. The should consider frying or roasting the cubes of pumpkin to a crisp and then carmelizing the skin to add texture to the dish. The pumpkin didn't really do much for the dish in terms of flavor.\n\nCrab Fried Rice- Really aromatic and flavorful. You must order this as well.\n\nFried Banana Ice Cream (FBI)- Hated it... I think they used plantains instead of banana bananas. Not sweet enough. The batter was too thick and not salty enough. No flavor. The coconut ice cream was disgusting! Not creamy at all, too icy in texture. Very artificial tasting coconut flavor.\n\nService- VERY rushed every time! The waiters and waitresses are eager to take away your dish before you even finish them. The FOH greeter always gives me attitude. The dishes come rolling out of the kitchen pretty quickly, so it's great if you're starving.\n\nOverall, this Osha is a great venue because of its stellar location, good ambiance, flavorful food, and reasonable price.", "author": "Colleen W."}

I like to add soy sauce to my rice, well white rice, and while adding and forking through the rice I noticed a small black item which turned out to be a small fly of some sort.  Thinking of wow this fly must have just flew and got on my rice.  Well, the fork continues to move throught the rice and I find a nest of cooked flies-or black flying bugs of some sort.  I immediately called the waiter over, showed him the flies/bugs, he then proceeded to ask us if we wanted to have that taken off of our bill?!  WTF!!!!  No sorry about that or anything.  We did not receive any type of concern from the front door waitress or our waiter!  So when you are eating at Osha Thai and have ordered rice, better check it for the bugs!!

I came with a group of 12. 30 mins passed by and after 10 mins after the rest of my group had gotten their orders, I asked our waitress about the status of my order, she rudely rolled her eyes and said \"it's coming\". I waiting here patiently while I'm watching the rest of my party eating the food. They also messed up a pineapple fried rice that my friend ordered and included peanuts when she specifically asked for no peanuts (she's allergic). They remade the dish and still...no sight of my pad Thai. When I called a different waitress to cancel my food, she nodded and ran off. 2 mins later, they delivered my dish and it wasn't even made correctly. By this time, my appetite was gone and this shitty customer service left a sour taste in my mouth. When I had told the waitress, I had already cancelled it, they simply took the dish away and without saying sorry, took the pad Thai back to the kitchen. If you are looking for customer service, don't come here. Didn't get a single sorry until we asked for the manager. Wow. I've never experienced such poor customer service. Do yourself a favor, if you get a waitress by the name of Kunvadee, please ask for someone else. She'll try to kill you if your allergic to peanuts.", "author": "Esther M."}

Some of the tables were for 8 people. I don't mean that they weren't using them waiting for a party of 8 but rather the table could not be a worse size. This means cramming in people wherever there is space, sharing a table isn't so bad to me but it would have made more sense for smaller tables which can be combined as opposed to large tables that are not flexible.\n\nThe noise level?! It's incredibly loud inside probably because of all the stone reverberating noise to no end. Not a place to go if you are looking for something on the more formal, quiet side.\n\nThe service was adequate although clearly there were not enough servers to cope with the demand nor were the cooks timed correctly.\n\nOne dish comes out at least 5 minutes before the other. Not cool.\n\nPineapple fried rice was actually very tasty and it would be worth having that again. The kurobota pork belly was ok but way overpriced.

Enjoyed that the skin was very crispy.  Nothing particularly innovative or exciting once you get over the fried basil.\n\nMussamun Lamb: A huge lamb shank amidst Mussamun curry sauce with squash instead of potatoes.  Served with a cool looking rice pyramid that alternated between white rice and red colored brown rice.  I'm still stuck on the novelty of having lamb in Far East cuisine because the usual assortment of proteins is often limited to chicken, beef, tofu or shrimps (always plural!).  I personally didn't like the sweet squash contrast to the lamb and would have preferred more traditional potatoes.\n\nBBQ Beef: I ordered this dish, but didn't actually get it.  It was advertised as having brussels sprouts.  For most of my life I would think \"Yuck\", but have had some really good dry fried brussels sprouts in the last few years so was thinking \"Yum\".  When the dish came to me there were no brussels sprouts, just broccoli.  I was livid!  Beef & Broccoli is not even non-traditional Thai, it is crappy Chinese buffet.

I finished it in 15 minutes and was still hungry. At any other thai restaurant you can get a larger portion of duck curry for the low teens, which can be split into multiple meals. However, the quality of the food is pretty good, and I like that they de-bone the duck for you so you aren't in an awkward situation, using your fingers trying to pry the fat and bone from the meat.

The skin was crispy and glazed with honey, the duck was sweet and had just the right fattiness that made it good duck, meaning the whole piece wasn't a fat glob.

The place that we chose was inexplicably closed on a Saturday night so, pissed off and hungry four-year-old in tow, we trudged down the street a few hundred yards.  Thai food, happy hour, three blocks from our hotel and they have TVs... DONE!\n\nWe went in expecting little, $6 small bite happy hour plates and $7 cocktails were pushed.  The service lagged at first in front of house but was more than made up for later.  We had been out in the city all day and a refreshing beverage was in order.  I chose their Moscow Mule.  Served in a high ball glass I was taken back at first, where's my copper mug? But the flavor was interesting, apple or pear vodka threw a curve into the mix.  My wife enjoyed it, I ordered my second with neutral spirits.  \n\nThen the food... Oh the food.  It came at a blazing pace.  Ordering took 20 minutes, food delivery off three courses while eaten and enjoyed, 30.  It was like as soon as we said the last syllable the food was being prepared.  \n\nThe first bite... The kurobuta pork small plate was amazing.  Well braised fatty pork on what seemed to be sticky cooked rice wrapped into a 3/4 inch diameter cylinder, the cut into 1/2 inch portions and fried.  It was a perfect marriage of a rich, luscious fatty piece of perfectly flavored and seasoned pork with a dense cake below to mellow it out.  They were 1 for 1 and the look my wife and I gave each other after the surprise complexity of the first bite was fantastic.  Also, my 4 year old, in an absolutely hateful mood having been walking in the city for 8 hours, said it was good and had her mood turned around.\n\nNext came the firecracker prawns.  The stakes had been set high, like really high, by the pork.  They crushed it, a perfectly cooked shrimp with a slightly burned tail with just enough vinegar sweet hot sauce on the top to season it without overpowering it.  Further, they put bitter greens on the plate to counter the sweet shrimp and lightly sweet sauce.  Boom, 2/2.  And, my 4 year old also approved of this one.\n\nNext came the mains.  My wife ordered a vegetarian hot pot.  Now, when she ordered she hand't had the shrimp or pork.  So as sensible as it seemed at the time of ordering, this hot pot was destined to disappoint.  I had ordered the Pork Pad Se Ew (or You as they spelled it).  Now, I had only ordered this because their black ink pasta with seafood medley was out for the night, so I was expecting little from one of the dishes I constantly order for lunch at my favorite Thai place by the office.\n\nMy favorite Thai place by my office can die in a fire.  This was amazing,  The smokiness, the perfect pork, the broccolini, chewy noodles and the sriracha style sauce were ridiculous.  The firm tofu and broth in my wife's hot pot was also impressive.  My only criticism of the whole meal was that the hot pot probably could have used more mushrooms to enhance the umami.  My 4 year old ate everything we shared with her, and asked for desert...  4/4 and the whole family is about to go home happy.\n\nThe desert menu looked great, but heavy given the amount of food we had consumed.  We asked for a scoop of ice cream off menu and were treated to amazing coconut ice cream with crispy coconut shreds on top garnished with a single raspberry (add a few more of those next time), green apples and parsley (you had three colors with the brown coconut, apples and raspberry, leave that off next time).  My wife also ordered the ginger tea, we drink a lot of tea, and this was very high quality tea seasoned with a bit of honey.  Order both and thank me later.    \n\nI have told many people in the Palace Hotel about this place and made sure the concierge new of our experience.

I think that when you go somewhere with a big group your expectations for good service are lowered somewhat, but Osha can definitely deliver.\n\nSo too with a small party - I often meet a friend of mine here for post-work dinner, and the waitstaff is equally attentive.  If I could rate the service alone, I'd be giving 4.5 or so stars.\n\nHowever:  The food isn't wonderful.  I've had most of the vegetarian options and I often find the sauces too sweet, especially their pad thai and panang curry.  Kudos for the pad thai coming with lime, ground peanuts and fresh bean sprouts, but my portion last night was lukewarm at best.  The pumpkin curry is good, but far too sweet.  \n\nBe forewarned that it is a loud place and if a quiet, intimate conversation is in your plans, this is not the place to be.  You may have to shout \"What?!\" several times across the table, forcing your companion to yell something like, \"I said, I need a bigger VIBRATOR!!\" \nAt that point you're just enhancing the dining experience of everyone around you, so I guess that's  really a plus.", "author": "Molly B."}

Like I said, I normally don't pay much attention to this kind of stuff but this time it actually caught my attention (like thank goodness she had shorts because i don't want to accidentally look at people's butt while eating), and my bf's mom also thought it was not really appropriate for daytime.)\n\nRegardless, I would still come back for another meals, sans the short dress.", "author": "Karen M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-24", "description": "Osha Thai has one of the best pad thai dishes in the SF Bay Area, in my opinion. The noodles are always cooked well (not too dry and not too soggy), and the entree itself is completely flavorful. I tend to like sweet-tasting pad thais, and Osha Thai always makes it just right for me where it is sweet enough but not too sweet. \n\nI often go here for dinner and order the pad thai, but I have ventured out and ordered/tried other dishes as well, which were very tasty such as the beef wasabi rolls for an appetizer, ginger beef dinner entree, pumpkin curry chicken dinner entree, and the salmon sashimi salad. The portions are great, although for Thai food, it may be on the slightly pricey end, but it's not overpriced. \n\nOn another note, if it matters to you, the ambiance of the restaurant is also pleasurable to the eye and is very comfortable. Although the ambiance and the location of the restaurant feels mid-to-high end, there is no problem with you dressing casually and dining here. For example, my best friend and I many times have gone for a run along the Embarcadero and then dined here at Osha Thai in our exercise clothes without a problem. The service is unbiased as well (i.e., even though we look like exercise bums, we are still treated and served well as valuable customers).\n\nIf you go here for dinner, I hope you enjoy it as much as my friends and I do!

It was the day before our interviews and we had to meet some other professionals in the field and eat with them I guess and get to know them better. There were about 30 of us and we all ate together in 2 long tables which made it kind of hard to talk to people at the end of the table, but that's a different matter. I heard that this place used to be better when it wasn't a chain. It's gone down from then.\n\nFood:\nAhi Tuna Wasabi - this was average. The tuna itself was good, but the daikon wasn't amazing, and neither was the \"special\" sauce. There wasn't the kick that I was expecting from wasabi sauce.\n\nOsha's Sea - It was pretty good, but a bit hard to eat. The curry bowl was on the plate with the rice. It took up most of the room on the plate so it was kind of hard to get the curry onto the rice. The fish was delicious though. The crab was a bit hard to crack and eat all of the meat. Perhaps because I was with a group, I don't remember the fried eggplant especially since I dislike eggplant on most occasions. \n\nMango Sticky Rice - It was average. It was beautifully plated, but I've had much better at other places. \n\nDrink:\nThai Iced Tea - it was pretty good, nothing amazing, but nothing out of the ordinary either. \n\nService/Ambiance:\nWell since I came here with a big group, we were all served together. There were about 15 at each table which made it hard to come all together. It took a while for everything to get ordered. The servers were helpful in choosing what was good and what not, but then again, I was focused on getting to know the people around me.  There is a nice lounge outside for drinks and what not, but the room that we were in was nicely decorated with bamboo and what not, but it wasn't amazing or anything.\n\nOverall, I kind of had an average experience. I was great to able to talk to professionals in the field that I'll be going into in such a setting while eating. It makes it a bit more casual, but educational for me as well. Would I go back to Osha? Probably not unless someone else is paying. The quality of food to me is just about average and nothing too amazing.

To start, we had the Dungeness Crab Rangoon and for our main dishes, we got Pad Thai, Pumpkin Curry, Honey Duck, and Crab Fried Rice.\n\nThe Dungeness Crab Rangoon was essentially tasted like cream cheese which was what I was expecting, but I felt like there was little crab in there. Funnily enough, I found the Crab Fried Rice to be overwhelmingly crabby where I felt like none of the other spices meshed. The Pad Thai was disappointing as I found it not seasoned enough and lacked flavor -- I would actually liken it to instant Pad Thai. \n\nThe hits were the Pumpkin Curry and the Honey Duck. The curry had ample chunks of fresh pumpkin and the red curry was right on point. The Honey Duck was great, which is saying a lot since I don't even like duck!

Originally, we had a reservation at Americano, but then the b-day girl decided that she was feeling like Thai food, so after a couple of drinks at Americano, we cruised over to Osha at Embarcadero.\n\nEverything was fantastic.

My favorite drink turned out to be the Lychee Martini, so then I had to order that for myself on the second round.  Salmon Rolls and Kobe Beef were my favorite appetizers.  As far as the main dishes, we ordered a little bit of everything, including Pineapple Fried Rice, Pad Thai, Panang Curry, Prawns Pineapple, Pork Belly, and another noodle dish.  I loved everything and could not stop eating.  Everyone else at my table felt the same way.  Kurobuta Pork Belly was off the hook, as well as their Pineapple Fried Rice.

A hungry human being, that is. \n\nI was too impatient to wait and coordinate with any of my coworkers, who had also just landed in San Francisco, so I set off from the hotel with no plan whatsoever, just looking to find a reasonably good place for dinner.  After wandering around in circles for a while, I happened upon Osha Thai, and it seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. \n\nThe decor is super classy; it's definitely a pretty place, but not in such a way as to make you feel uncomfortable if you show up in jeans. The service was reasonably good, my only complaint was that the bartender took a while to fill up my water (I was dehydrated from the flight, and would empty my glass as soon as he could fill it), but he was clearly occupied with other things. Specifically, making actual drinks for people.  (And, by the way, he looked like he was pretty good at it, so next time I'll have to try a cocktail.)\n\nSince I was on my own, I sat at the bar and ordered some kind of vegetarian spring rolls (the crunchy, fried, unhealthy but super tasty kind) and vegetarian hot and sour soup. Both were fantastic, and the soup tasted like something that would cure you of sickness, as though it'd be perfect if you had a cold or the flu or something. It was extremely comforting, and quite tasty; my only complaint is that it had a few too many mushrooms in it, but I did my best to pretend I enjoyed eating them. \n\nOverall, I was a fan, and I'd definitely go back.", "author": "Jessica R."}

The outer wrap was more of an opaque white rice skin rolled in black sesame seeds. Very nice and very good.  \n\n My personal choice of Panang pork was very good in flavor (when I asked that it be medium spicy - it indeed was medium spicy) but the plentiful pork was dry in a terrific sauce with red bell pepper strips and Thai basil.\n\nThe large dome of rice that was served with it was perfect texture and I could have just had the sauce and rice; it was so tasty.\n\nThe Tai Iced tea was a bit sweet for my taste but it was again nicely served in a very tall beer glass.\n\nThe timing of the service was odd, each dish came out when they were ready rather than the entire table getting served at once; which lead to the first person just sitting there with his dish getting cold while the others of us still were waiting--not too long but we simply could not start eating at the same time because of this staggered service style.\n\nThe location and view are terrific but the decor is very hard-edged which means LOUD. When this place got going, it really is hard to hear your table-mates. Service was good and not intrusive at all.\n\nAll in all, a decent place for lunch.

After a while, they finally took our order.  Then, we watched for more than 30 minutes as the servers brought out food to the other tables in this forgotten back room of the restaurant.  It was actually comical.  About 75% of the time, the servers would come around, start to serve someone a dish of food, and the person would say, oh that's not my plate... Hardly any of the dishes found their right recipient, or even table, on the first try.\n\nMeanwhile, my dad received his dish about 12 minutes before mine came out.

I almost always get great customer service.  I've had some amazing and some pretty terrible food here.  For example, angry prawns used to be tasty, and the seafood curry is delicious.  However, within last a couple of years I stopped ordering it, because \"fresh crab\" in that curry usually means exactly one tiny crab claw.  Chicken Pad See Ew came a few times without ANY chicken meat in it.  They also mix up the orders.  For example, I ordered the noodles dish for my kid \"not spicy\" and it came with a load of sriracha all over the plate.  He couldn't eat it.  I asked my curry dish to make extra spicy, and it came almost bland.  I didn't care much for it.  It happened more than twice lately.  Very disappointing.  It seems the food was way better several years ago.  The wine could be really good, if you like German wines.  But the cocktails are way-way-way too sweet.  Same goes for Thai ice tea.  How much sugar is in it?!  The happy hour also used to be awesome, but now it has become a joke.  The happy hour cocktails are now limited to the three \"mules,\" a few choices of house wine or beer.  But the appetizers are particularly disturbing.  Garlic fries came out without garlic, completely bland, like from McDonalds.  And the chicken wings looked very, very strange.  I mean, they did not look anything like chicken at all.  The bones were so thin, they looked like the ribs of a small animal, they were also slightly curved and cut straight, like split up ribs.  They were NOT nice and round, the way chicken wings normally look.  They tasted weird, too.  So, in a short period of time, this place went from one of my top favorites to my top places to avoid.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-26", "description": "4.0 Stars\n\nOsha Thai has to be one of the sleekest, modern Thai restaurants I have been to. This location even has a chill lounge around the corner of the restaurant. With such a great ambiance there is definitely a higher price tag. I was worried at first that the food might not live up to the fancy interior, but I'm glad there were a handful of dishes that stood out.\n\nOur group of 7 was able to try an array of dishes and family style was a good way to go. I have to say that some dishes can be hits or misses at Osha Thai, so I'll try to recommend a couple that really stood out from our selection.\n\nThai Samosa\nPotato, onion, carrot and yellow curry in a pot sticker wrapper served with fresh cucumber salad\n*Excellent appetizer! \n*There was a good curry flavor that wasn't over powering. \n*It had a crispy exterior and a pillowy center.\n*The portion of on the cucumber salad was pretty small and I wish there was more because it was light and refreshing.\n*RECOMMENDED\n\nDuck Rolls\nRoasted duck rolled with cucumber, green onion, cilantro, carrot, chive and tortilla\n*The pieces of duck were very flavorful.\n*These were wrapped in a tortilla and I found that quite interesting. I would have preferred it was wrapped in lettuce so it's like a lettuce wrap. \n\nGrilled Sea Bass\nGlazed with sweet hot mustard, served with steamed baby bok choy and homemade spicy tangy sauce \n*Amazing! The dish had an overall very fresh and light taste.\n*The presentation and flavors of this dish were superb. \n*The mustard sauce had a nice green coloring to it that it looked like pesto. The mustard flavor complemented the sea bass really well. The baby bok choy soaked in a lot of the mustard flavor and that's a good thing.\n*The sea bass was cooked perfectly and it melted in my mouth.\n*RECOMMENDED\n\nLemongrass Sea Bass\nSteamed marinated sea bass with lemongrass, kaffir lime leaf topped with fried lemongrass served in a clay pot\n*This dish had more sea bass than the Grilled Sea Bass dish.\n*The sea bass was very tender.\n*It was a solid dish, but I would recommend the Grilled Sea Bass over the Lemongrass Sea Bass.\n\nGarlic Pepper Lamb\nDeep fried marinated rack of lamb with black pepper sauce served with summer salad and curry rice\n*The pieces of lamb were very tender and had a mild gamy flavor.\n*The vegetable medley was very tasty!\n*RECOMMENDED\n\nGinger Beef\nWok-fried flank steak with ginger, shiitake mushroom, onion, black pepper and topped with crispy yam \n*The cubed pieces of beef were really tender and the ginger flavor was not very strong. That's a plus because I'm not a huge fan of ginger.\n*The combination of all the vegetables tasted really good.\n*I though the yams were potatoes at first, but then I noticed it had a very different taste and texture.\n\nThai Spicy Pan Fried\nRice noodle stir-fried with tomato, mushroom, bamboo shoots, Chinese broccoli, bell pepper, onion, basil, chili and choice of chicken, beef or pork\n*This is their version of Pad Kee Mao\n*The flat noodles and beef were tender. The basil and bell peppers really brought out the flavors for this dish.\n*I generally prefer this dish to be a little spicier and I think the sauce they drizzled on the side was Sriracha.\n\nGreen Peppercorn Pork\nSaut\u00e9ed pork loin, green peppercorn, basil, Kaffir lime leaf and coconut with red curry sauce \n*I felt the pork was very chewy and tough. I didn't come across much of a peppercorn flavor as I was savoring the pork pieces.\n*I didn't find this dish very appetizing.\n\nYellow Curry Chicken\nYellow curry with bell pepper, onion, potato and chicken\n*I think our group ordered one dish too many for our group of 7 since we barely touched this.\n*There wasn't anything really special about this dish.\n\nWhen coming to Osha Thai, it's best to order dishes that stray away from the typical fare of curries or noodle dishes. I feel there are unique dishes at Osha Thai that have a lot of creativity and taste good too. The ambiance of Osha Thai is cozy, sexy, and inviting. I'll definitely be back for more!\n\n== A MUST TRY! ==", "author": "Jason H."}

There was the bar that people could hang out at if you really didn't want to have sit down dinner and just sit and have a drink, \n\nAlthough it was weird seeing a white chick welcoming us in her Thai outfit and speaking in Thai. It was cool I guess. We got out table pretty quickly.

But it was soooo good! \n\nYin-Yang Sea Bass - Seared Sea Bass fillet and Napa cabbage over thick red curry and green curry sauces. Yummy and refreshing. \n\nBeef Wasabi Rolls - Carrot, celery and mint wrapped in sliced grilled premium flank steak served with watercress salad. I liked it, but it was a bit salty for me. But I don't eat or use salt in my food as much. \n\nPad See Yu. Normally not my favorite dish in the world. Since I've always had it so bitter. But this was so good. I liked the Sweetness of the sauce and salty of the eggs,meat and seasoning and bitterness of the Chinese broccoli. Perfect! \n\nPanang Curry - My favorite. They give big chunks of beef and not that crappy slice shit that you get everywhere else. The spices and the coconut just perfect blend. Oh by the way they made a mistake and gave us chicken at first, but fixed it by giving us the right one in a couple of minutes, and not 30 mins later.

I wasn't as happy with how the food was prepared here 'tho.\nIt's a lovely dining room, spacious and tastefully decorated.  Our waitress was very friendly and low-key.  Started off with the tuna tartare.  It came pre-formed from being stacked into a cup with chopped avocado on the bottom, layered with chopped mango and topped with chopped raw tuna.  It was pretty but fell apart too easily and some of the tuna ended on the table because they mounted the tower too close to the edge of the plate.  I thought it was OK.  They have outdoor seating for warm days.\n\nBeing too hungry, I also ordered a cup of tom yum soup w/chicken.  Meh.  It was too sweet, too salty and too tart.  The chicken was over cooked and dry.  Lastly, I tried a new dish on their menu, the chicken larb.  It arrived in a big bowl with huge lettuce leaves and lots of ground chicken in the center.  The dish was OK.  I wouldn't order it again.

Across from the Ferry building. The appetizers came out almost immediately and the main dishes were just as fast. Good if you're starving or have somewhere to go but the timing was a little off (still were eating appetizers when the main courses came out). Things we tried:\n-Fresh young coconut water: served in its shell and beautifully presented. Ice cold and delicious!\n-Kobe beef bites: tender and tasty but much smaller than I expected. There were 5 bites on picks and the size of the meat was about the size of a red grape.\n-Tofu and Asparagus side with brown rice:  enough for an entree for one.  Flavor was perfect and asparagus cooked perfectly. The brown rice was delicious.\n-lemongrass sea bass- served in a small hot pot, the fish was fresh and flavorful. The broth was on the salty side but still good.\n-fresh spring rolls with shrimp: these were fresh but the least impressive item we tried. Kind of flavorless and the wrap was just too thick and mushy. The shrimp was almost nonexistent. It was served with your standard peanut sauce. Nicely presented.\n-chicken and lamb satay: on a bed of copious but good peanut sauce, the lamb was tender and delicious. The chicken was white meat but dry. Hopefully a fluke.\n-country chicken: reminded me of a cross between a general's spicy chicken (less spicy though) and a sweet and sour sauce on breaded chicken. It's served with sriacha sauce that adds a little heat. Good, just not really Thai- tasted like something you'd get at a Chinese restaurant.\n-volcanic beef: didn't try it but it got raves from our table for being tender and delicious. Not spicy at all.\n-crab fried rice: VERY good! Fresh tasting, sweet, meaty crab in each bite. I don't even love crab but this was oh so good! I could've eaten the whole plate!\n-fried banana with ice cream was very good. The banana was crispy and sweet with a nice honey drizzled on it perfectly. The scoop was coconut ice cream was very good. Very fresh tasting and creamy.\n\nThe automatically add gratuity for parties of 6 or more. They validate parking so it was only $2 on Saturday evening! Score! I agree with others that the food is overpriced.\n\nOverall, presentation, ambiance, and speed of service were highlights. The food is solidly good (not phenomenal or even great if you're a foodie), is made a little more mainstream for American's palates (think PF Changs).

The crab wontons, fried tofu, tom yum soup, panang curry beef and pad see you were all very tasty. The soup is great extra spicy. \n\nThe atmosphere and ambiance is pretty cool. All the dishes look appealing. The decor is hip, and they place upbeat house music (at least on the Friday night that I went). \n\nMy issue with Osha is the \"chain\" feel. For instance, the didn't have hot thai tea. Going to a thai restaurant, I want to drink thai tea. And not the creamy, iced thai tea. Just fresh brewed tea. Instead, I had green tea, and it was served in a cup with a tea bag and a side of hot water. They never offer to refill the cup. I guess you have to pay more to get refills. The water they supplied only lasted for two small cups. I hate that. I want endless tea! It's cheap, so come on, give it to me. \n\nThe last time I visited, the service was not too great. First of all, I called ahead of time to make a reservation, and the hostess said I wouldn't need one. It was slow and they could accommodate walk-in's. I get there, and the hostess desk is packed with people waiting. We only waited 15 minutes, but still annoying that she didn't take my reservation. I'm sure had I made it, I would have still waited 15 minutes because they didn't seem to organized that night. It just annoyed me. I was going to a movie later, and I wanted to plan accordingly. Good thing we had plenty of time though. The waiter, although super cute, wasn't too keen on checking in on us. We told her we wanted drinks, and she didn't come back for at least 15 minutes. If I was a waitress, I'd be coming right back b/c drinks means a bigger bill and a bigger tip. Oh well, to each his own. \n\nAlthough this place is cute and serves pretty decent food, I much prefer an authentic hole-in-the-wall over Osha.", "author": "Carey L."}

The food was yummie and service attentive.\n\nI dont know what the F is wrong with this place--- maybe the ugly mentally disabled cousin runs this joint because that is what you find here. I work near the financial district and its hard to find a thai place that isnt farther up market or by Union Square. My coworkers and I found this location and have come here a couple times.\n\nThe service levels and food have gone down and down and DOWN.\n\nAt lunch time, expect the place to be PACKED and VERY LOUD. The acoustics in this place make you feel like you are at a Mumbai Baazar. You can harly hear the person you are with speak. So, -1 star for the layout. \n\nService- oh god, where do I freakin start? You are always greeted in a very sweet Thai folder hands bow, though it just seems to artificial and sooo fake. You have multiple waiters as you find with any Asian and Indian restaurants. The price is pretty high for lunch time but its better than your Thai buffet lines. \n\nFood- here is where I have an issue. The food usually comes out very fast... sometimes too fast that it makes you wonder if you are just eating from one big pot. The taste is usually pretty good but the variety for Vegetarians- LACKING. Suddenly one day I found out from a VERY INFORMATIVE waiter that the Vegetarian Tom Yum is made with chicken stock, all the curries are pre-made with Fish sauce and that leaves you basically with 4 dishes.  They never let you substitute and the waiter in their broken english claim the kitchen staff is out to get everyone.  So -2 stars for the food and options.\n\nOverall, why do we keep coming back? The location on the Embarcadero is awesome and its the most accessible. But really, they need to work on their service levels and menu options.

The food is ok, but not great, and it's WAY overpriced for Thai food.  \n\nI try to stick with the more authentic Thai things, like the noodle soups, but a lot of the things on the menu are a bit too \"Asian fusion\" for me, such as the Duck rolls (which use a tortilla) or Pad Thai with crab (which I've never really seen anywhere else).  However, some dishes like the Pad See Ew, Duck Noodle Soup, and Pork with String Beans are quite good -- there's just not enough on the menu that I really love.  Also, as often as I try to order things \"super spicy,\" they can never get it to the level that I want.\n\nI will continue to go there when it's on someone else's dime, but I just don't think I can ever go there when I have to pay for myself.  \n\nI would, however, highly recommend the dirtier, less fancy Osha at Geary and Leavenworth if you're craving Thai food, especially late at night (maybe after you've been drinking).", "author": "Pilan C."}

We both ordered lychee cocktails on the happy hour menu for a discounted price. While we were waiting on our drinks, the hostess came by and said our table was ready and said we  could just have the drinks come to our table and pay there. So we went to our table. But the drinks never came, so had to flag down a waitress to track them down. She came back saying that our drinks weren't at the bar and questioned whether we really had ordered them. So we had to put in our order again.\n\nWhen the check came, our drinks were on there, but for full price. Turns out the happy hour price only applies when you sit at the bar--how stupid. We told the waitress that we had ordered the drinks at the bar and had been told that it would be okay to have them transferred to our table. But she argued that since she couldn't even find the drinks at the bar in the first place, the price shouldn't apply. Her English wasn't very good so she ended up getting another person to come talk to us. This person, whose English wasn't much better, also argued against us. She ended up getting another person to come talk to us. This person claimed that she didn't have the ability to change the check once it was in the system, but offered us a free dessert. We said no. She said that if we came in another night, she would give us free drinks and proceeded to tell us what nights and times she was there. We asked if she had something more official, like a coupon, but she did not. Finally, she went and spoke to the manager and HALLELUJAH, figured out how to to change it on the check. \n\nOverall, this was a very stressful experience. I'm not sure if it was just that night that half the staff was incompetent, but you should definitely be wary if you're ordering drinks at the bar while waiting for your table.

Yes I agree that is what they should want; they should not so openly let the customers feel that way.\n\nAlso, it is extremely loud inside which makes having conversation with anyone a challenge and in a party more than four you better plan on pairing off to have your conversation.\n\nI would not necessarily recommend this spot, but in the same since I would not tell you not to go there.

I know it's in the Embarcadero and across from the Hyatt, but that doesn't mean one should have to pay through the nose for the same food one can get for half the price somewhere else. \n\nI've come here many times, for lunch and dinner, because it's convenient and, despite the high prices, it's good. The pumpkin chicken curry has always been a favorite. After tasting it last night, it's now my dad's favorite too. Pad See Ew is also good, as is the crispy tofu appetizer (10 large pieces--it was an entree for me).\n\nThe look and feel of the place is nice, the service is decent, and the music is always a bit too loud.", "author": "Katie I."}

The food, what little of it I got to try, was very good. The grilled beef appetizer (with tamarind sauce) was juicy, tasty, and perfectly cooked.\n\nIt gets extremely crowded during happy hour, FYI, to the point that the cumulative volume of all the people talking made it hard to have a conversation with the person next to me, even shouting. It's great to see that they're so popular; I just wish they'd install some sound-dampening features so it wasn't quite so loud. It certainly doesn't help that they turn on the music loud enough to be heard clearly over the talking, thus creating a din that set my nerves on edge and completely negated the nice atmosphere of the decor. The noise level made me want to bail on my friends to protect my hearing; I couldn't interact with them effectively anyway.\n\nEven after happy hour ended, the staff were difficult to flag down for a drink or to pay a tab. I was glad I'd paid cash; my friends had to wait around for their bills.\n\nIt looks pretty, and if you have plenty of time, it's a decent place for a drink or snack.

What a pleasant surprise that the service was flawless, despite the presence of a full house and several large parties. We were seated quickly, our server was busy but not harried, and our dishes were brought out and then cleared with excellent timing. The only time we had to flag down our server was when we wanted the check. \n\nThat said, be aware that this place is very popular and it is LOUD inside when full. My voice was hoarse by the time I left, and I could only talk to the people seated directly adjacent to me at my table. And this was on a Thursday evening, not a weekend.\n\nThe menu here, like at many Thai restaurants, is extensive. I had a difficult time choosing because so many dishes sounded delicious. I finally settled on a Lychee Martini (yum!) and our table shared the following dishes:\n--Thai Samosas\n--Lamb & Chicken Satay\n--Tom Kha soup\n--Lemongrass Chicken\n--Pumpkin Curry\n--Osha Spicy Pan Fried \n\nAlthough the Pumpkin Curry was slightly too sweet for my tastes, all the other dishes were delectable. Portions were generous, and they weren't stingy with the meat. If you are vegetarian, it shouldn't be difficult to find many options to your liking. \n\nExcellent food. I'll definitely be back to explore more of the menu, but perhaps I'll find out which night is slowest and go then. I didn't destroy my hearing as a rock-punk-pop blasting youngster, and I don't plan on destroying it now as an older-but-wiser foodie  :)", "author": "Jeanie S."}

However, this one compares badly to the two others I've patronized (Valencia and Geary), and for this I feel the need to knock off a star.\n\nThis Osha emphasizes drinking more than the others, with a happy hour and a list of interesting cocktails.  They also bump up the decor a few notches, and present their fare attractively.  For this you pay inflated prices, even though the food falls into what I call the \"Mediocre+\" category: I recall that it was good, but can't remember anything else.  \n\nThe best approach here is probably to come after work for cocktails and appetizers.  I say \"probably\" because I've never tried it - I don't work in the FiDi.  The few times I've been here it's been because I was in the general area, didn't have the time/inclination to travel, and Thai food sounded yummy.  Like I said, the place is legit - it's just that you can do better.\n\nOn that note, I'll close with this: if you're looking for killer Thai food, don't need a fancy atmosphere, and aren't terrified of the TenderNob, go to the Osha on Geary instead. It's cheaper, better, and they will make your food spicy - even if you are a white girl with a midwestern accent.", "author": "Janna M."}

We have eaten lunch there two or three times during previous trips, but this was our first dinner experience and it proved to be the best dinner we had during our stay. A couple of provisos if you go on a Friday night...be prepared for some serious volume level; I could barely hear my wife for the first half hour (till I got used to the ambient noise). The frenetic atmosphere affected the staff--our waiter appeared quite stressed by all the activity--in fact, an altercation erupted across the dining room, but the staff handled it very professionally. As for the food, well, it was very good. My wife liked her fried rice and chicken dish and I very much enjoyed the beef and noodles. Our server gave me some good advice about how much heat to add.

When at dinner, we were seated promptly, but I think our server had too much going on in her section: she forgot our drinks and then messed up our dinner order by bringing an entree as an appetizer, so it sat there getting cold while we waited for the rest of our food (crab fried rice, papaya salad) which was good but not exceptional, and certainly not worth the cost. \n\nI'd heard that the happy hour specials here were fun, so I convinced a group of my friends to give it a try, and by the end of the evening every single one of them were ribbing me for even suggesting that we all show up at this place. It's full of business people with more wealth than taste, which I guess is fortunate because holy crap. The happy hour menu comes with suggested drinks and small plates. My mojito seemed to have double the simple syrup and half the booze of a normal one, and I wish they'd used a word more descriptive than \"small.\" A small plate implies to me that two people could order three of them and be if not stuffed to the gills than at least satisfied at the end of a meal. Going on that definition these plates are miniscule. So that's fine, just sip your drink and chat with your friends, right? Wrong. The music's so loud you have to raise your voice to be heard, and the seating is made more for form than function.

Given that this was my first time trying their happy hour, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I had tried other osha thai locations for dinner and knew that their food and drinks were exceptional, so I was expecting the same caliber at the lounge.\n\nAnd it was. The food and drinks were great. The happy hour prices were reasonable. \n\nUnfortunately, the service that I received there really soured my experience.  Since I visited on Halloween, they were having DJs setting up, and so I think the wait staff was already in a party mood. My waitress, Wendy, in particular, was having an exceptionally great time. Upon sitting down, she did not acknowledge my table, and the table next to me, for about 5 minutes.  We had to ask another server whether we should order at the bar, or would a waitress come out to us.  Only after asking, did she come to our table to take our orders.  My friend arrived a little bit later, and she had to come back to us TWICE to ask what our orders were again, since she had forgotten (and we only ordered two items).  Each time I would look up to scope out the restaurant, she was either busy dancing next to the DJ booth, or taking pictures at the Svedka photo station.  When she did come by to check on us, her speech was always a bit slurred.  Our drinks and food took a while to come to our table, even though it was not extremely busy.  After ordering our final round, she messed up on our drink orders and included additional shots that I did not request, but we drank them anyway since she had already delivered.\n\nIt took a while for her to come back with the check, and upon double checking our bill, turns out that she had already included AUTOMATIC GRATUITY, for two people! I understand automatically adding gratuity for big groups, but it's the two of us, and her service was not up to par of what she would receive from the automatic gratuity.  I'm not sure if they've been stifled in the past for them to have this charge, but nowhere on the menu did they mention that for every table, they would add automatic gratuity, no matter how big or small your party is.  It's ridiculous! I definitely believe that I'm a generous tipper in general, but when I'm automatically charged for something where I don't believe they deserve it, it infuriates me. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come back to Osha lounge again because this experience definitely left me questioning Osha's ethics and customer service.  And if I did come back, I will make sure to not have Wendy's service ever again.", "author": "Lucy W."}

Yet to visit all SF locations, but I'm very fond of their Embarcadero Osha Thai location!\n\nLOCATION: Within Embarcadero 4 Building of this mall area...closest to the large water fountain landmark-thingie-artwork off of Embarcadero Road. Street parking (good luck) else garage parking in this building; coming from the freeway Fremont exit, Fremont turns into Front St, right turn on Clay, & cross over Drumm literally onto the cobblestone road...garage parking on right side. Yeah, they flippin' charge $3/hr, but heads up Osha validates *yeeesss!*\n\nRESTAURANT: Romantic, soft, hip, & everything nice to dine w/ another person or a large group. The main restaurant was actually closed off for a wedding party on our dinning out for a bday, so patrons were being seated/greeted @ the other side of restaurant, which I honestly never even knew of; this back part of restaurant connects w/in the building closest to the inside escalator. Area was still nice, spacious, cozy, & fun. This restaurant caters & welcomes any crowd & all individuals *kudos*.\n\nCUSTOMER SVC: Great great great! Speaking on this location alone w/ about 4-5 visits in 2-3yrs, always friendly, helpful, patient, prompt, & thorough.\n\nDRINKS & APPs: So the dinning out was Saturday 8/1/09 evening w/ about a party of 8; more folks were suppose to come but same night Ricky Henderson was getting inducted into the A's Hall of Fame, so hook up w/ others later. With our party of 8 I think we tried plenty of everything. Cocktail drinks http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=5OF-wsSf0gFKF85Ci4Firg was pleasing to everyone...all tasty light, not heavy w/ alcohol. All cocktails get recommendations http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=dzXWTcMbuZ3uez2Jgf3qUw Thai Samosa http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=9W8-B6IaUk5v-ctBkEMjJA was a bit on the dry side for me alone, so the dipping sauce to the right of the plate makes sense to be part of dish; taste wise, kinda taste like sweet potatoes of some sort. I wasn't too crazy about rice paper on the Osha Fresh Spring Roll http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=HWSzIJKpbfOsICmqz8MDJQ but gf ordered this & was happy. Fellas order the Duck Rolls http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=n0qteLC_DCqWKVod1RdyOw which were tasty alone & w/ the dipping sauce *recommendation here*! \n\nENTREES: Everyone was pleased w/ everything here. Spicy Catfish http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=-uRj4FuXSKJs_ztx1p3M3A , Yellow Chicken Curry, Crab Fried Rice, Prawn Pineapple http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=Nyf91GfpG_FVKzJUGifT7g , & Pad Thai http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aZ_YuxbdMB_ViExPkiXTbg?select=CbnoyQBbgS7ni7myqGQf7w U can see from the pics, dishes can suggest \"family style\", which is what my sis-Estella & I did w/ our curry-rice-prawns...others pretty much stuck w/ 1 plate for themselves. I'd say the size portions of a dish aren't large, but plentiful for 1-individual...for a grown man w/ a healthy appetite tho (like my Kuya, BF, or sis's BF), ladies if u want to share, order other plates else let him have his own. Food is served fresh, clean, & hot...presentation of every dish is cute w/ its own personality, but for the most part if they could stick a flower on top of the dish/drink, it got one. All entrees were scrum-didly-umptous folks!\n\nFINAL TAB: Yeah, so $335 later for a party of 8...yeah, we all looked @ each other when the tab came like \"Daayum, did we do that?\"..it was still a great birthday dinner out. Oh, don't 4get parking validation...free parking baaaby! Damn right for a $335 tab! For some a revisit, others a 1st-time...those who'd come back & others who won't hurry back. My sis won't hurry back 'cuz as far as she's concerned, she can cook most of what we ate & not have to spend that much. Typical woman in my family, or just like our mom \"Why we need to go out...I can cook that for you & even better\" (lol).

Their volcanic beef was quite enjoyable, with the right blend of sweet and salty. However, it would not necessarily be considered a crowd-pleaser in my book, as its taste, from my observations, has been received differently depending on individual preference. The kobe beef was a complete disappointment, not that its quality was lacking, but rather in how little you are actually given. As an avid male meat-eater, I found myself sobbing as I had to consume two bowls of rice to just to fulfill my appetite, something no one should ever have to go through when eating at a popular restaurant like Osha Thai. By the way, if you are on a date, you may have to speak up, as the tables for couples are unusually long, and placed just a tad bit too awkwardly close to each other, to the point where you can easily hear and get distracted by neighboring couples.", "author": "Andy W."}

I recommend getting the fish balls in your soup - not only are they tasty, they're fun to look at), we shared the beef and artichoke salad and peanut shrimp salad, and two in our party got the pumpkin curry, which I think Osha Thai specialty. Although I didn't sample it, it was beautifully presented. \n\nPlan accordingly if you're going during the lunch hour rush.

We didn't expect to get hammered, but the drinks were soooo good!\n\nGreen Tea Mojito was perfect.  Just think of the most perfectly balanced sweet, sour and minty mojito with green tea.\n\nOur favorite drink was the Ginger Zinger (Ketel One Citroen, banana liqueur, triple sec, apple juice, fresh ginger shaken and served in a martini glass.)  That's one of my all-time favorite drinks, definitely top three!  I don't even like sweet drinks (I drink Manhattans and dirty martinis), but this has just a hint of sweetness and everything just comes together.\n\nAlmost everything's a variation of a common cocktail, but with Asian Flavors.  Orchid is a lychee martini with some sweet and sour.  Lava Guava is a really good, but not too sweet tropical drink.  Tuk Tuk was a sidecar, but with fresh basil.  Balistic Basil is an appletini, but made with gin and basil.

So we went across the street and saw this place.\n\nThe restaurant looked nice and was very clean. We were greeted and lead to a table right away. The services were super attentive. \n\nOnce we got the menu, we were surprised by the high price of some of the items we regularly see on Thai places. Actually, most of dishes with ordinary ingredients runs around $10-12 which is acceptable since they are probably $1 -$3 dollars more than other places. As long as an entree comes with seafood, lamb or duck meat, the prices shoot to $18-$20. Almost double the cost.\n\nWe were like, really, what's so special about them? We were not prepared to do a $20 per person lunch anyway. So we decided to order \"crab fried rice\" which was the only one with a seafood item that cost $10 bucks. And a vegetable clay pot.\n\nThe fried rice was done decent. But there was really not a lot of ingredient besides the rice, The \"Crab\" part was actually a small piece of crab craw. The vegetable clay pot comes with fried tofu which is done nice. Some diced mushroom and greens. The broth is super salty. I had to drink a lot of water along with it.\n\nSo the food is really mediocre for the items we considered reasonable priced. Maybe those expensive dishes will be more impressive? I wondered...\n\nThe services were nice. The waiters kept coming to your table to grab anything they could take. Garbages, empty plates, dirty forks... Anything they could find and felt you no longer needed they swept away so promptly that I barely even noticed. They were indeed well trained. And probably had not much to do during weekend lunch hour when most of tables were empty. On one hand, I admired their hard-working attitude. On the other hand, I felt so much pressure that at no time during the lunch I was relaxed....", "author": "Chun L."}

They're open until 11 o'clock every night, which is SUCH a rarity in San Francisco. I've had dinner reservations at 11 in New York! What is wrong with us here that everything closes around 9?\n\nAnyhow, the hours and the service are by far the highlights of Osha Thai. The food leaves me wanting a lot more. I tried the papaya salad with shrimp and the shrimp were highly suspect. I took a bite of one, spit it out because it tasted weird, and then realized they all had a very fishy, un-fresh smell. Yuck! \n\nEverything I've had at Osha has been underwhelming. If you're looking for good thai, you simply won't find it here. To top it off, the bill is always expensive. This is the P. F.

In fact, the service here sucks.\n\nEverything i order always hits the spot. Some recommendations are: Thai spicy pan fried noodles w/ beef, Green curry pan fried noodles w/ chicken, Calamari appetizer (if you love walnut prawns, you'll love this), Crab fried rice, Papaya salad and the Sashimi salad. I'm sure everything else on the menu is great too, but i can't help it but order the same things every time.\n\nWe were here the other night celebrating a bday dinner. I believe we had a party of 14. When we arrived, they told us that we'll be separated into 2 tables. A table for 10 and a table for the leftover 4 girls. WTF. How come this wasn't mentioned when we made the reservation? How odd would it be to just have the 4 girls sit by themselves at another table when they are with us to join dinner? If they were not able to accommodate all of us to sit together, they should have told us because we could have made reservations somewhere else that can. Bullshit. \n\nWhen another waiter brought out our plates, we tried to hear what he was saying. It gets pretty loud in there, so the least he could do was SPEAK UP. I had to say \"whaaa??\" a few times and every time he repeated with the same 'i can't hear what the eff you're saying' monotone.\n\nIn the end, you're pretty much paying high prices to dine here while getting the service you get from a ghetto Chinese restaurant.

Presentation of the food was beautiful, tables and chairs were chic and modern, and there was even couchy type seating along the window wall with lush purple pillows, like they were for Sultans or something. Price was decent, certainly lower than I was expecting from an Embarcadero restaurant. The waitress had big eyes and kept pouring us water, and though I wouldn't call her very attentive to our needs, she did her job and also upheld the Osha Thai dress code: black sheer, slightly sophisticated with faint hair highlights because we're in SF after all, but with a dash of red for extra boldness, reminiscent of exotic Southeast. It's the Sultan thing again, I think, or maybe I've just been reading too many stories.\n\nWhen the flaming beef came out, it looks like a tropical bird.

I expected some mediocre-level thai restaurant...perhaps a soon-to-be 3 (maybe 4) star on Yelp.\n\nNo. Not here. \n\nCame here for a wedding rehearsal dinner and was amazed at the ambiance of this place. It was a Thursday night, so not THAT busy. We had a whole room reserved for us. All 25 or so. And trust me, we were a HUUUUUGE party. But no waiting whatsoever. We walked right in as if we were V.I.P.\n\nThey first served us appetizers. All at once it was peanuts, Fish Cakes and Spring Rolls. The peanuts were ok. Fish cakes were deep fried but still soft and nicely warm; great taste. The Spring Rolls were a PLUS as well. You can really taste the hint of mint (don't know if that's a good thing with most ppl). The appetizers were a good balance between something warm and cold.\n\nEntrees. One dish after another, it was hard to keep up with what came out next. First came the Lemongrass Chicken. Very tangy and the flavors take you on a ride. \n\nThen came the Yellow Curry. Man, I LOOOOVE ME SOME CURRY. Potatoes were in big chunks but wasn't spicy at all. I was a little sad = (.\n\nUp next, the Pumpkin Curry. Can't get enough of it. Sauce was a bit tastier. A nicer kick because of the fusion of bell peppers and curry sauce.\n\nSoon after, the Volcano Beef. Flavors erupt in your mouth (haha, see what I did there?) The meat was real tender and you can really taste that basil in the sauce. Mmmm.. Plus it looks like a volcano because of the placement of the onion rings!\n\nThen the BBQ and Crispy Pork. This was accompanied with rice and salad. Drenched in its own gravy and soy sauce, it called me out! Gotta love the BBQ and I couldn't pass it up. Nice charred yet tangy taste! \n\nFinally, the Pad Thai (WITH Prawns, to be exact). You know AND I know, I don't have to go on about how great this dish is. Flavors are so rich and tasty. HANDS DOWN, this was the champion. Out of all the dishes, I went back for seconds on the Pad Thai.\n\nAs far as I can remember, I tried a little bit of everything. It all came with rice as well. Everything was served family style. So of course it screamed big, BIG portions. And the bowls they served the foot out of, well...it's for you to see. Oh and did I mention, WE.. STILL.. HAD.. LEFTOVERS?!\n\nOSHA kinda  gave off very relaxed, sorta \"forget your worries and leave everything at the door\" kinda vibe. There's a bar tucked somewhere between the lounge/ seating area. Very dim lighting but everywhere you look, the lighting was either from the ceiling or fire displayed throughout the restaurant. Yes, FIRE (like I was on the show Survivor or something). And the decor is very contemporary.\n\nWhen parking, go toward One Embarcadero garage. If coming in the evening, trying to park on the curb gets hectic and frustrating. OSHA validates. So just to make it easier on yourself, park in the garage.\n\nLast thing I thought about when I left was what excuse can I use to come back here again. I live in the South Bay but would LOVE to return to OSHA. Thai restaurants don't come by very often like this one, I tells ya.", "author": "Will S."}

I chose Osha Thai based on the beautiful ambiance and word of mouth reviews as the location to celebrate my 30th. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the food was good too ( not great), my 2 stars- if they even deserve that is for the wait staff! Never have I experienced such blatant rudeness...I'm talking about asking for something as simple as water and having a waitress just stand there and look at you...like she's irritated you had the audacity to want to be hydrated. For the record her response to that was just walking away! The service was SO slow...I think they ignored us for the first 45 minutes. Our reservation was for 4pm, it took so long for them to take our order, we didn't leave until 7p! When we asked to speak with the manager, it took him about 30 minutes to appear...however he was very nice when I explained what was happening and offered complimentary desserts. When we asked if splitting the check for our party was an option, we again received no response just a blank stare...which led to the waitress walking away and congregating with other wait staff in a huddle by the bar.

The last thing I want is to go somewhere populated by the corporate yahoos  I'm surrounded by 9-5 (dada, thirsty bear, 83 proof-I'm talking to you) \n\nSo I head to the calming and seksi Osha Lounge. Its dark, kinda loud and has very comfy couches. Drink specials are 6 dollars for happy hour which runs from 3-10(!) Sunday-Thursday and 3-8 Friday and Saturday. Some drinks come in high ball glasses and others in rock glasses but cost the same and generally the larger glasses are a better steal. I always order the Green Tea Mojitos and the Golden Triangle but also in high ball glasses are the Thai Smile, Lime Hurricane and the Lava Guava. SKIP the margarita as I think they only put mixer and salt in a rock glass and call it a night. Beers and wells are also at a cheap price \n\nIf you are feeling snacky, the beef skewers small plate is the tastiest item from the lounge menu but I would HIGHLY recommend going for the $12 green curry pan fried which is hands down some of the best comfort food I've had in a long time. The food from the restaurant is generally hit or miss, so I'm glad to have found something delectable that only tastes better as the mojitos keep coming. \n\nThe restaurant is a whole other (meh) experience, but if I want to feel grown and seksi on my entry level budget, I'm all over Osha Thai Lounge.

The interior is beautiful, and although it was very noisy in most of the restaurant, we probably got the best table in the corner overlooking the ice skating rink and it was very quiet. Nina was our server and we really liked her, you will too.\n\nAppetizers: crispy calamari and wontons with crab and cream cheese. We've had the calamari before, and we liked it both times. The wontons were also pretty good, no complaints there.\n\nMains: we shared the Osha Sea (calamari, scallops, salmon, basically everything seafood in a curry form) which was my pick, the Kobe Beef, and Australian deep fried lamb shanks. Osha Sea i've had before and loved both times, lamb was good, not my pick but my mom and boyfriend really liked it. The kobe beef was the only let down. It was the most expensive dish by far, at $25 for 5 small pieces of beef, and it just didnt taste tender or very good at all. It wasnt gross dont get me wrong, we ate it, but it was just not what we hoped for. ok so my boyfriend who went to culinary school and has tried kobe beef from Bix where he used to work, says that this beef tasted like flank beef in comparison. \n\nDessert: Vanilla Sky (vanilla ice cream with a crispy thai roti... tasted like a fried crepe kinda) it was bomb.

One thing that really brings the rating down on this one is the service. The service and expediting in this restaurant is quite possible the worst organized and strangest I've ever experienced. The lunch time crowd is clearly very busy being right in the Financial District, so they get my sympathy for being slammed midday. However, despite knowing there is a large business lunch crowd, they do not tend to tables accordingly. There seems to be no system for checking on tables in sections and there seems to be little to no organization or supervision of the service in the restaurant either. This makes a simple, easy request, like getting your check, an ordeal. This makes the time at the restaurant so much longer too which is NOT appropriate for most business folk on lunch hour. The biggest issue for me is that they do not prepare/cook orders to come to the table at once. People receive random dishes throughout the restaurant continuously instead of 4 people at one table getting all their food at the same time. This had affected a couple of visits and one of the reasons I will usually choose not to go back here because there is no point in having your entree served to you when the person across from you does not receive theirs until enough time has passed that you could have finished your meal. They need some serious managerial organization, and with more attention to this and expediting food properly as well as checking on tables in a routine manner, they could be a MUCH better restaurant.", "author": "Thomas K."}

I understand that we were 10 mins late but you are certainly not the 5 stars restaurant in New York City so how dare you to treat customers like that?\n\nEating at Osha before used to be a pleasant experience, great food, reasonable price and very east asia cultural atmosphere. but now, employees there are no longer friendly, turning into a bunch of stuck-up rude waiters that look down on you and ignore you. F*ck that, you are not the only thai restaurant in the city. i rather take people to a hole in the wall than ever go to that osha again. and there are 10 different oshas in the city, I am not speaking for all of them but y'all should definitely stay away from the one at Embarrcadero Center 4.

It's centrally located in the Embarcadero Plaza and waterfront so there's a great view. If you come during the winter, the outdoor iceskating rink is located just out front so you can people watch if you're sitting on the patio or near a window. It's a great winter feel. And in the summer, they have the water falling from the beautiful structures out front so there's always something nice going on outside.\n\nThe inside decor is decent but plain. I've sat on the right side where there's no real ambiance and then I've sat on the left side where we got a nice bench to relax on and lots of pillows! I def like the left side better. I've been here on Friday nights where it's extremely packed. You should call ahead to make a reservation on busy nights! And I've also been here on like a Wednesday night and it was still busy but not too crowded. \n\nThe food is absolutely amazing. I suggest if you go in a group, to order as many starters as possible because they are delicious and you can split it. The entrees are great and plentiful. I always get the salmon and I'm never disappointed. And of course, gotta order the Thai Iced Tea! The wait staff is a little retarded. There were place mats for like 5 people and there were 7 of us and she didn't do the math that she needed to bring out more mats and dishes and utensils. She wasn't very attentive of us. Definitely a need of improvement on the servicing. \n\nOverall, I say come here during happy hour because there's lots of young professional eye candy here. Sit on the left side if possible because it's just more comfy and if you come on a busy night, make sure to make reservations first. And if you can't get into this one, the have 4 more locations nearby =)", "author": "Lucky N."}

Shouldn't be a problem right?  But nope, unfortunately, it was a HUGE problem.  When we got there, the table was not ready yet but they said they were going to set it up and they had us wait at the bar.  Our party of 6 were all present at the time of the reservation but we still had to wait.  First, they told us that a certain table was ours, and that we would have it in 5 minutes.  10 minutes pass and we flag down the hostess, she said there was a mix up and they would be combining two tables together to accommodate us.  Just another 5 minutes, 10 minutes pass, and we have to track her down again, she said \"oh wait, this other table opened up\" and we would have to wait for that, what did she say?  Of course, \"5 minutes\" but it wasn't.  Eventually, it took us 45 minutes just to be seated even with reservations.  Normally, I don't mind not being seated immediately even with reservations but the back and forth, untruthful claims were too much.  It became so frustrating.\n\nAnd when we thought that was the last of our issues, oh wait, there's more.  One of the place settings had no fork, the drinks took forever to come when ordered.  We practically finished our appetizer, the tuna tower (which by the way was yummy, sweet and savory in the perfect balance, tuna tartar with mango, avocado) before the water was served and it took even longer to have the drinks ordered to come and when they did come, J didn't get his drink, hot tea for another 5 minutes.  My lychee iced tea was just pure lychee syrup, ugh, and J's hot tea was basically a tiny cup of hot water with a tea bag, really? $3 for that?  You tell me, what else should i expect from a swanky spot like this but I would've been ok if the service matched the prices being charged.\n\nThe entrees were luckily decent.  All pretty tasty thai food but probably double what I would've paid in a less trendy spot.\n\nVolcanic beef - beef braised with onion rings on top, tender and flavorful\nBBQ & Crispy pork - basically BBQ pork and the fatty chicharone style pork from any chinese restaurant but served with a soy based sauce that they charge double what a Chinese restaurant would've - stay away\nHung Lay Curry - creamy and coconut based, very light and tasty, I might actually pay for this again\nHoney Duck - basically roast duck in the same mold as BBQ pork dish, could be bought at Chinese restaurant for half price\nPad See Ew - pretty good noodles, soft but firm enough that it didn't fall apart, this was the first dish to be devoured\n\nAlso, because we were 6 people, they charged auto gratuity which we refused to pay with the debacle from our reservations.\n\nIf you want good Thai food, there are dozens of other places in the city which will charge you a more reasonable price for great quality food.  Sure, it might not be in the same type of location with the same great decor but wouldn't you rather pay much less for much friendlier service with equal or better food?

It was quite loud in the restaurant, and they played really awful thai versions of popular songs, but you can look passed that if you're out with some friends.\n\nThe Tom Yum soup was really flavorful, my boyfriend even said it was the best he's ever had. I had the Tom Kha which had a really creamy coconut base.  There were some inedible pieces in there, probably the lemongrass, but overall everything tasted good. I do wish the chicken in the Tom Kha was a little less dry.\n\nThe Crab Rangoons were mediocre, in the sense that they tasted just like the ones you'd get at a regular chinese restaurant.  The dipping sauce, however, was incredible, so it made up for it.\n\nI had the Totally Scallop, and the bok choy was really delicious, not too bitter, and the scallops were cooked perfectly.  I tried the pumpkin curry with beef and it was phenomenal. The squash had a potato-y consistency, but was still so flavorful. I really recommend that!\n\nOverall, everything was fine, til the help started harassing us to pay our bill early. I guess they were switching from the lunch to dinner crew, and they basically forced us to pay early and order our drinks early.  They kept trying to get our plates off the table really quickly too.  Even though the food was really good, the service was awful just because we didn't have the time to enjoy it.  We felt really rushed.

I love the decor, it's very sleek and modern, and has a lounge feel which I enjoy. \n\nMy favorites are their Vegetarian Crispy Rolls - served with sweet chili sauce, you get three rolls halved, which I think is decent for an appetizer, and I usually order either Chicken Pad Thai or the Pan Fried Green Curry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-28", "description": "*Asian yuppie alert!*\n\nWow, seriously, Osha Thai must be the place where former Pi Alpha Phi and SOPi members from UC Berkeley and San Jose State have their reunions. I have not seen so many preppy, proper ABC kids gathered in one spot since I was in college myself ten years ago.\n\nThe only times I have patronized were for birthday parties. Although the atmosphere is quite charming, I must say that I never felt fully comfortable surrounded on each side by the hordes who seem to think 7 Diamonds and Nudies are part of the required dress code. \n\nThe type of crowd Osha Thai attracts is indicative of the place as a whole, one of the recipients of my vaunted \"iPod Award.\" What does this mean? Well, simply put, it is all style, no substance. Some people are like mindless drones so easily fooled by snazzy marketing and dolled-up packaging.\n\nSure, the decor looks somewhat fancy schmancy, but what does it add up to? The food itself is pretty mediocre Thai fare, and nothing more than you would find at your local dive in any neighborhood around the Bay. Thai food (at least these basic dishes) is not supposed to be all jazzed up. It's just well, normal food for everyday occasions. Besides, the flavor here tastes more on the Chinese side (the Pad Thai is not very spicy, and is practically like Chow Fun), and it seems they don't even bother to put a creative stamp on any of their dishes.\n\nSo, in closing, if you are a fan of Thai food, avoid Osha by all means. There is much better to be had for much cheaper elsewhere. However, if you are invited to a birthday party or some event, and just going for the company, it's not a bad place to hang out for a few hours. Just make sure to visit Brass Rail or Rolo beforehand to cop your 7 Diamonds and/or Monarchy shirt.", "author": "Eric W."}

The person whom took my order repeated my order, said I was #60, and we ended the call.  \n\nI picked up the order and when I tasted the soup, it had a mild fish taste to it.  I called the restaurant and inquired if someone orders Tom Yum and designates they would like it to be strict vegetarian if they included fish sauce the woman on the phone indicated all of their soups cannot be made without fish sauce.  \n\nWhen I returned to the restaurant, the manager refunded my money and said sorry and that was it.  When I inquired whether it was policy to inform customers ordering vegetarian dishes to tell them that they contain fish sauce, she said \"sometimes they do, but sometime they forget unless you specifically ask about fish sauce.\"  She further went on to explain that a majority of the items labeled as vegetarian all contain fish sauce and cannot be made without it in the Embarcadero & 2nd Street locations.  I find this response to be completely unacceptable and misleading to list items as vegetarian on your menu, then not only to be unable to fulfill this claim, but also to be unable to consistently inform customers that their so-called \"vegetarian\" items include fish sauce.  \n\nThis experience is in stark contrast with a recent inquiry I made to contact@oshathai.com about the offering of strict vegetarian/vegan items at Osha.  Derek Sho, who was very helpful, indicated that at his four locations (Geary, Valencia, Union, Diamond) all vegetarian items are made without fish sauce.  I don't understand why there is such inconsistency in the service between these restaurants when there is only one website and one menu for all locations.  I think it is only fair to put a disclaimer on your website regarding the Embarcadero & 2nd street fish sauce policy and also to make and enforce a strict policy to inform any customer (dine-in or carry-out) about their inability to make items truly vegetarian.", "author": "Jackie V."}

She only inquired with him about how the food was,  want anything and everything.  The food I ordered was very sweet eventhough I ordered the spicy Shrimp.  I called her back and told her what she did.  She realized her mistake and apologized.  I didnt buy her half hearted apology.  Restaurant dinning experience is not all about food, ambience,  it is about service as well.  It shows poor training and experience of waiting staff. not going back again.  My favorite Osha is on Valencia and the service is 300% better.", "author": "Sarav C."}

It was pretty good! Chicken was tender and the noodles were chewy. The only thing I didn't like was how it tasted very soy-saucey\nThe next was the Crab Pad Thai. Now I've never had pad thai with CRAB in it. So seeing that made me want to get it, especially at no extra charge. And I thought it was VERY GOOD! The crab was tender and the noodles were chewy as well! And the flavors were there. I loved the tamarind sauce in it, I could totally smell it. It was so delicious. Oh and the peanuts were on the side so I forgot to add it into the noodles :T\nAlso, we ordered a mango sticky rice for dessert. I'm not the biggest fan of mangoes so it was decent to me. They were a little underripe. And I guess I'm a little skeptical when it comes to the sticky rice-mango-condensed/coconut milk combination but I have to say it was a very unique taste.\nThe setting of the place was very fancy. I like how thai restaurants in the city are very fancy and high end but at the same time, have very agreeable prices. Very reasonable and it's a great atmosphere!\nDefinitely recommend\nOH AND ALSO. I ordered the THAI ICED TEA. And as a huge thai iced tea slut, I enjoyed it! It tasted very creamy, which I enjoy.", "author": "Johnny C."}

I believe a direct quote was \"good food, trendy setting but still cheap.\"  Sounded perfect to me, and it's also right on the way home from my gym, so we stopped in one weeknight last week.\n\nTotal disappointment.  The decor was trying to be trendy I think, but ended up erring on the cheesy side.  Service was nice and attentive, and we were seated at one of the best tables in the place, but it was still weirdly loud even though the place wasn't too packed.  We watched the bartenders measure wine pours exactly against sample glasses filled with blue liquid.  So strange, and kind of parsimonious, right?\n\nFood was also disappointing.  I had pad thai (boring, I know, but usually tasty and a good measure of a place) and my partner had the beef salad.  Both came out strangely quickly (like, maybe two minutes after we ordered?)  Portions of both were grossly huge, I guess if the food was good we would have had another meal out of leftovers but the way it tasted warm, there was no way I was eating it again a day later, much less cold or reheated.  \n\nTo add insult to mediocrity, I felt the prices were weirdly high (maybe 1.5 times the cost of the same dishes at our favorite NYC thai places, which actually are cute and trendy inside.)  I would not willingly select this place again.", "author": "Jaimie M."}

Maybe it's because we were not business people and we're young.

It took them forever to get another chair for my friend and had her stand for almost 15 minutes waiting. Drinks took forever to come and when it did, they kept forgetting a lot of them and had to tell them again. THEN, they forget someones order and while everyone had theirs, he was sitting there with no food and me being nice, =) , I decided to wait until he get his. By the time he got it, my food was cold!\n\nThe volcanic beef was good but wasn't great. Maybe it was because it got cold but for $18, I wish I got more beef? LOVED the coconut rice! I can see all the bits and pieces of coconut in there. AND it was served in a coconut shell. So cute! Fire Shooter took awhile to come and when it did, I was happy. I needed my alky..

I suppose it's because it's in the Financial District and can rely on a steady stream of lunch patrons. For the price, the quality and flavor of the food is, at best, mediocre. The serving sizes are small' especially for Thai food, which is often so generous. The service was sullen and infrequent. The cocktails were overpriced, small and uncreative. And the decor and condition of the restaurant needed a renovation years ago. They dim the lights and hope you don't notice, but this place is nothing special. All would be forgivable if the prices were halved. \n\nAnd beware vegetarians: My friend ordered the pumpkin curry with tofu, and they literally just dumped in chunks of cold, bland tofu. They didn't even fry them first. No flavor!

The Thai iced tea reminded me that I don't like Thai iced tea (I continue to try it on occasion in the hopes that the last 20 I've had were just poorly made).  Stirring the condensed milk into the iced tea did, however, yield a surprising orange color, like a sunset over a beach.

Although the two tops are a bit longer than the standard, which is a bit odd. Pretty or not, it's also an acoustic nightmare. The din from all the tables echos around, causing everyone to speak more loudly, increasing the din, in  a feedback reaction.\n\nThe real point of a restaurant is the food, and I like the food here. I've had better Thai in a few places, but not many. The food here is surely on the top end of the scale. In particular I am a fan of their tom yum, which is perfectly hot and sour and refreshing. The yellow curry here is also good, which is a good standby dish to judge a place by. I've not had Pad Thai here, which, of course, is another prime judging dish. \n\nFinally, on the point of service - it's always been friendly to me. And they are open late - 11pm, every day.

In fact, I was at this same location and ordered the same exact things 6 days prior.  Looking at the majority of reviews, there is no question that the food is good.  My personal preferences?  The Green Tea Mojito and the Honey Duck.\n\nThe problem is that the service is poor and whether it be a \"cultural issue\" or a \"language barrier\", we live in the Bay Area and good food is not hard to find by any means, so good service is critical if you expect a 5-star rating.  From me, anyway.\n\nWe got there around 6PM on a Friday night.  I thought it was odd that it was half empty especially since the ice skating rink seemed to open up that same day and had brought in quite the crowd.  They sat the four of us knowing we had one more coming and they were kind enough to set us up with a table of five.\n\nOur server's name was Suga -- yes, like \"Suga, Suga how you get so fly?\"\n\n(pausing for laughs)\n\nAs the restaurant began to fill up shortly after we sat down, she asked if she could take the extra chair.\n\nUs:  \"Well, he's on his way here now.\"\n\nHer:  \"I'll bring you another chair when he gets here.  Is that okay?\"\n\nUs:  \"Uh, sure, that's fine.\"\n\nWell, why not, right?  Seemed harmless, but when the fifth member of our party showed up, she brought over a stool -- yes, a STOOL.  Errr??\n\nDespite exchanging some weird looks around the table, we didn't let it bring us down and continued with a delicious dinner.  We placed our orders for dessert and were grumbling a little about how long it was taking.  This funny-eared fellow -- who may have been the manager or person in charge at the time -- approached our table.\n\nHim (rudely):  \"Umm, are you still waiting on something?\"\n\nUs:  \"Yes, our desserts.\"\n\nHim:  \"Well, did you already order it and everything?\"\n\nUs:  \"Yes, quite a while ago.\"\n\nAnd he walks away.\n\nOKAY.  We noticed that there was quite a wait at that point, but before you come to our table to not-so-discreetly ask us to hurry up, it is in your best interest to make sure your homegirl Suga has done HER part in attending to us... because now we're going to take our sweet time savoring our dessert just to piss you off.  Which we do.  Successfully.\n\nWhen served the check which totaled out to about $200 including the tip, we gave her $155 in cash and provided her a credit card for $45.  We also gave her verbal instructions on what we were giving her and what she was to do.  She nodded.\n\nUpon her return, my friend who paid the $45 using his credit card was given his slip to sign and, lo and behold, it's for the full total yet all the cash is gone, too.  For a $45 charge, his slip should say $45, no?  We flag down Suga but she doesn't see us (or ignores us).  The hostess approaches us and asks if there's anything she can do, so we explain the situation.  Suga comes back to the table as we're discussing and takes the check from the hostess without an exchange of more than 5 non-English words.  It appeared to us that Suga knew exactly what was wrong... or what she did.  But no harm done -- just fix it please, right?\n\nShe returns with a slip for $45.  Great.  My friend also asks for the slip crediting the first transaction of the full total.  She argues that it wasn't charged, so there was no credit.  There's a bit of back and forth and we give up and decide to take her word for it.  Bad move.  Upon checking his bank transactions, we found that the full total WAS charged to my friend's card and Osha (or Suga) also took our cash.  I'm having a hard time understanding how requests like this are never a problem at Denny's.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:  Save yourself the trouble and order for take-out!\n\nPS. The excess credit card charges are currently being disputed.", "author": "Gemma M."}

That's until you have to deal with Paul, a host or manager or whatever.  \n\nI was part of a party of 30 who had made reservations days before.  What a nightmare this manager was.  He: \n-imposed a charge of minimum $30 per person\n-required all persons must to up or be charged for each person missing\n-charged arbitrarily for the one of three bottles of champagne, not allowing the two other bottles to be opened, then changes his mind and decides to allow the other bottles but at a higher rate\n-was VERY rude, thinking he had a greater hand of cards and could come up with whatever stipulations he wanted to\n-wanted to charge $1 for every slice of the surprise birthday cake to be cut, which was no longer a surprise at that point.  \n\nThe organizer began to ask questions about some of the arbitrary #s he threw out at the last minute, and he immediately came out on the defensive, citing policies like \"We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone,\" etc etc.  Regardless, she was willing to foot the bill, however at this point the manager no longer wanted to have anything to do with her, and refused to talk to her.  What the hell!  \n\nI think it's very strange that a 'manager' would be so unaccomodating, especially to such a large group of young professionals with lots of free time and crazy ideas how to get back at this manager.  Regardless, they no longer have my business, the business of my family of which I've taken here quite often, my colleauges who we I go with almost every month, as well the business of my clients.  I guess my business doesn't mean anything to them, nor do our Yelp reviews.\n\nIn a moment of panic, we spread out and scoured Embarcadero 4.  We found Sens, who was willing to take our party of 30 in the next 5 minutes, didn't charge us any of the rediculous fees, was MUCH quieter (sometimes I can't even hear myself speak in Osha), had a fantastic menu, and had a great staff and manager.

Validation for a Saturday night was $8.  \n\nVery much what I expected for a Thai restaurant in a happening part of the city.  \n\nWe ordered:\nLychee iced tea $3, bourbon, \nMango salad $10: very good.  However, husband and I both still prefer papaya salad as it is more crunchy.  We like crunch strips of papaya over mango.\nPenang beef curry $11: beautifully presented.  I couldn't resist the urge to sample a miniscule piece of beef and dangit, this is the kind of soft stewed beef I remember.  \nPineapple fried rice $11: stellar, if a bit too \"wet,\" but perfect.  No green peas!  Yay!\nPad Thai $10: I didn't like the thinner noodles.  I prefer the medium-sized noodles.  This was husband's dish and he said the noodles stuck together.  So-so.\n\nTotal with gratuity included in the bill was just under $70 (add $8 for parking though).  A couple of bucks more per dish than other Thai restos, but you're also paying for the vibe and location, so I think it was justified.  I wouldn't come back to this location to dine with just my husband, but if there was a function going on here to which we're invited, we won't turn it down.\n\nDefinitely great tasting food here.  Our party ordered a variety of gorgeous looking dishes and they all said the food was good so I think four stars is fair.

We were so cold and asked to be moved to a table closer to the back of the restaurant however, the hostess claimed ALL the tables in the back were reserved. So she offered to move us to the table NEXT to us but the vent was directly above it and the air was blowing something fierce! So we opted to move back to our original table, teeth clattering and all.\n\nOur meal came pretty fast which was great but the dessert was another story. I had to ask twice to make sure they didn't forget we had ordered two mango sticky rices. By this point, it was 6:30 and the restaurant was just as virtually empty as when we first arrived. The so-called reserved tables were still empty.\n\nFinally, the desserts came, it was devoured and asked for the check. When the check arrived, there was a 20% gratuity included.

In hindsight, perhaps I was too hard on them? \n\nFor starters, it was going on 4:00 in the morning when I actually ate my Osha food. And I'd been on a bar crawl, drinking since about 7:30.

Secondly, a good chunk of time elapsed between when they actually HANDED me the carry-out bag, and when I actually OPENED it up to chow down. See my earlier review and my rant about cabs at bar-closing time in the TL. Grr. \n\nSo okay, the noodle dish was kinda gross. This could have been due to the fact that it got sorta cold and gelatinous, as I ran frantically up and down the street in search of that elusive yellow chariot home...\n\nI feel as though I need to give this some thought, because I ate at another Osha Thai this weekend, on the Embarcadero, and it was yummy. At the time, I didn't realize the relationship between the two (hey -- it was a rough night Friday!). And I'm still kinda stunned. Because my meal on Saturday was really, really good. I had this really delicious salad, and it had -- yep! -- noodles in it. And they were not gelatinous. Not at all.\n\nAnd, we had this heavenly dessert. A mango sorbet-thingy. On mango sticky rice.

Husband ordered ribs... he said that that was \"OK\".  We also ordered our usual pineapple fried rice... that was YUM as usual ; )\n\nGood spot for dates.... a bit on the pricey end.

Suggested this place to a friend of mine who was having a birthday party and they were able to accommodate our group of twenty on a friday evening with only a day or two of notice.  Amazing.  The food was good, a little over priced, but i'm sure rent in embarcadero center has to cost a pretty penny.  Favorite dishes: crab fried rice, sea bas w/tamarind sauce, volcano beef.  They had this amazing dish of mango sorbet over sticky coconut rice and toped with mango ice cream, but on my last visit it was missing from the menu and I had to make do with the plain old sticky rice and mango, which was delicious anyway.  \n\nAside from good food, the service is quick, there are lots of large table and the bathrooms are decent...the bathroom at the Geary location is SCARY, especially right around closing time.", "author": "Jennifer G."}

I've never been disappointed by a dish I've had here, I absolutely adore the salmon fried roll (whatever that is, I didn't catch the name) here. My main gripe with Osha is that it's high price for very small portions, I don't really think I've ever felt fully satisfied in the \"stomach full\" department here, unless I'm willing to shell out quite a bit.

Plus, it's more isolated, parking is validated, and you can walk around the embarcadero after dinner.  I like this place so much that I had my birthday dinner here last year.  You can go casual or a little dressy and not feel out of place.\n\nI would recommend:\n-angel wings, has a nice sweet sauce to it\n-vegetarian crispy roll\n-beef wasabi rolls, nice kick to it and excellent presentation\n-pumpkin curry\n-just about everything else.  I'm very impressed with at least 80% of everything I've tried there.\n\nEdit#1:  It USED TO make Top 5 on my list.  The more that I go back though, the more it slips down my list.  The staff hasn't been totally consistent.  There's one person there who I have always found to be a bit rude.  I'm not sure if it's the language/cultural barrier...  Also, it really does get too loud in there to be able to talk to the people at your table.\n\nEdit#2:  How does a place continue getting worse?  Because they can dish up really good food and have established a name for themselves, they don't care about their customers anymore?  I went to OSHA for a friend's bday party, and the manager/host was being a real jerk over some bottles of champagne that the party organizer was more than willing to pay the expensive corkage fee for.  Anyway, he was being very obstinate and pretty much refusing service, so all 30 of us had to find a new place at the last minute on a busy night.\n\nLucky for us, SENS upstairs was more than accomodating.  I think we ended up spending about the same amount on dinner as we would've at OSHA, plus we got a good view of the bridge and fireworks!

Poor communication and horrible service. \n\nAfter shopping around for locations to do a 50th birthday party we picked Osha Thai because of the private room and the prix fix menu where we were offered 2 drinks a person (instead of 1), half off for the kids under 16, and kids under 6 were free....awesome.\n\nThen I emailed the party coordinator Paul about how many drinks the kids could have and if I could show up early to blow up balloons for the party...no answer. I email again and ask him to call me. He calls and leaves a message to call back, then I do (2 minutes later), then he doesn't return the call. Then I call again, no returned call. \n\nThe day of the party, I arrive early to blow up balloons, the rude hostess tells me that the room is currently being used...fine. Then is there a place where I can blow up the balloons? She says no.  Fine, then I leave to go blow up balloons in my car. Meanwhile the guests start arriving so I head back the restaurant an lo and behold, I can now blow up balloons in another room, since my room is going to be used right up until the time it is reserved.  \n\nWe finally get to our private room and the waitresses has no idea about the agreement I had with Paul the party coordinator (about the two drinks, the kids under 16 and the kids under 6). Then Paul shows up and he seems to be surprised as well.  So I ask for a menu to order for the kids under 6...since they don't need 3 courses of food!  The waitress points to some fried rice entree and doesn't want to give me a separate menu. Apparently the servers took orders for 3 courses of food from the kids under 6 (their heads barely can see over the table). Then when the bill comes, Paul seems to conveniently forget our agreement about the pricing and starts throwing a tantrum about how I should have told the servers and the parents not to order 3 courses for the kids.  Hmm, I asked for a separate menu and was denied, not sure where I went wrong here.  After a couple rounds of heated debate Paul rearranges the bill and blames his servers for the issues...very classy.\n\nLalita Souksamlane, some advice for your Embarcadero location.  \n1. The hostess needs an attitude adjustment. I've never experienced someone so rude at a restaurant before\n2. The banquet rooms should not be reserved back to back like that. What if folks want to decorate? And if they are, both parties should know about the situation.\n3. The party coordinator should know what was agreed to for the private party (menu, pricing, etc.) and communicate that information to the staff to ensure smooth execution\n4. The dishes did not arrive at the same time.  It took about 20 minutes to serve each course. Perhaps you should reduce the selection of the prix fix menu beforehand to avoid this.\n5. Identify the person of honor before the meal. Right before the dessert was served, I had to walk the waitress to the window to point out who the birthday person was so we could deliver a dessert with a candle\n\nThis was really a sad excuse for service and by the end of it, concluded that I'd never step foot in an Osha Thai again.", "author": "Stina H."}

We had spicey peppercorn pork, volcano beef x 2, pumpkin curry chicken, pad thai chicken and pineapple fried rice. Everything was very good. My favorites were the peppercorn pork and the pumpkin curry, both of which were spicey (inhibitingly so for several others in the group). The satay appetizers, papaya salad and the rolls (not sure what they were actually) were all quite good. \n\nI do not think anything was truly exceptional, but all were above average and yummy. The service was pretty good. My water glass was refilled several times. \n\nWe also tracked down our wait staff to let them know about the bday in our party and they brought a great brownie/ice cream dessert that was wonderful (I think we did have to choose and pay for that). \n\nThe bill came to $30 per person and it covered all the drinks (only 2 or three people had wine), appetizers, 6 dishes, and the bday girls meal distributed among everyone.

I'm pretty sure that they serve the lowest-quality protein they can use without incurring the wrath of the FDA.\n\nI'm glad we started off with the drinks.  I had the lychee martini, which was curiously strong but just sweet enough that I didn't feel as though I was just downing a glassful of pure vodka.  I also tried some of my boyfriend's green tea mojito, which was disappointingly weak :\\.\n\nThen came the bad news, and not even the alcohol running through our veins could deaden the blow.  We started off with the Tuna Towers appetizer, which wasn't nearly as flavorful as I expected and the tuna was a bit fishy.  Too fishy.\n\nI ordered the Volcanic Beef since the masochist in me usually gravitates towards whatever sounds the spiciest on the menu.  It ended up being pretty much just chunks of REALLY chewy and dry meat that tasted like it should be ground up and served at Taco Bell.  The so-called \"lava sauce\" was just Sriracha, and believe me, I can identify Sriracha sauce anywhere, any time.\n\nThe boyfriend ordered Osha's Sea, and it was obvious that none of the seafood was fresh, which was ironic since we were dining about 100 yards from the ocean.  All of it looked and tasted as though it had been frozen for a while inside a Ziploc bag and not even properly thawed.\n\nThis seemed like the right time to refill our drinks and get the hell out of there.  This was definitely one of the worst dinners I've had, and it didn't come cheap either.

Minus 1 star for being a bit pricey given that it's happy hour.\n\nI had this Lava drink (Signature Cocktail). Because it was happy hour, it went from $10 dollars to $6 dollars. They had regular cocktails for $5 dollars instead of its usually $8 ish dollars. The drink was ample portion and was pretty good. I liked it.\n\nWe shared appetizers (8 each).  I didn't eat the beef sticker one, but I did eat the tuna salad one and the calamari. I thought the latter two were very good and the saucing on the tuna salad with Japanese seaweed was really good. In fact, it was very distinct and I would love to go there again if anything for that salad. The calamari was fresh and fried and crunchy. It wasn't overtly crunchy to the point of distastefulness. \n\nI was debating to give it 3 stars due to slow customer service. They also forgot 1 of our orders. However, the place was clean and the food was great. The ambiance is nice and I loved the dark shading facade within the interior of the happy hour side of the restaurant. And if this counts, the presentation of the food was great.\n\nParking: Street parking around and also private paid lot.\n\nTip: There are two sides. The one inside Embarcadero (that entrance) is the happy hour entrance. if you want regular food, you cannot enter from here. It's on the Ferry Building side. Also, they will not let you bring the happy hour food and drinks (or order them) and sit on the other side. The lighting is nice (more open space) for dining side as well, but I've yet to try it.", "author": "Tina C."}

I am usually a patient person but waiting an hour for food without any explanation or service is bad bad bad.  \n\nHere's the deal:\n\nMy party of 4 arrived around 6:30PM and we ordered drinks and food.  The appetizers arrived within 10 minutes, as well as the drinks.  They take plates and everything away...and we don't see the waitress again until I call her over around 7:20 to ask what's going on with our order.  She goes away and comes back to gives us some lame explanation of how their \"To Go\" orders are priority.  No apology, no extra service, no asking if we want to order more drinks.  Another 15 minutes pass and our food finally arrives.  \n\nAs we are eating, we realize we need another helping of rice and some more drinks.  Where is our waitress?  I actually had to get up and walk over to the manager and get her attention.  I spoke to the Manager thinking he just might remember me since we had a sit down about 2 weeks ago to discuss my rehearsal dinner.  We sat and talked for at least 30 minutes.  Did he remember me at all?  Nope!  And did he do anything when I complained?  Nope!\n\nIn the end, I decided not to order an extra dish...and to not have my rehearsal dinner there.  We never received any kind of apology.  How disappointing when their food is pretty darn tasty.\n\nI am sad Osha and left feeling like Nadia had ruined it for all of us.  Our relationship is over.

We went here for New Years Eve as part of their $60 club/lounge night. This was quite possibly the worst lounge setup I've ever had the displeasure to experience. Let's start with the fact that the dance floor was completely empty because everyone who did not have reserve seating to lay their belongings down was walking around wearing the jacket they brought in due to Decembers 30-40 degree weather. A club/lounge without a coat check is simply inexcusable as no one entered this place without a heavy jacket on. The drinks were all bottom shelf and since we couldn't dance we ended up leaving early and feeling cheated out of our $120 (pair). You are better off visiting a competing venue because this lounge was obviously poorly thought out and simply designed to milk your wallet.

When we pointed this out the hostess, she dismissed us and asked us to wait longer.  Once we were finally seated (25 minutes later), we waited 15 minutes before finally going to the bar to order drinks for our table.  The bar, by the way, is a mosh pit.  The food at Osha is great but the service is terrible. It is less awful on a weeknight and I recommend coming early (before 6:00pm) on a Friday.", "author": "Mark B."}

While I liked the bamboo-like chairs and some of the flower arrangements, I didn't like the red curtains that only covered the lower half of the tall windows combined with the gold squares on the red wall that was supposed to give this \"weathered\" look but just came across as poor workmanship, nor did I enjoy the wide tables, that made it hard to hear people in my group.\n\nAlthough we had at least 4 different waiters come by and try to take or appetizer and dinner orders, the food was pretty good and the presentation of everything, considering how quickly it came out of the kitchen, was impressive.  I got a chance to try a lot because we did it family style.  Entres enjoyed last night:  pad thai with crab, pumpkin curry chicken, yellow curry chicken, crispy spring rolls, chicken satay, pinneaple fried rice (although I've had better).  I also heard the beef artichoke salad and the volcanic beef were tasty but I gave up red meat awhile ago so none for me :~(   \n\nBy the way, the drinks were awesome!  The beers were Irish Pub tall and the cocktails were festive, artistic, tasty, and the best part potent!  I was buzzed off of half an Orange Drop.  Happy hour here in the lounge area would definitely be fun.", "author": "LaSha G."}

I liked the decor, it was contemporary, but there were still many Thai decorations.  I thought it was really cute too how the waiters and waitresses dressed the same, a black shirt and tie.\n\nI started off with a lychee martini, which was tasty.  Then we had the dressed prawns and tuna tower...yummy!  I could eat that all day.  The beef wasabi rolls and the Bangkok roti was pretty good.  I was disappointed with the papaya salad though, the flavors weren't as intense as it should have been.  It was, I'm sorry to say or no offense to anyone, Americanized.  \n\nIt was a bit of a challenge to get in and out of our seats since they had rattan/wicker chairs all lined up side to side at the table.  The chairs are comfy though.\n\nOverall, the service and the ambiance were above average.  The food...it really depends on what you order.  It really is more of a Thai fusion restaurant, so I would not order traditional Thai dishes there, unless you don't mind Americanized Thai food.  This is a place I would come to for happy hour or to get drinks and a few small bites to eat.", "author": "Sandy J."}

My good friend took me here for a birthday dinner and christmas dinner get together for the first time with some of our other good friends. The staff was very accommodating to our party as we had about 15 at our table. Service is fairly quick, even on a busy night. They have many tables in the room as well as some cool couch settings on one side of the restaurant. \n\nNow for the food, lets get started.  Appetizers, main course and dessert. You must do it all. Wasabi beef rolls, tango prawns and the lamb & chicken satay are great appetizers. Thai fried rice, pad thai, lemon grass chicken, prawns in clay pot and many more will fill you up. You can't leave without having dessert. Sweet sticky rice w/mango tops it off. A dinner date, or a small celebration, this place is great. Parking is awesome too as it is validated for a discounted price. Going during the Christmas season is really nice. Ice skating rink is setup right in front at Justin Herman Plaza. Or you can walk the Center and checkout the Christmas decor at the Hyatt. Embarcadero Center has been one of my favorite places to go since I was a kid. This Osha Thai is definitely in the right place.", "author": "Ryan B."}

However, it has gotten a bit too discovered as of late and the service levels have denegrated (although the food is still excellent).\n\nI was elated when I noticed this new location at the Embarcadero Center.  We first went there last fall, when it first opened.  It had the same great food, and the decor was still cool (although not uber-cool, like its 2nd street counterpart), but it was pretty empty, even for a Friday night.  I actually initially preferred the other spot and put up with the crowd, since this location was a bit too dead.\n\nRecently, it seems that this spot has become more discovered, which is great.  Also, it hasn't been overdiscovered, so the service levels here are still quite high.  I'd think that if it starts becoming too busy, they should open up a 3rd location in the area.  With so many Osha Thai's opening up in the city, I think they're going for the Starbucks concept (a location on every corner).  All they need now is the wifi, and for my normal Starbucks-type caffeine fix, I can get the delicious Thai iced tea.\n\nBut, I digress.  I think that the food is quite excellent.  Some of my favorites include the Tom Yum soup (the best I've ever had anywhere, just don't get it too spicey), the curry dishes (favorites are the green curry and the pumpkin curry), the pad thai (get it with tofu or chicken, don't get it with crab meat), and the brown rice.  \n\nI think that Osha just takes Thai cuisine to another level, combining sheek, Manhattan-like design (think meatpacking district) with San Francisco Asian-food expertise.\n\nThe only Asian restaurant that I've EVER been to that was better was Tao in Vegas.  I actually think that Osha Thai has better food, but the nightclub with scantilly clad models put Tao over the top.  Perhaps this can be the next concept for Osha Thai.

Depending on what you order, the food can be pretty good or...wth? I could have gotten this at a chinese fast food restaurant. \n\nAppetizers:\nThai samosas were okay but comes with a deliciously, sweet dipping sauce.\nTuna towers was a flavorful tuna tartare with a kick of spiciness and goes well with the fried wontons.\n\nDishes:\nDuck curry (can choose level of spiciness): made differently both times we came here. Apparently, they add grapes sometimes...or they just forgot to the first time? You can't go wrong with this dish....crowd pleaser for everyone!\n\nPad Thai portions are REALLY generous (could serve 2!) and very tasty when you mix in the noodles with the bean sprouts and peanuts. \n\nTried a special called \"savory chicken\" and the description sounded complicated and unique....but it turned out to be Hainanese chicken rice http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainanese_chicken_rice", "author": "Nancy C."}

To start we ordered the seafood combination sweet and spicy soup to split and I ordered the Peppered Lamb. \n\nAfter ordering I looked over and started making small talk by admiring the hand carved wooden elephants sculpture made of one piece of wood.

I looked really good and believe me it was. I highly suggest ordering it. The seafood soup had a really refreshing flavor and it had the perfect combination of coconut milk and spices.\n\nThe lamb was a different story. It was mild in flavor compared with the superb soup and it was kinda overdone. I'll give this place the benefit of the doubt though.

When the food finally arrived, the lovely waitress simply apologized for the utter lack of spice and brought a rack of sauces.  Anything added to a dish after it's prepared cannot possibly be as thoroughly integrated.  Not to mention the mess one would make if one tried to stir it into the dish on the plate very well.\n\nThe dish itself was okay, but nothing to note.  They were out of the first TWO appetizers we ordered. ( WTF?)  Then the first ones were served.  But we were told they were out.  Huh?  It seems the kitchen needs to communicate to the waitstaff more.\n\nOne of our party ordered the Kobe beef.  Sadly, this arrived 15 minutes before any of the other, non-meat dishes.  After some minutes, we encouraged her to eat it before it got cold as we did not know when the rest of the food would arrive.  She was almost finished when the rest of our entr\u00e9es arrived.  I'm told the beef was good, but she would have liked to eat with the rest of us.  Since when does it take longer to make vegetarian phad Thai?

Quite \"authentic.\"  \n\nThe pricing is a little stupid, to boot.  This is doubtlessly a reflection of the terrible case of affluenza that is readily apparent.  Eight dollars for a Guinness?   Twelve dollars for middling phad Thai?  Um, okay.\n\nI've eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants over the years.  I will not return to this one.  Restaurants that focus almost entirely on the look of the place, while neglecting the food and internal operations, are not a place at which to eat.  Restaurants are, by definition, intended to be about the food - it's where you eat!  If the place looks nice, that's a collateral benefit.

On both my dinner and dessert plates, the appropriate sauce was somehow swirled about the plate to craft different designs.  It was almost guilding the lilly, but it was also symbolizing the location's \"new wave\" style.  Definitely awesome.\n\nThings got more crowded about half way into our meal, which was just fine considering all the talking we did!  But I'm glad we left when we did because we were practically yelling towards the end; picture a dance where you must yell if you wish to be heard.  Not a problem, though, especially since all of San Francisco is right outside!\n\nSome dishes are more expensive than others, but it is possible to get a meal and [non-alcoholic] beverage for under $20.

I've been here a few times and haven't had a bad meal. It's a bit overpriced but you're probably paying for the ambiance.\n\nThis Osha location is VERY busy at lunch during the weekdays as it's filled to capacity with business professionals. Evenings are usually a bit less hectic. \n\nI especially love the fact that they carry Blue Hawaiian beer - I don't know anywhere else that has it around here.

Despite the fact that it was packed (lunch time in FiDi, typical!), we were seated right away at the bar.  Unsure of what to order, portion sizes, should we get alcohol at lunch?!, we dove right in and ordered 2 Thai iced teas, a spring roll appetizer, and pumpkin curry with rice to share.\n\nOk, so that was even too much food for 2 of us.  But I didn't want to STOP eating because it was so delicious.  Pumpkin curry?  Who knew such a combination could be so splendid!???

There were four of us, dressed in hiking attire more or less, it was about 7:30, and it was close to 80 degrees outside.  Amazingly, there was one open table outside (out of only about eight), and the hostess agreed to seat us there because the people who had reserved it hadn't shown up.  A great start to the meal.\n\nAs a fairly frequent patron of the Union Street location, I was surprised to see a slightly different menu at this spot.  Nothing bad, just different.   The dish I was planning on ordering (Chicken Brown Rice Claypot) was not on this menu, but that was fine.  We all shared a Green Papaya Salad and Fresh Spring Rolls to begin the meal, then each ordered our own entrees.\n\nMy boyfriend's parents like their food spicy, so when they ordered, the waitress asked them if they meant \"Asian spicy\".  They said yes, and their food came out super spicy.  They loved it, as their faces turned red and they shoveled down rice and noodles to quell the spiciness.  Super spicy is not for me, but if that's what you're into, they'll do it here!\n\nA great meal, made even better by the fact that I sat outside in shorts and a tank top until about 9pm.

Having dinner with people who eat the way you do and don't judge you when you shovel awesome food into your mouth, ROCKS.\n\nAfter a long day of flying, I met up with Gabi and Jeffrey for a quick walk from our hotel to Osha in the Embarcadero. I was really impressed with the way in which we were greeted, warm and friendly. Good thing Gabi is such a great planner and made a reservation, the place was pretty packed. We decided with a big workweek ahead to avoid the alcohol and opted for green tea. They had a nice selection of cocktails and wine though, and if I went back I would definitely partake in their bebidos. \n\nWhen Gabi and I go out to eat, it's a culinary experience. Neither of us is very picky, so we usually each find an appetizer and an entr\u00e9e that sounds really good, and then just split 'em. I'm a guy who likes to have options, so the system is perfect, and Jeffrey, though dining with us for the first time, fit right in. We wound up with Thai Samosas, Soft Shell Crab Summer Rolls, Ginger Beef, Pumpkin Curry Chicken, Spicy Eggplant and a Beef Skewer. Everything was downright (near) perfect. Highlights included the Samosas, the Spicy Eggplant with chicken, and the beef dish. A definite bust, the Summer roll, which was not exactly what we were expected and was a bit too heavy for our group. \n\nWe cam pretty close to finishing everything, which given the portion size was quite a feat. Gabi usually doesn't eat her share, but Jeffery went belly to belly with me. I could get used to dining in a trio!

It was a little weird too sitting where we were because there was this group of ladies standing where you are greeted when you walk in and I genuinely felt like I was in a nail salon where the women are standing in a corner gossiping. \n\nOne big mistake? The bathrooms. Some of the grossest bathrooms I have seen in the city. My god have they heard of cleaners? And do they know how to refill the toilet paper seats? Or pick up? I went in there twice and both times were horrific. The second time some two ladies who worked there were in there. One was \"cleaning.\" The other walked out of the stall and walked out of the bathroom, WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS. I dunno if she deals with food or not but if you are working for a restaurant for god sakes wash your hands! Mind you she did walk back in and started talking to the other girl \"cleaning,\" but who knows if she washed her hands.", "author": "Diana R."}

The fresh spring rolls were very bland and I would not recommend them.\n\nWe then followed the yelp reviews and had the crab fried rice (so yummy, succulent, not too greasy, great flavor) and the pumpkin curry with chicken (also flavorful).

So I was happy that on our free night I took the Office to Osha per my friend's request. I loved the ambiance, and I had heard it was a chain around SF, so I was a bit weary. I always want to find the hole in the walls ya know, especially if we're not there for long. But we were served almost immediately and started with some appetizers and drinks. I had the lychee martini, and most of the others had the pineapple drink as well as the chocolate martini.  All were very tasty, and the price was about what we expected.  The appetizers we ordered were the Vegetable Crispy Rolls, Tom Yum soup and Thai Samosas.  All were really good.  I personally ordered the samosas, and I thought they were tasty though my coworkers begged to differ. \n\nI then ordered the Pad Thai with prawns - kind of plain and usual, I know, but I was really just craving it! But the prawns were awesome, and I don't get the freshest of seafood in Houston, so I was impressed.  Husband ordered the Peppercorn Pork for takeout earlier in the week and then the Lemongrass Seabass which came in a clay pot. Since he is not currently a Yelp. fanatic, I will post his findings for him. He enjoyed the Peppercorn Pork but could've ordered something else in place of the seabass.  \n\nBut we all had a great time, great service and great food. I recommend for all.", "author": "Jen T."}

You know, the one that threw out dishes as fast as you could order them?  Maybe I'm dating myself by claiming to remember those days of the hole-in-the-wall Osha.  I have been to a few of these hip Osha's dotting the city, but I'm still having a hard time getting used to them.\n\nAnyhow, we went here because we ignorantly tried to walk-in at Slanted Door at 9pm on a Thursday night only to be rejected.  Osha happened to be the closest Asian restaurant around.  We ordered the Osha Fresh Spring Rolls and a Crispy Duck Salad first and next thing we know they were outta the kitchen before we got our entree orders in!  I was getting a little leery that they had trays of buffet food in the back!  Thankfully though the Spring Rolls didn't taste like they were made far in advance.  The Crispy Duck salad had a generous portion of duck, but was not crispy and the salad dressing was so strong and way too salty though.\n\nThe entrees (thankfully) took longer to come out, hopefully a sign that my buffet warming trays in the kitchen thoughts are false.  The Volcanic Beef was tasty, a good complement to rice, though the onion ring garnish was very gimmicky and offered nothing to the dish...they weren't even good onion rings!  Yellow Chicken Curry was watery and bland, there are much better Thai curry choices in SF.  The Pad See You noodles were good until you got to the beef which tasted like they were cooked separately with no seasoning then mixed into the noodles.  \n\nOverall the restaurant is beautiful, service is efficient, food is very edible and prices are decent.  I'm pretty sure I would go back out of convenience.  One thing I found strange though was being served rice on a plate with a fork and NO knife.  Isn't it a requirement to have a knife and fork, especially with rice???  I had to ask for the knife and was given a quizzical look, am I the odd one?", "author": "Edgar C."}

So we ordered their new item on the menu and waited much too long for the four pieces of lobster ravioli.  Yes, they were tasty ... but for $13 ... 4 small pieces of lobster ravioli after a long wait wasn't that great of an experience.  Then we waited another long time for our entree of Diced Salmon curry with green beans.  It was good ... a bit too rich though ... and I'm certain the salmon was farmed salmon because the color wasn't very pink.

The Thai Iced Tea came in this tall glass and was a steal at $2. However, my friend had a little trouble drinking out of the glass with a straw...because with the height of the glass and the table, everything the whole thing was above her mouth level. Get it? and don't get me wrong...she's a tall girl and everything.\n\nThe Pad Thai was presented beautifully, with a nice flower and green onion pieces sticking out of it. However, the taste of the dish was average at best - sticky and slightly sweet. However, the pad thai contained rectangular blocks of tofu had this really strangely sweet taste to it that I did not like at all.\n\nMy friend's Green Curry Noodles were sooo soo good. So good, in fact, that we started dipping the Pad Thai Noodles in the Green Curry Sauce. However, be warned that the dish is pretty damn spicy...and the type of spiciness that kinda gives you a good lingering kick at the end of each bite. \n\nOh and another plus - they refilled my water glass like crazy during the meal and the water had no ice, so it was easy to drink. The price is pretty average for a place like this - it's going to cost you a little more for an upscale-looking restaurant.

Only good thing was that when we moved to a table in the restaurant  they moved the bill over no problem.  The service at the table was better.  My customers arrived and ordered a curry dish and pad thai.  They did not comment on it but ate the whole thing so presume it was good.  I think that the bar area was just not staffed at the mid afternoon hour.   At they table the food came quickly, but they did not offer to refill our beverages and the glasses had so much ice in them it seemed like only a few sips and it was gone.  We got a nice round table which was perfect to conduct a conversation - most of the tables are rectangular.  Noise level was fine as it was mid afternoon.  I would only return here if I had a conference to go to and had a mid afternoon meeting I wanted to take off site from the conference - the food is definitely not the attraction here.", "author": "Sandra M."}

That being said, here goes. I'll start first with the things I love. The quality of food is excellent, service is good, and the location is fantastic. Unfortunately, the two-star deduction is for the quantity of food compared to price. I'm not dumb; I realize this is the Embarcardero. I understand that prices are inflated compared to the rest of The City but c'mon! This is ridiculous. I spent $16 on a bowl the size of a mug of mixed seafood tom yum. The same priced bowl of soup was quadruple the size at their 3rd Street location. The sticky rice pudding was delicious but once again, it was half the size compared to it's other locations. Long story short, I think it's a great restaurant if you like paying good money for little food. My best advice: go to one of their other locations. You'll get more food for your dollar!", "author": "H B."}

Boy were we disappointed.  We ordered the yellow sea, a yellow curry with prawns, salmon, scallops, calamari and crab claws and the garlic pepper lamb, a deep-fried rack of lamb.  The lamb was good, but was a pretty small portion.  The yellow sea....  it was bland and there were no salmon or scallops to be found anywhere.  And because of the egg in the dish, the texture was a bit icky.  The portion was small as well.  Normally, when we go to Osha, we end up having leftovers or we feel so ill from stuffing our faces with all that good food.  Not here.  We left hungry and ended up grabbing another bite to eat on the way home.\n\nAlso, our server did not seem to have received proper server training.  B had ordered a second glass of wine during our meal but didn't receive it until he was done eating - it took her about 15 minutes after he requested it to come back and find out exactly which wine he wanted.  She did bring out glasses of water for us, but it was AFTER our dinner plates had been cleared (Being content w/ our wine, we hadn't requested any water during our meal, so it was just bizarre that they would be brought out when we were done eating).  Also, after receiving our glasses of water, it took her about 20 minutes to finally come by to ask us if we wanted to dessert.  I was amused by all of this, but B was not. She wasn't unpleasant, she just didn't seem to be all there.\n\nThat being said, since I now work near the Embarcadero, I plan to check it out at lunchtime.  I'm sure standard fare such as the fried rice or noodle dishes will be just fine.  Hopefully service will be much faster.", "author": "Lisa C."}

The atmosphere is chic, and if it isn't busy, would probably be a good place for a date (followed by a long walk on the Embarcadero).  On this evening, however, they were busy, and my dining companion and I were seated at a table squished in between two other tables... not the best for enjoying a relaxing dinner.  Minus one star for cramped seating arrangements. \n\nThe food, I must say, was delicious. We shared the Angry Prawns (including sauteed eggplant... sweet and spicy in one! and... the eggplant was cooked to perfection without being mushy.  There were 5 good-sized prawns) and the Spicy Noodle dish.  Plenty of food for two.  The noodle dish was not as spicy as I would have liked, but this may be the fault of my overly cautious friend who has lost his taste for fire (we ordered it medium).  The chicken was high quality and there were lots of fresh veggies mixed in.  Dessert was especially fantastic!  Fried bananas with coconut ice cream that they actually have delivered from Thailand. The ice cream contains coconut, tapioca, corn and mint.  Yes, odd, but fabulous.  Price wise, the food is reasonable if you share a couple of dishes.\n\nSo why 3.5 stars?  They didn't have coffee (yes, they had Thai Iced Coffee, but no coffee otherwise), and I felt that the drinks were overpriced. It is the Financial District, but 8.50 for a small well vodka and diet coke?  Additionally, all beers on draft are $8!  Including Heineken and Sierra Nevada.  Boo.", "author": "Jenni D."}

I had originally made reservations at Ana Madera, but the Mrs. wanted to go somewhere she knew had good food - as opposed to somewhere fancy and food unknown (reviews were good).\n\nWe've been to Osha a number of times for lunch (2nd st mainly) and have no complaints - great food and reasonably priced. But this was the first time we've ever gone for dinner.\n\nIt's definitely more subdued at night (as opposed to the hustle and bustle lunch crowd), but it's definitely not a quiet restaurant. The lighting, the way the place is done up...very nice.  It wasn't particularly romantic (house music gently played in the backgroud), but it's our 9th anniversary, so we're all about the grub and service tonight.\n\nThe appetizers were fantastic! We had the calamari and the chicken/pork satay...yummy! The time between getting our appetizers and main dishes was a good \"minute\", but the appetizers (and drinks) kept us occupied. They were about 2-3 minutes away from me saying something, so they played it close : )\n\nWe had the Pineapple Fried Rice and the Pad See You  (chicken). The PFR was kind of greasy, but still very good. Huge shrimp and big chunks of pineapple. The PSY was fantastic! The dish is a cross between chow fun (mainly because of the flat rice noodles used) and pad thai.\n\nThe waiter was great and on top of his game....always made sure our drinks were filled to the rim. He even took our picture for us (the first attempt he accidentally turned the camera off and he was kind of embarrassed...\"dude, you're asian...you should know how to work these things\"... I'm asian, so yes I can say that : ) )\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this place for dinner. It's a great spot for a first date, anniversary or a casual get together with friends.

We had reservations but almost lost them if we were there a minute later. Seeing that the line was almost out the door, I can't blame them. Situated on the edge of the Embarcadero Center 4, Osha Thai is a popular dining option among the Financial District lunch crowd. \n\nOsha Thai offers a wide range of Thai dishes at very reasonable prices. It errs more on the trendy fusion side of things but still offers some semi-authentic Thai cuisine. The place is perfect for sit-down lunches and dinner with large parties, and nothing else. \n\nThe Embarcadero location seems a bit different from the other Osha Thai location in the Mission - more bare-bones (in terms of interior design) and much louder. Service was sub-optimal (they forgot one of our orders and my colleague didn't get her food until after we had finished eating). Overall, Osha Thai is a good option to satisfy the masses.", "author": "buggy b."}

You can however, make a reservation at 11:55am I kid you not. Service was better than my Osha dinner experience on Second but again, I did find it often difficult to flag down our specific waiter because no other person would serve you if it wasn't his/her table. \n\nOne more star for this location because their service was better and they stuck to the 11:55am reservation.", "author": "Yosie G."}

Better service, higher quality ingredients (relative to other cheaper Thai places), and better Thai Ice Tea.\n\nI don't know why, but I think the Thai Iced Tea made my stomach hurt and sort of ruined my meal.  I can usually drink it just fine, but I felt like Osha's Thai Iced Tea had too much cream.  It tasted pretty good after we finished our meal when the ice melted and diluted the drink.\n\nPad Thai wasn't good.  Whatever.  Don't go to an expensive place to order Pad Thai.  I just was stupid and curious.\n\nGreen Curry Fried Rice was good.  Bamboo shoots and green beans in it . Love having more vegetables!\n\nTom Kha Soup was also delicious.  Forget the chicken, it was dry as fuck.  I hate that.  Why do all places make the chicken so dry?  Stick with seafood.  The flavor of the broth was freaking spot on though.  Loved it.\n\nCan't even remember the other dishes we ordered, so that tells you something.\n\nI was there on a Sunday at 11 am, when it was totally not busy.  But I felt like the service was kind of out of sync.  They were bringing out appetizers even before they took our lunch orders, so there was absolutely no space to put down the plates since our menus were out.  I understand that they forgot at first, but why didn't they clear it before they brought out the other three plates of appetizers?  I just expected more.  Other than that, the service was what ever.  They need to step it up a little bit, especially since the place was so empty.  And why did they just bring us the check without asking if we wanted dessert?   Bullshit\n\nProbably wouldn't go back often since it's $5 more expensive than King of Thai and the quality isn't so much better than I would pay $5 for anything.  \n\nDecor is really nice though.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-15", "description": "Ambiance: Between this one and the two other Oshas I've been to (SOMA and Mission), this one clearly drug up the rear. It still had a bit of that flair with the fancy decor but it seemed to fall short of expectations. It seemed to lack a bit of cohesion and flow, which the other locations have.\n\nService: We were promptly seated and the server took our order quickly. We kept a menu to order an additional item as we fell short in quantity (we ordered family style). As our food was brought out by runners, we asked one of them if we could order something else. He said sure and went to grab our server. And then we never saw our server again, until she showed up with the check, replete with an automatically tabulated 20% gratuity. Okay, I understand that gratuity is automatically added to a table of 6, but I am I wrong to expect our server to actually show up once in a while to earn that 20%?\n\nFood: It was a mix between average and good. The pork belly with stick rice was excellent. The meat tasted about right to what one would expect from fatty pork belly and the sticky rice in the egg roll shells were a good touch. The duck curry disappointed a bit; the duck was not up to par with several other, much less expensive Thai places around the Bay. The rest of the plates were your average Thai fare.\n\nConclusion: Osha tends to be more expensive than the places I go to outside the city. You're paying a bit extra for the trendy atmosphere, location, and well, the \"healthy SF\" tax embedded into the cost of the food. Unfortunately, the service at this location makes me think I got gypped out of my money. I think I will stick to the SOMA and Mission locations from here on out.", "author": "Calvin L."}

Tucked neatly at the Embarcadero w/ the perfect view of the Bay Bridge on a crisp fall night(that in itself scored major points in my book) topping off w/ modernly chic interiors.  We're already off to an excellent start.  :)  Hostess offered seating for inside or out in the patio - we opt for inside but I'd imagine on a warm day, it'd be lovely to be sipping drinks out on their patio.  \n\nMy companion ordered the Garlic Pepper Lamb for me and I chose the Prawns Claypot for him to check out.  Presentation is key...so as soon as my dish came out - it definitely caught my attention.  Not to mention the alluring aroma as well.  Well marinated rack of lamb is fried to perfection (i thought the meat literally melted in my mouth) served w/ black pepper garlic sauce.  The flavors of the lamb hit all the right notes in my taste buds and all screaming for more after the first bite.  It was then I *knew* why it was my companion's fav dish there.  And fear not, even though it was fried, it did not tasted heavy or greasy at all.  Perhaps the refreshing salad and rice on the side helped.  ;)  My companion's dish arrived in a sizzling hot claypot cooking the ridiculously HUGE river prawns, silver noodles and vegs served w/ rice.  He claimed it was tasty but I don't think it beats out his lamb.  Ah well, I tried...\n\nGenerous portions for both dishes which is always a plus.  Yummy Thai Iced Tea - not overly sweet unlike most places.  Service was excellent - our glasses of water were never empty despite being a busy Sun night.  I'd definitely come back to check out more...or maybe their lamb again...because that single dish itself is more than enough to be bringing me back.  ;)", "author": "Vivian W."}

The Pad Thai was good.  None of the flavors overpowered anything else and had a nice balance.  The Scallops were ok... I was expecting like 4-5 U-10 scallops for the price, but I got 5-6 much smaller grilled scallops.  The flavor was good, but I asked for the dish to not be spicy and it had a lil more kick than I wanted.  \n\nAll in all it was a decent meal that was definitely enhanced by the company I was with and the conversation.

Aside from the greasy and cloyingly sweet dishes, another reason we won't return is Osha Thai's deceptive billing practices. Be sure to check your bill if you split the bill with others.

The thing that stops me from giving 4 stars, though, is the service. I've eaten here quite a bit because it is close to work and two things strike me as ruining their service: 1) they don't seem to think that you might want a second drink and 2) they don't bring everyone's food out at the same time.  Now that second point might not be such a killer if they were within a few minutes of each other but a few times now we have waited over 10 minutes for someone's food after others have been served.  If you're in polite company, that means most people's food is going cold.  And really, that's just a fundamental of any good sit-down food service.\n\nOn one particularly bad trip we had a party of three. There were 10-15 min between each of the first, second, and third person receiving their entree.  When a woman in our party complained they called her \"sir.\"  Twice.  She's not manly or a tranny or anything like that.\n\nThe drink thing is just my pet peeve.  And at $10+ per drink, it's within the server's interest to keep them coming.

You can also order main entrees in the lounge but the tables are small so may be hard to eat. Anyhow for the restaurant part, the food is good. It's always what we expect at OSHA. I think the Thai flavors are all there so it's decent. However they are very busy and it seems like they are short staffed all the time. We waited forever for someone to acknowledge us at the door, then we were seated and ignored, took forever for our waiter to come and then took forever to get the check. Overall three stars because food and drinks were fine but service not so fine .", "author": "Judy C."}

I just assumed the menu would be the same for both areas. \nIt just so happens that on the particular night we chose, there was a private party in the lounge- which made it pretty crowded which led to no available seating. We decided to sit at the bar in the restaurant. \nWhen we requested a HH menu the server just said, \"its only available in the bar\"... our response, \"we are sitting at the bar\". He then specified, \"the other bar\". \nMy Friend then asked why it wasn't available in both areas, that isn't made very clear- I could tell the server was getting uncomfortable but the questions we had were completely valid. \nWe settled with the regular menu and ordered some wine and food. \nThe food was really good, albeit, served incredibly fast- how did they possibly have time to cook that stuff!?

I loooove Osha Thai, but I was thoroughly disappointed by the service that the host and hostess gave me, which leads me to the one star given to this location.  \nGranted, it was the night of the Forth of July but they weren't super busy at all as they usually are.  Three of us walked in and the hostess said that there was no table available at the moment, but we could wait at the bar.  Meanwhile, four-person table opens up and they seat a four person party who came in after us.  \nSo, I'm thinking...okay, she's busy, she probably forgot about us.  I went up to find her to ask her how much longer it would take.  \nInstead, a bald host approached me and I explained the situation only for him to tell me, \"You should wait for her (the hostess) and ask.  Now, CAN YOU GET OUT OF MY WAY?\".  Excuse me?  Did I really hear that?  Um...okay.  Maybe it was a language barrier that he did not know how to politely ask me to step aside so he could help another customer.  Whatever.  Learn some manners!  I'm a paying customer...\nANYHOO...I won't bore you with further details, so I'll speed up to the end.  We were done with our dinner, waiting for our check.  The hostess comes to our table and asks us if we could finish up at a smaller table (The table was for two.  There were three of us...).  WHAT?  We were just waiting for our check and you are going to make us move because your wait staff is taking a long time to give us our check?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-05-07", "description": "I've been MIA from Yelp for a long time, because work has been so busy.   After my experience from lunch here today, I have to get a review out on this place - it's my duty as an Elite Yelper.  \n\nI'm really on the fence between giving this place 2-stars vs. 3-stars.  I went with 2.4stars for now, because I chalked my first experience here to sub-par service.  Here's a brief summary of my reasoning:\n\nWent here today with some colleagues for birthday lunch.  Heard great things about this place, so I was expecting a lot.  There were six of us and we ordered 6 plates.  The waiter asked us if we wanted to eat it family style (i.e., everyone shares everything ,rather than individual lunch plates) since we had a large party and we all agreed.  He NEVER pointed out to us that the price would be different ,and there was NO indication on the menu that this would be so... but more on that below.\n\n-First started off with some beef appetizer, which they only gave us 5 pieces, even though there were 6 of us.  It would've been nice if the waiter had pointed this out to us when we ordered (doubtful he even knew about this - really should though.. .. points off right there. .but no one is really keeping track of points).\n\n- Food is good, definitely congrats to the chef and kitchen staff.  This food is delicious and every plate we had (pad thai w/ prawns, some beef dish, lemon-grass chicken, pumpkin curry, pineapple fried rice) was tasty and filling.\n\n- Price - unusually high.  What really pissed us off is we were given our  bill, and the waiter said that there's a $5/plate additional charge for having it \"family style because the portions are bigger\"... The portions were at most maybe 1/4 more than usual.  But adding on an additional $5/plate is just ridiculous.  \n        There was NO indication anywhere of this on their menu, and the waiter never informed us of this at any point when we ordered.  Hella points off for that.  We told him that they could not charge us for that, because it was his mistake, as well as the restaurant's - not ours.  After several minutes of fumbling around with the manager and/or hostess, our waiter came back with our revised receipt.  The corrected receipt went from ~$130 down to ~$98, $30 difference is substantial.  And of course, this already included an automatic 18% gratuity charge.  Tip would've been less if it was up to us.\n\nOf course to add insult to injury, the staff told us next time that we need to ask if there's a difference in prices for having \"family style\".  That was a very retarded comment, considering it's their job to know the prices and policies of their own restaurant.  In addition, if it's not stated anywhere on the menu, and the waiter does not make us aware of these different pricing policies, patrons should not have to assume anything... I would think that's just common sense. \n\n- Wait staff definitely need to work more on their knowledge of pricing and policies.  I gave them 2-stars because of the waiting and bill, not because of the food. \n\nSo in summary, the food is tasty & delicious, the staff seems to need to work on their knowledge of the menu and pricing policies.  Above all else, double-check the charges on your bill, because chances are, they might add additional fees on there that you might not be aware of.  Would I eat here again?  Probably because the food is good, but I definitely would scrutinize every item charged on the bill.", "author": "Minh V."}

The staff is rude and offensive, and refuses to help customers.\n\nI was supposed to have lunch with my friends at Osha Thai today, but I was running late, so I asked them to order for me. When I arrived, I asked the person at the door to show me the way to my party. He told me to write my name on the list. I explained that my friends were already seated and gave him the name on the reservation. He told me that there was no one by that name there, and that there were no large parties in the restaurant. I tried to explain again, but he turned his back on me. At this point I tried to find my party myself, but couldn't see them, so I asked the host again. He kept ignoring me. That seemed odd, since service people are usually polite and helpful, so I thought that he probably just couldn't understand what I was saying. I have an accent, he had his own accent, and it was loud in the room. So, I asked whether he could understand my English, and requested that he call somebody else who could understand what I was asking better. He replied, \"This is fucking rude, bitch.\" I was so shocked, I asked to speak to the manager. He told me that he was the manager.\n\nI would have left and never eaten there again, but my friends were waiting for me. I finally called them, and they explained that the restaurant has a back room for large parties. When I sat down, I asked our waitress to get the manager, but he never came.

He finally admitted he was \"new\".  (New to what?  Remembering 3 dishes?)\nWe ordered an appetizer, the lamb and chicken satay; a curry dish (pumpkin-chicken) and the sea bass. Everything came very quickly and all at once leading me to believe it had been prepared earlier and been sitting around.  When I tasted the dishes,  my suspicion was confirmed.\nThe lamb/chicken satay was virtually unedible.   The entire dish tasted like it had been sitting under a heat warmer for an hour or two.  The lamb was tough and were presented as blackened little unrecognizable balls.  They were so tasteless that they could have been anything.  The chicken, recognizable as such only by the difference in color from the lamb was dry and leathery with no taste.   No amount of peanut sauce could make these edible.\nThe sea bass (a $20 dish), while looking like a beautiful thick piece of fish, turned out to be overcooked, tough and already cold by the time we got to it.  It was presented on bed of cold insipid Chinese broccoli that had been sitting in some sort of sauce for so long that it had become limp.\nThank goodness for the chicken pumpkin curry dish, something I had had at the other OSHA restaurants and had always enjoyed.   It was the only passable dish here.\nMy wife said the ladies bathroom was dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned since lunchtime.  My own visit to the men's room confirmed the fact that management does not pay attention to the details, at least not at this location.\nAfter the dishes arrived, the waiter was nowhere to be seen until the meal was over and then he casually asked how the meal was.  He thought I was joking when I told him the meal was terrible.  When he eventually realized I was serious, he said he would speak to the manager to see if he could make an  adjustment to the bill.  (Please note that my complaint was not to see if I could knock something off the bill.  Having been a part owner of a restaurant many years ago, I know how important management regards  (actually, I should say \"usually\" regards) direct input, both good and bad, from their customers .   The waiter came back and said no, they would make no adjustment, but they would buy another round of beers for my wife and me.  We were clearly done with the meal, and I said we didn't want another round of beers so he said he would ask if he could at least take the beers off the bill.  I said there was no need to do that as there was nothing wrong with the beers, but it didn't matter, he came back and said the manager would do nothing.   To my surprise, the  manager never even came over to apologize or ask if there was anything he could do.\nStay away from this place, especially in the evening.", "author": "William G."}

One of our friends was running late and told us to order for her and that she'll be coming very shortly.\nWe were seated in the back room after we did tell the \"host\" (and I'm using this term loosely) that there will be people coming later. \nWhen our friend arrived she entered the place which was pretty crowded by that time and had a waiting line and went to the \"host\" to tell him that she is with the group of people that have been already seated. The \"host\" responded in a very poor English something like \"no such group, write your name here and wait\"...she tried explaining again that the group had a reservations and that we were already seated. This time he just decided to ignore her...completely..just chose not to respond... She tried again with a still non-existing response...Finally she guessed that perhaps he is not understanding what she is saying and she asked \"Do you speak English?\"...to which da \"host\" replied \"It's fucking rude, bitch!\"\nAfter all it looks like he does speak English...and in a very creative way I have to say - because using the word \"rude\" with the words \"fucking\" and \"bitch\" in one sentence is a brave move since one is a definition of 2 others...\nWell, if asking \"Do you speak English?\" makes my friend a fucking rude bitch I'm now wondering what or who does saying \"It's fucking rude, bitch!\" make the mighty host of Osha?\nMy friend was able to pull herself out of an initial state of shock and naturally asked to see a manager...to which this Brilliant Customer Service Creature replied that he is in fact a manager...Oookey... Really, I mean REALLY hard to believe and my friend didn't...\nShe  finally came to the table and with the first opportunity asked our waiter to see the manager...No manager ever showed up at out table but I did see the host talking to the waiter in a hallway while nodding at our table. I don't know maybe he was sending his sincere apologies - if so the message has never arrived.\nWe will be taking this issue up the management chain since no attempts were made to smooth the situation out in that particular location.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nFood: hit and miss, proteins are brutally overcooked, soups are brilliant though\nService: hosting is horrific, waiters are quick and efficient\nLocation: lost our business, we were regulars and our tab was usually $200", "author": "Skate K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-10-01", "description": "I am extremely disappointment at this place.  I would give a one star if I can.  So this is my experience:\n \nMy husband and I were in Embarcadero this weekend to do some work, and only had 45 minutes to grab a quick dinner between time.  Upfront, I told the waitress that we only have 30-45minutes to eat, so we need something quick.  So we ordered Angel Wings, Pad Thai & Green Curry Pan Fried.  The waitress wasn't the most polite, in fact with a little bit of attitute, fine we'll put up with it - just want our food quick.\n\nSo our food came after 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad.  I am a slow eater and because we had so little time, and I still have 3/4 of the dish full, we asked for to-go box and the bill.  When the waitress brought the to-go box, I thought it was much too small for my 3/4 unfinished food.  She offered to pack it for me, and I said, \"but this box still seems too small...\"  She responded in an I-know-it-all kind of tone, \"I can do it, I DO THIS EVERYDAY\".  As I feel skeptical but still gave her the benefit of doubt, I let her brought my dish to the back and pack it up for me.  A few seconds later, I spoted a waiter looked a little puzzled, and hesitately put a big dish on top of my dish walking out from the back rushing to the kitchen.  So I stopped him, and asked to see the dish underneath, which was my food dish.  There I found 1/3 of my food there hiding.  I was unhappy and asked my waitress for an explanation.  Apparently she was caught unexpectedly and stood there speechless.  I asked if she said she does this everyday, when I asked for a bigger box or a second box for my unfinished food, why didn't her just do so but ended up sending my other 1/3 of food to trash.  This is not a cheap restaurant and I certainly do not appreciate this kind of service and dishonesty.  All other waitresses and waiters just stood there and didn't know what to react.  Finally, my husband said, \"let's go and how much you want to put down for tip?\" I was not happy with their service, so I said, \"I don't want to put down a penny for tip.\"\n\nNow this is the real meat - the manager heard this standing right next to me, and furiously, she said, \"fine, don't give any tip if you don't like.  We do not want your tip, we just want you to be out of here.  You shouldn't say these things to my waitress. This is no big deal.\"  I said, \"Huh???\" as if I was the one who did something wrong??  I was very upset by her words, so I replied, \"I won't ever come back here and I will for sure yelp about this\".  She said \"go ahead and we do not ever want to see you again here neither.\"  Now, what kind of service and attitude is this??  Afterall I am a customer, and I am pointing out something a waitress did wrong in front of her, and that's what the manager would say to a customer by \"protecting\" her waitress??  This is totally ridiculous and I feel insulted.\n\nSo here I am yelping about this experience.  Nope, I will never go back and if you think you can put up with this kind of service & attitude, good luck.", "author": "Gis A."}

My boyfriend and I were in the financial district, and decided to stop in and get a little something to munch on at this really trendy Thai place. \n\nThe look of the dining room is really nice -- really modern and chic. The hostess and our waitress were super courteous and quick to please. \n\nI got one of the special entrees of the day. The bbq pork on a bed of chopped lettuce was delicious, then there was a salad of some sort ( I forget what was in it) but it was super spicy and flavorful, and finally a big plate of sticky rice that was so sticky that I had a hard time getting some to break off with my fork. By the end of my meal I had finished every last bit of food on my plate and my mouth was still tingling with spices. \n\nWe ordered a cocktail called the North Pole for $8. This place does not have a full bar, so they only serve beer and wine and specialty drinks. We were a little skeptical at the prices of these sweet specialty drinks, but when it arrived at our table we changed our minds. It was pineapple juice and a scoop of coconut ice cream with some kind of liquor in it. It was divine, and surprisingly strong. It was definitely worth the price and I'm totally going to get another when I go back. \n\nI definitely reccommend this place if you want to have a great dining experience and have some great food for reasonable prices.

I Love this place! the first time I was here, i was at the 2nd street spot, earlier in the year, and this is my 2nd time to this chain, and we went to this embarcadero spot. \n\nits' a nice modern place for some nice Thai-Fusion food, with some upscale flare to it. a bit pricey but what isn't in san francisco? \n\nAnd the location at the Embarcadero center, has a nice view of the holiday ice skating rink, and the bay bridge and the nice ferry building. And within walking distance of lots of nice bars nearby. \n\nYummy Dishes, must try! \nApp: Tuna Tower: \n                - \"Tuna Tartare with cilantro, mango, avocado, toasted garlic and Sriracha-sesame sauce served with fried wonton\" it was nice and light and fresh. not fishy at all, so even the non-sushi, non-raw-fish-eating person, could enjoy this dish. \napp: Tom Yum Soup: \n                 - nice taste. love the flavors, but not that much different from the traditional dish elsewhere. \napp: Mango Salad: \n                 -Streamed prawns, sliced mango, red onions, mint, cilantro, Kaffir lime leaf and cashew nuts in spicy lemongrass dressing. This was great! Nice and refreshing with a kick of spice. \n***  lemongrass seabass \n               - great! tasty and flavorful and unique, i haven't seen this at any other restaurant, yet. \n*** Crispy Duck Salad\n               - Fabulous! Crispy smoked duck (nice little crispy pieces, not gamey at all, so the duck hater can still enjoy. not fatty tasting either) , Fuji apple, tomatoes, red & green onion, cilantro and mint with lime vinaigrette \n\ngood dishes: \n- pad see you - a bit on the sweeter side, but still a good dish. \n- Chicken Thai Fried Rice. \n\nthe only \"Eh\" dish we had the whole night was: \n- Prawns Clay Pot\n              - River prawns, silver noodles, celery and green onion served in a clay pot.  The silver noodles that were the main component of the dish, tasted a LOT like the instant bean thread soup kinds, nothing special, and you can taste the msg. the prawns were ok though. but i wouldn't shell out the money for this dish again. \n\nDrinks \n- the thai tea is always a good choice. but don't get if you're lactose intolerant, the white part is half and half. \n- Lava Guava\n            - Ketel One, Stoli Vanilla, Peach Schnapps, Malibu, Midori, Guava juice, Pomegranate juice. This is a great big cocktail to get, lots of punch to it, so the one drink can do wonders. \n\nOverall, this place is great for a date or a large group of people. and they DO take reservations. and are very accommodating. Customer service was good too.", "author": "Judy N."}

Usually Osha has great food for reasonable prices, but last night's experience was off.\n\nFirst of all, their definition of a mojito substitutes the traditional ingredient of plain soda water for processed, pre-made sweet and sour.  So, the result is an incredibly sugar-laden, syrupy ass popsicle flavored mess.  After sending the first one back while we were still at the bar, I explained to the bartender how to make a traditional mojito, and he then made me a really good one.  But, when we wanted a second one (after being seated at our table), it was a whole rigamarole to get another one the way we wanted, because the waitress couldn't understand our definition of the type of mojito we wanted (due to a language barrier): rum, mint, fresh lime juice, soda water and a sugar cube-aka the REAL definition of a mojito.  So, I had to get up from our table, go to the bar and flag down the male bartender to get a normal mojito...which then led to confusion as to transferring the tab to our table, etc...yada yada yada.  Pain in the ASS.\n\nSecondly, the Tom Yam soup they served us contained inedible lemongrass (at least I think it was lemongrass) stalks in it.  We were all chewing and spitting out clumps of fiber that could not be ingested, and fishing out these straw-like lemongrass shards out of our soup.  They should have pre-strained the soup before serving it.\n\nWe were seated promptly, however...much appreciated.  Especially on a very busy Friday night.   I'll be avoiding this Osha in the future.", "author": "Genevieve M."}

Such is the case with Osha at this location.  \n\nMy friend and I came to Osha for lunch on a Saturday afternoon yesterday.  I am 9 months pregnant, and as many of you know, pregnant women have to pee often.  I made a beeline for the bathroom as soon as we entered the restaurant.  In a second, I was chased down by the hostess, who started *screaming* at me that I could not use the bathroom.  I explained that we were there for lunch, but I am pregnant (which is very, very obvious at 9 months, mind you), and I needed to use the bathroom first.  This whole scene completely embarrassed me, although I suppose the hostess is the one who should be embarrassed, as the other restaurant customers were staring in disbelief and concern for me.  In any case, the hostess kept screaming and told me and my friend to leave.  She told us that we could only use the bathroom at the Hyatt Regency next door--assuming for some reason that we were not actually at Osha to dine, but rather simply to use the bathroom.  Given the low quality of their food (I have eaten here before), I do understand why the hostess might think someone would only want to use their bathroom and not eat at Osha.\n\nIn fact, based on my experience with their green curry before, which was very mediocre, we were not terribly brokenhearted to eat somewhere else.  It did take a lot out of me to have to find the bathroom at the Regency and search for a new restaurant.  So much in fact, that by the time I got home, I almost threw up and thought I was going into a slightly premature labor.  Fortunately, I am now rested up and ready to tackle my Thai food cravings once again, but never more at Osha.\n\nI will amend this review if I ever receive an apology from Osha.

However, after tonight I will never return!  Beware!\n\nI ordered the \"Pud See You.\"  It came with chicken, pan friend noodles, and a special bonus... a very rude manager  Yes!  The rudest manager I have ever seen!  \n\nI know, I know, little issues come up all the time.  Have you ever gotten a finger nail in your food?  Yeah, it is REALLY GROSS, but I'm generally willing to look past things like this so long as there aren't other issues.  That is where the real problems began!  The manager's response to our issue was completely UNACCEPTABLE.  The waitress seemed very apologetic about the incident.  We asked to speak to the manager just to make sure he understood what happened and could fix the issue.  He refused to come to our table to acknowledge the problem.  I have to be honest, this pissed me off.  I insisted to the waitress that the manager should come over to my table.  He refused.  It was actually funny because the waitress motioned towards the manager who was clearly watching this happen from his register towards the back.\n\nAt the point, I became very frustrated.  This is no way to treat your customers.  Incredibly disrespectful!!!  I went up to the manager and then asked him why he wouldn't come to my table.  He said that there was nothing to do.  I asked for his name and he initially refused to give it to me.  I asked repeatedly SEVEN times for his name.  He eventually said his name was \"Paul\" after I started asking the other wait staff, now watching this unfold, what his name was.  At the end, I just paid my full price bill and stormed out.  I have never been so insulted.  Can you imagine that?\n\n\"Paul\" gave us the worst customer service experience at Osha I have ever experienced.  I hope he is fired soon.\n\nI hate Osha Thai now.  I will never return!  Paul is possibly the worst, most disrespectful manager I have ever encountered.", "author": "Phil M."}

The spiciness level on their dishes can get pretty intense too, which I love.  If you don't dig on spicy, just be careful when you're ordering.

Here was my expierence.\n\nWalking into pretty vacant resturant I was greeted by the hostess.  I asked for a table for two and am waiting for my second half.  She said that I have to wait outside until my whole party arrived.  I have never been to place that doesn't sit half of the party first especially an empty one.  When my cousin arrived, the hostess sat us in the very back of the restaurant next to the emergency exit.  When asked if we could sit closer to the rest of the world she declined our request.  (WTF? why are they shoving us into the corner).  My cousin who rode the bart just to try this place was very persistent that i tried this place so I get my cool and ordered.  We ordered the Phad Sew Ewe with Beef , tofu salad and Chicken Noodle soup.  When I asked for a rice bowl and chopsticks, another waiter walked by our table and threw a sauce dish, and a couple of chopsticks almost missing our table.  I asked another waiter if this sauce dish was their rice bowel and he replied that the house is all out of rice bowels (there was maybe 10  customers in the restaurant).  \nI cannot believe how rude the service was. The only redeeming quality was the food was actually decent.  If you are going to eat her just get it to go.

It wasn't crowded at all and I easily got a table outside on a beautiful day.  There was a nice view, good people watching, and a lively band playing in the plaza.\n\nIt's weird to me that the different Osha locations have different menus, different preparations of the same dish, and (less unexpectedly) different prices.  At this Osha Boyfriend had the mango salad.  After tasting it, I wanted to slip him a mickey so I could have it all myself.  I loved it so much that I tried to recreate it a couple days later.  Let's just say that Osha won't be losing any business to me.  Boyfriend also had the angel wings which were really crispy despite being drenched in a sauce that was too sweet for my taste.  I ordered samosas and sticky rice with mango.  The waitress didn't bring my samosas and we had to ask for it a second time.  While waiting I enjoyed my mango and rice which was plated so beautifully and differently from the Geary location I usually go to.  When I finally got my samosas, I was disappointed to find that the filling was completely pureed and that they were sugary like little sweet potato pies with curry seasoning.  They were actually pretty good, I just hadn't wanted two sweet dishes.\n\nupdate- Boyfriend and I just went back 'cause I had to have the mango salad.  Once again, it was amazing.  He had the asparagus and tofu side order which was good, but overpriced at $9.", "author": "Lauren C."}

At this rate, you might as well go to Gary Dankos.

I want Thai food, and Thai food can only be so fancy and upscale. When I walk into a restaurant like Osha I kind of wonder if they highly decorate the place to make up for the lack of good tasting food. Well, all I can say is perhaps I had a bad first go around. \n\nOne word comes to mind when I think of Osha; SLOW. The server took forever to take our order, bring the food,  even give us some water. Basically, she asks what you want to drink and never comes back with it. Maybe she forgot? so you tell the server again and they still never come back with the drink. Oh well, moving on... I wanted some tom yum (hot and sour soup) I asked it to be real spicy which didn't happen. The soup was luke warm, not spicy at all, and wasn't sour one bit. Actually, the soup was a bit sweet for some odd reason. Next, the beef salad with artichoke hearts was good. The chunks of meat were real tender and real thick. The only thing lacking was the actual salad part. Lack of lettuce, lack of artichokes, lack of anything except for meat. I guess you can say I received a plate of beef with a small side of salad. Finally, for the grand DISAPPOINTMENT was over breaded and small portioned fried bananas. The best part of the dessert was the ice cream they served along side of it.

I like the environment and all but the food didn't quite cut it. My bf and I said never again.

I ordered the pumpkin curry and it was yum, I would have liked it spicier but now I know for next time. My coworker ordered the volcanic beef and that was also very good. We also shared the fresh rolls and crispy rolls, the fresh rolls I preferred with the peanut sauce. We went very early, 11:30 so we were seated and served very quickly. By noon it was looking like a long wait to be seated. The decor was also very festive, christmas decorations and nice lighting.  I will definitely be back to try other things!", "author": "La C."}

I came here for the first time on my birthday with a bunch of friends - the service is good, our waitress was attentive, the food was alright, and the atmosphere is lively. My only complain would be how the small plates were overly priced. For appetizer, we ordered the \"vegetarian crispy roll,\" which we thought was very good. The \"yellow sea\" entree was not good at all. It was kind of mushy as if the chef just threw a bunch of cooked seafood into a plate of curry. Gross. I ordered \"Osha's spicy pan fried noodles,\" which was better than the other dish, but still nothing special at all. The thai iced tea was a bit sweeter than usual. I might come here again to try something else on a boring, nothing-to-do day.", "author": "Angellica Y."}

Gotta love it. I also really enjoy the Volcano Beef, how can you not love a volcano made of onion rings?

This has been my go-to place to go for Thai food but this last experience almost cost me my life  and this is not an exaggeration.  I wanted Tom Kha soup, it has a choice of: chicken, tofu, calamari, shrimp, fish and combination seafood (note, crab was def not included in this list).  I ordered combination seafood and I had a couple of sips of my favorite soup when I realized that there was CRAB in there! I told the manager that CRAB was not included in the menu for soup and he had the temerity to ask me: Have you eaten here before? Oh, so he's making it my fault now?  Of course I have but that have never ordered the combination seafood.  The menu DID NOT include the crab in the combination seafood option.  In two minutes, my voice was cracking and my entire face was feeling hot, I had to run out of there to get my epipen or else I would have had to call the ambulance to take me to the hospital. That's what happened to me when someone added crab to a recipe and didn't inform me and I DO ask.  It doesn't make any sense.  I'll be looking for another Thai restaurant after this incident.

Its a blend of spicy curry cut with sweet coconut milk. This dish was truly rich in flavor and the coconut milk didn't over power the dish at all it highlighted the spici-ness just right.  My date had the Pad Thai with rice noodles and  it good from what I got to taste. I like that they add crab to it with little crab pieces so you can crack the shell and get some real crab meat.

The thai iced tea didn't taste good at all. it tasted like sugar and water. they make really good angel wings. but they were really tiny. the pad see you was pretty good. the pad thai ... ehhhh had better. pineapple fried rice.. where were the pineapples? the panang curry was kinda watery. It tasted good though, but it looked weird. and the honey duck was pretty awesome. osha thai definitely does have ambiance. we got seated on the side near the windows and i got to sit in the cushion part. defiintely comfortable. and everyone in the restaurant looks like they're having a really good time. so i gues this place is pretty decent.", "author": "Amy X."}

They have different locations but all the restaurants are completely different even though they have the same name. This one seems to be more.. \"fancy\" and laguna beach style LOL. I can't explain it... but it was really nice inside. The food was kinda overpriced for the quality, but I'm not saying the food's bad. I ordered the wasabi beef roll for appetizer.. it was Okay. The beef was sorta dry and I think I could have made it better lol. I ordered the thai tea and the lychee ice tea ( yes i'm a fat ass ). The lychee ice tea wasn't as crazy as i thought it'd be.  It's supposed to be cold but it was kinda warm. Seems like they just pump some lychee syrup into some lipton, then drowned it with some ice. The server recommended the volcanic beef and said it was the \"best dish on the menu\". I gave it a try. The beef was good and had a good smokey flavor to it but the sweet and sour sauce was an overkill. It was OVERLY sweet. I had to eat a lot of the rice to dilute the sweetness.. LOL. \n\nOverall, I'd come here again, but not in a long long long minute. Kinda pricey. I think I put in $45?", "author": "Bonita C."}

I did mention to him, i will try to be there by 9:45PM as we have to travel all the way from San Jose. Due to traffic issues, we reached there by 10:05 PM (i.e. 10 minutes late, as per my reservation time). The HOST \"Noon\" or \"Moon\", i couldnt get her name correctly told us that since we are late and hence our reservation is dropped and she said it very very rudely. Next our friends were visiting the place the first time so they reached there by 10:10 PM and she refused to seat us down until all the 6 people were already there. I would understand if the place was full and there people waiting. But the place had a lot of places empty, but she made us sit in one corner where it was near the kitchen and really HOT. When asked to move she said, that it cant be done as the area is closed. Restaurant doesn't close till 11PM, but seating places are closing is just beyond me.\nKitchen closes at 10:45PM, but the host told us, that she was the hostess and should could decide if she wanted to serve us. This is not CUSTOMER SERVICE. This is nothing but arrogance. We had hoped for an upscale Thai restaurant experience, but what we got was absolutely atrocious and pathetic service. We left the Restaurant without eating anything and went to Osha Thai Lounge. The host \"Yok\" - i hope i said that correctly, was so so so very nice, she made us feel very good with her pleasant smile and a great customer oriented attitude. We tipped her extra, apart from the automatic gratuity and she had no qualms about accepting us at 10:30PM when the kitchen closes at 10:45PM. i really feel that a reality check on the customer service is required for Osha Thai restaurant on embarcadero. They ruined our evening. I have never been treated so rudely in my entire life.\n\nHoping that you will look into this.\n\nAlso please do look at some of the single star reviews to really understand whats going on in the restaurant.\n\nWe had been to the restaurant on June 12th - 10 PM\n\n- From a humiliated and embarrassed customer (Ashwin)", "author": "Ashwin P."}

We had just walked from Pier 39 to Pier 1 in record speed to get to The Slanted Door in time to eat and make our ferry departure time, and were told they were not taking any more patrons who did not have reservations for the evening. She mentioned Osha's, which I thought she said was an Italian restaurant, but to my great surprise it featured my favorite cuisine, Thai food. \n\nWhile I have only been here once, I managed to sample two dishes, the infamous pumpkin curry and the lemongrass chicken. The pumpkin curry was as good as everyone has previously stated. The lemongrass chicken was very tasty as well, mild/medium spiced and all of the flavors blended together very well. They used red sauce to draw a nice red spiral design on the plate, which was very cool. Where I'm from, you're lucky to get a sprig of parsley for presentation, so this added touch was very nice.\n\nWe entered the restaurant slightly before 8, famished from the walk, and were immediately seated. We were lucky, shortly after the tables filled and people were waiting to be seated. We ordered, I went to the bathroom, and by the time I got back the food was already there. According to my friend the food had been waiting there for several minutes, so it must have arrived about one minute after I had ordered. I don't know how they managed that, the food tasted freshly prepared. Though the service was not very personal, the waitress who served us was pleasant. I'm a sucker for deep red accents and dark walls in a restaurant, so I really enjoyed the decor of the place. The wicker chairs were surprisingly very comfortable. The place was crowded by the time we left, we were sitting very close to other groups of people, closer than what is common in most restaurants from where I am from. This did not bother me at all, but might not be appealing to others.\n\nI'd definitely visit again, around 7 p.m., for a good meal, more pumpkin curry, and to try out the Thai Samosas.", "author": "Megan H."}

We had to give eye contact to let her know we needed assistance.  I mentioned to one of the hostess that it was a special night for my wife's birthday and the first thing she said was \" You have to order dessert for us to put a candle on it\"  Wow!!  How embarrassing......not even a recognition to the person who was having the birthday.  My wife was quite disappointed and that makes me upset since I wanted to give her a special evening.

We made reservations for a party of 15 and we were seated right away once everyone arrived. The service here is so good and the servers were very attentive to all our needs.\n\nEverything on the menu sounded so appealing but I ended up getting the Angry prawns and they weren't lying when they said that spicy was really spicy. Usually at restaurants when you ask them how spicy is spicy they tell you it's really spicy but it really isn't but here... it's on a whole new level of spiciness. I'm glad I ended up getting it medium hot as to really spicy because I think I would have died.\n\nThe orders came out pretty quick and the presentation of the dishes were really cute. At the end of dinner the waitress asked us if we wanted a group picture and even offered to take the picture for us outside the restaurant. \n\nI would definitely come here again and I would really want to try the pad thai because I heard it's really really good!!!", "author": "Natalie C."}

If you care at all about service and management, DON'T eat here!\n\nMy sister and I were seated at the bar for a day-after my birthday lunch. We sat at the bar for 15 minutes, starving, until i was able to flag someone down to take our order. Everything seemed OK after that, until my food arrived abour 8 minutes before my sisters. The bartender simply dropped off my salad and walked away. We sat expectantly for a few minutes before it became clear that my sisters food wasn't coming any time soon nor were we getting any sort of explanation. I flag down the bar tender - \"is there other food coming out soon?\". Her respone. \"yes, it just comes from the other part of the kitchen and takes a lot longer\". OKKKKKKKK, so much for timing. Now, the food is spicy, the sodas are empty, so I flag down the bartender for a refill. A while later, I have to flag her down for the check.\n\nI look at the check. I see, \"Diet coke - 4 ($2.00) - $8.00\". I'm sorry, $8.00 for diet coke?????? I say to the bartender, \"you never told us we were being charged for the refills.\" She says \"This is a thai restaurant. we charge for refills. I didn't know you didn't know\". whhhhhaaaatt?? So, these sodas were TINY, and glasses were filled with mostly ice. I say, \"well, most places don't charge for refills and you didn't tell us\". She makes some reiteration of it being a thai restaurant and I realize she is not going to take one round of drinks off the bill.\n\nSo we pay, and I go to the front to speak to the manager (which I never do) because an apology or a free appetizer will easily redeem this place. \n\nThis is where it gets awful. I start to explain to the manager how the service was horrible and slow and we had to flag the bartender down everytime we needed something. My sister says that most places have free refills and we should have been told about the charge. The manager then gets all bitchy (it's a man) and says \"um, this is a THAI restuarant, we charge for refills\". WTF? No other thai place does. Aqua doesn't. McDonalds doesn't.  So my sister says she was a server for 5 years and most places dont and the manager says \"thats not true, i disagree, we don't have to give free refills\". DUUUUUUDDEEEEE was alll queen bitch about it. So, I say \"well, between the bad service and the refill charge, we were really not happy with our service\" and my sister starts to say something and the manager makes the \"shush\" hand sign in her face and says \"can i only talk to her\". Bitch just shushed my sister!\n\nI look at him and say \"listen, most managers prefer dealing with customers that have problems directly rather than having them spread bad word of mouth. We came to talk to you expecting a different result and you are just as horrible as your servers. we're leaving and we're never coming back\".\n\nI want all yelpers to help me get my revenge at this horrible place and horrible manager by NOT GOING TO OSHA.  Dude shushed my sister in her face! bbbbiiiitttcccchhhh", "author": "Kay T."}

Although there were a lot of people, we were still seated quickly, albeit at the bar, which was fine by me.  Bar is better than waiting.  Some people even prefer it.  I don't, but some do.  Anyway, we ordered the spring rolls, chicken pad thai and beef with green beans and I was pleasantly surprised with the 10-15 minute rapidness that our food arrived.  The presentation of the dishes was innovative and classy.  Not only did it look delic, it tasted delic.  No compaints!  Overall, I was thoroughly impressed with this restaurant.  The decor was modern, interesting and asethetically pleasing while being what seems to be a fairly clean restaurant overall.  Prices were good too.  I think for our whole meal it was about $30.  My only qualm was the service.  I asked for more water and I seriously thought the lady was going to take a samuri to my head.  It's like, smile a little.", "author": "Vanessa Z."}

I've been to the oshas on 2nd street and the mission, but never here. It was cute and busy inside, with good music playing in the background. I liked sitting on a sofa like bench, but the other seats were kind of stool things, which weren't the best. But the people sitting on those thought the sofa thing uncomfy too so didnt switch seats. I had a thai iced tea which tasted a bit weird, maybe lemony or something. We had for starters the fried tofu (pretty bland, we didnt finish it), chicken satays (good) and spring rolls (i usually like spring rolls but assumed theyd come with the peanut sauce on the side. they arrived sitting IN the peanut sauce, and since i cant eat peanuts, i didnt get to try them).  I had the salmon sashimi salad ($12). it was a little small, but great size for lunch, and a lot of salmon. Very tasty, i liked it a lot. Everyone else had curry type dishes.  The brown rice looked purple. The coconut rice looked cute, in a coconut. Everyone liked theirs, and i dont think anyone even finished it, so they must have been good sized servings, for lunch anyway.  if i had their food for dinner i'd be hungry, and i dont think that they have a separate menu/sizes for lunch and dinner.  The thing about osha is that although the food is generally good, it can be kind of small, and even if it isnt, its pricey for what you get. For those prices, you should get either gigantic plates, or really great food. You get usually goodish food. I prefer non chain thai places. but this is good for a work lunch, definitely. i'd for sure go back for a work lunch if i'm not paying lol. i would not spend $12 on a lunch sized salad on my own though.", "author": "Merredith L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-12", "description": "This is NOT the place to have a birthday party.  You will find the information and story below very useful.\n\nThis story begins on a Monday, 4 days prior to the night of the event outlining my awful experience.  Keep in mind that I've eaten here a few times already, and liked the food enough to share with 30 other people.\n\nWhen I called to make a reservation around noon on Monday, I told them I'd like to make a reservation for Friday night for a party of 30.  The person who answered the phone then asked me to call back after 3pm because they are busy right now.  Too busy to take a reservation for 30 people.  I should have known to not call back.  Never had I been asked to call back to make a reservation simply because they were busy.  If that were the case, Osha Thai should NOT have picked up the phone.  When I did finally call back, I was transfered to someone named Paul.  He claims to be the head reservationist and manager.  He was non-chalant on the phone, and seemed less than enthusiastic about hosting a party of 30 people.  He then said he cannot confirm my reservation until I sign a contract.\n\nThe contract adds information that is not displayed on the web site.  The web site says 18% gratuity is added to a party of 6 or more.  The contract states the following:\n\n-20% gratuity automatically added for a party of 15 or more.\n-$10 per person who does not show up and will be charged to the credit card number left on the contract (I had to list the number of people in my party).\n- Minimum $30 per person must be spent, or the rest will be charged onto my credit card\n\nCome Friday night.  Earlier in the day on Friday, my girlfriend brought 3 bottles of champagne to the resturant, and was fully aware of the $20 corkage fee per bottle.  When we got to the restaurant, I had proceeded to the bar to greet my friends who were waiting for me.  My girlfriend stayed behind by the front desk talking to Paul, the person who took my reservation.  I did not know about the 3 bottles of champagne, nor the birthday cake she had brought in.  Though we were running the party together, she was trying to set things up as a surprise for me.  She was then informed by Paul that she can only open 1 bottle of champagne, and pay the $20 corkage fee.  She was not told this when the bottles were brought in earlier in the day.  (Plus, how in the world can 30 people share ONE bottle of champagne?)  She had asked for an explanation, and Paul's response was \"I am the manager here, and I can make up the rules\".  He then said he refused to talk to her anymore, and will only speak to me.\n\nShe was mortified by the lack of customer service Paul was displaying.  So she came up to me to ask to speak to Paul, after telling me what happened.  I then went up to Paul, and told him that whatever is going on tonight, it will go through her.  He still refused to speak to her for some reason and kept rudely brushing her off, right in front of me.  I also asked him for an explanation of the champagne bottle restriction.  He claims that only 1 table can open up 1 bottle.  A minute later, he then changed his mind and said we can open all 3 bottles, but the 2 additional bottles will cost $30 for corkage fee.  I then told him I'm not paying $30 for corkage fee when the web site clearly states $20.  I then asked him why is he making up prices.  He then responded to me as well \"I am the manager, and I can make up any rule I want\"  \n\nAt this point, I did not want to keep 30 people waiting since they were ready to be seated.  I turned to Paul, and told him he was being very rude not only to me, but to my girlfriend.  I asked him to apologize only to my girlfriend, because the way he kept brushing her off in front of me was completely uncalled for.  I told him that once he apologizes, we will sit down and eat, and call it a night.  His response was \"I was not being rude to her, and we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.  If you can find another restaurant at this last minute to hold your large party, I'd like to see that.\"  Even though I was completely furious at ths point, I kept my composure, and politly asked for the owner's name.  Paul then replied \"This conversation is over\", and walked away.\n\nTo avoid starting a scene in front of my guests, I took the high road and walked away, though completely outraged.  5 minutes later, we were able to find a restaurant called Sens right upstairs from osha, on the 3rd level of Embarcadero 4 who were able to accomodate us.  This restaurant was very polite and curteous.  \n\nThis story will reach the owner.  That is a promise.", "author": "J W."}

It is right off the wharf by the Ferry Building..\nThis is a very trendy, hip place for the weekend.  Like many of these types of restaurant, it can get really loud.  We ended up ordering take-out for dinner.  For a late lunch, the place is extremely quiet.  However, the natural lighting during the day creates a calm atmosphere in the restaurant.  The wait service is super friendly, and   he service is quick.  \nWe ordered  the fried crab, avocado, and mango roll.  This was a mistake.  All I could taste as I bit into it was the grease from the fryer.  There is a lot of oil that is soaked into the batter and the shrimp.  I think it would have been better had they cut the roll into smaller pieces so that the oil didn't ooze into my mouth with every bite.\nThe spicy noodles and the pad see yew were okay.  A lot more sodium (or msg) than I usually like.  I felt like I needed to drink a lot of water with the meal.\nWe did go back for lunch.  The pineapple rice was delicious.  The duck with bok choy was really good, too.  There were many pieces of duck, albeit with the skin on, but plenty more than you'd usually get with duck entrees.", "author": "N K."}

I was never really a big fan of Thai Food, and I've had ONE PLACE BETTER. But this is definitely better than King of Thai, and of course more pricey. They VOLCANIC BEEF is delicious!! I would usually give it the boost up to a 4 star, but because of a couple of flaws, I lowered it to 3. There were 11 of us, and they gave us 2 tiny bowls of rice to share (each bowl holding probably enough for 2 to 3 people at most). They never bothered to refill our sides, and only did the other side because they asked. I HATE THE FCKIN CHAIRS! They are woven wooden chairs, which weigh just as much as I do, so I can barely move it to get in or out! The Embarcadero is nice, but with much wobbly stones as ground. And b/c of an incident that happened to my pair of pretty & comfy boots that I was wearing that day, I had to walk a million blocks here in my newly bought 9 west heels which is pretty much one of the top 3 most uncomfortable pairs of heels I've ever owned!

Furthermore, the only cutlery that was folded into the napkins were forks. That made eating the 4-inch slabs of meat and de-tailing the shrimp rather difficult in fine company. Finally, the architecture of the restaurant makes it an acoustic pain to have a conversation, not helped by the wide girth of the tables. Even for a table of two, we had to shout to hear each other.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-03-31", "description": "GREAT FOOD, LOUSY SERVICE!!  There is no denying that the food at Osha Thai is wonderfully and carefully prepared.  Since my first visit here, every dish my friends and I have ordered is of excellent quality and taste.  The one CAVEAT (and justification for the 3 star RATING) is the service.  It is opposite world in that restaurant every day - Ying and Yang with the Food and Service!!!!! Perhaps the Chef and Cooks should teach the servers some skills on how to be attentive to customers while in a busy environment!  EXAMPLE:  On today's visit, our waitress was no where to be found when we needed our water refilled and bill ... and because we are Osha-trained in patience, we waited ... BUT the last straw was when we asked our waitress (female w/fluffy and messy hair) for change and did not see her again for 10 minutes.  When we did find her, we asked her what happened to our change and she looked puzzled.  The customer behind her then tapped her on the shoulder and gaver her money saying, \"This is not ours.\"  The waitress then started laughing and turned to us saying, \"This must be yours, ha ha ha!\"  Ummmmm ... we were not laughing and yeah, it was ours.  Lessons learned -- Anticipate your Order, Bring Exact Change, Order Food AND at the same time ask for the Check, Eat, Pay and leave immediately!", "author": "Shaw Y."}

Decor is nice.  There are a lot waiters and waitress running around making sure people are being accommodated.  I'm looking for authentic Thai food.  This isn't the place to go to if you're looking for the basic.   It's definitely fusion food.  It's actually a strange mix of food combination and my taste palate.  I felt it was very sweet and I kept drinking a lot of water.  I'm not sure if they put MSG, I just felt parched.  I don't think you want to do fusion on Thai food.  It already has a lot of flavorful spices in the dish itself.  I could be wrong because this place is packed.  I enjoyed their original location in the Tenderloin area but it's been awhile since my last visit and there that location was pretty authentic.  They had this northern style Thai sausage which was delicious!", "author": "pengrin .."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-17", "description": "Disappointed after reading the great reviews here. I guess \"trendy\" means loud '70's disco music but you can only hear the bass and the drums. Yes, I'm 60ish, bald and wear glasses but really, I did survive the 60's and 70's happily and know how to have a good time. I was excited when I heard several people recommend the Volcano Beef and when th waitress spoke her only two English words, \"Not spicy?\" I was clear in saying no, \"spicy, please.\"  The dish was not only not spicy but  not \"herby\"  either which is to say it had no flavor except that of the beef and a bit of sugar.  Very chewy beef for $18.00.  Presentations, with orchids, were beautiful.  I understand the ladies' room was filled with orchids and was beautiful, but I wasn't hungry for orchids.  My wife had the Pad Thai, and the only thing I can say is that it was fine, but there are far better versions in New Orleans, and I'm certain, in San Francisco.  The prices are not high for this area (although certainly not low and my portion was only adequate) but the restaurant makes up for it by seating patrons and moving them on twice as fast.  Our food came out in five minutes (clearly we ordered the wrong thing) and was warm, not hot. The check came within 30 seconds of our finishing dinner, and returned 30 seconds after I put the credit card down. Anyway,  they did not take my chair out from under me. In any event, at least I escaped the beat of the bass - I thought - now I'm sitting in my room at the Hyatt Regency listening to the beat from 1000 feet away and getting my ear buds out - I'm just not sure how my son is going to sleep.", "author": "Robert L."}

At this point I was not very happy but was with others so decided to deal with her rudeness.

I got the mojito upon recommendations from other Yelpers but it tasted more like soda water and it only came with a few uncrushed mint leaves. I wanted to make a small comment but could not get the bartenders attention.  Third, the decor is okay but they need better chairs with backing so that someone tall like me won't have a backache at the end  of the day.
