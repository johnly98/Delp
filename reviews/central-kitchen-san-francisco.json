We settled on:\n\n- an order of fry bread (YUM, but $$)\n- the avocado and tomatoe salad (pretty good, the lime zest elevated it above basic)\n- summer squash salad (extremely lacking in flavor and seasoning)\n- mashed potatoes with chicken cracklings (watery and underwhelming)\n- braised lamb (super tender and flavorful, would come back for).\n- the chocolate custard with coffee ice cream and chocolate cookie crumble (amazing, totally worth it)\n\nThe food wasn't too bad for the price and the reputation, I was expecting better.

We started with the fry bread and added in the burrata and roasted garlic. We also had some sort of charcuterie-type meat (can't remember what it was called) that was delicious. The fry bread was the highlight of the meal, though. Absolutely delicious, warm and seemed as if it just came out of the oven. \n\nThe heirloom tomato and avocado salad was good, but nothing overly impressive. It was exactly what it said it was, not an overly inventive dish. We also had the rotating pasta dish, which as the time were little mini raviolis cooked in some kind of butter-based sauce. Absolutely delicious, a little overly expensive for what you get but still a delightful dish. We also ordered a half roasted chicken since that seemed to be one of the staples on the side. The chicken was a tad dry in some places but very moist in others, there were a ton of small bones that made it hard to eat and left a mess trying to do so. The whipped potato was the only side dish that we ordered and was good, but I'm not a huge fan of anything smoked so I tried to avoid the butter portion.\n\nHonestly, even after eating all of this, the fry bread was still the highlight so we skipped desert and opted for another order of that again. The service was good, they didn't seem to come by as often as I would've liked and completely forgot my friend's beer until we mentioned it about 80% of the way into the meal. It's a really cute restaurant, just not sure that it warrants a second trip.", "author": "Katie Y."}

We ordered a couple of appetizers to start -get the Brussels sprouts! I think they were hands down the favorite for everyone. Then we all ordered a main dish- we somehow managed to order one of every pasta. I got the mezzaluna but I tried all of them, and I think my favorite was actually the beef raviolini.

Armed with an Opentable $50 gift certificate, fruits of making reservations with them, we were lucky to find a parking place that was barely legal after circling around for 10-15 minutes.  Those who say there's plenty of street parking are using alternate facts.  There's almost no parking!  When we entered, I liked the feel of it immediately.  I bet when it's sunny that skylight really lights up the room.  It reminded me a little of Foreign Cinema.  Our waiter was friendly and professional in just the right ratio, but what's with all the secrecy about what will be served on the well priced \"Let the Kitchen Decide\"  menu?  I've been seeing this a lot lately.  Are they afraid if you know what you'll be served, you'll try to make changes, or what?  I asked our server, and he said he didn't know, but, if I wanted him to he could go back to the kitchen and ask. Just too coy, unless they change it up throughout the night based on what they want to unload from the kitchen.  We opted out and dined instead on:\n\nChicory Salad with asian pear, mandarin, chevre and spiced nuts $13.  3.5 stars- I thought this paired some rather disparate things, but it tasted good, and the bitterness of the chicory did a good job of offsetting the fruit.  The chevre pieces were just way too big though.\n\nCauliflower and Romanesco - with soft boiled egg, duck salami,  bagna cauda $14. 4 stars-  I was caught off guard with this being served cold.  I guess just the bagna was cauda, because the rest was not warm at all and the egg especially would have been better warmer, but there was a lovely nuttiness to the flavor, and it was visually stunning\n\nBacon Wrapped Rabbit - braised leg, lentils, onion and golden raisins $29. 3.5 stars.  I'm torn on this.  It was in fact a roulade, with a rabbit forcemeat wrapped in bacon set on a bed of the other ingredients.  It was tender and flavorful, but not at all as described, and rather a small portion for that price point\n\nBlack Pepper and Mushroom Agnolotti -beef brisket, spring onions and potato $20. 4 stars - This was probably the best dish we had, albeit a rather small portion for the price.  Very rich, it was a deeply flavored filling and toothsome pasta.\n\nSome suggestions:\n1. Get someone to rewrite the item descriptions to match what they are actually serving\n2. Edit ingredients on some of the items.  More doesn't necessarily mean better.\n3. Valet parking would make people less cranky\n\nFood:  30:40\nService:  17/20\nAtmosphere/Intangibles: 18/20\nValue:  15/20\nOverall:  80/100\nBarely makes it in to the 4 star category", "author": "Diane B."}

The staff is just so lovely - answered all our questions promptly, gave great recommendations, etc. I also love the high ceilings and the natural lighting, which made the space seem very open and airy.\n\nCome with people who like to share food (no Joey Tribbiani), as everything is meant to be shared. My friend and I shared a salad, bread, a small vegetable dish (charred asparagus), 2 pastas, and we were STUFFED. The menu is seasonal, so go off the staff's recommendations. The salad was seriously the best I've ever had in my life (walnuts, goat cheese, bacon, gem lettuce, edible flowers - nothing crazy) and I eat a lot of salad. It was just so thoughtfully put together. The pasta (green garlic rigatoni and pappardelle with pork belly) was incredible.

In my mind I have a notion of how many dollars worth of calories will satiate both my stomach and my brain, but Central Kitchen only went 3/5 of the way there for me. When eating, you want quality and quantity--Central Kitchen absolutely delivers in the quality aspect, but I was left longing for more of a quantity aspect.\n\nEverything here is shared. I know this because it is in ALL CAPS in the top right of their menu.\n\nThat said, the opportunity to explore different flavor profiles and presentations was the best part of my Central Kitchen experience.\n\nSquid corzetti? Taste-bud-opening.\n\nCheese Ricotta? Dream-pervading.\n\nWHIPPED potatoes? I'm done. (No but actually, this was one of the most interesting dishes I experienced, even though it was an extremely simple profile. I had no idea that potatoes could be served with this consistency and intensity. Perhaps juxtaposing it with our Melons & Cucumber dish amplified its savoriness. Or maybe its crunchy Chicken side was what topped off the experience for me. Honestly, it was just great, to put it succinctly.)\n\nBut I was overall left wanting more--not quite flavor-wise, but actual calories.

We were seated on time. It was dimly lit, almost too dark. We were in a corner making it a little cramped, but it wasn't unbearable. The atmosphere was nice, and the aesthetics make it look like a very hip  and trendy restaurant.\n\nOur table ordered most of the pasta menu, the whipped potato, a few drinks, and dessert. The portions were very small for the price. We were given complimentary sourdough bread with cultured butter. I had the green garlic campanelle, which was too oily for my taste. I was not a fan of it.  I ended up switching my dish with my boyfriend, who got the bucatini. That dish was a handful of flavors, but I wouldn't eat it again. We both preferred each other's orders over our own and agreed our entrees were okay. The whipped potato, however, was delicious after adding our leftover butter in it. I would recommend it. I didn't order a drink, but the table seemed content with theirs.  For dessert we got the chocolate custard and sorbet and was the better part of the meal. The chocolate custard was good, but it wasn't mind blowing amazing or a must order again. \n\nAs for the service... Our waitress was very nice and prompt. After ordering and receiving our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order entrees. We had one person at the table who needed a couple more minutes to decide, and she said she would be back. She did not come back until 15 minutes later. After flagging her down to take our orders, we did not see her again and were helped by another waiter. There was no check up during our entrees, but he was nice and engaging when we ordered dessert. At the end when the check was paid and signed, we saw our original waitress again just to pick up the check.\n\nI found myself trying to balance out the underwhelming elements with the decent elements throughout the dinner.

It just has really clean-tasting quality food. \n\nMy favorite dish was the heirloom tomato salad, which had chunks of bread, a generous amount of olive oil, burrata, and sizeable chunks of multicolored tomatoes. I still have dreams about this dish, it was so good. These tomatoes had a sweetness I've never encountered before in a tomato, and were just bursting with flavor. And I have no idea who thought of putting bread in there, but good on them, because it was just an amazing mish mash of textures. I know it sounds like I'm exaggerating, but this was probably one of my favorite dishes I've had ever.\n\nThe short rib was also really tender and flavorful. They just perfected what short rib should be. I could cut it with a fork, but it just melted in my mouth and still had enough fat within the meat to create that melting feel. It was awesome.\n\nAnd the chocolate custard. Wow. This thing was so packed with coffee and chocolate flavor that it was unbelievable.

Being here for 3 years now, The Mission is one neighborhood I've been meaning to spend more time in so when an opportunity came up to have dinner at this joint, I quickly jumped on it. \n\nSituated by a pretty popular and colorful bar, Central Kitchen is truly an oasis on his own. When you enter pass the gates, you'll notice a big pile of wood to the left and stringing lights leading you to the door. Inside is a beautiful ambiance! Sky lighting, hanging lights, a water feather, lots of plants, as if you were out on someone's porch or an outside meditation area. So cute!! \n\nOur server was fantastic! I forgot his name unfortunately but he was so accommodating, he was quick, checked up on us often and was playful enough to make us feel welcomed. I really enjoyed the staff of the joint, thought that really help create the experience. For dinner, here's what we had: \n\n-From the Larder menu, we chose the Beef Tartare for $12. The tartare was served on grilled sourdough with parmigiano and chili. There was a lot going on in the tartare, full of flavor and texture. Soooooo good! This was one of my favorite dishes of the evening. I REALLY liked that they cut the bread up before putting the tartare on so you could share the dish. Very thoughtful. \n\n-From the Vegetables menu, we chose the Little Gems salad for $13. This was a HUGE salad served with green goddess mix of romaine, beautifully sliced radishes, fine herbs like dill and mint and almonds. The dressing had a slight sour taste like a vinaigrette flavor which accentuate the herbs and greens. It was a light bite since shared amongst me and my friend. \n\n-Along with our main dish, we also got the seared asparagus for $11 from the vegetables menu. OH EM GEE, you don't expect asparagus to be this good! Nicely seared over some yogurt, tahini and served with green strawberries and something called a za'atar spice with sesame seeds. Nice balance of salty and sweet, asparagus is cut up into small pieces. This was a GREAT side options for our meal and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS. \n\n-The star of the show, for dinner we both shared the 24oz bone in Ribeye from the Large Plates menu for $72. Sticker shock at first, I know, but SOOOO WORTH IT! The steak comes medium rare, perfect. The dish was served with roasted garlic, grilled lemon, sea salt and au jus on the side and chili. On top the steak, they sprinkled some chicharron. WOW, what a dish!! The steak was perfectly cooked, and sliced nicely to share. The chicharron was homemade and spiced nicely, loved the roasted garlic, soooo spreadable for the steak. Everything was perfect. You need to try this dish!! \n\n-We got a lot of food but you ALWAYS have room for dessert so we got the Chocolate Custard for $9. Served in a mason jar, you start with the custard, then topped with candied almonds, chocolate crumbs and coffee ice cream. It was a great way to end the evening. Not too heavy, just a nice few bites of chocolate and coffee. \n\nAs you can see, I had an amazing time here. From the ambiance details to the service, to the amazing food.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the natural light that fills their space! We came for brunch and there were plenty of seats available. Brunch is pretty casual here: seat yourself, grab your own utensils and water, order at Salumeria next door and they'll deliver it to your table. Phew! eliminates the whole waiting game and no need to really tip 20%! (unless they really kissed your butt!) \n\nI kept it light and healthy with a chopped salad of radicchio, romaine, peas, olive, provolone, pepperoncini, salumi, cucumbers tossed with a red wine vinaigrette. Classic and easy on the dressing, but not easy on the parmesan cheese! do you see the MOUND of queso piled on top of my greens?! heaven! I enjoyed my iced tea too. \n\nI did manage to take a bite out of my friend's fried chicken sandwich! OMG. Why the hell did I get a salad? 0_o  this fried chicken sammich is perfect in all accounts. Crispy, juicy, flavorful with a spicy aioli and a soft bun. You get some house made pickles on the side. The only thing wrong with this sandwich is the $14 price and it doesn't come with fries nor a salad which is a minor let down, really. \n\nI'll definitely be back to enjoy more of Central Kitchen's offerings. Pasta, sandwiches and maybe I'll even get a sighting of the cutie chef.", "author": "Janice C."}

The restaurant is located in a nice area of the Mission that is within walking proximity to Alamo Cinema, so it's a great place to grab dinner before watching a movie. D\u00e9cor and ambiance were great, but the food was just ok compared to Flour and Water. However, it definitely is easier getting a reservation at Central Kitchen, so it's a place worth checking out if you're in the area.\n\n[Dinner]\nI went with a friend who was vegetarian, so the restaurant has great options for that and we ended up splitting everything family style. My favorite dish was the mushroom and avocado dish, followed by the fry bread, charred summer squash, and finally the vegetarian tomato and ricotta tortelli dish. Even though the pasta comes from the same place, I had high expectations for this pasta dish, but all the pasta I've had at Flour and Water tasted better, so I was a tiny bit disappointed. They recommend two-three dishes per person if splitting family style, but we ordered fewer dishes and felt full after. \n\n[Drinks]\nI had the Dolores Park cocktail. It was reasonable for the price and tasted great. \n\n[Service / D\u00e9cor]\nI really love the ambiance and wooden d\u00e9cor in the restaurant. It is dimly lit and the two-person tables are rather tight together, but I think overall its very cozy and enjoyable for dinner. The service was great and our server gave us some great recommendations.\n\nI definitely would come back to Central Kitchen given its great location in the Mission to Alamo and the overall experience, so I would definitely at least giving this place a try if you can't get a lucrative reservation over at Flour + Water.", "author": "Alice Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-21", "description": "This review is solely for Brandon Jew's pop up at Central Kitchen as he held a special Chinese New Year dinner since his restaurant, Mister Jiu won't be opened till Fall.  \n\nTo go along with the CNY celebration, Central Kitchen was decorated with red lanterns.  He offered a $75 family style menu featuring 10 items in four courses.  He also previewed some future dishes from Mister Jiu, like a two coursed preparation of duck.  \n\nFood:\n\nFirst Course \n\nOsmanthus Salad - Very refreshing!  The salad had citrus, daikon, and orange blossom granita. \n\nWinter Chop Suey - Chop Suey is a dish of random ingredients thrown together.  Jew's take on this dish consisted of mung bean sprouts, mustard, cashew, pear, and kohlrabi.  This dish wasn't very unique as it reminded me of a salad. \n\nOxtail Terrine - The oxtail terrine was infused with black cardamom, licorice, star anise, and crispy garlic.  This dish reminded my cousin of the five spice beef that you can order at Taiwanese restaurants.  Simple, yet tasty!\n\nSecond Course \n\nSizzled Fish - Jew used halibut for this dish and it included turnips, ginger, and black bean.  At the moment, I'm unable to eat raw food, therefore, I wasn't able to taste this dish.  My cousin said it was good, but the black bean was very faint.  \n\nHangtown Egg Foo Young - Egg Foo Young is basically an omelette dish.  Embedded in this egg foo young is lap cheong (Chinese sausage), watercress with fried oysters on top.  I loved the simplicity of this dish and it was very tasty.  I kept going back for more.  \n\nHot and Sour Cioppino - I thought the cioppino was just average.  None of the people in my group were huge fans.  Hubby said it was spicy, but he kept eating it.  The cioppino had today's catch (not sure what type of fish was used), tomatoes, coriander, yuba, and XO.  It was also garnished with cilantro, which soaked in my soup.  Therefore, I didn't care for the broth cause of the cilantro taste. \n\nThird Course\n\nHay and Tea Smoke Duck Breast - I believe this was Brandon's take on Peking duck as you use the same concept to eat it.  This dish was just okay.  I couldn't taste the tea or smokiness when I bit into the duck breast.  \n\nDuck Leg Won Ton Soup - Delicious! This was another simple dish that out shined some of the others listed on the menu.   It's probably one of the better won ton's I've had in a while.  The duck meat and shrimp blended well together and the wrapper tasted homemade.\n\nDessert\n\nAlmond Milk Jello with Kishu Mandarins - Very creamy!  When I eat almond jello, it usually has a very strong flavor.  However, the almond flavor here was too light.  It was still delicious though.\n\nLi Hing Mui and Guava Sorbet with Cherry Blossoms - The saltiness from the li hing balanced out the tartness of the guava sorbet extremely well.\n\nBlack Sesame, Coconut, Banana Cake with White Sesame Cream - The black sesame flavor went very well with the banana cake. Having both potentially strong flavors in the same dish here, I thought one would overpower the other but it was very balanced.\n\nOverall, the three of us agreed that the simple dishes tasted the best.  Also, I was sightly disappointed that Brandon Jew didn't offer the sticky rice in the lotus leaf.  I was looking forward to tasting it.  I don't think the meal was worth $75/pp.  However, I would like to try Mister Jiu when it opens in the fall.", "author": "Candice H."}

The green garlic ranch will help those of you who may think the Calabrian chili spicy. We ended up ordering the Josey Bread and butter just to sop up the left over dressing. But then had to try the butter it came with and OMG!  My husband and I had the rigatoni and the pappardelle. So good in their own way. Pappardelle had a sweet nuttiness to it. The rigatoni had a delicious buttery, with a pleasant herbaceousness. Could not go wrong with either. Then, after ALL that, we shared the beef cheek and mashed potatoes.

Other than the chocolate custard dessert which was delicious, everything else -- starters, mid-courses, mains -- were nothing special, the food wasn't served quite hot enough, and the portions were tiny. For example: their porcini spaghetti was $32 (don't be fooled, the $21 on the menu is for a 'mid-course' portion, which basically means a half portion). $32 is well more than some of the best pasta dishes I had in NYC at Mario Batali restaurants and the like. And here's the kicker: it was decent, not great. Turns out the porcini is only in the pasta dough itself, not actually in the sauce, so the rich wild mushroom flavor you expect from porcini was nowhere to be found, and the tangy huckleberry sauce overpowered everything. I won't bother going into the details of the $16 onion soup or the $28 vegetable entree which amounted to a completely ordinary handful of broccoli, cauliflower and brussels sprouts with a drizzle of sauce. Something I would make at home on a Monday. (When I politely mentioned to the manager-in-training that that seemed high for just vegetables, he reminded me that 'produce in California is expensive.') \n\nI tend to like more homestyle, earthy, unpretentious kinds of restaurants myself, and I understand that others might prefer the adventurous kinds of places that experiment with all types of new flavor combinations. BUT, if a restaurant is going to go that route, shouldn't their palates be sophisticated enough to get the flavors balanced in the right way? Isn't that what you are paying for? \n\nIn the end, Central Kitchen has the look and feel of a restaurant that should be great. But when it comes down to it, it's about the food. And here it simply falls short. Central Kitchen is one of those places that is trying too hard and in the process being delinquent on the basics. I believe there are many, many restaurants where you get a better food experience for about half the price.", "author": "Michael Z."}

The food was fresh, full of flavor, and seriously wholesome.\n\nThe seating was gorgeous with an \"outdoor\" terrace feel but covered up so you won't get rained on. I would love to come to this place for a fancier sit down dinner.\n\nThe only thing I was not a fan of - the long wait to order our food. We had only 4 parties in front of us for brunch, yet it took us about 35 minutes to wait until our turn. I'm not sure what happened in between, but it felt like everybody was just taking their dandy time.\n\nLuckily, the food really does make up for it. Those donuts were out of this world and the avocado toast is to die for. They really go ham on the avocado spread and I am all about that. Not to mention price - while it is a bit more expensive, it's still pretty fair in comparison to what you can get in LA.

I loved the creative brunch menu, something you don't see in San Francisco as often as you might think. The food is on the expensive side, but overall pretty tasty. While this wasn't a home run, I would definitely come back and *absolutely* recommend you at least come by for the bacon sticky bun. \n\nMEDJOOL DATE STICKY BUN ($8) - 4 STARS:\nI must admit this is the smallest $8 pastry I've ever eaten; however, it is a genius combo. It is topped with an incredible ricotta cheese spread which I could probably eat straight and BACON. For those unafraid of sugar, a great way to start your meal. \n\nMISSION HUEVOS ($15) - 3 STARS:\nscrambled eggs. smoked tomato. avocado. charred padron-corn salsa. \nThis was a crowd favorite when polling the waiters. I thought it was a unique take on huevos because it was topped with deep fried tortilla chips that had an amazing flaky texture that went perfectly with the eggs. The overall flavor depended on those chips - I wish there was a complementing sauce - and the eggs were not as soft scrambled as I prefer. \n\nFRIED CHICKEN BENEDICT ($18) - 3 STARS:\nbuttermilk biscuit. ham. hollandaise.\nThis was a very creative take on eggs benedict, and I loved the batter on the chicken which was fried extra crispy and the pairing with pancetta was brilliant. The chicken was small, more like nuggets, and a bit dry - I also have a personal preference for traditional english muffins. Excellent poached egg execution, fun combination, and appreciated the balance in the hollandaise, but not my favorite benedict.  \n\nBAKED EGGS (3.5 STARS) - $17: \npork stew. chickpeas. cabbage. chili bread crumbs. parmesan\nThis was flavorful but I felt it was too heavily filled with chickpeas, and needed a LOT more meat and sauce.", "author": "Jess C."}

I had told them in advance that it was our anniversary and had requested a quiet table . . .  we actually ended up in the middle of the restaurant at a pretty noisy table. \n\nSERVICE: Our server was nice but appeared to have the entire outdoor area as his section and had 6-7 tables (a couple of them larger tables--more than 4-tops) at a time.  This was too many tables.  There was always a long wait (several minutes to be greeted, 15 minutes for our glasses of wine after we had ordered them, and a long wait to order food--he said he would be back \"in a minute\" to take our order but it was more like 20), and over our five courses he never once came back to check on how the food was or how the wine was. \n\nAlso, no one ever mentioned our anniversary or did anything.  I am not expecting free food or anything, but it would have been nice of them to acknowledge our special occasion in some way, since I did tell them in advance.  This was very disappointing as it was supposed to be a special (and rare) night out for us.\n\nFOOD:  On the bright side, the food was EXCELLENT.  Heirloom tomato bread salad was absolutely delicious and we both agreed it was perfectly seasoned and balanced--although it was advertised with pole beans, and there were zero beans on that dish.  Charred squash with yogurt dressing was also yummy, but could have used more of the yogurt sauce.  Squid ink fusilli was scrumptious; I barely let the hubby have any! His pork with vadouvan and fennel was also very good. \n\nThe chocolate custard dessert was wonderfully balanced, not too sweet with the salt and the bitterness of the coffee ice cream, and a little crunch from the cookie . . .  perfection.  I wanted to order another.\n\nWine was in the middle. The pinot was a bit too light and fruity, and the Malbec \"Bordeaux\"-style blend was definitely too sweet (and not very Bordeaux-like . . . we just got back from a trip to St Emilion in the Bordeaux region).  However the Mencia was a nice big red.\n\nOverall, I am torn . . .  I loved the food and found the portion sizes and seasoning and balance to be very good across the board; the tomato salad and chocolate custard being real standouts . . .  but it really took something away from our anniversary experience to be at a noisy table in the middle of the room with such slow service.", "author": "Janice T."}

Only Bourdain would have enough balls to talk about his gristle missile on CNN. And for him to say, it's \"enormous\"? Big balls, I tell you.\n\nEven though I'm not a fan of Flour + Water, I've been wanting to go to their sister restaurant, Central Kitchen since they opened last year. Mixed reviews, however, kept me at bay.\n\nThat's until I read that Central Kitchen also offers brunch. Considering dinner for two at Central Kitchen would set us back over $200 for the tasting menu, I figure brunch was a safer bet. Except brunch is definitely not their strong suit. Not the day we went at least.\n\nPerhaps Bourdain was right when he wrote in his book, \"Kitchen Confidential\" that brunch is a \"dumping ground for the odd bits left over from Friday and Saturday\".\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Fried Chicken Benedict w/ Biscuit, Ham & Hollandaise  ($17): http://bit.ly/GPA1pk. Besides the perfectly poached eggs, this dish was poorly executed: http://bit.ly/1eo9qM1. The tiny fried chicken nuggets were awful (super dry and stringy) and tasted like it had been fried early that am then kept warm under a heat lamp. Same goes for the biscuit. The dish was pretty to look at though.\n\nMr. NSS' Soft Scrambled Eggs w/ Kale, Ricotta & Rosemary Avocado Toast  ($14) didn't fare any better: http://bit.ly/19KTCxE. It was so bland with a mushy (not fluffy) texture. The blank look on his face when I asked how he liked his dish said it all. He also ordered a side of Smoked Bacon ($5) which was more sweet than smoky. It wasn't crispy either and was more like Chinese jerky. And no, it wasn't like Sweet Maple's millionaire's bacon which has a caramelized brown sugar crust and a peppery finish. \n\nAs a side note, Central Kitchen is not a place I would bring a group of meat and potatoes type of guys who love a good hearty brunch.

It was definitely one of the better ones I've had.\n\nSurprisingly, the Roasted Carrots w/ Buffalo Milk Custard, Grains & Seeds ($13) was the best dish during brunch and fondly reminded me of dishes I had at Atelier Crenn and Manresa: http://bit.ly/1an8YcN. The combo of the sweet baby carrots, silky smooth custard, toasty grains, and crunchy sunflower seeds were deliciously satisfying and seriously left me wanting more. Who would have known rabbit food would taste so phucking good?\n\nService was somewhat as bumpy as the food. We had reservations for brunch yet there was over a 30 minute wait to be seated. Factor in the insanely loud [bad] music blaring in the background it made us all a bit irritated. Now this coming from a girl that would sit in front of the speakers at raves; millenniums ago but still, I can tolerate loud music but not at a nice restaurant please. \n\nLuckily, things ran more smoothly when we were seated and my friend kindly asked our waiter if they can turn down the music (they nicely did--thank you!). The staff was very pleasant and the food service was timely. At the end of brunch, the hostess came to apologize for the wait which was much appreciated.\n\nIf they keep the music down, Central Kitchen would make such a cute and romantic date place.

The sides were also a proverbial 'noodle-scratcher'. Charred brocollini? Pickled something or another? Bulgur wheat?  It was boring and mundane. Flat-footed and pedestrian for what expectations I had of this place. \n\nHalibut tartar was also fishy. Something was off. A dish that sounded better on paper than what materialized in front of me. \n\nThe hummus with pine nuts was a winner. Finally something to be happy about. So very flavorful. \n\nThe onion soup was a joke. Skip this entirely. Not going to waste time describing what a total and utter let down it was. I'm angry just thinking about it. \n\nThere was a pasta dish. And I wish I remember what it was. My friend ordered it, and it was, by far, the best thing on the menu. But again. It's pasta. If you fuck up pasta you may as well turn in your apron, chef. \n\nThere was a desert with yogurt. Or was it cheese.. With what tasted like pur\u00e9ed kale. That was the worst choice of the night. \n\nThank got the chocolate pudding was the last taste in my mouth... Otherwise this would have been a 2 star review. \n\nService... Where to begin. Was it the unapologetic host? Or the server with little to no patience? Or was it her inability to be genuine and sincere?  Her smile was forced. So was her manners. The experience was painful. I get it, being brassy and abrasive can be cute... But not tonight sweetness. I noticed you kept ducking into that little store in the property every 20 minutes. Was it for another line? Disco snow makes you numb... And I'm guessing you needed it.", "author": "Jade D."}

I went there with a group of co-workers who were raving about how awesome this place was.  First, I could not believe the prices for things that, frankly, didn't seem cooked well and was designed to impress visually but was not filling.  I tried to be cool and spent like $50 for a teeny appetizer and a glass of house wine.  That's a lot of money for me.  Others in my group also felt kinda bummed that they needed to spend some money at this joint.  Anyways...this place is just around the corner from El Farolito on 24th St.  So, as soon as we were done, I went there and got me a Super Carne Asada and a horchata and life was normal again.  As I walked to the taqueria, I started to wonder about how quickly the gentrification was coming along in that neighbourhood.  This hip place was such a contrast to the the neighborhood is in terms of the people and other businesses.  It made me sad.  I won't go to this place again and I don't recommend others do either.  There are other places that could, frankly, use your money and give you a more satisfying experience.", "author": "Jo F."}

We were fortunate to get a reservation (albeit at 9:15pm) at the super hip Central Kitchen, which was still super packed by the time we arrived.  The restaurant has some really cool and unique dining spaces and we were seated at a corner table by the bar.\n\nWe considered ordering the tasting menu for $90/person, but instead opted to share 7 dishes from the regular menu including two appetizers, three first courses, and two entrees.  To pair, we ordered a bottle of an Oregon pinot noir ($57).  Bread and butter are available upon request, and were both fantastic.  My only criticism is that each slice is served to order, which is kind of annoying.\n\nOur first dish was the melon and cucumber salad ($12) with avocado, fig leaf yogurt, and fresno chili.  I really enjoyed how refreshing each bite was and it served as a fantastic palette cleanser as we began our meal.\n\nNext came the beef tartare ($16) with fermented turnip, smoked curds, and plancha bread.  My buddies really enjoyed this dish, but I felt it fell a little short and could have used a touch of salt.  Textures however, were very pleasing.\n\nThis was followed by the seared rock cod ($15) with sourdough, rouille, and garlic scape-clam broth.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the broth was delicious and subtle.  This was a dish that we all agreed we would order again.\n\nThe charred squid ($15) with tomato, peppercorn fregola, and garum was one of my personal favorites from the evening, and I absolutely loved the charred spice flavors.  The grain it was served with was delicious and one that I would definitely make at home.\n\nThe eggplant ($14) with roman mint, teleme, and lentil-pint nut streussel was also another fantastic dish, and the eggplant was kept fairly firm.  The streussel was really yummy, especially when everything was enjoyed in one bite.\n\nOur server recommended their hen ($25) with poached fig, pickled squash, basil, and pistachio and mixed roast of pork ($26) with peach, pickled chard, and mustard seed as our entrees.  By far my favorite dish of the evening was the hen, which must have been sous vide in order to achieve the tenderness of the dish.  It was amazing from first bite to last.  The pork was very nice as well, and my favorite bits were the fatty pork belly slices.  It was also very nice, but could not compare to the amazing hen.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered their take on peaches and cream ($10) as well as something I remember as a strudel with fruity sorbet ($10).  The texture on the basil ice cream with the peaches was unbelievable and I have never experienced anything like it.\n\nService was very good and attentive, and both the hostess and server were knowledgable about the dishes and their wines.  The dining experience was lovely, and something I look forward to repeating.  It's not the most affordable dinner in the world, and with drinks, tax, and tip, came out to about $100/person.  However, it was definitely memorable and to that end, totally worth it.\n\nFood: 9/10\n\nService: 9/10\n\nPrice: $$$$\n\nAtmosphere: 9/10", "author": "Joe M."}

The steak was very flavorful and perfectly cooked.  The porchetta, although sounds great, I thought was somewhat disappointing.

He's more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy, but I wanted him to try upscale food for a change. Here's what we tried, broken down by dish:\n\nDirty rice croquettes with duck & remoulade - these were great; fried perfectly crisp and I enjoyed the duck filling going with the cool remoulade. \n\nLiver mousse with hazelnut & pluot - this might have been my favorite dish of the night. Beautiful presentation with the toast and the pluot jam with hazelnut on top was the bee's knees. You can always ask for more toast as well.\n\nAlbacore tuna with charred avocado, padron & seeds - this dish was completely bland. There was no acidity to go with the tuna. The padron peppers were mostly flavorless. The one thing I enjoyed were the tomatoes.\n\nHalibut with tomato, cucumber water, chili & olive crumb - the halibut was overcooked and again, most of the dish was bland. Olive crumb aside, the fish, tomato, and cucumber were very one dimensional in flavor and texture. It was unworthy as an entree. \n\nMixed roast of pork with bulgar wheat, swiss chard, peach & ginger - the pork was overdone. My dad had this dish and while he enjoyed the flavor profile and the combination of tastes, he agreed that the meat was completely overcooked. \n\nChamomile oil cake with fennel & fig sorbet - there was nothing special about the dessert. The fennel & fig sorbet didn't excite the palate. \n\nOverall, our meal started off on a couple of high notes and then slipped off from there. I think each dish was missing a couple of execution points. The entrees were a major disappointment. Food aside, the atmosphere and service were exceptional.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

The occasion was my birthday actually, and Jamie W. and I wanted a relatively low-key dining experience but one that would still be memorable. It sort of delivered. It's in the Mission but away from the hubbub of Mission itself in a handsome, post-modern building that made me think it was once an architect's office. Although definitely on the higher end, the vibe is casual, and the noise level a bit too loud for my taste with the sound of convivial diners competing with the blaring music coming from the speakers.\n\nI generally don't notice what the wait staff is wearing, but I thought the dorm-party outfits felt way too informal for the setting. Me a snob? Get your elbows off the table before you say that to me. Anyway, one of the servers dropped off a couple of warm rolls which were nice with the little dab of butter they left us (see photo). We were trying to nibble rather than devour them as we perused the short menu. We decided to start with the $7 Fried Peppers with Caper Aioli and Lemon, which was a nice-sized plate full of piquillo peppers that quickly became an addiction (see photo). For our real appetizers, Jamie decided on the $12 Three Cheeses (none of which I could remember) that came nestled on a flat piece of crisp lavash along with dollops of fennel preserve mixed with dill and walnuts (see photo).\n\nIt was shareworthy, at least from my standpoint, and quite tasty if somewhat unadorned. It tasted more appropriate for dessert, and sure enough, it did show up again on the dessert menu. Mine was a more self-centered choice, the $13 Tomato Salad with crushed avocado, ginger and peanut (see photo), a striking melange of red tomato slices and chunks of fried green tomatoes. Quite refreshing and gone in a matter of minutes. Entrees were comparatively speaking, the weakest part of the evening. Jamie ordered the $29 Pork with Apples, Quinoa, Spiced Bread, Cippolini and Sage, which while savory with the pork prepared two ways, was a bit on the bland side (see photo).\n\nMine suffered a bit from the same state, the $29 Hen with Oysters, Lettuces and Smoked Tomatoes in an emulsion I couldn't quite figure out (see photo). I personally thought the serving size was rather on the paltry side even though the hen was prepared impeccably. We decided to share a dessert, and even though Jamie is not a lemon fan, he indulged me on my birthday and allowed us to have the $10 Lemon Cake with slices of nectarine, yogurt mousse and hazelnut (See photo). A pretty presentation, it amounted to a few bites for each of us. There's definitely a lot of quality ingredients served here. It's just that some of the executions still need a bit more work and testing. OK, OK, I'm willing to be the culinary guinea pig.\n \nFOOD - 3.5 stars...very nice ingredients, some well plated, some need more work\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a split decision on this...nice modern decor but rather loud considering the price tag\nSERVICE - 3 stars...pretty good but some more polish would be nice\nTOTAL - 3 stars...very good but not flat-out great when you think about the pedigree", "author": "Ed U."}

Lovely little pasta pockets in a cream sauce mixed with small cubes of pumpkin.\nMain entree was the wagyu bavette steak, served in a cast-iron skillet pan, accompanied with shilling beans and baby carrots atop a savory bagna cauda (another fave from the Piedmont region). There was a pickled acidity to the vegetables, so it was key to mix with the bagna cauda.\n\nDessert was also fabulous. The chocolate custard was my favorite vs. the carrot cake. It was essentially a pot de creme with the right amount of salt on top, along with a canele of coffee ice cream and toasted almonds. Magic in your mouth!

A reclaimed space has been spruced up with reclaimed wood, concrete floors, and many other industrial elements into a sleek new eatery of modern cuisine.\n\nLooking at the wine list: Pineau des charenytes, Scholium Naucratis, Copain, Geverey Chambertin...interesting fantastic and concise wine list.

We were celebrating his birthday and although it was really early dinner special time for us (because we were going out to an 8 pm show) and not that packed, it was super loud (due to the Pandora/Spotify soundtrack cranked up) and the service was haphazard (our dishes were handed to the table next to ours in front of our eyes) and the server didn't respond to requests.\n\nWe weren't very hungry, but order a chicory salad that was ok, small with about 4 croutons, decent Cowgirl creamery cheese, and then these very rubbery grilled pieces of persimmon.  It also had chive pieces.  Neither the chives or persimmons made sense and kind of collided with the other bitter and salty flavors.\n\nHearing that the pasta was good, we both ordered a pasta.  I am vegetarian, but also avoid rich browned butter and cheese so the only option for me was a Cavatelli with a hot pepper red sauce.  This small bowl appeared about 1/2 hour after the salad with what looked like food from a Star Trek Klingon dinner (I think it was called Klingon Gagh).  The Cavatelli described as \"bean like\" were ribbed and pretty much looked like a bunch of maggots in a bowl of red sauce.  It was not at all appetizing to look at.  Eating it revealed an uneven gummy mess that stuck to my teeth.  In addition, there were large pieces of garlic and some cracked spice that basically blew out your palate.  I ended up not eating it.\n\nMy husband had the chestnut torchio which he said was overcooked and kind of falling apart.  It was supposed to have brussel sprouts and he said he saw about 3 brussel sprout leaves -- so if you don't like brussel sprouts -- I guess this is the dish for you.\n\nThe best thing was the very lovely sparkling water and a delicious bottle of 2003 Pichon Longueville (a $300 bottle of wine retail) that we brought for a corkage fee of $25.    Everything is extra (two bread rolls are $6), portions are small, service is brusque.", "author": "Andrea P."}

We were really looking forward to having dinner here.  The venue  was spacious, with 2 large farm tables, sparse in decor but in a good way, clean and open, great neighborhood views  with windows all around. The candles were a great addition to the loft area. I would love to host a gathering at this venue.  \n\nService was good, server 1 of 3 was great about letting us know about the ingredients in each of our dishes and gave great detail about the wine being poured.  The other server was on the chilly side.  One of the guests had asked about some of the unfinished dishes that were being taken away and if we could take them home. The server replied, \"sure, most people don't take them home, but I can save it for you.\"  Did she say that out loud? Yes, she did. \n\nI understand the concept about letting food shine on its own, tomatoes should taste like sweet fruit..etc., yes, agreed, but enhancing your ingredients with spices is good too.  Baba ganoush was bland maybe a little more lemon? Cowgirl cheese and preserves, always good.  But 2 tiny pieces for 4 people? Pork Pate was an overly, toasted fennel would have been a good addition . We found that the gem salad was bland, chicken breast, gamy, (poached?) and could have benefitted from something briny, like olives, figs or some citrus.  Best dishes, beet salad, pasta ragu. LIterally 1/4 cup of pasta for each person, some guests didn't get any. Portions were very small.  The best part of the meal was the chocolate custard and the wine pairings. Over all, great venue, good service, amazing wine and dessert, food and portions need attention.", "author": "Chris O."}

It's been tough to choose what amazing SF spot to feature as my 1000th review and Central Kitchen somewhat got \"lucky.\" They deserve 5 stars for sure and are fresh on my mind since I just finished a great meal there. I owe Piccino an amazing review and will write that soon but, for now, here is number 1000... \n\nLet's start with the atmosphere. The interior space is beautiful - there is a lot of foliage and even a vine creeping up one wall. There is also a fountain including a big, pretty industrial pipe. Parts of the ceiling is made of windows (not skylights per say since bigger areas of glass) and it's beautiful to see the night sky up above. There are also relaxing, large lights strung from the rafters. As a friend noted to me before I went, the music was perfect (which I find restaurants often get wrong) - the likes of the Lumineers and the Rolling Stones. I ended up picking up the dinner tab since I bet my bf that Wild Horses was by someone other than the Rolling Stones... anyway... \n\nWe were tempted by the tasting menu but opted to go a la carte since there were some meaty things on the tasting menu which I wouldn't have loved. We started with the fried pickles with dipping sauce ($6) which were delicious and a generous portion. Next we enjoyed the melons, cucumber, and avocado salad (around $12) with a fig yogurt sauce. This also impressed. Our final appetizer was the raw tuna (around $14) which was also featured on tonight's tasting menu. We shared the halibut with olive main and the fish was grilled to perfection. We ate every last bite (and forkfuls of sauce) of every single dish.\n\nFor drinks, we enjoyed 3 glasses of red wine ($11 -  $15) between the two of us. Our waitress knew the wines well and made good suggestions (though I've never heard a wine described as \"chewy,\" this description did seem appropriate for one glass we had). For dessert, we ordered the chocolate mousse (or pudding)  ($10)- it came in a cute jar and had delicious layers including salted almonds, coco nib ice cream, and a chocolate madeleine. We also shared the small french press of Mr. Espresso coffee ($4). As I mentioned earlier, I picked up the tab but I wouldn't have made the wager had I not been willing to pay. The food was great and worth it so it was a perfect meal to treat my great (and myself) to!", "author": "Meghan P."}

It's not too loud and easy to carry on a quiet conversation. \n\nOnto the Food: \n\n1. MISSION FIGS - blue cheese. coppa di testa on the side. DELICIOUS. I obviously skipped the meat portion, but the creamy preparation of the blue cheese with the fig is wow. \n\n2. MELON & BURRATA - japanese cucumber. fennel pollen. cute presentation, but missing the punch. A little rock salt / spice / acid would have knocked it out of the park. \n\n3. SQUASH MALTAGLIATI - smoked cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. aleppo. sunflower seed. One of the BEST PASTA dishes I have evvvvver had. The fresh pasta was so crisp and the sauce was unbelievably flavorful. I cleaned my plate (which has happened 5x in all of history) and could eat this every day. \n\n4. V got the KING SALMON - pepper panade. potatoes. boquerones.

The reservation was made a week or so in advance and we were told for parties of 8 or more, everyone will need to do the tasting menu @$89/pp. My friend who coordinated the dinner had to speak to someone different than the hostess because of a larger party. He had a lot of trouble getting hold of the person to confirm certain food allergy issues we had within our group. Even on the day of the dinner, he had to call multiple times to confirm the allergy issues will be taken care of. We finally got confirmation...but it was not taken care of.\n\nWe were promptly seated at 6pm. The restaurant is cute and cozy. But upon arrival, it was approximately 90 degrees inside. We asked the server if they can turn the heat down or off, she said yes. but nothing happened. Eventually my friend asked again later, and it was finally turned off.\n\nFirst issue of the night was the two different tasting menus that was given to us. Both menus had the same date printed on, and everything on the menus were the same except for the meat entree. We confirmed with our server and she said one of the menu was yesterdays. I was disappointed because i was looking forward to the duck entree.\n\nSecond issue of the night was their extreme lack of attention to details. The one person who had food allergies (nuts and shellfish) was repeatedly offered dishes that contained nuts. After a few dishes, he had to ask the server what's in each dish and reconfirm that there were no nuts. \n\nThe food was mediocre. I thought a few dishes was a bit too salty. The server would explain what each dish was to the first person they serve it to, but then not to the rest of the party. A few of us had to look at the menu to see what dish was being served.\n\nI think this restaurant definitely has potential, but from our experience, it's not worth trying.", "author": "Terry C."}

I will not be back. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best. Tiny little plates, expensive and nothing to write home about. The cod was fishy and not interesting.  The cheese was not interesting. Duck was ordinary. There was not one interesting plate. We are both crazy about good food. And we are not impressed by food here. \n\nWe sat at the patio. We were sitting right next to each other and we can't hear each other. The music was so loud. We requested the waitress to turn it down. The music got turned down only to go back up again. We requested to be moved to a different table. My wife and I still missed half the conversation in a table of four because of the crazy loudness of music. I can not be the only one complaining about this. Maybe this was specific to that one night or maybe this is an ongoing issue. I am not sure. \n\nLast thing that tipped the balance for us was the bill was so super high that my wife and I left the restaurant and said to each other \"what the heck is going on\". We decided to go over the bill as we were walking to our car. We drank two bottles of wine. They charged us for three. They charged us double for one of the two bottles we ordered. I immediately went back to the restaurant and asked them to correct it. And they did. \n\nThe only positive thing I can say (other than nice setting) is that the wine menu is great. I ordered a Premier Cru Burgundy and a Nebbiolo. Both were absolutely fantastic. \n\nWe had a wonderful time because of the company. We were with interesting, fun people.

The food and its presentation definitely matched the theme as well.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nDuck Rice Croquettes - a bit odd because of the dried meat shavings that were sprinkled on top. The croquette itself was delicious but the garnish gave it a sandy texture and made it look unappetizing. \n\nLiver Pate - Damn this is the cutest p\u00e2t\u00e9 jar I've ever seen. It's like a terrarium but for meat. The radishes and layers of jam, fat, and liver were great. I've had better pate but presentation is just killer.\n\nSeared Tuna - Perfectly cooked fish that almost had a buttery texture. I felt the dish itself was a bit small and veggies included didn't really add or compliment the tuna.\n\nHen - Chicken was seasoned and cooked really well. The meat was perfectly pink but again I just wanted more food. \n\nSquid - Again well cooked and plated. But just missing something, Je ne sais quio. Perhaps a sauce, salt, or bigger portions. Ugh!\n\nIce Cream for dessert - Wasn't on the menu but our server was nice enough to accommodate us. This was our highlight of the meal. A (small) scoop each of basil, fig, coffee, and peach. Each were garnished with either a graham or chocolate cookie.\n\nService was awesome. Wine and Beer for drinks only but there's a bar right next door. I want to like this place... I really do. It's like finally going on a date with that cute girl you always liked but you're just realizing something is just a little off about her and you don't know what it is.

I was pretty happy. \n\nMy friend was really hungry and was disappointed when I didn't want to order the PORCHETTA for two. $80. He's a big eater, and it didn't surprise me when he decided to order it for himself. \n\nIt was, in a word: horrible. I've never seen so much fat on a plate. He was confused and kept trying to find the meat in the fat. If we would have shared it we would have both starved. $80?? Granted there were amusing accoutrements/accompaniments to the dish, but if The Emperor Has No Clothes were a dish, this would be it. \n\nWe kept wondering \"do some people just eat the fat??\" He's too nice and wouldn't say anything. I would have sent it back. He also noticed the pours on the wine were really light. \n\nThis place can be really intimidating: total foodie place. But we eat in some pretty amazing places all over town and all over the world. It was his birthday dinner, so I didn't want to say anything, but when the check came and with tip it was almost $300. . . well I decided to take it to Yelp. \n\nIt confirmed my impression of Central Kitchen after eating there three times now: when it's good it's AMAZING, but when it misses it really misses.

I was a little worried about the portions based on the other reviewers' comments, but I was actually pleasantly surprised.\n\nEverything we had was really tasty.

Their menu changes constantly so I was bummed that all of the things that sounded great from the yelp reviews were not available.\n\nIt also means I cant check the menu to remember everything we got. We got the chicken liver mousse, which was good but sweeter than I expected. We also got an appetizer with yogurt, radishes and I think quinoa. I really enjoyed that and would definitely get it again. The bread was very good but very small. I could have eaten 3 more!\n\nMy entree was a pork belly dish. It was good but not very memorable as I cant really recall what was on my plate. One of my friends ordered the cod and it was good but also not anything that memorable. I think the appetizers were more interesting than the entrees. \n\nWhile everything was well executed and tasty, I thought that the entrees could have been more interesting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-14", "description": "(See pics) Review #1195. Creative California cuisine and good drinks, somewhat slow service (opening night chaos) but friendly staff to ease the waiting.\n\nNote that the location is hard to find at night since the address and door are on Florida Street but the entrance is actually on 20th Street and is right at the corner. Also quite hard to find parking so plan more time beforehand.\n\nFood wise, while the a la carte menu looked mighty interesting, we decided to take a chance with the grand opening night night tasting menu just to make the Thursday more interesting.\n\n*-*-* Food *-*-*\n5 courses of small bites that were California style, meaning fresh ingredients in small bites and in MMM / creative / interesting / risky moves:\n\nSoda mix with celery and almond milk - risky since it was a bit too bubbly and sweet, not quite a palate cleanser.\n\nVegetable Jelly with salmon bite - risky as the jelly was bland to a bitter finish. The salmon was the savior to bring back the flavor.\n\nHead cheese (grilled pork) on bite size toast - interesting and good starter.\n\nMussels/clams with bone marrow vinaigrette - interesting concept and while presented quite pretty, the mussels and clams did not taste too fresh.\n\nPeas with cheese - MMM totally amazing broth and very delicious peas that were vibrant green and were perfectly cooked. The broth was really, really good.\n\nAbalone with egg yolk - interesting abalone with decent delicate delicious taste. The egg yolk? not so sure if it's the best ingredient to complement as the egg had a strong rich taste. Also, the green onions were a bit stem-y to chew on though it was pretty and more like a garnish.\n\nRoasted duck breast, as well as minced / pate style style with spring onions - creative and interesting as the 4 slices were good and lighter taste, contrary to common fattier taste. The minced piece was happy fatty greasy. This dish had the best wine pairing.\n\nFennel Sorbet with yogurt - interesting with very light fennel. Good palate cleanser.\n\nJasmine tea ice cream with chopped nuts - interesting with strong jasmine what tasted like small tapioca at the bottom and chopped nuts. Good sweetness and not too sugary.\n\nChocolates - MMMMMMM the best with the liquid center flowing in your mouth.\n\nParting gift - MMMMM cocoa mini brownies so good like you were eating cocoa beans. So good.\n\n*-*-* Wines *-*-*\nNo liquor and the wine by the glass were on the inexpensive side:\n\nRose from Broc Cellars on tap - too sweet and might be good as a dessert wine on its own.\n\nSavennieres (similar to Chenin Blanc) - good as a pre-dinner drink on the light chilled sweet style.\n\nCold heaven Viognier - very good to drink just on its own with its refreshing crisp taste. Great pairing with food.\n\nBurgenland and Sangiovese - both good food pairing for the duck dish.\n\n*-*-* Service *-*-*\nOpening night chaos. Wait time in between courses was about 20 to 30 mins. Wines got a bit too warm to drink but quickly learned to order only when food arrived. Friendly smiles from servers who were trying to keep up with the busy restaurant. Service was progressively friendlier as the crowd got smaller and they were a bit less stressed out. The whole crew was nice and came around talking to the customers. And even it was way past their bedtime and after 3+ hours there, and it was almost 1am, they never rushed us.\n\n*-*-* Ambiance *-*-*\nWe sat outside at the patio where there were a few nice toasty heat lamps from above blasting. I loved it as it was getting chilly but the cloudless pitch dark sky was clear. You can see through the half covered wooden style with the soft glowing light, and with the fountain that has a comical pipe mouth (rather than a cute naked sculpture) and broken pieces of ceramics in the bottom. This waiting area offers a great spot waiting while you sip on your vino. The bathroom was through the ugly bright green hallway that seemed to be out of place. Might be better to cover with wooden / velvet / beads curtains or some other less harsh colors.\n\nMusic got much better late at night past midnight when it was switched from slightly pop upbeat music to O V Wright. This was where this patio style was the best to enjoy in, swirling your vino gazing into the crisp air sky and get intoxicated in the moment.\n\n*-*-* Tidbits *-*-*\nWe were told they plan to start doing retail (house made pasta) at the outside space. No affiliation of the style to F + W (have not eaten there.) This is definitely a local California sustainable style restaurant.", "author": "T L."}

They also rotate different dishes in and out of their menu (or substitute different seasonal ingredients)\n\nWarm Cinnamon Sticky Bun with bacon, dates, and walnuts ($7) - Delicious sticky bun. I wanted to eat all of it, but had to share with my dining companions. Soft, chewy, and not overly sweet. I couldn't really taste the bacon though. This is the most expensive sticky bun I've ever bought, but it was worth it.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mq9l0EKCDyuwvyAC5OmaqQ?select=H0Bm7sOPpF5_YVqv52e_JA#H0Bm7sOPpF5_YVqv52e_JA\n\nPretzel Bread, Bread Pudding ($8) - This was good; almost dessert like.

This was also good, but nothing to write home about. The salmon was tasty, but I could've done without this plate.\n\nBaked eggs, chorizo, sweet potato hash, cilantro ($14)\nI liked this dish - if you order it, get it a side of bread to go with it, because it will compliment it nicely. It was the right amount of spicy from the chorizo, and the eggs were baked so that the inside was runny. It was a tad bit on the oily / watery side, and the sweet potatoes were in cubes (not fried and crispy), but overall, it had great flavor. I don't know if I would necessarily order it again if I came, since I'd like to try other things.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mq9l0EKCDyuwvyAC5OmaqQ?select=gPpTztOMWLPEG8VnogQhfQ#gPpTztOMWLPEG8VnogQhfQ\n\nPoached eggs, polenta and crispy meat ($14) - This was by far everyone's favorite dish at the table. If there's some kind of variation of this dish when you come for brunch, you should get it. I'm not sure if it was fried chicken or pork on the dish, but it was delicious, and perfectly crispy. The eggs and polenta were just right and I've been thinking about this dish ever since eating it this morning. A not-to-miss! I'd definitely get this dish over and over again, and keep coming back here to eat this.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mq9l0EKCDyuwvyAC5OmaqQ?select=1VkBkzEPkGzV5_xR2p-cQw#1VkBkzEPkGzV5_xR2p-cQw\n\nAll in all, a great experience: no wait in line (make reservations at least 3-4 weeks in advance), nice atmosphere, and innovative dishes.

She was very helpful with the menu and despite the busy time was very attentive in checking in and apologetic in the time lapse between two of our courses. \n\nFood:  My favorite dish was my main course.  They offer a tasting menu but since my boyfriend and I are trying to only eat seafood and avoid other meats this was not an option for us.  Their menu is small but they have vegetarian and pescetarianism options. We had oysters to start which were ok but the jalapeno foam over powered the oysters. I wish they used less of the foam. Then we had something with avocado and asparagus?  It was okay in flavor but hard to eat and share.  I had the blackened cod for my main course with the fennel broth and artichoke hearts.  That was top notch.  I loved the blend of flavors. For dessert we had the three different chocolates but they all kind of blended in taste.

This was not the case at all, every praise I've heard about Central Kitchen rings true. \n\nThe food + the service are both off the charts. The menu changes daily depending on what is fresh and in season. There are a few options for tiny bites and then about 10 appetizers options (5 cold, 5 warms) and then a handful of entrees. They highly encourage sharing here which is right up my alley as I love to order a bunch of things and share with the group. We got two small bites, a majority of the appetizers and two entrees. My two favorites were the squash, parmesan cream and pesto salad and a seafood pasta, they were both unreal. Everything we ate was perfectly prepared and presented in such a pretty way! \n\nThe service was another thing that made them stand out. I've heard they're known for their impeccable service but I was still so impressed. Our main server was super nice, informative and engaging without being over bearing. Everyone who worked there seemed to genuinely enjoy being there. \n\nOver all it was a fantastic experience and I cannot wait to go back again soon.

I even got a letter from the owner about it - how it was going to be more accessible; a neighborhood spot. Well, it's not. My husband and I went with out of town guests right when it reopened, and I see no difference. Everything is still precious and pretentious, and very expensive. Beef tartare. Raw albacore. Duck liver mousse. Pork belly with fish sauce. This is high-end, special occasion type food. The dessert we tried was not even tasty! Blueberries in a bowl with poppy seeds and mushy creme fraiche. Tasted like a healthy breakfast, not a dessert. I'm disappointed that the big changes didn't happen. Flour + Water just down the street manages to use simple ingredients to make amazing dishes that anyone can enjoy, any day of the week. Not sure why Central Kitchen is so set on being overly high end.

Excellent special night out place (closing a round of funding, anniversary, promotion, proposal, birthday, etc.).\n\nI'm surprised by the reviews offering up 3 stars or less to Central Kitchen, because my experience last night deserved 5 stars. Are folks trying to sandbag this place? or it could be they had astronomical expectations. After all guys, it hasn't earned a Michelin star yet. (It will likely within a couple of years if they have the staying power, though!) Anyway...\n\nBACKGROUND:\nWe had reservations for two, one of the first seatings (blue-hair hour at 545PM).\nWe drove, and found spot off the bat on Florida at the corner of 20th.\nI was never that impressed with Flour+Water, I liked it, but didn't understand the hype, still I really love seeing what new things inspire chefs and wanted to check it out after the first couple of weeks since opening (to avoid the kinks in operations).\n\nAMBIANCE:\nLove it. Last night was beautiful out so the partial outdoor seating (they have heat lamps) looked enticing, though we were sat in a cozy corner inside, plenty of light. Modern design, clean lights, California style (whether you dressed up or down, it felt comfortable, not affected). \n\nSERVICE:\nExcellent. Here's what I mean: we weren't in 'want' of anything. Everyone was at the ready. We had water when we needed, additional wine, as we needed, etc. Also, they were very accommodating to my friend who had an allergy to one of the ingredients on the tasty menu, they were happy to make a substitution without being uppity about it. Everyone was attentive, kind, and not at all unctuous.\n\nFOOD:\nI've uploaded a photo of the tasting menu for May 31, 2012. So take a look there for reference.\nThe canapes felt like a fun opener where the chef was exploring a few things.\nStandout: the lemon granita.\nThe courses complemented each other nicely. Standouts: the clams and turnips in bone marrow vinaigrette and the halibut with yolk and artichoke puree.\n\nIt's pretty expensive, so don't let the neighborhood fool you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "description": "There was a promising start but overall a disappointing showing here.\n\nWe arrived shortly before open and were offered seats at a table (which we'd need to keep an eye on time at for an upcoming 7:30 reservation) or we were welcome to sit at the bar. The bar is where the wine is served but diners face the room, not the staff. We thought 1\u00be hours seemed plenty of time so sat.\n\nThe space is beautiful. We sat in the courtyard, full of natural light in the early Summer evening. We were finishing a glass of prosecco from next door and ordered a glass of cremant brut ros\u00e9 while we decided what to eat. Perhaps the early tippling led to the ordering of six dishes but if nothing else we set up for a large slice of the place. We ordered as there distinct courses, but responding \"yes\" to the server's question about sharing may have led to the dishes coming out one-at-a-time.\n\nFirst up was a delicious fig-topped liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 that set hopes high for the rest of the meal. It was so good, and such a pleasant blend of savory and sweet that I held on to it throughout the meal and had the last bit for dessert. Second in line was a carrot-and-whey dish. The pickled carrots had a pleasant crispness and the whey -- almost like a less-sweet cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche -- was enjoyed as a spread on the Kitchen's great bread. While definitely worth having once, it's not something I'd return to.\n\nThird came a watermelon-and-tomato salad with house-cured pork. The stars of this dish were the watermelon, pickled rind, baby cress, purple basil, and sesame dressing. Sadly, those components made up only a fifth of the dish and the rest was uniformly disappointing.\n\nFourth came a roast-onion, whipped crescenza, and tomatillo salsa dish. This one was interesting but wasn't a home-run. The onions had a wide range of done-ness. The more tender sections worked well with the delicious cheese and punchy tomatillo.\n\nAbout this time I asked to taste a pair of reds in preparation for our entr\u00e9es. After she left them, another server appeared and uttered one of the strangest introduction-apologies I've heard: \"I'll be taking over for your server because she is taking her federally-mandated 30-minute break.\" I can't help but think \"your server had to step out but I'll take care of you until she gets back\" would have been less jarring. Around this time I noticed it was nearing 7 pm and we'd been warned to be done by 7:15, though no one had since mentioned timing to us. Speaking of timing, the remnants of those two tastes sat on the table for a long time before someone came by to ask which one we wanted.\n\nWhat came out next was the low point -- a \"mixed grill\" of pork, every slice bulbous with thick fat: loin, belly, and head-cheese. (I couldn't tell the head-cheese from the belly, so I have to take the server's word on that.) I am fine with fat, and it doesn't normally turn me off, but this was just too close to being served thick slices of lard. The cuts were also nearly indistinguishable in flavor and texture, offering no option for the adipose-phobic. Once slice of belly I served to my G/F had gristle so inedible she had to spit it into her napkin. They took the item of our bill, and it sounded like we weren't the first to be taken aback by the presentation. A warning might be in order.\n\nThe final dish was squid a la plancha, a relatively standard presentation with olives and eggplant. While cooked well its flavor and overall impression were just \"fine.\"\n\nMy G/f thought all the dishes past the first two were surprisingly bland. She also found the various white wines she tried quite similar (all bone-dry and heavy on minerality) and many not worth the steep glass prices. Some brought to mind far more successful dishes at St Vincent, some just left us scratching our heads. Overall there is little chance we'll come back. Great bread and p\u00e2t\u00e9 can't make up for a two-for-six record. Combined with inattentive service this is not the recipe for return visits.\n\n(Cross-posted to Yelp.)", "author": "Joshua P."}

If you need to cancel, you need to give them at least 48 hours notice if you don't want your credit card charged. \n\nI have been looking forward to trying the food at Central Kitchen since it opened, but was disappointed in the dishes I had. There were too many components in each dish, and all the flavors did not work well together. I had made reservations for a party of 5 on a Friday night for 8:30pm a few weeks ahead time. We ran a little late, but they held the table for us, and seated us right away. We tried:\n \n-Complimentary Bread & Butter: Ok, but not the best bread and butter I've had at a restaurant. Also, our server never asked if we wanted more bread.\n-Kale Chips (w/Yogurt, Avocado, $7): I loved the crispy kale chips, but the tartness of the yogurt was overpowering. \n-Crispy Duck Tongues (w/Citrus, Liver Mousse, $7): Good, but very oily, and not even the citrus could cut the oily taste, although it overpowered the other flavors. The liver mousse was too thin/creamy for my taste, and I didn't think the mousse and duck tongue paired well together.\n-Three Cheeses (w/Lavosh, Fennel Preserve, Walnut, $14): Good, but nothing special. The lavosh was too dry/crispy and I didn't like it paired with the cheese.\n-Beef Tartare ($16): Just ok, not the best beef tartare I've had. I also didn't like the type of bread it was paired with, and would have preferred toast points or toasted baguette slices. Skip!\n-Seaweed Pasta Chitarra (w/Mussels, Sea Urchin, Bottarga Bread Crumb, $19): Sadly, just ok. I was looking forward to this dish the most, but it was bland! You couldn't taste the sea urchin at all, and I wouldn't get this again.\n-Octopus (w/Pork Belly, Blood Sausage, Pickled Mushroom, Almond, $20): This was everyone's favorite dish. The octopus had an amazing sear on it, and went well with most of the other components of this dish, like the blood sausage. The pork belly was just average, and I didn't think the pickled mushroom or almond was needed.\n-Chocolate Custard (w/Candied Almond, Coffee Ice Cream, $10): I loved the creamy chocolate custard, but the coffee ice cream was too strong tasting for me. \n\nThe best part about dining at Central Kitchen was the service- we needed to finish our meal before 10pm, and our server was super accommodating. I loved how efficient the kitchen was- Our dishes came out quickly but we didn't feel rushed through our dinner. However, I didn't like that the lighting in the restaurant was really dim, and that it was pretty loud in there. \n\nOverall, I wasn't that impressed by the dishes that I tried, and doubt I would come back since the portion sizes were also small for the price. Note that they change their menu here daily, so you have to come quickly if you see a dish you really want to try.

We avoided the larger, more expensive entree items because we wanted to try many plates and share them all. It was a vibrant Spring menu; lots of interesting compositions, flavors, textures. Everyone had a couple of favorites and we enjoyed all of the plates.\nMy second outing (August 2015) was with a \"vegetarian\" friend -- she eats chicken -- which makes her not a vegetarian in my book, but ... Anyway, that was a less inspiring meal because many of the plates were not available to us due to inclusion of meat. The only fowl they have is duck, which she didn't want to try. \nFinally, just this past week, I made a reservation for my parents and myself. We walked about 2 miles before arriving, which caused us to take a break halfway, grab a glass of wine and a snack -- poor planning since maybe we weren't as hungry as we should have been. We got 2 apps -- duck liver pate {{{Excellent}}} and sunchoke hummus {{{watery and bizarre}}}. We ended with three cold plates to share: a beet salad {{{delicious but not incredible}}} an albacore with pepper puree {{{I enjoyed, but parents didn't}}}  and a kabochka squash and apple salad {{{middle of the road}}}.\nI'm a little disappointed that my subsequent visits never lived up to the excellence I enjoyed my first time. Maybe it was the Fall menu, maybe it was more in line with everyone else's experience of this place: Should be great, wants to be great, but isn't really as amazing as it should be. \nAll that said, the service was excellent, the wine list is good and if it wasn't so damned loud, it was be enjoyable all around.

If you've been following the reviews/background info about this place at all then you know that they are still new and working some kinks out...\n\nAll of the service staff were lovely, not a single note of pretension, there was a few instances of confusion (from the very get go, having three people at the hostess stand repeatedly not seeming to know their role). Bread arrived at our table at the same time(seconds before) as our first bite (pallet cleanser) appeared. Strong leadership would really turn things around here, someone who could fine tune everything.\n\nMy group had the tasting menu, it was good. We started with a blueberry soda with fennel and im not sure what else (wasnt on the menu), it was a little bit more like a smoothy, difficult to drink, but tasted nice. This was followed by an interesting corn soup. Corn season just arrived so i was really excited to try it. Served in a small wine/shot glass, same style for the blueberry soda, and tasted good, it was warm corn juice with pistachio rimming the glass. Creative but the flavors were traditional and not too exciting. The bottle selection is very affordable with a lot of nice bottles in the $30-50 range. We had the proseco which went well with the first few courses, subtle, complimented all of the food and its refreshing.\n\n\nThe next two courses were good and probably fantastic for my friends but really fell short for me because I'm vegetarian and the only difference on my plate was the absence of protein .. I was eating a well made sauce with maybe some tasty artichoke or arugula. Please vamp up your veggie options!!!! My last four courses were great: a charred avocado with a sweet sauce(??), bean radish and squash plate , Strawberry sorbet was tasty and the deconstructed cheese cake  and figs were stunning. We had a fantastic, you must try!, bottle of rose from Red Wood Valley (Mendocino) , unique, smooth, and refreshing.

I should have just ordered 3 jars of this and walked away happy. At this point, 4 stars. \n\nThen they brought out the lemongrass clam broth with maitake mushrooms, quail egg, and small crispy chicken thigh bits. It was good, if a bit on the salty side. The huge bowl only highlighted the tiny quantity of broth, and made the stuff harder to spoon up, as it only filled about 1/10th of the bottom. Still hungry, we waited for our halibut to arrive. \n\nAnd waited.\n \nAnd waited. \n\nOur waiter didn't check on us during this time, either to offer an explanation for the delay, or to suggest say, bread, or any other appetizer that might curb our appetites. A waitress from another section came by and refilled our water, but my date and I mostly sat there, staring at eachother's hungry faces (mine, burgeoning on homicidal by the end) and our empty table for 40 minutes. Meanwhile, the couple next to us received course after course, including the same entree that we ordered, in quick succession following their previous course. I still have no idea what caused the delay.\n\nAnd at long last, the waiter brought us our halibut, briskly said \"sorry for the delay, can I get you anything else?\" and hurried off. This would have been great 15 minutes ago, when I was debating whether or not to just flip over the table, run out the door, and go down the street to El Farolito instead. \n\nI wish I could say that the wait paid off. It did not. The halibut was the blandest piece of fish I've ever eaten. I've had unseasoned halibut sashimi with more flavor than this. Although the texture was smooth, that was about all it had going for it. No searing, no flavor, no salt. I detected a slight citrus note, perhaps from the olive oil it was prepared in. \n\nThis dish felt like paying for a trip to Jamaica and instead somehow winding up at the Holiday Inn in Kansas City - disappointing, boring, and wrought with that feeling of \"why has Jesus forsaken me?\" I didn't know an overpriced ($27), Post-it pad sized piece of flavorless fish on a bed of oversalted beans could ever fuel such rage in a person, but it did. \n\nAt this point, I was so hungry that I couldn't even send it back. I just ate the fish, frowned, and apologized to my guy for taking him here. \n\nThen I went home and ate a second dinner, because I wanted to eat something that didn't make me angry.\n\nLoved the first dish (4 stars), the broth was good, and the rest (service, value, entree), was 1 star = 1.5 to 2 stars overall.", "author": "Selina K."}

I am the biggest fan of flour and water, and have been talking about Central Kitchen for a year now.  I made reservations for my boyfriend and I to go to dinner for his birthday.  But the day before I chickened out after reading all the poor reviews on yelp, and went to Flour and Water for their tasting menu instead.  Sorry, enough about that onto Central Kitchen.  Hesitant to shell out $95 a person for a possibly bad meal, I decided that we should go for brunch instead.  That way we could keep our bill under the $100 investment for the both of us.  \n\nWe made reservations via open table.  We got there and was seated immediately.  The restaurant is a great environment for brunch with sunlight pouring in through the ceiling.  When seated we were offered a winter mimosa.  We decided to share one, and it was delightful.  I believe that it had pomegranate juice.  Divine!  We also shared a pot of french press coffee.  We were surprised that their house coffee was Mr. Espresso, we definitely expected Four Barrel, Blue Bottle or Sightglass.  I guess that is what happens when you live in San Francisco.  Coffee snobs unite!  \n\nMy boyfriend is pescatarian, and there weren't many options for him that were meatless.  He ordered a chickpea and poached egg casserole.   The flavors were amazing and it was really filling.  I ordered the eggs benedict with pork belly.  There was a delicious layer of spinach which really gave the eggs benedict a fresh veggie taste that can be needed when there is too much meat.  Don't get me wrong, I love meat but sometimes with the hollandaise sauce the brunch menu item can be too rich.  I would order that Eggs Benedict with just the spinach is was so flavorful.  \n\nMy only complaint is that the menu items don't come with toast or potatoes, so we had to order them separately as sides.  That being said, the toast was amazing, think The Mill on Divis amazing, and the potatoes were perfect.  \n\nIf this brunch is any indicator of how good dinner is, we will be coming back soon for the tasting menu.

My entr\u00e9e was seared bass with whipped potato, fennel, artichoke & olive tapenade. While this was a nice light dish the olive gave it most the flavor and I found it boring after the two first courses.  BF entr\u00e9e was a pork chop. The entr\u00e9e portions were of perfect size. Dessert was White Chocolate. Milk Chocolate. Dark Chocolate. It was decent- not an orgasmic dessert I've had other places. \nI found the space to be warm and ambient. It was a medium noise level and perfect for a nice date night. Ample parking within a few blocks walking.", "author": "Aly V."}

He didn't make eye contact with me until I informed him I had found a sharp piece of plastic in my  dish. The floor manager (a cute, young girl with a bob cut) must have been aware our waiter was a douche because she checked in with us a few times. Although she wasn't our server she explained the menu and gave us some great recommendations. I would have walked out it if weren't for her. Although the food was delicious (minus finding plastic) and the hostess and floor manager were great, that one waiter's negative energy really ruined the experience for me.

So, we moved to the barish seating, where you are higher up and can overlook everyone and sit a bit closer. The seats have backs on them at this bar area, which I really like. Also, then you can make friends with those sitting next to you. This I also really like! \n\nSkipped the tasting menu, since with two people, you can have a bottle of wine and enough food to fill you up and actually try more food for the same price. \n\nThings ordered:\n\nPinot Noir- lovely blend, I wish I could remember the name, and I can't pull it up to reference it. (It was in the 50 dollar range)\n\nfried padron peppers with lemon- these were very tasty, similar to the ones at Delfina. \n\nbeef tartare with fermented kohlrabi, smoked curds & plancha bread- this was delicious. I am basically a steak tartare connoisseur and have tried it at maaaany places here in San Francisco. This one won't disappoint. Not too salty, very well seasoned, with some zip. I loved it. And the portion is actually pretty big, 3 people could easily share this and maybe even 4 for a small taste each. \n\nseared rock cod with sourdough & garlic scape-clam broth. - meh. Pretty, good tomatoes. Seemed too fancy for the fish. \n\nhen with squash, green tomato relish, avocado & potato- Was it reallly the hen?? This was good. I was unsure if the avocado fit. Seemed like an odd texture in there. I was also pretty full around this time, so I didn't finish the entire thing. \n\nOther notes:\n\nSkipped dessert\nService was attentive without being overbearing. Really enjoyed our waiter, accent from North Carolina. \nChecked out the bar without having a drink (weird), looked fun and active and a good spot for a pre or post dinner cocktail. \nI thought the portions were a good size.", "author": "Danielle V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-11-29", "description": "First off - Emily who helped us throughout the night was nice....the reason for my 2 star rating has to do with their lack of professionalism, inadequate level of service, and poor attention to detail...starting from the beginning:\n\n1) We had a party of ten and for parties over eight, you need to book your reservation through their events coordinator. The process to do this was cumbersome and required many calls and not many timely responses.  My party had a few special requests (two with food allergies and one vegetarian) and the events coordinator never responded to my \"emails\" (yes, more than one). On the day of our reservation, I needed to call her to make sure she received my emails and confirm they could accommodate my requests.\n\n2)  At the restaurant, some of the tasting menus were from today but some were from the previous day (a different menu).\n\n3) As I mentioned, a couple of people in my party had food allergies -- one person is allergic to nuts and throughout the night the servers kept serving him dishes with nuts. It was almost comical as the chef came out and assured him it would not happen again....wrong....it happened again....this is unacceptable.\n\n4) Overall, service during the night was on the slower side.....I understand the courses are paced but it took about 30 minutes for our first tasting menu item to come out.\n\n5) When the bill came they mistakenly took $300 off the bill (there was confusion on their side if a deposit was left or not). I informed them I did not leave a deposit and they added $300 back onto the bill. I have no issues with the money but it just seemed they consistently lacked an attention to detail throughout the night.\n\nIn the end, I asked myself - would this happen at a restaurant like Gary Danko? Probably not - although you are basically paying the same price for an uninspiring experience. The tasting menu itself was ok (probably worth at least 3 stars) and desserts were really good. However, in this case the food could not mask their inadequate level of service, professionalism and attention to detail. If you are going to charge fine dining prices ---- please provide a fine dining experience. Thanks!", "author": "Joe M."}

There's this corner that has a bar, a restaurant and a salumeria all pretty much attached.  Dimly lit area, so if the area wasn't so hip, you'd feel like, where are these places?  At least Central Kitchen has a sign hanging.  \n\nThe space is simple.  Even barn like.  But the food (NOTE THE PORTION SIZE, be warned...if you're really hungry and on a budget, don't eat here) was truly awesome and even inspiring.  So that being said, we were definitely fan of the food and it seems they've worked out a lot of the service complaints in the other reviews.  \n\nWe were seated after only a brief short wait, as there were quite a few parties ahead of us. And when we weren't thrilled with the two top right in the front of the restaurant with lots of heavy traffic that even another couple turned down before us, they apologized and offered us to move when another table was getting up.  So A for effort, but we stayed and were totally amazed and food focused for the rest of the evening.  The manager and the waiter were notified immediately of our dislike and were really kind to acknowledge it.  That was good enough in my book.  So as a picky and often impatient New York, we just enjoyed and dropped the attitude.      \n\nThe bread and butter was honestly the perfect way to start out the meal.  The butter came at the desired room temp state with a warm caraway seeded roll.  Then we had the following: \n\n1st  Course: Beef tartare with celery root, fennel, sunflower & flax seeds (This portion was actually the biggest of them all for the evening).  Definitely the best rendition of a tartare I've ever had in my life.   Not the classic French prep though, so this made it all that much better. \n\n2nd Course: Mushrooms with parsnip, crackling & red hawk cheese.  The cheese was in foam form and the rest of the dish just worked.  We wanted to lick the plate.  For us, the dish embodied some of our favorite flavors and favorite foods.  Even an inside joke too.  Portion size was ok, not too much food, but as \"salad\" course I guess it was ok. \n\n3rd Course: Cod with roasted radishes, chard, black garlic & red wine.  Fish was cooked to perfection...great crispy skin and flesh was moist.  The red wine reduction was a welcomed highlight.  The portion of this dish was really small for the price.  \n\nWe opted to go without wine or drinks, but they have a decent wine list and a full bar too.  All in all, the wife and I were still happy to have eaten here and really enjoyed the service.  Definitely a great first dinner here in San Fran!", "author": "Caesar R."}

But I guess I'll give a little more info...\n\nWhen the two of us arrived, I was impressed with the atmosphere, decore, design, lighting, etc. of the restaurant. Our resos were at 9:30, we were sat around 9:45pm, I'll let that go, they were busy for a Thursday night.  Our server was very friendly, attentive and pleasant.  Sure she recommended ordering way too much food (which we ordered less than 3/4's of what she recommended and were still too full to eat everything), but oh well.  The tasting menu looked amazing, and we were hungry, but not out of control hungry.  So we opted to go a la carte.\n\nSo let me preface by saying that I'm a big fan of their other restaurant Flour + Water. Only been once, but had a great experience and the food was delicious.  Unfortunately the story for this place for me, was that the food here was incredibly bland. Everything we had was bland and not memorable at all. To the point that I don't remember what we even ordered.  Except for the Beef tartare with radish greens, smoked curds & green garlic, which was pretty good.  I know that sounds like a copout of trying to get out of including details in a review, but it's not. After each dish arrived, it was followed by being underwhelmed.  I can't even remember what we ordered. And my memory faded on this literally the day after we went there.\n\nWhen we walked in I immediately wanted to love it. Had heard good things too. But when we got up to leave, was extremely underwhelmed.  I hope they improve upon the food, because for the atmosphere alone, I'd be willing to give it another shot.\n\nAdditional Tip:  They only offer beer and wine. So no, you can't get a specialty cocktail with a floater of beer resting in a wine carafe with a shot of tequila on the side.  Sorry.\n\nAdditional Additional Tip: NEVER attempt to walk into Trick Dog after dinner, that is next door and has a back entrance that you can get to through a shared hallway that leads to a bathroom.  You HAVE to go in the front entrance to Trick Dog. Otherwise a smallish rude little server named Brian (not his real name), who I nicknamed \"The Guard,\" will step in front of you and block you from doing so, even if he has to sprint from across the room to block. You won't even be allowed to do this immediately upon spending $150+ on dinner for two and getting up from your seat.  I don't like \"The Guard.\" \n\nOk, good talk, that's all I have for now.

But never mind that, the food is good! The dishes show that the chef has amazing technique because each dish I tried was very well-executed.\n\nLiver mousse was very smooth without any gaminess and was topped with kumquat and thinly sliced picked radish that cut right through the fat.\n\nRaw Beausoleil oysters seemed a little overdressed at first (I usually take them with just a spritz of lemon), but they were fresh and left a nice long finish.\n\nLemongrass soup tasted kind of Asian-y, which I didn't like very much, but to someone who isn't biased (read: Asian), the flavors between the lemongrass, cilantro and oysters were balanced and overall good.\n\nSeared cod was so impeccably done, it almost seemed impossible! How is it that you can sear fish without compromising the fish's texture? It was like eating sashimi, but it was cooked. Pureed potatoes had the consistency of toothpaste and turned me off a little, but I didn't mind so much once they were in my mouth.\n\nDessert was orange & beet sherbert, and not worth mentioning, except for the fact that it wasn't too sweet and I like it like that.\n\nWine of choice was Bakerlane syrah from Sonoma. At first I was hesitant to pair a syrah against what I consider \"lighter\" fare, but the server's eyes lit up when I made my choice and told me not to worry. That's always comforting. To my surprise it went beautifully with everything, and it reminded me of laying on the grass and wearing flowers in my hair. And just like every summer fling, it came and went leaving good memories. No wonder they serve it by the bottle only, because that syrah's lifespan must be only 2 hours after opening.\n\nEnded the meal with their port wine--can't remember the name anymore.

Just remember to eat before you get here, or have reservations to eat at another restaurant afterwards because the portions here are elfin small.  Micro.  Petite.  Wee.  Minuscule.  Really, the portions are about a third undersized to be considered even small.  The main courses come out looking like appetizers or tapas.  The appetizer portions, well, get out your magnifying glass.\n\nYes, the roasted hen was delicious, as was my goil's halibut.  The service was efficient.  The wine list was good.  \n\nBut at this very pricy level, another three or four bites of the main course might have made it so my stomach didn't growl with hunger on the way out.  Wish there was a pizza place around the corner so I could grab a slice or two to round out my meal at Central Kitchen.\n\nAs for the space, it's kind of like eating in a live-work loft.  It's all trendy brick, glass, metal, and wood.  Hipster industrial chic.\n\nAnd the music was WAY TOO LOUD and ruined what should have been a nice, romantic evening because I could not hear my goil very well and had to ask her to repeat herself.  Really, Elton John blasted and booming over a meal for two that cost $180 just doesn't really make for a romantic evening out.\n\nGreat food, I'm willing to pay for it, there just needs to be more of it.", "author": "Paul S."}

We came on a weekday for a date night with my wife.  We arrived early for our 5:30 reservation since we had a show to catch later that night.  We were welcomed and informed that doors would open in a few so we strolled down to check out salumeria which was a very cute spot (probably great for some lunchtime sandwiches and snacks!).\n\nOnce we were seated, we were greeted by very friendly waitresses with a quick explanation of the menu (a la carte/tasting menu).  The ambiance is very relaxed and casual with tons of natural light.  We decided to go with the tasting menu since it was our first time and were quickly served the first few 'bites.'  They bites were a nice start highlighted by the fried rabbit rillette and the refreshing plum soda.  The courses came out the kitchen quite quickly as we were one of the first guests. \n\nThe middle of the tasting was solid but not spectacular.  A melon soup with speck, basil, and olives was refreshing and familiar.  Tomato with bread sauce and squash blossoms was also ok but the oven roasted tomatoes (or slow cooked?) were just too sweet and masked anything and everything.\n\nThe meal was highlighted by a perfectly cooked halibut accompanied by very tasty baby squids a la plancha served with a vinaigrette made from the leftover squid juices.  I think this dish showed some of the subtlety of flavor and refinement that I was hoping to see at CK.  This highlight was followed by a somewhat dull quail course with chanterells.  I felt that the dish was very one note in both taste and texture.  Everything was crispy and a bit dried out on the plate, as if some components had been sitting under a heat lamp on the pass for too long.  Although I always put more onus on taste, the presentation was also a bit sad in terms of color since everything was the same color on the plate.\n\nDessert was bit uninspired as well.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the friendly service and ambiance, although the street front is under quite a bit of construction right now.  The food was solid, but at $89 per person for the tasting, I wouldn't compare it favorably to places like Commonwealth or Sons & Daughters and hence the 3 star review.  I would definitely be open to returning to try some of the staples on the a la carte menu and give CK another try.", "author": "Chris T."}

My date notified the hostess that we would be back with the entire party. \nWell I think we probably returned in ~15min, and our table was not available immediately. Ugh I felt bad, because my date had said a number of times already how hungry he was. His last meal was late morning, since this was technically our first date, I didn't know him well enough to know if he gets grumpy when hungry... Unfortunately I am like that. But he was super chill. The guys ordered a bottle Pinot while we waited. And luckily we did not wait too long. \nWe sat in the front dining area. It felt like we were in an enclosed patio because the high ceiling had a skylight above us. The decor was bright and modern yet country-ish. Light wood dining tables and chairs. The ambiance seemed fresh and new, reminds me of places in SoCal. \nWell the moment we sat down my date says that we are ordering one of everything. It seemed like we did.  We all ordered an app and main entree each, but we shared everything, which I love! My date orderd another bottle of wine; this time a Bordeaux, which I thought was much better than the Pinot. \nSo I ordered the hamachi or yellow tail sashimi; doubt that's what the dish is called, but that's basically what it is, and it was delicious! I got to try the fried green tomatoes, a cheese platter, and fruit salad... All were pretty tasty. My main entree was octopus, but there was something else in it... Shredded beef or carnitas? I don't know because by this point I've had several cocktails.  Whatever was in it was yummy. I got to taste the pasta, salmon and hen dishes...

The restaurant itself looks like an artists loft with high ceilings and exposed wooden beams which I also really liked. \n\nWe'll start with the appetizer - we ordered the wagyu tar tar which is a good portion to split between two people. The wagyu tar tar was amazing and I could've made a meal just out of this appetizer. It tasted like Korean BBQ mixed with bruchetta. For our main course we split the porchetta which was not good. The porchetta was basically a hunk of pork meat with about a 60/40 meat to fat ratio. I appreciate that Central Kitchen has their own butchers onsite but this was literally a slab or pork meat on a plate so it wasn't visually pleasing either. I would skip this option. For dessert we ordered the chocolate custard which was amazing and ended our meal with a french press which was also good. \n\nOverall great environment, service and food for the most part. I wonder how this review would've looked had we not ordered the porchetta. I would definitely recommend people check this place out though. Enjoy", "author": "Ken C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-07", "description": "Searching for \"Hip restaurants in Mission, San Francisco\" returned an article by Oregonline and it puts Central Kitchen on my radar. Seeing the other hip restaurants all but booked with no tables until 9, it was a slim picking among the top 10 hip restaurants in the Mission. I have been to too many Mission restaurants and at this point I need something that is beyond good or acceptable. I want extraordinary. Flour + Water is excellent. Central Kitchen, in my opinion, different, good and in line with my more French leaning taste vs. Italian taste. They are sister restaurants, therefore, they serve \"water with gas\" aka sparkling water. Organic radishes with lard and sea salt, genius. It is what I'd eat in a Parisian cafe. Bread is amazing of course, chicken liver with kumquat jelly, inventive and totally hit (my) spot. Then there is the rabbit with vegetables and the sea bass with crispy skin, both are delicious. I had the cheese plate to share which was good but could use a hint of dry nuts. I had lots of sparkling water and a glass of red Spanish wine to wash down my chicken liver mouse in a jar. This dish reminds me of Le Comptoir du Relais, one my favorite Parisian restaurants in Saint-Michel. My go to restaurant whenever I'm in Paris, where I could sit outside after a summer storm hits the streets of Paris, light up a ciggi (yes that's what I'd do in Paris, they do allow cigarettes outside in the sidewalk tables but no longer inside - nasty habit I know) and enjoy my 3 PM first proper meal (discount the fact I've already had my morning cappuccino). CK is not meant to be Parisian or Italian, it's meant to be Californian new cuisine. But it's fabulous, as good as it gets really.  It's hard to go anywhere else in this part of the continent without comparing the ever growing list of fabulous Californian restaurants in San Francisco, it's also increasingly difficult for me to want to go anywhere else to eat but in the Mission. Alan Richman from GQ termed it as one of the most outstanding restaurants in 2013. That says something since I sort of worship Alan Richman. It deserves one Michelin star. From food to service. Would I be back? Yes! In fact, I was barely 3 blocks away yesterday on 23rd and Florida for an art exhibit and it's very close to Verdi cub. \n\nI'd have to bring folks of highfalutin taste here.

It is worth checking out, and with its solid dining experience, I'm sure you'll want to return again and again, as the menu changes with the seasons.\n\nAmbiance: A hidden gem (without a sign outside), Central Kitchen is like a friendly, neighborhood restaurant that you feel lucky to have found.  The Salumeria is so charming that you feel like you've been transported to Old World Italy.  The dining room is mostly wood and concrete imparting a simple, down-to-earth feel.  The tables were located beneath heat lamps which kept us  warm and cozy.  The noise level was consistent and a little lively with music.  We were able to carry on conversations with friends, even though the restaurant was full.\n\nService: The wait staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating.  I was even able to order an entree (lamb with nettles) off the tasting menu and get a good-sized portion.\n\nFood: While the selection is limited (4 entrees), the execution is near perfect. There are also plenty of appetizers to share and complement the entrees. This restaurant really lets the food's flavors shine through without over saucing.  They use fresh, organic, seasonal ingredients with a creative twist.  Favorite dishes included the lamb with nettles, duck confit croquette (off menu), beets, mushrooms, and apple confit, spice cake and vanilla ice cream. The wine list (by the glass) was well crafted, having international, very food friendly wines (slightly higher acidity and lower alcohol).\n\nOverall: The food is outstanding and the flavors really come through.The waitstaff are friendly without being disruptive.

They definitely need to do something about the volume and the selection of the music they play though (They played \"Tequila\" by The Champs at one point in the evening .... I was confused).\n\nSERVICE:  It's only been open for a short time, so they still have some kinks to work out with the timing, but our waitress was very cheerful and helpful.\n\nFOOD:  The menu and wine list are small.  Thomas McNaughton is either working out the menu or he changes it up on a regular basis because several of the dishes that were mentioned on yelp weren't there when we went last night.  The wine list could use a little more depth and a few more aged wines.\n \nMy boyfriend and I started off the evening by being served an asparagus panna cotta concoction that was overly salty and impossible to finish.  We were worried to say the least.  Then they brought us freshly churned butter and bread ... and continued to bring us as much as we could eat over the course of the evening.\n\nWe split the poached artichokes with white beans and salted true cod.  It was beautifully presented and perfectly cooked.  We were surprised that such heavy ingredients could be so light and simple.  \n\nFor our mains, I ordered the duck with barley and leeks and my boyfriend ordered the veal with cabbage, horseradish and mushrooms.  Both dishes were stellar. I have never had such delicious leeks or amazingly unsalty duck.  The veal was out of this world and the horseradish didn't overpower any of the ingredients.\n\nFor dessert we went with the honey chiboust and the chocolate financier.  The chiboust was, by far,  the superior dish.  It had that perfect combination of sweet, salty, and tartness.\n\nPRICE:  For two glasses of wine, a starter, two mains and two desserts the bill (before tip) came out to $140.  \n\nFINAL NOTE:  I think this place is going to get a lot of negative reviews because people are expecting big, bold flavors, enormous portion sizes and a lower price point  and Thomas McNaughton is providing understated, clean, perfectly cooked californian cuisine.

As my spouse says eggs make everything better. This was a very addictive dish with a green herbaceous sauce. It was mix of cooked and raw greens, deceptively simple yet very satisfying.\n\nThe next dish was the artichoke hearts and salt cod with white beans. Again the sauce which was a foam really brought the dish together even if I find foam unappealing looking. The creamy texture was contrasted by the salt in the fish and artichoke hearts.

The duck was cooked just right, the fat render and the meat tender but not over cooked. The portion of meat was small though even for western fine dining. It was served with lots of grains and greens which only highlighted the smaller portion of meat.\n\nAt the beginning of the meal we were served an amuse although it was larger than amuse usually is, a mix of a lime sorbet in a seltzer. \n\nFor dessert we got the chocolate financier with chocolate sorbet & a honey comb crisp which at 10 dollars was small, rather bland and not a financier in any sense of the ones we eat in France.\n\nThey gave us a small box of cookies with the cheque. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty causal with the wait staff in denim but the service was professional. \n\nI've never been that impressed by Flour + Water finding it not very different than many common Italian restaurants in Europe but Central Kitchen shows more of the chef's personal style mixed with his love of good ingredients.\n\nI'm planning on going back for the tasting menu.

The open kitchen,near which I was sitting, kind of reminds me of Cotogna.  The menu and aspirations seem reminiscent of Commonwealth.  By that I mean the food style seems to be small, complex plates, some of which work wonderfully.   I had the tasting menu, so with a glass of wine, tax, tip, and surcharge for healthy San Francisco the tab was over $100.  \n\nDinner began with a group of what amount to canapes:\nSmoked salmon with creme fraiche and dill. Nice\nCrispy pork trotter with fava bean. yum\nButtermilk granita with meyer lemon juice. Lovely\n\nFrom here the course size increased progressively:\nShellfish with turnips and bonemarrow vinaigrette. Yum\n\nVery al dente peas with fresh curd, walnut and rye crumble that brought the dish together.  Surprisingly good.\n\nOlive oil baked halibut, with artichokes, nettles and an egg yolk.  The small serving of halibut was so nice on its own that the egg yolk, while OK, seemed superfluous.  I would have preferred more of the fish, which was perfectly complemented by the nettles and artichoke, without the yolk (the chef probably knows best here).\n\nSpring lamb with white onion.  The lamb was very nice.  So much so that the portion seemed just the slightest bit undersized for the penultimate main course.  \nI finished my meal with the cheese plate rather than the sweets for dietary reasons.  The cheese plate was very well put together and I enjoyed it.\n\nDespite my quibbles about portion size, I left satisfied. \n\nSince this is yelp, one must say something to annoy or at least gain the attention of the restauranteur.  Here is my only suggestion:  I think they should provide a fork as well as a knife with the cheese plate to make it easier to manage.  \n\nBy the way, the service staff is friendly, helpful, and a great group.", "author": "David D."}

However, my sense from experiencing that, and now Central Kitchen, is that Central Kitchen is the restaurant that may possibly be the best representation of the personality that I have seen from him. There is something about Central Kitchen that is superbly meticulous, yet untamed and extroverted; possibly unscripted all together. I felt like I was at a buddy's house, after a later wilder night, and he just happens to be a master chef serving up fine dining, with a substantial wine list. No fuss. No tude.

The first asked us if we wanted still or bubbly water. The second followed shortly there after to ask us if we wanted still or bubbly water.  #3 inquired if we'd like a drink.

That said, the pour sizes seemed inconsistent and on the small side.   Also, just on the odd side, over the course of the night both of my dining companion's glasses of wine were delivered to the table already poured,  while for my glasses I was poured tasting sips at the table (as if ordering a bottle) followed by the regular pour.

Great selection of anti pasto to kick things off followed by an heirloom tomato salad with some sort of mild spicy pepper, which was not too hot.  They also served a seasonal melon dish with fresh burrata cheese...now this stole the show for me.  The cantaloupe and watermelon were super sweet and the cheese was nice and soft with the right amount of saltiness - it was a winner.  The third course was a pork agnolotti - think little ravioli pillows in a sauce of chile, corn and basil - most of the group raved about this dish.  The main course arrived with roasted fingerling tomatoes in a salsa verde, summer squash with an interesting sweet cheese sauce and shredded hen breast with some fresh apple wood sausage.  The hen breast was nice and crispy with a slight sweet n salty touch.  Chocolate custard was served for desert but by that time I had had my fill.  If you're into food creativity the by all means look up Central Kitchen.  I know that when I return to San Fran I will need to reserve a night for a second dining experience.", "author": "Jim M."}

We had a reservation-mix-up with your sister restaurant down the block, Flour + Water, and were unfortunately unable to eat there. (Side note: WTF, Flour + Water?! Your hostess is unnecessarily aggressive and unbelievably rude -- frankly, I can't believe that snotty B has a service industry job. What a sour puss!)  \n\nAnyway, we had a very enjoyable dinner here and would definitely comeback. Both the hostess and server were friendly and accommodating. I really liked the space and atmosphere of the restaurant. \n\nOur meal was delicious: we got the pedron peppers, chicken liver mousse and figs to start. For our entrees some of us had the corn angolotti, someone got the pork, another the squid. Everything was delicious -- the only somewhat negative remark was that the portion of squid was rather small and not entree sized.\n\nWe had a couple of bottles of wine -- all of which were terrific. \n\nSo why not 5 stars? Your (sorry, but I have to say it) lame dessert menu. It's so one note and pretty disappointing -- custard? sorbet? pudding? We would love it if you guys would add something like a cake, cookie, pie, crumble, brownie, bread pudding, etc. I'm not picky, just give me something warm and comforting.  Maybe next time...\n\nThanks again!", "author": "Anna S."}

The brunch is okay. It's nothing special and you can get a similar meal at just about any brunch spot in the city.  \n\nNow for the three blank stars:\n\nFor some reason on the two different visits several months apart from one another our reservations were not honored.   First visit they were 25 minutes late with seating us and we only had four people.  Today, they were 35 minutes late and only had a four top. Every time I approached to inquire about our table I got a different story.  No need to elaborate, I'm sure we've all been there.\n\nFirst visit it took about 20 minutes just to put in a drink order. Second visit we didn't get the last entr\u00e9e until it was room temp because it was passed over on the expo line.\n\nIn short, service is below subpar.

Though they aren't related in anyway I was hoping that it would match their strength behind the bar with their kitchen.  The food certainly did not disappoint. Naturally I tried a pasta dish because of their ties with Flour and Water which I adore. It was on point for sure.  We also had a very good blood sausage and octopus dish that was the star of the night for us as far as entrees went.  Simple yet delicious. If you're hesitant about blood sausage this dish would be a great starting point for you.  The best thing was by far the Kale Chips.  One of the best things I have ever eaten. We could have had 10 orders if we weren't eating everything else. The cheese plate was a small disappointment as I always hope for more unique cheese in restaurants but it wasn't anything I couldn't find at a nice market on my own.  The flat thin cracker it's served on was really nice though.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is very cool and easy on the eyes.  The service was a small disappointment as they weren't as outwardly excited as many of my favorite restaurants go.  One of the things I really like about eating out is when the service staff is as passionate about the food as the people who are making and eating it.  Places like Ramen Shop, State Bird, Canlis (Seattle), Flour & Water, Trick Dog excel at this kind of service and it shows.  The service here was pretty simple and basic. They weren't bad as far as timing and promptness but extra smiles, passion for food, and personality goes a long way for me.  I like being greeted when checking in and not having to grab their attention. Especially when the place was not very busy at the time we arrived. \n\nOverall if you want a good meal in a nice restaurant Central Kitchen does the job. Just don't expect much from the staff as far as personality goes.", "author": "Joco F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-03-03", "description": "I absolutely hate restaurants like this. Hate you say? That's such a strong word. Hate, I say. As in I was lining up to have a lovely Sunday until Central Kitchen got in the way. What, pray tell, did Central Kitchen do wrong, you say? Three things:\n\nFirst, the food is annoyingly precious. I had poached eggs over polenta with carrots, and some pork belly. It was Ok, I guess. Decent flavors but nothing earth shattering. I get that they are trying to do some new spins on old standbys. By which I mean they are trying really, really hard. Lighten up a bit. It's brunch. And it's San Francisco, not New York. \n\nSecond, the portions are tiny. My twee little breakfast melange had two pieces of pork belly so small they could have only been taken from a pig born within the past week. They were accompanied by two eggs, something like fifteen grains of polenta, three carrots, and two slices of mushroom.  (Not two mushrooms, two slices of mushroom.) I literally don't understand the theory behind this. Are you trying to get people to eat slow by serving them something that will be done in four bites? Do you think that good things only come in exceedingly small packages? Did you run out of bigger plates? Seriously. The ingredients are not that expensive. And it's really easy to fill up the plate with things like carrots and polenta that don't cost anything. Also they do the incredibly annoying thing of splitting off items that would normally come with a meal (like potatoes) and making them a side dish that you have to pay $5 for, and then even that portion is small. Potatoes. Cost. Nothing. Fill up the plate. Let my people eat! The bottom line is that I left the restaurant hungry after being there for 2 hours and dropping $33. That is not OK. Oh, also, they charge $5 for green tea. Lame.\n\nThird, the service sucked. It literally took like 45 minutes for us to get our food after ordering. And you could see that everyone else in the restaurant was having the same experience. Lots of people playing with their silverware, looking around, wondering why they didn't go somewhere good and fast for brunch.      \n \nThe ambience is really nice though. Also the poached eggs were properly poached, runny without being goopy. So, points for that :)", "author": "Daniel S."}

For the most part the food media seems to love you, diners in SF or the Bay Area seem to love you (or at least they are willing to wait hours at F+W or make reservations weeks in advance for CK), and food critics seem to love you.\n\nThe food was either stuck on one flavor or texture note or seemed to celebrate not the main ingredient but to be distracted by the attempt at clever side notes.  As one reviewer mentioned, the dishes were an interesting collection of ingredients, but as a whole not one brought a dish together.  The dishes were well executed technically, but were like well-executed rough drafts.  Like the sign on the way to the restroom, \"Excuse our mess, as we complete the construction of the buildings.\". (Or something close to that.)\n\nFor example, \"beets, raspberry, red walnut, cocoa nib.\" The raspberry would have provided a nice acid complement to the sweetness of the beets, a nice nod to summer and opening of the palate. Instead it overwhelmed.\n\n\"King salmon, eggplant, olive, mustard seed.\" The perfectly cooked, perfectly fresh salmon was high jacked by the smokiness of the grilled eggplant (both the pur\u00e9e underneath and the thick sliced garnishes). \n\nIf this is the direction you want the conversation of California cuisine to go, the voice is not loud enough, not daring enough, not original enough.  The cooking seems to be along for the ride, on the road to locally sourced and sustainably farmed. There is great competition on this road, and a foam here, gelee there, of a fresh local sustainable ingredient is not enough.\n\nI've been to F+W twice and CK once, to be fair.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-28", "description": "We were a group of 6 for a 9pm reservation on a friday for my friend's bday and we ended up waiting 40 minutes for our table... not a good start to the evening. The hostess seemed unsure of what to do when we continued to check-in for an update, she just kept saying, the table has their bill, we're just waiting for them to pay/get up. There's not a bar, so I guess that's a problem that they couldn't offer to buy them their last drink at the bar instead of hogging the table for 40 minutes longer.\n\nWe were all a bit annoyed by this point - the hostess had finally offered to get us drinks about 30 minutes into our wait, we were hoping they'd be comped, but they weren't. Once we were seated, the staff really turned the night around from there. We had several different people come up to the table to take our order, bring us food, etc, and each one acknowledged the long wait, apologized and said that they'd be bringing us some stuff free of charge to make up for it. In the end, it did, but I think their hostess needs a bit more training in how to handle these situations.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good. All of us are fairly adventurous eaters, having dined at SF's finest and I never turn my nose up at something that sounds odd. I tasted everything, even things that aren't really my cup of tea and overall, everything was good. A lot of the small plates, were good, but wouldn't have my craving anything enough to come back for more. We did get a big sample since they brought us some free dishes. We tried:\n-roasted beets\n-terrine/pate\n-radishes\n-mushrooms\n-fish tartar - I can't remember what kind this was, I did not try as I'm pregnant\n\nAll was very earthy, fresh and tasted good, but again, nothing that was to die for.\n\nI think we all really enjoyed our entrees though - 2 of us got the duck and the other 4 got the pork. I didn't love the accompaniments of the duck, but the duck itself was really good - I'm usually more of a confit person than a duck breast person, but this was delicious, and the biggest portion of duck I've had, 2 full pieces.\n\nThe other area we'd give them high notes on was the desserts. We were sort of debating what to get - first we knew they knew it was my friends bday so it's always the debate of if you order dessert or hope that they bring you something. We ended up ordering one of each of their 3 desserts. I only tried the chocolate one (very good) and the apple crisp one -- sooo good!! But between the 6 of us, we finished all 3.\n\nIn total, we each spent $75 inc tip and drinks for the meal, which I felt was pretty good. They didn't comp the first round of drinks that we had while waiting for the table which we were hoping for, but they did make up for the bad start with the extras throughout the night. Overall, a fun place to try, especially if you're open to tasting unique combinations as the menu isn't very large. We didn't really love any of the starters, but mains and dessert were really good.", "author": "Lauren M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-05-28", "description": "Central Kitchen clearly put a lot of effort into ambiance: the waiting area featured lighted water splashing over cracked porcelain and the \"outdoor\" seating area comprised a reconstituted barn with heated floors. Too bad the chef's drunk friends had taken over the communal table, save two tantalizing seats that were never offered to us during our two hour wait. In fact we were offered nothing during our wait - not updates, not refills from the bottle of prosecco we ordered, not bread. So we just sat on the edge of the fountain, like ducks on a porcelain bottomed pond watching the drunk friends of the chef stumble out to smoke, bumping into customers and muttering, \"What the fuck, man?\" to no one in particular. To be fair, I don't think any of the waiters were pleased about this. The hostess, on the other hand, probably didn't notice, busy as she was avoiding her hosting duties. (Also, she told us the wait would be at least two hours even though there was an available reservation on Open Table for an hour and forty-five. Even with the reservation, however, it took us more than two hours to be seated, so good on her for accuracy there.)\n\nI imagine, at this point, you may consider my review of the tasting menu biased. You are free to take my review with a grain of salt (this is a pun currently funny only to me and probably anyone else who ate at the restaurant on Friday 5/18). The pad of butter was practically the sole survivor of the salt shaker food massacre that was occurring in the kitchen. I exaggerate, but only slightly. The soup wouldn't have been considered too salty out of the context of the salt parade, and the halibut was a gem of a dish featuring a poached egg (salted) unlike one I've ever tasted. But mostly I just remember salt. The coda was a chicken dish straight out of the Alice Waters recipe rejects pile. I think I just fell asleep thinking about it. The wines were not to my taste, across the board. This could be good or bad, depending on your taste, but I am generally not a picky wine drinker. I just don't happen to like highly acidic wines, one of which was loving described to us as \"softer\" battery acid. I'd roll my dice with the wine list rather than opt for the pairing if I could do-over. The deserts were delicious, and the wait staff attentive, funny, and well-informed.\n\nSo I'm probably just bitter that I blew a ton of cash on a hit-and-miss meal while watching (and probably subsidizing!) some drunk jerks eating like kings and pissing everyone off. Great place to bring a date.", "author": "Erica B."}

I had heard many good things about the restaurant and made a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday. First note, that Central Kitchen requires a credit card to reserve a table through OpenTable. We arrived and were seated almost immediately. The decor was great and the restaurant was full of people enjoying a Saturday night out. However, the meal was downhill from there. The timing of the dishes was completely off, waiting over 20 minutes between courses after we were finished with our dish. Nothing stood out among the meal and the best of the four dishes we ordered was the hen entree. The trotters, tuna salad, and seared squid were all underwhelming. For a place with such hype, an expensive menu, and an out-of-the-way location, I can surely say I won't be coming back.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

I'll definitely go back, maybe in a year to see how it's changed. \n\nAMBIANCE + SERVICE: We had a 8:45 reservation for four, and were seated immediately. The space is really beautiful -- lots of beautiful, warm, indirect lighting, modern style, with a few industrial touches. The table and chairs were hefty but comfortable. The plates are pottery. The service was also excellent, with only a few delays here and there. \n\nFOOD: We tried the tasting menu. Overall, a good choice. \n\n- The canapes were interesting. The only one worth remarking on was the first one, which was a sort of citrus/champagne mix with almond milk and some sort of granita. It was really, really, really delicious. The others ranged from good to weird. \n- The clams and turnips were good, but not great. One person at our table remarked that they tasted like a McDonalds hamburger. Which they did, in an odd way. \n- The peas and curds with mint and rye crumble was awesome. Such an inventive way to serve that combo of food. It was like a delicious hearty soup or something. Wonderful. \n- Slow-baked halibut with egg yolk. The egg yolk was almost sous vide, it was really good. And the halibut was wonderful -- perfectly cooked. And my anti-fish boyfriend got a slow-cooked ham instead, which was nice. \n- Roasted veal, porcinis, and pine: This was good, though not amazing. The porcinis were the most flavorful thing on the plate, and were delicately cooked. My veal was a bit overdone. \n- The yogurt sorbet/blackberries/almonds was really delicious. The perfect sort of substantial palate-cleansing dessert after a somewhat heavy main dish. \n- The cherry/buckwheat ice cream was fine. Nothing special. The buckwheat pellets seemed almost like pet food -- a bit of an odd consistency. \n\nWINE: The wine list is much-improved over older versions (I can tell), but the restaurant lacks a liquor license. I asked for a cocktail menu with dessert and was turned down, which lost the restaurant a star. Our waiter recommended an excellent provencal-style rose, which went well with both the halibut and veal (not an easy task). \n\nPRICE: In the high range in terms of price-to-value. Portions were not huge, but were sufficient. I think it's a little annoying to be charged a $1.95 Healthy San Francisco fee after paying $79 for a tasting menu. But overall, a great experience.

Finally , although they didn't have any dairy free desserts, they created the most delightful bowl of ginger sorbet topped with lavender sea salt on a bed of cherries, strawberries and blackberries.  They even sprinkled it with nasturtiums! It was the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  Thank you Central Kitchen for such a lovely thoughtful and personalized dinner.", "author": "Tess H."}

The presentation, service and of course most importantly the taste of the meal we had last night at Central Kitchen were all superb. I've been here three times and each time gets better and better. Our groups server was Gino, and he did an amazing job of explaining all the food and wine options/nuances. \n\nHighlights of the meal: Superb wine selection, from Napa/Sonoma to Eclectic European choices. The hot appetizers were all delicious, as well as the entrees. I had the Pork Belly and Game Hen Dish, superb. We shared some desserts which were all top notch.", "author": "Albert C."}

I was already decided in my mind that is what going to be a fantastic experience, and it seemed impossible for anything to deter that (I was in a great mood, had a great companion, and basically was in the mood to fall in love with the place). \n\nForget the fact that the food menu was really short and limited, had no GF or other healthy alternatives, and that they served you such little portions of everything, you felt like you needed to go somewhere else to eat afterwards. None of that bugged me since I was just in the mood to enjoy.\n\nWhat finally intruded on our joy, was the TERRIBLE SERVICE--OH MY GOD!!! That's the last thing I would have expected from this place. A nice young man with a beard & red plaid shirt served us and seemed like such a cool dude....until he started completely ignoring our table for 15-20 minute chunks (which he later described as 2 minutes waiting periods). My friend and i were happily engrossed in conversation and willing to roll with the long waiting periods...until our server pushed it beyond the breaking point for every single thing we needed. We basically had to get up out of our chairs and hail him down any time we needed something. It was such a bummer, because it totally ruined the vibe and my friend and I had no interest in being those kinds of annoying customers--we just wanted to relax and enjoy.\n\nWhen it started to get to a ridiculous point, we politely mentioned something to our server   (ie.,  he didn't even check on us after there was a huge mistake with our order and the kitchen needed to send out another salad they forgot--again, it took 20 minutes and we had to get up and physically find our server to check on the already forgotten entree). Here's the WORST PART, after mentioning something, our friendly server proceeded to be totally defensive and tell us why he is not taking a long time. We decided to just drop it, recognizing he is the type of guy who doesn't take responsibility and likes to deflect. To make matters even WORSE, the manager got wind of our mild complaint, and then she came over to defend, justify and give excuses as to why things were going fine and we were not being ignored.  This part was actually embarrassing as we felt totally on the spot and called out in front of other customers.\n\nIn sum, these people are totally clue-less and have a warped sense of customer service. Each server is free to get lost in other activities and completely ignore there tables to their hearts' content.\n\nI don't recommend this place....and after all that, the food was just whatever....we ended up going to Plow afterwards since we were still hungry after 2 items each (Now Plow is an incredible brunch spot!!)", "author": "Avery S."}

I think people are comparing CK to Flour + Water which it is not.  The chef is trying to make CK his signature restaurant and you can tell that by the quality and presentation of his food here.  I even opened up this yelp account, so that I could comment on this place to address other people's comments.  I am pretty confident, the owners will make the changes to address people's concerns and probably already have.  That's probably why I had such a great experience.\n\nWhile this is more expensive than the \"neighborhood\" restaurant, the quality of the meal is what you're paying for and that's fine with me.  \n\nPeople complain about the size of the portions but I was completely satisfied after the typical appetizer, meal and dessert (which was deee-licious).  We even ordered another dessert since it was go great and I felt stuffed after.\n\nI can't speak to the wine, since I'm not a wine drinker.\n\nOverall, this was a great meal and I'd highly recommend it.

We ordered almost everything on the menu and nothing was that great. It was obvious a lot of skill went into creating each dish, and they certainly looked very pretty, but we all felt like the end result didn't taste any better than things we could make at home. \n\nAlso, we came prepared for the small portions and we don't eat very much, but all of us were surprised by how completely unsatisfied we were. We assumed we'd end up mostly satisfied but nowhere near stuffed, which is fine; I prefer not to feel like I could roll myself out of the restaurant. But we left and realized we were still hungry. We ended up stopping into another restaurant and eating a full meal! (Note: I suppose we could've asked for more bread in order to fill ourselves up, but I don't like doing that. Besides, no one offered to bring us more, despite the fact that there was no food on our table for long stretches of time.)\n\nOn the other hand, the service was great. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The hostess, our server and a few other people who brought us our food or stopped by to check up on us, were all super nice and did a great job. Such a great job that I really wish I had better things to say about the food.\n\nAs we were enjoying our second (proper) meal, we all discussed Central Kitchen and the consensus was that, based on the meal we just had alone, we wouldn't return. And we all had a general feeling of dissatisfaction about how much we spent, considering that we ended up eating somewhere else 30 minutes after we left.", "author": "K B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-13", "description": "Yet another new place in the Mission... I was kind of scared by the extremely mixed reviews, but I ended up LOVING it.   \n\nParking isn't so difficult in this part of the Mission.  The space is low key and easy to miss, but don't be fooled - the inside is super cute, with a patio option and an inside option with a direct view of the open kitchen.  It's not too tiny but still feels intimate, and the colors and decor are simple but sophisticated.  All the staff knows the menu well, and everyone was super friendly and took the time to chat with us without appearing flustered or rushed. I didn't find it \"too trendy\" at all.\n\nFirst off, I have a bias towards any place with complimentary house sparkling water, especially if a bottle is left for you on the table.  The wine list isn't huge but has a good variety, and I thought the Prosecco went well with the mostly seafood based tasting menu for tonight.\n\nWarm rolls are served with house butter with just a little sea salt.  We started with 3 canapes: \n1. Melon with lardo and pine nuts\n2. Corn broth with pine nut oil - usually corn is creamy, but they squeezed out the fresh juice from corn on a cob and made it into a consomme\n3. Plum and blueberry soda with tarragon tea - sparkling, refreshing, fruity\n\nThen onto the tasting menu...\n1. Salmon belly with cucumber gelee - refreshing and light, good way to open\n2. Salt cod with summer peppers - loved the fried, battered, warm salt cod.  The summer peppers, nepitella seeds, and amaranth brightened the flavors and colors, but I wasn't as big a fan of the chilled tomato soup poured over it.\n3. BEST HALIBUT EVER - perfectly crusted top with a subtle oyster vinaigrette, amazing greens underneath that was an emulsion of blended coriander and onion, not too rich.  Each bite made me sad because I knew there was less and less left.\n4. Roasted quail - tender, flavoful, with richness cut by blackberries, and sous vide corn so fresh you could smell it.\n5. Peach and lovage sorbet - lovage is reminiscent of celery, and the accompanying non-traditional cannoli reminds me of a Chinese sweet egg roll with a lighter cream inside.\n6. Fromage blanc - steamed cheesecake with fresh figs - a nice variation on a normally heavier dessert.\n\nLast, we ended with a complimentary beignet with chocolate sauce.  I know lots of people complain about portions, but for me, with the variety and pacing and extra dishes, the meal was well timed and well portioned.  The tasting menu had a good progression from lighter bites to a richer quail, with desserts that weren't too rich.  I thought it featured local, seasonal items well without being too overpowering with sauces.\n\nAt $125 (split the bottle of prosecco with a friend, tasting menu, 4% healthy SF tax, tip), I thought it was a very reasonable price for an exceptional dining experience.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

Went in for brunch and all of our brunch courses arrived cold.

Third, the check was dropped off before we were asked if we wanted anything else - again, strangely - dropped off in the center of the table, not discretely off to the side like most restaurants are prone to do. Fourth - the damn hipster music that they insist on blaring on full volume is really a bit obnoxious. It's pretty clear that the music was for the staff, and without any regard for the comfort level of the clientele.

Parking wasn't hard (San Francisco standards) and it's easy getting here if you don't live in SF.  Second, for those that care about service (not everyone does), this place rates high.  Everyone was very friendly, they brought out dishes fast, and the staff knew what every dish tasted like.  This last part is key.  (Come on... you know you don't like going to places where the waiter is a vegetarian and hasn't tasted anything on the meat side of the menu.)  Nothing against vegetarians, but I want my wait staff to describe what it tastes like.  By the way, if I go to Greens, I want my wait staff to be a vegetarian. \n\nNow lets talk about the most important part, the food.  Overall, the food was very good.  Together we got the rutabaga bites.  Very yummy.  I couldn't stop easting them.  They were fried crispy on the outside and inside was a soft rutabaga cloud.  Yum!  My wife, as usual, got two appetizers... the Hen Confit and Yellow-tail Crudo.  She loved both.  The Hen Confit was crispy outside and perfectly done chicken meat on the inside - tender and moist.  The Yellow-tail was one of the best dishes here. The slices of fish were slightly thicker than you would find at a sushi restaurant and the quality was very high.  I also really liked the citrus (I thought it was tangerine, but my wife says it was grapefruit) scattered around the plate.  Lastly, the roasted pork was my only disappointment.  The flavors were perfect, the skin was really nice, but the meat was much too tough.  However, the bright spot was that the vegetables and sauces on the plate complemented the meat perfectly.  It was really tasty.  But again, it seems like everything was lined up except the texture.  Bummer.  This is one place that I hope to come back to find that the dish has improved and I hope they knock my socks off.  \n\nOh... I almost forgot... the most important part... the wine. (feel free to call me a wino)   This place is a find!  They have a lot of a great wines on their list, and most of them are below $50. (You gotta love it)  We ended up getting an awesome Greek red wine from Saint George.  $30ish for a bottle.  Great wine for the price! \n\nLooking forward to going back to try something good...

We shared the saffron spaghetti, just average. Entrees were a big letdown and they were pricy. The pork dish was soooo fatty, like only a few bites of pork and 75% inedible. I'm not exaggerating and I'm not a person that needs extremely lean meats. The other pasta dish on the menu with clams was bizarre. It had decent flavor but texture was terrible and it looked like soggy tortilla chips. Blah. Dessert looked good but we didn't want to try any by this point.

Very cool restaurant design-wise.  Servers were attentive and friendly although they did bring one course (pea and goat milk curd salad) to our table before the \"walnut foam\" was ready, which eventually arrived and was more like cream than a foam.  Fortunately I had already eaten half of it, because it was much better without the foam/cream.  \n\nWe had the tasting menu.  The food was plated very nicely and sounded very creative/adventurous.  Clearly some risks being taken.  Reminded me a lot of Saison aspirationally, but the dishes don't come together nearly as well (or in some cases, at all).\n\nAs some of the people below note, the issue was flavor.  The dishes just weren't seasoned and balanced very well.  We had a salmon belly with a vegetable jelly and bright green sauce that completely overwhelmed the dish (think wheatgrass, though not that strong). The fish (halibut) was a bit overcooked and no acid at all on the dish, so it was pretty bland.  Had the lamb with porcinis and porcini puree: the lamb chops were good, the roasted porcinis very good, but again the dish just didn't really come together.\n\nOn the upside, desert was pretty good.  In particular, had a buckwheat ice cream which was far and away my favorite taste of the night.  \n\nCurrent plan is not to go back, but the place was cool enough that I'll check the reviews here in 3 months or so and give it another shot if they seem to improve.", "author": "r h."}

There were 5 of us and we opted to do the Tasting Menu, which was fantastic!\n\nWe were seated right away (we had an 8:30 ressie) and the place didn't really seem crowded.  The big communal table was near us and there were only 2 people at the very end for most of our nearly 3 hour dinner experience.\n\nThe ambience was cool, although a few people in my party thought it was a little chilly due to the inside/outside aspect of the restaurant. \n\nWe decided not to do the wine pairings with the Tasting Menu and just choose wine on our own, especially since 2 of us had to drive after dinner.  The Tasting menu was fantastic.  I'm fairly picky and there was nothing they served that I didn't truly enjoy.  With that said, I will agree with other reviewers that the portions are slightly smaller than one might expect -- but that's not necessarily a bad thing!  It was nice to leave a multi-course dinner and not feel stuffed!\n\nThey also have plenty of hot, gourmet bread that they will keep bringing until you cut them off (yes, I judge restaurants on their bread once in a while) so if you're worried about being hungry just eat more of that!\n\nOverall I thought it was the perfect dinner experience -- it was trendy, a new place I wanted to try and fantastic food.

The hostess asked about water preference so wasn't sure if she was the hostess or our server.  Another person took our drink order.  Then the hostess came back with the wine bottle we selected and presented my husband to try the selection when I was the one who ordered it.  That should have foreshadowed our service for the remainder of the meal. Unless prompted, we had no direction from our server about what her recommendations were, etc.  \n\nFood was delicious and we were pleased with everything we ordered, but felt like I could have gone to the counter and ordered our meal because there was no service for the prices we were paying.  When you charge $30 for what is actually your 4th course - there is a level of service expected with that price.  We filled all of our wine ourselves and when we finished the bottle, when the server finally came around she picked up the bottle to pour and it was empty, made a comment \"it makes me sad when a bottle is empty\" which I think was meant to be a joke, but then she cleared the glasses, took the bottle and never came back.  A missed opportunity to offer another glass to order.  It took about 10 minutes to clear our plates, we had to ask for dessert menu and then they gave us the same menu with no dessert listed.  Didn't bother to ask because they literally gave us the menus and walked off.  We waited another 10 mins to just tell the waiter we wanted our bill.  It was just bad service.  Our waiter walked by our table twice when we were sitting there with empty plates, no drinks, nothing.

Ask your waiter what they've kept in the menu the longest and you can't go wrong.

The door is on 20th and there's no sign, just the menu on the door.  That was fine by us, even after walking by twice.  But once you walk inside, you're suddenly transported to an oasis.  The first section is an open air seating, I'm thinking this is the open seating as well.  One communal table and about 5-6 smaller tables.  On the other side of the glass wall is the inside tables with a small bar (about 6 stools) and an open kitchen.  \nThe menu:  Good selection of items.  We ordered almost one of everything.  The asparagus two ways and the goat cheese curds and whey were SO yummy.  I wish I could have swam around in the bowl of whey (who knew it was so good?).  For mains we did order one of everything.  The salmon was a bit undercooked for my friends (although their plates were cleaned so...), the lamb was amazing (an attack on your senses, with a little curry-esk sauce on the veggies and lamb itself), and the duck was perfection.  Dessert, again we ordered one of everything.  Yep, again, very well done.  Each dish had something unique to it that made you go hummmm.....but in a good way.\nStaff:  AWESOME.  They were very friendly, answered any questions you had, attentive but overly so.   \nPrice: All the food plus 4 glasses of wine, coffees and corkage for the bottle we brought =  $62 per person (table of 5, not including tip) \nThe only negative was that when I called for a reservation they offered me a 6pm on Tuesday.  I called back 30 minutes later to be told that was taken and could only seat us at 5:45.  A bit early but figured we should grab it, knowing how hard Flour & Water is to get into.  It might be because it was a Tuesday and a bit cold, but the dinning room had a table for 5 open the whole time we were there (the other tables for 2 and 4 plus the bar were busy), and the outside area was pretty open as well.

We really love the decor and vibe of the place; clean lines, yet warmth. The food was really interesting and tasty. It's artistic with flavor combinations you have to imagine and when the food finally comes it's fabulous.  We especially loved the crispy kale with mushroom and preserved lemon aioli. The crunch with the vege with the aioli was yummy and nothing greasy or too breaded.  Sunchoke salad with pear, prune, coffee & curds was a medley of flavors you'd never expect with great texture.  Highlight of the night was the crab with brussel leaves. It had super crunch and flavor, the portion was ample. Great for anyone loving their greens!  Disappointment for the evening was the swordfish with mussels, potato and fennel. It was a little mushy/soft - marshmallowy. Flavors were good but the texture was really off especially if you like your swordfish more 'steak like' - it's a meaty fish but it tasted uber poached.  The pork dish was terrific; tenderloin is never my thing because it's always a little lean and tough but there's was ok and the sausage on the plate terrific.  All in all we'd try it again. I don't know if I\"d make it my neighborhood hangout - it's not the type of place you go to over and over again but it's definitely worth a visit or two or three.

As other reviewers have noted, the portions are tiny.  The space is lovely, woodsy, and airy- it almost feels like you're somewhere up Napa or Sonoma and not in the Mission.  And the staff was really nice and attentive.  But the food?  BLEEECCHHHH!!! It's hard to screw up morel mushrooms, but somehow they managed to do so. They were spongy and mixed up in some quinoa-based hippie gruel that tasted like something I could have picked up at Rainbow for six dollars.  Grilled lettuce?  Not so much.  Really, the only thing that was good was the dessert (lemon cake with berries and yogurt mousse), and that was just OK.  On the basis of the food alone, I'd give it one star but for the ambiance I'll bump it to two...reluctantly.  Stick to flour + water.", "author": "Vose S."}

The food was tasty, and abundant (rare for tasting menus). So why the three stars?  Service.  Some servers were experienced and able to give us lots of information about what we were eating, others seemed to know very little (e.g., \"this is halibut and mussels.\" What is this red sauce? \"I don't know, let me find out.\" This would happen when there were more than 5 components to the dish, and they would tell us just one or two items. Ditto on the wine pairing, they'd basically just read the label.) Also, the service slowed WAY down in the second half of the meal, so much so, that I just wanted to leave. Like 20+ minutes between courses.  That added up to a 3+ hour meal, where even though the food was quite tasty, I left feeling annoyed, rather than delighted.  Which is a shame. McNaughton's \"flour+water\" restaurant has exceptionally knowedgeable and speedy service, so we were really surprised. So, I'd say, go for the food, and don't be in a rush, and hope to get a server who is experienced.", "author": "H A."}

When I complained, the server acknowledged they hadn't been doing well with their music, but they didn't change it.  It created an ambiance more consistent with a college sports bar than a high end mission restaurant.  What I found most bizarre is that our server--who was I think more or less in agreement with our opinion about the music-- said that they didn't think of the restaurant as a \"fine dining\" establishment.  The implication was that they were trying to make it less stuffy with a rock and roll sound track.  IMO, they are underselling themselves.  The food was very good, but they blew it with the music.  Sorry guys, you can't have it both ways...either serve $16 entrees comprising a few beets scattered on a plate (very good) or try to be down to earth, but don't try to do both.", "author": "Tuhin R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-25", "description": "the food quality is on par with any top rated restaurants in the city. our waitresses were very nice and warm. however, they are charging fine dining service prices ($89 tasting + $50 wine pairing) but did not deliver (not even close). food is solid 4 stars and service is a weak 3 stars. i would come back again for the food but not for the service.", "author": "Nikko Q."}
