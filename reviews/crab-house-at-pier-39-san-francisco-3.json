We got seated next to window so we had a nice view of pier. It was great but nothing really wowed me. Crab chowder was creamy and delicious but pretty standard.

It was really busy, but there were tables available and the service is pretty fast. Pretty crowded but they managed to find us a table for a  party of 10. The menu is pretty standard but the prices are expensive. It was probably worth it, and there are few items that are a must try like the cioppino, fish and garlic fries, calamari and the fresh-cooked crab.\nThe bread wasn't really appealing- it was chewy and not freshly baked. So that means they get their sourdough bread at Boudin or another well-known sourdough bread baker.\nWe ordered 2 of each: Two too crab, calamari, 3 garlic noodles, 9 sodas, 1 large cioppino. Of course, they are refills.\nThe crabs are sweet, fresh and the garlic sauce - OMG! So good. I highly recommend the cioppino, fish, and chips (garlic fries). So whatever is expensive and worth trying are the seafood dishes like crabs, mussels, seafood, shellfish, shrimp - they are so fresh, sweet and the tomato broth and garlic sauce - they are so yummy! I got the fish and chips - 2 halibut fish breaded with a light spiced cornstarch tempura batter with garlic fries on the side, lemon wedges, a small side of tartar sauce and their housemade cocktail sauce. The cocktail sauce is the worst housemade recipe I tasted. But I am also on a budget - I would splurge a little like for 2 people you can share the combo entree meals - fish and chips for $20. This is probably perfect for 2 people. \nBut this meal was really expensive for 10 people. A lot of tourists and locals eat here for indulging a phenomenal meal. If you have the money to splurge, after spending your day at Fisherman's Wharf or Pier 39. This is where to eat.\nIn the late afternoon, the wait is usually 30 to 40 minutes. \nIf you want to eat great food at the Fisherman's Wharf - there are only a few places that are worth eating during lunch or dinner time. The Crab House, and the Wipeout is pretty good for brunch, lunch or dinner. A great day to end the day playing Pokemon Go on a Sunday afternoon.", "author": "Jade M."}

My boyfriend and I live in Arizona so the fresh crab options are extremely limited/ non-existent. We were really craving a crab feast so we hopped on Yelp and happened upon this wonderful establishment. We called last minute to make reservations. The hostess politely informed that they request reservations be made 3 hours in advance and invited us to walk-in and be put on a short wait. It only took about 20 mins for us to be seated after we put our names on the list. It didn't seem like a bad deal considering how busy the restaurant was! \n\nThey have quite the array of options including soups, salads, cioppino, mussels, shrimp, fish and chips, and even some chicken and chips for the kids. Everything sounded so wonderful but we came for a crab feast and by golly we were going to have a crab feast! \n\nWe were having a hard time choosing between the Lotsa Crab (3lbs) and the Too Two Crab (4lbs). Our decision was made final after the server informed us that the Lotsa Crab was 1 1/2 crabs and the Too Two Crab was 2 whole crab. If this was going to be our only crab feast this year, we were going to throw caution to the wind and tackle a whole crab a piece.\n\nOur crab arrived promptly after we ordered it. Two whole crabs still sizzling on the skillet. I'll be honest with you, I was terrified trying to figure out how to begin tearing apart this monster. After inquiring with the server about where to start, he kindly offered to cut them for us. It was a great addition to already impeccable service. \n\nWe were offered 3 sauces alongside our crab; a traditional butter sauce, a \"secret sauce\", and a lemon caper sauce. They were all divine and complimented the crab beautifully. \n\nAll in all it was a great experience. The wait wasn't too bad. There's a souvenir shop across from the restaurant that you can stroll around in while you wait for your table. Once you sit down the service is extremely prompt and friendly. The presentation of the food is impeccable and the views are to die for! We will no doubt be back next time we are in San Francisco!", "author": "Aisha L."}

We then ordered another order of crab meant to share for 2. They do not give you the head on these orders which some people look forward to. \n\nOne thing I wanted to mention is the quality of crab from the largest order to the smallest order. The crab tasted fresher in the smaller order compared to the larger order. The meat was more moist and the crab legs were also bigger and meatier. \n\nThe garlic noodles are ok. Not what I'm used to.

The food was awesome. I had the full crab and double shrimp on a hot top. My dish came with two dipping sauces, one extra buttery and the other citrusy. \n\nPricing wasn't too bad. On my own, I spent a little over $50. Overall, the food was great but the service wasn't 5 stars worth.

It's definitely one of my favorite crab places! \nService: Service is usually amazing. They have a number of people waiting on your table which always makes you feel like you are being attended to. This last time I visited the crab house the waiter we had was a little on the rude side. My boyfriend had a number of questions about how a few of the dinner plates were prepared, and our waiter was clearly annoyed by the questions. The waiter was basically saying without saying hurry up and order. I was shocked! He must have had a bad day because this is defiantly not a norm for this place. Staff is usually helpful and friendly.\nFood: AMAZING!!!!!! Food is cooked to perfection! I usually order a whole crab, and I have never been disappointed. Crab comes with this amazing butter that has garlic and capers in it! Only thing I would change food wise is the bread they give you as a starter. It's so hard that you can barley tear it apart. I prefer soft, hot bread. \nAtmosphere: Atmosphere is amazing! There are a number of windows with amazing views of the bay! Defiantly a great date spot! Restaurant is clean and well kept. I love the fire place in the middle of the restutant.

We waited 30 minutes to be seated but it turned out to be worth it.\n\nI ordered a Hot To Trout cocktail (Bourbon) and it was pretty good.

The only small negatives for me would be:\n\n1) there was a tad too many onions in the crab melt and it was a little overpowering. \n2) the garlic fries came with clumps of garlic cloves and weren't evenly spread out through the fries so some fries were VERY strong on garlic and others tasted like regular fries.\n\nBe prepared to squeeze your way through the tight aisles and bump (or get bumped into) chairs behind you when you get seated.

My husband and I came here because it was suggested by a local. Well this wasn't our favorite place to dine while visiting. \n\nWe started our lunch with a side salad and their bread bowl of Clam Chowder. The salad was ok. Nothing special. The tomatoes seemed like stewed tomatoes instead of fresh. It was different but I care for fresh tomatoes instead. It was romaine lettuce, onions, tomatoes, cheese, and dressing. The dressing wasn't that good or didn't taste homemade. It tasted like standard bottled dressing. My husband's soup was ok to me but he felt it tasted more like a vegetable soup or stew. It had a lot of vegetables in it. He felt like the Fog House's Chowder was better. In my opinion I liked Crab House Chowder better. I will say the Fog House chowder is more like a real Chowder. \n\nI ordered the Crab Angel Hair Lasagna and my husband ordered the Crab Alfredo for our main meals. I love angel hair pasta so this was fitting for me. The sauce that was served with the dish was salty and super buttery. Besides the Salt it was ok. The actual lasagna itself wasn't bad. It could have used a tad more seasoning but it was ok. My husband thought his Alfredo was pretty good. I will say the Alfredo sauce was actually decent and his noodles were cooked well. Both of our dishes were good but nothing spectacular.\n\nOverall, the Crab House wasn't horrible but there are certainly other places to get better food.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Located on the 2nd level of Pier 29, I recall there was a pretty long wait (everywhere in SF had a wait) so we did what we always do to kill time - have more drinks at the bar. In my drunken state, I remember thinking to myself it was one of the best meals I've ever had. My friends all agreed which I felt validated my intoxicated opinion, no? Anyway since then I've been itching to come back to see if sober me feels the same. \n\nFew years later, I finally came back to take my little cousin out for her birthday. Sober verdict? Just as I remembered; very few things fell short of perfection. We came on a Monday afternoon and still had to wait 45 minutes! Since my cousin is only 15 and we couldn't just go have a drink at the bar, I tried to find some family-friendly things to do nearby and luckily we walked right into Mirror Maze which was such a fun way to kill time. \n\nThis time we got the: \n\nWhole Crab + Double shrimp - Served on a sizzling skillet, roasted with their garlic sauce. Just like how I remembered it! Ahhmazing! Make sure you dip the bread in the sauce on the skillet. It comes with a garlic butter sauce and a herb butter sauce but I prefer the sauce on the skillet. \n\nSeafood Cioppino - Didn't care for this dish; not a tomato broth person but my cousin said she really liked it.\n\nGarlic noodles with added crab - You MUST get this dish - I repeat - you MUST get it this dish. It's the key dish that gives the meal that perfect carb-to-crab balance. Definitely on my top 5 list of favorite garlic noodles and, like I've mentioned before, I'm a garlic noodles CONNOISSEUR! \n\nTiramisu - I'm not a dessert person by any means, unless it's ice cream, but this was so addicting. We demolished it. \n\nThe only downside is that they clean out the crab guts before hand so even if you order the whole crab you can't get the guts :( My favorite part of the crab!!!", "author": "VixCyn P."}

Waitstaff should be told before they start their shift but obviously this doesn't happen as a sign the restaurant doesn't care. After determining they were from Canada (which means they don't even care to use local product) I overlooked that fact because I was told they would be of a good medium size. Clearly she didn't know what she was talking about because when they were served they were so small (the size of a finger tip and smaller) and when I called her out on it she basically ignored me for the rest of my meal!\n\nAnd then there's the \"killer crab\"- yuck!  It's described to be in a garlic sauce (which I would have really enjoyed) - but it was so heavily laced with green peppercorns that there was in fact no garlic taste at all.  So disappointing as their signature dish!!!!\n\nTo prove the waitress was ignoring me - she brought my check immediately after I finished my meal and didn't offer any dessert. \n\nDid I eat it all - yes. But only because it was so damn expensive and I didn't want to waste it. $64 for a small order of mussels, half crab and an iced tea with tip!  And did I stop by In-n-Out Burger on my way back to my hotel - yes!!!  Because I was still hungry and at least you know what you're getting there at a good price!!!\n\nManagement - please don't bother to make a fake response to my review because there's nothing you can say to make me feel better about this mediocre meal. This restaurant should be ashamed for their gross food!!!!!\n\n30 May 2018 - As expected management left a typical corporate response which is completely asinine and says nothing and does not address anything I have brought up.

The food itself... Crab is good but the salmon I ordered was below avarage. Small, dry piece, oversalted and drowning in grease.  The 70% of my plate was taken by green leaves of side salad. The price for this dish: $30 (plus tax, plus additional fee of 4.9% charged by this restaurant, plus tip). So if you are not there for crab only, don't go.

We ordered the claim linguine and crab louise which were $25 dollars each and still pretty high, plus tack on the extra 4.67% for the SF health fee.  The place is somewhat clean, but the floors were pretty slippery as I felt like I was almost going to fall on the floor. Bathroom there is only 1 and the place you feel cramped, but they have to since there are many people waiting outside. \n\nService can definitely need improvement as our waiter looked like he did not want to work there.  Pretty much we did not get our bread till very later like 15 minutes after we ordered our food.  The bread was very disappointing as it was hard as a rock and they did not give us butter. We had to ask for it.  Pretty much, we had to ask for more water.  The waiter did not look too busy as they were standing around, I can understand if he was doing other tables.  \n\nWe finally got our food. Pretty much the plate is very huge, but the portions looked every small as the hole to put the food was well small.  The salad was pretty good and had a long plate.  The crab was fresh and the only thing the waiter got right is he asked us for more dressing.

The \nmaitre d' and wait staff was friendly and attentive.\n\nUnfortunately I did not enjoy the meal. \nWe ordered the double crab, shrimp, and mussels, and the fried shrimp and chips.\nThe presentation was nice but everything on the double was void of flavor, except for garlic. I'm a garlic lover but sadly, this overpowered everything. It wouldn't hve been as much of an issue if there had been a choice of having crab or shrimp plain, without the garlic. A better variety of sides like roasted potatoes and corn, as is the norm with most seafood boils, would also be a nice addition.

Sadly it was nothing like that and it almost just tasted bland with a lot of veggies in it. I didn't enjoy it at all.\n\nFor the main dish we ordered garlic noodles with crab and the crab alfredo. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the garlic noodle dish was way better than the alfredo. The garlic noodle was bursting with flavor and the added crab was a must.

We were lucky. We got a table by the window and there was one sea lion playing on the wharf. \n\nThe food here was alright. We of course had to order crab. We got the iron skilled crab for two, crab garlic pasta, a large calamari, and a small garlic French fries. \n\nThe pasta was a bit on the oily side. The calamari was delicious and plenty. The French fries was a lot for it being a small. A small size was good enough to be shared among friends. The crab was a bit on the salty side with the sauce.

In a nutshell - nice location, delicious iron skillet-roasted items, tasty garlic fries, validated parking, and disappointing cioppino...  \n\nIt was crab overload for the family that night as we had an Iron Skillet-Roasted Combo with Mussels, Shrimps, and Crab, a bowl of Crab Chowder, a Crab Alfredo pasta, a Crab Melt sandwich, and a Seafood Cioppino.  If they had Crab Soda or Crab Coffee, we probably would have ordered them, too.  There was no shortage of crab here as the portions were relatively generous.\n\nThe seafood combo was as good as advertised.  The mussels, shrimps, and pieces of mostly crab legs were served atop an extremely hot skillet; it was so hot that one of the dipping sauces was still boiling when it came out.  When our server poured the magic sauce, the smell that filled the air was outrageous.  After savoring the aroma of roasted seafood, it was time to dive in.  The shrimps were the first to go because they would overcook on that hot surface.  The melted lemon butter was perfect for them.  The other dipping sauce was a red wine / soy sauce combination which was meant to complement the mussels.  These were not hard-and-fast rules, so we were dipping our food in either one.  The serving was just about right for four.\n\nAs enjoyable as the roasted combo was, it was a tale of two extremes because of the Seafood Cioppino.  It felt like someone opened a can of tomato sauce, tossed in all those wonderful ingredients, brought the whole concoction to a boil, and then served whatever came out of that experiment.  This was poorly executed and lacked character and flavor.  When I begin to think about the mouthwatering cioppinos at Woodhouse Fish Co., Sotto Mare, and Tadich Grill, Crab House's version was nowhere close.  I won't even bring up Scoma's because it is in a class by itself.  If Crab House were to partner with Apple, they could rename their cioppino to \"iShoulda\" because honestly, \"iShoulda ordered something else.\"  For the love of cioppino, I was trapped into ordering this dish.  As such, I was highly frustrated because I missed out on the Roasted Crab in their Secret Garlic Sauce.\n\nThe Crab Chowder was very decent and contained a hearty amount of crab.  The best part about the Crab Melt sandwich were the Garlic Fries that came with it.  As for the Crab Alfredo, my younger daughter had to resort to her \"parmesan-cheese-cures-all\" approach.  This restaurant offers a lovely view of the bay and a one-hour validated parking at the Pier 39 Garage so there's also daylight here.  Having said that, they will also pad the bill with an additional 4.9% as part of the Healthy San Francisco initiative.  With the prices on their menu, I would expect that the surcharge is already buried somewhere there.  This is a solid spot for roasted seafood which would be our only reason to come back for, if ever...", "author": "John L."}

The 5% surcharge on every ticket.

If the restaurant can't deal with the regulations and taxes to run a restaurant, then they should not be in business.  There are plenty of other successful restaurants that are doing just fine that don't rub this kind of crap in the customer's face.

Squid, shrimp, and mussels can be overcooked easily.  Use the complimentary bread to mop up this stuff.\n2) Garlic fries; Meh...I've had way better.  Not much garlic and a whole lot of chopped onions/shallots. The fries are extra batter-y seasoned fries. Not much garlic flavor to them.\n3) Romaine salad; It's a salad!\n4) Crab Chowder Bowl; Bread tasted fine but I found the crab chowder very uneventful. Too much vegetables and not enough crab meat. Settle for the regular clam chowder.\n5) Whole Crab & Shrimp on a sizzling platter; This was a major disappointment. As a major seafood eater I was shocked to find out how dry the meat of the crab was. The shell cracked easily, a little too easily, to be a FRESH crab.  I can tell this crab was previously cooked, frozen, then cooked again to be served. This makes the shell brittle, flesh dry and shrunk. The meat off the body was too mushy. Tasted like those casino all-you-can eat crab nights.  The shrimp wasn't any better. Most definitely imported previously frozen shrimp.  I had to drown everything in the garlic butter sauce to finish everything.\n\nThe food was not good.

The outside was nice and crunchy.\n\n$7.95 Garlic French Fries - crunchy, salty, & savory. Still I thought it was too expensive for a small bowl of fries even with garlic, herbs, and a bit of parmesan sprinkled on top. \n\nI've noticed quite a few people wrote about negative reactions to the service, which I found surprising, because I've always experienced friendly, efficient service here. They put the bibs on us, ask us how we're doing, and smile. But then again, I'm not familiar with how they operate when the place is super busy with a line out the door. \n\nI always enjoy a tasty and very filling meal here. Somehow I find myself ordering the same skillets over and over again. Perhaps, I'll try the cioppino next time.", "author": "Joy W."}

We ordered the Double shrimp with a whole crab.   We got about 15 tiny over cooked shrimp and an empty crab head shell with crab legs.   All you get for $59.99 are 15 tiny shrimp and crab legs.  I expected the whole crab.   The waiter did not bring our forks until the food was cold.   He never came back to ask if we needed anything else.   Our water glasses were dirty.  Once we were done with dinner it took about 30 minutes to get the check.    When I asked if they validate for parking he said, \"Yes!\"   He took my parking ticket and a minute later handed it to me stating that it was validated.   I trusted him.   When my daughter and I went to pay for parking we were charged the full amount.  The parking attendant told me that there was no validation stamp on the ticket.   He handed me the ticket and to my surprise, he was right.   The waiter lied to me.    I couldn't go back to the restaurant to complain because I'm disabled and not able to walk back to the restaurant againWe got overpriced, over cooked, not what was advertised for the price food.  We got horrible service and to top it off, the waiter lied to me about validating my parking ticket.

The reason was that they replied to my initial comment on the yelp page, saying that they'll reach out to me, but they didn't. Thus, after ONE YEAR, I made another comment and reached out to them, asking them about the additional $10 charge. They pulled out the receipt copy, and it turns out that there was arithmetic issue there. The original bill was $109.35, and I multiplied it by 1.15 and put $125.00 on the total section (and wrote $125 down on my copy). Then I did the subtraction wrong and put $25.65 for the gratuity (it should be $15.65). Although I put $125.00 on the total section, they still charged me 109.35 + 25.65 = $135.00. I admitted that I made an arithmetic error, but it is my understanding from Visa's own rules that in cases where the gratuity does not match the total, the total amount is what should be charged. They replied that the policy is for the server to enter the tip amount, not the total amount, but they are willing to return the $10 to me. That's the whole story.", "author": "Jamie C."}

Super easy to set up a reservation and when you arrive, they have all your information ready. The joint reminds me of a milkshake type diner turned Crab House. Everything is so white: the walls, the tables, the floors. Lots of big windows overlooking FIsherman's Wharf. We were lucky enough to snag a table right next to the window. Our server was also pretty on it. He visited our table enough times and really helped make the experience great!\n\nFor dinner, we went all out! Here's what we had: \n\n-Crab Chowder cup for $9.95. This chowder had lots of crab meat and lots of other stuff. The veggies seemed to overpower the dish only because the crab meat was shredded pretty thin. \n\n-Garlic Bread with melted mozzarella for $8.95. I liked this app. Lots of melted cheese and the bread was baked nicely as well.\n\n-Too Two Crab (Serving 2-3 people) for $89.95. OH-EM-GEE, this is the dish to get! You get two whole crabs with the inside guts cleaned out. It comes on a sizzling skillet and served with a garlic herb butter sauce for dipping. SOOOO GOOD! Lots of crab meat in the legs and body. Great deal as well!\n\n-Large iron skillet roasted Mussels and Shrimp for $39.95. Also a crowd favorite that day. The shrimp and mussels came sizzling and were flavored so well. The same butter dipping sauce made the entire dish come to life!\n\nOverall, what a great evening! Great seafood, celebrating birthdays and loving the atmosphere.

We were at pier 39 on our recent SF trip so we had to stop by and get some. Between the 6 of us, we split a crab feast, garlic fries, calamari, and I got to try some of the crab chowder. \n\nThe main attraction and reason we were there, the crab feast, was delicious. The crab is nice and crispy and buttery. The shell was also easy to break which is always nice. It was so crispy that you could eat the whole end of the leg that's attached to the crab.\n\nThe garlic fries were garlicky (that's a word right? It is now :) Haha) and crispy, and the calamari was tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. Not sure what the sauce is but it tasted like a better version of a cocktail sauce; perfect pairing to the calamari. \n\nFor as good as the meal was, the crab chowder missed the mark. I was excited to try it only to find out it was a little bland and flat. \n\nOverall our experience was good. The service was great as all of our needs were taken care of in a timely manner and the food came out quickly. This place is a bit pricey..being about $40 a person between 6 for the above mentioned. But, it's also crab so it's kind of expected. If you're not on a budget I'd highly recommend this spot; I'd pass on the crab chowder though.", "author": "Vi D."}

My cousin is a veteran, multiple tours in Afghanistan and he is the leader for ruckfor22.org .  So I wanted to show my support and how did I show said support?  By marching from Sacramento to San Francisco over the course of 2 days.  Full pack. Trust me, it was crazy to walk that distance no humans feet, shins and calves should go through that, Lol. Well hello Mr. Blister? Good evening my pal shin splints.  We were a mess. Walked to vacaville the first day and then from emeryville to treasure island the second day.  Even over the new Bay Bridge. I was a limping mess across the finish line. 148 people honked at us. Yes, I counted because, well, what else you gonna do when walking this distance. But we finished!  Felt great, felt terrible.

Nice atmosphere, waterfront views, easy access. The food, although not absolutely spectacular (perhaps my summers on Cape Cod have spoiled me when it comes to fresh chowders and seafood) is still decent. We ordered bowls of New England Clam Chowder (just plain bowls...not the sourdough option so many others around us chose) and the servings were very generous. The chowder was thick and creamy but, again, does not even remotely compare to the chowders one can easily find in New England. But hey, we expected that much. We also ordered the mussels (in some type of coconut curry sauce) and the crispy fried scallops (appetizer). The mussels turned out to be surprisingly small and bland and were literally drowning in far too much sauce. The scallops were much better - crisp and well-seasoned -  and a nice way to fill our hungry stomachs while we waited for our chowder.\n\nI almost gave this place three stars but decided the ambience is enough to bump it up a notch. It might have had five stars if not for our waitress who seemed lost in translation (she brought our chowder in the bread bowls even though we clearly stated NO bread bowls). She was nice enough but in other ways appeared annoyed when she brought us the wrong orders, etc. It was a little uncomfortable but - as in all dining adventures - you never quite know what you're going to get when it comes to food and service. \n\nNext time we're in San Francisco we might stop in for an appetizer and a drink but explore other dining opportunities outside of the Crab House.", "author": "Carol E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-21", "description": "For what it's worth, the food could be more tasty. But let's ease into that after the basic particulars:\n\nThe location is nice, easy to locate on the second floor of the area. The exterior is a nice ivory as the restaurant titles adorn the walls. It will catch your eye -- just how it caught mine.\n\nWhen you saunter inside the restaurant you will immediately be greeted by the staff, which is kind! They try to tend to their customers quickly and efficiently -- we were seated immediately. The walkways are compact, hard to really move around with waiters and customers bustling to and fro; nonetheless, we were seated at a dainty booth that was freshly cleaned. It is probably the restaurant style, but they do not have windows. It's a nice touch, but a bird flew inside through our \"window.\"\n\nMoving on, the menu had a decent amount of choices for seafood lovers. You'd spend a good time perusing its contents and facing a mental debate on which plates to order. Now, most are expensive for what they are worth.\n\nPersonally, their garlic fries were better than our actual course. I do not remember the exact name of our order, but it was one supreme crab and a few shrimps. The shrimps were okay, nothing special, so it was a great filler. The crab I didn't enjoy too much. To be frank, it wasn't bad -- it just was not anything special.\n\nI'd rather call my garlic fries we ordered my \"dinner.\" We ordered the chicken alfredo as well; I couldn't even eat 1/4 of it. Yes, it was /that/ plain. The sauce was straight up cream, welling at the bottom, and not evenly coating their hard pasta. Maybe the pepper they grinded with it along with some spices bumped up the tolerance for me to have a couple of bites, but it was so incredibly plain I could not eat it. For its price as well.\n\nAside from the simple food, their staff was nice. It was a busy day so it was understandable to why they forgot my drink, but with that aside the staff was extremely kind and patient.\n\nThe noise level within the restaurant, as one might expect, is as loud as you might think it is. Converse from table to table morphs together into a loud plethora of jumbled voices, and maybe from screams of children -- if you are okay with that.

Was really excited to try their crab melt sandwich paired with their garlic french fries.  There was no wait at all at 5:30pm, and we were seated at the tables in the center aisle since we were only a party of 2.  They do have some booths along the inside wall of the restaurant and also tables along with window with some great views.  The center aisles with tables are a VERY tight fit with servers, bus boys and patrons constantly weaving in/out and squeezing between your chair and the person sitting behind you.  Food I'll give 3 stars. They start you out with bread and butter, but the bread is some type of French roll that is not warm and is relatively chewy.  Butter is provided in a metal tin and difficult to spread compared to the small packets since it's \"chunky\" and not smooth. Garlic french fries don't compare to Gordon Biersch garlic fries that you can get at the ball game, but they come with the crab melt.  The sandwich itself did have a lot of lump crab meat which tasted fresh, but would have liked more cheese or something as it was a bit dry for my liking.  Reason this place only gets 1 star is because their service was horrible...  Our server was not friendly, took our order while being distracted (he was still typing in prior table's order onto handheld device when asking for ours), never came to check-in on us once during our meal despite stopping over multiple times to engage in conversation with a table visiting from Spain who sat next to us, I had to ask him to check on my wife's entree (they brought my entree out with her cup of soup, but never followed-up when her soup was finished).  Finally, it was me who stopped him to ask for a box and the check and that's when he asked if I wanted a refill on my soda (when my glass had been empty 1/2 way through my meal) and also asked, \"how was everything?\".

I don't know if my taste buds are changing or if my stomach is shrinking but the last two times we came here, my wife and I were unable to finish the 3 lbs. of killer crab. \n\nThe only thing we ever order here is the Killer crab. Honestly, don't even waste your time with anything other than that. If you do, don't say I didn't warn you. They give you free bread, and there is oil and balsamic vinegar on the table. STOP! Save the bread until the crab arrives!!! Dip it in the hot plate that the crab arrives on. If you want even a better experience, ask for a side of the killer crab sauce to dip your bread in. That's it for the food. Just bread, crab and sauce. Throw in a couple beers from the bar and it's pretty satisfying. The crab is roasted in a garlic sauce with capers, Szechuan peppercorns (can numb your mouth out), and the secret ingredient in the sauce is the crab innards. I know it sound gross but, you gotta try it. It's not off putting at all.   \n\nThis place is right in the middle of Pier 39 and if you ask for a window seat you can crack your crab while looking at the Golden Gate Bridge. Pretty nice view. The seats are in cramped quarters and on really sunny days it can get pretty warm in there however, just reach over and open one of the windows... Staff are really nice here. We've been coming here for at least 6-7 years and the faces don't change. So their employees definitely stick around. \n\nOkay, the reason why I'm giving this place 4 stars out of 5 is because of the value. When we started coming here the price for 3 lbs. of crab was $49.99, not a bad deal. This past weekend, it was $64.99 for the same 3 lbs. They also charge you an additional 4.8% on top of that, for what is described as a \"cost of doing business fee\"!! I don't understand that at all. Keep in mind this 4.8% is on the entire bill!! Not cool at all :/\n\nIn past trips to San Francisco, it would be pretty normal for my wife and I to eat here at least a half dozen times. Given the increased prices and the fact I can't finish our regular order anymore, one visit per trip will do from now on.\n\nEnjoy this place Yelpers!", "author": "Alan Y."}

I asked her three times for regular. Still nothing changed.\n\n-3 plus pounds of crab legs and I had  to ask three people for a bib for us.

Seriously, if you've never seen a 100lb girl put down 3 loaves of bread and an entire crab on her own, you should treat me to dinner. No, but seriously, the crab here is amazing and if you aren't ordering multiple loaves of bread to absorb all of the garlic-buttery-deliciousness on the skillet, you are definitely missing out.\n\nMy biggest gripe during my last two visits has been the DISGUSTING floor. I almost ate it twice here, and not because I'm clumsy or choose to go out in heels. There is a layer of oil (butter?) and grime on the floor that cannot be sanitary! Also, I don't understand why, but I've been getting served cold chowder ... and that's just not okay.\n\nSo although I give the crab and shrimp a solid 5 stars, the filthy floors and cold chowder bring my rating down to a 4.

We ordered the small steam clams, whole crab with their special garlic sauce, and small crab chowder. They have a wall of HOT SAUCES that was kind of cool to be able to choose what kind of hot sauce you want. They have different sauces from mild to extreme. The \"TOXIC\" hot sauce is crazy hot! If you are someone who likes hot stuff try that sauce out! \n\nThe crab flavor was okay, it came out on a hot plate and it was a pretty presentation. The crab was very fresh and the meat fell out of the shell easily. The small bowls of clams was a good size to share for two people. It was very fresh and did not taste like the salt water from the ocean. The crab chowder was delicious!! The small is really enough just for one person. They use real dungeons crab meat in it. There is a small bar inside the restaurant with a small drink menu as well!!\n\nBe aware that there is a small SF fee on the receipt and that is not part of tips (kinda weird).", "author": "Cindy W."}

Ordered the 'lotsa crabs' for sharing together with a shrimp and mussels platter. \n\nThe crabs were amazing! The garlic and butter sauce were just nice and gave the crabs a nice flavour. And they do use peppercorns so beware cause if you bite into them, they tend to give u a very numbing after taste. The shrimp and mussels were average as I thought the shrimps was not that fresh and mediocre, but the mussels were awesome! I love the garlic sauce that comes with it and compliments the freshness of the mussels.\n\nThe service crew can get really busy at times and you might have to wait during peak hours after 6:30pm.

All on a sizzling hot plate. The mussels were perfect and topped off with a white wine sauce at our table. And since it was \"double mussels\" there was at least 20-30 on the plate. The whole crab was so delicious and the best part is the waitress cuts the crab into sections so it is easier for the customers to crack. \n\nService: The service was also great! The waitress was attentive and so were the bus boys constantly changing our scrap bowl when they noticed it was filling to the top.

Lunch opens at 1130. \n\n(This is gonna be a long long review.. to skip through all the bull, scroll down to the asterisks)\n\nMy dad's family first situated in SF in California: but, we all know.. don't go wasting your time, money, or precious food buds at touristy restaurants near the pier. \n\nMy boyfriend's family asked me for suggestions since I've gone and go to SF a lot throughout my life: just visiting family, family friends, or spending days here. Yeah I didn't know of places at the pier besides the little place I like to eat red clam chowder which isn't what his family was asking for.. So I asked my cousin who lived here forever and she didn't know.. And then BAM.. My cousin Kyle who also lives there had a suggestion and only one.. He took his ex-girlfriend her on a date once and it was GOOD, he warned it might be packed though and that it was gonna be pricey.\n\nI checked in with my BOO-THANG's parents and they said money wasn't an issue.\n\nMy cousin and I have similar taste palate however my boyfriend's family prefers things that aren't very salty, seasoned, garlicky.. basically bland. So I was a little scared, but they wanted FRESH, FRESH, FRESH CRAB, and that was their only request. On top of that his relatives from Vietnam were joining us and I didn't know what their tastebuds even agreed with. \n\n***********\n The seafood was indeed FRESH. I've never had crab fresher than this and I'm not a crab person and I would have this again: there was so meat in it.. Everyone at the table loved their food. Although his brother said it was very garlicky (which I can handle), but he did love the pasta which had garlic. We got the crab version by accident.. Our waiter (shame on you.. you clearly heard it and repeated it) brought us crab instead of shrimp because not everyone *coughcough* my boyfriend likes that much crab. And crab is more pricey, so that slipup wasn't appreciated. \n\n^ We got 2 iron-skillets: one whole crab and double mussels, one crab and double shrimp.\nOne garlic noodles with crab. One garlic fries. \n\nThey bring out complimentary bread. \n\nHis family thought one skillet would be enough even though I didn't think so and we ended up ordering two. Mind you there were 4 couples at the table: 8 people. and four of the older crowd didn't eat that much crab, but it was the right amount. Except for me.. I still felt hungry.. \n\nTheir garlic fries: you can't taste the garlic.. so maybe don't even bother, but their good and crispy, just ain't garlicky. \n\nThey give you the not cheap bibs.. better than boiling crab: so you know where you're at when you're eating here: the fancy goods.\n\nThe interior was clean (white), chic, elegant, and cute.. I know my family would love this place especially my mom, so I'll treat them next time.

Not three and not quite four. \n\nOur server was very...quiet. Quiet and polite but not...friendly. I dunno. Got a weird vibe.\n\nThe acoustics here are seriously unpleasant. The walls and floor and everything are covered in this white subway tile and the tables are marble, no doubt both for convenience in cleaning, but the busser was taking absolutely no care in stacking dishes and glasses, making the noise bounce around and hurt my ears. Surgical is the word that comes to mind. Surgical plus fake crabs all over the wall. Weird. The table where we were seated had chairs for six people, but space for maybe six small teenagers. Not full-sized adults. No elbow room, hardly any table room...very uncomfortable. \n\nNow, the food. The food was the best part of this experience, which I suppose is how it should be. The cioppino was fantastic; the sauce/broth was spicy and tasted like they made it themselves, which was nice. For $28, I felt there wasn't enough seafood in it, but I didn't leave dissatisfied. The crab that the rest of our party ate was really, really tasty. My partner ate land crab (chicken. that's what chicken is called) with fries. It was meh.\n\nOverall, I won't be back because it's expensive and horribly uncomfortable, despite the food being on-point.\n\n[update] I didn't bring the concerns about the ambiance up with our server because there was nothing he could do to change it. If I had, then he'd be forced to apologize and why should he? It's the walls.", "author": "Julia D."}

We really wanted some crab and it's just not available for us to cook for ourselves yet because of the domoic acid levels being found in the local crab. Sooo....off to Crab House (I think they get their crabs from Washington, like the Fisherman's Wharf places do...but frankly I didn't ask). Got a 6:30 reservation and arrived 10 minutes early and had to wait those 10 minutes....but it was worth it because it was PACKED with walk-ins and when we were seated we got a lovely booth with a view of the whole room and out the windows. We ordered drinks, cheese bread, Caesar salad, oyster shooter, the crab feast and the Torta della Nonna with lemon zabaglione.  \n\nThe Caesar was poorly tossed....all the dressing was on the pieces in the middle of the oblong plate, with none at the ends...but once we figured that out we worked it out ourselves and the flavor was good. \n\nThe oyster shooter (sans vodka) was weird....it wasn't in a shotglass, but a small drink glass, FULL of SPICY liquid with the poor little oyster floating around in it. I didn't get it. Too spicy and too much liquid. Just use a shotglass, please, so I can down the whole thing in one shot. And a tad less spicy, please. Kids loved the cheesy garlic bread.\n\nThe crab feast was about 3 crabs (according to our server) and it was pretty darn good. At $129.95 it's the bargain (!) dish on the menu, touted to serve 4. We could have eaten 1 1/2 crab feasts, for sure, between two adults and two teens. Because we love our crab. So that's definitely a downside...we didn't quite get our fill of crab.\n\nEnded with the Torta dessert and it was really quite good. Lemony and I believe almondy and very satisfying.\n\nService was excellent, from the main server to the  people taking away our crab shells consistently and giving us new bowls to fill. The atmosphere is light and bright and twinkly...liked it a lot.\n\nReally think it's a 3 1/2 but I'm going downwards because it is Pier 39 after all and so it is very very pricey. \n\nHere's a tip: check in to Pier 39 itself and go for the coupon pak they offer at the 2nd floor California Welcome Center. It's good for 2 hours of free parking....since we got there early we were actually parked for almost 3 hours and we only paid $9....would have had to pay $27.", "author": "Laurie H."}

No, they're digesting.  And what good  crustaceans they were, too.   \nWe didn't know this place existed until we received a gift card to The Dead Fish in Crockett and didn't want to go there.  With so many sister restaurants to choose from, we decided on The Crab House.  Not to be confused with a house of ill repute, the Crab House is on the upper level of Pier 39 with views and lots of dead crabs hanging from the walls and ceiling.\nThe menu, from our understanding, doesn't change and there are no nightly specials to confuse you.  What's on the menu (and it's on line too at crabhouse39.com) is what's being served.\nMy husband, who will not order fish at a restaurant on his first visit, (at my last count this was visit numero uno) ordered the fish and chips.  I chose the Crab melt sandwich.  Both come with garlic fries if you don't want just fried fries.\nFish and chips.  One huge plank of Basa fish.  What's a Basa?  What's a matta with you!  It's a white fish that's firmer than Talapia so it fries up better.  Flakey, firm and delicious.  \nCrab melt sandwich.  Probably by itself would have been good, but I tasted the cocktail sauce and wanted it on my sandwich.  No food pictures should be an indication that we were way too into our food to play with it.  Sorry folks, you'll just have to go get your own!\nThe prices are pricy.  But not overly for a tourist trap.  And the portions are generous so things balanced out in the end.   And so did we, we helped each other waddle down the stairs and thank goodness we parked a bit away.  We needed to walk the meal off.  \nWe'll be back as soon as we need a calorie rich, seafood embedded, San Francisco Visitor Center Approved meal.\nThe service was pretty good.  As soon as we thought \"Our server has left for the evening?\"  he appeared to tend to us again.  We don't need a lot of tending.  And we don't usually have much tender.

Why hit the touristy spot?!\n\nThat being said, the roommate had family in town and they wanted to have crab for lunch and hit pier 39. Rather than try and go to another neighborhood for crab, I decided on the Crab house at pier 39. The location was perfect and they took reservations! With 2 little kids, I didn't want to have to wait for a table.\n\nDungeness killer crab roasted in their secret garlic sauce ($38.95 for Whole crab 2 plus lb) - The crab meat was sweet and juicy, but their secret garlic sauce didn't have much garlicky flavor. Plus, the head of the shell was empty and I love that part! I was a little disappointed by that.\n\nFish & chips ($18.95) - Gigantic piece of fish! It came out freshly fried and hot! I had a small bite and it tasted good with the tartar sauce. The fries were garlic fries, but didn't taste very garlicky. They were nice and crispy though.\n\nGarlic fries ($6.95 small) - Since we had a party of 4 adults & 2 kids, we also ordered a side of garlic fries. These were the same as the fries that came with the Fish & chips. Nicely fried but not very garlicky. \n\nCaesar with whole baby romaine, croutons & parmesan ($11.95) - I enjoyed this. The romaine was fresh and crunchy. The dressing had a nice anchovy-ness to it. I love salad and this didn't disappoint. \n\nCrab cocktail with house made cocktail sauce ($15.95) - The worst dish. And it was my pick! It was basically a small salad of tomatoes, lettuce & other veggies topped was a small mound of crab mixed with cucumbers. I was picturing a huge mound of just crab topped with cocktail sauce, so this was very disappointing. More salad fixings than crab itself.

Our food, however, was less than stellar.  We got the iron roasted skillet with double shrimp and whole crab with a side of steamed mixed vegetables.  Shrimp was tasteless, mushy and tiny (40-60 count) but the lemon caper butter sauce was on point.  The crab was stringy and hard, much of it stuck to the inside of the shells.  In our mixed vegetable side, there were random pasta noodles. Here's my problem - the pictures on their yelp page are misleading and the quality of the food was below what you can find at your local grocery store. We ate it because we were starving but I will never go back. Our entire meal was $150 for extremely poor quality food.  We shared our thoughts on the food with our waiter and received a free dessert as a mea culpa (tiramisu was delicious).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-07", "description": "Crab House is one of the more casual (yet still pricey!) dining options in Pier 39 yet it was a great way to celebrate my early birthday dinner with the No1DP, who was in town yet again. Like any Pier 39 restaurant it is touristy, but we wanted to play tourist in SF as I'm not in the city all that often.\n\nVENUE: Located in Pier 39, your view of the wharf can vary depending on where you sit. The actual tables themselves can be a bit small as they are trying to maximize the number of people the restaurant can fit. As a more casual option it can be a bit noisier (compare neighboring Fog Harbor, more formal but quieter). \n\nSERVICE: Service was busy even during the later hours of the middle of the week. It can be hard to get your waiter's attention if the restaurant is really busy. We had a little difficulty pinning our waiter at times but was still attentive.\n\nAlthough bibs were given we both didn't make much of a mess eating. Our clothes surprisingly didn't smell of seafood or garlic afterwards.\n\nWine consisted of a glass of Fume Blanc. As we were eating seafood a Chardonnay or Riesling would be too heavy. Fume Blanc is quite smooth.\n\nAppetizers consisted of a plate of mussels and shrimp ($19.95) served in a cast-iron skillet. Shrimps were plump and tender. Mussels were firm but not rubbery. It's best to eat them when they are sizzling hot. Whatever sauce they use to drizzle the shrimp and mussels is amazing and I had as much fun sucking the sauce as I did eating the platter. \n\nCrab House is known for their \"world famous killer crab\", which is dungeness crab roasted in their secret garlic sauce served in a cast-iron skillet. Waitress mentions that a whole crab can serve 2 people. No1DP and I opted for the whole crab option ($38.95). The head is already pre-cleaned and what you get is that the body is ready to be broken apart in half. The legs you'll have to break off yourself, but they're easy to pull out with a firm tug.\n\nAll the crab legs were meaty. The meat from the pinchers is a little more tough than the legs but there was still plenty of meat. However the best part of the crab is not the legs but the body, which includes the crab paste. The paste tastes a little briny and is PERFECT to suck on. I had the most fun dissecting the body and taking out all the meat. The No1DP never saw anyone so intently focused on picking a crab clean and enjoying every last bite. \n\nDessert consisted of tiramisu ($7.95). Tiramisu was cold and firm and contained the right proportion of chocolate powder, mascarpone cheese, ladyfingers and espresso. It's a perfect way to end the night as well as take away any of the seafood or butter aftertaste.\n\nMany thanks to the No1DP for taking me here.", "author": "Isabella B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-21", "description": "My friend used to live in San Francisco and would seriously not shut up about this place. To be honest, I was skeptical at first. I mean, c'mon, a place called CRAB HOUSE located at PIER 39 (pretty much the most touristy area in SF)?! Sounded pretty whatever to me, but we went and I can honestly say I am pretty fcking impressed by this place.\n\nThe interior isn't anything special. Very nautical and touristy-- plastic crabs hanging, white walls, nets all around. Again, another reason I wasn't expecting much. Because it gets pretty busy here, service isn't amazing. We had to keep hailing for a waiter because they weren't very attentive. Anyways, here's what we got:\n\nCRAB FEAST $115\nThe menu claims this is to be shared for four people, so we ordered a couple more things to accommodate our party of five. THEIR CRAB IS SO. GOOD. I've never had it prepared like this before-- roasted, dry seasoned, and crispy, golden brown edges, sitting in a pool of heavenly garlic sauce. It was also relatively easy to crack open because it was roasted which I LOVE because I tend to stray away from crab since it's too much of a hassle to get the meat out. The meat was nice and moist and tasted amazingggg in that garlic sauce. Also, they give you complimentary bread in the beginning so it was nice to sop up the bread with the remaining garlic sauce after our meal.\n\nMUSSELS & SHRIMP {MEDIUM PORTION} $20\nNot as blown away by this as the crab, but not bad! The mussels were cooked nicely and they also provide a butter sauce to dip them in. The shrimp tasted too burnt/roasted so I wasn't a big fan of them in this dish.\n\nGARLIC NOODLES W/ SHRIMP $21\nWe got this solely to add some carbs to our meal, but I actually really enjoyed it! The sauce was flavorful, creamy, and not too salty, the noodles were cooked al dente, and the shrimp was a lot better in this than in the Mussels/Shrimp plate.\n\nGARLIC FRIES {SMALL PORTION} $8\nThey forgot about our fries, so they upgraded us to a medium portion which was nice. These weren't that good, but fries are fries-- so you know you're still gonna eat them, lol. They had lots of garlic bits tossed in them, but the fries were kind of soggy.\n\nMELON MOJITO $12\nMeh, I wouldn't recommend this. Tasted like a watered down Midori Sour.\n\nPrices aren't anything impressive, but you have to factor in that this is in a touristy area AND it's seafood which is always on the pricey side. Service isn't grrrreat, but I did appreciate that they upgraded our fries since they forgot about them. I'd definitely come back, but next time I'd probably just get the crab and garlic pasta because those were definitely the stars of the meal!", "author": "Sarah S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-11", "description": "Pier 39 is a main tourist attraction at Fisherman's Wharf, so I'm not too surprised that I felt Crab House was a wee overpriced and overhyped for what it is.  I made reservations for my seafood-loving father and my vegetarian mother upon reading the reviews for Crab House.  We arrived on time and were seated promptly next to a large window overlooking the bay, where we could see ships sailing underneath the setting sun toward Alcatraz.  I would not be surprised if the menu prices are inflated so the restaurant can pay the rent for this piece of prime real estate.\n\nWe ordered the following for the table:\n1) 2lb+ Whole Crab ($37)\n2) Crab Alfredo ($19)\n3) Garlic Fries for sharing ($10)\n4) Open faced Crab Melt Sandwich ($19)\n5) Garlic Noodles ($12)\n6) Pitchers of Stella\n\nThe restaurant proudly cites its win as the best crab in San Francisco, but I'm not exactly convinced that it deserves the title.  Yes, the size of the 2lb crab was much larger than any East Coast crab, but size isn't everything to me.  The entire crab, including the shell, was smothered in oil (aka the secret garlic sauce), thus leaving a sticky garlicky taste, and not a fresh seafood taste, in my mouth.  However, once you're finished with the crab, don't let the waitstaff take away the plate just yet.  Sop up the garlic sauce with the complimentary bread!\n\nThe pasta dishes are made with thick sauces, making them good for sharing. I'd recommend shelling out the extra $7 to get Crab Alfredo as opposed to regular garlic noodles.  I'm one who disfavors mayonnaise in my sandwiches, so the crab sandwich was a good choice for me.  It's made with pulled pieces of crabmeat, and topped with lettuce and tomato.  The bread is moistened with garlic butter.  Garlic seems to be the running theme at this restaurant.\n\nNote: this is not a good restaurant for vegetarians.", "author": "Teresa L."}

There was a time in 2014 that I went for 5 weekends in a row. Yup! There hasn't been one \"miss\" meal to date. Their crab chowder is so delicious that I wish I could order a gallon and freeze it at home. \n \nOur Favorites: Crab, shrimp/mussels, crab chowder and garlic fries. \n\nSO much good stuff you won't know where to start and it's the type of bill that doesn't hurt at the end because the quality was worth it. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation, it's easier to get right in on rainy days but still just in case you run in to a busy night spare yourself and reserve (waits can be over 1-2 hrs).  You can dress up or down at this one and keep in mind this is not usually a quiet place.

My husband and I visited this place several times in the past 4 years. Each time we order the combo of shrimp, mussel and crab was fresh and juicy. However, when we brought our friends who flew from another state to visit us to this place today, we were totally shocked! They started to serve refrigerate cold French bread which is extremely hard and stiff to chew. And they refused to warm it because our servant believes it is what it is. Think about it, how would a good restaurant service rejects their customers' request!!!!! Worse thing is that the combo we used to order is not fresh any more. The crab meat is dried out which means it's been there for a while and the mussel shrink a lot to tiny finger tip compare to their shell size. They are dry and not juicy at all.

The flavor of their secret garlic sauce was delicious, but the meat for the crabs were on the dry side, especially when it got closer to the tip of the claws. The mussels were small and the shrimps alone was just okay. Everything tasted a lot better with the garlic sauce so make sure you ask for extra. \nThe place itself is super crowded and small. The walkway is only big enough for one person to walk at a time. Expect to be down and dirty when eating here. There's shells on the floor and it's kind of slippery. I almost slipped while walking to our table and the top of my chair was super greasy when I pulled it out. \nService could use a bit of work.

I used to enjoy their crab and cioppino.  Tonight was the first time I ever returned a dish.  I could not force myself to eat the cioppino that I ordered.  It was so salty my mouth had that tingling, puckered sensation as if I had swallowed salt water from the ocean.  The calamari and shrimp were really tough and chewy.  There were no pieces of crab, just shredded pieces that were sprinkled on top.  I was so disappointed that I had brought my friends to this restaurant.  Another thing I noticed that was different was the bread that was served to us.  I could be mistaken, but I remember loving their bread.  I thought it was baked fresh and piping hot.  We would slather on the butter as it would melt into all the nooks and crannies.  Tonight we were given something more akin to ordinary room temperature dinner rolls.\n\nMy child and my friend ordered the filet mignon and it was prepared well - medium rare more on the rare.  They enjoyed their meals.\n\n\n7/27/17\n\nI just want to add the general manager was so kind to contact me directly to express her concern about my recent dining experience.

They've got portholes, colorful crab shells, and old transportation methods around the walls. \n--Their drink selection of special alcoholic concoctions; my favorite is the champagne-OJ-cranberry Red Herring. I always get that.\n--The tiramisu is SOOOO light and fluffy! DE. Licious!\n--Their crab chowder (NOT clam, crab) is a mix of red and white sauce, slightly spicy, creamy, and thick, with large shredded pieces of crab. \n--Their complimentary bread is almost real Italian; very crunchy outside, and soft and slightly sweet inside. They already have the olive oil out on the table, along with seafood cracking and digging utensils. \n--Speaking of crab, theirs comes out on a sizzling platter with garlic butter sauce, and is deliciously sweet and fresh. \n--Their crab cakes are deep-fried, with a crunchy coating, mild sauce underneath, and picked red bell pepper, which makes them HOT. Fun to pick at as you stare out the window.\n--The view is fantastic. Depending on your viewpoint, you get an excellent view of either SF, the docks, or the bay. \n--The service. Even in packed times, waitstaff is quick and professional. Also, I had one bad plate while here, and they asked for comments for the chef, quickly removed it, and replaced it with a menu and swifty follow-up. They also comped the dish! They also don't rush you if you're cracking shells, and they're quick to clean up once you're through.\n\nThings I don't like: \n--That bad plate was crab enchiladas. They came in a mild red sauce with salsa verde, which was good, but the inside was oozing Velveeta cheese, which completely overwhelmed any crab flavor. The flour (not corn) tortilla was partially gooey, too. \n--The price. It's a four- or five-star restaurant feel, with waitstaff in shirtsleeves and vests, marble floors and tables, but it comes with a five-star price. Expect to pay $30 per person, or $50 with drinks. \n\nEven so, if you have a special evening or just want to splurge, come on by!", "author": "Audra S."}

We were sitting next to the emergency exit, and I think the manager opened it and we started complaining it was cold..lol. Then he got kinda pissed, I think... saying it was way too stuffy in the restaurant, which honestly I didn't notice.\n\nI got the seabass..... it was decent. Maybe more salt was needed? I liked the tomatoes that came with it... and basil... always a great combo. The little pasta thing they gave with it.. it was too much little pasta pieces. It was like eating rice, but a bunch of rice. I wish they gave me a side salad instead. If I ever come back, then I would ask.\n\nMy friend got the crab melt and it wasn't anything he was expecting. It came with a side of fries and he didn't touch any of it... So... THAT'S OKAY. I totally swooped in on his fries and I ate it. The fries were on the soggy/soft side, which I know a lot of people hate..but I love my fries soggy (yes I know, I'm freaky) and the garlic on top was sooo good.\n\nHe also ordered the crab chowder.. which he let me have the first bite.. Well, it was .. okay.. I told him it needed more salt, so he added some.. and voila~~ It was a lot better. Not the best crab chowder, but a lot better from what I had tasted.\n\nI guess this place just needs more salt... Slightly bland for an expensive tourist spot. We had a nice view though...

Great food, great views, and entertaining tourist-watching, says this tourist.\n\nI really love crab, and the dominatrix, er, dungeoness crab is my second favorite variety, beaten by That Deadliest Catch, the Alaskan King Crab.  The Crab House uses some sort of highly secret garlic butter sauce and bakes their crabs rather than boiling them.  I prefer the sweet, simply boiled taste of dungeoness crab, but the garlic flavor is still fine -- although it's not aesthetically pleasing, leaving a green-gray residue on the crab's interior that resembles the parts of the crab that you wouldn't want to eat (and which the Crab House staff has kindly removed for you).\n\nCrab House also produces my second-favorite steamed clams around (333 in Oceanside, there's a congratulatory first-place review for you coming up soon).\n\nView of the sea lions in the harbor and Alcatraz are nice.

It just wasn't that great. \n\nFirst, we were seated right next to the Kitchen with three kids ages 6-11. The bussers kept throwing the plates together right next to us which was loud and very distracting. They also pack you in here like sardines in a can. We were slammed right up against the next table and they were as annoyed as we were. And the third thing that really kind of got to me was the crab. You would think with a name like The Crab House, there would be somewhat variety of crab.....maybe just a hint of King Crab?  They should call this place The Dungeness Crab House, cause that's the only Crab you will get.  \n\nWith all that negativity, the crab portions were huge. You paid for it, but you won't go away hungry. The steamed clams were pretty darn good with toasted garlic bread to dip in. \n\nI can see why this place is popular, especially with the tourists.

We examined the menu extensively and eventually settled on the house speciality which is \"garlic dungeness crab\" that is served on a hot iron skillet with melted butter. We had 2 that serve 4 people reasonably well along with grilled shrimp. The crab is delicious but too much for me, I ordered a crab angel hair lasagna which was great, portion a little small for $25.00 and a bit too salty for my taste, it came in a butter sauce. I ordered cheesy garlic bread with that.\nThe waitress was interesting, my party of 3 are all Mandarin speakers and I assume my waitress was also since she seemed to understand Mandarin, but refused to speak Mandarin to my guests and spoke  limited English which added to some ordering confusion. She appeared to be the only waitress working there and at times we ordered items from the bus boys instead of her since she appeared over worked.\nOverall the quality of the dishes were good, tourist expensive though, our bill ran up to $275.00 not including tip and no alcohol. \nDecor was OK, appearance of a touristy crab place but the window seating was overlooking the pier.

Barely can get up to go to the bathroom. And there was only ONE bathroom, one toilet, which was disgusting. \n\nI would recommended Bubba Gumps at the end of the pier.

You even get to rock a ridiculous-looking bib. \n\nThis place is adorable inside and a great dining option when in Fisherman's Wharf. Fresh seafood, a nice view and no frills. I loved the Crab Chowder, big pieces of crab, corn and potatoes all doing a Happy Dance in a creamy, piping hot bath.\n\nWe got the Mussels, Crab and Shrimp Skillet and the Crab in Garlic Sauce. Everything was delicious and seasoned just right. I would warn, however, that the Mussels, Crab and Shrimp Skillet comes with a good amount more mussels than anything else (of course, right?), so take that into consideration. \n\nPortions are huge and perfect for sharing. Get a Skillet or two and share it with a group. Get a side of Garlic Fries and an ice cold beer, and you are good to go!\n\nSide Note: It's very funny when a crab leg slips out of someones hands and flies across the restaurant.

For the price, I expected a classier experience with better service. Instead I found a place that looked like a diner crossed with a knickknack shop, and made me feel like my money was being wasted.\n\nOur waiter was brusque, and was really pushy about getting us to order. He circled back to our table every 30s or so to see if we were ready. After we waffled a few times, he basically told us exactly what we were going to order, and gave us an option between chowder and salad. This would have been super helpful, if only it was done in a slightly more tactful way.\n\nThe two of us ended up splitting the Combo Mussels, Shrimp & Crab skillet and Crab Chowder. The skillet was mostly a mussels skillet, with a few paltry pieces of shrimp and crab thrown in as an afterthought. That being said, there was a good amount of mussels. The seasoning was virtually non-existent, and the provided sauces didn't do much to add flavour either. The Crab Chowder was a better experience, with interesting flavours, though very little crab.", "author": "Graham B."}

The Killer Crabs are roasted in Crab House's garlic sauce and is super rich and heavy, so eat fast before it gets cold and heavy. If you're going to order more crabs, maybe have them stagger it so you don't have any sitting out while you're chowing down on the others.\n\nIt's a little pricey, but it's a super fun place to go if you want great atmosphere and even better crabs.", "author": "Vivian L."}

We had reservations but got there early so we had to wait a bit but it wasn't too horrible. So many tourists there that you're sure to get stomped on a time or two unfortunately but once inside things got much better for us. I ordered the calamari, crab chowder and the garlic fries - the chowder was delicious, the calamari left a bit to be desired as I didn't really enjoy the sauce they served with it, and the fries were decent. We then ordered the crab feast. It seemed like as soon as we ordered our food, it was magically delivered within five minutes. The crab appears to be fried instead of boiled like at most places and it was phenomenal!! I did wish the crab came withx  a side other than what I believe was a small bowl of couscous - maybe potatoes or corn or something. Only other issue I ran into was that I ordered a drink that I didn't like and when I asked for it to be returned the waiter got to asking too many damned questions. I took one sip, found it unsavory, and returned it. Just take it back and ask if there is something else I'd like.

Our food and drinks were promptly served by a myriad of wait staff. I liked that. The food was fresh and hot. \n\nMy appetizer was the crab chowder bowl. 'YUMMAROLLA!' This was a hearty bowl of chowder with a descent serving of crab meat. My main course was the open faced crab melt sandwich with garlic fries. Absolutely delicious! The bread was like a french bread so it was a bit tough and required a little extra chewing but the flavors were delightful. Tiramisu completed my dining experience and it was so very good! \n\nMy coworker ordered the pan seared salmon with Quinoa and she enjoyed her meal also. I tasted her salmon and it tasted fresh, light and flavorful! The bottom of the salmon had a nice crisped finish to it.\n\nI was well pleased with the Crabhouse. Very well pleased.

There's no real garlic (at least we couldn't taste any) or \"sauce\" (it was butter drippings). SHHHHHHHH!!!\n\nThe crabs tasted like there were dunked into a bucket of melted butter, plopped onto a sizzling iron platter and then served. Other than a mouthful of grease, there was no flavor and certainly no robust garlicky flavor to it.\n\nIf you think this will be the American version of PPQ's Roasted Crab, it's not. And, if you're use to PPQ's crab which is drenched in mouthwatering buttery garlicky goodness, I don't think you will not like the crab here. \n\n*GARLIC FRIES (Medium - $7.95): DELISH!\nSadly, this was the best thing out of all our dishes. The fries were fried to a golden brown and had a flakey cracker-like crispiness throughout. It was salty and well-seasoned, however, it could have used a lot MORE garlic. The fries were topped with garlic instead of being tossed with it so only the top layer had a garlicky flavor to it. \n\nS E R V I C E:  \nRUDE AND INATTENTIVE!\n\nIt must have been \"role-playing\" night on how to epitomize French snobbery (btw French restaurants exuding snobbery is a myth). With the exception of the bus boys, the entire waitstaff at CH was very cold and arrogant.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in, the hostess never greeted us and seem to have an issue when we wanted to move to a less cramped table. Mind you, there was only ONE other table in our section among a sea of other empty tables.\n\nOur waiter, Richard Blais look-alike (Top Chef - Season 4) was inattentive and had a very pompous attitude. After giving us our apps, he never checked on us. Every time he passed by our table, we would try to make eye contact but he turned a blind eye and ignored us. We had to call for his attention when we wanted to order, needed water and wanted to pay for our bill.\n\nOur water pitcher was moved to another table so we couldn't even \"self-serve\" our own water glasses without getting up. And, in his very little interaction with us, it was fake and contrived. \n\nI'm no stranger to working in the retail/service industry, so I know how tough it can be, but a simple \"smile\" can go a long way...something that should be reiterated by Management at their next staff meeting. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nCasual and slightly divey; reminiscent to a diner but w/ a ocean, boat and crustacean themed d\u00e9cor. The highlight of the restaurant is the picturesque view of the Pier especially on a bright sunny day.\n\nP A R K I N G:\nDifficult street parking, however, there's validated parking at the Pier 39 garage across the street.\n\n*1st hr free before 6 PM\n*2 hrs free after 6 PM\n*$7/hr thereafter (Thanks, Steve for being late! J/k!)\n\nFor visiting Yelpers looking for artery-clogging and bold, mouth-watering flavors to tantalize your taste buds, go to PPQ Dungeness Island (Outer Richmond) for their Roasted Crab and Garlic Noodles instead. It's is a little out of the way and the service can be iffy at times, but without a doubt you'll see one of the reasons WHY San Francisco is a Foodie's Gourmet Paradise!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We shared the crab chowder bowl, the Caesar salad and a whole crab. The crab was fresh and sweet. The chowder was loaded with veggies and potatoes, with the subtle flavor of bacon at the back and a good portion of fresh Dungeness crab. The Caesar was dressed perfectly and the dressing had just the right amount of tanginess. The whole crab, which was roasted in a garlic butter and white wine sauce, came to the table on a sizzling hot cast iron skillet . Very satisfying. It was a beautiful day and the windows were wide open to allow a fresh ocean breeze to waft in and the delicious smells of the food to waft out calling in passers by to join the party. The space was tight but we were seated immediately. Our server was courteous and attentive. The only down side was we didn't get our seafood forks until our meal was basically finished. At any rate, we made do and enjoyed ourselves immensely. I will be back to try the fish and chips.", "author": "A W."}

Interesting enough, unless you live in SF it's hard to find a good local crab spot that isn't crawling with tourists.  We were starving so decided to just brave the Wharf and give this place a shot.  The Crab House is a chain but I'd like to imagine that the SF one is extra special because...well, it's in SF!\n\nWe were seated right away and decided to order the \"lotsa crab\" to share.  It says it's 2 lbs. but like any other time you order seafood by the pound, it did not seem at all like it could possibly be 2 pounds.  Regardless, it was covered in this garlic butter sauce that sent us to the moon!  The crab meat was easily accessible with our nifty tools they gave us.  For 10 minutes we sat in silence as we worked away at getting the meat out and shoving it into our mouths as quickly as possible.\n\nIn addition to the crab, we ordered Cajun fries, which were good, but nothing special.  I also ordered a bloody mary and again, it was good but nothing special  The service was fast and friendly.  \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place, but be prepared - it is SPENDY.", "author": "Mandi L."}

Yelped this place thinking it was going to be really good. Got to this restaurant and it was pretty empty so got seated really fast. The crabs were their specialty so I was told I had to get that. The waiter sounded like he was in a hurry. He made his recommendations and left pretty quickly. He recommended I get the crabs and also the mussel and shrimp but I only ended up getting Crabs, Fries and a bowl of the crab chowder. He must've not been pleased at my order because throughout dinner he never came and checked up on our table. He would walk by and talk to the other tables but we were pretty much ignored. \n\nCrab Chowder - The chowder came amazingly fast after ordering which was a bad sign. It must've just came from a can or something because I just saw some crabs sprinkled on chowder that looked pretty old.\n\nBread - Came after my soup. How is that possible?? It was hard as a rock.\n\nCrabs - So this is their specialty. It looked amazing and while the crab itself was amazingly fresh.. the sauce was kind of gross. It was drenched in oil and had a weird taste. Definitely not garlic. I enjoyed the texture of the crabs but not the taste. I almost wished we just got steamed crabs. \n\nGarlic Fries - Probably the best thing that I ate here.\n\nThere were a TON of waiters/bus boys just standing around while we were waiting for our food. Kind of awkward. While leaving nobody bothered to even say a Thank you for coming. We caught the manager standing outside who did say it but man... the employees inside didn't give two shits. Our waiter was pretty terrible too. To add insult to injury this place charged a 4% mandatory fee which I totally don't think they deserve.\n\nI don't think this place was worth it. This is one of those places where Yelp really failed me. I would not be going back. The view was good of the golden gate but nothing else was worth it.", "author": "Jacob H."}

First...we were drawn in for the ambiance and the seafood cravings. When we first arrived, the host seated us right away with a beautiful view of the bay. WAIT FOR IT......10 minutes pass, 12 minutes pass, no one has greeted us or asked if we wanted something to drink. With a hungry family and getting irritated I got up at 15 minutes and went straight to whom seemed like management. Mind you that the restaurant had like 10 servers (more or less) with many open tables. When I told management that we haven't been served yet, a server interrupts us and says to me, \"I was on my way, you literally just sat down!\" (In a tone as if I'm bothering him). As I follow him back to my table, he asks me \"what do you need?\" (Again in an irritated voice) I replied, \"I need service, water for my family and food!\" (Now I'm very irritated that I'm about to drop money at this place for such terrible service). He takes our drink orders, brings it back with cold, hard bread and takes our order. I'm so disturb with our server that I told my husband I wasn't willing to spend at least $150 bucks on a meal with HORRIBLE SERVICE. We decided to get up and leave, as I approached the exit, our server standing at the bar staring me down (I'm positive he knew we were outta there) I approach another person who seemed to be management. I told her to cancel our order that we just placed because we were not staying because of the poor service. She asked why? I told her and left.

As we walked in, the hostess, who was reading a book, noticed us, put her book down and just stared at us.  No greeting, not even a warm hello was said.  We were seated in a 4 person table which was small and extremely close to the wall.  I went to ask the same hostess if we could change to a 6 person table.  She said (not in a nice way either) that we couldn't since we had only 3 people but we could sit at the booth.  I said that would be fine.  She responded with \"go ahead\" and walked away.\n\nWhy come here?  Great view of the bay down to Ghirardelli Square, fresh seafood, clean restaurant\nWhy NOT come here?

SURPRISE, there isn't any garlic!  Although the crabs were fresh and sweet, you might as well have been eating plain steamed crab.\n\nOTHER FOOD:\n*Garlic Steamed Clams (medium, $14.95) - Ok.  The clams were large and fresh.  The broth seemed like watered down clam juice and lacked garlic, therefore was missing the heavy garlic flavor.\n*Garlic Bread w/Cheese (2 pieces, $5.95) - Pass.  The GARLIC bread lacked a sufficient amount of garlic, the mozzarella cheese on top was too overwhelming, and the bread wasn't even hot when it came out\n*Garlic Fries (medium, $7.95) - Good!  The fries were thinly cut, extremely crispy, and had TONS of garlic sprinkled on top - just the way I like them.  \n\nSERVICE:\nThank you Thomas M. for providing HORRIBLE service!

Nestea at a restaurant where two people cost over $100 is a no-no. Cesar salad wasn't good, basic and dressing wasn't home made. Crab chowder was mostly potato. Also refills had to go through the bar so if I wanted more drink they had to order it from the bar and send it in a new cup. Do yourself a favor and walk 10 more minutes down the Embarcadero and go to Cioppinos. On an additional note my boyfriends cioppino was kinda sparse.", "author": "Nick B."}

We had a reservation for 3:30 but we didn't know there was a Giants game and so much traffic! We arrived at 4pm hoping to get a 30-45 min wait at least but he told us as soon as the rest of our party showed up we could be seated. I was go grateful because they were crowded like they usually are. And true to his word 15mim later when the rest of our party showed up we were seated! The service was great, food was delicious, prices were a bit high but that's to be expected at a place like this. It can get a bit stuffy in the summer months so cross your fingers you're seated next to a window, and fyi, they do open and the breeze and sea smell is a wonderful addition to your dining experience!

As it was we were hungry but not that hungry and it looks like they give you a lot, so we ended up splitting a caesar salad and cioppino.  Now I don't know if it was my hangover or what but it was the best caesar salad I've ever had!  Fresh and light, hit the spot.  We also split the small mixed seafood cioppino.  It had lobster, crab, mussels and calamari in a flavorful tomato based sauce, perfect to dip your sourdough bread in.

I would say alot of the fast food joints would offer better fries, which by the way should say alot. The crab came out. Decent amount of meat but unfortunately, the meat was very dry so the flavor was also lacking of their \"killer crabs\". \nHowever, crab chowder was excellent! The ingredients went well together. \n\nI would have to say I only came for the pier 39 experience. I was overall disappointed in the quality of the food. And not to mention, i was shy of the \"waterfront\" view. My biggest complaint: the stuffiness in the restaurant. I could barely breathe in that atmosphere. Stuffy and hot.

The majority white theme offset with some black contrast gives it a more classy feel. Don't feel compelled to have to \"dress up\". Remember a lot of tourist come through here and they of course would just be dressed casual.\n\nSo lets get down to business. The food. Check out their website for the actual menu and prices. The prices I feel were fair for the amount you get, quality, and overall dining experience.  We ordered double shrimp and crab. Shared within 2 people it was satisfying. We ordered a side of mix vegetables as well to compliment our main course. AND because there are those who are dying to know.. YES COMPLIMENTARY BREAD IS SERVED. \n\nThe food was great though. It's roasted on an iron skillet I believe. So its a different affair from just a steam pot type of crab place.. ala Joe's Crab Shack.

We were there right when they opened, so we got a table next to the window and my son was well entertained watching the boats.\n\nThe service was hit or miss - our server was slow to attend to us and seemed to check on us minimally. However, the bus boys were quick to clear the tables and get us what we needed.\n\nThe food was really great.  We started with a bowl of the Crab Clam Chowder, and my husband, son and I slurped up each last bit of it. The bread they serve to the table was great for dipping into the soup.  My Mixed Seafood Cioppino was fully loaded with tons of seafood.  Although I personally loved it, note that the tomato broth is very tomato-ey, if that makes sense.  I loved the spices in it too.  My husband had the Killer Crab, and that was the tastiest American-style crab in the shell that I've ever had.  I actually only had two small bites b/c my son couldn't get it fast enough from my husband!  My son's Mac N Cheese off the Children's Choices section was really tasty, although he forgot about it once Daddy gave him some crab.  The only thing I found disappointing was the coffee - $3.45 for a very average cup of Joe.\n\nWe can't wait to dine here again.", "author": "Tracy L."}

The chairs were literally pushed up against each other so it was hard to get out of your chair without hitting the persons chair in another party behind you. Service was a little slow but that may be because there was only one waitress for our section.\n\nThe food was pretty good, I was pleased with most of the dishes. We ordered the \"Lotsa crab\" which was good for 2 grown men to share and I liked the lemon-butter that came with the crab legs. The crab chowder was just ok, i think they put too much substance in it. The garlic fries were pretty delicious =) The chicken and chips was just your regular chicken strips and fries, nothing special. The crab cakes appetizer was a big whatevs. I've had better. The Butcher's Burger was just your average burger.\n\nI saw some table order the mussels platter which came out sizzling. Next time i'm definitely ordering that.\n\nLocation was really nice.

It has an amazing view of the Wharf area and Golden Gate Bridge. The staff are genuine, nice and knowledgeable about their menu. If I could I'd give the staff 4 stars (sorry I reserve 5 stars for fine dining). \n\nI think the food for the crab that is sizzling on the platters are fair priced. And that's the big draw here. However, I ordered the Garlic Noodles $10 with the additional $9.50 for Crab. $19.50 for an entree on Pier 39 seems fair. But the end product just really missed my expectation. What I had envisioned was a entree of thick, puffy, Savory PANCIT type noodles with the aroma of garlic that's been roasted at a high heat with good olive oil slathered on liberally. And visible pieces of crab in the entree on a Normal size pasta dish. \nThat isn't what I received. I was served what would look like a pasta dish, 1/2 Cup serving (that was okay) which appeared skimpy for an entree dish with so little crab. They say it's 2-3 ounces. But it's flaked and really not seen. \n\nAnyway, nice LOUD place with decent priced food for the wharf.", "author": "Rebekah B."}

We ordered the clam soup, main king crab but separated (I highly recommend the separated instead of whole as it's a LOT easier to eat), and garlic fries.  The clam soup was amazing, really light and almost-buttery like.  I could have eaten this all day-the spices were right on!  The crab then came, and **!!!  I never tasted a finer thing.  It's full of so much flavor, and you can tell they don't boil that thing-they bake it with the sauce!  Every bite was full of such goodness, and the garlic fries were a perfect side dish as well!  Definitely worth it!!  \n\nService here was also extremely friendly as all staff are really happy and recommend great things!  The lady we had was great as she was the one who suggested all our dishes and was so patient with us because we were so indecisive.\n\nThis was one of the best restaurants I went to so far ever in SF, and you must come here at least once when you visit Pier 39!

If you enjoy great seafood and don't mind getting your hands dirty, this is the place to go. \nWhen you walk in there is a rack on the right handside with a variety selection of hot sauce (and I love me some hot stuff).  My sister chose her demon and I chose mine. \n\nWe decided on the following:  \nAppetizer to share: Garlic prawns and mussels.  They were definitely delectable. \nEntree: 3lb crab to share. Now, mind you, I'm allergic to crab but will definitely go back with my allergy pills with me.\nOther entrees ordered were Chicken Fettuccine and the filet mignon for the non-seafood eaters.", "author": "Nerissa D."}

It can get crowded, so you may have to wait; don't worry, it's not tiny either, there's quite a few tables. Definitely go for a table near the windows if you can; you get a nice view of the bay with Alcatraz in the background.\n\n+Crab chowder: I've never had a crab chowder before, this was so good! Crab meat with a thin soup\n\n+Garlic fries: shoestring fries; delicious! Can't get enough of delicious fries!\n\n+Clams (might be the Clams Cioppino on the menu...my boyfriend ordered it as \"can we get the garlic clams?\" haha) - OMG the buttery garlic sauce is AMAZING! Too bad clams are so tiny...I could fill up on just these. We took the bread they gave us before our meal to mop up some of the garlic butter; it's that good!\n\n+1/2 crab -- yummmm! I liked the sauce on this crab as well; very well seasoned. You can also take the crab and dip it in the clam's butter garlic sauce. \n\nWhen you're done, you can walk it off along the pier!

In the restaurant, we got a table with a nice view of the harbor.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was a bit different from what I was expecting though.  It was a bit dirty and dive-y.\n\nService was excellent though.  Ordered a Crab Feast, shrimps and steamed clam.  The shrimp was okay.. a bit overdone for my liking.  The steamed clams were excellent.  They were in a white wine sauce.  The crab was spectacular as well.

I would suggest, though, that they stop serving the Mohitos.  Everyone thinks they know how to make them, yet rarely are they successful.  Crab House is no exception... Lime and soda water is not a good drink for $10.\n\nOverall, No different than any run-of-the-mill seafood place like Joe's Crab Shack. \n\nTo Crab House management...

This guy server was extremely rude and Ive never yeping before but seriously that rude service made me to do this.\n\nWe seated there and waited about 5 mins to order after recieving the water glasses, so we lightly waved hands to call him and guess what the server says. \"Oh my god why you guys are so hurry?\" With frowned face. When the foods came out, he was saying \"here you go, you hungry people.\" WHAT?... I was speechless. I thought he was just joking around until now. I remember when I came here about 2yeas ago, server tells us to take a photo of killer crab and took crab shells away and cut the legs right there, but he just went away after serving and when he came back, we asked him to cut and he was rolling his eyes, giving us pretentious smiles and saying \"I will, sir, I am\" lol... And he even cut the crab legs with the knife that was on the table which my bf was using... And didnt even bring the new one back.\nThe foods were soso. It cant be good with that kinds of service.\n\nAfter the meal, I accidently dropped the phone and since they have very very narrow gap between sofa and the wall, we had to lift up the sofa to take my phone out. My dad was even bending his waist trying to help him but the server shook head head, staring and pointing at my dad and saying \"Are you gonna do it or do you want me to do it?\" His voice this time was pretty loud so we had attention from all other tables. And guess what he said at last after taking my phone out, \"I will give you an advice, put your phone in your purse all the time\"\nOK. I WILL !!!!\nI was totally upset there and didnt even say thanks to him.\n\nI dont know why I tipped him that much.\nHe derserves zero tip.", "author": "Rina L."}

Dinner was at 6 and I was surprised the restaurant isn't packed. Tables are set closely together so maneuvering the car seat was definitely a challenge. \n\nIt was my treat yesterday since I knew that this place is his favorite but instead of ordering his favorite (crab legs), he ordered the calamari from the appetizer menu! Not sure if he meant to eat \"light\" because those damn calamari were deep fried, yo. I ordered crab cakes and the crab enchilada. I was torn between that and the crab omelet but was immediately sold after the server recommended it. \n\nI did not notice the pitcher of water... my babe poured me the first glass and refilled it shortly after I downed it. Awww, right? I know the task is nothing but it was the thought and the attentiveness that counts! \n\nThe crab cakes came out first and then our bread. The bread I did not care for because it was a tad hard/rough.. maybe it was left out longer than it should? Either ways, I only had a piece. The crab cakes were good but nothing to write home about; very crispy so that it did not have that flaky texture but full of crab, I must say. The medium order of calamari was huge. I can't comment on taste since I did not try it. How can I eat Squidward?! My crab enchilada was huge and it tastes very yummy... it was more packed w/ cheese instead of crab, I noticed but I did not mind. The sauce and the tortilla itself was good enough w/o the crab! I could have ate the whole thing but I took it home so that I would not be a fat ass. \n\nI would definitely come again. Service was quite awesome since the guy checked in on us several times. What was cool was that the table next to ours were from out of town so my babe told them his suggestions on what to order, talked about sports, and his motorcycle club. I knew he played hockey in the minors but never knew he lived in Toronto among other U.S. destinations. I knew he is committed to his bike club but never knew they are like family to him.

Although Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39 don't scream 'Romantic', the recommendations for the Crab House were spot on.  The dinner was in fact very sweet and the boardwalk provided a lot of entertainment and nostalgia.  \n\nThe staff sat us down promptly and we ordered two cups of crab chowder to start us off.  The chowder was the creamy and meaty - they did not skimp us out at all and the soup was rich with flavor.  Then we ordered a large crab plate to share between us.  We cracked away and quickly discovered this wasn't your average boiled crab - the sauce on it was incredible.  Garlic, sesame, butter? What else was in there? It was powerful stuff.  Simple, high quality ingredients.  Everything tasted fresh.  Classic food done right.\n\nI'm giving this place bonus points for the excellent service and the view as well.  My husband, being from England, said he had never seen a sea lion before.   As we ate our dinner, we saw a family of them swim by and bark.  I know, if you're from the West Coast this might be boring, but for him it was exciting, and even though I grew up watching sea lions I shared his joy in seeing something new.\n\nI would love to come back here on a visit to San Francisco.

My Mom heard about it via reviews and we had no arguments against it.\n\nMy parents and I love flavor. Love. But there is such a thing as too much salt. So, 1 star down for the food being a bit too salty. It's not too much of a problem if you keep drinking water. lol\n\nMy husband got the Chicken Alfredo, and I got the Crab Alfredo. Nice sized dishes. I couldn't eat it all and gave some to my Dad, who enjoyed it. The Alfredo sauce is a bit on the thinner side, which I didn't mind. But my husband prefers it to be on the thicker and more rich side. He said it still tasted great to him. The Crab Alfredo sauce was clearly made with \"crab butter\". (By the way, if you don't know what crab butter is...no need...just know that it's delicious.hahaha) Again, this added to the salt...but the noodles help offset it. I had plenty of chunks of crab in my dish, unlike another reviewer who said they only had bits of crab. I don't know. If that happens to you, my suggestion would be to talk to the manager? You're paying a higher price for your meal, you should be satisfied.\n\nMy Mom got the Crab Melt, which is an open faced sandwich. I'm pretty sure she said \"Mine isn't salty at all. It's GREAT!\" ...no less than 1 dozen times. Her sammich definitely LOOKED amazing. I'll tell you one thing I picked off her plate was the garlic fries. They were good (though pale in comparison to the Garlic Fries at AT&T Park). \n\nLastly, my Dad ordered from the Prix Fixe menu. He got the crab. The salad was standard, but it was big. He said that it was refreshing and helped with the saltiness of the crab. The crab was great. I had some...nice and meaty. It comes with a sauce for dipping...which is great with the bread. I would bet $500 that the \"sauce\" is actually dressed up crab butter...which is why it was so damn good.\n\nHad no issues with our server (a european guy).

It had good flavor, but a tad on the cold side. The bread that was given in the beginning of seating is pretty hard. The Lobster pasta with the butter sauce was delicious. There is a wonderful amount of lobster meat and the flavor was there. The crab angel hair lasagna was something I had to try. It was extremely comforting and very filling. It was a bit on the oily side, but still good while its hot. Overall, it was a pretty satisfying meal. \n\nSo the second time I returned I just had to try the giant crab. It's called The Crab House so of course I just had to get down and dirty with a juicy crab! I ordered the crab, garlic fries, mojitos, and bloody mary oyster shooters. It was even MORE SATISFYING than the first time I came here!!! I love food I can grab and dig in with my hands. There was intense flavors in the crab and the crab meat was soOo juicy!

We walked pass this restaurant and it was packed. Why not give it a try right? We came up and waited to be seated. Nice bay view, clean, and good atmosphere. We ordered garlic crab. It was so good. Got a good garlic flavor. The crab was huge even for two people. Expensive? Maybe. But you paid what you would have. The crab price around here is the same like $40 almost every restaurant. Why not pay for it and get good food and good spot right? We sat by the window, so we could see sea lions colony. We also ordered drinks which are melon mojito and blue Russian mojito. They were so so strong. It was good though. The bartender was nice and friendly. The staffs were outstanding. Great place for food while you're in pier 39. Must try!!", "author": "Manisa K."}

The crabs were huge compared to the ones in Texas. I was visiting San Francisco and came here twice because it was that GOOD! The place was packed! Wait time would have been over an hour if we didn't have reservations. So glad we made reservations 2 weeks before. We had 4 people in our group the first time and 6 people on the second time. The service was great, the waiters were very tentative. Everybody got plastic bibs and wet tissues to wipe our fingers. Get ready to be messy. Each times we got the crab feast and lotsa crab numerous times in one sitting. I honestly lost count how many we ordered. They roasted the crabs in this delicious garlic sauce. You can taste it through the shell. The meat was so hot, soft, fresh, and perfect. I like to dip it in butter or salt, pepper, and lemons. We also ordered a side of garlic fries and calamari. Perfect combination of food coma. The prices are steep, but I was on vacation and I didn't care. I'm drooling again. Let me just say this place is highly recommended!!!!

The Killer Crab, the star of the meal, did not disappoint. Man, it was so fresh and buttery flavored with garlic and herbs. It was absolutely amazing! I would recommend it all to you. I would say that each person in your party should get at least a pound each because its that good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-17", "description": "It's funny how if Pier 39 didn't exist, the SF locals wouldn't even notice. In the heart of San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, this pocket of shops, boutiques and restaurants is a tourist trap where out-of-towners flock to. You'll usually witness and experience some kind of sideshow - some dude covered in silver paint posing as a statue, people playing music, someone performing magic tricks, etc. All my SF friends have very strong negative feelings about this area. \n\nHowever, in this tourist haven, there's a little gem. That gem is Crab House. \n\nATMOSPHERE: It's what you expect from a seafood restaurant slash tourist trap. The walls are lined with fake crabs, fishing nets and lifesavers. Very loud and a little chaotic with a very diverse crowd. Crab House really packs the place with tables so there isn't much walking room. Talk about maximizing your space!\n\nSERVICE: Great! I read several reviews dogging their service, but I guess we were lucky. Our server was very accommodating. I don't really care if servers constantly ask how everything is going or refill my water when my glass is half empty. What I really care about is how quickly they can respond to my requests. That's where our server killed it. We asked for more napkins several times. She brought them over quickly. We wanted tartar sauce with our calamari. It was sitting on our table in less than a minute. My plate was dirty when I sat down so I asked for another. I was graced with a clean plate within a few seconds. She was SO awesome. Another thing that really impressed me was that we were obviously starving (me and four friends). She could have easily recommended that we order more food, but stopped us after she felt like we were going a little overboard. I really appreciate that at restaurants - the staff not trying to upsell you when it's not necessary. \n\nLARGE GARLIC FRIES ~ 3.5 stars ~ $9.95: It was a huge heaping of fries sitting on a long plate covered in butter, cheese and garlic. Though it was delicious, it's nothing special. But it did make a nice compliment to everything else. It was the perfect starch to go with the crab and calamari. \n\nFRIED CALAMARI ~ 4 stars ~ $19.95: Just like the garlic fries, this portion was pretty gigantic. It was enough for five of us to devour it and feel very satisfied. The calamari was fried perfectly with the right amount of crunch without the greasiness. Garnished with sliced peppers and jalepenos as well as lemon wedges and two cups of cocktail sauce, this was a hit. One of my favorite things about this app were the few slices of fried lemon slices. I love that sh*t! However, I will recommend asking for tartar sauce. It goes way better with the calamari than the cocktail sauce served with it. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=TnKEBMW0o4QWSnK8XH5sEw&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nCRAB FEAST ~ 4.5 stars ~ $110.00: Picture a large piping hot skillet topped off with three crabs, giving off aromas of garlic and butter. The steam floating off the dish carries the scent of crustacean heaven as it touches your nose. The menu states that the Crab Feast feeds up to four people, but the five of us were totally satisfied with the amount of food we got. The feast comes with all the legs and claws of three crabs. None of them are pre-cracked so you'll have to get down and dirty. Don't worry, they provide all the necessary tools you need to break the shells. The crab meat was tender, buttery and just straight up delicious. I think one of the best parts about eating crab is also the worst part. There's SO much work that goes into cracking and breaking the shells that you start to get really impatient, but if you crack your shells properly and carefully remove the meat, you're rewarded with a huge nugget of crab meat completely intact. Have you ever pulled a huge piece out of a claw? Staring at it as it's barely hanging onto your tiny fork? Holding it up to everyone at your table screaming \"Check this out!\"? That's when you know you've made it. At that moment you realize how much you love crab and why you don't eat it more often. \n\nThe food was great and so was the service. But I can't bring myself to give this place 5 stars, however, I think it's very deserving of 4. EXTREMELY deserving. If you can get past the touristy area and find your way to the second level of Pier 39, be sure to check out Crab House.\n\nJUST MAKE SURE TO PUT ON THE BIB THEY GIVE YOU!

The way they serve the sauteed crab on the stone plate is really different than most seafood restaurants I've been to (i.e. in big plastic bags).  As other people have noted -- it's greasy.  I mean as greasy as you can possibly get.  But I don't expect anything on the pier to be void of tons of greasy/fried goodness.  \n\nAs always, Pier 39 is flooded with people so, as I would expect, the restaurant was super, super crowded when we arrived at 4:30PM.  It was also Father's Day so I think that caused an influx of people on top of how popular it is already.  (For all the people from the South Bay, it's not as bad as Boiling Crab but it's pretty up there for a wait time.)  We were lucky and had made a reservation a few days beforehand.

The portions are large.\n\nThe crab feast for four is a fun time, but it appears that they just deep fried the crab and then finished it by sauteing in butter, which was a bummer because it really dried the meat out (especially for such a tender and delicate creature like the dungeness).  Oh well.  Also it appears the crab feast was just legs and the knuckle joint.  It would've been nice for variety to at least throw the heads on the platter. \n\nThe calamari was well seasoned but heavy on the breading.\n\nCocktails are cheap and simple, and they taste pretty good.  $10 Mojito is a steal for the city.", "author": "Mike L."}

There were two times where Sir Face needed refills on his diet coke, but got regular coke instead. The other items we got were; roasted crab for 2, medium garlic fries, crab chowder, crab cakes, and a strawberry mojito for myself. \n\nThe chowder came first, and quite honestly it wasn't anything special. Crab is one of my favorite things to eat, but this left me thinking that clam chowder is much better. The fries were really good... crab cakes are so so. The roasted crab was quite tasty, but I think I prefer it just steamed as I feel that it was slightly overcooked as the meat was a bit on the dry side. \n\nThe complimentary bread... I would have to say was crap; It seemed old. I do get that they're a busy place and all, but stale/old bread is never appetizing at a restaurant. I wasn't all that fond of the mojito, but Mr. Face said that if I didn't finish it, I'd have to drive home... so I downed it at the end of the meal. \n\nOh!

Very attentive, super friendly, quick service.  I felt like everyone who worked there truly wanted to make the customers happy and provide a satisfying dining experience.\n\nWe ordered the $100 platter -- enough for 4 to share, it says. It was pretty good, for four, I guess... considering we had a party of 6, and 2-3 people didn't really eat a lot of the crab... but since I'm a crab fanatic, I'm not gonna complain. More for me ^_^.\n\nBruschetta - way too overpriced in my opinion. two little pieces.. Typical bruschetta, nothing special to be honest.\n\nCalamari - large portion, not too salty, nicely battered... semi-typical. Nothing too special about this one either, but definitely nothing to complain about.\n\nLobster chowder - nice and creamy, not too heavy... flavor was pretty much perfect. The only thing was, it was only slightly warm... and I like my chowder HOTTTT! Not warm, not hot, but HOTTTT. (Yes, with 4 T's, and no, I will NOT settle for less).\n\nFish and chips - not your typical fast food / long john's over-battered oily fried fish. The outside was crumbly in a very good way, and the fish itself was soo juicy and tender. Yum. The \"chips\" part consists of garlic fries -- also made to absolute perfection. Best garlic fries I've ever had, and trust me, I'm pretty much a slut when it comes to garlic fries. (I mean, I've been around, and I've had plenty.)\n\nThe only reason I docked one star was because I think it was very high in price. The place isn't too fancy looking, and our bill came out to be about 220-250ish for 6. (Forgot exact amount). That's like a $40 meal per person!

I finally had some down time to explore the Bay so I headed off to Fisherman's Wharf.  Decided to stop in to the Crab House after glancing at their menu and was glad I did.  It was still fairly early in the evening, 5ish, so there wasn't a crowd when I was seated.  Service was quick and friendly.  I asked my server for suggestions and he happily obliged, noting the different menu options and answering my questions.\n\nThough I felt it was a requirement that I should order crab, I decided on the mixed seafood cioppino instead and was happy I did.  Generous portions of shrimp, fish, mussels, and crab stewed perfectly in a light tomato broth.  It was hearty but not heavy.  Nicely presented in a ceramic tureen.\n\nI was hoping, since I was a lone party, that I'd get a table with a nice view of the pier, and instead was seated in the middle of the restaurant.  It wasn't crowded so I could still see out the expansive windows, but if I were to come back here, that'd be one thing I'd request...a nice window seat.  Regardless, my table was comfortable, and the Crab House itself has an elevated casual vibe.  A few big groups (8+ people) started trickling while I was midway through my meal...and I was tempted to stay and order crab/shrimp/mussels after seeing them being served to the groups.\n\nGlad I made my way here before I left SF.

I also ordered some garlic fries, as I overheard someone saying they had come highly recommended.\n\nThe salad wasn't very fancy, but had a delicious, garlicky dressing; very tasty.  The fries really were awesome--crispy and covered with fresh garlic, parmesan, and parsley.  A small was a very generous size.\n\nThe crab was fresh Dungeness, served on a sizzling iron skillet.  At first, I was disappointed that more of the flavor of the sauce it had been tossed in didn't actually get to the meat, but there was plenty of it on the skillet to soak up.  Very tasty.\n\nThe absolute highlight of the meal, though, was the tiramisu.  It's not normally a dessert I would order for myself--just not my favorite--but since it came with the meal, I thought I'd give it a try.  Wow...SO good.  The cake was absolutely soaked in liquor and the coffee cream provided a light, tasty counterpoint.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the price.

I specifically made my bf drive out of the way after picking me up from the airport so we could find this restaurant and have crab just like I remembered. In my memory, I didn't even remember the name of this place. I only knew garlic dungeness kind crab at Fisherman's Wharf. So when we finally found it, I knew I had come home to heaven.\n\nThe prices are what you'd expect for seafood, but who really cares about price when we're talking about, and I'm really not exaggerating or hyping this place up, at least I'm not trying to, THE BEST CRAB I HAVE EVER HAD.\n\nWe ordered the crab and crab cakes as appetizer. $14 for two mini sized crab cakes by the way... so yeah, skip the crab cakes and save room for dungeness crab.\n\nI only rave on about food when it truly blows me away and this place. Oh my god. Just thinking about it makes me want to drive to JFK, hop on the first plane 3000 miles away to San Fran and chow down. The garlic butter taste was in every bite. \n\nLast tip- You're going to want to start with the legs on this bad boy. Because, trust me, the body of the crab is the most succulent and you really have to save it for last. \n\nAs touristy as the area is.. they really don't serve dungeness crab like this anywhere else.", "author": "Stephanie F."}

Our group of 42 found our ideal restaurant choice in the Fisherman's Wharf area. I worked with Cody, Manager (seemingly very helpful), to create a fixed $50 banquet menu, shared our RSVP headcount, and submitted the required written banquet reservation form 7 days prior to our group event, guaranteed with my credit card.  Cody emailed 7 days prior, \"Perfect, I have everything I need. Look forward to seeing you next Saturday.\"  \n\nLess than 24 hours before our reservation, on the way to our airport flight to SF, he calls to inform us that The Crab House unfortunately cannot honor the reservation due to capacity challenges (we would occupy 1/3 of the space on a Saturday afternoon).  Are you effing kidding???  What type of restaurant would ethically do this?  We already had an off peak hour reservation at 4:30, so I offered to shorten our meal duration from 120 minutes to 90 minutes and move it up to 4pm.  Or break us up into 3 groups for seating. They remained faintly apologetic but inflexible, only offering us walk-in status, not even on the reservation slate.  Nor did he offer to make any effort to arrange substitute reservations at their sister restaurants and placed blame upon being uninformed of the restaurant owner's \"new policy.\" They were obviously not willing to make exceptions through this policy to serve willing patrons through the transition.\n\nOur group of families ended up having a fast food dinner at the Ferry Building. Embarrassed by this disastrous dining situation, I would absolutely not recommend The Crab House to anyone and will encourage our group to anti-crusade against this and their associated establishments. Their level of unaccommodating, non-service to prospective patrons is absurd, shameful, and unjustifiable.

It's like they know you are spending some $$$ so they want to respect that..as it should be. Food also comes out almost immediately, I have never waited more than 10-15minutes for my food. Also great views of beautiful Golden Gate and SF Bay. \n\nHere's what you should know before you go. Be prepared to spend at least $50 per person here if you are ordering crab, this does not include alcohol, sides, drinks, or appetizers. The appetizers are not that much to rave about and I would say I have been disappointed a few times with the selections I have made as they tend to lack flavor, which is ironic because their seafood main dishes; crab, shrimp, mussels are popping with flavor.  Bruschetta is a usual, good, but not the greatest (it could be improved). As far as sides, it's lacking having only three choices and one being garlic fries, really?!?!  Also , this is a small small place and it is usually a tourist hotspot which means it gets crowded. Don't except to show and get seat it, you will be waiting. Best suggestion make reservations as they are quick at seating you and usually they have openings available. \n\nI have been patronizing this place since 2008 and I go three/four times a year.

I would have liked to wash the dry bread down with some water but I couldn't seem to get a refill in my tiny cocktail glass.\n\nWhen I asked for a tall glass of water, the bartender brought me one in a dirty glass.

Great seafood w/ generous portions...definitely enough to share. The fries were good but not great. Definitely not an item worth ordering again.

I tend to get a shocked reaction every time I tell people that I love this place too.  For one thing, being located right smack in the middle of Pier 39, Crab House is automatically perceived as the \"touristy restaurant\" that no local wants to eat at.  Fortunately, I have no shame!\n\nCONS - Yes, it can be difficult to find parking here because it is tourist central.  Prices are slightly higher than they should be because, again, yes - it is tourist central.\n\nHowever, the quality of their service and food really outshines everything else!  My favorite waiter is Rafet - who is literally one of the best waiters I've ever had.  For food, my default order is always 1/2 order of crabs and a side of garlic noodles.\n\nOn nights where I feel like being a total fatty, I'll order just one whole crab and eat it all by myself.  I would take their bread and dunk it into their sizzling hot, secret garlic butter sauce until there was nothing left...\n\nBasically - they are known for their crabs.

Five minutes later we see a couple that just checked in got seated at our table by a different host. WTH? My husband asked our host and he says our table is being set up and will be ready soon.

Otherwise I'm just staring at the water and some logs. \n\nTo start we ordered the iron skillet roasted mussels and it came out on a sizzling plate. Small mussels and okay flavor. Nothing explosive so that was a disappointment. The bread they served us was in a bag, cold and hard. No bueno. \n\nI also ordered the crab clam chowder and it was a full of stuff but a bit too bland. Like a party in my mouth without any flavor. \n\nWe ordered the \"Too Two Crab\" that feeds 2-3 people and my husband and I were only able to finish one. I must admit, the crabs were huge and the most meat on a dungeness crab that I have ever seen. It was suppose to be seasoned in with pan roasted garlic sauce but I wish I had some lemon and pepper to make my own sauce since the crabs were very plain in flavor.

It wasn't as good as the first time I had it but it was still good.  1 crab is more than enough to feed 2 people so keep that in mind.  I had the garlic noodle before and didn't think too much of it.  I regret ordering that.  I was imagining the linguini type.  The garlic fries were very good. It came out to around $50 for 2 people.

If you want clam chowder, this is probably the one place in Pier 39 you cannot get any--they have CRAB CHOWDER :)\n\nThe crab is great, and if you have someone to share with, order the portion that shares for two people to get the most bang for your buck. \n\nDuring our visit it seemed that the entire staff could have used a bit more training/experience.  The hostess claimed that she had called our name and we had missed it and had to wait more for our table (we were sitting directly behind her at the bar and were listening intently).  The bartender poured very messy--wine all over the outside of my wine glass -_-.\n\nAnyway, I do enjoy the food here but the place gets extremely crowded (some parties shared large tables).

I've been here before already and this most recent time, your hostess or supervisor, whoever she is, just had to tick me off. \n\nit was 1:30pm already, and it was going to be a late lunch. my girl asked for how long it would be for a table of 5, and the hostess said 40 MINUTES. ok fine, we'll wait (as i saw some empty tables already)\n\nand next thing you know, this GROUP of 8 people (obviously some european tourists) walk in after to ask how long the wait was for their group of 8. As that happened, I decided to easedrop see how long it was for them. CLEARLY, the hostess said it would only be 10 minutes for them. \n\nSo, I went ahead myself and asked how long the wait for 5. She quoted again about 40 minutes. So, I asked why is it only 10 minutes for them when they're a table of 8 and it's 40 minutes for a party of 5. IT MADE NO SENSE. The hostess had the guts to say \"Oh it's because we would put two small tables together to make one table for them since they have 8\" and so you wouldnt do that for a smaller party? it literally makes NO SENSE. If they were willing to do that for them, they wouldnt just give us a small table to fit 5? that is the dumbest EXCUSE i've ever heard. goodjob trying not to bust yourself out. \n\nit was obvious that they were willing to go out of their way for some european tourists that look like big money spenders while leaving me and my party aside just because we were some locals or whatever. \n\nyou know what's even better? i LEFT and went to a better restaurant that had BETTER service instead of dealing with your crap.", "author": "Kenny L."}

I want to start by saying, that in the past this has been one of our favorite places to dine in the city.  I would have given it a pass if it wasn't for the following events.\n\nMy husband and I had dinner a little over a weak ago.  We came into the city on a Saturday night for reservations at 5:30.  When we first arrived I was surprised at the lack of customers, the place was almost empty.  We were seated and after some time our order was taken.  A couple was seated next to us about 15 min after we arrived.  We watched as the couple finally left after 10 minutes of waiting and no one came to help them or ask if they needed assistance.  Considering the place was almost empty and the staff was standing around I felt this was completely unacceptable.  So, to go on the food was terrible, the garlic noodles where NOT cooked and had no flavor and the crab was dry and bland.  As we left I asked to speak to the manager, after waiting about 10 minutes we finally left.\n\nNow this is what I have the biggest issue with.  The next day I get a email from the manager saying how sorry he was and what could he do to assist me.  WOW I thought maybe it was just a bad night and a one time thing.  I immediately emailed back all my concerns and I am STILL waiting.  No additional email no call no NOTHING.  I assume they have a new manager and maybe even a new cook, but that is no excuse for reaching out to a concerned customer and then never follow up.  I could have over looked the staff, the food, and the lack of organization.  I can not over look going out of your way to try and fix a problem and then not caring once you find out what the problem is.\n\nI gave it a week still no response so now I am writing my review.

We also had their garlic fries which was pretty nice and their garlic pasta which was not bad, not too garlicky, for some carbs to go with your seafood. I like that they provide us with this plastic bib to wear just in case of any 'flying accidents\"- I'm sure you still want to step out of the crab house still looking fabulous!\n\nTruth be told, I've tasted much better crabs.. if you think this is the best crabs you've ever had, you gotta try the chilli or the black pepper crabs in Singapore (they use Sri Lanka crabs) They are still the very best- you taste the sweetness of the crab meat while the black pepper sauce gives you the kick. \n\nI'll give 5stars for their clams and just 3 stars for their dungeon crabs.

I wish I could prepare crab as decadent as Crab House!  \n\nI also thoroughly enjoyed the crab chowder.  It's a thick base, with big chunks of fresh crab and vegetables.  A bowl is easily shared by two people.  Their garlic bread with melted mozzarella is delicious.  I just wish that for the price, you got a little more than just 4 slices.  \n\nMy only gripe has to do with the service.  First, we had to ask for bread several times before we got it.  Second, it took THREE different people to give our table individual sides of melted butter to dip our crab meat in.  First we got this bowl of who-knows-what sauce. so we asked someone else  Then, we got a bowl of melted butter to share amongst four people.

I loved the crabs that decorated the perimeter of the restaurant, each crab possessing a fun and unique costume...I'm talking taxi crabs, technologicrabs, you get the picture. \n\nTo be different than the normal clam chowder, we ordered crab chowder ($6.95 cup, $9.95 bowl). It had chunks of vegetables but not too much crab in my opinion. The soup was also watery. I used most of my complimentary mini-baguette to soak up the liquids.  I packed the extra baguette in my purse. \n\nThe soup was the only crab we got at the Crab House....I know, weird.  We also ordered garlic bread with mozzarella ($6.95), garlic noodles ($9.95), and a child's macaroni and cheese ($6.95). The garlic bread was only 4 pieces of bread (2 slices of baguette cut in half!) with cheese on top. The cheese was rubbery and didn't taste too much garlic. Plus it was a rip-off. On the other hand, the garlic noodles had tons of flavor. I have a thing for garlic noodles.  Slurppppp.\n\nI also have a thing for macaroni and cheese. What's interesting is that their mac 'n cheese doesn't use macaroni, but fettuccine noodles. Shouldn't you call it fettuccine and cheese?  The sauce was cheesy and thick, but pairing it with those long flat noodles doesn't feel right to eat it like that.  I have standards.\n\nThe best part of my meal was the pineapple mojito ($9.00). Probably one of the best I've ever had! I had to get two of them.  I probably would have ordered two even if they were horrible. \n\nI don't think I'll go back to the Crab House again for food. I can cross it off my list. If the crab chowder isn't to die for then I should be eating my crab somewhere else. But for a mojito.....I might reconsider....", "author": "Tiffany C."}

I would assume the best, and cheapest way to eat crab legs or any kind of good seafood is to hit the places down the block from Pier 39, on Fisherman's Wharf.  Eat fresh steamed crab and fresh fried calamari while standing at a bar counter on the street.  Yes, to me that seems authentic.  A place where tourists flock, and restaurants hand out happy hour coupons?  No thanks.\n\nAll that being said, one Saturday evening, I happened to not be working and my wife happened to be craving crab legs.  The weather was nice (hot in San Jose means perfect in San Francisco) and we had nothing better to do, so we showered and hopped in the car on the way to SF.  I made reservations beforehand, which was a very smart idea, and we fought a little traffic on Embarcadero and it took forever to park, but finally we made it.\n\nMy reso was for 6:45 and right around that time is when I got in line to put my name in / check in.  Luckily he called my name despite the fact that I hadn't checked in, and we skipped the line and got seated.  They have one room with tables against a window overlooking the bay, and another room with a big open air window against the pier.  Luckily we got the former and had a great view of ferry boats coming and going.\n\nOur waiter was quick and they got water for everyone.  Drinks and apps came out super fast, like 3-4 mins after we ordered them, and the main dishes followed very quickly as well.  My wife loved the crab, and I got the filet, which I was skeptical on, but must say I was surprisingly overwhelmed at how good it was.  It was actually very top notch - One of the better steaks I've had, period.  Like, way better than a chain, and almost as good as a steakhouse.  I did not expect that AT ALL!  I would even go as far as to recommend trying it here even if you are not coming for steak.\n\nAlso, another excellent dish was the garlic noodles.  After doing further research afterward, I guess crab and garlic noodles is a hidden San Francisco treat in other areas.  These guys do their noodles a little different - It is fettuccine with very light alfredo sauce and lots of garlic flavor and some cheese.  They were, however, fantastic.  So good that I am actually considering going back, just for the noodles and the awesome steak.  I am surprised at myself for saying this!\n\nIn the long run, it was a little pricey, very rushed (as with any place that is on Pier 39, the servers only make money if you hurry up so they can flip your table - we call it 'turn & burn' ;) ) and it was a little cramped and loud.  But it hit the spot for the wife (good) and I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good my non-seafood was (better) and I would even consider coming back again (best).", "author": "Robert K."}

So we were stuck eating in the bar area sitting on stools on Christmas Day.\n\nOverall, the food is overpriced and over-spiced with garlic. It tastes good, not great. The service was just OK, perhaps because the waiter wasn't thrilled to see 25 people all wanting to order food on seperate checks. \n\nThe hostess wasn't glad to see us when we arirved, becuase she knew nothing of the event, and the place is crammed full of tourists. There are so many better seafood restaurants in San Francisco than this one. And the meetup organizer, who is promoting her dating web site, should have done a much better job, including finding a better place where we could actually be seated for a real dinner.\n\nHere's the worst part. On a rainy night, they have no check room, no coat hooks, no coat rack, NOTHING. They do not offer to put your coat into the closet reserved for the employees coats and purses. You are expected to take your coat to your table. But we didn't have a table.\n\nIf you are sitting at a bar stool in a busy bar area around the firepit, where there are no purse hooks or coat hooks, and wearing a cashmere full length overcoat, there is simply no place to put your coat except on the dirty filthy floor. Likewise, no place for an umbrella either. And it does rain in the winter in San Francisco. Sometimes a lot. For days.\n\nSo I hung my nice coat from the tiled seperation wall nearby. When I looked over, someone unknown had folded my coat and placed it on top of a parked baby stroller. Apparently, they have no room for strollers eaither.\n\nWhen it came time to leave, my coat was gone. SOMEONE HAD STOLEN MY CASHMERE OVERCOAT ON CHRISTMAS DAY!! From a restaurant that charges $35 for a whole crab and $20 for a bowl of Garlic Noodles with a tablespoon of crab in it. This place is not cheap!\n\nAnd the management didn't give a damn. They could not have cared less. Now in my view, they were negliegent in not having a place to store coats and in not having a sign prominently posted saying they were not responsible for stolen property. That issue will be for the small clamis court to resolve, although I will send them a demand letter to see if they pay up. I was able to buy a replacement on sale at Jos. A. Bank for about $285.\n\nSo, if you are a tourist coming to San Francisco and have never had dungeness Crab, maybe go. It is easy to find on Pier 39. But if you live here, go elsewhere, where your patronage is appreciated.\n\nAnd by all means, WATCH YOUR BELONGINGS LIKE A HAWK, THE PLACE IS FREQUENTED BY THIEVES.", "author": "Norm G."}

After walking around and decided to come to Crab House because the aroma from the food brought us back. We walked in and there was a little crowd going on. It was little busy too. The host asked us how many people and that there would be a 5 minute wait. Not a long wait so we waited. Less than 5 minutes later we were taken to our table. The dining area was a little tight, but can't complain. I was eyeing the Prix Fixe Menu. You get a salad, entree, and a dessert for $34.99. Good deal and crab chowder. And my other party got iron skillet shrimp & crab and Chicken Alfredo. Sounds like a good enough meal for party of three. \n\nSo as we were waiting for our food, every time the server would come by I get excited and thought that it was ours. I was pretty hungry I might add. Anyways, the crab chowder came out and it was ok. After we were done with the chowder our main orders are coming out...but it wasn't my order. It was only the iron skillet shrimp and crab that came out. I was a little sad that my food didn't come out the same time. You know the feeling when you're waiting and waiting it's not your turn? That's how I felt. So anyways, the skillet roasted looks and tasted awesome. Yeah, I know my food hasn't come out yet. They offer so I accepted. After a few shrimps in, my food finally came out and it smells so good. I knew it taste better...and it did. It was better than the iron skillet because it was roasted with their special garlic sauce. Oh...the pasta came too. It wasn't my order so I'm not too concern about it. Devour the crabs and I polished off the pasta. It wasn't great. It's not their expertise so I'm not going to hold it against them. Oh, I got a coke and got refilled three times without noticing it. So the service was pretty awesome.\n\nMy experience at Crab House is good and giving it a 4-star and it's a little pricey, but good food and service. Definitely coming back in I'm here next time.", "author": "Cheng S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-18", "description": "Pretty good place to eat if you want better food around the Pier, but a bit more expensive than other restaurants.  The seafood was fresh and delicious.  The entrees are also very tasty, sandwiches were huge but pasta dishes are smaller sized.  Crab chowder was light, fresh, and delicious.  The garlic fries are very good.  Complimentary bread with oil and vinegar was decent.  Ask for a table with a view and you can see the harbor and city.  \n\nCrab chowder - Very fresh and light not a whole lot of crab, but still very tasty.  Plenty of potatoes and veggies inside the chowder (almost like a sant\u00e9 fe style), I would have liked the chowder to be a little more creamy.  Not bad overall.  Order a bowl and you can share with 3-4 people for a small tasting.  \n\nCombo of grilled mussels, shrimp, and crab legs - Great fresh and sweet mussels, although they were a tad small.  Shrimp was grilled perfect with a hint of garlic butter.  The crab was good, fresh sweet Dungeness crab legs.  The order came with about 2 dozen mussels, 1 dozen shrimp, and half a crab.  The seafood was all fresh and delicious, but a tad on the pricey side.\n\nFishwich - This sandwich is absolutely gigantic!  Good quality beer battered fish and fried to perfection.  It's served on toasted garlic bread with a few slices of romaine lettuce and Caesar dressing.   The garlic fries on the side were amazing!  Nice crispy fries with plenty of garlic and parmesan topping.\n\nCrab angel hair lasagna - Definitely something unique I have not tried, and it was tasty.  Lump crab meat grilled and topped with cheese and scallions served on a bed of creamy angel hair pasta.  It was rich, creamy, and delicious!  The angel hair pasta was a tad overcooked and clumpy.  Portion was a little small, and for $17 I thought it was a tad pricey.  Not a bad entree, definitely tasty, but a small portion.\n\nService was excellent, but then again only  1/2 the restaurant was filled, so I expected better service.  The waiter constantly checked up on us to make sure our food was okay.  Prices are a tad expensive, but it's Pier 39.  The restaurant has a decent view of the harbor and city.  Overall, solid 4 stars, I'd come back if I was in town.", "author": "Terence N."}

Compared to the other reviews, I'm hoping that my friends and I simply had a bad experience. As for the food, the fish sandwich and garlic fries were very good. However, we ordered the $100 plate of Dungeness crab and weren't that impressed. It was slightly overcooked and covered in seasoning. The garlic butter they served with it was not good and we had to ask for plain butter sauce. I have paid less for better crab at other places along the coast.\n\nAs for the service, we had been hearing about this place all weekend and stopped in around 9:30 after doing other touristy things. When I walked in to meet my friends, the waiters standing around at the bar were complaining about how they were clearly never going to close and were annoyed that they were still getting customers. Needless to say, our waiter could have cared less that we were there. Every time we asked for something, like water, or a napkin, he would say he would be right back and never returned. We had to ask the bus-boys that were walking around for service because it seemed as if the waiter was ignoring us. We were also upset then that their was an included 17% gratuity that nonetheless gave our horrible waiter a huge tip that should have gone to the bus boys who actually serviced us.", "author": "Taralyn R."}

Anyways...\n\nI came here with my girlfriend after a day in San Francisco, thinking this would be a great way to end a beautiful day in the city. Upon arrival, we had to wait for seating as expected. During this wait, we overheard an employee make a racist joke to the hostess referring to one of the customers. I was a little shocked to hear this, and even more shocked to see that they would make jokes like that within earshot of their customers at the entrance. My girlfriend and I exchanged a shocked look with each other in disbelief, but we shrugged it off and proceeded to be seated.\n\nWhen we were seated, our waiter Carlos got us water and went through the usual menu overview. It was then that my girlfriend noticed that he was chewing gum. She called him out on it and he asked if it was a problem. My girlfriend went silent in a bit of shock that he even questioned the appropriateness of a waiter chewing gum. He left, and proceeded to chew gum the rest of the night.\n\nThese two incidents left an overwhelming mar on the entire evening, but the food was still quite good and well priced. We ordered 3 lbs of crab for $55, an excellent price for crab--especially at the tourist epicenter of San Francisco.\n\nOverall this would have been a great dinner, unfortunately the staff were unacceptably rude. Given the tourist traffic, I feel that even an overwhelming flood of negative reviews would hardly impact this restaurant, but I know I will not be coming back here.", "author": "Matt R."}

This time it's thanks to visitors who was staying at a hotel in that part of the city and asked me to join them for dinner.  While walking along Fisherman's Wharf and then reaching Pier 39, we decided this is where we will dine.\n\nHere, as the restaurant's name tells us, it's all about the crab. :)  There were three of us adults so we ordered the multiple crab option that, on the menu, was listed as being good for two to three people.  That one was just the right amount for the three of us.  They brought along two little boys, so in addition two fish and chips were ordered (which I cannot comment about).\n\nThe crab itself is good, but \"their famous\" sauce was lacking in my opinion.  In fact to me there was no actual sauce, though there was flavoring on the shell.  I guess I'm comparing this to the place I went to about a month ago in which there was actual sauce to dip the crab meat into and which I personally felt was most tastier.\n\nOtherwise, it's a good experience here, with a nice view out the window looking towards the Golden Gate Bridge.", "author": "H K."}

I understand they're busy but were spending A LOT on this meal for my parents and we wanted to treat them to a nice meal but this place totally ruined it for us. The floors had little shell parts and napkins on the ground and was just filthy. We started off the night with the host calling us for a table only for him to give him five more minutes after we reached him. The waiter who filled our water cups filled it to the brim in an impatient manner and walked away in a hurry. The waiter who finally took our order couldn't get his machine to work and ended up opening his pad to write down our orders with bills almost falling out of it. Very unprofessional of a business with rude staff members who I understand are busy but shouldn't take more customers than they can handle.

She said 10 years and during those 10 years I didn't even know this place existed! But I am glad I found this place because this is one of the better restaurants near the pier. Excellent service, excellent food, and excellent atmosphere. Crab House has mastered the system of quick service. I ordered a Sprite but I wanted to change my order. The servers has a handheld device that takes your order and sends it to the bar or kitchen depending on what you order. As I wait for her to finish taking an order at another table my Sprite already came! Within minutes!  And after we ordered crab our crab came out within minutes too! Don't worry though cause our server didn't just ignore us the rest of the night since they work as a team in getting food/drinks out. She came back to check on us regularly making sure we have everything we needed. The crab here is delicious!  We ordered Lotsa crab and it was perfect for two.  It's around 3+ pounds so there is plenty. They serve it on a hot plate and it's sizzling so be careful. Their garlic sauce is one of a kind making it a great mixture with the crab. Here is a tip for you. After you get the meat out of the shell, run the meat across the hot plate for the garlic sauce.

Obviously, every restaurant in that area specializes in seafood, but I specifically wanted some good steamed crab before I have to go home where I'm landlocked. We decided that a place called Crab House would probably be a good choice, come to find out there was only one real option for crab there. We ordered a crab chowder bread bowl which was mediocre--not super flavorful at all--and also some garlic bread to start, which was decent but burnt around the edges. My girlfriend ordered the angel hair lasagna which came out burnt and also dripping in oil, disgusting. I got the half order of crab and that too came out dripping in oil, I peeled off some of the drenched pieces hanging off the leg and pulled some meat out only to chew on the most rubbery piece of crab I've ever tasted. It was awful and we barely got two or three bites in before we tapped out for fear of food poisoning or just generally getting sick.

The fish I believe they used was cod, not the normal white fish at other places. Wasn't overdone with the batter, but I wish the fish was more crispy.

Considering a lot of places are closed today, i am glad they are open during the holidays.  Yes, this is a tourist spot... while waiting English may not be the mother tongue for 90% of the folks waiting for a table.  Of course, we are a tourist ourselves from L.A. so we blend in to the crowd quite nicely.  :-)\n\nFor my husband and I, we ordered:\nCrab cake -- lots and lots of crab meat!  One of the best that I had ever tasted!  But then of course, it does cost $14.95...\nCrab chowder -- good flavor.  For only $3 more, I recommend the bowl ($9.95) over the cup ($6.95).  You get twice as much.\nWhole Killer Crab $31.95 -- It is a big crab (it said 2+ lbs on the menu).  Price is by each instead of by pound.  Their secret garlic sauce adds just enough flavor to it without destroying the fresh crab taste.  One thing that I wonder, however, is that the crab shell (the \"back\"?  I am talking about the largest shell that covers up the crab body) is completely scraped clean... why?  I started to wonder if they keep reusing the same shell for decor, as I see the waiters are quite eager to take that shell away\nMelon mojito $8.95 -- again decent but not awesome.\nCoffee\n\nThe bread that is offered upfront is cold.  I'd much prefer if they just heat it up a little bit.  Total tab is a tad over $80 for the two of us.  \n\n5-stars on the pier view, 3.5 stars on the food, 4 stars on service.

Fortunately we didn't feel that way walking out!  The four of us shared:\n\n- CAESAR SALAD WITH CRAB:  Loaded with generous amounts of crab!   The dressing was a very mild version of Caesar, but after a couple bites I realized that was good so as not to overwhelm the sweetness of the crab.  A great choice for something lighter.\n- DOUBLE MUSSELS DOUBLE CRAB:   This was 24 mussels plus 1 whole roasted crab.  The crab was slightly overcooked and thus a little dry in some areas, but the mussels were good, and I really liked the lemon butter dipping sauce.\n- WHOLE KILLER CRAB:  We were hungry and ordered an extra crab so that we'd get 1/2 a crab each.   Maybe a bit too much food for lunch, but would be about right for dinner.  Same problem as the other crab in that it was slightly over-roasted, but still delicious.\n- GARLIC FRIES:  Very solid rendition.\n- GARLIC NOODLES:   Not like the Asian-style garlic noodles proliferating all over the Bay Area, but instead light fettucine noodles tossed with garlic, parmesan & herbs.   Tasty but I prefer Asian-style a little more.\n\nWhile our meal was on the pricey side ($150 for lunch for 4), we enjoyed it quite a bit and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others who are in the area.

For $50 it was a pretty good deal and the food was pretty tasty.  Nothing too special in regards to how it was cooked but both the crab and mussels were fresh/meaty.

One of the best I've had in a long time.\n\nA tureen of Zuppa Di Pesce (mixed seafood stew) was very good. Very hot and tasty, filled with seafood.

Nicely browned on both sides and good flavor.\n\nGarlic Crab (killer crab) - was pretty good. The garlic on the crab was flavorful and the crab itself was juicy and tender. Definitely not as good as PPQ or Crustaceans, but not bad.\n\nCrab House has decent stuff, the only caveat is that their prices is your basic tourist beast - i.e. high.

The restaurant's very crowded; we got in nice and cozy with the table behind us.\n\nCrab feast - apparently the crab legs & small piece of the knuckle are drenched in garlic butter sauce & baked on a cast iron griddle. The knuckle meat (normally one of the juiciest, tenderest parts of dungeness) was dry and crusty. The leg meat was acceptable, but not enough to make up for ruining one of the best parts of a great creature. There was plenty of crab for $110 though - the five of us had to pack up some leftovers. Our waitress provided us with plenty of napkins & moist towelettes, which came in handy.\n\nThey're getting an extra star for the cioppino - a San Francisco classic and a must-have for any tourist. The large was a huge tureen full of mussles, calamari, octopus, shrimp, and other such delicious seafood, covered with a very flavorful stew. For $50, there was enough for each of us to have seconds, and some even had thirds.\n\nThe restaurant is cute, the service was excellent - our waitress patiently explained the cioppino sizes to us and they immediately swapped out the shell bowl just as it was getting full. The crab would be infinitely better if they boiled or steamed instead, then served with a garlic butter dipping sauce.

I haven't been to Pier 39 in a while, but not much has changed: it's still mostly tourists & still haunted by *that* annoying, boisterous group of teenagers using language that makes you want to wash their mouths out with soap. \n\nWe arrived 20 minutes before our reservation time but were seated almost immediately & then promptly had \"Crab House\" bibs tied around our necks. So, I COULD have worn white today! *sulks for 2 minutes*\n\nWe ordered:\n- garlic fries app: crunchy & sprinkled with garlic. Garlic flavor did not assault your mouth, mild enough to be enjoyed by everyone.\n- fried artichoke app: anything fried is usually a crowd pleaser. Plus, artichokes are my favorite thing to eat when I'm out. Dipping sauce was thick & tangy.\n- (me) iron skillet-roasted double shrimp & double crab- 24 shrimp & a whole crab. Big enough for two people. \n- (bf) filet mignon (his commented that it was kind of plain, not the place for a steak, I guess)\n- (bday boy) lotsa crab- 3 lbs of dungeness crab in a garlic sauce\n- (his lovely lady) iron skillet roasted shrimp & calamari\n- a complimentary tiramisu (complete with candles) was brought out for the bday boy\n\nTotal: $210 (not including tip)\n\nService was great. My friend's soda came out while our waiter was still standing at our table taking orders-5 stars for his handy dandy computerized order inputer! He & his bus boys checked on us often. \n\nThe Crab House is one of the better restaurants at Pier 39 for seafood. But their sister restaurants (Boboquivari & The Stinking Rose) are even better places for crab because the garlic sauce flavor is more prominent at those restaurants. \n\nGood place to bring out of towners for a crab feast.\n\nP.S.

The muscles were mushy, nothing on the platter tasted good at all. (Although the clam chowder we also ordered was good. Thank god we ordered that or the dinner would have been a total zero.) I was SO disappointed. This literally had been one of the Top 5 meals I had ever had in my life -- I mean I joined yelp just so I could rave about it -- and it was really bad. I guess even worse because I had been looking so forward to it. I actually wound up apologizing for bringing us there and hyping it up, especially because it was expensive too.

My mother told me that I shouldn't waste my time here and the food was just okay (she said you can find way better seafood joints elsewhere). However I have to disagree with my mom on this one!\n\nCrab Chowder: probably the only thing I did not like about this place. I guess I was expecting your traditional clam chowder but with crab in it instead and that was not at all how it was. Same cream base but there was chunks of corn in it and big chunks of veggies. I'm not a huge chunky chowder fan so if you are you might enjoy it.\n\nGarlic Bread: Pretty good. I wouldn't say it was excellent but it was pretty good\n\nIron Skillet Combo: Crab, Mussels, and Shrimp: now this is why I gave it 4 stars. If you come to the crab house and get anything but the crab you are insane.  They have an Iron skillet combo that is too die for. The crab was sooo delicious and the shrimp was amazing. Plus they bring it out on this Huge Cast Iron Skillet and the flavor from it is exceptional. After we were done devouring our food we used the bread to slurp up the juices! and dark bits that were stuck onto the skillet delicous!\n\nOH i forgot one last thing! Giant pitcher of beer!

I thought the crab had so much garlic butter, you couldn't taste the sweet, delicate taste of simple crab.  If I wanted garlic butter, I could have had that somewhere else.

The romaine salad had such big of pieces, you had to cut each lettuce piece to eat, there was some super small tomatoes on it, nothing else, and the vinarette dressing tasted just like vinegar only.  The garlic noodles were gross, orange grease and they were still very dry.  The only good thing, the service was good and they gave you unlimited sourdough bread.

If you are an Asian, don't bother going there if you don't want a shitty meal. In my understanding, the reservations of the restaurant worthy nothing. If you make a reservation, and you arrive on time, they still let you wait, as they won't keep a table for you. What they do is to just let you wait until whenever there are some other guests leave. I wish I could rate 0 star. One star is just too good for the restaurant.  This is the second time I've been here. We had a reservation for a party of four at 5p.m. All four of us arrived at 5 tight, while one of us was parking the vehicle. They just told us they didn't have the table ready for us, and we have to wait till other guests leave. We acquiesced such unreasonable treatment as we knew it was a busy establishment. After about 10mins, they told us the table was ready but we had to wait until the person who was parking the vehicle come here to sit, or they would just release the table to others. We were in grave hurry as we had the had-earned Alcatraz night tour 1 hour afterwards. We told them the other person was just trying hard to find a parking spot and we could order for him first. But they just wouldn't listen. We still can't figure out why they tried so hard to discomfort us. As a host, she didn't have the proper attitude to her customers, rather, she talked in a curiously rude manner. We felt so hurt and would never come again. Besides, after finally having he meal, we all had a serious diarrhea.", "author": "Merlin L."}

I felt like we were kind of a needy table having to constantly ask for things like an extra fork , napkins, lemon, and band aids, not to mention I spilled water all over. When ordering he offered other options that might work for us better which is ALWAYS appreciated. He smiled through it all.\n\nThe food was good. We had a crab fondue, clams, and some crab legs, along with a salad and desert. I did love the salad and desert. I would have to say my favorite thing was the fondue because how can you go wrong with cheese? The crab was good but not amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-23", "description": "Came here this past Monday for lunch with my brother and my fiance. I made a reservation through open table since I read a few reviews suggesting to make one. We showed up a little after 12 pm. Since the restaurant still had plenty of seats left and we did dine here on a Monday, a reservation probably wasn't necessary for us.\nWe were seated right away and greeted by our server less than 30 seconds later. The server uses some kind of palm pilot thing to take down our order and so as soon as my brother asked for a soda, literally 1 second later, this other guy comes and gives it to him, so pretty quick service here (2 thumbs up just for that).\nAnyways, we ordered a medium order of mussels & shrimp, lotsa crab, medium order of garlic fries and I added a Caesar salad for myself because I wanted some fiber in this meal.\nWe didn't wait too long for my salad to be brought out, along with the mussels & shrimp. Then probably 5 minutes or less later came out the crab. So our server helped us don on our big plastic white bibs so we could all dig in. Our thoughts on the food:\n\nCaesar Salad- total disappointment (yes I know you don't go to a place that specializes in crab and order a salad, but let me tell you why before you get all crazy on me)! All it was was a plate of lettuce plated on a long skinny plate with some cheese and croutons. I don't understand why expensive restaurants always serve these type of lousy salads, but whatever... not worth the $9.95. Oh and the lettuce that is used has so little fiber content, so it was like I didn't have any fiber at this meal.\n\nMussels & Shrimp- The mussels were nice and fresh. Easy to get the meat out of the shell. Liked that the flavors were nice and light. The mussel itself was lightly steamed, so wasn't tough at all. However, the shrimp was a major disappointment. All 3 of us didn't care for the seasoning on the shrimp and definitely had better else where. Could easily do w/o the shrimp. \n\nLotsa Crab- The menu says that this is good for 2 people and I would have to agree. Although there were 3 of us, I didn't eat that much crab (I honestly don't like doing all the work that is involved in savoring these sweet tasty pieces) so this would be good for 2 crab loving people. The crab was nicely cooked. I think it was probably steamed and then dry roasted. It had a nice buttery and garlic flavor, but wasn't overdone. The shell was pretty easy to crack too.  \n\nGarlic Fries- The medium size was probably too much for all of us because the main star of the meal was the crab. Probably could have had a small order to share among the 3 of us. The fries tasted good and had a nice savory garlic like taste but I didn't think they were that great. Honestly I'd be fine without it. \n\nComplementary Bread- A nice sourdough bread roll is brought out to us in paper bags. The bread is nice and chewy but you don't want to fill up on bread here do you? If you get crab here (why wouldn't you, after all, it is a CRAB house) just save your stomach for that and pack the bread away to go (it's already conveniently in a bag anyway) and eat it for breakfast the next day or something. \n\nOverall, the crab is king here, with very good attentive service, and prepared very well here. But since it is seafood, and it is made right, you have to pay for it... so this place is not for the penny pinching. Don't waste your money on the shrimp or the salads, or even the garlic fries. Just stick to the crab and don on your bib and take cheesy photos so you can post them on your facebook page and enjoy your meal.\n\nMisc: Oh and real random, this restaurant is located upstairs. There is also some free 3 hour parking available really close to the main entrance of Pier 39.", "author": "Vic C."}

I love to indulge in good tasting food oozing with fat, but sadly the excessive fat here did not help with the taste.  The crabs are deep fried, smothered with fat &salt, and served on an Iron Skillet.  The cut edges are dry, hard and excessively oily.\n\nMoreover, their veggies are very out of place.  I would rather they roast some veggies and serve them with the Iron-Skillet dishes than to load them up in the Crab Chowder.\n\nOkay Dishes:\n(These dishes are decent, but not something I would go to a way-overpriced restaurants for)\n* Clams (Garlic Steamed) - The clams are normal, but the sauce is good with bread and the dishes that are too dry.\n* Crab Enchilada -  This dish has a lot of ingredients that go well together.  It is properly flavored, but I only ate a few bites because it is very rich and not outstandingly tasty.\n* Mixed Baby Greens Salad (comes with Prix Fixe Menu) - The dressing is interesting\n* Calamari - Normal\n* Garlic Fries - Fried in the oil that they fry the crab in.  I like Gordon Biersch Garlic Fries more.\n\nCrap:\n* Crab Chowder - Worst chowder ever!  Very watered down and loaded with out-of-place veggies.\n* Killer Crabs - Crap!  With 17 people, we ordered ten people worth of crab and doggy-bagged half of it.\n* Mussels & Shrimp (Iron Skillet-Roasted) - The waiter said the Iron- Skillet Roasted Crab is the same as the Killer Crabs, so we only got the Mussels and Shrimp.  Not much flavor in the mussels and some of them are undercooked.  Moreover, I am not into the tenderized farmed shrimp.\n\nParking Tip: You can get validated parking at the blue parking garage opposite Pier 39.  There will be signs directing you to that $7/hr garage.  There is 1 Hour free validated parking if you *exit* the garage before 6pm, and 2 Hours after that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-02", "description": "Let's put it this way. I don't particularly fancy crab, but after eating this beautiful, succulent, and just simply scrumptious crab I must say I want more. This place has ruined all other crab for me. It's actually quite sad because I end up comparing seafood to Crab House's crab and nothing even comes close. \n\nOn appetizers, I recommend the garlic fries, crab chowder, bruschetta, and caesar salad. I know a lot of people have mentioned the garlic fries and reading this one is probably wondering what is so special about this fries. Let me explain, even though it is most definitely fattening(it's fries, this should be a nobrainer) when i tasted this delight, I felt my weight lifted. It's light, creamy, but also salty and garlicy to the best degree. \n\nPersonally, I don't like the texture of oyster so I didn't try one. BUT, my friend that came with me ordered and simply raved on about the it. I can't exactly say much but from what I heard, the sauce was delectable. From the looks of it, the presentation was palatable and the color was quite exquisite too. \n\nOn another note, sometimes the wait to get into the restaurant is a wee bit long. It ranges from ten to forty-five minutes(max). During holidays, it could take longer. I strongly encourage reservations. But, if you decide on a whim to go to the restaurant, note that it is Pier 39. There are gorgeous decorations, a plethora of unique shops, performers. The street vendors offer cotton candy, churros, hot dogs, and other little snacks. Also, there are street artists that honestly are brilliant; I bought this little piece of the golden gate region for around ten dollars. It now hangs in my room. Basically, even if you do end up having to wait for a while longer than expected, there is always stuff to do. The wait is worthwhile. \n\nThe view from the store is also something \"to die for.\" If you end up sitting at a window seat on persay New Year's Eve or July Forth, you'll have the optimal view for fireworks. The bay is always gorgeous year round even without the special days so never fear. \n\nHoliday season is coming up and I definitely recommend this restaurant if you are bringing friends or family on a tour around San Francisco. They'll never want to go home. If the concept of your relatives staying for longer than a week scares the living hell out of you, maybe you want to reconsider going to this restaurant.

Unfortunately, this place was a complete letdown.\n\nFor the price, I was expecting far better service. To begin with, my very small Chinese family of four found our booth to be too cramped. We asked to switch tables and while another server said it was okay (and we later found out that this switch was also made on their computers), our server said no. \n\nAnd speaking of our server... She was absent and entirely unfriendly until the end of the meal, when she started to at least fake a smile. I'm pretty sure she judged us the whole time we were there. I know Pier 39 gets a lot of tourists from countries where tipping is not customary, but we know proper restaurant tipping etiquette - we've only lived in the U.S. for 15 years. I have NEVER been looked down upon so much for wanting to share a meal because I wasn't hungry. She ended up giving us the wrong bill because of the aforementioned table switch issue and didn't realize it until we were almost out the door. She reminded us that gratuity is not included in listed menu prices and told us what recommended tipping percentages were. Ummmmmm OKAY LADY, PLEASE. I KNOW HOW THIS WORKS. Plus the menu already explicitly stated this! I actually told my dad to leave her a penny because that is all she deserved, but he was a lot more generous than he should have been. (But my mom and I both refused to let him tip anywhere near the percentage we typically tip.)\n\nThe one star earned back was for the food. It wasn't spectacular but it was good. The portions were pretty small. My sister's fish and chips were the family's unanimous favorite dish ordered, which is kind of sad in retrospect. I liked the crab angel hair lasagna I ordered, but it was overly salty and oily.\n\nFor a $$$ meal, unacceptable.", "author": "Annie L."}

The food came out quick when we ordered which was nice but the wait staff was sub par.  My wife and I ordered a half bottle of wine (I won't get into the lack of quality wines for $12/gls when I can get a great wine for less at a Napa Valley restaurant) and a kids shirley temple.  The runner brought over the wine and shirley temple, which was in a large glass, and motioned like the kids drinks was for me when there were 2 adults and  one child at the table.  My wife ordered crab and I had to ask the server for a crab bib which he replied \"sure\" with a tone like I was asking him to knit me one.  Also, we were never given butter with our bread.

I 1st Stumbled on this establishment with my boy friend back in (08). I am a huge fan of Pier 39 & we were wondering around stairs & this place caught my interest with crab cage, awning & water craft like appearance. Plus, it had a pretty good looking menu on the outside that defiantly helped. My boy friend has a deep love for Dungeness Crab that also helped. So, you put those things in the equation & you can pretty much guarantee him & I were going to dinner there. My most recent visit to the Crab House was last year with my best friend Stepheni R.\n\nOn the inside it packed full of charm & a rustic boat like feel.  They have adorable mirrored port holes at your entrance & Host or Hostess to greet you. They have a mini full bar & to the left a cute intimate fire place to eat or curl up in front of with your sweetie on those cold & windy San Francisco nights. There are several options as far as dinning seating goes. You can dine at the fire place, on the right side of the Restaurant where they have booths or the left side beyond the bar where you have  tables. They have more adorable mirrored port holes that are properly  threw out the restaurant & over head a huge  variety of decorated crabs. Any type of crab to fit any one's personality or for different occasions. They are too cute. They have lovely window seat's with view of Forbes island, the sea lions, & Alcatraz & the San Francisco Bay. Now, the eating quarters are a little tight. So, don't expect a lot of leg room.\n\nNow, let's get to my (2) favorite dishes that I crave. These dishes are signature to the Crab House by the way. I  flippin'  LOVE the Crab Alfredo. Oh my goodness, it's pasta smothered in a rich Alfredo sauce with little chunks of Dungeness  Crab. This takes Alfredo to a whole new level. It is so much better than you can even imagine. It makes Chicken Alfredo or Shrimp Alfredo look like a joke. There is no comparison between them. \n\nAnother delicious (1) for the record books is there Dungeness crab chowder. It's creamy & rich and seasoned to perfection. If you thought New England Clam Chowder is your favorite soup you may start to 2nd guess that. My only complaint is the hard bread they serve while you wait for your meal or appetizer. Get new bread guys.lol\n\nI love this place it's as charming as they come,has a great location &some superb food. \n\n-Elena ;)", "author": "Elena A."}

Crab House is as touristy as they come. Really. From the 'Got Crabs?' t-shirts to the plastic crabs and fisherman's nets which adorn the walls and ceilings, to the cellophane bibs and the giant sharing plates of seafood, this was something a bunch of Europeans like us just *had* to do during our stay in SF. Pier 39 baby. Bring it.\n\nI experienced many brand new things at Crab House. One of which was being told to 'walk around' by a front of house member of staff. Yes, this is true. Jenny L and I popped over on behalf of our group of 8 which was arriving in a few separate segments, and we had booked, so we quote:\n    'Your table isn't ready yet, the gentleman there is still paying.' (Points at restaurant area.) 'You can just walk around for a while if you want.'\n\nOh... okay? Around... the restaurant itself? Right. What we *did* do was pull up a few pews at the bar, and though this isn't the restaurant's fault, the gentleman in question seemed to be taking a financial analysis course at our table. Really, how long does it take to pay? What *was* the restaurant's fault however was that we were sat at that bar for approximately half an hour, and nobody even offered a drinks order. That was also pretty new to me.\n\nWhat else was new? Oh yeah! So the guy opposite who was crabbing it up with his girlfriend did something I'd never seen before. He had a Corona with a lime in it, and after popping the wedge down into the neck of the bottle he covered the rim with salt, like a margarita. As a Corona fan I was intrigued, and if I'm feeling brave enough I might try it myself one day. Tips! The really nice dude sat next to us at the bar recommended one thing: the garlic fries. In fact those were so good, we ended up ordering two batches. Double tips!\n\nMeanwhile we did eventually sit down, and four members of our party shared the monster epic crab dinner which looked amazing, and delightfully messy. It was apparently very garlicky but very good. I had basa fillet which blew me away, I had to say I wasn't expecting brilliance from a tourist trap but I was super impressed with the sundried tomatoes (I'm so 80s, I was also wearing a jumpsuit to dinner), the giant couscous, and even the salad side was delicious, along with the roasted veg. Jenny L and Row H both had steaks which they were equally surprised by. So we were all happily fed, and the waitress who attended to us was delightful. The beer drinkers at the table didn't rate the pitcher too hotly, but our Chardonnay was crisply nice enough.\n\nThe crab theme is cute (some may hate it but you've got to appreciate it in the kitschy charm kind of way), but marks down for the weird start to the evening...

As soon as the words \"Crab House\" came out of my mouth, she started salivating and freaking out in the car. I kid you not and I do not exaggerate.\n\nWe settled on making a reservation for Tuesday night to avoid the crowd and tourists. That was the plan anyway. The line at the restaurant on a Tuesday night was still out the door and the place was packed full of tourists but we got seated right away like VIPs.\n\nBetween 3 of us girls, we ordered:\n\n* Lotsa Crab 3 lbs ($50) :: This is just a bunch of tasty crab legs that are somewhat difficult to crack and eat because they are coated in delicious butter. No, that's not really a complaint. If I had a butler cracking these suckers for me though, I could have easily eaten all 3 lbs myself. On a whiny, food critic note, some of the meat didn't slide easily out of their shells, which usually indicates that it was frozen at some point? However, with the volume they're selling, I can't see how that would be necessary.\n\n* Medium Garlic Fries ($8) :: Clearly someone mislabeled the sizes here because a \"medium\" can easily feed 4-6. These are the tastiest and garlic-y-est fries I've ever had. You can actually see all the minced garlic bits on the fries! If fries aren't greasy enough for you on their own, be sure to dip them in the crab butter. Mmm, nomnomnom.\n\n* Medium Iron Skillet-Roasted Mussels ($15) :: Also delicious, big surprise! I was really glad we got these because they're easy to eat when you want to take a break from crab-cracking activities. Also, both the garlic fries and the bread they give you taste fantastic dipped in mussel buttah.\n\nDefinitely a fan but the food seems a little overpriced (probably because it's in a tourist-y area).

Saw a few U.S. Navy Sailors on the Embarcadero sportin' their clean whites...no it's not Fleet Week, that's in Oct, but a ship had docked so we had some service men & women visiting us for a bit. Yeeeh, I'm a very proud U.S. Navy \"bratt\"!\n\nRESTAURANT: Since we parked on 3rd floor of garage, walked over the ramp to the 2nd level of Pier 39, where the Crab House is located. Had RSVP for 5:30pm for party of 4, got there 6pm, waited like 5min to be seated @ \"their\" version for a party of 4, & then waited another 10min to be re-seated @ a larger table for party of 6 (thanks to Hostess Onya for taking care of us w/ seating). Moms & I are like 5'4\" (mind you we're hippy too), while bf & dad are like 5'8\" & 5'10\"...I've said in my own prev reviews, we really need our \"elbow space\" so just a heads up...food is good, but table area just seems small. Not handicapp friendly at all (I'm being honest) nor heavy/big-people friendly..I'm shootin' ya straight!\n\nSERVICE: Our waiter Vito was being kept quite busy w/ our table & others, as it was a packed place on a Sunday evening. We got our bread, order of chowder, & cocktails, but no water. Timing from the moment we placed our drink order (H2O & cocktails), took about 10min for water to hit our table. I'm not sure who to blame, but dag nab it, that didn't make much sense to us. Other than wait for water, service was good...able to flag down any employee speed walking by to ask for something & got the assistance. Again, tight/small place for the amount of patrons they want to cater so service is to feed u quickly, get you in & out, & move move move through the walkways btw tables. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWrVV4mS-SLy-Ph_DeJSAg?select=RBsgttTzuzDTftoNTrfzzQ\n\nDRINKS: We ordered Mojitos, all w/o the Mint...yes, w/o the mint. It just gets in our way. BF had Pineapple, I had Cuban Blue, & dad had Baja http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWrVV4mS-SLy-Ph_DeJSAg?select=CnAiPXIts57hm8K9K0epdw The mojitos were pretty good. Speaking from a \"light weight\", Cuban Blue was enough & plenty alcohol...now speaking for dad (who's main drink is Tangueray or some gin straight on ice) it was aiight. Mojitos come recommended though.\n\nFOOD: Pops had Bowl of Crab Chowder http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWrVV4mS-SLy-Ph_DeJSAg?select=fYfV4afRbQpKaxyBXZ_tIw while the rest of us had the Cup; pretty hearty w/ more veggies than expected, but still good. Pops had Lobster Thermidor at which he said it seemed they just put a slab of cheese on the lobster vs a sauce compared to his tastings of Lobster Thermidor elsewhere; moms had Salmon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWrVV4mS-SLy-Ph_DeJSAg?select=fZroUZUIr_TV4PB-b2qR_g while bf-Jayson & I shared Combo Mussels, Shrimp, & Crab http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWrVV4mS-SLy-Ph_DeJSAg?select=5F_-3E7DH2juvjVmFbrAIg Mussels were easy to de-shell, but shrimp..well, so much work for so little meat. The buttery dipping sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kWrVV4mS-SLy-Ph_DeJSAg?select=QMPK73ENq8r5IvpXexENCw was good tho!\n\nFinal tab was $160 & some change. Interesting, the bill came out w/ the 15% gratuity calculated (NOT added to bill) for us just in case we wanted to know...wow wasn't that nice, here I thought that was done only for a party of 6+. U learn sumthin' new everyday. Honestly speaking, would we come back...likely noooot anytime soon, & if so, keep it just as a 2-some dinning experience..if more, just go to Crockett's Dead Fish http://www.yelp.com/biz/dead-fish-crockett", "author": "Mary J."}

The multitude of positive reviews on Yelp made me take a chance on Crab House. \n\nThe place is sort of out of the way on the pier, and they were happy to accommodate my reservation for eight later that night. Service was extraordinarily quick throughout the night, with single-digit minutes transpiring between placing orders and receiving our food, though I would think that a place called Crab House would have plenty of crab ready to go.\n\nWe started with two orders of garlic fries for the table, and the serving size was plenty large enough for everyone to have a share. The fries were only so-so, but the big blast of garlic no small consolation. \n\nI grabbed a bowl of crab chowder, too. I thought the proportion of vegetables (carrot, corn, and potato) were almost too much for the small cup of chowder, preventing the crab (what should have been the star) to shine through.\n\nThe giant 6.5 lbs platter of crab we ordered was listed as serving four on the menu, but it fed five well. The garlic butter provided good coverage, though I could have appreciated a side of said butter for dipping. The cast iron griddle on which it was served was so hot that it provided a rich flavor to the meat.\n\nAs I walked past one of the many chain seafood restaurants on the Wharf, I wondered if they used fresh seafood or worked from the same suppliers as the rest of their locations in other parts of the country. I wasn't about to find out. You can do a whole lot worse on the Wharf, and - though a little expensive - Crab House lives up to its name.", "author": "Brad S."}

They also validate your parking for two hours.  \n\nMy friend and I ordered the crab chowder to share, presentation looks good,. but the taste of the soup was pretty bland.  I like my soup with a lot of broth, which this chowder did not have.  It was def loaded with goodies though. \n\nFor the entree, 4 girls and I shared the $100 crab feast dinner and it was def more than enough for us. The crab chunks were huge, but the meat was really dry and bland.  I asked if they had a special sauce, but it was just a dish of butter to dip in,. BLEH.\n\nI rate the food 2 stars. But the ONE STAR lower rating was influenced by the MANAGER who was running the show last Saturday. \n\nI was sitting right next to the window and the blinds were down cause it was blinding my friend infront of me.

I thought it was really steep for $26, but knowing Fisherman's Warf is a tourist spot, I could accept that.\n\nThe disappointment came from the main dish and the reason my family and I decided on this spot to begin with - the 'Killer Crabs'.\n\nAs a New Yorker, I can to purchase live dungeness crabs easily.  Since dungeness crabs originate on the west coast, I was under the impression that the quality would be much better in San Fran than what I can purchase back at home - oh boy was I wrong if high quality crabs are supposed to taste like the ones I had today.  I paid over $70 for two regular size crabs before tax and tips and the quality and texture of the crab meat was equivalent to pre-frozen, reheated King Crab legs.  Just to be clear, pricing wasn't the issue.  I was well aware of the menu prices before deciding on eating at the Crab House, but for what I was willing to pay for a nice lunch with my family, I expected nothing less than for the crabs to be freshly killed and cooked when ordered.  The texture of the crab meat is just sub-par.\n\nThe experience was extremely disappointing.   \n\nNext time, I'm going to try the crab stalls at the broad walk which I'm willing to bet is just as good or better than what I tasted today - and if not, then at least I will save myself some money.", "author": "Nicole L."}

I was able to reserve a table with the Open Table app, which was nice because I didn't know when we'd be back from our bay cruise. So it was great to be able to reserve right away with the app. \n\nOur table was ready on time. It was very busy, but it's busy at Pier 39. It was so busy that it was hard to walk down the aisles to the table without bumping into staff along the way. But we got a window table. The restaurant smells of crab inside and outside, like a crab sauna. But that's their specialty. We ordered the half size garlic roasted crab, crab cakes, and crab chowder. All were delicious. We shared the entire meal, so all was served at just about the same time.\n\nOur waiter put a bib on me, and went to put one on my boyfriend, but he didn't want a bib. It made the waiter look sad. I do think bibs should be a more optional thing, rather than making one feel like you've hurt someone's feelings. Our waiter was attentive overall. He did provide the check before offering dessert, which we did ask to order. The tiramisu was okay. It wasn't the best ever, but we came for the crab. And then we did have to ask for wet cloths to wipe our hands on before we left the restaurant. I think those should have been provided after the main course. \n\nI'd never had crab chowder. I think this was my favorite, with the garlic roasted crab right behind it. \n\nAll in all, I would return. And I would recommend this restaurant, but I would always say this is Pier 39. You're not going to get the most attentive service. So don't expect it. I'd give this restaurant 5 stars if the service improved, and the floor wasn't slippery (I guess part of  that sauna effect I mentioned earlier).", "author": "Reyes H."}

We had the Crab feast for 4 (Which was huge!) fish and chips, shrimp and chips, 2 bowls of chowder and some garlic bread.\n\nI couldn't believe it... I normally don't like crab that has sauce on it, because you end up with sauce up to your elbows trying to eat it... but this was so good, I didn't gear, I just dealt with greasey appendages.  The crab was not subtle at all, but packed with salty garlicky goodness.  \n\nThe fish and chips was initially disappointing because it was just 1 slab of fish and the whole beauty of fish and chips is that you get this most excellent crust to fish ratio.  Well, turns out that this slab of fish was tender and fresh and flaky.  The batter was crisp and light but didn't get soggy even after sitting for awhile, I was shocked and would definitely order it again.  Same with the shrimp, not heavily breaded, lots of shrimp flavor and not too greasy, but really tasty. \n\nYum, I'd definitely come back, but I'm scared it won't be as good!", "author": "Kit W."}

Sure, I understood their necessity since, other than oranges and meth, Florida has no other industries. So I'd smile and greet them warmly, but underneath the veneer lay a black, venomous bile. \n\n\"WHY are you driving so SLOW?!\"\n\"WHY are you wearing socks and sandals?\"\n\"Really? A fanny pack? REALLY?\"\n\nIt's like people dropped at least 30 IQ points when they went on vacation and here I was, having to navigate Flowers for Algernon, but in reverse. I labeled the syndrome. I called them \"tourons.\"\n\nFucking tourons.\n\nWorst still was what tourons considered \"good\" and \"authentic.\" I've see some rave about the \"Florida lobster\" they were eating as I noticed, of course, that said lobster had claws. (Nope, Florida lobsters don't have claws.)  I've seen tourons talk about \"visiting\" Florida while never setting foot off of Disney property. (I'm sure the siren song of Bithlo, FL's trailer parks and mud boggin' tracks are hard to resist.)\nAlas, however, we all are tourons at one point or another. Yes, you've got your Yelp, your iPhones, your Lonely Planet apps, but at some point, you're going to do something embarrassingly touristy.\n\nHello, Crab House.\n\nWe were advised to go to PPQ. \"If you guys want crab, you need to hit PPQ,\" a couple of locals advised us. I'll never know if they were right, because we never went. To be quite honest, 1) we were tired and 2) I kind of wanted to be a touron. I wanted to embrace it for once.  So where else do we go than Fisherman's Wharf?\n\nYeah, I can see your eyes roll even from Atlanta. And I'll make fun of you when you end up at World of Coke. Still, we enjoyed our meal at the Crab House. Was it authentic? I dunno. Was it over-priced? Probably. Was it good? Yep. Dungeness crab roasted to the point where their shells shatter with a mere squeeze? Kind of hard to screw that up and these guys didn't.  The service was friendly and on point. The space was charmingly touristy and pointedly inoffensive. (I mean, they DID after all make sure to remove the swastika from the model of the Hindenburg inexplicably hanging from the ceiling.)\n\n Sure, we could've been delirious from the miles of uphill walking we'd done, it could've been the mild buzz I'd whipped up while drinking my pre-dinner beer. Nevertheless, tourist trap or no, I've got to give at least 4 stars to this place.", "author": "Ivan S."}

I came here solely based on the high number of good yelp reviews and was curious if they were offering something equivalent to gold over what was selling on the street.  Even during the daytime, we had to wait about 20 minutes before we got seated.\n\nFor three people, we ordered 1 1/2 crabs, the shrimp fettuccine alfredo, and the garlic fries.  The crabs come in an iron skillet poured with their \"special\" garlic sauce.  Frankly, it's just garlic sauce.  Actually, it could be salted a  little more.  Lastly, the presentation sucked because you don't get the crab body (even though there's nothing in the body).. you just get the legs.  They should have just served the entire crab as all the tables around us were asking where was the body.  Some of the yelp pictures show the entire body being served but I guess you only get that if you have a big party or if you're ordering alot?  \n\nThe shrimp fettucini alfredo and fries were good.. you won't go wrong with that.\n\nLast I have to comment on the service because it seemed like there was no service.. just get your order and give you your food.  The lady NEVER asked if we needed anything and we had to call her at least 3 times to get us stuff.

The pier was crowded since it was on a weekend.  We walked about 5 minutes or so to the Crab House.  There was already a crowd outside the restaurant waiting to be called.  I put my name on the waiting list and was told that it would take about 10-15 minutes for 2 people.  Couples that came after us were told 25-30 minutes of wait time.  This was more accurate.  We waited about 30 minutes before we were seated.  It took about 5 minutes before our waitress came over, greeted us, and took our order.   We ordered medium sized calamari, medium sized garlic fries and the lotsa crab.   A bus boy came back with our drinks within a few minutes.  It was crazy busy and they seemed to be on top of things and not let customers wait.  Our waitress came back a few minutes after we got our drinks and put \nbibs on us.  \n\nOur calamari came out first and it was \"seasoned\" with fried lemon slices, regular lemon wedges, and jalapenos.  The calamari also came with that red dipping sauce.  It was crispy, lemony and spicy.  Our crab and garlic fries came out together.  I loved the garlic fries.  It's just regular fries with garlic tossed together.  It was crispy and hot.  The lotsa crab for 2 was about 10 or so crab legs with parts of the body on each.  The garlic butter sauce on the crab was delicious.  It was so flavorful.  I used the free bread they gave us and soaked up some of the garlic butter.  It was so good and worth the 30 minute wait.  \n\nOverall, the food was awesome, the service was great (even on a super busy weekend), and the wait was worth it. It was a bit pricey though overall for us.  Taking the ferry from Sausalito cost us $42 (round trip) and the meal (including tip) was $101.  I would definitely come back.

Wait was reasonable, only 15 minutes and it's easy to kill 15 minutes on the Pier.  Friendly hostess, Attentive waiter.  Husband had the dungeness crab.  Too much work for me, I opted for the salmon with tomato and olives.  I have NEVER had such a good piece of salmon, and I eat a lot of salmon.  Best I have had.  I wish I had some now.  Only low mark from me would be the shrimp cocktail appetizer - had WAY too much black pepper and it totally took over.

We were squeezed into a table clearly made for 4. Once seated, no one could move. We're not very \"large\" people, (although we could drop a few), so I do not know how anyone with a little extra padding could have a comfortable dining experience here.\nAs for the food, we ordered the killer crab. We asked the waitress if we could have it cracked. She seemed kind of bothered. She came back with it, but it was just the legs, and the top shell of the crab. No body! Whaaatt!  Also, we ordered their crab chowder. It probably would be a lot better if they serve it hot. I don't get it. It's such a busy place that I would think that they would have hot chowder constantly cooking. On top of that, we had to ask for some bread because the waitress forgot.

The waiter was really friendly and personable, and he even tied the lobster bib around my neck for me!\n\nI was dining alone, and at a busy place like this I'm normally expecting to be given a small table off to the side. Instead, I was promptly seated at a table next to a window overlooking the bay and Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nI ordered the chowder and the 2lb Dungeoness Killer Crab. The chowder came quickly and I was surprised to see a generous clump of shredded crab on top. The chowder itself wasn't too creamy, as some chowders can be, and there was just enough substance (crab and vegetables) in every spoonful that it made for a very satisfying beginning to the meal.\n\nNext was the crab. It arrived on a sizzling platter and had this great, bright orange appearance. And it smelled fantastic. I had to let it sit for a minute to let it cool enough so that I could handle it. Once I started, it was easy eating as far as crab goes. The shell was crispy and brittle-- always a good sign-- and the meat was tender and juicy. The crab was soaked in this garlic-buttery sauce that gives it an incredibly rich and unique taste. The small, individual loaf of bread they give you offsets the richness of the meal, though.\n\nOverall, the chower and killer crab were absolutely delicious. Avoid Joe's Crab Shack and come here instead. Get the Killer Crab- you won't regret it! Prepare to spend a fair amount, though. The chowder + 2lb crab + soda = ~$50 (not including tip). You'll walk away feeling like it was worth it, though.", "author": "Alex K."}

Yelp said it was good, and lo and behold: it actually was good. \n\nThe decorations are insanely cheesy, but in a fun way. We actually enjoyed checking out all the crabs that seem to be glued to everything. And the food was great. We didn't get the big plate o'crabs, but we saw a few of them and they looked yummy. The prices were high, but not crazy high, and it didn't keep anyone from ordering anything. \n\nIf you need a place near the wharf, this is a great option.

I can not put to words how good their dungeness crabs are.  So big, so fresh, so delicious.  You gotta have their garlic fries too.  It is our second favorite thing on their menu.  The best part is the beautiful view of the water while you're chowing down on this decadent feast and afterwards, you can walk off the calories strolling Pier 39.  :)\n\nIt is a little on the pricey side, but hey, you only live once right.

We were seated next to the window, so we got a great view of the bay and the seals were out, so that was a nice site to see. The waiters were friendly, fast, and were pretty great. \n\nThe food however was subpar and just a disappointment. I was super excited coming here, thinking I would have the best tasting crabs of my life. Boy was I wrong. The crabs arrived feeling & looking hot, as in cooked. But when I cracked open the shell, the meat was cold and there was no taste at all.  If you count bland as a flavor, then I guess that was the flavor they decided to serve that day. We ordered mussels as well, and it was a little overcooked. It was so chewy my jaws started to hurt from all the chewing. \n\nThe only thing I liked was their garlic fires.

I went with my family yesterday for my mom's birthday and the waiter was friendly and patient with us as we took our time deciding what to eat.\n\n There were five us and we decided to start off with 2 bowls of the crab chowder. This was more than enough for the 5 of us to share. Everyone in my family enjoyed it especially since it had big clumps of crab meat. \n\nI ordered the crab cakes and they were absolutely delicious. It seems like a small portion at first since there are only 2 crab cakes, but they are actually pretty plump. Way more filling than I expected, but very fresh and tasted even better with the sauce that came with it. \n\nOther meals ordered by my family included the fish and chips, the crab melt, and lotsa crab. Everyone had nothing but good things to say about each dish. The chips or \"fries\" that came with the crab melt and fish and chips were delicious because they were a garlic pesto mixture. \n\nThe best part of the meal had to be the tiramisu. This is by far the best tiramisu I have had a restaurant in America. My sister who doesn't even like tiramisu couldn't stop herself from eating the small slice we ordered. It was pretty surprising how good this tiramisu was since we were at a seafood restaurant, not an italian restaurant, and in one of the most touristy spots in SF. \n\nWhile the food was excellent, the dishes didn't seem the cleanest.

Yet, the Dungeoness served here is cooked delightfully in tons of garlic butter, though this presents a challenge in opening!  None of the entrees disappointed.  The crab lasagna was an interesting twist over angel hair pasta (very rich!) and the mussels sweet and tender.  Lastly, I agree with others: the garlic bread is amazing, but small in size.  A fair price: 2 entrees (including the 2lb. killer crab), 2 appetizers, and non-alcoholic drinks came to over $110 w/ tip.\n\nService is a bit different here - seems that side staff bring the refills, clear dishes, etc. and this was often lacking.  For example, we sat, fingers drenched in butter, for nearly 15 minutes while waiting for a wet nap.  At these prices small towels would be a welcome touch, but oh well.  Yet, we asked repeatedly for refills and napkins to slow response.  Our server did not seem distracted, nor was the restaurant overcrowded so we saw no reason for such inattentiveness (note to restaurant: you could have turned our table a 1/2 hour faster had our server been paying attention).  We also noticed that The Stinking Rose is a sister restaurant and asked for suggestions - surprisingly, the staff offered none (so we didn't visit).\n\nAs to cleanliness, I know busy restaurants face a constant challenge in upkeep but... we were led to a table and then told to stand there while they found someone to wipe it off!  The crab tools were filthy, too, covered in buttery remnants of previous users.  Plus used wet nap wrappers lined the window sill next to our table.

I know the turnover of crabs in the restaurant is rapid. Still the crab tastes like it's precooked and re-heated. Just doesn't taste fresh! It lacks any sweet/juiciness of fresh seafood. And it comes on a hotplate that was more like lukewarm, it sizzled off under 20secs. Mostly, we were quite bothered that there is a layer of white-film on the crab meat. It used to be a 5-star experience eating the hot-salty-buttery crab by the lovely sunset. But I can't say it is the same anymore.\n\nAnd the Garlic Fries serving portion was reduced significantly!! Fries, garlic and salt must be cheapest thing to serve in a restaurant. Yet, they decided to cut down on this item?? A shame... \n\nThe service was just-okay. The server was definitely overwhelmed. I felt like he was a broker, trading on the NYSE-floor, waiting to close a trade. I can't help but feel his anxiety translate onto our table and our dining experience.

The menu for side dishes included only 3 items, from garlic fries to mixed vegetables.\n\nI'm used to steamed crab, so theirs was a different experience. We decided it must have been grilled. It was Dungeness crab with an extremely brittle shell. It wasn't awful tasting, but it wasn't what I was looking for. \n\nSoft drinks were $3 each, but refills were free. Our server took our order, but always outsourced the drinks to someone else, so the efficiency of service was somewhat lacking. Our waiter also seemed to have something of a chip on his shoulder, which is fine since we didn't see him all that much.\n\nOn the plus side, we got there at lunch time and it was pretty busy.

While I'm already super-sexy, I'm even sexier in a bib; 2.) Crab Fondue is not what you think (or hope) it is; 3.) Just because a restaurant is over-priced and amidst tourist-ville doesn't necessarily mean it's terrible; and 4.) I was never meant to eat crab (at least, while retaining my dignity).\n\nThe crab was great. Really, it was. If that's all you care about, stop reading now and get yourself some Crab House.\n\nWhat? You want to know more? Well... okay, I guess. You see, our server was fucking terrible. She put in our order incorrectly and brought us our check 15 minutes, then 10 minutes, then 5 minutes after we asked for it. Oh, and she put my bib on too tight! I know, right?? Pshhh.\n\nAlso, the dishes were labeled very poorly on the menu. Maybe I'm spoiled in NYC, but when you say something is crab fondue, at least write a blurb about it so we know it's actually two pieces of bread and a cheesy custard (with crab in it? abso-fickin-maybe!) in a pie tin.... instead of, ya know, crab fondue.\n\nFor the record, I made a total mess of my crab legs (which were served in a red sauce of some kind) and when cracking them failed, I simply began using my teeth and fingers to yank morsels out of their shell. By the end of it, our table looked like a crab holocaust and my face was dripping with crab tendons and sauce.

Soon enough, my parents, aunts, and uncles started plating the table with dishes including the two crabs that were pink, steaming, and ready to be torn apart. Those crabs, my friends, were the best crabs I've eaten in a while. Not even salt was added; only a handful of minced ginger and green onions. The meat was fat, juicy, and sweet that slipped right out of its shell once prompted with a fork.\n\nNot the case with the Killer Crabs here. Well, to be fair, it's not horrible...but it's not CRAB either. In other words, you don't taste crab. There's none of that original, natural sweetness of fresh crab meat that crab lovers (and picky foodies) would love. The little guys are pretty much doused and DEEP FRIED (*cringe*) in so much butter, garlic, and salt that the only thing you really taste is butter, garlic, and salt. Tis a shame. (Oh, and there's a video of what's in the \"secret garlic sauce\" on their website. I have to say that after watching it, I was expecting the taste to hold more...personality. But it still just tastes like butter, garlic and salt.)\n\nOh, and don't get their mussels because they're not good for your money. (Again, my family's kitchen can make a better batch.)

You're much better off ordering an entire grab/or prix fix even if you're someone who doesn't eat much.

My friends loved it. \n\nAs for the food, I trusted Yelpers that this place would come through, and it did. Part of why I picked Crab House was because the menu, although not large, was diverse. I wanted everyone to find something they liked, and we all did. Between my group we ordered crab; crab lasagna; a vegetarian pasta dish; fish and chips; shrimp and chips; a fish sandwich; and a burger. Everyone was satisfied with their choices. For appetizers, we had the garlic fries and the fondue. Both were uniquely awesome. \n\nI am taking one star off because of the bathroom and the drinks. I was really excited about checking out the mojito bar, but wasn't a great fan when I tasted my drink. In fact, I didn't finish it. The bathroom had one narrow stall; it wasn't equipped for disabled persons. I am ambulatory but I have spent a lot of time working with special needs people, and found myself wondering how anyone needing assistance toileting would manage in that restroom. \n\nThe Verdict: The staff was good -- not overly friendly, but attentive and efficient.

We ordered half a crab, a bread bowl of crab chowder, crab cakes, and garlic noodle with crab meat.  The bill came out to be $101.25!  This is including the extra government mandate tax for eating in SF and the regular tax for the food.  The quantity was ridiculously small that we were still hungry afterward.  The crab was small and the garlic sauce was salty and probably will die for if you eat too much of it.  Bread was not warm but hard and cold.  The view was ok but we didn't really get window seat.  I would not choose this place to eat if you're hungry.  But if you feel like donating some money, then go ahead and eat there.  I rarely write reviews, but it's so bad that I feel that I need to inform others.

Not so sure but that might have explained why the crab wasn't top notch.\n\nI didn't have the dungeness crab (I usually don't order crab because I catch it in Oregon during the summertime), but instead opted to have the hawaiian sunfish fillet.  It was labeled as a house specialty but wasn't as good as I would have hoped.  The fillet was very thin and Crab House has got to be careful because people might get it confused with a baby hawaiian sunfish.  But granted, a hawaiian sunfish is probably different than a mola mola (2200 lb average weight) so I'll try to give them the benefit of the doubt.   Maybe another try will yield different results but I am surprised at their lack of fish entree varieties for a seafood restaurant (even though they're called Crab House, not Fish House).", "author": "Albie F."}

I'm going to totally bypass her for this rating. Because a good restaurant should not be at fault for poor hostesses. \n\nSo I wanted crabs and walking through Pier 39... you could smell the crabs boiling and cooking up a storm here and my stomach refuses to be neglected for another second. So I had to stop by. The wait was about 20-25 min. - I think the hostess needs to be replaced or biatch slapped because she didn't do a good job of letting people know their table is ready. We had to come up and bullied her... let's just say ... I AM NOT NICE WHEN I\"M HUNGRY. It's not me, it's my stomach.\n\nWe finally sat down and the waiter, a very clean cut guy came up to take our order immediately. I like the idea of having an ice cold pitcher of water ready to consume so that was much brownie points in my book. We ordered the crab chowder, apparently that seems to be notoriously famous and it did not lie. It was very good. Also had the garlic bread.. although I was a bit confused by the grated parmesean over it, I didn't think about it until afterwards... It was pretty damn good.\n\nThen comes my whole roasted crab in their special garlic sauce. YES, i ordered a whole crab to myself. It was divine. I felt like i could be swimming in that garlic sauce. It was really easy to crack the crab so I wasn't breaking anything and popping people's eyes out. The meat was really juicy and tender. I was disappointed about the crab shell however. Usually, there would be some yummy delicacy on the shell itself... but it was not there! I think baking the crab has completely shrank it or they cleaned out the entire shell before cooking. Oh well\n\nI've eaten my fair share of crabs and although this place was very good, but I would have to say that I've had better crabs.", "author": "Karly G."}

The big ole four pounder sat eye to eye with me sitting low in the booth...but with bib strung around my neck, fork in one hand, and crackers in the other, I was ready to conquer. I clearly underestimated the quantity of seafood that came out. I failed to take into account Mr. Crab's numerous minions--over twenty mussels littering the rest of the enormous iron griddle pan.\n\nDespite the mini cups of their special garlic butter sauce, my boyfriend and I still had leftovers. The stuff was sooo good, conversation was kept to a minimum as we gorged ourselves on crab, mussels, and bread dipped into their sauce. The cooking method rendered the shell of the crab easy to crack with my teeth and the balsamic vinagrette poured over the mussels on the sizzling griddle added that extra oomph.\n\nService was also impeccable. Several white jacketed waiters waltzed around the restaurant, keeping an eye on tables and indicating to others when to remove the discard bowls, pour water, get more napkins, etcetera. It was awesome. Even more awesome to see all kinds of people getting down and dirty with their seafood. \n\nFinger licking is highly recommended here!!!", "author": "Jan P."}

She took me here on 8/26 because of all the hype.  I really wanted to like this place, but I gave it a three star because of the following reasons:\n\nService:\nService started off okay.  Our waitress took a bit longer to greet us and take our drinks, maybe because she was busy, which I don't mind.  When she did come, she was very courteous.  It took a turn for the worse when they brought out the food.  The staff came from behind me and one staff member spilled the oil / butter sauce from the sizzling crab hot plate.  If anyone has eaten here, they know how hot it was.  Basically, my whole forearm was burned.  They spilled so much, you could see the puddle on the floor, which I should have taken a picture as proof.  I didn't even know who spilled it because I all heard was a sorry and he rushed off.  About maybe 5 minutes later, the waitress checked up on me and gave me a cold damp towel to ease the burn.  That was it, no further follow up.  I did, however, appreciate a particular staff member that offered burn cream.  At the time, I didn't think I needed it.  Nonetheless, I would've appreciated if 1) the Manager came to check up on me, 2) replace our crab plate, given all the juice is gone or 3) some kind of incentives to keep me as a customer, i.e. free drink, dessert, etc...  Nope none of that happened.  The next day, my whole forearm was pink/blistery.  Luckily, it went away with just a small scar and I'm not one of those that makes a big deal.\n\nFood:\nFrom what I recollect, we ordered the Lotsa Crab,  shrimp, clams and crab & shrimp Louie salad.  Crab: dry, probably because there were no juice left from the spill!  Shrimp and clams were dry and small, but I have to admit were tasty.  My favorite was the Louie salad.  It was delicious!!  \n\nOverall, I would give this place 2 1/2 star just for the Louie salad, but I'll be nice.", "author": "Leanne H."}

I almost thought of looking for a different place to eat.  Boy am I glad I didn't!  I walked up to the front and asked the manager how long the wait would be for just me.  He turned around and asked if I minded sitting a little communal type table near the bar.  If I didn't mind, then he could seat me right now.  I was like hell yes, I'm down for no wait time.  The waiter came by and took my order.   Not sure if they have an assembly line back there in the kitchen, or if I got somebody else's order, but in less than 5 minutes, I had a wonderful, smoking hot crab right in front of me.

I even signed up with Yelp just to comment on it.\n\nWe were seated across from folks who believed they should be the center of attention.  They were extremely loud and certainly had no table manners; two of them ate their steak with their hands.  About the only real vocabulary any of the three had was followed by the word, f**k.  \n\nObviously, the restaurant had to seat them.  Two groups of diners asked to be moved to other locations within the restaurant.  Our issue was that even though the waiter we had was very forgiving, we were unable to complete our meals because the front manager refused to ask these 'patrons' to leave.  We were able to eat about half of our two plates of fish and chips ~ $60.\n\nKnowing full well of the type of language these folks were using didn't even stop the front manager from seating a large family with a small child right next to this group.  Shame on them!\n\nOn the way out, I stopped to give the front manager a piece of my mind. His response was that I had offended him!  Seriously.\n\nIn my opinion, to say this establishment is child friendly would be incorrect.  I can't honestly say it would be friendly to anyone based upon our experience.  Sure, everyone has a right to be welcomed into an eatery.  However, that right should end when diners become so disruptive as to cause others to ask to move away from them.

It was pretty good, a bit overwhelming with LOTS of ingredients from potatoes, bacon, corn, crab and possible more. The chowder itself wasn't thick, but due to all the additives made it nice and chunky. They also had two mini baguettes to start with I guess. Olive oil and balsamic vinegar are set for you to use. I ordered the lobster therminador? to share with my mom. It was good at first bite, then got boring. It was lobster baked in a creamy cheesy herb sauce. It also came with couscous.

Our actual rating is 4.5 and the only reason for the deduction is because the chowder just wasn't good. Of course we're spoiled by always having the opportunity to eat the best ever chowder at the Splash Cafe in Pismo Beach, California (highly recommend the clam chowder with shredded crab on top-amazing-look it up fellow yelpers)! But back to the Crab House. \n\nWe went on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The weather was showery so crowds on Pier 39 were not too bad. We were seated right away and our drink needs attended to. The decor is cheesy but not over the top. Here's a news flash for those of you who downgrade the Crab House because it looks like a tourist trap...it IS a restaurant on Pier 39...duh! Back to the meal. This was a birthday lunch for our 19 year old son and there were four of us at our table including our 21 year old and my husband and I. All of us LOVE crab. I took the Yelpers word for it and ordered the Killer Crab-Crab Feast. We also ordered Crab Chowder, a large Garlic Fry and the birthday boy ordered Shrimp Alfredo. \n\nCrab Chowder: Thin soup with an odd herb - dill maybe? While the crab was tender and plentiful that's about the only thing good to say. The chowder also had lots of different vegies (carrots, Corn, potato and?) all of which were too crunchy. The texture just did not match. It was also supposed to have bacon, but it must have been hiding today. Truly a bad cup of soup. I can make homemade crab chowder with an amazing creamy soup base and lots of bacon potato and garlic. Can't believe we paid for this stuff. \n\nGarlic Fries: Wow!!!!! So good. Hot crisp fries sprinkled with garlic and herbs. Best we've ever had. \n\nShrimp Alfredo: Really good!. The shrimp was seasoned and grilled perfectly. Not at all rubbery, dry or over cooked. The pasta was delicate and tasted like it could be homemade and the Alfredo sauce was creamy and delicious. \n\nKiller Crab-Crab Feast: We were doubtful that there was going to be enough to feed four but at $100 we figured we'd just order another crab if we were still hungry. Well, there was definitely no need to order more. The waiter brought out a huge pile of crab on sizzling hot iron griddle (approx 13x9 inches). The smell made our mouths water. Grilled/roasted crab with an amazing garlic sauce. It was so hot and sizzling  that it was difficult to eat the first few minutes. All four of us dug in anyway. The boys ended up splitting the shrimp Alfredo. \n\nRafael, our waiter was very polite and attentive without hoovering which is what we like.

Not only that, but a waiter would stand around and just look at us, at first I thought he did this to see if we needed anything else, like \"water.\" But no, it seems as though he was waiting for us to finish our food, so he could collect our plates, give us our check and move onto the next customer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-20", "description": "This was my second time at Crab House and my last.  I love crabs and have had garlic roasted crabs at many different places.  As some other reviewers have mentioned, the crabs are fried to the point where all the meat from body is crispy and flaky.  There's not much meat left except for in the legs.  At many other crab restaurants, the crabs tend to be more meaty and juicy.  The grilled mussels and shrimps are tasty but nothing really wows.  The bread was cold and tough to chew.  The kid's grilled cheese dish was hardly edible, pretty much consists of the same cold, hard dinner roll except they add one or 2 slices of cheese.  My 3 year old nephew had a hard time chewing or tearing apart his grilled cheese sandwich I had to tear it into pieces so he can eat it.  For the price they charge, they can't even at least serve freshly baked or at least warmed bread?   This place is overpriced and adds on a 4.9% fee just to cover the cost of doing business.  You'll definitely feel ripped off.  I don't mind spending money on eating out at good establishments with good food and services, but this place is not worth it.  Overpriced and overhyped.  I've had much better elsewhere.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very cramped.  The tables are too close to each other.  Not a great place to bring kids or a place where you'll feel comfortable for long.  My sister had to leave the restaurant just to go outside with her toddler just because it's so cramped.", "author": "Calvin M."}

We are very serious crab eaters and I have to say this place is the place to be for crabs!! And not the type that results in heavy itching and application of ointments in tender nether bits...\n\nThe \"Killer Crab\" is to die for... garlicky, buttery, and roasted to a crisp so that even the thin pieces of shell (Its edible people) are a treat.  If it weren't for the thoughtful bibs that the waiters graciously tie on (and remove if you don't mind the invasion of personal space) i would leave with the demolished remnants on my shirts.  In an attempt to create my own magic at home, i tried to mimic the recipe to no avail.

Waiters are attentive even at their busiest times, and super friendly.\n\nSo why is Kurt D. so intent on convincing us all on the deliciousness of this place but only gives it 3 stars?  Well it has to do with reservations...\n\nI reserved my table at 815 two days in advance on opentable.com.  When me and my date (wink wink) arrived to the crab house i was starving, the garlic was obviously toasting in butter, and my date was obviously glazed over in excitement from my utter beauty...  I walk up to the podium and declare my intent to destroy a \"Killer crab\" but alas... my table wasnt ready... in fact... i needed to wait an additional 15-20 minutes!!! (I arrived on time).  My date was much more irritated than I, I can usually over look pretty small things like waiting for a table for a few minutes... But my family and I have had to wait every time we made reservations... NOT COOL!! \n\nI will be coming back because the food is just that good... but will probably expect delays when i make my reservations again....", "author": "Kurt D."}

We wanted a window sear and asked our server twice and he went to the front and asked we were turned down twice. During the course of the meal my daughter was choking and no one came to help. It wasn't a mere cough she turned red and wasn't breathing. The  restaurant went quiet and my son a new Marine was able to bring up food. We sat back down to eat a bus person came up to inquire about my daughter.  Our server showed up moments later.  I ignored him at this point because I am annoyed that our waiter did not spend time with us because he stereotyped us.

It never fails to amaze me at how amazing their crabs in their secret garlic butter sauce taste. Each time I've been here it's been the same and nothing has changed. It is pricey but definitely worth your money if you're willing to splurge on a GOOD meal. I advise that if you want to eat here you should ONLY eat their crab. It is a crab house and it only makes sense to order crab while dining at a crab house. The service is fine to be honest, they take your order and the food comes out quick. They refill our water when needed and there isn't any waiters walking by asking how your food is when you have a mouthful of food in your mouth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-22", "description": "Price is reasonable considering where this place is at although dinner for two could still run you close to a bill. It's recommended to make reservations on OT. We made reservations for 7pm at 3pm on OT and had plenty of time slots to choose from. When we got there we had a small wait while they cleared the tables but got seated next to the window for a great view while the walk in people had to wait much longer. The longer wait was pretty much due to them being understaffed and what seemed like one waitress running the entire place. Bar seats were first come first serve. \n\nWe ordered the Whole Lots of crab for two, a bole of crab chowder, and fish and chips. The fries that come with the chips are garlic fries so no need to order a side of garlic fries but these fries are super good. \n\nThe bread they serve is just average as the loaf is not warm and if you ask for butter they give you a cold slab of butter in a small ramekin not even worth using since it's cold. The crab chowder had plenty of fresh crab meat on top of just average chowder. For the amount we got it's a good deal, we had plenty to share as it comes with two small bowls. (crab chowder 7/10)\n\nThe fish and chips surprised us as the fish came out in one long fillet piece. We were expecting it to be two or three strips. The batter was light on the outside although didn't really stick to the fish. The fish was flaky and I encountered a couple of small bones but they were visible enough to spot. The garlic fries were excellent as mentioned by reviewers before. It's not smothered in garlic but enough to taste and have a lasting affect on your breath for the night. Soft on the inside and double crispiness on the outside, what fries should be. (Fish and Chips 9/10).\n\nThe whole lot of crab felt like one and a half crab. The waitress brought extra butter and garlic sauce but it's way too oily. The sauce on the crab is enough. Crab tasted fresh as the meat was tender and sweet. They over seasoned some parts of the crab as it was salty but manageable. We had some pieces left over to take home as well and they place some plastic utensils along with the take home box in case the left overs don't make it home with you. For the crab it's decent food although not the best roasted crab in SF. (Crab 8/10).\n\nThere are people who stop by your table to remove any empty dishes but the waitress doesn't really come to bother you or check in on you unless you waive her down. In some ways it worked out or us as we just wanted to eat and not have to say how good the food was, but we ran out of napkins a third of the way through but the place was too packed for us to flag her down.  We only drove up for dinner but should have stayed and hanged out for the day as the parking cost of parking will add to your tab. There are parking lots right next to Pier 39, to the left in the giant parking structure and a decent size lot on the same side. Two hour parking ran 15 bucks on the lot.", "author": "David Y."}

We had two infants in the party who had been sleeping well all day, up until the garlic crab came out.  The smell was so pungent that the children cried all throughout dinner.  The tables here are so crowded together that the seating was actually an unpleasant experience.  Definitely think twice if you're travelling with strollers or car seats.  There was nowhere to stash the strollers either, so we ended up leaving them up near the front of the restaurant.\n\nCrab was good, but not great.  I think it's something that you could have once in a long while, but it's not something that's on the top of the list for a go-to crab place in SF.  I think R&J or PPQ fills the bill for me on that level, especially since they serve crab three or four different ways.  On the other hand, their fish stew sounds promising.  If I ever go their again, I think I'll order less crab and augment with one of their other offerings instead.", "author": "Dave Y."}

The crab didn't taste fresh at all the shell didn't crack cleanly and the shell was kind of elastic, the meat stuck to the inside of the shell. This tells me the crab wasn't that fresh. They cooked the crab with some kind of garlic butter sauce but it was just greasy in my opinion. I also tried the angel hair lasagna, it was soooo oily and greasy, and the portion was very small and it cost 20$. Overall, looking at the menu it seems like most things are overpriced.  The cioppino was terrible, it taste just like tomato sauce out of a can. The calamari was very oily, it tasted average, i've had better calamari for half the price. The bread was terrible too, it was stale, had no flavor, and they didn't even bother cutting it up for you. The crab melt was okay, just average. Our waiter was also weird and very unprofessional the way he talked. Overall will not go back, sooo overpriced and the food was not good enough.

I should of made a run for it then.\n\n4 of us arrived at the Crab House 10 minutes early and were seated in about 5 minutes.2 more joined us later on and was waiting for one person who was stuck in traffic.\n\nMaybe it was a miscommuncation because we were waiting for one person, that all the later arriving tables were served and almost finished with their food before our waiter plopped 4 loafs of COLD bread on the table and asked if we wanted to \"fire it up\" which means to me the food was not even being cooked. So we were sitting there swatting flies and drooling at other's food\n\nWe order the garlic fries, crab feast, garlic noodles, crab ciopino, crab angel hair lasagna, clam fetticine,a couple of other pasta dishes,+ mussels and shrimp iron skillet. \n\nWhen the food did come, everything was DRY! The Crabs was dry and Mussels and Shrimp was dry, just dry. The birthday boy was hungry and feeling gracious and didn't want to complain so we forced ourselves to eat. I had to soak the crab in someone's crab ciopino to moisten it. Im glad our 7th person was a human garbage disposal and eat most of the food no problem.  The only thing decent was their garlic fries and beer.\n\nI was really disappointed in this place for I used to work at the pier and walking by every other day the aroma of their food would make me want to play hooky. Our bill was close to $400, I expected soo much more. The chef have the nerve to serve crab that have been in the oven cooked to the consistency of hay. I am extremely embarassed I brought the family to this place.\n\nThe only reason I even give more than one star was the waiter was quite attentive, he was really patience explaining what's in what for some of us had food allergies and that was quite appreciated and I undersand the suckiness of the food was at no fault through him. Drinks were refilled quickly and he sings a good Happy Birthday. His service alone earned the place 4 stars.\n\n\nI will never cheat on Scoma's again.\n\n\n*", "author": "Katrina C."}

We ended up ordering the \"too two crab,\" which runs you at 69.95.  It consists of two dungeness crab, roasted in a garlic sauce.  The waitress we had was also gracious enough to crack the crabs open for us.  Awesome service.  If we had one complaint about the meal, it would be that the crab shells would tend to crack into the meat, almost like chipped paint.  I'm not sure if that's a result of the crabs being roasted...or being roasted with quickness (I swore it took like 3-5 min to get our crabs).  But other than that, I was satisfied.", "author": "Ulysses M."}

We ordered their famous Killer crab with shrimps and mussels. The crab was sooooo good that it's really worth your money. We also added some garlic fries which is one of the best fries ive ever tasted in SF! The service was pretty good but the downfall is, they failed to input our orders on their system so we waited for another extra 15 minutes again. After serving our main entree, they actually have forgotten about our other order.  But overall, it was a good meal and worth the price! If we were not that patient, other customers would have reacted on a different way. We were just too nice since it's valentines day and we don't wanna ruin that special day with little things like that.

The killer dungeness crab is delightful!\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to try this place based on recommendations by my sister and her boyfriend when they had visited SF a few months back.  We had an early dinner around 5pm so that we could make our Alcatraz Night Tour at 6:30.  The place was pretty empty, it being 5pm on a Monday night, so we were seated immediately at a corner table with a fabulous view of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.  As I sat down, I noticed that an ice cold pitcher of water was already sitting at the table, as well as all the \"tools\" and utensils we needed to demolish our crab.\n\nWe started out with the Sizzling Iron Skillet-Roasted Shrimp.  The appetizer was novel to me - at least 12 good-sized shrimp covered in a seasoned garlic rub, actually sizzling, on an extremely hot iron skillet.  I love shrimp with the shell on; it makes the shrimp more juicy on the inside and this was no different.  First, you start off sucking and licking the delicious garlic seasoning on the shrimp and then peel the shell off to devour the juicy, sweet meat inside.  Simply heavenly.  The shrimp also came with a butter dip that I didn't really use.  I prefer the pure taste of the garlic and shrimp.  We also ordered the garlic bread, but I thought it was just so-so.  It was pretty standard as garlic bread goes: garlic spread on french bread with melted cheese over it.\n\nWe shared a 3 pound order of the Killer Dungeness Crab and my, was it tasty.  A full 3 pounds of huge crab legs and I think we each had two crab claws.  The crab was wonderfully seasoned with garlic and herbs - I had to polish off the seasoning before I ripped into the crab.  The restaurant provides you with these little instruments of crab destruction (no worries about chipping your teeth here) and the server even showed us how to use them.  They look like these little picks with two prongs at the end.  You pierce the shell of the crab with one prong and proceed to \"cut open\" the shell of the crab to get at the delicate meat inside.  Each bite was scrumptious, made even better by the \"hard work\" it takes to get each piece of meat!  \n\nService was prompt and attentive.  Our server made sure that we were well taken care of and never in need of anything.  He knew that we had never dined there before and patiently, or even enthusiastically, showed us the ropes.  \n\nWarning: this will not be a neat meal.  Prepare to get messy and splashed with crab bits and don't get too dressed up.  They do give you these little bibs to wear that will help a bit with the mess, but don't count on it for full protection.\n\nAlthough a tourist trap, this place serves delicious food accompanied with a fantastic view and smiling service.  Highly recommended if you're ever in the SF area!", "author": "Emily C."}

The new glass was the way it should have been...clear, crisp, and delicious, so it leads me to believe that the original glass was  dirty (yuck).

I was showing my parents pier 39 and we were hungry.\n\nStarting off we had a 15 minute wait, nothing much to complain about around lunch time on a nice day.\n\nFirst Impressions was it was cozy restaurant with simple yet unique decor (crabs galore).  We felt rushed to sit in our chairs as we were blocking one of the two path ways to the kitchen with waiters/busboys rushing around frantically.\n\nIt got worse from that point.  Now I know the workers there are trying to get everyone served, but it was a bit chaotic and disturbing watching them.  Not a place to sit down and relax to eat.\n\nWe waited for about 5 minutes before we had to flag down a waiter to order something or even greeted.  The waiter was in a rush and it was obvious.  Now my Dad is the chatty type, introducing us...however our waiter made it very clear via body language he was not interested in our names.  So we all placed our order and ordered some appetizers(the crab fondue).  We were surprised to see the food coming out quick, maybe within 10 minutes for the first plate, followed with the rest a couple minutes later.  But wait where is our appetizer?  I ask the waiter \"Aren't we suppose to get our appetizer first?\"  Oh sorry he said and brought it for a dessert with little care that they screwed up.\n\nAs for the food.  The only good thing I can say is that the Crab was decent.  Award winning best crab in SF which they claim?  Not, but tasty.  The Mussels were horrible.  Some were overcooked, others raw.  The Pasta was undercooked on my Clam Pasta.  Nice flavors however spoiled by the undercooked pasta.  The Salmon was OK, but nothing to special, at least it was cooked properly.  For our dessert (the late coming Crab Fondue, I liked it. My wife found the bread too hard to eat, which it was.  The Fondue toasted bread and the brick rolls which would take a hammer and chisel to break open.\n\nWatching the busboys clean up tables, I seen McDonalds do a better cleaning job.  We were sitting near the kitchen and my wife and I found it very amusing as a tall female waitress would walk every time around the corner from the floor to the kitchen.  She would have a plastic smile on her face and every time she turned around the corner it would disappear to bigger frown.  Yes overworked and probably underpaid, as most the people are there, which reflects on the service and ambiance of the place.

My mom and I decided to have dinner here because she was in the mood for a dungeness crab and it wasn't too far from where we were.  I was afraid it would be overpriced and incredibly touristy, but it actually wasn't bad.  The decor was fun and casual and the atmosphere of the place was very nice.  It was Friday night, so I made reservations online to make sure we wouldn't wait too long.  Thank goodness we did!  When we walked in, the party ahead of us asked when the next available table would open up for walk-ins and they were told the wait was at least an hour and a half long!\n\nThat being said, we were seated immediately and had an attentive and very nice server.  We ordered a whole crab to share with a side of baked vegetables and garlic fries.  The crab was great because it was fresh and cooked in a delicious garlic sauce.  The vegetables had a sesame soy sauce that were all great and the garlic fries were absolutely delicious.  Everything was great and it was all more than enough food for 2 of us.\n\nMy mom even commented that she wants to come back to this place next time she visits!

All this fed 5 people happily.\n\nDig in. The crab was definitely the killer. Killed my hunger and could not be more pleased. It was so buttery and juicy. At times, I had some issues cracking them open and pulling out the meat, but it did not deter me from nibbling their little succulent legs.  The steamed clams here are probably the best clams I've ever eaten anywhere. The soup they're cooked in is so flavorful that dipping anything in there will be a plus. The garlic fries are hands down the best garlic fries I have ever had. I just wish garlic fries can be a so cal thing too. They're fried just right so that you don't get that heavy oily feeling afterwards. A tasty tip for the garlic bread or the regular bread they give you is to dip it in the sauce they cook the clams in! Oh my heavens!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-02", "description": "Preamble to the review:\nSkimming through the other reviews for the Crab House, I see most are written by people from outside of SF.  Given that this restaurant is ensconced deep in pier 39ness, I suppose I understand.  But, I've also sort of started to wonder, what is it that make a restaurant frequented by tourists (due to its location) such a hideous thing in and of itself?  Why are all things touristy assumed to be terrible, and what's so wrong with tourists anyway?  My favorite thing to do in life is travel, so I am usually a tourist in someone's country, even if I try to be low key and stay off the beaten path, etc.  Yet, when I can't travel, I find something exciting and exhilarating to be around those who are.  Sometimes, when I am feeling homesick for my own state of wanderlust, I head to Fisherman's Wharf and Pier 39.\n\nReview:\nToday's wanderings with my friend and her 15 month old took us to Musee Mechanique, to the sea lions, and eventually, we were hugry, so I checked Yelp to see what had better reviews, and we ended up at the Crab House.  \n\nAt about 5:30/6, there was a brief wait of about 15 minutes.  We sat in the bar area and admired the eclectic array of decorated crabs, a crustacean version of all those hearts that were all over SF a few years ago.\n\nAfter moving to our table, our server took our drink orders via one of those handheld remotes that automatically transmit to the bar and the kitchen.  I had a mojito, which actually didn't taste like it had much alcohol in it, but it was refreshing nonetheless.  After the server took our food orders, my friend's crab chowder appeared almost instantaneously- ahh the magic of sending information to the kitchen without having to go there.  I secretly wish I had had this when I worked at Chilis, many moons ago.  It is much more efficient to work with tables without having to run back and forth handing tickets over to the kitchen.\n\nAnyway, I had the Killer Crab, in and mid-90s southern California parlance, it was killer indeed.  The legs (I think Alaskan crab?  So says my SO, so boo for not local) were presented on a skillet glistening with garlicy butter sauce.  Mmmmmmm garlic and butter and crab.  MMMMMM.\n\nIt did get kind of stuffy in the restaurant until someone opened the windows, and while our service was ridiculously fast up front, it did take awhile to get our check, even after my friend had to take her toddler outside twice to avoid full on meltdowns.\n\nBut, overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my crab and will absolutely go back again, even if I have to drag my friends kicking and screaming to Pier 39.  What's more, I really liked hearing all the various accents of adjacent diners: it made me feel like I was somewhere else, if only for a moment.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

We walk in and my first impression was that it was a gimmicky and loud.  It is located on the second level of the pier, closest to the road (or beginning of the pier).  They have a small bar and a lively family-esque atmosphere.\n\nWe are seated in an elevated booth near the center of the restaurant.  We asked for a window view, but did not want to wait for one.  With the window views, you would have a table (not a booth) but with it comes views of the bay and golden gate bridge.  We each order a drink and note that the service is remarkably fast here.  Apparently they pride themselves on a quick turn to turn as much profit as possible to pay for what I'd imagine is a high rent being located on the pier.  We ordered the fried calamari appetizer as well which was superb.  They also served us three small loaves of nice bread.  This was served without butter, but olive oil and balsamic were already on the table.  I shared some of my girlfriends salad that came with hers and thought it was light and refreshing with a tasty dressing.  \n\nBefore bringing out our entrees, the server walks around and ties on their signature Crab House bibs to each of our necks.  Kind of fun and in tune with the loud and fun atmosphere of the place.\n\nI had the lobster thermador as my dinner entree.  This plate is huge, rich and tasty.  Cheese and butter on two lobster tails.  I have only had lobster in the shell with drawn butter in the past, so I was somewhat skeptical, but this was delicious.  Cooked to perfection; most lobster tails I have had in the past have been slightly overcooked.\n\nAlso at my table was a filet mignon and crab legs.  The filet was pretty good from the bite I tasted and the crab legs were also good.  Again with the crab legs, they do not serve with drawn butter.  My girlfriend was slightly disappointed by this, but she said they were tasty nonetheless.  I agreed with her consensus.\n\nWe all split the tiramisu for dessert.  It was sweet, slightly rich and very light.  Again, delicious.  \n\nSo, all in all I was very impressed by the food and service here.  Great for a fun night, but probably not recommended for a quite date.  I was expecting much less than they delivered, so that made the experience even better.  The prices were a bit steep, but not too crazy.  You have to expect to pay a premium while eating at Pier 39 in Fisherman's Wharf.", "author": "Benjamin P."}

Drinking, eating, and sleeping in a seemingly endless lethargically hedonistic cycle. Perhaps it was the glory of that weekend that makes me recall the Crab House so fondly, perhaps it was that I was just down to eat and pay (relatively) dearly for the pleasure. \n\nThe joint was packed when we arrived - to me this is usually a good sign. Although some think waiting for food is a fate worse than death, I see it as an omen of good, fresh food. To pass the 20 minute wait we slurped strong cocktails at the bar - pricey yes but I was pleasantly tipsy throughout the meal. \n\nWe ordered the crab cakes which were good and crabby. I don't remember too much of what others ordered but delicious pomme frit-ish fries were up in the mix some where and I gladly partook. I ordered the scallops and was quite pleased. \n\nAfter this meal I slept for hours and when I awoke I gave birth to a food baby..... so beautiful.", "author": "Sarah M."}

The crab chowder had corn in it, which was kind of weird.  but it came out medium/not warm temperature, so it that was one strike.  the bruschetta was actually pretty good, which is surprising at a CRAB house.  it came on garlic bread that was toasted. The bread they give you at the beginning comes in a paper bag/slip thing, and it even has the nutrition facts. oh yay.  And lastly.. our killer crab came out.  It smelled 10 times better than it tasted.  It was rather flavorless, they dont give you the body, and it is kinda pricey for what you get.  We also had a bloody mary.. which was un-spicy and came with an old piece of celery.\n\nService:  Okay, i really hate when i feel RUSHED at a restaurant.  The hostess was nice and got us seated quickly (because we had reservations), and even our waiter was nice.  The food came out RIGHT after we ordered it, we were barely able to get in a conversation.  and the second strike.. they started clearly our table before we were even finished eating.

Husband wanted to go to somewhere with a nice place to sit and enjoy the crab, so little stands on Pier 42(ish) were out of the question. When we walked in, we were quite taken by the view and the decor. It was clean, bright, even on a rainy day. Our server was quite pleasant. The table setup was efficient with water pitch, rack for placing the plate, a bowl for shells and all the utensils you will need to enjoy your crab. We didn't bother order anything else other than the crab so this review is based solely on the crab experience. \n\nWhen the crab came out, it was quite impressive. It was served on a very hot skillet. The shell had already been opened for us. Inside, it was smothered with a sauce of some sort. Our first impression with the crab was that it was too greasy. The sauce tasted good, but it also masked the taste of crab. When our waiter came by, I asked him how the crab was cooked. He told me that it was roasted with sauce and oil. We understand that some people like crab cooked this way, but we are not a fan. The meat was bit too dry for my taste and my stomach is still not happy with me 5 hrs after. We are sure their other items on the menu are good, we are just not a fan of their style of preparation. if you like heavily sauced crab, this is a good place for you.

Garlic noodles is good, we were not expecting that :). So a must order to partner with your crab. For the crab feast we like it just like how they serve it, with butter and lemon. It tastes good. I believe it's equivalent to 3 whole crab. It doesn't include any of the crab head so if you are like us who wants the fatty stuff from the head of the crab order the too two crab instead.

Through no fault of the restaurant, a large group was seated near us that was really loud. I believe they were celebrating a birthday and every couple minutes they would start shouting.

It is coming from the Crab House At Pier 39! \n\nLocation, location, location... located at the end of the Pier, level two, walk the plank for some of the most mouthwatering seafood you will ever eat.. The restaurant is very inviting with its aromas, beautiful views of the Bay, white linen tablecloths and an open fire pit to add that cozy, I am here to relax and enjoy feeling. \n\nI have a bad habit. When I am being seated, instead of smiling at patrons, while walking by, I am peering at their plates to see what they are eating! So trip me, at least I get a good feel for the food. \n\nWe are not talking inexpensive, but we are talking fresh and creative dishes that do not disappoint. Since there were four of us, we were able to sample quite a bit. of appetizers and entrees. \n\nBefore you even think of ordering, let me tell you, their bread is not to be skipped! We ordered and shared the garlic bread with fresh mozzarella melted on top, the cheese was optional, you can have the wonderful garlic bread without and I do believe they also had a Bruschetta. Why is the bread so important, is because it is a fine tool for lapping up garlic butter sauces or the clinging remains of your chowder. Looks better than licking the plates. \n\nIna Garten taught me years ago to roast my shrimp, even for shrimp cocktail, instead of putting it into water, which removes so much of the flavor. I even do this for my shrimp and potato chowder. The Crab House agrees with Ina, because they roast their shellfish and drizzle it with their secret garlic oil and serve it with a side of garlic, butter dipping sauce. I love secrets! I do believe shallots was one of those secrets in the sauce. \n\nThe mussels and shrimp served in a hot iron pan were to die for, some of the best mussels I have ever had. The Crab Chowder was loaded with flavor and crab. We didn't share the chowder, but we did share a wonderful Caesar topped with fresh Dungeness crab meat. \n\nTwo of us had the roasted Crab Legs. I am still dreaming about them. San Francisco is known for their fresh caught Dungeness Crab and not only are these fresh they are cooked and seasoned to perfection. We also ordered the crab cakes, very good and loaded with meat and the Zuppa di Pesce, which is a seafood stew with fresh crab and shellfish. You need more than a spoon to eat this, hands are required to remove shells from the shrimp. I had one bite and passed it along. It was very tasty, but too much playing with my food. If I had been at home, I would have held onto that bowl tightly.\n\nIf you love crab, like I love crab, you will want for nothing in the way of it here. Crab appetizers, stews, chowders, salads, pastas, in shell, crab enchiladas, hot crab melts and even an omelet. They also serve burgers, steaks and fish. \n\nWe did have to wait for our table, but they do have a lovely bar and lounge. I had one of their house specialty drinks, which was their own version of a Bloody Mary. I don't recall the name of it, but it was enough to turn you into, well,  wanting one everyday. \n\nThe Chef is from Italy and has several other restaurants in and around San Fran. When visiting some restaurants in a tourist area, you tend to feel like it is a cattle drive to get you in and out. You will not feel this here. Very friendly and competent service from the moment that you walk in and they tie bibs on you, once seated!. \n\nI highly recommend reservations and do ask for a window seat. Dress is casual elegance, remember this is a known tourist area.", "author": "DJ M."}

We were very disappointed with the food and price.  I'm sorry but $38.00 for a small sized crab is ridiculous.  It is crab season here and crab at restaurants are usually about $20.00-$25.00.  Our crab smelled a little like ammonia which means it was starting to rot.  We ordered a house gin & tonic which they charged us $10.00 for and an Anchor Steam beer was $8.00.  There are much better restaurants to go to in the area...STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!  Rip Off for sure!", "author": "Dan R."}

We ordered the medium iron skillet -roasted mussels, zuppa di pesce, crab cakes, and 3lbs of their Killer Crab.\n\nWithin several minutes of ordering, the crab cakes came out. I was a bit dissapointed at first. The dish is $15 and it only contained 2 small cakes, roughly 2\" in diameter and 1\" thick. Once i bit into it, however, I was thoroughly impressed. It was delicious and not drenched in butter like most other places. The exterior was seared to a nice crispy texture and the inside was moist and filled with dungeness crab flavor.\n\nThe Zuppa Di Pesce (mixed seafood stew) came out immediately after the crab. There were tons of seafoody things in there. Clams, mussels, squid, shrimp, etc., etc., and they were all bathing in a perfect stew. The stew even had a hint of spiciness to it. It drove me insane! in a good way.\n\nNext came the mussels and the crab. The mussels were great! When they brought it out to us they poured some kind of liquid all over the dish causing it to steam like a volcano about to erupt. The smells were phenomenal. The mussels were cooked to a perfection. None of the pieces i ate were rubbery at all and had the simplest most delicate flavor. \n\nThe crab was good. Not great, but good. The seasoning (roasted in their secret garlic sauce) was good and all but It was overcooked. It was very similar to asian style crab stir fry. I've definitely had better. \n\nAll in all. I'm very impressed with this place.The food was superb and the service was excellent; The wait staff was very attentive and quick. I definitely recommend this place!", "author": "chris s."}

Overall the food was very good, as my party of 3 ordered a two for too (??) crab feast which ended up consisting of two huge crabs.  The garlic fries were good as well.  The food was not the problem, because we ended up enjoying it very much.  \n\nNow, I'm not a picky diner or someone that generally gets upset over service, I'm not really that upset now, just insulted.  Apparently our order was misplaced to the table beside us, with two nice ladies, and they started eating away at one of our crabs.  About halfway through one of the crabs, they ask the bus boy where the shrimp portion of their meal was, since they had ordered the \"Crabs and Shrimp for Two.\"  After a few moments of confusion, it looked like he realized the mistake and took it back.  After returning with the ladies' actual entree, which appeared to be a completely different meal, I had a suspicion that he'd try to pull something on us by bringing out the previously eaten meal.  I suspended that suspicion for about the ten minutes it took for him to re-arrange the two crabs to make it look like they weren't touched, because obviously, I didn't think anyone could be that stupid to think that something like that would have worked?  Especially since we were dining right next to the table that he just picked that up from?  \n\nWhoops.\n\nSo of course he brings it out, and out of the corner of my I, I could see him conferring with his bus-boy buddies, smirking and giggling.  At first I could only see that two legs were missing, and I was going to let it go.  After taking the shell of one crab and noticing half of it eaten, with the entrails all mixed up, I had to say something.  Called him over to let him know that we knew what he was up to, and he came over with the same grin and a \"you-caught-me\" look.  \n\nIt's not upsetting, just extremely baffling and insulting.  Never thought that something like that would be within the realm of possibility, but people have a habit of surprising you.\n\nFood:  4/5 excellent, but pricy (68.95 for 2 big crabs that the three of us shared comfortably.)\n\nService:  the waitress was very nice, but didn't check up on us as much as we would have liked.  The pitcher was empty towards the end of our meal and we probably could have use some more water.  3/5 (minus 3 for the bus boy fiasco.)\n\nI think I'll average it out to a 2.", "author": "Tam V."}

Crab cakes, crab chowder and the signature Killer Crab (plus a salad that actually went really well with the crab cakes).  I was afraid it would be too much food and we wouldn't be able to finish it.  I'm not usually shy about taking home doggy bags, but considering the mini-fridge in the hotel was gonna charge us to put personal items in it, I wasn't keen on the idea of having leftovers.  I needn't have worried.\n\nThe Killer Crab came on a sizzling platter of garlic, butter, and olive oil sauce, which was perfect for dipping the relinquished crab meat.  Too bad for the crab that it went from being imprisoned in the shell only to find itself locked in my belly.  Delicious.  In fact, every last morsel of crab we ate was delicious.\n\nAfter we ate here, I saw ads for it in just about every tourist magazine, pamphlet, etc.  I felt slightly cheesy for having eaten there...but I didn't feel the least bit crabby.", "author": "Kristine R."}

Went here based on yelp reviews and left hungry and broke. \n \nOrdered: Crab chowder, fish and chips, angel hair lasagna and the mussel, shrimp and crab combinations.\n\nEvery one said that the crab chowder was really Good but sadly it had this cheese taste that I didn't like. It had a santa fe type of taste to it. The combination platter was subpar. there was not a lot of crab for about $30 and it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked. we are next to the pier all the seafood should taste delicious...come on...\nThe mussels, though, were delicious. The shrimps were not peeled so i had a hard time eating it. \nThe lasagna was very cheesy. I didn't like it at all. The fish and chips was okay because of the garlic fries. They use a bassa (catfish/bottom feeder) that did not taste fishy which I liked. \nNow here is what I hate...CRAP service. The service was horrible. The woman who served us didn't even have a smile. I had to ask her for water two times because the pitcher they gave us was empty. she also forgot our garlic fries that we ordered but we didn't even mention it because the food was so awful. This women was NOT personable. WHY was she a server?? Every question we asked was met with a mean/annoyed look and a monotoned answer. It was not even busy... and there was runners and bussers and all for her. COME ON.  GET A PERSONALITY.\n\nNOW for all this mediocre food and crap service I left with - $125. Seriously guys.. this is just a tourist attraction. DO NOT eat here just because you are on the pier. ITs obvious everyone who yelped this establish with high stars was blinded by propaganda or doesn't know real food.\nSO SAD!!\n\nand BTW -- that garlic sauce tasted like nothing.", "author": "Samantha H."}

This is basically an over priced tourist trap but we were hungry!\n\nIf you're not afraid of garlic then you have to try the garlic fries. They're slightly crunchy on the outside and they are smothered with garlic and grated parmesan cheese. \n\nThey only serve dungeness crab here so don't expect any snow crabs or anything else. I think the saving grace for their crab was the garlic sauce.  If you don't like to pick at the body of the crab for meat then don't  order the whole crab.\n\nI had the foggy wharf salad or foggy something with crab on top. It could have used a bit more of their soy vinegarette dressing but it wasn't too bad.  \n\nFor the gluten conscious, the crab and regular salad with the ginger dressing were the only thing close to gluten free.  The garlic fies are not gluten free because they're cooked in the same oil as something else that's battered.", "author": "Old W."}

Just 10 days prior to this I had major oral surgery. Why is this important to know? Please read on...I was only able to eat soft foods that I could basically swallow with minimal chewing. Mac and Cheese or mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs, ice cream, these were the easiest things to find on menus. \n\nMy Sister, Mother, Niece and I were hungry after shopping and sight seeing and thought we'd give this place a try. The girls ordered a bottle of wine, my niece and I had sodas and they got a large calamari and  order of crab cakes. All while we were deciding to eat for dinner. I already saw they had mac and cheese on the kids menu and was willing to pay whatever it took to eat SOMETHING. Our server, he's from Turkey, I don't recall his name, told me it was against their policy to let me order mac and cheese from the kids menu. TRUST ME SIR, IF I COULD HAVE HAD REAL FOOD I WOULD HAVE, anyway I sat there during my families dinner and ate nothing. We didn't want to leave since they already had their appetizers and wine and were looking forward to their crab but I just can not believe that they wouldn't serve me. I told them I'd pay them as much as a crab dinner cost I just wanted something that I could eat. I will advise my friends and family to find somewhere else to eat down at Fisherman's Wharf. I'm sure the crab is just as good if not better at one of the many OTHER places to eat down there. \n\nAs an example, I went to another restaurant and ordered mashed potatoes. I noticed that all of their salads were served with a hard boiled egg on top. I asked the server if I could get a couple of hard boiled eggs. I explained it was due to a medical condition, not that I didn't want their food it looked great and sure enough I got eggs. She hesitated at first because she didn't know how much they would cost but when my family got their meal I got my eggs.

But my question is? Did I order the wrong crabs? Because I tried some here and um, really? \n\nWas it good? Sure. It is hard to go wrong with a sizzling skillet of butter and garlic, but the crab had no taste to it. It wasn't sweet, salty, or any taste really? Just kinda bleh to blah.

Even wearing a bib I managed to get it all over me and that really wasn't a bad thing, since that is kinda par for the crab eating course, right?\n\nAs for the place. Well, it's a tourist trap.

I didn't really like where my table was placed, but I understand it was crowded and not easy to be as flexible given the occasion.

He was very good with checking in with us throughout Given it was so crowded. We ordered and were served within 15 mins, which was great. The food was good, (not super awesome as some other places I've been to), but it was worth the money spent. It's also sitting the water, so if you get a good seat, you'd get an even better experience. We spent only ~ $170. I liked this place, and the Cadillac margarita was nice! Kudos to the bartender on nye! Lol ;) if I ever go back though, I'd probably try a different side dish. I got the garlic noodles and added crab meat, which was good, but just as oily as others. I'd want to try the crab cakes. The actual dungeness crab was crispy on the outside, and moist inside.

Yes, someone else had used it!!\n\n2. I ordered the Cesear salad and the lettuce hidden on the bottom was all rotten. The chef had actually put rotten lettuce in my salad. If that is not bad enough the salad only had a sprinkling of dressing on half or one side of it. I was given something like 7 small whole romaine lettuce leaves (not cut up) that were just laid across the plate. They were mostly yellow and not green. They threw 4 small shavings of cheese on top and  added a piece of bread that was so hard I could not bite it. I am not joking.\nI was suppose to be given croutons. I guess this piece of stale hard bread was the crouton.  When I showed the waitress the lettuce she took it in the kitchen and came back and apologized and asked if I wanted some dessert!!! The dessert cost less than the salad and they did not offer to make a new one or give me my money back.\n\n3. The price of the food is outrageous. We bought one side salad, a few bowls of soup and two sandwiches and soft drinks and  Paid $149!  They added in an 18%  tip.  Yes, they automatically added in an 18% tip without saying anything to us about this policy. The waitress received a 20 dollar tip and did not deserve one penny! Is there a law again this?

Soon we ordered some grilled shrimp and crab, also a mozarella cheese starter.  The cheese bread wasn't anything special.  Warm, gooey but not especially tasty (4 mid sized pieces).  The crab and shrimp were brought out on a hot skillet and placed on a holder with a bowl underneath for the shells.  The crab was delicious, fresh, tender, buttery, seasoned well and just juicy!  The shrimp was prepared just right, very flavorful and you can choose from a few difference butter sauces and cocktail sauces to dip if you wished.  Oh and they give you a small bread for free, fairly ordinary but welcomed.\n\nOur server was nice but not amazing, efficient but a little slow.  Some of the plates had cracks in them, not something I'm a fan of.  Also the decor is cheesy/cheap and cute at the same time.

Situated within the midst of Pier 39, I would consider this to be a good seafood restaurant with an unbeatable location... whether for lunch or dinner. Along with the food, the service was certainly above par (our waitress was very professional).\n\nWhat stood out most about Crab House is its Dungeness Crab (aka. \"Killer Crab\"). The crabs were filled with juicy chunks of meat; they were noticeably fresh. Moreover, the crab's exterior was dipped in a hot, tasteful garlic sauce. The Clam Chowder was also very good; it had bacon and corn. Another favorite were the garlic fries. Overall, I would consider myself very content with Crab House (though for some reason, I am not compelled to give it five stars). Perhaps another visit would make me a bigger fan of this place.\n\nThe Dungeness crab is about $20 for a 1/2 order plus one pound. A whole crab (2 lbs) is about $35. They have a \"Crab Feast\" -- which is about $100; I saw a party of six order this and it appeared to adequately feed all of them (yeah, I couldn't help but look at all that crab...).", "author": "A B."}

We ordered popcorn calamari, a 1/2 lb of king dungeness crab (their speciality), and crab alfredo pasta. \n\nThe calamari was just ok - definitely could've been crispier. The crab alfredo was absolutely delish - soft pasta, creamy alfredo, and good-sized chunks of crab meat. And even though my hands got all dirty from cracking open those king crab legs, the juicy and tender meat on the inside was well worth the mess. \n\nSo even though it's a touristy place, I still really liked it!

(I mean, there are Hooters, Bubba Gump and Hard Rock Cafe) So, whenever I have friends and family visiting and I HAD to go to Fisherman Wharf, Crab House is usually my pick for a relaxing casual dinner by the bay.\n\nLike all other restaurants on the pier, the decor is hideous and looks like a theme park. The service, however, is always friendly and warm. It is one of those places where I like to go in when the sun is still there, and watch it sets as I am having dinner. Well I usually make reservation and ask for the booth table on the left end when you enter the restaurant.\n\nSome of the starters that I love are the raw oysters, crab stuffed mushroom, and oyster Rockefeller. They have very thick and hearty soup too. There are other clam chowder and sour dough place out there, but Crab House's are pretty good too.\n\nFor main, I recommend macadamia crusted mahi mahi. It is topped with mango salsa and served with crab rice and stir fried vegetables. Also, the lemon sea bass, with artichoke hearts, mushroom, and crab orzo. The Lobster pasta is good, if you feel like eating some carbs. They know their seafood, and they are very tasty. Of course, why go to Crab House, if you are not getting their steamed dungeness crab.\n\nAs I said before, it is a good place for casual dinner with visiting friends and family.

It was amazing. \n\nMy girl had issues working the crab cracker doodad, so I did most the work, and in that I had the garliciest fingers this side of the Mississippi.\n\nThe service was great and the everyone seemed to be genuinely having a great time working there.

But we didn't want to go too far from where our daughter was being looked after and Houston's looked like it was going to have its usual friday night 2 hour wait so...we ended up here.  The prices are steep but what else can you expect to pay for seafood in Fisherman's Wharf? Most of the menu items are available \"a la carte\" so don't expect your entrees to come with side dishes.  We ordered the whole crab roasted in garlic sauce for 2 ($49.95) which I wasn't so sure would be a hit with my bf.   He absolutely HATES sharing food with me because he never thinks that there will be enough for both of us even though I can never finish my own food.   But 3 lbs of crab??? Come on.  I think that's plenty for 2 people.  \n\nWe also ordered a ceasar salad ($9.95) which was not only crisp but had the perfect amount of dressing and fresh parmasean cheese distributed throughout. Excellent!  I'm sick of these overdressed ceasar salads that use iceberg lettuce and creamy dressing with those bland disgusting store bought crutons.  Yuck.  \n\nAfter the salad the crab came (along with the delicious crispy garlic fries we ordered...$10.95) and hilarity ensued.  The waitress handed us each a plastic bib....which we were both way too embarrased to wear.  I did just fine with out mine....my boyfriend did not. There were shells flying everywhere, and my hands were getting filthy!  By the end of our eating frenzy crab shells and stray pieces of crab meat littered the table, the booth that we were sitting in, and my boyfriends lap.  Definitely not a first date kinda place, unless you are both laid back and ready to get messy.  I realized that there really isn't a graceful way to eat crab.  Oh well.  We both enjoyed our evening, & our food.  I will definitely be coming here again.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Granted, we had a large party (14 people), but the management just has no clue how to run a business. After grossly underestimating our wait time at 30 minutes, the hostesses kept telling us that we'd be up \"soon\" whenever we inquired. We ended up waiting for 2 hours only to get totally fed up and leave for another restaurant. We complained to the manager, who told us that it \"wasn't possible\" to split us up into smaller tables as we watched party after party get seated before us. We had asked multiple times to be seated at smaller tables only to be deflected by the hostesses. SERIOUSLY? We were getting so hungry that we would have all sat at tables of 2 if only to get some effing food.\n\nYes, it was an obnoxious table of people who would not leave the restaurant for over an hour after paying their bill that was keeping us waiting. While I believe that karma will take care of those jerks, the fact that the hostesses and manager were doing nothing to \"encourage\" this party to leave after they were clearly done with their meal pissed us off big time. We had been waiting so long that one of the hostesses felt so bad that she brought us two baguettes to munch on while we waited. Great, we shared 2 baguettes among the 14 of us. Really helpful there.\n\nAn overall awful and time-wasting experience. We decided to take our business elsewhere after waiting for way too long, and that obnoxious group of diners still had not left.

We were able to sit next to the window, which wasn't that great as it was getting a little too hot.  When we first sat down I noticed that there was a handkerchief napkin under our table, I wouldn't have minded but since I was wearing sandals it kept running against my foot. So I thought they should have done a better job of cleaning up after the person before us.  \n\nThe food was great. I ordered 1/2 a crab, my bf fish and chips, and we shared a medium sized calamari dish.  The calamari was really good, the portion was large too, I would definitely recommend this dish to others.  My 1/2 a crab was okay, not as juicy or tasty as ones I've tried before, I would prefer Thanh Long's crab or PPQ Dungenous Crab. The fish and chips were pretty good too.  My bf's not a big fan of garlic fries so I think they should put on the menu that the fries that come with the fish are garlic fries, not regular fries.\nI also didn't like how we had to cut our own bread.  I'm not lazy, but you'd think they'd cut the bread for you so you don't have to do work while you eat.  Or maybe it was just the bread they gave us, but I had a hard time cutting it.\n\nDuring our meal a bee had flew past me and landed right next to me on the window.  So I wasn't enjoy my meal too much, as I was too busy focusing on the bee.  My bf opened the window hoping the bee would fly out, but it just stayed put.

Sun-burnt folks in air-Jesus sandals and Giants t-shirts, high(er) prices and lines at the restroom.  That said, it was a good place to eat and look out over the pier.\n\nLet's start with the good, though.  The mussels were great, and maybe the freshest ones I have ever had.  There weren't any gritty, dirt-like chews in any of them.  The crab legs were also very moist, and not over-cooked at all.  The service was excellent, too.\n\nThings I would suggest if you go; ask for them NOT to salt the mussels or crabs at all.  You might save money on getting a bottle of wine instead of drinking by the glass.  Also, be aware there is no Miller Light (a local favorite with Maryland Blue crabs---and yes, we brought our own Old Bay).  Be prepared to drop about 1hundy if you're hungry and thirsty.", "author": "Andrew A."}

Having a place like the Crab House available for reservations was exciting. I admit though, my craving is still not satisfied.\n\nPros:\nHad the best server ever. I should have asked his name so that I could give him a shout out. He was attentive, quick, efficient, and professional. Before my husband could finish the last sip of his soda, they had delivered him another. Our drinks and salads came out right away. All of our questions were answered patiently and knowledgeably. We were also advised well when we'd ordered enough food.\n\nIron skilled roasted shrimp were good. Pretty flavorful. The clams were okay. One was served closed which is a no-no.\n\nWhere they fell down just a bit:\nThe salads are huge! The caesar salad was good but definitely too much for one person. My husband enjoyed his garden salad but it was too garlicky for my tastes to the point where the tomatoes tasted like garlic.\n\nThe bread got hard really quickly. The garlic bread was good but they didn't advertise that there was fresh Parmesan and my husband doesn't eat cheese. So I had to eat all of the bread :).\n\nI had a 1/2 roasted garlic crab. It was a little less than 1/2 and was served on a sizzling skillet which I think overcooked the crab legs a bit. Also,I didn't taste the garlic (maybe they'd put it all in the tomatoes), I mostly tasted oil/butter. They could cut that down a bit.\n\nThey are also pretty pricey. \n\nRecommendations from my husband/dinner companion: Modernize it a bit, make portions smaller and then maybe they can lower the prices.\n\nAll in all, it was good, not great. I've had better crab at Absinthe and Crustaceans.", "author": "s n."}

Being a native nocal person I don't visit many of the restaurants at the pier39 tourist trap, since most of the restaurants are SO expensive. We had 5 adults and 2 kids, so we ordered 3 killer crabs, mussels, crab chowder, crab cakes, garlic fries and some drinks. The crab was just ok. But for the price, I'd rather go to costco and buy 10 lbs of alaskan king crab legs and grill them up myself. At least I'd be stuffed. the crabs aren't that filling so if you plan on coming here, stop by mcd's or something because you won't leave here full unless you drop some serious cash.  The mussels were ok. The crab chowder was mediocre. The crab cakes weren't anything to write home about and the garlic fries were just the run of the mill. Just a very disappointing meal.

My husband and I had 9 pm reservations on a Friday night thinking that the place would be packed. We got there and found that there were only 4 other groups and automatically we thought, \"Score! We'd get awesome service\" since the wait-staff only had 5 parties they should be able to focus on each customer. \n\nBoy were we wrong! Our waiter's name was Burak and normally I wouldn't put someone on blast but this guy was ridiculous! He had us and 2 other parties. We waited for 20 mins. before he came to take our drink orders and then another 20 mins to take our food orders AFTER we told him that we were ready to order with our drinks! He said he'd be right back but he took his sweet time flirting with the table of women. He actually sat with them and had a major chat fest including his lack of sleep due to non-stop partying. Meanwhile my husband and I are getting impatient and ask for another waiter, apparently they only had one at the time. So our food FINALLY came out and it was brought out by a busboy who barely spoke English...lucky for us I speak Spanish and was able to communicate our needs. \n\nThe food is ok...the mussels were awesome but the \"Killer Crab\" is completely over-rated. It's not that great. I've had better at Joe's Crab Shack or some hole in the wall Chinese restaurant! Seriously for really good crab you need to go to Redondo Beach and check out Captain Kidd's! The crab chowder isn't all that it's made out to be. I've honestly had better. \n\nUltimately I was so upset that I didn't even want to pay the tab for the medium mussels, 3 lbs of crab, crab chowder, and drinks but in the end I did and left a crappy tip. As a former waitress I know how important it is to tip so I did it but I made sure to write on the receipt that the BUSBOY was awesome.\n\nI thought maybe I'd give it another chance someday until I called back the next day to complain to the General Manager. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. I called prepared with my transaction number and receipt. I told the GM calmly and rationally that I wasn't looking for reimbursement I simply wanted him to know about his crappy service and the GM Joseph cut me off and said,\" I'm sorry, next time ask for me directly and I'll take care of you\" Click! Didn't get my name or number just CLICK! So quite frankly in my opinion this place can pick a cheek and kiss my ass.", "author": "Angela S."}

I had the whole crab.  It didn't have much garlic flavor, mostly just lots of  butter (or olive oil) coating.  The crab was cooked fine, it's just there wasn't any explosion of flavor ($37 crab I expected more).  Boiling Crab in SJ is SO much better.  Kids all had the fish&chips.  That was very tasty and good sized filet of fish.  My wife had the Crab Louie salad.  Very little crab meat in it and it was just OK.  The appetizer (fried calamari) was tasty but the sauce given wasn't a  traditional cocktail sauce or aioli, it was some kind of sweet bell pepper sauce.  Not tasty with calamari at all, in my opinion.  This is SF, so why were we served cold soft/chewy sourdough rolls?  They should be hot with a good crunchy crust.  On the plus side, service is prompt and courteous.  Bar service is very quick.  The decor is very cool (colorful decorated crabs all over the place.  My son laughed at this French crab with a beret and a goatee).  I'd say I'd recommend Crab House for taking an out of town guest to, if you we're already at Pier 39, but as a deliberate dining destination, probably not for us again.  Glad I got to go though.

The waitress finally decides to join another small table.  We fit but we were REALLY close to the customers next to us.  The middle aged woman next to us rolled her eyes in disgust to our close proximity.  Anyways the waitress was really accommodating and didn't throw an attitude they were just a bit disorganized considering we had made reservations.\n\nWe ordered crab, calamari( the popcorn calamari was really good), mussels and shrimp.  The food was good however I don't like the fact that you don't get any sort of side with your dish.  You get crab... or shrimp or shrimp and mussels wtf? No veggies no mashed taters... They only offer it if you want to pay more on top of their steep prices.  \n\nAnother bad thing.  I was planning on tipping the waitress between 20-25% but I noticed they had already helped themselves to a 18% tip... I figured the 18% mandatory tip is to protect the waitresses from tourists who come from places where tipping isn't too customary.   It discouraged me from tipping more.  Overall an alright experience but I hate the pier 39  area so my expectations weren't too high.", "author": "Omar V."}

In our group of 5, one went with a pasta dish and the rest of us went with the giant crab dinner for 4.  I don't know what they did to that crab, but the combination of butter, garlic, and whatever else, baked to perfection, was amazing.  Honestly some of the best crab I've ever had.  The mojito was pretty good too.\n\nNow, the reason I only gave 4 stars: the service was lackluster at best.  Don't get me wrong, the hostess and our waitress were both very friendly, they just weren't very helpful and never around when you needed them.  For one thing, we had to ask for more bread (most places offer) but that wasn't a huge deal.  What was a problem was that once our food came, we didn't have our crab-eating utensils.  The waitress was nowhere to be found, so we ended up having to grab them from another table.  Then, after finishing our mojitos, we were ready for another, but again, nowhere to be found...we never got that second drink.\n\nI've probably just made it seem worse than it is, or maybe it was partly due to the fact that we were there later in the evening, but still, it was slow so I'd expect attentive service.\n\nProblems aside though, this was some amazing crab.  It will definitely set you back a bit, but I'd say it was worth the price.  Delicious crab, a good view off of Pier 39, and in my case someone else paid.\n\nI should also note that after leaving feedback at OpenTable, we received a very apologetic response from the manager, so they get a little props for that as well.\n\nAll in all, a pretty solid 4 stars.", "author": "Matt N."}

It's so filling, you don't need the bread that comes with it, and I would suggest plopping down the cash for the whole crab.

Lots of cute decorated crabs to look at while waiting for your food.  It's definitely nice and cozy when the weather outside is cold and rainy.  Unfortunately, their seating is cramped.  I mean cramped like made for skinny people who don't have winter coats on.  Service isn't stellar, but not bad considering the location.  It's a little pricy, but what can you expect in tourist central?\n\nOn to the food.  We ordered a side salad (not drenched in dressing - good job) and the crab chowder, which was surprisingly good.  It was stuffed full of veggies and crab, so tasted more like a stew. Also shared the crab feast for 4, and ended up feeding 5 of us.  There was plenty of claws, and big meaty chunks to share.  The crab was really tasty, and some meaty parts were crispy... which was good and bad at the same time since everything was drenched in butter.  Our hands were all glistening from all the oil and butter - I'll admit, I was pretty turned off by that and started back on the bread and chowder.  Not sure if that's why I coudn't tell if the crab was fresh or not, but at least it was tasty.

Walk up and continue past three other restaurants, I think, until you see the restaurant painted on the side of the building.\n\nEveryone raves about the seafood in SF and from the yelp reviews, this seemed like a good place to start especially for crab.  Opentable did not have any reservations for the time we planned on eating, but we walked in (party of 2) and were seated immediately around 1:00pm on a sunny Sunday afternoon.  So if you don't see any open times in Opentable, just give them a call for an estimate on time.  When we left, there were more people waiting, but I overheard white times were only 15-20 minutes.\n\nNow, for the food critique.  My wife and I shared a whole dungeness crab (which is what they claim to be famous) in a buttery, garlic sauce.  Also, we ordered a bowl of the crab chowder and garlic french fries.  I don't have as much experience with dungeness crab as I do with snow, king, and stone crabs but I must say that was very good.  I had to dip each piece of meat in the delicious sauce.  As for the crab chowder, I was hoping for something a bit creamier, but it was decent enough although I probably would not order it again next time.  My wife loved the garlic fries and scarfed most of the small portion which was sufficient for sharing.  I can't say that this was as good as some of the top seafood places I've dined at in Chicago and Seattle.  But, I was very happy at the end meal and will go back.  To top it off, the service was very attentive and friendly and the view next to the water was pleasant and bright.  \n\nPrices were not unreasonable for SF, but I will say that I'm NOT a fan of the 4% mandatory health care waiter tax that they add on top of the sales tax which you have to check for when you dine anywhere in the bay area (and maybe rest of Cali?).

My wife and I got the small shrimp appetizer and the crab for two and a small side of garlic fries. It was plenty of food for us. We take our crab eating very seriously and we probably looked like crazy people eating the stuff but who cares when it is this good. its also a good thing the put bibs on us or we would have been a mess.

We have a party of 4 and a kid. Initially we thought we didn't want to spend too much so didn't go with the Feast. However after ordering the $49 3lb portion, we knew it's too little and regretted not ordering the full skillet. We ended up ordering another full crab, and they still look much less than what other tables got for the $100 portion.\n\nI have to take one star away because this place is way too expensive. This is suppose to be the crab season, and why do they charge the same whole year round? $80 for 2 1/2 crabs is way way too much. We sat by the window and there was not much to see either.", "author": "Ling H."}

So I made a reservation in advanced through Open Table. It appears that you can only make reservation for time slot prior to 6 pm or after 9 pm. So we decided to have 5:30 pm early dinner.\n\nI think we made the right decision as not only we beat the crowd, we also get a nice window table with 4 chairs next to bay for a 2-perons party. The view is great and a lot of spaces as there is extra space next to the window where you can put all the condiments, and water pitcher there instead of occupying your table.\n\nThe food is nice. We ordered the double shrimp and crab skillet. Also have a bowl of crab chowder. The bowl is large. So the $9.99 is really worth it. It is tasteful with a lot of crab meats. Also the crab in the skillet is well cooked with just right seasoning. \n\nFor the service, the waitress is not very polite in the beginning. Originally we misread the menu and thought we can order mussel, shrimp and crab in the same skillet. The menu said \"Double mussel or shrimp & double crab\". So we miss the 'or' word. So  we initially ordered \"double mussel AND shrimp and double crab\". Instead of explaining our misunderstanding to us, the waitress simply said \" we don't have that\". and just stand there looking at us. So we were a bit confused. Then suddenly my wife get it. She said, \"oh, OK, then just \"Shrimp & double crab\". The waitress still said \"no, we don't have that\". So we ask what she meant. She eventually said \"you can either have \"Double mussel and double crab\" or \"DOUBLE shrimp and double crab\". We were like \"duh!\". What happens to customer is always right?? You can explain to us. But no need to behave like we are stupid or do not understand English. It really spoil our happy mood for the day so far.\n\nWe were a bit annoyed. But later on the waitress seems to make a full turn and become very nice. She even helped us to cut the crab in half when it came. So we kind of just let go those bad feeling as we were on holiday mood.\n\nAnyway, the food is 5 star. The 1 star off is really because of the not so professional service.", "author": "Chun L."}

I got Cioppino (mixed seafood). It was $25 , no salad or others extras. The quality of the seafood and freshness was very good. Given the location, the quantities were generous. The sauce was a little bland and there was no crusty bread served, which SF sourdough fresh form the oven would have been perfect. The served bread what a white roll soft and not overly flavorful. One of the BEST aspects of the restaurant was the $4.95 corkage which is the lowest I can remember seeing in decades.

The place just looks a little tired.\n\nI have eaten at the other restaurants owned by this group and have always really loved them.  This is nothing like Bobos or Franciscan.  The quality of the food is totally different.  Definately geared to a tourist, who will only be eating there once.  Like the tourists I will only be eating there once.\n\nWe had mussles and shrimp on the skillet.  The muscles were pretty dry and the shrimp were very small,  I think they were frozen, not fresh.  One of my friends had the crab for a main course, that looked pretty good.  Two of us had the sand dabs,  they were ok, sort of over sauteed in butter, but tasty.  The presentation was also bad,  The bread was not even good.  How can you be at Fishermans Wharf and not have good french bread.\nMy friend asked which manager was on duty because since he sends lots of business to them, or has until now, wanted to meet a manager.  our waiter said all 4 managers were on duty tonight.  Well no manager ever came over.  As we were leaving we mentioned it to the host, that he was disappointed that he was not able to meet a manager, and the host said yeah it was too bad but they were just too busy to meet customers,  The whole thing was strange.\nAnyway, if you are visiting SF and want dinner on the water you can do so much better.", "author": "Trevor S."}

However, the views are awesome and definitely worth the extra price. It is not a local spot just one that you would come to for a special occasion. Situated on the Sea Lion side of the Pier.  Their use of garlic here is evident. Garlic Fries are awesome but you must have the 3lb of crab in the special garlic sauce(meant for 2 to share)!! My wife and I love crab so this will rival many good seafood restaurants. The crab chowder, steamed clam appetizer, and also the cioppino are excellent. I would recommend this to any crab lover and I will definitely go back.", "author": "Jonathan Q."}

But is is also  some of the tastiest crab I have had.  Perfectly done and even better when washed down with some local brews, as the wine list isn't that extensive and beer would be easier to drink with the dish.  We also noticed that everyone was eating the garlic fries, so I thought what the hell.  After the first bite, I thought that these were the best garlic fries around!  Seems simple enough to have crisp fries with garlic that ain't raw.  But very few places seem to get it right.  Finally, they also have an excellenet salad with grilled shrimp.

I had been here in the past and I thought that the food was great, so I decided to revisit this spot and left extremely dissatisfied. Granted the views are great since it overlooks the bay, but that was hardly enough to compensate for the poor food. We ordered the crab bisque, crab sandwich, and crab pasta; all three were superbly bland. Even the house ale was not enough to warm my heart towards the food. Could this poor food have been because we did not order the crab, but rather derivatives thereof ? That is and shall continue to remain a mystery since I will not be back here any time soon. Sadly enough, this is one part of San Francisco I do not want to leave heart in.", "author": "Friedrich H."}

The crab chowder is great - unbelievably thick with loads of vegetables and lump crab meat. The veggies still maintain some nice bite, so you're still able to identify what each veggie is. There is a nice hint of spice - not too much to overpower the delicate crab, but enough to feel a kick. The killer crab is juicy, piping hot, and easy to eat. I did find that it was a bit salty for my taste and I'm not really a butter lover. All in all, the Crab House is a good place to go (if you're in the area) but for real crab lovers, I would hit up PPQ Dungeness Crab instead.", "author": "Joanne T."}

I saw other tables get this sizzling mussel plate which looked really good except that some of the butter spewed and splashed out. That seemed like a really popular dish.

The bus boys there were really nice too. \nWe ordered 2 sodas, half order dungeness crab, seared scallops, lobster thermidor and a cup of crab chowder.

But if I was truly trying to \"feel the mood\", probably not. But yes, super speedy!\n\nNow to review the food:\n\n-The seared scallops was alright. It was good, but not great.\n-The crab was good. But I would have to agree with the others who didn't understand what all this rave is about on Yelp. Because it just tasted like regular crab. Yes, there was some special garlic sauce to it, but the crab is cooked in the shell, so...... it wasn't anything special. Order the 3 lbs. for a better value (50$) because theres a lot more to eat. The half order only consists of a few crab legs and a claw or two.\n-The lobster thermidor was pretty darn good! I especially like the middle part where the cheese is all melted in. \n-The crab chowder was also delicious.\n\nWould I go back again? Yes, but because I still want to try the crab cakes.

A yummy Caesar salad also was a hit.  The only lacking dish was the clam pasta in a white sauce.  The clams were fresh but the white sauce was nothing to write home about.

When we got to the pier, I left my reviews in the car and was subject to my memory (not good after partying all night before), but remembered the Crab House and the good reviews.  I'm usually leery of tourist trap areas and food, but we were thoroughly impressed with this restaurant.  We arrived around 3pm, and though crowded, they still managed to squeeze us in and get a high chair for the little guy.  My granddaughter loved the crab art all over the restaurant, that is, colored, artistic crabs of all sorts and designs kept her really busy.  Server gave her crayons and coloring paper to occupy as well.  Server was really nice and attentive.  We had nice seating next to window with a nice view of the pier and water.\nThis is the place for crab dishes and crab! I ordered the crab cioppino, without the shell, (could order it either way), though not a huge serving, it hit the spot and could have used a bit more crab, but was okay as we ordered the famous \"killer crab\" roasted in garlic and butter.  It was a nice size crab, hot and the sauce permeated the meat.  My granddaughter even enjoyed it with her mac n cheese and she never ate crab before.  The fish and chips was ginormous! One huge piece of white fish with a light batter, not the kind that you find elsewhere with super thick batter and thin fish.  The crab enchilada dish was huge in my opinion, 2 enchiladas filled with crab using flour tortillas.  Refills on the drinks, complimentary mini french bread with oil and balsamic.  All kinds of hot sauce available.  Prices are what you'd expect in SF and being a crab house in a tourist spot, I was okay with it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-11", "description": "This was our favorite pick of places while in SF. Spent three nights there and ate here the first two. You have to serve pretty good food to get me to eat at the same place two nights in a row. You have to serve pretty good seafood to get me excited about seafood. I will say, without hesitation, if you do not like this place, you just don't like seafood. Despite the fact that this is in a tourist area, they serve damn good crab. Both nights we got the 2 person crab pile. It was more than enough for two people. It came out on a HOT skillet with buttery garlic, salt and pepper sauce. I did not, find the sauce overwhelming. Garlic fries, as many have said, are amazing. Tons of garlic and a little parmesan cheese. A 'small' order was way too large for two people. It compliments the crab very well, by the way. Also good was the crab chowder, big pieces of crab in a good rich sauce. I can also comment that the beer is 'great.' They serve pitchers of beer that are significantly larger than the standard pitcher. They are the large stainless steel 'bell' shaped pitchers. At least 6 full pints in that thing. A true bargain at $20. Service was great. They seemed very good about getting us the food, then leaving us alone. Most waiters, at other places, stop by when you've got crab up to your elbows and a mouthful. They seemed very adept at keeping an eye on their customers. The decor isn't great in here. But we found it to be a reasonably decent atmosphere. I don't like all the red and red lighting. It made me feel like I was the crab being roasted. The prices are 'high' but you totally get what you pay for. So it's a great bargain. One night, there was a table near us with a few ladies, one of them had a shellfish allergy. The staff went absolutely out of their way to make sure she didn't get anything that a shellfish touched. (I wonder why they went in the first place... but anyway.) Says a lot about the staff. That's quite a request to make in a CRAB HOUSE afterall. They were more than willing to comply. So, to sum up, if you like crab (and I know you do, since you're reading this) eat here. This could quite possibly be one of my new, all time favorite places. Absolutely insanely good crab and large portions. 5 HUGE stars for this place, folks.", "author": "Matt R."}

You can do better with your 80 bucks. \n\n1. sizzling shrimp and mussel - SALTY SALTY SALTY, they want to kill people? Both shrimp and mussel are overcooked. I can't taste anything with this much salt. \n\n2. killer drab - Again, they killed us with SALT. The crab is fresh but not impressive because of the poor seasoning.\n\n3.  crab chowder - It's the only dish we think it's OK.\n\n4. crab cake - There are only 2 small crab cake in a big plate. Each one is only slightly bigger than a chicken nugget and it costs 14.99? We were shocked when we see the dish. \n\n4. bread - it's cold and hard. However, it's one of the better taste dish since there is not much salt with it. \n\n5. Service - The waitress never said \"hi\", \"bye\" or \"is there everything OK?\", \"how's the dish?\" to us. I had very hard time to catch her for some extra napkins. Overall, the service is as bad as the food. \n\nWe left with the empty stomach and wallet (yes, all servings are small but the bean size of crab cake is the highlight. ).  Damn, I should believer in my old belief - NEVER GO TO THE RESTAURANT IN THE TOURIST AREA WITH OCEAN VIEW.  I never got anything good out of this kind of restaurants.\n\nI'm a big fan of crabs. Here is my advice if you really want to get a tasty crab but  don't want to cook yourself. Go to any big Chinese restaurant that there are the big glass tanks with live seafood. They will pick a live one out of the tank and cook whatever way you like for about 25 bucks.", "author": "Hk K."}

The Killer crab was excellent, the garlic butter source was savory, you could literally dip anything in it and it would have tasted heavenly.  Tiramisu was good but a bit small in portion.\n3. Ambience: 4 stars\nNear the entrance there's a unique island like brick table with a fire burning in the center, it radiates warm and comfort in a cold night.  The tables were of Marble top, clean and modern, sitting is a little tight and you might bump shoulders with your neighbor.

And my friend said her Cosmo was pretty strong for an afternoon drink =) My only complaint was that once our food was served and the waitress checked on us once more she didnt really come back that much more and I actually had to ASK her to get me another drink.

The nice thing about TCH was it was upstairs, away from the craziness of Pier 39 and sitting by the window, you can almost forget that you're at Pier 39.  The other nice thing about it was the waitstaff was discreet--they periodically came by but left us alone.\n\nFood was good but pricey.  We ordered the crab cakes (2 for $14.95!!!), Caesar salad with crab (~$18), and the seafood stew (forgot what it was called on the menu) which went for $19.95 for a small tureen.  The crab cakes were good--full of crab and crispy (I thought they were a bit greasy) served with a light white sauce on top and some pickled zucchini on the side.  My bf liked his Caesar salad--lots of big chunks of crab.  My seafood stew was good, and if I hadn't had the same thing at The Dead Fish in Crockett, I would have loved this--one of the reasons why I gave TCH 3 stars rather than 4.  The seafood stew had calimari, salmon chunks, and mussels served in an extremely hot tomato-y stock.  The stew was so piping hot that it took me about 1.5 hrs. to eat most of it.\n\nOther reasons why I gave it 3 stars rather than 4: the menu was limited--it was more extensive at The Dead Fish; the view as more spectuacular at The Dead Fish, and I liked the seafood stew much better at The Dead Fish--there was more seafood variety in the stew--there were other fish, clams, and even a crab claw there.\n\nTo sum it up, if I were in the area, I would probably go there again if I wanted seafood, but I wouldn't necessary go out of my way to go there.", "author": "Aggie A."}

Everyone except me ordered the crab chowder and apparently I missed out. That was everyone's favorite. The bread came out small cold and hard. Everyone had their meals served and I was still waiting for mine 10 minutes later. I ordered the sizzling shrimp and crab combo but since it was never brought out to me on time, it was brought out NOT sizzling and some parts were cold. I wasn't expecting to have to clean my own shrimp so I didn't much care for that part. The crab was good though so that made up some. I still think there are much better places you can go to for crab though and for less money. Oh yea, the waitress never brought us any soda refills and I think she forgot us for awhile too.

So I knew we needed to stop at a crab house during our vacation.  I chose Pier 39 not only for the crab but also because of their mojitos.  We arrived and immediately ordered a couple of the mint libations.  Joe of course had his eyes on the dungeness crab that feeds two.  Once we placed our order, the waiter tied a bib around my neck.  I am not ashamed to be a grown woman who wears bibs.  The occasion called for it.  The crab came out snap crackle and pop hot on a hot plate.  And instead of doing the melted butter dip, Crab House likes to smother the crab in garlic.  Once the hot plate hit the table, we started cracking the shell open to get to the meat.  The crab meat and garlic was unbelievably good.  Garlic with crab is way better than butter.  Not sure if it's healthier but who cares.  In the end, I would like to thank Crab House for the wonderful mojitos and crab feast.", "author": "Myra R."}

And I'm glad I did, thanks to yelp. :) Today my boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner. We wanted a light dinner for the two of us since we weren't that hungry, and so we decided on Garlic Noodles and a cup of Crab Chowder to share. We were given two small cute loaves of french bread a few minutes after we sat down, and the bread was made with organic unbleached flour! I was really happy about that. The food was AMAAZZZINGGG! The BEST pasta and chowder I've ever had. The Garlic Noodles were to die for, tons of fresh garlic (but not overpowering), and parmesan cheese. The chicken was also encrusted with garlic, and cooked perfectly! The noodles seemed like they were made fresh. I recommend soaking everything up from your bowl after eating the pasta with the french bread, OMG! Don't leave that amazing garlic sauce to waste. Everything was so light, fresh, but so flavorful as well! Yumyumyum, it was excellent. And the Crab Chowder was great too. I was expecting a heavy chowder like many chowders served in Pier 39, but no! This chowder was light, full of vegetables and chunks of crab, and it too was amazing! The only downside is that they don't serve it in a bread bowl, which would've been more amazing! But I guess the little loaves of french bread make up for it. We were full, but not too full, and completely satisfied with our meal by the end of it. There was nothing left in our bowls!

Even though my SF friends warned me not to eat around Pier 39 as most are over-priced and average food, we took a chance because it seems highly recommended.  You Yelpers let me down on this one.  Why?!!  My family (3 adults, 1 child, 1baby) was hungry for some crabs so Crab House was chosen over the Neptune place.  here's what we ordered:\n\nCrab cakes (two tiny DRY crab cakes ), 1 star\nLimp & over-dressed salad, 1 1/2 stars because the portion was slightly better)\nShrimp linguini (I swear, the sauce came right out of a can), 1/2 star\nMacaroni & cheese (macaroni being same pasta as our shrimp linguini), 1/2 star -- underflavored & low-quality cheese even my hungry 7-year-old with low expectations took only a few bites\nCrab, ahh the crab that we were there for, 1 1/2 stars -- dry, over-cooked.  The meat should've come right off if it had been juicy, but kept breaking off.  The galic sauce was soooo salty, we couldn't get past the other flavors\nSide note:  We noticed that other tables got bread where we did not.  It took us 20 minutes to get our bill.  And they charged us automatically for tips.  This is why they don't care about their crappy service because they feel that the tourist would only visit them once.   If I could give zero rating, I would.  I don't know why some people are recommeding this place.   Are you invested in this place or have family members working at Crab House?   This place sucks!

The butter sauce was flavorful, unlike many plain butter dipping sauces found at other crab places. Service was prompt and courteous. The beer menu was decent, although I wad confused by one selection name, \"recer 5.\" Is this to be a clone of Bear Republic's racer 5, or did they just mispell it? Regardless, I plan to go back and enjoy many crabs at this excellent establishment in the future.", "author": "Ryan G."}

The garlic and other spices are there for your tasting and actually make it through the shell.  Some other places, you just taste the spices from the outside and it never  makes it inside to the meat.  Of there are mostly tourists but hey they need to eat and they bring in lots of money into our city.  Plus we all are tourist at one point or another.  We went on a week night and it was raining so business was slow so we got in no problem. We had the lobster salad was a little heavy on sesame dressing.  Overall, not bad and the mussels were delicious.", "author": "Eric c."}

The crab here is cooked perfectly and served in a buttery garlic sauce which is delicious. Anytime I need a crab fix, this is where I end up. We generally order a caesar salad to split (it is WAY too big for one person). I think this salad is great since they send it out in full crisp romaine leaves lightly tossed in the dressing with nice pieces of parmesan shavings. The Crab House also serves these little sourdough loaves of Acme bread which are perfect to soak up the garlic butter sauce that the crab comes in. It is in a touristy location, but do not let that keep you away. It is actually kind of nice to eat some delicious crab and also see all the different people who come to enjoy our great City! Another cool thing is that since it is at Pier 39 they have their menu printed in many languages.", "author": "M S."}
