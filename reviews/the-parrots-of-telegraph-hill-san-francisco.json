{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-24", "description": "** UPDATE **\nApparently the guy who originally started feeding the parrots (and  a small band of supporters) thinks it's an unnatural travesty to feed them since it's not just him doing it anymore. Ducks are just fine, but not the parrots. The board of supes has illegalized the practice of feeding the parrots. Most of the time, I love living in such a liberal city. This is not one of them. There was nothing wrong with humans interacting with these amazing birds and feeding them. Score one for the \"protectors of wild animals.\"\n\n** ORIGINAL REVIEW **\nIt's kinda like an Alfred Hitchcock movie, except the birds are pretty and they're nice to you instead. I've never had so much fun with birds crawling all over me. It's really a LOT of fun, a great thing to bring out-of-town friends to see. The park fills up with them a little while before sunset. They all congregate there to go to sleep at night. \n\nIf you want them to swarm you, here's what you do:\n1) Get two forks from your kitchen drawer. \n2) Buy a few apples and cut them in half.\n3) Go to the park at the corner of Clay and Drumm at about an hour before sunset.\n4) Stab a half apple at a time onto each fork and pretend you're a scarecrow.\n\nThis is one of those things that makes you glad to be an SF resident. I've been to feed the parrots about 5 or 6 times now, and can't get enough of them. It's also a really good workout. Your arms will get pretty tired holding up all the parrots after five minutes or so. Oh, also, you'll want to wear a hoody or be sure not to let one of them get bored if it's on your shoulder. They like to nibble, the way you might imagine an animal with a sharp vise for a mouth might nibble. If they don't have food to chew on, then ears will do. It's not out of malice, more curiosity than anything. Just the same, it hurts.\n\nIf you're entertaining kids or adults, this is an experience they'll remember. I'll add a few pix to my profile for this one.", "author": "Mike W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-18", "description": "Whether you're a Bird Watcher or Owner, Visitor or local Bay Area resident, these wild Cherry Headed Conures are a special part of San Francisco to experience. \n\nAfter sharing Telegraph Hill with my winged neighbors, The Flock*, over the last year, I feel I owe it to these acrobatic characters to share a bit of the joy that they bring to my daily life. Every morning and afternoon they fill the skies with a green flurry of wings. It's a cacophonous and cheerful sound that always makes me smile and wish that I understood their secret language. They even inspired us to get a telescope for a closer look at them perched on the Redwood tree outside the window. I really do miss Molly, my Senegal Parrot. However, The Flock is just the right amount of \"pet\" for me--close enough to watch and enjoy their silliness and chatter AND landlord approved! \n____________________________\n\nHere's some basic facts:\n\nFlock Behavior:\nWhether they are playing, eating, or flying, everything they do is within the safety of The Flock or smaller sub-flock groups. Throughout the years, this local parrot group has been known to socialize with other species of birds, such as Parakeets (aka Budgies) and Blue Headed Conures. However, they have remained primarily 1 species: Cherry Headed Conures (also known as Red Masked Conures). The flock depends on safety within healthy numbers. If one of them is sick or injured, they will most likely abandon/hurt that member.\n\nPreening: \nBirds' feathers need to be straightened from the base of the feather to the tip on a daily basis. They do this with their beaks. Preening is a social thing for parrots and often times when they partner up this is a bonding activity. For example: domesticated birds will often try to preen their owner's hair. (Molly used to lovingly do this to me.)\n\nFeeding:\nThey use their hookbills, which is an identifying parrot trait, to pry open local nuts and berries. Yes, people have and do feed them store bought seeds, but their diet is not supported by this. Remember: These birds are wild. They can and will bite if provoked. (Trust me, parrot bites can HURT A LOT and I have the scars to prove it!)\n\nNesting and Babies:\nThe Flock nests in the neighboring Presidio Eucalyptus trees during the spring. Their young remain nestled in the trees for about 3-4 months before they fledge from the nest. You can spot a baby by its predominately green color. The Cherry Head feathers, that they are known for, don't fully develop for several years.\n\nOrigin: \nCherry Heads are native to Southwestern Ecuador and Northwestern Peru. The Flock's origin in San Francisco and the many stories of how they came about have never been confirmed: a broken crate of parrots shipped in from South America, escaped pets, etc.\n____________________________\n\nWhen I first moved to Telegraph Hill, my boyfriend and I happened to run into our new neighbor Mark Bittner, the author of The Parrots of Telegraph Hill. I have to admit, I was tongue tied and could barely say a thing! I wanted to tell him how much I enjoyed the book and felt that I really got to know The Flock through his writing. I now feel a special connection to them, knowing about his experiences with them and their history. If you love these birds, you will love the book as well!\n\n*Note: The facts I shared are both from Mark's book and from my own knowledge having been a bird owner.", "author": "Kira R."}

(Check weather report for Sunset time).   You can just watch, but if you want to feed them, bring either soft fruit (apples, grapes, etc) or nuts.  Sunflower seeds in the shell are best.  If you are bringing an apple, also bring some disposable chop sticks.  Put a slice of the apple on one end of the stick.  If you are bringing nuts, also bring an open container, like a pie plate or paper plate, to hold the nuts (seeds) available to the birds.  \n\nAfter a few minutes, the parrots will notice what you have to offer, fly down and land on your arm or head.  You will be better prepared if you are wearing long sleeves and a hat.  Their feet are little sharp, but not painful.  They bite your ear if they feel that they aren't getting the food fast enough.  Again, it hurts a little, but not painful.

In my opinion it doesnt get any better than this.", "author": "nicole s."}

Before I saw this film the other night I never thought I could get so emotional about parrots named Connor, Sophie and other characters including a paraplegic parrot who is loved by the subject of the movie/aka bird caretaker. What a sweet film, if you live in SF (and even if you don't), see it!!", "author": "Nicole S."}

But here, where the fog rolls to thick that we don't see the blue sky for more than 1/2 the year I think its really amazing that we are home to these fluttering, squealing delights. \nThen again, I love when the Blue Angels practice before the big Fleet Week show too. For me, ain't nothin wrong with unforeseen flight patterns that are loud as hell. What I love about both the parrots and the F-16s is hearing them first and then trying to catch glimpses of them before they disappear. With that said I can see how, if the Blue Angels were around all the time I might not think it so special and I'd probably resent the constant noise, so I can see how some reviewers that live near the birds poo-poo them for the same reasons. However, I can't say that I could be upset if the parrots favored me with sightings everyday. They truly tickle me.", "author": "J C."}

The views are incredible, the gardens so lush it feels like you are literally taking a stairway to heaven. Although really you are climbing stairs to Coit Tower which is a huge fire hose shaped edifice. Wait, maybe it is the stairway to heaven. I digress. So about a third of the way up there is a cacophony of screeches as a flock of green parrots soar by and land in a large palm tree. We walk by and off they go. Ah, the parrots of Telegraph Hill. My spin...I guess there were a bunch of creepy needy people feeding the birds instead of the homeless at Glide. Soooo the city had to outlaw feeding the parrots. I guess mommy never bought them a dog. Just keep climbing toward the fire hose.", "author": "Theresa H."}

The views are fantastic both of the Bay, the multi-milion dollar homes and most of all, the gardens. \n\nYou can go with the SF city guides on a free guided tour or go on your own.

They wake me up when the sun rises, which right now is about 6am.  If I hadn't seen the movie I might get annoyed, but I love them.  Sometimes when they get real loud, I talk to them and say, \"What are you guys yellin' about?!\".  They don't hear me, but I really do wonder what is the big deal up in those trees so early in the morning.  Glad the parrots have found a safe haven here in SF.", "author": "e w."}

They lost a star for all of the bird groupies who serve them buckets of seeds and apples every day.  They're fun to appreciate but trust me, they have plenty of available \"wild\" food.  Aside from that they're beautiful birds with fiery personalities, just watch your ears if they jump on your shoulders.", "author": "Michael P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-10", "description": "These birds are so great and one of the things that makes the city of San Francisco unique.  They can be found in various places around the city and at specific times.  It is always a joy for me to find them, I stop in my tracks and just watch.  The history of the parrots is also so unique and I think everyone that is interested in the birds should watch the documentary, \"The Parrots of Telegraph Hill.\"  It's a bit boring, but full of information.  Very cool, definitely take time to watch them if you get a chance.", "author": "Meghana A."}
