However, the food was excellent at Myriad (it is on the Michelin Recommended list).\n\nWe had booked a reservation for a Friday night date night and arrived by BART.  They seated us immediately and we took a look at the menu. The menu was quite diverse: \"globally inspired.\" \n\nThe first glance took me by surprise because there was a tomato soup (I love tomato soups) that I hadn't noticed on the online menu. We ordered this immediately and it came out promptly and perfectly. It was so good. It was probably one of the best tomato soups I've every had and it was a little unique because it had a salsa drizzle on it. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the farm toast. As a big fan of burrata, I was extremely please with this option as well. The only problem was that the toast was so thick that I had trouble fitting it in my mouth without pouring all the tomatoes on the table. My friend ordered the hanger steak, which came with some roasted potatoes with cotija cheese which was delicious as well. We also tried the steak fries (I usually love fat fries), and they were good but not great. I think I tend to like them a little less crispy and more soft. \n\nService was great, except for that we waited for the check for a long time. It was a little pricey, but our meal was great. We will definitely be back.", "author": "Kristin A."}

The restaurant is fun to look at and hang out in, there's a bar/restaurant set up in one room and a restaurant-only space in the next room. You'll be most comfortable here in groups of 2-6, preferably 4 max. \n\nFood is not especially memorable aside from the fact that it's done reasonably well with good service. Expect the usual bar fare with a bit more fancy ingredients. Beer, wine list are extensive and the cocktails seem interesting. \n\nThe biggest downside frankly is the price of entry here. Cocktails are at a minimum $12 and the cheapest beer is a Modelo for $6. My hamburger was $17 and well, it tasted like a hamburger. My eyebrows definitely went up when I saw that a salad was almost $20. I think to command such prices you either have to have a knockout atmosphere or food and I don't really think this place has either... instead it seems to be trying to cater to a crowd who after overpaying to rent an apartment in the area, are now looking for a cleaner place to eat than what this part of the Mission can usually offer. Not sure if that's a sustainable formula for success.", "author": "Andrew C."}

We made reservations through Yelp about an hour beforehand and it worked out perfectly. Service was friendly and prompt, and food was delicious. I highly recommend the steak fries and pasta with pork cheeks! They don't have a liquor license though, so don't expect liquor cocktails. They have drinks made with soju though.\n\nSteak fries: steaming hot thick, long potato wedges! Soooo good. (5/5)\n\nPasta with pork cheeks: get this!! This was my favorite of the night. I usually don't eat pasta either, but this really blew my mind. Great flavor and the pork was so tender. (5/5)\n\nSpicy shrimp: shrimp were plump and bursted with flavor. I wasn't a big fan of the grits though-- it had too much of a buttermilk taste to it, but my bf liked it. He polished off this dish. He would rate it a (4/5), and I'd say (3.5/5).\n\nDeviled eggs: good, and worth trying. I like the onions on top! (4/5) With the Yelp check-in, we get free deviled eggs-- they usually give out just one per person (4 max for a table), but the waitress kindly gave us 4 for the 2 of us. Props on that!\n\nPickles: good assortment of veggies. Nice and sour (4/5)\n\nOverall we had a great experience and would be willing to come back.", "author": "Christina W."}

Me and a crew of fashionable Asians made our way to Myriad Gastropub, feeling it would be appropriate as I've already had myriad experiences that day. \n\nWe sat down pretty much immediately, and my eye went to the flank parpardelle pasta. I ordered that ish because my stomach was practically eating itself. Everybody else ordered a burger, but I was feeling noncomformity that day. \n\nThe pasta was 7/10 solid, and I scarfed this down in approximately five minutes. Level of hunger at that moment: Pitchfork writer as they're about to tear down an Ed Sheeran album. \n\nVery juicy, had a slight alcoholic taste to it -- I'm sure some wine was used in the cooking. Not that I needed more wine that day but, hahahaa. My friend had ordered like $11-12 sliders and they were the size of a baby's foot.

The menu was thoughtful and full of options for our group who had quite a few dietary restrictions. And the cocktail menu, while not having my favourite drink (old fashioned) had many specialty options I'd certainly go back to try. \n\nFor appetizers I got to try the thai chicken wings, and the fried chicken Sammie's (sliders). Both of these were excellent and I could have been satisfied eating these all night. Highly recommended both. \n\nFor my main I split the hanger steak and the pork cheek parpadelle. The parpadelle was outstanding, and I'm super picky about my pasta choices. The beef and mushrooms were so tender and the pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. \n\nThe hanger steak on the other hand was disappointing. A tiny portion that although requested medium rare was medium or more. It came pre slices which likely added to the dryness of the dish. The patatas bravas were good but dominated the plate. Even my coworkers who ordered the same dish had the same feedback on the dish overall. \n\nFor dessert I had the zeppole. Which were tiny deep fried balls with two dipping options. These were OK but not how my italian family traditionally would eat them. \n\nWe were a large group and overall we felt the service was a little lacking and eventually were made to feel like we might have been a burden.

Nice eclectic menu. We ordered (ordered in my preference in the realm of deliciousness), the below. All these dishes were easily shareable !\n\nPappardelle pasta with pork Cheeks (large plate): my favorite. Order if your absolutely love mushrooms. The brown beech mushrooms and kale combine for the most earthy fresh flavor. Mixed with fresh wide noodles and cheese...... amazing! they can make this with or without the pork cheeks if you prefer vegetarian!\n\nCrispy Fried chicken sammies (small plate): SO good. The perfect slider type bite. Chicken was crunchy, non greasy, tender. Good ratio of bun/chicken/slaw. Ate two myself and wanted more.\n\nThai wings: whatever these are marinated in, I wish they came in an entire basket. Reminded me a bit of some awesome wings I had in Portland (pok pok)! But I liked these more, less salty, more sweet. And can't beat the fact that these are free range wings! Let's those wings flyyyyy... over here.\n\nTres Leches butter almond cake (dessert) almonds + tres Leches..... nutty milky buttery goodness. I still dream of it.\n\nSalmon with Manila clams and chorizo (large plate): dish of scrumptious seafood. Chorizo added a nice \"pop\" against the seafood flavors. Fresh flavors, everything on the plate was well paired.\n\nVeggie skillet (large plate): curried veggies, the curry adds a lot of flavor to this and this was a hit for both vegetarians and non vegetarians at the table- hearty veggie dish that was not spicy.\n\nMpg spiced potato chips (snacks): good munchie while waiting for the friends. Spicy kettle style chips. Small portion for the price.\n\nSorbet (dessert): chocolate and mango? Sorbet scoops with two cookies on top. Both were spiced- I didn't enjoy the spice in my dessert but others did.\n\nMarket salad: eh pretty bland. See pictures :)\n\nDrinks - delicious! Looks like they lack a full alcohol license but great beer selection and the mixed drinks were tasty (I had the Freshie)!\n\nService- great! Our server was attentive - almost overly attentive and a little pushy but I'll take that over neglectful service.\n\nPricey place, but has good atmosphere, noms (food), and great place for groups big and small\n\nParking is difficult.\n\nNote that if the sun is out and you're here during sunset - it can get extremely WARM by the windows... aka sweaty... so plan accordingly :)", "author": "Karen H."}

Myriad came to us highly recommended from a trusted, super awesome colleague in the area who knows great food. I had high hopes, but unfortunately Myriad somehow just missed the mark in a major way. \nFor starters, the hospitality was lacking. Our waitress was cold and it felt like we were troubling her to ask questions or place our order. Our group of 10 enjoyed plenty of bottles of malbec in their cozy, intimate ambiance which was easily the highlight of the night. \n\nThe food itself, not so much. It was bland and missed the mark. I got the popped elote: buttered popcorn with chili, lime, cotija cheese. Although it sounded mouthwatering and delicious, it was essentially unseasoned, unfilling popcorn. Not a true Mexican-style elote flavor in sight. The veggie skillet I got as an entree was even more off the mark. Thai curry vegetable stew, bulgar pilaf, cilantro, lime, basil... With all those ingredients, you'd expect salt at a minimum and a little heat flavor from the curry. I don't know what I ate, but it wasn't any curry flavor that I regularly know and thoroughly appreciate. Maybe it was an off day, but I left hungry and disappointed with the entire experience.", "author": "Helina G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-02", "description": "I'm surprised this is a '3' for me. I came here expecting a transcendent experience. It was recommended by someone who has wonderful taste and many friends/colleagues had told me that they'd enjoyed their time here as well. I suppose it just wasn't meant to be.\n\nFrom the time my group arrived until the time we left, things just felt... askew. I have been in restaurants (and part of groups) that were rowdy, boisterous and embarrassing. This wasn't such a time. Truth be told, I wondered why we (the group) were so subdued and thought, 'everyone must be really tired.' So, bad behavior can't have been the reason that our server could - and would - not with us. It's awkward to dine in a place where you're not wanted. This wasn't a hateful situation (I would have left; no one's got time for that) but body language cues and the like let us know that she was not the one and we were not the customers.\n\nUnfortunately, the menu was not the isht. Everything sounded wonderful but the execution - to my tastes - didn't match the expectation. There was, however, one exception. I checked in at the beginning of the meal for the complimentary deviled egg. I need to eat gluten-free so mine was a bit doctored from the usual variety but it was a fine deviled egg. It was a nice amuse bouche to begin the evening. As I am wont to do, I also started with a cocktail. Because I'm fancy (and Brasilian), I ordered the Obrigado. I was happy to see that it was a cocktail of substance. This was no 'two sips and you're done' drink. The bright citrus profile was a bit blunted by the overall sweetness (and I don't shy from sweet) but I appreciated the value. To accompany my beverage, I decided on the shrimp & grits. I'm a Southerner. I knew better. I'll leave it at that. Changing up for dinner, I went red wine and big plate. Both were misses. My tempranillo was bitter and acidic. I don't know whether it was the particular wine or whether the bottle was compromised in some sort of way. The rest of the table was going to town on another red so I think it was just my bad luck.* The cochinita, too, was a let down. First, there was a mini issue with me requesting gluten-free tortillas. The response was, 'I'll have to check.' Aren't we in SF? Aren't corn tortillas more plentiful than rain water? What is the issue? The dish itself was rather basic. It presented as stewed pork in a semi-spicy sauce with sparsely-apportioned onions and jalapenos. I needed to shred the pork with a fork to make it suitable for the tortillas. It was fine. For $24 I felt I had to work for it, but it was fine.\n\nBecause I am a fat man, I wanted dessert. Suspicious that my problematic belly would keep me away from the sweet stuff, I resigned myself to a dessert of wine. Ahh, what's this? Mexican chocolate sorbet? Done. I ordered it and it came complete with flour-based cookies (not part of the description). I asked if I could get the sorbet sans cookies. One sigh later and it was done. Sorry.\n\n*I joined in on that party.", "author": "Johnny T."}

We sat at the bar and made chitchat with the nice bartender Paige, she was a hoot. \n\nAnyway, we decided to order a few small plates and then just share everything since we weren't starving just hungry. We ordered the wedge salad, crispy fried chicken sammies, spiced shrimp, and farm toast. Also, if you check-in you will get a free deviled egg and it is pretty tasty. I really really enjoyed everything we ordered but definitely my favorite had to be the spiced shrimp, the shrimps were perfectly cooked and they come served over delicious grits, definitely took me back to my Texas days. The farm toast was a close second, it was the perfect combination of sweet and salty with the goat cheese and the compote they put on top of the cheese. Everything was really good, I would actually go back and order the same things minus maybe the wedge salad just because I'd rather get something less healthy, ha.

This modern restaurant serves dishes with inspired flavors from all around the world, and the service is so friendly to boot! Coming in for dinner, we started with the popped elote, the deviled eggs, and a seasonal market salad, but the real standout to me were the main dishes.\n\nFirst, the spiced shrimp over grits were plump and juicy, and they contrasted so nicely with the grainy yet thick and creamy grits--eating the corn mixture was like eating a savory, delicious pudding! The salmon was grilled perfectly and was served with manila clams, cubes of chorizo, and corn, over a puree of parsnip and celery root. The textural contrast of the puree, the sweetness of the corn, and the smokiness of the chorizo collided perfectly. I was also a huge fan of the pappardelle pasta, which had an amazing texture and was served with tender pork cheeks and mushrooms. The crispy Brussels sprouts with hazelnuts made for a fantastic side, but my favorite dish of all was the lamb sandwich, which consisted of thin slices of lamb roast served in a crispy round bun with Moroccan tomato jam, feta, cilantro aioli, and a delicious arugula salad on the side.

Miles later I found myself craving a pulled pork burger. Finding myself in the mission I felt like my chances were low to find what I was looking for, I stopped for a moment, looked up and there it was.. Myriad Gastropub.. I looked at the menu and it had just what I was looking for.. The pulled pork sandwich.. \n\nNow lemme tell you.. I'm from Texas and have worked for some of the best bbq spots in the world.

We walked in dressed for the playa and were greeted warmly by the staff despite being way over (crazy) dressed... Once we started looking over the menu we realized this was going to be a treat!\n\n   First I noticed the great local draft beer selection so I ordered up a pint of the Oktoberfest from Triple Voodoo brewing, it hit the spot! My wife opted for some bubbles. They also have a full bar offering craft cocktails.\n\n   It was late (almost 11pm) and we were in the mood for munchies so we attacked the snacks and small plates sections of the menu. A check in from Yelp got me a deviled egg to start off, it was ready in what seemed like seconds. It was my first bite and I knew I was going to be stoked with the rest of the meal. Instead of the standard mustard variant they served it up with salsa verde and crispy shallots, yum!\n\n   Next we killed a plate of the chicken sammies. Although I really hate the name \"sammies\" (probably because of a coworker with the same name), these were AWESOME! Perfectly fried little chicken bites were crispy but juicy, served on soft rolls with sweet chipotle mayo, slaw, and pickled veggies for extra crunch. So good!\n\n   The Thai wings were next, again perfectly fried crisp and juicy in the middle. There were some jalapenos for heat, cilantro and mint for fresh, and fish sauce to take it to the next level. Hard to describe how good these were, you've just got to try them for yourself.\n\n   After all that we asked for a recommendation and they brought us the shrimp and grits. I personally love shrimp and grits and these knocked it out of the park! The shrimp was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The grits were super creamy with just the right amount of corn texture and drowning in a buttery alborino sauce. A great end to a perfect snack stop.\n\n   I'm not in the city often but this place is worth visiting again next time I'm in town. You should definitely give them a try!", "author": "Mark F."}

OMG to die! The french beans with chili which tasted like butter and spice. Amazing! The toast with buratta - it was cold, didnt expect that, but still delicious! The edimame with black soy sauce and sesame, which I quite literally could have gotten drunk on. We then ordered shrimp and grits - husband devoured the whole thing. Friend got the pork which she couldn't finish. I had the tomato soup, which was delicious and I had a salad, which I couldn't finish. Don't forget to try to housemade ginger beer.

But after a very long Saturday and sleeping in a little bit, we didn't have all the time in the world. Not to mention, so many brunch spots started a little later than we needed to. Out comes the Yelp app. For the most part, I relied on recommendations from co-workers on the this work trip turned personal for the latter half of the week. But this time, it was up to the app that we all know and love. So I wanted a highly rated brunch, that wasn't light years away, and also took Yelp Reservations. Tap, swipe, tap... BOOM - Myriad Gastropub was our spot.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place was a Ghost-town. Never a good sign. So the reservation part wasn't really necessary. But as I figured and later found out, we were definitely on the early side for brunch. So the lack of wait really helped us out. We started with coffee and mimosas. Not the best coffee ever and not the best mimosa ever... but they both served their purpose. We opted to start with the goat cheese and chive biscuits with house made preserves. They were absolutely outstanding. I don't usually like jelly/preserves on my biscuit... but these HAD to have this on there. The preserves were definitely big fruit chunks and went so well with these savory biscuits. I am SO glad there weren't more or they weren't bigger, because I would have ruined the rest of my meal.\n\nBy the time we were finishing, people were definitely starting to crowd in. The one downfall I have of this place is the quintessential booth wall with tables right next to one another. I know it is a great way to get some tables in. But I'm just personally not a fan to be in arm's length of someone else order of goat cheese and chive biscuits. But I digress.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the pork hash with a nice, runny fried egg on top. Now it is not difficult to make a pretty good hash. I mean you are taking mean and potatoes and letting yolky goodness run through it. But this one was particularly spectacular. And there was a ton of it. And for those that know me, I'm not one to leave something this tasty behind. But this was not a dish to be conquered on this day.

We researched a few places in SF that allowed dogs since she gets lonely and sad when we ditch her so I found this place in the Mission district.\n\nWe got there a little earlier than planned last night because we took the bus (let's just say the 49 bus was a wild ride) but they were able to seat us right away since they weren't too busy. It was quite chilly so we were nervous that we had sit outside (no heat lamps!) but Mark who greeted us and was our server said we could sit indoors as long as Sheba sat under our table and not out in the aisles. \n\nMark was great, he petted Sheba and even brought her a water bowl- he was great with her.  \n\nMy sister and I started out with a cocktail- we got the Forbidden Lowball because it had ginger beer (our tummy was feeling a little out of sorts the wild bus ride) and the Cardamaro is apparently a digestif and it was helpful as well. The drink was pretty tasty and not too sweet, a nice balanced flavor.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\ndeviled egg- a great starter, loved the shallots, it added texture to the already tasty egg!\n\npotted chicken liver mousse- delish, it wasn't gamey and in the beginning I didn't like the port onion jam but as I kept eating it, I really enjoyed it with the mousse. We also at one point ran out of crostini but Mark got us more so we could finish the mousse (well we almost finished).\n\nPappardelle pasta with pork cheeks- We love this kind of pasta, we don't usually make this at home so it's always nice to order it when we're out. Plus I love pork cheeks, they are usually tender and delicious and this one was exactly that. I also loved the mushrooms and the light sauce on this pasta.\n\nGrilled Hanger Steak with Patatas Bravas- probably my favorite dish of the night- the steak was cooked medium rare and was nice and juicy. The flavors were quite nice and I really liked the salsa verde. The best part in my book though was the patatas bravas- (I love papas bravas in general which is why I ordered this dish), the potatoes were nice and crispy and I loved the romesco sauce with the crunchy cotija cheese-it gave it a light salty flavor and a Mexican touch.\n\nWe skipped dessert because we were stuffed to the brim- otherwise I would have ordered the Zeppole. All in all, we had a great dinner there with equally great service.

The dish came with a side of potatoes (patas bravas), also delicious. I'm not much of a potato fan at restaurants because I find them to be over or under seasoned and/or under or over cooked. But these potatoes were perfect! I loved them! The cojita cheese was an interesting touch that gave a Hispanic vibe, paired with the salsa verde. Also, cooked to just enough crisp on the outside and extremely soft on the inside. My friends kept stealing them off my plate! Very good! This dish was the more pricer of the menu-$26, not bad for quality food and enough quantity!  \n\nWe got a complementary dessert since they ran out of the dessert we ordered!

For the $25 pre-fix lunch menu, you get to choose a snack (deviled egg / pickled vegetables), a small plate (popped elote/ chicken-liver mousse), and lunch plate (roasted chicken salad / bbq pulled pork sandwich / oxtail pozole). The price came out to be same or even more than just ordering from their regular menu. The portion size were also MUCH MUCH smaller, which doesn't make any sense. \n \nEverything we ordered were extremely salty. Deviled egg was just 1 half of the egg, and had way too much olive oil on it. Pickled vegetables was just salty. Popped elote was pretty good, I liked the cheese on top - but the restaurant week deal was literally 1/3 of the regular size. Chicken-liver mousse on crostini was delicious - but instead of getting a pot with 6 crostini like the regular menu, you get 2 small pieces. On to the entree... Bbq pulled pork sandwich was pretty good, I liked the saucy and flavorful pulled pork. The house spiced potato chips served on the side was again very very salty. Roasted chicken salad was probably the highlight of the meal - I loved the candied walnuts, apples, and blue cheese combination. \n\nOverall, Myriad is definitely a great restaurant. The ambience is beautiful and some of the food was surely delicious. I would really want to give them another change. However, I have to say I was pretty dissapointed with my experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-22", "description": "This place is great!\n\nI was looking for a pretty nice little place [not too expensive but also really good quality food] to take my boyfriend for his birthday and a lot of the other top rated stuff in the neighborhood we've already been to. After tons of contemplating between a bunch of options, I settled for Myriad after checking out their menu online. They had some really solid choices that I knew he'd like, such as the marrow, liver mousse, and hangar steak #meat.\n\nI made a reservation for the occasion and we came over that night. It was Monday night and I think we happened on a night that wasn't so busy so it was pretty empty which is perfect because I think I personally prefer a quieter more intimate dinner than one overcrowded with loud music and people.\n\nOne thing to note is that the cocktails are all made with beer/wine/soju etc. None of the really hard stuff in a typical cocktail. I think we went with the Obrigado and the Mission Statement, and from what I remember, both were pretty good :) \n\nFor food we took:\n- potted chicken-liver mousse, port-wine onion jam, crostini \nThis was great, served in a fun little glass jam jar with some really nicely toasted and seasoned crostini. Wine onion jam is so good, you can pretty much put that on anything or mix it with everything and I'm down. The mousse was a great balance of the nice liver-y flavor and was so smooth and buttery. We both have kind of an obsession with all things liver mousse/pate/foie gras related (which yes, I know they're all different but hello #meatbutter) so this was great and a good portion too!\n\n- bone marrow with sherry demi-glace, tarragon-horseradish gremolata, toasted sourdough\nBone marrow is a buttery blob of fatty goodness. You either love it or hate it and we're big fans (note the comment in the last item). They give you two solidly sized halves of bone marrow seasoned and cooked to perfection, with more lovely bread to dip and douse it with. Neither of us had no shame in taking the whole thing and basically licking it clean, that stuff is just so good. It's rich so you feel pretty satisfied but I always find that I could use a little more marrow since it does go down quick. \n**FYI I just checked and this is no longer on the menu! Boooo :(\n\n- grilled hanger steak with patatas bravas, cotija, romesco, salsa verde, grilled spring onions \nWe had this cooked medium rare and it was really good--solid pieces of steak and the patatas bravas were great (also a favorite). It ended up being a bit too much potato but we cleared off the meat like the carnivorous people we are.\n\n- pappardelle pasta with pork cheeks, peas, kale, brown beech mushrooms, tarragon, pecorino \nThis was an unexpected favorite. I am personally a huge fan of pork and especially pork cheek is such a delicately rich cut of meat. This was cooked SO perfectly and pappardelle is my absolute favorite type of pasta. This was like doused in a gravy mushroom sauce and we had it perfectly seasoned. My bf said it was reminiscent of a really good french dish he liked so we cleaned this up easily. 10/10 would recommend\n\n- sorbets: pomegranate prosecco spiced pumpkin \nOf course, despite both of us not being much of dessert people, I decided to at least order a sorbet for the occasion (yes, the restaurant knew we were celebrating his birthday via the reso) and they put a cute little candle in the ice cream. Our server was so nice the whole night really making this birthday pretty special with a cocktail to go with our dinners and a dessert cocktail to go with dessert, complimentary. Plus, we only ordered the sorbet but he added a scoop of the spiced pumpkin ice cream for us to try as well. Both were great and really refreshing, plus the ending cocktail was perfect to top off the meal and help digest it all.\n\nLet me just say service here is phenomenal. Maybe it was the time/day/occasion but regardless, I was really super impressed and pleased with everything and we really enjoyed the experience, which was a special one. Just for that, I will be back time again!\n\nP.S. I've also ordered food delivery from here and when I did, I will say the pasta wasn't as well seasoned as it was in the restaurant--regardless, it was still very good. I was also able to try the deviled eggs and the mgp steak fries which are hefty steak fries with bacon, chive, & sour cream, all pretty yummy.", "author": "Nerissa C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-13", "description": "I *really* want to be a big fan of Myriad but after trying it twice and being underwhelmed, I see no reason to go back. The first time I stopped in was about a year ago for cocktails and while I don't remember what anyone ordered, I *do* remember how everyone disliked their drinks. Maybe a fluke due to a bad bartender but for somewhere advertising as a \"gastropub\" with a cocktail menu, it is puzzling.\n\nOn our most recent visit, we stopped in for an early dinner. We arrived around 4:30pm before the dinner menu was being served but we were able to order a pitcher of Modelo ($12 on HH) and an order of deviled eggs ($5 or $6 on HH) before putting in an order on dinner. I will say that the beer was extremely reasonably priced and served in a large pitcher. The bartender was extremely friendly and even kept our pitcher in the refrigerator for us behind the bar to keep it from getting warm. The deviled eggs arrived, however, and were greasy and salty. This was my first time having deviled eggs (embarrassing, I know) but A thought they were prepared really poorly.\n\nBy the time we finished our snack, the kitchen was open for dinner. I opted for the Veggie Skillet ($19) and A was feeling the Grass-Fed Burger ($16). Our food arrived quickly and we dug in. My Veggie Skillet was HUGE. I only finished about a quarter of it. The creme fraiche on top I think ruined the dish and I scraped it off. The flavor was fine and it tasted healthy but I was not impressed at all since I KNOW I have made similar dinners myself. Plus, even if the portion was big, I think $19 for chickpeas is a bit steep. I did have it for breakfast the next day with an egg, at the suggestion of the bartender, and I enjoyed it more. A didn't love his burger and found the \"fries\" especially disappointing since they were more like potato wedges. \n\nOverall, I don't think either of us are willing to give Myriad a 3rd try. I give them an extra star than I think they deserve because both times we were there, the staff was really friendly and were trying. I just think they are so expensive for a sub-par experience and no matter how many fancy ingredients you use, the food is neither upscale nor comforting.", "author": "Carrie W."}

This will sound pretentious, but my fiance was wearing a fur scarf and I had a collared shirt, so we were hoping to stumble into a fancy, upscale restaurant to celebrate our last evening in San Francisco on our engagement \"honeymoon.\" I didn't realize that Mission would be all dingy taquerias (don't get me wrong, those are amazing, but have their time and place). Anyway, we walked past El Farolito and across from Foreign Cinema (where we had eaten the night before) and found MGP. The Yelp reviews seemed fantastic, so we strolled in.\n\nOur server Ross was excellent. He was friendly, patient, and lively throughout the evening. He brought us tasters for the two beers that we were deliberating over, took good care of us over the course of the meal, and made us laugh several times.\n\nAs for food, we ordered the deviled eggs, the pickled vegetables, brussel sprouts, and MGP fries as appetizers/my fiance's meal. I enjoyed the deviled eggs - the mellow, rich flavors of the mashed egg yolk was balanced by the acidic pickled onions. I only wish I had ordered more than 1 for myself. I hate pickles as a personal taste, so no comments on the pickled veggies, although I will note that my fiance did not eat any of the cucumber pickles (but did finish all the carrots and cauliflower). The brussel sprouts were fried (I think?) and deflowered/de-leafed, as opposed to oven-baked in the round shape. Peppered with bacon bits and an acidic vinigerette, the brussel sprout was the strongest dish of the evening and I would order it again. The MGP fries, which I had imagined to be like a nacho dish with potatoes, was more like a loaded-potato-skins appetizer. Not amazing, but not terrible either. \n\nWe split the hangar steak - the meat portions were on the smaller side. It came pre-sliced, as most hangar steaks do, and totalled to only three medium-sized pieces. The meat was well cooked, tender, and juicy, but I'm not sure it was worth the price tag. The potatoes were plentiful (maybe double the meat portion) and delicious, but there should have been a better balance.\n\nOverally, was debating whether to rate a 4 or 5 star, but we thought that the service was so amazing that it would be a disservice to dock a star. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area!\n\n(Thanks for the lovely evening, Ross!)", "author": "Justin Y."}

There were four of us eating, two of us shared an entree, we only ordered sodas to drink, and our total was $110.

All were creatively crafted, beautifully plated, and impressively delicious. The highlights were:\n-- Popped elote. Aka popped corn...popcorn. haha. A great dish to order and munch on during appetizers! \n-- Farm toast with goat cheese mousse, pine nuts, balsalmic, and basil. It comes with 2 pieces of toast. They could easily be split into in half so four people each get a half..or you may not want to share :-D \n-- Roasted lamb sandwich: I love lamb. The lamb in this sandwich was super tender and complimented beautifully by tomato jam and creamy cilanto aioli. The bread was flavorful, though adittantly got rid of the top half and ate it open-faced...more lamb in each bite that way.\n-- Salmon with pork guanciale, lentil ragout, sherry, whole grain mustard aioli, and herb salad. The salmon was perfectly cooked and the pork in the lentil raguat was a wonderful meaty compliment to it all. \n-- Cochinita pibil, aka braised mayan pork tacos served with sour orange red onions, pickled jalape\u00f1os, green chile, and corn tortillas. The pork melts in your mouth. \n-- Grilled hanger steak with patatas bravas (aka fried potatoes) and romesco. A generous portion of steak. Perfectly medium rare. Crispy flavorful potatoes. \n\nDrinks:\nWe ordered bottles of wine and pitchers of beer. The wine was a lovely $36 bottle of Navarrsotillo tempranillo. For beer, they guys got a few different kinds. Love that you can get pitchers of the beer! They got and enjoyed the Hawk Hill Hefeweissen and a saison. The cocktail list was also impressive, and though we didnt try them, I would feel safe saying I'm sure they're wonderful.\n\nAtmosphere:\nWarm, inviting, and lively. The restaurant is quaint. Dim lighting gives a cozy feeling. We had a bar-level table for our group of 8 in a nook at the front of the restaurant. The one thing I'll say is that there is only 1 one-person bathroom for the place, so there's usually a line. \n\nService:\nOur server was fantastic. Great at giving recommendations and coursing out our food. It was my friend's birthday so I asked the waitress if they did anything for birthdays.

I really wanted to get a side of the mgp potato wedges with all the fixings they offer so I decided to just get the chicken sliders and those for my meal. The sliders are really good too. Comes with a Mexican slaw in the sammie and picked veggies on the side. Would like to try this place for brunch some time", "author": "Katlyn H."}

So glad they told us about it - because we may have never enjoyed this terrific dinner! \n\n9 people for reservation on a Saturday night. I noticed how small the place was and wondered how they would seat all of us... and they did just fine! Comfortable seating, and not pushy at all about turning over our table. Thanks for letting us linger! \n\nWe had a bunch of starters and a few entrees we shared and several drinks and a few bottles of wine.. Super happy with everything. \n\nWe loved the chicken livers, Thai wings, chicken sammies, shrimp and grits, deviled eggs and burgers. And desserts -- butter-scotch and fruit crisp. \n\nEverything was great - the service was spectacular! I recommend this place HIGHLY and can't wait to go back.

Salmon skin was not crispy, which most of the time it should be when it is pan seared. \nEdamame's and Brussels sprouts was good but nothing special about it. \nChicken sammis was bit under seasoned and could of used some kick in the breading of the chicken or a sauce.\n\nI didn't even bothered to take any photos cuz I wasn't worth it.\nThe waitress gave good service and that's why I gave a 3 stars instead of 2.\nAnyhow I hope next time we will have a better meal experience if we decided to eat here again.\nCompletely disappointed after reading and hearing all the good reviews.", "author": "Bobby W."}

HUGE bones and so cheap for $11 when everyone else in this town is charging $16. It came to the table, we dug in and there was blood in it. Sent it back to the kitchen, the bones came back with an \"extra\" bone as apologies from the chef. Still undercooked. The sherry demi-glace didn't do anything to elevate a fatty delicious app to what it's supposed to be, instead,  we had to ask for salt to season it.\n\nThe farm toast is one of their popular items. Get it if you really must, but I recommend on skipping it. Again, nothing against toast, but it's just goat cheese and strawberry-rhubarb jam and some herbs/seeds. Did I miss something? for $10, I expected something more. Perhaps something like Delarosa's version. Now, THAT's a toast worth paying for!\n\nThe burger was also something I was eyeing. But thanks to Dan's recommendation, I got the salmon instead. Served with english peas, baby carrots and pea tendrils on mashed potatoes. It's clear that this should be the special dish that diners should be ordering. I love that perfect crispy skin. However, my friend's burger was overcooked and didn't want to send it back since they couldn't wait for another exchange. \n\nThe bf ordered a veggie skillet with chickpea stew, bulgar pilaf, fava beans with a garlic creme fraiche. No bacon or any meat listed on the menu (go ahead and check the current online menu) He finds pork belly in his dish. He ate it and was like, \"this is one delicious vegetable!\" (ugh, it's bacon!) If I was vegan, I would've flipped my lid. (thank God I'm not and no offense to vegans out there.)\n\nDue to the Myriad (ha) of problems we encountered with our dishes, sad to say, we would hesitate on coming back.

The eggs weren't anything special, and were drenched in olive oil and overly salted. The chicken sliders, while fairly tasty, were about the size of a tennis ball and the chicken felt like the rough size of a chicken nugget. Sliders aren't supposed to be large, but it would have been nice if it lasted more than two bites. The wedge salad, a nice mix of greens, blood orange, orange, nuts, and blue cheese might have been one of the best things we had. The salmon was crispy and served aboard a nice mix of lentils and vegetables.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor at Myriad are nice, and I can see how this can be a fun place to hang out or catch up over some small bites.

Now understand the first time I walked into the space was a Yelp party several years ago, and the appetizers on the decimated platters had been devoured by my fellow famished reviewers. However, Myriad tones down the rustic-retro look for monochromatic earth tones and more soothing music, and it works, at least for this non-millennial diner. The menu is now more new American with Latin touches provided in dishes like Bacalaitos (salt cod fritters) and Cochinita Pibil (braised Mayan pork).\n\nI started with an all-American picnic favorite, the $2 Deviled Egg with a slight Latin twist in the salsa verde, breakfast radish and crispy shallots. I ordered two of them thinking I'd get four halves, but no, it was just two halves (photo: http://bit.ly/1RjqWBU). I hate when that happens because then I'm too embarrassed to ask for another order. On top of that, they were a tad too pickly for my taste as I'm the type that goes for straight mayo, or should I say aioli? Any reservations I had at that point went away with my entree, the $24 Pappardelle with Pork Cheeks, Peas, Kale, Brown Beech Mushrooms, Tarragon, and Pecorino (photo: http://bit.ly/1QZAiU8).\n\nI was tempted by the Grilled Hangar Steak, and chef Tricia Tracey even came by to wax fondly about it in a very close contest with the pappardelle. I didn't regret my choice as it was delicious in an earthy Tuscan way with huge chunks of savory pork cheek to satisfy any carnivore. This one is a winner. Buoyed by my main dish, I went for the $8 Warm Caramelized Granny Smith Apple, Cranberry and Pecan Crisp with Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche Ice Cream and was downright gleeful about the combination of flavors and textures that were both familiar and refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/1RjqYdd). Yet another winner, two out of three ain't bad and I'm certainly tempted by the other menu items.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...the pappardelle is a winner, something tells me there are others lurking on that menu\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...more pleasant than it was as Nombe\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty attentive, especially when the chef comes to your table\nTOTAL - 4 stars...even though it bears a strong resemblance to others in its culinary genre, Myriad deserves its prime spot on Mission", "author": "Ed U."}

We looked over so many Yelp reviews and decided on Myriad since it seemed affordable and had a 4.5* rating. We were excited to easily make a reservation for a Friday night with only a few days notice. That doesn't happen everywhere in SF.\n\nService was pretty great, I'll say that. The girl who welcomed us was somewhat new to the restaurant but was very friendly and helpful, and our server Charlie was nice as well.\n\nThe three of us had drinks and a smattering of food, and our total after tax was $171. I don't know how we got the bill that high as none of us were stuffed and we didn't really order that much food.\n\nWe split the Hanger Steak, which was the most expensive thing at $25. It was decent, but wasn't that big. We also split the Pork Pappardelle for $24, and it wasn't that good.

My friend and I were disappointed when it was only half of a bone marrow on the plate, and we had to split that and then take turns doing the luge. Worse, our bill showed TWO sherry luge's. Maybe it was a double? I don't think so, and we surely didn't ask for one or even tell them we'd be splitting it, so I think it was just an error.\n\nNothing was standout amazing, and I don't think I'd return if I was in SF.

Door person seemed a little stress, & not especially welcoming nor attentive. Service started a bit slow although the restaurant was not full. Cocktails were ok, but not spectacular.\n\nWe started with deviled eggs & they were tasty. Next was the Jersey Wedge & that was very good. We liked that they lightly drizzled some dressing on the lettuce, but put more on the side for individual liking. Next was the potted chicken liver mousse. This was tasty, but not better than others we've tried elsewhere. Last small plate we tried was the spiced shrimp with creamy grits. This was very good with grits that actually tasted of corn. The entire dish was very flavoful.\n\nWe chose the papparadelle with pork cheeks which was very good. It  had a deep down mushroom flavor, but could have used a bit more salt. The burger on the other hand was very beefy & had a great charred flavor. We think their burger is actually slightly better than Chez Maman & Monsieur Benjamin. \n\nWhile everything was pretty good so far, the deserts didn't do as well. The pot de cr\u00e8me was nice enough, but the butter scotch flavor should have been stronger. The thyme shortbread cookie was not good. It kept reminding me my dinner fell into my desert. The tres leches-almond brown butter cake had decent flavor but was very dry. \n\nOverall, decent food & their bus persons were very attentive & hard working. Our waiter tried hard also but seemed a bit overwhelmed. We'd come back if in the neighborhood, but would not make a special trip.", "author": "Amen C."}

Everyone is very chill, laid back and relaxed...and sometimes because of that, things tend to take a bit longer.\n\nI came in for dinner with a few coworkers last week, and our dinner took over three hours. Not complaining at all. After a long day it was nice to relax and unwind over delicious food and drinks. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and took a great deal of time to walk us through each course and give us tips on what to order (which was pretty much everything on the menu).\n\nWe started with dranks, naturally. Something very unique about Myriad is that although they don't serve liquor (wine and beer only) they have various cocktail options made with different types of beer and wine. I went with the sandbar which was really fruity and had prosecco in it. Yum!\n\nWe shared a couple of small plates including farm toast, fried cod balls and grilled peach and goat cheese salad. The farm toast was definitely the highlight (as promised by the waiter) and had a delicious creamy cheese and homemade tart plum jam.\n\nOkay, so about an hour and a half later, we were on to ordering our mains. I ordered the pappardelle with beef cheeks, minus the beef cheeks. I don't care if they are a delicacy, anything with beef cheeks in it's name is not going in my stomach. The dish was great either way, and was almost reminiscent of something you'd order at a thai spot. Noodles sauteed in some kind of brown sauce with mixed veggies like straw mushrooms and kale. Soooo good that I had to finish every last bite.\n\nAnd then, on to dessert. This time we didn't order and instead the waiter told us to trust him. At this point in the meal, I definitely did. He brought out an assortment of things- ice cream sandwiches with fresh berry ice cream, butterscotch custard and fried dough balls. Obviously this guy really knew a thing or two about how to impress five ladies.\n\nThree hours later, we left full and satisfied.

So when he exclaimed, \"they have pickled veggies. We have to get that.\" I was a bit of underwhelmed. But seeing that he shared my prior enthusiasm, albeit, two years too late, I did not want to turn him down. No one dared to turn me down when I was going through that pickled phase. Myriad Gastro has a very interesting selection of pickles. They were pretty and crisp. A nice contrast to the dark interior. \n\nFried chicken sammies were very good. You know it's listed as small bite but it's not really. A perfect sharable dish.\n\nPasta was good. They were nice enough to split it down the middle. Sadly it encouraged me to eat more. I am a lot shorter and ought to eat less. But it is the right amount of pasta, eating it all by yourself would mean a lot of trail miles and it's not worth it. So absolutely do divide the dish up into two.\n\nI realized that this was the restaurant that we'd have wanted to come for brunch. \n\nI was wrong about pickles being so passe.

Fortunately my colleagues came to my rescue and bought me a pair of comfortable new flip flops at one of the surrounding stores for only $4. Score! \n\nOnce I had shoes we met our lovely waiter. His name is escaping me, but he is the proud older brother of the chef. In fact, when we asked for recommendations of what's good from the menu we discovered there isn't anything he does NOT like. And so we ordered a bunch of things to share...at least to start. All of it was good, but my favorite was what we named ourselves as fish balls. \n\nWe opted for our own entrees and I got the  pasta option. It usually comes with pork cheeks, but no thanks for me. It was still very flavorful without the pork cheeks.  \n\nNo good meal ends without dessert. Since our waiter hadn't let us wrong get we asked him to put together a few desserts for our party of 7 which included some donuts, butterscotch pudding (yum) and something else that is escaping me but didn't keep me from eating it. \n\nIt was a very leisurely meal.

It was a little pricey for only one piece...but if you love marrow this one's a winner. \n\nArugala, snap pea, and jicama salad w/ cumin-lemon vinaigrette was light and refreshing with great textural balance. Not super memorable, but then again...most salads aren't! \n\nThe grass-fed beef burger was a bit disappointing for me and I wasn't a fan of the steak fries. I know they're supposed to be thick and meaty, but I felt like I was eating a baked potato. They lacked the crisp edges I was hoping for and it was very heavy alongside the cheeseburger. The MGP sauce was tasty though (think super awesome In-N-Out spread). \n\nMyriad has a unique cocktail menu with drinks like the Eastern Orchid with soju, lemongrass, ginger, and lemon, and the Black and White Ball, which has guinness, sparkling wine, and blackberry. Need I say more? \n\nService is attentive and relatively friendly, but it felt a bit rehearsed. Prices are ~$10 for appetizers and $20-30 for entrees.

They're a new establishment which took over Nombe, a struggling Japanese restaurant on 21st and Mission.   They offer a small selection of small and large plates, but most things were on the smaller side especially given the price. They have a cool looking, but OK tasting cocktail menu, and an extensive wine list which unfortunately did not meet expectations. Also, I want to say I was NOT a fan of the service. Overall, the food and drink were above average, but way overpriced.\n\n* WHITE OAK CABERNET SAUVIGNON ($17) - 3.5 STARS:\nThe by the glass wine list is a decent length, they had two cabs and a malbec which piqued my interest. The White Oak was my favorite, compared to the Malbec, but was so expensive and not worth $17. The wine also came out very warm, and the server was unapologetic.\n\n* GAIA MALBEC ($12) - 3 STARS:\nNot a terrible Malbec, rich and a little sweet. $12 was too steep for the caliber of this Malbec.\n\n* FRIED CHICKEN SAMMIES ($11) - 4 STARS:\nTwo small fried chicken sliders, and a side of pickles for $11. Kind of steep, but a tasty way to start the meal. The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, served with a sesame bun and a flavorful chipotle mayo. \n\n* ARUGULA SALAD ($10) - 3.5 STARS:\nI thought this was a very nice, refreshing generously portioned salad. It's not unique or special, but a good filler dish. \n\n* BONE MARROW ($11) - 2 STARS:\n99% bone, 1% marrow. \n\n* DEVILED EGGS ($2) - 3.5 STARS:\nPretty good, really expensive, deviled eggs. $2 for a HALF of an egg. \n\n* PAPPARDELLE with PORK AND MUSHROOMS ($22) - 3 STARS:\nI love a good pappardelle, but this one was not al dente enough for me, and the flavor overall was too bland. \n\n* ROASTED HALIBUT ($30) - 4 STARS:\nA really nice halibut pan fried and crispy on one side, and served with a deliciously savory concoction of fresh corn and clams. I loved the sauce and the flavor of the dish, but again $30 seemed way too steep for this dish.\n\n* COCHINA PIBIL ($19) - 3.5 STARS:\nTiny. Portion. Better off going to a nearby Mexican restaurant. \n\n* HANGAR STEAK ($25) - 4 STARS:\nA decent portion of perfectly executed hangar steak.

The food was average and the dishes were pricey.\n\nOur party of four ordered 7 small plates to share.  I tried 4 of them:\n*Bone marrow ($11 for half) - The standout dish of the night for me.  It had a nice sherry demi glaze and served with toasted sourdough pieces.\n*Spiced shrimp and Anson Mills grits ($13) - I was in love with the creamy grits, but the five shrimp served on top of lacked spice.\n*Crispy fried chicken sammies ($11 for 2 sammies) - They were good and this was my friend's favorite dish of the night.  The slider size sammies had a good honey chipotle mayo and served with a side of pickled veggies. \n*Deviled eggs ($2 each half) - It had a nice creamy yolk topped with salsa verde.  The crispy shallot gave a nice taste to it.\n\nThere was a big gap in timing between our appetizers and receiving our entrees.  We were seated in the back and I had a view of the kitchen.  I saw one of the kitchen staff looking at our table noticing that we weren't receiving our entrees.  After about 20 minutes of waiting, our entrees were finally served and it was disappointing.  You could tell that the kitchen rushed through our dishes.  I ordered the pappardelle with pork cheeks, peas, mushrooms and kale ($20) and it was barely warm.  The pappardelle wasn't cooked all the way and you could tell it sat there awhile from the way the pasta in the middle was dry, sticking together, and was slightly hard as I chewed on it.  One of my friends ordered his burger medium rare and it came out well. \n\nOur server was helpful and made sure that we had enough toast points for those appetizers that required them.  It was a bit annoying that he would tell us our entrees would be a few more minutes while we waited and waited.  \n\nWHAT TO KNOW:\n*Reservations can be made on Opentable\n*Wine and beer, no hard liquor\n*Street parking which can be difficult to find", "author": "Nicole S."}

The eggs were especially crafted well and certainly had a \"zing\" factor. I like the pate and they gave us unlimited toast with it too. The rest was just ok. The farm toast was actually a bit soggy,\n\nThe thing that gets me is the prices. When I came in earlier for a drink they were charging regular prices for their \"happy hour\". I could go down the street to Rosamunde and pay a $2 less for the same beer. And then on top of the higher prices, they add a tax on the drink. I have a pet peeve about joints that add a tax to their drinks. Just add it into the price of the drink; don't add a tax after the fact, it's just a sneaky way to serve alcohol.\n\nSo the all right food and the high prices yields a 3 star review.

Fresh filet of halibut with a perfectly seared golden skin, topped over a dreamy broth of corn and dried tomatoes   \n- Shrimp & grits: you can't really go wrong with shrimp & grits but the grits here is buttery and captures the flavor of the shrimps really nicely\n- Any dessert that speaks to you. I loved the butter & scotch pot de creme & stone fruit crisp with ice cream\n\nThe cocktails were fruity, refreshing and light. Think this place only has a wine & beer license, so not a full bar here. (Side story: my friend who had a very long week was not amused.)\n\nFor our group of 5, we were recommended to order 6-7 small plates to share and individual large plates. We were hungry, but even our hungry minds thought that was a bit much. We toned it down to 3 small plates and individual large plates, and we were absolutely stuffed.  \n\nA few small service speed bumps along the way, which would normally notch the restaurant down to a 4, but given this place opened mid-June, I have high hopes things will only get better from here.\n\nRobust flavors, fresh seasonal ingredients and modern / casual atmosphere.

He loves that dog to pieces. Recently, while at Pet Food Express, I was at the freezer section getting TT's raw food. When I turned around, Mr. NSS had TT in a display stroller. He sped around the store like he was on an episode of Supermarket Sweep until they reached a burly man with a huge mastiff. He then tried to play it off as if I told him to do that. Dude, really? Nothing wrong with a straight main spinning around a girly dog in a pink polka dot dog stroller. Nope, nothing. \n\nWe were long due for a date night so after tiring out TT at the dog park, we decided to check out the new restaurant, Myriad Gastro Pub that took over Nombe (opened on Wednesday, June 17th). Personally, I thought Myriad was more of restaurant that a \"gastropub\".  The global inspired menu is divided into snacks ($2-$7), small plates ($8-$14), and large plates ($14-$28). I read that the chef is from Thirsty Bear, Ramblas (tapas), and Momo's. No hard booze so there's only beer, wine, and loophole cocktails. There were more wine varieties than beer. Expect to spend around $50-$60 pp for a full meal plus an alcoholic drink. \n\nI started with the Eastern Orchid Cocktail: soju, lemongrass, ginger beer, lemon ($9): http://bit.ly/1Je2rrw. It was really refreshing but a tad too sour for me so I got a glass of Malbec ($12) for my second round which worked out perfectly for the meatier entrees. \n\nO U R  O R D E R\n*Deviled Eggs w/ salsa verde, breakfast radish, crispy shallot ($2 ea): 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1N0NnLK\nGood amuse bouche type of starter. You can never go wrong with creamy yolks.\n\n*Spiced Shrimp w/ anson mills creamy grits, albari\u00f1o-butter sauce ($13): 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1Je21BB\nI really enjoyed the tender shrimp that waere nicely spiced but the grits were curdled and gloopy. However, it had good flavor and was buttery so I wasn't about to let it go to waste.\n\n*Bone Marrow w/ sherry demi-glace, tarragon-horseradish gremolata, crostini ($11): 4.5 STARS\n http://bit.ly/1FwyriQ\nI normally like bone marrow simply prepared with some sea salt and panko but I really enjoyed the sherry demi-glace as it added a great depth of flavor and robustness. $11 for one halved bone was pricey though. \n\n*MGP Fries w/ smoky thousand island, bacon, cheese, scallions ($7.50): 4 STARS\n http://bit.ly/1FwyvPx\nI like skinny fries so this was all Mr. NSS' dish. Think a refined version of In-N-Out animal-style fries but with potato wedges. The smoky thousand island dipping sauce was deliciously decadent. \n\n*Pappardelle w/ pork cheeks, peas, kale, brown beech mushrooms, tarragon ($20): 4 STARS \nhttp://bit.ly/1ft9M9O\nSolid entr\u00e9e but at this point, I was too stuffed and had to take most of it home. The several bites I had were delicious--al-dente pasta, flavorful, tender pork cheeks, earthy mushrooms, and some kale to cut through some of the richness. A very comforting dish.\n\n*Grilled Hanger Steak w/ patatas bravas, cotija, romesco, salsa verde, spring onions ($25): 3.5 STARS\n http://bit.ly/1CoedHW\nNicely seared and tender but needed a tad more seasoning to bring out the beefy flavor of the steak. Patatas bravas were crunchy and soft inside. The extra smoky thousand island sauce from the fries made for a great dipping sauce.\n\n*Butter-with-scotch pot de cr\u00e8me, brown butter sable cookies, cr\u00e8me chantilly ($7): 3.5 STARS \nhttp://bit.ly/1LfL9cU\nMore boozy than buttery. Nothing wrong with that, I just prefer more of a buttery, caramel flavor. \n\nService was very pleasant and attentive. Everyone from the hostess, our waiter, and to the busboy was really kind. We dine like AARP members so timing of our dishes were just fine. We were in and out in a little over 60 minutes. \n\nHaven't been to Nombe in years but the new space looks a lot brighter and warmer. They've changed the light fixtures and replaced the boring black tables with nice wooden ones. There's two separate dining rooms so it's good for date night or larger groups.\n\nParking sucks in the area but thankfully there's a parking lot up the block on 21st and Bartlett.\n\n As we were finishing up dinner, we were deciding on what to do...\n\nMe: \"Wanna go see a movie?\"\nMr. NSS: \"Hmmm, only if you do.\"\n\nMe: \"Actually, I'm kinda sleepy after that wine. Let's just go home.\"\nMr. NSS: \"YES! I was hoping you would say that--I can't wait to see TT!\"\n\nThis guy. =/", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

So I'm going to pretend this wasn't as bad a decision as it turned out to be.\n\nThe food was so underwhelming.

The deviled eggs were served in a cold, small cast iron plate with olive oil on the bottom... Not sure why but it made them slippery and frankly detracted from the balance. Egg yolks in deviled eggs are rich enough on their own. \n\nThe chicken sammies were $5/each at happy hour and I jokingly said, \"Oh we could have had an in n out burger for this price!\" and man I wish we'd done that instead. The sammies were on the smaller side of sliders and the chicken patties were too thin to retain any moisture. I could have been eating tofu and been none the wiser. \n\nThe sherry sauce in the marrow was good but the marrow itself could've done with a tad more roasting and perhaps some flakey salt on top?

Nice for big groups as the tapas style dining and diverse flavors are fun to share.\n\nFOOD: \n- French toast was the highlight--a petite cross of two flavor-packed pieces that went fast at the table. Quite sweet but not overwhelmingly so. \n- Farm toast was interesting, but more of a farm crostini given how hard the bread was. I personally would have liked the bread to be softer in the middle.\n- Popped elote was underwhelming. I thought we were buying the larger kernel corn (Inca corn when sold), but it was just popcorn, stale from being left out and barely seasoned with the promised cotija and lime. It felt like a joke to be buying a small dish of it for $6.00 when corn is one of the cheapest crops in the states. \n- Papardelle noodles came out somewhat stuck to one another and gummy where they stuck--this happens when the pasta is not properly dropped/stirred in the pot when cooking\n- Wine cocktails--as Myriad has a beer/wine license but not a liquor license, all cocktails are made with wine or beer. I found them to be too sweet and not as flavorful as they might be were they made with liquor. I think my expectations might have been tempered had they been more clearly marketed as wine cocktails. \n- Salads--I was surprised by the lack of fresh greens on the salad. Though all the menu items were thoroughly enjoyable, I might enjoy some mixed green or rocket-based salads to offset the more indulgent items (when I went, there was only an iceberg wedge salad). \n\nSERVICE: \n- Polite and friendly. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time, and we appreciated their willingness to add on items and accommodate late arrivals. \n\nAMBIANCE: \n- Myriad tries to reflect its diverse flavor influences in its decor.

It's definitely one of the nicer, more modern restaurants on Mission. We made a reservation just in case, but it was actually pretty empty when we showed up.\n\nThey have pretty good drinks. No liquor license though, so all the drinks are pretty light and made with soju, prosecco, and the like - very appropriate for brunch. I had the ruby slipper, which was prosecco with lilet blanc, grapefruit, and elderflower. Based on the name, I had expected it to be a darker color and more grapefruit-y, but it was actually heavier on the prosecco with a touch of grapefruit and elderflower. I also noticed an iced coffee cocktail with stout, cream, and chocolate bitters, which sounds amazing. Gonna have to try that one next time.\n\nWe had the deviled eggs to start - DELISH.

I bookmarked it and figured that next time I'm in the area, I'd check it out. Well, last night we had spontaneously decided to go have dinner in the city with friends and not being a fan of waiting in line, I checked out the reservable restaurant on Yelp. Top of the list: Myriad Gastro Pub! No sooner reserved than thought, we were already on our way...\n\nThe word 'Gastro Pub' evokes memories of the time I lived in London where these places are popping up like mushrooms after the rain. While this is technically speaking not a Gastro Pub, the menu and ambience certainly lived up to the name.\n \nWhat I really liked about this place was the friendly service $ the manageable menu (not too many but only not too few choices). Our waiter walked us through the menu and pointed out his favorites as well as the popular items. I went for the Moroccan lamb sandwich and the devil egg. I really liked the sandwich, especially the side salad which had a lovely spiced dressing. All four of us were, unfortunately, a bit underwhelmed by the desserts.", "author": "Uli B."}

To start off our meal, we had the Deviled Eggs, Popped Elote, Spiced Potato Chips, and Bagna Cauda, and Chicken Liver Mousse. The first four came as a set with the restaurant week prix fixe menu. The pate was added as a gluttonous a la carte addition. \n\nOur runaway favorites were the popped elote and the chicken liver mousse. The deviled egg was pretty solid too, but nothing to rave about. We both weren't a fan of the horseradish-chive crema that came with the spiced potato chips - definitely a little too strong on the palate. As for the bagna cauda, I enjoyed most of the root vegetables. They were roasted nicely and pretty delicious, but they were also served over a severely burnt crostini, completely inedible.\n\nFor our entrees, my friend had the pan roasted salmon and I went with the pappardelle.  My friend could not stop raving about the salmon. It was buttery and perfectly flaky. She wasn't a big fan of the accompanying lentils though. I thought my pappardelle was done rather well. The pork cheeks were plentiful and fall apart tender. The kale, mushrooms, and peas also provided a nice change in texture. I cleared this plate with ease....very enjoyable in my opinion!\n\nFor dessert, we tried the pot de creme and the ricotta zeppoles. The zeppoles were delicious! Fluffy and not too sweet. The two accompanying sauces were also divine! I loved the bourbon caramel sauce but the chai creme anglaise also provided a pretty refreshing twist. The pot de creme was very smooth, but pretty rich in my opinion. The scotch undertone did help to change up the flavor profile though. \n\nAll in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my eating experience at Myriad Gastropub. Service was also very friendly.

The Beef Burger was cooked perfectly, nice and thick - not some flat, pressed patty at all. I had the grits, kale, squash and poached egg dish - which I would love to eat everyday. The grits were creamy and the roasted vegetables were succulent and seasonal.  The French Toast consisted of big, thick slices of challah bread topped w/ bacon and maple syrup - what's not to like!  If I'm anywhere near the Mission - I'll be sure to find an excuse to go to this place again.", "author": "DM Z."}

My eyes got way bigger than my stomach and ended up over ordering for two people. On the bright side, it allowed me to try out Myriad's different flavors and dishes to get an overall sense of what's good and what's not. \n\nDeviled eggs- This dish is pretty good. It's definitely a must try but I wouldn't come back and order it again.\n\nChicken liver mousse- MUST GET. Their mousse is perfectly seasoned with the correct texture. The purple onion jam and super toasted crostini went extremely well with the mousse.\n\nBone Marrow- OMG, also a must get! It was so deliciously prepared with the best sauce combination ever. I literally used the bread to soak up all the sauce on the plate; it was that good!!!\n\nFarm Toast- It was delicious although after having had the previous three dishes it didn't quite compare. I think if you don't get any of the rich dishes above then the farm toast would be good, but if you did then just skip this. \n\nSpicy Shrimp- At this point my date and I knew we over ordered but we continued on because the dishes just kept coming. The shrimp wasn't spicy at all although the sauce was good. The grits were amazing! The quality of the shrimp used was okay. I would probably recommend this dish just for the grits.\n\nBavette Steak- We ordered this dish medium rare but it came out more rare. That was okay though because I would much rather have my steak more rare than medium. The chimichurri sauce it came with was delicious, the roasted potatoes were crisp on the outside and super tender on the inside, and the patatas bravas sauce was addicting. This would be a good entree to get.\n\nI think at this point in the meal I would've rated this place 5 stars. What dropped it down to 4 was when we were ready for the check. Our waitress was nowhere to be found so after 15 minutes of waiting we tried flagging down another waiter even though we knew his responsibilities was for the tables next to us. I think he saw us waving our arms and saying excuse out loud but he blatantly ignored us. It wasn't until another 5 minutes that we were finally able to flag down our waitress to finish our dinner service by retrieving the bill.\n\nEven with the service mishap, I will definitely return due to the fabulous dishes Myriad provides.", "author": "Rosanna N."}

They were delicious.  Love me some good deviled eggs.\n\nThen it was onto the fried chicken sliders with slaw and pickled veggies.  They were a'ight. Nothing spectacular but their sauce (kind of a sweet chipotle mayo) made them a bit more tasty.  The pickled veggies were a nice touch. \n\nI had their burger for my main.  Also solid, but wouldn't crack my top 10.  Just a good overall patty + cheddar + brioche bun. Again, the sauce made it shine and this time was their MGP sauce, which looked and tasted the same as their chipotle mayo sauce. \n\nService was excellent.

The reservation via Yelp was smooth and they gave us a comfortable, spacious booth right by the window where we could settle in and test out all of their delightful dishes and drinks. \n\nWe shared a bunch of small starters and mains with some of the many standouts being the divine deviled egg, the shrimp and grits, the mini chicken sandwiches and the scrumptious papardelle pasta with slow cooked pork cheek ragu. \n\nWhile the service may have been on the slow side for some Americans, us Europeans really enjoyed the relaxed pace of the meal and even closed the restaurant down! \n\nSo if you're looking for a warm, cozy and delicious restaurant with a faint air of Europe this place is for you!", "author": "Zeva B."}

The hostess was so kind and lovely, even though we ended up being a little late due to traffic!\n\nFirst off, let me say that the ambiance is so different and clean - sort of hipster yet modern with their wooden tables and different artwork/ mirrors lining their walls - such a change from mission street. We each got an order of popped elote, 2 small biscuits with butter and jam, and a main course. I got the ham and cheese sandwich with home fries (the other choices were a pork hash and shakshuka).\n\nThe appetizers were pretty delicious - not life-changing, but enough to satiate the appetite while you wait for your main meal. My sandwich looked like a gourmet version of a breakfast sandwich.... but it tasted better than one haha~ the bun was similar to a hamburger bun, but light and fluffy (and buttery?)! The home fries were just ... potatoes... I used a lot of hot sauce to bring more flavor to my dishes. The other dishes looked way better in my opinion though.\n\nFor the pre-fix course meal, it was a little pricey, yet I can't complain too much because I ate everything that was given to me.

Even though it was prime time on a Saturday night we were quickly seated and our server got to us quickly, explaining that the cocktails are made with wine instead of liquor. \n\nWhat does that mean for the cocktails taste you may wonder? I think it makes them better. They're less harsh, smoother and a bit sweeter as a result. Cocktails are easy drinking and very satisfying as a result. \n\nNext came the fabulous food. We ordered the deviled eggs and farm house toast to start. Both were superb. The eggs had onion ring on them adding a delightful crunch. The creamy texture of the goat cheese was offset perfectly by the dense bread and toppings on the toast. \n\nMains were the chicken liver pate, shrimp and grits, and pork cheek salad. I can recommend all three heartily, but if you're unsure about whether you like pate skip it, the portion is hearty for those that do enjoy it (counting myself among that group I was pleased) but isn't great to sample. The shrimp were seriously some of the best I've ever had the pleasure of eating and the grits complemented them well with buttery cheesy goodness. Why hasn't the west coast caught on to the grits thing!? Pasta was very interesting, almost reminding me of a more Asian preparation, but noodles were perfectly cooked and the pork cheeks nicely seasoned. \n\nDefinitely coming back here next time I'm in the neighborhood!", "author": "Ian G."}

He also lives, breathes, and sleeps food like I do, so I knew I had my hands full when I was tasked to pick the restaurant. Fortunately I found Myriad and reservations were surprisingly a piece of cake on Yelp! \n\nService was very attentive and the food hit the mark. We went with the following:\n\n- Fried chicken sammies - Two sliders with super crispy chicken in awesome honey chipotle mayo with creamy cole slaw. Be careful when you take a bite into this one as the flavor (and sauces) are explosive, literally. One of their specialities here. The pickled veggies were also super yummy - friend and I had to avoid our forks both going after the last piece. Great start.\n- Bone marrow with the sherry luge - Also solid. We used the toasted sourdough to clean up the gremolata and sherry sauce. Then you take the sherry and pour it down the bone marrow and into your mouth, kind of like drinking your alcohol of choice down an ice sculpture. I've never done the luge using a bone before but it was kind of fun and really helped cleanse the palate of the heaviness of the marrow.\n- Roasted lamb sandwich - Their other specialty. Hard to choose between this one and the chicken sammies. The lamb is thinly sliced with some great flavors of caramelized onions, jam, feta, and cilantro aioli. Yummmm!\n- Butterscotch pot de creme - The perfect ending. Not too sweet. Creamy and delicious spread over the brown butter cookies they came with. I could've eaten two of these by myself.", "author": "Janet Z."}

Dessert looked nice, too, but I resisted the temptation. Looks like they have brunch service forthcoming, too.", "author": "Krista L."}

We read the menu and were intrigued by the description of the snacks and small plates.  \nSome of the dishes worked and some didn't.  The deviled eggs were flavorful and accurately described.  We ordered a second one.  The farm toast was very good though not quite as described online.  The effect of the addition made the dish sweeter.  That worked better for my husband and less well for me.  The toast and goat cheese were wonderful.\nWe split a main dish of skillet vegetables.  For both of us the vegetables were well prepared, and if the dish had not been overwhelmed by smoked pimiento, we would have really liked it.  It tasted of liquid smoke because of the smoked quality.  There was for us too much bulgar wheat, dominating the chickpeas and the peas.  It was pretty oood, but the proportions were wrong, and the pimiento was overbearing.\n\nThe sorbet, especially the Mexican chocolate, was excellent.  The chocolate cake with the olive oil and chocolate sauce was a disappointing mix that tasted too much of olive oil.\n\nIt is hard to be critical of such creative efforts.  We wish the dishes had worked better for us.", "author": "Che S."}

The TONY wanted steak and was being very particular that night and I couldn't yelp anything we could both enjoy so compromise ensued. \nI walk by this place every night on my way home off the Bart and never seems too packed but not in a bad way. Always comes off as a good \"communal friends dinner\" vibe. We had a small table for us in the back but still comfortable and a very easy going atmosphere and accommodating waiter. \nOf course we ordered the deviled eggs (I may have ordered more when the BF was in the bathroom but it is what it is), chicken liver mousse, bottle of wine, and he had the Hangar steak while I jumped to the butternut squash soup at the last minute. \nAll good and reliable dishes; what stood out for us was the chicken liver mousse. HUGE portion; I could spend days eating this. I love you. Marry Me. Don't let the BF see this.\nI liked the butternut squash soup as well; simple and nice drizzle of oil on top. But again, most places can do soup just fine. \nThe reason for 3 stars; BF was like A-ok on steak and deviled eggs. Mind you, we had Marlowe the night before and that got us all twisted on great deviled eggs. \nI want to go back and will go back; heard horrible things from friends on atrocious service who go there often (which kept us from lingering in ever); so hopefully they cleared out the bad staff.", "author": "Kelly T."}

This still baffles me how the biggest tech city in US, has food places that are either too cheap or too dumb to split checks properly.\n\nA couple of small gripes, is that they only have one bathroom for both males and females, so there will frequently be a line of people waiting outside of the door.

Also the noise level at times got pretty loud for such a small place, to the point where everyone in our party had to almost shout at each other in order to talk.\n\nPROS\n- Decent food\n- Good prices\n- Great cocktails\n- Low wait times\n- Nice staff\n\nCONS\n- Only one bathroom\n- Can get loud", "author": "Steven S."}

Big kudos to the alchemist that prepared this.\n-- (~) Forbidden Lowball. Complex medley of spice, tobacco and the organic sweetness of liquor. However, while it was the server's \"hands down\" choice between two Cardamaro-based cocktails: this and the Wayfarer, I must respectfully disagree.\n-- (+) Wayfarer: Very good. Again, complex and involved like the Forbidden Lowball, but no mixer makes the drink remain that way as the time passes.\n-- (-) Sandbar: This one was the most disappointing. It was grapefruit juice and sparkling wine. Highly de-recommended.\n\n+ Good Appetizers. \n--(+) Chips were good and flavorful\n--(+) Farm toast was filled with flavor, but too jammy/fruity/sweet. The plums dominated the flavor, instead of accentuating the wonderful flavors of the cheese and nuts.\n\n- Meh entrees.\n--(~) The Cod had no real flavor of its own. The corn salsa bed beneath had good flavor. The clams, nothing spectacular. NOTE: It's rare to have a seafood dish include meat. This dish had pork. I think this was the outlier on the prices, and was not worth the price.\n--(+) Spicy Shrimp with Grits were good in flavor and consistency. \n\n~ Good dessert\n--(~) We had the pot-de-creme. It was flavorful, but didn't floor us.\n\nMyriad isn't overpriced. But it's not cheap either. I think if Yelp could show $$.5, that would be most appropriate.\n\nThe server did appear to be very rehearsed (It's funny - I used this word, and before submitting, saw someone else's review using the same term!). I don't really like it when that happens - I'd prefer that servers were hired for who they are - for their own personality.\n\nThe only surprise throughout the dinner was the server's severe lack of care when we expressed disappointment at seeing meat in our entree. The cod dish has \"guanciale\", which we now know is pork. This was our oversight. We generally ask about an ingredient when we suspect it might render our meal useless. It's rare (almost never) that we find a seafood entree that uses meat, so we didn't really look deeper. When we asked the server about this foreign presence in our meal, his reaction was basically \"Yes, that's meat. It's pork. It's listed on the menu. Enjoy your meal\". \n\nWe might go back for light fares. But for dinner, I'd skip Myriad.", "author": "Kunjal R."}

Our waitress ended up being one of the GM's of the restaurant (I honestly forget her name), but we didn't find this out until after dinner.  She also told us some of her recommendations and we decided on the some of the best plates of food I have had in a while.  \nThe cocktails were bomb.... you know they had booze in them, but were tasty enough that you could pair them nicely with dinner.  We got this bread to start with... it was the best piece of bread I have literally ever had.. it had goat cheese and apricot spread on it.. I was truly shocked... then we got the salmon and the pork tacos... we split and both of them were equally bomb.  After dinner, we were speaking with our waitress and we all shared an incredible glass of wine.  we thanked her for making our night!!! and would definitely recommend this place to anyone passing by the mission.  both of these two ladies made dinner special.", "author": "Andrew S."}

From the hostess to the bartender to the other staff members this place delivered. And I haven't even gotten to the food. I sat at the bar, felt welcome and comfortable sitting at it as a single. Some restaurants layouts don't lend itself to this but Myriad got this right too. Lighting is dim but not too dark, music at the right level, cutlery/glassware/dish ware also gave a quality vibe. \n\nOk, the food. Wow. Top shelf. \n\nHeirloom tomato salad, fresh and delicious with fresh burrata was amazing. Halibut with clams and a broth that a sane man would kill to soak it up with bread, ridiculous. Ice cream cookies that bring you back to childhood. I was still licking my fingers after they took the plate away - yes I definitely used my hands and these cookies (2 of them), with blackberry ice cream were stupid delicious. \n\nPaired with a reasonably priced Tempranillo and they have one very satisfied customer. \n\nThey've been open just 2 weeks and have their sh*t together. \n\nYum.", "author": "Mike T."}

The ambiance is nice--dimly lit, not too loud, but not quiet either.\n\nFOOD - 4.5 stars\n- Deviled eggs: standard, can be a tiny bit on the salty side\n- Heirloom tomatoes, burrata, charred croutons, and balsamic: the small plate special of the day - very tasty, really can't go wrong with tomatoes + burrata\n- Fried chicken sammies: OMG YUM. served on HAWAIIAN ROLLS--what?? the fried chicken was crispy and very juicy; I do wish there had been some element of spice though\n- Bacalaitos: my friend described it as a \"very fancy fish stick\" -- we love fish sticks. \n- Grass-fed beef burger: fairly standard burger. tasty, but not anything extraordinary\n- Pappardelle with pork cheeks: yum, this was definitely one of the highlights of our meal\n- Ricotta zeppoles + chai creme anglaise + bourbon caramel: such light and delicious little fried balls of dough!\n\nDRINKS - 4.5 stars; very solid cocktail list\n- Mission statement: yum!\n- Forbidden lowball: yum!\n- Wayfarer: yum! -- more on the bitter side; sherry flavour is very distinct\n- Cubano: yum! very refreshing and light\n- Orpheus: aftertaste reminded us of a very dark chocolate -- not as \"yum\" as the Wayfarer, but it grows on you\n\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars\nOur waitress was really personable and quirky, and offered us great recommendations. She also went ahead and got the chef to add on a third fried chicken sammy for us since we had three people (each order comes with two). As far as timing goes, the food all came out very quickly.\n\nPRICE - 4 stars\nFood + drinks for three people (everything I listed above) was $160 after tax.

I just cant do it.\n\nLately, when seeking out restaurants on yelp, my eyes immediately scan to the bottom on the home page: \"New businesses in San Francisco\"\n\nI know what you're thinking, what a rebel I am.\n\nTwo things: a) I'm too lazy to search by food type and b) most new restaurants are too new to have a line.\n\nMyriad Gastro Pub was instantly moved to the front of the line. Why? Because they took online reservations.\n\nI made reservations for Sunday brunch, table for two. A simple task for most, but believe me when I say..... it gets messed up more than not (or I end of being one of \"those people\" in a hyped up line anyway). Oddly enough, I've walked past Myriad a handful of times but just having paid much attention to it nor have I ever wondered what it was.... Just assumed it would be another mission hot spot closed in a few months like the ramen place before it.\n\nI was excited to dine in after I did a bit more research and read some reviews, it looked promising despite my hatred for the neighborhood.\n\nWe opted for small plates as we indulged in a heavy breakfast so we opted for:\n\n1) Deviled eggs. GOOD. Not \"wow\" good, but good. I was expected more flair in the ingredients (as most \"gastro pubs\" do) but it just tasted like my mom's. Don't give me wrong....i like my mom's deviled eggs, but I wouldn't pay $2 each for them.\n2) The cream cheese pop tart. This just straight up sparked my interest. I think it's been years since I've had a pop tart, and this one was a reminder why. It was a bit too sweet for my liking but it paired nicely with the cream cheese. You can never go wrong with sweet and savory (unless you're the jerkoffs at dr. teeth down the street.... But that's another story for another  day).\n3) The watermelon salad: the winning dish of the brunch. Very cool, refreshing and tart. Had a nice kick of sea salt which put it a notch above great.\n4) Fried Chicken Sammies. Good, but not great. The pickled veggies on top were a nice touch.... But for $8, I should've gotten another order of the watermelon. I did enjoy the pickled bell peppers on the side, so much so that I now want to make them at home.\n\nWhat I appreciated most was our service. Our server was Ivy (at least that's what our ticket said, the jury is out). She was super friendly, but not annoyingly friendly. She was prompt, yet we didn't feel rushed. She gave recommendations, yet didn't slam the \"deal of the day\" down our throats. And she was just a nice breathe of fresh air for SF. We dine out, often, and my lady even had to pull her aside and tell her how fantastic she was.... So yeah, it was that good. Someone promote this girl.\n\nI was weary of the neighborhood and the trendiness t hat I was expecting, but couldn't have asked for a better experience.\nI was a tad bummed that I didn't get the opportunity to try the bone marrow or some of the dinner items... but that just means that I have to come back. for that, I am okay with.\n\nThanks myriad for the outstanding brunch experience and \"Ivy\" for being the cherry on top.", "author": "Ryan L."}

We started with deviled eggs -- among the best I've had.  My partner opted for the hamburger which he said was perfectly grilled.  And I loved that it is accompanied by five or six amazing fries cut, I think, from russet potatoes.....so much more preferable than a plate half covered with forgettable box fries.  I chose the lamb sandwich and that was equally remarkable.  Overcooked lamb is dreadful while underdone lamb is stringy.  I'm not sure how the chef prepares this lamb, but it was beautifully grilled with a hint of a charcoal finish.  The Mr. reports that his glass of rioja was more than acceptable and I discovered that Pilsner Urquell is even better in the can....who knew?

Again, zero flavor and undercooked beans. I actually asked for salt. My boyfriend got the lamb sandwich which he said was 'ok' and 'dry'. I always feel like people rate less expensive restaurants easier. Just because you have a happy hour and reasonable prices doesn't mean I'm giving you a pass. Not going back.", "author": "Bita A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-24", "description": "So I'm a bit delayed in writing this review - about two weeks ago I visited Myriad for brunch, and then a couple of days later, for their happy hour/dinner.  And I will say this - both the food and service on both visits were FANTASTIC.  Bites included the deviled eggs (the sprinkling of flaked sea salt MAKES them), butternut squash soup (velvet yumminess), polenta/grits with squash, kale, and poached egg (very good - but made especially delicious with my addition of a little of their bourbon bacon maple syrup), chicken sammies (simply yum), and the cardamom-sugar donut holes.  No, they're not actually called donut holes on the brunch menu but their name slips my mind!  \n\nThe service - both in the restaurant and at the bar - is attentive without being invasive, and also seems genuine in terms of their interest in your enjoyment of the food, which is often missing in some restaurants.  Also, I feel that for the beautiful quality of the food, the pricing is quite good.\n\nThe only element of the experiences that seemed a bit odd was the music playing on both occasions.  It was sort of an old Motowny-type vibe.  Don't get me wrong - Motown is fabulous.  But for the contemporary food preparations (from a multitude of cultures) and the cool (but not hipstery) environment, it doesn't feel like the right fit.  Maybe something more adult alternative - the likes of Craft Spells, Of Monsters and Men, Chet Faker, Death Cab for Cutie....Or perhaps even R&B/Soul inspired but more current - Jill Scott, Miguel, Joss Stone... But who am I kidding - the music doesn't matter a ton with food this damn good.\n\nLastly, I'll be curious to see if this remains a 7 days a week joint.  I love going into a great place on a Monday or Tuesday night and always being able to find a seat at the bar for great bites of food.  But, it also makes me worry that a place like that may not be able to stick around for the long haul because of the costs involved.  I wouldn't be surprised if Myriad ends up being closed for those slower evenings; but maybe over the next couple of months the news will travel about this lovely neighborhood restaurant and they won't need to be :)", "author": "Lisa T."}

It was hot that day and still warm in the restaurant when we arrived at 6:30. The front windows were open so that helped cool things off. Our server apologized for the heat and told us about a special cocktail made with frozen watermelon. It sound refreshing but we didn't try it. \n\nI had a champagne cocktail and my date has something with whiskey. Both were fine, but nothing too exciting. My second drink was made with port and similar to sangria. This drink was delicious! I will get that one again. \n\nWe each had the deviled egg. The crispy shallot was the best part. Otherwise, not much different from what we make at home. And, there was too much oil on it for me. I tried to wipe some of it off first and it was still too much oil. \n\nI ordered the salad with the pepitas and avocado. This salad was delicious. Nice mix of ingredients, not too heavy on the dressing and the avocado was perfectly ripe. Not too soft but just soft enough to be creamy.\n\nThe best (and most interesting) part of the meal was the butternut squash gratin. Slices of squash with onion, sage and two kinds of cheese. It comes out in a sizzling little skillet which you are warned is very hot and not to touch. Duh. So while I'm being very careful not to touch the skillet, I (stupidly) accidentally touch the handle with the side of my middle finger. That area where your finger connects to your hand that is rarely touched by anything. No tough skin, no callouses. WOW it hurt. I plunged my hand into my water glass, took a huge swig of my cocktail and tried not to yelp in pain. Our server brought me ice and offered to find burn medication. He was very gracious about my careless move. I was so focused on scooping out the gratin goodness I didn't even notice the handle. My burn hurt for a good 15 minutes and then it was just uncomfortable after that. It was all worth it. The gratin was that good. And, my date let me have most of the dish because he felt bad I'd burned myself. \n\nMy date ordered the burger which he said was good and the fries were the best fries I've ever had. More like wedges sliced thick and fried so the edges are super crispy.\n\nFor dessert we had the ice cream sandwiches and the peach oat pecan crisp. Both were delicious.", "author": "S T."}

I highly recommend getting these. The third meal was the bone marrow. DO NOT pass up on this dish. Oh my god it was good. No, it was phenomenal. The last meal I had was the papardelli with pork cheeks. It was sooo good and the noodles with it were amazing. If you are around the Mission area, you need to go here. You won't regret it. From my understanding, it is a new restaurant and judging by the food, you might want to go before it becomes difficult to get in because that food was too good. \nI want to add that the atmosphere was comforting and the service was personal. Something I didn't find in the other restaurants I visited. I myself am a cook in Ohio, so I feel that I couldn't pass up on reviewing this newly started restaurant. Again, you won't be disappointed with your experience here.", "author": "James C."}

Asked about a Pinot Gris which he said was 'bone dry'  it wasn't & was more fruity flavor.  Food was good.  Nothing to write home about.  We passed on dessert and coffee, had been there 1. 5 hours, were still finishing our wine - spent over $200 for 4 of us & the host comes over to ask us if we're going to be hanging out awhile.  Prefaces the question with 'i'm not trying to be rude but....\"  But you are rude.  Any restaurant worth their salt never asks that.  And there were seats available if a party was waiting.  I don't think 1.5 hours is extremely long to indulge in wine, apps & entrees.  We will never, ever go back.", "author": "KEL C."}

Plenty of seating and none of the \"communal seating\" bullshit.  Also, for those also from NJ they have a Taylor ham, egg, and cheese sandwich which is really great.  This may be my new go-to restaurant in the mission.", "author": "Mackenzie B."}

Simple, elegant and straight forward but so very well done.\nWe started with the deviled eggs that were conversation stoppers. We shared a moment of silence as we both savored them. In other words, they gave us pause.\n\nThe staff was a delightful combination of knowledgeable, hospitable and fun- which was a blast. as well as easy and delightful!\n\nThe flank steak and the butter with scotch were my favorite.\n\nGreat place and totally worth the try.", "author": "Deagon W."}

Other items you must try, Jersey wedge, farm toast, shrimp & grits. Save room for dessert can't go wrong with any of them but I loved the Zeppole.\nLove, love this place!", "author": "Ana L."}

My issue is with the portion size. We ordered the bone barrow ($11) which came with one bone two pretty good size pieces of bread. The bone contains barely any marrow which was a totally bummer because what we could taste was pretty good. I would have been please if there were 2 pieces of bone that came with the order. We also ordered the spiced potato chips with the yogurt horseradish dip, these were really good, great flavor on both the chips and the yogurt dip! Lastly we ordered the chicken sliders ($11), this is where the majority of our issue lies.. These things (2) are small and when I say small I mean maybe a 50 cent piece size. Don't get me wrong, these were also very very tasty, great flavor on the slaw and the chicken was cooked just right with enough crunch from the fried breading.. I just think that if you're going to charge $11 and going to offer your customers that portion size, a minimum of 3 pieces should come with this order. Another bummer was they were out of the sangria we ordered and the dude who sat next to us (6 inches away) was speaking so loud that the people driving by outside could hear him..", "author": "Javier C."}

We were a little disappointed in the the pappardelle with pork cheeks.  The addition of mushrooms seemed somehow off, in terms of texture.  They were rubbery and seemed superfluous.  The portions were very generous of everything-- two diners split the salad and could have split the pappardelle.  This is a very new spot.  I might try it again when they've worked out some of the kinks.  The service was fine-- our server was very dude about everything.", "author": "Heather G."}

From the moment we arrived, we were warmly greeted by Wesley one of their Managers and escorted to the dining room situated on the right side of the restaurant.  Our server Paul was knowledgable, made wonderful recommendations on the menu (& described them beautifully), professional and charming... Since we had heard about their Cocktail Program, we started with the Forbidden Lowball, Cubano & Canela y Cereja... All wonderful... Then we reviewed the wine list which was approachable, offered a lovely variety of wines from around the world and California of course, and well priced....We enjoyed the Deviled Eggs with Salsa Verde, the Farm Toast (fromage blanc, sage-roasted plums, toasted pistachios), followed by the Jersey Wedge, not your typical wedge, much more interesting with pickled onions, bacon, dry jack cheese & a delicious smokey thousand island dressing; the Crispy Fried Chicken Sammies (sliders with an amazing slaw & pickled vegetables); Bacalalitos (salt cod fritters with lemon aioli & crispy capers) and the BEST was the Spiced Shrimp, creamy grits (omg, the grits!!!!) & albarino-butter sauce.  The food was inventive, paced properly & sooooooo good!  Later in the evening, the Chef Tricia Tracey came over to ask us how our meal was & to thank us for coming in.  WHO does that?  A Chef with no attitude, coming over to the table to thank us for dining with them!!!  We will definitely be back.  It's our new favorite 'go to' spot!", "author": "Tracey R."}

We were skeptical but decided to take a chance given the number of great restaurants opening up in the mission.  There was a good chance this one might be one of the good ones.  We were pleasantly surprised by the friendly and attentive staff that served us with their knowledge of the dishes and their patience in letting us figure out the menu.  They had a nice selection of savory small plates (bone marrow, farmers toast, and shrimp and grits), of which all were excellent.  We decided to split the halibut as an entree given we were feeling a little full from small plates.  The halibut turned out to be a delicious combination of light, buttery halibut, clams,  and perfectly saut\u00e9ed pork belly, corn, and dried sweet tomatoes in a tarragon clam broth.   We were quite impressed with all the dishes and felt completely satiated. I had a nice glass of Malbec/Syrah and my wife had a glass of champagne which we started the meal with and ended up complimenting everything nicely.  I can definitely recommend.  There is a bar and the drinks look great.  I will definitely return for happy hour and more of the small plates.", "author": "Abe J."}

Ordered a nice and reasonably priced bottle of Rose with some deviled eggs and a panzanella salad (a special for the day). Then we shared the pickled vegetables, the roast lamb sandwich and the MGP steak fries. Everything, particularly the sandwich, was great. For dessert we picked one of the starters -- roasted peaches with goat cheese, which was an excellent end to the meal. All in all, we were very satisfied with our meal.

I started with a chai based cocktail that I ordered strictly because I was scared of a chai based cocktail. My fears were unfounded; that drink was fantastic. We got deviled eggs and they made me oh so bitter. I had been going through life secure that I made the best deviled eggs; once again I was proved wrong. We then went on to have the Jersey wedge salad because my wife is under the misguided belief that you must always order a salad. Good thing she did; that roughage was damn tasty. We also got an order of shrimp and grits; then the record scratched to a halt. If you eat at Myriad and aren't allergic to shellfish you must order this. If you eat at Myriad and are allergic to shellfish order a side of grits. Holey moly. I got the halibut and clams and loved it. My wife got the hanger steak and said it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The stone fruit and berry crisp was a great way to end the meal. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The Chef came by our table and chatted us up. Maybe I'm attention starved, but I love it when they do that. She seemed to actually enjoy the interaction unlike some times when it seems like the chef would rather eat tinfoil than talk to their tables. *** All you \"people who hate children in public places even though you were one time a child yourself you self-absorbed, entitled, way too serious, goon\" stop reading now. To the rest of you: Our 4  1/2 year old son was with us and loved it. He devoured his chicken sammie and steak fries and that alone would bring us back. When the Chef came to our table she goofed around with the boy and didn't at all make us feel like we were insane for thinking our child should sit and eat at a restaurant that didn't provide a kids meal and a menu you can color on. Thanks Myriad, we will be back for brunch soon.", "author": "Leland X."}
