Our party of 4 had to of the chicken pannini's (not really pannini's, but delicious looking sandwiches on delicious focaccia bread and 2 Eggs Benedicts (one regular and one w/ crab cakes).

Surprised this place remains open. I'd imagine rents high. Pizza's were good but who knows how they prepared it as my family was up sick all night following this meal. \n\nAsked for chicken parm with side of pasta with garlic and oil. I got chicken cutlet with no sauce at all and when I asked for a side of sauce it was 20 min later and it just looked nasty. I don't know if the food was clean or not.

My first complaint are the chairs... they are cute, and stylish to look at but are so uncomfortable! If you're a larger man, or a curvy lady like our table... you won't be comfortable. The circulation to my legs were cut off, and I couldn't wait to het up. Service was okay.. everyone was nice, but had to wait a while for our check. Seems like it was understaffed. At first, when we ordered.. the server was hesitant about making a simple modification to one of the dishes, and said it couldn't be done. Then he brought the dish out with the modification made, so not sure what that was about. Maybe because it would have taken him longer/understaffing. I will say the breakfast was decent... they made everything the way we asked. My last complaint was the fruit. There should be no excuse for pre sliced fruit...Strawberries were not freshly sliced, they were wet, and soaked in sugar water.  cantaloupe, and honeydew were at least 2 days old. Fresh fruit, same day is so important. Overall 3 stars is the best I can do. I would definitely check out the other options in the area for breakfast. There are so many.", "author": "Roget M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-23", "description": "Ok, I need to start at the beginning. We wandered around Fisherman's wharf and it was a madhouse so we opted to just go back to the Hotel Zoe and eat at its commingled restaurant, Pescatore's, a   supposedly $$ value-wise. After perusing the menu though, most dishes of any consequence were $26-39.  In my book, really that's $$$, especially for pasta. \n\nSo as a test, we opted for a Ceasar and an appetizer, the seafood antipasti.  The Ceasar was great, complete with generous anchovies and a perfect Ceasar dressing. The seafood Antipasti however was applaudable in presentation but  laughable in content. 2 tiny shrimp, 1/2 doz quarter-sized clams and 4 mussels and 2 lemon slices!  In all honesty, this wasn't an appetizer, it was a \"shell game\" as that's all there was for $16.50. But there's a bit more;\n\nWe ordered a couple dirty Grey Goose Martini's and truthfully, knew we'd pay a bit more. But to our surprise, out came a 1.5 oz mini martini sampler- glass with two large olives, at $14 bucks a throw. \n\nBottom line is, this place boasts upper class but with a chintzy twist.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-03", "description": "I ate here twice during my stay at Hotel Zoe. The first time I dined, I made reservations months in advance. I didn't need reservations because when I walked in around 7:30 a.m., there was only a few tables occupied. This was Black Friday. I told the person who walked up the front that I made a reservation. I didn't see him check me in on Open Table, so, of course, I always get worried.  I really dislike when people don't actually look at the reservation when someone went out of their way to make one.  Perhaps maybe they made notes under the reservation that are important such as a birthday or food allergies. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that he checked me in afterwards. \n\nI ordered the crab benedict both times.  The first time I ordered it with coffee, but the second time I didn't since I realized the hotel offered free coffee in the lobby. \n\nAfter the first time I dined, Pescatore marked me as a \"no show\" on Open Table, which I get dinged for. We use Open Table so we can get points and redeem them in the future.  I contacted Open Table and told them what I ordered and the name of the credit card holder that it was under, but they wanted me to show a receipt. I told them I didn't keep it, so I had to ask my friend to look under his online bank statement to take a screenshot of it to get my points. A lot of work just to get the points if the restaurant had just marked me as checked in.\n\nThe second time I came down, I made it a point to tell the person at the front to check me in because they didn't mark me in last time. He said, \"Sometimes this happens.\"  But it doesn't have to happen. He said he didn't know how to work the Open Table, so he had to call someone else over to check me in. \n\nOther than that, the servers were friendly.  The eggs benedict were better at Hollywood Cafe and cheaper down the street, but this one doesn't have a wait so it's more convenient for hotel guests.

I didn't think it could be that bad, so I decided to come give it a try anyways. \n\nI made a reservation just in case, but I didn't really need one. We were like one or two minutes late, and the person at the front actually said we were late... And not just jokingly. I was a bit surprised to hear that, but I didn't take it too seriously. We got seated near the window, but we wanted the higher seats near the bar, so I asked to move. He gave the ok, and we moved. However, our server took forever to come. He said he forgot about us cause we were in the corner... I mean I guess we were, but that doesn't mean you can just not see us. \n\nI ordered the petrale sole ceviche, grilled ribeye salad, and pear sorbet, while my friend also had the ceviche, but ordered the stuffed cannelloni and chocolate gelato instead. I had high expectations for the ceviche because I love shrimp ceviche. However, this was different from what I expected. Alright it looks different, but I didn't think the taste would be so far off too. The sole was soaked in lime juice and it was waaaaay too sour. I somehow finished the plate by adding pepper, but my friend didn't touch hers at all. \n\nAwhile after the entrees came. My friend and I split half half of each of our entrees. The ribeye salad was literally a super thin piece of ribeye that I could've probably cooked myself over a HUGE bed of spinach with a few pieces of avocado. 95% was spinach. My friend didn't like the dressing so she didn't even eat the spinach. The cannelloni wasn't good either. I felt like it wasn't fully cooked because the pasta part felt really hard still. The filling wasn't anything special either. Worst of all, my friend found a huge bone inside hers. \n\nLastly, we thought you can't go wrong with dessert. Thankfully we were right. I thought we would only get one small scoop but we got two scoops along with the biscotti. The pear sorbet had a really good tart taste but I couldn't really taste the pear. Normally I don't really eat biscottis, but I had to counter the sourness. My friend really liked the chocolate gelato but she wasn't a fan of the biscotti. \n\nOverall, service wasn't great nor was the food. I wouldn't come back again. This place was such a huge disappointment compared to the 3 course lunch I had earlier this week at Starbelly. I wish I went back there again instead of trying this place.", "author": "Tina P."}

It has never happened to us before that a server would bring something without first checking if we needed/wanted.\nIt happened to us twice while at the Pescatore and I witnessed it happen to other customers there. What they did differently was send the unrequested food back.\n\nOn the second visit, during the evening, they had more customers than the first visit and, apparently, they were not coping well with that. We sat at the bar and, even thought there were two bartenders there, it took a long time for them to acknowledge us.

When I saw the 2016 SF Restaurant Week lunch menu, I thought it would be a great time to try Pescatore.  We started with a Petrale Sole Ceviche.  The lime was strong and the finely sliced pepper rings were a perfect spicy aftertaste to the soft (although somewhat chewy) texture of the sole.  The Prosecco I had to go with it was good for cutting through the acidity.  The 2nd course was the ribeye steak salad.  Laced with picked red onion and bordered by creamy avocado slices, the fresh baby spinach salad is topped with generous slices of ribeye steak.  What binds all the flavors together is the well blended light balsamic vinegrette...which lightly dresses the salad without overpowering the flavors of the steak or veggies.  Lunch was finished off by a perfect pear sorbet...fresh and a perfect palate cleansing end to a pleasant lunch. The service was good and the staff friendly.

Upon arriving 10 min early for our reservation we were greeted by a hostess who confirmed our reservation and then disappeared, leaving us at the host stand alone. The restaurant was approximately 20% populated (many open tables). Another couple came into the restaurant and asked us if anyone was working at the host station. About 5 min later a nice waitress stopped by to ask us if we have been helped and we did say that someone greeted us and confirmed our reservation, but disappeared afterwards. The waitress then tells us that the hostess went on break. ? The waitress apologized and asked us if we wanted a booth and that one would be ready in just a few minutes. 10 minutes later the hostess returned from break and did not say anything to us and grabbed 2 menus and said follow me. The couple and my family were looking at each other and then the husbands both said at the same time \"I'm sorry, who are you addressing?\"  The hostess said \"you two\" and then sat the couple. Then across the restaurant a gentleman who was bussing the booth table waved his arms to get our attention that the booth was ready for us. We sat down and a few minutes later was greeting by our waitress. She was very nice. We order 2 glasses of wine and while it took 15 minutes to get the wine, it was good. We ordered our meal: 2 appetizers and a salad and 2 meals. It took almost 15 minutes to get our appetizers: clam chowder for my daughter, my wife and I split calamari. Both arrived cold, had to flag down the gentleman bus man to assist. He was on point and took care of replacing both with hot versions. The calamari was good. The clam chowder was below par on flavor and consistency. I reminded the waitress about our salad that was suppose to come out with the appetizers and she quickly returned with it. Salad was good. Meals came out hot. Daughter had bolognese and we split the seafood pasta. Both were marginal in the taste / flavor dept. summary: the hostess adds no value to this establishment.

Maybe the hotel will be able to get a new restaurant, or new team for their current restaurant to turn around guest experience.\n\nA couple of things that I don't think should happen in guest service, excuses for example, while we dined a gentlemen came in and asked to sit on the patio, the server replied, \"we are a little busy so we may not get to you for a while.\"  \n\nThis was actually our server, who took our drink order, forgot to bring our waters, and when I asked what type of 21st amendment they were pouring, he was unaware that this was the brewery and not the name of the beer.  Of course, this was the last time we did see our waiter until he came to clear the plates.\n\nThe food runner did come by to take the order, and drop off the food, and our server then came back to clear our dishes, which I would have thought was nice except he noticed a table next to us had been sitting with empty plates for even longer than we had, so we stopped interacting with us and started to clear there table.\n\nI would have passed on this information to a manager during our brief stay, however there didn't seem to be one working.\n\nThere were five tables that were eating dinner (15 guests total), two tables left right as we sat down, so three from that point on, and about 8 guests at the bar.  It should have been an easy task to provide service with the five team members that we saw when we arrived and which grew to seven 35 minutes later when we left.\n\nBrought back my frustration just to write this review but thought it was necessary.", "author": "Sean M."}

I also enjoyed the Margarita Pizza both times which did not disappoint.\n\nOn one of the visits my colleague & I shared a bottle of the 2012 Punto Final Malbec.

The panini was on focaccia and not pressed but that is a common thing I see in San Francisco.  I might be wrong but I thought paninis were supposed to be pressed.  Either way, it was a decent steak sandwich.\n\nConsidering the place's name roughly translates to Fish Restaurant I was a little surprised at the lack of fish on the menu.

This place exceeded our expectations, especially since it is attached to a hotel. We came down to SF for a quick business trip and stayed close to the wharf. I had compiled a list of restaurants that I wanted to try during the 4 nights we were there. We were exhausted our first night there so decided go downstairs and try the hotels restaurant, not expecting much. WOW! Were we surprised. The food, the service, the ambience and the drinks were superb. Hard to believe this is a hotel restaurant. We ended up eating at Pescatore 3 of the 4 nights in San Francisco. We did not have one negative experience and tried something different each night. The portions were perfect and our server, Jorge, went  above and beyond to provide excellent service. Cannot recommend this place enough. Great bang for your buck!", "author": "Elle B."}

She even pointed out substitutions and off menu items that the kitchen could make. I almost jumped ship when the chicken parmesan came out... but I held true and went with a Caesar salad, the roasted polenta and the Verde pizza which had pesto mushrooms and spinach. \n\nEverything was amazing and made even better by the gin based 'Aviations' that the bartender Chris kept preparing :)\n\nI will continue to consider this place one of my favorites in San Francisco.", "author": "Sean O."}

However when friends from out of town were staying in the area , hubby and I packed ourselves into our IQ and headed off to the \"other side\" of town.  After much deliberation over where to eat we settled on Pescatore.  It was conveniently located, parking wasn't a nightmare and they had room for our party of 5 on a Sunday night.\n\nThe restaurant itself is simple and nice inside.  Not stuffy or trying to be too kitchy.  Our server Marlowe was amazing!  He was lively, kind, professional and made the evening .  Food was about a 3.5 but the overall experience was a 4.  Our arugula/ frisee  apple salad was super tasty, not over dressed and a generous portion.  We had three different fish dishes and two pies.  The pizza definitely looked fine but I am spoiled in the pie dept and since I didn't try them, I will not review them.  The sea bass was a lovely cut of fish and perfectly prepared, however I thought the sauce was a little heavy.  I am sure it would appeal to most people; I just like my fish served a little lighter.  My husbands fish was perfect.  It was the trout special of the day and was LOVELY.  Light, flaky and super flavorful.  He had the winner of the night. Portions are generous.  Prices not bad for the area.\n\nDesserts were yummy, I loved the bread pudding and the fresh blackberry parfait.\n\nI can't say I will become a regular because of the distance from my house, but when people are staying in the area I will definitely direct them to Pescatore.", "author": "Monika S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-04-18", "description": "Let me start by saying that I grew up in San Francisco.  My husband and I are homeowners here in the city and, because we both love being here, we work hard to stay in San Francisco.  With this being said, the time we spend together, where we go for breakfast, lunch or dinner is important to us.\n\nWe like taking our motorbikes out on the weekends.  Just this past Sunday, we did so and decided to stop in to Pescatore for breakfast.  We asked for a booth, were told the last remaining one was \"reserved\", which irked me a little, but we were hungry so, we chose to eat in the bar area.  A waiter by the name of Juan came over to our table after we'd been seated by the manager, Francisco. We ordered coffee and water, no ice, with lemon along with breakfast.  We had napkins but no flatware. \n\nWe probably waited a good 15 minutes before our coffee arrived which was fine given we were talking.  We noticed a young couple behind us get seated by Francisco.  Juan, our waiter and I'm assuming the couple behind us' waiter was nowhere to be found.  \n\nAfter about another 15 minutes, our breakfasts arrived.  I had ordered an English muffin, NOT toast.  I got toast.  There was no butter, no flatware and our water wasn't delivered until well after we'd begun eating.  The water had ice in it after I'd specifically asked for no ice.  My husband had to get up and get us our flatware as well as ask for butter for his toast. The couple behind us, who were not acknowledged by Juan after he served our breakfasts, left the restaurant.\n\nAt this point, we've finished our breakfast and are waiting for the check. We wait another 15 minutes and don't receive the check.  Again, Juan, our waiter, is nowhere to be seen.  Now, I'm pissed at the lack of care we've received.  \n\nI ask to speak to the manager.  A heavy-set latino man mumbles something and half-way points to Francisco.  I let Francisco know in a very loud voice that we come there to have breakfast, relax and enjoy ourselves. I remind him that we are NOT tourists and that we like to frequent the same places again and again explained, in detail, why we were dissatisfied with the unconscious service we received per Juan.  \n\nFrancisco took care of my husband and me.  He apologized for the waiter Juan's behavior and assured us that should we come back, this will not happen again.\n\nThank you, Francisco for remedying the behavior of Juan, the errant staff member.  Please remember what we discussed...you cannot play, \"Daddy\" to all your staff and expect them to do things for themselves at your level.  Make them work as hard as you do and hold them accountable. Long short of this is this...Francisco, train them to work for you and be just as good if not better than you.    That's why you're in charge, you're the manager.  Because you listened and treated us well, we'll be back.\n\nThanks again for everything.", "author": "Alacrity I."}

While on another table, some nice sized shrimp. \n\nKyla, our server was very prompt with our waters, helpful, and attentive to our cocktail orders right away. I like that, I like to sit, order a drink, and THEN mull over the menu. \n\nFor our appetizer, we ordered the Bruschetta for $8.00 Now I don't claim to be any kind of Italian food connoisseur, but when we dine Italian, I always get that. And brother... this was the best to date. If I were a vegetarian, I'd eat this daily. \n\nMain entrees: I had the Gamberi Fra Diavolo ( $22.00) roasted jumbo prawns, spicy tomato compote, on fried polenta cake. Prawns were cooked perfect, not over done and hard. Gotta say the sauce WAS quite spicy, the way I eat my food, but I think a warning to others might be warranted. \n\nThe wife got the Bestecca ($25.00) Grilled rib eye cooked to right on the money medium rare. Must admit the wife and I are meat carnivores, and this steak ranks up there within the top three favorites! Soooo tasty, just the right seasoning, and tender.... oh my! You could almost cut it with a fork, while it seemed to just melt in your mouth... Heaven. \n\nFor dessert, we were both wondering what's a chocolate tort? Kyla explains, it's like a warm chocolate brownie, filled with chocolate, with raspberry sauce, and vanilla gelato. Lemme tellya folks worth every bit of $7.50. The cake like brownie, so warm and so moist. The chocolate center, doesn't just run out as you take a piece, it OOZES out ever so slowly... so warm.. so thick and chocolaty... so DECADENT! \n\nI'm sorry other Yelpers, couldn't have had an experience like ours, but like I said in the beginning , maybe we just lucked out.", "author": "Joe K."}

I tried a part of a meatball and immediately tasted what seemed to be hot pepper flakes...inside the meatball.

They let us go back to our hotel or room and said they would call us. I thought it was pretty cool that you could either chill in the hotel lobby or your room. You could also put the tab on your hotel bill. Service here is awesome no doubt. \n\nWe got a nice window seat but there was a draft. Luckily our amazing waiter came by and covered the seal that was letting air in. Since every pasta dish had seafood in it, I ordered the margherita pizza. It wasn't anything special and a little too greasy for my taste. I was worried about what the grease would do for my race the next day so I had the waiter recommend a tea to me. He did an excellent job telling us about their selection and we ended up ordering an African red bush. This is a loose leaf tea that came in a tea kettle and we were advised to let it steep and squeeze a few drops of lemon to kill the pizza grease. After a few cups, I was feeling better about the pizza grease I just consumed. \n\nOverall not a bad place and a great experience but I'm not sure I would dine here again.

The fact that I even have to give it a star is upsetting. My fiance and I were visiting SF during the weekend and after a few hours of walking, we were searching for a lunch spot. We, by chance, stumbled by Cafe Pescatore and after reading the menu, we decided that it looked decent enough for a quick lunch. Wow, were we wrong!\n\nFirst, there was one waiter for all the tables. This place wasn't packed, but, there were certainly a number of tables filled (assuming from the attached hotel?) that required more than 1 waiter. The waiter was clearly stressed running around to all of the tables. It was also very clear that there was serious tension between the kitchen staff and the waiter (we were seated right by the open kitchen, so we heard/saw all the arguments). At this point, I don't blame the waiter for arguing with the kitchen staff for being incompetent, b/c that's what they were.\n\nI ordered a mixed salad expecting a standard mixed salad (nothing too special). Not only was this \"salad\" pathetic, it cost eight dollars. The salad consisted of: a tiny, tiny plate with MAYBE 1/2 cup of greens, topped with a lot of cheese and a single sliced cherry tomato (almost like it snuck in there without the kitchen staff knowing). They didn't even put the walnuts on it that were on the menu description, and the mediocre dressing was on the side. I was shocked that they were trying to pass this off as a \"meal\", a lunch mixed salad or not, it was disgusting and the fact that they have the nerve to charge 8 dollars for something so sad is near extortion. \n\nMy fiance got a brunch meal--french toast. How can you mess up french toast? Apparently, you can. It was so soggy the bread was just crumbling apart, excessively sweet (yes, it's french toast, but, this was WAY over the top), and disgusting. He also ordered a side bowl of fruit (for 5 dollars, mind you) that never came. We eventually just cancelled the order. Finally, about 5 minutes before we paid the check, they bring over stale bread.\n\nThis place is so pathetic the people who work there even know it--the host (I guess that's what he was?) took %15 off our bill for no other reason than knowing the place sucks (we never complained about anything or mentioned a thing to them, except to cancel the fruit order).\n\nIf you're even in SF, never ever go here. It's a gigantic waste of money for food that's so below par it's frightening. There are so many beautiful restaurants near the water (or even in Union square, a very short trip away) that are such a better value.  Avoid at all cost.", "author": "Emily F."}

The Cesar Salad fared better in composition and again was fresh. The Mussels (and side of Fries) were delicious and had a unique mildly spicy tomato base.

We had out 2 dogs with us so we asked a waiter outside if we could sit outside with the dogs and he said yes, he'll be with me in a moment. I let my wife and mother sit outside while i waited at the front of the restaurant for about 20 mins. No one came to me, there was no host and the waiter i talked to earlier would not even look in my direction. I went and grabbed menu's on my own. Waited another 15-20 minutes at the table and still nothing. My wife went in to ask a manager for service. Finally a manager came out to take our order. We got our drinks in about 10 minutes, however after another 45 minutes, no food. All we ordered were 2 appetizers and a soup. There were a few tables occupied inside and 2-3 occupied outside, hardly a lunch rush so not sure why we were so neglected. After about 50 minutes, the waiter finally came and asked how we were. At that point, why bother, he hadn't so much as said hi in close to an hour! So we waited about about hour an half in total and still no food. I asked the manager to check us out as we could not wait anymore. She was nice enough to comp the 3 drinks we had, however not enough for us to ever consider this place again. The waiter acted like such a jackass, and had such an attitude problem that no comp would ever make up for such a bad experience. My mother in law is in town visiting so wasting an hour an half on nothing just sucks. Luckily there was a Trader Joe's close by and we picked up food to go home. Cafe Pescatore = Never again!\n\nThe manager was nice though. Can't knock her for the horrible experience. I think the owner and the overwhelmed/not competent waiter are to blame.

My three year old is a very picky eater and I knew she wouldn't eat much of her food and the best chance for her to even eat some of it was to make it as bland as possible.  So with that in mind, I decided to just order the Venticelli noodles with a little butter and shredded Parmesan on the side.  (Don['t worry, I get her veggies and Fruits in her somehow.  Its called squeezies and they are a godsend.)  Anyhow, she ate two bites of her food and decided she had a stomachache (bread should never be put on the table in from of a three year old or myself!) So, I finished her dish having decded not to order my own  and to just share my fiance's fetticine with clams and her choice.  I must say, it was the best pasta I have eaten in years and years and it didn't even have any special sauce or pairings!  I was shocked at how incredible pasta with a little butter and some cheese on top could taste.  I also adored my fiance's fetticine with clams and thought that I was in heaven for a moment when after eating the main dish, I was treated to the one of the most delicious desserts Id had in North Beach.  With all of the Tiramisus and other Italian delicasies in the vicinity, that is a lot to say.  I was really impressed with this little place and while there for dinner, we saw that they serve breakfast in the mornings.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-04", "description": "A major fall for a once-charming restaurant.\n\nMy midwestern parents, when visiting SF, love to stay at the Tuscan, the hotel that houses the Pescatore, and thankfully the hotel is still a lovely alternative to the dreary, enormous hotels in the area. While the 'rents always enjoy trying new types of food around town, having the Pescatore in house as a comfortable Italian option is convenient, and one of the best things about staying there. The food was always good, the service friendly, and the atmosphere cozy and warm. \n\nBut it's been over three years since my parents had come to town, and our experience last week shows that something terrible has happened to Pescatore in the mean time. On our most recent visit on a Tuesday night, very little went well. Even from the start, something about the room seemed off, with too many lights, and a giant cloth screen separating a back area, as if the place was under construction. The manager was that overly-friendly type that trips over into creepy, all wide eyed and slow-talking, like he was just barely covering up a seething rage. \n\nWhen our waitress finally arrived, we ordered a mixed seafood antipasti, and we were ready to order main courses but our waitress interrupted and said she'd get that appetizer order in and come back for our main course orders.\n\nA busboy delivered the antipasti, a small, blazing hot skillet of a handful of mussels and exactly two shrimp. The shells of the mussels were, of course, so hot they were impossible to handle, and both me and my father burned our hands.\n\nOur waitress never came back.\n\nFinally we flagged her down, and I said, \"excuse me, we'd like to order our main courses?\" And what do you think she did, apologize? No! \"Well, I was waiting for you guys,\" she said, angrily. We were dumbfounded. Waiting for us to do what, exactly?\n\nMain courses,when they got there, were sad. The sea bass came in a \"saffron cream sauce\" that looked like congealed yellow pudding. Not even that good. More like yellow glue paste. Cod was dull and flavorless. Prawns and polenta were fine but probably cost about 30 cents to make.\n\nMy dessert was advertised as some sort of apple tart, but it was a frozen toaster strudel, I swear to god, with the little packet of drizzly frosting? Yuck.\n\nOn a side note, my parents went there for breakfast without me another day, and had a similarly poor experience. The restaurant advertises new menu items on a card in the hotel rooms, but when my parents asked about them, they said \"No, those are only available for room service.\" Which a) is stupid, and b) was not indicated anywhere on the card in the room. They also managed to ignore a request for \"no cheese\" in an omelet.\n\nPescatore was never going to win any awards, but it was reliable and nice. Now it's embarrassing and sad. And hey, Tuscan Inn, you guys should know my parents are much less likely to want to stay there next time, as the bad restaurant experiences really colored their stay. Just FYI.", "author": "Ben G."}

We got to the hotel (yes it's in the Best Western Plus) early evening after a couple of days in Napa. Too lazy to go through the whole reservation/taxi thing so we thought we'd give it a try.  Atmosphere was comfortable, nice bar and very good service.  Started with the seafood antipasti.  Very fresh, flavorful, garlicky but not overpowering.  Liquid was delicious dipping sauce for the bread.  I had the special - squid-ink linguine with clams and mussels.  Pasta was homemade, seafood was fresh and sauce was perfectly balanced.  My wife had the capellini pomodoro - bright flavor and obviously fresh ingredients.   I would definitely dine here again, even if I wasn't staying at the hotel.", "author": "Dave K."}

She had a restaurant.com coupon for the meal, or I would probably have declined the invitation based upon their online menu, prices, and yelp reviews but since the meal was going to be discounted and I wanted to spend a little more time with family, I accepted. \n\nI ordered an Arnold Palmer and that was the best part of the meal aside from being able to spend some time with family. I didn't like the fact that they only refilled the iced tea portion of my drink and not the lemonaid. My sister ordered calamari and cheese stick appetizers. The calamari was pretty good and not overcooked, but I was not impressed with the cheese sticks even though they were primarily ordered for the kids. The free bread that they brought out was quite good, especially with the olive oil and balsamic.\n\nFor my entree, I thought the Fusilli Mediterranean sounded good. The marinara sauce was okay, but nothing special and the seared chicken breast was actually a few chunks of way overcooked and tasteless chicken. Two of the others ordered the ravioli con granchio. They got about 7 raviolis which weren't very impressive. The best choice was the prawns with polenta which came with 4 very large prawns in a nice presentation. \n\nAfter the meal, I excused myself to go to the restroom and found that it was a long walk through the hotel that the restaurant is attached to. I had asked one of the servers at the restaurant where it was and it would seem to me that they should have told me at that point that it was being remodeled and it was necessary to pick up a room key from the front desk to use the restroom in one of the hotel rooms. I didn't however find this out until I had walked all the way through the hotel and then had to go back to the front desk. \n\nFinally it should be noted that they add a 19% gratuity to the check for parties of 5 or more which I would have no problem with if the service had not been so lackluster. So needless to say, there are so many good restaurants in San Francisco that would be highly unlikely that I would ever eat here again.", "author": "Debi T."}

I sat at the bar and ordered a red wine which was fine. I then ordered the chicken parm for my meal. Although I love Italian food and my coworker raved about this place, I didn't enjoy this meal. The pasta was way al dente for my taste and the chicken was lightly breaded but soggy, all for $24.00 which I think is overpriced. The sauce seemed watered down, too. Not sure if they were going for a light sauce or they were rationing it. Perhaps it was a bad night for the cook or I picked the wrong entree. In either case, at this price point, I would expect quality and consistency. I actually prefer Olive Gardens chicken parm and they include free breadsticks and salad for $16.95. I'm willing to give restaurants a second chance, but it might be awhile before I return to this place.", "author": "David S."}

The food is generally very good, and service is usually good, but it can suffer if, for example, a large group arrives with no reservation. It's a tourist zone, so things like that happen.  Also, if the hotel is full, it can be crowded--especially at the bar--at peak times.\n\nThey do a nice cioppino, and they now make it with the local Dungeness crab.\n\nThe ribeye steak is wonderful, as is the spaghetti Bolognese. The Caesar salad is small, but the dressing is great and they have anchovies on request.  If you fancy pizza, keep in mind that on request they can make it with whatever ingredients they have on hand, so if you don't like the two or three house specials, ask what else is available.\n\nThe wine list has a decent selection of California and Italian wines.", "author": "Charlie G."}

I would recommend anywhere in North Beach up the street and you would get a better meal. The service was ok, but the policies on substitutions was rigid. I've actually never experienced anything like it. Even minor requests were met with concerns. We wanted penne not spaghetti and the waiter had to ask because the \"kitchen doesn't like substitutions\". We wanted a different sauce on the ravioli and he had to ask about that, \"but couldn't make any promises\". He charged me for a small amount of extra sauce which I needed because the raviolis were so dry. I would not recommend the pomodoro sauce as it was not a sauce but just some bland chopped tomatoes. The tomatoes soup was very good and so was the tiramisu, but they took a long time making the coffee and it came a good 10 min after the dessert.

Overall I give it two stars because for this town you can really do much better for a seafood/italian meal.  If you do come I think you'll still be fairly happy though.\n\nOkay, I came because I needed a place to eat dinner that allowed dogs and was good for kids as well and was within walking distance to Fisherman's Wharf.  This place met all those requirements and so away we went.\n\nWith the dog we were able to sit on the patio and they were very accommodating which was very nice on their part.  Actually the service here was actually very nice; however, the food really let us down.\n\nI've been to several restaurants in San Francisco over the years and have had some great meals there and was hoping for another one.\n\nWe started with the bruschetta appetizer which actually was decent.  The fresh shaved cheese on top was probably the best part.  The tomatoes were also good; however, I felt the bread let the dish down.  It was coated in what seemed like a pesto flavoring that I didn't think added to the dish.  I felt the free bread was actually better, ha.\n\nFor main courses my wife ordered the shrimp dish which also had polenta.  The shrimp were MASSIVE on the dish and five were included.  It had a tomato sauce with it that went well with the shrimp and the polenta.  Overall it was a decent dish.  I ordered the crab ravioli.  It came with about seven crab filled ravioli in a very, very watery sauce.  I was very surprised at how runny/watery the sauce was and it seemed to have very little flavoring at all.  The ravioli itself was good, maybe slightly undercooked, but the crab filling was tasty.\n\nWe normally would order desert at a place like this; however, given the fact we weren't that excited by the overall food we decided to skip that and simply go for some ice cream.\n\nOverall, you will probably be happy going here; however, if you are looking for a meal you will remember while in San Francisco you have some much better options.", "author": "Kyle M."}

It is just nice to be in any restaurant where it is clear that people care about what they are doing.  Also, the wine list is surprisingly interesting for a hotel restaurant.  I will also go back for a glass at the bar.  Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to everything else.  Each dish was edible, but the crab in my cioppino was scant and bland.  The prawns and fish were way over-cooked.  The broth was decent but could have been better, and there were huge, unpleasant chunks of garlic at the bottom of the bowl.  I will go back to this restaurant for the service and wine, and I will happily give them another chance for food, too.  There were too many positives so close to home to keep me away.

I completely understand how it may be a tourist trap (I go to school IN this tourist trap!), but I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThree of us had lunch there today, as an end of the semester thank-you. The prices, for lunch at least, are very reasonable and you get more, higher quality food than you do many places (especially those on the Pier). We had the veggie panini, chicken salad, and penne pasta. All three of us were very satisfied, and impressed, even. The dishes were flavorful and filling. They have an all-day happy hour on Mondays (though we didn't drink), with $3 glasses of wine. That's great! And, on the weekends, they waive the corkage fee, which is also awesome.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-13", "description": "We stayed at the Hyatt on North Point St, and after endless meals on Fisherman's Wharf, we decided we wanted to try something a bit less touristy. I broke out the Urbanspoon app on my iPhone, did some searching, and found Cafe Pescatore, a local Italian, ummm, \"favorite\" that got good reviews from both the Urbanspoon and Yelp communities. I am sorry to say I disagree with folks in both camps. \n\nIf first impressions are everything, then this place got a big black mark in the first five minutes we were there. After being told there would be a 15 minute wait, we were shuffled over to the bar to wait. Our kids were seated at a small table in the bar area, and although they were well-dressed and were behaving surprisingly well, I got the distinct impression they were not entirely welcome. After a couple of minutes at the bar, we were all asked to move again to the lobby of the adjoining hotel to wait until our name was called. I never mind waiting for a table, especially if the food is good, but a restaurant should at least have a place for people to wait. It struck me as disorganized, and I am not a fan of disorganization. \n\nAs for the food, it wasn't terrible, but it was far from good, and not even in the same universe as inspiring. My wife and I both ordered the Fettucine con Gamberetti (per the menu: fresh spinach fettuccine, tiger prawns, roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, basil, served with a parmesan cream sauce). Sounds good, right? Ha. It was a thick mass of \"if this is fresh, pigs will fly out of my ass\" pasta served under a pasty cream sauce with \"frozen shrimp that we'll pass off as tiger prawns\". I'll give them the roasted garlic. It was good.  But you can only eat so many cloves of garlic before you start peeling paint with your breath.  Our son ordered a bowl of clam chowder (a San Fran staple) that was on par with what you could order on the wharf for half the price.\n\nWhat pushed this place up from one stars to two was the ambiance. If you focus on the inviting sidewalk patio, white table cloths, classic tiled floors, and dark wood paneling, and ignore the snotty service and the half-ass food, you might be able to trick yourself into thinking you're eating a good meal.", "author": "Gavin S."}

A) I drank way too much the night before, and B) kiss my ass! Maybe the pushy used-car salesman thing works with the tourists, but as far as I'm concerned all you are doing is knocking percentage points off of your tip.\n\nThe breadservice was foccacia. Not like real Italian foccacia, but then again it was not as bad as the stuff they sell at Safeway. It wasn't crispy and chewy, but soft and was completely bereft of oil and salt on the top. Yeah, so it had decent flavor for \"bread\" but the little Italian ladies in my family would be horrified that such stuff was being passed off as our beloved foccacia.\n\nThe antipasto plate turned out to be a hodge-podge of blanched vegetables (broccoli, green beans, wax beans, cauliflower, onion, bell peppers, onions, mushrooms and a little fennel) and a little shredded domestic proscuitto, a couple slices of salame and a little shaved, young (read: cheap) parmesan. the plate was drizzled with a fake balsamic that is a caramel colored sugar syrup (no, really). This is just cheap and lazy cooking. How about grilling the vegetables and including some nice cherry peppers and fresh mozarella? And skip the balsamic, real or otherwise. A nice drizzle of quality extra virgin and a sprinkle of sea salt would have been perfect.\n\nFor my main course I had the Fettuccine Frutti ai Mare, since I looked the waiter straight in the eye (or at least where I thought his eyes were behind his sunglasses) and and asked him if the crab ravioli were frozen (they were). As it turned out the dish is sort of a re-envisioning of cioppino turned into a pasta dish, which is actually not a bad thing at all. The tomato sauce was a tiny bit spicy and somewhat rich and was definitely the best thing about the dish. The mussels, clams and salmon all seemed fresh, but the shrimp were cooked to the point of being hard and crumbly - completely inedible. The pasta was cooked just short of being al dente, but I'll take undercooked rather than overcooked any day.\n\nI doubt I'll ever go here again. I mean really, how lazy do you have to be to totally screw up an antipasto plate? I think two stars is pretty generous. Save this place for the tourists.", "author": "Thomas S."}

Our flight into SFO was delayed by two hours (due to fog, go figure!) so by the time we made it to our hotel we were famished! We stayed at the Best Western Tuscan Inn and Cafe Pescatore is located on the corner of the hotel. We were too hungry to Yelp it first so we decided to take a risk and try it. He ordered the chicken parm and I had the crab ravioli. My ravioli were ok, nothing to rave about as I thought they could use a bit more salt. The b/f wasn't crazy about his chicken parm either. We decided to skip dessert and opted for some Ben and Jerry's that we found while walking along the piers.\n\nBecause we were staying at the Tuscan Inn, we were eligible for the Happy Hour specials. Come to think of it, this might be open to everyone. I'm honestly not sure. Anyway, our hotel offered a free wine tasting which we decided to take advantage of one night. After having our free glass of wine, we decided to do Happy Hour at Cafe Pescatore. We paired our ice cold (exactly how they should be!) Blue Moons with some crab cakes. These were way better than the bland food we had for lunch during the beginning of our stay. And we kept getting free focaccia bread which was an added plus in my book. My second visit to Cafe Pescatore was definitely better than my first although I did notice the bar tender somehow forgot to charge us happy hour rates as some yelpers had mentioned.

However, we left extremely satisfied! We had a Calaramari salad, several pasta dishes and a four-cheese pizza. It was all really good! It was a bit pricey but what isn't in this town? Very pleasant and professional service added up to a definite solid find. I would easliy go there again and again..and probably will!", "author": "Glen D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-07-27", "description": "This restaurant was surprisingly not too bad for a hotel restaurant, especially one at a Best Western! Our flight was late coming in from Oakland, and we didn't want to venture too far the first night. We decided on Pescatore. My mom and I shared a pizza with truffle oil, mushrooms and pancetta. I loved how the restaurant had a wood-burning pizza oven! It made for a tasty pizza. The truffle oil was a nice touch too. We also had breakfast here a couple mornings, nothing special, but nothing horrible either. Prices were reasonable for a hotel restaurant.", "author": "Amy C."}

The chocolate tort was by far the best, with the table focaccia coming in second.  \n\nWe had the bruschetta, \"pasta special,\" and the aforementioned tort.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and service was prompt but overall the food was just much too bland.  For the price, there are much better meals to be had nearby.", "author": "Tony C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-01-04", "description": "There is nothing special about this place, save for the spotlessly clean white tablecloths. It reminds me of the places in Amsterdam along the tourist paths where aproned sleazebags lure you in with pomp and gloss and the promise of an 'authentic' Italian meal. Well, it's not that bad, but it's not that good, either. I will say that the service is polite and attentive. Go with someone who is paying, if you go at all.", "author": "Jabe N."}

It is away from the Italian restaurants in North Beach, but this is a real find. The place was packed with people and the decor is warm and inviting. The service was very good. Try the fish special on the menu and the Polenta, because it was outstanding. I would definitely recommend it as a place worth visiting", "author": "Belinda w."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-11", "description": "We went with a group of ten and the service was relaxed but there when you wanted it. I have to admit I wasn't crazy about my crab ravioli - it was cold and the pasta undercooked (I do like al dente) and the sauce was way too strong with basil, which I usually like but this was overpowering. BUT the other people at the table loved the caesar salad, lamb, chicken marsala & prawn dishes. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing - there were also a couple of pizzas that looked good. We were happy that they let us linger with out of town friends who were staying at a nearby hotel. We were never rushed and enjoyed the atmosphere. The bathrooms are far - through the lobby and down the hall by the conference rooms, but space is certainly at a premium in SF. I will try it once again, but not the ravioli.", "author": "Theresa C."}

The only reason we ate here was because it was right in our hotel, wrong move!\n\nThe breakfast menu was unimpressive, it didn't even have French toast which is what my son wanted so he settled on pancakes which was okay, nothing special.  If you don't mind having a standard every day breakfast then this might be okay for you.  For me and my family, we enjoy when restaurants offer some sort of special menu item,  it was dissappointing.  \n\nThe service could have been better, we had to signal the waiter a couple of times for coffee refills.  \n\nNothing special.", "author": "Sunny D."}

At first, our options seemed limited to Buena Vista Cafe and Hooters, but then we happened upon Pescatore Cafe. The place was relatively busy, mostly with elderly tourists, so we were seated promptly at a nice booth. I went with the French Toast, which I'd recommend and my friend went with a sausage and mushroom omelette, yum! Our server and the manager were very nice, very attentive, perhaps because we were the only people who seemed close to their ages! A surprise post-breakfast experience is getting some free coffee at the adjoining Best Western. You can sit in the lobby, or by the fireplace, watch bedazzled and frumpy tourists ask about how to get to the Wax Museum or H&M, or you can bother the concierge yourself, asking him some inane questions only people who call our city \"San Fran\" or \"Frisco\" would ask. Good stuff.", "author": "Nish N."}

The staff was super friendly and the bartender became a sort of friend to my boyfriend who ended up visiting the bar every nught we stayed there. The cook made my steak rare on accident instead of well done and to make up for it sent out a complimentray dessert. When I say this dessert was fantastic, I mean it was FANTATSIC. It was some kind of Italian custard with a berry wine glaze and fresh berries. OMG! It was so good! And really sweet of the cook. The creamed spinach and mashed potatoes that came with my steak were really delicious, too. My boyfriend and his dad got the dungeness crab ravioli...so good!", "author": "Tina L."}

Both were extremely bland and so overpriced for what we got.  We also ordered a pair of Bloody Mary's.  The Bloody Mary's were sort of like a V8 with some tabasco.  After having Bloody Mary's at Cioppino's it was a definite step down.  I am still unsure if any alcohol actually entered the glasses.  On the plus side, it was open late, and the espresso was good.  Other than that, we would have been better at spending our $80!!! somewhere else.", "author": "A G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-11-17", "description": "Went there with my parents to visit my brother, and since it was a bit away from the Fisherman's Wharf and below our hotel, we stepped in.  Place is nice and clean, decor decent.  I'll have to give credit to our waitress as she tried to give us good service, but our food came in late and service in general was suffering but it was not her fault - they were understaffed due to sick personnel (they stayed home, of course).  With that aside, my parents and brother enjoyed their pasta dishes as they thought it was tasty.  Mine, on the other hand, was not - it was a nightmare.  Since I didn't want any \"corrections\" or whatever as they had staffing issues, I ate it any ways - my dish was not tasty, in fact, it seemed if it was made tasteless, was missing the chicken in it, totally not what I like and what a good risotto dish should be.  Totally a bad culinary experience in my book.  Though I did make mention of my bad meal to the waitress and she seemed a bit upset by it (hey, I am not going to lie about a bad meal), but I did tip her well despite all that's happened.  I'll give this place one more try before putting it in my ban list.", "author": "Y.D. K."}
