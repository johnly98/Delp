The decor is minimalist, and spacing is cozy but comfortable. Try the Okonomiyaki here, which is a unique option.\n\nI came here for a Saturday night dinner with three other friends. Saturday evening in Japantown is incredibly crowded, and so our first two choices for food were both packed. We walked around the plaza and found this location after 3 or 4 other options were all full. We were hungry by then and really looking forward to eating, so would've been satisfied with many spots.\n\nInterior seating is quite limited. Their kitchen \"juts out\" into the main table area. There is not enough seating for large parties. If you have 8 or more people in your party, this restaurant may not be for you.\n\nThe food quality here is average (but above average when you're hungry). The sushi and teriyaki is on par where everywhere else in Japantown. This restaurant was my first experience with Okonomiyaki, which reminded me of Korean pancakes. A very rich flavor. 4/5.", "author": "Chris W."}

There is many Japanese restaurants to choose from there, including sushi spots, ramen spots, hibachi, and restaurants that serve a variety of Japanese food, like Mifune Don.\n\nWhat drew my boyfriend and I to Mifune Don was their rice bowls. I was very eager to try  their unagi rice bowl. Stepping inside, the restaurant itself is very small. There was also just a single waitress. They were not busy, so we were seated quickly. We ordered croquettes, gyoza, and rice bowls. The waitress frequently refilled our glasses of water, and our food also came out fairly quickly. \n\nThe gyoza was cooked really well--steamed and seared, although they were small in size. The croquettes were very good; they were not overdone, but I was expecting them to have meat or vegetables in it. As for my unagi bowl, the fish melted in my mouth easily. The rice was fine, but there was so much pickled ginger. I'm not the biggest fan of pickled vegetables, but will eat them in small quantities. However, my rice bowl had more than I would have liked. That aside, I still enjoyed everything we ordered. I'd be interested in eating here again to try their udon.", "author": "Natalie V."}

And that's pretty much all I've been having for the most part. \n\nDon's Special Modern Yaki -- http://bit.ly/2l9H2HF\nw/ pork, seafood, vegetables, and soba noodles. \nModern Yaki is always a favorite of mine and they do a great job at Mifune Don.  Don's Special is just a hodge podge of good stuff.  Seafood, meat, veggies, and noodles all mixed in a pancake batter.  It sounds and looks bizarre, but the taste is just wondrous!\n\nTanin Donburi (beef & egg rice bowl) -- http://bit.ly/2l7DW73\nThis always hits the spot!  I usually refer to this as the Japanese equivalent to steak and eggs all over rice.  Lots of tender marinated beef mixed with eggs and onions.  Very filling and comforting!\n\nOn occasion I do order other things like their Mixed Tempura, Oyako Donburi, or even their Beef Bowl (Gyu-Donburi).  All are have been just as good.  I do hope to try other things someday like their shabu shabu or curry, but I'll always be satisfied with their Tanin Donburi and Modern Yaki.\n\nI think what I like best about Mifune Don is that it's been a very convenient restaurant for me in that I can always depend on getting seated right away and served food quickly.  It wouldn't say it's the best restaurant that Japantown has to offer, but their food and service have always been consistent and I always end up a full and happy customer.", "author": "Rodney H."}

I've been once before a couple years ago, but I had the chance to revisit recently and found myself really enjoying the food again.\n\nI came with a group of 3 other friends on a Friday around 6:30 was able to get seated immediately. The restaurant was never quite full the entire time we were there, so I appreciate that I can get good Japanese fare without a wait.\n\nI was craving okonomiyaki, which is typically described as a Japanese pancake or pizza, so that's what I went with. Surprisingly there aren't a whole lot of places in San Francisco that serve okonomiyaki; it's either this place or a pop up at Izakaya Rintaro and that's about it. They also have a good selection of appetizers, noodles (udon, soba, yakisoba, and ramen), nabe, rice bowls or donburi, curry, and standard fare like chicken teriyaki.\n\nThey had a couple options for the okonomiyaki, some with soba which I thought sounded very interesting. I wanted something more traditional though, so I went with the seafood okonomiyaki ($14.80), which comes with scallops, shrimp, squid, and vegetables.\n\nThe okonomiyaki is served in what looks like a cast iron pan with a generous amount of okonomiyaki sauce, kewpie mayo, dried seaweed, and dried fish flakes sprinkled on top. I'm used to the mayo being drizzled on top in a lattice like structure, but the spiral design they used here was pretty too. Taste-wise, I thought the okonomiyaki was pretty solid. I've had it runny (i.e. undercooked) before, so I really appreciated how nice and firm it was here. There was a good amount of seafood mixed in as well, and it was all very easy to eat with a fork and knife.\n\nI'd love to come back again and try one of their okonomiyaki dishes that uses soba!", "author": "Dianna H."}

Honestly I don't see the problem with bringing a small snack as long as we were going to order their food also.

Because his favorite Japanese curry spot was closed, we needed to find a different place. We decided on Mifune Don. We figured that it was in Japantown and this place also served soba, which I was desperately craving. \n\nWe ordered:\n1. Cold soba noodles\n2. 2 katsu rice curries\n\nOur order seemed simple enough, but there is so much backstory to it. The day we came, there was some sort of cosplay event that had just wrapped up. Most of the restaurants had lines of people waiting to get it. Mifune didn't, so we were like \"Yes, score!\". Le bf originally wanted chicken katsu curry. When our nice server came to take our order, we learned that they had just sold their last portion of curry (to a girl that was sitting right next to us). She said that she would go check to see if they had anymore. She came back a few minutes later saying that they for sure didn't have anymore but somebody was going out to get more, but wasn't sure if they would be successful. We thought that was a bit weird. 5 minutes later she said that she would take our order and let us know if we would get curry. (Believe me, we were super confused at this point, lots of eyebrow raises and everything. I swear I'm telling the story exactly as how it happened). So we ordered the soba, I ordered my katsu rice with katsu on the side (I don't like my meat pre-smothered in curry), and le bf ordered his chicken katsu curry. We were then informed that he couldn't order chicken katsu curry because they didn't have any chicken left. He could only order pork katsu, shrimp, or potato croquette. He ended up picking the pork katsu.\n\nThe food tasted pretty good. Soba is very hard to mess up. I thought the dipping sauce was a bit salty, they could have diluted it more. The curry didn't actually come out hot, which was confusing because it seemed like they just made it. The rice and the fried katsu was, but the actual curry sauce wasn't. Hmmm......weird.\n\nOverall, we know that it wasn't our server's fault that it seemed like the kitchen ran out of everything we wanted to order. Glad we both got to satisfy our Japanese curry craving. Would we come back? I don't really know. I can't say that I recommend this place, just because it was only around 6:30pm and they had ran out of multiple things. I guess the only positive thing was that the food was alright and we didn't have to wait to be seated. \n\nBe careful when you walk in, the floors were coated with something and it made walking slippery and dangerous.

Some people may not like that, but for me it was a cute little surprise! Also, when the tray was set in front of me, I also saw a bowl of miso soup! I don't remember if it came with the order, and sometimes some Japanese restaurants do that, but miso soup always functions as a good way to ready your tastebuds.\nThen... Came the Katsudon.

Okonomiyaki (actually Modenyaki version) now is a faint shadow of what they used to make. My honey's only reason to come here, is now very disappointing. Don't know what went wrong, maybe they changed the cook from Jose to Mario (just take a peek into the kitchen and this statement will make sense, and that is not racist, it is reality).\n\nCould it be that Mifune is on a cost cutting plan, to reduce the ingredients (none carry a big price tag) or it could be that no one is paying attention. \n\nWhat ever the reason, Mufune's Okonomiki is now a substandard disappointing example.

Perhaps the tourists passing through like them well enough, nothing I've tried has been very good.  Generic, overpriced food?  Pass.\n\nIf there were a Mifune I could have gotten on board with, it would have been Mifune Don.  Compared to the original Mifune, the menu here is a bit more interesting, with okonomiyaki, sukiyaki, and AYCE shabu offered on top of the usual suspects (ramen, udon, donbouri, and sushi rolls).  However, not wanting to pay regular prices for anything, my friend and I decided to check out their lunch specials after doing some shopping at Nijiya.\n\nOffered daily (I think), Mifune Don's lunch deals are pretty decent for the money - one of four different udon/ramen/soba dishes and a choice of eight different \"sides\" ($12.85 or $13.95, depending on your side).  For myself, I opted to go with the ZARU SOBA and NIKU DON ($12.85).  The presentation was nice, and the portions were fair, but neither stood out in any particular way.  The taste of the Zaru Soba was fine, though the noodles were a little gummy.  As for the Niku Don, it was similarly underwhelming; while the flavor was okay, it could have been stronger.  Plus, the beef was a little tough.\n\nEven though I really don't think any Mifune restaurant is worthwhile, Mifune Don might be the best bet, if only because the others I've tried seem worse.  Plus, at least this one can offer table top cooking options (though there are better alternatives nearby).  Otherwise, there are too many other options to explore.  Especially if you're a tourist...\n\nTWO AND A HALF STARS rounded down.", "author": "Mike L."}

And it was so good that I had to come back for another round even though I had very limited time to eat at all my favorite places. \n\nThe service here is really great, especially for a hole in the wall restaurant. They immediately bring you out hot tea and cool water and they're very willing to help you with the menu. I also slightly altered what I ordered both times and they were totally cool with that both times.\n\nThe first time I went my friends and I sat for a relatively long period of time and we were never hassled by the servers. Both of them had ramen (one seafood, the other pork I believe). I tried both and the broth was phenomenal! (That's actually what I had to come back for the second time). It was the most flavorful, power punching, delicious ramen broth I've ever had. Also, none of us got MSG headaches or other side effects after eating there so I think they might actually be making that stuff without it! Which is mind-blowing if you think about it and what's normally served at these kinds of places. \n\nSo the first time I went I got the okonomiyaki and it was fabulous! I asked for no mayo (cause I hate the stuff) and it came out right the first time. It was hot and tasty and I loved how the bonito flakes on the top almost seemed to 'dance' because of the heat. It was so tasty I had to  fight my friend off of my meal with the tiny spatula they give you.\n\nThe second time I went I got their special ramen (shrimp and pork I believe) and it was also amazingly tasty. The bowls and portions are huge and they do not skimp on the meat. I had three or four huge slabs of pork and at least six large shrimp in that bowl. The shrimp were perfectly cooked too which is amazing since they were sitting in hot broth. They must really know how to time their cooking!\n\nI think part of the reason why I like this place is because it doesn't pretend to be anything it's not. It serves good food, where the focus is the food and not anything else. The presentations might not always look gorgeous like they might in other restaurants, but the flavor is there.

Nope. But are you going to have any major complaints? Nope. \n\nWe got the Niku Soba lunch special with Ikura don(this is the best value BTW as the zaru soba and ramen are cheaper standalone) and the Beef Nabe. \n\nSoba was decent texture, enough so you feel something (the worst soba is when it falls apart in you mouth). Soup was a bit salty and the beef was pretty overcooked, but that's what you should come for: no surprises. This is average in a good way. \n\nIkura don was pretty bare bones, wasn't the freshest Ikura ever, but for a non-sushi joint I'm not expecting much. \n\nBeef nabe came out properly done in a metal pot, they have electric hot plates built into the indoor tables to heat it up. Soup had minimal flavor, but for real Japanese style nabe/shabu that's how it should be. The konjac noodles were good but I wish they had a dipping sauce besides ponzu. Oh well. \n\nOverall this is pretty standard Japanese fare. I'm probably not coming bake regularly because it's a bit pricey for what it is.

We can get shabu and my brother can get his ramen.\n\nThe waitress was quick to ruin our good mood. She informed us that everyone in the party must be eating shabu for all you can eat. What...?\n\nI told her that he wanted ramen and we still had the minimum of (2) people to eat.\n\nShe was very adamant on us not eating shabu.\n\nWe went back and forth for a couple minutes and then I said ok, we don't know him, well put him on a separate check and then slid our table 2inches away from him.

We're not allowed to eat shabu?\"\n\n\"Yes\"\n\n\"So if my cousin and I came here by ourselves...

All their 4 seat-tables have a built-in heat source in the middle of the table for Okonomiyaki ($8.20) and hot pot dishes like nira pork moyashi ($8.00).  Sadly, okonomiyaki is cooked in the kitchen and brought out as a finished product on an iron skillet.  Heat source is there only to keep the skillet warm while you eat.  Seafood Okonomiyaki was pretty good, although I wasn't a big fan of the sauce they used.  I like the sauce to be a bit sweeter, but that is matter of preference.  Their Okonomiyaki selection is pretty good with Modern-Yaki (includes yakisoba noodles) as one of the options.\n\nRAMEN:  I was bit confused by their ramen.  Their soup and toppings is more like a champon (cream colored broth with lots of seafood and hakusai vegetables), but their noodle (men) was regular ramen style (not thick and straight like regular champon).  It wasn't terrible, but this confusing blend wasn't a good match.  Overall, it was o.k., but not great.   \n\nOther than Okonomiyaki, I was not impressed with rest of their food.  Their oyako-don was average to poor.  Their lunch special of $9.80 for a choice of noodle and another item (see picture) is a pretty good deal.

The croquettes are pretty much a no fail, you can't go wrong with deep fried mashed potatoes. The oyako-don, which is chicken, eggs, onions, and a special sauce over rice, is also super yummy! However, I was really sad to see that this lunch special pairing is now gone :( They still have a lunch special but it's a dollar more and you can't pair your udon with either of these. However, you can still order croquettes and oyako-don, it's on their menu, but it's not a part of the lunch special anymore.

You can be alone eating this as a snack and be happy. You can also enjoy it right after having a long hard search of what to eat at the end of the day. I prefer to get this tasty meal with a beer. Now, okonomiyaki as seen on youtube:\n\n http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3S73BmUFUk&NR=1&feature=endscreen\n\nThis is how osaka prepares as to where kansai type or more localized does the already mixed type. The batter is supposedly made with a special taro / sticky root paste to give the batter its texture. Normally teppan usually prepare it in front of you so you also get to talk to him/her while your food is being prepared. From what alot of them do they usually do alot with shellfish, oysters, shrimps and squid. Normally its always topped with that japanese style bacon they add a bit of batter then they flip it. After a while they prepare an egg and soba to put on top.then top it with okonomiyaki sauce and kewpie mayo, nori flake and agedama. \n\nSo... I kinda wanted mine prepared similar to the one that I seen on youtube.. but theirs looks alot bigger than the one that I have. it makes mine look like a normal pancake or loosely similar to paejun from a korean restaurant minus all the added stuff like sauces, egg and soba. Tbh, I would have made a great teppan for this type of stuff. \n\nOrder time took no less than 20 mins but I was there for over an hour by myself doing other.Waitress was fast and poured me tea about 3 times :O The place is nice but a bit small. its not bad really and its in the Kintetsu part of the mall if you go to Japantown (the same side that they have the bargain store/market). The waitress was nice and at least better than the one that   sat me  over in Genki Ramen. Now as for the dish itself.... it did taste a bit better than the one that I had over in Genki since it had the yakisoba and the egg topped with it this time. It was a mix of kansai / osaka but more visually pleasing. To be honest I would come back here again if I am not so decisive about making dinner decisions. Then again... I always am D: \n\nGood to eat bit by bit with a chug of your beer!!  \n\nIts too bad that they don't stay out longer than the posted time otherwise it would be a great late night spot to have a beer and snack. I recommend this to anybody that is a paejun or okonomiyaki eater or haven't tried it with a topped egg or yakisoba. having it with yakisoba and egg is a MUST-HAVE another thing that I would have is had kimchi with it... its as spicy as it gets when you add korean condiments to japanese dishes. :3\n\nHave a great eat guys and good hunting!!", "author": "Xeirhen V."}

I ordered the nabeyaki-udon which is a favorite of mine to order to test out a noodle restaurant. Broth was overly strong and the ingredients cooked too long in the nabe which made the udon noodles BROWN and mushy. The tempura shrimp (actually panko coated) was cooked in old oil, or was frozen and flash fried - I couldn't tell except that it wasn't fresh. The kamaboko was sliced too thinly for such a hearty dish - you could almost see through it, and because of the strong broth, took on the flavor of the broth and so the essence of the kamaboko was lost.

I've been terribly disappointed by the few places I've been able to find in the Bay Area, with the exception of Izumi-Ya in SF Japantown; but they happened to be closed when I was in the city yesterday. So at the recommendation of a bunch of Yelpers, I tried Mifune Don. To be honest, I hadn't expected to like the food as much as I did, since I'd read Mifune Don specialized in Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki. But I ordered the mix yaki, and it was terrific - outside of Japan, it's the best I've had with the exception of Izumi-Ya and Okonomiyaki Chibo in Honolulu (which is amazing, if you ever have the opportunity).\n\nThe only reason this is a four-star review is that the service was truly atrocious. There was only one server for maybe 9 tables, and it was lunch time, so I was inclined to give her a break. But I had to ask for EVERYTHING - a menu, chopsticks, a napkin, the check - and usually more than once. I figured things would get better once the place cleared out, but they didn't, so I'm thinking it wasn't just a case of somebody overwhelmed by the lunch rush as much as it was somebody who just doesn't know how to wait on table. I'd thought about even giving them fewer than 4 stars based on the service, but the food is too good; I'm definitely going back to try the modern yaki. \n\nIzumi-Ya will remain my go-to place in J-town - I actually used to teach English in Izumi City, and I have a hunch the folks who run Izumi-Ya come from the same town, which is why I like their food so much. But Mifune-Don is a close contender. My only quibble with the mix yaki was that the pork was a bit tough and lacked flavor; usually when okonomiyaki's made with pork, it's pork belly or bacon, and I specifically chose the mix yaki as opposed to seafood-only because I thought the buta-niku would add some flava. Not so. \n\nOne other thing to know: there are at least 3 places in the Japantown complex named Mifune, including this place, a bigger place in the Kintetsu building and a cafe on Post St. This place is on the second floor of the Miyako building, between the Peace Plaza and the Hotel Kabuki.

I am surprised that it's not even 4 stars! =( So, I feel somewhat obligated to write a review. \n\nI've been coming to Mifune with my family for YEARS now and I love it here. Granted you usually have to wait, and service is not the quickest, nor the best, I still come back over and over again for their food. I always come only for the lunch special because it's a great value ( I apologize I can't give the exact number since I haven't gone for over half a year due to the distance). With the lunch special you basically get 2 items of choice. I usually go for the cold soba and tekka rice bowl, or beef udon with tekka rice. My sister on the other hand like the udon and sushi plate (nigiris - authentic sushi). Their portions are really decent for the price you pay and the flavor is great. I love the presentation of the cold soba and their soba dipping sauce just doesn't taste the same as the ones that you buy in grocery stores. The udon broth on its own deserves 4 stars in my opinion. It's not too salty but sooooo flavorful. If I don't get the udon, I make sure someone else at the table is so I can steal a few spoon full of soup from them. =) \n\nThis is not your commercialized Japanese food restraunt. I mean, we're in Japantown. You get more authentic Japanese food, not overly salty soups, overly decorated sushis etc.  Don't get me wrong, I love commercialized Japansese food as well with all the fancy rolls and stuff, but you just have to appreciate this place for what it is and the flavors of the food for how it is made, simple yet delicious. \n\nPersonally, I really enjoy coming to Mifune and feel like their restaurant is worth at least 4 stars. I'm making a special trip out to the city (not that its THAT far... but I always need an excuse to go) again sometime soon, so Mifune, here I come!", "author": "Louisa T."}

I dislike being so blunt but I went here earlier today and I have never been here but I saw the reviews on here and thought Ill try it looks good! I ordered the chicken karage off the appetizer menu and I got a curry bowl the croquette curry bowl to be exact. Ive never had a curry bowl at a japanese restaurant  before so my firsy question to the waitress was if it is spicy? She said not not at all. So I went ahead and ordered expecting not spicy which I thought ok this should be interesting. I got the curry bowl and it was so spicy I was sweating throughout my meal and I am not a fan of spicy food but I ordered it so stuck it out. I found eating it very unpleasant and the curry was a little goopy too. In regards to the chicken karage. I have had chicken karage before several times and felt like I was eating imitation chicken it was very stringy and the batter it was fried in did not taste good. Im sure other people love this place but after being lied to by staff over a simple question that can make the difference to an individual who does not know the dish in question and has a sensitive stomach this is a big deal. In addition to this I was asked if I needed a glass of ice water while I was fanning myself from how spicy the curry bowl was. I did not finish either food plates and do not plan on coming back. I had a really bad case of awful indegestion. However despite all of this if you plan on coming here do your research beforehand please.", "author": "Diana B."}

He was telling me how great the Okonomiyaki was until I blurted out 'wth is okonomiyaki?' We ended up coming here for okonomiyaki. When looking at the pictures, I thought it was an omelet with sauce on top. I had no idea what I was getting my stomach into lol\n\nI ain't complaining though, this was my first time having Okonomiyaki. I never knew this place existed til my friend introduced me to it during the Nihonmachi weekend. \n\nI had the seafood okonomiyaki which was served in a hot iron skillet and was topped with japanese mayo, teriyaki sauce and flakey tofu skins. Whata pretty presentation! And, it smelled delicious! This entree came with a pretty looking dish and a silver spatula. I didn't know I was supposed to use the spatula to eat with until I read Nobu's entry below xD \n\nI used chopsticks to feed myself. My bill came out to about $20 since I ordered tuna sashimi as well. The bill was actually $16 + tip = 20. My stomach was really satisfied and the staff were refilled my tea constantly which made me really happy. \n\nOverall, great place to go to for lunch and dinner, but not with a huge group. A large group for them would be like 4 people. There are a few booths and two medium sized tables. Also, this is a hole in the wall type joint. Great food doesn't have to be served in the biggest food joints.", "author": "Jason C. J."}

I loved the tempura it came with but the cold noodles has NO flavor at all. The noodles came with sauce but no matter how much I dipped the noodles in it, or how much I poured over my noodles, it was still tasteless. I wouldn't recommend it. \nOverall: okay\n\nSecond visit: \nCustomer service: Bad. When we first walked in we were ignored and stood at the door for a good 1-2min before anyone even said a word to us. When looking for a tea refill, we places our empty cups near the edge of the table and it wasn't until we stopped a waiter did we have it refilled. We tried stopping one multiple times before but they always rished right passed us. When leaving, the waiter just stared at us and the amount of tip we left. I admit, we left below 10% tip (Not my fault, my friends were all too broke/cheap to pay their fair share of the tip. I paid my part) however we shouldn't be looked at weird because of that. If you want a better tip, should have gave us better service and I would have been willing to pay more than my share of the tip.\nFood: Since I ordered something different this time, I was sastified with my food.

We had ordered a beef and egg okonomiyaki and a seafood okonomiyaki. They came out looking like the ones they serve in Japan. We've also had okonomiyaki at Kitchen Kura and Halu, but the ones here were slightly larger and they tasted a little better. The ingredients and dough are distributed evenly so the texture is just right for a delicious okonomiyaki.\n\nWe came for dinner again today. My gf ordered the mixed okonomiyaki (squid, pork, shrimp, veggies) and the ebi tempura roll and I ordered the tannin don (beef and egg). The roll tasted a little off as soon as we put it in our mouths. It may have had something to do with the fact that the rice was warm. We like our sushi made with cooler or at least room temperature rice. Plus, it tasted bland. Soy sauce did not help the flavor either. I wished we had not ordered this -- it was not worth the $6.80 for 6 bland pieces. The miso soup that came with the donburi was meh. I took two sips and that was it. The mixed okonomiyaki was not as good as the beef and egg or seafood ones we had last time. Maybe, it was a mistake to have chosen something different. My gf felt like there was way too much pork compared to everything else. \n\nUnlike a few other reviewers, we had no problems with the service either time --the other time we had an older lady. This time, it was a younger waitress and she was also polite and observant. My gf was a little bummed that not all the cooks in the kitchen were Japanese, thus rendering the food not  as \"authentic,\" but we will still definitely come back for the okonomiyaki.", "author": "robin b."}

The restaurant was PACKED, and I suppose the kitchen backed up. We ordered and was immediately greeted with green tea and water.

I politely waited as I assumed my partner's order was close behind. \n\nNOT SO \n\nI didn't time it, or look at my watch, but I'll assume about half an hour later (by now the restaurant was nearly empty and the \"closed\" sign on the door, her meal arrived.

I assumed it was the kitchen's fault. \n\nThe lead waitress came to apologize. near the end of our meal and a kitchen person came and also apologized. Here, I told him that I thought it was prudent to hold back the one immediately available dish until (approximately) both orders were ready so to not make the customers uncomfortable. English (or Japanese) was not his first language and I think the logic was lost on him. \n\nMy partner was a waitress in an upscale restaurant in Marin for 20 years and she assured me that for a professional staff (wait and prep) there is cooperation and even communication to the customers (especially to larger parties) what they should expect as to serving timing. \n\nI do not hold any grievance against any of the staff since I am certain this is a one-off experience.

I thought the pancake was perfectly cooked, crispy on the outside, and soft and moist on the inside.  It was topped with okonomiyaki sauce, mayonnaise, and bonito flakes, which added a nice savory flavor.  One of these is probably enough to feed two people, if you're also drinking and order a side dish.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the mix yakisoba, which was good, because it was not greasy, not too salty, and had chewy noodles (the most important factor for me).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-30", "description": "After a long day of shopping, my boyfriend and I were looking for something low-key for dinner. He wanted to go to a place in Japantown, so we decided to give this place a try. The Yelp reviews are spot on--the noodles at this place are its specialty! The menu is not too expansive, but it definitely focuses on its noodle items over appetizers, rolls, and nigiri. I would come back to place again in Japantown if I'm looking for a quick fix of Japanese food at a decent price (total was roughly $36 not including tip).\n\nZaru Soba: \nMy boyfriend had the zaru soba (cold soba noodles topped with seaweed flakes that you dip in a cold sauce), which was $6.80--a great price for a dinner item! I typically prefer hot udon noodles over cold soba, but these soba noodles were delicious (in terms of texture). Although bland-tasting without the sauce provided, the noodles were very bouncy and chewy. \n\nDeluxe Nabe:\nEven though I love nabeyaki udon (chicken, tempura shrimp, egg, mushrooms, veggies, and udon in a broth), I opted to step it up and go for a deluxe nabe (same as nabeyaki udon but also includes scallops). It was $14.80--seemingly pricey, but you get an ENORMOUS metal pot of food (bigger than my face!). Something special this place has that my boyfriend pointed out was the type of seaweed this place uses in their hot noodle dishes--the seaweed is not your typical flavorless seaweed. It's got a hint of sweetness that resonates in your mouth as you eat the noodles and sip the hot broth. It's a wonderful touch that he and I don't taste often when we go to Japanese restaurants.\n\nNigiri:\nMy boyfriend originally was not in the mood for sushi, but since the price was right, he also ordered some nigiri for us to munch on. He ordered a salmon nigiri, hamachi nigiri, and ikura. The salmon and hamachi nigiri were $3.80 and the ikura was $4.80. I wouldn't say they're the best quality nigiri, but they were average. I didn't eat the ikura, but I'd rank the hamachi nigiri as better tasting than their salmon nigiri. I'm sure this can vary depending on the fish shipped in that day, but I'll bet the salmon typically shipped here won't be very fatty and thus not as succulent as it could be.\n\nAtmosphere & Service:\nThis is probably the main reason I would only rank this place 3.5 stars instead of 4. We arrived at this place around 7:30 pm, and not surprisingly, this place was packed. Nevertheless, we got a booth immediately. The table and seats looked like they hadn't been wiped (some leftover splashes here and there on the table, some oily marks and crumbs on the seat), but I'm glad the waiter did not take offense when I asked for extra napkins to wipe the booth down a bit. (I've been to other fancier/pricey restaurants where the hostess/waiter would give me the stink eye because I want to their uncleaned tables & seats.) He simply handed me a bulk of napkins and apologized for the mess. Our waiter and other waiters were very prompt with refilling drinks and serving, so I was very pleased to never have to ask for a refill or wait a long period of time for food (the food arrived within 5 minutes or less).", "author": "Stephanie C."}

I always pass by this place probably gazillion times whenever I am at Japantown, it's right next to Seoul Garden Korean restaurant. \n\nMy eyes were appealed by the window display with full of plastic food models, haha. Made me wonder if it's real. LOL. \nI ordered bunch of kinds of sushi. I say it taste alright, but you can't go wrong with their soup!! \n\nThe only thing I hate about this place was the waiter. I was constantly eating my food enjoyably, she keeps staring at me while I'm at it which made it feel awkward. Have some respect when people are eating their food, please. \n\nOverall, it's pretty affordable and delish.", "author": "Jan P."}

That nether time around 4:00 that is too late for lunch, too early for dinner, yet unfortunately (and correspondingly) accompanied by a ravenous appetite. So - there you have it. The Linner Zone.\n\nI've walked by Mifune Don countless times while ambling around Japantown and thought \"That looks cute\". But for one reason or another, never stopped. That changed on this day since it was open at the odd hour offering a welcoming respite for two ravenous refugees from Linner Zone. Yes! \n\nWith growling stomachs and plummeting blood sugars, my bf and I zipped inside and tucked into one of the few cozy booths. Within 5 minutes we were grubbing down on oh-so-satisfying, unfussy, Japanese comfort foods like wakame udon (with slices of fishcake, seaweed, silky noodles and flavorful broth), excellent potato croquettes (some of the best I've had in SF), generously portioned grilled salmon, veggie & shrimp tempura (non-oily and perfectly breaded) rounded out with rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables and green tea. Aaah. Happy bellies. Plus happy wallets. Linner time sometimes silver linings into Happy Hour pricing. \n\nWe grabbed some sweet red bean treats from a nearby grocery and strolled safely out of Linner right into The Comfort Zone. I recommend following this plan closely should you ever  find yourself in similar dining peril.", "author": "wendella a."}

We waited in the doorway and the waitress didn't seem to notice us until we asked if there was a place to write down our names, to which she replied, \"You can.\" Like ???? So we just stayed instead of shopping around while waiting for a table. When we got seated, I had to raise my hand for a good 2 minutes before anybody came over, and when she did, she didn't take my order, instead she said someone else would take it. Which was fine. So we waited further, and finally a waitress came to take our order. After a solid 45 minutes, the food arrived at last. I can't lie though, the okanomiyaki was shmackin. When we finished eating and paid for the meal, the waitress never came back with our change, so I had to ask for it. Dissatisfied with my experience, I chose to leave a measly tip of 56 cents. Only seconds after leaving the restaurant, the waitress had called us back with an attitude to say, \"Is this all you think I deserve? The tip asks for 15% normally but I'll only ask for 10%\" as if she was being nice or something. Begrudgingly, I handed her two dollars and left feeling bitter.

I'm not sure if this is the sister Restaurant to Mifune on the other side of the building - they do kinda share the same name. Anyway, we were seated pretty quickly - its a small Restaurant, but its clean. They only had one waitress running the place, with two cooks I believe. But we were able to get our food in a timely manner. \n\nThe menu wasn't that impressive - they don't have many sushi rolls or sushi at all. But I wouldn't get sushi here anyway. I think their speciality is noodles cooking in a iron pot at your table! The tables are all equipped to be able to cook noodles. But we ordered the katsu curry rice and the tempura with soba. It was okay - the curry was a little salty - and I've had better before. The soba with tempura was pretty good...but again, its just pretty standard stuff. Looks like the okonomiyaki is the thing to get here - I'll have to try it next time.", "author": "Betty S."}

I am not in the Japantown neighborhood much and since the Japanese supermarket ran out of their pre-packaged sushi pack yum-yums, my boyfriend and I decided to come here.\n\nOur waitress was attentive and the service was quick. We ordered a California Roll, a Katsu-soba, and beef & egg donburi. The California Roll had sweet egg as one of the ingredients, so that was a nice change from the imitation crab and mayo mix served at most places. My meal came with a tiny nibble of a fermented vegetable salad and miso soup. The salad is nothing to write home about but the miso soup tasted very authentic. My beef and egg donburi was tasty, but the sauce was a bit overpowering. However, it was still solid.

Service was quick; my meal was served to me in about 5-10 minutes after I placed my order. \n\nThe \"1/2 portion\" of a couple of the donburi (Unagi and Tekka) were of good value; $5.50 for a still-reasonable portion of rice with either broiled eel or raw tuna served over it. Not bad! Unfortunately the 1/2 portions do not come with a salad, but that was okay with me. Miso soup was good and fresh; however, the cabbage that was served with the donburi and miso soup was rather pitiful looking, and it wasn't even pickled. *shrug* But that was a really small part of the set anyway, so....onward--\n\nThe ambience bothered me though; I can't complain too much since Japantown in general is really unlike Japan (here I go, being a snob about Japan....). Still, even though the booth seats were nice and cute, I felt they were too close for comfort in terms of overhearing neighbors' disturbing conversations about their sexual lives.

This is about when it started to go downhill.\n\nOne of the hostesses was doing, something receipts and when we said \"umm, seating for two?\", she put her hand up and just shrugged us off.  I looked around for another hostess who wasn't so busy and saw one getting food, or wait, just playing with the noodles.  After about a 5 minute wait when there were a large number of tables around, a waiter took us to our table.  First thing I noticed was the noise that 10 grade-school kids could make.  And then I noticed how long the table was,  I couldn't just lean over and whisper something to my honey anymore, I had to speak in normal volume :[\n\nNobody came to give us tea or menus so we sort of waited and just as we were about to leave, a guy came to take our order and realized we never had menus.

We had hoped it would make up for the horrible environment.

The food is definitely good enough - There is nothing  that distinguishes itself from the other establishments in the mall but its got the added bonus of being one of the cheaper places (and of course, not having an income these days - that really attracts me to it).\n\nIts got a cozy environment and the beef curry that I got was good, not spectacular. Somehow, there is something about the processed taste of Japanese curry that really appeals to me... Am I the only one?\n\nThe portions were of a decent size and that's about it. It may have got a higher rating but I couldn't say that the service was great, it took them a long time to come round for our orders and for the bill to get collected.\n\nEven with that in mind, I would go back there again though there is plenty to choose from in Japantown", "author": "Krishnan S."}

We went for dinner and ordered, gyoza, yakitori, okonomiyaki, and soba. The waitress was friendly and was attentive to what we needed. They were flexible in that they fit to my dislike of seafood. The gyoza was nothing really special, it was browned nicely and had good flavor, but there are some Japanese frozen brands that taste the same. The yakitori also was a little dry, and didn't have much sauce. \n\nHowever, the reason we gave them four stars is from the service and the main course. The okonomiyaki was thick and full of vegetables, egg, and beef. It was kept warm on the tabletop grill. It formed a delicious crust on the bottom of it. There was just the right amount of sauce and helped it from not drying out. It was a good meal that kept me satisfied for the night, even through Wicked, given we ate around 5-6 and Wicked ended at 11:30.\nMy friend said that the soba was good, she ate all the noodle, and drank most of the soup base. Even though soba is pretty hard to mess up it was good to know they had the basic stuff!\n\nWe have been going there for a long time and will continue to go for their standard Japanese food you find in America. The prices are good and the portions are satisfying.", "author": "Sumi M."}

The waiter was nice and even showed me how to use chopsticks. I left a 20% tip (the first time I came). A funny experience I had here is the first time Me and my gf came here the same exact waiter could not speak English that well, So we didnt expect her to say \"are you finished with this dude\" aha Me and my gf chuckled because it was a shocker. Overall is was a good experience.", "author": "Brandon s."}

My friend got cold udon noodles and the waitress had put some fish sauce next to his plate. She comes and checks with us 10 minutes later and he hasn't touched the fish sauce. She grabs the bowl of fish sauce, shoves it in his face and said \"Why you no like fish sauce? Try with your noodles\", and continued to pour over his udon. We left, didn't pay for it. Terrible waste of time.", "author": "Alycia M."}

But that okonomiyaki... I have had it 2-3 times at Mifune Don over the past 5 years and it is always stellar.", "author": "Chris D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-06", "description": "This is, in my opinion, the better of the two Mifune's in Japantown.  The only place I know of that has kickass okonomiyaki and yakisoba, as well as regular cold soba noodles.  Oh yeah, their hot soba noodles rock too.  I have almost ate everything on their menu, and have never been disappointed.  The waitress is so nice and always hooks me up when/if she can, especially when it's not busy!  You gotta come here when it's not packed and when it's slow so you get the best service.", "author": "Jim N."}

The food is serviceable, if your hungry and can't wait for one of the other fabulous places in Japantown.  We had a noodle dish and a meat entree...it was so memorable I don't know what the dishes exactly were.  OK service and OK food.", "author": "The F."}

I really like their niku udon which is udon with beef. I think that they should use a little less salt for their dishes, but otherwise everyone should come and eat at Mifune Don.", "author": "Marina C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-19", "description": "ok granted that i probably annoyed the waitress because i changed my order (i know bad, but i couldn't help but get nabeyaki udon) i was planning to get the lunch special (ramen and korokke, oh how i love korokke)\nbut i was feeling a bit cold... and wanted nabeyaki udon... sue me. x.x\ni was supposed to meet my friend and we were planning to go to sapporo ya but she ended up not being able to make it so i went to mifune don instead.\nservice was fairly nice, until more people started coming in that some had to be seated outside... when i was nearly done (i give them credit for not giving me my bill while i was still eating the food portion) but i wanted to drink the rest of the soup =[  it was slightly salty tho but i also kind of burned my tongue because i didn't realize how hot it was... =X\nbut it was pretty good\nfood was pretty good, but my tempura was kind of soaking in the udon. i know they usually put it in there... but that's what i also burned my tongue on in attempts to try eating it before it would become soggy. \nanywho, it had an egg (yay), some vegetables, and two slices of fish cake, and some meat\nfor me, i like that type of udon (i've had udon where they have different types of fish in it... and i know that nabeyaki udon supposedly usually seems to have fish, but i like the one without fish better) x.x\nyes i'm picky =\\ i haven't a clue what authentic is but as long as it tastes good, won't make me sick, is decent and tastes like it's supposed to, i'm, for the most part, good\nso, food was good\nservice was ok... for the most part\nprice was 11$ including tip. it was fairly decent and i kind of expected to spend around that much for lunch in jtown =X then again, japanese food seems to always be expensive... and i always want japanese food...\ni still really want to try okonomiyaki... i would come here again.\n\n[Edit:]\nI had their okonomiyaki, twice. and I really enjoyed it ^.^ I went on Wednesday (take out). and the waitress seemed a bit more cheerful that day and that cheerfulness spread to myself, so I was happy too =3\nanyhow, it was good xD and good, and really good!! i wish had more x.x.... however, i need to ask for without mayo... (i keep forgetting though) (and not because they put too much or anything, but i don't like the taste of mayo... and there's also the fact that  my mother always told me to never eat the mayo when i was younger...... anyhow, i need to remember to ask for it without) =3\nRegardless, their okonomiyaki is extremely delightful (good food = happy me ^.^)", "author": "Christina W."}
