The Italian lady is either warm and friendly or she is a raging lunatic, customer hating fury.\n\nI had an OK experience.  Yes, service was slow and we needed to ask for things, but it was bearable.  The pasta is al dente and the pizza pretty authentic, the food is indeed good, but I have had better in the price range.\n\nThe wine is what I drink at home, so inexpensive and just fine for everyday meals, and the pours are generous.\n\nThe place is not trendy looking and the ambiance is old style Italian American checkered table cloth type of thing. Which is fine, if I want fancy I know where to go.\n\nSo, don't avoid this place because of the one and two star reviews, but I would not cross the sea to eat here.  Would I come back?

Honking cars, limited parking, packed restaurants, long wait times, and slower service due to higher demand. \n\nThis Friday I wanted to be brilliant. Coming after work, the last thing I wanna deal with is a rowdy group of bros screaming and hollering after coming from the bar. No, this night, I purposely found a restaurant off the beaten path, all the while still being in the midst of the lively neighborhood of Hayes Valley. \n\nI moseyed into ll Borgo and even on a Friday night without reservations, I was seated immediately. Lighting was dim with real burning candlelight on each table; brick walls, wooden tables, a rustic type of feel. \n\nI opened the old school looking menu and decided on the classic caprese (how can anyone go wrong here), Pollo E Vegetali Alla Griglia, and Penne with Salciccia. \n\nCaprese salad - This dish came out surprisingly quick, which I love, but the ratio of mozzarella to tomato was a bit off. I tend to prefer 50/50 with both tomato and cheese slices close to identical in size. Though I appreciate this dish flying out to the table so fast, I think the preparation could've been a little more thoughtful. \n\nPollo E Vegetali Alla Griglia - I was pretty disappointed with this. Grilled chicken drizzled with sweet balsamic vinegar, steamed broccoli, roasted potatoes, and saut\u00e9ed endive to top. I like my chicken moist, but this chicken breast was flattened and dry; basically flavorless. The potatoes were cooked really well, slightly crispy on the outside, but they were a bit over salted. The expectedly bitter endive enhanced the bitterness of the grill marks on the chicken, rather than complimenting the supposedly sweet/tangy balsamic. In fact, I couldn't detect any balsamic flavor at all. Broccoli was the best thing on the dish; steamed, unseasoned, and not much room for a mess up. This dish was $17.50. \n\nPenne with Salciccia - The penne was cooked to a perfect al dente and the tomato sauce coated beautifully, but the Salciccia was a bit too salty for my tastebuds. I'm usually very picky with tomato sauces too because it can come off either sour or acidic. This sauce, unfortunately, was not the exception. Grated cheese wasn't even offered to create more of a balance. $14 for this dish. \n\nService was really good though. Warm bread was offered to the table. \n\nFor a Friday night, I think Il Borgo was good enough. I accomplished avoiding the late night crowd. \n\n3.5 Stars", "author": "Ann S."}

If you are looking for good food at a decent pride and don't mind crappy service this is the place. \n\nCame here with a big group today. Service was slow even at 8:30 pm. Took forever to get our servers attention to order wine and she did not advise on portions so after the first round of appetizers came out we had to reorder for a starving group of people. Caprese salad is meant for 4 and we had 7 people. Pizza we were short one slice since it came with only 6. Really??? \n\nDinner was great. Portions were good and quality of the pasta dishes we all ordered you good. In fact 4/7 of us needed a doggie bag so we could eat some dessert. \n\nNow why two stars? Service sucks. No refills or how is everything. No help on what to order or portion sizes. We constantly had to ask for things from chili flakes and Parmesan that should come standard with pizza. Bread only came when we ordered two bottles of wine. \n\nSo when our bill came we divided it by 7 with 18% tip and we forgot to include one person so our bill was a bit short. \n\nI get it we made a mistake but for the server to come and tell us in front of the whole table that we stiffed her was tacky. She could have said, hey the tip doesn't look correct do you mind rechecking instead of embarrassing the person who calculated it in the group. Tacky. No apologies and we left her extra tip in cash no less and then she was all flowers and sunshine trying to be nice. \n\nI don't like service that is crappy and then having the server ask for more tip shamelessly in front of a large group. If we made a mistake there are more graceful ways to ask. Would I come here again? Probably not. Food wasn't that good and the service def killed my appetite. \n\nI only came for a friends going away party and this was not how I expect my friends last meal in US before moving overseas would be.

Dining solo, I cruised by Uva Enotecca--I'm told their Japanese eggplant parmigan is excellent. But, it was slammed, even for a single guy, party of one. So, what other Italian spot is open in the neighborhood? Il Borga! \n\nI was & am bummed the only eggplant dish they serve is Fussili. Also bummed that my table had no candle, because trust me, the candles are cool. More on the candle later...\n\nSo I settled on one of my old faves, Pasta Puttanesca, the \"whore's sauce\". My Sicilian grandma tells the story--after a long night working, a prostitute awakes at 3 in the afternoon, & being hungry, she goes to the \"icebox\" & finds anchovies, tomatoes, basil, garlic, capers & olives. She comes up with a sauce for her spaghetti! I am happy to report the chef ok'd my request to substitute fettuccine, cos it usually comes with penne, & I wasn't in the penne-mood.  To start, I ordered a nice chianti & the salad Casareccia, cold crunchy romaine with Italian dressing & fresh herbs. Although at $6, it's over-priced, but it was perfectly dressed, & the dressing was excellent, the perfect balance of herbs, red wine vinegar & EVOO. It could have used some garbanzos and a couple cherry tomatoes, but it was really good. The waiter brought over fresh ground pepper, some freshly grayed parmesan, &  some warm Italian bread gratis, a nice touch. \n\nMusic in many restaurants can be an afterthought, or worse, too loud & annoying. Il Borgo's charming Italian tunes, not super-loud & with the candles & red checkered tablecloths, it really is classic ambience (think \"Lady & the Tramp\"!) Love it. When it got dark, the waiter brought me a candle. Pretty cool, right? \n\nWhen the pasta came, it was indeed home-made & it was al dente. But sad to say, it had just way tooooo fishy. Too much anchovies, and not very good quality. I did send it back & the guys were cool about it. The owner offered another dish, but since it getting was late, \nI opted for the Antipasto Misto. Hey, ya can't go wrong with prosciutto, heirloom tomatoes, & roasted garlic!\n\nSo, I'm giving Il Borgo 5 stars. Sure the Puttanesca was too fishy, but everyone has an off day.

My group of 4 arrived here around 6:30pm on a Saturday and there was zero space for our group to wait inside. Like you walk in and you're basically hovering over a stranger's dinner table.\n\nI waited with two other groups that were there before me, and none of us were greeted. Nobody knew what was going on or how long the wait would be. A friend in my group had to walk through the restaurant after waiting for 15 minutes to ask the owner directly how long it would be. \n\nThey did give us an appetizer for free which was nice. They tastes like pizza pockets (yum!) and also every table gets free bread and olive oil/vinegar which is also goood.\n\nI got the Lasagenta (lasagnetta?) and it was yummy yum yum! Three large spirals of noodles, cheese, pancetta (i think?), and a delish pinkish sauce. I recommend!\n\nHopefully the service was a one time thing. Oh! the lights also randomly went off.

By the end of the meal, I was sure of the reasons.\n\nThe place has a nice decor and a great location. The food menu is sizeable too. But two things that should be base requirements are missing. First, the service is rude and atrocious. The owner (the tall, heavy built guy) seems the least interested in providing a good service, and frowns at additional requests. For instance, while we categorically told him to separate the meat from the starter, he brought it back just the same. And when we mentioned it to him again, a good restaurant would just replace it; not here. Even the can of coke that was offered upon ordering seemed past its expiry date.\n\nAs for the food, which is the one thing you expect at a restaurant, seemed bland and average at best. Now, this could be a matter of personal taste, but even the tables around us were complaining of the same. My assumption is that to cover up for the inadequacies, they just add multiple layers of cheese on top of any meal.\n\nNot coming back in here again.", "author": "Adi M."}

The interior is quite welcoming and the host was gracious even though we had enough luggage to take up a table for four.  Everything looked delicious, but that's about where it started to go wrong.\n\nShe seemed offended when I declined to order the wine K wanted, and when K wanted a refill, we had to flag the host down, even though the restaurant was quite slow by that point.  The dressing on my caesar was traditional, but was little more than romaine and dressing.  No offer of cheese at this point, or any other.  I ended up wishing I'd ordered K's misti, which seemed to be a lot more substantial.\n\nOur entrees came out relatively quickly -- my carbonara was passable, though somewhat lacking in flavor, while K's gnocchi had a gorgonzola sauce that was too strong for my tastes.  \n\nI had other plans for dessert, and when we tried to pay our check with a credit card, we were informed that cash would be faster.  She didn't wait for me to respond to this (I rarely carry that much cash) and walked away.  A few minutes later, she had the same conversation with another table that insisted on paying with plastic.  She ran their card, and started ranting loudly to the kitchen staff in Italian.  I don't speak Italian, but between K's Spanish and my French, we got the gist of it.  She was LIVID that people don't pay in cash anymore.  \"Everyone only carries plastic, and I have to pay for their laziness\"\n\nI get that you don't like paying credit card fees.  I don't imagine anyone does.  However, those networks aren't free, and someone has to pay for the  infrastructure.  If you don't want it to eat into your profits, raise your prices or don't advertise the ability to take cards when you'd rather not.  I did notice your ATM machine in the corner, which was unplugged.\n\nI realize she probably thought we wouldn't know what she was upset about, but perhaps she should be more careful about ranting about customers within earshot.  Some of us might understand what you're saying, say nothing about it, and then never come back.  It was certainly the only meal I'll ever eat there.", "author": "Derek H."}

Not so much this year!  After seating, the waitress came over to ask about drinks, we also ordered at that time, but she really was  not very cordial and whisked my wife's wine glass off the table rather hastily as if she was annoyed because she didn't order any. She ordered the gnocci and I ordered the lobster ravioli. The food came out quickly and upon serving she asked if we wanted grating cheese. I said definitely and the waitress immediately put on a scorned face and said \" gnocci you put cheese on but in Italy we don't put cheese on seafood\". She took two steps away and stopped and looked at me like there was something wrong with me and then got the cheese. I came here to have a nice relaxing meal and now I found myself irritated that she had such an attitude. Italian/American, from Boston, I don't need her telling me how to eat Italian food!  Even if that was the case, you don't chastise a customer. From he start this woman had an edge.  As I am eating, I am so aggravated about her attitude, when she came to the table to ask how everything was, I told her \"I'm Italian and I didn't think she should tell people how to eat their food\". Now she said she was just telling me how they do it in Italy.  She said she wasn't being critical and I was being intimidating.  My wife tried to explain how her behavior was not appealing. Now she says because I complained about her that I was mental!

It has all the period-appropriate set decoration detail - the checkerboard tablecloths, the melted candles in aged Chianti bottles, the walls painted with Milanese cafe scenes. All they need now is a scruffy mutt and a cocker spaniel sharing a strand of spaghetti in the back alley.\n\nI wasn't even aware that Il Borgo existed until I convinced Jamie W. to bypass our regular Italian standby, Stelline, in favor of another similarly themed ristorante. We liked it for the no-frills choices on the menu. There are quite a few pasta dishes, several pizzas, some veal scallopini options - in other words, what you would expect a family-run neighborhood place to serve. We started with two very typical appetizers. The $7 Caprese was pretty standard - a quartet of Roma tomato slices with only a trio of Mozzarella slices with three basil leaves (see photo). Despite the perceived miscounting, it provided satisfaction.\n\nHowever, in making the inevitable comparison, I have to say it lies completely in the shadow of the much fresher-tasting Caprese at Stelline. What did stand out was the $7 Bruschetta, which was a generous mound of chopped tomatoes marinaded in olive oil and minced garlic, all of it atop a trio of oven-toasted bread slices (see photo). That was a genuinely delicious appetizer and not as wet as you expect since they were easy to pick up. Jamie and I both decided to order pasta dishes. He went with a classic $11.75 plate of Spaghetti Carbonara (see photo).\n\nIt was an abundant portion that seamlessly mixed pieces of pancetta, garlic, Parmigiana-Reggiano cheese and eggs. There was nothing extraordinary about the execution, but it was hearty eating on a chilly Friday evening. Mine was better, the $12.75 Penne E Funghi Salsiccie, which mixed nicely al dente penne with plenty of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and chunks of Italian sausage that provided a nice kick of spice to the dish (see photo). We didn't have enough room in our bellies for any dessert which I am guessing would have included a spumoni and a tiramisu. Predictable? sure. Good eats? Uh-huh.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good, no-frills, no-fuss Italian food that satisfies the belly\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...an old-fashioned vibe that provides a nice contrast to  all the surrounding hipster joints\nSERVICE - 4 stars...definitely a family operation and part of its charm\nTOTAL - 4 stars...not as fresh-tasting as Stelline but a worthy Italiano contender, paisan!", "author": "Ed U."}

But more importantly it had this light brownish gelled or is it jello'd sauce on it - kind of like cold gravy but it wasn't cold.

The waittress didn't apologize or anything, yanked the fork and gave me a new one. We ordered wine. She brought me a glass, and the glass was filthy. It literally had a layer of soap caked onto the wine glass both at the base, stem and actual cup.  It was so thick, that it actually had rough texture that can easily be felt.  I didn't really want to drink from a dirty wine glass. No big deal -- ask for a new one, right?\n\nSo I did, and instead of apologizing, she just mocked me in front of my date. She said \"How do you deal with someone so picky? You must be so patient?\" I couldn't even get a word in. She just kept confidently insulting me. \n\nOn top of that, she didn't even come check to see if our food was good once throughout the meal.

Usually, when I'm coming off the Bay Bridge to go home, my route off Octavia leaves me stuck at a red light at Fell and Laguna.  During those 30 seconds, as I wait for the light to turn green, I would sit and wonder if Il Borgo was any good.  Just as I tell myself that I'm going to finally check them out though, the light changes, I go on my way, and I forget that Il Borgo even exists.  That is, until I'm stuck at that light again.  So when my friend recently suggested we go to Il Borgo for dinner, my immediate thought was \"Where the hell is that?\".\n\nWhen we arrived, it was nice that we were seated immediately, but it kinda sucked that our table was right next to the door.  Since it was such a cold night, there was a bit of a chill whenever someone walked in or out.  Skimming the menu, I was impressed to see they offered a good mix of dishes and at prices that are pretty reasonable compared to other Italian joints in SF.  Since we wanted to share a couple of dishes, we ordered the Funghi e Salsice pizza (mushroom and sausage) and the Spaghetti Carbonara.  \n\nAlthough the portions were pretty good for the price, our food left me conflicted.  The pizza tasted pretty good, and I liked how they didn't skimp on the toppings, but man was it oily.  Sure, there was sausage on it, but wow.  Plus, since the crust was so thin, the slices were kinda limp and soggy with oil.  As for the pasta, I really liked the pancetta (how can you not?), but I thought the sauce fell short.  Maybe this is the was it's supposed to be made, but it reminded me more of an alfredo dish than the spaghetti carbonaras I've had in the past.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, especially since the waitress (the owner?) was the only one taking care of each table.  It's a slight bummer that the place is CASH ONLY, but I think I saw an ATM towards the back (there are probably fees though).  Despite the prices, I'm not sure I would come all the way back, but at least I don't have to sit at that light and wonder what Il Borgo is all about anymore.", "author": "Mike L."}

The Lasagneta with proscuitto was DELIGHTFUL and the Gnocchi with pesto - hoooooly cow. I literally rolled my eyes in pleasure every time I took a bite. Soft, pillowy, cloud-like gnocchi goodness. You can choose other sauces for the gnocchi if you're not into pesto. The Lasagneta is in a sauce similar to a vodka sauce, which come on, is never a bad thing.  \n\nThe bread they give you in the beginning is so soft and served warm, its a great start to the meal. So why only 4 stars? Negative points for cleanliness. Coulda been the people who sat at the table before us, not sure. \n\nThe rest of the meal was so good we could overlook these elements...definitely going again!", "author": "Sabrina S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-06", "description": "We were not familiar with Il Borgo but a good Open Table rating and the availability of reservations when our \"usuals\" were booked enticed us. The space itself is cute -- reminded us a bit of the late and lamented Little Italy out in the Noe Valley -- and surprisingly quiet for a San Francisco restaurant. Our greeter was our server and she was pleasant if not remotely fawning; pretty businesslike on the whole, which is not surprising since she was the only server in the restaurant. \n\nWe were enticed by the pasta offerings, so did not go too far into the menu, ordering only salads and pasta. More specifically, my wife and our friend both ordered the house salad for a starter and I had a caprese. The house salad was somewhat bitter because it was almost entirely radicchio but the dressing and gorgonzola were lovely My caprese had heirloom tomatoes, something I don't often see, and excellent fresh mozzarella, but, to quibble, the dressing was a bit too herbed for my taste. \n\nWe each had a different pasta. Our friend wanted her salmon pasta with penne rather than standard spaghetti and I wanted my puttanesca with spaghetti rather than the standard penne. The server assured us this would not be a problem. My spaghetti was cooked absolutely perfectly and the puttanesca was a good version with a strong taste of kalamata because the olives were nearly whole rather than pieced. The salmon in our friend's dish was extremely moist, which made it enjoyable, and my wife's penne with sausage and mushroom had a lot of both signature ingredients, making it probably the safest dish to recommend of all that we had. \n\nPrices were beyond reasonable. While the salads were pretty conventionally priced for the Hayes Valley, the pastas were $13 and $14 and the portions generous. I haven't paid that little for pasta -- especially good pasta -- in years.  We are adding this one to our rotation of pre-SFJazz concert dining spots in the Hayes Valley/Civic Center area.", "author": "Mike R."}

So the waitress came to our table and greeted us, and told us she'd be back to \"take our order.\" ......Then disappears for 15 minutes? We had to hunt her down again place the order. I had a bad feeling at this point, thinking that most likely the food would also be delayed (me and my boyfriend were already starving). But fine, the waitress finally returns and we place our orders. I ordered the Chicken Piccata, one of my favorite dishes at some of my other Italian spots we go to a lot.\n\nSure enough, we had to ask for order updates 3 times! And when my Chicken finally arrived, it was tasteless, but I was so hungry I ate about half. Plus, the food wasn't warm, it was kind of cool and that made me wonder if our order had been finished sooner, and just forgotten about? The wine was passable, maybe the best and most nutritious part of our meal.\n\nHere's where it gets strange: once we received the bill , my boyfriend put down his credit card. Casually, my eyes wandered across the room, and I caught a glance of our waitress - watching him place his credit card into the check.... and she rolls her eyes! Only to make her way back, after a purposefully long wait, and still has the gall to furiously ask us to pay cash? First we thought it was a joke, but she really was insisting on cash! We refused several times before she spun around in a temper tantrum to go swipe his card.\n\nWith a little effort this place can do a lot better, please work on customer service, food timing, and credit card processing.", "author": "Mackenzie C."}

First, here are the \"pros\": good location, cute old school red and white checkered tablecloth, and the food doesn't suck (note: that does not mean it is great, it just wasn't terrible). \n\nNow all of the cons, which are all service based. First, I should say the young woman who seated me, gave us our menus and brought us out our food was pleasant and helpful. That is where the good service ends here. First of all, this was obviously a pre-7pm show crowd, and yet we had to ask to order a total of 3 times, and when the person we originally flagged over came to take our order, maybe 10 minutes later, he just said \"okay, i'm here.\" No apologies for making us wait. Totally rude. \n\nHere's where it gets creepy. I don't know what his role was - bus boy or server, but this dude had to either be totally inappropriate, or, most likely, WASTED. At first I thought maybe his English just wasn't that good and there was just a little lost in translation kind of thing happening, but no, he was wildly inappropriate and obviously drunk. When he uncorked our wine he just left it on the table...wasn't going to pour any glasses...then he grabbed a bunch of our glasses to pour but he couldn't seem to figure out how or which order to pour them in. So we asked him to just leave the bottle at our table, and we would pour it. Then he stood there, smelling the cork, staring creepily at us. . .we literally had to ask him to please leave us alone. I was ready to walk out, but thankfully he didn't come back to our table after that. \n\nAnother gem: we asked for grated cheese. After about 10 minutes of waiting, someone just dropped off a giant hunk of cheese and a cheese grater at our table....what the actual eff...?\n\nOh, and then when we paid, we found someone else's credit card (in addition to ours) with our check, and they somehow combined our bill with someone else's and split the charge, and we ended up with this poor guy's card, who ended up being overcharged for his meal! We didn't ask to split the check or anything, we literally handed them one card, and yet they couldn't even handle properly charging us for our meal. We are nice people, and wanted to make sure this other guy wasn't screwed, so we brought it to their attention before leaving. \n\nUnfortunately I didn't start reading the bad reviews about service until after I arrived and was waiting for my friends, but BELIEVE THE BAD REVIEWS ABOUT SERVICE. I will NEVER come back here, and unless you have absolutely no other options, do not waste your time here. There is absolutely nothing about this place that redeems that horrible service, it is inexcusable, and paying customers who were not once rude to any of the staff do not deserve to be treated like that. So absurd. I almost feel like I was being punked.\n\nThis restaurant would be an excellent candidate for Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

So I was really looking forward to the ambiance and food when I finally got the chance to eat there.  I went on a Saturday (4/8/17) evening arriving about 6:30 pm meeting up with a friend who was already there. There were two waiters working that night neither of which paid any attention to us as we waited.  My friend got one of their attention and asked for another glass of water.  We read the menus which were already on the table and made our decision.  Waited and waited. Then a sort of unkempt older guy comes over wearing jeans and wrinkled shirt with a green apron haphazardly tied and asked us, I think, if we were ready to order. (He looked more like a short order cook than a waiter).  No greeting of any kind! I asked for a glass of wine and he named the three wines of which I could only make out \"Grigio\" as the place was buzzing with conversations from other tables and with his accent it was hard to make out what he was saying. I ordered the penne mushroom and sausage with Italian sauce and my friend ordered the lobster ravioli. This \"waiter\" was very preoccupied his manner was one of impatience and he seemed irritated about something. He was not pleasant. So he poured the Grigio and left and later I got his attention and asked for a different wine as the Grigio was of poor quality. I asked for a red wine this time, I couldn't understand what he said about the vintage but I didn't like the taste of it either, however, I kept it.  When the herb salad arrived it was fresh and tasty and the bread was also put upon the table at the same time. A few bites into the salad the main meals arrived of penne and ravioli. Now the tables in this restaurant are really small so our table was crowded with platters, the salad, bread, glasses of water, and wine glass. My friend asked for tea so we had a tea pot on the table too of which our waiter, who never introduced himself, sloppily pushed 3 bags of green tea in between the dishes and made no offer to take away any of the dishes on the crowded table. One of the two waiters happened to be walking by and we asked her to take away some of the dishes. By the way the other two waiters were dressed professionally in black pants, white shirt, and white neat aprons. The penne with mushroom and sausage was well prepared and tasty but nothing memorable and my friend was disappointed with his lobster ravioli as he said it was bland. He said there was no noticeable lobster taste. I tasted it for myself and there was just the slightest hint of a lobster taste and indeed the sauce was bland. Sorry to say I was disappointed in the service and the meal. The bathroom was cool with a big dungeon-like lock on the door.", "author": "Zii R."}

I am never coming back. \nI came here for my parents to meet my boyfriends parents. The server was very rude to us and did not smile at all. Never repeated our order and walked away. She had a stick up her ass or something. When we asked for the check she asked if we wanted desserts or coffee, in which I replied \"no\" and then she rolled her eyes and walked away. When we were about to pay, she said that they only accept cash and not card, when it clearly says \"we accept visa\" outside of the building on their window. My boyfriend went up to her to tell her that and she said \"my machine isn't working. Go get me cash or check\" and then turned around. We were mortified because my boyfriend was paying for everything and she made him look bad. We eventually got cash from the ATM and gave her the money without tip because we wanted the check presenter back. She came to me and told me that she didn't include the tip and that we had to leave a tip. RUDE. We left a dollar. She can suck my ass. My advice for everyone out there: DO NOT COME TO EAT HERE.

We had a larger party (about 7 or so people) which made it hard to find a table on a weekend night without a 30 minute wait. \n\nAt first we thought the restaurant was pretty quaint and charming however no matter how cute a restaurant is at first glance, it's really irrelevant if that food and service are both awful. After we ordered, we asked the guy who took our order if we could get separate checks when we paid. As soon as we requested this he looked at us and groaned. I've worked in customer service for over year, and I know that this is no way to treat customers! Actually, I'm pretty sure working in customer service isn't even necessary to know that this isn't right. We were slightly put off by the way that he reacted to us asking for separate checks as we had requested it in advance rather than at the end when we're paying (because I understand that's more annoying). \n\nThe food arrived and my friend's food was made incorrectly. She had asked multiple times for it to be made without chicken and, behold, there was chicken in her pasta. The food was nothing to rave about. The tomato sauces felt like they were lacking that little zing. In all honesty, the jarred Prego tomato sauces taste better than the ones from Il Borgo.\n\nWhen we requested checks, he told us that all of our amounts, except for one dish, were the same even though all of our items were priced differently on the menu. Most of us were overcharged for the dish. Additionally, my friend was charged extra for not wanting meat in her pasta. When we asked him, he simply dismissed us and said that was how much we had to pay. The whole thing was simply confusing, and he was difficult to understand. Tips hadn't been added to our meal prices yet so it didn't make sense as to why we were being charged more and why all of our meals were coming out to the same price. \n\nAll in all, we had an awful experience and would never come back. I'd advise you guys to the same. I had thought it would be a good meal, decent, at the very least, but boy was I wrong. Don't come here unless you enjoy bland, less than mediocre Italian food, rude service, and being overcharged for your meal.", "author": "Christy W."}

Other places more highly rated were packed so I came here, noticing that it was about a third empty. Found a seat near the door & waited for a menu. It took about five minutes for one to show up, with another 10 minute wait or so for my order to be taken. Asked the owner (I assumed--he spoke with a heavy accent) if they served bread & he answered abruptly that they did; some would be arriving from the oven soon enough. Ok....so I didn't order the bruschetta! Got the Lobster Raviolis (about $16) with a Caesar salad ($6) and a diet coke. \n\nThe bread came in long, thin slices, absolutely boring. Then the salad arrived, unimpressively simple. No real flavor or pizazz; just romaine lettuce with croutons. The Raviolis were absolutely dreadful, long thin strips of bland pasta, with hardly any filling inside in a sauce that wasn't rich enough for my palate. However, the tiramisu I got for dessert was definitely delicious, if a little too soggy/mushy. My cappuccino was also well-done and worth the price, if only to get the taste of those terrible raviolis out of my mouth. \n\nI could easily give the dessert four stars, but the main course was some of the worst Italian food I've had out in years.

My wife and I had one of the most horrible experiences here. She came to visit for the weekend and it really tainted our time together in SF. If you want to eat in a dark, hot, stinking, worn-down dungeon environment then this is the restaurant for you. The proprietor Italian woman was really rude and nasty. The food was substandard and waaaay overpriced! The proprietor - who is also the sole waitress here - is basically trying to scam everyone for as much money as she can. Part of the tactic is to seem very busy so she doesn't spend too much time with you explaining anything. When we asked about if they have glasses of wine she rattled off a few and seemed really annoyed when I asked about the price. That's ludicrous. When we got the glasses of wine for eight dollars each, it was one of the worst I have ever tasted, rather like used dish-washing water.\n\nThen, she tried to sneak onto our check a tip as part of the bill! WTF?!?! I believe this is illegal. It's up to me to leave a tip, not up to her to demand it!  We were a party of two (not a group - where some restaurants let you know in advance that a gratuity will be added to \"parties of 6 or more) She tries to sneak a fast on on us by writing up a handwritten chicken scratch of a check where you can't really read anything. When I asked her to clearly write down and break out the charges she seemed very annoyed! As if I didn't have the right to ask and know exactly what I'm paying for! And, it's only because I asked for it to be broken down line by line I found out that she added a tip automatically onto the bill of about 15%! That is totally outrageous! When I questioned her about this scammy practice she said \"her boss madkes her do it.\" SHE IS THE BOSS! Liar! I suspect if I would've just gone ahead and paid the final bill as per the chicken scratch paper and I would've gone ahead and tipped on that final amount she would've pocketed that money too (simply because it wasn't even disclosed to us that she added that the tip already!)\n\nAVOID!!

More olive oil vs butter, lighter sauces etc. but they also have some of the classic southern Italian dishes too.\n\n* FAMILY BUSINESS (mom, dad and son) all seemingly straight from Italy\nall of which are genuine as hell. speak Italian to you (they speak English too:) and with pleasure want to feed you and make you smile. i truly feel at home at Borgo.\n\n* CLEAN; forget some of the angry reviews from the past, this place is CLEAN and food is FRESH every time i have been here in the last two months.\n\n* AFFORDABLE.

The joint was full except for one long empty table. I asked for a table for one and was told there was nothing available for that night. I walked one block home and called the restaurant. I was told I could come in right away, that there was a table available. I made a reservation. FYI: I'm transgender and look male but sound female on the phone, so doubt if they knew it was me calling! I showed up, identify myself, they've made the long empty table into four two person tables, and sat down to eat. They forgot my bread, but brought it out after the lasagnetta arrived and when I reminded them. They also neglected to refill my water glass. They were excessively prompt in bringing out my bill despite the fact that there were empty tables. Their obvious discomfort with having me there was pretty funny. And the other tables got bread and refills promptly. There were two waiters working a small room, so this was not excusable.\n\nI don't know if this was transphobia or classism, but clearly they were not interested in having me as a customer in their restaurant.

These things can be looked over buuuutttt what can't be looked over is the server/?owner getting completely upset that we wanted to pay our bill with a credit card.  Other people who have reviewed here seem to have had similar experiences. She stopped smiling at us, yelled at us that we were making things difficult for her and told us she would not run our card because they were suddenly out of receipt paper.  So we sat there awkwardly, and double checked on the window pane to confirm that the establishment does in fact take credit card and decided to call her bluff.  She conveniently ignored us this whole time.  \n    Here's the best part, suddenly a large party/family walks in and needs to be seated and we're seated at a table large enough for them (everyone else in the restaurant isn't ready to go yet).  IMMEDIATELY the receipt paper is fixed and she finally runs the card and hands us the paper to sign.  My friend and I were watching her the whole time and she did not replace the receipt paper. \n    So....shady and militant service/ownership basically sums it up for meh food.  Probably the only way this place is staying afloat is forcing people to pay in cash and if you're familiar with the restaurant business you know why it's better to be paid in cash.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

When I moved here I was glad to have a nice little Italian restaurant on the corner but when I went there I was surprised at just how great it really is. \n\nYou walk in and the first thing you notice is the decor. Between the wooden tables, the candlelight, and the little details on the shelves around the restaurant, it sets you at ease and makes you feel like you're in a little villa in Italy and not on Fell St. The hostess there is delightful. She greets you right away with a big smile and makes you feel at home.\n\nYou can't go wrong no matter what you order.  Everything on the menu is home-made, even the bread. I've had almost everything on the menu now and from the appetizers to the pasta to the chicken to the variety of artisan pizzas I can tell you that it's all good. If you still have room for dessert after this the tiramisu is out of this world. Even the house chianti is better than at most other restaurants.\n\n This place has ruined us for all other Italian restaurants, and very happily so. Every now and then my girlfriend and I will go to another Italian restaurant when we're in another part of the city and every time we always end up saying \"nope, not as good as il Borgo\".  We're not alone in this, either. We have numerous family and friends that say they \"MUST visit il Borgo\" when visiting. \n\nIt's just a start-to-finish great dining experience that makes it the go-to place for all special occasions for us and we will keep going back for many years to come.", "author": "Dave E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-03", "description": "I am torn on this place, but thought it was an interesting enough experience to write my first Yelp review in years. My boyfriend and I came here while starving since we live in the neighborhood and have walked by many times. It looks very cozy with nice lighting, ideal for a cute, neighborhood date. When we came in, there were 2-3 four tops open as well as another table for two by the window, but the waitress gestured for us to take a table for two right by the bathroom, where one chair was crowded right up against the chair of the table next to it. My boyfriend and I asked to have the other table for two instead, which was fine with the waitress. No big deal. \n\nThe problems started when I got some kind of a pasta that was not what I ordered. We let the one waitress know and she just said \"Okay, give me the mistake.\" No apologies. My artichoke ravioli came a little while later. The waitress said, \"Careful, it's very hot.\" When I hesitated for a few seconds because I thought she was going to set it down on my table for me, she just handed it to me and said, \"Why don't you use your head? If it's so hot, how can I be handling it?\" I just couldn't believe she spoke to a customer this way. I'm not sure why she didn't just walk two more steps to the side of the table to put it on the table, rather than handing me a dish over my boyfriend's shoulder. I was pretty mad, but I rationalized that it's just because she's a kind of fiery Italian lady and doesn't mean anything by it. I can see, though, how other reviewers have perceived her as being rude. \n\nThe problem though is that the ravioli was, as other reviewers have said, exquisite. The wrapper was clearly home made and the filling had a light, fresh artichoke flavor that was not overshadowed by the light tomato sauce. I would love to eat  it again anytime. The portions were just right. I think I would wrestle with myself when coming back however - the ravioli is amazing (five stars) but the bruschetta, salad, and pizza wre just okay (3.5 stars) and I feel like the service can be unpredictable (2 stars) - from warm and friendly to attitude. Maybe I can find a compromise in getting take out so I can avoid the service while still getting great ravioli a few blocks away from home.", "author": "Lijia X."}

And it wasn't just our food that was screwed up--our checks were too. Big time (read: scam).\n\n-- Food: I got the Fettuccine Il Borgo, which was supposed to be fettuccine, sun dried tomatoes, chicken, and capers. The tomato sauce tasted stale and was severely lacking in flavor--I had to douse my food in red pepper flakes to taste ANYTHING. My fettuccine was oddly dense and definitely did not taste fresh at all. The WORST part: the chicken. Not only was it completely tasteless, the texture was so off-putting--soft and jelly-like, almost like tofu. One of my friends who also ordered this dish agreed wholeheartedly. The last time I checked, chicken is supposed to be...I don't know, fibrous? At least chewable. I don't think I've ever had chicken so strange and inedible in my life.\n\n-- Service (TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE): As a party of seven, we asked the server (ostensibly the owner) to split our checks. Of course, we understood that it would be an inconvenience, but we were prepared to tip generously in return. When we received our checks, they were not separate. Instead, six out of seven of us received the same check. \n\nIn other words, even though my dish was listed as $13.00 on the menu, my friend's dish was $12.75 (penne with mushrooms and sausage), my other friend's dish (artichoke ravioli) was $13.75, etc...we somehow all owed $14.95, according to the server and check that somehow encompassed six of our differently-priced dishes.\n \n\"Everyone came out to $15.00,\" the server and/or owner said. \n\nSeriously? What kind of outright scam is this? I'm pretty sure a five-year-old could figure out that with tax and whatever other charges they decided to tack on (as another diner recently noted, there was NO breakdown on our bill...is that even legal?), WE WOULD NOT ALL BE PAYING $14.95. Even if there was a gratuity charge for parties larger than x number of people, it should have been clearly listed on the menu or the bill.\n\nRegrettably, we didn't question the bill or the lack of breakdown of charges, but I literally have never been so confused after a meal, attempting to figure out how much I owed. I now realize that the server/owner/restaurant was essentially scamming us--essentially stealing our money.  \n\nContrary to what the website says, this is NOT \"a small gem\" with \"some of the best Italian cuisine in the city.\"\n\nDisgusting. Stay far, far away, unless you want awful food and appalling service.", "author": "Deborah S."}

Atmosphere is a bit dark. It's actually very pleasant. Ideal for an intimate dinner date.\n\nBut the food is just OK. I'm not a huge fan of Italian to begin with, so it's got to be really special to impress me. My thinking is... \"How good could it be if I could do it better?\". That's how I felt about their Spaghetti Carbonara. It's a unique dish where the sauce is essentially made with raw eggs and some type of bacon and grated cheese. Awesome if it's done right. Borgo's version is great, if you've never had it. I also sampled one of their veal scalopini entrees which was also just a little let's say under seasoned. On a good note, I didn't see dishes that were ordered by any patrons that were \"smothered\" in tomato sauce.\n\nService was friendly enough, fairly fast and attentive. However, they don't accept credit cards. I wasn't prepared to empty my wallet, but there is an ATM machine there.

Never again!\n\nWe all ordered pastas, and the girls from our group ask for the Carbonara plates. So we had on our order two Carbonara pasta. It was the worst they ever tried. The both of them just looked bad: the so-called dressing was made from tiny bits of scrambled eggs (!) and the taste was so greasy.\n\nWe didn't want to make a fuss and waited for the lady that served our table to just come by. When she did and ask us by default how was it, we actually answered her it wasn't the best and that we couldn't eat this. She ask us if we want a box (??!) to take it home. We said no thank you, it doesn't taste good so we would like her to take our plates. She started to laugh and ignored us. From there it all went south. Starting with the comments from the open kitchen, the awful attitude, the loud laughing and disrespectful jokes they made in the back so that all the customers will share our uncomfortable situation.\n\nIt was clear for us that they will refuse to take the two Carbonara out of the check so we just asked for the check. They made us wait with the two Carbonara pastas on our table for more that 30 minutes and when she finally came she add by hand a 20% tip to our check, after all that rudeness. We were speechless. We asked her to bring us a new check without the \"personal\" note of 20% tip and you might guess what followed: a new round of loud, awful comments!

I'd been to Il Borgo once before, and both then, and now I was with a large group of 8 or more. In both cases they were able to accommodate us (we did make reservations.) I found the service to be adequate on both occasions. I had to turn around and wave over the attendant to have my bent fork replaced, and again to see the wine menu for a second bottle. In both instances, the waiter wasn't terribly busy, so he was able to see that I needed something and immediately assist. \nThe food is absolutely top notch. The bread appetizer is nicely soft and fluffy on the inside with a crisp outer crust (though not impossible to pull apart) Last time I was there, I had some sort of pasta dish, which was good, but I remember being really impressed with the pizza my neighbor had. This time around, I ordered the Funghi E Salsice pizza, and it was delicious! The sausage pieces were large and had a notable licorice taste. The dough was thin, but still firm enough to support the pizza and crisp enough to make even the crust a treat when dipped in oil at the end of each slice. I also sampled my friends prosciutto lasagna. I expected the lasagna to be taken over by sharp tomato sauce flavor, since the it was drowned in the stuff, but somehow the sauce was well balanced and satisfying. What was most impressive, though, was the texture. The lasagna noodles were incredibly thin with lots of layers, avoiding the rubbery texture I usually associate with Lasagna.\nI'm not really a coffee drinker, but if I were, I'd imagine the tiramisu would have been right on the money.

Presentation of the food wasn't super impressive and the taste wasn't all the way there. \n\nFood: \n1) Artichoke ravioli: These were homemade raviolis that looked like Chinese dumplings. The ravioli skin wasn't bad. I liked the texture, it was an appropriate thickness and overall, well made. But the filling was a little lacking of artichoke flavor. I couldn't really taste anything but just some mush in the middle. If you didn't tell me what the ravioli was filled with, I would have never in a million years been able to taste or use visual cues to identify that it was artichoke. \n2) Spaghetti: Made with a white wine sauce instead of tomato. The sauce was on the creamier side but it was well flavored. The dish wasn't presented in the most appetizing manner. It just looked like a large dish of spaghetti noodles cooked with nothing else. No variety and very bland looking. \n3) Bruschetta: Pretty good. Tomatoes were diced into larger pieces. They went liberal with the olive oil so it that was well pronounced in that taste of the dish. The bread was baked to perfection. Well made dish overall. \n\n**Notes: I just felt like the whole meal was too carb heavy. It was one big carb party. I really feel like the dishes could have used a larger variety of ingredients to prepare. Like adding in a dash of veggies here and there to add color and flavor to the dishes would have really helped. Or at least adding some meat to give a little more nutritional value. Just my two cents...\n\nService:\nPretty nice. No complaints. \n\nAmbiance: \nHeavy Italian themed decor! I loved it! Romantic dim lighting with candles at every table.

Staying at the Hotel Kabuki in Japan Town, we were looking for something with good reviews within walking distance, and this fit the bill (it's .7 of a mile away). I called ahead to make a reservation; I'm not sure it was necessary, but it was pretty steadily busy until about 9:30.

Our bread came out a bit on the cold side but we were too hungry to care. As an opener we had bruschetta, which was done perfectly in my book - big chunks of tomato, olive oil, basil, and perfectly toasted bread. My pollo pizzaiola was right on as well - tender chicken breast with tomato, olives and caper sauce, with string beans and potatoes to accompany; I liked the sauce a lot but others in my party found it a bit heavy on the capers. Their loss. Margherita pizza (mozzarella, tomatoes, fresh basil) was just right as well, though my daughter prefers it heavier on the cheese. My wife was blown away by the gorgonzola pizza (tomatoes, mozzarella, gorgonzola cheese), and everyone else who tried it liked it.

Chicken Picatta, you got it.  My friend ordered the sausage mushroom pizza.  His pizza was huge and had plenty of toppings.  My chicken picatta was just right.  It came with potatoes, veggies and artichoke.   I've been searching for good classic chicken picatta in the city and I think I found it. The sauce was on the thicker side, the chicken was thin and cooked in flour before serving.  Delightful!\n\nWe couldn't stomach dessert but the waiter gave us a free small after dinner port!

We have been here before but not in many years and waited a revisit. Upon walking in we were seated immediately. After 15 minutes our water arrived and we requested some bread. I ordered the pasta primavera, my dining companion ordered the margherita pizza. Nothing super fancy but always good choices. Our food arrived and we could not be more excited since we were starving. I took my first bite of the pasta and it tasted very bland. I decided to try another bite and yep, bland as hell. The cream sauce was like milk, no flavor, nothing. I asked my husband to try incase I was being too picky. He, who literally will eat anything, agreed that it was the blandest dish he had ever tried. I flagged down the waitress and requested some parmesan. Luckily she brought over a small bowl and I dumped the entire portion in my pasta. It was edible then but I was super bummed. I shoveled the food down to ease my hunger. We looked at the receipt when it was all over and it was 5 dollars over what was to be expected. The bill was unreadable and scribbled so we had to ask her what it said. When we explained that the pizza was three dollars less on the menu she adjusted that price but would not budge on why my pasta was two dollars more than listed. Only saying \"these are our prices, the menu is old\" . She returned and we threw down our card. The waitress (the owner) requested cash instead of the card we gave her. My hubs explained that we had no cash and only had the card (we hardly ever have cash). She stood and looked at us for a minute as if we magically would pull out dollars our of air then stormed off. Then began our wait. I saw her run our card and tend to the other tables.....for 25 minutes. I could see our receipt just hanging off the machine. She finally gave it back to us and walked away. No thank you for dining with us or how was your dinner. We left vowing to never come back. I hate having to make that decision especially since we are HUGE supporters of our local businesses.

Italian restaurants rarely wow me, and I make damn good pasta (if I do say so myself...and I do) that easily satisfies any pasta-cravings I may have.  \n\nThat said, Il Borgo blew me away.  I had dinner here a few nights ago with a family member who lives in the city.  We decided to have dinner in Hayes Valley because it is a middle point between our apartments and it is teeming with adorable places.  She found Il Borgo on Yelp, but we were open to strolling around and finding something else if we felt like it.\n\nThe delightful aromas of basil and garlic wafting out of Il Borgo sealed the deal, however.  We both started salivating before even entering this delightful little restaurant and decided that we HAD to try it.  I am so glad we did!  \n\nWe ordered the vegetable lasagnetta (with ricotta, veggies, and cheese), and the pizza margherita.  The lasagnetta came out first, and all I can say is wow.  It was amazing!  It had the perfect blend of garlic and cheese and it melted in your mouth, which is a VERY difficult thing for pasta to do!  The tomato-based sauce was savory and delicious, and I sopped up my bread in the sauce because I didn't want any of it to go to waste.  \n\nBy the time the pizza arrived, we were already full because we had stuffed ourselves on the VERY filling lasagnetta.  But it smelled so good, we couldn't resist (story of my life).  It, too, was delicious!  I am usually a parmesan cheese-fiend (who are we kidding - I am an all-kinds-of-cheese-fiend), but it was not even necessary.  The pizza could stand alone.  \n\nIn addition, the ambiance of the place is so adorable!  I was transported back to the rustic little cafes in the squares and alleys of Venice.  There are clothes lines traversing the walls and the golden faux-brick paint inside the Il Borgo gives it a warm, cozy atmosphere.  It would be a great place to share some wine and pasta - Lady and the Tramp-style - with a date.  \n\nFinally, the owner of the restaurant is a delightful Italian women.  She was really nice and helpful and wanted to make sure that we had a great experience in her restaurant.  Italian-born owner?  It doesn't get more authentic than that, folks.\n\nThe only down side to this place is that it is cash-only, which I am not too happy about in this day and age when everyone accepts credit cards.  But as long as you know that going in, it's really not a big deal.

Though I can't say the ambiance of the restaurant is to my liking I had a great time at this restaurant.  I'm not much of a fan for dim lighting, my eye sight is bad enough as it is, so the dim lit room was pretty annoying to me.  Other than that the mural on the walls and the table/chair designs gave a nice Italia feel to it.  I'd say its a pretty good date restaurant if you're looking for one.  The server was great.  She was friendly and talked up a storm with us without being too intrusive to the point where it was interrupting our meal.  I'm always a fan of talking to the workers, it just adds a lot to the overall dining experience...so it was definitely a plus in my book.  Word to the wise...this is not a big restaurant, so I would NOT recommend bringing in groups larger than 4 into this restaurant.  You'll be scrunched up and eating with your elbows tucked to your sides.\n\nI ordered the lasagnetta and good lordy...this is one heavy ass meal.  Carbs, meat, sauce and tons of cheese...just the way I like it!  Every bite was just as good as the last one and I was dying for more.  As hungry as I was, I could not find the space in my stomach to finish the entire dish.  I was pretty sad that I couldn't bring the food home to go as I had a flight early the next morning, so doggy bag was not an option.  Sadness.  The only complaint that I could make about this dish was that it was really hot during my first bite but the server did say the dish was very hot, so I should've nibbled at it a bit first before just shoving a big spoonful in my mouth.\n\nThough I did not get a chance to try some of their wine selection, I saw plenty of tables with an open bottle of wine.  I'll just assume that the wine is good here based on that...either that or San Francisco sure has a bunch of lush drinkers around which wouldn't be too surprising either.

If it's in your neighborhood, go for it; but I'm not going to leave my neighborhood again to get there.  We have \"italian\" food here too.  Reading other reviews, I wonder if the food varies with the cook of the night, but our meal was satisfactory.  And CASH ONLY.\n\nThey have a couple different red sauces.  Both are delicious.  One with a strong flavor of ripe tomatoes, and another which is tangy.  But overall, the food is standard \"italian\" food that reminds me of the place dad would chose for dinner with the extended family--food with no possibility of offending anyone; taking no risks and hitting no home runs.  The bruschetta was very good.  The lasagnetta is a lasagna noodle spun in a circle instead of layered, with one or two cheeses and minor bits of that fancy ham with a slightly tangy red sauce.  I was bored; STANDARD LASAGNA FROM COFFEEHOUSES THAT SERVE LUNCH IS MORE INTERESTING.  The spaghetti carbonara was good; more cheesy than creamy with a great red sauce.  I also want to note that the pasta plates don't come with any sides, but it is a lot of food.\n\nIt would have been a very comfortable place to eat dinner except the waiter seemed to want the door cracked open instead of closed and the cold wind was blowing the door completely open.  Another patron got up and closed the door after a couple rounds of this.\n\nThe decor is is generally charming, although it ranges from super high quality faux finishes to gaudy, which has the overall effect of \"trying too hard.\"  The waiter I would politely describe as \"efficient\", which is nearly a compliment.  But when there are only four patrons in the restaurant, \"efficient' seems borderline rude...\n\nThere are too many restaurants in S.F. for me to eat here again, but if you are hungry and nearby and on a medium budget it is okay with me if you eat here.", "author": "Alan B."}

The fettucini waqs especially buttery and the marina too runny for my taste.   Medicore food at best.\n\nWhat really got my goat about this place was the experience we had while paying our bill.  We did not realize that the place only took cash.  Another nuisance but one you can deal with as there is an ATM in the place.    My friend left his credit card in the bill when presented.  About 20 minutes passed, we finished our wine and he must have not realized that he never signed for the bill because we left the restaurant and he left his credit card in the bill jacket.   \n\nThe busboy (whom I believe is the son of the owner) comes rushing out and jumps in front of our car yelling about how we didnt pay.  My friend realizes he has left his card inside and goes back in to handle the situation.  At this point we have a bus boy standing in front of my car on Laguna with a lot of traffic behind us.   I tried to pull over to the side of the road to let traffc pass and the bus boy pulls a knife out and motions to slash my tires if I move further - As though we were going to drive off without my friend inside.  \n\nMeanwhile - my budy has since retrieved his credit card and paid in cash.  I was just in shock and in awe that we would be treated like criminals for making an honest mistake.    I cannot believe that this little pipsqueak had the nerve to pull a knife on us.

This place is great in that kitchy sort of Italian restaurant cliche way.  I think this place may be more Italianish than many of its counter parts in North Beach.  The waitress, perhaps Italian, perhaps not, spoke with an Italian accent and filtered our meal with plenty of Italian phrases, verbs and the like, including bonjourno, bon appetito, etc. it was great.  \n\nThe piped in music was moving along swimmingly with the Italian restaurant cliche, lulling me into visions of gondolas and the like while we scarfed down our yummy pizza and pasta. I will admit that the caprese salad, eh, the tomatoes were a little tough.  Also, my pizza, the Quattro, while extremely yummy, was also very oily and the crust was not too crisp.  We ate the whole thing, so no problem there, but just sayin...\n\nThis place is great for a casual dinner with friends or on a date, as I happened to find myself.

But THE thing, I mean really the THING... oh my goodness - THE THING to call out is the plate of heaven called the LASAGNETTA. They're coils of homemade noodles cut cross-wise like little jelly roll cakes. The velvety sauce with the perfect pasta texture is sinfully addictive.

I went there with some friends after hitting some bars in Hayes.  First of all, the bread was heaven - I don't know if they bake it there or what.  The fettuccine bolognese  - some of the best I've had.  Pasta was perfectly adente.   And the portions are huge and you can't beat the prices.  I probably had more processed carbs that night than I have in a week, but it was well worth it.  \n\nThe service was ok.  The host was somewhat indifferent.", "author": "Eric C."}

Our party of 6 sat right in the middle of restaurant (as it should be for any birthday) and then off we went with ordering. Menu? Standard italian (american) dishes. \n\nOrdered? Margherita pizza appetizer. Lobster Ravioli. Spaghetti Bolognese. Penne E Funghi Salsiccie (mushroom and sausage). Grilled chicken entree. Forgot the rest. Overall, the food was decent and the penne dish was very good. Was not a fan of the overly fishy lobster ravioli (mush?) or the bolognese - think noodles and meat lacking any hint of a flavored tomato sauce. \n\nWhile food was sufficiently satisfying (portions and flavors) I was left disappointed overall because of the terrible service. Yes, every table was full. Yes, she was working alone. Not my problem... especially if I catch you swigging a glass of wine behind the counter doodling on paper.  It took her over 30 min. to just take our order (thank God we were all just chatting it up) and even longer to make refills, take additional orders or even get us a starter basket of bread. She also had the audacity to moderately complain about all are ordering asking us to consolidate our needs because she was the only one working. WTF!?! Oh, and its cash only and she does all the checks by hand. \n\nThe place has decent food but put it this way, after walking out of the restaurant and strolling down the block, I saw two other places I would have rather visited. At least it's something to check off the list.", "author": "Jonny Bobby G."}

After a too-long nap and getting ready session, we checked nextbus.org per a talk thread a few days ago, and realized we had only two minutes before the next 21 Hayes passed us by.   I grabbed my keys and unplugged my various hair straightening devices, and off we went.  It took us a good minute and a half to get out and a block over to the bus stop, and the bus was rolling down the street right on time.  This nextbus thing is priceless!  So, we got to Il Borgo and were sat right away, although they put us at a two-top right in the middle of the small room.  I don't like that; I feel put on display when I'm not on the perimeter, and there was a table for two available, though maybe it was reserved...don't know.  \n\nOur waiter was a middle-aged Italian guy, he seemed pretty authentically Italian.  He brought a loaf of nice soft crusty bread, but it was cold and it would have been nice it they'd given us the illusion that it was just baked by serving it warm.  It was still yummy though.  There was nothing to spread onto our bread or dip it into, although after looking around at other tables, I saw that we just seemed to be missing our olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and their accompanying dipping dish.  I stealthily stole these accoutrements from the empty table next to us and  we devoured the entire loaf over the course of our meal.  \n\nI had the artichoke ravioli which was really amazing, and my Irish husband had the Spaghetti Carbonara, which he said tasted just like his Mom used to make.  Incidentally, I tried to make the same dish for him a few years ago, spaghetti, cream, and bacon, and he did not like it.  At all.  So, we were pretty impressed.  They didn't offer a list of by-the-glass wine, which was unfortunate.  We both got glasses without knowing how much they were and would have been better off getting a bottle to split pricewise.  \n\nOur waiter took a bit too long to bring our check, and I paid in cash and he brought weird change, so that I had to either leave a tip that was either a buck too small or a couple of bucks too much.  I went for too much, because although he was slow, he was a sweetheart and I think we'll be going back to this place.  Hopefully next time he'll seat us on the perimeter of this great little space.", "author": "kelly m."}

It is a sit down dinner restaurant that DOESN'T TAKE CARD!!!!    They have an atm that charges a fee in the restaurant.  This is a petty trick you encounter in pizza parlors, not something  for atmospheric urban dinner restaurants. \n\nThe food is really awful.  We ordered the eggplant fussili, and got a ridiculous amount of pasta that totally ruined the continuity of the sauce...making what would have been a plain dish HUGE and BAD.  Our second dish was the lobster ravioli which came out moderately cold and just as bad....absolutely plain.  What they lack in quality, they try to make up for in volume....20 big bright orange plain pasta cubes isn't better than 6 good hot ravioli.  The bread was the best part of the meal, and I give it a 5 out of 10.  A glass of average pinot rings in at almost $7(the price isnt even listed on the menu) \n\nThe place seems inexpensive, but our ticket for 2 came in at $40 after tip and tax...I could have gotten a MUCH better meal for that price, and had dessert, too.

Sundried tomato adds the proper greasiness but finely balanced out by the sourness of capers. Such a great dish for only $13.\n\nHighly recommended by people: Lobster Ravioli.\nThe sauce is so good, especially with the bread. Our plate was so clean that it looked like someone licked it clean. The ravioli are great, but the whole dish is a little too straight forward (nothing else besides ravioli and sauce). But it's what you get and what you expect in home cooking. So I still think it's great.\n\nBruschetta was fresh, with very crunchy toasted bread. But I could make better Bruschestta.\n\nLast but not least, the Tiramisu'. If you don't the Tiramisu' here after your meal, you are missing out, your experience would not be complete. The Tiramisu' is SOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!! It is indeed the only one I've tried in US that I've felt: wow!! it's better than the ones I made!! Get it, period.\n\nTo the lady who works there: I wish I could be as gorgeous as you are at your age.", "author": "Yuchi C."}

You can do a good dinner for two and a bottle of wine for around $50-60. It's a small restaurant, perhaps 15 tables. If you ask the wait staff about a dish they are probably the ones who prepped it earlier that day. The inside is made up to look like a Italian villa, complete with a clothesline and an awning (indoors). It is a romantic place, complete with checkered tablecloths and those candles made from wine bottles with the wax drippings coating the bottle. Think Lady & The Tramp without the dogs. \n\nThe only downside is that it can get quite hot in there. The gear from the kitchen can make it rather warm.  Probably not the best place to go on a hot summer night.\n\nHighly recommended for the overall combo of value, food, and atmosphere.  Definitely not high brow. Think more cutesy.", "author": "A A."}

Busy enough... so that one might find a modicum of a challenge in getting any service *at all*  They staffed two... that is DEUX, DOS, etc ... twice as many as one, half as many as there should of been.... people.  \n\nThere was a sweet, but mindlessly distant owner-type... fancying cocktails on a beach somewhere in the backwaters of her mind... as she couldn't force herself to pay attention to the fact that the poor dishwasher preparing every single meal for every single table was panicking and, in a word, melting down like a trainwreck.\n\nOh.. I mixed my metaphors, but you should have seen what this cat did to the food.  It was like... fusion.  Like really fusion.. Not the good kind.\n\nShe recommended the bolognese... and it tasted like... you know air that is sort of musty and smoggy... if that air had substantive taste, mass, and surface area... it would have tasted like that.\n\nBut the gnocci???  I am not sre if he A) took them a previous meal three days ago or B) cooked them in a high powered dishwasher.\n\nWhen the gnocci hit my mouth, it felt like I was chewing three hour old bubble gum.  Yeah.  No shit.  I even used the description that the texture was like toothpaste.\n\nI like to think that I am an unpretensious foodie... and I feel the need to 'splain something.  I have *never* sent a dish back.  I cannot remember *ever* not eating a dish, even when it was completely wrong.  I am easy going, and I am friendly, and I have worked fine dining and low dining enough to know that it isn't always one person's fault.... you have to spit in my food in front of me to get me to tip less than 20%.\n\nThe service took... FOREVER.  Like... 45 minutes to get bread and water on the table.  The place was quaint, but I am only saying that because this place has an absence of service, skill, and flavour enough to go around.\n\nI mean... don't waste your time.  I am putting the description of the gnocci at the top as well... so when you get hear you realize that by reading that at the beginning, you are actually in the future, or something like a Tarantino film coming back around... and if the restaurant review doesn't work for you, well.. at least it was fun.\n\nAnd I saw Thievery Corporation that night.

The male owner always seems overworked but hanging in there. The female waitress/owner (?) is never there on weekends anymore when we are. We miss her. My sweetie loves that she speaks Italian to him. \n\nThere is a gray-haired waiter who once gave my group complimentary shots of Grappa, \"the national drink of Italy\" he said. I'm sure it was meant as a nice gesture but none of us drink hard alcohol and some didn't drink alcohol at all, so we had a hard time with this stuff especially since the rest of us had to polish it off. We always laugh about that experience.\n\nHowever one time that same talkative waiter said some rather inappropriate things to my sweetie and I, and we felt a little uneasy for the rest of the dinner and for the next few times we were there.

This was by far the worst meal I have ever had in San Francisco, and probably in the top 5 of top worst meals ever. Let's start with the decor, we thought we were at the Italian section of epcot center, with the faux outside/inside decor, it was totally tacky, and I am all for campy kitsch, but it wasn't clever enough to be so. Ok, now the most important part, the food, the caprese was ice cold with dry oregeno flakes all over it, no taste and then shocks of spices. And sadly the pasta was inedible, I ordered the fettucine bolognese, and it was like american chop seuy back in grade school, just missing a good doughy hamburger bun. So overall, not good, don't go unless you want a bad meal in a disney land setting.", "author": "Brando W."}

From the minute I walked in, I felt I was transported to Italy itself!  Complete with a clothes line strung across the restaurant with clothes hanging on it.  The murals were Italian streets making you feel as though you're sitting at an outdoor cafe in Italy.  \n\nOur server was an older Italian gentleman who I believe owned the restaurant before he retired to working only 10 hours a week as a waiter.  Very nice and welcoming.  The service was fast and not overbearing, wine always refilled, and the timing of the food & apps was spot on.\n\nBegan with an Italian red, pino nero - deliciously light and from what our waiter told us, relatively rare in SF.  Not terribly expensive either.  Around $30 - brilliant compliment to the food.\n\nHad the bruscetta - very fresh tomatoes, but it lacked cheese.  Not a big deal to me, but a slight disappointment to my dining companion.  Although, without the cheese it seemed far more like authentic Italian than the high fat Americanized version.  \n\nFor entrees:  I ordered chicken breast stuffed with cheese & prosciutto with a dark rosemary gravy, veggies, and potatoes, my companion had lasagnetta, which was a rolled lasagna in a light and creamy red sauce.  Just delicious!  \n\nThe prices are completely reasonable, averaging $12 - 18 a plate.  Probably my new favorite Italian restaurant in my hood.

Like a period set from a movie lot, Il Borgo is almost too genuine to believe, but on entering the warm dining room from the street corner, warmth, sincere hospitality and scents of garlic and a working grill tug and draw you into this time warp with maternal arms.  It's small, rustic, dated and charming.  We were greeted by a sweet Italian lady who brought pints of water and menus, then a big basket of generously sliced sweet French bread to dip in virgin olive oil and a good Balsamic vinegar.  \n\nThe menu is short, sweet and feels like the real thing.  Pasta and pizza, antipasti, zuppa, entree and a simple, authentic Italian wine list conjure up village bistro's in rural Italy that are frequented and supported by the local villagers and this seems just like that.  The three of us went our own way with the menu, grilled Salmon, house made fettuccine with a tomato putanesca sauce and I opted for pillow like Gnocchi in the lightest, sweetest Gorgonzola sauce I've ever tasted.  This restaurant doesn't blink and eye at making almost anything you might ask for if the chef has the ingredients so feel free to discuss and even ask for what your heart desires, you'll likely get it.  The Salmon was generous and gorgeous on the large oval platter accompanied by a selection of sauteed vegetables my friend wanted cooked to order.  Jose's Fettuccine was al dente and so perfect I wanted to frame and freeze it to eat whenever I crave the best pasta ever.  My Gnocchi was so light and flavorful with the perfect sauce, light and cheesy, cooked so righteously I wanted to cry.  \n\nThe portions here are humongous so its impossible to leave hungry, but many folks do leave with a doggie bag for the next day, and return a week later for their two meal for the price of one fix.  I didn't see old fashion garlic bread on the menu and asked our charming waitress and what came out was delicious, among the best garlic breads I've had.  We were each stuffed when we left and I vow to return here many times in the future, I love Il Borgo and hope you do too.", "author": "Stu S."}

Do the Merlot. I am not a chianti fan in any case and this Merlot was actually quite balanced. One look at the menu and the bruscetta and artichoke ravioli (chef's special) were both no brainers. BTW, I learned bruschetta is pronounced 'brus-ketta'. Damn...and you think you know these things! I think I learned a lot more italian than I could have on one of those CDs.

The antipasto platter was great, and the Prosecco bottle was a mere $29. I had the artichoke ravioli, which was perfect for me. Made with love and detail, but classic Italian fare.  My boyfriend went with the pesto gnocchi based on yelpers galore. However, it was a bit overcooked and the large portion became a bit monotonous (sad that we are so used to getting 5 gnocchi).

Find out who won the Home Run Derby, 2. Get my hands on an iPhone, and 3. Have some good italian food. I still need to find someone with an iPhone.\n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to try Il Borgo out, seeing that they would be open after the All Star Game ended. I had seen this place many times (especially when the Fell Street freeway exit used to dump you right in front), but never had gone in. Parking can be a pain, which is about usual for this neighborhood, but we found parking right across the street. The place was near empty when we arrived, so we sat immediately and looked over the menu.\n\nI ordered the lobster ravioli while she ordered the artichoke ravioli. Both were very delicious, even though I was jealous of the insane amount of garlic that came with her dish. The ravioli looks handmade, which made it extra delicious for me. We also ordered a bottle of wine and a caprese salad that came with an obscene amount of fresh ground pepper (which to me, is a good thing).\n\nThe waitress, who may or may not have been the owner, was very nice and was very good about recommending the wine. The food was quick, as in the second we were done with the caprese our ravioli arrived. When we were done we sat and finished our wine and it was nice. There was some drum and bass playing, which I found a little odd, but I didn't really notice it after a while.\n\nUnfortunately, they are a cash only business. Having to double-check at the door that you have enough cash is a little annoying, but I'd say the food is worth it. Not sure why they do this, though. Also, even though the website says they close at 11:30 Monday - Saturday, we left around 10:30ish and they were closing. So I'm not sure about the time thing.\n\nJust remember to bring cash, for real.", "author": "Alexis C."}

With a few dashes of crushed red pepper, this was a satisfying meal with unexpectedly tender white chicken and a tasty sauce. No wait, usually a bonus. \r\nCons: Wasn't into the Fettucine Bolognese, but the person who ordered it enjoyed it. The Ensalata Borgo could use another green thrown into it instead of being solely comprised of radicchio. Also could have used a more prominent acidic element in the vinaigrette. It seemed to be dressed only with oil. Cruets of oil and vinegar were on the table, so I just added it myself. The wines by the glass weren't listed on the menu, I prefer to know the origin and price of what I'm ordering. \r\nThe decor abounds with baubles and bric-a-brac as well as those far too often utilized kitschy countryside murals. \r\nBitching aside, I actually enjoyed my pasta quite a bit and it seriously was enough for 3 meals for me. Price to value ratio is high, cash only.", "author": "Candice L."}

However, I took 3 friends there last night and we all had pretty negative experiences. The fact that only about 1/3 of the tables had any partons on a Saturday night should have been a red flag. The waitstaff was unfriendly and univiting. We all ordered different dishes, and while the food was ok, there are plenty of places in this city with much tastier Italian food. The Gnocchi I had was decent but monotonous. My boyfriend's pasta primavera hardly had any vegetables in it, just a few peas and tomato chunks. It was overpriced, and the fact that they are cash only was a huge hassle and seems incredibly archaic. The only redeeming part of the dinner was the tirumisu, which was delicious. \n\nWhile the food was ok, I would never go back there again, except maybe for tiramisu. Next time I want Italian Food, I'll just head to my other tried and true favorites in the city; Bocce Cafe in North Beach or Valenica Pizzeria and Pasta in the Mission.", "author": "Alex W."}

I'm friendly enough with the workers that they throw a glass of wine or some tiramisu my way every once in a while, so I have to make sure I don't wear out my welcome and 2.) it is approximately 15 feet from my front door, and it is a slippery slippery slope towards eating at il Borgo every night. I mean, who wouldn't want to come home every night to a big plate of downy gnocchi or creamy lasagnetta?

I can hardly believe it myself. Just the length of time the restaurant has been in business is testament to how good it is). We love it. Of all the neighborhood restaurants, we go to this one the most. The dishes are always consistently flavorful and Sergio, the owner, comes by to chat if there is time. Sergio's wife, Mitra is wonderful and friendly and comes by with her wine glass full of water and sits with us to chat, too, if it's not busy. She helps me practice Italian, French, and more. She is fun. Our menu favorites are the lamb chops, the mista salad, the tiramisu and a cappucino. I love the savory and flavorful dishes. One time we asked Sergio if there was anything different and he brought out a fresh fish to show us. We just said sure we wanted to try something new, and he made us the most wonderful, delicious dinner made from it, not on the menu. Another time, we came over and it was around 10pm, I think. Sergio and the guys from the kitchen (they are nice, too - I always say hello) had cleaned and closed up the kitchen due to it was a slow night. They were sitting at one of the tables winding down. We asked if they were still open and they explained what was going on but they would make us food if we'd like. We asked them if they were sure they didn't mind and they were all really great and smiling and opened the kitchen back up and made us dinner! la mia seconda famiglia! I feel that good when I get up to go home.", "author": "Lia H."}

I had the sausage, mushroom penne special for the day and I really liked it.  The pasta is cooked al dente and not heavy on the tomato sauce.  Its a HUGE portion for the price ($10).  The bread is fresh, warm and soft.  I love it because its so close to my place and the people who work there (possibly owners?) are so friendly and warm.  It only took them about 15 minutes for my take out order.  Great place.", "author": "F S."}

And most of the time, when I go to my friends' favorite Italian joints I'm always reminded that we are all subjective creatures...and oftentimes I'm disappointed by either the quality of the food or the prices, or both.  I work hard for my money and the last thing I want to do is spend it on crap Italian food.  So, that's where Il Borgo comes in.   I have never been disappointed by this place --  either food or price-wise.  The pizza, the gnocchi, the pasta -- all good.  Great, in fact.  I prefer to go during the week when it's less crowded and the marvelous Italian hostess is on duty.  Weekends usually result in a wait (never too long) and a less efficient and pleasant wait staff.  (I think the male host's main tactic in dealing with waiting customers is to ignore them.  Bad tactic.)  There are few restaurants I can go to for an excellent Italian meal that never disappoints and won't wreak havoc on my checking account.", "author": "G. B."}

I'm a total sucker for fresh, homemade pasta, so I adored the thick chewy fettuccini with delicious thick Bolognese. The atmosphere was funky and original while being totally authentic. The service made everything very special. The menu includes both healthy and decadent options for a wide range of diners. I whole-heartedly recommend this adorable and savory neighborhood restaurant.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

The bread is excellent, reminds me of Italian Star bread I used to get in an Italian neighborhood back on the East Coast.  We had two helpings and ate it all!  I had the Penne alla Putenesca - the penne was cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce was tangy and delicious.  Lots of olives and capers.  My date had the Saltimbocca - it was excellent, a great Marsala-like sauce, the chicken was just right and there was lots of prosciutto.  The Vegetable medley was not the same old tired and soggy zucchini and carrots.... it was freshly cooked and there were green beans, broccoli and fresh tomatoes. \nOur waitress was very friendly and attentive (it was 5:00 and we were the first in the place for the evening).  this place is just as good and better than anyplace in North Beach and I will return!\nAnd the atmosphere is just perfect for the little neighborhood joint that it is!", "author": "kris c."}

Cozy, unpretentious, romantic, you feel like you're in an Italian courtyard.  Food is great - some fresh pastas, tasty sauces, cheap wine, but it's the ambiance that gets me every time.  I get so tired of the giant, converted warehouse type style of a lot of the \"fine\" SF restaurants, where you are all crammed next to each other, have to scream to your dining companion to be heard above the noise, and yet can hear everything your neighbor is saying.  Whenever I'm tired of that kind of thing, I head over to Il Borgo and have a leisurely 2 hour meal.  Love them!", "author": "Kristi S."}

But I was raised close to my Sicilian grandmother and her wondrous cooking so i feel more Italian than i really am. I'm used to smelling sauce on the stove by 6am for a 6pm dinner w/ all the cousins, aunts and uncles. Italian. Yea. Sweet family life. The wife and i love Borgo for this very reason. It's like going to visit the Italian side of the family except all the faces have changed. But the warmth and charm haven't. Plus it's so dang local we can walk there from our place. LOVE the red & white checked tablecloths. The candles dripping onto the wine bottles. The fresh, warm homemade bread sent to your table as soon as you arrive. And the Italian owner started singing a tarantella behind the counter for his own pleasure which soon became ours. The penne con salsiccia w/ mushrooms is a personal fave of mine. (Penne pasta, sweet homemade sausage, and mushrooms drenched in a rich, red tomato sauce.) Sprinkle some fresh parmesan on that baby and you're transported to the boot-shaped country that kicked it all off. The wife had a 'molte bene' homemade fettucine smothered in a more gravy-like meat sauce w/ mushrooms. We looked right outta \"The Lady and the Tramp\", eating off each other's plates, damn near slurping up the same piece of fettucine, one of us on each end. We walked outta the place stuffed and satisfied, paying around $30 bucks. This place is simple. Real simple. Like me. Like the wife. You don't have to get all dressed up but you can if you want to. They treat you the same either way: Like family. Desidera in tensione la famiglia di Borgo!!! (Long live the Borgo family!!!)", "author": "Mark A."}

This place is funky, in so many ways. Things you should know before you venture through the doors. They only serve wine, and the wine list is all italian and very limited in selection. We tried four different bottles of red wine (eight of us...), there are only about eight choices of reds, even fewer of white, and one prosecco. I think we only enjoyed the last bottle we ordered (Nero D'Avila) because we were fairly buzzed by then. The wines were all dry and some even tasted effervescant like flat champagne, very off, even maybe \"corked\" per se. They don't serve beer or liquor. The service was one haughty looking italian woman who pretended for quite awhile that the eight of us were just some mirage in her way. We had to flag her down and ask her to take our orders etc.... This is a small place, one room schoolhouse type joint. The chairs are very heavy iron outdoor type chairs that my boyfriend had to haul aside everytime I needed to get up. They do have some wood booths that looked fun to sit in. They don't take credit cards but they do have an on-site ATM machine so they can charge you a frickin fee for cash, I hate that scam. The one shiny spot was the food. I had artichoke ravioli, it was fresh and just right, I actually ate every bit of it. My boyfriend has penne with sausage and mushrooms and he liked it. Everyone liked their food. It was my friend's birthday and they brought her tiramusu with candle in it, that was a nice touch. The prices are not bad and you get quite a bit of food. I don't know if I would choose to come back here just because the wine list and lack of liquor choices, those things matter too much to me. There are so many amazing wines in California, there really is no excuse for a bad selection of off tasting wines...", "author": "Samantha J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-01", "description": "As a former New Yorker and half Sicilian I have high standards for Italian food. Borgo is my favorite Italian restaurant in San Francisco. I give it five stars - in spite of a cash only policy and a decor that is on the cheesy side - because the food is always authentic, fresh, flavorful and perfectly cooked. The menu doesn't vary much - which allows the kitchen to maintain a wonderful consistency. My favorites include spaghetti with salmon, chicken saltimboca and their signature dish - lasgnetta. This consists of delicate spirals of fresh pasta rolled with cheese and fresh tomato sauce, rather than layered top to bottom like traditional lasagna. My husband loves the crispy pizza that is cooked on a fire, as well as the spicy Penne Arrabbiata. Service is wam and friendly - it seems like a family is running the place, so if you go often you'll meet all the relatives of the owner Sergio.  When you take our next stroll through Hayes Valley, don't overlook this hidden gem.", "author": "rosemary p."}
