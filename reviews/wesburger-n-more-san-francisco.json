Overall it was super tasty. The chicken sandwich is by far the best part of what we ordered. Personally, I kinda wish I got the regular chicken sandwich and not the hot, but I am just a baby when it comes to spiciness despite being up for the challenge...anyways, the chicken was fried to perfection and the cole slaw provided the perfect relief from the spiciness. \n\nAlso, my boyfriend did mention that the burrito was more of a cold-wrap than a burrito, since all of the ingredients are cold except the fried chicken.\n\nThe sides were great too; the mac and cheese was a little bit plain tasting, but the queso tots definitely made up for it.

I would definitely eat this again. 3.5/5.\n\nTots-- a bit soft from delivery, good amount of saltiness and savoriness. Pretty standard overall though, so 3/5. \n\nUpon first glance, the fried chicken sandwich looked very much like my beloved The Bird (which only sells fried chicken sandwiches), down to the purple lettuce and dark fried meat. While the meat was flavored, it didn't wow the way that the Bird Does with its flavor punch that perfectly complements their pickled lettuce. The lettuce on this sandwich added a nice crunch, but hard to discern the taste when eaten with the bread. On its own, the lettuce was lettuce, pickled onions were the same as those in the salad (yum), and dill pickle slices were nice and sweet. The meat on its own was good, but no chicken flavor. The chicken was decently moist and easy to chew through, which is always appreciated. There was a little bit of heat that appeared as I ate the entire sandwich, but nothing that came up initially. A bit short of 3.5/5.", "author": "Nicole H."}

The main aspects of a burger I care about are the patty seasoning, mouth feel, and complementary ingredients.\n\nThe bun is solid and isn't too distracting, plus provides enough support to prevent the burger from falling apart.\n\ncomplementary ingredients (tomato, onion, lettuce, american cheese, thousand island) are tasty and provide variety to accentuate the main star...\n\nThe burger patty - this was the highlight of the burger and the main reason I enjoyed this burger. They cook it medium by default, but they build a slightly salty crust on the top and bottom of the patty when they cook it, which adds texture (mouth feel lol) and extra flavor. Each bite is just salty enough to bring out the flavor of the patty while the complementary ingredients bring it all together, which will make you want to take the next bite and the flavor never gets boring.\n\nNot that expensive for SF prices (~$11) and they took a bit of time to make it, but it was very delicious and in my opinion is better than other SF burgers out there (marlowe, garaje, wayfare tavern, etc)", "author": "Will Y."}

Since that time, I've always been looking for my next opportunity to recreate that magic because as it stands, I have a few more years to wait until Shake Shack makes it way to the Bay Area.\n\nWesBurger's PB&J Burger was definitely as close as it gets in my opinion. The burger features peanut butter, fried onion straws, jalapeno strawberry jam, and sharp cheddar. On first bite, the peanut butter definitely hits you right away but not in an overwhelming way. Instead, it provides a nice creamy, nuttiness to the burger that just makes you think \"yum!\". I also liked how the onion straws were crisp and contrasted with the peanut butter. The jam also had a nice sweet undertone. However, I'm not sure if it was supposed to impart any spiciness from the jalapenos though because it didn't. That being said, it was a delicious burger through and through! I do wish that the burger still came with greens though...I felt like it was definitely missing.\n\nEach burger also comes with a side of tots which is AWESOME because this day and age it seems like every other up and coming burger joint charges for every topping and side, either $0.50 for $1 per topping and upwards of $4-5 for sides which is RIDICULOUS cause it skyrockets your burger from a respectable $8-10 to an absurd $15-20. Come on, it's a burger! \n\nCustomer service is also top notch at WesBurger. Despite ordering to-go, I felt like I still received full service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-02", "description": "Overall - All around likely the best burger restaurant in San Francisco. The insane thing about this place is not just the burgers, but every other menu item is a 10/10. Maybe Queso dip with brisket bits added isn't your jam, but its the best damn Queso Dip with Briskit Bits you will find anywhere. Same goes for all the burgers. They have several options. Ive had all of them and they are all amazing. \n\nExecution - Whoever owns this restaurant should be very proud of their staff, all the way from the GM down to the line cooks and other employees. Everyone is so friendly and on point when they need to be. Always clean and tidy. Napkins always filled, everything always in the right spot, you could not ask for better service. \n\nConsistency - This is a big standout for them. Ive been a bunch of times and my good friend many many more. Something that annoys me is that you fall in love with a place, and an item, and you come back and its Great! But then you come back a few more times and its different, its not the thing you fell in love with. That has not happened to me here its something that really takes this place to the next level mentally when Im thinking about going. There are no mental snags saying 'oh its good but will it be amazing this time or will it be mediocre'. So far its always been the same and incredible !!\n\nMenu - Burgers are amazing. The ones Ive had - 'All-American', 'Hot Wes' 'PB&J' are Americana with a twist and they are best in class no doubt top top top level stuff in San Francisco and beyond. The chicken sando honestly is my favorite chicken sando in SF even though they are a \"burger place\". The fried chicken burrito is a top 3 contender for best burrito. WesBurger is the real deal, a true triple threat ! Im not vegetarian but the smoked portobello sandwich is out of this world so tasty !! Additionally, they provide two house salsas in sauce bottles both are excellent. Overall its some American classics with a Mexican twist. Perfect for the Mission District.\n\nConclusion - Its hard to stop saying good things about this place, but overall its the combination of the amazing food, execution of the establishment, and consistency that keep me coming back. Im a bay area native and Ive lived in SF for almost 8 years, and I Highly Recommend this place to: burger lovers, vegetarians, burrito lovers, chicken sando lovers, families, adults, EVERYONE should go here.", "author": "Adam M."}

The collared greens weren't my favorite but at least I got some veggies in for the day. The mac n chz was bomb! The grainey taste just made it even better. I also tried the deluxe tots.

It happened to my two other friends so I felt I have to say something. This is not okay. Especially since this place is not a normal sit down with service restaurant, tip should not be automatically expected. I was curious to see if other yelpers experienced the same thing and of course some did. I found that the manager or boss responded to those yelpers with my same complaint that \"it happened by mistake\" and that they'll look into it. Well, clearly you haven't looked into it. Clearly your employees are trying to be sneaky and add a 20% tip to our bill. 20, not even 15%!! \n\nPrice: Aside from the ridiculous tip that was automatically included, prices were not reasonable. $11 for a burger and $8 for some deluxe tator tots.\n\nTaste time: Tater tots were actually good. I'm very particular with tator tots but these were perfectly crunchy and their sauce added to my impression. \n\nI also ordered The Hot Wes burger. This burger was extremely mediocre for an extremely expensive price. I know a good burger when I taste one and this was not one. Meat was dry. Wasn't a fan of their special sauce and they put way too much of it that it was sooo messy. \n\nMy last comment was that after I completed my order I decided that I wanted to add bacon to my burger and the cashier didn't seem thrilled that he had already completed my order.

My friend recommended the Nashville Hot Chicken, so I got that with a side of mac n' cheese and potato salad.\n\nMaybe it was just the time of day, but I got fried chicken with the worst breading to chicken ratio I've ever witnessed. I appreciated that everything was boneless, but it felt like they sliced a piece of chicken breast (the kind you might buy at grocery stores) vertically into thirds or fourths and gave you 3 pieces of that with tons of breading fried multiple times over. I honestly felt like I barely had chicken in the majority of my bites, and the cross-section just looked abysmal because of how thin the actual chicken was. The Nashville spice mix is no doubt a \"big kick in the pants,\" as they say in their description, but I felt like they overdid it with mine. The flavor was already pretty baked into the breading, but it seemed soaked on top of that, as every time I cut a piece of chicken, a considerable amount of hot oil would ooze out also. Eventually, the spice was just pretty numbing without a particularly compelling flavor behind it. I actually think it would have tasted fantastic if they took all the excess oil, etc. off, and I ate it with table(?) sauce they provide (the red one).\n\nNeither of my sides were particularly memorable either. The mac n' cheese fell prey to the classic problem where the top layer is all nicely crusted and delicious, but everything underneath felt neglected, with the cheese being a little gross-tasting and the side overall just devolving more and more into indiscriminate mush until I finally stopped eating it. The potato salad was okay--I thought it was decent when drowned with their table sauce, but it wasn't really able to hold its own without it.\n\nService was super friendly, and I really like that they let you self-serve everything from utensils to water. Prices are also fairly reasonable. Looking at reviews, I think it's possible that I got the wrong thing or experienced an unlucky time of day in their kitchen cycle. The chicken I got would definitely have been a lot better for a sandwich, and their menu has a lot of interesting options such as the Fried Chicken Burrito and Hot Wes that I would definitely consider coming back to try. At the same time, Taqueria Canc\u00fan, which I think has the best burrito in the area is literally next door, and I think I'd be hard-pressed to believe that going to WesBurger again would ever be more worth it than eating again at Canc\u00fan.", "author": "Michael Z."}

This place has solid burgers with great execution - no gimmicky or trendy ingredients or toppings.  I usually get the Wes burger and it usually comes out with a perfectly medium patty and queso cheese drenched all over it.  It's perfect if you're craving a hearty, greasy burger.  \n\nI've also tried their tater tots and fried chicken, both of which come out extremely crispy and crunchy.  Diverse enough of a beer selection to accompany your meal as well.  Props to them for having Fieldwork beer on tap as well - hard to find that and is easily my favorite brewery around.

After much debate and recommendations from the friendly staff, we decided on ordering the deluxe tots, All-American burger, crispy chicken sandwich, and horchata milkshake. \n\nThe deluxe tots were so damn good. The proportion of bacon, grilled onions, and sauce were perfect. We were very pleased as it was a perfectly sized appetizer. \n\nThe horchata milkshake was just heavenly. It tasted like rice pudding, slightly grainy in a good way, and a perfect amount of cinnamon. Served in a large traditional shake glass, I wish I had ordered two of these. \n\nThe all-American burger was cooked perfectly. It was crispy on the edges and juicy. I asked for the onions grilled and the didn't disappoint. It was messy but very, very tasty. \n\nThe crispy chicken was breaded perfectly. They use thigh so it was tender and juicy.

Real quality move. \n\nI don't know what's wrong with these people giving not great reviews. Something clearly is. I like it how one of the reviews states it was a cut of chicken they'd never come across before. First, there's 4 cuts off a chicken (unless we're talking about the feet or something). Second, they use chicken thighs, which is a better cut of meat than the breast. Literally read any respectable chef's cookbook and they'll say the same thing. I don't typically respond to negative reviews in my reviews, but that's how backwards I feel a negative review of this place is. \n\nI don't know how you wouldn't like this place, unless you don't actually like food.

Husband got the portobello ruben & even though we haven't been eating much meat lately I decided to go with the PB&J burger, cooked medium.

Husband was like hmm, would have been nice to know that when we were ordering. The queso on the queso tots was watery but they tasted ok. I tried one of the plain tots on my plate and it tasted like it had been fried in old grease. The portobello sandwich tasted ok (really smoky) but it was kind of an intense flavor and a lot of one flavor in a sandwich. My PB&J burger started off tasty. I had cut it in half to make it easier to eat. When I got to the middle of the meat there were some really spongy gross stringy pieces of meat. I looked at the other half & realized that even though the meat wasn't pink or red, it was uncooked, hence the spongy texture. It really grossed me out and I think that was the nail in the meat coffin for me.

When i go back, and yes I'll definitely be going back, I'd rather go with regular tots. They were a perfect crisp, its just that the onions and sauce were too much to be a compliment to a burger.

However, this place transcends that core customer base by providing a certain amount of culinary cred I find hard to resist. That's because they make their burgers with brisket.

I decided this would be a good place to meet Jamie W. after work since i had a long haul on BART from which I needed comfort food to recover.\n\nIt's a small menu but I was immediately drawn to their burger of the week, the $11 Frito Pie Burger, which took their brisket burger and added chili gravy, queso, pickled jalapenos, diced onions, and yes, a pile of Fritos (photo: http://bit.ly/2d7t6ty). There was no reason for me to think this would be a culinary masterpiece, but it was awfully satisfying because I honestly couldn't remember what decade it was that I last had Fritos. It was like a big beef nacho plate in a bun. To accompany that, I ordered the $6 side of Queso Tots, a Mexican take on tater tots, one of life's more fool-proof junk foods since they were purely addictive (photo: http://bit.ly/2chzWiV).\n\nJamie was wiser and ordered the $13 Southern Style Fried Chicken Plate, which consisted of two medium-size pieces - a breast and a thigh - accompanied by two sides of his choice, collard greens and brisket beans (photo: http://bit.ly/2cmnQ6s). The chicken was pretty good, perhaps a bit drier than Jamie wanted, but the brisket beans were awfully tasty.

I enjoy spicy foods a lot, but I like spice that adds to the flavor of a dish, and I'm sorry to say but this spice took away from the chicken. It's pretty greasy and tasteless, only saving grace for the chicken was that it was juicy. I saw photos of their beans, collard greens, and potato salad and all three didn't look appetizing, so I hoped to sub in tots for one of the sides, which they didn't allow. So I got two sides of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was okay, I liked the bread crumbs on top, it gave it a nice crisp, but the cheese sauce was super grainy. This made the texture of the entire dish pretty weird to eat. I also tried their cucumber sour which was pretty unique.

The chicken was really crispy & definitely spicy. The spiciness was more from a chili oil absorbed through the crispy skin. Every bite of this chicken was a MAJOR crunch. I do not recommend the side of beans because they tasted overly smoked and artificial, but other than that this plate was very different but delicious! \n\nFried Chicken Burrito: My favorite.

The fried chicken burrito was just OK to me.

The Portabella Reuben looked absolutely amazing, and the tater tots that came alongside it were also perfectly done.

I would have expected way more meat underneath the crust but almost every bite was dominated entirely by the crust. The spicy flavoring was pretty good though, but I imagine it would have been better if the meat had been seasoned with it. Most of the flavor was on the outside, which I picked off due to its prevalence, so I lost out on a good amount of the flavor due to that. However, the mac and cheese and beans I got as my sides were delicious! Also, the amount of food we got for the money really wasn't too bad at all. \n\nFinally, the styling of WesBurger was on point. All the decorations, seating, and color schemes reminded me of an old-time diner, and the gaping skylight in the ceiling let in ample natural light.

I would get this again but would also want to try some of the other burger options. It's slightly smaller than Causewell's in the Marina, but on-par with the kind of burger you'd expect to find. I liked this burger better than Popson's.\n\nNASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN ($10) - Deep fried chicken sandwich, but spicy. Served with garlic mayo, lettuce, and pickles. Probably one of the better chicken sandwiches you'll find in San Francisco, and reasonably priced.

I was there on week ONE of the fried chicken pop-up and was chatting with him and asking what other fried chicken types he was going to do, I  and suggested the Tennessee Hot fried chicken as an option , and he said \"yes\" that would happen  - so I take credit for this place now, even though I am likely delusional.\n\nLast night was the night we got to go. Parking in \"the Mish\" is a pain, FOR SURE. But we got a spot in one of those weird little alleys which I think is a good tip.\n\nWe ordered the loaded tots, I ordered theTennessee hot fried chicken sandwich and my man go the hot mess burger. Both were fantastic - and he ain't kiddin' that chicken sandwich is pretty dang spicy, I choked on my first bite, then settled in to enjoy. The burger was as good as it was at the pop-up at Mojo, flavorful, juicy and a nice crust (At Mojo the were cooked in cast iron skillets). The chicken was a nice big piece & super crunchy outside and moist inside.  I wish he did onion rings!!! (\"Are you listening Wes?\")\n\nMy only complaint would be that the tots came out BEFORE the sammys. I like them as a side - not an appetizer. \n\nWes is still very involved - running food and schmoozing.  \n\nBathrooms are nice and clean.", "author": "Amy W."}

When I went I got a normal order ($4) and thought that was the perfect amount to share with me and my boyfriend. \n\nOnto the burgers, they should really be shining here but for the price point I've had better, bigger burgers. All burgers come at with a 6oz patty with various toppings depending on what burger you choose. I got the Wes burger ($11) thinking that was their signature since the name Wes is in it. I have to say the burger was average. I guess nothing was wrong with it, but the burger itself didn't have a wow factor. The queso could have had more of a flavor though. On the burger it ended up not really tasting like anything. I'd say they're comparable to Super Burgers, except the patty isn't as thin. \n\nMy boyfriend had the chicken plate ($13) with mac n cheese and potato salad as our sides. The potato salad was pretty good with more of a mustard base and the mac n cheese had great flavor, but unfortunately had a really grainy texture. The plate came with two fried chicken thighs.

We're both vegetarian so usually we end up getting Mexican food since it's usually quick, easy and cheap for veggie options. We poked our heads in because a casual burger spot sounded good, but we didn't expect much for vegetarian options. Luckily for us we came to just the right place. \n\nThey have a house-made veggie patty, cauliflower steak, fried tofu \"chicken\" sandwich, and probably some other things I'm totally blanking on. We ended up getting the fried tofu sandwich (because how often to you see a fried tofu sandwich?) with potato salad for a side. The sandwich was so good, and the tofu was cooked perfectly. I've never had a sandwich like this, and the toppings really brought out some great flavors in the sandwich as a whole. I could not stop using their spicy and table sauces on everything we ordered. \n\nWe shared both the sandwich and the potato salad and it was a perfectly filling hold-me-over until a later dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-04-26", "description": "I loved WesBurger in the past. After today I'm never going back. I have never in my entire life experienced what I did just there. RIDICULOUS! I now question any previous 1 star reviews I gave before because this one takes it to a new level and I have to reset my scale. \n\nIt started when my fiancee and I walked in to get a burger to-go. I got a Hot Wes and she got a chicken sandwich and we got tots and mac and cheese to share. They said they would call our name when it was ready. Ordered a beer to drink while we waited and sat down right next to the counter. That was around 7:19 according to the receipt. \n\nAround 8pm we realized we had been waiting a really long time. It was hard to tell who was getting their order but then we realized the people in front of us who had ordered for there had got their burger, ate it, and left. I asked how much longer on my order and they asked around. I figured they lost it or something. That's when they checked the bags on the counter it was sitting right there for at least 20+ minutes! \n\nThey give me the bag and apologize. I check the order and everything is lukewarm! Who wants a fancy cold burger? I mentioned it to the guy at the counter and they offer to redo it. I say that's fine. We asked how long it would take and they say \"we are slammed so it will take 20+ minutes\". That's when my fiancee asks if there is a manager. The guy says \"I'm the highest person here right now\" (first lie). He then offers to put the ticket first in the kitchen. We agree. My fiancee is annoyed and decides to go back to the house while I wait. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later another guy comes out and hands me a bag. Says something to the effect that I should call in my order closer to when I come in next time. I told him that was a to-go order I made right there and was waiting here. I didn't call anything in. \n\nI walk out and quickly realize the bag is even colder than the one I had before. In fact IT WAS THE SAME EXACT BAG! Nothing was re-done. They gave me my same order! \n\nI walk back in thinking it was mistake because it was the other guy that handed me the bag and that they were still remaking my order. I tell the guy at the counter and he says \"No it's all new! We just used the same bag!\" I then point out the tots are the same tots from before where I open the box to check the temp before. THE GUY AT THE REGISTER WHO WAS JUST TOUCHING MONEY AND HAD NOT WASHED HIS HANDS YET REACHES IN AND TOUCHES THE TOTS AND SAYS \"these are fresh tots!\". So gross! Major health code issues!\n\nI'm in shock! I can't believe it! I walk out and check the items in the bag again. Everything is cold. The cheese has hardened on everything. At this point the order is around an hour old. I storm back in and tell the guy straight to his face that he lied to me. It's the same order. He offers a refund which I accept. \n\nI then ask for a manager's phone number or an owner's contact info since he said there was no managers there. Suddenly.... A WILD MANAGER APPEARS! It was the guy that handed the cold bag back! He said he checked the order in the back and everything felt warm. He changed the cheese on the tots and changed the mac and cheese but everything else was fine so he re-bagged it! He lied about that because both of things he had admired to doing were still both cold. I said that is ridiculous and the guy just shrugged at me. Additionally - did he touch all our food to make this judgement? Seems like another violation. If its not a violation its absolutely unappetizing.\n\nThey lied to me 3 times. Touched my food without gloves or clean hands! Wasted an hour of time! Left me hungry. Never am I ever coming back. Going to miss that mac and cheese and that chicken sando. Just terrible.\n\nWesBurger.. If you are reading this, you guys made a mistake and admitted to it and instead of fixing it you made 3 more mistakes.

Not sure if they're scooping malt, but if so it was too much. \n\nThe veggie burger's patty was pretty bad. We could tell there were nuts , onions, and a green like spinach in there. Didn't really have texture or much going for it. \n\nThe queso tots, however, were the biggest disappointment by far. There was a very small amount of queso that had oozed down the bottom of the paper bowl. A slight film of some part of the cheese was still on top but not impressed at all.

No stickiness or little messes anywhere.

I would probably eat this first next time to give it a fair rating as I had the half of the Nashville hot chicken first, but - it was very tender and moist, not overcooked, and very savory. Didn't need ketchup but it could have probably helped to have something a bit tangy to cut against the richness. To be fair, they did have pickles but I don't like pickles so I picked them all out.\n\nNASHVILLE HOT CHICKEN - just okay. I felt like the chicken was overfried (yes, it was crunchy, but also EXTREMELY greasy) and I barely tasted or felt any chicken meat when I was chewing. I would probably just stick with the burgers next time.\n\nDELUXE TOTS - MUST GET. Perfect to kick back with a beer or soda. Perfectly fried - crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The deluxe seems to be a weekly special and I didn't catch what it was but it came with bacon and some kinda orange sauce.

It's a little on the pricey side for sure, but I cannot deny the quality of food I got, the service I received, and the time of cooking. It all creates for a wonderful experience; plus, the ambiance is something that this city needs more of these days, especially with all the hipsters. All I want is to be transported to simpler times, and WesBurger does exactly that with its retro countertops and stools and its 1950s decor. For $8, you get the deluxe tots - a plate of hot taters, grilled onions, bacon bits, and their own spicy aioli. This thing is freaking delicious. But wait, there's more. Get yourself an All American burger with bacon (extra $2), and you'll be transported back to different times. A healthy beef patty with grilled buns, oozing cheese, plenty of drippings, and the classic lettuce, tomato, onion combo. The only downside is that this meal will cost you around $34/$35 after tax and tip (with a beer). The buns could be a little less soft, but what can you do? It's a damn good burger that will leave your hands a mess, but your stomach in smiles. You'll thank me later.", "author": "Danny C."}

I feel like I've tried them all and this is hands down the best premium burger place in the city.  If you don't believe me, just come see for yourself.\n\nWes is hella creative, and painstakingly perfectionistic.  Their veggie burger is by far the best one out there and I am a perpetual carnivore so that's saying something.  It's got something like two dozen ingredients and they are separately  prepared in like 8 separate allotments so everything is cooked to the right level and then the burger is assembled. You get to reap the benefits of this immaculate creation. \n\nAnd see that? I opened with the veggie burger, this place is that good!\n\nThe other burgers are petty damn epic, I often order both the Hot Wes (spicy and mouth-wateringly delish) and the Nashville Hot Chicken sandwich and do a 50/50 split for my first course; half of each because I can't bear to choose between them.  And if you're not feeling the Hot Wes' spice, then either the Okie (hella onions, son!) or All American (special sauce for days) will set you correct.  \n\nTheir tots are no joke either, especially the animal style joints with caramelized onions and bacons are off the chain. \n\nWhy are you still reading this?

The fixings could use some adjusting though. The lettuce for example, was pretty much minimal on my burger. I ended up adding my own lettuce from home. The one tomato was thin and soft because the skin came off. You know, when you pull the string sort of thing. On both occasions I had to add some variation of 'sauce' such as mustard or ketchup. First visit was The Hot Wes, second was The Oki Burger.\n\nInstead of fires your burger comes with a big box of tatter tots. Those are actually quite delicious. Crunch and never oily. Do not get me wrong, I am very happy Wes' has come to The Mission. We need more burger joints! I can't say it competes with the burgers at Radish or Hog & Rocks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-31", "description": "4.5 STARS\n\nEvery day I get my daily dose of what's happening in this world via Elite Daily and Buzzfeed. Besides reporting on the latest Kartrashian news like what they ate for breakfast and what soap they use to wash their ass (gotta be camera ready for all those naked selfies!), sometimes there are some worthwhile reads like this guy who hired a professional photographer to help him \"get the most likes\" on social media: http://bzfd.it/1MW2pSK. As a ridiculous as it sounds, having a professional food photographer piqued my interest. Not that I can afford one (nor would I ever hire one IF I had the money) but the thought of having drool worthy food porn...every single time via a professional is relieving for a Type A person like myself. Plus, I wouldn't have to look like that \"crazy Asian person taking food pics on a stool\" for that purrrrfect aerial shot. \n\nWesBurger has been in listed in multiple \"Best Burger Lists\" in San Francisco for the past year but his weekly pop-up at Mojo Bicycle Caf\u00e9 in NoPa was very difficult for me to get to on Wednesday nights. So, when I read that he was opening his brick and mortar up in Mission which is much closer to me, I was ecstatic! I stalked his social media posts on a daily basis for an opening date and got a chance to attend one of his soft openings earlier this week. \n\nI read that Mojo was often packed for Wes' weekly burger pop-up and he had lots of regulars. \n\nThirty minutes before soft opening night #3, there was already a line outside and he knew many customers by name so he definitely has a loyal following.\n\nFor the soft opening menu there were three burgers available ($11 each): Hot Wes (w/ onion rings, queso, and pickled jalapeno), Okie Burger (cooked on bed of onions w/ mustard, pickles, and American cheese), and I believe the Old American Burger (w/ lettuce, tomato, special sauce, and American cheese). Housemade veggie patty is available in any burger style. Also, on the menu is Fried Chicken (southern style or Nashville hot) and Tater Tots. Beer and wine only. I believe it's only cash only during the soft opening stage (ATM inside)? There's no waiter service; order at the counter, grab a number, and your food will be delivered to you. \n\nSince I had Tater Tot (my dog) in tow, we ordered to go (not recommended but we ate our food immediately in the car). I ran into fellow yelper, Michael M. while in line and took his lead on what to order since he was a regular at Wes' burger pop-up. He was nice enough to bring his order to me to take a food pic. Food porn of \"to-go\" orders never look as sexy as it's laid on a plate right? \n\nAt first glance, the Hot Wes may not look impressive, size-wise: http://bit.ly/22S1E9U but when I got to the car and unwrapped the foil....HELLO, GORGEOUS: http://bit.ly/1qllQzE. The thick, juicy brisket patty had a well-seasoned crust and was perfectly cradled by the toasted buttery brioche bun. I usually like me burgers plain with cheese because I don't want anything to distract from the delicious beefy flavor but the Hot Wes is Wes' signature burger for a reason. The melty queso, crunchy fried onion rings, and pickled jalapeno provide a harmonious melding of textures and layers of flavor. DO add bacon (+$2) on your burger for that extra layer of rich, porky flavor. My only gripe was the patty was cooked too well for my liking (medium well). Had it been medium rare, this would be my top burger pick in SF next to Rove Kitchen's. I'm confident they'll work out this kink before their grand opening. \n\nOf course, you gotta pair that delicious burger with some Tater Tots...deluxe at that ($8): http://bit.ly/1ME9qMY. Think animal style but an elevated version with bulgogi bacon that adds a savory caramelized crunch.  \n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken Platter ($13) for my friend who was waiting in the car with Tater Tot: http://bit.ly/1RNu6hF. The boneless chicken thigh has an uber crunchy batter (double fried) and was very moist and flavorful (brine?). You get three pieces so if you're hangry, you may want to order a bucket! You also get your choice of two sides (mac n' cheese, potato salad, collard greens, or baked beans). He wanted a double order of potato salad which was tangy and had a nice kick. The potatoes were a little undercooked though. \n\nThe staff were all very nice and my order to-go took about 12 minutes which was timely for a soft opening. \n\nLoved the retro ambiance with orange eames molded plastic chairs, green swivel counter chairs, and the vintage jukebox.  \n\nParking...well, it's in the heart of the mission.

I ordered a Hot Wes burger (with queso, jalape\u00f1os and onion rings) and the only thing on it I could taste was the jalape\u00f1os and the breading of the onion rings. There was not a grain of seasoning on the burger at all, not even salt; it was a big mouthful of hot, unseasoned beef, which is not at all enjoyable. The queso barely made a difference; they might as well not have put any on there. This was one of the most disappointing burgers I've ever had, and I eat an awful lot of burgers.\n\nThe milkshake, however, was very tasty.

However, don't be fooled because this place definitely does not live up to its expectations and is not worth the price either.\n\nOur total was nearly $60 (including tip). I don't know about you, but $60 dollars is pretty pricey for lunch at a burger joint! \nHere's the breakdown:\nHot Wes burger - $11\nAdd bacon - $2\nFried Chicken Sandwich - $10*** (food poison alert)\nMac n cheese - $4\n2 beers - $12\n\n... AND $8 FOR \"OPEN FOOD\". What's open food? I've come to the conclusion that it's the tater tots even though we were told that it's included with our burgers. How is it included if we were charged extra for it? I had my receipt emailed to me so I was very annoyed when I saw this the following day. I was basically ripped off to pay for more food that I didn't intend on wanting!\n\nMore so, the sneak attack to have you pay 20% for tip is also true as I've seen other yelpers warn people about! As I was signing off for my order, the cashier already had the tip set to 20%, which I found to be alarming but I  gave him the benefit of the doubt anyway that it wasn't intentionally pressed. I read that management was suppose to look into this, but nope. Still the same acts. So my question is to you now: Why have a business filled with deceit? \n\nIf you're curious about the food... mediocre.

It also had pickled jalape\u00f1os on it that I picked out, because it was basically the kind of jalape\u00f1os you get at the move theatres.. bleh. The burger was also drenched in sauce, which made the burger soggy and messy to eat. \n\nThe mac n cheese was crusted nicely on top, but fell short when you actually ate it.

For weeks he raved about these WesBurgers but I never had the inclination to want to visit a crowded popup. As the burgers got more and more popular, my friend informed me that they were soon going to leave the cafe and open a brick and mortar shop in the Mission. It's safe to say, I was excited about finally trying the food in a traditional sit down environment.\n\nI finally headed down to the shop on a Monday sometime after the lunch rush. I had every intention of ordering a burger but after looking over their menu, I had to order their special, a portobello reuben. I figured if I liked the sandwich, I'd be back for a burger in no time. Prices were reasonable as I paid somewhere around the $10 mark after taxes. In addition to soft drinks and house specials, they also have a draft selection as well as bottled beers and wine. \n\nThe ticket time for the food was about 10-12 minutes which was reasonable given how busy they were. My co-worker did order a side of tots which were served prior to our main entrees, which was nice to see. A few minutes later, their burgers began to come out as did my reuben special. The reuben simply looked amazing, grilled to perfection on a nice flat top with plenty of melted cheese. I was surprised to see that it came with tots which was a nice touch.\n\nWithout waiting much longer, I took my first bite and I was in heaven. Not only was the sandwich delicious with tons of flavor, but I hadn't had anything to eat all day making it that much more savory. If there's anything I can critique on, it's that the sandwich felt a little greasy, which could of been from the melted cheese. Nevertheless the sandwich was delicious and was enjoyed nicely with a few tator tots on the side.\n\nOverall, i was very impressed with WesBurger; the food was delicious and made to order and equally important the ambiance and decor really transports you back to a time where mom and pop diners serving burgers and fries were commonplace. In a city as expensive as San Francisco, it's nice to see a success story like WesBurger who started as a popup shop to having a brick and mortar location serving nothing but tasty food with a smile. Isn't that all you really need? I for one can't wait to be back. \n\nAmbiance/Decor: 4/5\nFood: 4/5 \nService: 4/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 4/5\n\nPros:\n+ Simple menu with burger and chicken specialties \n+ American classic sides (mac & cheese, tots, etc.)\n+ Specials (delicious portobello reuben on my given visit)\n+ Friendly staff and food runners\n+ Reasonable prices and portion sizes\n+ Draft beer, bottled beer and wine available\n+ Great old school decor and ambiance\n+ Accepts credit cards\n+ Street parking available\n\nCons:\n- Pricey", "author": "Alexander E."}

I really liked the heat of the peppers.\n\n* The Okie Burger - Being from Oklahoma, I had to try this burger. Sadly, I was disappointed. The burger was totally overpowered by the strong mustard and pickles on the bottom. Please leave those on the side! I wished there had been more grilled onions on the burger. I was tempted to stuff the onions from the tots on the burger. \n\n* The Deluxe Tots - While not exactly \"life-changing\", they were definitely good. I liked the grilled onions and queso on top. Also had a yummy spicy kick!\n\n* They also have Allagash White! Bonus points.\n\nOverall, 3.5 stars. A bit pricey for 2 burgers, 2 beers, and tots.

Burgers and tots alone would get a solid four stars.\n\nFor the second night of their soft opening at their permanent Mission Street location, I was AMAZED at how pleasant and efficient my experience was last night.  At 8:30pm, we were able to get all the menu items we wanted.  They had all the alcohol / drink choices on their menu available.  The restaurant was fully stocked and decorated.  Credit cards were accepted.  The servers were friendly.  Food came out super fast.  And the owner was even doing the serving!\n\nThe space is fun and retro - I love the light fixtures and neon hamburger - but I hope over time they add a bit more d\u00e9cor or another dropped ceiling fixture like they have over the bar, because this space is a little big and cavernous.  With more wall art or artificial lower ceilings, I think it'll feel more cozy.  Oh, and maybe a little bit dimmer lighting.  It almost looks like a grungy 70s burger joint, but it's just a little pristine and hipster-y right now, I guess.  Not a big deal, obviously...\n\nFor food, my boyfriend and I split the baked beans, mac n' cheese, tots with queso, All-American Burger, and Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich.  Almost too much food for two, but we wanted to try it all (scratch that, I did).  The baked beans were good but a little thick for my taste - more like refried beans - but I liked the smoky flavor.  The mac n' cheese was dank.  Tiny shells, lots of sauce, bread crumb topping, and served bubbling hot.  The tots were perfectly cooked and the queso was like Velveeta-Rotel goodness...I'd just get it next time with queso on the side.\n\nOK - so the main dishes.  The burger was great.  Awesome flavor, perfectly medium rare.  My only complaints were (a) cheese wasn't melted, really at all and (b) bun was a little too thick and dense.  Something thinner or softer would be good.  I felt like I had to take the thick, thick bottom bun off to really enjoy the A+ patty.  But I'd definitely eat this again and be happy, don't get me wrong.  Way better than most other burgers in SF.  The chicken though - life changing.  I mean, SO GOOD.  It's served on buttery toast, so it envelops the chicken in this little buttery nest of deliciousness.  The chicken batter is the perfect amount of thick and crispy.  The chicken is super juicy and the spices on the Nashville version are ON POINT.  There's also tons of mayo and crispy shredded lettuce.  I really can't think of a more perfect chicken sandwich.\n\nAlso - shout out to the cook that I once matched with on some dating app, recognized, and awkwardly kept staring at.  Your food was awesome - maybe we should have gone out!  LOL :)", "author": "Tay H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-05", "description": "Given the dearth of dedicated, high-end burger joints in The Mission, I was excited to happen upon new arrival WesBurger. Formerly a popup at Mojo Bicycle Cafe on Divis, this new and permanent location is primetime hipster, nestled as it is on Mission between 18th & 19th - a few doors down from Mission Street Oyster Bar and Taqueria Cancun. It's a meaty antidote to the plant-based neighbors across the way, vegans Gracias Madre & Citizen Fox, and pescy-vegan Urban Fish (all names courtesy of Hipster Name Generator). So segregated have our culinary subdivisions become they even occupy their own sides of the street.\n\nI was determined to check out WesBurger during the \"soft launch\" as, even from a quick glance at the menu posted on the door, I sensed it would attract the inevitable lines once word gets out. Shhh! Don't tell anyone, at least not until you've tried it. Inside the decor is modern and funky but with touches that recall the diners of yesteryear, not least of which the jukebox. The menu is pretty classic with a few novel twists.\n\nThe Weekly Special Burger was not yet available, and given my dislike for onions, I opted for The All-American (sans said allium) which comes with \"special sauce\". I figured this the ideal reference burger, served up classic-style with lettuce and tomato. It didn't disappoint. The 6oz patty was well cooked with a definite chargrilled flavor. The sauce was luscious and the bun light, yet reassuringly well proportioned.\n\nAll in all, a well-executed exemplar of the genre. Taste and texture-wise I'd have to rank it above something like Super Duper (and it was considerably less greasy). Meanwhile it's definitely more classic than somewhere like Roam with all its exotic meats and toppings. I'm giving a rating of 4 stars for now because 5 stars would mean ranking among my top 10 burgers of all time - this was close but no Cuban on this occasion. That said, I can absolutely see WesBurger becoming a regular favorite; not only for the convenient location but also because the food is damn good.\n\nI can easily imagine working my way through this menu over the next few months, from the various burger options to the Shrimp N' Grits, to the Nashville Hot Chicken. The drink options were also solid, with some decent beers on tap and an interesting looking green punch which contains Vermouth and, I believe, cactus juice among other things. More to come on that one.\n\nOverall, a fun place to stick a quarter in the jukebox, stick away a quart of beer and a quarter pounder* in your belly. A great addition to The Mission foodie \"see and be seen\" scene. I'll see you there. Full launch is tomorrow 4/6.\n\n*0.375lbs to be precise", "author": "Danny G."}

So I made a point of going there and trying their fried chicken burrito for dinner. Well, the burrito was not really good at all. None of the cooked ingredients was even lukewarm, and the whole thing tasted mostly of sweet corn. It was really like a bunch of leftovers raked into a tortilla. Very disappointing. But I had to correct myself and realize that SFist did not recommend the fried chicken burrito, rather, it was the fried chicken burger that received honorable mention. What now?

Begin with the burger patty itself: a custom-ground, all-brisket chuck, not smashed, but cooked with a high-enough temperature upon cast-iron to render the interior a perfect pink, and to leave a generous crust of maillard-reaction action to sweeten the deal. Add toppings: The Hot Wes ($11, a perennial favorite back at Mojo) combines viscous, salty, rich queso, crispy onion string, and jalapeno peppers for a salty, meaty, spicy nod to Wes' roots in Texas. That the brioche-style bun was perfectly toasted was simply gilding on the lilly.\n\nThe sides (namely tater-tots) remain top-notch as well. Even though the tots are of the from-the-bag variety (or at least they were the last time I checked), a golden-brown, crispy exterior and piping hot interior are notable for their fantastic execution. Go animal style ($8), with queso (a man can never have too much queso), bulgogi bacon (!), and deeply-meaty grilled onions, and your satisfaction is almost guaranteed (unless you're a human monster). Also on the menu: potent mac-and-cheese, country style beans, and potato salad.\n\nIn other offerings, double-fried chicken is available, either in sandwich form, or on its own. An informal poll indicates that its absolutely perfect (like everything else Wes cooks). Five taps of mid-range beer (including Fort Point and Deschutes) offer a great way to compliment your meal, and wine and punch are both available for the connoisseur. \n\nLikewise, the ambiance and service were exceptional. Even though staff-members were still getting trained, my beer glass never went empty, everyone was friendly, and my burger came out quickly. A renovated jukebox plays a well-curated selection of funk, soul, and blues, while signs for lone-star beer, and a stuffed armadillo lend a pleasant tex-mex ambiance to the red, gold, and stone walls. \n\nFive Stars: Exceptionally-well executed, fundamentally sound, cheap burgers with outstanding sides and good selection of beer. Wes has successfully translated his pop-up into a full-size offering.", "author": "Casey U."}

On the side, they had tater tots ($4) or cheesy tots ($6).\n\nEvery component was well executed - the meat was juicy but didn't make the bottom bun soggy, the hash brown was very crispy on the edges but still moist in the center, the ketchup was excellent and contributed the most flavor to the dish, and it was nice to enjoy a fresh english muffin, not the ones you buy from the grocery store.  My only regret was not adding on bacon since the salt, flavor, and texture would have rounded out the dish.

Seriously, this place is legit. \nI have passed by this place multiple times since it is only a few blocks from our house and had it bookmarked for awhile but since I have broken my hip, no walking or leaving the house much has been happening. Then all of a sudden, the man wants a burger and tells me to Yelp a burger place by us: BOOM - Wes is in.\nOddly, I decided against getting a burger because I noticed they had Nashville Fried Chicken on the menu and that tickled my fancy and Tony picked the All American burger sans cheese (I know... he MUST have issues not like cheese). I also picked 2 sides to try: Mac N Cheese and the Collard Greens.\nThe food came out relatively quickly and the cook(?) dropped off our food and even stated to try their house sauce at the counter. Tony takes a bite and just is in bliss; I had to steal a bite and it was perfectly cooked (we like Med Rare) and was a burger of all burgers. My chicken was amazing and incredibly spicy; he had one bite and was sweating for the rest of the time there from one piece. The collard greens were just okay but I ordered them for him more than me. I like the breadcrumbs and extra cheese melted atop the Mac N Cheese which added nice flavor. \nAs far as service, you order at the counter and then get a sign stand and pick your own table. The woman who took our order was helpful and very friendly. As we were finishing our meal, one of the managers(?) came by our table and offered us one of their beers to try which was awesome - it was a stout and was delicious.\nI am going to definitely start frequently this place once I am all healed up and just get fat and love it.", "author": "Kelly T."}

Never has a burger been made with such tender loving care. Yes, Wes takes his sweet time, that brilliant mastermind. After you go to the cafe counter and pay for the burger of the day with CASH ONLY, find a seat inside or outside and wait a good 15-20 minutes for your name to be called, summoning you to bask in the presence of the perfect burger.\n\nAnd yes, this meticulously-made burger is perfect. The bun is soft, buttery, and toasted to a slight crisp. It holds its weight against the medium-done patty full of rich, hearty ground beef that, surprisingly, is not as compact as a typical burger patty, leaving space for those succulent juices to permeate throughout and ooze everywhere imaginable. The way Wes grills the meat leaves a gorgeous charred ring on the outside, adding salty little surprises around the sides. Not gunna lie, I would've loved the patty medium-rare, but I figure however he cooks it is the way he envisions it. Melted American sits atop the meat, which perches on top of layers of refreshing salsa, crunchy Frito chips, and a bed of smooth and creamy refried beans that aren't too salty (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wes-burger-san-francisco?select=32p1ggBFYOvRQnRaYC9fyg#w5jRoG1FqKV6r4KstY3zjA). All of this is perfectly portioned to leave you full, not too bloated, and incredibly, indubitably satisfied.\n\nSo. Remember. Wes Burger Wednesdays at Mojo Bicycle Cafe (639 Divisadero St, San Francisco, CA 94117) from 6 - 10 PM, CASH ONLY, with possible pop-ups at other venues such as the SoMa StrEat Food Park.

If you live anywhere close (in The Mission) and are hungry just get up and go. Wes' (as I will refer to it during the rest of this review) was suggested to me by a co-worker. Since it wasn't too far from my apartment I decided to walk down and try it out that weekend.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at this establishment twice.\n\nFOOD: Funny enough I still haven't had one of Wes' burgers. The real reason I adventured over to this restaurant was to try the fabled Fried Chicken Burrito. Yes, you read that write. A dream that can be made a reality. The burrito comes fully stocked with fried chicken, corn salad, pinto beans, avocado, cheese, and salsa and by golly is it good. I've ordered it both times I've gone. Now The Mission is known for it's Mexican food and burritos so this might come under some scrutiny. But honestly you can't compare the two. This is a completely different style of burrito. Approach it with an open mind and you'll be delighted. I've also had the deluxe tots. I'm from the east coast and out there deluxe tots means you are getting chili and cheese on tots but Wes' were different. Honestly I can't even tell you what all was on the tots but I can tell you it was tasty. I can't remember the last time I ordered deluxe tots and was surprised by what was topping them. The tots themselves are almost a meal so I suggest splitting them with someone if you also want an entree. You will definitely leave with a full stomach. One day soon I'll venture back to try a burger.\n\nDRINK: Wes' has a nice selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks. I normally just get water with my food but I was impressed with their beer selection.\n\nATMOSPHERE: This place has a cool atmosphere. It honestly kind of reminds of a 50's style restaurant type of atmosphere. Music isn't too loud. The tables are close to either diners but nobody bothers anyone else. There are also booths if you want a little more privacy.\n\nSTAFF: The staff doesn't wait on your tables besides dropping off the food you order at the register. So besides registering there isn't much interaction. But the staff working the register has always been super friendly and when I first dined at Wes' someone came out of the back to ask how I was enjoying my meal. I also appreciate that.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI love trying new things. I'll go out of my way to eat something that I don't normally get in my week to week meals. Wes' takes the cake in that arena so far in my venturing around SF. I can't recommend this restaurant enough.", "author": "Christopher D."}

The burger is ground pretty chunky so each bite has a ton of flavor of beef regardless of how much awesome sauce is on it. My go has become the Okie with onions and mustard. The tots are also great with the hot sauce on them and bacon. And happy hour Mon thru Fri has $2 lone star, so you can't beat that. This is the next step from the awesome popup Wes used to host.

Once as takeout for food during the Warriors game and once dining in. \n\nThe takeout experience was quick and easy. Called it in and they had it ready in 15 mins. Cool take out bags too. not sure why they wrap the sandwiches in foil and then put it in the boxes though. Felt like that made the sandwich a litte soggy. \n\nWe had the original, Hot Wes, Southern style fried chicken sandwich, loaded tots, and regular tots.\n\nOriginal and the Hot Wes were both pretty weak. Meat was over done, wasn't that juicy, no interesting ingredients. I liked the bun though. Wouldn't order these again.\n\nThe Southern Style Fried Chicken Sandwich was surprisingly good. Big piece of crispy fried chicken, nice coleslaw, pickles, and some good sweet and tangy sauce. I'd come back to try this again.\n\nTots. Loaded tots had some good sauce on them and grilled onions were nice, but the other toppings didn't really add anything. Also, the tots are way over-fried. All I could taste was oil. Couldn't taste any potato. Wouldn't order this again.\n\nMy dine in experience was nice. Came mid afternoon on a weekday and there was like 2 people in there. Has like an 80s diner kinda vibe going on in there. Came for the Southern Style Fried Chicken Sandwich and was hoping to get some fries, but they don't have any. Bad move. What kind of burger joint doesn't have fries? The sandwich comes with tots though. Wonder if that's like lunch or dine in thing. Didn't get that when I ordered take out. \n\nThe sandwich was still pretty good. Had all the flavors i remember, but it just needed more sauce. The first one I had was more saucy and was much better. They have a table sauce when you die in that was pretty good. Not really sure what it was and the lady working there said it's had to describe, but it was like sweet, tangy, a little spicy. Made the tots edible as they were still over-fried and didn't taste like potatoes. \n\nWas feeling fat so on the way out I ordered a milkshake. I was between the buttermilk and peanut butter. The waitress recommended the peanut butter so i obliged. They also had a new flavor, horchata, which in retrospect I should have ordered since I never had one before. The peanut butter shake was just meh. The consistency wasn't that great and there was some kind of sour taste in it. Not sure if they use buttermilk in all their shakes or if it's from the peanut butter they use. Wouldn't order this shake again, but might have to stop by and try the horchata.\n\nBasically the best thing I had at this burger joint, was the friend chicken sandwich. Smh. Why can't we get a good burger spot in the Mission? Nothing fancy, just a classic burger and some fries. Something like Whiz burger, but that actually tastes good...\n\nTLDR May come back for the Southern Style Fried Chicken Sandwich. Over-fried tater tots only, no fries...", "author": "Dominic G."}

This was... not it. It wasn't terrible (it tasted just fine), but I can't say it was much better than a much cheaper burger at 5 guys, or the nearby whiz burger. Very greasy (which is fine by me) and had a few interesting options, but didn't at all justify the price. Wasn't very big either, was probably the same size as the much cheaper 5 guys or whiz burger too.\n\nThe buttermilk milkshake was interesting, maybe someone interested in a more unusual milkshake might enjoy it, but it just wasn't for me. I think people with a more \"avant garde\" palate might enjoy it (and that's fine), but if you're expecting a typical milkshake I'd skip it. Kinda tasted like unsweetened yogurt (or, in my own opinion, bad milk), but some people like that buttermilk flavor, so if that appeals to you go for it.\n\nAll in all, paying 12$ for a burger at a place that doesn't even have full table service is a little weird, and the quality of the food really doesn't justify it. Unless you're dying to try the next hipster-y, gentrification reminder I'd probably skip this", "author": "Rafael M."}

I find it shocking and actually a little upsetting when the burger emoji isn't in my \"Recently Used\" keyboard, and an old friend and I have been known engage in some casual BEXTing, a.k.a. burger-texting... it can get kinda steamy. \n\nAll that to say that I pretty much hit the jackpot when Wes Burger Wednesdays came to Mojo Bicycle Cafe, just two blocks from home. (However, I can also say that it is fortunate for my waistline that this a weekly pop-up and not a permanent fixture--that would just be dangerous.)\n\nWes Rowe knows burgers. He's the SF blogger for Serious Eats' A Hamburger Today blog. I mean, Wes frequently wears a shirt of burger photos, for God's sake. So we are all extremely lucky that he has put years of burger connoisseurship into practice and starting slinging them for us, the poor, hungry masses.\n\nI've had the original \"Hot Wes\" (his take on Jack in the Box's \"Hot Mess\" burger, which won the SF Burger Brawl earlier this year), a sort-of generic All American Burger, which was delicious but free of any notable \"gimmick,\" and most recently an excellent Southern sort of creation with a fried green tomato, thick slabs of bacon, and a truly great jalapeno-pimento cheese sauce. Wes Burger's patties have always had a really excellent charred crust on a perfectly juicy pink middle, and the buttered and toasted buns have always held up, which is a big deal to me. The ingredients are fresh, and it doesn't hurt that Wes is easy on the eyes and charming you from his post at the smokey grill (note: Mojo will get smokey, so maybe watch what you wear). \n\nI have a pal who questions my frequenting a burger spot that doesn't offer fries. Having had Wes Burger's Southern-style scotch eggs a week or two ago, I am prepared to laugh in her face next time she mentions it. These spicy-sauced, fried hard-boiled eggs were ridiculously good and I've never a potato I didn't like, but I'd easily pick them over fries any day. So yes, Wes Burger also offers other delicious things. My roommate has had the pop-up brunch over at Virgil's and had great things to say, but she can write her own love letter. \n\nWes Burger also pops up in the MIssion on Sunday nights, so you can enjoy an excellent burger at Mr. Pollo if you prefer.

Anyway, You order then take a seat. Then wait over 30 minutes for your burger to eventually arrive. No explanation as to why it is taking so long either (when there aren't a lot of diners).  My guess is they prioritize take out orders?? On a side note: Don't tip until after service, It is self serve there, meaning: you get your own napkins, silverware, water. Why do you have to tip?

The burgers are small and not worth $11 it. I couldn't justify the price, if the taste was there but it wasn't. In fact, the pictures uploaded to Yelp simply do not depict what you get. What I got was a skimpy small burger with a thin patty of meat. The tots were nice and hot but nothing special was making them \"loaded\" some sort of grilled onion spicy sauce whatcha-ma-callit. My friend said it tasted like the same sauce on the all-american burger.  I won't go back", "author": "A V."}

I had a Seitan craving (became a pescitarian a few months ago), but the cheesesteak place was all out so I ended up finding Wes Burger while on my way somewhere else and figured I'd try something unfamiliar. I got the Wes veggie burger and it was fantastic, I've never had a veggie burger cooked so similar to an actual burger it was definitely top notch, so much of the look and taste resembled an actual beef burger I actually thought they might have screwed up and gave me a beef burger and had to kinda look closely at the bottom of the patty in which I can see some pieces of veggie in it. It was impressive and a great way to satisfy a meat craving as a dedicated, but new and sometimes struggling non meat eater. The service was fast and the environment of the place was cool. I would give it five stars but the milkshake was really bad in my opinion, but maybe it's a preference thing. It just tasted kinda sour or buttery and not sweet enough, it was kinda weird but maybe some people are into that. I am a big milkshake critic so a bad shake would normally mean me never wanting to go somewhere again, but this burger was so damn good I'd def go again and just not get the shake. They had a lot of stuff on the menu that sounded really good, I definitely want to return and try more of the menu.", "author": "Dakota F."}

The slightly pricey burgers are the essence of meat flavor. Very juicy with perfectly crisp tater tots. But keep in mind they charge extra for tots on weekends. My daughter got the chicken sandwich which was so good she wouldn't even share a bite. They have Tennessee hot chicken which sadly we did not order.", "author": "Ben K."}

Unfortunately, the Wes Burger was gristly, hard to chew and greasy. I ordered the potato salad, which was kind of tasty, but a little too much heat. I may try the fried chicken another time, but will likely stay away from the burgers. I too think it was a bit pricey for a burger and potato salad $16.", "author": "Laurie U."}

Act cool when you get in like you know whats going on. Dont look at the menu either cuz then you wont look like you know whats going on. See those draft beers. Decide which one you want. Then there will be this cat at the register. Real nice guy, dont let the crazy tatoos throw you off. Now tell him the beer you want and a Wes Burger and your name. Dont forget your name. Go sit and wait for your name to be called.\n\nI think you got it from here you little hipster ;)", "author": "Cram M."}

The people in front of me got their burgers and sides in 25 minutes (eating in) wth!  The burger was good, patty hand made, juicy, and the tots were fresh. It satisfied my burger craving but I have had better for the price, and better service overall. Nice decor, and drink selection. Maybe I'll try it again for dine in.", "author": "Wayne T."}

A bunch of us went there for the soft opening a couple of weeks ago and it was the same juicy, heavenly goodness we'd already come to love, only with more options than usual. Ambience is low key and comfortable, rather than overly hip and offputting, perfect for wes burger. You can bet I'll be there often.", "author": "Evan S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-03-06", "description": "Well that was disappointing. \n$10 and 40 minutes for the most pedestrian/bland burger I have had since grade school. The meat itself was decent and had a nice salty crust to it, but there was absolutely nothing else remarkable about this burger. Iceberg lettuce, raw white onion, dripping with a flavorless remoulade that was 95% mayonaise. ...and when I asked that my burger be cooked \"medium\" instead of \"medium rare\" the cook rolled his eyes and smirked \"pfft, I will try\"...shockingly enough, he was able to pull off this incredibly difficult stunt.\nThe 40 minute wait was due to the fact that...and yes, I am quoting here... \"the cook only cooks them 5 at a time, so You have to wait until more are ordered before he will cook yours\" \nI will not be returning.", "author": "Jason B."}
