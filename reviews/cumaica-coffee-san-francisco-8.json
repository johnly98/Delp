BUT every time I am in this coffee shop I always receive great customer service and decent (on busy days) to amazing in awe (nonbusy days) quality cups of coffee or hot chocolate. \n\nIt's the first coffee shop open when I get here around 5 am to start setting up for the farmers market and it stays open until I leave around 2 pm. So I know I will be able to go back and get refills on quality coffee while I'm working. \n\nThe shop is small, but clean. Limited seating and space due to the small shop size but the tables and bars are actually set up strategically to maximize the little space they have. \n\nI would compare the pricing to that of Starbucks. It is a little pricey, but hey it's San Francisco. \n\nAmbiance is more of a grab and go type of coffee shop and yes!

I asked the barista if I should have the matcha latte or chai she said matcha is very good, so I ordered it.. once I took my first sip it was still chunky powder and did not taste good. I went up to her and said this drink isn't for me I don't like it may I get another drink. I got the iced chai.. and they charged me for it. So I had to pay for two drinks and only drank one. \n\nI've worked in service industry for a while and if someone only took one sip and didn't like your recommendation, I don't see why you would have to pay for another drink.. $10 later I have my small iced chai.

I also didn't know it was an offshoot of the local Martha & Bros chain. Apparently the original owners thought the brand needed a splooge of marketing pizzazz since I frankly agree that the folksy name is probably too vintage for the caffeinated hipsters who they want to attract. I've been to the Cumaica closer to my home in SoMa just a couple of times because Blue Bottle, Coffee Cultures, and even Peet's draw my attention more, and all are just a few yards away from each other at 10th and Mission.\n\nThis Cumaica has the benefit of having a more prominent location on Clement in the more family-friendly Inner Richmond where Blue Danube appears to be its closest competition. My impression was the same as the Mission location - friendly service and middling drip coffee at a good price - $2 for a Medium House Blend (photo: http://bit.ly/2NuZjzn). The counter was overwhelmed with baked items under glass (photo: http://bit.ly/2CDqrIp) though for my money, I'd rather walk up to Ariscault and get one of their amazing croissants. The seating is somewhat sparse in here, but there is a welcome parklet right outside the door.\n\nCOFFEE - 3 stars...if you need decent coffee, they have it\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...well-kept though somewhat claustrophobic, the parklet provides relief\nSERVICE - 4 stars...where they excel\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Martha, I hardly knew ya\n\nRELATED - Looking for a cup of coffee in a caf\u00e9?

(I'm a steadfast drinker of Sumatra and similar beans.) Nice, clean interior. Latin music flowing throughout.  If there was anything I'd change it would be to have open WiFi rather than a connection time based upon how much you've spent. What pushes this place above 3 stars is the service. When I walked in it was just such a happy, welcoming place. It's like walking into Cheers. It's obvious this place has many regulars who are known by the staff.  I put my food and coffee on a small table and realized that I needed napkins. As I approached the counter one of the staff caught my eye and say, \"Oh, napkins are over there.\"  I sat back down and wondered if there was free WiFi, and the WiFi login said I could get a code on my receipt, which I had earlier declined to take. So, I walked back to the counter and asked the same staff person, \"What am I thinking now?\" He goes to the register, and prints out a receipt.  I tip no matter what, but these guys made it worth it.", "author": "Jason G."}

Overtime it seems like everything has been getting bad. Quality of coffee AND service. Up until today I was willing to close my eyes on the very crappy service and rude employees to still be able to get my white mochas, but today just did it for me. First my drink was nowhere near hot. It wasn't even warm and this has happened before where they didn't have the patience to heat up the milk for long enough and tried to give me an attitude when I asked if it could be a little hotter. When the same thing happened today, first the barista gave me an attitude. Then she asked me if my coffee was hot enough after heating it up for about 10 secs, when my answer was no again, she rolled her eyes and proceeded to PUT MY DRINK IN THE MICROWAVE!!!! WHY WOULD I WALK TO A COFFEE SHOP, PAY FOR MY COFFEE, ONLY TO HAVE IT MICROWAVED?!?  I am beyond myself.
