I wanted to check out the Mission District for some of their world famous taco joints and this place did not disappoint. \n\nWe sat at the bar and started out with an order of chips, guacamole and salsa. Delicious! The bartender was great and help us pick out our cocktails. We tried the La Bot\u00e1nica- volc\u00e1n blanco, blackberry, thyme, lime and agave, and the La Penca Verde- el silencio mezcal, pineapple, green chartreuse, lime and agave. Both were delish, but La Botanica was my favorite! \n\nFor food we did a four street tacos platter. We tried the Baja-style pacific cod, Pastrami taco, Traditional carnitas and the Skirt steak carne asada taco. All were so tasty, but the traditional carnitas and the skirt steak were the faves. I also love that they were served with four small dishes of salsas and onions. \n\nI hope to go back the next time I'm in SF!", "author": "Emily G."}

They have been busy both times, and both times service was painfully slow. This is based on wait time from being seated to greeted by server (over 5 mins), asking the bussers for water and chips after 5 mins w/o service, then drinks come out with the food because the bar is slammed too. Then getting the check is another whole process. Server was nice/friendly but that's not enough to make up for the wait times. Adding another bartender and server during peak times would fix this. \n\nBut you come here for the food and drinks. And the drinks are on point with a huge tequila collection.

Oh....\n\nAnyways, we moved on to the main course of the meal which was the tacos!!!! $42 for 10 tacos, not toooooo shabby of a deal. They have great vegetarian options!!! My favorite taco was the fish tacos and it came with some pickled onion on the side. The avocado would've been a top contender but holy cow was that spicy. It was DOUSED in chili powder. The top of it was bright red from all that seasoning. I legit could not breathe for a second after eating it.  \n\nOverall Impression: I think I'd definitely return for a hang out spot and margarita carafes before a night of going out.

I have come several times the past few years and now it seems like everything has changed for the worse. \n\nFirst off, this used to be my go-to place for a spicy margarita and the Pasion was my favorite; I always ordered it asking for it to be not too sweet and in a carafe so that I could share with several friends and we'd have a couple rounds. This past time, I asked not too sweet and the waiter was confused on how that could be made, nonetheless less he put in my order and it came out so wrong. It basically tasted like a screwdriver; all orange juice and no passion fruit, absolutely no spice, and one carafe only gave me and two of my friends one round - it would have been cheaper to order three drinks separately! If the taste wasn't bad enough, the value really drew the last straw. \n\nIn terms of food, the menu seems to change items each time I go, so I can't count on there being something I wanted to try last time as still on the menu to order.

Recently, I brought my cousin here as we saw their happy hour menu and wanted a drink and tacos. \n\nThe hostess took us to a table towards the back and my cousin asked if we could be seated more towards the front instead due to those seats having a cushion on the bench vs no cushion where we were being directed to. Hostess told us no bc it was a table for 4. Then my cousin asked about another table in the same area, and again, \"no bc it's for 4\". Please note that they were set up for 4 people, but there were actually two tables that could be split to seat 2 different parties (of 2).\n\nWhen asked why the tables couldn't be separated to accommodate our request due to wanting a more comfortable seat, hostess  was irritated and finally gave in. Meanwhile, our to-be server came over during half the exchange and just watched the last bit of this. My cousin was literally asking for comfort and being in the restaurant industry herself,  was very confused as to why the hostess was making her request so difficult and didn't care to be accommodating, especially after saying that her back was bothering her and the non-cushioned seats would make it worse. \n\nWell long story short, our server couldn't have been more rude. We had absolutely no qualms with her (and actually, non with the hostess either - my cousin was just stating she didn't want to be uncomfortable). When I asked for straws, she rolled her eyes and gave us a fake smile. I was shocked especially since I'd been quiet throughout pretty much the whole time. She comes back HOLDING THE TIPS OF THE STRAWS in her fingers. She did not bother grabbing a napkin. That is disgusting bc I'm expected to put that in my mouth or in my drink? Then she forgot to add in an order because when we asked, she said it was coming and clearly it was not because it was an appetizer and we were already eating our main dishes. \n\nNow, at this point I thought she was being rude to only us because of what she saw earlier. That is until the couple next to me tried to get her attention and she rudely snapped back. The lady next to me looked at me shocked and I said, oh so apparently you are also having trouble getting good  service today? She and I then started talking about how crappy it feels to go to an overpriced taco joint and have to practically beg to be serviced. \n\nI did not care much for my drink, but it was happy hour and it's alcohol, so I drank it. The food was fine. But when you have a sour experience like this, it's difficult to enjoy your meal. I wanted to leave several times while seated and trying to enjoy my time with cousin. \n\nThis is the last time I visit this place. It has unfortunately become overly pretentious for my taste.

I need to put it in now.\" Completely monotone and annoyed that he had to even be in our vicinity. Would it have killed him to say, \"Hey guys can I get you anything else today - happy hour is just about over.\" We had been waiting to order but he didn't ever come back to ask until that point. We had already ordered dip + drinks, and had our chips refilled by someone else because that's how long he was away.\n\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, instead of stopping to ask how our food was he would just come and stand at our table and stare at one of us.\n\nI realize it's pretty common for servers to dislike happy hour and the patrons who participate but it's literally your only job to serve the customer and be kind - get over yourselves or get a new job. I'm a generous tipper when it's deserved but not when treated as if I'm a problem in your afternoon.\n\nA side note, they changed the salsa recipe in the last month according to my very rude server who didn't care to elaborate on the topic.

I guess I like things fairly traditional, at least when it comes to Mexican fare. When I first started coming here it was because everything was delicious AND they mixed it up (think really crazy margaritas/tequila cocktails and fried avocado tacos). But were not too far out there (at least from what I remember). There was always a mix of new and traditional and there were always offerings to keep meat eaters and vegetarians alike happy. That part (a spectrum of offerings) is still true. The potato taco looked incredibly delicious and my mushroom (and fried avocado!!!) were delicious. The y still make a fine margarita and the holy trinity dip sampler (with guacamole, chile con queso, and refried beans) is also very good. They do guacamole particularly well. I also like the house salsa. It's on the thicker side (which I love) and has a nice smoky flavor. Everything was fine and I enjoyed it, but nothing seems to stand out much anymore. I'm not sure I should fault them for not being as exciting as they used to be. On the upside, the service is pretty good (at least until you are ready to leave. It can take a while).

First lets get the cost out of the way. Yes, each taco is $4.95 each. Yes, for a taco. Should you care? ...NO. Just do it. Just allow yourself to drift slowly into taco heaven and think about the bill later. \n\nMy favorite tacos:\nChicken chile verde\nCarnitas\nGuajillo-braised beef (probably #1)\nSkirt steak carne asada\n(they are all good - but the meat is just so good I usually stick to these)\n\nSalsa - they have 3 homemade salsas they give you (red, green and habanero. I am obsessed with the habanero. It's not burn your face off hot or anything but it is slightly sweet and brings a considerable amount of heat. \n\nSalad - GET THE MARINA GIRL SALAD. It's in the top 5 salads I've ever eaten in my life. The homemade vinaigrette they put on it is out of this world. You can get it either with chicken or without. If I'm having only a salad I'll get chicken, but I've you're doing tacos I would skip the chicken. The salad is so delicious you won't miss the chicken.  \n\nMargaritas - just as good as the tacos. Every single cocktail on the menu is to die for. I usually do get a pitcher of the house margaritas and keep it simple but I've tried all of the other cocktails and they are all delicious. They are made with top quality ingredients and you can taste the difference. \n\nAtmosphere - there is a cute patio that holds maybe 30 people? It has an amazing mural of the entire Mission that is beautiful to have in the background. The inside is really cute and extremely well decorated. Even the dishes and utensils are trendy and beautiful. I believe the owner handpicks all of the decor and utensils,etc. \n\nLocal tips - there is a sister bar called Mosto that is adjoined to the restaurant that also serves tacos, but they only have one kind. If the restaurant is too busy, you can pop next door and grab a cocktail or have a tequila flight while you wait for your table. They have a large selection of tequila. Another tip that I'm hiding at the bottom of my review because I don't want to be banned from taco heaven is that I usually cheat and get two tacos and turn them into 4 tacos. Each taco comes with a ton of meat and two tortillas so I usually just quickly shuffle them around into 4 tacos. \n\nThe best part is there are multiple Tacolicious locations so I can run all over San Francisco and not go tacolicious-less.", "author": "Juliet S."}

Man, was I disappointed to see they got rid of the pan con chocolat\u00e9! I haven't eaten here for some time, so I don't know how long it's been since they made the change. I asked one of the bartenders about when it was removed and his tone was a bit condescending: \"Well...let's see...I've been here for about 5-6 years sooo...hmm...some time ago!\". Thanks, BRO! I've made quite a few visits to your joint during that time frame and have seen it on the menu sooo...yeah. \n\nRegardless, I decided to order some tacos and gave their churros a try. The tacos were solid, but the churro dessert just didn't do it for me. Maybe this was due to my heart being set on the pan con chocolat\u00e9, but still...it wasn't anything special.\n\nAside from being disappointed in the churros, the service was a little lagging, as well. This was a Tuesday evening and I was sitting at the bar with about 3-4 empty seats around me, so it wasn't like the bar was hella busy. My water was empty and it seemed like the bartender(s) looked my way a couple times without offering a refill. Finally, I got a refill after asking. \n\nOnce I was finished with everything, I sat there for about 10 minutes without any acknowledgement or even an offer to take anything away. Mind you, the bartenders were both behind the bar cleaning up and taking drink orders from other folks who were arriving.

I loved the open windows, open concept of the kitchen so you can see them prepare and cook the food. I also liked the nice touch of the glass water jugs and thick, soft napkins. Def a 5/5 for decor, ambiance, and utensils/table decor. \n\nAs soon as we were seated we were given menus and upon ordering We had a generous size of mild salsa and chips for us to snack on. The chips and salsa were ok, nice crisp to the chip, but overall pretty standard, but nice touch. We ordered 4 tacos for $17.95, which I originally thought was pretty pricy. I had the \"Baja style\" pacific cod tacos and braised beef short ribs. Our tacos came with 3 different salsas mild, medium, hot. I wish I had remembered what was in it, but all of them had their own distinct flavor, all very tasty as it complemented the tacos well. Note the hot is not that spicy. \n\n- Baja style pacific cod: overall it was lightly battered, moist, and very flavorful. It wasn't as crispy as I like my fried fish tacos, but maybe it was because I waited too long after I squeezed my line over it prior to my first bite. Despite that the crunch of the slaw with the magical sauce they used made this taco very tasty. \n\n-braised beef short ribs: I wasn't sure how I would feel about this one, but after my first bite I knew I was in love. The meat was moist, tender, and very flavorful. I really enjoyed it. \n\nThis hipster joint has done something right, with the great ambiance, fresh and delicious food, along with great service.

My favorites were the cod (very crispy) and the beef braised short rib, and my boyfriend enjoyed the chorizo. All the tacos went great with the three types of salsas they provided, though I thought that the yellow one they called the \"spicy\" wasn't all that spicy. The carnitas taco could have been more moist, but overall, everything tasted great.\n\nA big plus that I thought offset the higher cost of the tacos is the unlimited fresh chips and salsa!

Tacolicious does not disappoint when it comes to flavors and variety. I thoroughly enjoyed every bite and wished I ordered more! \n\nThis is also a cocktail bar, so a great choice for a date night or happy hour with friends. The indoor vibe is chill--super dark inside with good music playing. There's also an outdoor area with cute string lights at night. \n\nThe drink menu looked really good, and has a ton of delicious options. We tried the Pas\u00edon as recommended by our waiter which sounded really good - passionfruit, habenero, and tequila. But....wow...the habenero just really crept up on me and made each sip incredibly difficult. Would definitely go for a different, more refreshing drink next time. \n\nI also tried two different tacos. Fish taco was amazing, very light and crispy with fresh salsa and pico de gallo. The potato chorizo taco was my favorite though, I could probably eat a million of those.\n\nThe tacos also came with three different dipping sauces/salsas to sample which I really enjoyed. This place doesn't disappoint when it comes to fresh ingredients and flavors. \n\nWill definitely be coming back here or trying out another location whenever I'm nearby a tacolicious! :)", "author": "Sara S."}

There are too many good Mexican food spots in this city to waste any time having an average experience, so I likely won't be back. \nThe food was good, but not great. Nothing foodwise stands out to me when thinking back on the experience. In fact, I couldn't even tell you which tacos I ordered, which goes to show how forgettable they were. \nBut what really made the experience lackluster was that our waitress acted like she didn't want to be there. She'd come by and only wait on one table at a time and ignore the rest, so we were left sitting with empty drinks throughout the meal and had to wait 20 minutes before being able to order. I'm always annoyed when I have to flag down a server. You're nearby checking on a table, why not look around and check on the others while you're there?

Kale was cooked well. Overall every component needed more seasoning.\n\nI'm just theorizing here, but perhaps the lack of seasoning is due to the fact that the salsa was supposed to make up for lack of flavor on the actual tacos itself? Because those sauces were BOMB. The yellow one was my absolute favorite-spicy and full of flavor! The brown one had a delightful smokey flavor and the green one had great texture and freshness.\n\nThe oversized side of chips with salsa & guacamole also had redeeming qualities. Fresh, seasoned well, and just really good.\n\nSo...the name may not be true in my case. The Tacos weren't very delicious. But everything was.

I didn't mind the wait, we arrived at 11,  thinking it'd be a great place to grab drinks and late night dinner. The hostess says nothing, there seem to be 3 of them, three people doing the same job poorly. \n \nEventually we get seated, ready to eat and grab some drinks to start the night. Around 10-15 minutes later the waiter arrives to greet us with \"So you know the bar did last call already yes?\" \nUh no, the 3 hosts failed to mention that MINOR detail during our wait. And you're JUST now conveniently arriving after the fact.  He proceeds to take our order and I tell him we need another minute or so. At this point we are kind of  wondering why the hell we would do $40 tacos for two here if we can't even get a damn drink to go with it. Could easily go to one of the 20 taquerias in the surrounding area for better tasting food. \n\nSo I look up online that their next door bar is still open and ask the waiter about it. He tells us yeah we can bring the drinks over so I think okay we'll stay.(why did he not mention this before) \n\nSo we barely make it to last call, get drinks over, waiter comes back it's like 11:40 at this point and he's  like \"cheers! you got drinks! Just so you know I have to take the drinks away from everyone at midnight\" \n\n???? \nSo now we are chugging our drinks, through brain freeze, starvation and annoyance we wait for our tacos to arrive. The food is fine. Mediocre overpriced New Age San Francisco style tacos. \n\nOur remaining drinks are promptly snatched at 11:59pm. We finish up eating and ask for the bill. It takes FOREVER. At this point there are exactly 6 people in the restaurant still dining including us 2. He brings us the bill finally, disappears and we put the credit card down. After it's been about 10 minutes I look around for him and notice he's been engaged in deep philosophical convo with another guy dining for over 10 minutes. At no point  does it cross his mind I guess to do his job and then finish the conversation. But we wait patiently for several minutes while he has his deep life changing conversation on the clock. \n\nWhen he FINALLY collects the check, we've barely gathered our things and called our ride when the other host or whoever, a blond dude in glasses comes over to our table and says \"I'm sorry guys but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave now\"\n\nAs IF we've been sitting here after dining for 20 minutes FOR FUN! As if we were drinking our drinks, chatting it up and hanging out! As if their entire staff is competing to see who could offer the worst customer service experience!

What a deal!!!\n\nGreat place to get the night going with that $10 deal, as far as the tacos go this is another hipster taco joint which a lot of their tacos have their own twist.  In my opinion however, even though I would come back, these tacos are overpriced, sure they're ok however  they're inconsistent, I've got them too rich (in terms of saltiness) or I've also got them slightly dry.\n\nServers often give different info, last time I was able to get a different taco instead of the chicken one with the beer shot and taco deal for a few bucks more, while yesterday chicken was the only taco I could get.\n\nI would go back, however there's plenty of places with better tacos in the mission.", "author": "Josh Giosue D."}

We also had the house margaritas. You can always tell when they use fresh juice and this one was not a mix for sure, a nice balance of tart and sweet.

At one end there was a small group that was there with a guy who was getting married the next day and they were having a good time. We sent them over the margarita frescas chupitos which is a group of 4 shots, which are really small versions of the margarita. They seemed to enjoy those as they broke into song not long after. Fun vibe on a Thursday! The bartender made a killer margarita and paloma which I like as much as a margarita. I had the regular 'rita and the Fillmore paloma. \nTo eat we all shared the chili con queso, chicken tacos, dorados al charo, cauliflower side, fried plantains side and the Marina Girl salad, which is listed under snacks but not sure why. I think that salad was my favorite which was the thing I ordered and mostly ate. It was big enough for a meal for sure.

The restaurant is cute, small, and in keeping with a similar vibe/feel of other restaurants around Valencia. Our waitress was polite, informative and patient enough when we took a little longer to decide what we wanted.\n\nOur teenage boys ordered chilaquiles based on the recommendation of their mother (me). My husband ordered ___?___, and I ordered the Baja style fish tacos.\n\nAt first glance, the chilaquiles looked like a plate of nachos sans cheese with a fried egg on top. My boys weren't complaining but mom was a bit judgy over their interpretation of chilaquiles. The only saving grace about those nach--chilaquiles, were the tasty chips...but we had already gone through a basket and a half of those, so no one was too excited over the bed of chips that arrived masquerading as a meal.\n\nMy husband's meal was much smaller but took the form of orange and green spice mush. He couldn't even get through his soupy, non-textured food. He grabbed a few chips from my boys' plates, since there was much to spare, but still, so disappointing.\n\nThen, after about a five minute wait after my kids' and husband's meal arrived, came my beautiful fish tacos! They were pleasing to the eye but that is about the only thing they were pleasing to. I've never known a taco to be gag-worthy, but these were. First, the crema that is typically served on a fish taco, had no more flavor than a spoonful of mayonnaise. Second, and worst of all, the batter that was used to batter the fish, was similar to a donut or funnel cake batter. You wouldn't think that would make a huge difference but it did and without the presence of any other flavors but mayonnaise and funnel cake batter, my instant reaction was gag. I tried to dress it up with lime and the lovely platter of salsa and sauces that accompanied the tacos, but nothing helped--the batter aftertaste was so dominant, it left me nauseous. I ordered two but only managed to get through one. I HATE wasting food but I couldn't stomach the rest, nor could I even bring myself to pass it off to a homeless friend on the street. \n\nSo disappointing. If you're looking for good tacos or some semblance of Mexican, choose one of the other longstanding spots here in the mission. There is no shortage of them and you'd likely be guaranteeing a future for those restaurants that the Mission is so loved for.", "author": "Crystal M."}

I typically judge Mexican restaurants right off the bat for their quality in chips and salsa; for this, they passed the test. Then, as per suggestion by a very friendly waiter named Ryan, I ordered 4 tacos: carnitas, braised short rib, chorizo and potatoes, and fried pacific cod.

They need to add either more variety or change the menu with some seasonal takes. It's the same exact menu from 3 years ago. \n\nI like the marina girl salad, the short rib tacos and their shredded chicken tacos.

Tacolicious has a good variety of different tacos, they let you mix and match to create your own platter, and they give you a hefty amount of filling. The Baja-style cod was the standout for me since the fish had a very light batter on it, but I found the meat tacos to be a little dry. The salsa has a mint-y note to it that I wasn't a fan of as well, though I can't really complain since chips and salsa are on the house, haha. \n\nLike others have said, the service is spotty here. We, along with other tables, had difficulty flagging down our waitress to order, get the bill, etc. Because of this we didn't even bother asking someone to explain the accompanying sauces to us, and we didn't even try to replace the serving scoop that was missing from one of our sauces. My take away: come here for the hip ambiance, to experience tacos with a modern twist, oh and for that pretty instagram picture of your food ;)", "author": "Caralisa L."}

We sat on the patio on this lovely day and yet they had the heaters going. The place was pretty packed and so the wait staff seemed a bit overwhelmed. We ordered some tequila and beer and it took a long while to get. The table behind who sat after we did and got their drinks and food before us. A different waitress took our order. Then original waitress tried to take our order. The guacamole looked small in the bowl but it was actually rather large for the two of us. The chips were too wonderful. \n\nThe rest of the food came out relatively quickly. They put my short rib taco on the same plate as Sara's fish taco so definitely some meat cross contamination. Both tacos were great and thus the four star rating. The taco themselves were simple: warm double layer of corn tortillas filled respectively with beef, onion, and cilantro & fish, cabbage, and white sauce. The beef was juicy, tender, and packed with tastiness. The fish was crunchy in the outside and flaky on the inside. The yellow habanero-like sauce was muy spicy. The red molcajete salsa was my favorite. The consistency and depth of flavor was spot on. The green tomatillo salsa was decent. It took a while to get our check and run the credit card. \n\n\nOverall, great food, fun atmosphere, but lackluster service.", "author": "Leonard L."}

We went in for a few happy hour items and sat at a table in the middle, we were \"greeted\" by one server who threw down the menus and then abruptly walked away. We waited for about 10 minutes for some stale bits of crushed chip to arrive from another woman, then another 5 minutes for a different server who asked if we'd been helped and then proceeded to take our order which was a couple of happy hour tacos, some guacamole and 2 margaritas. Another few minutes and the original server who greeted us comes up and asks if we're ready to order.. we replied that we already had but we were sorry if we were supposed to order from him, he said absolutely nothing, looked visibly agitated, grabbed our menus and oddly stormed away.. We shook it off as a miscommunication and continued to wait for our order. It took another 15-20 minutes for even the guacamole to make it out, no margaritas yet, then the tacos arrived and were so pitifully constructed, the generic square plastic cheese they used hadn't melted all the way. After getting through our less than satisfying tacos and half the guac we still had not received our drinks so we asked the second server if they were still coming and 5 minutes later finally received them. Though they were more of a post meal drink, they were delicious however we were in a bit of a hurry so at that point we had to basically chug them and try to flag someone down for the check. 10 minutes later we are forced to ask the original rude server bc he was the only one we could find and he once again looked obviously irritated, responded with a \"sure\" and abrasive lot grabbed the plates on our table without asking if we were finished. We waited another 5 to receive our check when we handed him the card preemptively and he stormed off again...

I called on Thursday to make a reservation for a party of 15 on Sunday at 8 (post dinner rush hours). I explained that we didn't want to do their prix fixed menu, because we would prefer to order off of the main menu. The gentleman on the phone said that we could just do a walk in on Sunday and they will accommodate us. I also had an email exchange with a Brielle about us walking in, and she said \"Sounds good! We look forward to having you.\" We show up, and almost immediately get turned away. Mind you, it's pouring rain and freezing outside, so I basically told the host to try again, because I was told otherwise. Thankfully they said they would \"set us up in the back\". Said back was FREEZING! They only set us up for about 10, so I ended up connecting the tables together and setting up myself. The bar was rude and never so much as acknowledged us the TWO TIMES we stood in front of them. My friends food never came out despite having told the waitress that he was skipped up. The tacos are almost $5 a piece and not at all worth it! My tortillas were cold, the meat was dry and stringy, and resembled your average street taco. I've had way better tacos for $1 out of a mom and pop food truck! We spent almost $600 and they refused to split the check not even once. No one was ever rude from my party and we ate and drank merrily in honor of our departure- without a single complaint. However, on our way out my wife and I said thank you, and I heard one of the male staff sarcastically say \"Thanks for calling!\" And I walked back and told them that whomever said that was extremely rude! We could've easily spent our money elsewhere, and we should've. Thankfully for my wonderful chosen family we had a great time despite the horrible service and mediocre overpriced food. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TACO DOLLARS HERE. \n\nOne last thing... My friend who never got his food- I accommodated to the taco shop down the street, where he devoured his hot juicy tacos quickly while I watched in envy to the tune of $8. Be ashamed of yourselves.

We were feeling rather ravenous and had planned to eat at Cha-Ya until we discovered that they were closed :( time for a backup plan! We looked across the street at Tacolicious and said hey let's check it out.\n\nWe didn't realize that the nice looking restaurant across the street was Tacolicious until we received our menus. I was very excited because I had heard great things about the food. This past summer I attempted to try the tacos at Outside Lands, but they were sold out! Sad times. Anyways, the two of us shared an order of four tacos (two each) and a kale salad. I had a butternut squash and a chicken mole, while my friend went with a butternut squash and cod. We both loved the salad and enjoyed our tacos. We agreed that our least favorite was the butternut squash, perhaps it was too spicy for our taste? I generally love squash so I was a bit surprised that it was our least favorite. We also ordered cocktails because a celebratory drink was needed (not sure if that is recommended post tattoo though haha.) Overall everything was delicious!\n\nI'm so happy that we ended up wandering into Tacolicious. I loved the food and I will definitely return and possibly venture off to explore their other locations. They have loads of options whether you are vegan, veg, gluten free, etc. If you decide to give them a try I highly recommend the kale salad, which was my favorite dish of the evening, and chicken/cod tacos.

(in order of preference.)\n-Beef short rib (yum-o!! So tasty/flavorful and juicy)\n-Traditional carnitas  (very good, not dry at all)\n-House made chorizo (on the salty side)\n-Pacific cod (least favorite... I guess compared to the others, there wasn't very much taste)\n\nWe also ordered the plantains and a side of beans. Didn't remember much about it.\nFor desert,  we tried the churros. They were just okay. The dipping sauce they came with was kinda grainy and reminded me of Nestle Quick mix. It should have been smooth and creamy, in my opinion.\n\nOur table also went thru 3 pitchers of margaritas. It was a little on the pricey side, but after consuming all the savory meats, a cold margarita paired well with the food.\n\nI loved the green sauce they served (as I do at any Mexican joint that serves it) and could have probably used at least a few more servings of it.\n\nOverall, I agree with some of the reviews in that it's overpriced.

They don't have very many tables that can accommodate a large party with high chairs. So we were seated in a large booth and kind of had to trap the 2 toddlers in between adults. (No booster seats either) I understand the area is not exactly filled with families and children so I get that not every restaurant is going to have accommodations for children. \n\nSo it takes about 5 minutes for the server to come up to us once we are seated, no big deal, large parties usually take a while to get situated. She approaches the table with a blank stare and says \"what do you want to drink?\" Very unfriendly and appeared to be annoyed right off the bat. After taking our order she disappears until the end of our meal. No one pre bussed the table and we had plates all over the table and I had to stop a hostess and ask her to take the stack of plates off our table before we accidentally knocked them to the ground.\n\nThe server also says they do not split checks... That's extremely annoying and incredibly presumptuous to assume someone will always pay for everyone.\nI found out that they are willing to split the amount on different credit cards but they won't split the actual items on separate checks... causing the party to have to figure out prices, tax, fees, for each bill. Incredibly obnoxious because I could see they were using Aloha, a system that EASILY allows for splitting checks. So either our waitress was just lazy or they actually have a ridiculous rule that they aren't allowed to split checks for large parties even though their system allows for it...either way, bad customer service.\n\nThe food was great.  Tuna Tostada was awesome. The house salsa has mint in it, different but good. The house margarita was not too sweet- very refreshing.\n\nIf you're a party of more than 2 and you have a child with you, skip this place.\n\nEven though the food was good, I still won't return, they don't seem to care about accommodating large parties or children.", "author": "Sarah L."}

I'm not sure we were treated this way, we were all very nice to him and treated him with respect,  but I guess he was too arrogant to care. I certainly do not think it was worth the money. The bill came out to be $100.00 for a few tacos, for a table of 4, and not everybody ordered drinks. I will certainly not be back. There are plenty of other places near by, that offer great quality food and will treat you with more respect than this place.", "author": "Juliana D."}

Came here today for lunch around 2:30pm and it was one of the HOTTEST days so far in San Francisco this year. This place was boiling hot and the restaurant is completely ill-equipped to handle hot weather. There are absolutely no fans or air conditioning inside or outside and all of the staff were hot and sweaty as was I and everyone else there. Upon entering there was no one at the front to seat us so we waited for about 5 minutes or so for someone to walk over. We asked to sit outside and were told there would be a wait because the tables needed to be cleaned even though there were 2 available empty tables outside. The girl left and we waited for another 10 minutes to be seated at one of the same tables we noticed were already empty and clean. We waited another 15 mins or so for chips/salsa and to place our orders. We had to ask for ice for the warm water that was on our table and another 30 minutes for the check after I flagged down ANOTHER waitress for it.

I was always curious to see what Tacolicious was like? My experience was actually great!\n\nWe ordered an assortment of ten tacos with the works for about $40. It is a bit pricey but each taco really is worth it. The quality of the meat and ingredients is up there; it's fresh, colorful, clean, and tasty. My two favorites were the original carnitas and the filet mignon with grilled onions. These were no joke. The carnitas were tender, easy, and has that traditional taste. The filet mignon taco was outrageous! there had to be at least 5-6 cubes of thick steak in one taco. The steak was cooked medium rare and was super juicy.\n\nThe complimentary chips were great tasting too. I think the chips were whole grain tortillas with pinches of sea salt on top. The salsa was spicy & sweet at the same time due to the mango blend inside. \n\nOverall, I had a great experience. It was a sunny day in the early noon, lots of people dining in and eating outside, imported beer and taco pairing, etc.. couldn't beat it! These tacos were delicious!

The expected wait was 45 minutes, and I was definitely putting our name down way too early, but they told me to just check in when everyone got there so I figured it would work out well.\n\nWell, our group started arriving at 8pm and we didn't get sat until around 8:40pm! Everyone had had at least one drink while hanging out next door at Mosto. They gave us the long table along the window at the very front, which was a table for 8 (so it was too much space). I guess the lesson is it's going to be a wait no matter what for a large group - it's a small space and seems to be mostly set up for smaller groups.\n\nThey are super busy so the service was mixed, between kind of rushing us to make an order, and when we weren't ready immediately, not taking our order for a long time.

The plantains were very soft and sweet, and the mixture of 2 layers of dip it was sitting in (I think sour cream and refried bean paste of some sort) were a great combo.\n\n* Fish taco - 4 stars\nProbably one of their best ones! You get a huge piece of cod, and the breading is very lightly crisped. The meat is chunky and hearty. Good, simple quality. \n\n* Potato Chorizo taco - 3 stars\nI was excited to try this after gone with the veggie taco over this one last time (and regretted it). However, besides the fact that this one has meat, it's not all that amazing. There was very little meat compared to all their other tacos, and it's a bit too salty. I also found the chorizo to be overcooked and hard, almost crisped to a point that you couldn't really taste the meat itself.\n\nFish + Potato Chorizo tacos: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tacolicious-san-francisco-7?select=UCPEf4mcmkrw0fXwKP1SqA#UCPEf4mcmkrw0fXwKP1SqA\n\n* Braised Beer Chicken - 3 stars\nI tried a bite of this and thought it was pretty good pulled chicken, but it was drenched too much in sauce.

As a food and service experience, not so much.\n\nThis vibrant, bustling urban taco shop in the heart of Valencia has a beautiful interior and exterior (cafe seating) lots of attractive waitresses and clientele, sleepy urban dogs tethered outside and on average a half hour wait (you'll be told 15 minutes, but count on it being longer).  It's a Mission destination, and it's pretty hard not to want to stop here when you walk by and see the frenetic activity.  The line seems to tell you this is a spot worth waiting for.\n\nHowever, we found the tacos just a-okay. The more creative offerings being their short rib taco (stewed and tender but heavy) and a homey chorizo and potato taco. While I agree, there is something perfect about a business focused on bread and meat, the thing about Tacolicious is the product doesn't really live up to expectations.  \n\nWe found the tacos small and importantly the tortillas they are served on really do not taste freshmade, which could make a big difference when a product contains so few ingredients. (The good news is that the complementary chips and salsa do, thankfully.)  The ingredients inside their various tacos (with the exception maybe of the short rib) are fairly straight forward and uninspired. For example, my special of the day shrimp taco had a nice sauce but the shrimp were small and tasted fishy. The fish taco was missing that something something, e.g. more creative toppings or the perfect sauce. All tacos are about $5, which is a bit steep for a tiny taco in the Mission, where tacos are otherwise pretty much falling from the sky. Service-wise too our experience was fairly chaotic, with several dishes not arriving, (as in \"your order went into the kitchen and did not come out out alive\") and a server rarely being around after something didn't show up at the table.  We had to ask to get what we needed, so we made friends with the busboys, who helped us sort out our dishes. Well, eventually.\n\nSure, the vibe is urban fabulous. Its a see and be scene taco spot, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's just that foodwise and service wise, it can be a bumpy ride.", "author": "Rachel H."}

As you start walking to the door, you can see people sitting outdoor, i assume people could outdoor too. But my cousins and i just sat inside...high wooden tables and high chairs. Its has bar and can see the cookers cooking your food from where you are sitting\n\nAs i was looking, all the food choices look really good. Prices on the tacos are base on how many tacos you eat and if you go in group which are: 1 taco is $3.95, 4 tacos are $14, and 10 tacos are $33. Of course that your typical restaurant price which is a pricier than the food truck. They do give you chips and salsa before your food comes out.\n\nDecided to get the traditional carnitas and braise bbq beef (you would definitely need a lot of napkin for the braise beef since it has a lot of sauce in the taco and a bit oily as well). The tortilla of the taco was dry. It has a lot of flavor. It can get you full depending how many tacos you get. There are three type of sauces to go with your tacos but forgot the name, only remember the color: yellow(has that tangy spiciness to), and the red and green are more sweeter and mild flavor sauce.\n\nFriendly staff.

Even though I've had really delicious beef tacos before (Blockheads in NYC). My friend got a fish taco and that looked delicious. But their prices for tacos (about $5 for 1, $18 for 3-4) is ridiculous. So being poor af, I wasn't going to get anything but the special.

A little too dry for me and my bf though.\n- House made chorizo and potatoes: I liked the flavor from the chorizo, but this meat was also a little dry.\n- Traditional carnitas: My favorite of the night!! Definitely underrated next to the braised short rib. I wondered why everyone raved about this one because it didn't seem too special, but now I see why!\n- 2 Guajillo braised beef short rib: Very heavy and probably had the largest amount of meat on there!

It took me almost 20 minutes to find a parking.  If I wasn't meeting a friend, I probably would have continued driving and went somewhere else.  I would suggest that if you come to check out this place, make sure you have ample time (2 hours of so).\n\nHaving said that....it was all worth it because it's very good!", "author": "Steve B."}

The size is about the same as a taco truck but definitely more meat. My friend ordered the chicken, which was sugar sweet. I ordered the huskily braised beef brisket, which was salty and oily. The salsa had a minty flavor. I ordered sopa de Lima (chicken soup), which had basil. I'm not aware of any Mexican dishes that have basil or mint. They should of put cilantro instead.

The chips were rather hard (not necessarily bad) and the salsa was a little different than other salsas I've had.\n\nTwo of my friends and I decided to get the 10 tacos for $33. The cod was my favorite (as was the yellow sauce). The chicken taco and chorizo taco were decent. The rice I tried had a lot of flavor since the green chile sauce they drizzled over gave it tang and spice. You pay because all of their meats are bought hormone free.

The pacific cod one is a bit bland, but adding salsa to it helps. The tacos are a bit small compared to other Mexican restaurants, but they are generous with the amount of meat offered in ratio to the size of the taco.

As others have noted, the hype may have been a bit overplayed.\n\nKudos to the staff, start to finish, who keep this place moving like a well oiled machine. We knew to expect a wait, and I liked the system where they text you when your table is ready. It gave us a chance to stroll down Vallencia and actually have a drink elsewhere while we waited. Only \"problem\" is that our table was ready in 30 minutes rather than the hour we were quoted. I downed my beer when we got the good news, but my wife had to leave her's. Lesson learned.\n\nAnother newbie mistake was ordering too much. We might be used to the typical tacos served at our local \"Taco Tuesdays\"..cheap and tasty, but not always filling. The tacos here are different, by far.  We ordered 8 for the two of us, along with some beans and an order of guac. Granted, we had had some light appetizers elsewhere, but there was no finishing these 8 tacos between us.\n\nWhether it was the braised short rib (my favorite) or the pacific cod, all were generously stuffed. In fact, there are two shells for each taco, so might not be bad to split into two tacos. My wife was a little put off by the cod taco, which she didn't realize was fried, and in any case was larger than expected. My filet mignon taco sounded better on paper than it tasted. Save your $3 upcharge.\n\nI thought the real stars were the drinks (I had a spicy mango margarita - forget the name) that was outstanding and the guac was smooth and tasty.  The black beans were also great.\n\nWe walked out of there generously stuffed and waddled back to BART. Next time I'll order less (and avoid the pregame apps).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-10", "description": "I worked with Megan, the Special Events Manager, in planning my husband's 30th birthday party here and everything went spectacularly.  Initially, I was a little hesitant because the name \"Tacolicious\" just makes me think of a taqueria.  However, I'd like to say that the restaurant is perfect for parties.  The ambiance is very hip with a nice bar towards the front of the restaurant and a spacious room in the back for semi-private or private parties.\n\nFor $29 per person, we shared the room with another party but there's a big table in the middle so you don't really get in each others' way.  Menu consists of salsa, guacamole, queso, 2 appetizers, 2 tacos, and dessert.  It sounds overpriced for the food you're getting but they give you a LOT.  Each bowl of salsa, guacamole, and queso was so big that I don't think we even got through half.  Chips are fresh and frequently replenished.  \n\nAlbacore tuna tostada and meatball appetizers were my favorite items of the night; I may have liked them even more than the tacos.  Tacos were so generously piled on with meat that by the time we got them, most of us could only eat 1-2.  The favorites were probably braised beef and rock cod, although the chicken was super saucy and the carnitas were tender.  I normally love churros but I wasn't a fan of this style because it was more crispy rather than doughy.... just a personal preference.  The Mexican hot chocolate dip was delicious though.\n\nPlanning the party was really easy. I like that they print menus for each person and you can even include a customizable header.  Service was fantastic the entire night and the back room even gets their own bartender so we were never wanting for drinks.  I would highly recommend this place for a group dinner or event--all the information can be found on the website.", "author": "Shannon L."}

I typically walk away form a meal with a belly full of delicious food, a slight buzz and a smile on my face. However, yesterday it was quite the contrary. \n\nFirst, we ordered a Michelada, however they didn't give us the rest of our beer (typically the whole beer cant fit in the cup with the tomato juice). \n\nSecond, I ordered the \"taco of the week\" which was Octopus. I also ordered my favorite, the Baja Cod which is fried. Myself and my 2 friends who also ordered the Octopus agreed that it was extremely overcooked and almost inedible because it was hard and rubbery. The fried Baja Cod taco appeared to be a HUGE serving but when I crushed the fried shell there was literally zero fish. \n\nLastly, the service was TERRIBLE yesterday. It took us forever for our server to come to our table. When she finally did it was not very friendly at all. At the end, and after trying to flag her down for our check she came by and I could barely get a word in to give feedback on the food. I knew she was busy so said politely \"when you have a spare minute could you come back because I have feedback for you\" - well, she never came back so unfortunately this feedback is now on Yelp. \n\nI live in the Mission and don't know if ill be back to Tacolicious.

Tacolicious has an open kitchen layout, where you can see the cooks and staff prep you orders -- loves it!

It can be a hit if you order the right stuff, but a miss if you don't, so choose wisely!  \n\nHITS:\n1) Beets Salad -- refreshing, light, and the cheese was amazing! Portion was small so it's good to order as an appetizer to get your stomach ready for the REAL stuff! \n2) Stir-Fried short rib taco was super tasty and hearty. It was a cooked faijita style, so all the flavors blended in nicely. It was the special of the week.\n2) Braised chicken taco was also very yummy and moist. \n3) Complementary chips and salsa -- delicious and c'mon, who doesn't love free stuff?? \n4) Their tray of there sauces added a nice kick to the tacos -- sometimes a much needed kick for the dull tasting ones. \n\nMISS\n1) Carnitas taco was really dry and bitter.\n2) Fried cod taco -- the amount of batter was overwhelming and it tasted very bland. Definitely could use more flavor and seasoning. \n3) Veggie cactus taco with cheese -- interesting combo and concept, but lacking flavor. Texture was there though. The cactus gave a nice crunch. \n \nAll in all, thumbs up! Prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly. Free chip and salsa to start. The food overall was decent. Great location in the heart the Mission. Judging the whole dining experience -- I would recommend and definitely come back with friends or a date day!", "author": "Ellen W."}

The meal did not disappoint. We were a party of four and only had to wait ~20 minutes for a table around 7:30pm on a Friday night. The outdoor patio area is pleasant. With heating lamps, the area was completely comfortable despite being a bit chilly outside. \n\nThe service was friendly and prompt. We split the plate of 10 tacos and the guacamole. All of the tacos were tasty, but I would definitely recommend the guajillo braised beef short rib and the traditional carnitas. The guacamole was good- it advertises as \"freshly made\" and it does include the chunks of avocado that I love. \n\nWe also split TWO pitchers of the \"margarita de la casa.\" ImThis was recommended by our server as being not \"too sweet.\" It didn't have the margarita-mixer taste that a lot of restaurant \"house\" margaritas have.

We waited for about 5-10 mins before doing so. After we sat ourselves we had to flag down a worker to help us, which might have been our fault since they might have not seen us sit down. After they took our order we, we saw our order sitting out there waiting to be brought to the table while our server was sitting there chatting with other workers. This was around 4ish and we were having a late lunch because we just got out of class so you can only imagine how hungry we were. We were about to walk up and get it ourselves and the same thing goes with the sauces. We had to ask for it then flag her down and ask for more.

I pulled out about 2/3rds from each one and still had a great taco left. They may cost more than the ones at the truck, but you are absolutely getting your money's worth.\n\nTacolicious nicely fills the gap between a taqueria and a \"formal\" sit-down Mexican restaurant. So if you're craving tacos but want something more upscale and festive than Pancho Villa, El Farolito, Canc\u00fan, etc., Tacolicious is for you.", "author": "Valeria R."}

The carnitas tacos were greasy and kind of flavorless. \n\nMy biggest issue is that the banquette along one of the long walls is not at the right height for the tables - it is incredibly uncomfortable to be seated there, and I will wait to sit at a table and not at the banquette. The seat is just too high for the table, and the cross bar support on the seat is not high enough so anyone shorter than 5'5\" legs just dangle. \n\nWith so much energy put into the design of the restaurant, it's hard to overlook one of the most important aspects which is diner comfort.

The food was some of the best Mexican we've had, immediately demonstrated with the guacamole & salsa. It's kinda strange to wax poetic about chips, salsa & guac, but there really was something rave-worthy about Tacolicious's recipe. Later, they served big bowls of the \"Marina girl\" salad, and platters of their most popular tacos: the rock cod (fave!), beef short rib, and beer braised chicken. They were almost fork & knife tacos, piled high with toppings and heavy-handed on the meat. For $4, I'd come back and make a meal of these babies. \n\nTacolicious has obviously earned it's SF-institution status.

To be honest, I have only had tacos ONCE in my life, right?! Where have I been.. and it was a fish taco. Since my boyfriend was in town, I asked him what he wanted to have for dinner before we went out to see some friends at the lounge later on a Friday night. My boyfriend is always pretty open minded when it comes to trying new things. So, we went. Parking was not the easiest to find. The location of the restaurant was somewhat hidden and we walked back a fourth from the block until we really figured it out. haha. But, we asked the lady in the front how long the wait would be and she said 30-35 minutes. Which did not make me that happy because I am impatient when i'm hungry =/  But, we stood inside since it was relatively cold. With only about 10 minutes of a wait, the waitress seated us! I was so happy. We sat down and they brought us what looked and tasted like homemade chips and salsa. IT WAS SO GOOD. The salsa had a spicy kick to it. As we were deciding on what to order, I immediately knew I wanted the made to order guacamole because I love guac, I could literally eat it on everything if I had it with me 24/7. We ordered a total of six tacos. 3 short ribs, 1 chicken, 1 cod, and 1 traditional carnita. \n\nWe were nibbling away on the chips and salsa when the guacamole came and it was amazing. The best guacamole ever! Hands down. not too long after, our tacos came. We did not realize they were so huge and stuffed. As in STUFFED. my intentions were to only eat 2 and my boyfriend wanted 4. But, after having One. I was full. \n\nI would have to say my favorite was the short ribs and my boyfriend liked the traditional carnita. We will definitely be back.

I don't take spicy food well and I would say everything from the salsa to the  food had a good kick to it. It probably isn't bad at all for someone who can take it. That being said, the food was so good I looked (and ate) passed that. \n\nThe chips were hot and fresh, the salsa was tasty, like I said, a little kick. Excellent margarita, strong but well flavored to mask the tequila somewhat, which is ideal for me. The short rib taco was packed with the braised beef, I had to eat some off to close the taco. it only includes a small garnish on top but really doesn't need anything. The meet is a little oily as you can see it staining the taco but it maximized the taste and wasn't at all too oily to eat. Adding a squirt of lime on top really eased the heat for me. The squash kale taco was so much better than I thought it would be. Still hearty though not including any meat, all the flavors went together really nicely. Sweetness of the squash, bitterness of the kale, crunch of the pumpkin seeds - absolutely delish. Lastly was the rice. The rice was good but it also had a kick to it and I would have preferred that to be my savior from the heat. It was flavorful though and had a lime sauce on top. I didn't eat all the rice but I could see it was a bit oily at the bottom of the bowl.

The bartender immediately shows him the menu, asks what he'd like, then makes the guy a drink while I'm just sitting there...\n\nNormally, I wouldn't mind slow service on a busy day, but here it was blatantly obvious that the bartender was making a point of snubbing me. I walked out of there without ordering, and don't plan on going back.", "author": "Saul K."}

First this place is hopping, at least it is during the evening rush, that said the hostess did a great job accommodating our party of five and seating us in an already busy establishment. \n\nService felt a little slow for me, but I believe I was the only one in our group that noted this, otherwise they were very friendly and full of smiles. The chips and salsa were kept full without a word being said and may I also mention good. \n\nThis was just a stop for snacks so we kept it small, but I couldn't help but to go with a couple of tacos. I asked for and received the pacific cod tacos, now while the physical menu didn't differentiate, I was told, when asked, they are prepared fried; I prefer grilled and they were accommodating enough to provide. They came as ordered street style, two tortillas, a generous piece of grilled cod on a layer of guacamole, and a layer of cabbage (pickled?) onion and cilantro. Holy salivation punch Batman! This was like Niagra Falls of the face it was so good! Every layer of flavor was absolutely amazing! I nearly forgot to mention that there was a small plate of side salsas they served with our food and I used a dab of the verde on my tacos. Interestingly, had I known how these were prepared I may have asked for some mods, but I'm glad I didn't as they were perfect as the chef intended (I'm thinking I need to start letting things happen that way and open my palate to the possibilities). I also had the pleasure of sampling my brides Albondigas, which were also nothing short of amazing; the meatballs were delicate and very tasty served in a delicious sauce and very savory. I also almost forgot the salt. My lovely wife called it fuzzy, and while I am not certain about that, it was tasty, perhaps a Himalayan pink or maybe locally harvested (knowing this is done in the South Bay) for sea salt; never the less it was tasty with a delicate mouthfeel (the same salt was on our table in a small dish we used on our chips and also served on the margarita).\n\nThey had an accommodating and reasonable selection of beer, wine, and spirits; certainly enough to please most and provide some level of happiness, including sangria. Would I return? If I lived locally, I'd be back most every day of the week and twice on Sunday's.

Both times I've visited, the restaurant was packed to the max to the point where it's hard to hear what the person across from you is saying. There is a person checking people in for tables...you would think he would approach me and ask if I wanted to put my name down, this being a restaurant where customer service is of utter importance right? But no, I had to literally wave my hand at him and ask if he was checking people in for tables. Then came the 45 minute wait. I mean it's tacos y'all, you can find tacos anywhere. But we decided to wait, because their salsa is pretty bomb. Yup, the salsa was the defining factor. After a good half an hour wait, my friend and I got seated between two tables (please take into account that everyone is almost touching shoulder to shoulder in here). The group next to us was absolutely hammered. To our amusement, rather than annoyance, they spilled their chips all over the floor and one of them kept tugging at my jacket. I'm going off topic, but it was just so interesting I had to share.\n\nAnyways, back to the restaurant. The tacos are good, yes, they are, but they're also overpriced. Kinda oily, but that satisfying oily. I got the carnitas and the chicken mole one, the carnitas was definitely on a higher scale as far as my taste buds can remember.  As far as the customer service, I thought it was just okay. There seemed to be a lot of employees walking up and down the restaurant, but it's so hard to catch their attention. To be fair, our waitress asked if I was okay once the rowdy hammered group had left, which was really nice of her.

I've been here a couple of times, and while I've either had to crowd at the bar or wait ~ 1 hr for a table (they don't take reservations), it has always been worth it. For drinks I get their pasion, which is tequila, habenero, and passion fruit juice. It is slightly sweet and has a great kick!  \n\nFor food, their salsa is amazing - there is a hint of mint flavor! As for the tacos, you can't go wrong with rock cod. The cod is fried and melts in your mouth like butter! The short rib tacos are also quite amazing.

I happened to stumble upon this lively taco restaurant after seeing the packed house and the delicious looking tacos through the glass windows. Also I had heard that Obama had came to eat here. My theory was confirmed by a picture of him eating tacos. \n\nWe were lucky enough to get seated right away. The hostess said that several days ago, the wait had been over 2 hours?! Anyways, we were seated on a high table in the corner of the restaurant. Menu wasn't too overwhelming and my eyes drifted to the taco part of the menu. My family ended up ordering the kale salad and 10 tacos. \nThe tacos were: \nFried local rock cod\nTraditional carnitas\nGuajillo braised beef short rib\nBistec adobado\nand the weekly special in our case the Korean special taco\n\nWhen the food came, we were already satisfied by the copious amounts of chips we, um accidentally, inhaled. ;) The chips were perfectly crisp and the salsa had a spicy tang to it, but was so addicting. Kale salad was light, refreshing, and packed with nutrients from the sliced radish, kale, and other vegetables. This was a pleasant start to my meal. Now, back to the tacos.\n\nBest tacos we had would have to be the Korean taco and the fried rock cod. The other tacos we also good as well, but they weren't superb. The korean taco was mouth-watering and carried the succulent juices of flavor, oh so tasty. The rock cod, matched with the array of salsas, was very appetizing and delicious.  \n\nService was pretty good, although the waitress didn't take our order for a while (I think she was distracted) and the other servers kept refilling the salsa/chip dish numerous times. \n\nTacolicious is  truly one of the wonderful bites on Valencia.

At 6:45pm on a Friday, we were informed that the wait for a table for 6 was 2 hours.  Normally, I'm not really one to wait for a table for 2 hours, but we planted ourselves around the corner at the Phoenix to have a few drinks before going back.  Our table was by the bar area, so once we sat down, we were comfortable in our little booth, away from the rest of the crowd.  I thought that the ambiance here was good, and Tacolicious really does a good job of catering to a large group.  Rather than going for a pitcher, we all went for individual drinks.  Some of the drinks that were ordered were El Sangre, Mexican Ol' Fashioned, Michelada, and I had the Paloma.  My drink was delicious, the overwhelming taste of the tequila was matched perfectly with the elderflower and grapefruit.  I'm a sucker for elderflower, so I'm always going to have good things to say about a drink with it in it.  For the meal, Greg and I ordered separately the 4 for $14 and I ordered the following:\n\n-1 veggie taco: Everything in this taco appealed to me, the fingerling potatoes were a little awkward in a taco, but the asparagus and green garlic were great!\n-1 carnitas taco: I loved the carnitas taco in the Marina, and I loved it here\n-1 short rib taco: I'm a huge fan of short rib, and I may have liked this one more than the carnitas\n-1 chorizo taco: By the time I got to the chorizo taco, i had already eaten too much.  I have a really weak palate for spicy and could tell this one had a little bit of heat on it.  Like I said though, I'm one of the weakest when it comes to spice tolerance.\n\nThe tacos came out on two huge platters, so organizing whose was whose was confusing.  Once we got eating, it went quiet.  I think everyone really enjoyed their food, and there was definitely nothing that went to waste.  I was in major food coma after eating my tacos, so while I had ordered another Paloma during dinner, it took me a loooong time to down the rest of it.  Greg and his friend sipped on some tequila/mezcal after dinner while I struggled to stay awake and sitting up.  Ultimately, once dinner was over and check came, we headed on to the next place, but definitely feeling very ful.  I will agree and say that Tacolicious is pricey. But to that I say, so is San Francisco in general.  I will also say that this place is best visited with a group of people, and not as a date place.  There's something that makes this place a little bit more fun and exciting when you have a group of people to talk over tacos with, scarf down chips and salsa at an alarmingly fast rate with, and enjoy the fun environment with. Check it out if you're on Valencia!", "author": "Lisa I."}

We came upon a group of people hanging out on the sidewalk outside T-lish. They were serving tacos outside. We decided to try. After my 3rd bite of a vegan taco filled with oyster mushroom, tofu, fingerling potatoes, I Fell In Love. Since that time, T-lish is my \"must go\" spot in the Mission. Note: I usually end up walking at least 10 to 20 blocks whenever I'm in the area. After 1-2 hours, I am Hungry. Fortunately, no matter how early or late in the afternoon, I can count on T-Lish to be open and welcoming. In the 4+ years since J and I have been patrons, T-lish has consistently given us satisfying, organic food, excellent service, comfortable seating (inside & outside) and a clean bathroom. PIcture this: within seconds of being seated, a huge basket of tortilla chips + fresh salsa (can ask for refills) appears on your table. Instant gratification while you peruse the menu filled with seasonal and organic items. Napkins and forks and knives (you have to ask for a spoon) are also on your table. \n\nImportant fact: the servers graciously accomodate all of my dietary restrictions (no meat/no seafood/no dairy/no gluten/no soy/no processed sugar/low salt) with nary a raised eyebrow or eye roll. Example: for brunch on Carnival Sunday, I asked for asparagus to be blanched with just a little bit of salt and minus the seasonings on the menu. 5 out of 7 spears were cooked perfectly (2 spears overdone). J got the huarache con huevos and he ate every single bite. Customarily, we eat lunch here and always order my first love - their vegan tacos -- (so yummy!)-- Asparagus, oyster mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, green garlic, ancho chile recado (on the side).  When we're feeling especially hungry, we order the guacamole. \n\nWe took a LA chef friend (Leslie P.) there and she ended up eating at T-Lish TWICE during a 4 day stay. \n\nPrices: I did wonder a bit at the price of my asparagus (7 spears for $9.00) but I am paying for the privilege of a comfortable dining space and someone to cook the asparagus for me. So, while prices are definitely higher than one would pay at a taqueria, they are justified based on the quality of the ingredients, service and space.", "author": "Grace C."}

Affordable too. There would've been an hour wait (at 4:30pm), but luckily a group before us never showed up, so we got to take their spot. \n\nI've had my fair share of amazing tacos, but Tacolicious brought it to another level. What we ordered:\n\n- Fried sweet plantains ($7.50): eleven, 3-inch decently-sized plantains. Fried just enough to be crispy around the edges, but soft on the inside.  I didn't like plantains before this. These converted me. Couldn't stop eating them. \n\n- Tacos (10 tacos for $31 deal). Bigger than the average street taco. There are 7 fillings to choose from - we skipped out on the bistec adobado for some unknown reason. In order of preference: \n\n1) fried local rock cod\n2) traditional carnitas\n3) house-made chorizo & potatoes\n4) butternut squash\n5) shot-and-a-beer braised chicken\n6) guajillo braised beef short rib\n\nThe braised beef was a tad too juicy/meaty, but otherwise they were all so fresh, flavorful, and wonderfully tasty. The 3 types of salsas only helped. None of that diluted stuff mind you - these were in-house, unique quality salsas. \n\nWe shared 10 tacos per 3 people and were all surprisingly very full by the end. \n\nI think I'd still go to the casual joints if it's just me or 1 other person (or if I wanted something quick), but definitely recommend this place for groups/guests -- can't wait for the next occasion to come here.", "author": "An Y."}

Because my main complaint was the cost of our group dinner, along with poor service. Service I'm sure varies depending on who your server might be. So, I try to never hold it against an establishment if your service is mediocre or even poor. I started contemplating my astronomical bill and came to the conclusion that maybe it is entirely possible that my friends may be alcoholics. So three stars it is! And that's all you get!\n\nPlease enjoy my original review:\nTonight was my first time coming here. I was excited. Maybe it's ok for a small group. But, my experience for a birthday dinner with a group of 11 ladies was awful. I'm so sad. I spent $70 and came home to eat a quesadilla in my kitchen.\n\nFirst off, our original reservation was for 13 and 2 could not come. They tried to charge us for 13, even though there were only 11 of us! So if you have a large group, I guess under estimate and maybe they will accommodate more?\n\nSecondly, the staff was not terribly friendly. We sat down and were served chips, salsa, and guac. The chips & salsa were actually very good. (Hence one of the stars). We were served salad. But, nobody at our large table had a fork till, the soonest, 10 mins later (I'm not exagerating). I filled up on chips & salsa. By the time our tacos came, I had one. It was pretty good. It was a taco.\n\nFinally our bill came. Which was truly the worst part. It was originally $710 divided by 10 people (the birthday girl was not included). Somehow we got it down to $600. I think our waitress was not happy that she did not get a 20% tip. However, she did not give us very much attention and I for one could to spend any more than I had to already.\n\nIf I had known I was going to spend $70 on one taco, I would have stayed home! I had one margarita. I think we had three pitchers dropped off at our table and that was it. I really don't understand how a $700 bill happened for 11 girls. Did they charge us $200 to bring our own cake? I'm still scratching my head. Really? Tacos? Did they charge us prime-time premium rent for sitting in the back room for so long. And if the service hadn't taken so long we could have cut back on rent. Do restaurants charge rent? \n\nNot cheap. Not good for a large party. Chachacha's is my choice for group dinners. If you have money to burn on good tacos then do it up! If you want cheap, than this is not the place. If you want to pay hipster prices for tacos in a mecca of delicious and low cost Mexican food then by all means.

The water was luke warm lol.\n\nLooked at the menu and searched for any meat entree that wasnt a taco. Not too much to pick from, but there was the Costillas and this Meat dish. I ended getting the meat dish. Steak, eggs, beans, and rice. Substituted beans for more rice.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised. It was amazing! For someone who's not particularly fond of Mexcian food, this was a pleasant meal. I wanna try the Costillas next time. I was happy with my order.\n\nIt was about $10 bucks, which was a decent price. \n\nWould I come back?

We were seated at a table for 6, even though along with our party of 8 - PLUS, we also had a stroller with a sleeping baby in it. When a table for 8 right next to ours opened up - just after we'd been seated - we were told we would not be accommodated. As a result, we were pretty crunched for space: after our tacos arrived - served family-style - my spouse had no room for a plate for him to eat his dinner.\n\nEach of the 5 kids at our table ordered kid's meals, which I thought was a great value - $7 for one taco, rice, beans, drink & ice cream. However, our waitress forgot all of the kid's drinks. When I brought it to her attention that the kids had not received their drinks long after the kids had received their taco dinners, instead of apologizing, the waitress simply asked, \"Oh, did they want those?\" Um, yes - kids *do* like drinks, especially when it's ordered as part of their meal. The wait staff took quite a while to take our orders. Once our order was placed, the waitress forgot to bring my spouse his beer. It also took a long time to get any wait staff member's attention so we could ask for our bill.\n\nFood: The chips placed on the table after we sat down were fresh and the salsa was positively divine! I was told the ceviche was also great. The grilled corn was flavorful. My fish tacos were more heavily battered than I would have liked, but the cabbage slaw on top was fresh.

We ended up getting the 10-taco plate with 5 of the baja style pacific cod, 2 traditional carnitas, 1 shot-and-a-beer braised chicken, 1 chicken en mole colorado, and 1 vegetarian one with the romano beans (i don't remember everything that was in it because it was the only one i didn't try, oops). Oh my goodness, these were some of the best tacos I've ever had in my life. They were PACKED. And when I say packed, I mean that we were able to split a single tacos between two people using just one tortilla each and they were still bigger than your average taco. They also come with three different salsa with three different levels of spicyness. I highly recommend eating your tacos with the salsa, even though they're just as yummy without. The cod was perfectly crispy and was complemented well by the cabbage cumin crema. The carnitas taco was amazing as well, probably the most packed of the tacos, with lots of juicy carnitas. I loved that one and wished we had ordered more. The chicken en mole had a sort of sweet taste, which I preferred over the shot-and-a-beer one that had more of a salty/spicy taste. All the tacos were amazing though.\nOverall, I loved Tacolicious. It was fresh and gourmet, while still tasting very authentic. The quality of everything was just top-notch. My only complaint really would be the service. We had to approach the bar to get more water because it was so difficult to get the attention of the waiters. We even had to walk up to the lady taking reservations and ask her if we could get our check as we faced the same difficult calling over a waiter. For this reason, I give Tacolicious only 4 stars, even though the food alone deserves 6. Will definitely be coming back again!", "author": "Corinna S."}

Puerto Allegro wasn't open yet so I decided to give Tacolicious a try. The inside is dim like the Hollister store and music was blaring so I chose to sit in the patio.\n\nI didn't have time to linger so I made my order quick. They have 4 tacos for $12 but I got 3 because the waitress said 3 were plenty.  \n\nThe shot-and-a-beer braised chicken was a perfection. I should have ordered two of those because they are way better than the rock cod ones, which are tasty but forgettable. Batter was a bit too thick. The tacos were only made better with their excellent salsas, which had a tinge of mint. Food came with three sauces: salsa verde, chipotle, and yellow harbanero. They were all good but yellow was the spicest.\n\nService was okay. I finished all my food and the soda before she came check on me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-11-22", "description": "I've heard great things about Tacolicious, so I must have gone on an off night. I mean, for the most part, the food isn't horrible, but it really just wasn't that good either. We went on a Thursday night around 10:30pm and it was still fairly lively -- I definitely loved the vibe and how the place was centered around the long, open kitchen. It has all of the components for an awesome, alcohol-filled Mexican joint... \n\n...except for the food.\n\n-------------------------------\nFOOD:\n\nCeviche = \nThis has got to be one of the worst ceviche renditions I've ever had. It had the texture of recently-thawed fish that had been in the freezer for months; the flavors were... well... there really weren't many flavors going on; and it just didn't appear very appetizing. It was completely void of freshness, citrus, and kick. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nGuacamole =\nThere needs to be WAY more flavor in this guacamole. It tasted like a bowl of only avocado -- it was missing any other flavor. Needs more onion, needs more lime, needs more jalapeno, needs more cilantro, needs more everything. Especially for $8.50, this guac was just way too bland.\n\nAlbacore Tuna Tostada =\nThe tuna was okay, but the tostada was spread with this cheap-tasting aioli that completely overpowered the fish. This was like the complete opposite of the ceviche and guacamole -- there was way too much of that pink cream sauce on this tostada that it made it pretty tough to enjoy.\n\nShort Rib Tacos =\nThe short rib tacos had a pretty good flavor, so I actually enjoyed this. It's a fairly gargantuan taco (with tons of short rib meat), so it can be pretty heavy, but I can't really complain about them giving too much meat. Adding on the habanero salsa and the salsa verde made this taco pretty delicious.\n\nFried Cod Tacos =\nThese were okay. The cod was a little too fishy (clear sign that cod isn't very fresh) and the fried batter got soggy very quickly. \n\n-------------------------------\n\nThey do have a pretty extensive drink list, which I can always appreciate, so it's a pretty awesome place to have a few drinks with chips/salsa. We tried the Pineapple Coconut Chupito which tasted like they just poured straight-up margarita mix into a glass, so that was pretty nasty. \n\nAll in all, Tacolicious just doesn't have the food to really make it stand out as a good Mexican restaurant in SF, especially since there are so many incredible Mexican options in the Mission. But if all you want is to kick back some tequila shots and munch on some free chips, though, Tacolicious may fill that void.", "author": "Roy C."}

Best Mole Taco I've ever had. \nGot a tip from our ace pitcher Tim Lincecum that the tacos here were better than his fastball so I decided to give it a shot. \nI know what your thinking.... mission..., tacos...., whats new right?\nOne thing I noticed besides the higher price points is that their ingredients are definitely top notch. The chips are strong so you can mound the salsa on without fear of breakage. The house salsa gives a perfect kick without  burning the palate. The meat in their tacos are so juicy/tender that they give you a double layer of tortilla  to hold it together. Good call. \nThe tequila list is so large I get dizzy just looking at it but if that's your poison of choice this is your heaven. \nDefinitely not the authentic hole in the wall joints that I've become accustomed to in the Mission district but unique enough to brush away any thoughts of \"chipotle\"   from my mind as well. I'm glad they opened up shop here to show they can contend with the mission taco heavyweights even if they pack a bigger punch to my wallet. \n\nI would definitely go here for the Mole taco but so far this is the only place I'll order a vegetarian taco and not be dissapointed that I did.\n\nP.S.

I'm a huge fan of tacos and being in the Mission district, it's obviously the best place to get authentic Mexican food. But good luck finding parking. Remember, this is in the city, so it's notorious for its lack of parking spaces. \n\nThe atmosphere is very urban casual and welcoming. It has a very unpretentious look to the exterior and interior of the restaurant. Normally, this place is pretty packed around lunch time, but the staff does an excellent job at trying to get people seated as quick as possible.\n\nTheir menu changes every now and then. So, what I tried the first time was not available on the menu the second time, but nonetheless, it was still absolutely delicious! But also, the taco wraps were soft, but not too soft so that they fell apart everywhere, which is what normally happens to me when I eat tacos. \n\nSAUCES\n-What I love is that they provided an array of various sauces for you to add to your food. I believe it ranged from mild, medium, and spicy. But for those who can handle spicy food and love eating spicy food, none of the sauces are really THAT spicy to make you pant or have your sinuses act up.\n\nFRIED PACIFIC COD TACOS\n-I loved it! The fish was fried lightly to a beautiful golden brown. Perfect amount of vegetables with a generous amount of fish.\n-Rating: 5/5\n\nSHOT-AND-A-BEER BRAISED CHICKEN TACOS\n-Just as good as the pacific cod tacos! The meat was juicy and full of flavor. Not too saucy or juicy so that the juices spilled everywhere and made a mess of things.\n-Rating: 4/5\n\nSUMMER SQUASH, PASILLA PEPPERS, BELL PEPPERS, BRENTWOOD CORN TACOS\n-Super delicious! Right amount of vegetables to get a very well-balanced taste of all its ingredients. No one ingredient overpowered the other. \n-Rating: 4/5\n\nIf you're craving tacos and looking for a more-than-decent taco joint, this place is your best bet. Super amazing tacos with wonderful variety on their menu! Great atmosphere to dress casually and just chill. Noise level varies, but it's the city, so I didn't find it too much of a bother. Highly recommend trying this place out!", "author": "Jessica X."}

I think it has to do with the home made corn tortillas and the little trio of mild, medium and spicy salsas that come with them. Did I mention that the secret ingredient in their guac is mint? Yea, the waitress told us the other day and it all makes sense now. Mind blown. Their margaritas are just the right amount of sweet and sour and alcoholic. I also heard that they have happy hour at their Marina and North Beach shops where the margaritas are only $6 from 3:30-5:30. At the Mission location there is sweet outdoor sitting in a skinny alley with murals down the walls and sunshine in the afternoons.

First, they're not authentic Mexican tacos. Second, they cost twice as much as authentic Mexican tacos. Third, they're pretty damn good. \n\nRock cod, beef short rib, duck, chorizo and potatoes -- all of them delicious and filling. The corn tortillas are thick, and while I appreciate the fact that they don't break easily, I found them to be a little *too* thick. The tacos are served with three different sauces of varying heat. Green is for mild. Red is for medium. Yellow is for hot hot hot. It's a little counter-intuitive, but try and remember it anyway. Depending on your tolerance for spicy, it could save you a lot of trouble.\n\nTheir tuna tostada is on one of 7x7's The Big Eat lists. I don't always agree with that list, but they were pretty spot on with this one. Melt-in-your-mouth tuna sashimi with avocado, leeks and mayo on a crispy tortilla -- a wonderful play of flavors and texture that you really do need to try before you die.\n\nTop off your hipster taqueria experience with a couple of margaritas, which are always good here.

Or at least, as mainstream of a hipster experience as you can possibly get in the mission, from the wood table to the menu to the prices.\n\nHowever, then the food comes, and you realize that you paid $5 for a tiny street taco... despite the fact that it tastes quite delicious, especially the cod taco, you realize that $5 for a taco is quite a steep price.. (Even when you do the ten-taco deal, it only drops the price to $4 for one taco).\n\nIn the mission, we have a ton of great choices for food. Just a few streets over you can experience what it's like to eat tacos where a full meat market is practically attached to the taco shop, with the most succulent beef placed upon a tortilla that provides a terrific melt-in-your-mouth experience. But that's there, not here. If the atmosphere is not worth 75% of the price to you, coming here is a mistake.

To me, tacos always meant $2 tacos off the local cart/restaurant from the cart/restaurant down the street (albeit questionable in the health department). When the hostess told us the wait time, I was ready to leave.... but I'm glad I didn't. \n\nThe hostess told us that we could head to the bar next door and start drinking, and that she'd get us when our table was ready. It was 8pm and drinks were in order, so we headed to the bar and ordered the first round of drinks. It took us about 25 minutes for us to actually get the drinks because it was packed, but the drinks were great. I had a Mexican Old Fashioned (tequila, orange rind, chocolate bitters, sugar) that was pretty awesome. Before we knew it, our table was ready.\n\nWe settled for 10 tacos for $31 bucks to try every kind of taco they had. I was a bit surprised when the tacos came out because they were HUGE. Probably 2x or 3x the amount of meat that you'd get in a regular taco, which probably makes the expensive price tag worth it. Moreover, the tacos were juicy and delicious. I was told the Fried Cod was the most popular, and I have to agree that it was really good. The short rib was also juicy and flavorful. The chicken tacos, although a bit dry, where pretty good but I'd prefer the ones from my local taco stand over those.\n\nAs a side, we had the fried plantains. They were thin cut like french fries and were awesome. It was definitely one of those appetizers that I couldn't stop eating! \n\nAll in all, great environment, drinks, and food.

Just seemed to me like your average Mexican fusion restaurant, nothing too special. \n\nThe tacos themselves are tasty enough, but they double up on the corn tortillas. This  leads to the tortilla really overpowering the taste of the taco fillings. I'd recommend chucking the outer tortilla. As for the fillings themselves, my favorite was the short rib, although the sight of how much grease drips onto your plate might make you queasy. My friends seemed to like the cod, but I thought it was a little bland. \n\nChips and salsa were pretty good. They also have someone working there who looks almost exactly like Sergio Romo, so if you've ever wanted to live out your fantasy of being served tacos made by the Giants closer, this is your place.

Just to be clear, Tacolicious isn't authentic Mexican food - if that's what you're looking for, go elsewhere!\n\nAfter about a 20 minute wait at Mosto, the tequila bar next door, my friend and I were seated. The seating is sort of awkward - it's way too cramped and crowded for a restaurant. I liked the overall ambiance of Tacolicious, very casual yet dimly-lit, but it definitely caters to a more hipster crowd.\n\nWe started off with some chips and salsa, which are free, and we also ordered a side of guacamole ($8.25). We knew we wanted tacos, so we ordered:\n-Traditional carnitas \n-Guajillo braised beef short ribs\n\nOut of the two types of tacos we tried, the carnitas were my favorite. They were very tender, juicy, and we were given generous portions. The braised short ribs had tons of flavor but I'm a fan of more traditional tacos. While the tacos were delicious, I don't feel like they were worth the prices - 1 taco ($3.95), 4 tacos ($14), and 10 tacos ($33). Definitely not typical prices for Mexican food in the Mission! \n\nService was okay - our server was nice but she didn't check on us very much. We had other random servers refill our water and chips. \n\nI might try Tacolicious out again but with other more affordable, and more authentic, Mexican places in the neighborhood, it's not highly likely.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

That's what I thought before I ate there and is still true to a certain extent...b, b, but.....the tacos are really really good! All of them! I'm not about to break down each thing I ate but let's just say we tried about everything and were delighted with all of it. Real specific, huh? \n\nYeah, this place is hipster gentrifier hell in a way. But it's also a place were you can get good (not necessarily authentic) tacos with delicious margaritas. And honestly, if this is the direction the city is going, at least everyone eating and working there was cute. A bit central casting-ish but made for good people watching regardless. It's kind of expensive compared to real Mexican taco joints but this really isn't what Tacolicious is about. It was also super busy and noisy inside but I didn't find that surprising given the location. Once seated, it was actually fun, loud conversations and all. And finally, the wait time was less than they quoted so that was nice. \n\nIf I can figure out a time when it isn't so damn crowded, I see myself going in and ordering the 4 for $14 Taco plate (all short rib) and a margarita and choking down my gentrifier guilt with pure deliciousness.", "author": "Johnny H."}

Salsa & chips were okay, ceviche was okay (could've totally gone to place that served more for the same price), and for the tacos... it was decent. The waiter gave us a tip which I will hand over to all the yelpers reading this: if you decide to share on the taco specials, you can use the second tortilla and just split the food! It's a genius idea which my bf and I thought was helpful since we were planning to just split the tacos in half, but we ended up having our own little mini tacos. Thank you awesome waiter.

A combination of chorizo and potatoes, chicken, short ribs, fish tacos. Everything was pleasantly spicy and well seasoned. The fish was a tad bland to me, but it could have just been a bad batch. \n\nWe also ordered the fresh guacamole appetizer for the table, it was extremely basic, nothing to really say about it. \n\nNext were the shooters.

Came here with my girls on a Tuesday evening after work around 6 with an open mind after reading all the Yelp reviews. There was already a waitlist with us being number one. We waited for maybe 10 minutes and were seated at a high table with the hot ass sun in our eyes. Tacolicious, you should definitely think about putting shades on the highest parts of your windows. We were sweating from the heat and were really considering looking like those douchebags wearing their sunglasses indoors.\n\nAlthough the tacos are stuffed with a nice hefty amount of meat, we just weren't impressed. We ordered the 10 tacos for $33 and skipped the crispy taco tuesday special. All tacos were dripping with oil with the exception of the fish tacos, so we let the oil drip out before eating them.

I saw him pull a 'Cocktail' bottle-flip-move, and he almost lost it, but was proud of himself for catching it. Not a particularly friendly guy, but he impressed us with his memorization skills--just when we thought he wasn't listening to us order. Maybe he was bummed he couldn't do more cocktail tricks since we just had a spicy beer & michelada? Which btw, they were only $4.50? Is that right? Can you even get a Pabst anywhere for that price? \n\nChips & salsa were amazing. That salsa is magic! Excuse me? Is there mint in there? Only prob, no one asked if we wanted more of either. Bartender never asked us if we wanted more drinks.\n\nTacos were just alright: Summer squash, beef, chicken, cod, carnitas. They were big, we did not leave hungry. Okay and what are the sauces that showed up? No one explained. Mystery sauces. They were blah blah.\n\nOverall a cheap date. 2 drinks, 6 big tacos, chips & salsa $36 bucks.

Well, people were definitely watching us from the bar, giving us the stank eye for taking our sweet time, and having a great table.  Imagine 4 dancers in sweats CHOWING DOWN like it was our last meal.  That being said, make sure you wear more than sweats when you come here.  But at the time, we didn't care.\n\nNeedless to say, we were highly satisfied.  16 tacos, guacamole, and a pitcher of pomegranate margaritas later, we were STUFFED.  We even had to take a lot of it home.  Well, not the margaritas. :-)\n\nThe fish tacos are seriously amazing, and our 2nd favorite was definitely the shredded chicken.\n\nThey lose one star for how pricey it is.  I mean, this is the MISSION.  And there are so many other affordable taquerias around (obviously).  Our bill for 4 people was $117 excluding tax.  A bit much in our opinion.

To start, I want to give great regards to the service at this place - what a friendly and accomodating wait staff. It was already packed with a heavy waitlist when we got here at 7 on a Tuesday night. We decided to grab some drinks at the sidebar - what a selection of margaritas! However, I tried a beer and ordered the Victoria (lager) and wow truly delicious! Hardly any malt- aftertaste existent. Instead the aftertaste boasts a strong flavor of lime...wonderful with tacos. Now for the actual food - we got the guacamole platter (guac till I die) and to be honest it was alright... They provide ample portions. However the flavor fell flat.. Could probably use several cups of Tapito sauce. I got the bbq taco and one taco is already plenty of food, rich in sauce and flavor. The side hot sauces were fun to play around with, though I did find myself needing more like slices and several spoons of the side sauce to achieve my desired flavor level.", "author": "Grace O."}

I havent tried anything else but the tacos but I would not doubt that the other items on the menus arent good. \n\nDrink wise- GET THE PASION. Its the most delicious drink there you can have.

Our group of 5 arrived at 7pm with the idea of putting our names down and then drinking at Mosto next door till our table was ready. Upon arrival, I found a petite blonde hostess running around with a paper notepad writing down names. For a busy restaurant, why do they not have a computer system?\n\nWe ordered drinks at Mosto, and every time we ordered another round of the same drinks, they somehow always forgot my drink order, WTF? Just me, nobody else.\n\nA different hostess came around to see if we wanted a table outside which we politely refused because it was freezing outdoors. She said a table inside would be another 20 minutes which we didn't mind. Cut to 40 minutes later, still no table. I went in to check and the blonde hostess lied straight to my face that they couldn't find us (even though we did not move from our original place at Mosto) and they gave our table to another party.

Still looks to be somewhat a work in progess as we listened to drilling and hammering during the meal.  Perhaps this is why the music was on 11.  A bit distracting, but not a deal breaker.  \n\nService starts with chips and salsa, a definite prerequisite for a decent sit down Mexican establishment.  Salsa was very fresh and relatively mild.  A bit sweet though, most likely from roasting the vegetables before blending? \n\nWe started with the chili con queso, Shrimp a la diabla, alboldingas and a pitcher of house margs. The cheese dip is what it is, a guilty pleasure of processed cheese tomatoes and peppers.  The meatballs were super tender cooked in a rich, savory tomato broth.  The shrimp were smaller than anticipated but very succulent with just enough heat.  Ritas were refreshing, not too sweet with that perfect sourness.\n\nThen on to the tacos.  Four of us shared 10 tacos: (4) Rock cod, braised chicken, (2) carnitas, braised beef, chicken colorado and chicken suiza (wkly special).  I didn't try the carnitas, which is usually my litmus test for a Mexican joint. Everything else was great.  Really deep favors that are not always traditional, but have that comfort food familiarity.  Portions, by the way, are more than adequate.  The salsas served with the entrees are also notable.  A trio of mild avocado, chunky chipolte, and bright beatiful habanero.  I like it hot but sometimes a habanero salsa can be over the top.

We were just going to have drinks but since we were seated in the restaurant we decided to order some food. \n\nSo the good: Margaritas, they were killer. So good. \n\nThe bad: Food - everything we had. We started out with the guacamole. Personally I am a big fan of the avocado. It looked good, but it was so salty - practically inedible. We didn't finish it and kept trying to mix it with salsa to cut the salt but it didn't help. I have never left guacamole on the table. I also went for it and ordered the plantains which were advertised as sweet plantain. I am pretty sure they don't know how to prepare or buy plantains because they were not sweet plantains. They were tough and they had actually put sugar on them. They were practically banana chips. We also ordered the fish ceviche, which was really pico de gallo with one or two small pieces of fish. \n\nThe service was excellent however. We weren't going to complain but we didn't eat much and our server noticed so she asked and we gave her the details. She didn't charge us for a few of the food items which was really nice. \n\nI would definitely go back for a drink but would steer clear of the appetizers.", "author": "Alex T."}

I know I love in SF how can I not? My bf does tho! But, I think I like taco trucks better. Lol\n\nWhat i ordered: \nMy bf and I ordered 4 tacos for $18.75\n-2 pacific cod: the batter gets very soggy if you wait too long to eat it. Wish it was grilled instead. \n-2 braised short rib: had a lot of flavor but it was too greasy.\n\nThe regular, mild, and spicy salsa were mediocre. The Salsa that was served with chips are better. The queso is pretty good too, but not worth $8.\n\nI was hoping to order a jalapeno margarita but they didn't have it. I settled for the habanero margarita and it had a kick it to but I barely tasted any tequila.\n\nOverall, I think it's pretty overhyped and overpriced. I   barely ate any food and I feel stuffed. I think the greasy braised short rib makes me feel sort of sick and tired. But I give it 3 stars for the service and everything was alright. Probably won't return since I don't really eat Mexican food. But I'm glad i tried it and I know I'm not missing anything.", "author": "Connie K."}

They are not REAL Albonigas because real albonidgas a part of a soup - nonetheless my favorite item on the menu. The availability of tequila and mezcal is why i appreciate Tacolicious.   I LOVE Mezcal (and from experience know that their the mark up is a bit ridiculous). Nonetheless, I dig the vibe and eating options.  During our last visit, our server was awesome!

I liked that damn salad so much I looked up the recipe online and made it for my Super Bowl party (yes, I know I am that guy).\n\nWhy the 4 stars you ask? The only thing I can say in the not so positive about this place is 2 fold: The cocktails on the Tacolicious bar side are lacking, sweet or too tart (Mosto next door, totally different story) AND the absolute STANK of their fried fish tacos. So stanky that I actually moved tables once because the person next to me had one and I thought I was going to vomit. So I moved.

I'm more of a cheap street taco stand, hole in the wall taqueria, no frills pozole from a mom and pop shop type of gal when it comes to mexican food. This place is what is becoming the typical hipster mission restaurant norm, with lots of \"elevated\" overpriced dishes and fancy lighting. It kills me to say this because I truly do feel loyal to all the long time family owned local mexican places, but yes, Tacolicious has delicious food. I love love love their watermelon salad and fish tacos. Their tacos are pretty filling -- try a few different types and share with friends! Again, it hurts me to say this, but this Marina transplant makes delicious food!", "author": "Michelle K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-22", "description": "First time at Tacolicious last night. Bottom line: TRY IT! Don't let the \"working really hard to over-hipsterfy everything like every other place in the Mission\" vibe put you off if you usually hate that stuff -- it was tasty, fun, and excellently priced!\n\nNow, on to the details:\n\nBeing an admirer of simple and endearing graphic design, I was initially pleased to see the adorable orange sign outside announcing Tacolicious with a taco icon in lieu of any actual text. I must say that given that I was navigating by street directions rather than an actual address, this initially caused me to pause and verify that I was indeed at the right spot, but my instincts proved to be right as this was in fact the elusive Tacolicious.\n\nDespite being initially impressed by the aforementioned endearing graphic design, I was subsequently quickly put off from this otherwise promising place by the hostess's unfortunate response of \"a little over an hour\" to my inquiry of how long the wait would be for a table for three. The questions and skepticism very rapidly crept into my mind and swiftly became disgust. More than an hour? For three people? On a Monday night??? You have got to be kidding me. There's not even any line outside! Now I remember why I hate the Mission! ...\n\nFortunately, despite my instinctual impulse to pull an immediate 180 and find another place for dinner because of my long list of previous experiences with restaurants that were COMPLETELY overrated once you took into account the more-than-an-hour wait, I was able to stop the runaway train of \"WTF!!?!\" going on in my head for long enough to at least politely agree to put my name on the list and wait in the adjacent bar (which I would soon learn to be Musto) in the meanwhile.\n\nWhile waiting in the bar, we decided to order a couple of appetizers from the bar menu to tide us over. Yum! We got three different things. I don't remember exactly what each of them were named. But all you need to know is that they were a) FAST, b) well-presented, c) tasty, and d) AT MOST, $3 each! In fact, I think that one was like $1.50. A dollar-fifty! You have got to be kidding me!\n\nFast forward, friends arrive (turns out we actually have a party of five people instead of three), seating time ends up being shortened considerably for both the initial party of three and the actual party of five (ends up being maybe a half-hour at most), we sit down, talk about how excited we are to get some grub, and order some food!\n\nFirst round: queso (yum!), guac (yum!). I also really liked the salsa -- lots of tasty mint in there that gives it a great, distinctive flavor. Next round: tacos! We ordered a batch of ten, with each of the five of us choosing two from their selection of ten different types. I got the braised short rib (yum!) and another meatasaurus one I don't remember the name of (also yum!).\n\nFast forward, we have a great time, server is fun, attentive, and friendly. Food was excellent, prices were fantastic, and the overall bill was a very pleasant surprise to all of us. Tacolicious, well done, I will be back!\n\nPros:\n* Tasty food\n* Cheap prices\n* Stylish digs\n* Wait not nearly as long as initially estimated\n* Adjacent to a tequila bar (you don't even have to step outside since the places are, like Stereo MCs, connected)\n\nCons:\n* No text on the sign outside\n* Probably risky if an earthquake of any magnitude hits while you're in the Mosto section, since the ceiling of that place is lined with small glass jars glued or epoxied to it, which certainly makes the place look cool, but is probably a death trap (but then again, I guess that describes a lot of the decor in the Mission)\n\n(Hopefully you note the sarcasm in these cons and realize that Tacolicious is a great place and that you should go there, like, soon!)\n\nThanks, Tacolicious!", "author": "Alison N."}

There's no better deal in the mission than the 10 tacos for $30 here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-15", "description": "I was around the mission yesterday and was trying to find a New Mexican place to eat at. So I yelped to see what was around and TACOLICIOUS popped up. I saw the reviews and decided to give it a try. I already knew this place was not going to be authentic buttt I heard good things about it so decided to go with that. I first walked in and you can see that there was no seating and there would be a bit of a wait. So the lady in front took my name down and said it would be at least a 15-20 min wait for 2. Ok that didn't sound too bad so we waited. literately as we walked in there was a massive of people who came storming in right after us. It was crazy because all of a sudden it got super busy. Anyway we were still waiting and I got a little impatient as I saw the group of 18 get seated. how the hell did they get seated and we got here way before they did. But oh well. Still waiting. so I had my girlfriend go ask how long the wait was going to be for a seat. She said another 15-20 min. Girrrrl you said that the first time. So we have been waiting for at least 30-40 min now. That's why I am giving this place 4 stars for the wait. I understand this place is popular and they have so many people to cater to but if there is a list that you put me on GO BY THAT LIST. Mind you this was at night time around 7-8pm. anyway we finally got seated outside. The waiter brought some chips and salsa out. OMG that salsa and chips was on point. The salsa tasted so fresh and so good. you can tell it was house made. Not spicy at all but had a hint of right zest. I love cilantro and you can taste the extractions of cilantros in the salsa. Mmmm we ordered the beef short rib taco and traditional carnitas tacos. 4 for $16. A little pricey but worth every taste for what it was. So much flavor in the meat. I liked the fact that when the tacos were brought out there was 3 types of salsas that came with it as well. Mild guac, medium, and habanero. I love choices and condiments. That's a plus everytime I have choices. We also had the queso cheese dip. that was also very delicious. Very creamy and thick full of peppers and veggies mixed in. Could not finish it since there was only two and it came in a bowl. We also ordered a pitcher of SANGRIA. $30 for a pitcher which will be 4 cups in total. one cup of sangria is about 9.50. So your at least getting one sangria free by ordering the pitcher that is if you will drink two cups each. At first I wasn't so sure how to feel about the sangria. I thought it was ok at first but the more I drank it I actually realllllly liked it. No that's not the alcohol just kicking it. It was actually this taste I didn't realize it had until a few sips later. it has a tad bit pico de gallo chili mixed in with a tiny hint of sweet but of course the wine was still there to overpower. Chili and sweet is something I am all for. Finished both glasses. I can't forget about our waitress. I loved her customer service. She was very attentive and came around when she needed to. I can tell by her body language that she was trying to check up on us but not interrupt our conversation we were having. I liked that because that shows she was being courteous as well in a shuttle way. anyway, I liked her patience in packing the left overs we had. I not only asked her once but twice to do it since we weren't done with our queso. but she seemed gladly to do it and came back with extra chips. I feel like that's how customer service should be. I had a good experience and I would reccomend this place to anyone only if you have time to wait a little.", "author": "Myphan L."}

No, we had to leave our names and slink off to the bar Mosto to waste an hour drinking margaritas until we were finally called.\n\nMosto felt like Hell on Earth. My version of Hell on Earth is struggling to find 2 bar seats while Michael Jackson is blaring at 200db and everyone nearby is screaming at one another. I pretty much lost my voice trying to talk to my girlfriend. Our bartender came off snobby to my girlfriend as she was puzzled why the food and drinks at Tacolicious were not available at Mosto. I sort of got it that they wanted to do things different in the bar but he pissed her off. The drink selection was overwhelming so we just went for the house margaritas. Although they were tasty I got no buzz. Also, the bartender ignored her $20 that she put down. Obviously hoping we would have to endure longer an keep buying.\n\nAfter about 45 minutes this b.s., I checked in with the 2 (!!) hostesses to see how much longer until we got a seat. They were rude to me and gave me a bunch of runaround. Nevertheless about 15 minutes later one did find me in the bar and we finally got to sit down for food!\n\nOur waitress seemed to be trained at Applebees as she was overly checking in on us. We were shell-shocked by this time. We finally made our food and drink decisions and I went to the bathroom. When I returned my girlfriend had her beets and a drink and I had nothing.

Next time I am getting an order all for myself!\n\nWe then got a selection of tacos to share - the butternut squash, rock cod, cochinita pibil (like carnitas but much better!) and bistec adobado.  You cannot go wrong with any of these, but the cochinita pibil was my favorite.\n\nThe space is lovely, every member of the staff was friendly and caring, and the space was bright, modern and welcoming.  Oh, and they have a huge selection of tequilas, so what more could you want?\n\nIn a neighborhood where there is literally a taco place on every corner (and more than a few in between), Tacolicious stands out as something new, accessible, affordable, and....say it with me...TACOLICIOUS!", "author": "Liz S."}

The \"chili con queso\" from the \"Side\" portion menu also lacked oomph.  The description on the menu for this item reads \"sustainable? no. local? nope. delicious? yep\". The last description should be \"delicious? only if you like 7-11 pump nacho cheese\".\n\nWhile Tacolocious will be a success, it clearly caters to a particular crowd, but given its location, it does need to lose its Marina District vibe, which caters to those seeking to spend stock sale gains for more atmosphere than authentic tacos, I would also lose the salad name \"Marina Girl\" , which is a little offensive to the neighborhood.  To pay homage to the new location and the great Dolores Park mural in the patio, perhaps call it \"Hipster Hill\" salad, as some call the sunny section of Dolores Park.

First of all, no burritos on the menu. Second, they use local organic and naturally raised meats. Third, they put together a space that is inviting, comfortable, family friendly, and fun. You'll pay more for these tacos, but personally I don't mind it for a well prepared meal in an enjoyable environment.\n\nMy favorite tacos are the cod, carnitas, and short rib. I always try their special of the week; sometimes they do a shrimp taco, which is awesome. The corn tortillas they get from La Palma are fluffy and delicious. They use two tortillas per taco and stuff them with toppings. I'd say a person with a normal appetite would get full with 3-4 of them. There's also a lot of appetizers to choose from. I usually get their guacamole to go with the chips, and the grilled squid is excellent. They make their own churros too, if you have room for dessert. \n\nThey have a nice side patio for nice afternoons.  The mural of Mission High School and the SF skyline by Paul Madonna is pretty neat. You can find funny and thoughtful phrases hidden throughout the piece. The bar Mosto next door is also part of the establishment. The thousands of jars on the ceiling have little knick-knacks stowed away inside. Their house margaritas are pretty good. But the bar also has an enormous selection of tequilas. I usually just go with a Negra Modelo on tap.\n\nI made several visits and found that the only time it isn't busy is when it opens at 11:30am. Then again, their kitchen is already cranking out catering orders by that time. In the evenings the bar is also totally packed with people waiting for a table. It's unfair to knock a restaurant for being crowded, since it's a sign that they're doing something right to attract and satisfy customers. Too bad they don't take reservations for small parties (only 12 or more).", "author": "Jermaine R."}

A taco restaurant imported from the Marina HAS TO be bad, right? Maybe it was the tequila, but after our first bite into the tacos, we realized that hating it was going to be out of the question.\n\nHip atmosphere inside, with a great bar right next door, where we grabbed drinks and waited for our table. Went for the specialty cocktails which proved to be a good choice. The guacamole was sadly the lowest point of the meal. Not super flavorful, and not chunky enough for my tastes, however the portion they send out is generous.\n\nEach of us tried the 4 fo $14 tacos. I tried the carnitas and the braised short rib tacos, which were flavorful and filling. The butternut squash taco was a new experience for me, one which I wholeheartedly enjoyed. The weekly taco was a delicious blend of onions and potatoes. Overall a surprisingly yummy dining experience!", "author": "Geno B."}

I think I waited 2 hours to get into a screening of Star Wars one time. Anyway, that night, we decided to go elsewhere. Today we go there a little after 1 and got seated right away even though the place was a little busy.\n\nI got the 4 tacos deal: 2 rock cod, 1 carnitas, and 1 short rib. We all got the same deal, so when the tacos were delivered they all came on long plates broken up by type. The carnitas and the short rib tacos were super delicious and had a lot of meat packed into a small package (that's what she said!) while the rock cod taco was too greasy and I ended up not eating one of mine. Everybody was in agreement over the fish taco and one of my other dining companions ate a chorizo potato taco which he said was great. SO, stick with the meat I guess. They start you off with chips and salsa which are the thick kind of chips with not too much salt and a medium heat salsa. Yummy!\n\nTacolicious is a cute restaurant which is a little on the small side, but does have seating outside as well as inside.

Not a tequila fan but the bartender was nice enough to make a fruity rum concoction for me. \n\nFour tacos for $13 - not a bad deal. One for $3.95 & 10 for $30 also, I believe.\n\nNow the one thing that I would say REALLY sets Tacolicious apart from ANY other mexican/latin restos in the mission - and this is really big in my book, because i loooooove this item - THEY SERVE A BEER-BATTERED FISH TACO. In fact, if I hadn't passed by and seen that one thing on the menu, I might've kept walking. \n\nThat's right, folks. Now if I want to be healthier and super cheap and order a grilled albeit much more lackluster fish taco for $3, I can do that at Pancho Villa (and a few other spots), which I have long been doing. BUT there are no beer-battered fish tacos in the mission, people, i'm telling you!!! I have searched far and wide. As far as that goes, Tacolicious has a corner on the market. And they were right up there with some of the best I've had (As much as I hate to admit this, I love Rubios!!!!) \n\nCrowd was, as some have mentioned, a little more \"dressed\" than you might see at some neighboring spots (my boyfriend wore a track suit to dinner and felt a little under dressed).

We put our name on the waitlist and checked out the bar attached next door while we waited.  Our table was finally ready after we downed a carafe of Vino.\n\nThe chips and salsa were probably the best part of the meal.  We went through at least 4-5 baskets of the deliciously fried tortilla chips.  We also ordered the guac to start off, and it was heavenly!  Some of the best guac I've had recently.\n\nWe ordered two of the 10 tacos for $31.  We ordered 4 each of:\n-Fried local rock cod: best of the bunch.  a large fried portion of fish goodness.  You've got to order this!\n-Shot-and-a-beer braised chicken: a tad on the salty side, but my second favorite.\n-Cochinita pibil: honestly not very memorable\n-Traditional carnitas: a tad on the salty side too.\n\nThe taco's were a little too meaty for my taste.  Each taco was piled high with meat.  So you can't complain that they skimp on the meat.  However, I prefer my tacos with more of a balanced meat-to-salsa/veggie-ratio.\n\nThe butternut squash sounded intriguing, but my vote was vetoed, so I'd be willing to give Tacolicious another go to try some of the other tacos.\n\nThe interior of this place was cool and typical of Mission's new and hip eateries.  Lots of wood and metal adorn this shoppe.  The lighting is low and casual.  Fun place to come with friends. \n\nThe taco's were just alright, so rather than call this place Tacolicious, I'd call it Taco-ok.  If you are looking for authentic Mexican street tacos, keep searching, because you won't find them here.  This place is more like fushion-mex.

It is not a gringo taco haven, but I am definitely missing some of the enjoyable elements of ordering a good street taco like not having to wait 1.5 hours for a table.  \n\nOn one hand, they have some decent menu choices, and the price is right.  On the other hand, the food could have been so much higher in quality.  Case in point, the fish taco was pretty much a taco stuffed with soggy filet o' fish like textured fish.  The squid veracruz smelled kind of fishy.  My meat tacos were pretty solid and nicely portioned, and I would probably stick to those.  Also, the waitress lumped our orders together (we had a table of five and ordered the max amount of tacos).  So it was not a bad deal.\n\nOverall, I am lukewarm about this place and actually prefer Nopalito for my high end street taco fare.", "author": "Liaty Z."}

There are 8 taco choices, but unfortunately only one is vegetarian.  Some day, we will have more than 12.5% representation on omnivore menus, but I digress.\n\nThe waiter was super nice, but it seems like they're still working out some kinks, so if you're very particular about service, you may want to wait a while.  For example, we ordered tacos, the beet salad, and the plantains --- the tacos came out right away, then the salad about 20 minutes later, then the plantains a few minutes after that.  Kind of a weird order.  I also asked for the veg tacos to be separated from my friend's meat-filled ones, but they came out together, and I had to pretend I didn't notice the tortillas for my tacos soaking up the meat juices from hers.  Drinks were kind of slow as well (but really good).      \n\nIn short, definitely worth trying if you're in the mood to splurge on tacos and margaritas.

None of us had been here before and we just told her to hook us up with 12 of her favorite tacos, and she didn't hesitate and went for it.\n\nI have to say, the tacos were very good but the different meat ones all kind of tasted the same.

The meat was nice, and well seasoned. They infused a bit of spearmint into the meatball, which always makes for good flavour, and is sometimes overlooked. The only thing that was different (not in a bad way though) was that they used a tomato sauce to cover the albondigas, instead of making it into a soup. \n\nA bonus: They also have a great tequila and mezcal selection. The descriptions they give are pretty spot on, so it's a good guide to go by.\n\nDefinitely plan to follow the orange and white taco and go back one of these days.", "author": "Victor R."}

As I walked in I envisioned a completely different restaurant, you know your typical taqueria. Instead I got a sit down restaurant, dim lights with a huge bar table in place of your typical food station.  \n\nThey start you off with their complimentary chips, crisp and salted perfectly to go with their awesome chunky salsa. I wanted to try all of their tacos, saw 4 for $13 option, but ahhh what the hell, let's order all 8 for $26. Came out to be the best decision because each taco was \"the Freak-in-licious.\" Not a veggie person, but even my least favorite of the bunch, the butternut squash was still tasty. My taco of choice of course is the \"chicken en mole colorado,\" soft tender chicken mole with crumbled cheese on top. Let's not forget the 3 levels of hot sauce with the hottest sauce being a late creeper, you'll see what I'm talking about. In general I can confidently say you won't be disappointed in any taco you really order, trust me I had all 8 on one order so I know. Thanks FreeeaaaKKKKKKK.", "author": "Limuel G."}

Well this was my first time at the actual location I have only tastes their food at events or outside venues. It is situated at a nice place in Valencia and the great thing that it has a nice patio outside of the restaurant. Their menu is simple but gives a lot of varieties on what to eat. The best thing was to have a bunch of tacos and be able to mix and match them. My girlfriend and me ordered the 10 tacos for $33 which was well worth it we got our moneys worth and be able to take it home what we could not finish. The carnitas is always good and the chicken beer marinated was good as well it had such a unique taste. I also liked the display that they had when our order of tacos came out and told us the difference between the three salsas they had for the tacos. The beer selection is also great as well.

But seriously folks, if you're traveling to the Mission to have a taco, you should have a Mission taco, not a Valencia taco.\n\nThat said, I was actually not super impressed by my taco.  It was good, but the least good part of the meal.  I am a vegetarian so I'll just assume that all the meat tacos are much more delicious.  The chips and salsa are really good though, as are the empanadas.  We also had the plaintains, which were a little dry, but the cumin crema was delish, though I object to the fancy smear of beans on the plate - not visually appealing to me.

I think we were lucky and beat the crowd as I noticed people that came in after us had to wait for over 30 minutes (unfortunately, they don't take reservations). They a nice seating outside as well, which is great for a warm evening (warm for San Francisco anyways).\n\nAs soon as we were seated, they gave us fresh hot chips with salsa that wasn't too spicy and that could fancy most people's tastes. They had a great selection of house specialty cocktails and a bar with more of the regular drinks as well. Considering the name of the place, we of course had to try their tacos! They have a taco-of-the-week thing where they switch out the main ingredient for the each week. This week's was a shrimp and cilantro taco. This taco wasn't bad, but it wasn't as particular as I imagined it. What hit the spot was their traditional carnitas taco. The meat was very well seasoned, hot off the stove, and tender to the bite. In addition, their guacamole was delicious! It's only made to order so you don't have to worry about the guacamole having been sitting there too long. Fresh, rich, and creamy.", "author": "Kerri L."}

After impatiently waiting and eating stupid healthy in order to justify this meal, I finally went to Tacolicious. I ordered a mere four tacos (two fried cod, one butternut squash and one short rib), when really I probably only needed two. But I just couldn't care. They were just plain and simple delicious tacos (ha! I think that's where they got the name) and not overdone at all. \n\nThe queso, described on the menu as, \"sustainable? no. local? nope. delicious? yep.\" pretty much blew my mind. Growing up in Texas, I became quite fond of this semi-fake spicy cheese dip and since moving to California, a bit of a healthier state, queso has made very few appearances in my life. But anyways, it really was perfect in every way: the consistency, the chunks of vegetables and peppers in it, the right amount of spice... plus I discovered that dipping the tacos into the queso was a complete game-changer and a totally brilliant idea. \n\nThe service was awesome.

First of all, due to the music being played too loud so that everyone had to yell their conversations, the restaurant was almost unbearably loud inside!

The best part of the meal was the yummy rice and beans, but for a place that's famous for tacos, that may not be a good thing.  I got the \"shot and a beer braised chicken\" taco, and the chorizo and potato taco.  The chorizo taco was ok, but the chicken taco was not so good ... I took one bite and handed it over to my friend.  For dessert, we got a \"chocolicious taco\" which is basically one of those ChocoTaco ice cream treats that you can buy at 7-11 for $1, only this one was $7.  We also got a couple of cocktails, the Mucho Gusto was pretty good, and the Berry Good was ok.  \n\nAll in all, I'd say the food is decent, but I probably won't be back - it's too overpriced and I didn't enjoy the atmosphere.", "author": "Lauren S."}

I wished they had some ice since it was such a warm day and the water turned into room temperature. My friend and I ordered the 4 for $14 taco deal. We ordered 2 tacos with cod, 1 taco with traditional carnitas, and 1 taco with the chicken. Our food came pretty quickly! The cod was both our favorites. It tasted super good with the yellow colored hot sauce and some lemon juice squeezed on top. I had the traditional carnitas and it was alright. The texture was kind of dry. My friend had the chicken and she also said it was alright. We couldn't believe how filling 2 small looking tacos were! We left satisfied and super filled up. :-)", "author": "Angel H."}

I love their plantain presentation over refried beans, and their carnitas tacos are on point. Try the passion margaritas, they have a hint of spice but are perfect if you like mangos. Their regular margaritas are just as good, they're not chinchy with the tequila so that's nice. Their list of tacos is a little bit short of my expectations considering the restaurant has \"TACO\" in its name, but whatevs. If you're going for dinner be prepared to wait a little while because its a popular spot.

We got there after 8:00 PM and since they don't take reservations there was a 2 hour wait! We scored seats at the bar while we waited. Fortunately, others probably got discouraged with the long wait so we probably got seated after 45 minutes to an hour.\n\nThe drinks menu looked amazing but I was unsure about what to try. The bartender suggested one of the House Cocktails: El Rey (brugal rum, manzano peppers, guava, lime, pom juice...$9.50). It was very good, but I was disappointed by the fact it was served in a small glass with too much ice. I feel like I paid more for the ice than for the yummy concoction! I later ordered the T-lish Spicy Beer (Tecate, chili vinegar, lime, salt...$4). This was a very good twist on the Chavela/Michelada type of drink. BTW, although not on the menu they serve complimentary chips and salsa.\n\nWhen we were seated for our late night dinner, we settled on an order of the tacos...10 for $31. This allowed the five of us to order two tacos each. Unfortunately, after devouring those two tacos we still felt hungry. Thus, another round of 10 tacos were ordered. I chose two \"shot-and-a-beer braised chicken\" (good) and later two \"bistec adobado with pickled onions (amazing...$1 extra each). The tacos are served with three types of salsas, which I liked.\n\nI enjoyed my first time here, not so much for the drinks and food, but more for the fun experience with friends. The place seems kind of small and overpriced. Cause even for the 10 tacos special, you're paying $3-$4 per taco. Being a San Jose native where there's taquerias everywhere with really good tacos, that is a pretty absurd price for tacos. It's obvious you're also paying for the ambiance and location.\n\nI suggest a one time visit will suffice.", "author": "Perla A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-12", "description": "Despite being surrounded by taquerias, Tacolicious is a nice addition to the Mission food landscape.  The key here seems to be better quality ingredients.  This means you don't have to eat here at 1 in the morning  after 5+ drinks to find delicious it delicious (I'm pointing at you El Faralito).  They definitely don't neglect your desire to get drunk and eat tacos though.  They have probably the best selection of Tequila in the city (state too?), good margaritas, as well as offering a few traditional cheap hipster beers.  Further reinforcement of this mission is provided by the Prix Fix menu of 1 taco, 1 tecate, and 1 shot of tequila (el jimador) for $10.\n\nThough we were lucky and got a quick table we did wait probably 20-30 minutes before our waitress showed up.  She was friendly and attentive once she found us but still this seems a long time to wait.  During this wait time we ate our way through 2 baskets of chips and a couple or rounds of water, so it wasn't like we were completely ignored.  \n\nTheir salsas were interesting and slightly unique.  It seems like there might be mint in the salsa they serve with their chips, which was actually quite delicious.  The three salsas served with the tacos were all good, though I wish there \"hot\" salsa had a bit more kick.  The braised short-rib tacos were succulent and well flavored.  Rock fish was fried to perfection in those tacos. They even have nice vegetarian tacos.  Despite being a sit down place, with a much cleaner and classier vibe then other taquerias, a meal here doesn't have to break the bank either.  I'd definitely be back for sober day-time taco eating but who knows where I'd end up if I had a few more drinks in me.", "author": "Paul T."}

You can't go wrong with tacos and tequila!\n\nFirst off, the restaurant is connected to the tequila bar, so starting the night off with a drink is time well spent.  The hostess was great about checking in with us and we were seated well before the end of our 45 min wait time.\n\nSecond off, the food is pretty damn delicious.  My go-tos are the Queso to share, and Carnitas and Cod tacos.  I tried the guacamole this time, but it looks better than it tastes. Sure, you can find a better deal for tacos a block away but I appreciate Tacolicious' commitment to hormone free meats and sustainable foods.   \n\nAnd finally, you can't beat the atmosphere.  Every once in a while, it's nice to go to a restaurant where you have to use your outdoor voice to talk to the people around you.  It's so rowdy here, you can surely let loose after a long work week.  I already told my best friend I'm planning her birthday here! Can't wait!    \n\nTEQUILA!", "author": "Helen V."}

The dark earth-toned walls are sparsely decorated with a selection of old-school juicers.  There are a couple TVs, but they were turned off while we were there, not sure how often they're in use.\nThe open kitchen in the middle is wonderfully tempting to walk past and drool over all the tubs of deliciousness - the albondigas meatballs, the pulled pork, the short ribs...\n\nAnyway, the main reason you're here is because you want Mexican food with margaritas - a combination the Mission is in frightfully short supply of.  So let's get to it.\nYeah... we didn't get any margaritas on our first trip, heh.  But the 4 cocktails we tried were all quite tasty!\nThe roasted butternut squash appetizer is cold, so don't be startled by this like we were, but it's a nice combination of flavors & textures.\nOf the tacos, the real winners are the short rib (which is just wonderful), the mole colorado chicken (which isn't strongly mole-flavored, but is juicy and tender), and the carnitas.  The shot & a beer chicken was a little dry.\n\nBut let's be honest - they're not really trying to compete with traditional tacos.  There are a million other places within 5 blocks that will do those better.  So order the things you can't get in a taqueria, and enjoy being able to drink margaritas, cocktails, and tequila (from their wonderfully large selection) with your Mexican food.\n\nAnd they're open until midnight!", "author": "Don H."}

It's definitely been watered down for an American palate.  This time, even though I don't really eat chicken, I tried the chicken mole colorado taco at the recommendation of Telmo, just to prove I'm not high-maintenance! It was pretty good, but seemed watered down (not a thick, rich, smoky mole at all, and yes, I know there are other kinds, but it did leave me wishing it was a little richer). The saving grace was the queso, and I'm pretty sure that was imported, at least as far as from La Palma... \n\nI also ordered the guacamole, which, while made with nice ripe avocados, was basically avocado and cilantro. I loaded on some of the haba\u00f1ero salsa (which, incidentally, isn't super spicy, so don't be shy trying it even if you don't normally like spicy stuff) to perk it up a bit and it was tasty that way. \n\nAlso, no self-respecting Mission chick is going to order the \"Marina Girl Salad\" (well actually my friend did, but she lives in Oakland so it doesn't count). I highly suggest re-naming that one \"Hipster Greens\" or some such. Apparently it's pretty yummers.\n\nMy other friend ordered the special Chile Verde taco of the month, and that was good enough. Again, high quality fresh-tasting ingredients, just lacking that extra kick.\n\nNow let's move on to the drinks. We all ordered margaritas. They were a little sweeter than a typical Mexican margarita, but they went down EASY and they were potent. Waitstaff was good about asking our subsequent margaritas to be made with less sweetener. 5 stars. Looking forward to trying out some of the other variations and Tequilas. Really looking forward. Buying stock in Tylenol. \n\nAnddd last but not least, Churros y chocolate. The churros were truly as they should be. Piping hot fresh from the fryer, liberally sprinkled with azucar y canela. They were still tender in the middle, as they should be. The chocolate dipping sauce was also a bit watered down compared to the thick richness I've encountered in Spain and parts of Mexico, but it was flavorful. I pretty much annihilated those churros. Sharing is overrated. Aww yeah, I'll have to run double-time tomorrow. Ouch.\n\nI'll be back, and still really hoping to upgrade to 4 stars. I want to love the food MOAR. You can do it!!

I mean, it is the Mission area, right?  The wait was what it was, a wait.  The place is a decent size and offered a small outdoor area and of course indoor.  Uniquely was connected to another bar which was convenient for waiting purposes.\n\nWe were seated at the bar.  Bartender/server was peculiar in character but again, we are in San Francisco! As first timers, we were excited and eager to try everything.  We decided to get 10 tacos for $31.  We had the cod, the carnitas, the vegetarian selection, braised beef and the chicken en mole all x2. along with the plantains. Plantains were a disappointment.  Tacos were good but only fell in love with the braised beef and lusted over the cod.\n\nAmbiance was pleasant but goodness was it loud in there!  Certainly not a place for an intimate dinner.\n\nOn a final note, I know I made mention the bartender/server was peculiar but he did take the beer and sangria (which wasn't all that good either) off our tab as he felt he should've warned us that the 10 tacos was a large order.\n\nWouldn't really come back unless forced.

I am as high maintenance as a customer can get and she passed all of my tests with flying colors. For instance, I ordered a drink that turned out to be too sour (for me). When I asked for sweetener, she offered agave syrup (which this high maintenance diner hates). Apparently, since they don't serve coffee here, that was the only choice of sweetener available to customers....so she offered to bring me another drink. When I said that I would be happiest with just some plain sugar to add to my drink, she went into the kitchen, asked the cook for some and brought a small dish of sugar...which did the trick. My satisfaction was her primary goal...and I was satisfied. \n\nBesides for bringing the sugar for my drink, she took our order promptly, the food arrived quickly and she checked back with us several times, joking-around and conversing with us just enough to be simply DELIGHTFUL! I will remember my server's name and will ask for her the next time I dine there....and did I mention that the food was great too?", "author": "Art B."}

Were seated immediately in a packed restaurant, but it's really not a restaurant - it's a BAR with some table tops crowded together on a wall. The servers, are not servers. It's difficult to tell what anyone is, the customer service was terrible. Dozens of \"food runners\" ? Just walking around in a tizzy shoving plates on your table. After being seated, we waited for several minutes before finally being approached by a very thin twenty-something that didn't crack a smile and spoke to us in whispers (in an extremely loud bar setting). They were out of pozole (the dish we drove there for), so we settled on a salad, a shrimp dish, and some tacos. Despite the full bar behind us, we were not asked if we'd like to drink anything, instead our little waif rushed off and avoided eye contact with us for the rest of our dinner. We ended up with some lousy romaine and brown avocado salad, pretty decent tacos, and an AWFUL dish that was some concoction of shrimp in bad marinara sauce. The worst part of it all was that no one tried to make up for the lack of service, not even our \"server\". In total, four different people brought plates to our tiny table and shoved them in front of us without a word, we spent half our meal arranging things on the table so it would all fit. \nHave no idea what the other locations are like, but if this one on Valencia is any indication, I will never return to Tacolicious.", "author": "Desiree R."}

I set it up so there would be enough drinks for the entire night but they said we hit our limit right after we ate. I find this hard to believe as the amount of money I put down means everyone at the party drank there own pitcher of margaritas. Also they charged 5% for using the back room that wasn't exclusively ours.  Swindling people for a little money is pretty low. \n\nFood was standard tacoliscious but $30 per person for three tacos, guac and some burnt churros is too much. The pitchers of margaritas are mainly ice which for $40 a pitcher is ridiculous.  I didn't know ice was that expensive.  After the whole thing the girl serving us asked for a bigger tip...really...I guess pouring margaritas is harder than it looks.", "author": "Greg S."}

After taking our appetizer order our waitress disappeared. Eventually another waitress noticed us waiting and asked if we wanted to order more food.\nWe ordered two chicken tacos, one fish taco, and one carnitas taco, as well as a margarita. \nThe tacos and margarita were delivered quickly. The carnitas taco was absolutely delicious and kind of sweet. The chicken taco was alright but a little spicy. My boyfriend said the fish tasted very fresh.\nThe margarita was alright, but kind of small and not as sweet as I like my margaritas. \nI found the prices to be rather expensive for the small amount of food we got. the empanadas were $10 for two small empanadas. The margarita was $11. The tacos were 4 for $16, but it was really just some meat on a tortilla with chopped onion and cilantro. \nOverall I think you end up paying for the atmosphere, not the food.

But first, the good news...\n\nService and ambience at this place are second to none.  Most of the time, when I go out in La Mission, servers and bartenders, and sometimes even the owners, act like I should be grateful they are letting me eat or drink in their establishment (similar to the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld).   \n\nBut at Tacolicious, I was treated like someone special from the moment I opened the door to the way out after our extended meal.  These people know how to treat customers in every way.  They act like they WANT you there and are excited that you picked their place.  It feels good.\n\nThe ambience and physical space are cozy and inviting; it makes you want to stay and order more and more drinks, even after you've finished your meal.\n\nThe food is okay.  Actually, I had the Marina Girl salad last night, and it was excellent.  The lettuce was crisp and it wasn't overloaded with unneeded ingredients -- just romaine lettuce (again, only the crispy parts, not the hard-to-get-your-mouth-around enormous leaves), pepitas, some kind of queso, jicama, and a bit of avocado.  And it wasn't overly dressed, just a touch of something nice, I don't even remember what.\n\nOn a different visit, I had the squash and the fish tacos, and while they were good, they seemed to lack some kind of flavor.  I couldn't put my finger on it.  I mean, food tastes good to us depending on what we're used to, and I am used to places like Pancho Villa, where I can really taste what I like to call \"traditional Mexican Mission food.\"\n\nEither way, I'll be back to this place.  It's a wonderful spot for lunch or a nice relaxed dinner.", "author": "Janie A."}

This place is not a mexican taqueria but instead more of an upscale taco place.  I mean would a mexican restaurant serve short ribs?  My favorite dish by far was the the tuna costada.  In terms of tacos I actually liked  the pastor the best from the bar next door.  \n\n\nMy only problem with this  place is the lack of identity.  At tacko in cow hollow  you  know the deal, you order up front get a number and then get your  tacos.  This place, for a two person table was a 45 minute wait. There was also no place to wait so I asked to leave my number and the hostess said no.  She then suggested we sit at the bar.  What she did not tell us was that the bar was completely separate from the restaurant.  For example, Sangria was served in the restaurant but not bar and menu was completely different. As a result, my party and I were kind of forced to have drinks we were not into and get appetizers that were not our first choice.  By the time our hostess called us we were already full.  My other major complaint was that at the restaurant there were no real seats.  We had short bar stools and I had to hold my coat in my lap as I ate.  So I go back to my original  question what is the identity?  Good quality restaurant food however this place does not have its own bar, waiting area, hostess that calls you, coat check, or anything near comfortable seating. If they can fix this  I think this would be an amazing place.  As a result  I would have to give the edge to  Tacko in cow hollow.\n\nFinally the chicken sirachi cole slaw taco was okay but not great.  The rest were great.\n\nFood 4 Stars\nValue 3 Stars\nAtmosphere 2 Stars\nService 4 Stars", "author": "Christopher T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-16", "description": "In general, I am a BIG fan of Tacolicious. The food is delicious-- especially the carnitas tacos, the mussels, and the salads-- and the drinks are yummy. \n\nMy husband, son (4.5 years old) and I eat lunch here most Saturdays, and as a parent, I also appreciate how family friendly they USUALLY are, without going into crazy-suburbia-kidville.\n\nMy son is well behaved, and I've noticed that all the other kids (there are usually 1-2 other tables with kids at lunch time are too, and none of the kids are being ipad/iphone babysat, either- just good kids eating normal, non-fried/kid-ized food. \n\nThe kid menu (that ISN'T full of fried crap), doubles as a coloring book (for a taco truck! so cute). The kid's fare is quesadillas, chicken tacos, or fish tacos, all served with small sides of rice and refried beans, plus and agua fresco-- my son eats EVERYTHING, every time. And his food always comes first, almost immediately. And on Monday nights they donate a portion of the till to local mission schools. \n\nBut, the last 2 times we've been there, the waitress has tried to put us in the back (with the LOUD music, and no nice mural to look at)-- even though there was room in the front. This Saturday She let us stay in the front, after we commented on the music-- she had given us some lame \"I'm running low on two tops\" excuse, even tho there were 3 open and no line. After a while we realized she was seating every single family with kids in the back (2 others came in)-- even though there was plenty of room up front. \n\nOur service was terrible, too-- usually it is great. I couldn't figure out if the reason out tacos didn't come until my son WAS DONE WITH HIS WHOLE LUNCH was because the waitresses were stretched running to the back room (usually no one is in there)..... or another reason.  Did no one offer me a drink refill because they were too busy (the restaurant was half full)? Try to clear my plate (I'll box that up for you!) when I hadn't  even eaten 1 taco just because they were that confused? Or are families no longer welcome here? No problem, it's off my list for a while. Families, be forewarned.\n\nStill giving it a 2 'cause the food is a 4.5.", "author": "kate h."}

Ordering beer at the bar, we are laughing and enjoying the late night beer inspired witticisms when boom- a tumbler lands on our glasses, sending beer flying, glasses shattering to the floor.  This happens, ok so we got some beer on us, whatever.  That bartender was cute and apologetic.  I ask the other bartender to replace my friend's beer that was splattered into oblivion and he does immediately and asks if we need anything else.  I say a gin and ginger, what my friend was drinking.  The one who made the mistakes also treats us to some shots, which is appropriate.  \nUntil the bill comes.  I just handed them my card thinking i was paying for the tacos I ordered later, but nope, the beer and gin drink were there as well.  We had already paid for the beer they spilled all over us, and now we were paying for the replacement?  \nSo I should check bills before just paying for them, yep, got it. \nStill, we were super chill and nice about everything, and you can't even replace what you spilled.

Last night is the last time we'll be eating at tacolicious, due to the rude staff, sub par food, and long wait.  With so many great places (and great MEXICAN) places to eat within 2 blocks, this place needs a serious overhaul.  \n\nAs a party of 3 we were told we had a 30 min wait.  Okay.  We went to the bar to have a drink.  The bartender was nice enough, but the drinks were bad (paloma and margarita).  For the next 1.5 hours, as we sip our weird drinks, we watch as table after table of parties of 2 are seated.  Really, how hard would it be to pull up another chair to a 2 top?  When my boyfriend complained after 3 times the amount of time that he had been told we would wait (hi, we're still here...), the hostess literally decompensated, yelled at him, and then threatened HIM with the manager!  Great, I'm sure that the manager is doing an excellent job here when that's your go-to as a threat.  Immediately we get seated, and the manager hounds us to the table (should we feel like guilty students?).\n\nThe manager is really the worst part here.  I'm sure your job is stressful and busy.  But your JOB is to at least listen to the complaints of your customers and try to be sympathetic and accommodating, if not to try to change things for future customers and the viability of the place that employs you.  Its clear that she and the hostess are BFFs, and everything we were saying was falling on deaf ears.  She had clearly already decided that we were entirely in the wrong.  She made an incredibly fake apology for the wait time while in the same breath basically refuting the apology by defending the hostess and the restaurant seating policy.  Then she got this threatening tone in her voice and said \"you still sound unhappy\".  At this point, we just wanted to eat, and leave.  Obviously the enjoyability of the night was a little bruised.  We didn't catch her name, but she had a piercing through her lower lip and tattoos down her right arm, with brown hair.  \n\nThe food was fine, but really, its not amazing, and if you have to fend off the snide service staff to get it, it quickly looses its appeal.  The poor waitress had clearly been told we were trouble makers and went to defense mode with waitressing 101 (hi my name is... and I'll be serving you tonight\"  \"please let me repeat your order to you\").  She was actually fine, but its clear that there is a huge problem with over reacting, knee jerk judgements, and poor quality service leading up to telling the waitress to handle us with kid gloves, when all we asked is why we were still sitting around 3x past when we were supposed to be seated.  \n\nAny comp? No.  Real apology? No.  Do I think anything made it through, or will be changed for other customers?

It was already in full swing & I was excited about trying their food. They have indoor & outdoor patio seating. If your a party is more than 4 it seems like you might want to make a reservation. I also noticed that they have a room in the rear of the restaurant that is nice & could be reserved for a private party or intimate setting. This place is rocking & rolling. I watched the crew as i ate my insanely scrumptious short rib tacos. They seem to do a lot of togo orders. The counter tops were lined with brown paper bags with handles waiting to be claimed by Tacolicious fans . The area where the line cooks are is very organized. When the food comes to the counter it is immediately dressed by someone & served. Even if there is something on your plate that you don't want ( for me , dairy ) they don't make a fuss . They just fix it. The chips that you receive on the table with a bowl of salsa are really good. But , VERY SALTY ! Everyone seemed happy and the place is ran like a well oiled machine. There are handsome men in jeans and colorful shirts floating amongst the sea of black shirted staff & Tacolicious fans overseeing everything that transpires. I felt as if in a dream as i devoured those tacos & sipped on a Mia . I didn't even care as the sauce dripped down my chin. The food bill was $18.00 , but with city mandate charge for staff medical & taxes & tip it was $22.36 . See you there next time !", "author": "Angela G."}

The taco of the week was my favorite, but it was last week's so why bother telling you about it? It's gone. \n\nChorizo burnt, chicken mole good, shot and a beer braised chicken good, conchita pibil good, rock cod greasy and not-so-good, carnitas ok, bistec abodado and short rib made my significant person very happy but not so much me. Which earned me points for letting her finish them both. \n\nWe sat in the alley. There is a mural of the city with little sentences on it.

Harrison and Jeff were very attentive and both did a good job of providing excellent service and friendly conversation.  If you are from San Diego, Harrison will pick up on your So Cal accent!   For drinks, I had the \"pasion\"  It was perfect; the right amount of spicy with habanero infused tequila and tart with passion fruit juice.  I've ordered spicy margaritas before at other venues as well as jalapeno infused drinks but usually they aren't spicy enough. This one was perfect.  and free chips and salsa!  For food, many recommend the guajillo short rib tacos and for good reason.  The meat was tender and flavorful and they don't skimp on the amount in the taco.  If you wanted to share with a friend, you could easily divide the taco in two since they give you two corn tortillas.  Having lived in Mexico, I would say that these tacos are fairly authentic.  They may be a little artisan, but the flavors are traditional Mexican.  The rice was delightful; with a little chutney on top to give it a kick.  It tasted more like Indian green chutney than salsa.  The refried beans were okay; they were served lukewarm and were a little too thick for me.  I personally like Rubio's style refried beans which are different.  The fish taco was tasty, with a nice cumin seasoned cabbage on top.  Again, service at the bar was great so if you can't get a table you might have a better experience sitting at the bar.", "author": "SanJoseSun D."}

I can't tell the difference, and every dish look pretty good, smells nice, sure...\n\nAnyway, I'll come back, but would never suggest, because it doesn't really punch the flavors.  For example, the al pastor tacos really aren't that bad, they're just not real tacos (you need to have a lime slice nearby, a piece of pineapple, etc.).  Albondigas are okay, especially if you've never had them before.  The small plates...\n\nThere's nothing that isn't fair, good..  The servers are all very nice.  It's just that this is for the American palate, and the reason it does brisk business--is because it has a full bar, and a slick environment (really, there are only a handful of urbanite spots in SF where you can get a good shot of whiskey and a taco...)\n\nSo, go check it out.  It's a serious destination spot for folks, and the bar can make some people feel claustrophobic.

Neither of us had been before so we looked forward to this experience. When we arrived most of the tables were full but we were seated immediately, menus were already on the table and within a few minutes our charming server introduced herself and asked us for our drink order. I was expecting the typical Mexican beer list, margaritas/ wine etc but was surprised to see the extensive Margarita list with unique items on it like the \"Pasion\" Margarita which turned out to be our servers fave drink. If you want a taste, they have a series of 4 small drinks  called \"Chupitos\" which are samples of the Margaritas, we decided to order one and split it. The first drink got my attention, very smooth and warming, almost like when eat spicy chili but more soothing, a very different margarita experience to say the least.\n\nOur server also told us that it's all about the tacos so I decided to have the Butternut squash and the rock cod. All four of our tacos were beautiful works of culinary art. The tacos are a good size, they fit perfectly in the palm of your hand. I loved the multiple layers of flavor's that each bite brought. You can order just 1, or 4 or 10. \n\nWe finished up by sharing the Churro's with chocolate which were authentic, for a few moments I was back in Spain !\n\nOur bill for two came to $36 so for under $20 each with tax and tip, Tacolicious is a great start to a fun Friday night.\n\nI would absolutely come here again and can't wait to bring my friends for a round of pasion margaritas and tacos!\n\nThank's Tacolicious for an awesome dining experience!", "author": "David P."}

The tables are cramped and tiny yet it's impossible to hear the person sitting across from you. I'm not a fan of screaming through my dinner. Due to the small table size I think they need to be more attentive to bussing the tables especially clearing out empty glasses and refreshing water.\n\nThey have a huge back room and it should be better utilized to spread people out a little bit.

B made sure the food runner brought water and chips & salsa at the same time so we couldn't be to bothered by her tardiness. I guess at that point \"thank you for your patience\" or \"sorry for the delay\" would have been nice but no \"do you know what you want?\" Was her first words out of her mouth.

My bf and I ordered 10 tacos for $31 thinking the tacos were small. Much to our surprise (and our stomachs' dismay), the tacos were loaded with meat so it was way too much food - and we're big eaters! It didn't help that prior to receiving our tacos, we devoured large quantities of their fresh tortilla chips and salsa and shared an ahi tuna tostada and plaintains with friends. My fave tacos were the bistec adobado, chicken en mole colorado and rock cod. I would pass on the cochinitas and carnitas next time - a little on the dry side. The bill was hefty, but I'd come back again. YUM.", "author": "Lisa H."}

We get to the restaurant and there was no one in front of us.  We ask to sit on the patio, the hostess says ' sure, hold on'  then after about five minutes comes and says 'follow me' and leads us to a table inside.  Ummm... to which I say, we want to sit outside.  She proceeds to tell me there is only one two top table outside and the other people (that came after us) have a dog and they must sit outside... Um okay, but didn't I get here first and I love dogs (I have one) but couldn't they wait for the next table.  I mean, isn't that the price you know you might have to pay when you bring your dog with you?  So, I say, we want to sit outside, I guess we will wait.  Long story short, she sat us outside at the next table and it was downhill from there.  They don't have the same drinks at the Mission (no Frozens) and the service was mediocre and the food wasn't on par with other places.  It doesn't help when you start off with a clueless hostess.", "author": "Jill b."}

We were stuck in a tiny table for 3 people next to the kitchen so the atmosphere there kinda sucked having to choke on the chile smoke coming out of the kitchen. The place was dark at night dim lights then pow bright kitchen right next to us! no bueno. Also thank god I had my purse hook, where the heck do you put your purse and jackets? ended up sitting on the jacket. I think we just got the shitty table, the other seats looked pretty comfy. Moving on to the food, we got a pitcher of my favorite Nepal Margarita and also tried the Fresca Margarita, both yummy! The tuna tostada, tacos, guacamole, all good! Oh and I noticed the salsa and chips taste a lot better here than the one at Marina, weird. Food= 4 stars! Now Service..hmm...Our first waiter this guy was really attentive and we loved him. Then he left and a woman took over and she was very nice when she was around BUT service kind of sucked! I was trying to get her attention for an extra plate and I was waving like a freak but she was busy talking to her buddy and drinking her coffee she didn't see me for a good 4 minutes. Then when I finally got her eye contact, I would think she would come right away, uh nope! She continued talking to her friend and then came over. Then later in the night we ordered 2 more tacos, waited..waited..45minutes passed..then we asked did they mess up our order?? She said oops I forgot to put it in, sorry! What the heck? One of my friends waited so long she ended up canceling her taco order. Well besides that they do have an amazing private room in the back and I would go back and ask to be seated in a different section.", "author": "Karen T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-09", "description": "These guys have balls.  They move into the Mission and open a taco place called tacoLICIOUS.  I mean, that's like trying to sell sand at the beach. Maybe not the wisest move, but it's gutsy. So, with that in mind,  I just had to check this place out for myself.  We ordered a number of tacos from the little box in the center of the menu.  Each were good, but nothing was orgasmically awesome or potentially \"licious\" as the name implies.  That said, the carnitas, nopales and the filet mignon tacos were good, not to mention they have a very nice selection of Tequilas and the owner is quite nice.  So, what to make out of this place.  I think Tacolicious created a new nitch: its the \"first date taqueria\" (assuming your looking for such things).  Yup, decent tacos in a safe, clean place where your date will not feel funny if they are dressed nicely.  However, if things go well with that date, you and your now new significant other will no doubt return to your other favorite local taqueria.", "author": "david c."}

A waitress came over. She said she wasn't our waitress but saw us waiting for a while so was going to help us out. She took our order, she was sweet but one of the dishes never arrived (it had been left at the counter and was cold. They reheated it and brought it out. We had asked for no sauce and it came doused with it). She was genuinely apologetic about it and it must be hard when a restaurant opens.

After confronting the waitress about it, we finally got a table in this kinda noisy restaurant. Being Mexican, I am a huge fan of authentic tacos. While these tacos were okay, I wouldn't call them authentic. I was hungry, so they did the job. My favorite part about this place was the drinks. Their margaritas were really good and I enjoyed them more than the food. After a few, they also helped mellow me out about the service and having to wait about an hour to be seated. All in all, it was a decent experience. I would go back for drinks and a couple tacos if I were in the area with some time to kill, but I think I'll stick to the taco trucks I already know to fulfill my AUTHENTIC taco cravings.", "author": "Omar L."}
