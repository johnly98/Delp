When we first arrived at 12:30pm, we entered the pay parking lot and literally drove around for 30 minutes trying to get a spot. We weren't so lucky. However, we had other plans as well so we decided to do the other stuff first and return at a later time since they closed at 7pm today (this isn't normal, apparently. They close at 5pm).\n\nWe returned around 2:30pm and luckily there were plenty of spots! Yaya! We were able to find a spot close to the entrance. After we parked, we walked up to the ticket booth and there was no line. Double yaya! We were greeted by a friendly employee who helped us with getting tickets. For the two of us plus parking, we spent about $50; not bad. Then we walked up to the employee who took checked our tickets then we were off! \n\nThis was our first time at the zoo and we honestly didn't know where we were going, luckily there was a big map bu the entrance. Now, my friend likes physical maps so she can check things off her list so we walked back up to the employee who took our tickets to see of they had any papers maps. The nice employee informed us that back in March of 2018, the zoo decided to get rid of the maps since they were a waste of paper and back for the environment. Great initiative, but bad for us. While there were not maps for us to gran, we noticed that on the side of the big map there was a sign that says \"snap the map\" or something like that. Pretty much advising us to take a picture of the map; great! \n\nThen we were off! There was a lot too see and I did not expect the zoo that big. It had a lot of exhibits and animals for us to check out. I have to say my favorite was the red panda! So cute. It took us about 2 and a half hours to get through everything, but we also stopped to grab a quick snack at one of the food places in the zoo. The food prices were expected; typical \"amusement\"park prices (that was an fyi; not a complaint. Just saying hehe). And, the gift shop had a lot of cute stuff so you'll definitely want to check it out before you leave. \n\nThis is a great place for families with kids, and well pretty much anyone. It's right by the beach so when you're done visiting the zoo just walk across the street and enjoy the views. Great experience, clean zoo, cute animals = awesome experience. Highly recommend paying a visit. However, if the lot is full, there should be a sign or someone directing traffic as parking was a nightmare.", "author": "Misty T."}

We found it clean and convenient, if a little bit cold.\n\nThere's a good variety of animals, and generally, the enclosures seemed adequate.  We did feel like some of the large cats and the wolves could have used more space, but presumably experts determined that this worked.\n\nMy son loved the train.  Great photo opportunities abound.  There's a huge play area also, but playgrounds are plentiful in San Francisco, so I wouldn't go to the zoo just for the playground.\n\nParking is $10 on weekdays, $12 on weekends.", "author": "michelle l."}

The kids haven't been to a zoo in a while, this one was near Sacramento, so not so far of a drive for us. Have good walking shoes on! Get ready to spend at least 3-4 hours here! \n\nThe weather was beautiful! Nice, sunny, and cool. Not too hot and not too cold. We saw lots of animals. I was happy that we got to see majority of the animals out and about. Half of them were sleeping, but it was expected. \n\nThe kids loved to see all the animals in their habitat! The habitats were nice, clean, and roomy. They did a great job keeping everything clean for the animals! They've got a train ride for $6 per person, kids under 2 were free. You get to ride around the park twice! The kids really enjoyed that!\n\nI love it that we could bring in our own food and drinks! They are not sticklers on that. I like to bring in our own snacks and foods, just another healthier alternative to their everyday fast food items. There were plenty of benches and tables around the park! They even have a playground area for the kids! It was a nice ending after seeing all the animals. There were three areas for the kids to run around in. They even have a toddler area for little ones to play in. The parents could relax while the kids play. \n\nAll in all, it was a great day! We will definitely be back.", "author": "Daisy T."}

I've been going here since I was a kid and I can honestly say that it's never been better in terms of animal care and exhibits quality. It will only get better over time IMO.\n\nRe: The food: I'm not sure I understand why all the food options at this zoo are so bad. I fully understand that many of the visitors come from all over the area and not just interested in urban foodie trends/hotspots. I get it, tastes vary. But to only have 3 main food items to choose from (pizza, hot dogs and burgers) in a city that prides itself on quality food choices just strikes me as really half assed. Would it kill them to add a deli with more of variety of food options (salads/sandos/etc.? I'm sure it would be profitable. Hell, just add a deli counter that makes made to order sandwiches (i.e. just like the new food court at the Oakland zoo). Instead, they force families to either eat outside the zoo or bring a huge picnic with them in order to avoid buying the expensive and low grade food they offer.", "author": "Darin E."}

We haven't been to a zoo in a while so this was quite a refreshing encounter with the animals. Though this zoo isn't as big as some of the other ones I've been to, the animals are in nice enclosures that seem spacious, comfortable and also provide a interactive environment for them. Unlike some other zoos where the animals seem to be languishing or hiding somewhere, the ones here seem to be quite active even though it was in the afternoon when I thought they'd be napping lol. When we were here we saw the hippo taking a bath, the tiger growled, the lion rouse from his place on the highest rock to regard us with his majesty before laying back down again. We also saw some baby snow leopards playing in their glass enclosures. Nothing beats coming to a zoo with interactive and inquisitive  animals because imho curiosity means they're healthy and doing well!

Animals are cramped into such small enclosures, they hardly look alive.\n\nSo when my family & I took a trip to San Fran, we were curious to see what the zoo was like down by the bay.\n\nIt's beautiful! From the entrance, to the gift shop, down to the animal enclosures themselves. It's completely different in every way, shape, & form.\n\nThe animals here were active, they look, dare I say, HAPPY. Their enclosures are LARGE, & most of the animals were rescues. Take the rhino, for, example, as it was rescued and rehabilitated after poachers stole his horn.\n\nThroughout our visit, the penguins were swimming, & literally leaping out of the water, the snow leopard was gnawing at a big hunk of meat right by the glass, & we witnessed a cub bear wrestling and playing with it's mother.\n\nThe caretakers seem as though they thoroughly enjoy working with these animals, they wore smiles from ear-to-ear & were very attentive.\n\nIt's different out here by the bay! They know what they're doing!\n\nA BIG plus was the kids' play area. That alone was worth the price of admission. It's HUUUUGE. With a total of 4 different play stations, our kids burned themselves out running around pretending to be animals.\n\nI loved this zoo. The price was right, it was CLEAN (a big + for this OCD Mom), it was fun, & most importantly, the kids loved it.\n\nOh! Just watch out for those apes. During our visit, one decided to poop in it's hands & flick it towards the crowd.\nYeah... I'll watch them behind the glass thank you very much! lol. \n\nHope to be back again soon!", "author": "Leslie A."}

Going on a weekday in July - light crowds.\n\nIf you plan it right, you can catch a good number of either animal feedings or keeper talks.  We saw penguin feeding at 10:30, then the wolverine was just around the corner for an 11:00 talk.  Later in the afternoon, we caught the mandrill feeding at 2:00 - then over to the lion keeper talk at 2:30.  \n\nThere are several distinct sections; some separated by enough trees that you wouldn't realize where things are in the rest of the zoo.  Sections are an African savanna, a primate area, a big cat area (with other African animals close by), a short South American section, a bear section, a small Australian section, a HUGE playground (kids could spend hours here), and a general explore with small animals where you can pet goats, get people talking about animals who were brought out, and have an insect area.\n\nNothing is a far walk.  There are about 4 food places; the lemur cafe in the center is the best.  \n\nSome of the exhibits are top notch (lemur island is fantastic, the penguin pool is amazing).  Others look like they date back 30 years and could use an upgrade.  Yet, overall, there's nothing that is in bad shape; and most is well laid out with enough room for animals to roam.\n\nBesides the animals, I mentioned the HUGE playground, there's a carousel, a small train that doesn't go far - but is great for small kids, a couple butterfly gardens, and a theater for shows.\n\nWe took public transportation from downtown SF: took about 40 minutes.

I think the parking fee was steep but that seems to be a theme in California so I guess I can't really deduce much on that. The ticket attendant was super nice and let us know to buy a zoo membership in our hometown because discount prices tend to cross over to other zoos across the country! We have a baby on the way so zoos seem like something we'll be at a lot in the future, so we're definitely going to take his advice.\n\nThe zoo itself was set up really nice. Maps were easy to follow and even when we weren't near an exhibit there was something to look at. They have several gardens located on the premises with gorgeous plants and flowers. \n\nAll of the exhibits seem to be very well-kept and there's so many animals to see! It was a gorgeous day, so we got lucky with most of the animals being out and active.\n\nP.S. They have peacocks roaming the grounds... Those birds SCARE ME (childhood trauma) but others seemed to really enjoy them walking around.\n\nMy favorite was definitely the otter and the hippo.

For context, the only other zoo I have ever visited was the Fresno Zoo in my hometown, and I have to say that the San Francisco Zoo proved to be much better and more enjoyable.\n\nI'm not someone who's very passionate about learning  or looking at animals in general, so I'll be very honest when I say that I wasn't expecting much from this trip. However, man am I glad that I was wrong.\n\nThe group I came with were major animal enthusiasts, so they literally would just drag me around to all the exhibits they wanted to see. I could tell they were having a huge blast, seeing the wildlife that we don't have the opportunity of seeing back in the Fresno Zoo.  \n\nMy friends went crazy for the bug exhibit that offered a huge variety of insects to look at, we also loved the farm animal exhibit that even let us pet some of the animals there as well, such as the sheep and goats. My personal favorite exhibit  was the one where guests could see various animals up close, and be allowed to pet them, while a volunteer would tell us interesting facts about that animal as well. I thought it was something really interesting to see as the Fresno Zoo didn't have an exhibit like that.\n\nThe San Francisco zoo was so large that my friends and I didn't have the time to explore the entire place even if we wanted too! What I loved about this zoo in particular was the fact that it had a restaurant offering a large variety of food that we could eat, several themed playground areas where children could run around and play, several animal exhibits, as well as a pretty decently sized gift shop to grab some goodies. \n\nIf there was one thing that this zoo would definitely need, however, and would largely benefit from, it would be specialized tours that would drive around the entire zoo. \n\nIn the end, the San Francisco Zoo was an enjoyable place to visit, even for someone like me who isn't the most passionate about animals in general, will definitely visit again when we go back to the Bay Area.", "author": "Rhiamae L."}

I was a little delicate from the night before, so didn't show up until around 12:45pm. Getting here was a little tricky as I was coming from the Outer Richmond. My uber went down Great Highway, so it had to turn back around in order to enter the zoo as there's only an entrance on the east side of the highway. He ended up dropping me off past the parking gates, so hopefully he didn't have to pay as the sign said no dropoffs or pickups. I didn't see this until I left the zoo. Parking is $12 on the weekends and $10 on the weekdays.\n\nThe baby shower was in the Great Hall. It was a good sized space. Definitely enough room for a buffet spread and all the dining tables. Each table had two SF Zoo stuffed elephants which I thought were cute. I ended up taking one home. There were also a beverage and a dessert station. For photo ops within the room, there is a cute fireplace to take pix in front of. The space was utilized well for a party of about 60 people? I'm not sure how many actually showed up, but we had plenty of room.\n\nWe were given wristbands to go to the zoo afterwards, so some coworkers and I decided to explore. Favorite animals were the giraffes, tigers, anteater, bears, lemurs, etc. They were the most active when we dropped by. Especially the lemurs since they had a huge habitat to play in. Some of the more disappointing animals were the lions, snow leopard, wallaby, koala, etc, as they just laid there and slept. I was saddened to see the komodo dragon as it's hind legs didn't work so it was dragging it's lower half as it walked. The hippo also looked so cramped in the tiny pool. I felt like he was just hiding in the corner as he seemed unhappy. The sea lions were cute, but we found out they were blind when we listened to the pre-recorded audio. Overall, I think we basically covered the whole zoo as we stayed until it closed at 5pm. We also saw the zebras, emus, mandrills, monkeys, llamas, a wolf, snakes, frogs, an iguana, meerkat, a red panda, etc.\n\nI can't even remember the last time I went to the SF Zoo. It's fun to see the different animals, but this zoo can feel a little small and depressing. Glad I got to see the animals, but I think the zoo across the bridge is a much better one.", "author": "Elena N."}

It can be a little chilly in SF so bring a jacket since you're right by the beach. This zoo can be done in about 3 hours including eating lunch there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-19", "description": "So we have some good news and bad news, first the good news, a few years ago this place was really run down, it was so bad I was never coming back, but they have fixed it up, it's really nice now, all the employees and volunteers were really nice.  Just park on the street, $12 for parking is too much, but if your rich then it's nothing to you.\n\nThe food is ok not too bad, the Coke was mixed pretty good, some places water it down either on purpose or they just don't know how to mix the drinks, but at the pizza food area it was mixed great.\n\nThe food area needs more tables, they are all full and people still in line buying food and no place to sit, so that's a problem, more tables should have been added when the remodeling was done.  Still more tables need to be added somewhere.\n\nAlso selling drinks before the drink machine is ready to put them out is not good, so they say sorry, take your cup and walk over to the next food area and get your drink, not a good thing.\n\nAnother not so good thing is no straws and no lids for the drink, taking away straws doesn't solve any problem, it's a littering problem, enforce the litter laws, otherwise you will just take away everything you use in your everyday life because a few people throw garbage on the ground.  I bet you find more condoms in the ocean than you do straws, so ban condoms.\n\nOne thing to watch out for if you have a stroller is the train tracks, it's a small train track but 1/2 way across it starts dinging, but it's only a couple of steps to finish but I barely got across before the arm drops, almost hit me, it really should lower slowly, I don't know how that would have felt if it hit me but for sure it would not be good if it hit a little old lady.\n\nThe train ride is fun but I think it goes a little too fast for those tiny tracks, I was a little worried that there was a possibility of it falling off the rails on the curves, it should slow down a little.", "author": "DT W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-16", "description": "Have you ever wanted to visit the zoo, looked at the price of an adult admission, and ended up not going because it was too darn expensive?! For me, that was all the time whenever I was back at home in SoCal with my high school friends. We'd always mention the San Diego Zoo as a fun activity, and even though some of my friends had discounts, I was always a \"NOPE.\" $50+ for a ticket? COUNT ME OUT! That covers like a full tank of gas for me and then some.\n\nIf you're like me and are cash-strapped, the San Francisco Zoo is actually a very inexpensive opportunity to see a BUNCH of amazing animals (if you are in the area of course). Personally, I was very surprised when I came across their website and found that admission was only $20. And it's $19 when you go during the winter/spring season. The best part is, if you are a San Francisco resident, it's even CHEAPER (I believe like $17). Upon realizing that this zoo was pretty affordable, we decided to come by during our anniversary. \n\nThe San Francisco Zoo is located in the far southwestern part of the city near the coast. I find this spot actually super convenient because 1. by car there shouldn't be traffic as it's far away from the city and 2. there's busses that come here. Plus, the zoo is near major streets/highways (Skyline/Highway 1), and so driving here should be pretty chill. Contrary to what you might think about the low price, there's plenty to see in the zoo. And therefore, I'd recommend setting aside at least 2+ hours of your time here. If you plan on parking inside the zoo, it's $12. But, many people have mentioned that you can probably find some street parking outside (at your own risk).\n\nBased on mine and my girlfriend's first visit to the SF Zoo, we can wholeheartedly say that this place is definitely worth every penny. The San Francisco Zoo really does have almost 90% of the animals you would want to see at a zoo. For example, right when you walk in and even BEFORE you get through the gate, you are met with the CUTEST bunch of giraffes. And if you are lucky, you'll also see some ostriches roaming around. One thing I really enjoy about this zoo is that there are a lot of giant spaces for different species of animals to mingle about. I didn't find a single exhibit where animals were confined into a tight spot. \n\nPersonally, my favorite things that I saw at the zoo included the anteater (you never see anteaters around!) and a brave little peacock that wandered out of its home. Even though we only spent 2 hours (we had a time crunch), there's SO MUCH to see that you can spend the whole day. Usually, they'll also have a special exhibit too. When we went, they were showing up species of tarantulas (yuck!). If you plan on staying a while, it's nice that the zoo has a detailed map for you (and signs too!), as well as plenty of rest (and food) areas if you get tired. \n\nAll in all, I really, truly enjoyed my experience at the San Francisco Zoo. It was definitely better than I thought and definitely worth my ~$20 for admission. If you are looking for a solid zoo to visit in the Bay Area, the San Francisco Zoo is a viable option. I personally believe it's slightly more worthwhile than the Oakland Zoo, but luckily for people, they're both affordable. I give the SF Zoo an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating. Come check out this zoo and I guarantee you won't want to leave.\n\nHave fun and prosper!", "author": "Bryan W."}

We wanted to arrive early to view the grizzly bear feeding at 10:30am. We arrived and found the bears (in the very very back) to find out that the 'feeding' consisted of them throwing a bone and some lettuce out for the bears before releasing them from their night quarters. \nLike someone else stated, a lot of the exhibits were either empty, or had 1 animal who looked miserable, or sleeping. I was most excited for the chimps and the gorilla's. They chimps were all inside so we didn't get to see them and the gorillas habitat was so small. They looks sad and depressed. \nNeedless to say, I was pretty disappointed in this zoo. Especially for the price you pay. We won't be back.", "author": "Kristeen D."}

The San Francisco zoo is a place I always wanted to go to but never really carved out the time until now.  Finally.  So glad I visited.  \n\nThe sections of the zoo are broken up into different enclosures grouping animals by geographic and climate region. They give out complimentary maps, go ahead and take one or two. The place is large enough that I found that it came in handy. \n\nSo many animals.  Plus they have resident peacocks that strut around freely.  My faves were the tigers, gorillas, monkeys, chimpanzee, and penguin colony.  I saw & heard firsthand that penguins do actually sing. No dancing though. There was one gorilla they cracked me up, he/she quickly gathered up all the celery sticks thrown into the enclosure by the keepers.  He hoarded them and snuck away from the pack to eat them all.  But always turned by around to see if the others see him.  One black& white monkey paused to stare at me while he was eating.  Apparently I was the entertainment during his meal. Loved all the personalities.  \n\nPlus there were a lot of informational plaques describing the animals, climate types, locations, and conservation efforts.  Great! And beautiful gardens scattered around the grounds.  Pretty! \n\nThe kids might like the mini steam train ride and Carousel. The pricing is extra though.", "author": "Lillian W."}

Most areas either had like one animal present (e.g., rhino, eagle, hippo, bear) or none at all (were they hiding or not released)? We didn't get to see the snow leopard or the wolverine. I don't know if it was nap time for most of the animals, but like 75% of the stops had animals sleeping (e.g., lion, tiger, sloth). You can't really blame the animals, but when there's either no animals or one animal present, it is kind of strange...\n\nThe Africa Part of the zoo was probably the best, especially the spot for giraffes! They were so majestic and beautiful (*tear*).\nI also thought that the location where the penguins were was nice. They had little holes in this large cave-like structure where they could hide/sleep. And this cave-like thing was surrounded by a circular stream where they could swim if they got bored. Ah but what bothered me was this little kid whom no one was reprimanding for going under the rope and attempting to step into the water...I get it. Kids know no better, but parents...did you not see the sign?\nWe need to respect the animals. I think it's already heartbreaking that these animals have to let humans point at them on top of being in these enclosed spaces...But when I see kids knocking on the glass (despite the signs not to) and ADULTS whistling and making bird noises or saying \"come here\" to animals... it's degrading. I feel for the animals. \nAnimals (especially ones that have no choice but to live as a part of a zoo) deserve more respect and sensitivity. I was really turned off by the behavior of some people at the zoo.\n\nIn terms of parking: WHEW get here early. It's really limited. For weekend's, it's a flat rate of $12.\nThankfully, one of the employees came out and helped find additional parking for me and for some other cars.\n\nThe prices would have been decent ($19/adult) all-day (10am-4pm), but I wish there was more to see.", "author": "Christine H."}

(It's not a large lot, but when we were leaving around 2:30 pm, there were spots available here and there.  Don't forget to pay for your parking, $10, at the ticket counter either when you enter or when you're leaving.)  The line for tickets wasn't long, but then my son saw the \"Skip the line\" sign that said you could buy tickets online.  So I did.  I should've just gotten in line, it probably would've been faster.  First I had to sign up for an account.  Then I bought the tickets and had to wait for the confirmation e-mail to get my tickets to show the attendant.  It took about 20-25 minutes for the tickets to arrive in my email box!  In that amount of time, I could've just stood in line and already have entered!  I'll know next time to either purchase them the day before or just stand in line (especially since you have to pay for parking at sometime as well).\n\nOnce inside the zoo, we had fun!  (Note: There are no paper maps of the zoo. There are maps posted throughout the zoo and you are encouraged to snap a picture of the map to carry with you on your phone.  Kind of annoying to have to keep finding the picture on your phone, but I respect the fact that they are trying to save a tree by not having paper maps that are probably just thrown away after the trip is over.)\n\nWhat I especially liked about this zoo trip was:\n1) How close you feel to most of the animals, especially animals like the grizzly bear.\n2) The fact that there are volunteers at many of the exhibits that will share interesting information about the animals with you.  All are extremely friendly and happy to answer your questions.\n3) Because it's in San Francisco, the weather is perfect for a stroll around the zoo and it's all FLAT!\n\nOur favorite animals--the red panda, the prairie dogs, the koalas, the penguins and the river otters.  We spent 4 hours here because my kids really enjoyed just hanging out in front of their favorite animals and observing them.

Not all the attractions or animals are accessible to access or view during the 'off season' period and yet you'll have just as much fun and make memories.\n\nThe one exhibit from my childhood that isn't around anymore is the elephant enclosure, which was damaged so severely by an earthquake a long while back and the funding to replace and bring up to code would be so expensive to complete, they decided upon keeping the exhibit closed indefinitely and since has been repurposed.\n\nI can and so often do spend as much time at the zoo every chance I can. There's this sense of calm and something special when sitting for hours in front of an enclosure, watching some amazing animals doing their thing out in their enclosures. Seeing as from day to day every animal can and does things differently, so from visit to visit I get a unique encounter with some of my favourite animals.\n\nDon't forget to learn about animal conservation and the SSP (Species Survival Plan), and how the SF Zoo partakes in helping ensue endangered species have hope for reintroduction into their wild habitats!", "author": "J Austyn B."}

This is a NOT a family friendly venue anymore unless you are part of the Silicon Valley elite.  An example being the zootoberfest food concession.\nWe purchased two pretzels, 1 soda, 2 icee and 2  brats.  The brats were smaller than the smallest hot dog and had a tough, flavorless taste.  The staff were under trained and were short on ingredients and cups.  In addition we paid $61 for this mess!   This is unacceptable.  In addition nearly every trip we make the small train costs go up $1.  When we ask the staff why they simply explain because of the \"greedy management \".  This is the same scenario for the carousel.\nI am sure with the extreme wealth in this area that the zoo can be made a better place and more affordable for families.

My daughter and I went here today and I could tell the zoo had updated so many of their features.  This made things fun. \n\nSo - I had written previously about prices. Everything seems the same except the train went up to a whopping $6 per person! I splurged on the train today. And, I swear, I think they are driving that train WAY faster than they used to. Even my five-year old daughter mentioned it. She said, wow, this train is going fast! Yeah, and it was. And it was actually fun! \n\nSo on other updates: the sad polar bear is gone. I'm not sure where she went. But the exhibits that are there in that area are definitely upgraded and well maintained. You have the Sea Lions, the Alaskan baby bear cubs, the Mexican Gray Wolf, and the Grizzly Bear. Their habitats are all updated and full of great places for them to explore and sit. The wolves were truly amazing, and so were the baby bears. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nBe aware that the zoo closes at 4 now that it is \"winter\". I thought it closed at 5 and I screwed up my daughter. Oh well, mistakes were made. \n\nOverall, it seems like the exhibits at the zoo are improving.

I recommend going to the keeper talks (at least for your favorite animals) because it's so much more entertaining watching the zookeepers play with or feed the animals vs. watching sleepy animals. The lion keeper talk was probably the best one! You're about 5 feet away from the lion and only a layer of glass separates you from him.

The monkeys and chimpanzees were utterly disinterested in their surroundings (particularly the chimps - who also looked pathetically thin).\n\nThe zoo has a little train which runs around a (not very extensive) track near the Australian animals. Maybe the driver is bored too...or perhaps he is told to cram in as many trips as possible each day...but the train goes along  at a very fast speed (too fast to see anything properly or to take photos).\n\nThe layout of the zoo is not very logical or intuitive- the map handed out with the tickets helped, but we still lost our way a few times.\n\nMany of the animals are behind Perspex screens. No doubt the plastic is clear and practical when it is new - however, the barriers are now usually scratched, stained and otherwise scuffed; making it harder to take decent photos. \n\nAll in all, despite the above minuses, we had a reasonable return for our $40 (2x$20).", "author": "Jack W."}

It was a Saturday and we arrived promptly at 10:00am, the time they begin admission into the park. It's usually cold when the bay breeze rolls in so we bundled up and headed into the park. \n\nAdmission was $20.00 an adult, $17.00 for a senior citizen (65+) and $10.00 per vehicle to park. I would highly suggest checking out the free parking along the outsides of the park like the other reviews suggest! For us with a senior, it was not plausible. Once inside, we rented a motorized scooter for my uncle, a little more on the expensive side $35.00. \n\nAs we went though the park, it was obvious it had a few main jewels. Grizzly Gulch, the African Savannah, the Primate Discovery Center and maybe a few others. The other exhibits looked old and over-grown, matching a lot of their animals. The chimpanzee's were extremely old, the oldest being 59 years old. It looked like their entire exhibit was a old jungle-gym. You could definitely tell their age by their graying fur. Additionally, their elderly polar bear had passed away at the age of 36 years old. They no longer have elephants in their pachyderm exhibit due to the small quarters they were living, replaced with a tarantula display.

However, at the San Francisco Zoo by the ocean? 64 degrees when we arrived, and 68 degrees upon our departure. A novel choice, indeed! \n\nThe zoo itself is really a well kept zoo, and is a manageable size. Unfortunately, this also means that the animals have less room to roam. It's not nearly as nice as the Oakland Zoo (in my opinion,) but is still fun with plenty to see. \n\nMy son's favorite exhibit was the gorillas (despite asking me \"where\" they were the entire time,) and he's talked about them multiple times since. This is one animal the Oakland Zoo doesn't have. The giraffes are always a favorite of mine.\n\nThe playground is large and unique, yet not shaded, and VERY crowded. It was a little chaotic, and too easy to lose a kid in the crowd, therefore we moved on quite quickly.\n\nOne more tip: Parking is $12, unless that's full (which it was,) and only valet parking is available for $20. We opted to park across the street along the beach. Not really the wisest choice, with no safe path except running across a busy highway. The zoo really should petition for a light to be installed in front, with a crosswalk in place. Long lines to get in, but they moved swiftly!", "author": "Amber L."}

We bought a membership because we needed a place for her to walk outside where she wouldn't be trampled. The zoo is never so crowded that we have to worry about that. \nThe playground is awesome! I like that they have a small kids area with a super clean sand pit. The zoo itself is a good size for us to walk around. We usually do a lap around the zoo, hang out at the playground and go home. \nI recommend the membership for anyone with kids.

Due to crazy Bay Area traffic, we got to the Zoo at 3 pm. We paid $20 per adult and $12 for parking. The lady told us the park closes at 4pm, but the park doesn't close at 4pm and it actually closes after 5pm. Here is the reason why I am deducting a a star, we left the park at 5:30pm, and there was no one at the parking lot exit to hand our parking ticket to. The gate was already open, so technically we didn't even have to pay for the parking ticket. We wasted $12 and I don't think they should charge us for parking if it was an unattended lot. \n\nThe Zoo itself is beautiful. Plenty of animals, animal and trainer shows, a train ride, 3 different playgrounds and the beauty of nature. I am not a big fan of theme parks/zoo food, so I actually brought my own snacks and drinks to avoid wasting money on mediocre food at the food court. Comparing the SF Zoo to SD Zoo, the SD Zoo is way nicer and larger but if I am not comparing the two, the SF Zoo is a great spot to spend the day and have an adventurous day with the family. Also, the Zoo is located a few feet away from the beach, so after a fun filled day at the Zoo you can over over to the beach to keep the family fun going.", "author": "Laila A."}

Thought we would try the San Fran Zoo. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised with all the animal exhibits and things to see and do at the zoo. We took our 4yr old daughter and she had a wonderful time. We especially enjoyed the Tiger Feeding, the kangaroos, and the Giraffe Lodge. \n\nIn the middle of the park there is a really fun place for the kids to play. Lots of slides, swings, and fun activities for the kids to climb and play on. Nearby there is also a carousel that my daughter loved to ride (she did it twice). The cost is $4 per turn and an adult can ride free with children under 42 inches. \n\nThe only thing we didn't like were the bathrooms. They were DISTISGUSTING. We attempted to use 3 different bathrooms in different locations throughout the zoo and all were awful. Dirty, smelled horrible, with paper, trash, and anything else you could think of littering the stalls. It was the same for both Men's and Women's and the family restrooms. We tried them all. I felt really bad for my wife and daughter having to try to use the bathroom. \n\nOverall we had a great time and spent the entire afternoon (from 1pm to 5pm) and saw maybe half of the animals.

I usually reserve it for special occasions, but as we're getting acclimated to the Bay Area, we're trying to get out and about more. This place was definitely on my list of venues to explore. \n\nThis zoo is right by the ocean, so we were a little chilly going in and coming out. It's a good idea to bring a jacket, especially since  it seems some parts are more exposed than others. Otherwise there's plenty of shade for people coming in the summer, and lots of little stores to stop into throughout to warm up a bit when it's cold out. \n\nThe exhibits are unlike ones I've seen before. I kind of dig how they're set up to make use of the natural growth in many spots, like the red panda exhibit, but it does prevent some animals from being seen when they're cold. I really wanted to see the lemurs, but I have a feeling it was too chilly for them to be out by the end of the day, sadly. \n\nI will say that a lot of the enclosures are also more spacious and expansive than some I've seen in the past.

For once, we got clear skies so we ended up spending most of the day here. Otherwise, bundle up as it gets quite cold when the fog rolls in. \nThe zoo has been renovated in recent years, specifically their playground where my daughter played for an hour. Some of the animal exhibits bum me out like the lonely and bored polar bear. I still get the heebie-jeebies near the infamous tiger exhibit though plenty of signage indicates that the zoo won't tolerate any animal taunting or exhibit climbing. Still, if you have kids, this is a larger and more varied zoo than Oakland if a little dated.  \nPrices would be steep without our discount.  The steam train is an extra $5/person.

The only open area was the playground, the carousel & the cafes - yes there were reindeer, yes they brought Santa in by the monkeys, but other than that - it was all closed! No giraffe barn, no train, nothing past the flamingos. I mean nearly nothing. This is mostly a message to the zoo - please bring back the Zoo to Zoo Lights!", "author": "P J."}

The food is not great, but as with all family attractions, this was to be expected. This is a great place for kids to learn about habitats and animals and a fun place for a day date!

Just check in advanced for any closed exhibits.  It may just be luck or the route we took but we saw all the animals live.  We loved the lions expecially seeing the 1.5 year old.  Oh and the new bear cubs! We were lucky to catch the feeding and they are so cute!!!  We did so the train ride at hefty $6 for a 5 min ride but seeing your baby's and kiddos faces are priceless.

I picked trash, rode the back of the manure and trash trucks and would be a relief keeper on occasions.  I loved the variety of animals and the work around them that was key to maintaining the infrastructure of the zoo.\n\nThe San Francisco has been evolving over the years.  One such evolution is that there are not longer elephants, though the building is still labeled as Pachyderm House.  Sad, as elephants are among my favorite animals and were great fun to work with, hiding food for them to find, playing with them as I hosed the compound and putting lanolin around their eyes, giving them that teary look.\n\nThat said, the White Rhinoceros are behind the Pachyderm House so close to the crowds that you can see them and their prehensile lips very clearly.  They graze on the tender grass outside of the enclosure.  The Black Rhinos are across in another compound.\n\nMost all of the mammals are readily visible.  The old lady of Polar Bears is now 35 years old and slowly works her way around her nice enclosure.  Penguins and sea loins are nearby.   One ape, the gorilla, has a silver back male and a harem of mates.  The chimpanzees are is a large central compound and regularly riot in the trees.  Monkeys are in other cages.\n\nThe layout is easy walking, covering a large area, so be prepared to walk a lot.  Unlike San Diego, the SF Zoo is pretty level, so strollers make taking little kids a lot easier.\n\nDuring the week there is only one major eatery, the Lemur Cafe, in the center of the zoo is open with three options:  burgers & hot dogs, deli and pizza.  The lines for pizza and burgers runs out of the door but the deli has hot dishes without a line.  Weekends that are more eateries but far more people.  Visit during the weekdays if you can.\n\nThere are two large playgrounds so your elementary school level children can runoff energy while you sit watching and resting.  Then off to see more.\n\nA great layout, lots of nice displays, roving docents with animal parts like skulls, paws and bones answer questions and let kids touch, there are some places where zoo workers hold animals, like iguanas, turtles and possums that you can gently pet and the signage is excellent.\n\nParking can be tough so come early.  Also, tell the ticket booth that you parked and you can pay the $12 parking fee for an exit ticket.  If you forget, you have to hoof it back to buy a ticket so you can leave the parking lot.\n\nA very good place to spend a day.", "author": "Mitch K."}

They seemed happy. Awake and happy penguins are cool.\n\nBecause of the many sleeping animals, we were able to see most of the exhibits within 3 hours and finished up in the playground.

I was impressed to see the rhino pushing around a huge object and to learn that they grind down their horns,\nMy little granddaughter loved the penguins.  The exhibit has water spraying and the penguins are so active...it certainly caught her attention.\nWe continued on to see the tigers...oh my how they roar.  I was surprised the hear that many years ago, the tiger leaped out of the enclosure and attacked to boys who were taunting it.  They have since raised the height of the enclosure.\nMy personal favorite was the hippopotamus.  He not only wallowed in the water, but came out of the water, pushed a big ball and jumped back into his pond...then opened his mouth to expose his big teeth and  let out a huge roar and open and she splashed through his pool.  What a show!\n\nUnfortunately because we arrived so late, we were not able to see all of the exhibits.  Just before we left, we cruised by the koala displays.

It has one the best giraffe enclosure I have seen; although it may not be as huge as the San Diego Zoo, it's filled with these gorgeous trees and rolling grass. It has a very natural look and feel to it.  You get pretty close to the giraffes when they hang up their branches of food to eat right on the fence. During special hours you can go inside the giraffe house and the keepers give great talks. \n\nAnother great spot is just down from the giraffes, where you can see a troop of Lowland Gorillas. I think they have at least 6, in a really nice and big enclosure full of grass, boulders, trees and toys. They have benches by the windows and it's peaceful to sit for as much time as you have watching them.\n\nThe other really great enclosure here is Grizzly Gulch. Two Grizzly Bear sisters have a thick grassy enclosure with a pond. They can often be seen sleeping right up by the windows, but are sometimes running around too. There are benches here too where you can sit and watch, which is really nice.\n\nIf you have kids, the play area is awesome. There is a giant \"ice burg\" playground you can climb on and walk through, and a really impressive artificial banyan tree playground of rope bridges, slides, and monkey bars. Make me wish I was a little kid so I could climb on it!\n\nIf you don't mind walking, I recommend parking on Sloat St. There is a lot of free public parking (a rarity in SF!) and it's right next to the zoo, so it's convenient enough to make paying $10/$12 for closer parking not really worth it unless you absolutely have to.", "author": "L U."}

We are Sacramento zoo members, so we got 50% discount of entrance fee. \n Adult entrance costs $20 with $10 lot parking on weekday and $12 parking on weekend.  We got to the parking about 11 am, and there was plenty of spots left, but we noticed the cars that arrived after 1pm had to pay for valet parking.  It's working it parking in the lot rather on the street, as it's dangerous to walk across the busy highway. \nIt's difficult to compare the three zoos.  However, for SF zoo's size, it's very well kept and has a reasonable number of animals to check out.  We really like the open encounters for the animals, especially the large giraffe and zebra one-African savanna.  We love the tropical rain forest and aviary featuring different beautiful birds and exotic plants.  The grizzly bears are super adorable.  We enjoyed seeing the kangaroos hanging out with each other and snacking on their lettuce and carrots.  Our favorite spot at the zoo is the penguin island.  The penguins were so vocal; it's nice to see how they enjoy swimming and singing.  We stayed at the zoo for about four hours.   Definitely recommend it for family with kids.", "author": "Thdoe D."}

It makes me so sad to all of the animals locked up, despite the fact that is serves an educational purpose. I felt even worse about the zoo when I heard that Kabibe, a baby Gorilla that I learned about in school, had died due to a tragic accident involving a hydraulic door. \n\nLike I said the zoo makes me sad, but I had to go to observe Primates for my Anthropology class. Tickets were rather pricy and they didn't offer a student rate.. bummer! At least it was a fairly sunny day and the Primates were out and about. I spent most of my time at the zoo making detailed observations about Langurs and Mandrills. I had the opportunity to see a new baby Francois' Langur named Chan. He was so tiny and cute, munching on kale with his mama! I spoke to a zoo keeper for a while about their group and he was very helpful and informative. The Mandrills were also very interesting to watch, but some of them seemed rather sad. I watched them for over an hour and little Lulu was picking the hair out of her arms and legs like it was nervous habit. Angie also spent the whole time alone :(\n\nI also had the chance to see the Chimpanzees, Gorillas, and Giraffes. The Chimpanzee exhibit was the saddest of them all. It resembled an abandoned jungle jim and all of the chimps looked so incredibly depressed. After the Chimps, I went to the Gorillas and they had a nice memorial set up for Kabibe. There was one Gorilla who looked like she was in mourning. I could tell just from looking at her that she was the grandmother, Bawang (she acted as a surrogate mother to Kabibe). It made me want to cry! I read in the paper that they've had incidents with the hydraulic doors in the past and recently another Gorilla got her hand caught in it. I really hope that the zoo will be much more careful and take these problems very seriously in the future, Kabibe didn't have to die.", "author": "Rachel S."}

I grew up going to zoos and this has always been a second favorite to the SD Zoo. \n\nParking can be a bit of a hassle if you do not come early, SO COME EARLY. You'll just end up parking along Sloat street and walking probably 1/3 of mile to even enter the zoo, which if you don't have little kids no big deal. But if you do have little kids, then big deal. The zoo opens at 10, be there at 10! Otherwise you can do valet parking for 10 dollars which may be worth it if you don't want to walk. But we arrived around 1 to meet family and it was completely packed, albeit we did go on a Saturday afternoon so there is that too. \n\nThe zoo has had some great additions over the years. We love walking through the big giraffe exhibit and seeing the big cats, although there are some exhibits that do look quite depressing. The polar bear we saw did not seem happy, just our opinion, who knows maybe he is a very happy bear, but he didn't seem like a bear who would thrive in the wild. We kind of joked about it, shame on us. \n\nThe park is the perfect size for a family outing. They've got a great petting zoo area for kids to enter and pet different barn animals as well as a couple great playgrounds with different themes that my baby cousin adored. One of the only downsides is this zoo feels like it closes early. It might just be because it's a pretty big zoo and 5 just seems so bright and sunny, but it's understandable.

They have a large variety of animals especially primates and it's simply amazing just watching the animals do their thang. And there's also a schedule of feeding times so you should check that out if you get a chance!\n\nAlso, don't skip out on the children's zoo! Even if you don't have little kids with you, you should definitely check it out. They have a petting zoo up there so you can see hogs, donkeys, chickens, ducks... and even feed goats and sheeps! Definitely not a moment you want to miss. And don't worry, they provide hand sanitizer and sinks and soaps to wash your hands afterward. \n\nFood here is pretty expensive just like their souvenirs so you should bring energy bars or something if you want to save money. \n\nBathrooms are also pretty clean and didn't smell so that was a good surprise. \n\nOverall, I want to come back to the zoo already! It's a fun place to be and you get to see a wide variety of animals! :)", "author": "Venus L."}

There were no crowds and the animals were all very active. The park seemed almost abandoned and without the patrons to warrant it, most of the services in the zoo were suspended. That being said, the park is designed almost like a blossom or hub-and-spoke with the entrance at the base the flower. We were able to snack, use the family restroom, and play around in a photo booth between regions without going much out of our way. The staff was a skeleton mix of youth and veterans of the zoo, without much interaction there's not much to be said. To those who feel zoos are principally a challenge to the decency of animals as they are captives, this zoo's specimens were mostly rehabilitation and rescue animals. There were some that appeared to have been bred and raised in captivity based on the health and numbers of the giraffes. \n\nThe polar bear on exhibit did seem outwardly somber compared to his peers, we noted that his compatriot two enclosures over had recently passed away and considered the possibility of this affecting his demeanor. The gorillas were off exhibit, to our misfortune. The hippo, lion pride, and bald eagles were all favorites to behold. \n\nWhile the issue of examining animals in capitivity walks the line between positive and negative awareness of the wild, the San Francisco Zoo accomplishes the task of raising positive awareness for the exotic habitats. The prices were very reasonable for entry and I recommend this for families and couples - while it is obviously capable of bringing enjoyment to anyone.", "author": "Jeremy T."}

What I do not like is showing up to said zoo and coming to the realization that a pretty serious portion of the attractions are not actually a thing. \n\nMy wife and in-laws brought our families to the San Francisco Zoo this week and were somewhat disappointed with what we got. Entry price and parking are a little bit steep, but nothing too severe. There was plenty of stuff to do for the kids, but as I said before some of the exhibits were lacking, or not there at all. \n\nMy personal favorite attraction at the SF Zoo for the past 10-15 years has always been the big cat house. You are feet away from some enormous cats, as their roars fill the room. This is amazing, unless the house is closed on the day you go there. If this is the case, you are just shit out of luck. Also absent were a few monkey exhibits as well as elephants. It's like they took some of the biggest attractions, and just removed them. \n\nOf the animals that were there, it was pretty cool. The bug house is still pretty amazing and hosts a bunch of neat bug displays. My favorite here was the giant tarantula they had. Thing was pretty enormous. \n\nFor kids there is still the petting zoo, the little kids areas, the absolutely huge playgrounds, and the carousel. Little kids will have an absolute blast here, while adults will be somewhat disheartened with the animal selection. \n\nOverall a decent experience, nothing really to write home about.", "author": "Chris S."}

The whole place feels very clean, green and organized. It is clear to me that all the animals and exhibits are well taken care off. You can see that they are really making an effort in creating beautiful open environments for their animals.\n\nEven though they are a bit smaller, they do have a wide variety of animals including koala's. And everyone knows that's the most important animal, right? If you have some crazy little animals (read: kids) of your own, I would definitely recommend this place. They have very nice playgrounds, a nice children's zoo, a carousel and a train. \n\nFurthermore, this zoo does not get too crowded. Even during the weekends it is tolerable. I would recommend parking outside of the zoo though as their parking is quite pricey ($8 during the week, $10 on weekends). The admission price is also pretty steep, so if you plan on coming here often, I would recommend getting the family membership. \n\nOn a side note, I noticed that many people are writing negative reviews for this zoo because they are against locking up animals. While I agree that wild animals should be able to stay in their own natural habitat where possible, I do want to emphasize that without the conservation efforts of zoos and animal organizations in general, a lot of these species would be extinct. It is important to raise awareness of the condition some of these animals (in the wild) are in and I think this zoo does just that. Furthermore, many animals in this zoo were born in captivity and/or would never survive out in the wild (e.g.bald eagles, blind sea lions).", "author": "Ellen H."}

That was a bit shocking as I thought they only live in super cold climates.  The animals have plenty of space to roam and there are good platforms with which to view the animals from.  Also, they have two big playgrounds that is great for kids.  There is an ice and forest playground.  It sort of looks like a mix of ice and fire.

Also, the former Children's zoo that they now have renamed the Exploration zone was also frustrating to handle the uneven pavements.

It's probably a good option for families that have to carry a bunch of stuff. The Muni L line ends a block away from the Zoo and it's really a convenient way to get here. If you show a Muni Pass you get a dollar of admission. Also if you're an SF resident show your license for a discount. Everyone has to have your license of they won't give that person the discount (ask how I know).\n\nI'll start with the good. It's a really nice outdoor setting that's a great place to walk around on a nice day. Bring your own food and drinks and have a picnic at one of the tables. It was pretty quiet when I was there so I could see these filling up quickly. \n\nThere are a number of Peacocks roaming around the grounds and going in and out of the animal enclosures. Obviously they don't pay any attention to the signs saying to respect the animals. If you're here a few minutes and can't find a peacock, just wait a few minutes and you'll hear their loud, squawking call. Then it's really easy to find them. \n\nThere's a decent assortment of animals to check out and most of the grounds are well kept. Some of the enclosures are creative. We rounded a corner and saw this Giraffe head peeking over this rock. He was licking something on top of this rock. It was very cute to watch him with his long black tongue trying to get at whatever. A lot of the enclosures have pretty good points for viewing the animals. \n\nThen the not so bad. If you're expecting something of the caliber of the San Diego Zoo or even the California Academy, you will be disappointed. There were a number of animals off display, parts of the zoo under repair, or in need of repair. Parts of it (and I'm not just talking the animal enclosures) could use some cleaning or upkeep. \n\nThen there's the ugly. Granted we were here on a weekday and the park was a little dead, but the animal talks we went to were really disappointing. We went to the 2:30 big cat talk and we got there early to get a spot. No one was there. We hunted a bit and found a sign. OK, 2:30 big cat talk here at 2:30. We checked it out a bit and a couple of other people showed up. We figured we had some time so we headed across the path to the rhino. We had fun watching this Peacock that was jumping between the enclosure and viewing wall. At a couple of minutes before 2:30 we walk back over. There's one of the same people that was there before and she kind of shrugged, nothing. We waited until about 2:45-2:50 before someone else started looking for someone that worked at the zoo. She reported she caught someone about to go out an exit. I guess this person called someone on the radio. Someone did show up about five minutes later. She thanked us for coming to the zoo and read mostly from the signs. She was also very hard to hear and a few of the dozen or so people who waited asked her to repeat things a couple of times. We got frustrated and left to go check out the rest of the zoo. How disappointing!\n\nI think we can cross the SF Zoo off our list as been there, done that. I'm a member at the California Academy and find that more enjoyable.

I've been to other zoos before (including the San Diego Zoo), and although this one isn't nearly as big, I honestly had a better experience here. Maybe I just came on a good day, but it wasn't too busy, the animals were extremely active so I got to see all my favorites in action, and I was able to see everything I wanted to see. I watched a tiger play with his ball for an hour and I was extremely close up! That probably made my entire trip.

The bird aviary was gone, or we couldn't find it.  We found 3 lions but no tigers, one monkey, a couple of giraffes, a sleeping rhino.  For the kids, I guess that was enough.  I was going to write and ask what was going on because once there was a wonderful little zoo here but I didn't see it on this outing.

Not only that, it was also a the day of the month where SF residents with ID could come into the zoo for free!\n\nI also noticed that there were certain time intervals where events occurred: when a certain animal will come out, when they will be fed etc. I found that they stuck to this schedule 90% of the time. \n\nThe zoo is pretty small if you just want to see the animals in its physical form, but if you actually sit down and actually enjoy their presence then this trip will definitely take at least 2 hours. If I had the time, I would've sat for hours on end at the red panda,  monkey, and the penguins exhibit! They are one of the few animals that actually move around a lot. \n\nUnlike most parks that have pigeons or crows walking around, this park has peacocks (both male and female) walking around the park like they own the place. #peacockselfie it's quite amusing too because they would sneak in during another animal's feeding time and eat along with them !\n\nHowever what sucks is that they do not post on their official site which exhibits are closed or down for construction....bummer!!", "author": "Dixie L."}

Now to all the people that say that the animals don't look happy, it's a zoo there in an enclosure what what did you expect. This is an African savanna, it's a metropolitan zoo.  I have a toddler and he thinks it's great. \nThe exhibits I really like are the giraffes and if you stick around until 3:45 you can go into the giraffe paddock where they sleep at night and talk to the zookeeper.  You can ask them any questions you want about giraffes and they will answer. Apparently the male giraffe is too good at mating so that's why he separated from the females.\nThe zoo also has a really cool playground for kids as well as a petting zoo. \nOther exhibits I highly recommend would be the lemur exhibit. There are tons of lemurs and depending on what time you go they will be jumping around all over the place.\n\nIf you have a kid live in the area who likes animals this is a great place to come and visit.

We got here around opening time when it was still cool, so many of the animals were still a little sleepy (I heard animals tend to be more active when it's a little warmer). We started to leave around 2pm and even then people were still coming in and the park was a lot more crowded by that point. So keep that in mind when you're planning your trip: morning = emptier but sleepy animals; noon/afternoon = crowded but active animals.\n\nWe all had fun walking around the park with my 4yos and looking for animals. They are big fans of the show Wild Kratts, so this was an opportunity for them to look for animals that they otherwise only get to see in cartoon form. The zoo isn't super large, which was actually a good thing for us. This way, we were able to ask them which animal they wanted to see next and then just go there instead of having to follow a set path for convenience' sake. Be warned, though, that there are no elephants here. My boys are big elephant/Dumbo fans, so they were a little sad about that.\n\nParking at the lot is I think $8 and very worth it for us.

If you watched Jurassic World and thought, \"those engineers couldn't possibly have been stupid enough to put such a large dinosaur in such an under-engineered enclosure,\" well, that actually happened at the San Francisco Zoo with the tiger exhibit. In 2007, a tiger leaped over a wall that was not tall enough and killed one visitor and injured two others. News reports blamed the victims for likely having taunted the tiger. Note that they were separated from the tiger by a 33 ft. wide moat and probably reasonably expected that the tiger would not be able to leap out of the enclosure.\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack, the zoo claimed the wall surrounding the moat was over 20 ft. tall. They later stated that it was actually only 12.5 ft. tall (the recommended safe height is apparently 16.5 ft.).\n\nThe zoo's also had trouble with animal maltreatment. It's banned by the city from having elephants because its enclosures were too small and the elephants were all dying. A gorilla was recently crushed to death by a sliding door.", "author": "Ryan L."}

We come from San Leandro so it was quite a drive but the kids wanted to go this year for the train ride and the reindeers. We went in a group of 9, 7 adults and 2 kids. We got there around 6pm, played the games and rode the carousel and enjoyed the fake snow. We arrived at the train station at 7pm and to our surprise the train was not running anymore for the rest of the night. We went back to maybe cheer the kids up by going to see some live animals such as the reindeers and the giraffes but they were gone for the night as well. I don't understand why all the big attractions were closed for the night when there was still an hour of park time left and it is limited for 3 hours for zoo lights. I honestly feel cheated because we paid for the tickets, gas, and toll, and sat in traffic and didn't get to do anything we wanted to. If the attractions were closed I feel that we should've been notified at the front desk while purchasing our tickets.\n\nI have came here on a regular operating day and was pretty satisfied with everything. All the animals were out and everybody was cheerful. The kids loved it. Food prices are expensive but that's expected. So maybe zoo lights is just a way to make extra money for the holidays for them?

To be honest, I found out that they had a red panda exhibit and I begged my partner until he said we could go there. However, this zoo definitely offers more than just a red panda.\n\nThe zoo has a pretty spacious parking lot although we did come on a weekend in September and most kids are in school by then. It was really empty so we parked close by and went to buy our tickets. Unfortunately we are not residents of SF so our ticket was 17$ per person. However, I thought this was quite a nice price considering that I've been to zoos where the price is over 25. You can pay for parking here as well and it costs 8$ per vehicle. We were given maps and then headed to enter into the park. The map comes in handy and shows you all the exhibits that you can go to. They are broken up by region/category. Here our some of our definite favorites.\n\nTenzing the red panda. I absolutely thought he was the most gorgeous animal out of the entire zoo. There is only one and he likes to take naps so it is rare to see him. We got lucky and saw him move up onto his tree house and lay down to take a nap. I was pleased.\n\nPetting zoo. This is one of the best parts of the zoo. They have a mini farm with pigs, goats and mini donkeys. They have some goats out that you can brush and feed (50 cents for the food). The goats are quite friendly and they lick the food right off your hand! I was able to take quite a few pictures with the goats.\n\nFlamingos. There is a huge flock and we saw about three baby flamingos. They are white and fluffy!! \n\nOtters. The two little otters we got to see were just angels. They were swimming around and twirling around each other over and over again.\n\nKoalas. The one koala we saw was brought in by a zookeeper and put on the branch. It was the absolute perfect picture!\n\nInsect zone. I'm not a huge fan of insects and I'm terribly terrified of spiders. However, they offer a lot of different insects to look at. There is a bee hive right inside (glass covered, don't worry!) and even an ant hill as well! This insect zone is bigger than most zoos offering cockroaches, beetles, spiders, ants, and many others. Not my favorite part, but if you like the creepy looking stuff, this is your place.\n\nGiraffes. Just 3 weeks ago a baby giraffe was born! The baby was so adorable to look at and take pictures of.\n\nPenguins. There isn't glass that is between you and the penguins. The exhibit is pretty open and you can get a real good look at them.\n\nPeacocks. Some are in exhibits and some are just roaming around. They are friendly and you can take very close up photos of them.\n\nGiant anteater. We were lucky and saw him come out and he is huge! It was really amazing.\n\nMonkey exhibit. There are a ton of monkeys to look at and they even provide an upstairs for you to look at them at a different perspective! It was really clever.\n\nCrowned crane. This bird by the far has the craziest hairdo. I love when it flaps it's wings around like crazy.\n\nFurthermore, we also liked looking at the polar bear, rhinos, lovebirds, sea lions, snow leopard, hippo, and emu.\n\nThey have a cafe that you can eat it which is a little overpriced. They have plenty of penny machines for souvenir collectors and a cute little souvenir shop before you leave.

All the children screamed lol.\n\n\nI went to see the big cats but the sign said they didn't have a scheduled feeding so me and my family just lined up at 1:00 to get in. We stayed for about and hour and nothing. I looked online and they said the feeding is at 3:00 :( so I didn't wait long enough. I wish they would have posted the feeding there. Oh well. Next time :) \nI had to leave though because I guess I'm allergic to tigers lol. My husband too, we could breath after being in there. It's ok though :)  \n\n\nFood- it's slightly expensive. I feel like some things are overpriced. Just don't eat at the leaping lemur cafe. That on is overpriced. The terrace cafe was a good price. We got 3 hot chocolates and a bag of popcorn. It came out to 10 bucks I believe. Not bad. One thing I do is pack snacks and water or iced tea with me if I'm planning on doing a family trip. I brought cliff bars and protein bars and water, some candies and stuff. My family was able to eat while walking and not have to stop the fun. They got energy because there is A LOT of walking lol.\nPack snacks! It will help a lot :) \n\nCleanliness- it was ok. There are people who clean throughout the day but they need people to also clean the parking lot. The glass on a lot of the animals enclosures are scratched, dirty spiderwebby. They should clean more if the prices keep going up.  \n\nOk, now for the bad part. \n\nThere are rules posted everywhere on how to behave near the animals. In different languages and in universal pictures. It was clearly stated to be quiet near the koalas but many people were yelling and screaming while they were trying to sleep. I did end up shushing some rude people because I got fed up with the disrespect. The animals are to be observed, not antagonized. They aren't entertainment, they are to be observed. \n\nBut that's just my opinion.\n\nIn the big cat room, a security/ handler specifically told people NOT to yell and not to lean over the rails. As soon as we got in, a man started yelling and multiple people put their children over the bars. The tiger was getting upset and growling and almost tiger peed all over everyone. \n\nOverall I give it a 10/10 but I do wish more people would control and behave themselves and be a good example for their kids :)", "author": "Ariana L."}

Not every zoo can afford pandas or up close and intimate exhibits, so I feel kind of bad for being a bit grouchy about the SF Zoo. \n\nAs far as parks and places to be go it is absolutely beautiful (it's about 5-10 degrees cooler than downtown SF with wind chill) and well laid out. There is a lot of unused space (weird for San Francisco) and the animals are often distant and still, almost sullen. Now, I understand that they need their rest and don't necessarily always want to be around people, but it can be rather uninteresting to see a hippo pop up for air every five minutes. \n\nThe animals avoid guests (except during scheduled feedings, make sure you make it to those) and sometimes it feels like a stuffed animal hall would be just as interesting. However, the smaller animals and the giraffes, kangaroos, and bears were very fun to watch and made up for an otherwise mediocre experience.", "author": "Daniel R."}

In fact, I think my last visit was before I had obtained my driver's license.  I try and visit zoos on my travels to cities/countries around the world, but for whatever reason, the SF Zoo was not on my list of immediate places to visit.\n\nI answered a call to serve through my former school's annual day of service.  I had always wanted to volunteer for one of their projects but either I was unavailable on that day or the maximum number of volunteers had been reached.\n\nApproximately 35 of us showed up around 8:30 am on a cold but sunny Saturday morning.  We were provided with some instructions and background on the two projects we were to work on that day.  One was to lay sod and the other was to set up the outdoor area for the new red panda exhibit.  Most of us picked the panda exhibit option, where we would be performing landscaping tasks - moving and planting trees, digging a hole to create a pond, preparing the foundation for planting rocks, clearing out fallen leaves and garbage, moving soil, etc.\n\nThe landscaping team at the zoo was fantastic with providing instructions and guidance, sharing stories, and showing their gratitude for our assistance.  I would happily volunteer to help out there again next year.\n\nPersonally I never thought I would enjoy doing back breaking work so early on a Saturday morning but it was my first time time using a pick and shovel to break up soil, dig a big/deep hole, move the tree across the garden, lower the tree into the hole, pull out the tree from the hole (the hole was not deep enough!), dig the hole deeper and then plant the tree.  It's the tree to the left of the tree house, next to the pond.  It took three women to get this done and I am proud of having been able to contribute to the development of the red panda enclosure.  \n\nAfter we completed our assignment, I decided to walk around for a bit to check things out.  It was nice to see that some things had changed for the better (open space for the savannah, primate area), others, sadly, stayed the same (Cat Kingdom, where the rhino appeared agitated and the hippo and tigers looked sad).  The good thing was that the animals looked healthy and the kids seemed to really love seeing them.  I know it takes a lot of money and time to make changes and I'm happy to see that there are improved safety measures for guests as well as more information on the animals.  \n\nOn the day of my visit the zoo was super crowded so I would say it's best to get there early in the morning or late in the afternoon.", "author": "Melissa L."}

The Gorillas were great and had a nice habitat, and the otters where playful. \n\n Beyond that, a very sad day. The lions, and tiger cages were all out for cleaning. The Elephant home and bird sanctuary was closed, the Koalalas had been quarantined, the insect house was off limits, and the rhinos where out to lunch. \n\nIf that where the end of the day, I would mark it off as a unlucky day for the zoo. But beyond that, the polar bears looked very skinny and hyperventilating, the lone snow leopard in captivity looked drugged and was wide eyed and drooling on the grass... and a bald eagle, a symbol of our country, was crying out in distress because he was trapped on a rock in the middle of small pond. He couldn't fly away because he was clipped. He also looked dirty like he had been struggling in the mud. \nI was horrified.", "author": "Mitchell R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-24", "description": "So today the family wanted to get out of the house (going a little stir crazy with the excellent weather and all).\n\nHubby wanted to go to a park, I wanted to go to San Mateo and go to the Japanese Garden there, maybe some browsing around, stop somewhere for lunch and then maybe the NASA Space Museum after on the way home (now that wasn't a BAD idea, right?). Daughter wants to go to the zoo. I actually like the zoo, so I was like, \"LET'S GO TO THE ZOO!\" like I'm 5 years old again. Daughter starts in and hubby reluctantly grumps to the car and we go to the zoo.\n\nSo, my recommendations if you're looking for some cheap entertainment over the course of a year with the SF Zoo:\n\n1) Get a family membership if you think you're coming back w/in the year. Two more visits pays for the entire membership and then the rest is smooth sailing. It's for two adults and up to five kids -the guest kids don't have to be related to you to get in BTW. You get discounts at the gift shop, the carts and at the food areas too, so keep that in mind. Also, you get discounts at admission at over 100 zoos and aquariums nationwide.\n\n2) There is some alternate (we found free street ...it was a weekend FYI) parking on Sloat, where there's another entrance. The zoo is right by the ocean in that area -the ocean is beautiful, I can see a stroll on the beach afterwards sometime. It's a quick walk if parking there, so keep that in mind. You'll get two parking passes to use at the SF Zoo w/the membership and that will come in handy. Otherwise it's a $10 charge if the lot still has available parking spots.\n\n3) Don't worry about the cost of food here. We found the cafe and the burgers and chips were around $8, which is totally reasonable. There are diners and such on Sloat but the cost was actually higher there and we didn't save any money by dining at the cafe we went to (I'm reviewing that later). The burgers looked really good. I wanted one, but we had already eaten. The coffee and a can of soda we got was pretty high (around $7.50 w/discount), so that was a bummer.\n\n4) I can't advise enough for the weather. Make sure you have a jacket in the car for layering. It was warm and sunny where we were, but cloudy and cold enough to wear jackets there. Later it warmed up, but the jackets never came off until we got in the car to go home.\n\n5) If you're an animal activist and you're going to get upset about unfair treatment it's probably not the place to have a standard visit for you. Nearly all of the animals (save for a pacing lion which is never fun to see) looked healthy and content enough to me. I appreciate the zoo as a place to teach us city folk about endangered species. Of course it's not fun to see animals in cages, ever, but it's just something that IS...it's something that is part of our- and other -cultures, and it just IS. I took some photos and the bars and the windows are sadly part of the pictures, but again, that's just how it is. It's easy for me to attach human feelings onto a rhino, for instance and think, 'he's lonely and needs a friend' without knowing the full story of why he's alone. And sure, I wish they weren't in captivity, but I can't see them being put back into the wild, especially if they're endangered. Anyway, just an opinion...\n\nIf you remember the Tatiana the former Siberian tiger, who killed a young man and mauled two others (allegedly as a result of their teasing), the tiger grotto area will give you goosebumps -at least it did for me.", "author": "Tamiko B."}

A place I went to, pretty much, once a month during my early years. I couldn't get enough of this place. \n\nI talked it up to my then two year old (he's three now) and gushed about the lion house, feeding the seals, the massive monkey hill, and that his favorite animal, the elephant, would be there. I also told him that we would go on the train, my boy's current obsession. \n\nWalking in to buy tickets, we're greeted by a sign In the window that the train is not running today.  Crap. Ok, fine. Distract the boy. He'll be fine. \n\nI have to say the giraffe compound is spectacular. It's the first thing you see when you get to the entrance of the zoo. Seems to go on forever and the giraffes just look so happy to roam freely in their habitat.  \n\nSo we walk around. Seems almost 10 minutes later and all we can still see are the giraffes.  ???  Oh wait, there's one Zebra, but it's behind a closed off door. We can see it through a crack. \n\nWe walk more...  My fond memories of this amazing place and the hopes I had of sharing it with my own son... Dissolved with each exhibit we passed. The best thing was the giraffes. Everything else was in dire need of repair or a makeover. What happened???  \n\nMy beloved lion house, we saw two tigers. No kore rumbling roaring frenzy at feeding time. There is no more feeding time. They bring in a couple of animals just to give them nibbles and an educational talk about them.  The rest of the lion house holds a python display and a poorly filled plant area. \n\nForget monkey island. They're now newly built cages and the best view is from the upstairs deck... No elevator for those of us with strollers. \n\nNo more seals. No elephants. Old water fountains are filled with plants still in their plastic pots and random garbage. \n\nThe old playground is now a pretty cool area of play structures for kids of various ages. A smaller toddler area is separated from the climbing structures for the older kids. Very well done. \n\nOverall, the whole experience was just so disappointing and very sad for me. Closest thing my son got to see that actually had an interested in, was a small sculpture of an elephant near where the old elephant displays were. And my goodness, I never realized how small it was. Poor elephants.  I that vicinity now are just a rhino and a very mangy polar bear. \n\nSad. Very sad. Don't know if I'll ever want to go back.  Two stars only for the giraffes and the play area.

I love animals, but I love happy animals even more when they're thriving and active. The polar bear looked so sad and melancholy in his designated space, just waiting for life to pass him by. The rhino had his horn cut/shaven off and looked so confined and sad.  I mean how could you possibly explain these things to children? How the animals look and feel. I mean, the hippo kept trying to bite his cage bars. I'm not surprised at all that a tiger attacked an intrusive visitor a few years back. These animals are suppressed and definitely not happy - they're designed for the wild.\n\nI might sound nit-picky, but whenever I dish out money for something, I endorse it. So until SF Zoo and Sea World start to change their approach with caring for the animals - even if it costs more to give them a much more thriving habitat (and honestly, I feel like they should use these facilities as conservation areas or rehabilitation and releasing the animals back into the wild), I won't be paying for tickets to visit anymore. \n\nSorry SF Zoo, you won't be getting my business anymore anytime soon.", "author": "Sheena T."}

Though I've gotta say, coming from a city with a FREE zoo that rivals the SF offerings, I've sort of been avoiding the disappointment. \n\nThis winter's unseasonably warm/sunny weather has been amazing. So much so, a trip to Ocean Beach doesn't require a puffy coat or thermal undies. This is reason enough to celebrate and go peek at some exotic animals, right? So off we went!\n\nAdmission is a bit steep, but hey, if it goes towards the fuzzy (and not so fuzzy) creatures, no way am I complaining. The habitats are kept clean and up-to-date from what I could tell and the animals didn't look sad or depressed... and the tigers didn't look the least bit interested in mauling humans, so I'll take it as a good sign.\n\nThe highlight was a quick glimpse of the new baby chimp, riding on it's mother's back. Seems like the family is pretty protective of him, keeping him at a good distance from the plexiglass. Also the orphan Grizzly bear sisters are fun to watch. Reading their story (and finding out that Grizzlies are now extinct in the \"Bear Republic\") was depressing, though.\n\nIf you're going to visit any zoo, the perfect time of day to do so is early in the morning. Not one to heed my own advice, we arrived right around noon. When the animals are taking a nap. Though it's cool to see them in a docile state, it doesn't make for the most exciting visit. Still not sure how half of them can sleep while there are screaming kids everywhere. Guess they're used to it by now?\n\nKudos to the Terrace Cafe for their ginormous portions of soft serve ice cream! It was probably the highlight of the trip. Seriously, the vanilla custard was about to topple over the cup. Three of us split the serving. And an overpriced/overcooked pretzel.\n\nAround 2 pm, the fog started to roll in, in true SF fashion.

We liked how open the giraffe area was and that they interacted with the ostriches. \nIt was entertaining to watch when it was time for the zoo keeper to feed the penguins. There was a seagull trying to blend in with the Penguins thinking he can get some fish too. When he couldn't fool the zoo keeper, he ended up just stealing the fish from the Penguins. \nWe were surprised to see the peacocks walking around throughout the zoo. Young kids were chasing them around. It was really beautiful and impressive to see their feathers standing up. \nThe playground was cool. One side was glacier themed and another area was jungle themed. There were a lot of seating for parents to rest while watching their kids play. \nWe ate at the Leaping Lemur Cafe. Food was ok. They had 3 different stations: pizza, burgers/sandwiches and Asian food (teriyaki bowls). We had the cheeseburger and the chicken club sandwiches. They use brioche buns and the sandwiches came with kettle chips...unsalted kettle chips. \nWe rode the train, Little Puffer. This ride is not built in with your admission ticket, it cost $5.00 per ride (you go around twice).  \nThere was definitely one very interesting animal we saw on the day of our visit. My 5-year old kept asking me why the rhinoceros had 5 legs. I told her it wasn't a fifth leg, it was the same part that her dad and brother had. I took a picture and was going to post, but my teens and husband said not to post it. Lol...\nOverall, it was a pretty good zoo with entertaining and one traumatizing animals.", "author": "Alma S."}

I wish they built playgrounds like that when I was a kid! It is just so beautiful and so spacious. \nThe other thing that makes this zoo amazing is the people that work there - they are so friendly and helpful and so passionate about what they do - you can hear it in their voices and see it in their eyes when they give talks about the animals. \nChildren's ZOO is a lot of fun too. I like the fact that goats and sheep are not behind the fence, you can just walk around and pet them and brush them as much as you'd like (Yes, you can pick up the brush and brush the goat!)\nZoo is not huge but the layout is smart.

It was nice not to be pushing around with our stroller. Looks like there is some construction going on by the grizzlies so that section was closed. Prices are reasonable, of course food is expensive as expected. Don't expect to pay less than $5 for anything, even ice cream. Make sure to bring sunglasses, I didn't so ended up paying $25. For a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 kids, 5 and 3. We spent $110 which included: parking, tickets, lunch, ice cream, and the train ride. We brought our own drinks.

Parking wasn't as easy as a week day, I recommend parking on one of the side streets. But you do risk having a vagrant bust your windows during a break in. In SF the homeless are allowed to do whatever they want and they exist in huge numbers. I have lived here all my life and have NEVER seen it this bad. The city council has tied the authorities hands together and doesn't want anything done about all the NASTYNESS. Zoo is pretty far from the usual nasty homeless guy hangouts, so it's a better local to take your kids. And it's near the Beach so take your beach stuff and watch the sunset after.\n\nBut back to the Zoo. \n\nThe last time I was at the Zoo in 2010 it seemed like tougher times at the Zoo. This time I was pleasantly surprised to see some wonderful improvements around the grounds and animal enclosures. For being a busy beautiful Saturday the Zoo did not feel crowded. It was a very relaxing day. I arrived at about noon and stayed until 6 even though they close at 5. Nobody told be to get out everyone was very nice. \n\nThe White snow leopard was amazing. Sat and watched him for an hour. He came or her came directly up to the glass. Amazing creature!!! The Tigers and lions looked great, Wished they had more space, but the enclosure was nice and clean with plants and grass. \n\nThe insect building was great and it was fun interacting with the other patrons and their children. This feature was also a lot nicer then 5 years ago. \n\nOverall I was pleased to see the zoo looking so much better.

No, it is not the San Diego Zoo or the Bronx Zoo or the Monterey Bay Aquarium, but it is a fabulous urban zoo. \n- The playgrounds are probably the most creative and magical playgrounds anywhere (though they can get very crowded)\n- The children's zoo area - with the little farm - is a great way to get up close to many animals and is great for small children. The insect house is also a blast!\n- They have a number of unique habitats and animals that you won't see at many zoos - such as the red panda, the lemurs, and the sloths. My personal favorite is the feeding of the grizzly bear sisters - something not to miss. The Africa savanna exhibit is so lovely.\n- The grounds are gorgeous and spacious. When my son was in a stroller, I would walk for hours around the zoo. It was so nice to get outside and be in a lovely, green place. \n- The new sculpture garden is a lot of fun\n\nThere are too many wonderful things at the zoo to name... sure, there is room for improvement (ZooLights is very chaotic, needs more and better food options, some exhibits need updating) and there have been some tragic animal deaths, but overall it is an excellent zoo.\n\nThere are some wacky reviews here, including from some who want to see exhibits that have been changed or removed for the good of the animals. Many zoos are phasing out elephant exhibits due to the debate over whether elephants can be kept humanely in a small enclosure. I am personally thrilled that the SF Zoo has sided with the humane choice to no longer have an elephant exhibit. In addition, the cat house had large cats in small enclosures. Now, they are allowed to roam and relax in much bigger spaces. They have also successfully had cubs in recent years, which has required closures to allow mom and baby privacy.

At first I put off going to avoid weekend and holiday crowds, but going at 10AM when they opened on Sunday was perfect. We didn't run into many people while we were there, and it was starting to pick up as we left at 1PM.\n\nThree hours was a good amount of time to spend there, though we could have easily spent more and with kids I'm sure it would have taken longer.\n\nMaybe it was the cold weather or the early hour, but the majority of the animals were out and about and active while we were visiting- especially the monkeys, who were super loud! \n\nMy favorite animal was the snow leopard- seriously just looked like a giant house cat with a gorgeous coat. Kept walking up to the glass and rubbing against it as if he wanted to be pet! Tigers were dozing on a rock in the sun, much like my own cats at home. \n\nAccording to the map, there are two areas with anteaters but we only saw one- he was quite close to the edge of his enclosure though, so we got a great up-close view of him. Also the reindeer were on the map but their area was blocked off when we tried to find them- sad we didn't get to see them as the holidays are nearly upon us.\n\nI didn't run into many zoo employees on my visit but there were a few stationed around with displays to go over with kids and they were happy to answer questions and keep up friendly and informative chit chat with adults.\n\nMap and signage is easy to follow and paths are mostly smooth. Seems like they only have a few areas closed or under minor construction, adding improvements here and there.\n\nOnly criticisms are that the glass on some of the enclosures needs to be cleaned- not from handprints but from weathering or age, especially the lion enclosure which was quite fogged and scraped up making it difficult to see. Another few (the fishing cat and otter enclosures) have a really bad glare that make it difficult as well.\nThe petting zoo did not have food available as expected, which was a minor disappointment, as I love to feed the goats- but they were quite friendly and there were brushes to use on them, so it all works out.\n\nOur experience was enjoyable, though I'd appreciate a lower ticket price- we are Bay area residents but have not gotten our new drivers licenses yet,but still had to pay the regular fee.", "author": "Stefany V."}

It has been a few years since I last came by, but oddly, it felt as if the zoo was smaller than it was a few years back. Maybe it was because it was mid afternoon and most of the animals were taking a nap. So it was less interesting than it could have been for me.\n\nI did like seeing the penguins, tigers, lions, rhinos, grizzly bear, polar bear, and the snow leopard. They also have a train ride that makes a small circle around the zoo. There was also a zipline set up for kids near the middle of the zoo. \n\nOverall, I thought it was an okay experience for me. I'll probably return in the future. I know that every few years, the displays are changed a little bit.

That's a zoo. Educational. Humane. Enjoyable. \n\nAnd then you have the SF Zoo, which I think is modeled after Alcatraz, and is basically a concrete jungle of tiny micro apartments where large animals are shoved.   A polar bear in a concrete ditch? Sea lions with so little water they can't submerge? Teeny monkeys in teeny cages. Ugh.

Seeing all of the penguins lining up for fish was incredibly cute - and, since the fence is so low, you can see them quite well. The bear area is a little more inaccessible (not surprisingly so), but it's beautiful to watch those big bears lumbering about. They've done a nice job with the African section, I could watch the gorillas and giraffes for hours. The chimps - which are close to the entrance/exit - are a good stop on your way out because chimps will always leave you in a good mood. \n\nI've only ever been on weekdays which is a great way to beat the crowds. Even on weekdays, I was surprised by the number of people there so I can only imagine how crowded it is on weekends. \n\nIf you plan on going more than a couple of times a year, the membership is worth it (plus you get coupons for free parking!).", "author": "Wendy L."}

Seems like it is a fantastic place for kids, but our group of adults ranging from age 25 to 32 had a great time, too.\n\nNot sure if we got lucky because we went on a weekday and it wasn't very crowded or if the zoo is so big it never FEELS busy as a result, but it seemed pretty empty while we were there.\n\nThe lemur enclosure was impressively large, but not much was happening, it seems we came by during nap time. We hoped to get a glimpse of the baby gorilla, but no luck there either. There were several freshly hatched flamingoes when we went, and we ended up standing to watch the flock of flamingoes for over half an hour without even realizing it. Who knew flamingoes were so interesting? The penguins were also pretty fun to watch. I wish we'd come earlier in the day because the animals weren't very active and we ended up missing some of the scheduled events we were interested in because we were wandering around on the opposite side of the zoo.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was definitely the hippos. There was a hippo lounging in the very shallow water in its enclosure and he walked to the other (empty) end of the pool, where we thought he would eat the lettuce sitting there... but instead he pooped the angriest poop I have ever seen! It seemed like he was trying to aim directly at a family standing at the fence, and you can bet they ran away as fast as possible. It was absolutely hilarious and definitely in the top five moments in our trip to San Francisco!\n\nSome of the enclosures seemed criminally small (particularly the komodo dragon, poor guy) but most of the animals seemed to have very large living spaces.\n\nIt seems like a lot of the signage is in disrepair, there were several places where there clearly used to be informational signs about the animals you're looking at, but the signs had been taken down and not replaced. I was a little disappointed by this, the point of the zoo is not just to look at animals, but to LEARN about them, too!!\n\nThere was also almost no staff to be seen anywhere in the entire place. Every other zoo I've been to, I've accidentally stumbled upon zookeeper talks, animal caretakers happily explaining what they're doing as they go about their jobs, and other staff ready to talk to visitors about what they're seeing. I think I can honestly say other than gift shop and the ticket window, I probably saw less than 5 staff members the entire time I was there.\n\nThe overall emptiness and lack of information available about the exhibits and animals is why the zoo loses two stars.\n\nThe people working in the gift shop were very friendly and nice, I didn't feel like I was being pressured to make purchases, and the girl at the cash register seemed to legitimately enjoy her job. A very nice way to end a visit to the zoo. :)\n\nAmple paid parking is available, but you can park for free a little farther away... just be prepared for the trek back to the car. After walking around the zoo (and there is a LOT of walking), you might wish you'd paid for parking.\n\nNot sure I would have been happy with the ticket prices had my friend not had a free pass that had come with her zoo membership.", "author": "Linda H."}

My wife and I were visiting my parents and sister's family so figured to do a trip to the zoo.  My niece and nephew came along so that was fun.  I was able to use my Como zoo pass to get my wife and I discount.  The zoo itself has improved quite a bit according to my brother-in-law.  I was amazed that the giraffes and some other animals were all grazing together which looked right out of a scene from Africa.  The landscaping is absolutely amazing and kudos to the renovations.  We saw a lot of large mammals which my parents said were non-existent in the San Jose Happy Hollow zoo.  Parking was $8 on weekdays and $10 weekend.  I think they got us on a holiday rate so we paid full price.  Anyways, it was convenient and not as back as parking in downtown.  We spent close to 3 hours since the zoo is gigantic.  The restrooms are so far apart and there are at least a decent variety of food options in the caf\u00e9.  One of polar bear finally came out once the sun came out.  The train also had decent speed and didn't look like ones I seen in other zoos that go super slow.  Overall, we would come here again.

The parking was easy and cheap ($9). This zoo is really well maintained, has a great gift shop with lots of interesting things for kids and adults and has an espresso bar! Bathrooms were exceptionally clean. All of the bigger attraction exhibits were pretty amazing if you have patience and hang out for a few minutes for the animals to appear. My son and I were enthralled with the grizzly bears and caught a feeding, they were very active and we're very interested in their audience as one grizzly came right up against the safety glass.  The hippopotamus exhibit was a lot of fun, we watched a feeding and we watched him for about 1/2 an hour! I notice a lot of people want instant gratification and only have enough patience to wait for half a second before they move on to the next exhibit, if you wait, sometimes you will see the animals doing amazing things! The patas monkeys were so fun to watch. We were there all day and didn't get to see everything since we spent so long at each exhibit, there is so much to see.

My boyfriend and I headed over the other day (it was beautiful, hot, sunny weather!) and thought we would only spend and thought it would only take an hour or so. We ended up staying until closing! (Side note: there was a wedding reception happening there at closing, and it was gorgeous.)\n\nThey have a large collection of animals - much more variety than I had expected, and the habitats for the animals were beautiful layouts of rolling hills and flowers, large playgrounds and tree with elaborate tree structures, waterfalls and ponds, etc. It was a very hot day, and I'm assuming the animals were pretty exhausted from being watched by the crowds. Namely the large cats. But all of the other animals were pretty active, the bears, the rhinos, ostriches, penguins, otters.\n\nThe zoo itself is very clean, and the overall layout is easy to follow but also has wide and divergent paths that allow you to go wherever you wish and avoid crowds. The only thing that bothered me wasn't the zoo itself, it was the people - some parents were obnoxiously loud and setting bad examples for their kids or other children, yelling at animals to \"move\" or \"wake up\" despite the posted sign right beside them indicated a pair of lips with a finger over it, the universal sign for 'shut the hell up!'\n\nOn a lighter note, we stayed for the giraffe feeding, and got to see the newest addition to the family, a tiny giraffe taller than me with its mother.

Pets lower stress, and add years to our lives. Animals in the wild have a trait we can learn from: while sleeping, they are able to release the stress \"toxins\" in their nervous system that are pent up throughout the day while in survival mode. This is how they're able to stay so calm (seemingly), and to live longer, and to not be overweight. When you notice animals paws and extremities twitching while sleeping, including cats & dogs, that's what's happening. We should take note (shameless plug for the Somatic Experience technique in the book, Waking The Tiger). \n\nJust being at a zoo, surrounded by animals -- tranquil, docile animals -- is relaxing. It can be frustrating when you want to see Chimpanzees swing from branch to branch & polar bears swimming, but that's not happening. \n\nThe real thing to bet on while going to the SF Zoo is how likely would it be if \"that Chimp could totally swing over here and rip that Slurpee Kid's face off,\" or, \"that Gorilla could definitely walk over & leap the moat,\" or, \"there's nothing between me & that hippo but a pissed off peacock & a bed of rocks, say... hippos kill, yeah?\" \n\nI fancy myself -- and Zoos do too -- a Zoo expert. In a past life, I had the fine job of filming zoos. If you're comparing zoo-to-zoo, SF is feeble in the face of St. Louis, Denver & Indianapolis. Did we miss sting rays, jelly fish & shark petting? Did we miss the part where we can go below & see polar bears swimming? Elephants, anyone? What's a zoo without a solid elephant? Your bird exhibit is pretty mighty, though. You definitely Put A Bird On It -- Everywhere. And the kids you draw in are, like all other zoos, SOLID. The upshot of all this is that we bagged & tagged the zoo in 90 minutes, and since we're kidless, and your fine seaside location, we book ended our trip with pints & high fives at Costello's & the Park Chalet. And, we didn't throw up.", "author": "Jon A."}

I have been talking about going here for years. \n\nAfter coming back from the National Zoo in Washington, DC (which was free) I was very disappointed with SF Zoo. \n\nYes, it's very large \"99 acres of lush gardens and animal exhibits\" and the \"1,000 exotic, endangered, and rescued animals and majestic, peaceful gardens full of native and foreign plants\" but there was not much for ME to see. I was looking for the \"wow\" factor and it wasn't at this zoo. \n\nThe only section I really enjoyed was the African Region. It was lovely to see the giraffes roaming with the ostriches; animals that I didn't see at the National Zoo. \n\nEndless walking..with very little to see. Exhibits after exhibits of the same animal species (polar bears, lions, tigers) hoping I was going to see something else.. The massive lemur forest with the lemurs huddling by the doors. The 34 year old polar bear that looked sick and had me worried. The lonely bobcat, resting against the wall. \n\nThe cute baby lowland gorilla chewing on a twig and attempting to climb the rocks. The sad Mandrill with its back turned towards me. The three Patas Monkey, grooming and sunbathing. The bored \"senior chimps\" sitting and behaving human like..just gazing mindlessly into the trees. The slightly pinkish flamingos feasting in white buckets..with the beautiful pink hues absent from their bodies. The angry hornbill using its bill to chase the native squirrel away. The Pachyderm building reeks of dung but filled with beautiful Lego art work (no more elephants).\n\nI was in search for something entertaining and stumbled into the South American region. I looked up to see two beautiful red parrots (Rio!!!) resting upon the branch. \"Hellooooo\", I said. A few seconds later, I heard \"herro\". So cute, a bird speaking to me? \n\nStill, my heart wasn't content with what was in front of me..\n\nAs the sun started to fall, I sadly walked towards the exit gate, passing the African Region one last time to see off the giraffes as the glare of the sun brings tears to my eyes.", "author": "Karen S."}

The animal enclosures are large enough that the animals look comfortable and happy, but not so large that they can hide from you. Visitors are also able to get very close in. We got closer to the animals than at any zoo I've seen, we were able to see them really clearly and our photos are amazing. \n\nThe exhibit with giraffes, zebras, ostriches and some other african plains animals was our favorite. You can walk under a tunnel and into a viewing area in the middle of the enclosure. This is where we got the best view.\n\nAs far as adults go, I really enjoyed the gorilla and lion exhibits. The animals were right in front of where we were standing, just hanging out. Since it wasn't crowded there were only a few people there looking, so we could take our time and take a bunch of photos. Both the gorilla and the lion looked right at my husband while he was taking their pictures. We got amazing photos, so it was a great trip for us, too.

A lot of the animals that San Francisco Zoo has were about to die in the wild. For instance, one of their sea otters was found shot in the wild by hunters and blinded. SF Zoo took him in and now cares for him. Another example would be an eagle that was hit by a car and the accident resulted in its poor right wing because torn off. SF Zoo cares for it now and it lives to a ripe old age that many eagles in the wild don't get to see.\n\nWhile I do agree that the original zoos were cruel when they were first established, now SF Zoo seeks to promote wildlife conservation and works providing a comfortable stay for the animals, often rescuing them from certain death in the wild.\n\n---\n\nI really enjoyed my trip to the San Francisco Zoo. It's a fairly large zoo, with many different exhibits separated into the different regions of the world as well as some animals. They have a great variety of things you can check out and there are little placards in front of each exhibit as well that gives you a little nugget of knowledge. The prices are reasonable as well so trust that you won't be needing to fork over loads of money just to have a great day.\n\nTips:\n~ Be sure to check out their schedule on your map. That's when all the feeding shows are happening so if you want to see some action, keep your eye on the clock and the schedule.\n\n~ Wear comfortable shoes - you're going to be doing a lot of walking and it would be silly to wear heels or even thin sandals that don't provide maximum comfort.\n\nRoom For Improvement:\n~ When it comes to the feeding shows, I feel like the caretakers can make a bit of an effort to try and educate. For instance, explaining what they're feeding, answering questions, etc. I remember Academy of Sciences explains about the penguins and even answers questions while feeding. I don't see why the SF Zoo shouldn't do the same.\n\n~ In the Nature Walk at the Children's Zoo, I understand that they get highschoolers to present the animals but they really need to teach them to present themselves a lot better. The girls who were doing the salamander were actually really annoying, occasionally shoving each other and giggling during the presentation. As someone who did a lot of community service in high school, I took all of my tasks seriously - it's not play time you're representing yourself and the zoo.\n\nOverall, San Francisco Zoo is a great place for some wholesome family fun.

It had been years since I had been, but I remembered it to be a generally positive experience. \n\nI will tell you right now it is something you only need to experience once and then you are done. I saw no compelling reason to return. \n\nFirst off ....animals suck it's no wonder we hunt them for food. Save for a few those un-evolved bast**rds remained hidden and asleep. What a waste! Do they not know I paid good money to be entertained? I want my monkeys to dance for me. I want them to smoke, wear little leather jackets and bring me small bottles of liquor like you get from airline attendants. Oh there were a few cool animals like the squirrel monkeys, the Black Rhino ( fat a**)  and of course the ever ginger Red Raccoon looking thing. What the hell was that animal any way?  Whatever it was it lives in a jungle and of course it needs saving. They all need saving ...animals are so needy! Any way the red raccoon thingy was fuzzy , cute and playful. OH YEAH it was a Red Panda which is counterintuitive because it looks NOTHING like a Panda, not the ones in China or the one that fat bast**rd that plays for the SF Giants. \n\nThere were NO elephants ...nuff said\n\nThere was no reptile house...seriously what the f**k?!!\n\nI got all giddy about the insect house, but most of them were dead or in jars and you had to go into a ungodly humid and hot little building with kids screaming like banshees to experience dead insects. Not exactly a Costa Rica eco tour. \n\nThe highly reflective glass surrounding many of the animal displays made viewing the animals even harder, but it was the joyous spittle and sticky fingers of young crumb-crunchers all over that glass that made it a special biological collection of its own. \n\nI found many of the old buildings not open, and fountains and displays had been turned into kids playgrounds. Oh did I mention hordes of screaming children? The god**mn kids were louder than Howler monkeys. \nThere was one playground that was supposed to be Antarctica, but I referred to it as \"The worst version of Frozen ever!\"\n\nIn all seriousness the zoo is dated and the setup made it hard to see the animals. I was honestly more impressed by the Sacramento zoo and considering the size of the two municipalities I wouldn't use that quote on your Chamber of Commerce fliers SF. \n\nThe Zoo needs work... a lot of work. Oh and the Zoo needs more animals and by animals I mean live ones, and not dead or stuffed ones. FINALLY, will someone do something for god's sake about that poor Polar Bear  it was the saddest freakin thing I have ever seen and I am pretty sure they don't have green f**king fur in the wild.\n\nIf you have to choose go to The Science Academy at GG park....much much better experience over all", "author": "Kenneth F."}

Both times I have gone multiple attractions have been closed, including food places. \n\nOf course I love looking at all the animals, but it's a small zoo and it doesn't take long to see all of them.

I liked reading about the orphaned Grizzly bears and the eagles who couldn't fly.

It took place at closing time around 5:00pm and it was a little chilly but not to bad for being next to Ocean Beach. Parking was free inside the zoo entrance, usually it costs $10.00 to park inside. We waited until everything was set up and the official wedding ceremony took place at the African Wildlife Area. The arrangement was done very well and the back drop was zebras and a giant wild bird. On the other side were some wild African hoofed animals. I  think the zoo bribed the zebras to come out during the ceremony with food and after they finished they ran back into their enclosures. The area seated about 70 people and was nicely decorated.\nAfterwards, the festivities took us to the carousel, where they had an open bar and waiters/waitresses serving appetizers;tiny lamb chops, coconut shrimp, and bruchetta. All very delicious. The bartenders were all generous with their pours also.\nAll the guests got carousel rides also. \nAfter this, we went to the zoo reception center which was also set up very nicely.\nThe food service was buffet style and the food was excellent. The wait staff continued to provide food quickly when a selection ran out so the wait was not long,\nThe choices provided were sliced steak, chicken, red potatoes, grilled carrots and asparagus,\nCaesar salad, and rolls.

Nevertheless, zoos are always fun school trips for schools, so I'm glad San Francisco kids have this place to look forward to.\n\n__________________________\n\nRandom Musings:\nI'm not really sure what emotions and/or feelings looking at caged animals is s'posed to incite.

Let me just get this straight across if you are turned-off by all the \"$8 for parking is SO EXPENSIVE\", there's no reason to. \n\nWhy? Because it's $8 for the entire DAY. If you're there for 2 or 3 hours, the price is really REALLY good considering how you're in SF. \n\nIt's been a LONG LONG time since I first went to the zoo (I think I was like 7 or something) and from what I could remember before a lot of the animals were asleep and not very interesting (maybe not interesting enough for my child-attention-span). I wasn't sure what to expect, especially after reading the reviews, but I'm really glad I went regardless.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went there on a Monday and there wasn't a huge crowd at all. We got there around 11, walked around all the enclosures, ate lunch and walked around some more. I think we probably spent around a good 3-4 hours there looking at all the animals. \n\nThe tickets were $17 each per person for the adult price, which for the amount of hours we spent in there is totally justified. \n\nDuring the time we were there, a lot of the animals were up and awake. If one wasn't awake, we would walk around and before long they would be awake again. There's never really a dull moment. Plus there's feedings during specific times of the day (usually listed around the area where you buy your tickets) so it's always fun to go see that. \n\nThe petting zoo was awesome. BRING QUARTERS if you want to feed the animals; it only takes quarters! And be careful, some goats have gotten smart enough to stand on their hind legs and eat the food while you get it. \n\nThe bathrooms were ridiculously clean for a zoo and for a place that gets a lot of customers/people. Probably one of the cleanest bathrooms in a public area I've been to. \n\nMy boyfriend brought our own food because we didn't really want to pay for the food due to the fact that it's a little pricey. If you want to splurge on a drink or a churro, sure, but otherwise I wouldn't eat a whole meal there cause it can get expensive very quickly. \n\nAll in all though, a very good trip.

Pronto!\"    \n\nLast time I went, it was late spring afternoon, and I took the day off on a Wednesday.  For San Francisco residents, the first Wednesday of each month is free.  It was possibly one of the windiest days of the year.  Maybe a higher power was telling me nothing is really free.  When not waltzing in for free, admission is around $15.  There's also a parking fee, so taking the metro line L and walking over could save a few bucks.      \n\nThe zoo is medium sized and has a diverse amount of animals.  You'll probably get through it within three and half to four hours at leisurely pace.  Many of the larger mammals are either sleeping or lounging around.  In their original habitats, they aren't juggling tennis balls or doing flips at the sight of a human being, so don't expect \"performances\".  If you're lucky you'll get to see a natural behavior like the dropping a few deuces or just animals monkeying around.

We rolled into the parking lot and noticed some old buildings on the grounds which must have been part of the original zoo back in 1929.  It's boarded up and something is going to happen to the buildings. Not sure what.\n\nWe were charged for parking. I read from others they got free parking on the streets. Being a member of the Tucson Zoo, we got a bit of a discount for our visit.\n\nThe signage could be a littler clearer and informative.  I found it a bit confusing at times to navigate around using their markers. I first entered a part of the zoo that had very little traffic and again, found some very lonely and abandoned zoo enclosures. Nearby was the huge Pacayderm House. This zoo has no elephants and according to an official I spoke with, does not plan to get anymore after their elderly ones died. There is quite a variety of animals on display, including a rookery of Magallenic penguins. \n\nI felt several of the displays showed their age in wear and tear and also design. As always, I'd love to see the enclosures be more spacious. \n\nEverywhere were signs saying to respect the animals and report anyone harassing them....all this stemming no doubt from Tatiana, the Siberian Tiger, who was taunted by some tourists and escaped her grotto and killed one of them. They shot her dead as she was attacking another tourist in the group. Today I saw Sumatran and Siberian tigers as they were enjoying their raw meat treat. I must say everyone was being respectful and talking in quiet voices. \n\nI have mixed feelings about zoos but appreciate the ones who have missions and purposes for their existence. This one, while having lovely grounds, made me feel somewhat sad though I enjoyed my visit here.  I understand they, like so many other zoos, are having to deal with budget cuts in a time when they could so use a boost. I wish them, and all the animals they care for here,  the very best.", "author": "Peg P."}

Although I am not a big fan of zoos in general, this one is pretty pathetic.  Nothing resembled a natural habitat.  A good number of the exhibits were closed.  If there was no animal visible outside, they were hard to see from inside any of the exhibit areas.   The capper was the poor gorilla who simply sat in a black plastic tub and picked at his/her hands.  The poor gorilla looked absolutely depressed.  In all honesty, I have only been to 3 other zoos (including the Philly Zoo, my hometown AND the oldest in the country) and the SF Zoo was hands down the worst.   Public facilities were partly available.  Restrooms were taped off.  A latte (we did not buy one) was $7.  A piss poor experience.", "author": "J C."}

You gotta purchase it first at the ticket booth and save that ticket as your only means of exiting the place. I did read reviews about people parking on streets. Which if you drove around you'll be able to locate some public street parking. Since my boyfriend and I are not from San Francisco we didn't feel like getting lost. Plus you'll be doing plenty of walking as it is, so might as well save your energy. \n\nTickets for nonresident was $15 per person. I tried to locate some form of coupon but they were not existent. Bathrooms were pretty clean. We were able to see many animals (graffiti, gorilla, peacock, flamingo, monkeys, polar bears, penguins, lions, wallaby, sea otters, etc.). \n\nMy dislikes: there's a section where there's a lion house and when you walk in its all cages. It looked like a jail cell. It was a rather depressing imagine. I truly hope that they do not get abused. It made me think of the movie zoo keeper and how when there's a staff who doesn't care the gorilla gets abused. \n\nThere's a small steam train that you can ride on to see the zoo but it'll cost you a few bucks. It's a fairly small zoo. It took the boyfriend and I only like 3 hours. And trust me we took our sweet time walking around. The LA zoo is a bit better. Although the area where the flamingos are didn't have a funky nasty smell like the LA zoo. \n\nWhat l liked was I was able to read stories of different animals being rescued and then placed in the zoos care. That was pretty touching and makes you appreciative of what you're seeing before you.\n\nThey also have a play zone for the really small kids which included swings! :) overall, we enjoyed ourselves. My boyfriend was advised to not come on a gloomy day. We weren't quite sure why. When we went it was mid afternoon, pretty gloomy but we were able to see a lot of the animals.

I'm talking tree lights, decorations, and lights along the railings to help you see. There were entire stretches where we basically walked in darkness, not really knowing where to go (the signage was sparse as well). \n\nThe only reason I didn't demand a refund was because we watched the tap dance and magic shows, as well as the giraffe feeding (which we almost missed because, surprise, it was very poorly lit and there were no signs). The events were passable, but the tent, sound system, and seating were cheap (rickety benches and lots of feedback/volume issues). The ONLY redeeming grace for the night were the giraffes, who were amazing up close, but guess what, we came to see the zoo LIGHTS! If we wanted to see giraffes, we would come during the day.\n\nI understand that things get screwed up with the bad weather, but if half your lights are out, the reputable thing to do is to cancel the show and offer a refund, not sucker people in to see a half functioning show.

The zoo is also very clean unless you're in a food service area. Even then, there was someone actively working to clean up. It's just hard to keep completely clean because it's so windy here so everything gets blown around. Also, people tend to be slobs and they don't clean up after themselves. \n\nBefore my most recent visit, I hadn't come here in close to 5 years and it has really improved. The exhibits look much nicer now and the animals look healthy and well cared for. Many of the animals, for example the two sea otters, owls, and a few more that I can't remember, are actually permanently disabled. It's nice that the zoo provides them with a safe home and food when they would likely die in the wild. \n\nThe exhibits are done in a way that makes it easy for you to spot the animals, while still giving the animals lots of space to roam around. It doesn't look like a sad animal prison. It's not too crowded at the exhibits even though I went on a free day. The zoo is pretty spacious and you'll be walking a lot. My body definitely felt tired after all the walking I did\n\nI also liked looking for all the peacocks that roam around freely. They'd show up in the most random exhibits, like in the kangaroo area. Instead of Where's Waldo, play Where's the Peacock? \n\nTIPS:\n-Eat beforehand because the food here is expensive and it is not worth the high price. \n-Wear comfortable shoes that you won't freak out over if they get a little dirty. \n-Dress in layers. It can get very cold here because you get the cold drafts coming off from the ocean. However, it got pretty toasty when I was walking around. \n-Wear gloves. They'll keep your hands warm and you won't have to worry about touching some invisible sticky thing that some kid left behind. Seriously, why are kids so sticky?! \n-Park on the street.

We are members of the Oakland Zoo, but wanted to try something different. Although I really like the Oakland Zoo, I really enjoyed this zoo, as well. The SF Zoo is larger and flatter with more of a variety of animals. It's also located near the ocean and is a lot colder (in the summer, at least) and foggier/cloudier (which is great for photography because there isn't all that harsh, midday sunlight).\n\nThe landscaping of the zoo was just beautiful. There was a nice garden there with lots of flowers and a large fountain. The exhibits were large (in my opinion) and well taken care of. There's definitely plenty to see and do there. There are also a number of peacocks and peahens roaming the zoo, which are beautiful, but quite noisy at times.\n\nMy favorite exhibits were the tiger and lions exhibit, the red panda exhibit (so cute!), the penguins, and the river otters. I really like their tiger and lions exhibit more than Oakland Zoo's. You can see the big cats a lot better and they seemed really active toward later in the day toward closing (they were all sleeping around noon when we got there, which is to be expected). The red panda was adorable and very playful. The penguins were also cute, as were the otters. I would have loved to have seen the snow leopard up close, but he was sleeping in the corner most of the day. The majority of the animals are active in the early morning and later in the day, so don't be surprised if most of them are sleeping around midday.\n\nMy main disappointments were that many of the smaller birds and mammals were difficult to see because of the fencing of the cages they were in. The bird area with the parrots and green jays was particularly disappointing because of the small wiring of the enclosures. It definitely is a hindrance to any sort of photography you want to do (no matter how nice your equipment), let alone just standing there and admiring them. It was also a bummer that their keel-billed toucan (one of my favorite birds) was behind really thick, kind of dirty glass in the Lion House and was very hard to see. I'm hoping they find a better location for him where he's more easily viewable (like the new South American Rainforest exhibit when it opens... it was sadly closed for renovations when we went). He seemed really out of place at the Lion House.\n\nThey did have some macaws on display out in the open (like the Oakland Zoo), but you couldn't really get a good look at them because of the small fence and train tracks that you aren't supposed to cross (there was a sign forbidding it). I thought it was a little weird having them only viewable if you took the train and that nobody else could really enjoy them like at the Oakland Zoo where they are up close and personal.\n\nDespite those drawbacks, though, I'd definitely come back here.  You also get 50% off if you have a membership to a zoo that is in the zoo reciprocity program (like the Oakland Zoo). The big cat exhibit and red panda exhibit alone were worth it for me. I had an awesome day and would definitely make the trek back here later in the summer.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

Also, a lot of these animals were either wounded or unable to survive on their own in the wild - they are getting a second chance at life while helping out their species by educating others.\n\nThe only downside is that it's always nice to go to the Zoo when it's nice out - but the large majority of these animals are only active when it's not that warm out.  My advice, get there early, grab a coffee, then a beer - then wander through the path - it makes a nice winding path from start to finish so you can see everything.\n\nTotal time it took me and my friend to walk through the entire Zoo and see everything? 4 and a half hours.  Be sure to check out the Emperor Tamarin - those little guys are amazing.", "author": "Lauren B."}

Although it's not as big and as popular as the San Diego zoo, it's still a local site worth visiting. Check out the lemurs, the rhinos and the giraffes exhibits. \n\nLocated across from ocean beach the San Francisco zoo has been a landmark in San Francisco for dozens of years. Unfortunately, being so close to the water the weather is always hit or miss. Most of the time its chili and cloudy so you'll need to cuddle up for the cold weather. Admissions is pretty pricey but you learn that the majority of the funds are used to maintain and upkeep the zoo and it's animals.\n\nThe highlight of my visit was getting to see and interact with the baby giraffe. We were able to see him become acclimated to his new surroundings as well as understanding why his parents were so aggressive when people got around him. My wife and I were also able to feed the female giraffes as part of a special program where we were allowed to have a private visit at the giraffe barn. It was so cool and definitely a fun and worthwhile experience. \n\nThe best time to visit the zoo is in the morning before the crazy rush of people start to show up in the afternoon. You're able to move freely through the park with ease and see all the animals before they get scared from the hoards of people staring at them. When you need something to eat I suggest you goby other Terrace cafe. They have huge portion sizes and really decent food, even for a zoo. I personally liked the dip & dot ice cream, it was so delicious and refreshing.\n\nit was after that the fog started to roll in as our indicator to start heading out and go back home. Let me add that it's another reason to attend the zoo early. Because once the fog comes in, it's a cold and almost unenjoyable time. But don't let that scare you, I had tons of fun and so will you. It's not a huge site but it's big enough for a family to enjoy themselves. Figure out when special events are going on to increase you're overall satisfaction at the zoo. \n\nI enjoyed myself and I'm sure you will too. Until next time SF zoo!!", "author": "Donald W."}

I don't remember much, except that I was singularly unimpressed.  I came from Columbus, home of Jack Hanna... so we had a pretty good zoo as my only point of reference.\n\nFast forward 15 years, and we decide on a Saturday impromptu trip to the SF zoo.  My expectations were not high.\n\nFirst clue that we might have fun: the prominent white board by the front gate which indicates the times for various feedings.  Penguin feedings!  Hooray.  Also, it indicated that the hippo exhibition would be closed early.  Really useful information for hippo lovers.  So we headed there first and avoided disappointment.  Information is good.  (Tip: Take a photo of the white board with your camera phone to reference it later)\n\nWe really enjoyed this zoo!  It was easy to get around.  The animals were easy to view, and they had all our favorites.  Giraffes, polar bears, penguins, hippos, rhinos.  The petting zoo was closed when we got there, but I'm sure we would have enjoyed it as well.  \n\nI don't know if my memory is faulty, if I was crabby that day on my first visit, or if this zoo has improved greatly in the last 15 years.  But we loved it and will visit again.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the San Diego Zoo exists and has set a crazy high bar.  But I highly recommend a visit to the SF Zoo.  Especially if you haven't been in awhile.  \n\nBonus:  After the zoo closes at 4pm, you are within easy proximity to the beach, and to excellent creme brulee at The Bistro at Cliff House.  A lovely completion to your day.", "author": "Linda M."}

Perhaps I just had the bad luck of visiting on a day/time when most of the animals were feeling sluggish. Surprisingly though it wasn't the empty exhibits, neglected & dying vegetation, peacock running outside its display, or hordes of children that left me with a bad impression but rather the humans at the Terrace Cafe. \n\nMy appetite got the better of me so I settled with the garlic fries and equally overpriced $5 half-ass-filled cup of soda. Indisputably, I would have preferred whatever the gorillas were being fed over the order that I got, which came in a completely dripping tray.

I like how they group some animals together like they would be in the wild. For example, the zebra, giraffes, duiker and black crowned cranes were all in the African exhibit. The only way it could have been more accurate is if the exhibit was dry and unbearably hot  like the African plains. \n\nI also like how much room the animals have. The two polar bears have 3 different connecting exhibits. All of the big cats also change exhibits every day, which is also an enrichment factor, because there will be different scents each day. Their electronic tour plug-in bays are solar powered which is cool. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because some exhibits had informative signs, and others didn't. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend this zoo to anyone visiting San Francisco. It's not as big as some other zoos out there, but I think that's part of it's charm. You can walk the entire zoo in about 3 hours and your feet won't be killing you by the end of the trip.

In the recent months, the zoo welcomed 3 new members to the family: a baby giraffe, tiger and peccary. They are all so adorable, of course! When a couple of friends and I went it was a sunny and warm day. I suggest going on a cooler day or before mid- afternoon. The animals don't enjoy the heat as much, so by mid-afternoon they'll probably be taking refuge under a shade or inside their caves. Stop and talk to a docent. The two we spoke with were extremely helpful and informative. Also, if you're a San Francisco resident, don't forget to bring a valid ID to pay $3 cheaper than the regular admission.", "author": "Donna L."}

I liked that they had a schedule of animal feedings, but wish they were more frequent and had additional feedings.

First off is the parking situation. Be prepared to spend a good 20 minutes looking for free parking. I skipped all of that hassle and paid $10 to park in the Zoo's lot. It fills up quickly but I found that the later you go the better chance you will have of getting a spot in the lot.\n\nThe line to buy tickets can be really long and if you have kids with you it can be a iffy situation being that the ticket counter is across from the enticing gift and toy shop (of course). So be prepared to have your blood pressure rise a bit as kids around you start to have a major meltdown. Go in a good mood and remember that patience is a virtue. \n\nI love the San Francisco Zoo for its pretty landscape and plenty of shady areas. They have a wide variety of animals and i always see something new whenever I go. The zoo seems to be kept up well and I feel less distressed over animals being caged because they have more of a natural habitat. \n\nI must say that I always have a good time visiting this Zoo and taking in the beautiful surrounding views of the San Francisco area after wards.", "author": "Cici F."}

How can African and South American animals adapt?  But if you moved a SF native into Africa, you'd adapt too!  \n\nOverall, the enclosures seem a bit bleak and small.  I saw none animals active.  Have they forgotten how to run and frolic?  I guess if you don't have any predators after you and you're fed regularly, you don't have to move much.  And only the monkeys, flamingos, penguins and some of the birds actually had a good bunch to play with each other.  Most others were the only of its kind, but likely some of them are solitary animals to begin with.  But put them in an enclosed area, you cant help but think they are so alone.\n\nWe were fortunate to catch the feedings of the resident tiger and pride of lions.  I tell you, the moment the trainer opened up the gate, 3 intimidating lions made a grand entrance one after the other.  I gasped, yes I did.  They are everything you want a lion to be.  Huge mane, menacing paws, and adorable.  :)  The male lion was especially funny.  He did tricks w/o being told hoping to get his feed as fast as he could.  He'd open his mouth as if he wanted his throat checked... the trainer wasn't keen on that.  \n\nWe talked to a few trainers and over the years they have changed how the zoo is run.  Back in the day, they had as many as 32 big cats.  Imagine that!  Now they have 6.  Even being raised in captivity they still have territorial instincts, so the zoo has given them more space.  It's really best for the animals... and trainers.  Yes, there have been maulings in the zoo history.  Maintaining a large amount of big cats is daunting and imagine them when they are in heat.\n\nOverall, I'd give the SF Zoo a 3 1/2 stars.  I can tell they care for the animals.  You'll find some older, sad looking animals, but then you read that they are here because they suffered from wing damage or were already raised in captivity.  The SF Zoo is there to rehab them and provide for them.  And honestly, these type of facilities may be the only resource to preserve a species.  I saw a black rhino.... quite rare and on the critically endangered list.  A few beatification attempts and more natural habitats may help.\n\nBonus: The original zoo key still fits the newer informational boxes!!!", "author": "Chris T."}

I kind of want one.\n\nOther than that, this is a nicely done attraction with lots of different animals (though most in too-small cages, and why don't the polar bears have a decent-sized pool to swim in?)

The entry costs were only $24 which is fairly priced for other zoos I've gone to.\n3. All exhibit and walking areas were clean and well kept. The gorilla area was a first for me and I was beyond impressed. Among some of my favorite exhibits are the lions, orangutans, and kangaroos. \n4. If you go to this zoo, you should definitely try to be there for the grizzly bear feeding! I've never seen anything like it and we thought it was amazing to watch the bears snatching fish out of the water.\n\nCons:\n1. As one would expect, the food prices there are ridiculous.

The spirits of the onslaught of multi-ethnic visitors needed no enlivening this morning...it was free...FREE...FREEE! \n\nReal estate comes at such a premium in SF that it is no wonder that a wild animal from the third world would be drawn to a seaside piece of property with free meals and accommodations. I'm sure they were shown the time-share video that promised the glory of a California lifestyle with the European-style charm of local amenities and service. Once they put their deposits down and said farewell to the fellow members of their species, I imagine there was no looking back for these brave creatures.\n\nThat's at least my explanation for the forlorn looks I saw on the faces of the animals who managed to make an appearance this morning. Today was not only the 4th of July but the traditional free first Wednesday of the month, a double whammy to the staff there, I'm sure. The stampede of irksome parents with their double strollers merely proves that Darwin was right...we are barely one step ahead of the primates we're looking at from the other side of the railing.\n\nI have a confession to make - I was actually on the Board of Directors for about three years, more a corporate obligation than anything else - so I know how much effort it has taken to get the zoo even to this point. But I have to admit five years after my departure, I am still rather disconcerted that the cat cages still exist. Also frustrating are the dirty tinted windows that make glare inevitable on any photo you take and  the chain-link fence which makes any reasonable photo impossible. Signs were faded or plain gone.\n\nThe biggest frustrations were the missing animals. I was looking forward to having rainbow lorikeets land on my head at Binnowee Landing where they usually fly free under an expansive net. Closed. Oh OK, let's go see the koalas. Closed. Hmmm, how about the tigers? Sleeping in the back.\n\nGranted this is the drawback of a zoo that pursues a natural habitat environment. But nothing epitomized the sadness of the zoo more than watching a young antelope pace back and forth scraping his broken-off antler against the chain-link fence for relief. At least I thought it was an antelope since there wasn't a sign.\n\nThere were some joys to be had nonetheless - the Magellanic penguins swimming in some awfully green water, the peacocks walking about, the grizzlies at play in their new exhibit, the lemurs coming out of the tree tops. I was thinking that the lemurs and giraffes are probably the only ones who have a shot at enjoying the ocean view here. By the way, I have to take some credit for the revitalized main entrance on the Great Highway side since I voted for the final design of that (I was pushing for the big gift shop you see there today...you can never have enough zoo snow globes).\n\nNo surprise that it was super-crowded today, but I'm sure it's more manageable when the $11 general admission is paid. I still feel the zoo feels isolated out there, and parking can get full quickly. There's only one transfer from the L-line to the 23 to get here by MUNI, and they give you a dollar off for your effort if you keep your transfer. Sure, it's not the San Diego Zoo, but whose is...other than San Diego, of course?\n\nHey, hey, hey....if we could talk to the animals, learn their languages \nThink of all the things we could discuss \nIf we could walk with the animals...talk with the animals, \nGrunt and ...squeak and ..squawk with the animals, \nAnd they could squeak and squawk and speak and talk to us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-24", "description": "This review is for the zoo events. Here is my breakdown of the wedding we had here: \n\nCOST: We got great value for a wedding in the city. The only way we could beat the price of holding a wedding at the zoo was to get a permit to hold an outdoor wedding at a park/beach. This was hands down the least costly place to hold a wedding at a SF landmark with full-service catering. \n\nLOCATION: What you give up for not being central in city you make up for having free parking. Trying paying for an event downtown and the parking bill alone will easily out-price an open bar while giving your guests a headache. The zoo offered the easiest parking in the city. The only disadvantage is that this isn't a location where taxis will quickly arrive on a weekend.\n\nCATERING MANAGER - Trust me, this will make or break you. She was amazing flexible and helped us every step of the way. She found ways to make our event cost effective whereas other event coordinators I've worked with find ways to make the events costlier. She worked with us the entire way to help make setting up and breaking down that much easier. Also, she was diligent about working with outside vendors. \n\nMEAL: The food was hands down amazing. We expected that the zoo would only offer chicken nuggets and fries but they have a great chef that makes surprisingly amazing dishes. During our tasting, we were amazed by the selection and options they gave us. \n\nLOCATION OPTIONS: Surprisingly, you have options where you can hold events at. We went with the traditional Safari/Carousel option but were looking at holding our event at other locations. Obviously, it makes a theme for an event simple \n\nSTAFF: We found staff extremely friendly and well organized. There was enough staff for the event to ensure that our guests didn't get lost in the zoo. I've worked with other locations where they don't provide any direction or guest services. This will cost you in hiring more assistants or having guests wander in panic as they miss out on your ceremony. \n\nSUMMARY: I've worked on putting together large events in the past but this was hands down one of the easiest to plan and execute. The zoo was a great value for a wedding/event in the city and it's one of the best business decisions we've made. \n\nPS Thanks to all the yelpers that came!", "author": "Dan T."}

The zoo needs some help thought, donations etc.  Many of the enclosures have not been changed or improved in many many years.  The bathrooms were not that clean and need to be updated.  There was a line to get in, I was kind of shocked by that but it moved pretty quickly. I will buy tickets on line next time.  This is the good part of the review.  I was there with 5 children and they had a really wonderful time.  The rides are $5.00 each.  Lunch and a snack  is about $15.00 per person and admission is $20.00, parking is $10.00 or park on the street for free.  THE KIDS HAD A GREAT TIME.  When I got home I logged onto the website and made a small donation, it cost quite a bit to run a zoo and this zoo needs support.  Go with your kids, have fun and if you afford it, make a donation.

I guess there are some plans in the works for significant revamp, especially of the \"tropical forest\" area and building.  \n\nThe one thing that gripes me, and maybe it can't be helped:  We arrive just after they open at 10AM, and no animals are out. We walk around for about an hour.  No animals.  Finally I run into a zoo keeper and ask. The reason?  All the animals are eating and dont come out until 11 or after.  Huh????  Then why, oh why, do you open at 10??? If you have ever been anywhere with little kids, you know they have ziltch for patience.  My two five year olds really were not happy no animals were out.  \n\nFinally, after waitiing about an hour and a half, they started appearing.

But cats are kinda worthless like that, so I can't really complain.  The tapir and the anteater were oddly interesting.  They both kept sticking their tongues out at us.  \n\nThe (newly opened) Tropical Rainforest was rad.  There were dozens of butterflies floating about and loads of turtles and macaws.  It reminded me how much I need a vacation. \n\nFlamingos are always awesome, but the Children's Zoo was a surprisingly good time.  For some reason I thought it wouldn't be, but the meerkats and prairie dogs were pretty sweet and the birds of prey at Hawk Hill were super b.a.

However, the ocean view when you get to the parking area is great. \n\nWhen I got to the event during 11AM (when the event began), it was peak hours for parking. Since I didn't want to arrive late, we ended up having to pay an extra fee for valet because it was so difficult to find or even see a space. So even though I had a prepaid \"general parking ticket\", it was pretty much useless and a hassle.\n\nBecause of the first impression of the overly busy parking lot, I didn't expect much from the trip. However, the customer service of the event employees were good. They made sure to politely and subtly(!) check that we were admitted. The catering coordinators were also very good with maintaining a stocked food area.\n\nIn terms of the zoo visit, we were able to get all of the exhibits in 3 hours. Snack vendors are just enough and strategically placed. Boyfriend suckered me into buying some Dippin' Dots and cotton candy for us. Get in on that Little Puffin train ride + Carousel (yee!). Mad props to the very friendly train operator who made all the waiting kids happy by waving at passersby and to the waiting line before each departure. Also, mad props to the carousel ticket taker who didn't judge that I really wanted to ride the giant plastic cats. She even gave a pro-tip: the ones on the outside don't move up & down. \n\nThe highlight was probably when there was a large crowd staring at the rhino exhibit and a bunch of kids were voicing how disappointed they were that the rhino wasn't being active. Upon hearing this, everyone saw the rhino sit up and start walking in circles. Then it proceeded to take a minute long, HUGE, pee. As in \"Piss off, humans\". Okay, well it was what I feel like the rhino was thinking... it was hilarious seeing the reaction in the crowd.  So mad props to the rhino.\n\nThe zoo is also a 10 min drive from Japantown too, so we were able to grab some yummy bites after, which is very important. Overall, the experience in the zoo is good.

The facility is extremely clean and has a beautiful and spacious layout.  They have their own parking lot for $10 the whole day, or you can park on the street for free.\n\nI love how they have a Children's Zoo, packed with a bunch of hands on activities for the little ones.  Petting Zoo, insect room, a playground, and info on different type of pets and pals one can have.\n\nThey have all sorts of animals, and they seem happy enough.  Although, I wondered why some of the bigger animals had such smaller confinements.  I had fun and I think the per person price tag is totally worth it.\n\nTips: bring a sweater cause this part of SF can get chilly.  Purchase those little keys that you can enter into the \"boxes\" at most animal exhibits so that you can get more information on the animals.  You can pack your own lunch/snacks/drinks!  Thats a plus for those who don't want to spend money at their cafe.  There are ins/outs, just get stamped for reentry!  Bring your camera, and take lots of pictures =).  Read the fun facts for each animal.  Try and get there as early as you can so that you don't have to rush through the exhibits.   I got there at 12pm and stayed until closing at 5pm.

San Fransicso Zoo in not one of the tourist filled areas that so much of downtown and the piers see all year round. It was a serene and beautiful area to observe the wonders of captive animals from around the world. The zoo is easily accessable by the muni.  After getting off at the last stop, you simply take a short walk tot the ocean, grab some pictures and walk a couple blocks to the zoo entrance.  There, you buy a cheap (I believe it was $14) ticket with $2 off for taking the muni and enter the zoo.  The zoo was very easy to navagate. So many zoos are like a maze which makes it difficult to see everything without back tracking a lot. Very little back tracking is required at the San Francisco Zoo.  I was really impressed with the animal habitats as the zoo made it difficult for the animals to hide from the public. I only remember not being able to see the snow lepord as it was hiding behind a bush eating. All the rest of the enclosures were accessable from different sides making it nearly impossible for the animals to hide.  You just never know what adventure you will find in the zoo.  I found a girl that I went to high school with in central Illinois over 10 years ago.  We just saw each other at the zoo and asked if we went to school together.  Ended up spending 2 hours together catching up.  So go to the zoo and have an adventure.\n\nAnd as always, Have Fun!!!", "author": "Christian H."}

The weather was cloudy and cool, perfect on my opinion. The visitors were plenty but not overwhelming.

The animals, zebra and giraffe were our favorites, were all walking about and easily seen. On the color-coded map we saw the Southern areas, orange, brown, and yellow. Most animals were out and out. The Pachyderm House was closed, and the lions were sleeping in plain sight, but we saw plenty otherwise. Two rhino species (one fed while a docent spoke), penguins, otters, leopard, tigers, monkeys, birds. \n\nAfter three hours, including sandwiches from home by the gorillas and a rest by the Rhino, I was ready to go and return another day. I hope it's just as cloudy and cool. \n\nI like zoos. Possibly more than my eldest who kept asking what there was to do at a zoo and while there, wanted to get to the playground.

One of them mofo's went as far kicking me (luckily not with force) as I tightly gripped my fiddy cent stash of veggie pellets, and another offender nuzzled my butt with its nose (and fairly hard at that) during round 2 of pellet procurement.\n\nThe fun begins when you put a pellet or two in a child's hand, and see them run like Forest Gump when the sheep start to smell food (or fear). But don't worry, as aggressive as they may be, I think they're cooler to the kids, because the wooly smelly vegans know the adult$ are the one$ who hold the moolah.\n\nMy advice, go in with no fear. Don't be intimidated by these hippy crotch sniffing wooly creatures. Get spooked, and you drop your stash and the sheep n' goats will gobble them like the stickiest of the icky.\n\nFriends were still spooked from the Tatiana tiger mauling episode, and didn't want to visit the zoo, but they ended up coming and were cool with the new improvements made to make the exhibit a lot more secure. Although one of them wondered if the lions could scale the wall....\n\nThe Little Puffer steam engine train is working again, and as loud as ever.\n\nThe penguin exhibit still reeks of fishy sardines, but if you are a mondo raw fishy lover, this reekage might cause some brain cells to be stimulated in a sort of wrongful sinful and weird way that you don't want to tell anyone about.\n\nThe nature trail inside the children's zoo is always a fun stroll for the kids, as they can get up and close with petting small turtles, hedgehog. And there's an armadillo on certain days, plus a chinchilla (can't pet them). And parents, make sure you have them hit the disinfectant foam soap dispenser on their way out.\n\nThe dippin dots \"ice cream\" thing here is prepackaged (like Capri Sun drinks), unlike the scoop into various cup sizes to order like at Discovery 6 flags. The \"rainbow\" flavor mix contains a series of colored dyes, so stick with either cookies and cream, banana split or that one other flavor.\n\nZoo food and offerings are still as dismal as ever. Thankfully it doesn't take long to get right into the Sunset for all sorts of better A$N grub and drink.", "author": "Ken K."}

I mean, when you take your kids out and check on the Rhino with its horn cut off what kind of answer will you give them when they ask why they did it? Or why the Gorilla family has two mommas that refuse to play with their baby.

The zoo was better than it was last time I visited. The African area is beautiful and well designed, as is the Lemur Island where my partner and I watched them play for a good half hour. The new grizzly bear exhibit is great, and the bears came right up to the glass! And for my partner, the petting zoo was one of the highlights of the trip.\n\nDespite the clouds (and it was pretty cloudy), we still saw a ton of animals. The tarantula exhibit in the South American aviary. I know that every trip to the zoo doesn't always yield all the animals the zoo has (no zoo can offer because keeping them on display constantly that and giving two stars to a zoo because of it is ridiculous... go to sea world if you want your animals to jump through hoops and be on display all day) but I feel that even on a bad day you'll still see animals, especially with all the keeper talks, which you could follow and spend a a good 2-3 hours. Chances are you will probably see a lot of animals.  \n\nI will say that with children, plan your trip well and don't expect to see all the zoo. It's huge. This being said, this is one of the most kid friendly zoos I have ever been to. They have a playground inside the zoo, and the kids area is a lot of fun (even for adults!). And for the adults, the raptors (the birds not the dinosaurs) in the kids area were all out despite the weather being cold, and truly neat to see. \n\nAnd to end our stay, the people in the gift shop were beyond friendly and helpful. They even grabbed us on the way out just to make sure we saw our photos with no pressure to buy them. \n\nIt was a great day. Don't listen to the bad reviews, just do it.

A lot of people on Yelp complained that the animals were sleeping! Well yes, animals do that. Check the feeding times for the Bears and Penguins. The Grizzly bear is fantastic fun!!! The petting zoo is great for the little ones. \n\nYes, some of the pens date back to the 1940s. But others are new and fresh..check out Grizzly Gulch, the new seal exhibit, the Gorillas, and of course the new area with the Giraffes. \n\nThe membership is a bargain at about $100 bucks a year. I come in with my daughter and don't feel like I have to see the whole place in a day. We'll come in see 5 things, do the petting zoo, and come back in a week or two. \n\nThe zoo also participates in a variety of conservation studies and veterinary programs. Many of the animals have been rescued from unfortunate situations and many are helping with genetic research and worldwide conservation studies. \n\nThe annual membership is tax deductible and can get you free admission at other zoos.\n\nAnyway, bottom line is this....set your expectations it's $12-15 per adult (and children 3 and under are FREE) -- this is not Disneyland and it's not the San Diego Zoo.

We parked for free on the street and avoided the parking fee by not parking in their lot. The entrance price per adult was $17.00. We got there right after they opened and I was excited to see the gorillas. We waited a few minutes and then they came out.  Most of the animals we saw were not active and just resting. Not as I remember as a child going there. I have to admit it was a bit depressing and sad knowing they can't roam free in their natural habitat. But I do understand the educational purpose of the zoo. Bring your own water and snacks. A bottled water at the zoo is 4 dollars. Wear comfortable shoes and bring a jacket it can get cold and windy. We walked all over and mostly had a good time exploring. We were there on a Saturday and it was baby stroller palooza, I was almost tripped by someone who was pushing a stroller and not looking where they were going.

Silly animals. \n\nAnyway, this place is large, and many 'exhibits' had plenty of room for the animals to move about. There were a handful of spots that were closed off or missing animals, but overall I liked the variety they had. The penguins were the highlight for me. Yay penguins! By the time we got to the children's zoo they were shutting down so we didn't get to see those animals :( \n\nI personally think the price is a little high, but then again I haven't been to a zoo in a loooong time. $15 for non-SF residents and $12 for residents.

It has so many great memories and i remember seeing all the amazing lively animals. I remember going to the old lion house where for a little period of time during the day they would FILL with all their big cats. You could hear the place roar and it was really a sight to see standing in this old victorian building.\n\nUnfortunately, whether because of funding or the lack of interest this place has gone downhill. many of their amazing old animals have passed and not replaced, and many of the buildings lie unused. The animals seem a little sad and the place feels deserted at times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-19", "description": "NOTE, I apologize for turning this review into a semi-rant but this is what I took away from my experience:\n\nToday I visited the SF Zoo for the first time in at least 10 years. It has changed considerably since I last visited as a kid. I tend to avoid zoos now that I've grown up. I find them pretty depressing when you consider these animals will never roam in their natural habitats again. But since I don't have the money yet to travel to distant countries to view them in the wild, the SF Zoo is the closest many of us ever get to see these animals. \n\nI have only recently begun to appreciate wildlife and I have quite an interest in big cats, so seeing them outside of a nature documentary was pretty exciting. I was able to view the Sumatran tigers, Leanne & Larry, as well as their new 8-week old cub. The cub was adorable, pestering her mother and attacking everything in sight. The glass barriers in some areas are pretty filthy & scratched-up so its a little hard to see clearly at times. \n\nWhile the enclosure for Leanne & her cub was quite a rich environment for the two to live in, the rest of the areas for the big cats were smaller and frankly pretty bleak. The Siberian tiger slowly paced around its enclosure while constantly bellowing(not roaring, it was more of a crying/wailing tone) as it was gawked at by dozens of loud kids and visitors. The snow leopard hid itself next to a log, its head wearily resting on its paws as if it was waiting to die. The bobcat also paced frantically back and forth in its small enclosure. I admit I'm no zoologist, but these did not seem like \"happy\" animals to me.\n\nHowever I was glad to see that other animals like the gorillas, zebras and giraffes seemed to have nicer areas to live in. I cannot fault the SF Zoo for too much else besides the size of their enclosures. The staff seems to genuinely love their work and they are definitely providing better care than animal theme parks or circuses. Its a really beautiful place which has been carefully designed to incorporate elements of lands where some of these animals come from. While the SF Zoo is only 100-acres, its spread out in a way that gives you a long walk if you wish to see everything. Also wear layers since it tends to get cold out there. \n\nBut I remain a critic(no I am not a supporter/member of PETA or the ALF)...\nSo why you ask, am I still critical of zoos?\n\n1) Because their main purpose is exhibition, NOT conservation. Some zoos may donate some of their profits here and there to conservation efforts, but how much of that money is used and where it goes/how effective it is for conservation is debatable.\n2) The zoo's goal to breed endangered animals for species survival is somewhat pointless when you consider many of these animals only know captivity and not their true environments. Few animals that spend any length of time in captivity can be released in the wild again.\n3) It is cruel to restrict a wild animal's range of movement or their natural behavior, EVEN if loved and properly cared for. Large predators for instance, require large amounts of land to roam and were meant to hunt, not to be fed raw meat. Many animals go insane, sometimes banging their heads against walls or constantly pacing back & forth. I am a believer in open-range zoos, even though they cost more and are probably much harder to maintain. \n4) \"A fat lion lying in a zoo enclosure waiting for chopped up cow meat once a day is not the same as that animal with amber shoulder blades pumping mechanically through the tall grass downwind of the buffalo, stopping, looking, snapping a look at eight other sets of black tipped ears ahead, in a silent signal adapted by evolution for the hunt. It's not the same as that animal that shoots out of the grass and grasps on to a buffalo in full flight, nearly a thousand pounds of muscle, and brings it to its knees with only its teeth and claws. One is a 3-D image. One is a real living, fighting, killing lion that influences the habitat it lives in, in Africa (and Asia.) There is no replacement for that.\" -Dereck Joubert\n\nAs I visited the SF Zoo, many questions were raised in my mind. If animals have no rights, then what gives us the right to exploit them and kill them? Are we justified in doing so just because \"we can\"? How soon will it be before the only wild animals left on Earth are the ones you see in zoos? Is it possible that many iconic animals like the tiger, lion, elephant and rhino will become extinct before our children grow up? Is the damage irreversible?", "author": "Paul E."}

The zoo was pretty deserted, which was nice in a way since we did not have to deal with parking issues or crowds.  One thing we really liked about the layout of the zoo was that the trees and greenery were seamlessly integrated with exhibits and the walkways.  Unfortunately, the penguin feeding takes place around 10:30 AM, so we missed that.  The zoo itself is not very large, so we were able to thoroughly visit all of the exhibits in 3 hours, with extra time in between to chit chat and get to know one another better:)\n\nDo not skip out on the South American Tropical Rainforest building.  There is a new interactive Rainforest Adventure Maze that's pretty fun and surprisingly enlightening.  The maze leads you through a series of questions, right answers leading you through the maze, wrong answers leading to dead ends.  My friend and I are both pretty smart cats so we got them all right...except we got tricked on the last one =P  Also included in the maze are monkey bars, zip lines, long jump, and ropes for kids to have fun and simulate different parts of the rainforest.  In case you were wondering, I was slow on the bars while my friend was super quick and agile.\n\nThe bald eagle is unfortunately a loser as it cannot fly, so it just chills on a branch all day long; however, my friend loves this country and chanting, \"USA!  USA!  USA!\"  so anytime he gets to see a bald eagle it's always a treat.  He also really liked how peacocks walk around and mingle with park guests.  If you're lucky they might even show their feathers to you, but no such luck for us :(  It was also interesting to note the discrepancy between the exhibits - some of the animals, such as the lemurs, had pretty nice enclosures, whereas others, such as the bears and lions, did not.\n\nIn summary, The SF Zoo is definitely not world class, but they do have great animals and is a fun way to spend a few hours in the city.", "author": "Andrea W."}

The African Savanah with the giraffes is a big highlight from a \"wow\" perspective. The petting zoo, though, is an amazing place for the kids. Feeding animals by hand is amazing. Don't miss this for sure. You have to put quarters in for the food, but there are plenty of change machines and the staff is really helpful. The train ride is really fun and pretty fast (in a good way). Also the food area is quite reasonable given the portions. My only issue is that many of the big animals seem very far away.

A family our size (14 children) would  never be able travel throughout the world to see the various types of animals that they had on exhibit for the past 60 plus years.  It perked our appetite  to go to the library or buy books to learn more of the hundreds of mammals, snakes, birds, etc.\n\nIn the 1980s, (7 years), I was a volunteer for the Zoo doing various types of behind the scene work (i.e., feeding the small critters like monkeys, penguins, birds, goats, etc.).  Throughout the years, I would bring my sons, nieces or nephews to the Zoo and I must admit  that for the last year I have not visited the Zoo until today (January 3, 2008).\n\nI felt a sadness for this place that I had found to be so full of surprises and joy, the playground, the train, the Merry-Go-Round, the petting zoo and all the beautiful inhabitants.  I wanted to learn what has changed, what can I do to make a difference.  So, I joined as a Guardian Keeper and will be signing up as a volunteer on January 17 for training.\n\nWhat I have learned so far.  The Zoo has improved the compounds and have been on a tier program of improvements for all its inhabitants.   They have just completed the Hearst Grizzly Gulch, rescued animals like the elephant seal pups from the Marine Mammal Center spent the final part of their  rehabilitation, exchanging and learning from animal experts from all over the world to improve the care and returning rescued mammals to their original location.  Of course, the babies that were orphaned were hand raised and their chance for survival would be in the Zoo.  For example, once the two male giraffes were grown and strong enough to start their own herd, they were  moved to the Birmingham Zoo in Alabama and Niambi Zoo in Illinois, this year.  And, the new addition of two new males and four new red females added to the Australian Walkabout.\n\nLest, I  will never forget the beautiful and the short-lived life of Tatiana, the Siberian Tiger.  We all know the unfortunate story and hopefully, that the lesson learned and improvements for the protection of the existing inhabitants.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nOn January 17, I attended the Orientation for Volunteers and signed on for the Animal Resource Center (ARC) .  First, I have to go to the local Police Department (either Daly City, Colma or San Mateo Police) and have a background check and finger printed (how exciting!).  Then, I will be making arrangements with the ARC Coordinator for my schedule.  I wanted to work with the small critters that are brought to the School in the Bay Area.  I declined the reptiles and snakes (they have the big Boa!)   I told them anything that has teeth bigger than mine I do not want to feed it or it might eat me.\nSo, I will be handling chincillas, small monkeys, birds of all kinds, etc.  The shifts are 8 hours increments once a week or more if you choose.  Check with Liz Brager (Volunteer/Docent Manager) at 753-7122 for scheduling and more information. So, stay posted for my adventure at the SF Zoo!", "author": "Marian G."}

Was able to catch some grizzly bears playing with each other too, but that was about it.

There is also a little train that will take you around the zoo, for an extra fee of course.  \n\nThe only negative thing I can say about this zoo is that I feel like some of the animal housing structures were kind of old and could use a face lift.  When you first come into the zoo, you walk into the section with the giraffes which is by far my favorite part.  The enclosures look new as well as the viewing platforms.  However, it seems the further you get into the zoo, the less newer it feels.  Don't get me wrong, I love how a lot of the structures still have the art deco feel. I can just imagine kids running around from animal to animal.  But a lot of it feels out of place in 2012.  By the time you get to the bears, it seems like they have all been but forgotten.  \n\nAdmission price is a little expensive, however what in San Francisco isn't?  If you are staying at a hotel, check the front desk.  I was able to get a flyer that had a free child's admission coupon on it.  Parking is $10 unless you can find free parking on the street.  But I don't even try and fight it, I just give in and pay to park.  \n\nThere are several cafes through out the zoo and lots of places to enjoy your lunch.  I would recommend bringing in your own food as the zoo food is pricey.  \n\nAnother thing I like about the zoo is the location.  It is not in the city so you don't even feel like you are in San Francisco.  It is in close proximity to the beach as well.  \n\nAdults and children a like will enjoy this zoo and the animals!", "author": "Jenna T."}

Why, you may ask.  Well, to put things delicately, last week I had the pleasure of viewing two gorillas engaging in the act of mad monkey love!!!\n\nIt started off like any normal visit, showing my parents and their friends the African exhibit with the giraffes, emus, and other fabulous animals.  We meandered around the corner and eventually wound up circling the gorilla exhibit.  I've always been perplexed by this part of the zoo, because looking at the gorillas and seeing them stare back with such incredible intelligence in their eyes has made me feel a bit bittersweet about the notion that they are captives in a zoo.  Nonetheless, it is one of my favorite exhibits.\n\nThis day was a little different.  It was a Monday, so the zoo was mostly empty of tourists.  There was a group of zookeepers doing their rounds together, one of whom seemed to be lecturing the others on each exhibit.  She talked to her students about the gorillas by name and each of their personality quirks.  We all watched at some of the drama between the silverback (male head of the family) and one of the youngin's.  \n\nThen, suddenly, the zookeeper motioned to the group to move on, mumbling something about the gorillas getting overstimulated by their presence.  I looked back into the exhibit, and at first my brain only registered that the silverback was standing with his back to myself and my parents.  I wondered if he was misbehaving by defecating in public or something along those lines.  Then I realized his hips were moving.  What we were witnessing was much more amorous in nature (literally...sorry about the pun, y'all!)!!!\n\nWe stared, unable to rip our eyes away.  It felt so wrong to keep watching, but we couldn't walk away, as with a trainwreck.  My mother and I kept exchanging embarrassed giggles, but we stayed for the whole show. \n\nIt didn't last that long, and afterwards the silverback retired back into their enclosure, while his mate just walked off casually into another area of the exhibit.  We were left to ponder if perhaps their relationship has lost the flame of passion over the years, or maybe they are just friends with zoological benefits.  Who's to say?!\n\nAfterwards, we enjoyed the lemurs and big cats and monkey exhibits, spent some meaningful time with the penguins, and so on.

I'm a little biased, in that I have a few fond childhood memories of visiting the zoo.  But, overall I enjoyed my recent visit here (on a Monday afternoon, which was a great way to beat the crowds).\n\nThe African section of the zoo is impressive -- several giraffe (including one baby), zebra, and kudu are all visible just a few yards from the fence.\n\nI also enjoyed the stretch of bear and big cat enclosures.  They were a little on the \"depressing zoo\" side -- old and crappy exteriors, cramped interiors, but at least the animals looked happy.\n\nI'm always a sucker for insect houses, and this one doesn't disappoint.  Beehives, lots of camouflaged insects, and a nice row of arachnids.  Woo!  \n\nUnfortunately, you'll have to walk to the middle of the kiddy's section to get to the insect house.  The children's section was a bit of a disappointment.  There's simply not enough to get your hands on, with the exception of a very ho-hum petting zoo.  Zoo's just aren't fun until you can get your hands on something scaly and/or slimy.\n\nThe park's layout sucks.  Maybe it's great, but I can't tell;  there are far too few signs telling you where you've been, or where you should go next.  One member in our party had a map, fortunately.  I'd prefer to just walk around without having to resort to a map every twenty minutes.\n\nAlso, the price is really steep ($15/head, but you can get that reduced $3 if you procure proof of SF residency and a muni pass).\n\nStill, though, I could see myself going back here to entertain out-of-town guests, especially animal lovers or kids.", "author": "Bill H."}

Who the hell decided to build a zoo next to Daly City? Same guy that decided to build Candle Stick I guess.\n\nTIPS n TRICKS:\nA. Bring your ID. It's cheaper for locals than for tourists. Also cheaper for students. Cheapest for elderly but they charge $30 for an electric scooter so beware.\n\nB. For God's sake... don't buy any food there. That's crazy talk. Here's the drill. About 1/2 block up on Sloat is George's Zoo. Best f%#@ing sandwiches in the area. Cheap, too. Cost you 1/4 of what the zoo charges for horrible food.\n\nC. Don't drink before going. You'll fall asleep for sure. Def an \"upper\" or hallucinogen kinda place. Trust me, the animals don't move a lot so you may as well imagine that they are.\n\nD. Parking sucks arse. Try to go on a weekday to improve your chances. You can also try to get there about 2-3 hours before they close and a lot of the rock star spots will be open by then.\n\nE. Bring a baby stroller. Who cares if you have a baby or not?! Everyone has one so just bring it!\n\nF. Don't forget your camera. They actually try and charge people for photos at the gate. lol\n\nG. Wear something you won't mind getting shat upon (is that a word?). There are lots of seagulls in the area and I've seen them bomb the customers with wet surprises from above.\n\nH. Enjoy yourself. It's a great place to learn, people watch, and see a lot of happy children ( that does not include the employees who cry a lot ).\n\nNOTE: A hear that the concession stands at the Zoo are great for employee theft. They have no real accounting there so the boss has no idea how much you sold or how much should be in the register. Woot!", "author": "Selino V."}

This one is embarrassingly old school and doesn't even pretend to try and educate visitors. It's just like a big freak show.  The only people who seemed engaged in any kind of educational activity were some of the school-age volunteers to work at the children's zoo. Both stars for them. Cool kids. \n\nDespite the many signs asking visitors to be quiet or to not bang on the glass, or throw things, or feed the animals, most of the visitors seemed to be engaged in at least one of these activities at any given time. A sign that explains that loud noises are disturbing to the animals will be guaranteed to have at least one person standing there, making a great example for the kids, yelling at the animals:\n\n\"HEY!!!......It won't look over here....HEY!!! HEY!!! Why isn't it moving? Try throwing something at it....here, give me the baby's pacifier so I can throw it at that animal....it's still not moving....why are we supposed to want to protect these animals, they're boring....this sucks...do you think they have Coors here? I could really use a warm beer in a can.\"\n\nI have any opposition to zoos, so long as the animals are treated humanely and I don't have to listen to your child's ear-piercing screams because they didn't get cotton candy. In fact, I came up with a very creative solution to California's prison overcrowding problem while we were at the zoo. It involves sex offenders and grizzlies.

We live in LA, and I might add, that the SF Zoo compares favorably to LA's and San Diego's zoo (minus the pandas). The price is very affordable and worth the intellectual investment. If you're not a zoo member but a member at another AZA zoo or aquarium, you can get half off the $15 general admission price. Just be sure to show your membership card and ID.\n\nThe habitats are well constructed and the animals are very active, especially during the opening hours. You have your big ticket animals as well, such as the big cats, rhinos, bears, etc. We were sad that the Tigers were lying so far away from the spectators. The glass enclosing the Tiger dens need to be cleaned. They were so opaque and stained at the time we visited. One of the main attractions has to be the penguins. They have their own little island. Very playful and close to you! \n\nMy daughter loved the Little Puffer train. It's $4 per person but free for the under three-year-olds. The train is quite popular and a line will form. It'll go around its track a couple of times. The carousel is $2, and free for accompanying adults. \n\nIf you're looking for free parking, you can park along Sloat Blvd. It's best to go right around opening time because by noon, parking will be impossible to find.

It is not necessary for so many animals to be suffering in small, rundown zoos that various cities across the nation are unable to maintain, and the SF Zoo is a perfect example.  \n\nSince banning zoos entirely would not fly, I think we should have a very small amount of zoos in this country - destination zoos, that people would travel to and center their vacations around (like Disney World).  Maybe one for each region of the country. Large, well-kept zoos where the animals have enough space and resources to be able to live their lives in a somewhat more comfortable situation.  There is no reason to justify every halfway decent sized city in America having a zoo.  Multiple cities are unable to properly maintain these zoos due to budget issues, and the animals are the ones suffering because of it.\n\nI'm sure you are already thinking of the particular incident I am going to mention as an example of why - Tatiana at the San Francisco zoo.  That was a combination of multiple factors: a run down facility that was unable to keep the tiger in captivity, zoogoers that were taunting the animal, and an animal that acted out due to the poor living situation it was forced to live in.  When you actually go to that tiger exhibit at the SF Zoo it's easy to see why that incident happened, and shocking that there haven't been more incidents like that.  It is one of the most depressing, inhumane things to see as it is basically a small setup of various square concrete spaces that are obviously not adequate to house tigers or lions, with cloudy plexiglass windows to look at the motionless, depressed animals with.  The entire zoo is a pit of death and depression, in my opinion.\n\nWhen you take a step back and look at it, it does seem a bit unbelievable just how many run-down zoos exist in this country, and how nobody seems to take issue with it.

Goats meander free within the children's zoo (and poop and pee everywhere too); kids are allowed to pet many animals, and there are sinks right outside for clean-up afterwards. \n-If you can, try to secure a SF family fun pass to the attraction for free admission for up to two adults and two children.

I had to constantly ask zoo employees.  Maybe they are inside somewhere? The zoo  no longer has any elephants, which I was looking forward to seeing.\n\nThe installation of huge glass walls on top of the fence in the lion areas means you don't have a good experience viewing the lions and there are no more lion feedings.As another poster said, there are many vacant areas.\n\n When I asked about the elephants, a friendly zoo person told me to go look at the insect exhibit. I am not fond of insects and have no desire to go look at them.All the employees I talked to at the Zoo were very helpful and friendly.\n\nI bought a waffle Ice cream cone for $4.50 and it was possibly the worst Ice cream(if thats what it was) that I have ever eaten. It tasted like chocolate flavored frozen water soft serve style. The wait to buy this on a Friday afternoon was 15 minutes as there was only one person at the register, taking orders and yelling to the cooks in the back for food orders.\n\nThe Gorilla exhibit was nice and I loved the Giraffe but overall, I would not return as the over all experience was very boring.", "author": "Mike M."}

I'm really just a giant ten year old, who isn't actually that giant. \nThe San Francisco Zoo did not disappoint. We went on a weekday so it was pretty dead, which I liked because there was no competition for the animal sight seeing. \nI really appreciated how much the zoo worked on making nice exhibits for the animals. Lots of open outdoor spaces for the animals to play in. I really loved the lemur exhibit! They had an outdoor area with lots of tall trees for them to climb, plus an indoor area with climbing stuff for them. They seemed to be having a good time in it. I've never really seen a zoo with so much to offer for the animals. It's nice to know that they are trying to make their captive lives the best that they can. \nSo yeahh I would say that the SF Zoo is definitely something you should check out if you are in the area.

The staff there will help you setup the centerpieces if they are simple.  They have round tables and wooden chairs.\n\nWe really liked the Lemur Cafe. It has lots of windows. There is also a side room for kids to play. The floor is concrete, so it can be dangerous if toddlers fall. We will have lots of toddlers at our wedding, so that was a concern.  Also the place is only available at 6pm or after.  Since it's the cafe or restaurant for zoo patrons, they can convert the space right at 5pm, the closing time. There is also a cashier and soda fountain bar, so that would need to be covered. The catering staff at the zoo said they can easily put up some sort of divider to cover that up.  We liked the space, but it was a bit over our budget.\n\nThe strange thing is the catering staff never got back to us. We had a couple of questions which we emailed, but we didn't hear back.  We weren't completely set on having our reception there, but I thought it was rude and odd that she didn't get back to us.

The park has a great lay out and the walk was nice. the baby Gorilla was very entertaining to watch. Dad kept a eye on him the whole time we were observing. baby gorillas are much like toddler children, they run and taught adults much the same. We spent lots of time at this location. They had extra barricades due to the young age of the baby. Still is was not crowded. \n\nMy daughter bought every coin souvenir she found, another highlight, as she collects the 51 cent items everywhere. The feeding of the lions was very crowded, people are very rude, they see the animal, and forget that they are walking and stopping right in front of you, pushing to make room, while people were already there is very wrong. The big cats are great to watch, would not want to be the one having to feed them. If it were for the socially unaware idiots, it would have been better. \n\nNot much else to speak on, the train ride was a joke, two small little laps around a small section of land, which you can see not animals. A few farm animals to pet and feed. \n\nMy daughter spent the most amount of time with the bunnys and piggies. She wanted to take one home, she thought it would make good company for the one we own. Watching the little animals run around and eat, shove one out of a tube just for it to walk away. Pure, simple enjoyment. \n\nI am not planning on coming back again.

The place is a gem in a crowded, dense city, amazing they pulled it off. Huge compared to New York City's Central Park minizoo. I was expecting something dinky and was surprised by how nice some of the enclosures were. And there's a Siberian tiger!! That is amazing. I immediately bought a membership and plan to visit often. The setting is park-like, very green, beautifully landscaped. I thought the enclosures were quite large. The polar bear looked white to me. Plenty of tigers and the lion was there. Except for the Rainforest exhibit, it appears most of the renovations are done. A great petting zoo too, the place was very kid-friendly.\n\nWhat's with all the negative reviews? Exhibits were closed for renovations, that doesn't make it a *bad* zoo, that's just what's necessary to make it a *better* zoo. I'm sorry, are zoos supposed to magically update without any construction? I do agree the zoo should post what exhibits are closed at the door.\n\nParking is free on Sloat. When I went last Saturday, plenty of parking on Sloat. Walk, people, burn that fat off.\n\nI am flummoxed that people find $15 adult/$9 kid too expensive. Don't they realize how much it costs to take care of endangered large animals in a hugely expensive city? Or would you rather go out of town, spend money out of town, and pay $37 adult/$27 kids to get into the San Diego Zoo, which can then afford to pay the $1million necessary to rent pandas from China? Might as well fly to Minnesota to shop at the Mall of America and give money to Bloomie's.\n\nRating a zoo low because you don't like the idea of zoos? Well, most of the animals in zoos are there because they are injured and cannot survive in the wild. So should we release them in the wild and let them die? Or should we open a nice wide preserve for them? Okay, whose going to pay for that if you're already complaining about entry fees?

I came here the other day and honestly I was actually sad for the animals. Most of them LOOKED healthy enough and I'm sure they're provided the plenty of food/water they require. HOWEVER it was depressing to see the animals confined behind bars/cages thousands of miles away from their natural habitat. I'm sure their lions/tigers can't survive in the wild now if they were granted freedom but the whole situation is overall a negative for me. I loved visiting the zoo when I was younger but that's before I had any concept that animals have feelings too and I'm sure most (if not all) are depressed being behind a wall/fence. \n\nFor example, when I got to the sea otters (I think they were sea otters) I looked around in their area for them but I didn't see them anywhere. My bf then pointed out \"There he is\" and I see it on its two feet standing looking out through the crack of the door that the employees go in and out of. It was heartbreaking to see that it wanted to break out but couldn't. Also the polar bears looked a lot smaller than the huge plump ones that you see in the pictures and they were panting and looked to be suffering. As gloomy/cold as the city can be, the weather here certainly doesn't compare to the arctics where they originate and were right next to the black bears which I'm sure were fine in this weather. \n\nAnimal exhibits exists whether or not people want it to so I'm not gonna rate the place due to my own personal opinions about zoos.\nI did have a good laugh at the monkeys though. One female came around offering itself over to an uninterested male. It literally came lifted its tail and put its red monkey behind in front of the face of the male for a few seconds. The male just kinda glanced at it and looked away. The female must have felt rejected and ran off.

This would be one of our official date locations that we hit up since both of us haven't been to the zoo in a very long time. \n\nWe took the Muni to the zoo, and after we got arrived Jonathan kinda tripped on the sidewalk as we were walking in the wrong direction :P that was a good start to the day haha! ;) It kinda sucked that the weather wasn't all that... great. The classy grey skies making the city by the bay a gloomy place was the forecast for the day. Oh well, as long it doesn't rain on us right? \n\nJonathan bought our tickets and off we went to our adventure! I don't really remember much about the zoo other than the primate structure but it was nice to see the animals here. I felt a little bad since some of them like the rhino seemed really lonely, and I imagined them like the movie Madagascar, they could all be a little cooky. Maybe even the penguins were plotting some sort of escape plan. \n\nMy favorite exhibits were the tiger cubs and the kangaroos. We took pictures... actually Jonathan took great pictures of the tiger cubs playing and they were adorable!!! There is one picture he took where the two of them were pretty much nuzzled up against each other with their backs facing us. I thought it was a precious moment... and then they were wrestling with each other. Super cute. ^_^ That kangaroo exhibit was pretty cool, it was also pretty cute to see the joey's hanging out of their mom's pouches although one had its head sticking out while its legs were hanging out too. :) Cute stuff.\n\nI can't forget the amazing time I had with Jonathan here. Oh... I should put this out there that he wanted me to take a picture of the kangaroo ears that was around the zoo along with the rest of the animal ears/antlers that were hung up around the zoo. That's his fav pic though. Why? i don't know... it's just cute :P\n\nSucks that the tigers aren't there (i blame the assholes that had it coming to them).

Fortunately, there is a whole area of the zoo for little one's called the Children's Zoo.  It was wonderful to be able to expose her to farm animals (she pet a goat, saw the pigs and horses that are in her bedtime story books,  saw chicks, and a mouse), she enjoyed the insect house, and birds... This was a great start to get her comfortable with seeing animals up close and smaller in stature so not as intimidating before heading back to the bigger animal enclosures (ie. bears, chimpanzees)\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed chatting with the student volunteers (and their knowledge on the different animal areas they were watching over) as well.

On any given visit, you will find yourself first eagerly, then impatiently, stumbling down paths to nowhere, only to find ... nothing. Empty cages. Explanatory placards with no live subjects. \n\nThe only evidence of wildlife is on the street signs, which have animal-themed names.\n\nIt used to upset me. We deserve real bears, not just the leather variety. Then, an animal-shaped lightbulb popped on: just STOP THINKING OF THE SF ZOO AS A ZOO. It's not a zoo -- it's a park! With animal-themed signage. A naked savannah. And mylar balloons.\n\nAs for substitute attractions, you might enjoy the Little Puffer - it's a teeny tiny train that put-puts around in a shaky circle, affording you birds-eye views of ... nothing.

On the one hand, I love the spot, right next to the breakers right at the southern point of Ocean Beach, nestled in an evergreen forest that somewhat shelters it from the wind.  This is a beautiful evocative location for a zoo.\nUnfortunately, I am not so sure the location is the best one for the animals.  The cold foggy weather virtually year round doesn't seem to offer many of the African species that are used to warmer climates in Africa the kind of weather they need.  Some of the older sections made of asphalt are quaint but really got to go.   They are a relic from another period in time.\n\nThat said, some of the newer sections of the zoo such as the walk through aviaries are really brilliantly done.  They seem to be following the model of the San Diego Zoo, which is to try to let the animals live as normally as possible within the conditions allowed.  My favorite section of the zoo is probably the section around the train where the bears and bigger animals are (and where that kid got killed a few years back).  I really like watching those big animals when they play in the water.  \n\nFor the kids, the train ride is always a good treat and great pick-me up if their interest is starting to flag.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-16", "description": "Giving the zoo one star just because it's a zoo isn't fair, they should be judged at how good of a zoo they are. So how do they stack up? Right now they are good but not great. \n\nA fundamental problem with the zoo is that it's older and the layout of the exhibits doesn't really work that well anymore. They have made great strides in developing large, open multi-animal exhibits such as the african savanna section but other sections (such as the polar bears and pachyderms) are poorly developed. Fortunately those in charge recognize this and are moving the zoo toward redeveloping those exhibits. But here in lies the zoos catch 22. \n\nThey are constrained by space and money. They can't do much to increase the space they have which makes it even more important to efficiently use the space they have already (do they really need a huge exhibit for the cassowary, which while an interesting bird to look at isn't exactly an animal a lot of people care much about, or are paying to see). However, this costs money and as we all know the SF zoo isn't exactly awash in cash and charging only $15 for adults ($12 for SF residents) compared to $37 for the SD zoo and it gets harder for them to fill their coffers for the needed renovations. \n\nWith that said, they do a lot of things well. The trainers really love their animals and all are given the best care possible. The lemur forest and  gorillas are fun to watch, especially the new baby Hasani. The children section is well done and after some time off the snow leopards are back on display. Even the food isn't outrageously priced, it's about $10 for a burger and fries which seems to be about par for any type of museum, aquarium or zoo and they offer very fresh vegetables for toppings. \n\nSF Zoo also takes in animals that might otherwise be killed. For example, the two grizzly bear sisters are wild from Montana and were going to be killed for entering neighborhoods and taking food. The zoo learned about it and was able to take the animals in and put them into a pretty nice enclosure. However, this doesn't always work so well. For example the seal which is old and maybe blind probably would have been killed years ago in the wild and I can't help but wonder if the poor thing wouldn't be better off.\n\nThe zoo also offers learning programs for children, bike about tours of the zoo, a teenage volunteer program to help young adults learn about  animals as well as volunteer options for adults. \n\nPossible improvements to make it better: Renovate the older exhibits and make more efficient use of the land available. It wold also be nice if they offered some sort of regular behind the scenes tours or help with the feedings of the tamer animals which the public could be a part of, similar to the Monterey bay aquarium behind the scene tours, which would also be a way to raise money.", "author": "Russ C."}

People do tend to let their kids scream a little too much near some of the sensitive animals - and that made me cringe. But if that is the worst of the events today. I am very pleased.\n\nTips to save:\nShow SF residency and get $3 off your ticket\nSave the $8 to park in their lot and park on Sloat near 47th.\nBring your lunch and picnic over by the primate area or penguins.", "author": "Jessica L."}

What a deal.\n\nThe zoo is currently being remodeled, so many exhibits are closed.  \nDue to the Dhaliwal brothers incident, there are currently no tigers.    The animals look sleepy and unhappy.  I could not even see the Asian Indian Rhino, because the pachyderm building was shut down.  The last elephant packed her trunk and moved to the foothills of the Sierra  in 2005 and the last hippo died in 2008.  What is a zoo without elephants, hippos, and tigers.  The current habitat displays are much more natural than the depressing concrete structures from the '50s.\n\nMust be a sign of the times, but after a little girl broke a glass bottle at the Leaping Lemur Cafe, the mother rounded up the kids and left the dangerous mess behind without telling anybody.

That was a highlight! \nThe Nature Walk (in the Children's Zoo) was something even my older kids (11 and 12) loved. Each animal they met was accompanied & introduced by a (human) volunteer handler (age 12-15) who was really well-educated about each animal and was friendly, helpful and a great resource. We loved meeting the snakes, turtles and chinchillas. \nAny time we get to see the animals being fed and getting to ask questions of the handlers it's awesome.

(Man, did I love my Zoo Key!)  As an adult I very rarely came to this zoo, until my new hubby, who'd never been, wanted to bring our 4 year old.\n\nThe SF Zoo has really made the effort to move into a new era of zoos. Some zoos that I have been to in other places, put the animals into very large enclosures and this is a great improvement over the traditional zoo, of which SF was one, that had small concrete enclosures.  So apparently in the past few years, SF has tried to update, creating, for example, a nice open giraffe (with other animals) area in the front of the zoo with a great giraffe barn.  This was actually the highlight of our first visit, watching the giraffes eat in their barn at around 4pm. \n\nSo, overall, I can totally understand the objections that many reviewers have stated about zoos in general, however, the SF Zoo has tried to update and does a pretty good job. In addition to the giraffe barn, we enjoyed the small monkeys, and insect hall.  Food fairly good, prices reasonable, kids get to appreciate and develop an interest in animals they never otherwise would have seen.", "author": "Hilary S."}

So obviously we don't hate it.   But there are things I've noticed over time that I think the zoo really needs to work on.  \n\nFirst of all, as several other reviewers have noted, there is one polar bear who does nothing but pace back and forth all day in an agitated state.  This has been the case every time I've visited.  I've read that they got one of their bears from a Canadian town where the bear had been menacing residents, and that this bear was considered too aggressive to be with the other polar bears.  I think this is the same bear.  They have this bear caged very close to the pool where they have their new sea lion exhibit -- not sure that was the kindest planning, given that this bear is already in an agitated state and that polar bears have a very keen sense of smell.  Also not sure if it's kind to the sea lion, since it is a blind sea lion who might have an enhanced sense of smell himself.  Anyway, I wonder if they are feeding the bear enough, or if a bear who has \"issues\" with humans is a good candidate for a zoo exhibit.\n\nThere is also a small tiger who paces aggressively in a similar way.  Some of you may remember the reports from a couple years back, that the tiger who escaped and killed a zoo visitor had lost 50 lbs since arriving at SF Zoo.  I hope they are feeding their animals the right amount to keep them healthy and at least somewhat content.  \n\nThe grizzlies seem happy.  And the zoo does have a good policy -- which may be economically motivated -- of taking in animals that have been injured or maimed and cannot survive in the wild.  A lot of one-winged birds around.  That may add to the \"depressing\" vibe that others allude to, but at least the animals on display shouldn't be pitied too much for being in a zoo.  Also, the volunteers and docents are great.  \n\nThere's one woman who works in the membership office who's always super-cranky and unfriendly.  It feels strange to be willingly giving her money.  \n\nMy child's favorite exhibit is the Bug House.  I don't totally get the appeal, but she's happy there and it's warm and dry on cold days.

So free and cute!!  Wish they had more info about them or had people talk to us about how they were fed, cared for, etc.  The petting farm was very nice too.  It helps to bring a kid along and see him taste their pellets and immediately have a disgusted expression.  PRICELESS!  The goats were pushy but rightfully so...they want and need their food dammit....\n\nThe other side of the zoo was \"okay\".  The animals were bored, sleepy (like I was), sleeping, eating, or not there.  Some of the animals were rescued.  It's nice to know that part, otherwise I would have thought some animal abuse was going on.  Well, even more so that being locked up against their will.

If you honestly think that the keepers don't care about the animals they are caring for you couldn't be more wrong. Ask any of the keepers about the animals they care for and they will tell you individually about each animal and their personalities. I honestly can't believe people think that someone also killed Kabibe on purpose?! They helped care for her before she was even born, don't you think they got attached to her like a family member too after seeing her grow into the beautiful goofy girl she was? Yes, there have been some accidents at this Zoo but when you're dealing with exotic animals you can't really predict everything can you? They do so much for the animals in their care and they love them!! And to all the people claiming that the animals look sad or aren't very active, animals have good days and bad days just like people, what you're expecting is unrealistic. If they aren't moving maybe the weathers got them down or maybe they're tired not everything means \"look i'm so unhappy and sad\" THEY'RE ANIMALS! You can't control what they do and how they feel.

Notable areas to check out are the lion house, tiger, kangaroos, eagle and owl exhibits, penguin feeding, grizzly bears getting frustrated with eating their frozen blocks of food, prairie dogs, and the insect zoo. I had time to walk around and take pictures of most of the animals in 90 minutes or so. I was too late to check out the gorilla, but I imagine it would have been cool, too. There are a lot of benches, so if you get tired, you can also rest with some popcorn or Dippin' Dots (quite a gyp, by the way). As you exit, there is even a recycle bin for your map.\n\nMy favorite part was the insect zoo in a separate building. The roaches were so gross. Oh god, domestic roaches and I have a bit of a history, so it was weird and satisfying to see the appallingly huge, meaty roaches all crowded in a glass box. I'd like to see them scattering out from a far distance. This mini-zoo even had non-insects such as spiders and millipedes. The container labeled \"black widow\" didn't seem to have anything inside, but I didn't get bitten or anything so\n\nFor $15 ($9 for S.F. residents and people 8?-14), $3 more than the L.A.

I am sure the Buffalo Zoo is much worse than the SF Zoo.   It is a great reminder that there are always places with worse conditions, always someone else or someplace else who has it worse, always. This is true and I should keep it in perspective.  However, I am a native San Francisco girl (fourth generation) and for a city that strongly and loudly espouses \"lead by example\" and  \"higher standards as a standard\" for a variety of reasons - among them devotion to the welfare of animals - I have to judge this zoo with a harsher eye.  A city that has proposals to ban all pet sales within the city due to the \"conditions\" the animals must endure I think should be held to a higher standard with their own zoo.  A city full of diners that are wildly concerned with the living conditions of their food prior to slaughter....well, I'm holding that city to a higher standard on their zoo.  Look, I love the city - the good, the bad and the in between.  I am sure there are worse zoos in the U.S. and I've seen far worse outside of the U.S. (which would be an apples/oranges comparison), but I do feel this zoo deserves a 1 at best because of where it is located and the minimal expectations of a partially subsidized institute dedicated to the care and welfare of animals.

Some people complain about the animals not being out on \"display\" but they are wild animals and cannot be forced to be out entertaining the zoo visitors.  You have to go there not expecting to see every animal.  We are zoo members, so we aren't that disappointed if the animals are hiding or just sleeping.  We are able to go as often as we want.\n\nI suggest getting there early and parking out on Sloat - where the parking is free.

The oceanside location gave us cool breezes and fresh air - it was my first visit to a zoo where I wasn't sweaty and cranky before we even got our tickets. We arrived at around 11am on a Saturday and there was plenty of parking In the smallish lot and no line for tickets (I'm used to the LA zoo where this is not the case!)

The little petting zoo was perfect for little ones and we also enjoyed the giraffes and zebras. The zoo is large but walking it was a pleasure! Even the cafe (we went to he one near the carousel) was better than expected. I had a rice bowl with bone-in teriyaki chicken (yum crispy chicken skin!) and steamed veggies - a tasty kid friendly and healthy meal. All staff was friendly. Little surprises like animal sculptures, gardens and a kid friendly band playing on the lawn made the day fun. I loved all the open spaces to picnic or just play under a tree. Oh, and the playground was amazing! Probably even more fun for slightly older kids because it was quite exciting. If you plan to hit the playground with younger kids be sure to bring some sand toys as the sandy area is really nice. And there were plenty of shaded benches for parents to sit on. Also, at no point, even on a lovely Saturday in September, did it feel crowded. We were there for three hours and definitely didn't see everything - I hope we can go back soon!

It was a chilly, foggy day, so we started our visit with a visit to the little cafe in the gift shop at the entrance-surprisingly delicious!  We were there in the afternoon, and all of the animals were out!  They have a great variety of animals, all of which looked healthy and happy.  We noticed the zoo seems to take in a lot of animals that would otherwise not have survived in the wild.  For example, the 2 sea lions who call the zoo home are blind and there is also a one-winged eagle.  Kudos to the zoo for taking these animals, who likely require additional medical care, attention, and funding.  One of the highlights of our visit was the lion room, where we got a front row seat to a lion and tiger feeding.  It was a nice way to end our afternoon!", "author": "Keely D."}

My daughter loved the petting zoo!!! The food was so so. But the gift shop prices were outrageous! I bought a small stuffed animal and a childrens tshirt and spent over $45!

It was clean and well laid out with lots to see.  The animals were plentiful and up close.  I really liked the lions and gorillas.  The Silverback reminded me of a guy I once dated, but I think this gorilla would have called me back after he got to second base.  \n\nGorillas, I'm sure, have manners.\n\nI enjoyed riding the steam train and the carousel although I am sure that I got some little child's spit up on my boots and caught Rubella or Small Pox or some other dirty child disease.\n\nAnd yes, I get paid for this.  \n\nBesides the communicable disease it's not such a bad gig.\n\nThere isn't much in the way of food that isn't nuggets and cotton candy.

Many people don't understand that animals are bred in captivity and is their only means of survival. Animals are not taken from their environment unless they are injured or unfit to survive in the wild. Sadly, some species don't even exist in the wild, and it's the only place people, especially children get to learn about and care about these animals and be outside with their families.

Personally if I'm ever in need of some quality Lauren time, to get in my \"Zen\" spot....I might go have a day where I go see a movie by myself, or people watch in the park, talking shit with a friend.  \nWell, I have a friend.  My friend has a thing for goats.  An admiration if you will..maybe an obsession?  So on this lazy Sunday, we made a spur of the moment decision to go to the SF Zoo and play with goats, so he could get into his \"Zen\" spot.  Goats make him happy, so that was the plan, cuz if my friend is happy...so am I.\n\nI'm going to give the Children's zoo here 5 stars.  They have a great area where you can just cruise around with the goats.  Become one if you choose...You can pet them, feed them, and even brush their lovely lil coats.

He found his Zen, and we left the petting zoo in good spirits with smiles and stories.  Like the one story involving the one kid who gave the goat a lil nibble on his ear...or shall I say the goat took it without asking...and don't worry.  No damage was done.  Just a kid who will probably NEVER go to the petting zoo again.\n\nAs far as the rest of the zoo goes....I was a bit disappointed, but I think a lot of that had to do with the hour we were there, and the fact that I've been spoiled by the San Diego Zoo...We went 2 hours before closing, and all the good aminals were sleeping, hiding or who knows where.  Half of the habitats were empty with no sign, and most were just difficult to see.. No cuddly koalas, no efelants, the giraffes were staying in a cabin, and the chimps and apes were apparently monkeying around somewhere private.

I thought the grounds were well laid out and landscaped. The zoo is very big, especially for little ones to take all in. The new children's playground was very thoughtful and age-appropriate. Truly buckets of fun. Little Puffer train was a bit pricey at $5pp and super quick and done but that's ok. We did not use the cafe given that we brought our own picnic lunches and were free to eat wherever we chose. I thought it was amazing to see endangered animals. Sure some of the exhibits seem to be empty and the animals were sleeping. But geez - we are trying to visit animals in their un-natural habitat, trying to do their natural thing. They're not supposed to do acrobatic tricks because there are visitors lined up at their fences. I thought it was amazing to see gorillas, hippo, rhinos, polar bear, grizzly bear, peacocks (loose), anteater, ostriches, snow leopards, koala, sloth, scarlet ibis. These are animals I haven't ever seen before (except gorillas a long time ago). So I thought it was pretty cool. As for the stretches of empty land, animals need lots of open space to roam. It's ok that they are camouflaged and resting where they feel most comfortable, especially confined and in captivity. I will definitely come back with my kids real soon.

This zoo is a great place for a family outing and a wonderful way for Bay Area residents to teach our children about appreciating and respecting a diverse range of animals and their ever-threatened environments. \n\nIt's so easy to get caught up in our own, small world. The zoo offers us the opportunity to remind us that we share this planet with some other extraordinary creatures. With all the glitzy materialism, fast paced media, and art and culinary culture, it's nice to decompress and think about the state of our planet and the wonder that it holds. \n\nMy biggest complaint about the SF zoo is the trashy people who go to it and think it's cool to taunt the majestic big cats by running up and down along the cages or yelling at them. I wish the zoo had better security and free reign to use tranquilizer darts and big ol' ID tags that they could permanently staple to people's ears that say \"I'm an A**hole who torments caged animals\".", "author": "Pamela B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-09-12", "description": "I grew up in love with the zoo -- it always was mysterious -- the cages were ugly, but you could really see all the animals without them hiding behind all the shrubs.  It was fun for us, but not for them.  \n\nAnd it was free -- ah what joy to race down that hill to the entrance, make a run for those big round swings that always felt like they'd take off from their moorings and fling us into outer space.  The carousel.  The old Children's Zoo and Children's Fairytale Land... my memories of these are so vivid.  We used to have a blue Zoo Key, and it could be inserted into the talking storybooks that would then narrate a tidbit of info about the animals being viewed.  We'd invariably forget the zoo key at home, but there was one Talking Storybook that didn't require a key, and if you pushed the big red button, it would play this song:  \n\nAll the animals in the zoo\nAre jumping up and down for you,\nHoping you will have fun today\nAnd purchase your zoo key right away!\n\nOver time the zoo changed, sometimes incrementally, sometimes dramatically.  Now, it doesn't even feel like the same place.  The old main entrance is no longer.  The swings are gone.  Natural animal habitats have replaced most of the cages.  And they charge -- a lot!  (Why I gave it only 4 stars).  Somehow when it was free, you could go for shorter visits and didn't feel compelled to see EVERY animal.\n\nIn some ways (like the restrooms and habitats), the changes are good.  But in other ways, the zoo has lost some of the mysteriousness, some of the intrigue.  I no longer imagine a lion escaping its cage and running amok amongst the zoo-goers.  But I can still buy the best, stale rectangle of Pink Popcorn!  \n\nZOO-GOING TIPS:  \n\n-- If you can, grab a kid (one you know, not a stranger!) -- it makes your visit infinitely more fun!  \n\n-- Despite the weather when you set out, bundle up and dress in layers -- due to ocean's proximity, it is guaranteed to be freezing once you set foot in the zoo grounds, and dang, your car is so far away!\n\n-- Bring snacks or picnic goodies for the kids -- they do have snack bars, but they're pricey.  If you must, buy the pink popcorn and cotton candy, but then enjoy your own sammies and drinks. \n\n-- If it's your first visit, spend a moment looking at the map and charting your course, so you don't get worn out before you've seen the animals that are your priorities.  The distances are vast and kids get exhausted long before the day is over. (Unfortunately, they no longer offer the Zebra Train tours of the zoo -- I used to recommend these as a nice way to get the lay of the land.  Maybe with enough requests, they'll consider bringing it back?)   \n\n-- Don't feed the animals (except the baby goats in the Children's Zoo).  But if you like to see the fat cats getting fed, be at the Lion House at 2 p.m., every day except Monday.  The roaring is tremendous!  \n\n-- Be sure to ride the Carousel -- it is really the best!  \n\n-- Consider joining -- with the admission prices so high, it pays for itself in two or so visits, plus is a great way to throw your weight behind something so deserving.  Plus, you get invites to special events, like Zoo Night (don't miss it!).  \n\n-- If you don't want to use all your energy hiking to and from the free parking on Sloat Blvd., pay the $6 for the lot parking.  (Regardless of where you park, be sure you take your valuables -- leave nothing in your car, and be sure it is locked and secure -- this place is a target for car burglaries because they know you'll be gone and the coast is clear for a few hours.)  \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nHere are the prices (from the Zoo's website -- visit it for updates):  \n\nNON-RESIDENTS OF SAN FRANCISCO\nAdults 18-64 $11.00 \nYouths 12-17 $8.00 \nSeniors 65 and over $8.00 \nChildren 3-11 $5.00 \nChildren 2 and under Free \n\n\nSF RESIDENTS' DISCOUNT RATES (must show valid proof of residency)\nAdults 18-64 $9.00 \nYouths 12-17 $4.50 \nSeniors 65 and over $4.50 \nChildren 3-11 $2.50 \nChildren 2 and under Free \n\n\nMEMBERSHIP\nSan Francisco Zoological Society Members receive free admission with annual Membership.\n\nFamily Membership: $75.00 (admits 2 named adults and their children or grandchildren under 18 years, with lots of free passes/ride tickets)\n\nIndividual: $60.00 (admits 1 named adult, comes with some passes)\n\nStudent/Senior:  $45.00 (admits up to 2 named seniors or 1 student)\n\nOther memberships range from $85 to $500 (see website for details)\n\nFREE DAYS\nFirst Wednesday of every month, admission to the Zoo is free!

Annex the property as part of San Francisco County and call it the San Francisco Wild Animal Park (at Livermore, or some bullshit to make everyone feel nice).  Then extend BART through Livermore (which is already planned) and out to the new park, near Altamont Pass, or perhaps even in up Mines Road, past Del Valle.\n\nThen, the animals could be transfered away from the cold, foggy coast of San Francisco, which is NOTHING LIKE their natural habitat, and placed in a much larger, more comfortable environment.  Then redevolop the old zoo grounds into a giant skatepark and amusement park for the youth of San Francisco.\n\nThe zoo has an abysmal location for these animals.  It is too cold.  I can close my eyes and see it again as I did when I was six, and it was glorious and huge to me then.  But now, ugh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-03", "description": "Before today, the last time that I was at the SF Zoo was about eight years ago.  Funny how one never has the time...kinda like those native New Yorkers who have never been to the Statue of Liberty.  As I read some of the other reviews on Yelp, I had to wonder if these people had ever been here a decade or two or even three ago.  I have pictures of me as a baby here being carried around in a basket.  \n\nPlenty of fond memories of running around with red and blue zoo keys and Pink Popcorn bars (back when they were still sweet and delicious, not anymore).  Walking around on an absolutely gorgeous, picture perfect day today (yes, I know it's often foggy here), looking at the animals, I was really impressed with how far this zoo has come.\n\nThe new Africa area had a really nice layout with paths winding around the giraffes, gazelles, gorillas, and etc.  Next to the animal areas, I discovered a lot of recently created new paths and discovery areas throughout the entire zoo.  The two sister grizzlys (grizzlies?) were fantastic and were thoroughly enjoying their new environment, happily coming from the far end, right up to glass of the pool to the delight of people and toddlers alike.\n\nThe prairie dogs were really cute and a total hit, as were the meer kats in their new environment.  There are a variety of tall cones in the meer kat area and one of the meer kats kept standing on one, loving the attention and looking like a hood ornament.  Also loved the penguins looking like the movie Surf's Up!  \n\nThe Children's Zoo and petting area was fun and with all the goats walking around and in the stable, I joked with my friend that it had noticed the pentagram she was wearing.  Thought of the pagan rituals in the comedy movie Dragnet. :)  \n\nThe insect room was interesting as well and one of the zoo workers who we had met in the wild bird area was now in the room enthusiastically telling everyone about the wolf spider with 200 babies on it's back.  It's hard to be a mother!  It was fun to watch all the kids running around and screaming excitedly upon discovery of a scorpion, tarantula, or black widow spider.\n\nThe lion house and pachyderm house were closed, but it looked like they were in the process of renovating.  The only real disappointment was that the tropical bird house which we were looking forward to was closed due to construction.  I was also hoping to see those two huge old trains in the main area that used to be there to climb on when I was growing up, but sadly, they were gone.  As a plus though, all of the grounds are far more lush and have been nicely landscaped with a lot more plant life everywhere. \n\nGranted, from a food standpoint, the food is far from gourmet, but it has really come a long way from what it used to be.  As a child growing up, the food here was barely edible and you had a choice of a low grade hamburger, cheeseburger, or hot dog sitting under a heat lamp.\n  \nAlthough I didn't eat at any of them today, I noticed that there is an asian food cafe, a Mexican food cafe (Terrace Cafe), and a variety of foods like fish and chips, onion rings, and garlic fries at the others.  In addition, there are plenty of new bathrooms and also a lot of new snack bar type Gilligan Island type stands scattered throughout the park selling bottled water, soda, caramel popcorn, cotton candy, fruit juices.\n\nAnother thing I noticed was the enthusiasm of all the workers I came in contact with there.  Even the guy running the little train around the park was just as happy and enthused as his passengers who were waving at everybody as they went by.\n\nBeing an animal lover, I ordinarily don't like to see animals chained up or in cages, but the modern layouts and environments are far more humane than they have ever been.  Despite it's shortcomings, the zoo gives people, both young and old, an opportunity to see animals up close that they otherwise might not have a chance to see and as such makes them more environmentally conscious and that's a good thing.\n  \nAnother Yelper suggested closing this zoo and making it into a wildlife sanctuary closed to the public.  Noble as that sounds, if that ever happens, it would be a sad day indeed.  How can you expect tomorrow's youth to care about animals and the environment when the only time they're ever even seen one is on the internet or the Discovery Channel?  The zoo serves a very real purpose and does wonders for awareness. \n\nAs a native San Franciscan that was born here, I can honestly say that this place has come a long way.  Hoping they continue to improve so that many more people can enjoy this for generations to come.\n\nOn top of it all, the first Wed of each month is free to SF residents.  Free!  Ya gotta love free.  Parking was $8.00, but there's no need to use it as there's tons of free parking in the area as long as you don't park in their lot.\n\nAfterwards, it was a short walk to the beach.  Can't ask for much more than that.", "author": "Roy N."}

Today, we decided to try the SF Zoo and we were disappointed. Many exhibits and even roads were closed. It was sunny and warm but not many people were around at all. They didn't even have an elephant or camels, etc. Some of the cafes were closed too. Most animals were asleep. The sea lions were fun, and the grizzly bears and gorillas were alert. Most of the bathrooms were pretty dirty. Out of a line of a dozens stalls we could find one or two that were usable. There were not enough road signs in the zoo to tell us where we were so we kept getting lost. Better signage would have been better. The playground was big, but not worth spending 17 bucks to play on when I could just go to a public park. The only ride was a carousel compared to Oakland which has a whole ride park next to its zoo. The goats in SF were mean and aggressive and almost hit my toddler in the face with its horns while trying to wrestle food out of her hand. I had to pry the goat away!", "author": "J B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-17", "description": "In the world of Zoos, the SF Zoo is showing its age -- 10 years ago they were getting rid of the old style exhibits (lots of concrete and bars) in favor of more modern, natural ones.  They're still updating them, and the buildings that look like they date back to the world's fair badly need renovation.\n\nThe new exhibits (such as the giraffes in the savana area, or the monkey and ape areas) are quite nice, and clearly modernized.  The animals look better in their natural environments, and the whole experience is better knowing the animals are treated well.  It's clear the zoo has tried to enhance the big cat and bear exhibits by reducing the number of animals so the ones there can wander from area to area; still, too much concrete in there really hurts the feel of the area.\n\nEnjoyed the nice collection of birds scattered throughout, and the ever-present peacocks are always entertaining.  Friendly staff van be found throughout the park.\n\nI had a wonderful afternoon walking through the zoo; it looked like quite a few of the exhibits were closed/coming soon, but it was still enjoyable.

Last week at the SF Zoo the lions were having sex like mad and the adults in the crowd were going crazy and laughing like hyenas. I have never been so amused in my life. Now we've all seen animals doing it on the Discovery Channel, but there is nothing as awkward as seeing it in real life. I really felt like we should give them some privacy, but I think the male lion liked that we were watching, and the lionness was like \"not this again!\" \n\nAnyways, I had a great time. I got to see the penguins get fed, and the giraffes were so pretty. There were peacocks everywhere and the flamingos are awesome.

And not a nice beach, an always freezing COLD beach?  In a part of town that is always covered by overcast.\n\nThese poor animals.  It must have taken them AGES to acclimate to the weather.

Have you ever seen a giraffe canter?  I'd never seen it until this past trip, and it's an amusing sight.  What was going through his head must have been something like this: \"Now what did I need over here?  Darn, I forgot again.  Shoot.  Well, if I run back to where I was, I'll remember. Oh yes, it was those tender green leaves, ... or was it?  Oh, I forgot again.\"  At any rate, that giraffe was quite gawky and awkward, but he was having such fun that we were, too, just watching him.  \n\nWe also saw the penguins, were stalked by a peacock (who didn't have his tail feathers -- what's up with that?  do tourists attack peacocks and pull out their tail feathers or do they just grow them during mating season only), watched the indolent big cats laze in the sun (actually, the fog), looked at the bears play with their pumpkins, and interacted with the really fat prairie dogs and the really skinny meer cats (that struck me as really funny that one is called a \"dog\" and the other a \"cat\").  \n\nPerhaps our very favorite was near the end, the Insect Zoo!  My kids love bugs, but I have to say that it's pretty gross to watch those cockroaches, hissing beetles, the tarantulas (who knew that there are ones w/ red knees and ones w/ white knees), ants, and even water beetles.\n\nMy least favorite part?

What people don't know is that our SF ZOO is a non-profit organization. We don't get alot of funding from the city. 90% of the money is from donations, admission tickets and from Zoo members. \n\nI use to work at the membership Dept. and its hard. Yea, I would like to see the Zoo upgraded, but with what money? I've seen people write $10,000 checks and even little kids donate $5. So for the people to complain about the Zoo looking like crap and not comparing to the San Diego Zoo, don't judge what the Zoo looks like, but see how hard people work to protect/ save the animals each and every day.\n\nEveryday I would stroll around the zoo during lunch and enjoy watching the animals lounge around and chilling. Saddens me sometimes when I see how small the enclosure is, but you can't release them back in the wild, they won't survive.

The beautiful location and ample room afforded me a unique experience: I had something on my mind that I just couldn't communicate.  I just could not figure out how to express myself... which for a jabber-jaw like me is an unusual condition to find myself in.\n\nI often times see myself living out scenes from movies, substituting myself for certain characters as they experience situations that are similar to mine.  At the zoo I felt like the \"other car\" in Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  Perhaps it was the holiday that made me think of it...  Can you imagine how the couple in the car felt as they tried to convince a fatigued John Candy that he was traveling in the wrong direction on the highway?  They could clearly see that John was doing something wrong, behaving in a way that could bring him to harm, yet these poor motorists couldn't convince him.  Candy's character dismissed these people as drunks, ignoring the signals they were trying to send.  What happened to those people after their scene ended?  Did they lose sleep, wondering why John Candy wouldn't listen to them?  Were they offended that he was dismissive of their efforts?  Did they feel dejected or blame themselves for not being able to get their message across?\n\nI love animals because they are different than we are- they never worry about other animals' feelings.  In every other capacity the animal kingdom shares traits with man, excepting this: there is no empathy outside of humanity.  Is this a blessing or a curse?  Perhaps only \"Screaming Driver,\" and \"Screaming Driver's Wife,\" (played by John Moio and Veronica Vanderkloot) will ever know...", "author": "Drew P."}

I really enjoyed the petting zoo section in the children's area. Watching kids and animals interact is really fun.  \n\nDefinitely give this zoo a chance.

That, and the fact that if you say bananas over and over again it ceases to make any sense. Bananas, bananas, bananas. See? Weird, right?\n\nThe zoo can be kind of overwhelming when on acid so we left with me mumbling, \"Man. I really need to see something normal.\" We thought that going to the beach would put us at ease and show us the simple beauty of the sea. That's pretty normal, right? Well I made the mistake of going to the public bathroom down there and opening a stall only to find a completely naked octogenarian standing there. \n\nHe could only muster a weak \"Uuunghh.\" \n\nI stood there for longer than I probably should have but I just could... not... look... away.

In the end we selected the Carousel, which was a HUGE hit. Having that 100-year-old carousel running for the entire two-hour event, so that everyone, from the 4-year-old to the 80-year-old, could ride as much as they liked, was fabulous. It brought the party together, added an element of fun and group play that made it as memorable as the wedding. Food was excellent; drinks professionally served and very reasonably priced. We looked at several different kinds of venues, and the prices and unique nature of this venue made it a clear winner. There is free parking after 5 p.m., another great feature in the city.

More families than you would ever want to be surrounded while at the zoo.  Do all these people with tons of kids not have jobs?  What are they doing out and about?\n\nAs a former student of zoology, I appreciate being able to see wildlife in person that I could only watch on TV or read about in books.  Of course, I don't like seeing animals held captive -- not even domesticated animals.  So if you have pets and get high and mighty about captive animals in the zoo, then I think it's just hypocrisy.  Do you really think your dog/cat/etc wants to live with you?  Seriously.  If they had a choice, wouldn't they rather be free?  \n\nOK, off soapbox A.  On to soapbox B.  \n\nMy ambivalence about captive animals aside, if you are going to have zoos, aquariums, pets, etc., then the conditions should be decent.  Sadly, I saw some terrible exhibition spaces that were not very nice for the animals, I imagine.  For example, hippos with barely any water to swim in and having only a small pool.  Hello, they're mostly aquatic.  Ditto for the polar bears.  \n\nLooks like they're doing lots of construction and things might get better, but I'll believe it when I see it.\n\nI give it 2 stars because people wouldn't care about saving elephants or other exotic wildlife if they never saw them.   Second, they do captive breeding programs for animals that are endangered and might go extinct otherwise.  That alone justifies zoos in my opinion.\n\nSoapbox C (last one, promise)-\n\nHere's the deal -- you don't want to see animals in captivity?  Stop buying so much crap that you don't need, which ultimately leads to habitat destruction and these animals becoming rare, threatened, or endangered.  We're all to blame.  Do more, buy less.  The less you buy, the less demand there is to destroy the environment.  Seriously, do you need a table from rain forest wood?  Don't drive so much/use too much electricity/etc... polar bears are drowning because of greenhouse gases.\n\nOh, and have fewer kids.

Why?\r\n\r\nSince the zoo is located right next to the coast, it's usually foggy and cold and grey out there, even if it's sunny and warm in the Mission District.\r\n\r\nWith the cold weather, you can't help but feel really bad for the animals. I think the giraffes and zebras are pissed. They probably wake up in the morning, look out their barn window and think, \"Another cold ass day? I did NOT sign up for this shit.\" Don't believe me? 9 times out of 10 on a grey day, you'll see all the lemurs huddled underneath their heat lamp.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the zoo are kinda odd. The facilities don't seem right. A little too 1950s \"let's put a koala behind glass like a store front window display.\" \r\n\r\nIf you're there, be sure to check out the depressing blind geriatric seal next to the lonely tapir. The tapir spends its day alone, sitting in his pool of water or on a pile of hay. The seal spends its day blindly swimming around and around and around in its tiny pool of water. (But it's not the zoo's fault, because the seal is so old and has cataracts in its eyes, moving the seal to a better facility would be too stressful for it.)\r\n\r\nFun things to do at the zoo? Watching seagulls steal hot dogs right from under patron's noses. Those seagulls are CRAZY. You can also chase the various peacocks that wander around the zoo (or let them chase you... it happened to me. Kinda disconcerting.) And you can (though you're not supposed to) feed the squirrels that hang around the Little Puffer train. And you can laugh at the outdated sign for the old elephant habitat that says \"PACHYDERMS.\"\r\n\r\nHmm, I guess wild animals behind cages doesn't really thrill me. Maybe I'm too old and the magic is gone? I'm sure plenty of little ones would still get a kick out of the SF Zoo. They don't know any better.

And what a perfect day it was! The weather was neither hot nor cold, the crowd was average, and the mood delightful! We paid a discounted price of $17 for the four of us since we're zoo members so SCORE!\n\nThey have a plethora of animals that Oakland zoo does not have such as the kangaroo, ostrich, koala bear, panda bear, grizzly bear, brown bear, polar bear, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, peacock, anaconda, different types of owls, hawks, gorilla, antelopes, lemurs, prairie dogs, etc. Of course they have the usual lions, tigers, elephants, zebras, giraffes, flamingos, monkeys, chimpanzees, meerkats. They have other animals that I just cannot recall at this time for the life of me.\n\nThe playground is okay in size, but the slide slides better than the itty bitty one that they have at Oakland. They a wider selection of eateries as well; more expensive, but better. They have snack huts at every turn where you can pig out on cotton candy, pretzels, churros, dippin' dots, popcorn, soda...hmmm...cavity central waiting to happen! They even have photographers at the entrance who will take your pics 'for fun\" but you are not obliged to buy.\n\nUnlike Oakland zoo, you do have to pay to ride the Carousel and train and the lines are longer. Not ideal for us since we have a 20-month and 7-month old lovebugs in tow.\n\nWhat I don't understand is how on earth that tiger jumped over the fence. AND why would anybody tease and taunt a caged animal that is known to be ferocious?! There are \"shh\" signs in certain areas like the gorilla section so please follow the rules, peoples!!! Respect the animals please!\n\nI also don't understand why people bitch about the prices at an attraction such as this one. This isn't a factory outlet or the flea market so don't expect things to be cheap here. Or don't come here at all. I suggest you just watch the Animal Planet from your own home. Stop complaining! Enjoy the park! On a side note, some of these animals have either been captured as a young then donated to the zoo because they are unable to survive in the wild or injured so that is why they are here.

My family always had season passes and I even attended Zoo School there when I was younger.  The SF Zoo can't begin to compare to the SD Zoo in terms of size, variety, beauty, or sheer awe of the exhibits.  But then, I didn't expect it to.  I actually like the SF Zoo just as much as SD, only in a different way.  SD (and other world-class zoos) can seem sterile, with the animals sequestered so far from visitors, across concrete moats and behind thick plexiglass.  At SF you can get face to face with almost all the animals.  The exhibits are intimate and there aren't nearly as many crowds.  There are even peacocks just wandering around free which blew my mind the first time I went.\n\nYou MUST go to the petting zoo located in the children's zoo area.  Seriously, it makes the day.  Unless you grew up on a farm, petting, brushing, and feeding the various animals there is a total trip.  Just watch out when you purchase your food pellets from the machine.  Once, when I was about to collect my food from the machine, I was pushed aside by this enormously fat goat on his hind legs who proceeded to eat all my pellets straight from the chute.  I didn't want to shove him out of the way and get kicked out of the zoo for animal abuse, so I just stood there and took it.  Boyfriend said I had a look on my face like I'd been raped.  Of course it wasn't quite that extreme, but I certainly felt violated.\n\nThe zoo closes at 5.

Both of us had been here years before. This visit was actually quite disappointing, especially for the price paid to get in and for parking. Thankfully I had packed snacks so we weren't forced to pay for overpriced food too. We planned our visit around wanting to see the \"big cat feeding\", which on their website stated 3:00pm. We made our way through the park before that, and agree with other reviews that the set up left much to be desired. You must double-back and/or pass the same area multiple times, and in most cases their are no animals in between. Seemed quite run down. The carousel was closed, and guess what? They don't do big cat feelings. We were finally told that food is \"used for training\" so they no longer do it. Ummm...huh? Don't they get to eat like normal animals?? No wonder they all look depressed and angry. The kids enjoyed it, but if you're in the area I would highly recommend the Oakland Zoo over this!", "author": "K T."}

Actually, the little kid in me just wants to spend all his time looking at animals, but the adult in me knows that a bunch of zoos treat their animals poorly and that really the only wild animals that belong in captivity are those that are endangered and those that are no longer able to survive in the wild.\n\nI came here with my mom and nephew last week.  I wasn't expecting much, and my expectation was just about met.  Actually, the scale of the place is really nice, especially when you're carting around a two-year-old who's more interested in water faucets than exotic animals.\n\nSo if this weren't a zoo, I might give it three stars for its layout and friendliness alone.  But it is a zoo, and a lot of the exhibits are depressing.  I love watching polar bears, but they just don't look happy in enclosures overgrown with weeds.  I also don't like the fact that it took the passage of a city law to force the zoo to get rid of its elephants after it had mistreated them.\n\nThe little train is cool; the grizzly-bear exhibit is super cute, especially when the bears are sleeping.  And the children's part of the zoo is really really really cool.  In fact, if this were the extent of the zoo, I would give it four stars.\n\nSo the real reason for one star is that because of the zoo's negligence, a man and a tiger are dead.  I know that a bunch of people think it's the taunters' fault that the tiger attacked them and that they \"deserved\" it--which is a ridiculous statement on its face; being mauled to death seems an extreme punishment for teasing and throwing things at a tiger--but it's ultimately the zoo's fault that the tiger was able to escape its enclosure.  The zoo had not built the tiger enclosure up to specifications, and the zoo's immediate response to the tragedy was to get a PR company to smear the victims' names in the papers.  You can say whatever you want about these guys, but the zoo is ultimately responsible for keeping the public safe.  Period.  They've since fixed the big cats' enclosures, so they're safe now.\n\nOne cool thing about this zoo is that you can see part of the African exhibit without even paying admission.  Just go up to the ticket office and watch the baby giraffes and gazelles through the fence.", "author": "John S."}

I figured it would be a magical place where the animals were well respected and humanely treated.  I never saw abuse at the other zoos, but this is San Francisco.  People love animals here.\n\nHow wrong I was.  This felt like some two-bit zoo in the middle of Podunk, Alabama.  \n\nThe Large Cat exhibit was atrocious.  There were hardly any signs to direct you to this tucked back display and I understand why.  The cages were overgrown with vines and trees.  The few cats that we did see were sacked out in their little boxes and looked no more special than your average SPCA cat.  the snow leopard was out and sleeping on a pedestal, but his cage was tiny as well.  The exhibit was poorly maintained, overgrown, uncomfortably small, and generally forgotten about.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the poor koala who was housed in a teeny glass box as if he were a necklace at Tiffany's.\n\nMy favorite animal, the river otter, was in a similarly small pen all by himself.  Just doing short laps back and forth.\n\nAbout half of the exhibits were closed.  And this was on a Saturday, I'd hate to see it on a Wednesday.  South American Tropical Forest - Closed.  Bald Eagle - Closed.  Little Puffer - Closed.  Lemurs - Locked up.  Black Swan - Gone.  Grey Seal - Gone.  Most Primate cages - Empty.\n\nThere was no shortage of peacocks, though.  It was as if all those missing animals had been transformed by the peacock fairy into these dumb birds that wandered all over the grounds of the zoo.\n\nI've heard that they're doing a lot to bring the SF Zoo back into prominence, so that's encouraging, but it was an overall disappointment.

The place was nearly empty, but surprisingly peaceful.\n\nAbout two years ago, I visited the Philadelphia Zoo. The deplorable conditions---small concrete cubes with very large, sad looking animals---made me want to join an anti-zoo organization of some sort. Well, being somewhat lazy and a non-joiner I never addd my voice to the fight against zoos, though I remained morally opposed.\n\nHowever, I'm also easily susceptible to peer pressure and when a group of friends suggested we trek all the way across town for a field trip to the zoo, I joined in. I was pleasantly surprised that the fee for SF Residents (with written proof, so bring a piece of mail if your license isn't up to date) is only $9...less than a movie!\n\nMy group wandered through the zoo for nearly 3 hours and I was thoroughly impressed with the exhibits. I don't pretend to know much about zoos or animals, but the environments looked very pleasant, including grassy areas, trees and toys, and none of the animals looked sad. There was also a lot of information about the animals posted, so it was truly an educational experience.\n\nThe only part I found a little disturbing was the lion and tiger feedings. The large animals are shut into small metal cages and are fed large lumps of meet while the audience oohs and ahhhs. Before they were fed, the lions and tigers were pacing and looked quite agitated. I can't really blame them, I wouldn't be too happy if 100 people watched me eat every day either.", "author": "Lara L."}

But the 21st century and technological inventions did not catch up with this place.  We can carry phones anywhere in the world and talk to anyone, and yet we are still so barbaric as to treat other creatures this way.\n\nThis is not to say I don't enjoy zoos or the concept of zoos.  This one in particular has a particularly atrocious track record of how they treat their animals.  \n\nWhile i happily report that sections of the zoo are under construction (hippos, specifically, which happen to be my favorite) it is unfortunately not enough to redeem this place.  20 seconds infront of the Polar Bears and you too will realize how demoralizing this zoo can be.", "author": "Monica B."}

They had bars and snax in many places and zoo interns walking around with animals at a pettable range: a baby alligator, a gorgeous snake, a giant owl, ferret,  a hedgehog. \n\nThe sit down dinner (their own caterer) was a very respectable salad, and bread, steak or polenta, and creme brulee. (Wedding DJs need to be spanked, though, why do they always insist on playing Me and Mrs Jones?) I digress..\n\nIf you have never fed a giraffe, it's worth the trip for that alone.

Everything else made me depressed basically.  \n\nEspecially the Orkney Seal....OMG.  Someone should just  shoot him and put him out of his misery.  I wanted to cry when I saw the state of his enclosure.  It's a disgusting paintpeeling green pond, that he's basically the same size of.  He swims in circles and looks absolutely suicidal.  The outside area is about the size of my bedroom and nothing fancy about it.  Just looks like an old rundown shack.  (I hope they do some kind of show with him during morning hours when schools are around, at least maybe he has something to look forward too?  I however didn't see it.)\n\nSo here's the thing, obviously this zoo is in dire need of some funding.  It's in a horrible state.  So I can either say this...If you feel empathy for even the smallest creatures don't go to this zoo.  It'll only make you cry and hate being human.  But then I'd feel guilty about deterring anyone from visiting, because they obviously could use the support.\n\nSo in conclusion:\nFor kids I'm sure this zoo is amazing.

I figured that for this labor day weekend, while I was not working, I would enjoy a cooler day while being outside.  San Francisco was the perfect choice.  i had never been to the zoo, and I did not feel like going to a movie.  Like Margaret said, \"why does it cost more to see a movie then to go the zoo.\"  I agree!  I spent the most fantabulous, did I mention COOL, 5 hours at the zoo.  Strolling around slowly, taking in the beautiful scenery, I truly had a wonderful day.   Not sure, but I felt like I was walking in a dream.  When you first walk in...you see my favorite part-the African Safari area.  Tall giraffes walking slowly next to zebra's and ostriches.  How amazing and odd to see such a magnificent  sight in the city.    Other mentionable highlights were the sleeping lions, tigers, and a particular rhino-he knows who he is, who was particularly excited in an x-rated fashion.   I know it's nature, but it does not make it any less shocking.   \n\nMy second favorite part was the children's petting zoo.  I admit I wanted to stay away, however, it was the highlight of the afternoon.  It was funny to walk among goats roaming around.  I couldn't get over how fat they were. They have food machines scattered around the petting zoo, and you can pay to feed them.  I was a little scared, because some of the goats were ramming people for food.   One even came after my bag, but I pushed him away.  It was funny.  I loved the little donkeys, alpaca's, and steed.  Moreover, I liked the nature walk where I saw bunnies, turtles, and even a chinchilla-wow, fur was soft and it takes 150 of them to make a coat...how SAD!  Only downfall was that there were many \"coming attractions,\" but I guess that makes me want to go back.\n\n\nParking was $6, and entry fee was $11.  They also have garlic fries, if you fancy.

My neighbor had encouraged us to become members four years ago as a place to go and walk around with the kiddie. He also said the member nights are great and you get to see night feedings. \n\nWell, we could have done other things on a Saturday night. Standing in lines all night for food, train, and tours was not my idea of \"fun\" at all. The train rides could have been one trip around instead of two to speed the line so people did not have to wait an hour for the train - and have kids breakdown in fits way past their bedtime. The worse part about the event was the bear feeding line got cut off right in front of me. She picked me because I was holding the line for the wife and kid and she eventually let me go ahead but the line never moved and I gave up. She was rude, the staff and volunteers were not happy to be there it was obvious. \n\nEverything was bottle-necked and the staff/volunteers did nothing to hurry the lines and all the members I was talking to were all complaining when their kids were out of earshot. Nobody wants to sound like the party-pooper but it was a joke. \n\nThe lights they had strung through dark walkways never went on and kids were crying as they tripped on short fences. The workers just honked as they went by on their Cushman's and never bothered to help or get the generators going. \n\nThe dancefloor was a great idea but with thousands of people and only enough room for twenty people on the dancefloor it was a horribly designed event. \n\nOutback was the food sponsor and - phttttt - the salad was soggy, the chicken was dry and way too peppered for kids, the meat was tender but with plastic cutlery it was impossible to cut.

All we could say is that I hope it was worth it to them to frustrate members for one successful evening. \n\nFidelity sponsored this and I would be concerned as a sponsor to have an event so poorly planned for the amount of people that reserved tickets and passes over a month ago. \n\nPlus, the polar bear always looks so sad and tells me he wants to go home.

Wanted to take the kids here today before my membership expires this month.  Took LOTS of pictures and videos.  We had a great time for the most part (the exhibit housing the alligators was closed and my son was bummed.  The train ride line was too long and my daughter was bummed.)\n\nHere are some helpful hints the next time you go:\n\n1.  Don't buy the membership if you don't go often.  They have \"free Wednesdays\" the first Wednesday on each month.  However, I saw a sign stating that they are changing the policy.  Stay tuned.\n\n2.  Get the carousel ride and train ride out of the way, if possible.  The train ride especially has a ridiculously long line, but worth the wait if you brave it in the afternoon.  Bonus tip for the carousel - tell them you will be standing and they won't charge you two bucks.  C'mon, don't be lazy.  The rides are for the kids people!\n\n3.  BRING YOUR OWN FOOD!  That should be a given, but I thought I would say it anyway.  Men - suck it up and bring a backpack.  Some favorite snacks for you and the kids, your favorite drinks, napkins, wipes and an extra change of clothes for the kids are not that heavy.  Don't be a wuss!\n\n4.  Family bathrooms - love them, especially when everyone has to go!  I only know about the one near the men's room by the playground area, but there has to be a few others in the zoo.\n\n5.  Parking fee - what a scam!  Don't pay it when you get to the Guest Services office or ticket window.  Go to the parking lot before you leave to see if \"security\" is monitoring and if the exit bar is up or down.  If it's up, they aren't checking for the bar code ticket.  Happened today.  Saw security, but he walked off and the bar was up.  I could have saved $8.00!\n\n6.  Check the website for events.  Fisher Price was there letting kids try out new toys and ride motorized vehicles (my son drove an Escalade and my daughter drove a Barbie Mustang).  That was a nice one hour distraction\n\nWeather was foggy, but what were you expecting in S.F.?  The sun?  LOL!\n\nWill be back again (when I'm free on the first Wednesday of every month)!", "author": "Mario P."}

We are fortunate to have 3 zoos so close to home, but this is the one we enjoy most.  There have been considerable improvements and upgrades over the last nine years that we have been regular visitors and noticed more construction under way on our visit this week.  My 2-year-old had a fantastic time on his most recent trip.  He loved the children's zoo, although he was a little nervous about animals out of their cages when we got to the petting zoo area and he was certain that the animals I was calling guinea pigs were in fact sheep, but other than that I would say this area was the highlight of his trip.  He also enjoyed watching the hippo come up out of the water to lay in the sun - what a sight!  His only disappointment was that he couldn't see dinosaurs at the zoo.\n\nWe took advantage of the first Wednesday of the month free admission day, were lucky enough to find street parking and packed our lunches ( a good idea on free day because the lines at the concession stands can be long), so the only money we spent was our $2 donation and a $2 carousel ride.

Map or no map, once you get far enough into the zoo, it's going to be hard to find your way out.  It's a definitely maze.  The signs that are supposed to guide you around are either too broad or not in the right place.  Some of them contradict themselves.\n\nLike any zoo, the animals are always a treat to see, especially if one enjoyed it as a kid and went to one after many years.

There are three separate areas, based on age group, and all the structures are made to look \"natural\".  There are more animals - a Rhino, hippopotamus, some sea lions and the Rain Forest building is now open.  The polar bear no longer had a \"green\" tinge to it's fur, and it might have been my imagination, but it seemed more content.  The former pachyderm building houses special exhibits.

The Carousel and Little Puffer train are a hit with kids. \n\nJust OK - the big cat and bear habitats seem to be lacking. The playground - yes, they have one, but the equipment looks like it is from the '70's. There is so much space it could be great. \n\nThe bad - Lots of closed exhibits, empty, dilapidated enclosures, including the building that once housed the elephants. Depressing. Nonexistent signs and meandering trails. We went on the last Sunday of Christmas break, and the restroom off the the Leaping Lemur Cafe was closed, and the restroom in the front of the zoo was disastrous.

One of those places that you want to explore but need a good excuse...like having a 4-year-old with you.  This weekend I finally got to take my niece here, and she loved it.  I had no idea what to expect here, size or quality-wise, but I was pretty impressed by both.  The african section in particular obviously had a lot of money poured into it.  I also wasn't really expecting the little one to last through the whole zoo, but amazingly she never got tired.  Her favorite part?  Probably the train ride.  It's nice how the train goes by the bears but otherwise it's kind of useless.  Why not have a train that loops around a big portion of the zoo, taking you to sweet vantage points you can't get to on foot?  Just an idea.\n\nAs for zoo politics, yeah, I'm not thrilled by these places either.  Especially because watching the animals on Planet Earth is about 10,000 times cooler, TV vs. real-life notwithstanding.  The captive breeding programs they have for endangered species are nice, but they don't really need a public zoo for that....or do they?  Maybe the admisison prices help fund it.  I don't know.\n\nSo unless you take the gravest possible exception to the existence of the zoo, definitely a cant-lose proposition for entertaining the kids.", "author": "Wes M."}

So she organized a little sojourn to the lovely little zoo to see her MySpace friends in their new home.  I even gave up Bingo to go along.  Bingo!\n\nFirst the trip out there was like traveling to another dimension.  Usually my trips to the parallel dimension require only a six pack and a closet size bathroom with all the lights off (don't ask).  This one only needed a long ass ride on the 5 and a transfer to the sketchy 18 (there was a mysterious substance on the windows and the driver liked her brakes a little bit too much - it was closely followed by one of Muni's new hybrid buses though so we totally got gipped on the cushy ride to the zoo) the driver knew we were looking for the zoo though and totally stopped in traffic to let us off since we missed our stop.  \n\nIt's a nice zoo, but it made me sad.  Seeing all the empty ghetto 1940's WPA era enclosures, with one forlorn looking polar bear who posed for a very opportune bear ass shot.  \n\nPenguin Island was cute, but those birds have some foul breath making such a ruckus before they got fed, everytime they cocked their heads back and started cawwing an overwhelming stench would blanket the island and I got so nauseous.  Birds are foul (fowl) with their backwards legs and beaks and feathers.  It ain't right.  \n\nI loved the monkeys and their riotous screams, swinging away... sitting down for a few minutes to pose for photos... no...  to poop.  Followed by a $9.75 snack of fries and chicken fingers at the Leaping Lemur.

The  animals seemed content, and had what seemed a reasonable habitat.\n\nWe found the conditions and appearance of the gorillas, the lions and tigers, the bears, and especially the polar bear and the anteater,  extremely depressing, and our baby daughter seemed to react badly to them as well. This model of displaying large animals is out of date now as it is recognized that keeping the animals in such constrained conditions is bad for them and not a hit with visitors. These  1940s-era habitats are inhumane, and the animals seem visibly miserable as a consequence. The anteater in particular was pacing neurotically in its tiny enclosure to such an extent it had worn a path in the grass. Does the zoo have any sort of animal welfare program? No obvious evidence for it, though you would certainly hope so. I noticed many of the older enclosures were closed off; is this a sign that they are trying to upgrade the animals' conditions? What is the rationale for having a waterfall in the lion's enclosure? So many questions, but no information on display and no staff around to ask.\n\nIn spite of the signs asking that visitors not disturb the animals, many visitors were doing just that, by shouting, tapping on glass etc, as the design of many of the displays allows them to do this. Considering  the high admission charge (the $8 parking fee in particular caused raised eyebrows), could they maybe think about hiring some staff to enforce this rule?\n\nI am sure that they have good intentions and have the welfare of their animals at heart, so why do they keep their animals this way?\n\nWe also found the food selection unhealthy and expensive. We are vegetarians and the selection was limited. The kids' mac and cheese seemed to be missing the cheese.\n\nSorry to be so negative as I am sure these guys are trying their best, but it's been a very long time since I visited a zoo which left me so depressed and I wanted to share the feeling. I'd love to think I could come back in a year or two with my family and see happy animals and have a better experience. Alternatively they could donate the animals to a facility that will look after them properly and build some sort of theme park on the site instead.

TONS of animals and lots of nature-y stuff. \n\nSF Zoo?  Not so much.  We went on Mother's Day Sunday about an hour and a half before they closed.  All the animals were sleeping!  No elephants!

It's a huge zoo, but with so few animals (and no elephants), it's just a glorified natural trail!\n\nI doubt I'll be back here.  I just was not impressed.

The workers (including the volunteers) did not really organized before the zoo opened.  Some procedures were not well-communicated; some asked for the visitors' ID to make sure that they are living in SF to meet the requirement of free admission on Family Appreciation Day; some workers just handed out the bands; some asked us to wait in line and some really wanted to let us go; someone gave us a map and another worker wanted to take it back....\n\nMy husband really wanted to get an annual pass for the family but I asked him to hold it after the visit to make sure that we would plan to come back again in the year...and this was a right decision...\n\nFirst of all, the admission fee is $15 per person, $12 if you are living in SF, children under 3 years old free.  For a family of 2 adults and 2 kids under 3, each visit costs $24.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-31", "description": "My husband and I got married this past May in the San Francisco Zoo, and we were thrilled we chose it as our venue.  The zoo was beautiful, cooperative, and well-organized throughout the process.\n From the start, the zoo was helpful, working with us to schedule our big day appropriately.  Originally we had looked at an April wedding, but despite having openings that month, they advised us to wait until May for better weather.  As planning continued, the zoo made things easy on us. For example, they took care of the catering, tables, linens, and open bar.  This made them almost a one-stop-shop and made our lives that much easier.  They offered us a wide menu of food options, and worked with us to set up a buffet for our guests (per our request) after inviting us to taste some of their entrees.  About a month prior to the wedding, the zoo coordinator worked with us to get our photographers, florist, and day-of planners into the zoo so they could look over the reception hall, venue, and even much of the zoo for photography planning purposes.  The zoo coordinated with us as we made our own tickets for our guests (the zoo allows free access to wedding party members), but with our vouchers guests were also allowed to enter into the zoo early for a reduced price if they wanted to see some animals.  Overall, despite it being a wedding, the zoo made the process as smooth and easy as you can imagine.\n Since the wedding was to occur after the zoo closed, our coordinator worked with us to take pictures prior to the ceremony.  Thus, we and the wedding party were able to take photos in front of our favorite animals including lemurs, pelicans, and bears.  The zoo also cooperated with us to get photographs on the carousel and their little train.  They ultimately let us take as many pictures as possible before the ceremony, giving us only the problem of sorting through them all! \n The wedding venue itself was the area situated in the African Savannah exhibit.  Guests must transit through one of two tunnels to get there, allowing for the bride to stay concealed until the start of the ceremony, but also surrounding our guests with a variety of animals including giraffes, zebras, ostriches, and Marabou storks among others.  For animal lovers like us, this gave the wedding a great exotic/wild feeling to it, and also made for some excellent photo opportunities.  For planning purposes, the savannah seating area fits around one-hundred guests.  While this was our desired wedding size, it could limit you if you are looking to have more guests.\n Following the wedding, we treated our guests to a giraffe feeding and five animal encounters.  The giraffe feeding brings the wedding party, and subsequently guests, into the giraffe house to pet and then feed them bananas and leaves.  None of us had ever pet or fed a giraffe before, so it made for a fun and memorable experience. \nMeanwhile, since only about twenty-five guests can fit in the giraffe house at once, the rest of our guests enjoyed cocktail hour with drinks, hors d oeuvres, and the five encounters.  For the encounters, the zoo has animal trainers bring out five animals (the zoo gave us a list of about twelve animals that were typically available, but realize that sometimes trainers are not on hand or animals could be sick so there may be last minute changes) for our guests to pet, examine, and learn about.  We chose the golden eagle, a hedgehog, an alligator, an opossum, and an owl.  As with the giraffe feeding, it made for a memorable and fun experience for both ourselves and our guests, and it also allowed us to have unfettered time to take photographs after the ceremony. \nFinally, the Great Hall made for an excellent location for our reception.  With its large fireplace and high ceilings, it made for a grand but homey setting for our celebration.  The buffet was well organized in the back, and we had plenty of room for 100 guests, our sweetheart table, food, cakes, and our DJ, with plenty of room to dance as well.  Also, despite the high ceiling, the sound quality in the room was excellent.  Outside of the hall was a lobby area where the open bar was located along with our photo booth, which provided enough room for our guests during cocktail hour.  Just past the lobby was the dressing room for the bride, allowing everything to be centralized but still appropriately separated.  \nIf you are animal lovers looking for a memorable wedding, the San Francisco Zoo is for you.  It offers great views and memorable experiences while accommodating your wedding's logistics.  As an added bonus, you can be happy that the proceeds from your ceremony will go to help the zoo's animals.", "author": "Kate S."}

Huh? Very strange. Animals are not necessarily going to perform just because you're looking at them. My husband and I took a trip to the zoo recently. We love zoos. We were probably one of the few adult, childless couples there that day, but who cares. Zoos aren't just for kids. I had never been to the SF zoo either so I was pumped. We ended up having a really good time. The admission price is very reasonable, the zoo is laid out well, and there is a lot to see. My favorite exhibits were the meerkats/prarie dogs in the little kid area and the grizzly bears. All of the animals were cute and seemed well cared for. My only small issue and why I bumped down a star is because some of the signage and displays were a little confusing or difficult to read. I think if they put a fresh coat of paint on the place it would really shine. Even so, I think it's a very nice zoo and I will definitely be back. I suggest a visit if you're in the area!", "author": "Hylary L."}

Other than that visit, I haven't been since I was a kid. I have to say, the zoo was just okay. I don't know what it was, maybe it was because it was cold, but all the animals seemed...sad. The best part were the lions that were still in their cages and we got pretty close to them. Still, they were sad...just pacing back and forth again and again. The giraffe and zebra exhibit is the biggest and we were able to sit and watch them for a little bit. The bird exhibit was closed, but I didn't mind since I'm not a bird fan. The food...was horrible. The best part was the coffee since it was so cold.\n\nAlright - for the Reindeer Romp, the whole reason we really went. It wasn't anything more than what looked like a large petting zoo. It was a temporary enclosure with a few reindeer and hay. That's it.\n\nI'd like to go again when it's warmer - hopefully that's when animals perk up and are more active. I don't know if there are bears now, but there weren't any when I was there. I didn't feel like there were many animals at all actually. We saw the whole zoo in maybe 2 hours.\n\nIf you can go on a free Wednesday and on a warmer day, that's the day I suggest you go. Even on a regular day, I think it's only like $11/person, which isn't bad at all, but there really isn't much to see or do.", "author": "Caroline I."}

I also enjoyed petting grumpy goats at the petting zoo.\n\nThere isn't much of a selection as far as food is concerned.  You better eat before you come or plan to spend a ridiculous amount of money on greasy food that is terrible for you.  Also, apparently straws and lids are a hazard for animals, so if you get an Icee be prepared to eat it with a spoon.  I found this method to be surprisingly enjoyable though!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-12-07", "description": "One of San Francisco's bigger tourist and local attractions, the SF Zoo has a lot of exhibits missing for their consistent price of $12 per adult.  It isn't the cleanest zoo, but it is one of the most complete in Northern California.\n\nAside from aggressive seagulls that may aim for your delicious churro, the zoo is very secure and safe for your children.  So far, only the peacocks run loose and roam freely, but they are perfectly harmless.\n\nI visited the zoo just last March of 2006.  As I recall, there should have been elephants and camels, but I saw none.  The exhibit location where they used to be was entirely empty.\n\nThe African exhibit is always naturally exciting simply because we don't see those animals anywhere else in the world.  That's where they put the giraffes, kudu, ostrich, and waterbuck.  Of course, for anyone that has gone on an actual safari, this exhibit is small potatoes.  It would be nice if they had warthogs to insipre the kids who so always love Pumba from The Lion King.\n\nThis zoo also features a primate house and diverse aviary.  There's also an insect and probably reptile house (none are of my taste, so I didn't bother to confirm a reptile exhibit).  For those who love the Australian Outback, there is a small walk and field of kangaroos and wallaby's that will definitely contribute to capturing a cute romantic moment.\n\nOne of the very interesting exhibits is the Meerkat burrows.  You can peer into the rocky walls through the built in windows and observe the meerkats that are sleeping or working indoors.  However, there is one healthy precaution to note:  people  (kids especially) spread germs easily and to look through these windows, you have to get up close to almost touching the window with your eyes so close to it.  Spare yourself the pink eye and bring a travel pack of sanitary wipes to clean the surface before peeking.\n\nGoing at 1-2pm is probably not the best time since most animals were sleeping.  Only the black bears were active that day among the mammals.  Either they all just eaten, or many were also just being fed and thus difficult to see.  To find the best time, call in to check on feeding times and exhibit activity schedules.\n\nKids can also purchase keys, for a price, in which they can put into machines to listen to exhibit information.\n\nEat before you go.  It is best to not have to purchase expensive lunches with aggressive seagulls circling like vultures over your french fries.", "author": "Gregory F."}

This was striking to me given that 99% of the time I come to the zoo, loads of people crowd the walkway to the entrance at any given time in the afternoon.\n\nIt was quite \"dead\" and quiet. Getting in was a breeze, but the massive 'SFRES' hand stamp, really now? Enough with that, but I was scouring to find the maps which is the first thing I always do at attractions/theme parks/museums. It was in an unmarked cardboard box on a table in the middle of the path. Just looking at it dictated the rest of my time spent. The unflattering 1pg half-fold was so bland that I just threw it in my Ruehl bag I was holding and just started walking to whatever trail was first, and lo and behold it was the lemurs. I never actually got to see them ever since the last major remodel since the children and students would be crowding the lookout points. The lack of bustle yesterday was to my advantage, thank goodness. \n\nFast forward because I don't want to tell a story, I had trouble navigating since I was not familiar with the new layout. Tip: get two maps from the start (and don't forget to recycle them afterward)! I was disappointed for the most part since the new zoo is a big step downward from my younger days. I mean, c'mon...no elephants, no bears, no aviary/tropical forest, you get the point. I don't recall seeing hippos either. The experience is completely lackluster and anything but fun. Pretty much the only thing fun you will find, is that good for nothing steam train. I don't see how the animals can stand that racket on a daily basis, let alone the zoo keepers and employees. My favorite koalas were not out today. Major downer! Now, what the Zoo needs is funding to renovate the ancient exhibits. The poor tapir gets no attention whatsoever, and he's not the only animal that's basically nonexistent. \n\nI spent the most time probably at the Insect Zoo in the Children's Zoo. Lots of fine specimens, but could be much better. The petting zoo was thriving, which was a much needed change in the attitude of the day. The prairie dogs right next door have gotten much fatter since the last time I visited them. And where are the meerkats? \n\nMy my, what a way to start the new decade.

It appears that alot of the animals have passed on since then. I didn't realize they keep the same animals for 30 plus years or until they die. You would think they would have tried to mate them or bought sum younger animals. There were several animal cages empty and some saying how the animal had recently passed. I will say the animals looked ok as far as health and well being. That is honestly my main concern. The grizzly bears are nice cuz we got their and they had just put the food out to feed them. They came barreling around the corner ready to eat. I was upset that they didn't have any elephants. I remember them having them as kids but I guess they died too which is surprising because I thought elephants could live like 50 years but what do I know. All in all the kids really enjoyed themselves and it was free to get in because it was the first wedsday of the month.", "author": "Jenn G."}

Walking around brought back memories of my five-year-old self on the kindergarten trip to the zoo.  Yes, they made us eat sitting around that big fountain, where we could face the penguins.  I remember the hippo, and was saddened to read of her death just months ago after an extremely long life.\n\nI know it is politically correct to hate zoos and cages for animals.  However, I do know that this is not a one-sided issue.  For example, these caged animals get the best medical care and food available and often live twice as long as their wild brethren.  I also can see that the zoo is trying hard to give these animals as stressfree life as possible.  A screen of thicket around a monkey enclosure to give privacy when raising youngsters is an example.\n\nI wonder what _we_ as patrons are doing to further the cause.  One thing that distressed me was that while observing a monkey with a small baby clinging to her back... people were repeated  using their flash, even though they probably only got flash reflected by glass.  It was annoying.  Another thing was small children wandering behind the barricades at the monkey enclosure.  Kiddos will be kiddos, but I hated (HATED) that the mom SCREAMED at them to get back... :::sigh:::  I guess I think that kiddos should be scooped up and brought back a little more quietly... rather than subject _everyone_ to the scream.  Personally, it used to scare me a little more when my mom was quiet and deadly... but hey... here is the childless professional who has learned not to have an opinion on how other people are raising their children.. just please don't scream in my ear, I am well behind the barricades.\n\nWhat was the most impressive?  The HUGE paws of the polar bear?  The frentic playfulness of the otters?  The iridescent plumage of the peacock?  The frightening roars from the lion enclosure?  The playful head rub of the tiger as she passed her enclosure-mate (the same gesture I have see my cat make a million times)?  The stare of the huge heron behind the screen?  These and a hundred more were my favorites in our hour-and-a-half walk.\n\nWe will be back.  We turned in our admissions toward a family pass.

Today I went along with my group to perform at the zoo's Chinese New Year celebration. I'm glad I didn't pay.\n\nI remember the zoo to be a lively place. There used to be bustling crowds with happy children in awe of the wildlife. The animals were vibrant and energetic. You could always count on the primates to cause a ruckus with their constant yelping (no, not a pun) and mischievous behavior.\n\nMaybe my memory serves me wrong? Maybe as a kid you're oblivious to the fact that this place just isn't that happy? Maybe this place has just deteriorated over the years?\n\nWhat I observed today on a typical cold, foggy San Francisco day was an unkept, old zoo filled with seemingly sedated animals. Maybe they were just bored and tired from being confined to these cells? What became more and more apparent was that I was walking around a prison with animals that aren't \"living,\" but just existing. \"Hey look, that polar bear looks like it's posing to be a rug,\" said one patron while I was walking by the exhibit. I bet that guy thought it was sort of cool, but most \"wild animals\" don't play like they're log cabin rugs. The only redeeming quality to this place is the African exhibit with giraffes, zebras, etc. This was the only exhibit that was vibrant and roomy with animals that didn't look like prisoners. And yet this exhibit sits under the dull, cold, and foggy San Francisco weather. It's even worse that it's by the ocean. Has anyone ever thought this might not be the appropriate habitat for most of these animals? Is there freakin' fog in Africa???

I love the San Francisco Zoo.  I was born in San Francisco, and some of my earliest pleasant memories are of playing in the zoo playground, riding on the carousel and my combination of horror and delight when Puddles the Hippo would flick his tail back and forth, showering the crowds with his....um...hippo manure.  Of course back in those days there was also Monkey Island, which fell way short of a PG rating for oh so many reasons.  The roars in the Lion House still evoke almost cellular memories of awe  that I'm pretty sure go back even further than my childhood.\n\nNow I know the SFZoo, or Fleishaker Zoological Gardens, as we knew it then, can be a bit lackluster, especially in contrast to more modern and animal-friendly spaces such as the San Diego Wild Animal Park, but when the fog comes seeping in between the Monterey Cypress and there's a little salt water mist in your hair, the beach is a stone's throw, and the Doggie head is smiling, everything is all right in the world.\n\nThe downsides? OK, a tiger \"went tiger\" [Chris Rock] there, ostensibly because the zoo was cutting a few corners.  Big Deal.  I have to confess that I believe anyone teasing a tiger pretty much deserves whatever they get, and hurrah for animals being animals and not some domesticated super-sized housecat.  And the bears always look a bit morose, don't they.  The otters and seals deserve more as well - a few toys maybe?  Some water jets for those hard-to-reach place, hm?...hmmmn?\nBut overall, when you've walked the SF Zoo, you feel like you've actually WALKED (unlike the Oakland Zoo), and seen some things.\n\n I also have to mention here that the single sexiest thing I've ever seen in my life...and I've seen a few...was at this zoo.  Oh Sure, you say, in front of the children and all?  Yes, siree.  It was the Spring of 80-something, before they moved the smaller cats out to the gulag.  The Snow Leopards were...well, making more Snow Leopards.  The male was clearly completely shagged out by the time I got there, lying glazed-eyed and breathing hard.  The female pulls herself up by the forelegs, and in a languid motion that would put the best pole dancer to complete shame, nudges the male's face with her head, then proceeds to drag her entire body across the front of his face, lingering particularly with her hind quarters and her gorgeous full tail, which caressed his head like a hand.  There was no space between the final inches of her tail and the motion with which he exhaustedly raised himself as though she and he were magnetized. He circled her, did what they do, and resumed his fatigued recovery.  This went on several times as I watched, fascinated, and taking notes.....\n\nah, but I digress.  Where was I?  Oh yeah, people say the food isn't great - what do you expect, it's the frikking ZOO!  Pack a lunch if you've got kids, or bite the bullet - hell, they've got some edible Asian food there, and that's more than most zoos can say.  Take the day, drive out early, when it's still foggy, linger with the gorillas and the African Savannah, delight in the goofy little lemurs, then go to the beach for sunset.

I explained how attending the zoo should be an educational experience, and though the animals there are in captivity; they are happy, well fed, and protected.  They are better off here than in the wild, because they represent the beauty of their species, and bring humans closer to caring about the precious life on this world.  I made her read the first 5 chapters of Life Of Pi for gods sake -and if you haven't read the book then maybe you should- but don't expect to come away from the SF Zoo feeling enlightened, educated, or optimistic about animals, their habitat (natural or re-created), and animal captivity in general.\nCan a zoo feel tired?  This zoo felt like it was tired.  Thus the animals: tired.  The river otter, rhino, and polar bear were all standing and moving around, but we think it was because they've lost their minds.  No, really.  \nThe river otter was alone in his enclosure, but swears he's being followed.  He chased his tail until he finally caught it, fell down, and went to sleep with his tail down his throat.\nThe rhino cannot face towards the crowd, so all you get to see is his ass.  And if he needs to walk to the other side of his pen to eat, he does so with his ass right in your face.  Remarkable how you can see the same show at the food court.\nThe polar bear could've been a statue for all I know.  He was standing and looked angry.  A frozen, angry grimace over a tiny pool of water not suitable for a freakin otter.  I shit you not, the otter had twice the water of the polar bear!  I'm not an expert, but I've watched enough Discovery Channel to know that these beasts do enjoy a good swim once and a while.  What the fuck does a polar bear need a reflecting pool for??\nOkay, enough blog.  Time for something useful.\n\nThe first Wednesday of every month is free admission.  Cool.\n\nWear jeans and bring a jacket, even if you start the day in shorts.  This area of town is seemingly shrouded in mist, wind, and clouds more often than other areas.\n\nE. Bring a baby stroller. Who cares if you have a baby or not?! Everyone has one so just bring it!

I imagined the Korean girl that served me giggling as I walked away, spilling hot liquid on my hand.  \"I told him we don't have lids! hee hee!\"\n\nSteal a quick look at the meerkats in the kids area, and then if you don't have kids, make a break for the exit as fast as you can.\n\nPretend like you're taking pictures of the exhibits, but really take them of the backs of the people standing in front of you.  Snap off a good 20 or 30 shots of anyone there.  Get prints develops at Walgreens in 5x7, then take them to the gym with you and tape one up on the eliptical machine in front of you.  One for everyday of the month.  Hot damn, instant motivation.\n\nSee the grizzly bears.  Not a bad exhibit, looks pretty new.  Lots of playing when we were there.\n\n\nTake the survey at the end of the day.  There are volunteers with clipboards standing at the exit on your way out.  My gal is the one who agreed to take the survey (on behalf of us both), and I'm glad she did.  I would never have thought to give my feedback, and that's exactly what these people are there for.

The lion feeding was always my favorite but they don't do that anymore. In fact they don't do a lot of anything anymore. We went on Wednesday with my 4 year old brother and it was $8 for parking, $15 for each adult, and I forgot how much I paid for my brother but it was ridiculous how much that place cost for the crap experience. There are no elephants, no hippos, no tiger/lion feeding, the baby gorilla was nowhere in site, the lions were on the floor in the cage and you could barely see them, only one gorilla was out and really visible, all the bears were asleep and in the back of the exhibits except the grizzlies. The rhinos were in the back of their exhibit, the kangaroos are always asleep. Overall everything was either asleep or not in its cage, except the african exhibit at the front with the zebras, giraffes and other animals was really cool. That was the best part of the zoo. The little train is a $4 rip off. The carosuel wasn't working. The building with the reptiles is still closed. Basically this zoo is a huge rip off because they have no animals and the ones they do have are sleeping and everything is closed/doesn't work. \n\nMy 4 year old brother had a way better time at the Oakland Zoo. \n\nDon't waste your money until this place gets their act together.", "author": "Cheri M."}

I guess I would too if I had to live in a *natural habitat* such as theirs.  It  just always looks overgrown and , oddly, at the same time, bare (how do they manage that combination??)   I do occasionally go for a change of scenery for the kiddies, but always leave disappointed. \nThe kids like the petting zoo, but  even my 3year old won't brush the over-stuffed (to the point of near bursting) sheep-things because the filth is too much (but, they ARE animals, so I guess that's par for the course).  The sheep-things can be fairly aggressive when they sense you have a pile of kibble in your hand so very young children are often scared off.  Maybe they should rotate the sheep-things to regulate their diet and curtail their kibble-from-hand mania.  The roosters are pretty.   All the kids fight over turns on the tiny tractors.  There are two - and one is in disrepair. Parents watch the kids clamor for their turn with a greedy eye, checking their watch (\"umm, it's little Jake's turn- your Emily has been on the tractor for 3.5 minutes already...\")\n\nThe cafe is terribly over-priced and food is average-to below average for this type of venue.   AND - this really kills me,  the doors are too small to easily allow the double-stroller that they rent out.  Without fail I am at the mercy of some other mother or father who has been in the same boat as me.  You think they would realize the majority of patrons are parents with small children who rent these strollers- they should accommodate.  There is also a very very snotty guy who works the cafe... the zoo nazi... ready to pounce if he senses a particle of food has dropped from your kid's plate and now available for the swarming pigeons. \"PLEASE DON'T FEED THE ANIMALS!!!\"  he scolds. \nNo lids/straws for drinks as they are choking hazards for animals.  Many-a-spilled-drink at the hands of little ones who haven't mastered the open top cup.\n\nThere is a train that takes you for a double loop around a portion of the  zoo.  My kids LOVE this and have a grand time waving at everybody as they chug-chug by.  They love that train so that alone makes my trips worth it.   \n\nOne thing there is a lot of are what appear to be divorced father's on *their weekend* with the kid/s... so you ladies in search of an insta-family - here's a good alternative to meeting men at a bar.\n\nI must say, thought that this zoo is better than the Sacramento or Oakland zoos.", "author": "Meg W."}

To be fair, the Zoo did have most of the animals a person would want to see, but just not in the conditions you want to see them in. I can recall going to zoo's when I was younger and thinking the animals were at least somewhat happy.  Before I get into my breakdown of a few select animals I would hate to forget mentioning the fact that the caf\u00e9 was deplorable. The food was disgusting, and I believe being 75 pounds overweight with \"super\" nacho remnants dripping onto your shirt was a pre-requisite to sitting at the tables. If not, it was just a huge coincidence shared by everyone dining there. Moving along:\n\nGorilla's  - There were three total in the exhibit. Their habitat was far too small and the silver back looked like he wanted to commit suicide as he sadly looked at everyone take photographs of him. I wouldn't be surprised if he does in fact take his own life in the near future. \n\nSeal - Notice I didn't use the plural form. One of the good parts of the Zoo is the \"interesting facts\" posted on the outside of the exhibits. The interesting Seal fact was that they can dive up to 475 feet deep and hold their breaths underwater for 20 minutes. Well, this Seal was confined to what would be considered a small pool in someone's backyard, and the water depth was around three feet. The area surrounding the pool consisted of dirty and cracked concrete. The Seal appeared to be dead as it was lying lifeless in the left corner of this kiddie pool. We hoped for the best and moved on. On our way out of the Zoo we stopped by to check up on him and sure enough he had not moved a centimeter (two hours had passed). In an attempt to find out if this thing had in fact passed away I threw a quarter at it. After a delayed reaction the Seal took a lap around its bucket and settled back into his familiar position. It wasn't until the drive home that we noticed in the Zoo literature that throwing coins into the water exhibits is highly dangerous for the inhabitants (I think I did the thing a favor).\n\nChimpanzee's - A chimp was sitting on a stump in his tree house flipping through a magazine page by page. The magazine was oriented appropriately for reading and he spent about five seconds on each page. One of the more odd things I have seen in awhile.\n\nI could go on and on, but this review is already to long. The fact is the Zoo needs some larger exhibits for the animals. The next time I go to the Zoo it will be because my future children make me. \n\nP.s. - the hippo on display actually was dead...", "author": "Coach K."}

It's way too cold out there by the ocean.  They have a bunch of African wild animals like giraffes, lions, and rhinos who are adapted through millenia to thrive in very hot African heat.  The time we were there, it was so freakin' cold that I couldn't even stay in the open very long.  The wind was howling through there, and I could only imagine how miserable those animals must be.\n\n2. In the lion's den, they have a rock that is heated underneath and is placed strategically in front of the viewing window.  While this is a clever way of getting the lions to not avoid people-- which they would clearly rather do-- it's also sad that such animals are forced to live in such an unnaturally cold climate.\n\n3. The zoo is quite spread out, being mostly outdoors.  The daily lion feedings are cool, though the place gets swamped by the unwashed masses of families and their screaming kids.  Must not be very relaxing for the caged lions and tigers.  Certainly wasn't for us.\n\n4. Oakland zoo does everything the SF zoo does, and does it better.

It may not be the most prime location for many of the animals (nearby Ocean Beach is nowhere near an African Savannah-like environment); But, I think it brings the city back to 'nature' as a constant reminder that just cuz you live in a big populous, urban environment, doesn't mean you can't appreciate wildlife!  It's become quite trendy and very crowded in the past years, especially since the renovation.  But still, I am always forced to slow down and appreciate the surroundings.  I think they've really got a great educational setting for city and peninsula kids, and a great program for teens, pre-teens to volunteer while learning about different animals of the world;  By extension, they promote conservation, land stewardship and generel awareness and appreciation of diversity.  That can't be a bad thing, right?  My favorite exhibit - Primates baby!  \n\nThe zoo has come a long way in creating exciting new events for old and young alike with lecture series, special member events and children-focused events, too.", "author": "Olma M."}

I always find it amusing since I come every once in a long while. The animals are cute but I guess sometimes you feel bad for them cause they've been stuck in cages forever.

It is really obvious that all of the work is not done, but it's starting to look good.\nThe African exhibit was the best.  Two baby giraffes, 3 adults, zebras, ostriches, cranes, and other safari animals all in one walkabout.  The layout really let us get close.\nThe gorillas are still there, funny as ever.  They also have three baby Tigers on display now.  \nHowever, since the tragedy in the tiger area, it now resembles a prison rather than a zoo.  That area looks scary and I miss the old one.  It worked for so many years without problems!  Now there are also signs around the park reminding those stupid punks that animals are sensitive and have feelings too...\nI might wait a few years to return based on all of the empty exhibits.

They were all cute and cuddly and playing in the water! BEARS! THe polar bears came out too! TO POOP! Lions were lazy! tigers were playful. Koalas were... being themselves. Kids were annoying! Lets lock kids up in the zoo instead. I saw the zoo chuck full of zoo keepers, care takers, and volunteers more than happy to answer any question that could have come up. Even the dumb questions we asked... The animals get taken care of very well at the zoo, and if you pansy ass cry babies don't think so, why don't you try and volunteer at to zoo and see how well they are taken care of instead of just bitching about things you want to see differently but are too lazy to do anything about... The zoo has changed sooo much since I have been a little kid, and it has changed for the better. They are constantly making imporvements for the animals so you can better enjoy them. Instead of complaing about the zoo, and feeling bad, donate your time or money in order to get changes made. I LOVE THE ZOO. I especially like the birds of prey, I need to watch that show. Owls are neat. We got to see baby giraffes in side their own custom built barn! It was 4 months old and taller than me! I'm 6'2\" Taller than ME!\n\nLemurs are amazing cool, and have like a whole jungle gym with jungle in it.\n\nI really do love the ZOO.\n\nZOO!\n\nthey update the big cat habitat now, it's a shame it happened, but sure it should have been updated a long time ago I guess, but I have been going for 24 years and I've never had a problem. \n\nZOO!", "author": "danny e."}

We rarely even make it to the other areas of the zoo because we hit the African Safari area, the gorillas and then head over to the children's zoo.  \n\nThe area by the penguins is really depressing so we don't go over there.  It's really an old school type display and just kind of gives me that yucky feeling.  The bear displays are also pretty damned depressing.\n\nThe zoo is small enough that if we don't get there until 1pm we have time to enjoy everything.  \n\nI do like the farm animal area and my DD enjoys using the wheel barrows and the little brooms.\n\nIf my DD could rate it she'd give it a 5 stars.

There always seems to be animals missing or hiding though - it can get a tad tedious at times, especially if you've already been there before. But it's certainly worth checking out regardless. If you go on the weekend on a sunny day, parking will be hell in the afternoons.  Parking is usually pretty open if the weather isn't the best and in the mornings. Make sure you go way down to the southwest(ish) corner to see the big cats - if you're lucky they won't be sleeping or hiding. Saw a fishing cat \"catch\" and eat a fish. One time a snow leopard was sprinting back and forth in the cage - it was really cool to see, but pretty sad at the same time.

I went there during one of those very rare warm days and it was packed with families and tourists.  I can only imagine what it's like on a Wed. when the only people there are school kids and seniors out for a walk in the bitter cold and fog.\nMany of the main exhibits were closed and the ones that were open seemed poorly maintained.  The soil these poor creatures were walking on was dry as the Sahara Desert; lacking in both moisture and green vegetation.\nI am a skeptic when it comes to zoos and I'll save those arguements for the PETA people.\nOne thing that tipped me off about the lack of attention this place gets is the signs by each animal, that was authored by a zoo attendant.  Many were hand written, which is fine, in 2005 and 2006.  Hello?\nAlso I like to learn a few things at a zoo so I look forward to reading the informational sign by each \"cage\".

The lack of character in this zoo is just amazing. Its as if they built a zoo on a bare minimum mentality. Seriously.....trash floods the sidewalks at certain areas of the park. Lack of animals is something too, and the animals they do have seem to have nothing to keep themselves entertained so basically you're going around and watching animals sleep. They seem sick, habitats seem damn small, pretty filthy looking.  Everything and I mean EVERYTHING needs to be touched up, modernized, and just all around needs attention.  Irwin, Hannah, and Corwin would probably puke. Its sad that a great, loving city such as san fran has settled for the bottom of the barrel when it comes to their zoo. As I said, they seem to have put the bare minimum in what it takes to have, run, and maintain a zoo. They even sell beer there which is funny. Who in the shit needs beer at a damn zoo ??? They need two things. A.)    A bailout or B.)  Start from scratch.  For San Francisco, the parking was pretty good. Just park on the outside and save ten bucks. I usually donate money to zoo's as well, and I was looking around and thinking to myself. \"Well this zoo obviously shows that their donations are going into someones pocket rather than the animals and the parks well being.\"  I mean dont get me wrong, its a great way to spend a day and look at a FEW animals.

In the childrens petting zoo the food for the goats used to be 25 cents now it's 50 cents and you get about 1/2 a handful of food. \nI guess the zoo is trying to raise revenue to pay for the lawsuit from the kid killed by the tiger last year. They certainly are not spending the money to improve any of the exibits or grounds. \nI got really pissed on the way out when I stopped to pay for parking and the automatic machine was broken and I'm waiting in a line 10 people deep to get my parking ticket and I'm listening to the two old hens behind the counter talk to each other about some Jazz festivale and moving like snails.\nI think the zoo should be closed and fixed and cleaned up.

It was kinda depressing seeing the animals on display in their fake habitats meanwhile people are staring and pointing taking pictures + whatnot. I haven't been to this zoo since I was in 6th grade but I remember a very different zoo back then. I think my 6th grade experience was a lot better because well...I was in 6th grade... but after growing up and becoming a lil more conscious about things I've had a bit of resentment to these sort of places. Not so much the protecting/caring that they do for the animals, but the commercial side of it leaves my mouth kinda bitter..", "author": "Adrian S."}

Same old shizz different day right? Eh not so much. The location is awesome, and lately it seems as if we're timing it so new animals come or go. My favorite Zoo moment, um the rhino with the giant \"happy to see you\" body part hanging out.

Some of favorite things to do is go to the petting zoo first, because I like to feed the goats, and sheep, then I like to check out the Insect Zoo. I love the insect zoo, because I used to raise a few insects myself growing up.\n\n Then I like to head over to the South American room. You have to go through a double door to conserve heat. When you go in if you have glasses, sometimes your glasses will start getting foggy. I love to check out the fishes like the pacu, and the arrowona. The cool thing is the arrowna is gold I think, They also added some live birds to the room, and my favorite the huge green anaconda.", "author": "Mike h."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-03", "description": "I'll preface this by saying I came to this zoo all the time as a kid, and it's always been dear to my heart.  I'm only giving it 4 stars, because while it's still great, there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\nDespite the bad points, the pros far outweigh them, and this zoo is still great. If I had kids I would take them there in a second.  And the more of us that do that, the more money they'll have to finish renovating and fixing the problem areas.\n\nOh and for people that complain about admission prices, it's 1/3 the cost of Great America, goes to a great cause, and helps make our world a better place.\n\nFirst off the cool parts:\n1.  The new African Savannah is awesome.  Having the Giraffes, Zebras, Ostriches and other animals together is great, and there's never a dull moment.  The young Giraffes are so much fun to watch.\n2.  Children's petting zoo.  Always a crowd pleaser.\n3.  The Penguins. OMG they're so much fun to watch.  The SF ZOO has one of the most vibrant penguin communities in captivity, and it's paid off.  Tons of young and active penguins zooming around and frolicking.  The penguin keepers seem to be more visibile and participatory with the public than in any other exhibit, you can tell they love their jobs.  Don't miss feeding time!\n4.  The Primates.  Though it's starting to show it's age, the primate habitat is still great, with a large diversity of monkeys, gorillas, chimpanzees, squirrel monkeys, etc, all fairly active even on a cold day.\n5.  Lemurs.  Seem to spend a lot of their time sleeping, but man are they adorable.  They sleep in clumps, where all you'll see are heads and tails poking out.\n7. Avian Conservation Center.  It's near the children's zoo, and is a great opportunity to see large raptors up close and personal.\n8. Praire Dogs and Meerkats.  It's like watching a town of speed addicts. Fun Times :)\n\nNow the bad or in need of improvement:\n1.  The ancient bear habitats.  The Grizzlies now have a new enclosure that is great, but the rest of the bears are still stuck in concrete enclosures from the 1940's.  They all seem to be alone and old.  I'm sure they still have their good days, but it just felt depressing.\n2.  The lack of cats.  They still have tigers and snow leopards and lions.  But except for one forest river cat (who caught a fish for dinner!), all the small cats were gone, as a result of what seems to be a frivolous ADA lawsuit regarding the great habitat built for them in the '90s.\n3.  Awful *AWFUL* food.  Last time I was at the Zoo, there was at least a semblance of decent, healthy food.  This time around, at least when we tried to get food (around 3), well just think luke-warm burgers and hot dogs.  Get food before or after the zoo.  They need to take a hint from the dining experience at the SF Academy of Sciences.\n4.  Lack of visible keepers/docents.  Other than the penguin and raptor keepers, I don't believe I saw a single other docent or keeper interacting with the public.  A little interaction goes a long way in building support for animal conservation.  I know they still do a lot of school outreach programs, so kudos to them for that.\n5.  Large parts of the zoo were fenced off.  Not sure what the deal with that was, they may just be renovating the area where the african animals used to be, but have no idea since there were no informative signs.\n6.  Lack of information displays.  While many of the new or renovated habitats had great displays with information on the animals and their conservation status, there were a lot of animals that seemed to get little attention.  It felt tragic that here we'd have these animals in captivity, under the guise of conservation and education, but for their to be so little effort to educate the public about them.\n7.  What's the deal with the tiny concrete pool for the Grey Seal?", "author": "Kevin O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-11", "description": "Unfair parking charges - There is AMPLE parking in this area, and nothing else of significance to see in this part of the city. They should/could slightly increase membership rates to include free or deeply discounted parking, or offer a premium membership which includes free parking. This is just a rip-off, plain and simple. Given toddler's nap schedules and limited energy, it is not a good use of time to walk the extra distance to the street parking. I feel extorted every time, and wonder why the hell I have a membership anyway.\n\nNot pedestrian friendly - The maps indicate lots of paths available which appear shorter, but I consistently encounter \"authorized personnel only\" signs. Why is so much of the zoo closed off? Again, since the zoo is primarily for families, who often have small children, it seems obvious that they should try to reduce the amount of wandering around that people have to do.  I can't describe how many times I got repeatedly frustrated going in circles trying to get somewhere, only to give up and find that I had to walk the long way due to poor signs or closed paths (ex: paths behind the Lion fountain).  The maps have color coded walking paths - why not paint special feet on the asphalt with the different animal footprints so that the real world actually matches the map? Another  suggestion: install one-way exit gates so that people can exit directly from the petting zoo areas or other parts of the zoo onto Sloat.  Again, maybe they don't want to do this because that would reduce the incentive to pay extra for parking.\n\nPhotos Lost - I got a photo taken on the train, which never showed up online. I searched all the images from that day and it's not there. I emailed for assistance and got no response. That block of pictures simply wasn't uploaded. What a disappointment that was!\n\nPhoto ID hassles - I am continuously frustrated when I have to show ID at the gate. It is impossible to carry a toddler, push a twin stroller, have everything in the diaper bag, and have to stop to dig out ID.  I don't want to carry my ID in my pocket for fear of it falling out and getting lost. Sometimes my pants don't even have pockets to make this an option (after all, I just had twins, so my pants options are limited).  What would be so difficult about putting a photo ON the membership card itself?  Or have a scanner so that the person at the kiosk can swipe/scan the card and have the family photo appear?  It just sends the wrong message, implying that I DON'T belong, and I am NOT valued.. I certainly don't feel welcomed when I have to dig out ID.\n\nPoor food options - overpriced and terrible food, especially for toddlers. They need healthier options and some better vegetarian options would be nice too. The burrito place is horrifically slow and expensive.\n\nThe exhibits are run down and depressing, as others have said. The penguins really smell bad. \n\nTo add insult to injury - I attempted to contact the membership office over a month ago with this feedback, and received ZERO response. Not even a form letter. They clearly have no interest in hearing feedback or making improvements. I wouldn't be sad if this zoo just closes one day - it's not worth our community support, at least not until their attitude changes.\n\nPlusses: the playground, the petting farm though it's still unnecessarily indirect to walk there).", "author": "Lester N."}

There was plenty of parking available, way better than visiting on a free day due to the lack of parking spaces and large crowds. It has been around 2 years since our last visit and have noticed some improvements and changes here and there.  \nThe gift shop looks like it has been expanded and there is plenty of goodies to choose from, but most items were too expensive for my taste. \nThe giraffe exhibit is by far the best. It's nice how they have a variety of animals in the exhibit instead of just one. The most depressing of the exhibits is the lion, tiger, rhino and bears.  They are too small, dirty looking, and looks more like a prison than a natural habitat.  The chimp exhibit looks more like a jungle gym for small children - terrible!

The only thing that I didnt really like is they close at 5:00 and we went to the family petting zoo around 4:30 and they wouldnt let us in. was looking for more but overall it was an okay time.", "author": "joo l."}

This zoo used to really be a place my kid loved. We used to get a family annual pass which was only $60, so we went a lot.  We had our routine see the monkeys and then spend a good half hour in the petting zoo. Anyone who's been here knows those sheep get kinda frisky when they see you put a quarter in the feed vending machine. They had a great exhibit once, where for a couple of bucks they would give you a cup of nectar and set you into this great enclosure where all these parakeets would land on your arm to drink it.  It was always a great way to spend a nice day and eat a crappy overpriced hot dog. I miss those days. My heart goes out to everyone who was part of recent horrible tragedy. I miss you zoo and all the good times we had there.", "author": "Catherine D."}

The Zoo in Philadelphia is like 100 times better. 2 stars for free day, close free parking , brown bear sisters, cheap prices(although maybe they should increase so more money will go to the animals habitats, food, etc.......). I have an obsession with Hippos, if you are every in New Jersey you must go to their Aquarium and you too may develop a love for them. The habitat they are provided with at the SF zoo is sickening, they have cement and a pool of dirty water. It is absolutely disgusting, and I vow that when I become rich I will sponsor their habitat. It is like a torture chamber and is a sorry excuse for a home, I challenge any employee at the zoo to live like that for a week. The pool is so small the hippo cant even swim, it can only emerge itself in the dirty water. Maybe I should have been a zoo keeper, or maybe i should be( note to self )............anyway..........the lone tiger in the first habitat by the bears looks extremely malnourished, I have never seen a tiger so skinny. The brown bear sisters are extremely cute though, they were play fighting in the water on their hind legs the last time I was there, it was adorable. They are trying, but not hard enough, this zoo is more like a jail, and it isn't right. I love to see animals, but not see them suffering, they all look sad. Hopefully one day I can make a difference........yay aspirations", "author": "Lorain C."}

Yes, it is true that here are some area's where there were very nice zoo volunteers/employees telling us about the birds or grizzly bears, but then when the train wasn't coming and we were trying to find somebody to ask about it, there was nobody in sight.  The guy working in the snack shack was pretending he didn't see us while refilling the french fries, though I'm sure he knows nothing about the train anyways....\n    So about the train.  After watching \"little puffer\" the train  videos on you tube AND calling the zoo beforehand to make sure the train was running (i'm told it is), we arrive at the zoo and buy tickets for the the train.  We are told it opens at 11 or 11:30.  We wait....and wait.... and wait.... no employees, and the ones we find know nothing.   Finally we are told little puffer is not running, a mechanical problem.   Okay fine, these things happen.   Well, my 2 year old is basically at the zoo to go on little puffer and has been talking about it ALL DAY.  No apology, no sending somebody over to the train area to let people know it's not running... When I go to get a refund for my tickets on my way out, I am berated for not having the receipt... WHat?? I have the tickets.   You should be giving me free train tickets for sitting around waiting for little puffer for an hour and disappointing my son.   Shame on you SF ZOO.   I won't be back.", "author": "Lindsay P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-26", "description": "I love animals - and I love going to the zoo - but it's the small exhibits or the exhibits with fewer visitors that make me feel bad. The Grizzly Gulch exhibit is cool - but why is 1/2 the exhibit sectioned off from the bears? It makes it look like they have all this room when really they don't at all. I always think to myself  - that's not natural for them, but then I remind myself most of these animals were abandoned or grew up in a zoo so they are probably better off than their prior situation. Anyway  - this being said the SF Zoo has some great areas.  There are also some areas that are hard to find.   It's not like this park is huge - but signage is not clear. Also - while I'm an adult - I think it's silly they charge you to get in the park and if you want to ride the train you have to pay again. Food - not so good - think cafeteria food from High School. All in all we had a great day - but the zoo does need work in some areas. Also - if your not from SF - may I suggest you bring a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt and not wear flip flops and shorts. SF does not get all that hot especially during the typical summer months- and this zoo is right by  Ocean Beach.  Once the fog rolls in - that's it... COLD - so be prepared (best weather months in SF are September-October). They have lockers at the zoo you can use to store your extras and if parking stinks - take the bus it drops you right in front of the park and only costs $1.50!", "author": "J S."}

I heard it was the best back in the days.The first time I went I was probably 16 or maybe graduated from high school. Not too long ago.. prob 4-5 years since my first visit. Still it was pretty exciting for me but it wasn't what I expected. Prob cuz I wasn't a little kid. And we went on a free day which is when all the little children of the city come .. babies.. elementary kids... yeah. Pretty crowded. Kids running everywhere. Kids screaming trying to run for their lives away from the peacocks that were chasing them.... which is really really really funny to see/watch if you ask me. Almost more interesting than just viewing all the other animals [...such as the sad polar bears on the rocks or whatever sitting there in boredom ....and such as. haha]. Kids all up in my space when I wanted to go see an animal. \n\nThere were also some closed exhibits which kinda sucked. But I actually don't know about how that is right now cuz... uhh the last time i went was more than a year and a half ago. =/\n\nSo yeah, if you decide to go here.. don't come on a free day. \nBring a bag of food to eat or eat before because the prices of the food here are just too much and the food isn't even all that great.\nOoo... and you get a residents discount if you're from here and you show your I.D. .. or a student discount. I forget how much though.\n\nIf you find yourself bored after and have nothing at all to do .. walk the beach towards the cliff house!! =) teehee", "author": "Mila B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-01-09", "description": "This zoo was blah to say the least.  One of the better things is that the zoo is easy to get to, and I didn't find parking to be a problem, plus it's only $5 to park in the lot.  One of the exhibits had tree branches with these dried up leaves and it was just obviously so old, while others had nice green ones.  There were also empty exhibit spaces with overgrown plants, and areas that were pretty dirty and unkept.  It was cute to see them peacocks walking around, though the staff should get people out there cleaning the walking grounds cuz them peacocks were eating dropped french fries and other foods they shouldn't have been eating.  Take caution around the Lemur cafe, there are some seagulls outside the cafe that won't hesitate to literally get in your face.

I think money constraints must have hit it over the last few years.

From insects to large mammals to botanical treasures to most any thing you'd see at any zoo, you'll find it at the SF Zoo but I wouldn't rate it as my favorite zoo.

While it was hardly one of the first spots I hit , the zoo was well worth the anticipation. Perhaps the fact that the weather was seriously agreeable when I visited has a lot to do with my experience .\nThe facilities are  conveniently located. I think thats critical to a pleasant day out. Also there are plenty of maps etc, not that they would help me much if I were alone. I not so good with maps you see......I am working on it .For now I am a GPS kinda gal.\nThere is a nice gift store, very cute place . Its nice to be able to buy things for other people's kids till one has one's own. Also they have good programs for kids and campers , I mean in theoretically anyways, as I haven't tried either. When I do I shall yelp \nThe Polar bears look so unhappy though. That was a downside. In general the experience has a melancholy undercurrent , 'cuz one is essentially visiting prisoners. I try not to dwell on it. \nI am going back there as soon as I can. There is much to be discovered. When you go there please give out a positive vibe the animals need it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-15", "description": "I just think zoos are very sad places.  The vast majority of animals barely move.  They are living way outside their natural habitats and many have health and reproductive problems.  The San Francisco zoo is no different.  It's so funny to think about how much enjoyment the zoo brings as a child, but as you get older, you simply have no interest whatsoever in seeing animals locked up in small prisons.  As stupid as it sounds, one need only watch the old planet of the apes movie to see the absurdity of the modern zoo ideology.  We should be encouraging the restoration of natural animal habitat as a means of enjoying wild animals, not paying $10 to see a locked up tiger.  I know I probably sound like some crazy animal rights activist.  I'm not.  I just don't like seeing animals locked up in cages or small artificial cement pens.  Not my idea of the wild.  Don't get me wrong.  The SF zoo does have several more natural settings for the animals.  And I suspect most zoos are moving more in that direction.  Still, I think all zoos should be closed and the resources spent on other means of seeing animals in their wild habitat.", "author": "AMY Y."}
