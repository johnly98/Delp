I always struggled with this and just wanted to put (  *   )  (   *  ) or 8====D because it's a universal attention grabber, no?\n\nUnlike my math courses, this stuck with me...all the way to Yelp. \n\nIt's been nearly two months since my friends and I went to Sorrel for dinner and writing a review has been tough. We had an underwhelming experience and there's no attention grabber that comes to mind so here it is...\n\nSorrel is a pop-up turned brick and mortar in the former Nico space. They serve Californian cuisine using seasonal and local ingredients.  Beer, wine, and low abv cocktails only. \n\nJust days before our dinner, we noticed a bunch of mixed reviews for Sorrel and was worried. Unfortunately, we went on one of Sorrel's off nights (my friend who's been to their pop-up said, the food was much better there). While nothing was bad, it was underwhelming. \n\nOUR ORDER:\n* Sourdough Focaccia w/ bagna cauda, herbs ($8 +$4): 3.5 STARS\nhttps://bit.ly/2Qv0XQj\nRead rave reviews for this and it was just ok. The bread was hot, fluffy, and lightly sour but worth $8? That's debatable. The bagna cauda (anchovy & garlic) was zesty and pungent, in a good way. \n\n* Chilled Pea Soup w/ parmigiano, crouton, thyme oil ($10):  3.5 STARS\nhttps://bit.ly/2NfnqCS\nI love pea soup and this chilled rendition was good for a warm summer night. Just wish there was more body, as it was on the watery side. But, I loved the presentation and the crouton for crunch.\n\n* Lamb Tartare w/ nuts and seeds, white anchovy, cured egg ($17): 4 STARS\n https://bit.ly/2p5FKA0\nGood marbling, tender, and great textures with the nuts and seeds. The white anchovy added a nice, subtle umami. \n\n* Foie Gras Parfait w/ rhubarb, lavender, brioche ($24): 4 STARS\n https://bit.ly/2OkW7Uh\nDeliciously rich, custardy texture. Full of indulgent foie gras flavor but the name is misleading as it's more a br\u00fbl\u00e9e with its caramelized sugar crust exterior.\n\n* Gnocchi w/ sweet corn, chanterelle, fonduta ($23): 4 STARS\nhttps://bit.ly/2NLGY1h\nI had this same dish the week prior at Pearl and this rendition was so much better. A well-balanced dish - the sweet corn and earthy chanterelles were the perfect complement to the soft, fluffy gnocchi. The chef is from Quince so the pastas seem to be your best bet here. \n\n* Wagyu Zubaton w/ summer squash, cherry tomato, pole bean, pea tendril ($46): 3 STARS\n https://bit.ly/2x9hxNs\nWhile overcooked to our liking, the wagyu zabaton's marbling kept it very moist and tender. Sadly, the sauce killed this dish for us. It masked the rich, beefy flavor of the wagyu. When I order a high-quality cut of steak, I prefer it simply seasoned and served naked.\n\n* Dry Aged Duck w/ hakurei turnip, spring onion, balaton cherry, bronte pistachio ($42 x 2): 2 STARS\nhttps://bit.ly/2xoq12X\nThe biggest disappointment of the night...the Dry Aged Duck For Two is what we came for but they only had it as a serving for one so we ordered two orders. Both orders had flabby skin, not the crisp, caramelized skin we've been drooling over online for months. One order was well-done and one was medium, we were expecting a perfect pink throughout. The manager was kind enough to comp the well-done order. \n\n* Buckwheat Ice Cream w/ olive oil, almond praline, puffed grains ($13): 3 STARS\n https://bit.ly/2NIaDs5\nThis was more of a dessert bar with a popcorn topping, than a fancy ice cream sundae that I was anticipating. \n\n* Strawberries & Rhubarb w/ elderflower cream, white chocolate, black pepper (Comped, regularly $13): 4 STARS\nhttps://bit.ly/2pe352J\nDessert took longer than anticipated, so this was provided to us on the house. The mini strawberries were so ripe and sweet which a nice contrast to the tart rhubard. This elevated take on shaved ice and cream was a light and refreshing way to end a meal.  \n\nWhile the food was underwhelming, service did make up for it. Despite being spread very thin, our server, Kyle rocked. He was upbeat, friendly, and did his best to make sure we were taken care of. Since we went on an off night, the pacing of the courses were off. We quickly received our apps and mains but there was a 30 minute lag on dessert. Luckily, we had early reservations and missed most of the timing issues, unlike the poor table next to us.\n\nMinimalist, contemporary atmosphere with rustic touches (lighting fixture). I've been here when it was Nico and I remember it being deafening and stuffy, but having early dinner reservations, we avoided having to shout across the table. Air circulation has also improved. If you're looking for quiet date night, definitely go for their first seating, on a weeknight.\n\nStreet parking is easy; this is one of the few areas in SF where street parking is rarely problematic. \n\nOverall, the food was 3-3.5 stars but rounding up because of the service and company.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

So glad to have tried it (and share this review, of course!)\n\nI had Sorrel on my bookmarks for a while now, as was on the hot new restaurants to look out for, thanks to the chef (young, kudos) who was at Quince and started his own establishment (never been to Quince, but heard its amazing from some fellow diners at Sorrel). Well maybe was, since their a-list chef has transferred his efforts to this place! \n\nWe made reservations for two, and booked a 9pm as slots were filled up for the week. No biggie, called the restaurant and the front hostess was happy to have us sit at the communal table, until our table was ready. Showed up, greeted and was told that our table was ready - score! \n\nThe server was kind, soft spoken and not pushy at all -- didn't need to come back every min and annoy us like some of these (semi-bouji) places do. Were recommended to try a couple from the menu option tiers, and went with a mix of appetizers, pastas and proteins. Homegirl here was about to go in on the carbs, its a Tuesday a-yo! The wine choice was spectacular, but I'll give my date that cred. \n\nThe food came in a good timely manner and was a-mazing. I said that up there as well. But it was AWESOME. The gnocchi we had first, amaze-gnocchi balls. Also had the squash (SO freaking good, what the helk, did they dehyrdrate and hydrate this magic squash into some magical dish?) The sea scallops, salmon, another pasta, spectacular. \n\nWe even finished off with dessert, a raspberry tart concoction. This place is really wonderful and the vibe is so quaint and trendy, without being annoying. Great job chef, team, house. Will be back!", "author": "Mahsa T."}

Basically I got to try the whole menu at Sorrel, save for a handful of items, and I honestly liked everything I had here!\n\nNotable dishes:\nBagna Cauda & Herbs - Even if you aren't an anchovy fan, I would suggest getting this if you order the bread. So much amazing umami.\n\nTuna Crudo - We almost skipped this dish because tuna crudo is everywhere. Maybe it was the super seasonal tomatoes or the shiso, but their crudo was surprisingly standout.\n\nFoie Gras Parfait - Decadent, but mild flavored foie with a caramelized lavender sugar topping. This was reminiscent of savory creme brulee.\n\nA5 Wagyu Tartare - Tartare is another dish that's everywhere and usually underwhelming. The sesame fennel crisp added such a nice dimension and burst of flavor. This may be the first tartare I enjoyed!\n\nCicatelli - You can't wrong with artichoke, guanciale, buffalo milk ricotta, AND black truffle with pasta. This was my favorite of the pasta dishes.\n\nGnocchi - Another killer combo with sweet corn, chanterelle, chive, and fonduta. The gnocchi was fluffy, yet had the right amount of chew.\n\nScialatielli - I especially loved the texture of this flat, sheet-like pasta. The lamb and olive were an intense, but complimentary flavor punch. \n\nWagyu Zabuton - Wagyu is often cooked poorly, ruining a great cut of meat. This was well-executed and let the fatty goodness shine.\n\nBuckwheat Ice Cream - The presentation was cute with puffed grains that looked like mini popcorn. The buckwheat and olive were a nice savory accompaniment to the almond praline base.\n\nRaspberry Passionfruit Tart - Nothing crazy, just a really good fruit tart!!\n\nService was quite jovial, though timing wasn't the best. Dessert took about 30 minutes to come out. Plates took a while to be cleared as well.\n\nI was worried about the noise level mentioned in other reviews - it was definitely loud, but still bearable for my high sensitive personality. The five bottles of wine probably helped as well!", "author": "Adrienne H."}

Orecchiette - the sausage was so tasty. Also very savory. Brightness from the tomato sauce, loved it!\n\n3. Duck - presentation was so fun, they brought the duck out prior to carving it, then bring out two plates of perfectly plated duck breast. Beautiful skin, delicious jus, yum.\n\n4. SALMON - Wow, this dish is a showstopper. Wouldn't expect this from a salmon dish, but this was the best salmon dish I've ever had. Just get it.\n\n5 - FOCACCIA OMG. \n\nHonorable mentions: borage (very oily but addictive), crudo (really pretty but such a tiny portion)\n\nWe tried other dishes too and most were good, but we really were not impressed by the crab risotto.

Get the foccacia with bagna cauda. \n\n*********************************************************************************\nAmbiance -  Beautiful interior with nice flower arrangements (yellow roses) and live plants on the ceiling, and a live (?) tree in the dining area.  Dark and a little loud.  The bar had a black-and-white marble counter that was really nice.   The seating is small and crowded.  Sitting at one of the two-tops was basically like being on an airline.

Would order this again\n\n* 2 / 5 Strawberry and Rhubarb dessert soup - kind of strange.  \n\nService:  4 / 5 stars.  Complementary sparkling water.  They also gave us bubbles when our table wasn't ready on time.  This happens ALL THE TIME in the SF, and restaurants are rarely apologetic for it.  I thought this was very nice.

But after carefully reading the Eater article and other reviews, we selected some dishes that we really loved! \n\n-Sourdough focaccia with bagna cuada. I loved the bagna cuada and thought the bread was alright. My fiance loved the bread though\n\n-Yellow tomato soup. This was recommended to us by our waitress. I'm glad we got it! It was very tasty\n\n-Trofie. Very very rich but a bit undersalted in my opinion. The pasta texture was good.\n\n-Dry aged duck for two. SO MUCH duck. Flavors on the skin were really good. Duck was tender and soft. Turnips and sides were tasty.\n\n-Buckwheat ice cream. Like an ice cream cake with little popcorn on top. Loved it.\n\nAmbiance: not sure if it was because were were dining at 6p or if it's just the location, but we felt much younger than the crowd (we are 30). There was also no diversity which made me feel a tad out of place. But the chef is part Asian (and only 28), right? So there's that!", "author": "T D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-23", "description": "So. Much. Salt.  The food might have actually been stellar, it certainly *looked* amazing, but you would never know because it was so heavily over-salted that the only flavor anything had was salt and more salt.  I'm not being hyperbolic when I say I had a litre of water while there, and at least that much when I got home.\n\nWe started with the crudo and the sourdough focaccia with the bagna cauda.  They brought the bread first.  This was probably the best part of the meal, albeit the bread was salty, too. (The top was dusted, nearly crusted, with flaky salt.) Also, after the robust flavors of the bagna cauda (garlic, anchovy) one's palate is a little blown for the subtle flavors of the crudo.  Which, again, I would imagine would be really lovely had it not been so salty.\n\nI was surprised to read that pasta was the chef's specialty because they were the most disappointing dishes of the night.  The gnocchi was dense, heavy and gummy.  The cicatelli was overly chewy, not al dente but really working-your-jaw chewy.  Needless to say we didn't finish either dish.  (Of note, our servers, of which there was a parade, never asked if we liked any of the dishes or why we might have left them unfinished.)\n\nThe salmon dish had promise, and was edible, IF you had the salmon with the tomatoes and mushrooms.  Otherwise, and I sound like a broken record here, the fish itself was so salty, almost as if it had been brined.\n\nOur final dish was the stuffed squash blossoms.  Horrible.  What looked like beautiful stuffed blossoms in a delicate tempura-like batter was in reality overly salty, (you see the theme here?) goat cheese trapped in a stale, hard, crunchy coating.  Not crispy, but crack-a-tooth crunchy and stick to your molars.  Basically inedible.  \n\nService - meh.  It started off fairly well, but then we were told our original server had to go home due to \"personal issues\" and after that we had so many different people bringing dishes, whisking away plates, etc. that we were left with the impression that no one cared.  Repeating my earlier comment - we were never asked what we thought of any of the food.  Even when the squash blossom dish was left with only two bites out of it, nothing.\n\nWine - nothing to write home about, as the saying goes.  Nothing interesting, but not bad.  Rather pricey, with bottles (about 3 per category) ranging from $60 - $200.  The server that brought our wine, a decent Falanghina, seemed taken aback that we wanted it to remain chilled.  Which considering the initial 2 ounce pour, shouldn't have been a surprise.\n\nDessert - we couldn't be enticed, both for the fear that it, too, would also somehow be incredibly salty, and that nothing really seemed to spark interest.\n\nI'm hoping this was just an off night, both in terms of food and service.  But, that being said, at that price point (about $150 per person, before tip) I wouldn't be willing to give them another try any time soon.", "author": "darla s."}

Whenever a new dish was served, someone would come to explain all the ingredients in the dish. They were also extremely attentive as my glass of water never went empty and I never had to wave them down for anything. \n\nTo start of, the best dishes of the night were the maine diver scallop and the frozen strawberry torte.  The scallop was perfectly cooked and the dish was pretty interesting, as it had a bunch of different elements that all played along with each other really well.  I would have never thought to serve scallops with squash, but it worked!  The frozen strawberry torte was also delicious (but nothing too original though), as it was basically phyllo dough with strawberry ice cream in the center.  I love ice cream so this was a plus for me.\n\nBut what really brought down my meal was the tarjarin and the liberty farm duck were lacking. For the duck dish, parts of the meat were overcooked, but the worst part was that the duck fat was not rendered enough so the fat ended up being chewy and the skin was very rubbery.  My boyfriend's duck was cooked a bit better but it still had some of the same issues. The cook on the spigarello also was not consistent, so I got a piece that was way overly charred which made it basically inedible. The tarjarin (which was basically pasta with lamb neck) seemed a bit uninspired, as I felt it was something that I could have made; other than thought it was a good dish.\n\nI would definitely not recommend this place for a date, special occasion or to bring anyone elderly as it was EXTREMELY LOUD. At some points in the night, I was screaming to still be misheard by someone sitting right in front to me. I'm not sure if it's always like this, but it was very off putting.  However, I would definitely recommend this place though if you want to have a dinner party without the stress of cooking.

We were in the area for milk tea and decided to stay for dinner before the drive back. \n\nIt's in a more residential area, slightly off of the main streets, by a block or so. It has large windows and the interior has this modern and yet industrial look to it too. It feels elegant and chic at the same time. We didn't have a reservation but got seated straight away at the bar. It's the only low seating area there whereas the rest of the bar area has tall chairs. The rest of the place is regular seating by the sides. There's a long wood dinning table in the center for larger groups.\n\nThe service is wonderful despite having been seated at a corner spot. Both waitstaff and bartender were checking in on us as we conversed. \n\nWe got the aged duck for two and asparagus as an appetizer to share. The place was packed soon enough. The dishes did take awhile to come to fruition but it's all worth it. The asparagus dish has a bunch of different flavors mixed together.  They've actually presented the duck for us before they cut it up in the back. And it's so juicy. I would say that it's one of the better ones, probably only second to Peking duck in Beijing.\n\nOh the dessert was good too. It was fresh strawberry on frozen strawberry.

We ordered the sourdough focaccia to start, and it was fluffy and soft. We had the lamb tartare, ahi crudo, and borage as appetizers. The ahi crudo was citrusy, fresh, and tasty. I was pleasantly surprised to find chunks of fresh grapefruit in the crudo. For pasta, we tried the crab risotto, gnochetti, orecchiette, and tortellini. I was very underwhelmed by the crab risotto, but the gnochetti was my absolute favorite dish of the night. It was creamy, full of mushrooms, and the perfect texture for gnocchi. Yum! We also got the salmon and aged duck breast as well, which were tasty. For dessert we had the brown butter mousse which I really enjoyed- it was light but still with enough flavor. It felt like every bite of the mousse had something different- sourdough ice cream or shortbread cookie, and it was a unique and perfect end to the meal. The amount of food we ordered was perfect for 5. \n\nThe service was wonderful as well. All of our servers were very knowledgeable about how the food was prepared and what it was, and they were all friendly. The ambience is nice, with very mood lighting and beautiful plants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-20", "description": "What an interesting dining experience! Sorrel is a pop-up that happens once a week on Saturday in a dining room/kitchen in the Mission. When we arrived at 6pm for our reservation, there was already a huge crowd of people waiting outside, as everyone is seated and served all at once. The menu every week is preset, and you can also order the wine pairing that goes along with it.\n\nFor our dinner, every table was started with a bowl of smoked paprika and rosemary popcorn, which was nice for snacking. We were then started with a complimentary chilled corn and basil soup with saffron, and the soup was creamy and deep with rich flavor. Our first course, the halibut crudo with olive, daikon, and vinaigrette was plated beautifully, but the flavors were a little lacking, and one of the halibut pieces on my plate was quite stringy and tough. The next course, the ricotta dumplings with Italian broccoli, whey and corn water, and summer truffle was delicious--the dumplings were light, creamy, and crumbly all at the same time--kind of like gnocchi, but with a drier, less chewy texture.\n\nAnd then came the main course--main lobster tail (yes, it was spelled \"main\" on the menu and not \"Maine\") with black lentils, crispy new potatoes, and garnished with fresh herbs on top. Again, the plating of the dish was delicious, but I didn't find the flavors particularly remarkable or memorable. Dessert turned out to be one of my favorite courses--it was a creative take on peaches and cream with a delicious, warm peach compote with walnuts, topped with a puff pastry dumpling, and drizzled with a steaming hot cream that brought everything together. The depth and combination of spices in this dish was so creative and worked surprisingly well--the textural contrast of the soft peaches, the crunchy walnuts, the crispy puff pastry, and the soupy, warm cream was simply perfect.\n\nOverall, not a bad experience, but the service ended up being way behind schedule (we were still sitting around and paying while the next seating was ready to come in), and though the plates were beautifully decorated, the flavors of the dishes could have used some refinement. That being said, however, I thought the tasting menu was way overpriced for the portions we got, and Sorrel didn't leave me with a particularly lasting impression.", "author": "David K."}

My bf and I started off with the focaccia bread and foie gras parfait. The bread was good, and very filling. However, I'm a little baffled that I had to pay for that AND the butter to go with it and would not pay for it again; most places like this have it as a complementary item. The foie gras was tasty but it seemed like they just plopped it out of the can and caramelized the top with sugar, creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e style and just threw on some dressings. We shared 3 dishes: the Bigoli Carbonara, the Orecchiette, and the Striped Bass. All three dishes were underwhelming and I felt that given it's price point, there was nothing special to note for any of them. We actually sent the carbonara back because we both felt the pasta was a little too al dente (and a tad too peppery for my taste). We skipped on dessert because nothing was notable or remotely interesting. Because we were celebrating a birthday, they were nice enough to give us a small cup with some ice cream in it and a candle.\n\nThe service was okay, a little bit questionable at times, but I can understand that the restaurant is quite new and people are trying to get into the groove of things. The ambiance was quite loud. We were sitting at the front too, and I still had a hard time hearing if he wasn't projecting his voice at me. \n\nI was hoping for some semblance of culinary fine dining given the head chef's pedigree but I felt the entire experience was a let down. The food, the service and the ambiance was nothing like I thought it'd be. Because the restaurant has a more neighborhood feel I understand the less than attentive service and a noisy dining room, but I still expect good food. I am sad to say the this restaurant did not live up to any expectations and I don't think it's worth it to visit here. I definitely will not be coming back.", "author": "Thuy T."}

First off, the wait time when you have a reservation - I make a reservation so I don't have to wait 20 minutes, this also starts the whole experience with a bad taste in my mouth.  Second of all, $35 corkage is outrageous - I could maybe understand $25-30 even though I believe that is also on the high side or if you had an extensive wine list you were encouraging people to try, but I saw nothing of the sort.  Third, the suggestion by of waitress with zero personality of 2-3 dishes per person is insane - if my husband and I had ordered that much, it would have been way too much.  And lastly, while the food is good, I will give you that, it is not worth the prices you have to pay for them.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-30", "description": "First, let me say that it is great to see new neighborhood restaurants.  We live two blocks from Sorrell and our go-to restaurants have always been Spruce and Garibaldi's.  I was hoping that Sorrell could be added to the list, and it has some of the ingredients for being a contender, but there are a few letdowns that mar the experience.\n\nFood (7/10): The food is actually quite enjoyable, with good presentation and generally good flavors. There were a couple of standout dishes (including the Scorza di Fagioli - a delicious pasta with ramp, lemon, and beans - and the Orecchiette - with pork sausage sugo and some calabrian chili). The bread was good, but you had to pay for both the bread and the choice of butter or a bagna cauda individually (yikes! Most restaurants actually give you bread as part of the meal, or don't separately charge for the bread and the butter/condiments). Main disappointment generally with the food was that I felt they were sometimes trying to do too much and drowning out some of the flavors with others. It worked sometimes, and sometimes was just too much of a mess.\n\nAmbiance (6/10): I liked the decor, with the large plant in the middle and the main \"chandeliers\" topped with plants and suspending large Edison bulbs. The restaurant has a warm feel but may also be a little dark. However, the noise level was off the charts. We had a dinner reservation at 8:30pm and it was extremely loud when we arrived and stayed that way for quite a bit. It was almost challenging to have a conversation with the others in our party. Also, it as a little hot and stuffy, and they had propped the door open so it was a mix of cold and hot at the same time (we were seated at one of the long tables close to the door).\n\nService (5/10): This is where the newness of the restaurant really shows. The service there was alright, but would have been nice if the servers were more attentive overall. I won't go into the details, but it did not feel like these folks had their act fully together at the front of house (reservations, hosting), and while we enjoyed our overall experience at the restaurant, the folks there don't seem to care to build a local roster of recurring diners.\n\nOverall verdict: 6/10 or 3/5 or whatever you want to call it. There's definitely room for improvement in all of the major areas, but there are some good ideas and execution in the food. It's a shame that we won't be adding this to our rotation of local restaurants to eat at, as the experience falls far short of its predecessor (Nico) and the service is too much of a shortfall at this price point.", "author": "Nicholas T."}

Apparently they spend 24 hours making it, which explains why it's special.\nThen came a few oysters, which had an interesting kick to them - much more experimental than normal oysters, which seems to be this place's MO. You won't find this type of flavor in dishes anywhere else. \nWe tried several pasta dishes, which is the specialty of the head chef, and it shows. They melt in your mouth and the sauces make you want to lick the bowl. \nWe finished off with top notch wagyu, Cooked to perfection, and the dry aged duck, which was my girlfriend's favorite. \nI'm very excited for the menu to keep growing, as what they are doing with food is special!\n\nAmbiance/service: 4.5/5\nOnly because I want everyone to know how good the food is will I knock this down a little.

Taste-wise, the duck was deeply satisfying.\n\nNot sure what the \"authentic & vibrant Italian influences\" (according to their website) mean. Sourdough Focaccia, Yellow Tomato Soup and Tuna Crudo came out all together. Probably as antipasti. Sourdough Focaccia (with cultured butter and sorrel) was a cultural shock. We have only been to some parts of Italy. Still, never experienced a focaccia so soft and fatty. Probably better with bagna cauda. Cicatelli was sophisticated. But a hearty pasta like Cicatelli is more satisfying with a \"simple\" ragout style sauce - a deeply complex sauce made with relatively few ingredients that requires hours to cook. \n\nThey spiced up the interior. Maybe a little too much (our memory of Nico is still fresh). The music was too loud for the ambiance. But the manager - the young gentleman in green polo - made a few dance moves (in the kitchen area) to the music, which was absolutely cool. Our server had a little accident at the bar as we were waiting to be seated. Yet she kept her cool. She let both of us try the wine, which felt modern.\n\nSorrel is a job well-done, but not fully formed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-04", "description": "We grabbed a last minute reservation so we were totally excited to visit Sorrel since the reviews have been excellent.  The restaurant is in the old Nico space on Sacramento so its a nice dining ambiance with an open kitchen.  We sat fairly close to the bar so we didn't get a chance to watch the kitchen in action.  The noise level was high but not any higher than any other popular restaurant in SF.  If you want quiet in SF you will need to go somewhere that is unpopular!\n\nWe started with oysters - tip to the restaurant - serving them on lava rocks looks nice, but raw oysters served warm with sorrel ice to cool them is a really off putting experience.  Oysters need to be cold. \n\nWe then moved on to some mains after some good appetizers.  I ordered the Black Ceci - \"black chick pea flour based fritters with some seasonal corn and eggplant\" - Sounded great until I realized I had ordered falafels.  Tell me they are a riff on falafels.  Don't let me figure out afterwards after describing them with restaurant language.  \n\nMy wife ordered black cod with forbidden rice and coconut milk.  The black cod was poached beautifully except it had been soaked in a sugar sweet coconut sauce.  I don't think I have ever tasted sweet blakc cod or sweet fish for that matter,  Still not sure how I feel about it to be honest,  It definitely wasn't good to my taste buds,  \n\nI don't think I would have given them such a low score except for the service.  Our wine came out after the first food hit the table, the wine (white) came out too warm and the solution was to put it in a marble carafe with no ice or cooling water - another tip, cool air around a bottle doesn't affect the temperature of a bottle only contact does,  The seemed to be enough staff on the floor but they all seemed to be running round and not attentive to tables and more specifically our table.  I think this is an overall comment on the number of restaurants that are opening in SF born out of pop-ups.  A great restaurant experience and as a result a great restaurant is more than good food,  It happens when service is good or great.  Having disorganized service no matter what your food tastes like leaves me never going back.  \n\nIn this case the service was poor the food was mediocre and the review was two stars.", "author": "Michael L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-17", "description": "Came here on a Friday night at 6pm for dinner with le bf. I wasn't super impressed with the place. I would give this place 3.5 stars rounded down to a 3 and le bf gives 4 stars. Le bf was tasked with a fun, unique dinner spot that we haven't tried before and he was so excited when he found this place. \n\nThe menu for the night was: (Menu #108)\n1. Rosotti Ranch Veal Tartare (smoked buffalo mozzarella, smoked almond, green coriander)\n2.  English Pea Tortelli (speck, morel mushroom, pecorino)\nBonus: Roasted corn risotto with cherry tomatoes\n3. Wild Alaskan Halibut (red pepper, sweet corn, saffron, chanterelle mushroom)\n4. Brown Butter Cake (smoked coffee caramel, young coconut froyo)\n\nI was extremely skeptical when we pulled up in front of 945 Valencia St. There was no sign, which is understandable, considering it is a pop-up, but some sort of indication would be nice. \n\nWe actually arrived about 10 minutes before 6pm. We were told, not very nicely, that we needed to wait 10 more minutes. That first interaction left a bad taste in my mouth and it didn't help their cause throughout the actual dinner service. Given that they wouldn't let us inside to sit, and there was no place to sit outside the house, we went next door to grab a scoop of ice cream while we waited. When we came back at 6pm, there were at least 10 people scattered outside, on the sidewalk, and on the stairs, waiting to go in. When they still didn't let people in at 6:05pm, I was not a happy panda. I was told to wait another 2 minutes. Finally, they started letting people come in around 6:07. \n\nWe were sat against the wall. Right when I got seated, I noticed that the tables we were sat at were those foldable ones. Ehhhhhh, ok, I guess? The guy, who we would later learn was the general manager, approached us, asked if we had any food allergies, etc. and if we wanted to participate in the wine pairings. I'm not a huge wine person, so we both declined. I later overheard another table ordered just a glass, and I thought to myself that I would enjoy 1 glass. It took another 10 minutes to try to flag down a person to ask if we could order a glass of the rose. We tried to make eye contact with the GM multiple times, but he just didn't seem to notice. Finally, 1 of the co-founders came over and we were both able to place our wine order. \n\nWhile we waited, we had a bowl of rosemary cayenne popcorn that we could munch on. But that only did so much. You would think that when everybody is served the same food, with the exceptions of those with allergies, and when the first dish is a cold dish, you would think that food would come out a lot sooner. Boy was I wrong. It seemed to take forever for the first course to come out. Maybe the kitchen wasn't fully prepped for dinner service. Either way, when this has been your 108th pop up, you would think that the kinks would have been worked out by now. It wasn't. \n\nIn terms of the food, by the end of the meal, both le bf and I were full pandas. So there was enough food to make you full. The taste of the food, was ok.....I think my favorite was the veal tartare. I'm a huge fan of tartare and I thought all the ingredients came together wonderfully. I am not a huge fan of peas in general, but I thought the tortelli was ok. There wasn't a huge pea taste and I thought the mint they added balanced out the flavors well. They bonus dish of the night was the corn risotto. They said it was their gift to us, the customers. The risotto rice was a bit undercooked and not creamy. I made le bf finish my portion after only a bite. I didn't feel like I needed to eat more of it. I enjoyed the meaty chanterelle mushrooms that came with the halibut dish (I'm not a huge mushroom person either). The halibut had a nice sear on it, but I thought that the dish didn't have much flavor overall. I normally complain about dishes having too much salt, but I had to complain about this fish being under seasoned. Le bf said that the flavor came from the sauce at the bottom, but to me, it still didn't have enough flavor. By the time dessert came around, I was pretty much full. I had 1 tiny bite of the brown butter cake. It was eh. I was a fan of the coconut froyo though, so I ate mine and le bf's portion (he isn't a fan of coconut).  \n\nI have no need to come back. I'm sure there are better pop up restaurants in the city that serve better food at a cheaper price point. Le bf also feels no need to come back. It was a cool concept, and we really wanted to love, but the execution was poor. None of the dishes served were outstanding. Everything was very meh.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

Instead of doing the wine pairing, we ended up ordering a bottle of pinot to share.\n\nThe four course meal took about 1.5 hours and the pacing was orchestrated well since the team clearly has experience in turning the tables by 8:30.\n\nWe started with the Ocean Trout Crudo, which came to the table dry but a juice was poured over it to make it into a \"ceviche.\" It was clean, refreshing, and all around delicious.\n\nNext came the Semolina Gnochetti. The lamb flavor was obvious without being overpowering. \n\nThe main course was Smoked Llano Seco Pork Rib. My friend and I disagreed on this. She thought the meat was tender but I felt that it was a bit difficult to pull away from the bone. I love ribs and this was not my favorite.\n\nTo end the meal, we were served a Frozen Strawberry Torte. I enjoyed this very much.

While the menus often look like the main course is meat, they will substitute fish or vegetarian if you ask ahead of time. \n\nThe Saturday night menu started with a sparkling wine and squash \"cappuccino\" which came in a small cup, had the texture of lightly foamed cappuccino, and the taste of a delicious, rich squash soup. The rest of the meal: yellowfin tuna crudo (a beautiful and very healthy array of vegetables and raw tuna), spaghetti ai ricci (an amazing thick pasta al dente with delicious cherry tomatoes, Snake River Farms kobe beef (almost sublime beef, rich in flavor, delicate in texture and a substantial portion), Meyer lemon ricotta torta (puff pastry with a fantastic almond riccotta custard).

The beginning started off a little disoriented with a wait to be seated and getting our snack popcorn, but the staff quickly acknowledged the tiny misstep and turned the night around.\n\nWe were seated in the kitchen where all the action was taking place.  Watching the team prep and plate the food right in front of us, we had the opportunity to listen to the chef explain each dish.  The first two dishes were good, but not outstanding.  The salad was plated beautifully but unfortunately had too much liquid on it.  The excess moisture from the greens (not drained completely after wash, my guess) really affected the taste of the dressing, which I can tell was good, but washed down.\n\nThe next dish was the uni risotto.  As a huge urchin lover, I was so excited about this dish.  The chef described using scallops and whipping Monterey sea urchin and butter into the sauce.  But when I tasted it, other than saltiness, I couldn't really detect sea urchin or scallops.  The portion was kind of small too, leaving so much to be desired.\n\nThe next dish was a surprise dish--- lamb neck ravioli.  It was kept as a secret until we were served.  And it was soooo good!!  The lamb was so mild, devoid of any gaminess, tasting more like grass fed beef.  The sauce was so delicious I could lick the plate clean.  This was not only a surprise but also a hit.\n\nFollowed by the main, red snapper with ramps poured over a champagne/mint fish stock sauce.  This dish was simply divine, showcasing the perfectly pan fried filet in its well balanced sauce in harmony.  It also has a small side of fava beans and peas.  Given my partiality to fava beans, I was loving every bite of it.\n\nOur dessert was a delight, too.  Yummy almond cake with edible flowers poured over a white chocolate sauce, and a scoop of toasted sesame rhubarb sorbetto.  A very satisfying end to our meal.  \n\nOverall a lovely experience.

Although the staff was friendly and professional, it seemed like they were running a little late the night we were there. The  food was definitely uneven. The sommelier, on the other hand, did an excellent job with the wine pairings, especially given the very reasonable price point of $35 for the wine pairings for each of the four courses. \n\nWe were given a bowl of rosemary popcorn to tide us over until most of the guests who had arrived for the 6pm seating were seated and water was poured. We were also given an extra amuse bouche of tombo tuna to start, which was good, but a tad heavy handed on the ginger.\n\nThe first course was \"octopus \u00e0 la plancha\" with legumes, coriander, green garlic, and calabrian chili. The flavors were nice, but unfortunately I received one piece of octopus that was so chewy, I couldn't eat it. The pieces I could eat were good and the chili added a picante flavor. Next up was my favorite dish of the night, the stinging nettle raviolo with porcini, hazelnuts, and beurre noisette. It had a soft cooked egg in the middle and was deliciously rich. \n\nThe main dish was \"colorado rack of lamb and shank\", with smoked potatoes and green garlic-anchovy butter. Luckily the dish was somewhat saved by the wine pairing of a lovely inky Italian chianti that was more like a California sangiovese than other Italian chiantis I have had in the past. Here again, I wonder if the kitchen was behind schedule since both of us thought the lamb, as well as the potatoes, were undercooked. \n\nDessert was acquerello rice pudding coated with chocolate, mascarpone, salted pistachios and dried apple caramel. Not bad, but I didn't feel the need to finish it. The wine pairing was a herb-flavored digestif that after the chianti, was my second favorite wine pairing of the night.", "author": "Sarah F."}

It manages to have a neighborhood restaurant feel with some Michelin quality dishes. I have managed to eat here twice so far and I will be back as much as I can. As many other reviewers have said - the sourdough focaccia is fantastic and must be had with the bagna cauda, herbs. The chilled yellow tomato soup is so flavorful. I've had a lot of tomato soup in my life and this one is unique. The housemade pasta is as good as it gets. We've had the tortelonni verde and the cicatelli and can't wait to try more of their pasta. The pasta is cooked perfectly and is simple but full of flavor. The dry aged duck for two has a very special presentation. It was perfectly cooked and of course great with figs. This is quite a large dish and we ended up taking some home. Was just as good the next day! Our second visit, we had the heritage rack of pork which was just as good as the duck. For dessert, the first time, we ordered the buckwheat ice cream. Seriously, one of the best desserts I have ever had. It's not overly sweet and the textures are perfect. It is so good that we ordered it again on our second visit! Sorrel's plating is well thought out and beautiful. The wait staff is very helpful and friendly - Kyle was excellent. Well done Chef Alexander Hong on creating a special restaurant with some exceptional dishes.", "author": "M S."}

Heard about Chef Alex from a friend that attended his pop-up restaurant in the past, and I was really looking forward to seeing the permanent version.  The atmosphere is great and the restaurant has a fabulous vibe.   Was seated at a communal table and immediately welcomed by my most immediate seatmate. Started the meal with focaccia bread with olive oil and anchovy dip.   Delicious!  The crust was salty and delicious and paired well with the anchovy olive oil.   Tried the Hamachi crudo and it was amazing.    Citrus plays well with the fish.  Next came the chilled pea soup.  It was cold, creamy and couldn't have tasted fresher.  Felt like a summer day.   The Orrechette pasta was amazing and perfectly cooked.   The tomato based sause had the perfect amount of spice and   each bite was perfect.  My daughter had the gnocchi and I should have liked to try it but it was gone before I could get a bite.   She claimed it melted in her mouth.    Absolutely loved the chocolate dessert that reminded me of my childhood.   Had a trip down memory lane as it reminded me of a chocolate moon pie.  Absolutely loved it.

I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner here last Saturday!\nI felt so bad for having to call them 5 minutes before my 6pm reservation time to tell them we're running late. It was due to unexpected heavy traffic (heavier than normal bc someone with a gun was at civic center threatening suicide so cops had streets closed and was negotiating with him). Arrived ten minutes late but was greeted with big smiles. Awwwww so nice!!  :D\n\nThe entire restaurant was filled with maybe 20 guests. Chef Alexander Hong and his staff were introduced before dinner and you could tell they were nice people. Dinner began for everyone at around 6:30pm. There were a couple people who were later than we were.\n\nFOOD- four course menu for $55. Additional $35 for wine pairing. We ordered one glass ea of our own instead. Dishes were all prepared/presented nicely and made of fresh ingredients. I loved each dish and felt really full afterwards. \n**on the house- compressed watermelon and anchovy-truffle toast before the first course. Refreshing and salty, but good\n*artic char crudo- fresh attic char that matched the tomatoes, cucumbers, and green olives so well. Very refreshing, perfect starter that night.\n*smoked eggplant tortelli- delicate tortelli filled with creamy eggplant pur\u00e9e served in sweet corn and melt mozzarella. Gee, I usually don't like stuffed pasta, but this was really good. Don't taste that much eggplant, but it was smoky. Portion size was perfect too.\n*five dot ranch beef cooked in bone marrow- the beef was cooked nicely, maybe just a little too over for me. The potato was crispy and the endive was sweet. Enjoyed all components of this dish\n*black mission fig cake- with dried and fresh figs and served with buttermilk-lavender gelato. The cake was rich but not too sweet. Would love to eat this with coffee.\n\n-SERVICE/STAFF- friendly. I have no complaints (especially since I was late haha). I could tell that everyone works hard and likes what they do. The sommelier also works at Flour & Water and he is great!\n\n-DECOR/AMBIENCE- the space is open and comfortable. Each table was covered with white cloth which feels like a fancier dinner. Noise level not too noisy. A great place for date night!\n\nOverall experience was awesome. I would definitely come back and tell others about Sorrel. It's quality food prepared with care/love and offered at a reasonable price. Only thing is they're only open on Saturdays for now, so best to make reservations in advance!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-19", "description": "I ate dinner here with a friend a few nights ago. The TL;DR is: good but not amazing food, somewhat unpolished service, overall an ok meal but in this price category the city has many stronger players. \nA little more detail: we arrived a few minutes early for our reservation but were still seated over 20 minutes late.  The hostess had a harried, irritable vibe and there was never an apology or even really an acknowledgment that we were inconvenienced.  There isn't really have a bar, so it's not like we could sit and have a drink while we waited, you're basically stuck standing in the crowded entryway.  No one we dealt with seemed anything other than annoyed that we were there. And look, to some extent I'm there for the food and wind and not the feels but also, friendly and welcoming staff are part of what make a restaurant great instead of just ok. \nBy the time we were seated, they were out of like 5 dishes.  It's a very small menu to begin with, so that's substantial reduction in options and to be candid, the remaining options did not look like not the A-team.  The wine list is also very small and not terribly impressive in terms of options.  Every dish that we had was... pretty good.  I mean the thing about San Francisco is that if you're willing to pay $45+ for a very small entr\u00e9e, there are SO MANY places with fantastic food that you could go instead.  And also to that point, be aware that the large plates (the meat and seafood) are basically just a smallish-piece of protein with a garnish, and they don't offer any side dishes, even ala carte.  That was kind of disappointing - we ended up with enough food to be full because we also had pasta and appetizers, but it's more that the meal felt haphazard and incomplete and I have a personal preference to be allowed to have some vegetables or something with my main course.   \nSo, I probably won't be back. Again, not a terrible experience but just a underwhelming and I can name a lot of other places I've enjoyed more. It may be that it will be better in a few months - it was definitely apparent that this was a newer establishment still working out the kinks in its operations.", "author": "Sarie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-25", "description": "This is one of my new favorite restaurants in the city; they just started doing pop-up dinners a few months ago at Picnic on Third, which a sandwich shop during the day in SoMa, on Fridays and Saturdays. There are 2 seatings at night, you have to buy tickets ahead of time online (sometimes the menu is posted ahead of time if it's close enough to the actual date) and the menu constantly rotates with whatever is seasonal. When I went for Valentine's Day weekend (2016), the tickets were about $48 a pop, but the prices have since gone up and are around $59 per person. For the quality of the food, portions, and the experience, it's totally worth it. I would go every week if my wallet could afford it!\n\nAmuse Course - Popcorn! How can you go wrong with flavored popcorn? I liked this a lot! Then there were 3 little cracker bites per person with different kinds of toppings on top.\n\nShaved Brussel Sprout Salad - Delicious and unique; you might think raw brussel sprouts sound gross, but when it's done right, it's really great. There were slices of jamon iberico, and a slice of fresh cheese on the side.\n\nRock Shrimp Gnocchi - I wish the gnocchi had been an entire plateful, it was so delicious. There were only 5 or 6 pieces of gnocchi, but each piece was light, fluffy, fresh, and delightful.\n\nNapa Valley Lamb - I don't usually like lamb, but this was really delicious, cooked on the rarer side with some horseradish sauce. The quality of this meat was excellent. \n\nBittersweet Chocolate Semi-Freddo with Almond Butter - I love anything with dark chocolate, so naturally I loved this dessert. Each bite was heavenly.\n\nI secretly don't want to tell people how great this place is because I want to still be able to get tickets to come here. If you're looking for a great date-night, or a place to celebrate a special occasion, this will be great. Probably best for 2-4 people. They also have a wine pairing for $32 per person (or at least that's what it was in Feb 2016), and it was fantastic. I've told so many of my friends to come here, and will come back here again!

We were welcomed by our server/ wine sommelier, Alex, who promptly seated us and served up a generous bowl of rosemary popcorn. We requested the wine pairing with our courses. \n\nThe first surprise dish was a coconut milk soup. It had a nice consistency and light coconut taste. \nWe were then served a second surprise dish - a miniature toast bite with smoked salmon. \nThe third surprise course was a neatly plated tomato and lettuce salad. It was quite amazing that we had not even started the actual menu courses yet!\n\nThe first course - hamachi with pickled watermelon. The fish was of high grade and the dish was delicious. \nThe second course - beef cheek stuffed in torteloni. This was by far our favorite dish by the end of the night because of the generous servings of beef tongue and the satisfying home-y taste. \nThe third course - the main course, roasted black cod. The cod was very well prepared, but I have to admit that it was foreshadowed by the previous course. \nAnother surprise dish - half baked ginger cookies! They were warm too!\nThe fourth and final course - flor di latte custard. Not too sweet, just perfect. The lime seeds were a very nice addition to the dessert as well! Also this dessert was accompanied by the best wine pairing that I ever had with a dessert (la caudrina, moscato d'asti, Italy). \n\nThroughout the dining experience, Chef Alexander Hong came out to each table and introduced each dish himself!

Highlights were the sourdough focaccia (more sourdough than focaccia) which we got with the bagna cauda, the soft shell crab appetizer and the wagyu entree. The Trofie with pesto genovese was basic and not comparable to the high quality hand made pasta this city has to offer (at Flour +Water and Cotogna, to name a couple). The waitress pushed the bread, the risotto and the duck for 2 the most. Felt a bit excessive in the marketing. The worst part of the experience was the 40 min wait for a table after having a reservation at 8pm on a Tuesday night. The host brought over two half pours for us after 30 min of waiting which were \"complimentary\". I declined as I am not drinking alcohol. When the bill came at the end of the meal, that half pour they offered as complementary was charged to our bill. Really? While we waited to ask the waitress about it, she came a few minutes later and apologized, taking it off the bill as well as a beer that my dining partner had ordered.

Unfortunately the fold wasn't as good as expected: \n+ wine selection was consistently great \n+ the pasta (agnoloti) was out of this world. \n- The pork wasn't too tasty, even the pork belly felt insipid. \n- The rosemary popcorn was cold and oily.", "author": "Antonio M."}

Happened upon this place through my Yelp browsings, and was sucked in by the amazing reviews and gorgeous looking food.  I was shocked at how easy it was to get a reservation at the last minute, as well as how reasonably priced (by SF/Oakland standards) it was.  We were also lucky that my friend and her husband were available at the last minute to join us as well.  We were first seated at a regular table, but then given the option to move to the chef's table, which we gladly took advantage of so that all of the beautiful food prep was in clear view for us.\n\nAs soon as we were seated, we were given a delicious bowl of seasoned popcorn to share.  Next up was an amuse bouche of rye crackers served with smoked trout, roe, and eggplant puree (kind of like a hummus); so tasty!  First course was their namesake sorrel salad, which was perfectly balanced with a light creamy dressing, Asian pears, cucumber, and radish.  Next course was tagliatelle with garlic butter sauce with scallions, tomatoes, and corn, with tiny bits of razor clams; would have loved a bit more of the clam included, but the little bits added good flavor.  Main course I think was my favorite of the night, almost an interesting take on chicken cordon bleu.  It was guinea hen that had been poached in milk then fried with this wonderfully crispy outer layer, stuffed with cheese.  This was served with delicata squash atop a small dollop of ricotta and Beluga lentils.  Loved this dish, savored every bite.  Before the main dessert came out, we were served these delicious ginger cookies.  The dessert was an awesome chocolate custard/mousse type thing, topped with edible flowers and crystallized ginger.  There was a small helping of lemon merengue and passion fruit on the side.  Would have loved to have had some espresso with dessert.  We did the wine pairings, and all were very tasty and matched well with the food.\n\nService was friendly and attentive, and the courses were timed extremely well.  I'm still in shock at the value of this fabulous dinner.  I'm hopeful that they will be able to follow through with their plan to eventually open a brick and mortar location.  In the meantime, I'd love to go back and try some of their other delicious offerings again at this location.  Bravo!", "author": "Danielle B."}

We really enjoyed dinner and were pleased with the balance of flavors. The rock shrimp gnocchi had a phenomenal sauce with chilies. I wish we had bread to mop it up with. The dessert was a perfect finish- the warm vanilla sauce made the chocolate semifreddo melt like gelato. We left there full and satisfied, and will be back again.", "author": "kim p."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-29", "description": "The prix fixe menu (around $55/pp) started off strong: 1. Fluke Crudo with smoked chicories, black olives, asian pears and concord grapes followed by semolina rigatoni...just an amazing concoction of diverse flavors. However, once we got to the lone willow pork shoulder, my heightened expectations were quickly rattled. The pork shoulder was very tasty but too much fat for my liking. Additionally, it was very difficult to eat the pork shoulder with fork and knife from a bowl. The dessert was a winter squash bread which happened to be too sweet for me. Would I recommend this place, yes of course and I'd certainly go back despite the latter portion of our dining experience.", "author": "Pauleena L."}

We've been dining with this fantastic group for more than 2 years now. We have never left disappointed. We bring our out-of-town guests to Sorrel dinners, each commenting on how special both the food and atmosphere is. It is touching to see a group of friends repeatedly creating delicious food and an inviting atmosphere. You can tell that the Sorrel group is proud of their accomplishments, and they should be! After not dining with the crew for 5 months, we walked in last night to smiles/welcomes/hugs. In a city with a fantastic, but sometimes cold, dining scene-- it is great to feel a sense of community. We left last night, as usual, amazed by the creations of Alex (the head chef) and spoiled by the rest of the crew's service. Thank you all! Katie+Luis", "author": "katie w."}

Very accomodating and one of a kind great service! Food was heavenly from the start til the end! You can see all the fresh ingredients and can have a peek in the kitchen while they're in action creating the masterpiece. As for the price, its worth every penny! I love the teamwork!

They catered a function at equinox tonight. A perfectly prepared risotto, pork sliders, fresh arugula salad with pomegranate seeds. Met one of the partners, Brennan, who was very gracious. You can tell they are putting their hearts into the food. Can't wait to dine with them again.", "author": "Erndog R."}

I went with 10 people for a bachelor party, we got the dinner ($55) plus most of us got the wine pairing ($35).  I am not used to spending this much on dinner, but I'm very glad I did.  Everything on the menu was delicious, especially the trout (crudo, with veggies, in flavorful tomato-water which they pour into each person's bowl after serving) and the pork (in some kind of sweet pepper sauce, just perfectly falling off the bone without being mushy).  Every plate was cleared by everyone.  I'm usually skeptical of wine pairings but they really did match well -- citrussy white with the trout, heavier as you went on.  They also gave us a bunch of extra things that were not on the menu that were delicious.  And the chef comes out and talks about the food.  Just an amazing experience, I hope to come back sometime.  Best meal I have eaten in SF (previous was probably Kokkari, if that makes you trust or ridicule my judgement).", "author": "Ilana C."}

The lamb was so tender it melted in your mouth and matched perfectly with the puffed quinoa and other fun surprises that decorated it. The crab risotto blew my mind, the sauce Grenobloise was a delight, and I begged for seconds of the dessert. The entire staff was smiley, friendly, kind and very timely! Absolutely fantastic.

The dishes are very creative and innovative, while still keeping a simple elegance. I've been to a number of Sorrel dinners now and I don't think I've ever had a dish that wasn't executed perfectly.

I've been to my fair share of \"fancy\" restaurants in the city, and Alex easily blew them out of the water. This is one of those meals where every bite is completely savored and you're sad to have it end. Sam, who was in charge of the wine also did an excellent job pairing the food to compliment the meal perfectly. The whole team was friendly and very gracious. If they opened up their own restaurant they would succeed with flying colors. I honestly recommend to anyone.", "author": "Kali H."}
