When the cashier asked how I wanted my egg, I requested scrambled soft (I hate over fried eggs and that's what I received). He surely did not tell me that they are only able to fry eggs since they only have a flat top. Totally ok, I just would have ordered differently. \n\nAnyway, one of the guys noticed I was not into the fried egg situation and offered to make me something else. I opted for the bacon and egg grilled cheese. It wasn't bad by any means but it also wasn't something I had to go back for. It was just a standard breakfast sandwich.

I got the mac n' cheese grilled cheese. It is like a regular grilled cheese, but it has Mac n' cheese in it with the cheese. I also got the tomato soup and it came with croutons. It was very good and it very tasty when I dipped the sandwich in the soup. I also got the seasonal lemonade which, when I went, was mango. It was very good, not too sweet and not to sour. Overall, amazing food, soup, and drinks.! In my opinion, there aren't any bad things about this place. I would recommend going here.", "author": "Jared A."}

And when you place a killer grilled cheese shop in the middle of hip SoMa in San Francisco, you're certain to have an inventive, delicious refresh on this classic combo. My lunch here totally blew my mind.\n\nCame here for lunch when I was staying with my sis in the city, and saw a huge line. It moved quickly, thank goodness, cuz I was starving. \n\nThe restaurant is cute, young, modern. There's paraphernalia on the left wall as you enter, and the menus posted above the register. They've got breakfast, grilled cheese sandwiches, salads, beers/wine/mimosas and other drinks. \n\nI had the daily special sandwich, which was a Hawaiian with many cheeses, grilled sweet onions, and a grilled pineapple. I was going to add the smokehouse bacon and in the end didn't even need it. The sandwich alone was so rich and amazing. I got the 1/2 sandwich 1/2 salad for $12.50. I chose the little bamboo salad, which was so nice and fresh against the gooey, cheesy sandwich. It had edamame, cabbage, red peppers, and was so delicious. I of course also got the smokey tomato soup, which was just smokey enough and the perfect compliment to the gooey sandwich. \n\nFinally I topped it all off with a $5 mimosa, customized with my choice of pomegranate juice. Perfect, San Francisco lunch! Will definitely be back.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

The cheese and mushroom combination was unparalleled. I would also like to compliment the Palo Alto Fire Fighter hot sauce they had to spice up sandwiches. I took a few packets home because it was that good. \n\nOverall, I don't know how many more times I can come here before I exhaust the menu, but I highly recommend coming here before catching a baseball game since the line is a lot shorter and the food less over priced than what you find inside At&t park.

I really enjoyed my sandwich, although I was surprised to find that every meal came with a full-sized orange. There wasn't much on the menu to please my rather picky boyfriend, but he enjoyed a plain grilled cheese. My only complaint is that we both could have done with slightly bigger portions, especially given the price. I assume that's why they provide the oranges, but after eating a sandwich that featured olives and balsamic, I didn't really want citrus. \n\nThe decor is cute, with trendy touches and Giants memorabilia.

It wouldn't be fresh the next day, so I had to finish it.\n\nNow comes a second visit which is never failed to cheese!  After I ordered the veggie-licious version of the original \"Mousetrap\", I decided to sit here and eat.  A first bite from the modified Mousetrap: it's fresher, just as tastier, salty enough to be delicious, and absolutely crunchy from both the toasty bread.

We were lucky that we found 2 seats at the bar because it was pretty crowded. It did take awhile to order and receive our food, but you could tell the staff was working hard to try to accommodate so many people. Once our food came, I noticed that everyone gets a strawberry with their meal and I thought that was such a cute concept. Looking at other posts in the past it seems to be their thing with having the meal come with some type of fruit, which I really love. My sandwich was crispy as expected and I thought overall pretty alright. They had forgotten the extra bacon my friend purchased, but definitely made up for it when she mentioned it. I really wanted to love the grilled cheese, but I didn't feel like I was wowed by it. We also had some beers and the ambiance of mostly concert goers was really nice.", "author": "Christine N."}

It's a simple sandwich cafe with a couple of tables outdoors and some eclectic decorations inside. I enjoyed watching the cooks prepare the food over the grill of their open kitchen. The grilled cheese here are made of ingredients from notable vendors, including Tillamook, Point Reyes, and Golden Gate Meats. \n\n$12.50 Cubano - Monterey jack, Jarlsberg, cocoa rubbed pulled pork, ham, mustard, bread n butter pickles, pickled red onions, chipotle butter on levain:\nThis might be one of the better Cubanos I have had. Maybe it's the rub they use, or the amount of cheese they put in the sandwich, but the pilled pork actually tastes juicy, and not dried out. The pickles and onions add some tartness to balance out the flavors. The buttery toasted levain is very good too. The sandwich came with an orange, but it was so dry that I couldn't eat it. Still, it was a great sandwich.\n\n$12 Club Turkey w/ bacon - cheddar, creamy havarti, smoked turkey, tomatoes, mustard, arugula on artisan sourdough:\nClubs are another one of my favorite sandwiches and this one was pretty good. The melted cheese, smoked turkey and bacon on sourdough were great, but not quite as great as the Cubano, in my opinion.\n\n$11 Jalapeno Popper w/ bacon - local chevre, Monterey jack, apricot-jalape\u00f1o relish on levain:\nThis is one fiery sandwich, and pretty sweet too. The creamy chevre has a sharp flavor. The gooey chevre and Monterey Jack didn't do much to quell the jalapeno spread on the levain. \n\nIt's a bit of walk, but the Cubano is worth the trip. At least, it is to me. The service is very friendly too. It looks like the food is made to order, so it can take a while to receive your order. I'm not a fan of paying so much for a sandwich, but these days, sandwich businesses sure are doing well. It's getting harder to find a decent sandwich for under $8. \nNow I've always liked grilled cheese, but I didn't think I would be this fond of cheese & bread. Good stuff.", "author": "Joy W."}

It was delicious, not too oily or cheesy, but my whole meal did cost a little more than my usual lunches out. I also had their red ale which was delicious. They had a kolsch and lighter beers (and wines) on tap, but I was feeling a little darker palette. Service is quick, as you order at the cashier and a food runner delivers your meal to you after finding your table number. Everyone enjoyed their sandwiches, Coke, and beers!

Mushroom Gruyere grilled cheese (Fontina, gruyere, roasted mushrooms & potatoes, leeks, caramelized onions, thyme butter on levain) with the Bamboo Sesame Kale salad. While the grilled cheese indeed hit the mark, it was surprisingly the salad that was a bigger winner than the grilled cheese! Clean, delicious, and filling - Highly recommended! I might just come back for just that! I also really like how they give you a piece of fruit on the side - so cute, feels like a school lunch, I took my orange to-go.\n\nOverall though, 3 stars. -1 star for the good, but average grilled cheese, which I'd expected to be BOMB... as it's the namesake of the restaurant after all... though I might still return to try another kind sometime.  Also -1 star for the service. It was our first time here, and the cashier girl was getting impatient with our questions. And there wasn't even a line behind us. One of the other girls behind the counter inside was also yelling at the top of her lungs the names of the people who were waiting for their orders sitting OUTSIDE. Incredibly annoying.

Like a lot of people, I grew up eating grilled cheese sandwiches (among other things) and I like it when a restaurant/eatery can take a simple, classic meal and get creative with it.\n\nFacts:\n\n* You can order specialty sandwiches or build your own (depending upon their available ingredients).\n* There is sparse indoor seating and extensive outdoor seating.\n* You go inside, place your order with the cashier, give them your name, pay and then they'll call you when your order is ready.\n* In addition to your order, they give you several napkins and a complimentary apple (if you wish).\n* They serve breakfast and lunch.\n* Aside from sandwiches, you can get soups, salads and baked goods.\n\nPros:\n\n+ I ordered the club turkey.  That thing was f***ing delicious.  It was warm, filled with plenty of turkey and cheese and, ultimately, was very filling.\n+ The prices that you see on the menu are the exact prices you pay.  As emphasized on their website, all taxes and miscellaneous fees are factored in and accounted for so that there are no unpleasant surprises.  I like honesty and transparency.\n+ Both the cashier and the lady who handed me my order were friendly.\n+ As also emphasized on what they have posted on their wall, they take good care of their employees.  San Francisco, as any sane person knows, is an expensive place to live.  The owners of this establishment are mindful of this and provide their employees with full benefits and a livable wage.  Hats off to them for that.\n\nCons:\n\n- With the lunch crowd present, it took about 20 minutes for my sandwich to be prepared.  Wait times, even for a simple sandwich, will likely be long.\n- For the price, I was expecting my sandwich to be a little larger than what I got.  It's not too big of deal though because it was still very filling.\n\nOverall, I was impressed and I can definitely see myself returning.\n\n4 stars", "author": "Michael F."}

I expected the place to be really crowded cause I thought it was extremely popular. But, I was wrong. I got the cubano, the wait was not too bad, but when the food came I was not impressed. The grilled cheese was extremely expensive and what I got was pathetic. There wasn't even enough cheese, it didn't pass the pull test at all. The only good part was the meat. I will say, however, that this grilled cheese wasn't super heavy so at least there's that. Overall, not worth it. Super expensive and not even satisfying.", "author": "Emily X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-20", "description": "UPDATE:\nFollowing our reply to the email the manager sent us, stating we were not happy with the explanation she gave us since it's very obvious that the staffs were obviously lying about the situation, the CEO Nate reached out to us personally, and I have to say the way he handled the whole situation was above and beyond. He not only called and left a voice mail, but also sent me a very sincere email to explain and apologized for his employees' mistakes. We truly appreciate his effort, and are willing to give this place another shot. Despite all that happened, we're glad Nate stepped in and took care of this, and now we feel a lot more comfortable going back, because this place sandwich is absolutely above 5 stars!\n\noriginally what happened..:\nI would totally give this restaurant a 5 star in a heartbeat before today, but what happened today totally changed my mind. \nMy boyfriend and I walked in the restaurant and got in line just like everyone else, but I couldn't help but noticed that several employees started staring at us and whispering. I know it right then right there, they're talking about my boyfriend wearing the Make America Great Again hat. ( with the Trump label on the back) let me tell you, the way they starred at us is like they're looking at some type of rare animal in the zoo. Like, I get it, we're in San Francisco. One the the most liberal cities in the United States, but I think even that, we still have the right to express our political points of views and also at least wear what we want to wear right? I mean as long as we aren't trying to start anything with anyone, we were just standing in line peacefully, trying to get a nice grilled cheese sandwich for lunch. Anyway, at this point we already felt very uncomfortable, not to mention the order process was even more awkward. So, after we ordered it, my boyfriend felt the need that he should just leave and have me wait for the order before things get worse. Nevertheless, him leaving did not make things better but even worse..the second he stepped his foot out of the restaurant, the girl working in the front that's been giving us dirty looks started telling everyone, even the guys working in the kitchen\"ITS THAT GUY, the one with the Trump hat!\" like hello? I'm still here? It's one of those situations that everyone's talking crap about you in front of you like your not even there. And of course at the end, we finally got our lunch..BUT we didn't get the apples that's suppose to included in our meals. \nLike, really? I mean I don't usually eat the apples included, but using this as a way to tell us your not happy with who we support, isn't it kind of immature and unprofessional? I do get everyone has their right to express their opinions, but I don't think work is the right place for you to do so, especially, the people who your dealing with are your customers. We have always loved this place, but being treated like this just because we have different opinions makes me sick. I heard the girl said that Trump is the most disgusting, racist, sexist man, but discriminating your customer due to people having different views than yours makes you any different then who you think Trump is? \nI honestly don't care who you support, Trump, Hillary, Obama...I believe everyone has their own reasons and I respect that. But no one should be treated the way this restaurant treated us today, and feel less of themselves just because ones beliefs don't align with another's. \n\nUPDATE: \nAfter contacting the company about our experience, here what we got. Apparently My boyfriend and I had a \"disagreement\" and he left angrily?  Just funny how even the management team would even buy that kind of story! If that was what really happened, maybe they can explain to me why the guy in the back of the kitchen along with the guy at the register and girl in the front would started pointing and kept looking out the window when my boyfriend left, then I would buy their story. Obviously they tried to ignore to fact that the whole thing started when we were in line, when we first walked on to the store! Not even going to mention about the apple part, when they were putting our boxes in the bag, the guy was just refilling apples with the big box in front of the girl. So that just make perfect sense they all the sudden forgot right? But it's okay I get that some customers just not suppose to get their part of the meal when the store is busy. What a disappointment. But whatever, we got no control over whatever they want to say or blame the whole situation on our part. I hate to say this but we certainly won't go back again.", "author": "Jasmine Y."}

It's delicious and really flavorful! :)\n\nTheir toast-ing techniques have improved because the bread is toasted to perfection. For those who are on a gluten free diet, they have gluten free bread! \n\nThe line for this place does get long during lunchtime and it takes about 10-15 minutes for them to make your order, so plan accordingly! If you're in a time crunch, you can order online and pick it up. \n\nPretty glad this restaurant is just on the other side of South Park from my office.

The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen provided on site cooking (made to order sandwiches) and had a menu that we found to be really fun and flexible. On top of made to order grilled cheese sandwiches we added on salad, tomato soup, and mac and cheese. I can't even begin to tell you how thrilled our guests were that this was the food they got to eat at a wedding and not some tired chicken or lasagna dish. Also, our catering cost was one of the lowest prices tags of our entire wedding which is practically unheard of. \nIf you're thinking about using The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen to cater a function for you, do it!

Gavin ate half and I boxed the remaining half into the game. Eating half of that during the bottom of the 3rd inning didn't give me tons of guilt. \n\nThe dish is creamy and rich.

But I just couldn't ..\n\nIt's pretty hard to mess up a grilled cheese in my opinion, and pretty easy to make a good one.\n\nFirst, while we were waiting for our food, we sat on a seat next to the kitchen where we could see in. I noticed a griddle full of sandwiches ( 30 or more ) prepping. It wasn't long before I noticed the short lady preparing it was not wearing gloves and touching the cheese with her bare hands. She was alternating putting cheese on the bread, breaking one piece in half, wiping her hand on a towel on her apron, then using the same hand to wipe her nose . Gross and super unsanitary. \n\nThe other 2 kitchen workers thankfully were wearing gloves and one of them was making our food thank goodness.\n\nThe food came out and sigh, not really cheesy and barely any meat. We got 2 anorexic sandwiches for $10 each? Jalape\u00f1o popper substituted with turkey, and the hubby the Cubans. There was some apricot jalape\u00f1o mix which covered exactly the middle of the bread only, and that was meh. Not a yummy combo I'm sorry. I ate the side of the bread that had my scrawny turkey. And disposed of the side with apricot. The Cubano was better but still not good. Why was the pickle inside sweet too?\n\nI don't mind paying for food, and I will spend for good food. But in this case $10 was a waste when you compare it to all the better and good sandwiches you can get. Vietnamese sandwiches, Ike's sandwiches, all put this place to shame.\n\nWhen the bf says yeah we won't be back, for sure we will not be back.

And they also give you an apple with your meal, which I think is great because it balances out all the cheesiness.\nThe restaurant is also clean with cute decor.

We ended up giving away our plums to a bum who was knocked out in the alleyway. ;)\n\nFirst bite into the Piglet, I thought, \"Hmm, wow...very sweet. Ham is a bit salty. But cheese is uber yummy.\" The levain bread is extremely delicious. Great texture!\n\nI gave 1/2 of my Piglet to our foodie friend and he gave me his 1/2 of the Popper sammich. When I took a bite of that other sandwich, I knew I should have ordered myself that one as well. It had a great spicy flavor to it and the cheesy goodness made it all worthwhile.

I wish all restaurant service was like this place. The people who work here are just so attentive and appreciate a good pun about cheese. This is the kind of service where they call you by your first name and recognize that you are in the same party as the person who stood in line before you who they also remember and refer to by their first name.\n\nThe grilled cheese sandwiches are a bit much, I think. The bread is fried to a crisp and oil just on your whole hand even if you picked it up with two fingers. There is no avoiding it. Just know now that oil will get on your hand no matter what. I've tried the piglet, the farmer's breakfast, and the mushroom gruyere. All were good. The piglet and the farmer's breakfast were similar, though I liked the farmer's breakfast more. The eggs in these breakfast sandwiches are not consistent though. One was more overcooked than the other. The lunch sandwiches will come with a little side of fruit, which I am thankful for.\n\nObviously, you should get a grilled cheese sandwich here, but also get these things:\n\nThe crab mac n cheese ($5) was so decadent. I know some might only reserve this term for desserts, but this cheesy mac was quite so. There was plenty of crab meat, plenty of cheese, and plenty of macaroni. The whole thing fit in a little take out box because I think it's meant as a side, but the whole thing weighed like a really heavy brick. It felt like that in my stomach after I ate it too.\n\nI am in love with the housemade sodas they have, which is served from their vintage tap. I've had the grapefruit pink peppercorn and the meyer lemon lavender. They are just as good soda flavors as they are ice cream flavors. They have some zing to them. The peach iced tea is delicious too. They have this during the late summer when peach is in season.

AGCK is near 21st amendment and is a perfect complement before you go and grab a beer next door. \n\nThere are surprisingly a lot of grilled cheese choices at this place and only one of them is just plain grilled cheese which when coming to a place like this there is no way you are going to get that! My grilled cheese had apricot and a little bit of spiciness. It was a great combination of spicy and sweet. The sides were equally good as I took in the SF staple kale salad. The service was really quick and the sandwich was great. You also get a free apple or orange with your sandwich as well. \n\nYou know what you are getting when you come to a placed named after grilled cheese but it surprisingly a varied menu with a ton of options for grilled cheesy goodness.

I stood a few minutes for some stools to free up since it was super windy outside. We sat down and about 15 minutes after we ordered our melt arrived. \n\nIt was good. I liked it. Maybe I didn't add enough ingredients? Maybe I should have pushed for the bacon? It would have been amazing to add avocado if they had it to make like a BLT-A. Either way it's a grilled cheese that I know I could make on my own. Also, I asked for a side of the horseradish dipping sauce. I hated it. Boyfriend loved it. I don't personally like horseradish.

They don't need any customers.\nThat was the message I got loud and clear from an employee.\n\nSure there's a line to order. Okay, might be worth it, I told myself. There were six of us still in line and they were very busy. Then a guy comes in the door, and grabs an employee telling him that he wants to place an order for 16 sandwiches. Asks if he can just give HIM the order instead of standing in line. \n\nThe employee asks if the sandwiches are all the same or if there are \"specials\". The guy says that there are things to be \"added\" to many of the sandwiches.\n\nThe employee, a burly young man with curly hair says, \"Sure, just step over here and I'll take your order.\"I watch the jaws drop of everyone in line. \n\nThe man in front of me in line, asks the guy who wants 16 sandwiches, \"Why can't you just get in line like all the rest of us!? We've been waiting here already.\"\n\nThen the employee gets surly and says they're going to do the line orders and the 16 sandwiches all at once. \n\nWe stare in disbelief. Then the employee adds...***** \"And you can leave if you don't like it!\"\n\nI did. \n\nThey obviously don't need your money, ....or the individual customers.

I had gone back twice and fended off a sea of men waiting for the delicious bites. \n\nFlash ahead to last week, I was meeting a vegetarian friend for lunch and some light shopping and midway drive up, after swearing that they should pick the restaurant while I commute up, I thought about WWDC and grilled cheese. \n\nLuckily my friend was very happy to let me choose the restaurant and off we went. It was far too cold to sit outside and definitely something that is missing from this restaurant is heat lamps for their outdoor seating area and opted to sit inside.\n\nFor once I ordered a meatless sandwich because it just sounded better. Half sandwich order of the Mushroom Gruyere with a side of smokey tomato soup. Fontina, gruy\u00e8re, roasted wild mushrooms, gold potatoes, melted leeks, caramelized onions, thyme butter on levain bread. Soup was a sour tomato with a hint of smoke and the creme fraiche spelled out the word \"Soup\" in my bowl. Kind of amazing all around. The sandwich itself was super tasty, perfectly thin slices of gold potatoes and once dipped into the soup, heaven sent on a cold day. Also served with our lunches was a perfectly placed tangerine that still had a branch and leaves on it. \n\nGreat small touches, and delicious bites made this carnivore almost thinking twice about needing to eat meat ever again, as the meatless options sounded even better than the ones with meat.", "author": "Jessica C."}

I was here the other day down the street from here and upon walking to the front, no line!  I had to take advantage of that.\n\nI got the breakfast piglet, the only breakfast sandwich that offered meat inside the sandwich.  I could had gotten the farmer's breakfast sandwich but that one includes potatoes and bacon in there which was a bit too carb-heavy for me.  I got an iced coffee as well with my meal.  \n\nUnlike a burrito, grilled cheese absolutely needs to be eaten ASAP and it was absolutely tasty!  The salty cheese and ham with the zesty mustard with the right amount of crunch from their bread was perfectly made.  The over easy egg made it a bit messy to eat and I usually am not a fan of over easy eggs...but the yolk really blended well with the cheese.  For any runny yolk haters, give the yolk a chance on the breakfast sandwiches.\n\nThe same sandwich is on the lunch menu for $3 more and it's without the egg so I'm most likely coming back here during breakfast hours again.", "author": "Ben H L."}

Combining industrial-chic architecture with 1950s-style kitsch, the place is ideal for its highly mobile customer base with an expansive patio as well as seating indoors.\n\nThere are eight different specialty sandwiches, three of which were served that evening - the Classic with medium cheddar and jack as well as roasted tomato; a heartier sandwich called the Piglet with sharp cheddar, smoked ham, apple mustard and rosemary butter; and the most audacious, the Jalapeno Popper with jack, chevre, bacon and an apricot-jalapeno relish. They also served Bacon-Cheddar Brioche bites, Savory Bread Pudding with mushrooms, and in an ode to days of yore, Smoky Tomato Soup shooters (see photos).\n\nHeidi Gibson, a record-holding Grilled Cheese Invitational winner, is the chief menu architect and owns the place with Nate Pollak. They serve specialty wines and beer, and also homemade sodas such as vanilla ginger mint and pomegranate lemonade. Try the self-proclaimed Killer Butterscotch Pecan Blondies. They're not kidding. Nowhere does the menu serve my mom's grilled cheese sandwich but give it time. Prices for the sandwiches range from $7 to $10, and it's open for weekday lunch but will expand to breakfast, evenings and weekends very shortly.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...artisan grilled cheese sandwiches...tasty despite the pedigree\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...slacker hipster or corporate climber would feel comfortable here\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very nice and attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I've graduated to gourmet grilled cheese", "author": "Ed U."}

My friend only got a grilled cheese sandwich but enjoyed my tomato soup so much that she went back up to order one of her own.

I don't even care because I'm too busy nomming away happily. The sandwiches here are so much more interesting than those served at The Melt or other places. Too bad this location is a little out of the way from where I live or else I would eat here every day. My all-time favorite sandwich is the Mushroom Gruyere, but on my most recent visit, I decided to give the Jalapeno Popper a try since I like spicy food. There is bar stool type seating inside or they have tables and chairs outside. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they have hooks under the counters to hold bags and jackets!\n\nWhat I ordered:\n- Jalapeno popper with mushrooms ($9): http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-american-grilled-cheese-kitchen-san-francisco?select=PKT0Uc7NJqj1YWBKmsa0Tw#PKT0Uc7NJqj1YWBKmsa0Tw\n\nI asked to substitute the bacon in the Jalapeno Popper for mushrooms (since I love the Mushroom Gruyere), and the woman at the register was very accommodating! She was a bit hesitant since she was wasn't sure that the mushrooms would mesh well with the jalapeno since they are already seasoned themselves, so she suggested that I get the mushrooms on the side and add them myself if I found that the combination was good. Very thoughtful advice! I actually did end up liking the mushrooms in the sandwich though! \n\nHowever, I was surprised to find that the grilled cheese had quite a potent spicy kick and subsequently drank a whole bottle of water and ate the tangerine on the side in a desperate attempt to cool down the fire on my tongue. Good thing they provide a little fruit on the side of the sandwiches! I thought I had a decent spicy tolerance, but I was defeated this time. I still enjoyed my meal though despite this hiccup because you can tell that they use quality ingredients and the cheese is sooo tasty. \n\nTIP: There's a secluded, quaint little park down the street on South Park, which would be perfect for having a grilled cheese picnic at!", "author": "Jessica C."}

I tried the mushroom/gruyere sandwich, tomato soup, and bacon mac & cheese. All of that came out to about $20. \n\nMushroom/gruyere: The sandwich had potatoes inside it. And they were mushy, so it made the texture a little weird. But the flavor was good. I wish they added some truffle oil or something - that would make it a little more worth it & more scrumptious. I also wish the sandwich came with a side, like fries or potatoes. Instead, it came with a tangerine. Interesting.\n\nTomato soup: Tasted like it came from a can! Campbell's tomato soup can! Def do not recommend!\n\nMac & cheese was prob my fav. However, the cheese hardened on the top making it hard to eat. So I just ended up eating the macaroni below it. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I finally got to go here & I think it's good to try once, but I probably won't be back.

I already tried The Melt in Burlingame and was disappointed, but I heard this place was better because it took the classic grilled cheese and added a gourmet twist.\n\nI randomly thought I'd finally give this place a try for lunch and take a sandwich to-go on my off day. Walking in, I checked out the menu (and consulted Yelp), and walked up to order a Jalape\u00f1o Popper. The guy at the counter was running around taking orders and serving up food, so when he asked me to hold on one second, I totally understood. When he returned and took my order, he gave me service with a smile. \n\nIt was mighty warm inside so I stood at the doorway to get a bit of a breeze. About 5-10 minutes later, my order was ready and the guy called out my name and my order (keep in mind, he said \"Jalape\u00f1o Popper\"). He presented my order one of their takeout boxes and I was on my way. Now, I just assumed it was correct and didn't open it up until I got back to my apartment, but now I wish I had.\n\nInside was a pretty good looking sandwich accompanied by a plump strawberry. When I picked it up, however, I was disappointed. My Jalape\u00f1o Popper that was supposed to include: local ch\u00e8vre, Monterey jack, apricot-jalape\u00f1o relish, Zoe's applewood-smoked bacon on levain. The sandwich I had in my hand had what appeared to be roast beef and potatoes inside! After looking at the menu, it looks like it probably was the American Dip (sans the dipping sauce).\n\nI was hungry and didn't feel like walking all the way back to get my order corrected. Skeptical, I took a bite and all my fears were realized. This was not something I was going to enjoy. The roast beef was merely decent, the cheese was cheese, and the potatoes... Well, let's just say they need to be left out of grilled cheese sandwiches. I mean, it already has enough carbs from the bread anyways. By the second half of the sandwich, I was really feeling like throwing in the towel. I hate to waste food that I paid a good $9+ for, but I was over the same 1-dimensional cheesy taste that was neither complimented or cut up by the roast beef and/or potatoes. I'd like to think that if I had gotten my correct order, I would have been satisfied by the buttery, cheesy, bacon taste, but alas, I may never know. I don't think I'll be back for quite some time.

The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen is open every day at 8am for a reason, right? Skip the lunch rush and head here for breakfast, when there isn't a line out the door and nourishment comes at half the price (and half the headache).\n\nFor $4.25 and until 11am you can have a Classic Breakfast grilled cheese - sharp cheddar and jack with a fried egg and roasted tomato. It's perfectly sized and a much better value than the lunchtime sandwiches. Don't get me wrong - I love spending $10 on a grilled cheese when I have a hardcore hankering, but I'd much rather spend $4.25 and be able to get one two days in a row, ya dig?\n\nIf you insist on coming at lunch, come early-ish and go for the Blue Pate Special (half sandwich and a soup) for better value. The Mouse Trap is always good but make sure you add tomato to make it even better. Even with smoky cream of tomato soup you can't overload on nightshades and the clementines or grapes as garnish are a charming touch. If you're dining as a group might I suggest placing your order as one so it comes out with some semblance of consistency as orders sometimes get lost.\n\nBlackberry lemonade or one of the housemade sodas are a must if available.

The food has gotten progressively worse each time. The first visit I would have rated 4 stars. The second, 3 stars, and this last visit, 2 stars. My rating above represents an average.\n\nI'm usually with a partner or small group when eating at this restaurant, allowing us to order several different sandwiches each time, though all are variations of grilled cheese. This has allowed me to sample pretty much everything on their menu.\n\nOn this most recent visit, we ordered the Mushroom Gruyere ($10.50), Adam's Rueben ($12) and the Cubano ($11.50) along with tomato soup ($5). Grilled cheese with tomato soup is an American classic and hard to screw up, but somehow it happened.\n\nThe \"smoky\" tomato soup was served first. As always, it comes with a cr\u00e8me fraiche garnish. The soup was sour. You might be thinking, \"well it's tomato soup, it's suppose to be sour.\" Not this sour. Good tomato soup is rich and creamy, and perhaps a bit tangy. This was just sour, much more so than on my previous 2 visits. \n\nThe Mushroom Gruyere. The first time I had this sandwich it came on thick bread with a nice balance of cheese and mushroom. This time it was just on regular sandwich bread that you might find on sale at Safeway, and contained far more mushroom than cheese. Very strange. This was one of my favorites.\n\nThe Cubano was decent. But again, the balance between cheese and meat was off. I bit into big chunks of what was actually very good pulled pork, but tasted very little cheese. \n\nAdam's Rueben was a disaster. If this sandwich, served with \"kraut\" and pickles on rye, is suppose to evoke a New York deli, then it fails badly. I bit into a chunk of pickles and couldn't have been happier that we were splitting the sandwiches as it meant I didn't have to take another bite. \n\nThe best part of the meal was actually the whole orange that came with each sandwich.

Good thing I had a light snack prior to coming here!\n\nWe ordered the Mushroom Gruy\u00e8re and Mousetrap (with bacon and tomatoes) and their seasonal blackberry lemonade.  I have to say that I deducted one star for the lemonade itself.  It was DISGUSTING.  So happy that it is only a seasonal and not a staple of AGCK.  It tasted really awful...I know lemonade is supposed to be sour, but this was something else.  It was sour to the point of bitterness and left my mouth pretty dry.  I couldn't finish it.\n\nGood thing they had really good grilled cheese sandwiches to save their butts.  Everything came out really hot and fresh.  You can tell their really put some thought into their sandwiches.  The bread was toasted to perfection and the cheese was the right ooey-gooey texture.  My mushroom grilled cheese was really good and I loved the aroma of it.  However, the entire thing was a bit too heavy for me that day so I only ate half.  The other half was devoured by the big eater I was with.  Phew!  \n\nAGCK is a pretty small establishment with a few counter top seatings indoors and maybe 10 tables outdoors.  The staff are all pretty friendly and hard working.  However, nothing on their menu really makes me want to go back except for the mushroom sandwich, which by the way, is $9.", "author": "May W."}

The crispy, buttery toast sandwiching melted American cheese. This place takes that memory and kicks  up the creativity a notch or two. I love mushrooms so I couldn't turn down getting the mushroom gruy\u00e8re. The mushrooms and cheese were great, but the biggest surprise were the potatoes. I also enjoyed the jalape\u00f1o popper and the club turkey. Don't worry about being fat because every meal comes with a healthy piece of fruit.

American Grilled Cheese Kitchen \n\nTotal round trip walk (excluding wait time for to-go order) - 55 min \n\nWorth it?   yes. \n\nAs everyone knows I'm a now & later kind of girl, so as usual, I got a bunch of stuff to try... which is also a great opportunity to determine what's good to eat now & what stands the test of fridge / reheating \n\nMousetrap (plain - comes w/ tomato, bacon or other stuff if you want but I just wanted plain) - excellent ratio of melty cheese to bread. No cheese overpowered the other but blended together so very nicely! Crust was super crunchy & tore up my mouth a bit.....but all crusty breads do this as I usually don't partake, so no foul here.  Didn't reheat up so great - eat this now \n\nMushroom & Gruyere - mushroom / onion / thyme layer was much bigger than cheese layer & almost didn't taste the gruyere. Funny enough, wasn't too impressed upon 1st taste but it was delish, reheated the next day & the gruyere stood out much more - eat this later \n\nGluten-Free Mac N Cheese - pasta was overcooked (which is easy to do w/ the GF stuff) but nice peppery savory flavor. Cheese was nicely distributed throughout but no stringy pulls - stayed the same even after fridge / microwave.  Prob wouldn't get this again \n\nLast note:  each sandwich half required an entire napkin to mop up greasy fingers & mouth. Wonder if I can ask them not to fry the sandwich in butter next time? \n\nThere most def will be a next time & I already know what's on the menu.... the Moscone!

I was teetering between giving 3 or 4 stars.  I think 3 is more accurate for me.\n\nNot wanting to be all lactosey-intolerant gassy for the rest of the day, I stayed away from the items with just cheese in it and went with the Club Turkey:  cheddar, havarti, smoked turkey, applewood-smoked bacon, Sierra Nevada stout mustard, roasted tomatos, arugula--all for 9 bones. I stopped in here on my way back to work after going to the gym, so the lunch hour rush was completely gone and I was in and out of there in about 10 minutes.\n\nAs for the sandwich, it was okay.  Nice, nice, not thrilling but nice.  Good parts were the taste and crunchiness of the bread, melted cheddar, and the bacon of course.  I mean who doesn't love buttered, crunchy bread and crispy bacon?  But the rest was so-so.  The havarti mixed with the cheddar was kinda mushy and eventually made everything soggy.  Keep in mind I ate it back at work which probably added to the sogginess as well.  But yeah, I'd defintely recommend eating it there.\n\nThey have limited seating, both inside and out.  On a day where the weather is good, expect a line out the door during lunch hour.  If you happen to drive, bring meter money (although you could use your ATM/Visa like I did).

To finally get to take that first bite into that crunchy, buttery, toasty bread only to hit that warm, gooey middle - yea, I'd say that's heaven right there. \n\nThe Mushroom Gruyere especially will have that affect on you. Talk about pairings, perfect in every way. If mushrooms aren't your steez, get yourself the Jalapeno Popper, it's got the right amount of kick to wake you up and get your day started.\n\nGet yourself a bowl of the Smokey Tomato Soup because well, to be straight, that comfort meal just ain't comfortable without the whole ordeal. \n\nImagine dipping your perfect sandwich into that creamy tangy hot soup, I think I just jizzed. Better yet, have a few spoonfuls of the soup alone, throwing in those garlic'y croutons in to soak makes for that \"eyes rolled back, lip smacking, mmmmm\" feeling. \n\nOh and the breakfast, don't get me started. Farmer's Breakfast is on a whole 'nother level. All those wonderful breakfast foods you're used to eating thrown into a sandwich - bacon, potatoes, cheese and an egg that oozes that magical golden yolk.

It was the first time out of dozens, but I'd gone there, because I was going to get a better sandwich, even though it violated my budget for the day.\n\nI wanted a grilled cheese with turkey, gruyere, fontina, carmelized onions and creme fraiche.  After a long discussion whereby it was basically ascertained they couldn't cook it with the creme fraiche in it (danger of getting on other orders), I said, ok, then I want the mushroom gruyere minus the mushrooms plus the turkey.\n\nI ended up with just cheese and potatoes.  No turkey, no leeks, no onions.  That turkey cost extra.  The black currant house soda was a really great flavor of the day house soda.\n\n I'm too hungry and my lunch break is over, so it is too late to do anything about it, but I regret not going with plan A or C.  Add to that, they've gotten in the habit where the crust isn't just really toasted, but into burnt territory.\n\nIgnoring the cost, they're still the best grilled cheese in the area.  They really do make extra effort in customer service with a positive attitude.  They have some of the best tasting wheat-free bread, I've eaten (though I think the butter\\cheese, helps a lot).  Their free fruit always seems a bit discount eat it today, but otherwise more natural and certainly perfectly edible and a lovely side.  They also have the best gluten free potato chips in the area.  I've never seen Deep River snack chips any where else (grocery store, etc.).\n\nI like their salads.  As a gluten intolerant person, I don't have a problem eating here, but if you're celiac, this is wheat-free bread; not a gluten free kitchen.  I like their selection of glass bottle cane sugar or natural fruit sugar.

I've had a mac and cheese sandwich before and I thought it was super heavy (though good), but this one didn't feel as filling.  The mushroom and gruyere paired really well together also, though mushroom and cheese are two of my favorite foods. The only regret I had was not ordering the tomato bisque with the sandwich because I think that would've paired heavenly with the sandwich.\n\nIt was also really cute that they include an apple with your meal -- it's like their attempt to make the meal healthy.\n\nThere is a bit of a line, but it moves fast enough.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-12", "description": "Am I the only one? Probably... I'm torn between giving a 3-star or 4-star rating for this place. Food is probably 4-star but it has 1 huge downside in my opinion that gets a deduction of 1-star. \n\nLocation is perfect right next to South Park but on the street side of 2nd street. It's pushed back from the sidewalk to accommodate an outdoor seating, which is great since the inside is super tiny. \n\nI've been here twice since it opened and I think both times I've gotten the Piglet since it's one of the only ones that has meat in it. I love my cheese and sandwiches but I need some meat in there as well. It's pricey for a sandwich that doesn't come with anything else. Well it does come with 1 tiny, organic apple. But it's about $9 for the sandwich and everything else like chips, drink or soup is an additional cost of course. \n\nOne thing I can't deny is this place's popularity within the SOMA area. It's always has a line out the door reaching to the sidewalk. A \"short\" like is to the door or just right outside the door. So one day I was deciding what to eat and was walking by and it was almost 2pm, so the line was super short. The line was maybe 2-3 people ahead of me, so I decided to go there. Even with only 2-3 people in front of me, I still waited 20-25 min for my food! Omg reeally?? Rumor has it that they have only like one grill or something nuts like that. So pumping out the grilled sandwiches takes a looong time. Your whole restaurant concept is based around GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICHES. Dude c'monn get another grill, I know your kitchen is super duper tiny, but I feel like this place wasn't thought out and it definitely did not think it would have to accommodate the entire SOMA area for lunch. \n\nIf you order a salad or soup, your food comes out super quick. So that's a nice perk if you don't want that, you just have to suffer the lines but can come out quicker than those waiting wayy before you. The cobb salad is also pretty good. However it's not the typical cobb salad. But it's still pretty good. \n\nMy other favorite is the Tomato Bisque soup... mhmm so delicious! So hearty and creamy. Yummm.. \n\nSorry I had to give it the 3-star despite the food behing 4-star.", "author": "Grace L."}

And really, there's so many ways to offer it up.  \n\nI choose the Mousetrap grilled cheese.  The first thing (and only thing) I needed to see in the ingredients was cheddar.  It had a nice balance added with the havarti and monterey jack cheese friends.  I also ordered an added roasted tomato and pickle, two fantastic cohorts.  Nothing completes a grilled cheese quite like it's favorite companion, tomato soup.  The tomato soup offered was a spicy version, so that was a no brainer addition to my meal!  \n\nSurprise!  There's a bonus of specialty drink options as well!  I saw that they offered homemade soda's so I had to inquire as to what kinds.  As soon as the cashier said coconut, he sold me.  Say no more, me and coconut have also become very dear friends as of late!  \n\nThe grilled cheese was really fantastic.  Not too little and not too much cheese, perfect amount of tomatoes and pickles on toasted sourdough bread.  The soup came out lukewarm and I expected a little more of a spicy kick, but it was still a solid B grade.  The soda was beyond amazing....to the point that I would have bought a lifetime supply if it was bottled!  Bonus points for the little clementine served on the side.

There was no grease on the outside at all but only dry bread.  These are not grilled cheese sandwiches (or else the cheese would have gooed out the sides not burnt to a crisp), they are over roasted sandwiches. I watch while it was being cooked, and obviously forgot about it. This was a 2:40 today, they had maybe one other order. \n\nThis is not the first time I have had a sandwich from this place that was not worth the $10.50 I spent on it. Do not go here if you want a good grilled cheese sandwich or quality controlled food. It varies way too much. Out of five times, I had an amazing sandwich once and it was the same kind I am eating today. Today it was worthless and I have to throw away the crust (to me, the best part of a well made grilled sand).\n\nSave your money and head to Crossroads Cafe on Delancey.

That doesn't mean that my entire concept of what a grilled cheese sandwich can and should be hasn't been revolutionized.  Oh, it has.\n\nI had the special where they offer a smaller sandwich and a bowl of soup for the same price as the large sandwich.  I got the mushroom gruyere sandwich and the smoky tomato soup.  They give you homemade croutons to put in the soup, and ohh my gosh, that soup was amazing.  And the sandwich was perfectly crisp and cheesy and earthy tasting on its own, but when I dipped it into that soup, it was the most amazing blend of salty and savory and sweet, complex flavors that were familiar but reinvented and overall, just wonderful.\n\nCapping it off with a fresh mandarin and a homemade diet cola (which tasted unusually sweet and equally familiar-but-different) was the perfect way to round out the meal.  Also tried their lemonade (tart and refreshing) and eye-nommed someone's salad at a nearby table (will have to get one next time!)\n\nWorking backwards, however, we waited in a 20-minute line, then waited about 30-45 minutes after we ordered for our food.

The walk was only about ten minutes and while the line was already out the door when we had arrived, we were already committed. And by that I mean my manic need for dairy had already reached a fever pitch.\n\nThe long line turned out to be misleading as we were eating within 15 minutes of stepping inside the small and eclectic venue. With both an industrial and traveler caf\u00e9 feel, the Grilled Cheese Kitchen was vibrant, welcoming and dynamic from the second we arrived. Or maybe I was just delirious with the promise of sharp cheddar, havarti and jack all on a single sandwich for just $6. The sourdough bread was incredible and made up for the fact that the cheese itself wasn't all that flavourful so much as just gooey - not that I'm complaining. Served in a basket with a fresh and juicy apple on the side so that you can pretend to be having a balanced meal, all the frills were saved for the gourmet grilled cheese concoctions themselves rather than frivolous presentation. I mean, I came for cheese, people, not art...\n\nThe fresh soups looked wonderful and a wide beverage menu was ready and waiting. The actual sandwich menu seems to change regularly from what I've seen in other reviews and photos which would be really dangerous if I actually lived here. Instead, I'll save it as a special treat whenever I'm on the west coast - or maybe even as a reason to come. No wait...that would be crazy.\n\n...or would it?\n\nP.S.

I had heard good things going in, but I was still pleasantly surprised.\n\nAmbiance:  It's like any typical sandwich shop, but it has a little something extra.  I can't put my finger on it, but it's ... trendy.  Yes, trendy.  It's got a good thing going for it that makes you enjoy sitting on the patio.  To see and to be seen.  Now if they'd only get heat lamps...\n\nService:  You order and that's that.  Aside from ordering and them bringing you the food, you don't interact with the staff much.  However, if you ask them for help in clearing a table or when asking them about the menu, they're likely to be nice and accommodating. \n\nFood:  I ended up getting a sandwich called the Jalapeno Popper.  It was beyond good.  It was spicy, yet cheesy; subtle yet intense; calming yet exciting (grin).  I also liked that for a change-of-pace default, the sandwich came with a side of fruit instead of chips (in my case grapes).  \n\nFor a drink option, today was the first day that they had some sort of strawberry/grapefruit/lemonade blend.  My mom said it was sweet, my dad said it was tart.  I ended up getting a grapefruit-infused homemade soda that was REALLY good.  I suggest you look for it if you ever go, but from what I can tell the soda options change daily.\n\nIn the end, it was a place that I'd like to visit again.

I chose the Piglet (made with Tillamook sharp cheddar, ham, apple mustard, rosemary butter) and Smoky Tomato Soup.\n\nTHE PIGLET - Yeah, it was delightfully cheesy - and yeah, it was tasty.  But how hard was it really to make this?  For $8 for a whole sandwich, that is a bit steep in my opinion.  I was anticipating more shock and magic, I suppose.\n\nSMOKY TOMATO SOUP - The only soup I really enjoy is tomato.  However, what I don't like is tart tomato soup.  Sadly, I prefer the Soup Co's Tomato Bisque over this \"smoky\" rendition. \n\nLastly, I made the mistake of ordering their homemade Blackberry Lemonade.  Boy was this acidic!

The grilled cheeses, to give credit where it's due, are very good. The cheese pun chalkboard by the register will inspire a chuckle.

I have no issue with the quality of the food, but I've never filled up here, and for the price I definitely expected to. \n\nThe thing that really puts this place solidly in two-star territory is the service. If you get there outside of peak times, with maybe two or three other people waiting, you can still expect to wait 15-20 minutes. Maybe they have a six inch by six inch grill that can only cook one sandwich at a time, I really have no idea how they can stretch the wait out this long. As some other folks have said the employees really couldn't care less, which is fine for a sandwich shop, but again, not one that charges this much.

We found some seats (after a few minutes of waiting) right in front of the window into the kitchen. My boyfriend noticed that at least one person handling food was not wearing gloves, which isn't the hugest deal if they keep their hands clean and don't touch anything else, but it was so fast paced I had trouble seeing what was going on. They also seem to pre-make their sandwiches and just grill them once ordered, so maybe the gloves things isn't so bad when you consider they're not actually handling all the ingredients, but rather just plopping sandwiches onto a tray?

I don't love paying for something I make just as well at home.  Le sigh.  \n\nI had been wanting to check out TAGCK (is acronyming the name a thing? it should be) since it first opened many years ago, but never made it to the area during business hours.  So when 2 friends from LA were in town for the day and said they wanted to check this place out I was so excited that now was finally my chance!\n\nWell, I clearly picked the wrong people to go with because between the 3 of us it was decided we'd split two sandwiches and a bowl of the tomato soup.  We went with the classics: Moustrap and the mac and cheese sandwich.  Both sounded great, but I really should've ventured lower on the menu to try something more unique and worth the extra cost of having someone else grill your cheese for you.  \n\nSo the sandwiches were tasty, no doubt, but not necessarily phenomenal grilled cheese.  I've made larger grilled cheeses at home, with the same great cheesy taste, for way less money so it's not something I could justify ordering ever again (not just from a cost standpoint, but from a unique standpoint).  I would've thrown some bacon in the mix, but my two accompanists eat kosher, so that would not have flown.  In all, while quite tasty, I would never order either of these two again because I can make them just as well in my home kitchen.  \n\nOn another note, we asked if our 2 sandwiches could be cut in thirds, the woman behind the register replied \"sure, no problem\", but alas, they came out only cut in halves.  While I don't feel the need to fault them for something like this, it'd be nice if she had said they couldn't do that or if they could've honored our request.  \n\nI'm a fan of what this place does and serves, but it's so out of my way now that I don't think the novelty of a grilled cheese restaurant makes up for the lack of originality and affordability of these sandwiches.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

If you're in the mood for a lighter lunch, then these sandwiches would be perfect but I would recommend getting one with meat because more likely than not you will get hungry within the hour of your last bite.  Remember that the tomato soup is soup and not bisque so it isn't as creamy.

Parking looked ok, especially if you headed down South Park and parked near Townsend.

The Husband ordered the Mushroom Gruyere. The Mousetrap was cheesy and sharp and the bread was perfectly buttered and toasted. I can imagine it being fantastic with some tomato soup (which I unfortunately didn't order, although they had it). The Mushroom Gruyere was extremely hearty and filling because of the potatoes they put in. It was great with some hot sauce.\n\nRed Delicious apples (I don't know why they're called delicious when they're the worst-tasting apples in the world, probably) came with our sandwiches.

The variety of different flavors of grilled cheese is pretty impressive, ranging from stinky cheese to old classics. All comes with an elegant tangerine, ready to cleanse your palate once you get your dose of dairy goodness.\n\nThe cheesy puns are well documented on this here site, but my personal favorite this time was \"brie-will, brie-will, rock you\".\n\nThis place makes you glad Wisconsin laid the groundwork for the wide acceptance of cheese in this country.", "author": "Andre L."}

A restaurant dedicated to just  grilled cheese? Say What? Time for a pit stop! =P\n\nThis place is located on a quiet street. Away from the hustle and bustle of Market street. The interior is small, very clean and industrial with limited seating because they only have stools and bars. For more leg room, you can sit at the patio seating outside. \n\nMenu consists of....of course grilled cheese sammies! With a few soups and salads. They also have some baked goods too. At the time we arrived it was brunch so we ordered the Farmer's Breakfast ($5.50), which is a sammie with sharp cheddar, roasted potatoes, bacon, egg and chive butter.  Was really good! And the sandwich was pretty sizable. I  had split it, but would have been very full if I ate the whole thing. The bread was grilled wonderfully and was crunchy. Love the potatoes too. Also had a ham and chive biscuit ($2.50)! Delish. Ham pieces were generous.  \n\nRegular grilled cheese sandwiches range from $8 to $9. And there are a variety of different options to try. A neat place to stop by if you are in the area!", "author": "Julie L."}

I'm going with 4 stars, mainly because we showed up at 11:20 and didn't have to wait in a line (note to potential diners: the line seemed to appear out of thin air at 11:45).  \n\nSo while I admit it was damn good, I did feel a little silly about paying $10 for a meal my gramma would make me for free.

Suffice it to say I've been to this place enough times to have formulated an opinion about it.\n\nThe grilled cheese is good, there's no doubt about that. But does it live up to the hype? I don't think so.\n\nThe best things? Staff is pretty friendly, the mushroom gruyere is delicious, the lunch special that comes with soup, the piece of fruit is a nice touch. The breakfast sandwiches are yummy with the egg.\n\nThe things I'm not a huge fan of: The price is a bit expensive for what it actually is. The place is pretty small and the patio gets really overrun. The line is super long (not their fault, but still) at lunchtime and perhaps the worst parts for me: They take fifteen years (ok, 20 minutes) to make a grilled cheese sometimes. I can make one while drunk in 5 minutes. What's the deal? Also, this is not a place for the health conscious. Of course grilled cheese is never healthy, but you can leave one of these on a stack of napkins one inch thick and let it sit for a little and those napkins will be soaked through with grease.

You would think you could grill up cheese sandwiches faster... After we placed our order, it seriously took like 20-25 minutes to get our sandwiches. Clearly, this is NOT fast food. I will say that the servers were extremely nice. They served us our smoky, tomato soup first. When they saw that we were splitting the soup, they happily split it into two bowls and added extra cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. When our sandwiches finally came half an hour later, they offered to give us a fresh, hot bowl of soup so that we could dip our sandwiches into it (My friend had eaten all of hers; I had saved some soup, but it was cold).\n\nThe tomato soup did have a smoky flavor, but the consistency was too thin for my liking. I missed the heartier, thicker consistency and it was not my favorite tomato soup. Out of the two sandwiches, I liked the mushroom gruy\u00e8re more. It was served on sourdough bread with mushrooms, sliced potatoes, caramelized onions and fontina and gruy\u00e8re cheese. My friend wasn't a big fan of the potatoes in the sandwich, but I liked the extra \"meat-like\" feeling of the sandwich. My only complaint was that I couldn't taste the gruy\u00e8re cheese and I was missing that sharp, swiss cheese flavor. Friend got the mousetrap, which was sharp cheddar, havarti and monterey jack cheese. That sandwich didn't strike me as anything unique and I felt like I could have made it in my own house.

In the case of American Grilled Cheese Kitchen, you can if it's WAY too oily. The sandwiches here are beyond heavy, which may appeal to some people, but it's definitely too much for my stomach.\n\nMushroom Gruyere = Tasty, but like I said, extremely oily and buttery. I could only eat half the sandwich before I started feeling the onset of a sudden heart attack.\n\nTomato Soup = Not very good at all. In fact, the tomato soup here tastes almost exactly like canned Campbell's Tomato Soup, which isn't bad if you're paying 99 cents for a canned soup, but definitely not worth it at a restaurant.\n\nI mean, the flavor of the grilled cheese isn't bad at all -- you can't terribly mess up any dish that uses cheese and butter as the foundation.

I don't even need to tell you how good these sandwiches are, but I will. They just oozed, and goozed, with cheesy goodness!! It's warm and creamy and then dipping it in the tomato soup elevated each bite to the next level. The soup stays mouth-blowing hot to the very end!

The second one would have been the mac-n-cheese grilled cheese- I die!  Since I was on vacation I was able to partake in the $4 mimosas, and they were filled to the top in a pretty big glass (thumbs up).  I like the fact that you get a small apple with your order; it soaks up the greasy goodness.  If you want to check this place out, be conscious of the lunch rush, and you can always order in advance.

I have an unhealthy obsession with all foods derivative from children's menus (actually I'm not kidding; also I don't eat vegetables ... so kid's meal anything is normally right up my alley) and a close friend who lives above AGCK who loves to get hangover brunch here and rub it in my face.  \n\nSo, on one rare occasion when I was working from my company's office by the Embarcadero (I normally work out of the south bay) I decided to check it out.  I met a friend here around 1:15 PM, but even then, the line was about 10-15 minutes long just to order.  The food was relatively fast to arrive, but I wouldn't say it was categorically speedy.  My friend & I were lucky to get a table; there is limited seating but supply probably always exceeds demand.\n\nI'm not going to go so far as to say I didn't like the food -- it's honestly difficult to ruin something as magical as a grilled cheese and tomato soup -- but for the price & wait I didn't think it nearly lived up to the hype.  I paid probably close to $15 including tax for a soup + sandwich, which is actually kind of outrageous given how simple it all was.  \n\nIn my humble opinion basically the rating boils down to how long we waited even after what I'd consider peak lunch hour and the fact that a sandwich place without waiter service really just should not have 2 $$s on yelp.

There's a whole lot of that action happening at The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen. I tried the red, white and blue plate special, which is a half grilled cheese of your choice and a cup of soup. They have amazing homemade sodas--today I tried the pineapple coconut and I also tasted the blackberry lemonade.  The piglet grilled cheese was solid, but I have a feeling some of the other choices are even more mind blowing. Didn't get much flavor out of the apple mustard.

I stumbled across The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen on Yelp, so you guessed it, we stopped by for some grilled cheese sandwiches!  I know, I know, grilled cheese sandwiches may not be the healthiest choice, but you only live once and might as well indulge. :)\n\nI couldn't help but get the mushroom Gruyere sandwich because I LOVE mushrooms!  This sandwich includes a wild mushroom mix, Gruyere, fontina, gold potatoes, leeks, caramelized onions, and thyme butter.  Man!  This grilled cheese sandwich was delicious!  The bread was perfectly fried, it was crunchy on the edges, soft in the middle, and it wasn't drenched with grease.  It was a very rich sandwich, but so worth it.  There is something about grilled cheese sandwiches that have the capability of making the kid in everyone sooo happy.  It even inspires me to make my own creative and delicious grilled cheese sandwiches at home!\n\nI also tried one of their house sodas, coconut pineapple.  Lately, I've been in the mood for anything with coconut.  It was a great thirst quencher and I thought it went beautifully with the grilled cheese.  I also love pineapple, so really it was the perfect drink for me.  And I didn't think it was too sweet either, which made it even better because I hate going from something really sweet to something really salty.\n\nI can't wait to go to my next Giants game because I will definitely be stopping here before I head to AT&T park to try another sandwich!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE cheese. I actually have nightmares about becoming lactose intolerant, that's how much I love cheese. So needless to say, a visit to this place was long overdue.\n\nI had a chance to come here for lunch which seems to be the busiest time. Sing they don't have a huge indoor/outdoor seating area, I suggest you try to arrive before 11:45. Worst case scenario tho, South Park is just around the corner and you can always eat there.\n\nNow to the food!\n\nTheir menu consists of various types of grilled cheese sandwiches. Different toppings and cheese on each one. They've got the obligatory tomato soup to go with the grilled cheese (because that is CLASSIC!) but also things like the Jalapeno Popper Grilled Cheese which has bacon and a jalapeno relish on it. I went with this one and was encouraged to try their pickles. I also got a side salad.\n\nTheir sandwiches are pretty big. I went rather hungry and after eating half (and some of my pickles) I was getting full. The sandwich was very good with a nice sweet hotness that you expect with jalapenos. My only complaint was that not all the cheese was melted. Granted, it was their busiest time (lunch) and there were a lot of people there. But I was slightly disappointed only because this was a grilled cheese kitchen after all, was it not?! They should have this down to a science.\n\nSo overall I'd give it 3.5 stars.

Score!\n\nThe menu was limited to one grilled cheese sandwich, with a mix of add-in's: bacon, jalape\u00f1os, tomatoes.\n\nI ordered mine with bacon and jalape\u00f1o--two of my favorite foods! I figured this grilled cheese would be delicious, but a couple bites in, I was sorely disappointed. \n\nThe bacon was tough and overcooked. The jalape\u00f1os were fresh--always preferable to the vinegar-y canned jalape\u00f1os--but not nearly spicy enough. The cheese was gooey, but greasy. The bread was very greasy and pretty tough. This sandwich had all the fixin's for greatness, but it fell flat. I suspect it was the pressure of cooking orders for hordes of hungry hipsters outdoors that kept my sandwich from greatness. \n\nOn the plus side, the peach lemonade they were serving was fantastic.

How does one make grilled cheese something so delicious? I pondered this thought for minutes until I realized my grilled cheese was finished.

I have NO idea how they pull it off but this place makes the most amazing grilled cheese - came back and brought a few of my friends and they whole heartedly agreed with me.

I had been wanting to check this place out so I'm glad that I had the opportunity to do so! It's located near the ballpark so that's a plus (especially if you don't want to spend money on over-priced foods inside the ballpark). There are tables outside which you can use for your dining pleasures. \n\nThe place itself is a small eatery, but it's well acquainted with a nice, size kitchen and dining area inside. The AGCK offers a limited menu of different types of grilled cheese that range from your average grilled cheese to a turkey club grilled cheese sandwich. From what I can remember, there's about 7-8 items to choose from, more or less. All the menu items look so appetizing so it's hard to choose one. I ordered the turkey club grilled cheese which was about $8. To me, I thought that was a little too overpriced for such a simple sandwich. But I guess the sandwiches have to be priced that way because of the limited space the restaurant has and/or the gourmet ingredients the chefs use. \n\nSo all of us ordered our food and sat outside the restaurant at one of their outside tables. We waited for about 15-20 minutes for our food to come out. I don't know why it took so long for our sandwiches to come out but it's okay (the place was busy in the first place). So we finally got our sandwiches and I noticed that all of the grilled cheeses come with a nectarine! I have never seen that before! I was a little surprised, but happy :) My turkey club grilled cheese looked very delicious. The chefs used sourdough bread for my sandwich (which I love) and the bread had the right amount of carmelization to give a nice, crusty look. My grilled cheese was a pretty, good size sandwich; if it wasn't a nice size sandwich, I would of wasted $8.00! :-/ \n\nMy first bite of my sandwich was pretty good. I was thoroughly impressed with the crunchiness of the bacon, the moistness of the turkey meat, and the gooy-ness of the sharp Cheddar cheese. All of the flavors of this hearty sandwich was everything that I had hoped for in a sandwich. This sandwich was worth every penny and it definitely filled me up. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a quick bite before heading off to the ballpark. Oh! The restaurant even has a few beers on tap! As well as various beverages to choose from. \n\nI'm so glad that I came here with my bf and his friends :) I just wish there was a place like this in San Jose!!!", "author": "Francesca H."}

Hands down - let's go gourmet! \n\nWe ordered the piglet and the mushroom grilled cheese sandwich and took it with us to the game. Not cheap sandwiches folks. At almost $7 to $9 a sandwich these things better be good. \n\nPopped open the containers while waiting for the game to start and was blown away by the first bite of the mushroom sandwich. Damn good stuff there. It reminded me biting into a mushroom pizza for some reason. Reality hit me only when I tasted the thin sliver of potato that this was a grilled cheese sandwich. The bread was buttered just right to get that perfect crunch. How good was this sandwich? Good enough to make me feel justified paying $9 for a meatless sandwich - that's how good...=0) \n\nThe piglet was good but not as good as the mushroom in my opinion.

My friend's one year old had a marvelous time eating his first ever PB & J - I'm only afraid that he is now spoiled for the Jif/Smuckers variety!  And truth be told, if I were not already so full from the 3 sandwiches we shared, I would have snuck a taste from the baby.  Yes, I have neither pride nor scruples when it comes to food.\n\nDo check out the daily drink specials - I had a Tart Cherry soda that was fantastic.\n\nThere is seating, which I was not expecting - a little bit inside, and some nice tables outside.

Unless you work nearby, you can only go here on a lunch break if you don't really care about your job security.

My concerns - and more - were realized when I made the maiden voyage on Friday 2/25.\n\nAlthough the line moved swiftly (10 minutes to order), I was shocked to have the person at the register reject my simple request of swtiching the bread on my selection.  I was told the sandwiches are all premade so this request could not be accomodated.  A couple of questions immediately came to mind: 1) I asked for bread to be replaced, not an intricate surgery session of removing several items within the sandwich itself; and, 2) am I the only person in San Francisco that doesn't like sourdough?  \n\nFollowing this initial disappointment, we then were relegated to outdoor seating since TAGCR can only seat about 15 people in their space.  Mind you, last week was not the week to be sitting ourdoors in San Francisco (sadly, my blood has thinned since moving to the City).  The good news was that we had heavy coats, but was extremely disappointing was that my fiancee and I then waited 25 minutes to have our grilled cheese sandwiches delivered.  25 minutes for grilled cheese?  Even better, 25 minutes for pre-made grilled cheese sandwiches?  You cannot have it both ways - argue that sandwiches need to be pre-made to handle the lunch crowd, then have a miserable turnaround time.\n\nThe server apologized and offered us a free cookie.  Sadly (for the restaurant), we were not the only ones who waited for lunch on Friday - it seemed to be a very consistent theme as we watched other patrons become increasingly frustrated by the turnaround time.\n\nThe sandwiches themselves?

If you don't want to wait in a line, THEN DONT WAIT IN A G-D LINE.  It's so simple.  Is it the American Grilled Cheese Kitchen's fault that they got a bunch of awesome press and make delicious kitschy treats (a winning combination for hungry SoMa yopro's)?  NO.  Seriously, if yr gonna bitch about waiting in a line, there's a place 2 blocks away that's the definition of fast -- starts with Mc, ends with Donalds.\n\nAlso.  Why are people bitching about there being \"too much butter\"?   1)  They don't use too much butter, 2)  How is it possible to use too much butter??  Butter makes it better fools.  \n\nAnyhow.  That's enough complaining.  Now to sing the praises of THE BEST GRILLED CHESSE SANDWICH i've ever had.  \n\nI, like all the other SoMa yopros, got totally excited by all the great press this joint received pre-launch, and four coworkers and I headed here as soon as it opened to see what all the fuss was about.\n\nWe of course encountered the line (duh), and were totally cool waiting for the 30 or so minutes it took to get in.  The staff were really nice while we waited, offering up samples and giving out free pickles to make the wait go by more quickly.  \n\nThe sandwiches all looked amazing but I decided to go with jalapeno popper because what could possibly be better than chevre and bacon?  The answer:  nothing.  Such a great sandwich, the mix of chevre, jack, two thick slices of bacon and their amazing apricot-jalapeno relish was divine!  It could have been slightly spicier, but given how sensitive reviewers of this place have been thus far, spice would probably have upset their delicate sensibilities.  \n\nI also got a side salad and some of their house-made pomegranate spice soda, both of which were delicious.  Honestly, I would wait half an hour just to get the soda again it was so good.

The wait - chill out friends! it's already dying down significantly, so this highly publicized pain point soon become moot. Also, having worked in SOMA for some years now, HELL YES we will line up outside a new lunch establishment.

There's something new, hence we're psyched. But it'll regulate itself soon. \n\n2. The sammys - what they say is true, I'm afraid. Portions are just this side of wanting, with a little too much butter (drip drip) and just barely enough of the bread and cheese. That said, it's still pretty damned delicious, and you can bet that on a rainy day I will happily head across the street for their comfort food delights, $8 bucks or otherwise. \n\n3. The other eats - I tried out my friend's bread pudding, and it was SUPER yummy. If i wasnt such a purist (hello its the grilled cheese kitchen) i woulda ordered it myself. Maybe next time. Also chocolate chip cookies are decent and the butterscotch brownie freakin ROCKS. I wasnt even interested til the free sample, then suddenly i'm stalking the free sample guy. That's what you get for giving out dessert morsels senor! \n\n4. The service - kitchen's still working out the kinks, and the counter staff/free sample guy are kind of high gear hospitality robots (this always kinda freaks me out but it beats the nonchalant hipster alternative), but over all the vibe is cheerful and accommodating.

AGCK preps all of their sandwich materials the day before, so they will actually sell out of menu items.  This was the case when I arrived 20 minutes before closing.   Two sandwiches were available:  Feta Tomato, and Reuben.  I wanted soup, so I opted for the Feta Tomato.  As others have noted, there's a hefty spread of tapenade on this sandwich.  Good thing I like olives :-)  The soup came with homemade croutons, and tasted exactly like tomato soup should -- just a little creamy, just a little sour, and all tomato.\n\nMy restaurant gold standard for tomato soup and grilled cheese is the Tomato Bisque at Sauce, which comes with truffled grilled cheese.

Part of the appeal of a grilled cheese is the simplicity. \n\nThat said, it was a delicious, crusty, buttery, cheesy delight and I cannot wait to come back and try some of the others.\n\nIt is important to note that I have officially placed AGCK ahead of Paragon on my list of \"world's best grilled cheese sandwiches\" (currently the only two contenders), mainly because the bread is more manageable and doesn't destroy the roof of my mouth.\n\nWell done American Grilled Cheese Kitchen!", "author": "Carrie W."}

I used to work in this area but sadly our office moved before this cute little shop opened up.  I made a point of going over to it to have lunch while out biking in the SOMA area.\n\nFirst off, this place is small and therefore it will fill up fast. I went in at 11:58 am on a Saturday and it was busy but I was served quickly... and then 15 people came in behind me!  I think they've got a good reputation going around so a lot of people head over around lunch.  The tables inside and out were full, which I didn't mind since I planned on going over to the park anyway.\n\nTo my dismay, the menu only has 5 or 6 sandwiches on it, if that.  There wasn't even half the variety I would have expected from a restaurant advertising itself as specializing in grilled cheese.  In comparison, my tiny little cookbook has at least 30 GC recipes in it.  I really hope they'll look to expand their menu here.  To their benefit though, the sandwiches they do have listed look amazing.\n\nI ordered the Mushroom Gruyere sandwich, figuring I'd take a chance on mushrooms and potatoes (seriously, there's potatoes in this sandwich!!)  Second drawback to this place: I know they were busy, but wow, what a long wait time to get my food!  Eventually they did get it out to me and I headed over to South Park with it to relax, soak in the sun, and enjoy my sandwich.\n\nAnd damn, enjoy I did!  The mix of potatoes and minced mushroom blended so well together, I was floored by it.  To be honest, I'd actually forgotten there was potato in the sandwich until I took a bite and had a pleasant surprise by the flavour and texture.  My takeout container also came with a very juicy apple, a great side to my sandwich.\n\nI've read a few reviews that say the sandwiches are small and over-priced.  Honestly, I couldn't finish mine.  I could see it being not enough for someone with a hearty appetite, but I had more than my fill out of it and I'd been biking around SOMA for a few hours (so I was pretty hungry by the time I got lunch).  Price-wise, it's on par for the area.  I paid $12 for my sandwich and drink, which is what I'd expect for most of the lunch meals in the SOMA area.\n\nI would definitely go back and would love to try the soup and some of the other sandwiches.  I think they would benefit from increasing their menu, speeding up their serve time and getting more seating space, but the food is worth checking this place out, at least once.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

Like how a few years ago hot dog restaurants  got all popular. This is the grilled cheese version. MMMM grilled cheese....\n\nIt is my personal opinion that nothing tastes better in this world than a nice piece of good quality toasted bread with good butter on it. That exact combo is the building block of a grilled cheese! \n\nWhat says grilled cheese more than hoards of Giants fans fresh off their high of watching the World Series winners roll down Market St. in their cable cars? Just ask the fans standing on second Street with open bottles of champagne, what would you like for lunch? I bet they all say 'Grilled Cheese!!' because they were all eating here!\n\nOk ok I just wanted an excuse to write about all the Giants fans swarming the streets near my place of employment.\n\nBack to the food. it really was tasty. I agree with some of the other posters, a little on the small side. Not much meat. but enough. One of the problems in this country is redonkulous portion sizes. You won't find that here. But you will find that the portion is enough. It's perfect sized. Yes, it's a little expensive but you're eating 2 blocks away from Giants stadium in the financial/South of Market area.... nothing here is inexpensive except for lees deli and that mexican place over on 4th. Prices here are on par with everyplace else in this neighborhood.\n\nBTW for .50c extra you can get your grilled cheese on home made gluten free bread! That's a real plus for those with gluten allergies as it's really challenging to find gluten free options usually.\n\nThings I liked about this place:\n\nGrilled cheeses - several variety/combo of sandwiches. I had the Don something with Sopressata salami and pesto. Excellent!\nThe cute little apple that comes as a side\nThe home-made 'sodas' today I had a blueberry lemon soda - also excellent!\nNice feel\nGood 'green' practices\nDonates all uneaten apples that come with every lunch to a local food kitchen\nGLUTEN FREE BREAD!!!\n\n\nMinus one star because when I bit into the apple there was a nasty old bruise in it.

But, today, they started being opening on Saturdays and they were open from 12-4. We got there just after 12 and the line was already 15 people deep.\n\nWe were not surprised by the line and it was not a big deal because we expected it. We ordered a Wild Turkey and a Windy City for the two of us. They were awesome. As far as taste, they really have nailed it. They have a good thing going here and it doesn't seem like they are one of those companies that opens and closes within the same month. \n\nI would give them a full 5 stars for taste alone, but there are a couple things I was a little surprised about that make me take one star away. I was a little surprised at the prices. I understand; they are in SOMA where their lease is expensive so they at least have to cover that. But, consider what you are selling, a grilled cheese and grapes. That should never cost $9, no matter where your restaurant is. I was also kind of surprised that everything was pre-made and then baked to make sure the cheese melted and bread toasted. \n\nI am glad we came here once. The owners are cool and like to talk to their customers. I would probably come again, but probably not until I have another craving for a grilled cheese.", "author": "Michael C."}

So it'd be hard to find someone who doesn't have fond memories of grilled cheese sandwiches as a kid, and in SOMA, near South Park in the heart of the land of hipsters and technies, everyone has a visceral reaction to the thought of an eatery specializing in grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\nThe place was co-founded by Heidi Gibson, who is not only a former software developer, but a seven-time winner of the Grilled Cheese Invitational in LA. With that background, opening up a place like this makes perfect sense.\n\nSo, everyone knows about the hype. Everyone knows about the long-ass line. So, does the food live up?\n\nI got the Jalape\u00f1o Popper. Just what one would expect. Spicy peppers, but not very hot, with creamy chevre, and some monterey jack and bacon (apple-smoked) to give it some structure. Delicious combo. All the sandwiches use country-style levain bread (there is a gluten-free option) grilled to buttery crunchiness. It was good enough to make me feel it'd be worth coming back to try the others.  One observation on the menu is that I would like to have seen a classic sandwich on wonder bread and american cheese. One should always pay tribute to one's roots. The sandwich also comes with some fresh red grapes. (If they put it in a paper sack with a carton of milk and ritz crackers and cheese handi-snack and you'd have something.)\n\nThe restaurant is small, about 20 can fit inside, 30 outside. Excellent selection of craft sodas (try one of the two sodas for the day!), and there's an assortment of non-sandwiches, such as chips, soups, salad, etc. Service was exceptionally friendly. And for further goodness, almost everything is compostable/recyclable/reusable.\n\nSome suggestions. Come Early!! I got there at 11:20, and the wait was tolerable.

It was definitely good enough to buy. Though I still believe it's a little on the expensive side at $7-10 per sandwich, it's quality enough that I'll forgive the expensive price tag. Had the farmer's breakfast -- sharp cheddar, roasted potatoes, bacon, egg, and chive butter....mmm...sooo delicious. The potatoes were a nice touch and who doesn't love some good bacon and eggs? The tomato soup was flavorful and smooth as well. A nice complement to a delicious grilled cheese. \n\nWhat really sold me on this place was their special that day however: dungeness crab mac and cheese with bacon. Bacon, crab, and mac n' cheese?!? not only did they combine three of my favorite things, they did it so well that I could probably have eaten three of those. The mac n' cheese had a nice kick to it and was the perfect cheesy consistency. The crab and bacon added a nice touch to it. \n\nWill try lunch next time.

Take it from me, this place rocks. One thing you should know is that despite the name \"Grilled Cheese Kitchen,\" it is not a place for plain simple white bread with melted cheese in the middle. For this, you might want to go to Denny's. I read that they serve grilled cheese sandwich with deep-fried Mozzarella sticks in the middle.\n\nI ate their Breakfast Piglet sandwich with extra bacon. The combination of bacon, ham, farm fresh egg, apple mustard and rosemary butter required no additional seasoning and every ingredient was fresh and you can tell they choose their ingredients with care and passion. Bread was interesting and fresh (bought from a local bakery three blocks away), egg was fresh (hey...I eat pullet eggs bought from the SF Ferry Plaza Petaluma Farms folks that are three days old, so I know fresh eggs.), etc.etc. When I think of comfort food (grilled cheese and/or ham and cheese sandwiches would be categorized as such) and think of theirs, it's fancy comfort food in line with Bouchon's croque madame (they have a slight edge because it's got B\u00e9chamel sauce. Mmmmmm....), Royal Mama's (Croque Madame as well), Tartine Bakery's Croque Mousieur.\n\nSo, in summary, if you want simple plain grilled cheese, yes, you can make it yourself at home (hey, might as well, get the thingy that can burn an image of Jesus on them, why don't you?), or, think of having a fancy upgraded, sophisticated version of it with all the ingredients that are carefully chosen, eat here.", "author": "Yasuo S."}

The first bites of the Mushroom Gruyere, I cannot even describe in words. The bread was perfectly toasted and crispy, yet not too hard to bite into. The buttery goodness of the cheese and the mushrooms, balanced by the subtle flavor of leeks and potatoes (I couldn't really taste the potatoes, but it was damn good anyways!). After a few bites of the Mushroom Gruyere, I decided to try the Moscone. It was good as well, but not nearly as delicious as the mushroom. I suppose it depend what kind of mood you are in, and to me, this sandwich was similar to a mozarella sandwich you would order elsewhere, exept with melted cheese. I think the tomatoes and the pesto were too tart for me, and in my experiences, grilled cheese is just a real comfort food.\n\nI would recommend splitting 2 sandwiches between you and a friend, simply because the flavors of these sandwiches are very strong and rich, and I think I would have gotten tired of the Mushroom Gruyere if I were to have eaten the entire thing.

American Grilled Cheese Kitchen deserves a 3.5 Stars. \n\nThe grill cheese alone is $9 which is pricey since it doesn't come with anything else cept grapes. If it came with a small soup or salad, then it's a great value. With Darwin Cafe only down the street which provides you with an exceptional Sandwich and Salad for $9, American Grill Cheese needs to change their game plan. \n\nI've so far tried:\n\nClub Turkey: with Tillamook sharp cheddar, creamy havarti, Willie Bird smoked turkey, applewood-smoked bacon, Sierra Nevada stout mustard, roasted tomatos, arugula\n\nand\n\nFeta Fetish: Crumbled feta, fontina, roasted eggplant, zucchini, and red bell peppers, italian spices, garlic butter.\n\nThe Club Turkey is pretty decent in it's blend of ingredients...however the Smoked applewood bacon was not crisp whatsoever. If the bacon was crisp, it would provide a much better contrast in texture. It was simply soggy tasting. I would NOT get this again.\n\n\nThe Feta Fetish has a better flavoring than the Club Turkey. The Roasted Eggplant and Zucchini is nice and thick. I'd recommend this one. \n\nI haven't had a chance to try the Mushroom Gruyere OR Jalape\u00f1o Popper but it seems to be popular. I'm not sure if I'd go back to American Grilled Cheese again since it's approx. 5 blocks away from my work and there's many other places in the area that provides a greater value.

Your choice of half sandwich + tomato soup or salad. I picked the Mouse Trap Sandwich made with Tillamook sharp cheddar, creamy havarti, monterey jack, on sourdough. I threw in some bacon (+$1.5) and tomato (+$0.50) for extra flavor. Overall the sandwich was good - warm pressed breads and cheeses with bacon. Really can't go wrong. But they did goof my order. I had asked for a half and they charged me for a whole, which meant that I also didn't get the country wheat bread I wanted in place of the sourdough. But they kindly refunded me some dollars for the mistake.\n\nTomato Soup - I was expecting a creamier thicker consistency than what I was served. This version was more tangy and thin. Obvious tomato but a lighter kind. I think if you're going to be eating heavy cheeses and buttered breads, might as well balance with some thick tomato soup too so you don't lose the flavor. The buttered croutons that come with the soup was a nice touch though.\n\nI also had a bite of the Don Gondola ($8), made with aged provolone, sopressatta salami, roasted tomato, pesto, garlic butter. This had nice Italian flavor.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Bread Pudding. It tasted like thick French Toast with bourbon-sugar sauce. Flavorful from the bourbon but less like the traditional bread puddings I'm used to that have some raisins and fruit.\n\nThe housemade Tart Black Cherry Soda ($3) was tasty though. Liked the option of these fresh sodas.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food though I find that it could be better. Finding a table is a challenge due to limited seating outside. Expect long lines at lunch.

We stood in line, no big deal.\n\nI ordered the piglet sandwich, tomato soup and a lemonade. It was greasy, I mean it is grilled cheese, but it was also pretty small and boring. I think grilled cheese chef's who compete like TAGCK one's do, miss the entire point of a classic american grilled cheese sandwich. They overcomplicate to differentiate and forget about the customers who have to eat it.\n\nThe sandwiches are too expensive for the portion and for the so-so flavor.\n\nThe tomato soup is a joke. I actually laughed, as someone who's be religiously eating tomato soup since they were a child, I'd like to think I know a thing or two about consistency, flavor and texture. Don't order the tomato soup here, go to The Grove or Axis Cafe (Axis is likely the best in the city).\n\nThe piglet was 'meh', and I may squeal if I have to eat it again.\n\nGrilled cheese is grilled cheese, plain and simple.

I like making them, and I like eating them. I'm excited that there is an actual restaurant dedicated to grilled cheese sandwiches, a food as American as our national bird (it's the Bald Eagle, isn't it?). I don't really know who these people are, but they have quite a place on their hands. \n\nWalking in for the first time was pretty cool... little things on the wall were arranged in a nostalgic way. I saw a picture of some kid on the wall only to realize that it was the guy behind the counter. It reminded me of a home... a kitchen! Everyone working there looked like they were having fun. The woman who took my order was very nice, and after every sandwich I ordered said that they were her favorite ones. I got the mushroom gruyere, and my friend got the jalapeno popper. The mushroom gruyere was everything I dreamed of (and more! I love mushrooms! And cheese!). I was bummed that it didn't have carmelized onions as it said it did on the website, but I did find out they changed it to have potatoes instead (and it was also listed on the website later when I checked).. and it was still delicious! The thyme butter? Ahh, to die for. The jalapeno popper was also delicious... once you bit into it, it was sweet, and then it had a bit of a spice to it. It had bacon in it, too! Divine!\n\nAs for drinks, they have your usual fare, but they also have house made sodas and passionfruit lemonade. That day their special soda was a grapefruit pink peppercorn flavor. Interested, I tried it... and I have to say it was good for the first two sips, but after that I was over it. Sorry to say! I really wanted to like it! \n\nSitting at the counter was absolute torture... not only to watch other people get their food, but also to see the food come out of the kitchen. I also sat nearby the pot of tomato soup and it smelled so good that I wished I got a half soup/sandwich deal. I will definitely try it again!\n\nThat's right... I'm coming back. There's a lot of things there I want to try. And I don't care if I have to wait in a long line to get anything. This place is well worth it. Although, you should probably try to come before the rush because it does get busy. But they move really quickly there.

However, the streets were packed and I had to park a block or two away.\n\nThe restaurant seemed crowded, but that is mostly because it is small and dense. I arrived around 2:00 and waited only about 10 minutes for my sandwich.\n\nThe variety of sandwiches are pretty basic. They don't seem to have many frills added to them or on the side but you can buy kettle chips. They also don't carry mainstream beverages or a soda fountain. I had a Mouse Trap. It was crispy, and had lots and lots of cheese oozing out of it. It was delicious if maybe a tad more expensive than a grilled cheese sandwich should be.

I was really excited about this trendy little restaurant; it made my SF to-do list... and that is a big deal because my California trip was primarily made up of restaurants.\n\nThe food was pretty good, but I had much higher expectations.  If you're going to charge me $9 for a pressed spoiled milk and refined flour product, it better be dang good.\n\nI was worried because I was not that hungry, but I wanted a sandwich and the special mac-n-cheese.  It is kind of annoying that they do not do half sandwiches, but it does not matter because a whole is really small anyway.  $9 will not completely fill you up; it comes with an apple... a small apple.\n\nThe Jalapeno Popper had slightly soggy bacon, mediocre apricot-jalapeno relish, and not enough cheese!  The goat flavor stood out, and the sandwich had a prominent kick, but if you are going to call yourself The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen, there better be cheese on my chin.  There was not.  The bread was good and crusty, though.\n\nThe gluten-free mac-n-cheese was solid.  It was flavorful, creamy, and rich.  I prefer my gluten, but in this case, eating without the risk of gluten intolerance made my meal even better...

The breads were well toasted -- nice crust, crisp but not too hard.  The ham was thickly sliced -- you could tell it was not shaved processed deli ham, but more grain in the meat (more toothsome), and the gruyere was deliciously melted.  Tomato soup was delicious & the toasted croutons are nicely seasoned & add a crunch and some texture to the soup.

I only tried two sandwiches, the Mousetrap and the Jalepeno Popper, and I have to say, the apricot relish in the Popper is delicious. I spent the first few bites trying to figure out what that extra flavor was, and upon the discovery of apricot, I was hooked. Surprisingly, it meshes very nicely with grilled cheese and bacon. The Mousetrap was good for a classic grilled cheese. Another highlight is the tomato soup which comes with crunchy-ass croutons.

Just one couple ahead of us, and the only delay in our order was our own indecisiveness.  I tossed a coin between the Piglet and the Jalapeno Popper, ending up with the latter, and non-pork-eating sweetie chose the Mushroom Gruyere.  A soup to share and one of each housemade soda varieties rounded out our meal.\n\nThe sodas:  delish.  Loved the Grapefruit - Pink Peppercorn (damn you Heidi & Nate...you've stolen the secret to one of my favorite flavor combinations!), and Cherry was also quite nice.  Flavorful, not too sweet - perfect accompaniment to grilled cheese.\n\nI love smoked paprika, and the Tomato Soup made me smile - its unique, bold, and about as far as you can get from Campbell's.  This fact, which pervades both the menu and the restaurant's overall vibe, is what makes AGCK special:  it has succeeded at imbuing a sense of handcrafted quality to foods (and beverages) which, let's face it, we hold dear for mostly sentimental reasons.  AGCK wouldn't have lines down the street if they were serving grandma's Kraft singles on Wonder bread and a can of Coke, and critics miss the point when that becomes their basis for comparison.\n\nI loved my Jalapeno Popper - chevre is a perfect compliment to the sweet/spicy relish and savory bacon, and the proportions of ingredients were just right.  Sweetie's Mushroom Gruyere was rich, complex, and hearty...he actually said there was maybe \"too much filling\".  I disagreed as I leaned over to nibble the melty goodness oozing out the sides.  Neither of us found our sandwiches too greasy or buttery.  \n\nOh and the Butterscotch Brownie, which we gleefully tucked away for later?  Delightful. \n\nRegarding the price: we felt it was fair when you consider, as another reviewer did, the quality of ingredients, location, totally compostable servingware, cost of doing business in San Francisco, and the fact that this operation is 100% local.

I happened to walk by on Friday night and found out that they had started to open at nights that had baseball games so I stopped in to try it.\n\nEven though there was no line when I went in to order, I can see why they usually have long times.  The service is incredibly slow!  The sandwiches are pretty much pre-made.  I saw them making them and storing them for the next day and just to grill it took almost 20 minutes!  I guess they are new but also they also don't have the most efficient operations.  There was confusion over who would get the soup.  I got two and had to give one back.  There was also some friction between the workers on who should do what.  \n\nOverall the food was pretty good.  I had spicy jalapeno one, a tomato soup and the pickles.  Don't get the pickles.  I've lived in NYC for several years.  Definitely needs to be way saltier.  Had friends over this morning where we shared the Mousetrap with bacon, the Windy City, the mushroom one and another one of the jalapeno ones and the general consensus was pretty good but completely not worth the price.

A little small, though (for the price, I was expecting something a little more monstrous maybe).  \n\nI do need to come back here for several reasons.  First, they have this housemade gluten bread that looked tastier than the regular bread. Second, they do their own house sodas and that intrigues me.  Third, I want to try a sandwich that does not taste like olives.  \n\nThere's a long line.  I don't know if that's just because it's new or because it's SF, but it took a while.

Would I wait two hours for it though? No. Hell, the twenty five minute wait was barely worth it. But I would wait two hours for a sandwich from the Midwest's Sandwich Mecca and I would laugh in the face of Celiac disease to grab a spot in line and eat a sandwich at Melt any day- that's how good they are. \n\nUnfortunately I can't say the same for American... yet.

The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen takes grilled cheese sandwiches up to the next level.  I ordered the Jalapeno Popper and the Club Turkey last week and while i enjoyed the spicy one, I felt the club turkey fell a little short of my expectations.  Starting with the Jalapeno Popper, if you like a bit of heat in your sandwich, this is an excellent choice as the relish spread gives it just enough fire without causing you to search for a bottle of water.  Jalapeno spread + bacon + cheese = happy customer.  The Club Turkey, on the other hand, while it sounds delicious from the ingredients, was ultimately not that much impressive from any other club turkey at any other sandwich shop.

And the white fontina/gruyere melts just as good as the Mousetrap I had the first time, if not better (melted cheddar can tend to get oily but not so with these cheeses).\n\nThe other issue I had at first was the overly grilled/crusty bread but this time it was softer....just the way I make at home.  Call me crazy but I'd like not to get bleeding gums from a sandwich.  Nice work cooks!\n\nI just wish I had gotten some of the savory bread pudding on the side (with bacon, mmmmm bacon).", "author": "Kevin B."}

I am still in love with a good grilled cheese, but do I need to pay so much for it? Not really. I do understand why though- there are delicious high quality ingredients used, but still only for special occasions. This time I ordered the Turkey Club w/ their Gluten Free bread. The bread was so rich itself, it took up some room in my tummy. They should maybe consider using a tastier/lighter GF bread like Udis since their ingredients are so rich. I also enjoyed the orange they served my sandwich with! Oddly enough they don't serve both ppl's dishes at the same time, so I got mine quickly and my friend didn't get his for awhile, which can make  it a little awkward.

It was raining on and off all morning so it was a nice relief to step into the toasty confines of The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen. Seating inside is limited so you have to grab a bar or window seat as soon as they open up.\n\nThe woman taking orders was friendly and even offered me the combination, which I declined because I was starving and wanted a full size sandwich and soup order of a Don Gondola and Smoky Tomato Soup. Your food is brought to you with a small paper bag of croutons and a small apple. On cold days, a toasty grilled cheese sandwich with hot soup REALLY hits the spot! I agree with the others that the food here is salty, but I can't blame the sandwich since I did order the Don Gondola. The tomato soup would have been just as delicious in a low sodium version, though :).\n\nI also tried their house-made blueberry soda. Next time, I am asking for less ice because it was freezing out and the default amount of ice in all of our cups seemed to be at least half a cup of large ice cubes. Likely nice for a muggy summer day but not during an early winter rainy day.\n\nAs a random note, the couple next to us left a messenger bag under their bar stool. We gave it to one of the servers and he told us the person was likely in the restroom. When we explained that the couple had actually left, his reply was, \"Oh.\" Not quite the response we were looking for, but we left the bag with him anyhow.

Unfortunately all but 3 of their sandwiches had sold out (as well as the brownies) by the time we made it to the front of the line.   It was during their first week of operating though, and I hear this happens less frequently now.  It was helpful that the staff were really friendly; so much so I feel a bit bad giving only 2 stars.\n\nHad the Mushroom Gruyere and Wild Turkey, tomato soup, and the homemade soda.  The Wild Turkey and soda were the highlights.  I also liked that we got clementines with the meal.\n\nOverall, fairly tasty, but ultimately not worth the wait (although I hear the wait is less now as they've improved their operations) and pushing the limit for what I'm willing to pay for a grilled cheese sandwich. However, I drove there specifically to check out the food; it seemed like the other folks there who were there on their lunch break were quite happy with the new addition to the area.", "author": "John H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-19", "description": "I was initially skeptical about this place. While I love grilled cheese sandwiches, I didn't know if a restaurant could serve one worth paying $8 for since homemade ones are so good and easy to make. And second, the whole concept of taking fast food items and calling it \"creative\" by adding gourmet ingredients has been way overdone. The food scene in San Francisco has been too much about taco stands, food trucks, burger joints, and pizza places for far too long. I'm ready for something new and innovative to excite me again and show what a great culinary city this is!! Come on, people!\n\nAnyways, I digress...back to The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen. There was a long and very slow moving line in front of the restaurant (they only have one register and are working on getting another one). At least the staff was friendly and apologetic about the wait.\n\nI ordered their special which included a small Mousetrap Sandwich (Tillamook sharp cheddar, havarti, and monterey jack cheeses) and a cup of Smoky Tomato Soup with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Simple yet tasty. I thought the tomato soup was actually better than their grilled cheese sandwich. The soup was layered with nice flavors, comforting, and relatively light. And in my opinion, a necessary complement to the thick, crusty bread. \n\nMy hubby and I also split the Jalape\u00f1o Popper Sandwich. It was interesting with the bacon, goat cheese, and apricot-jalape\u00f1o chutney, but I preferred the simple grilled cheese with the tomato soup.\n\nSince it had taken so long to get through the line, I figured I also might as well try one of their desserts while I'm here. And as a gal from the South, I always get excited when I see bread pudding on a menu. Their Sweet Buttermilk Bread Pudding with bourbon-butter sauce was delicious. What I enjoyed most was how moist the bread pudding was and how the buttermilk formed these delicate flan-like pieces on top. Makes my mouthwater just thinking about it! \n\n - So was the grilled cheese sandwich worth the 8 bucks? Only of it's served with the tomato soup.\n - Was it worth the 45 minute wait? No, very few things are with so many options in SF.\n - Will I come back? Maybe, but only after they get another register.", "author": "Karin V."}

Why didn't I think of this?\n\nIt's a truth universally acknowledged that grilled cheese is delicious. It is also exceedingly easy to make. You start with bread and cheese, two things I'm pretty sure no one hates. Then you go from there adding anything your hungry heart desires. \n\nThe AGCK has mastered this simple classic by concocting unique combinations using high quality ingredients and serving them in a cool spot. The menu is small but there is something for everyone. I grabbed the Mousetrap (added all the extras) and Cubano so my hubs and I could try half of each. Greasy heaven in a biodegradable to-go container. \n\nI took off a star for how long I had to wait. This isn't really their fault, they are the victim of their own success. But it's a small space with little to no indoor seating/room to stand and the line of young profs was out the door and then some.  My sense was that this is the norm.

After today I can say with utmost certainty that consistency has hit the mark each time, and this place has shot up to nearly the top of my list. It's that awesome.\nEverything fellow Yelpers are saying (at least the ones raving) is true. Butter? Check. Cheese? Check. Grease? Check. But it's so much more than that. Everything they put out of their tiny kitchen tastes perfect every time. \nI usually go for the Piglet and tomato soup, which as others have said is a touch smoky and spicy and the creme fraich tempers the tanginess with a streak of creaminess. I highly recommend dunking each bite of your grilled cheese of choice. This slightly softens the crunchiness of the bread which is cooked to perfection and as one guy said (and fitting given the proximity of the place) \"knocks it out of the park.\" \nTo assuage the guilt I usually share a small house salad, which is perfectly dressed and totally delicious. \nHonestly we all have our own opinions and like different things, but I can't see how anyone can't love this place. To me it has become my favorite lunch spot in the city, hands down and leaves me in a smug after glow each time. RUN, don't walk to the AGCK. You'll need to, after all, to burn off the calories, but if any place is worth it, this is it. \nP.S. - Tried the mac and cheese today and it was the best I've ever had. Perfect creaminess int he cheese, mac was not overly cooked as someone else said, the cheese of course was perfect, and it had the perfect amount of black pepper to give it an extra kick. I guess I'm all about \"comfort food\" these days. Whatever you want to call it to me it is just plain delish.", "author": "Matt H."}

I've been to this place a few times over the past year--and every sandwich I have tried has been so damn good. A little pricey, yes (8-9 bucks for a sandwich)--but damn good. Also--there's no need for additional chips or soup with your sandwich. Those suckers are quite the brick in your stomach. \n\nThe Jalapeno Popper Sandwich has such an assortment of flavor--the best thing about this sandwich is that it is not too spicy, so you can actually taste the sweetness of the apricot and the smoked flavor of the bacon. The sandwich also does not put too much bacon in--which is nice for an already heavy grilled cheese. Contrary explosive name of the sandwich, the flavors are not overpowering, but rather very nicely complement each other. Spicy + Sweet = Delish. \n\nThe Moscone was good, I love anything with a lavender taste--it's a great veggie grilled cheese with mozzarella and greek olive spread.  \n\nThe Mousetrap Sandwich (classic grilled cheese) is just simple, cheesy and awesome. \n\nFunny thing, you can get your sandwiches with gluten free bread here (ha, ha, yuppie SOMA). I guess I have a sandwich place I can take my no flour/no sugar friend to, right? \n\nDon't go during peak lunch hours because you'll have to wait in line forever and a day (duh!).

Waited in line for over 30 minutes (it could have been much worse) and by the time we got to the counter, they were out of all sandwiches except two; the jalapeno popper and the tomato feta. I wasn't too bothered by the running out of food part as I thought it was a testament to the popularity of the place and hence, the food.  I went with the half sandwich and half spicy tomato soup combo. \nI was underwhelmed with both items. The soup lacked the thick and creamy consistency that makes a tomato soup good. The Jalapeno Popper was a disappointment. For this particular item, the apricot preserve within the sandwich was overbearing. I did not taste a hint of jalapeno in the sandwich. Did they just forget about it? Perhaps apricot, bacon and jack would have been more apt of a name. My thinking is that If you are going to take an unconventional approach to grilled cheese, it should at least taste good. The only consistent thing about the sandwich is that it was greasy. \n\nI hate to give this place two stars. Trust me! I live in SOMA and the opening of more small eateries like this can only be a good thing. I am all for the success of new restaurants in the area. That being said, grilled cheese has a certain nostalgia in our culture. It is reminiscent of simple comfort food and instant gratification. We take it seriously. I can't help but think the success here will be short-lived (if the food doesn't get better) riding off social networking and worse, the exploitation of this nostalgia.", "author": "Annie Y."}

Seriously.  How do you make a bad grilled cheese?  I got their basic sandwich, the mousetrap, which is basically just three different types of cheeses and some bread.  No distractions.  I was super excited after I ordered.  But what I got was beyond disappointing.  \n\nDespite having three different cheeses, I couldn't really taste any.  I did, however, taste the heavily buttered and slightly burnt bread, which wasn't particularly good bread either.  Come on guys, it's a cheese sandwich, not a butter sandwich, which would have been a better name.  I did, however, make myself butter sandwiches when I was like 5, but I've moved on from that, and I certainly don't want to pay $6 for someone to make me a version that I, at 5 years old, made better using Wonder bread.  Or maybe it was Roman Meal.  I dunno.  Bottom line.  I ate half of the sandwich and gave the other half to a homeless man nearby.  I wonder if he even ate it all .", "author": "Ash T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-04", "description": "On my way to the Giants game, I passed by The American Grilled Cheese Kitchen, a new restaurant on 2nd Street and South Park.  Not wanting to pay $12 for a hot dog and $9.50 for a beer at PacBell Park, I decided to go in and give these guys a try.  It was quite busy, and I found out that it was actually only their second day open.\n\nI ordered the Feta Tomato sandwich (feta, monterey jack, roasted tomatoes, tapenade, and garlic butter), and my friend ordered the Jalapeno Popper (goat cheese, monterey jack, applewood smoked bacon, and apricot-jalapeno relish).  Both sandwiches were fantastic.  The feta tomato had a perfect balance between ingredients, with no single one overwhelming the others, and was almost like a foccacia.  The jalapeno popper was also great - the apricot-jalapeno spread was sweet and tangy, with a little bit of a kick to it.  Each sandwich also came with a cutie orange, which I thought was a nice touch, and a refreshing contrast to the sort of inherent 'unhealthiness' of the grilled cheese.  I noticed that a few reviewers have complained of 'greasiness,' which I think is an absurd criticism of a grilled cheese sandwich; they're supposed to be a bit greasy - that's what makes them so tasty.\n\nThe price/portion ratio was fair - they used very high quality ingredients and that area of town is generally going to be a bit pricier than say, the Richmond or Sunset districts.  Sandwiches were priced in the $6-9 range.  The sandwich portions were such that I wasn't hungry afterwards, but also wasn't so full that I entered into the dreaded food coma which pretty much sabotages any chance of productivity I would have in the hour after lunch.  If you are looking for a gigantic sandwich that will force you to unbutton your pants, this place is probably not for you.\n\nThey also had a nice variety of very original handcrafted sodas, which were very refreshing on what was a nice warm day (they have outside seating in addition to seating at the bar inside).\n\nAll in all, I will definitely be going back to try some of their other sandwiches, and I live halfway across the city!", "author": "Jeffrey K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-18", "description": "I work across the street from The American, and it has been PACKED since its opening-for good reason.  The food is good (not excellent, more on that later) the servers are peppy and engaged, and the ambience is phenomenal.  \n\nFair warning: this is not a cheap lunch joint.  Expect to at least spend 10 dollars, unless you're feeling super-stingy.  Another word of caution: after around 11:30, this place is PACKED.  Be sure you can devote at least a half hour of wait time if you don't get there right when they open.    The staff does their best to keep things moving, but with a tiny restaurant, a tiny kitchen, and only one cash register, I can understand why it takes so long.  \n\nAlright, on to the food.  The most important thing to order is a drink.  I know this may sound ridiculous, but all of the house-made non-alcoholic offerings (I haven't tried any of the alcoholic ones, or the bottled ones) I've had at the American have been phenomenal.  As far as I'm concerned, the Vanilla Gingermint Soda is really the star of the show.  That may sound like a weird combination, but trust me, it works extremely well.  I hope they can find a way to bottle that stuff-it's liquid joy.\n\nThe sandwiches are a bit less impressive than the drinks, though not by much.  In my two visits, I've had a Jalepe\u00f1o Popper, and a Wild Turkey.  In both cases, the sandwiches sounded spicier than they actually were.  The dominant flavor in the popper switches between the cheese and the apricot (in the Apricot-Jalepe\u00f1o spread), though it completely sidesteps the bacon.  Was it good?  Absolutely.  But in order to really knock my socks off, I'd prefer a more subtle blend of flavors, rather than a ping-pong match between cheese and apricot.\n\nThe Wild Turkey is definitely more well-rounded.  While it seems that the smoked turkey, like the bacon in the Popper, gets lost in the shuffle, the entire flavor profile of the sandwich is far broader and more subtle.  None of the ingredients seem out to wrangle your tastebuds in one direction or another.  When I come back, this'll definitely be my go-to sandwich.\n\nA quick word about bread: Their crusty bread tastes great, and they've finally perfected cooking it just right, with a semi-chewy middle, and a hard crust.  That said, if you eat the crust, prepare for the roof of your mouth to hate you for it.  (Protip: If you've already abused the roof of your mouth the previous night, pass on the crust.  It'll just add pain to more pain.  I learned from experience.)\n\nSomething that nobody seems to mention is the free fruit with every sandwich.  It's easy to overlook as a garnish, but I've enjoyed the clementines (strike that, tangerines) that came with my sandwiches, albeit with a side of pain after I've finished my sandwich.\n\nAll in all, The American is worth a trip.  Get there early, order a drink, make sure you have room in your budget, and enjoy.", "author": "Blair F."}

We got there around 1:30pm and the line was pretty long (we waited 45 minutes to order). \n\nWhile waiting in line they ran out of almost all the sandwiches and all the salads as well as one of the bread puddings. This was kind of a bummer because each time I chose something it would get sold out and I'd have to pick another thing on the menu... \n\nSo I ended up with the Feta & Tomato sandwich and my husband had the Jalapeno Popper. And while Feta may not have been my first choice I was blown away after the first bite! My husband finished his sandwich in no less than 2 minutes and dove into the savory bread pudding which was also amazing. So basically we ordered 3 things, all of which were not our first choices on the menu and we were still blown away. \n\nThe wait is long (I'm assuming this will die down) and I do think they need to plan a bit better so that the people waiting in line for 45 minutes don't get left with 1 or 2 choices off the menu, but hey - maybe this just means you have to get there early. \n\nWe will definitely be going again (and again).

We didn't have to wait long in line, and the guy who rang me up was really nice (and easy on the eyes, too!) but my friends both complained that their cashier was on the bitchy side. Lucky me, I guess - my cashier even let me order some extra roasted potatoes to put on my Piglet. We found a table outside and waited for about 10-15 minutes. It ended up being four of us, so I didn't think it was that long of a wait - I just wish they were on the sunny side of the street ;)\nWhatever wait was absolutely worth it. The Piglet is literally one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. It was the perfect ratio of salty ham to melty sharp cheddar; they kept it light on the apple mustard like I specified; the bread was perfectly toasted and brushed with rosemary butter; and the thin layer of potatoes added a great roasted flavor. \nI had a little carton of milk to chase it down, and it was nice and icy cold because my cute cashier let me come back to the fridge and grab it when I got my sandwich - bonus points for him. Altogether, lunch came to $9.87. I certainly can't afford it every day, but for a lunchtime treat I didn't think it was too expensive.\nI did taste my friend's Mousetrap and that was pretty good too, albeit a little one-dimensional and gooey for my taste (maybe it was the fact that there were three different cheeses involved and she didn't order any extras like roasted tomato or pickles).\n\nI will return to try the Jalapeno Popper for sure - the combination of flavors sounds really intriguing. I'm just glad I work a few blocks up the street and can avoid temptation!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Next time I'm trying the Piglet, or the Wild Turkey. I also ordered the passionfruit lemonade, which was delicious. It was tart and sweet, but not too much of either. They make their own sodas, and one of the flavors I can remember was grapefruit-peppercorn. I'd like to try it someday, but I'm glad I went with the lemonade. \n\nI work in the Financial Dist, so a coworker and I took Muni over to the ballpark, and walked up a couple blocks to AGCK.

Well, here's a good lunch spot. Their gluten free bread is delicious! I'm not celiac, but this bread has some rosemary or something inside it and it's just better than regular bread.  I also really liked their tomato soup. A must try is the special diet cola they have. Yes, I also only drink diet soda and was excited to try out this non-diet pepsi/coke glass bottle diet cola.  That cola is good!

The Jalapeno Popper is hot (I took my friend to try it and he was surprisingly in agreement -he's my gauge for is it really that hot). The tomato soup is great.  They always give you a piece of fruit too so the meal feels rounded and mom would approve...haha.  I have also tried one of their breakfast sandwiches.  But my favorite so far is the Mac and Cheese sandwich, macaroni & cheese stuffed inside grilled bread, pure heaven if you're a mac & cheese lover.

Anyway, my sister (also a big fan of the stuff) and I were highly intriqued by this restaurant. We lurked the yelp reviews, salivated over the website menu, and made our choices. One Sunday at lunch, we dragged my dear hubby (who hates the stuff, but I married him anyway) and baby over the bridge for a special trip to this place. Oh, but we longed to love it, were really hoping to. Alas, it greatly disappointed on many levels. Here goes-\nSis and I got the tomato soup and basic mousetrap, no extras.\n- the grilled was fair, had decent crisp to the bread, but cheese was not completely melted in the middle. Could get this anywhere.\n- the soup was terrible! Luke-warm, needed salt, seasoning, something. Campbells is better, how sad.\n- grapes are a cute, refreshing albeit unnecessary touch.\nHubby got the turkey club, sans cheese.\n- your basic sandwich, nothing earth-shattering but filled the belly.\nAlso got the piglet to try/split.\n- yuck! Maybe it's the rosemary butter, but this tasted really funny, like off. The next day, I threw my leftover half away. \nParking was limited but we got lucky on the street. Table seating is extremely minimal, so we did the awkward standing around, trying not to stare people down, until a table freed up. \nIt really is just a coffee shop that serves grilled cheese. This is definitely NOT a destination place, despite the siren-call of its name. If you happen to be in the area, then by all means go and satisfy your craving. Do not expect greatness.

On opening day, I rushed over to South Park to find out what all the buzz was about and please my tummy. I imagined taking one big bite of ooey, gooey cheese bliss with a sip of red wine. It was a perfect Friday afternoon in San Francisco, the wind still, the sun beaming, no clouds in the sky. I thought it would be nice for us to sit on the swings in South Park after lunch and lull.   I did some advanced research and found that they even have house made, gluten-free bread! Just the concept had me going, but then I learned that the restaurant chef/owner is a seven time winner of the Grilled Cheese Invitational. This was like having easy access to an Iron Chef. Oh, I can see Bobby Flay  showing up for a throwdown.  I was only to be disappointed when I finally got there. They were SOLD OUT! Oh, my taste buds cried and I no longer cared about the swings....\n\nA few weeks later, I did go back and waited for 45 minutes before I got my grilled cheese and tomato soup.

Each of the sandwiches comes with an apple on the side and they sell the bottled sodas here, which I can appreciate since they are better tasting than the canned ones.", "author": "Justin Y."}

What a splendid and DELICIOUS surprise!  \n\nI had the jalapeno popper and he had the mousetrap (other reviews can tell you exactly what's in them). The mousetrap is a classic, comfort food grilled cheese sandwhich with a more elevated taste due to the right combo of cheeses on buttery toasted bread. The jalapeno popper was a delight (seriously I can't stop thinking about it!) with bacon, cheese, and jalapeno relish - the right amount of kick, sweet, melted cheese, and rustic bread.  My husband and I each sampled from the other's sandwhich and we were both head over heels for the jalapeno popper.  \n\nYeah the prices are a little high for what it is: grilled cheese.  But I am more than willing to pay a little more for a place that does one thing and does it well.", "author": "Melissa O."}

We ordered at 11:45, so we were too early to order off the lunch menu.  If you come too late, you run the risk of them running out of certain menu items.  I'm guessing they try to ration out their stock between the breakfast and lunch crowd.  Some of the items are on both menus, so this might not be an issue for you.  The only differences I saw between our breakfast sandwiches and the lunch ones is that they add an apple for the lunch orders and charge you $3 more.

The line to order goes by quick but since there were so many people my friend and I waited about 15-20 minutes for our sandwiches. But believe me, it's worth the wait. When you're done with your sandwich you ought to go across the street to 21st Ammendment and grab yo self a watermelon ale!!!!!!!

It's hard to believe a place that serves food and ice tea doesn't have lemon, and I'm sure we aren't the first ones to ask this (hint).

I will admit, the sando was tasty, cooked to perfection, and everything I would want in a grilled cheese sandwich.  However, the other amenities of this place made me feel like a stripper in Larry Flints pulled a fast one and swiped that $20 spot right out of my pocket.

It finally all makes sense though. To operate such a place whose kitchen is comprised of 4 guys laboring over a Betty Crocker size oven, which turns out six or seven sandos every 15 minutes, plus the two additional servers/cashiers, requires such markups on staple items such as crappy beer, bread, tomato soup, and cheese.  This place has survived on its prime location, and appeal to SF foodies that want to check off a box from the best of the best list in 7x7.  Can me bitter, negative, but come on people, it's just a grilled cheese sandwich.   I'm over places that try to glorify ingredients as if they are better than they really are.

The food delivery is faster than the ordering process - not sure who designed the place, or if they have the right people working the register, but a little design help could improve the speed of getting people through the lunch rush.  I had the Piglet, which is an expensive hot ham and cheese, but there was enough original-ness to make it a delightful sandwich, owning mostly to a rosemary butter covering the delicious bread.  I did notice that they do gluten free bread for 50 cents extra - very cool, but I'm not sure you should charge people extra for having allergies.  Anyway, I also tried the jalapeno popper, which tastes just like the real thing with a creamy chevre on top.  One delight on the menu is the fresh sodas available, that probably change with some frequency.  Today's was a very tasty ginger mint.  I'm dying to try the butterscotch blondie when I can spare a few hundred more calories", "author": "Michael C."}

True, their prices are a little high for a \"grilled cheese\", but you have to really get past that and realize these are \"gourmet\" - top ingredients, hot food, fresh.  It's a great place for to indulge for lunch.", "author": "Gina R."}

I love grilled cheese sandwiches and definitely recommend going here. Its small on the inside but if its a nice day, great to eat out on the patio. I ordered the mousetrap with bacon and roasted tomato. It came with a perfectly small apple. Delicious. The daily soup was baked potato and not heavy at all. Very nice. I got a pickle as a side for $1.50 but not worth the value or taste. I highly recommend getting there before noon or it'll be at least a 20 min wait.", "author": "kelly y."}

My friend and I split the jalapeno popper and the mushroom gruyere sandwiches and both were amazing.  The mushroom had a delicious but milder flavor with the potatoes adding wonderful texture.  Only complaint is that I couldn't taste the thyme butter it advertised.  The jalapeno popper was incredibly flavorful with the right amount of spice and it was the general consensus of the table that it was the best sandwich.  My other friend enjoyed his piglet sandwich, but I didn't taste it, and my other friend was underwhelmed by the turkey club (also didn't taste for myself).  We all shared a tomato soup, which was delicious and perfect for sandwich dipping--not too creamy or watery with a wonderful roasted tomato flavor.  The lemonade was also amazing--very tart and lemony!  The portion sizes were right on (I couldn't quite finish a full sandwich) and I really liked that it came with an apple on the side instead of fries or chips (an apple totally justifies an indulgent grilled cheese right?).  Only gripes were the limited seating outside (while we got a table, I could see other diners frantically stalking to snag one once it opened up) and they took nearly 20 minutes to deliver one of our friend's sandwiches.  As an out-of-towner, this will be my go-to quick lunch spot for future SF visits.", "author": "Caitlin T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-23", "description": "Very delish!  Try the jalapeno popper.  The bread has the right amount of crunchiness and the combination of sweet and spicy is sure to hit the spot.  The inside decor is really cute and there are tables and chairs outside.  There are homemade sodas with interesting flavors like grapefruit and black cherry.  They have specials that aren't on the menu like the Hawaiian with pineapple.  Love this place although $10 is a lot for a grilled cheese sandwich.  I would still go back again to try a different flavor!   Go at 1 or later to avoid the long lines.", "author": "Hannah L."}

Perhaps this has already been done.  The person who came up with the idea of grilled cheese should also get one, and undoubtedly the creators of this restaurant will get theirs in due course.   I came here for a late lunch yesterday and was swept away by the Mousetrap with bacon and grilled tomatoes added.  Served on perfectly grilled and buttered slices of levain, the three cheeses were a luxurious blend, and contrary to expectations the sandwich had a certain lightness to it, not too dense and gooey, especially when washed down with a glass of Reisling. .  To confirm the experience I returned for breakfast today and had the Basic Breakfast sandwich, again with bacon added.  I'm not much of a breakfast fan but this was something that could easily get my day off to a good start.  No Reisling for breakfast, but the coffee was really good.", "author": "David T."}
