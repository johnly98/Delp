There was not a single seat open, and plenty of people were standing as well. I almost turned around and walked away right there and then, however we were extremely lucky as 3 spots opened at the bar (and there were 3 of us).\n\nI got both an individual pour, as well as a flight. Comparing the beers, there were definitely some that were superior (in my mind) to others. In particular, I really enjoyed the Saison De La Vache, which is a milkshake saison. It was so creamy and delicious-- even if you don't like saisons, I would definitely recommend trying it!\n\nThe service at the bar was great, even though they were super busy. The crowd, while large, was also vibrant. It definitely seems like the place to be and a lovely spot to kick back and relax after work.", "author": "Angela C."}

My friend invited me to a happy hour at Black Hammer, and I was excited because I love bringing my husky puppy everywhere. In fact, we rolled up with two of his other husky friends, and it got quite crowded with a few other dogs in the bar as well.\n\nEven though Black Hammer looks quite big, I think most of the space is taken up by the large structures actually brewing the beer. It's deceiving because there isn't actually any outdoor or back patio seating. Noted when trying to bring three huskies into a crowded bar during happy hour.\n\nDecent selection of beer, though you have to walk up to the multiple screens hanging from the walls to determine what you want. Everything I got tasted great. Ice cold and refreshing, served up in a giant glass mug. There's pitchers too, of course. And speaking of hydration, there's a purified water bowl for the dogs in the back corner. So thoughtful.\n\nAll the bartenders are nice, and they made us feel comfortable even when the huskies wanted to play and other dogs were running rampant around the bar. Just be careful not to let any of them run out into the street. Would love to come here again, especially during a less busy hour. Happy with my experience overall!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

They have a small mix of lower ibu beers, then ramp it up with a few IPA's, a unique barrel-aged selection, and others. We opted to get a flight ('cause that's the best way to try em all) and favored the Lederhosen, Ten tickles, and Xtra Aun Ho the most. Not sure how often their beers rotate, but if you see these on the menu then I highly recommend.\n\nAlso tried the Hella Sexy (lager) and Go-go dancer (tripel), which were a bit less tasty as to be expected given their low ibu's. If it was the middle of the day and you wanted something light but not necessarily a lager, I'd go with the Go-go.\n\nSOMA is up and coming with places to eat and grab a drink at whether it's after work or on a Sunday Funday, and Black Hammer should certainly be on your list!", "author": "Allie L."}

I'm still confused about BHB and PBL are related, but suffice it to say, there's enough good beer to try for anyone.\n\nAt around 4pm on a Saturday, the brewery was starting to get full, but we were able to sit near the open garage door windows. There were about 20 beers to try, and it was nice to see such a variety of types. I usually gravitate to the hoppier beers, and really liked the Sparkle Pony. My favorite, however, was the heavy-hitting Xtra An Yay Ho, which is aged in tequila barrels for 2 months - unique and boozy. There were other beers I didn't like as much, but you can't win them all. \n\nVibe is definitely chill. I love the psychedelic art all over the walls. It's a nice touch to have bubbly (and still) water easily available.\n\nDon't get the $4 pretzels. Not worth it for the price or the taste.

I really love the new half stein glasses, they are cute. \n\nThey often have food pop up events and live music which definitely makes Black Hammer even better.

When trying to decide where to go next, I realized I've never been to Black Hammer Brewing. We stopped by on Wednesday, July 5th around 7:30pm. It was moderately busy, but we were able to grab two seats at the bar.\n\n*Sparkle Pony: Belgian Blonde Ale, 6.9% ABV, 24 IBU, Black Hammer Brewing, San Francisco, CA ($6 pint)\n*Squid Ink (Pac. Brew Lab): IPA - Black, Cascadian Dark Ale, 7% ABV, 54 IBU, Pacific Brewing Laboratory, San Francisco, CA ($7 pint)\n*We're With Paris: IPA - New England Style, 7.8% ABV, 30 IBU, Black Hammer Brewing, San Francisco, CA ($6 pint)\n*Sugar Free Red Bull ($4)\n\nI started with the sparkle pony. I'm more of a Belgian White girl, so this was a nice beer. Overall, I'm not a huge beer drinker, but I was happy with my choice. Plus, I thought the name was cute. Peter got the IPAs and seemed to enjoy them. They also gave us a complimentary bowl of bar snack mix which was a nice touch as we didn't have any dinner.\n\nFlight of 4: Black Hammer Brewing, San Francisco, CA ($20)\n*Blue Me: witbier w/blueberry, 5.5% abv, 13 ibu\n*Witless Zombie: witbier, 5.5% abv, 22 ibu\n*Nectar of Life: kolsch, 6% abv, 24 ibu\n*Dance^3: belgian tripel, 10.4% abv, 25 ibu\n\nWhen I saw a couple other patrons with flights, I had to have that for my second round. I told the bartender to surprise me as you can pick any four beers you want. Based on my first round, he poured the beers above. I believe each beer was 8oz, so it's a generous serving. You're basically drinking two pints. For me, it was a nice way to try four additional beers. Especially since I'm not well versed in beers at all.\n\nFun HH spot.

The guy had immediately shown attitude towards us in our first interaction, then decided to ignore us for about 10-15 minutes and serve anyone and everyone around us whilst ignoring our calls for quick and easy service.  How difficult is it to pour 3 flights of whatever beers you enjoy for yourself?  If he reads this and remembers this interaction and decides to say \"it was busy that night\", well, it was, but why did you serve 3 other parties before deciding to even look our way again?

The space was comfortable--relaxed atmosphere, cheerful decor, natural light, awesome dog. Service was friendly and immediate.\n\nBlack Hammer serves an impressive slate of house beers, and you can get them in different sized pours depending on your mood. We wanted to taste a range, so we went with the half pints. We would've done a flight, but the pricing was bizarre--it cost less to do them a la carte (though looking at the website now, it looks like they've fixed that).

A bartender just told me she was too busy to sell me FOUR SMALL BEERS. It was shocking on so many levels.\n\n1) I just waited patiently while you made 3 other customers flights of beers. If you were going to institute a flight cutoff time - maybe don't do it to the person who actually waited through the flight backlog.\n2) She essentially wanted me to swap four small beers with two large beers. The time savings there would have been so trivial that it boggles my mind that she allowed money to walk out the door over it.\n3) Again, it's not like I asked her to muddle up some fresh mint and craft a mojito - WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 4 SMALL BEERS.\n\nI was so tempted to order four large beers just to have her double down on her shitty logic, but frankly I didn't want to give them any money at that point. They are clearly too busy for it.", "author": "Georgeann G."}

A friend of mine was celebrating their birthday here since it was pouring rain and originally we were suppose to go to the Embarcadero ice rink. I know right? Since when did ice skating become equivalent to a beer bar.\n\nAnyways, got there in the late afternoon on a Saturday and it was about half empty. However, that being great because it was easy to get a table. Order a sour beer and it was gooooood and like I said earlier, I'm not a huge fan of beer. They also serve flights of beer so you can taste all different ones they have. I thought it was a decent selection overall. In addition, they have free bar snacks for you to munch on, so that was quite nice. There's also a cute dog they hangs out at the bar that LOVES attention. The dog will come sit right by you or on your lab and snuggle with you. It appears it also loves the bar snacks as well. If you want to hang out with the dog, sit at the table that is closest to the bathroom. Seems to be the spot the dog likes the most.\n\nThe place does get packed though, so if you have a large party definitely come early. Only complaint about this place is that they take your empty glasses from you pretty quickly, which I get, but about half our glasses were water glasses that look exactly like the beer glasses and we were totally still drinking out of those.", "author": "Julie L."}

My favorite beer so far is the Jaded Raver; an ESB (aptly named) but I also like a lot of the collab brews they make w/ Pac Brew Labs (Squid Ink!!!).  \n\nI've been here a few times and I find myself drifting this way more often.  So I'll see you there. Oh yeah!  Awesome fact:  they're dog friendly so bring Fido or Benji!\n\nLS", "author": "Lee S."}

We were SO worried it was going to be overwhelmingly busy like the other bars in the area, but when we walked in, it was totally manageable! The bar has an open front with a roll up door like a garage. SO COOL. It was breezy and amazing and so much fun. The bar itself doesn't serve food, but other restaurants in the area are available for pick-up/take-out/delivery, I believe. It's kid and DOG friendly. Literally dogs are free to roam around and keep you company while you drink delicious beer and people watch. If you're not a pet lover, maybe this place isn't for you, haha. My fiance is an avid beer drinker, so this stop was for him, really. Our niece and I hung out at a roomy table while he ordered a flight of beers. A. Flight. Of. Beers. He chose 4 different 8 oz. beers, and they were severed to him in this super cool wooden beer carrier. After that, he even got to try their cannabis IPA that he says was \"out of this world.\" Their beers have cute, fun names like Sparkle Pony and Cuddle Puddle.

It was slightly tart, which complemented the Belgian yeast flavor, and was very refreshing.  The Squid Ink black IPA was decent but not as exciting as the name.  The Whipnose DIPA was okay, not very special.  And the Hopportunistic completely didn't live up to it's name - I didn't consider it particularly hoppy or good, to be frank.  A fellow patron was also not impressed by the blueberry wit.\n\nI guess overall I'd give the beer 3 stars, but the general vibe 4 stars.

Just a mix of beers that the team brews up I think in the back or nearby. Light to dark, hoppy to malty, about 8-10 beers to choose from weekly. I love the saison, but seems like the blueberry wit is the popular choice this summer with the crowd.\n\nThe usb/power outlets around the bar area is a definite plus for those who need a quick phone charge or want to do some work. You can bring food in too, and with HRD just around the corner Black Hammer is a winner.", "author": "Sho T."}

Plenty of seating and power points, so it's a great place 'work from home' for a couple hours. \n\nThe street facing wall has two glass filled garage doors that are opened up during nice weather for an 'open air' feel.  In the evenings they often have a DJ playing music and the atmosphere gets more bubbling and social (there is a disco ball too!). They don't serve meals there but there are several restaurants within a block walk, and sometimes food trucks come park out front. \n\nIt's a dog friendly venue so there are friendly visiting pets around sometimes, including the owner's sweet little brown pup. The bar has three clean spacious unisex toilets with a big sink in the hall outside.  There is a self serve water station by the bar, and they have little plates of nuts and chips to much on if you are peckish.  \n\nMy favourite beers are the Blueberry Wit and a double bock called Bock Party. Highly recommend their tasting flights to try out a few at once, and the flights are a great deal too.", "author": "Nat C."}

I was very excited to check it out, especially since they did such a good job with the building look & feel. Inside, however, the vibe was a bit different. The decor seemed a bit outdated/off given how sleek their logo is. The beer itself was rather disappointing. I did enjoy the Kolsch, but many of the other beers, especially the Oktoberfest and English Ale didn't have much flavor. Definitely a good neighborhood spot; I really like the indoor hanging bike rack and the large garage doors that they keep open, but not a place I will go out of my way to visit again.", "author": "Regina L."}

There was a DJ, a Korean food truck out front, and the people behind the bar knew what they were doing even though it was their first night. \n\nOf the beers, I tried the Kolsch, Oktoberfest, Sacre Bleu Blueberry Wit, and the Nautilus Hibisus Saison.  They have samplers, too.  The blueberry was light and actually had fresh blueberries in it, which was nice for summer. I think the Kolsch was my favorite. \n\nBonuses:\n- They had peanuts and a good toffee peanut brittle on the counter\n- There's a large water dispenser, so you can help yourself to water without bugging the staff\n- Even when there's a Giants game, parking isn't that bad down there at night\n- There are multiple bathroom stalls\n- The place was well ventilated since they have two big garage door style doors in the front\n\nThe decor is clean and modern with a slight industrial feel, but it's still very warm with cool artwork on the walls. The wood work is pretty amazing (they made their own counters and tables?).  I look forward to when they are officially open.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

Got to chat w/ the owner, who was really nice...and heck, doing my good deed for the day - I let him know they need to update their Yelp page to reflect the fact that they have wifi...\n\nWould definitely come back here - great vibe, tasteful decor - perfect place for an after-work meet up.

Beer seems to be designed for mainstream - nothing really offensive but nothing I'd say was great. Beertenders were friendly and helpful, but the beers didn't make it to noteworthy. I don't know if the techno rock was for the regular patrons, reflection of some German influence, or just preference for the staff. I like the idea of 4 6-8oz glasses for the flight (I don't know which they were), and $16 ain't a bad price for the volume, but nothing really jumped out as delicious.

I have brought several serious beer drinking friends here and they were all impressed (not with the same beer either). Jim, the owner, and the staff are very friendly and accommodating. You also have snacks to munch on and you can bring food in from outside! Why haven't you gone here yet?", "author": "Stephen M."}

Really liked their beers. \nTook a couple mins to find seats for 2 since the place is relatively small, hence the one less star. There is a u shaped bar with hooks to hang your bags but it seemed as though they did not have enough stools. They also had other tables you could sit at but it was pretty crammed just trying to walk around. I did like that the place was really open (it has two garage door like openings, so you get some cool air in). The dog roaming around was adorable and definitely calm.\nWe got a flight of 4 beers: kolsch, sunrise, boch, and hisbiscus. The kolsch tastes like any regular beer you get in Germany (trust me, I just came back from Oktoberfest). The sunrise did not taste like there was any alcohol at all. It was definitely sour and had an aftertaste of a really sour nectarine (I could feel the fuzziness in my mouth too?) The boch was mild and had a nutty aftertaste which I liked. The hibiscus was definitely different. It had a floral note to it.\nGive this shot a try but big groups would definitely be hard to manage.", "author": "Jessica H."}

They have something for everyone and I cannot recommend the \"Taste the Rainbow\" flight enough. It is a great deal and you get to try everything they have on tap. I also love that you can bring in your own food. I would recommend Chili Lemon Garlic or Goathill Pizza. Extra bonus is that there are usually dogs. As someone who really wants a dog, but cannot in my building, I love getting my dog time in with some good beers.", "author": "Lillian K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-05", "description": "The beer shows an impressive range.  They have a strong showing across a wide variety of beers, so anyone can come here with a group of people and find good beer to drink.  Their hibiscus beer and blueberry beer were both excellent examples of the styles.  The Kolsch will work as a weaning beer for that guy who has to have Bud Light.  Just explain that the extra flavor is what good hot weather beer is supposed to taste like,  The pilsner was interesting with the maize flavor showing through a bit across an American (rather than Czech) pilsner tradition.\nThe IPA class of beers were less hop-forward than I would have expected, but given the plethora of hop-forward IPA's in the Bay Area, that is actually a nice change that gives the beer a more distinctive flavor, even though it was not in my wheelhouse.\nI found the full range of beers to be of high quality and to be very drinkable.  I would advise that the tasters are 8oz, in case you make the mistake that I did and order six of them before you realize what you have done.  In case you are wondering, the signage clearly states that they are 8oz.  I just wasn't paying enough attention.\nI found the staff to be pleasant and the service to be quick and attentive.  \nOn a Friday night the taproom looked a bit different, more like a conventional bar than a taproom, but that impression ends as soon as you start to talk about beer.  This would be a good place to bring people who don't normally want to go to a brewery as well as a place to bring beer nerds.\nOn the whole, I liked this place and I will come back to try the items that I skipped on the beer list the next time I have a chance.", "author": "Greg D."}

Good atmosphere, excellent bartenders, and plenty of space for such a small spot. The vibe is solid, and inviting.
