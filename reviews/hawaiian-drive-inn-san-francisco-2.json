I enjoyed my meal and I am so glad I didn't have need to go very far just for Hawaiian Cuisine. Just for this alone, I'll definitely come in again.\n\nThe side macaroni salad is delicious with the mayonnaise to give it a good flavor. I love the chicken katsu, breaded tender chicken meat that is crispy outside and tender inside. Two scoops perfectly steamed rice pairs well with these two items.\n\nAs fellow Yelp reviewer Sam stated, chicken katsu with macaroni salad is so good. Because it simply is and that is exactly what I had today.\n\nOverall, good food, good service and friendly staff.

But this is one of the spacious and somewhat cleaner location than the others. \n\n I have been here a couple of times earlier in the past Summer. I had the Chicken Katsu lunch plate. And another time I had the Teriyaki Chicken lunch plate. For $7.99 + tax, all lunch plates had the cooked meat, customary macaroni salad and steamed rice. Both chicken meats are very thin. And the batter from the Katsu is very thick and heavy, which I try to avoid at my age.  You get what you paid for. \n\nJust like the other businesses along San Bruno Ave, this is a \"Cash Only\" spot. The homie (owner), who works there, is very cool though.

In fact, in almost 3,600 reviews, I've only given 19 of them before. Some gladly like the Westway Diner in Manhattan's Theater District where the glum waiter made up arbitrary rules about where we could sit by threatening not to serve us. Or at Lindy's where the waitress grabbed my arm on my way to the restroom to make sure I was paying the check. Sometimes it's just about the food and how inedible it is like the mix-it-yourself pho at the Asian Box in the Macy's basement.\n\nSadly, this is one of those situations. I have to admit this was not my first choice when I was in Portola, but this grubby corner spot was the most convenient before taking the bus back to my 'hood. Speaking of hoods, that appears to be most of their clientele, i.e., young boys in hoods (photo: http://bit.ly/2kKyQAj), probably not the most discriminating epicureans. The menu is Hawaiian fast food, and man, I had not had saimin in such a long time. I ordered the $5.50 Aloha Saimin. The noodles were limp, and the broth tasted rancid. Just look at it (photo: http://bit.ly/2kY3Qbu).\n\nI guess I should have been thrilled that it had a slice of Spam and a slice of pork to go with the BBQ chicken and fried chicken. But it tasted like it was all left in the pot too long, and they were just trying to get rid of it. Knowing I wasn't about to finish it, I actually took a chance and ordered the $8.95 BBQ Short Rib Lunch Plate to go as if the saimin was somehow just a little misstep. Nope, the short ribs were overcooked and dry with the only saving grace the macaroni salad (photo: http://bit.ly/2l6zFjh). More boys in hoods kept gathering in the place. Time to go.\n\nFOOD - 1.5 stars...saimin shouldn't be treated like that much less me\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...like a school cafeteria after a gang rumble\nSERVICE - 1 star...non-existent\nTOTAL - 1 star...substandard Hawaiian grub needs a major overhaul", "author": "Ed U."}

I threw in a Spam Musubi for good measure. A short while later, the order came out. The spam Musubi had steaming rice, crisp seaweed wrapper and just enough fried spam to balance the salty hit with the plain rice. \n\nThe bone-in pork chop was thin like a minute steak but had been marinated so it tasted like a tender teriyaki flavored jerky. Slightly sweet, slightly salty, perfect with the mayo macaroni salad, cabbage and rice. The rice was a bit mushy in parts which is what I expected having eaten some on the Big Island. The highlight however, was the panko crusted chicken Katsu! It was hot, crispy on the outside, but moist and tender within. I was thrilled that it wasn't greasy. They used real chicken breast pounded into cutlets. The sweet and sour sauce was a great dip. 'Shaka! \n\nThe bathroom was tired, yes.

If you're a big fan of L&L, you won't think much of this place, but it's not too far off in taste and quality. Down sides are: 1) like seemingly every other place on San Bruno, it's cash only; 2) it's definitely gritty in this place - food's not bad, but this place has been ridden hard and put away wet one too many times; 3) it's either a plus that they have a public bathroom, or a minus that you feel like you could catch a disease of all you did was just breathe in that bathroom.

I would say this location is pretty clean so that is a plus I might give it another try.", "author": "Peter C."}

So not only are they breaking San Francisco law, but they're causing MOUNTAINS of trash and even putting you at higher risk for cancer (see http://www.sfenvironment.org/article/prevent-waste/food-service-waste-reduction-ordinance ).\n\nPlus, they don't even have a recycling can in the restaurant for all the plastic they're serving, so that gets trashed too.", "author": "Geae D."}

It wasn't too bad, but it wasn't anything to brag about either. It's cheap, fast and decent tasting so I'm not really complaining.

I will make this short and sweet: Do not eat here if you do not like large portions of food. My father was born and raised on Oahu, and I basically grew up eating a combination of Japanese and Hawaiian food. \n\nI came here shortly after work after skipping lunch to attend a string of meetings. I was hungry enough to eat a side of beef at this point, and I was worried that my food decision would result in small portions. The aftermath would not be pretty. There is no decor here. There are a few small tables in a very small setting. \n\nI briefly scanned the limited menu, and chose both the loco moco and an order of spam musubi. When my loco moco arrived, they couldn't close the strofoam container because there was too much food. I was in trouble. My goal for this meal was to leave with no left-overs. When my spam musubi finally came, I had before, an enormous challenge, however I finished EVERYTHING. The gravy wasn't overly salty, and the burger patties weren't overcooked (things you typically run into when you faced with sub-par loco moco). I ate so fast that I really didn't get a chance to savor the food, however I gave my review 4 stars for the sheer volume they served me.", "author": "Eric Y."}

The katsu is not too fatty and the BBQ chicken is always super-tender, which I love.\n\nThe specials and mini plates come with rice and macaroni salad but I always ask for no macaroni salad and they always give me an extra scoop of rice.\n\nThe place is usually empty but business seems to be brisk. \n\nI like how the walls are sparsely decorated with slightly-Hawaiian things like a poster of a \"typical\" Tahitian and a Fijian (I think.

Most hawaiian drive inn's are family owned and run but this location is different They hire outside help, \"see-see\", and it taste the best so far. Parking is a pain around this area, even worse during 49ers games, they park in the area. But still worth the try.\n\nCASH ONLY, they do not accept credit cards.", "author": "Robin L."}

This is fast food Hawaiian BBQ and it is delicious everytime.  The favorites are Loco Moco (over easy eggs, seasoned meat patties over sticky rice and gravy with mac salad) and BBQ mixed plate (short ribs, my personal favorite, chicken, beef over rice and mac).  These meals are big (2 people filling) and consistantly good.  I've tried some of the other hawaiian bbq and drive in spots and they have been much worse!!!  Especially the one in Tanforan mall!  Never again.  This is THE spot, f* whatever the other folks say.\nAnd it does NOT accept credit or debit cards, bring your cash, stop at one of the local ATMS or buy a drink and get cash back from Walgreens down the block.", "author": "Sarah B."}

Go to ONO HAWAIIAN BBQ!!! there's one by serramonte mall and there's one on Sloat Blvd.\n\nI can taste and smell the oil in the food. Last time I got take out for work, I didn't think I would have to check the food. I was craving hawaiian BBQ for a while, especially the bbq sauce they give you, for some reason when I got to work instead of BBQ sauce, it's GRAVY. Sorry I'm not that much of a gravy fan so that just ruined my whole lunch appetite. Honestly...6.50 went into the trash and all I actually ate was the macaroni salad. What a waste of money. if I knew any sooner, I would've turned my car around before I got to work. Forget my business at this place.\n\nONO HAWAIIAN BBQ FOR LIFE!", "author": "Miss D."}

I phone in my order all the time and have it waiting for me when I get there. Gotta go with the mini-plates of katsu or loco moco.

We ordered the chicken katsu curry and garlic shrimp plates.  Portions are huge, prices are cheap.  Food is good...although I personally like a saucy thick curry sauce and what they offered here, to me, was a little thin.  My one little complaint was  that this place was FREEZING.  No heat. Yikes.  Aside, from that, the staff  was nice, they brought our food to our table with a smile.  Even though only 3 stars, I may give them another chance", "author": "Jessica G."}
