I needed a bite to eat because I such a huge tourist earlier in the day. This location picks up some interesting folks. There was this gentleman that was paying and said he printed up the money he was handing the cashier himself. The cashier took the money. The cashier wouldn't allow him to make the purchase and called the police.\n\nI order a burger combo, which took forever. JITB advertises that they don't make their burger until you order it. It only took a couple minutes for me to get to my hotel room and that burger was not hot at all. Even if it took me 5-minutes to walk to my hotel and take the elevator up, that burger shouldn't have been the temperature it was.\n\nI was not about to go back and cause a scene, or even take my valuable time. I manned up to that pathetic excuse for a burger and called it a night.", "author": "Antonio L."}

Working on getting a full refund actually. I am NOT paying for that. I think I'm gonna throwup. Worst dining experience ever. Can't believe people would be that careless while preparing food. They obviously do not care about the people they're making the food for. \n\nVery dirty,and even feeling very nauseated from it. Wouldn't trust this place again after that.\n\nEdit update: I did get a refund,but still not coming back to this location ever again.

I happened  closer to the one on Union Square at that particular time and this one is also 24 hours. So one morning at around 5am I set out to the location in hopes of getting one a good combination of some nice juicy burgers and their extensive breakfast offerings. \n\nThe place itself is very big and has a lot of seating. One can only imagine what it is like during the big lunch and dinner rush. As I was waiting on the line, someone from the kitchen came to let the cashier know that there was an issue with the deep frier. Some customers did not understand the detrimental effect this would have on their breakfast plans. And they tried to order whatever it was they were going to order. \n\nThe cashier was a polite dude who patiently explained more than once to a customer that there were no french fries or hash browns available...basically anything that involved deep frying would be unavailable for an u specified length of time. This certainly put a damper on my food plans but I was still undeterred. I went with one of their nice hardy burgers and a teriyaki chicken salad. \n\nEverything was good but it seemed I had picked a bad time to visit this particular location.

This location is always open so I can get food anytime!! \nI am addicted to their Spicy Chicken Burger. It's pretty filling with cheese or more crisp and refreshing with extra lettuce. \n\nThey have Tacos 2 for 99cents. Don't expext anything exciting. They make for a nice cheap snack. \n\nThe monster Tacos is bigger and around $1.5 ish but its too large to bite efficiently and so it's not as fun to eat.\n\nThe Chicken Sandwich is also cheap its like a chicken nugget patty with a lettuce leaf. Good for when you don't want to chew real chicken you know. \n\nThe Chicken Nuggets are alright. More expensive than McDonalds and the sauce selections are nowhere as food but it'll do. \n\nThe Crispy Chicken Strips aren't very crispy and a bit dry, the texture is unexciting. \n\nI LOVE their Curly Fries. So fun!! Very flavorful. Can be a bit salty at times. \n\nTheir normal Fries is kinda whatever. \n\nThe Bacon Cheddar Potato wedges is too carby fatty for my taste. They used to have chorizo cheese fried which I was addicted to. \n\nThe Mini Churros is fun to eat too. They bite-sizes and crispy with this curstardy filling. Don't expect too much, they're not Michelin quality - they're good for what they are. \n\nI think the ice cream shakes are a bit too thich. It's difficult to drink them theough the straw and that really hurt my cheeks. \n\nAll the Cheeseburger / Hamburger varieties are pretty allright. Theyre soft and easy to chew and swallow. Good enough for me. They don't have a lasting impression or anything thought. \n\nThe Munchie Meals are too crazy. They are overloaded with cheese it's impossible for me to finish but if you've been starbing for days or want a challenge then just try them out. Available after 9pm only, I think. \n\nI like Hash Browns. They have acceptable has browns. \nI really like their Breakfast Platter, especially the mini pancakes. So soft and cute and spongy and sweet. Breakfast is available allllllllll day. \n\nThe Chicken Club salad is kinda boring. Normal. Fresh enough. \nI like the Southwest Chicken Salad better.

It's bland and dry, especially compared to BK and McDs, both of those places take pride in their fries' quality. \nWhen i go to McDs, the french fries are a big highlight for me.\nThey mess up the curly fries too.

It appeared the gal at the counter did not understand so i asked her to read back the order and she kept getting it regular sized three times.\n\nShe just did not get it I wanted it supersized.  I almost pulled my $10 off of the counter to leave when a supervisor stepped in and showed the gal how to enter it in the computer.\n\nAfter all of these hassles I just wanted to eat and leave.  When my order was coming up the supervisor decided to go in the back leaving one kid on the counter.  So my order and several others sat in the heater ignored by the remaing counter guy.\n\nWhile we were waiting a street tough comes in and panhandle all people waiting for their food or to order.  What you do on the street is your business but any business which allows street people to hassle diners, people waiting for their food or people waiting to order is clueless.\n\nOverall I've had enough of this place and probably will not go back in for another couple of years due to the hassles - it is easier to go to McDonalds.\n\nYes, I'm not a foodie!", "author": "Dalt W."}

I knew i had some ground beef in the freezer... and some Cheeseburger Macaroni Hamburger Helper in my pantry.  I got all *sadface* when I realized I didn't have milk.  \n\nToday, I was elated to finally peep this JITB franchise, as I usually pass by this joint on my way to Katana-Ya.  Yes, I chose option two to cope.\n\nI asked Luis (a huge meat and cheese aficionado) to join me at JITB.  We synchronized our BlackJacks and met up at the corner of O'Farrell and Mason.  We've been talking about Ultimate Cheeseburgers and Sourdough Jacks in the past 48 hours, so it was exciting to know that we will eventually get satisfaction.\n\nI took the 6-Parnassus and got off on 6th and Market.  It was such a nice day for a stroll, so I walked up Mason, which was perfumed with the day's fresh sprinkling of urine.  I see Luis at the corner of the parking structure and we head up a block to JITB.\n\nHe was set on getting a sourdough jack and two-for-99cents tacos, and a regular-sized rootbeer.  I had a mac n' cheese lunch (craving for comfort food) and some curly fries, so I felt it would've been a daunting task to order a Bacon Bacon Cheeseburger, or a Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger, or an Ultimate Cheeseburger.  I was almost tempted to just get the Grilled Cheese (off the Kid's Menu), but I had to stay focused and get a sandwich that had some meat.  I settled for a Sourdough Jack and a regular soda.  Asked for two packets of mayonnaise and we were set.\n\nLuis noticed that there was an upstairs dining area.  We ascended the stairs and marveled at how empty the area was.  There were fake floral arrangements everywhere, but the place was very clean and devoid of human presence.  We chose a cozy corner table, in front of one of three security cameras that monitored whatever activity at the upstairs area.  \n\nWe both agreed that this area was somewhat of a haven for vagabonds who may need a place to crash.  Speaking of vagabonds, a wise crack-head, with a bright turqouise 90s styled jacket and green pajamas (bedecked with Christmas bells prints), joined us upstairs.  He kept a distance, being careful not to cross whatever areas that can be captured by the security cameras.  Luis gave me the play by play, as I was not facing the dude. \n\nL: Grace, just keep eating your sandwich.  There's a guy right there who is changing his pants.\nG: I don't care.... can I look?\nL: well... yeah okay, he's done.\nG: oh.\n\nwe continue to eat.\n\nL: Grace, he has a shank\nG: (turns around)  wow.  I bet he's using it to cut up some coke or crack\nL:  yeah, he looks like he is cutting up something.\nG: oh yeah he is!  wow, i only heard of stories, but never really saw this stuff in action.  oh heck no, he is straight up sniffing some stuff.\n\nwe continue to enjoy our wonderfully-made Sourdough Jacks.\n\nL: Grace, he is smoking\nG: (thinking.... \"I can't smell cigarette smoke\") really?

I went inside and waited. When she was done, she just bolted. Hmm, beats me? So as I peed, I look to my left and I SEE SITTING FEET. AND A PAIR OF JEANS ON THE GROUND BY THE FEET.

Turns out it was a tweaker who was just making those faces to me JUST 'CAUSE. (ARE YOU SERIOUS, I FEEL SO WEIRD NOW) So then I sort of freaked out more! This tweaker asked me why all the ladies don't like him, and I told him to relax because everything will fall into place (which is true). I WANTED MY BOYFRIEND TO GET OUT OF THAT DAMNED LINE ALREADY (it wasn't long but it felt like AGES). My bf kept glancing at me while the tweaker was talking to me, or should I say tweaking to me.

I don't know what the overall implications for society as a whole this holds, but nobody thought to call the authorities until some obvious tourists stopped next to him and asked, \"Um...is he okay?\" \n\nFor whatever reason, it didn't occur to me that this fellow might indeed be dead, but that question seemed to stir the crowd up a bit, and someone called 911. Despite the commotion, the man was still lying there motionless when an unidentified woman described him to the dispatcher. After getting off the phone, the callers walked away, and a sizable semi-circle now surrounded the presumed corpse, with a muted murmur buzzing about us all being potential witnesses to a, well, dead man.\n\nI'm not sure what the typical 911 reaction time is in the city, but I do think the proper paramedics arrived within five to seven minutes. The only thing about that was, after about four to six minutes, the man woke up, looked around, stood, brushed himself off, and walked away into the night. Who knows, maybe he was auditioning for Saw 7, or whichever sequel they're shooting today or planning for tomorrow.\n\nBy the time the paramedics arrived, so too was the 38 bus. We boarded and were off, borne ceaselessly to the past.\n\nAs for the Jack in the Box, it might be blasphemous to say this, but the two tacos for ninety-nine cents is a meal I've been taking advantage of for probably eleven years now. I say it might be blasphemous because of the abundance of tacquerias in the city, but in the end, Jack is the only place where you can buy a taco with a slice of American cheese, questionable \"meat\" consistency, and melting lettuce all deliciously packed together in one crispy semi-circuitous package. Jack In the Box hot sauce is a must, and the sour cream is also good if you want to shave seven minutes off of the end of your life as opposed to just four.", "author": "Eric M."}

It's average fast food. There's nothing about it that really stands out, in a good or bad way. When I go here I know my taste buds will be going \"meh\" with every bite, but at least my stomach will be happy. To their credit, the seasoned curly fries are pretty tasty, but I've yet to have a more than average \"entree\" here.\n\nAs has been mentioned before, this place is a major homeless magnet. But what makes it worse is that the employees do not care in the slightest. At all. I can't think of a single other business I've been to in this city (outside of the Tenderloin obviously) that is as tolerant of homeless people as this place. I bet they'd let them sleep on the tables if they tried, that's honestly how little they care.\n\nAs you can imagine, this makes the dining experience here horrible. If you come here, it's in your best interest to just get your food as quickly as possible and leave. It's okay during the day, but at night... well, let me put it this way. The last time I dined here at night, a bum stole a dollar from me because I didn't have my \"bumdar\" active when he asked for a dollar in exchange for 4 quarters, two homeless people came up to my friend and I during our meal to ask for some change, and during the 15 seconds it took me to get a straw, a homeless person managed to run down from the upper level, beg my friend for her milkshake, and leave with it before I got back. That experience may be a bit worse than normal but I assure you that it's very much a rarity to have a bum-free experience here.", "author": "Brian R."}
