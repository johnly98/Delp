It's a small place and quite a few people were there. 2 guys were completely wasted, and i saw one start to choke a girl (trying to be playful) and she ran out. My friend and i sat down and the same guy came over and started talking to us, not leaving when we said no to all of his advances. He went back to his friend and the bartender, and it was clear they knew the bartender well if not close friends. the two guys came back over more aggressively this time, the other one trying to get my friend to dance. When she said no and pulled her jacket up to cover herself out of discomfort, i looked over at the bartender who was watching and laughing. The guy in front of my friend then announced \"are you touching yourself under there? she's touching herself!\" \nwe looked at each other and pushed our way out, leaving feeling violated and dehumanized.", "author": "Andreya A."}

It's pretty nice considering my schedual at times to hit the \"200 review\" mark. So shotout to the city of \"San Francisco!\" North Beach in particular. All my milestone reviews (50, 100, 150) have come from me visiting \"SF\" spots. Now my review for Mr Bings gets to sit at \"200\" I've heard so much about this \"North Beach\" legendary dive bar. Word on the street (and the sign in the window) states this bar went through an ownership change. But the new owners want to still live up to the classic \"Mr Bings\" when they move their establishment in. But in the meantime it's still \"Mr Bings\" was it worth the hype? Well let's find out..\n\nAugust 24, 2016 Wednesday - One man (me) looking to catch a happy hour and go somewhere I never been before.\n\nAtmosphere - 2/5\nService - 3/5\nCleanliness - 3/5\n\nBackground - Mr Bings has been around for sometime. Some say \"It's a right of passage\" so it's only fitting that I set foot in there. Considering SF is like my second home to an extant.\n\nAtmosphere - Mr Bings is old, and you can see it..smell it..and feel it as you walk through the small nook if you wanna call it that, of a bar/dive. Stool seating is what is offered here. Although on the other side of the bar has beer boxes and such piled up taking away seating space.\n\nDrinks - I had two Coronas @ $4.50 a piece. That's a pretty decent price, still \"somewhat\" competitive.\n\nService - The lady that tended bar this day was polite and soft spoken. I don't know if that's a good formula for a bartender in the Bay Area, especially in \"North Beach\" she kinda went and sat away from the patrons. She came and tended us if we called her over, but the non interaction was kinda off putting. But at least the Coronas were cold and delicious.\n\nOverall - Mr Bings may not be for everyone,  but this place still has character. It really is a bar I'm sure every Bay Area bar hopper have a story to tell about their time here, young or old. I wouldn't say it left an huge impression on me..\"But\" I did cross this off my \"North Beach\" list of must visit places.\n\nFuture - Sure, I will visit again but the places where my \"crowns\" wait for me take first priority.", "author": "Tre S."}

Thank you for your service to the community.  \n\nYou served the working class in a high class town.  You served the strippers.  The mechanics.  The cooks.  The bartenders from all over town.  The suits.  The ties.  The tech workers.  The tourists.  The celebrities.  The bums.   The drunks. The drinkers. \n\nIn the end, you served so many, so well, in your little corner of San Francisco that you made us all return over and over again.  You gave us memories.  Helped us erase bad ones.  And kept doing your thing for so many years.  \n\nA part of San Francisco died today.  Progress comes one funeral at a time.  Today was your funeral.  Your passing makes way for the new.  And while it may not be the same, or even better, it will be new again.   Which any luck, what comes after you will one day be remembered as fondly as you were.  \n\nTime marches on and stops for no one, or no Bing.  \n\nCheers to you!  And may we all never forget you, until we ourselves are forgotten. \n\nAu revoir Mr. Bings.  So long, and farewell.  We move on into the night and the future, sadly, without you.   \n\nUPDATE FOR REOPENING UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP-\n\nMr. Bing's Dive Bar.  These words no longer have any meaning.  What once was, is no longer.  It lives on in our memories and the famous sign still attached to the exterior.  On the outside nothing has changed.  The rust on the sign still evident from years of neglect, pigeon excrement and San Francisco fog.  Familiar.  Welcoming.  Inside, a shock to the system to those who remember.  Gone is the horseshoe bar, the tennis painting, Ms. Pacman,  the warmth of the neon sign, and gladly, in this case, the mad dash of the occasional Chinatown cockroach.  \n\nWhat is gone has been renewed with a less soulful and less joyous reflection of San Francisco as a hard working town.  There are better spirits, craftier beers, new paint, lower lighting and gasp, candles on small tables.  The old shoddy and  thoughtless artwork has been reimagined John Taffer Bar Rescue style, complete with partial barrel wall adornments.  \n\nWhile the hookers, strippers, drinkers, drunks, and industry types move up the hill, deeper into Chinatown (Li Po, Buddha Lounge, and Bow Bow) the new Mr. Bing's feels like the overflow lounge for the far superior and pricier Comstock Saloon 20 feet across the street. This doesn't feel like Mr. Bing's and while that is ok, the future advances mercilessly, leaving the old behind.  I'd bet that this bar would be better served retiring the name, and the rotting sign, and rebranding entirely, thus avoiding comparison to what was, and blazing a new path for the location.  \n\nI do wish them the best, and I will continue to gaze admiringly whenever I walk by, and drown my sentimentality up the hill at Li Po, or plod into north beach and rest in Gino and Carlo. \n\nI stand by the five star rating because the new location offers good quality and much better service than the old Bing's.  Best of luck!", "author": "Michael D."}

That was part of Mr. Bing's allure: it was a classic dive bar, a place where you order a beer-and-a-shot from the bartender, not a handcrafted cocktail from a mixologist. You didn't come here for the service or the cleanliness of the place. You came here for drinks that were stiff and cheap. \n\nIt was easy to find the bar right outside of Chinatown and I remember a few of my visits were on Saturday afternoons. They went like this: buy a beer and a shot, leave my change on the bar, pump some money into the jukebox, return to my seat, and people watch while enjoying the music. Then repeat until there were a few bucks for a tip and make a quiet exit. \n\nLong live Mr. Bing's.", "author": "Ruel G."}

That has officially changed. I rarely ever write one star reviews as I generally have great experiences wherever I go (thanks to Yelp) but, my last experience here is deserving of such low standing. \n\nIf you haven't been to Mr. Bings before you should know that it isn't known for friendly service, great drinks or clean bathrooms, it's just a part of its \"charm\" and you put up with it. In fact, when I think about it, this place has to be violating so many health codes it's not even funny. \n\nThat being said, a friend and I stopped by on Friday night for a quick \"pop\" and were swiftly greeted by some pretty poor service. I'd never seen the two bartenders before as it's generally a couple older gentleman but, these two \"youngins\" had the shift that night. It seemed like they had a few friends sitting at the bar and didn't want anyone else in there. One of these friends was what I'll call, \"an appraisive patron\" and was quite rude to me and my friend. We shrugged it off and tried to order a drink from the younger female bartender who swiftly replied, \"you need to leave\". Much to our surprise and the couple sitting next to us, we were very confused. We decided to stay for one drink after pleading our case and needless to say were \"mean mugged\" all night. The vibes were pretty negative. \n\nSo in conclusion, farewell Mr. Bings. You had a good run but, will forever be tainted because of two bad apples (employees). Oh, and fix the mens bathroom. Even for me it's pretty gross.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

All for about $5 a shot.\n\nWell, I just happened to stumble on Bings again this week and how could I not stop in??? I am glad to report that nothing has changed and the dive factor that makes this place cool is still in full effect. The sticker cover condom machine in the bathroom gives this place a sixth star all by itself.\n\nA couple of things to know about Bings.  Don't bring a posse. The place holds maybe 30 people if you sit on each others' shoulders. It's small, for locals, and they give zero shits why you are in town or who you know.  Potty before you come. The bathrooms here border on third world and you only want to use them in case of emergency. Boys have it easier than girls in this place as we have proper equipment for not touching anything.

Felt like it was not really a place to make friends or be loud.\nIt was quite...interesting.... They have jukebox, dollar for one music. \n\nThe restroom have one stall, that I know of, for the women.\n\nMy friend started to order our first drink, which was AMF.... \nThe bartender was not cheap with the alcohol.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-01", "description": "How have I been in San Francisco this long and not gone to Mr. Bing's? It's probably because I pooh-poohed it for years. I've walked by that tired-looking, circa-1956 sign hundreds of times never giving it a moment's thought until of course, a very drunk Anthony Bourdain showed up there on \"The Layover\" and immediately praised it as a \"fine drinking establishment\". So when I was going out with my gal pal Rene for a little nosh at Bix nearby, it was my brilliant idea to come here afterward for a nightcap last Wednesday night. Unless you're a social hermit like myself, you already know Mr. Bing's is at the vague line of demarcation between Chinatown and North Beach on a prime corner spot on Columbus Avenue (photo: http://bit.ly/Zz69Eh).\n\nThe odd angle of the building in which it is housed makes the V-shape bar the dominant feature of the space (photo: http://bit.ly/YcYWsF). It looks like it once aspired to be a tiki bar but failed miserably and ended up wallowing as a seedy dive buoyed by the high-spirited company it attracts. It was pretty quiet that evening except for a group of hooligans I thought were college kids on spring break. Imagine my surprise when I turned my head to discover the people were around my age. One particularly obnoxious character kept flashing his ample beer belly to passers-by outside the window letting out a girlish whoop. Even more bizarrely, a pair of women kept taking photos of him from their iPhones perhaps to send as incriminating evidence to his obviously soon-to-be-ex-wife.\n\nRene and I parked ourselves quite comfortably and ordered with alcoholic aplomb, the likes of which haven't been seen since Mickey Rourke and Faye Dunaway in \"Barfly\". Probably around six bucks a piece (...who can remember?), she ordered a gin and tonic, while I had a Makers Mark and ginger (photo: http://bit.ly/Yltafa). We kept quizzing the bartender about Bourdain, but he said he was hired after the episode taping. So much for anecdotes we could share with our grandkids one day. I have to tell you after I downed my second drink, I was feeling more than relaxed. All I needed was a mirror, so I could pretend I was Jack Lemmon looking at his reflection in \"Days of Wine and Roses\" as he says, \"I wonder who that bum is. Look at me. Look at you. Now look at me again. We're a couple of bums.\" I smell an Oscar nomination.\n\nCOCKTAILS - 4 stars...feeling no pain\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...the dive to end all dives in SF (photo: http://bit.ly/18nATs9)\nSERVICE - 4 stars...he poured 'em with \u00e9lan\nTOTAL - 4 stars...now I feel like having a fat greasy burger at Sam's (belch)", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-16", "description": "This bar deserves to be on everyone's bucket list because it has such personality.  Ambiance is very important to me.  The ambiance in this place is so bad that it becomes \"good\".  Neon lights flood the place with light making you think you are in a bad hamburger stand somewhere in a bad part of Bakersfield... only the people behind the counter serving you the drinks appear to be strangers from Chinatown who have as much interest serving drinks to you as they do cleaning up the cages of the live animals they have for sale.  I love the steely eye indifference the orders are taken, the robotic and bored movements required to make your drink served with expressionless faces that instantly turn away once the drink is deposited in front of you.  The animal has been serviced.  Next?\n\nTime stands still in this place.  There is absolutely no effort that goes into making Mr. Bings better or worse.  It is what it is and it will always be as long there is someone in the family that owns the place to come in and crank the handle on this family cash cow.\n\nThe night I was there, we had been at the Comstock across the street for drinks.  I loved the place when it was San Francisco Brewery... now The Comstock.  I hate it.  At Mr. Bings, one of the Comstock waiters that served us came in after his shift to have  glass of Mr. Bing house white wine and hit off  the Chinese girl who serves.  She clearly had no interest in him and it was pathetic to watch him attempt conversation with the people behind the bar who wanted nothing to do with the losers that come in for their fix.  It appears that he wanted to be \"a regular\".  \"Hey!  You know me!  I've been coming here every night for a month!\" - but each time anyone comes into Mr. Bings it's like a flock of chickens - none of them have names, they all make the same sounds and they all look alike.\n\nGo to Mr. Bings.  You will feel like you are doing something illegal - it should be.\n\nTip:  My friends ordered up a Homobile to take them home after Mr. Bings.  While waiting for the car he started to get into the wrong car and the driver turned on him with such fury that I was astonished: \"Get out of my car you f#!@ you  f@!!!$5 or I'll kill you!\".  (My friend is one of the kindest and most loveable people you'd ever want to meet.)  Just double check before getting into a strange car:  Is it my homobile or not?", "author": "Steve S."}

Yeah, I hadn't either until I came to Mr. Bing's. I'm actually shocked by how high their rating is, because it was, hands down, the worst bartender experience I've ever had, for a bar that was already pretty gross inside.\n\nI walked in this past Friday night, post-happy hour to meet some friends that were already there and was immediately turned off by the mildew, locker room stench emanating from the bar. It is also cash only and I didn't have any cash, so I was waiting for my friends to finish up so we could leave.\n\nThe bartender came up to us, immediately with an attitude, and asked to see all of our IDs, even the people that already had drinks in their hands. I explained I wasn't drinking and she said it doesn't matter. I understand this is reasonable! This is not what I was upset about, but she literally was looking at us as if we were belligerent teenagers. So, since I felt very uncomfortable in this smelly bar, I, to be fair rather dramatically, said let's go I don't like this place to my friends, which caused her to flippantly wave me out the bar. When my friends were taking a long time getting out of the bar, I went to go grab them and she yelled at me to get out the bar. When I said I hadn't even done anything, she just continued yelling at me to get out. I tried to ask what I had done and she just looked straight ahead refusing to talk to me. I asked what her name was and she refused to talk. Hey if you're going to be a complete, unreasonable jerk to your customers and drive out a party of 8 people, at least be professional enough to give me a reason and your name. Also, yup, she'd rather lose the business of 8 people then try to be remotely friendly.\n\nWhen I called the next morning to make a complaint, they hung up on me.\n\nSo, yeah, clearly this dive bar doesn't care about customer service, but avoid the very angry, Asian bartender with the tattoo on her shoulder since I don't know her name.... Better yet, avoid the bar entirely.", "author": "Christina R."}

If AB recommends something, then I trust his opinion, because in AB I trust. And Mr. Bing's did NOT disappoint, if dive bars are your thing. They are mine. Seriously, I have a fondness for dive bars. No beer on tap, cranky bartenders, people of questionable integrity, and bathrooms so vile you're almost tempted to piss on yourself rather than have to come within 20 feet of a toilet that's never seen a scouring brush.\n\nWith it's triangle-shaped bar, and one of the most ruthless games of Liar's Poker I've ever seen - basically, it's a dice game where you try to bullshit your opponent into believing what you've got under your dice shaker is the truth; get caught lying, and you drink. Heavily. Now, I consider myself an expert on the dark art of bullshitting, but the bartender, a crazy Chinese fucker named Scooter (I kid you not) , seemed like he was a Zen master, and I wasn't about to get my ass handed to me so easily, especially from someone that kept taunting his pathetic opponents with \"You're not gonna like this!\" - Mr. Bing's was spectacular in its seedy glory.\n\n(A quick business proposition to Mr. Bing himself: wanna make some extra cash? Then sell some t-shirts with Scooter's face on it, with the caption, \"You're not gonna like this!\" Make some extra dough. I get 50% just for thinking about it. You're welcome.)\n\nAnd my wife and I got royally drunk. I mean, I remember hopping in a cab, and walking into the hotel room and pointing to the bed shouting, \"Oh, look, the hotel's giving away iPads!\" (duh, it's my wife's), and then wondering loudly, \"Uh, where the fuck are we?\"\n\nAfter that, I'm clueless. Because I don't remember putting myself to bed.\n\nAnd, yes, I did check to make sure my organs were still intact. Hot damn, I love Mr. Bing's, but I wasn't too fond of the hangover. \n\nI can't wait to go back to San Fran, so I can abuse my liver in such a lack of luxury and restraint.", "author": "Gus S."}

On our last day, a Sunday, our flight didn't leave until late in the evening so my wife suggested that we find a place to watch our Houston Texans play their first pre-season game.  I assured her it would be impossible since it was pre-season and I was certain we would only find the 49ers and the Raiders on television.  She acknowledged that it would be unlikely by suggested we try just the same.  We headed over to Chinatown because that is always a great place to people watch and have some lunch.\n\nWe had finished lunch and were walking down Pacific towards Columbus and lo and behold, looking through the window of Mr. Bing's we saw the Houston Texans pre-game analysis taking place on a beautiful large screen television positioned over a quaint neighborhood bar.  I looked at my wife and said, \"you were right!\"  In we went, found two seats at the bar and watched a great game.  We enjoyed ourselves so much that we didn't leave the place until after dark and headed straight to the airport to catch our flight.\n\nSince then, anytime we are in San Francisco we make a point to spend a couple of hours and enjoy a cold beer at Mr. Bing's.

There's no beers on tap.  The bar is a little short and not very neat.  There's very little wall art.\n\nHowever, this place just has some kind of charm that I can't seem to describe.  I think it may be the jovial bartender, who does tend to get a little distracted but passes out drinks like it's his job (wait... it is).  I think back to when we first arrived here there was about one other person in the bar.  It was some guy sitting near the front with an empty shot glass in front of him.  He was going toe to toe with the bartender on Crown Royal shots.  Yeah, the bartender's glass was smaller than the patron's but unless the bartender was somehow sneaking water into his own glass, the patron looked to be in pretty bad shape.  It's possible this is why the bartender was so happy.\n\nGetting to play games while drinking Tsingtao and Jagermeister shots is great.  Playing liars dice after a few drinks helps you understand why the dice are so weathered.  You may not be able to bet money but I'll be dammed if that doesn't lead to betting shots.  If fact, if your game doesn't become a drinking game, you're doing something wrong.\n\nOverall, this place gets a lot of points.  Lots of booze, average beer selection (I do like Tsingtao), wasn't very crowded with plenty of room to jaw with your pals or get an intense dice game going.  This place does feel like a true dive bar; mostly regulars and folks looking for a drink more than just hipsters or preps trying to be cool by \"slumming it\".", "author": "Steven R."}

You've never noticed it was even there, despite the backlit sign in split yellow and and faded white, with dated red cursive proclaiming the name of the establishment.\n\nIt's right across the alley from the San Francisco Brewing Company and, so far as I know, they have no beers on tap---just bottles. And a weird circular depression in the ceiling that looks as though a chandelier might once have dangled from this spot in more...ahem...glorious times. Although the ceiling is so low that a chandelier would have knocked over any but the most stout little dwarf.\n\nThat's because Mr. Bings was once a haven for Chinese dwarves who were shunted off to the periphery of Chinatown back in the railroad days. Old Grandpa Bing himself would serve tea and listen to the dwarves tell their tales of woe: how they were relegated to inspecting railroad ties on account of them being so close to the ground, how they were picked on by the Irish and Italian dwarves that they shared quarters with, and how all they wanted in life was a cheap hooker and burlap sack to call their home. \n\nThose were the Halcyon days of Mr. Bing's, which is now staffed by the great-great-grandson of Mr. Bing, who is also known as Mr. Bing.", "author": "Zak N."}

The drinks are stiff, the prices are right, and they went out of their way to not only order Talisker for me but to give me the best price in the city on a glass.  \n\nRobert, Scooter, and Bruce are great.  Become a regular and they will remember your name, your drink, and greet you at the door like an old friend.  \n\nCome play liars dice, throw back a couple cheap stiff drinks, and don't be afraid to stick some money in the jukebox.", "author": "shannon d."}

As some others have mentioned, the drinks here are poured VERY FREELY, so you bettah watch your step.  And of course I dig the awful painting, but I also dig the 5 gallon white plastic buckets that formerly held soy sauce that now serve as ashtrays.\n\nClassy touch.\n\nThere's still some folks who think my friend Mariann's real name is Barbara Brown, but that's a whole 'nother story.", "author": ".Hon H."}

It will be a knowing smile and one tinged with amusement and maybe sadness for a lost opportunity, regret and yes, perhaps even lost love, for this place is where dreams can be made and broken.  On first glance the place doesn't look too grand, but the bartender soon sorts that out.  True, you will be very lucky to get the drink you asked for, but it is sure to taste all the more sweet for it.  The moment of the night came when some pissed-up tourist asked my mate if he wanted a shot.  He asked for Cheese-liquor whatever the hell that is.  The bartender asked with amazement \"Are you serious?!!!!\".  This is a first for me.  Surely to Christ if you stock a drink you have to know there is a very real possibility that someone may ask for a drink of it at some point.  Hey, who am I to argue with Mr Bing, or rather his son, Bruce?\n\nBeen several times afterwards.  Love it and look forward to next week when I will be there again.  Get the Cheese-liquor ready Bruce!\n\nOh, I also got told a great piece of advice here.  Never eat Chinese food on a Saturday, because there is a good chance the chefs will have lost all their money gambling and will be pissed-off.\n\nThere was another occasion there involving some drunk Texans and The Hustler place opposite, but that is a bit racy for this place!", "author": "nottellinya a."}
