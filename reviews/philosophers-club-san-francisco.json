It actually has a cool theme, stiff drinks, and great parking/location.\n\nGot a drink before watching a movie for date night. We both agreed we would get a beer next time. Our drinks weren't the tastiest, but they were strong. Props to our bartender. I was craving a whiskey sour and bae got an old-fashioned. But we both agreed they tasted on the sweeter side. I was disappointed, but should've KNOWN that the sour would've been a pre-made mix. Ah well. Next time I'll get a kamikaze or a well drink. Although the selection on tap is slim (think VERY BASIC like Blue Moon and Red Trolley), they do have a wider selection of alcohol vs beer. \n\nIn terms of the service, I give it a BIG 5 stars. AWESOME bar staff. There were two guys taking care of the entire bar, and they were so welcoming and friendly. I definitely don't always feel comfortable as an Asian girl at someone else's local watering hole, so I really appreciated how friendly and smiley the guys were. They were playing the Warriors game, which is mainly why most people were there. There are lots of seating options from tall bar stools to high tops and tables in the back. The place is cozy and inviting, not dingy and smelly like wet carpet. \n\nI'd definitely come back if in the area!", "author": "Jodi H."}

She then walked away very angry. She walked over to another bartender and was telling him the story with her hands all in the air mad. Like okay my bad for asking a bartender to make a drink. 10 minutes later my boyfriend went and asked another bartender for a sex on the beach and the bartender makes it no problems at all. So why couldn't that lady make it, I have no clue. Then about a hour later I seen the lady outside the bar talking to a group of ladies, and what is she talking to the ladies about, ME!! Telling them the story of me asking her to make me a sex on the beach.

I know a place that should satisfy those needs. The Philosopher's club is at a superb location, next to the West Portal station, which probably explains why it's been there so long. As soon as you walk through those heavy doors you can feel time stop. There is a full wall decorated with old photos of San Francisco, mostly showing the construction of West Portal. And if you look above you can find a mural of brilliant philosophers watching over as you drink, from Bob Dylan to Gandhi, they got the them all.\nThe drinks are standard, nothing really fancy. There's a jukebox, and a pool table in the back. Like I sad, nothing fancy.

It's an older bar which got a facelift a few years ago so it's no longer the uber-divey one you might remember, so the prices might not be, either.  But you who are reading this, have you been to West Portal lately?  What are you doing here looking for a dive bar?  It's a nice neighborhood with several wine bars and restaurants and even a movie theater.  I don't think there's a single dive bar in this area!\n\nBut I digress.  Say the MUNI is broken that day (It usually is, the switch at the West Portal station always undergoing some kind of repair or another) and you need a spot to wait for a half hour.  Say you got fired or are otherwise having a terrible day.  You wander into the Philosopher's Club, and it's going to be dark.  There's going to be a regular playing the golf game in the corner, another couple of regulars warming their seats at the bar.  Depending on the day another couple of regulars are playing pool in the back.  Someone (Deb or Sully or whomever else is manning the bar) will greet you with a warm welcome.  On the counter there will inevitably be a couple of glasses of alcohol with coasters on them-- some other folks probably went outside for a smoke or went to go get some food (Philly's has no kitchen so you have all of the options of West Portal to choose from).\n\nSo let's say you sit down.  If this is your first time, they'll ask you what you'd like to drink.  If it's your second time in here they'll remember what you had last time and ask if you want it again.  If you're a regular they'll have the drink ready for you before you sit down.  Check out a game on the TV's, sit, relax, take in the jovial conversations around you, and take the time to realize that your life isn't that bad, sitting here.\n\nThis being a neighborhood bar EVERYONE in here is a regular.  If you are not, a regular will strike up a conversation with you, (or not, if you want to be left alone they're good about that too), and you'll become a regular in no time.  Folks who come back like it because it's their second home, and it's why i keep coming back; everyone's welcome here.  If a neighborhood bar is NOT what you're looking for then this isn't your place.  There are other divier, cheaper places to get blackout drunk.  But why would you want to do that here, anyway, sitting amongst friends?", "author": "Iris N."}

This bar SCREAMS old-school San Francisco and has a community of very dedicated regulars of all ages (literally - I've run into friends of my friends' parents). Decorations include old black and white photographs of SF over the years in addition to tons of Giants, Niners, and other local sports memorabilia (including high schools). This is a bar that can serve nearly any type of drinker's need. I've seen people alone at the bar in daylight with a shot and a beer, engaged in deep conversations with the bartender, I've seen the bar go from empty to packed with rowdy fans after a Niners game, I've partaken in pre (and post)-St. Patrick's Day parade festivities, and I've probably most enjoyed my time there on Sunday afternoons.\n\nMy recommendation: start with the great Bloody Mary's (can be made extra spicy), and after a few, switch to draft beer and catch up with a friend while watching a Giants game. Often times there's a free community potluck going on on Sundays near the back of the bar. They're cash only, but they have an ATM right in front, drinks are cheap, and trust me, you'll need the cash anyways after a few drinks when the jukebox starts calling your name.\n\nTextbook example of a \"come as you are\" type establishment - everyone is welcomed here.", "author": "Laura H."}

That way, you can see many of the baseball games or football games that are on. \n\nThe bartender was super friendly! He cracks a few jokes and talks to all the customers. He's pretty prompt and aware of who needs something. \n\nThe prices are pretty decent. Beers on tap were $5 each. A shot of Jameson was $6. I don't know if it was cheaper for happy hour (we were there at 6pm ish) but I'd definitely want to stop by here the next time I park at West Portal before a Giants game!", "author": "Connie Y."}

I really should spend more time in this area since they are so many gems, and the Philosopher's Club is one of them. \n\nMy friend, Amy, recommended PC, and total props to her for doing so. \nWe walked in and literally a minute later decided to order some snacks from Bulls Head next door to bring back to PC. *BTW, I love when bars allow outside food to be brought inside their establishment*\nAs we walked out, the bartender and friends at bar waved and said bye to us, and we assured them that we'd return. Maybe, they thought that we were scared off by this bar or something, BUT that was so far from the truth. \nWe were totally vibing this place, which was clean with cool interior, pool tables in the back, and flat screen TVs (with the Warrior game on) throughout the bar, etc.,  OK, so it also helped that there were some cuties hanging out, too. Duh, we'd be stupid to not come back! \n\nSo, after returning with fries and mini corn dogs from next door, we sit at a table close to the lone video game. Chowing on our snacks (which were tasty treats), drinking our brewskies (which were oh so refreshing), and soaking in the PC vibe (which we were totally diggin' as while girl chatting, we were also checking out the eye candy and Warriors game) :) \n\nBartender was friendly and knew many of the patrons, who seem to be a mix of young and old, and definitely locals. This is the type of bar that reminds me of Cheers - friendly and not stuffy; no frills but not exactly divey; and yes, where everybody knows your name (and if they don't, they will soon enough)! \n\nUnfortunately, my first PC experience was cut short since we had to head back to the Empire for the flick. Rest assured, I'll return to spend more than just an hour and one round of drinks at PC. I predict a fun, crazy drunken eve here in the near future! :)", "author": "Gill C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-11-19", "description": "West Portal is a principal shopping street for much of southwestern San Francisco, California, and is also considered a neighborhood itself. Named for the western terminus of the Muni tunnel beneath Twin Peaks that opened in 1918, the street (West Portal Avenue) and adjacent district is still dominated by the frequent trundlings of the three Muni Metro lines (K, L and M) that emerge from the subway to run in the street median. The ride in the subway from West Portal to downtown/Union Square is about fifteen minutes.\n\nWest Portal lies directly adjacent to several larger San Francisco neighborhoods: the affluent and lushly verdant Forest Hill and St. Francis Wood neighborhoods on the east and south, Parkside (a southern sub-district of the Sunset District) on the north, and at the western end of the Avenue, Lakeshore Village and Merced Manor. The residential areas of the West Portal neighborhood, like several of the adjacent districts, are unusual for San Francisco in that the homes are often detached, albeit with small yards. The frequent fog helps keep the area green in the usually rainless summer months, and on a clear day, the park above the tunnel provides a view of the Marin Headlands and the Farallon Islands in the Pacific.\n\nIn addition to the streetcar tunnel, West Portal's landmarks include a large movie theater, a library, a school, churches (including the prominent West Portal Lutheran Church and School), many good restaurants (Fuji, Roti, (Old Krakow[1]), El Toreador, Xiao Loong, Fresca, Fuji, Bursa, Spiazzo), bars (Portal's Tavern[2], Philosophers' Club, The Dubliner, Joxer Dailys), a bookstore (BookShop West Portal ([3]), drugstores (Walgreens and Rite Aid), markets, coffeeshops (Starbucks, Pete's Cafe, Greenhouse), a bakery (West Portal Bakery), professional offices, a video rental store (Diamond Videos), and many beauty salons. There is also a childcare located in the west portal area ABC Childcare which has been around since 1988. Despite the semi-recent appearances of larger chain stores, the many unique neighborhood shops give the area a distinctly smaller-city, \"retro\" charm. The West Portal Muni Metro Station is located at the entrance to the Muni tunnel at the northern end of West Portal Ave.\n\nI have a wooden token from this bar that entitles me to 1 free drink of any make or measure. hahaaha  I will never use it.  I like the Dubliner down the street but it does not have that much history.\n\nInfodiva hiccup here...  I am not a morning drinker!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-04-08", "description": "So the other evening, I got a call from a belligerently drunk very good friend of mine demanding my presence at Edinburg Castle (on Geary in the Loin) in 30 minutes. Considering that I was already drunk after a very long & taxing week (shit, try THREE weeks), I obliged. Grudgingly.\n\nI grabbed my frequently rowdy roommate & pitched the idea. Predictably he was all in. Within about 40 minutes, we were sipping on some dranks at the bar with a few of my co-workers (who just so happened to be there) when my buddy staggered in with about 25 wasted kids. Turns out they were riding around town in a Mexican Drunk Bus (yes, that's the official name), & my friend was in NO SHAPE to continue. I made him drink a large glass of ice water, bought a few slices of pizza next door, & sent him home in a cab.\n\nBefore I knew what was happening, I found myself being ushered onto this bus of amazing fools against my will & better judgement. Within minutes, we were climbing fast towards Twin Peaks blasting Neutral Milk Hotel. Half-empty cans of Tecate which someone -- or several someones -- had thought prudent to set on the floor of the bus earlier in the night, had tipped over & were trickling beer down the aisles & clinking against the sides of the bus as we rounded the big bend up, up up. The lights of the city shimmered like broken glass below us & stretched all the way out to the Bay. A drunk girl was performing small but dangerous gymnastic feats on the handlebars attached to the ceiling. She swung as the bus shifted, & those of us who weren't completely 'faced started to wear looks of worry, concerned with the ever-increasing probability that a nasty fall was imminent. Half the bus was furiously smoking cigarettes, but really really coolly, like the way James Dean must've smoked when he wanted to act pissed off that everyone was watching him smoke, although that's what he secretly wanted everyone to be doing.\n\nI sat by the window next to rowdy roommate & another friend, half-smiling, half-horrified at this strange predicament. What in the hell are we DOING up here?! An hour ago I was ready to goto bed & now I'm in TWIN PEAKS! Drunk in a bus! With no escape! Listening to amazing (admittedly) music! Surrounded by screaming hipsters at half past midnight! Just a few months ago, I might have enjoyed this a lot more than I was enjoying it at that moment. But I've been finding it a lot harder to draw satisfaction from a fuckoff evening of drunken debauchery.\n\nSo, when we came down off the mountain & parked the bus in West Portal outside The Philosopher's Club, I was happy. Partly because this is an old haunt from when I worked at SFSU (\"old haunt\" meaning \"I went there twice & liked it\"), but partly because I wanted off that bus.\n\nLo & Behold, I walked in & saw my old friend Jesse working behind the bar. I've known this dude for quite awhile, & hadn't seen him in probably a year, so it was good to get a nice dose of familiarity out of everything. My $4 Sierra & some good catchup conversation redeemed the night.\n\nToo bad they had to usher us to Amber -- one of my all-time least favorite bars ever -- afterwards. I was in there for 10 minutes & still smelled like cigarette smoke the next morning. Fucking Amber.", "author": "Pete J."}
