We checked in with yelp which worked out perfectly because the wait was long once we arrived. Walking in, I looove the interior. It is very homey, apparently what my friends expected by the name (I was thinking sports bar). \n\nUpon sitting we were greeted immediately and decided to go with the unlimited mimosas which are $18 with entree purchase or $8/mimosa. I'm unsure if the unlimited version is weaker but had I paid the $8 and received the same mix, I would have been disappointed. They were very orange juice heavy. \n\nFor an appetizer, we split the crab puffs. Great price and super delicious! The crab tasted fresh, better than I would have expected. Would def order those again. A complimentary scone comes out per person with 2 jams and butter. So good. For the meal I went with the angry Benedict with shrimp, spinach, and Cajun hollandaise. My English muffin was a little soggy with the spinach over it in a different way than w hollandaise, and it was also super light on the hollandaise but a great flavor overall. I wasn't crazy about the potato pancake. It was super crispy and hard... maybe just not what I expected. My friends ordered the salmon/cream cheese scramble and the huevos rancheros and both said they were really good! I would definitely have brunch here again :)", "author": "Brittany N."}

Used to be very hole in the wall, but they just moved to a new location which is very trendy and a lot nicer. All of our past experiences have been great, but our most recent visit was subpar.

You can get bottomless for $18 pp or opt for a carafe for $27. Their iced coffee is also great and comes with free refills. \n\nAs for food, their Benedict's are good. I've had the smoked salmon in the past and loved it. This time I tried the crab cake Benedict and wasn't a huge fan. The crab cakes were pretty dry and didn't have a ton of flavor. \n\nMy boyfriend always gets the home run special with the waffle and bacon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-06", "description": "+1 star for having the Waitlist feature on the Yelp app because no one wants to be standing around hangry for brunch, especially on Lombard.\n\nWe were frequenters of the OG Home Plate - so much so that even after being out of the neighborhood for a couple years, we were recognized by staff. Man, is this new location a 180 into bougie brunch! The old spot had that greasy spoon vibe, was so small that even when empty felt crowded, and could use some updates (the espresso machine was so commonly broken that it became a running joke).\n\nSo I was super happy that the Home Plate team moved into a huge spot that can attract the Marina crowd who brunch like it's their job (yes, they have bottomless mimosas). The interior feels warm and inviting like a  modern Southern home: decor includes a plant wall, comfy stuffed chairs, fancy overhead lighting, and even upgraded dinner wear. The only detractor from the ambience was the prominent TV with Fox News - even if this wasn't SF, the 24 hour news cycle isn't really the brunch vibe I think they're going for.\n\nThe menu has been slimmed down with some carryovers and a few new additions (cotton candy on waffles, what??). The best part is always the complimentary scones and jam, which we eagerly awaited along with our lattes (sadly, no fat free milk just almond milk, but overall it was a decent cup). It took awhile for those to come out, but entrees were hot on their heels. Recalling that the waffles at the original spot went a little downhill, we opted for pancakes, which I had a bite of but weren't crave-worthy, and instead stuck to my granola and yogurt. The yogurt was a good dish despite the lopsided ratio of the two ingredients - I didn't need to finish all that granola, which was quite reminiscent of broken up Nature Valley bars. They accommodated my aversion to bananas and the fruit was perfect - definitely much fresher than at the old spot. I'm happy to report that another dish from our party, the crab omelette, is still generously packed with avocado.\n\nThe new Home Plate is the kind of place where you can take your parents (who have zero understanding of why you'd wait for any restaurant), and when your mom walks in she says \"ooh, this is nice honey.\" They're not the most adventurous eaters but love their classic go-tos and Home Plate has plenty of options to make sure everyone is well fed.", "author": "Cristina S."}

Our recent favorite also comes from the crab puffs, great bite before the meal. \n\nHowever my favorite menu item is the Angry Benedict. The Cajun style hollandaise is so different from any other brunch I've had. It truly takes a traditional Benedict and gives it a great savory and spicy spin. If you like sweet breakfast definitely try the crunchy French toast- great portions and attentive service here. Only wish my iced coffee was refilled! \n\nYou should definitely try this place for a date or a family meal. Super accessible and easy for any group of people and they do bottomless mimosas!", "author": "Tamara M."}

Came here because of the many good reviews of their food, but I guess most of them are from tourists that normally go to Waffle House. Had the crab Benedict and the smoked salmon Benedict, both were meh: soft, almost soggy English muffin, and a bland soggy mess for the crab cake. Salmon was ok, and at least the eggs were on point.

The original Home Plate was more like an old greasy spoon, something you might see on Diners and Dives. I was glad to see that they've moved to a new location, but the new restaurant, while keeping a little of the old SF Baseball theme, seems to be decked out for a swanky dinner party, including the jazz or ambience style music, vs a fun casual meal. I wish they would play up the farm or industrial theme a little more as it would fit better with what I think of as comfortable and casual. But that said, maybe a lot of people have blue flame gas fireplaces and formal chandeliers in their homes?

Normally we park at a structure down the waterfront, and head out to do the 15ish mi round-trip run...\n\n...but alas... we've never made it yet, ha ha.  Pretty much after getting off the bridge on the way back, and running down the side to the Golden Gate park on the bottom, always around the 9-12mi mark,  I hear something over the trance playing in my headphones..... \"no, Dean... no no NO NONONONONONO.............\"....\n\nYup, that's the signal for... breakfast time!  So, we've sorta made it our mission, forced by circumstances, to find some good breakfast near-ish to the bridge, and Home Plate, you're up!\n\n...alright... I'll just cut to the chase cause I got some stuff to do........... Home Plate is alright.  I had high hopes--there was a line outside and all that.  Had that upscaled downscaled feel SF breakfast places are so good at presenting.  Looked great.\n\nThen we saw the menu.  Pretty boring menu.  It was hard to find anything that excited me...\n\n1. Coffee $2.95\n\n2. Can of Diet Coke $1.75\n\n3. Bangkok Frittata $15.70 \"shrimps, mushroom, tomato, green onion, cilantro, jalapenos, kaffir lime leaves, galangal, served with 2 potato carrot pancakes or hash browns and toast\":  So, as I was saying everything looked very traditional and boring, but this stood out on their daily specials menu.  Glad I got it, cause it was certainly different, but it was truly a mess.  It's like they took a bunch of Asian flavors, mixed in some egg, and called it a day.  It's not eggs.  It's not an Asian dish.  Tasted alright--very spicy, and totally filled with seafood and bits of stuff.  Certainly wasn't cheap stuff.  But just didn't really satisfy.\n\nAlso, about those \"potato carrot pancakes\"... so, I've never had these before, and thus have no clue how they should taste.  Given that, take my opinion with a grain of salt, but they're basically wafers of semi-fried vegetables.  Kinda like a cheap crab cake minus the cheap crab.  Not what I was expecting at all.... 5/10\n\n4. Crab Melt Sandwich $14.95 \"crab, avocado, chives, jack cheese and house-made aioli served on grilled sourdough with salad and french fries\":  When this was placed in front of my gf I was shocked at how plain it looked.  A small sandwich of toasted bread and crab salad in the middle.  REALLY plain looking.  Well, I took a bite and was like....... okay, it's actually really good.  The crab is certainly not cheapo canned lump crab.  If it's not fresh, it's certainly some of the best canned crab you can buy.  So, you get a basic as all hell sandwich, but tasting really good for what it is.  6/10\n\n5. Smoked Salmon Bagel $13.95 \"served with 2 potato latkes, cream cheese, smoked salmon, pickles onions and capers\":  It's pretty much like any other smoked salmon bagel.  They certainly did not skimp on the salmon, and I can tell this is one of the higher grade smoked salmons.  Definitely better than the stuff at Costco.  But still, $14 is a bit steep.  Well, I guess $5-7 gets you half of their portion at a standard bagel shop, so, maybe it's not too outrageous... 6/10\n\nOh, they give you a free scone with fresh jams with the meal.  Nice touch.\n\nService was a bit lacking though.  They didn't refill the coffee or water unless you waive someone down.  No one came by to check on us either.\n\n3/5\n\n#breakfast #brunch #sanfrancisco #bridgerun", "author": "Dean C."}

The owners are friendly, hard-working, and courteous.  I've dined at their new location twice so far.  During my second visit, Kong the owner, excitedly informed me of his intent to open for dinner service in the near future.\nA few days later as I was brain storming where to plan my son's first birthday party, a thought came to mind.  What not ask Kong and Stella if they'd be interested in hosting an after-hours dinner service for my son's birthday party?  I figured it would be a win-win situation for them.  They'd get more exposure from my 40-50 guests while making some extra income.  On Thursday at 1:30pm, I called Home Plate and asked for Kong.  A young man answered the phone.  He said the owner was not available.  I then asked for Stella.  He told me she was busy.  So he offered to take a message from me.  I gave him my name and number and told him the reason I was calling.  He immediately said \" the owners do not want to do dinner.\" I asked him to please double check with the owners anyway and told the young man to ask Kong or Stella to call me back.  He seemed hesitant.  \nThe next morning around 10:30am, I decided to call Home Plate again in hopes of reaching one of the owners for a reply before I booked a different venue.  The same gentleman answered the phone.    I told him the reason I was calling again.  He said \"The owners are never here.  They only come to collect money.\"  He also insulted me by saying \"I cannot force the owners to call you.  If they are interested in your business, they will call you back.\" Wow, in my head I was thinking, WTF!?  This is one of the worst customer service I have ever experienced!  Let's say that the owners did indeed not care for my business.  I believe there are kinder ways to portray that to me other than utter disrespect!  The owners could've still returned my phone call with a reply.  I have been a patron for so many years!  \nI certainly hope the young man's response was not a direct reflection of   Stella and Kong's intentions.  If it was, then I'm truly disappointed.

I had high hopes for this place seeing that the line was out the door! At first glance, it seems like a successful mom and pop shop with a variety classic breakfast options like sausage, toast, omelettes, eggs benedict, etc. But they also have creative specialty breakfast options that try to fuse elements from different cuisines into classic breakfast options such as dulce de leche pancakes and the New York scramble.\n\nFood: 3/5\nComplimentary scone - The scone was tiny, about two inches in diameter, but a nice touch to start off the meal. It was moist and came with the best homemade strawberry and mango jam. I even made sure to smear all of the remaining jam onto the toast that came with my meal.\n\nNew York Scramble - I ordered the New York scramble thinking I loved all the elements of a New York bagel so combined with an egg scramble including avocado and sour cream, I was really expecting to be blown away. However, the the eggs were bland and the plate was arranged in such as way that the elements of the dish did not feel cohesive. I felt like I was have smoked salmon with a side of eggs and avocado. The potato carrot pancakes that came with the dish were good enough but didn't work well with the rest of the meal either.\n\nService: 4/5\nThe wait was pretty long, about 30 mins, which I suppose is typical for Sunday brunch prime time. The line was efficient and we were given menus in the meantime while we waited. Once we were seated, our orders were taken quickly and our food came just as quickly.\n\nAmbience: 3/5\nThe restaurant has a very down to earth feel. The decor isn't fancy and the kitchen is open to the rest of the small dining space making it feel a little busy and cramped. Because of the limited seating space, two of us were seated at a table of four with the condiments serving as a barrier from the adjacent party of two. It felt a little awkward to be within hearing range of another couples conversation while pretending to not hear them, but we made it work.\n\nValue: 2/5\nI paid $15 for a subpar scramble and toast which to me felt very steep. The portions felt pretty small for the price too. Maybe the classic breakfast items are worth the splurge, but if I wanted just eggs and toast for breakfast, I would've stayed home instead of dropping $12.", "author": "Kristine T."}

That's what I've been on these past few weeks: on that Brunchfest Hype.\n\nThey boast a four-star but, I'm giving it a solid tres estrellas right here.\n\nThey're sorta hole in the wall - not hating on that at all, cuz I love their small town feel especially since it's located off of busy Lombard in the Marina. They gladly seat you, hand you a menu and give you the time you need to peruse it. I was already set on my brunchfest to consist of a Bloody Mary since NO brunch is complete without it *ahem* This Bloody was a little short of, well... blood (tomato juice, flavor - just that spicy pizazz I guess I've gotten used to). It's pretty low key I'd say maybe for the \"beginner\" Bloody Mary drinker(?). Perhaps because it is made with soju and not vodka? Really unsure. Albeit it was lacking in flavor and color, it definitely did not lack in celery! They basically stripped off a stalk and stuck it in my glass - like the whole 2 inch x 14 inch stalk. It was a little hard to get the whole drink in my tiny iPhone picture frame.\n\nHad their Home Plate breakfast. Before breakfast is served, however, they do serve you petite scones with butter and their housemade jams - we had apple and mango. This right here was a nice touch and possibly their saving grace. \n\nIt's cute how their entire right side wall also serves as a blackboard menu with pictures too to help you envision your meal for all you right-brained individuals. That creative touch helps the restaurant appear a little more modern especially after just walking in.\n\nAt any rate, the food is good. Bloody Mary, not so much.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-20", "description": "This is a review for the new establishment, and it's more of a review for the restaurant and the service and not so much the food and here's why. We happened to show up on their very first day of the opening of their new place. We honestly are from out of town and thought this was the only place. Come to find out we have come for breakfast on day one opening. There was a line once we walked in, but it moved pretty quickly. Honestly for the first day opening, they were pretty calm and collected as a whole staff, I was surprised to hear upon entering that today was their first day. People were sat fairly quickly, we waited maybe ten minutes. The lady in front of us was a regular of their old place (she told us) and kept stopping employees as they walked past obviously busy, trying to offer her tips and saying there's open tables. They were very sweet despite the fact they were clearly busy. Let me start by saying this place is beautiful inside. They have decorated it in a farmhouse chic style that's so in right now and it just looks like it's straight out of a catalogue. We were sat at a table that were actually two tops placed side by side, which was a bummer because there were these cute little booths, and then round tables all over with comfy wingback chairs- but they were for larger parties. These ones were pretty close together which made it hard to hear each other or ignore the people a half an arms length apart from us. I ordered the corned beef Benedict and a coffee and my husband ordered the home plate special. You could tell that food was coming out at odd times and some people seemed bothered, but most people were happy and having a good time. I mean we were there in day one, it's expected. My husband got his food after a long wait, it had homemade chicken sausage patties, eggs and a waffle. He didn't enjoy his waffle, I liked the sausage because it seemed fresh and healthier. He ate his entire food and unfortunately mine hadn't come out yet. It had been a good 10 minutes. We flagged the lady down and she went and checked on the order. She came back and said they would be sending it right out. At this point, we needed to get going we had been there over an hour and a half. She was very apologetic and this is the reason for the four star review. She apologized over and over and another gentleman even came over and apologized and said that they had taken care of the entire bill. I have worked in many restaurants, one that I partook in the opening of, and I understand how stressful it is and how it takes a little bit to work the kinks out. This place will be just fine. They obviously care about their customers and their food, I wish this place the best. It's a beautiful place with yummy sounding food. Just wish I had gotten to taste it after they've figured out how to accommodate a much larger establishment. I hope to be able to try your place again!", "author": "Ryann H."}

The omelette came as a combo with toast (your choice) and potato -carrot pancakes served with sour cream and apple sauce. The omelette was simple but I could tell that all of the ingredients were fresh; the shrimp really made it memorable.

I'd say if waited ten minutes before getting seated inside. The inside is very sleek and modern which makes this place so cute. I've been eyeing the almond French toast since I've seen it on Yelp so that was what I wanted. My friend got the corned beef Benedict and we agreed to share each other's food since it looked like big portions. People walked in and out, as this place filled up with hungry people quickly. We first got free scones on the house with mango/strawberry jam, yum(yay for free food)! \nA few minutes later, both of our plates arrived looking better than ever. The almond French toast came with six half slices but better yet, they were big slices. The Benedict dish came with the two usual eggs with hollandaise sauce on top with a hash brown on the side! We dug in quickly after all the picture taking and oh my, Home Plate is the way to go! Definitely didn't let my first time brunching go to waste, service was amazing as well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-28", "description": "**Truth be told, I've actually had this review finished for a while now.  Like, a long while.  The only thing that held me back from posting was how many stars to give.  And the fear that friends/fellow Yelpers Sara P. and Vicky L. (as well as everyone else that loves Home Plate) would give me a ton of grief for saying that, outside of the scones, I wasn't as amazed as I had hoped.\n\nWith a very casual, mom-and-pop feel to the restaurant, Home Plate isn't nearly as trendy or fashionable as other places in the Marina.  However, for me, that just adds to the appeal.  Bottomless mimosas at Circa may (or may not) be the thing to do (and boy I hope it's not), but I'd much rather come to a place like this for brunch with friends.\n\nOffering a slate of more traditional breakfast dishes (benedicts, waffles, pancakes, omelettes, hashes, etc.), it'd be fair to say Home Plate offers more homely breakfast plates.  Since we were planning on spending the rest of the day wine tasting in Napa, I wanted something heftier and ordered the CHUNKY CORNED BEEF HASH ($9.50).\n\nAlthough there were some good things about the dish, I thought it was just okay.  On the plus side, the portion was pretty generous, the eggs were poached nicely, and the horseradish cream had just the right kick.  Yet, even despite all that corned beef, the dish felt light on flavor.  It was certainly meaty, but it felt like the dish (especially the potatoes) needed more seasoning (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/home-plate-san-francisco#P6lVtarWiXYudw7G1hThxw).\n\nStill, even though my dish was a little underwhelming, I would still come back to Home Plate again.  Partially to try my luck with another dish, but also to get another one of their awesome scones.  I don't mean to oversell them, but I will - they're one of the best I've had!  A little buttery, yet relatively light, and just straight up delicious.  You can keep the bottomless mimosa, I'd much rather have a couple of these instead (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/home-plate-san-francisco#ywYRbwy4OkB03hzRWbXQUg).", "author": "Mike L."}

If you live in the Marina, look no further than Home Plate. A small, neighborhood restaurant with regular brunch fare and affordable prices in a notable highbrow area, this is a gem. \n\nWith freshly made juices and complimentary baked-to-order scones, how can you really go wrong? The food is nothing especially spectacular, but Home Plate is a good, dependable local business. I highly recommend the pastrami sandwich or waffles. The crab melt is good (made with real crab), but needed more salt and pepper. The carrot & celery juice and the cantaloupe juice are amazing - comparable to those $10 cold-pressed juices, but at a more affordable price. \n\nMost brunch-goers are families or couples, which is a great sign that this is a down-to-earth spot. Already eaten at Home Plate twice, and a meal for two (with drinks, tax, and tip) are often between $30-40. The restaurant seats about 20-30. Street parking is available.", "author": "Joanna S."}

The slight sweet notes from the carrots worked in perfect harmony with the earthy potato and tart sour cream. They could have been a bit crispier though. \n\nAngry Benedict: absolutely perfectly poached eggs.  Hash brown were thin and crispy, just the way I like them. The combination of the shrimp, hollandaise, jalape\u00f1o and spinach was delicious, although it could have stood to be \"angrier\", haha. \n\nChunky corned beef: a little chunkier than expected, but that's probably because I was expecting your standard hash, just with a chunkier consistency.  These are literal cubes of corned beef hash, which were tasty, just unexpected. \n\nService was great, polite,  cheerful and attentive.

I'm not partial to scones because I find them to be dry, but this scone was very soft and pliant...for a scone.

Nevertheless, the housemade mango and berry jams that accompanied the scone were great.\n\nMy roommate and I split two dishes. The first was the EGGS FLORENTINE with two poached eggs, spinach, and Hollandaise sauce on an English Muffin, served with a side of 2 potato-carrot pancakes or hash browns, $8.75 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/home-plate-san-francisco?select=FPyyA7eOppxMnZOoYhU-hg#TEm9p122fkesEyo34OE2RA). The poached eggs and Hollandaise sauce were good, but the English muffin was too tough, the spinach too bland. The spinach could have used a dose of garlic.\n\nThe second was the HOME PLATE FRITTATA, a 3-egg pancake-style omelette with homemade chicken sausage, bacon, mushroom, spinach, green onions, pine nuts, and cheddar cheese, served with 2 potato-carrot pancakes or hash browns, $8.95 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/home-plate-san-francisco?select=FPyyA7eOppxMnZOoYhU-hg#FPyyA7eOppxMnZOoYhU-hg).

I choose the potato pancakes which were disappointingly small and thin but freaking good, they were served with apple sauce and sour cream.  $9.50\n\nPancakes with walnuts, bananas and strawberries: big thick fluffy buttermilk goodness.  \nThe strawberries weren't ripe though.  $7.45\n\nStrong coffee $2\n\nThis place is not much to look at but your stomach and pocket book will think your in Disneyland, highly recommended.", "author": "Douglas Y."}

Especially beacuase they came with some house made jam, which was strawberry and mango when I went.  It's so fluffy and buttery...I absolutely enjoyed it!  Highlight of the meal!\n\nService would be rated 10 stars if I could!  Our server would often check on us and was super nice!  I appreciated him a lot!\n\nAlthough I give this place a 3-star rating, I'd come back.  I love breakfast and still yet to try other items on their menu.

As we came to the restaurant, we didn't wait too long for a table of 4. When you sit down, they bring waters and their homemade scones with raisins with sides of butter, strawberry jam, and mango jam. Delicious. I ordered full stack (3) of banana walnut pancakes topped with strawberries, the dish was larger than I expected, but nonetheless, was amazing. My mates ordered different types of omelets with hash browns, which they explained as being phenomenal. The presentation of each plate was beautiful, they set them up with garnishes of avocado or vegetables. As for food, I would say it was really top of the line.\n\nThe service was just as great. When we sat down, a waitress came over and got our drink and food orders. We had three waiters/waitresses coming over to our table consistently to make sure we don't need anything else and that our water and coffees were filled.

Portion sizes are large, service is extremely friendly and you can choose to linger or be in and out quickly. They tend to get a line on weekend mornings but move things along quickly. \n\nWhen you sit down, you automatically receive a scone with butter and two jams served to you. The scone is a good mix of flaky and buttery without being too sweet. It is nicely studded with raisins. The jams are the perfect complement to the scone. I usually got an iced tea, and unlike many other places, they are very good about refills. I don't like extra frills or additions in terms of flavor added to my tea, and there's is straight-up blacked iced tea served with a lemon. \n\nI got their veggie omelet pretty much every time we went. I asked for cheese on the side, as they don't skimp on anything there, and it was filling enough without being too cheesy. The omelet comes loaded with a mix of veggies. My one complaint is it can be a bit oily as well. My husband always got the Greek frittata with the carrot latke-type pancakes.

No scones were offered.\n 2. READ: Generous portions, amazing omelettes and poached eggs, delicious pancakes.\n     EXPERIENCED: Portions were average. The all meat omelette had meat chunks that looked and tasted horrible. The All-veggie omelette had ZERO flavor. The 2 poached eggs were cooked in boiling water, served in a cup, and looked/tasted rather unappetizing. And finally the pancakes were raw inside, cooked a second time, yet tasted like hell.\n\nPlease guys, if you are giving a YELP review, be HONEST, not NICE or POLITE. Other people rely on your reviews, so make it honest and real. Our review is based not on any animosity or anything personal. The managers treated us well, so no problems there.

Yummy yummy yummy. \n\nHowever, when my girlfriend sat next to me on the same side, the busser, a workout machine with deep bags under his eyes and a strange look came over and said, \"you cannot sit next to each other like this - this is a community table - someone else might sit here.\" Two couples, unknowing each other, sitting next to each other, when there were at least 5 other tables open... The  restaurant at this time, about 11 AM, was not all that busy. In fact, there was a table next to us, a \"community table\", that remained vacant the entire time we were there. And at another community table down the way, two girls were sitting next to each other. I said, \"I understand, but the restaurant is not busy. It seems like it should be OK.\" But he was insistent and waited there looking strung out saying no you need to move. \n\nBuzz. Kill. I felt singled out and the gentleman and his wife sitting next to me looked at me after he said this and told me \"that's messed up.\"\n\nAfter that, the busser who had nothing else to do, kept giving us a very blank stare from the back of the kitchen. I felt very uncomfortable and wanted to leave on principle. But we were both too hungry to leave. The rest of the staff was very nice and awkwardly moved all her silverware back and repositioned the things on the table. I understand community seating and restaurants can have rules but this kind of interruption, especially so sourly put, gave me a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nTo the restaurant, if you're reading this, just know that if the restaurant were to get busy, I'm pretty sure we would have no hesitation moving to accommodate more people.

Sister ordered the Corn Beef Benedict and eggs made perfectly with real cornbread. The thin sliced potato carrot pancakes again Cute deliciousness! The maple bacon with red chili pepper need I even say more!!! The expediter was in our sight line and she put so much love and paid such attention to detail in every plate that went out to the customers - tasted it in our food too! It's experiences like this that validate why we love living in this city so much!", "author": "June R."}

I always remember the free scone.\n\nWe waited about 15- 20 mins, then got a table. I ordered the eggs benedict (you have a choice of turkey or ham, I chose ham - duh.)  I also ordered a $5.00 side of thick cut bacon with spice and maple syrup (not nearly as good as Millionaire's bacon from Blackwood & Sweep Maple, but pretty darn good - Hey it's B-A-C-O-N after all)\n\nMy BF ordered the pesto omelet with potato pancakes (not nearly enough pesto in the omelet BTY). \n\nThe eggs on my bene were cooked to perfection, super loose yolk, and not a hint of snotty egg white. The ham on first appearance looked crappy - But was surprisingly delicious.\n\nThis place is solid on Brunch.

We found Home Plate with the ratings and menu choices.  We were the third party seated as soon as they opened at 7.  ALL three parties entered at the same time.  Well, parties 1 and 2 were handed menus, drink orders taken and served and the special scone served to them before our waiter rather threw the menus at our table.  We should have left at that point, but we both were hungry-lesson learned.  Fortunately we had reviewed the menu online before so we both knew what we wanted.  We ordered, one item was not available, okay that happens.  Ordered - beverages were delivered, no scones, food came out relatively quickly, still no scones.  So husband ordered a custom scramble - first observation - brown on the eggs.  Carrot and potato pancakes were okay - not crisp, rather mushy.  The shrimp in the scramble were cooked appropriately and had good flavor.  Still no scones.  The French toast description was far superior than the actual fruition.  Eh, it filled a belly.  The Home Plate special bacon was a waste.  Over cooked and actually charred on one side with maple syrup pour over it and chili flakes sprinkled on.  Again, still no scones.

It was a little out of our way since we usually have brunch closer by the Sunset. Riding the 28 through GG Bridge during primetime tourist season was chaotic, but needless to say, it was worth it. \n\nThe place is cozy so I'm not surprised about the wait. They give you complimentary scones with homemade jam (mango and strawberry) which were still warm. I ordered the roasted chicken omelette. You get to choose between hash browns or potato-carrot pancakes (with sour cream and apple sauce), and I got the latter because I've never tried them. They turned out smaller than I expected which only made me want more. We also split an order of almond french toast, which is a must try! It was moist and fluffy and must've been sent from heaven. \n\nThe portions were huge and I wanted to finish my food but I couldn't -- first world problems much?

But my wife and I were heading toward Marin and looking for breakfast, so...\nIf I was living in the Marina, I would eat here at least three times a week. The menu is extensive and the food looks (and is) delicious. I had the polenta with eggs and chicken sausage. Holy Cow! The polenta was so wonderful; melts in your mouth, full of flavor, wonderful. It is studded with pine nuts and bits of mushroom that give it a nice earthy flavor and you get two large squares that are more than plenty. The chicken sausage was quite tasty; very mildly seasoned and somewhat coarsely ground, so there is no mistaking it as chicken. I always give props to a breakfast joint that serves real, fresh squeezed OJ and that is definitely what you are getting here, Yay! My wife ordered the banana-nut pancakes with strawberries and blueberries (not topping or compote, FRESH berries) and they were fantastic; thick and fluffy and full of bananas.

When I finally got my dish and started to eat it...I slowly began to dislike it. The fried polenta was too much polenta...barely an flavor...it was a bit hard to eat. The side of sausage to go with it was very delicious at least, so I relished that of course. But yeah, the fried polenta was not good. It seemed more like a side dish than a main dish.

This place has been around for over 25 years and continues to operate it's business with high standards.  For a restaurant that's been around for over 25 years you can hardly tell that it's even a year old.  The place is nice and clean, kind of small...but makes you feel a home.  The kitchen is somewhat in plane view, the serving counters are as if you had a serving counter at home leading to the dining room.  \n\nWhat makes this place different from many other restaurants are their homemade Scones and Jam.  For some reason Scones are not my top on my list, but today the Scone I had may have changed all that.\n\nSo....as I was looking for a good place for some Breakfast...I had encountered Home Plate.  Researched it a little bit on Yelp....averages 4 stars....Hey....love my Yelpers!!  Thanks You!!\n\nI walked in and was greeted and seated.  I think I went at the right time as there was no line to wait in.\nI started out with a large freshly squeezed orange juice while looking over the menu.\n\nI decided on the Home Run special.\nThis came with:\n2 Eggs cooked anyway you wanted it.  (sunny side up for me).\nChoice of Buttermilk Pancakes, Waffle or French Toast.  (I was craving French Toast).\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kesgk8dCRyg3qRDYpuAKGg?select=8uRVpAoXk29bIdkKCF-2bA\n\nYou also had a choice of Bacon, Ham, Turkey, Pork Sausage Links, Homemade Chicken Sausage Patties or Andouille Sausage.  I chose the Andouille Sausage (Spicy Sausage).\nIn addition I had asked for a side of Hash Browns.\n\nThis would complete my order.\n\nShortly they had brought me a homemade Scone and some of their homemade Jams.  Ummm.....Yummm!!  No, I normally do not eat Scones, but maybe I should start.  This was truly fabulous!!\nNot too heavy...actually it is pretty lite and the homemade jam was a perfect compliment for the scone.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kesgk8dCRyg3qRDYpuAKGg?select=y712NhUtD959zlGOa_5icQ\n\nPerfect timing....just finished my scone and my eggs arrive.  Two eggs sunny side up, Andouille sausage and hash browns on one plate and French Toast topped off with some powder sugar on another  plate.  Ahh....where do I begin....I love my eggs to run so I started with the eggs and sure enough I got the yoke spewing out onto my hash browns!!  Perfect placement!!  Eggs were nice and fresh, sausage was tasty not too spicy and my hash browns with a little salt added made this an awesome dish.  Everything was cooked to perfection!!  I think I cleaned that plate off and asked for another glass of Orange Juice.  Next the French Toast....taste as expected....this has not failed me yet.  OMG!!

The homemade jams were very good though so I was keeping hope alive...\n\nWhen breakfast came out everything looked and tasted like it came from the IHOP across the street - a mediocre chain restaurant.

Be sure to try the carrot pancakes (which are actually more of a fritter) instead of the hash browns, they are delicious. Hash browns are really good too! They have a bloody mary that uses a Korean sake type alcohol rather than vodka, packs a nice punch and tastes a good too!. The scrambles are a perfect amount of food, with great flavor. The chorizo and eggs are served on a home made corn tortilla with just the right amount of spice. It is a small space but the wait is not very long.

Why?  http://hellodadandmom.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/iphony/\n\nWhat's great about this place:\n\n+ Small, homey, comfortable little (almost divey) breakfast and lunch nook.\n+ NOT Mel's or IHOP.\n+ Delicious homemade chicken apple sausage (in Boyfriend's Meat Lover's Omelette, which was humongous).\n+ Very, very reasonable prices (most items were under $10, portion sizes were pretty big).\n+ Even more delicious potato-carrot pancakes, which were thin and served with a dollop of sour cream and applesauce.\n+ The most delicious part was the raisin scone that they give you before your meal.  I think they change it up every once in awhile (I read from another Yelper that they had cranberry-orange).  They also give you fruit jam with it, and this time it was strawberry and mango.\n+ Service.  Despite my inability to clearly voice my breakfast item choices through my bouts of laughter, the waitress was very patient and kind.\n\nWhat's mediocre:\n\n+ Smoked salmon bagel.  It's just a plain bagel with way too much cream cheese slathered on.  I could've gotten this elsewhere for like $5-6, and it wouldn't have tasted so oddly-mushy-like.\n\nI'm so excited this place is about two blocks away from my flat.

I think that since it is located near quite a few hotels, most of these reviews have been written by happy tourists. When I visited, I certainly did not see anyone who looked like locals eating there. \n\nThe menu is extensive, but the food is bland and unimpressive. My partner and I shared hash browns, carrot cakes, bacon, scrambled eggs and banana walnut pancakes. Everything was quite boring and nothing special. The scones however were delicious, but hardly any reason to wait in line to eat. \n\nThe service was extremely poor. You are served by all of the staff as opposed to just one waitress/waiter. This may seem like a very good idea which would boost the amount of service each table receives. However, my experience speaks otherwise. At first the staff were too attentive, barely allowing any time to review the menu. Then, once our meals were served, it was very difficult to grab their attention. Furthermore, they neglected to remove used dishes from our table and instead placed new dishes on top of the others and brought new cups rather than refilling (or removing) the others. Lastly, they didn't bring their famous scones till the end of the meal. \n\nThe worst part of my experience was their lack of accommodation. I attempted to make a few changes to some of their meals to accommodate my dietary restrictions without any success.  Not only were they inflexible but their was no expression of sympathy or apologies and the service that followed was hostile. \n\nTerrible place, I will never go again. \n\nTLDR\n\nFood = common, bland, nothing special (scones are good)\nCustomer Service = hectic, disorganized, inconsistent, not willing to make accommodations on meals\nOverall = very poor, won't go there again", "author": "Katherine M."}

If you're the type of breakfast person that wants quantity over quality for your money, go across the street because there is an International House of Pancakes (IHOP) located DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET.  That should give you an idea of how much better Home Plate is when they have a fucking IHOP right across the street and still manage to consistently have patrons willing to wait, at times, over an hour, to eat at their small family joint instead.\n\nEggs Benedict.

The umpire is being conferred on this one. Let's look at the instant replay, shall we?\n\nI was on my way up to Corte Madera for a writing workshop last week (no wisecracks, please) when I realized I had about an hour before I had to be there. I was debating between coming here for a quick breakfast or hoping against hope that I could make it to Sam's in Tiburon for one of their famous hangtown fries while I sunned myself on the deck. But the sun had yet to make an appearance, and I was feeling like I was already having bad traffic karma on Lombard. Home Plate, it is.\n\nThe compact place looks the same all these years later. The cook with the little white cap looks the same. It was crowded with chair-banging customers, including a horsey Asian girl who seemed to think her hoodie was flattering to her overstuffed figure. It's not, honey. Lay off the free scones. Well, much to my temporary delight, I noticed on the menu that they indeed serve a Hangtown Fry for $7.50 complete with oysters, bacon bits, mushroom slices and green onions. OK, that was what I ordered.\n\nBut first came their famous homemade scone with a little cup of a fruit compote (see my photo). I never did ask what flavor it was, but my guess was guava since it was purplish. It didn't matter because it was tasty as was the tiny scone flecked with raisins. Things looked up until I got the hangtown fry (see my photo). Pretty underwhelming with nothing terribly fresh-tasting in it. The eggs had a bit of a soupy texture even though it was edible enough. My favorite parts of the dish were on the sides - the crescent roll and the too-small potato-carrot pancakes.\n\nOK, it was probably a mistake to order the hangtown fry just because I had a Sam's-inspired hankering. Sticking with the basics was probably my best bet. But you certainly get service with a smile and spark-plug energy from the waitress. Oh, the umpire is making his final call. Yelper interference, he shouts. Coach, I've been benched!\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...passable breakfast fare...I wouldn't try the riskier dishes\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's the same small place it's been for years\nSERVICE - 4 stars...a great waitress...service with a smile\nTOTAL - 3 stars...not a destination place, but I could've done worse ...YOU'RE SAFE!", "author": "Ed U."}

We shared a couple of things- the chorizo scrambled eggs which were great, but the best thing was the crab avocado sandwich which I believe was a special.

My toddler's eggs never came out, but we were still charged for them. Most decent places would bring a toddler's simple order out first, but clearly there was no consideration here. I ordered medium OJ, received a small, but was still charged for the medium plus the eggs that we never received.

However, this breakfast establishment is far from Chinese, and American as they come. I don't think there is a private lot, so you'll have to find metered parking nearby. The meters also take credit cards.\n\nThe restaurant is a bit small, and when we stopped by (Sat. morning), it was quite busy. However, we were fortunate enough to be seated right away, since there is a waiting list system and those on the list have to wait outside amongst the chilling morning air. \n\nEverything about our experience went smoothly. From the excellent service to the delicious food. The complimentary appetizer scones were amazing. We considered buying some for the road. We ordered traditional omelet and pancake breakfast dishes with the usual side dishes of potatoes, sausage, bacon, etc. The food tasted fresh, hot, and satisfying. \n\nThe prices were similar to most mid-scale breakfast restaurants, around $10 per person.", "author": "Andy P."}

She needed some help with an errand and I was available so sure why not. So we decided to grab some breakfast.\n\nShe had suggested Home Plate. I ordered a Blackstone Benedict? I believe that is what it was called. Its basically like eggs benedict. But its a poached egg over bacon and tomato with hollaindase sauce. Dee ordered the polenta with eggs and sausage.\n\nWhats neat is that have serve you scones before your dishes. The scones were nice and tasty. And very shortly thereafter our dishes arrived. I cut into my Blackstone and watched the yolk pour out from that poached egg. It was beautiful...i love watching half cooked eggs open up with that runny yolk..It was pretty good. Next to my benedict was 2 potato carrot pancakes. These things were really really salty. Next time I will opt for regular pancakes instead.\n\nI got to try some of Dee's polenta, and it had nice pieces of mushroom in there. The polenta is cooked over a pan so taht it has a nice light crunch when you bite into it.\n\nService is good, food is pretty good. I'll definitely come back sometime again..but taht depends when I decide to wake up that early for breakfast again. Other than the salty pancakes I had, the service really brought them that extra star. I'm thinking 3 star in my head but since they were so nice, and came around twice to fill up my coffee that definitely deserves an extra star.\n\nThank you Dee for the good breakfast, and thank you Home Plate for the tasty eggy goodness.", "author": "phillip w."}

Don't you love it when your server brings the menu and asks if anyone wants coffee / tea etc.?\n\nEveryone already knows that and it is great to have some coffee to drink while you are looking at the menu. By the way, I ordered decaf (I know! I have ruined my elite standing as a reviewer with extraordinary taste buds - and taste; but then I have been given the ultimatum; quit the caffeine or start a regimen of tranquilizers by YOU KNOW WHO) and when the coffee arrived I thought for sure I was going to have to remind the server my of my order. Three cups of coffee and she (seemingly) selected cups randomly and put them on the table. Before I could smile and ask, she smiled at me and said; \"decaf!\" I love it.\n\nGreat selection of breakfast possiblities, and I'll mention just a few.

To my surprise, this place is owned and run by Asians (nice find!).\n\nI came here today with a bunch of my friends today for brunch on a wet late morning. I was taken back a bit by the small size of the restaurant, but I love the coziness it emits. I ordered the crab omelette with the potato-carrot cakes and wheat toast. The portion size (not only for my dish, but for all of our plates) was huge. The food tasted great and it was well worth the cost. The one compliment I have is that I was pleasantly surprised at the abundance of crabmeat in my omelette; I guess that's what filled me up so quickly.\n\nAnother plus? Each entree comes with a free scone with jams. Delish!!", "author": "Bonita K."}

The wait was a bit longer because there was six of us, and they can seat twenty people, maybe. \n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered smoothies and juice drinks around.  Warning: the smalls are REALLY small, like shot-like small.  The medium is good sized, water sized.  And the smoothies were put in the large cups.  The juices are really fresh squeezed and a nice opening to a brunch.\n\nAfter ordering, they brought out fresh raisin scones that practically melt in your mouth with a side of homemade mango and guava jam.  If anything, go for the scones, they are to die for.  I would order a box of those if i could.\n\nIn any case, I got the home platter with a thin crisp waffle, two sausage links, and scrambled eggs.  The syrup was liquidy like maple syrup, but I'm not sure if it was.  The waffle was very good, soft and crisp.  The sausage and eggs were sausage and eggs - wouldn't say they were super special.\n\nOverall, everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and it was a good experience.

In fact, I can only recall one other place in the city where I had a breakfast that was worse than what I had at Home Plate (see Americana Grill on Balboa--ICK). \n\nFor starters, we signed in on the clipboard and the guy said it would probably be about 10 minutes. So my boyfriend popped in to the antique store next door while we waited. About 5 minutes later the guy said the table was ready but because we both weren't there he had to give it to the people next on the list. I told him that my boyfriend was just next door, but it didn't matter. I have no tolerance for dumb, and when establishments put in place illogical and backward policies, I say you can keep your damn food. \n\nWhen we finally were seated, I noticed that the floor was filthy, and when one of the servers dropped a ketchup bottle on the floor and then simply put it back on the table, we knew not to touch the ketchup bottle. \n\nAt this point, we got our scones, which are included with everything. The scones were very good--not too heavy or buttery. And then we waited. And waited some more. And waited a while more. My boyfriend finally got his food, and then our neighbor table got their food, and then a few more minutes went by and I finally got my food. My garden omelet, which I asked for well done and came out runny, was completely flavorless, save for the slight flavor of the oil in which it was cooked and the sour cream that came with the flat and equally flavorless potato carrot pancakes. My boyfriend's pumpkin pancakes were so burned they were almost black, so he asked for another. The second time they came out they were still raw in the middle! \n\nThe servers were very nice and they did take the pancakes off the check, which was a nice gesture. But by the time we finally got our check, we were so over this experience. \n\nIf you just want to grab a couple scones, this might be a good place for a swing-by. But otherwise, the IHOP across the street probably has better food (and this is spoken by someone who, as a rule, does not eat at chain restaurants).", "author": "Amy B."}

I found nothing special about the food or service so unless you are starving or there is no waiting list, I would not bother. This neighborhood breakfast place is so small that customers sign up outside and wait.  \n\nI did not expect a gourmet restaurant judging by the storefront appearance, but that is no excuse to serve a professionally poached egg that is visibly runny. No amount of free scones compensates for a horrible first impression. The coffee tended toward the chicory and the tables were as close together as possible in the cramped dining area. The staff was always around, but we still had trouble getting our entire order completed. The food was fresh, but not properly cooked or attractively plated, the scones were the sweet/crumbly type and the place looked like someone's kitchen. Sorry, but I wouldn't take anyone I was trying to impress.  It's strictly a neighborhood convenience.", "author": "Lynn S."}

There was no runnyness and yet it was little and fluffy. Interestingly I had the roasted chicken omelet but without the chicken because I'm vegetarian, Avocado, mushrooms and green onions and cheese is to me the perfect omelet. Top it off with a little salsa and some potato and carrot latkas on the side makes for one amazing meal. To my surprise, you get a fresh scone with butter and homemade jam to start.  \nOther notables are the coffee is decent, didn't seem like there gets to be to much of a line, and the staff is friendly and attentive.\nI'm just disappointed it took me 5 years to discover this gem.

A large menu with seemingly infinite variations on the traditional favorites like waffles, pancakes and french toast, plus the Mexican faves, heuvos rancheros, chorizon and eggs, etc. Omelettes and Eggs every way, of course. All done with a health-conscious approach, like not pre-buttering your toast and offering both freshly made cantelope and honeydew juice as well as the usual juices. \n\nLarge portions, I couldn't finish the mound of chorizo & eggs I was served. Fresh-baked scones with every meal adds a nice touch. Servers were super nice and accomodating (and fast). Everyone working hard to get the food to your table ASAP.\n\nMinor complaints: only unsalted butter and a little more care in preparing the fruit salad would make it perfect. \n\nThe real issue is the wait, because this is a small place that virtually everyone can enjoy.

I don't like reading reviews where the reviewer dumps on a place because of one bad experience, and I try not to write reviews like that unless I think there is an indication of ongoing problem--and that's the case here.\n\nOur food shows up and looks fine, but my friend's pancakes were undercooked.  I mean really undercooked--raw and gooey on the inside.  No big deal, really--we were not upset, just asked for it to be fixed.  She did not even ask for new pancakes, just asked for the pancakes to be thrown back on the fire.  These things happen.  The waitress says sure and off she goes.  No problem.\n\nBut then she comes back and says...wait for it...the cook wants to see the pancakes.  Kind of implying we are making this up.  Strike 1, Home Plate.\n\nOff go the pancakes, the rest of us are eating, the waitress comes back and says a whole new batch of pancakes are being cooked.  OK, fine.  \n\nTime goes by.  We are almost done with our food, except for J, still waiting.  The waitress is walking over with the pancakes and then...turns around and goes back to the kitchen.  I can hear her say, hey you forgot the blueberries and butter.  Good catch...but then she walks away and starts serving other tables, and more than 5 more minutes go by.  Strike 2.\n\nFinally, we are all done with our food and J says, look, no need to wait for me.  I'll get the food boxed up.  So the pancakes, which STILL HAVE NOT ARRIVED, we ask them to put them in the box to go.  \n\nAnd on the way home, she goes to eat the pancakes...which are still underdone.  The same as the first batch.  Strike 3!\n\nLook, as I said, I don't want to hammer a place for one bad experience.  But this was real bad, not just in the mistake but the way the problem was handled.  There was nothing really wrong with my food but my whole meal was ruined by the experience.  And as I think about it, this place is not quite as good it used to be.  Really, one single piece of toast with a full $8.50 breakfast?  And the potato pancakes seem smaller and not as tasty.  The warm mini-scones are still good, but I noticed the table next to us got their's late.\n\nI think this place has fallen off from where it was.

I generally judge brunch places by their bacon and am pretty easy to please as bacon goes but here - the bacon was a no go.  i also tried my friend's \"special omelette\"...it was indeed quite special and definitely not for me. \n\nThe decor was cool - I liked how they used chinese paper placemats and there's a somewhat novel feel to the \"chinese run breakfast joint\", but you could get that (and better food) at the hamburger haven in the richmond.", "author": "Shinny L."}

Wanna know a little story behind the Hangtown Fry dish?  Back in the Gold Rush, thieves and what-not who were sentenced to hanging had a last meal request.

The breakfast crowd was just starting to leave. It probably helped that we visited SF after Labor Day & the tourist season was winding down. The food was very good, the service was good, and I would have given 4 stars if we left it at that. I marked them down because after I received my credit card statement a few weeks later, I noticed that they charged an additional amount (probably tip - it was about 15% more than the bill) without my concent. This was annoying siince we left a cash tip of more than 18%. Now, I don't like ANY place that automatically assumes that we forgot to tip and therefore feel that they have the right to add it on AFTER I have signed the charge slip. What if I were trying to send a message for bad service & purposely didn't tip? Now maybe someone took the cash from the table before the waiter could clear the table, but there's no excuse for adding on to a bill AFTER I have writtten in the final amount. Maybe it's an SF thing to do so.", "author": "Ronald N."}

I got the chicken sausage, potato pancakes, and the blintzes.  The scone they give you is scrumptious.  The blintzes were just ok... I'm used to blintzes being a bit sweeter with sugar or cinnamon added, the only thing that made them sweet was the strawberry jam that came on the side.  Next time I go here I'll probably skip the blintzes and just go for the sausage and potato pancakes.  \n\nI would recommend getting the carrot potato pancakes as a side, that way you get 4 instead of 2!\n\nThey also have really nice juices here, I got cantaloupe this time but will probably try honeydew when I go back~ (and then probably go back to the cantaloupe again since it was so good!)\n\nMy friend got their speciality scramble (with chicken sausage) and it smelled really good.

Right away we ordered the fresh orange juice. It was delicious and tasted like an orange, and not like the stuff you get in the carton. Was already happy with the juice then the waiter brought out scones with house-made jelly. I'm not much of a baked goods lover, but these were great! Flaky on the outside and soft on the inside. Whoever made these knew how to bake. They were served with the jam, which was also awesome. I saved some to spread on my toast. I ordered the two eggs, hash browns, toast, and chicken sausage. The eggs and hash browns were typical, nothing to complain about and nothing to rave about. The chicken sausage was unique and perfectly spiced. It wasn't too dry like I thought it was going to be. I wanted something light because I was going on a hike to Muir Woods and didn't want a huge meal. My friend went with the brunch menu and ordered the crab sandwich. You can tell they used real crab. I'm from the Midwest and most restaurants here are stingy with their shellfish. So being new to the city, we were surprised that a small place like this would serve crab at a reasonable price. The benefits of living on the coast, I guess. My girlfriend got the banana pancakes. They were light and fluffy and absolutely perfect. Service was great. Our waitress was super nice and definitely earned her tips. I usually drink 3-4 glasses of water when I go out to eat and my cup was always full. She did a good job of serving without being intrusive. Overall this is a cozy place that serves up typical breakfast food.

Although Home Plate does not compare to the quality and savoriness of the food at Mama's, it still manages to hold ground.\n\nThe wait is never long and the turn-over is pretty quick.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired for, but then again, you're there for the food.  Parking is much easier than in Washington Square, but don't bother trying to park on Chestnut -- instead try going to the other side of Lombard.\n\nThe food is not bad, it's made well but is forgettable at best.  Even something as simple as a BLT looks no better than something I can whip up for $0.25 at home.  \n\nThe fresh squeezed OJ tastes fresh and has that home-made taste to it. But then again so does Tropicana Home-style juice.  \n\nThe real bright star at this place are their scones, and are even better when mixed with their apple sauce that is usually next to the condiments.  \n\nWith my generally good review of this place, you might be wondering, why the two stars?  Well, here's why.\n\nFor the longest time I wondered if the apple sauce for the scones was reused or not.  But I always dismissed it for fear of destroying one of the few redeemable qualities of this place.  But last time I was there, just before closing, I saw the waitress mixing all the apple sauce from tables she had cleaned and putting it back into the fridge.\n\nNow, I personally don't double dip. But others do.  Do you want to catch herpes or something from apple sauce? I didn't think so!  \n\nOn top of that, one of the waiters has the typical extremely long pinky nail.   And I swear to God I saw it damn near touch my food as he was handing me my plate.  From what I heard, those pinky nails are used for either picking your ears or nose.  \n\n*shudder*\n\nSimply put..

Taco Bell had a huge line, so I ambled down the street to Home Plate.\n\nFirst impression: Man, this place hasn't had a deep scrubbing since I was last here in 1989. The grout on the floor, which I think was white at one time, was a shiny blackish-brown. The tabletops were clean,but if you made the mistake of letting your hands touch the underside it came away feeling like it needed heavy washing.\n\nI ordered huevos rancheros - one of my previous favorites.\n\nI was quickly served a warm scone and some strawberry and pear compote. The scone was spot on perfect. it was fresh and had a good number of dried currants in it. The compote had a ring along the inside of the ramekin indicating that it had been filled way in advance. Why? How long does it take to blop compote in a ramekin?\n\nBased on the outstanding nature of the scone I  eagerly awaited my huevos rancheros......\n\nDamn, what a let down.\n\nHere's my food from the plate up:\n\nPlate - Ice cold\n\nTortilla - Commercially made handmade thick tortilla, but stale to the point that it was totally dried-out at the edges.\n\nEggs - I asked for sunny-up because you can't f-those up,right? Wrong. My eggs were cooked in too-hot a pan for too long resulting in crunchy dark brown whites and a hard-cooked yolk.\n\nTomatillo sauce - Ice cold and tasted tinny.\n\nCheese - about eight strands of jack.\n\nPico de Gallo - good. It actually tasted fresh.\n\nPotato pancakes - Limp and fishy tasting. Limp indicates they were cooked in advance (why? it was 2:30 on a Wednesday. Were they expecting a huge rush?). Fishy tasting fried foods is sometimes  the result of using old canola oil. \n\nI was starving so I ate everything except those nasty potato pancakes.\n\nI was kicking myself for not waiting at Taco Bell.\n\nOn the way out, I noticed the two cooks frying potato pancakes.

The owner seems to love baseball, judging from the framed pictures inside the place (and the name of the place, duh). There is more than just breakfast/brunch available, but since we were there for the morning, I only bothered looking at the breakfast offerings. I had one of the daily specials: the garden omelette (asked for it with extra spinach instead of the avocado and with less cheese). My friend had the fried polenta with the apple-chicken sausage the second visit and for the first visit... my brain is failing. I think she had a frittata.\n\nSince we ordered breakfast, I got to try those scones. They are made in the right size: that is, they fit in the palm of your hand and aren't those ridiculously large bricks you find at fake pastry shops. The strawberry and mango sauce were a great complement to the scones. I only ate a sliver because my friend has this very strong obsession with them (and, so, I gave her the rest of mine). My omelette, by default, comes with 3 eggs. Egg whites are more. They filled mine with yummy veggie goodness (I'm not a vegetarian, however!), so I was quite pleased. It disappeared off my plate quickly. Their bread options are wheat, white, rye, sourdough, or an english muffin. I had the sourdough the first time and rye the second. Good bread. I would almost even call myself a bread snob. But, I'm not, really.\n\nI do believe she really liked the apple-chicken sausage and fried polenta. The frittata was akin to my omelette.

Somewhere like 2nd base and getting ready to steal 3rd.

That's important to never drop below 1/4 cup.\n- Fresh Raisin (maybe blueberry) Scones: Comes with every breakfast item and served with a berry jam.\n- Range of Menu Options: Broad selection and not always your typical picks though they offered your basic egg/toast/bacon plates too.\n- Reasonably Priced: $6 - $9 on average. It's breakfast, c'mon.\n- Portion: Pretty big if I do say so myself.\n- Frittata: My friend ordered the Home Plate Frittata ($8.45 or $8.25) with spinach, chicken sausage, cheese and pine nuts. It was super tasty and a nice change from the usual omelette. It comes with the potato-carrot pancake everyone yelps about but I found it to be less like a pancake and more like a Chinese scallion cake (minus scallions) or a roti bread. It's flat with a chewy texture and they serve it with apple sauce. I thought it was ok, but calling it a pancake sets the wrong expectation.\n\nWhat Was OK:\n- Home Plate Fried Polenta ($8.25) with bacon. I love when places offer polenta at all hours. This was came in 2 square blocks with mushroom and pine nuts. I liked the crisp pan fried outside, but the inside lacked salt. So I had to season it to taste. I'm also particular about my bacon. This came with 3 crispy slices which is fine, but they were really fatty pieces such that while crisp I knew I was just ingesting fat. \n- Raisin Pecan French Toast ($2.95): We asked for a special baby side order of Raisin Pecan French Toast which they were kind enough to accommodate. Good thing we only got 2 halves (1 square slice) because it wasn't that great. Just basic.\n\nI'd go up to bat at Home Plate again and while I won't expect any home runs, I know I'll get at least a solid a base run hit or two.", "author": "Cindy W."}

The buns are also different from what you usually get in these kind of places. \nThe girlfiend had some breakfast with bacon that was awesome: crispy but not burnt and not drowning in grease.\nFinally, it's pretty rare in SF to find a decent size glass of fresh squeezed orange juice for under 3 bucks. They got that, and also grapefruit juice or carrot juice.\nYou get the picture: everything in this place has that home made feel; very very different from the chain food like ihop across the street.\nAdd to this very depression-friendly prices and you get a really cool brunch place you could get addicted to.\n\nNow I don't know if the quality is always that good, but I'm ready to try again, because I was impressed.

We really like going here for a few reasons... it's a small business and we like supporting small business, the quality is good, and the price is GREAT.  We chatted with the owner one day and he was saying that with the economy as difficult as it is he has cut back on staff instead of lowering the quality of the products he uses or raising the prices.  The prices are VERY reasonable, and I know they don't skimp on their food.  A really good example is that they use an expensive syrup which is better quality as opposed to just cutting corners and using Cosco type of syrup.  It's real maple... not just goopy sugar.

The fritta was make with 3 eggs, spinach, olives, and feta cheese. It also came with two carrot and potato pancakes, applesauce, and a crescent dinner roll.

We found parking which was free since it was on Sunday, there was no wait, friendly staff, got our fresh hot coffee right away and the famouse scones and homade jam (rasin scone, appricot and strawberry jelly) they were simply deliciouse very delicate very much like a biscuit. My husband got chicken fried steak and he really liked it, it was perfectly battered and crispy, I got the crab benedict and it was really deliciouse, the hollandais sauce was a true hollandais, I don't understand but so many places can't manage to make this right for some sad reason?

Didn't see any cockroaches, but the food was way too greasy even for diner food. I did like the vibe, though.", "author": "A. T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-11-18", "description": "Great food. I love their buckwheat pancakes. I also adore the scones. One is never enough for me, so I usually order half a dozen to go. It gets really busy on weekends and holidays. I do drive half way across the city for breakfast, sometimes I don't know why. But I taste the scone and I never regret it.", "author": "bob k."}

We were seated right next to the kitchen and I witnessed they recycled the apple sauce for the scones.  The chef and the servers at the restaurant didn't wear gloves and their hands touch everything you could think of.  It definitely ruined my appetite and I was disgusted by what I saw.  If you really want to try out this place, make sure you don't sit too close to the kitchen area.", "author": "Bella L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-01-02", "description": "ok, i must admit.  my boyfriend-fiance-husband has been a gigantic fan of this place for the entire 9 years we have known each other (see aforementioned cadence of our relationship during which he has consistently espoused that home plate is the best breakfast in town).  i have been such a brunch snob (read: only want to go to \"cute\" places even if the food sucks just because its cute and cute people go there) most of my existence so have always pooh-poohed the home plate.  but when you get right down to it, he is right on.  first of all, they give you delicious warm scones as you sit down (for free, people) with  home-made fruit compote.  then, the food is actually great breakfast fare.  be sure to stick to the white board of specials on the wall -- these are your best options -- previously mentioned bf-fi-hus ALWAYS gets the special scramble.  this \"special\" is always available.  the food is good (beyond the scones and the potato-carrot pankcakes), the service is good, and what's amazing is that the iron chef behind the counter makes everything himself.  it's a one-chef, family owned place.  so break away from cute, if you can, and head to home plate for some good breakfast grub.", "author": "Lija H."}

I went last month for my birthday breakfast and it was DISGUSTING! My egg dish ( I can't even remember which one it was) appeared that an entire bottle of dried oregano had been dropped into it. I sent it back saying that it was in-edible due to this oregano and chose another plate that also was semi-edible. I thought it odd that the waitress left that oregano plate on our table and then when the bill came, I see why. She wanted me to pay for this in-edible dish. Now I'm not a picky eater and I understand that I need to eat what I choose, but do I need to pay for the chef's mistake? I called her back to our table and she was so angry with us, but did take it off the bill. Also the potato pancakes used to be delicious, now I have no idea what they are putting in them. They are like a piece of greasy pizza cardboard. I am really sad because I really used to like this place. it seems now that they are catering to the Lombard Street tourists and think they won't be seeing any of these people again so they have cut a lot of corners. Next time I'll be going to IHOP for a fluffy chain pancake.", "author": "Julia J."}
