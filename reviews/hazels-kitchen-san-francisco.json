I've loved every new thing that I've tried so far and hope to try everything else one day. Each sandwich is carefully designed for a unique combo of flavors and there are even some customer-submitted sandwich combos you can try.  Compared to the sandwich shop on 3rd, it will be less sub-like but the ingredients come together better. They sometimes toast the meat slightly and it really adds to the sandwich. \n\nMy favorites: \nChicken pesto: The chicken was a little dry and tough but it was such good blend of ingredients. Melted cheese is also one of my favorite things so this sandwich was a winner. \n\nJuan's special: sweet, saucy, spicy, bacony, and full of flavor\n\nBreakfast burrito/scramble: lots of flavor, variety of ingredients, slightly juicy, and filling enough for you to not overeat. \n\nHaley's special: I don't even remember what was in it, I just remember enjoying it a lot\n\nNot so favorites:\nSoups: Pretty hearty but not a huge fan of them; tastes a bit out of a can for me\n\nAll in all, great vibes from the server and the shop itself.", "author": "Lydia Z."}

Order food here, order coffee there, pick food up where and when? sit where? Did i order the wrong thing? I don't understand the average 4-star rating for this place. Tempted not to write a review because I have no words for my experience, I'm literally searching for something to say. AH!!! This \"confused\" person does have something to say. One cook in a tiny kitchen, that's the only thing I couldn't hate on.\n\n- Food, I've had better\n- Prices, average\n- Service, ? \n- Ambiance, no seating except outside \n\nAfter my run Sunday morning, I was craving breakfast. Landed here.\n\nObservation\n- no seating inside. \n- No coffee/espresso on the menu? Was suggested I am welcome to order coffee next door. \n- Order my food (no number, no nothing, so how will i know its ready and if that's my order). Get coffee next door at Farley's (i passed). \n-Sit at a (dirty) table leaning on a slope (damn SF hills). \n- Pick up my own food asking \"is that my order?\" every few minutes. Eat my food in the cold and on a slope. \n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\nWATERMELON JUICE (~$2) - it was fresh and I liked it. \n\nPANCAKES WITH EGG AND BACON ($6.95) - Pancakes were typical. Actually, tasted like air and had to put more syrup then I like to get some kind of flavor. Nothing special about the eggs. Bacon, i love center cut bacon. They served center cut bacon - like 8 pieces of bacon but they were very tiny, fragile, and crispy. Would really amount to 3 full juice bacon in real measurements. yup, one of those rare occasions where I'm consuming meat/pork. I figured the deli was almost like a drive-by window, decided to get my food \"to-go\" because it'll just be another mess trying to get a to-go box later. all my food was just piled onto each other. Seriously? You couldn't separate them? I had to rearrange my food before eating it. \n\nMAYBE i should have ordered a sandwich, that's what everyone's yelping about. After my experience, i said to myself \"what a waste of a Sunday breakfast. I would have been better off eating at home saving money\".\n\nWill I be back? Maybe for glass of watermelon juice.", "author": "Jane A."}

I came in earlier today at around 2 and the cashier looked up at me and proceeded to talk with a customer, just one other customer while I waited standing silently in front of her hoping she would take my order or at least say help, or acknowledge my presence. Neither of which she did. It was as if I didn't exist to her. Then when another customer entered she greeted them and skipped right over me. I have NEVER dealt with that kind of service in my life. As a current server, I have a higher tolerance for mishaps in the food and beverage industry, as I am in it myself and have been in this world for over a decade. \n\nThe woman in the kitchen making the food however gets 5 stars and I thank you for being attentive and prompt. But to the cashier, I just hope that you could please greet any and all clientele that walks into your establishment and greet them with a warm smile. You never know what kind of day someone is having. And here I was having a great day, visiting from out of town to my old stomping grounds, on a beautiful sunny day in the city I love and call home and I felt very put off by your lack of good service, attentiveness, and kindness. You were however very kind to your regulars who come in which I did note and found that to be wonderful. But please do be aware of each person that walks in as that is food and beverage 101 \"greet all guests upon entry into your store\". \n\nThank you kindly for your time in reading this. I'm sorry to have to give this place one star, but be advised that it is only for that cashier who worked on Nov 16 during the day. And one star is being rather kind of me. \n\nTake care.

Having moved to Potrero HIll a few years ago, I try to go to Hazel's as much as possible. \n\nHere's what I get:\nBreakfast: a breakfast burrito with extra cheese and extra crispy bacon. This is the ULTIMATE hangover helper/life saver. \n\nLunch: the 1A (turkey + cranberry) on sliced wheat or sourdough (depending on what I'm in the mood for), jack cheese (instead of provolone) and no onions. Delicious!!! The mayo-ish sauce they put on their sandwiches is AMAZING. I even bought a container of it to take camping one weekend! Everyone loved it, of course. It's the perfect compliment to any sando. \n\nOther awesomeness: the mac-n-cheese, quiches, fruit salad... mmmmm.\n\nThe service at Hazel's is perfect - they treat you like family. Leslie, the owner, is a gift to this Universe. The cooks are also some of the most friendly people you'll find on \"the Hill\". \n\nThe shop itself is small, but adorable. It's meant to be a walk-up shop. Step in, admire the cute decor, order your meal (made with love), and take it next door to Farley's if you want to eat inside at a table, or eat it outside on the cool parklet. Hazel's also just got some new patio furniture for their sidewalk dining. \n\nHazel's also CATERS!!! I threw a co-ed babyshower for one of my best friends and hired Hazel's to cater the event. We had a tray of sandwiches (the 1A and veggie), mac-n-cheese, quiches and fruit salad (yes, all the favorites I mentioned above). People were blown away at how good the food was. And Hazel's makes it super easy. I don't hire catering services often, and I was grateful for how easy Hazel's made the process. \n\nI bring people to Hazel's whenever I get the chance, and they're always thankful!\n\nIf you visit Hazel's for the first time, let them know.

The vinaigrette does not over power any other the components of the salad, so you get a nice light refreshing bite each time. \n\nFinally, in every bag they give you a flavored tootsie roll!

Put your hands down, and then you realize you're just in front of a sandwich shop on Portrero Hill. I don't know which of the two women in the shop is Hazel, but it's a charmer of a place. They apparently serve breakfast bagels, but my friend and I came by over the weekend for one of their seven sandwiches. Except for the $4.75 PB&J (which I must try), all of them range from $6.50 to $6.75.\r\n\r\nThey also have three tempting salads, all freshly made - pasta, Greek and a corn-bean combo - which sell for $2.95 for a half-pint serving. The best deal is definitely the half-sandwich/half-salad for $6.75 especially since the sandwiches are pretty hefty. I had the roast beef and cheddar, and while the meat is sparse between the sourdough slices, it is chockfull of lettuce, tomato and other healthy goodies. I like the use of the Chinese take-out container for the salad, though I was hoping for a Kosher pickle to complete the picture. There are only two tables, each with two chairs, outside on the sidewalk and a bench, so be prepared to take it to go. Farley's is just a couple of doors down, and an iced latte would be a nice way to wash it all down. This one is definitely a cut above the neighborhood sandwich shop.\r\n\r\nFOOD - 4 stars...fresh ingredients elevate this place \r\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...well, the outdoor table is nice on a sunny day...close your eyes and it's the Hamptons\r\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars\r\nOVERALL - 4 stars...sandwich shops are a dime a dozen, but a good one is worth going a few more blocks", "author": "Ed U."}

I chose the whole wheat--and I'm glad I did because those two slices were huge! At first I thought there was no way I'd finish even half of the sandwich, because it was stacked about three inches high with generous amounts of everything. I had to stop myself at 3/4 of the sandwich before I exploded. Oh, and I'm guessing the Hazel's dressing is some type of magical vinaigrette, because I devoured everything, including the tomatoes and cucumbers, which I'd usually toss.\n\nI also had a bite of sandwich 3b: rare roast beef with horseradish sauce. That was good, but I liked mine better. I especially loved that the sandwich was slathered with a horseradish sauce that imparted great flavor but wasn't unbearably hot.\n\nNext time I'm in this cute little neighborhood around lunch time, I'm pretty sure I'll make it back here, especially since Baked is just down the street.

The sandwiches are the mainstay of this place.  I've had the pastrami, the John's Special, and the tofu with sauteed vegetables: all were heaping with ingredients (a little sloppy but truly a bang for your buck, especially if you order the half sandwich for 5.25). These are all daily specials, and to mimic what an earlier reviewer said, you can't go wrong with them. The other day I ordered a sandwich from the regular menu and it was a disaster..I ordered the BLTA and there were all of 3 pieces of bacon in the entire sandwich. A very sad thing to behold.\n\n\nTheir soups are so-so; Ive only had the vegetarian chili and was not that impressed.\nTheir salads are actually quite good; I've had the chicken Caesar (the dressing was good but maybe overly garlicky in my opinion) and a few others..but I don't order them nearly as much as I had in the past since they remodeled last year (now the salads are not really displayed well, so they never catch my eye anymore).\n\nAs for breakfast...their oatmeal is by far the best deal, and probably best tasting thing I've had for breakfast there. Their bagels are only okay and compared to the cafe by my house, they are overpriced...This morning I ordered the granola, fresh fruit and yogurt for the first time. I guess it was a mistake. I mean, who puts honeydew and watermelon with their morning yogurt??? Those watery fruits don't really go well with dairy or grains in my opinion. There were a few strawberries, but they should have included bananas and other berries, in my humble opinion.\n\nI've never tried the pancakes, waffles, or the breakfast burrito, so I cannot speak to those items.\n\nA word about beverages: THEY DON'T HAVE COFFEE! They should. Farley's coffee tastes like caca. Hazel's serves pellegrino juices and Juice Squeeze, but I sincerely believe that the best thing on the menu is their Watermelon Aqua Fresca. It's not always advertised/on the menu, but when they have it, you would be doing yourself an unforgettable favor by ordering one. Really, really refreshing and delicious.\n\nContrary to what I've read here, I think the service is consistent, fast, hardworking and very sweet.

As Farley's doesn't make these items, I investigated and found that Hazel's, just a couple doors down, serves up these goodlookin' sandwich sets. As there is no place to sit- Hazel's is essentially a small kitchen and counter- they apparently have an arrangement with Farley's. Farley's will sometimes have a basket of sandwiches, presumably from when Hazel's closes shop for the day. \r\n\r\nSo I stopped by and ordered a sandwich. Granted, I ordered one of their tamer items, but I've produced superior turkey sandwiches in my kitchen. \r\n\r\nAnd when I inadvertently tipped over the top bun, I found that the sandwich maker had stuck in a leaf of lettuce that was rotten black. How the sandwich maker though friendly, either (1) didn't see this disgusting fossilized leaf of lettuce, or (2) saw it and thought it was okay, is a head scratcher.

My biggest complaint would be the false advertisement on the 'rare roast beef'. The roast beef on my sandwich was about as rare as 1-day old road kill. I took a bite off a second sandwich (my wife's), grilled chicken something or other, and well the overlap to my sandwich was incredible. The taste of the chicken got lost in the mayo-lettuce-tomato-cucumber-red onion juice. Y U C K  I E S.\n\nAs a general rule, not being in the restaurant business, if there's too much sauce or gunk on food, then it simply isn't clean or high quality. If this sandwich was $5 no problem, but we're talking $8 plus... and so I've come to expect more. \n\nI was so insulted by their interpretation of 'rare roast beef' that I called the manager and I was told that next time I should ask \"How rare is today's advertised rare roast beef\"? This sounded a bit absurd, should I ask my Barista at Starbucks how much caffeine does my espresso have TODAY?\n\nPrediction:  The popular breakfast burritos (which I haven't tried) will be loaded with some concoction of tomatoes, red onion, garlic, and vinegar which they will call pico de gallo... to again... hide the taste/quality of the real ingredients but to appeal to the unsophisticated palate. It's the same formula that 1001 Chinese food restaurants follow in metropolitan areas all over America... for instance.\n\nI'm new to the area so I may go back for safe choices such as bagels and oatmeal.

My side of greek cucumber salad was equally fresh and delicious.\n\nI guess I must've gotten lucky because my sis, who eats here more often, has mentioned the inconsistency of their sandwiches.

Fresh ingredients, fresh bread, and no irritating reminder \"it's extra for avocado\", like Whole Foods gives. \n\nWe build our own: turkey with avocado, lettuce, tomato, red onion, pesto and light mayo, on toasted dutch crunch. It's addictive. Have it once and you'll find yourself thinking about it the next day around lunch time. You might just go back and get it again.\n\nThe minestrone was good, but don't eat the tiny meatball in it. It's a small hamburger lump.\n\nThis is a no frills shop with food to go. The outdoor tables are nice in the summer, but in the winter, get your food and then go next door for coffee. The coffee shop will let you eat Hazel's food at one of their tables as long as you patronize them as well.\n\nThis is 3 stars, not 4, because we've never tried the salads, which are the other half of their menu.", "author": "Simone E."}

If it were a puppy, it would be a Maltese http://www.kateconnick.com/postcards/harleemalt0304.jpg or a chihuahua http://www.chihuahua.hu/kepek/tucsisztar.jpg Unfortunately this may explain Hazel's Napoleon complex - you'll understand in a moment.\n\nEach time I visit Hazel's I stare agape in amazement as a three person crew deftly whisks about a kitchen the size of a postage stamp. Not only is it small as a thimble, but kitchy like a thimble. The whole shop is tastefully done up in pastel with 100s of knick-knacks and matching dishware. One wonders does food actually come from this play kitchen?\n\nIndeed it does. And it's decent... tasting. I've had a garden salad with tuna. It was delicious - but totally weird. When taking my order to go I was like, \"Damn! This salad's heavy!\" Is this good value for my money, or just overcompensation for a pint-sized kitchen? The salad had nearly a whole mixing bowl of tuna on top. I mean, there was at least a pound of the stuff - a one inch tuna layer to dig through before you hit any greens. There was no way I could eat all that tuna. Did I mention that fisherman were out of work because the sea was now devoid of tuna?\n\nAnother occasion I ordered a roast beef sandwich and forgettable macaroni side salad. My friend and I shared at a cozy pastel table on the sidewalk. The sandwich was tasty but Hazel's hangup reared its ugly head again. The sandwhich was nearly 4 inches tall. Despite my best effort to unhinge my jaw I couldn't wrap my maw around it. I had to take a play from Napolean and divide and conquer my lunch.\n\nQuarter point added for free Ritz crackers for kids and giants, like me, to nibble on while waiting for sandwiches.\n\n(3.25 * stars)", "author": "Brady K."}

However, the salads in the display case didn't look too fresh, I requested a fruit salad and only after I paid and my mac and cheese was ready did they tell me they didn't have any fruit salad (they mentioned they had ran out earlier, but just didn't think to tell me when I was ordering, thus, the 'out of it' ness I referred to earlier). \n\nHowever, the service was definitely nice and not snarling. The woman behind the counter smiled and said I could have a bagel instead of the non existent fruit salad. She also asked if I wanted any spread and if I wanted it toasted.

Until I went in today to get a sandwich and the woman (with long, loose hair) was handed a taste of something being made by a co-worker and then LICKED HER FINGERS while she was making my sandwich! I WAS MORTIFIED!\nI told the countergirl that she might want to suggest that the owner (?) NOT LICK HER FINGERS while making food!\nWhen The Licker handed me my sandwich, she said, 'what's wrong?', to which I replied, \"I'd prefer it if you didn't lick your fingers while you were making my sandwich. I'm going to eat it because I'm starving.\" (which I realized later wasn't a good idea, I pulled the sandwich apart and ate the half that she didn't touch post-lick, which was only the lettuce). I ended up only eating the meat, cheese and half the bread, discarding the potentially tainted veggies. YUCK! I was too hungry to think straight, or I'd have demanded a remake by a hygienic person.\nEven if the maker had not LICKED HER FINGERS while making my sandwich, it was lame today. The bread was tough, the tomatoes color/flavorless. boo. I won't be rushing back to Hazel's any time soon. Too bad, since I've had four or so great lunches there in as many weeks. I'm pretty sure I can find a sandwich joint whose cooks don't LICK THEIR FINGERS as they go. \n\nOH! And the best part?? She held up her non-licky fingers, and said, 'I didn't touch your food, I used these fingers.' AS IF THAT MAKES IT BETTER! I am horrified. Don't go to Hazel's, at least not until they train their sandwich makers to NOT LICK THEIR FINGERS (and aren't they supposed to be wearing gloves, anyway?)!!!\n\nHazel's introduced me to the gorgeousness that is dutch crunch bread.

They remind me of the kind of sandwiches my high school cafeteria used to make which were by the way, so good that I still came back to have one of their sandwiches well after I graduated.", "author": "Jean A."}

Be sure they get your order correct because I happen to know one loyal yet lately disgruntled customer.  Ritz crackers and candies to snack on while you wait.  I am enjoying an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie as I write this favorable review.", "author": "Melissa B."}

I was starving and decided to try it out.  But I waited to see if the line would dissipate.  It didn't.  I braved waiting in the cold.  I know it's sunny Potrero Hill but it's been freezing for the last two weeks and Hazel's Kitchen was on the shady side of the street.  I ordered the vege sandwich and asked for cucumbers and a small vege chili.  Hazel's Kitchen's interior looked like something I would find in a Martha Stewart magazine.  It was nice and clean.  I thought the sandwich was a tad too expensive(total $10) for what it was(not loaded enough) and the chili was just okay.  Oh and they forgot my cucumbers.  Boo.", "author": "Joni S."}

But I really liked the quality of the ingredients that went into making the sandwich. That day, I had the carrot-ginger soup and their oatmeal-chocolate chip cookie. Both were excellent.\n\nI still need to go back one day to fully investigated their menu and assign a rating. For now, 3*.", "author": "Rahul T."}

I'm a big fan of their lunchbox special which includes a half sandwich (I'm partial to the roast beef with horseradish mayo), a small soup and a side salad. And when I say it's a great place for a quick bite to eat, I mean it. You are in and out within three minutes. \n\nThe only reason they lack the fifth star in my review is the lack of seating.", "author": "Scott W."}

I like their sandwiches and the girls have always been nice to me. I think if you are pleasant you typically get a pleasant response back.  And for goodness sake, it's a sandwich shop not Gary Danko.   I love their bagels with scrambled eggs for breakfast!  Hits the spot with a coffee from Farley's.", "author": "Kelly M."}

You can expect half an avocado - not just a smear - plus cucumber, lettuce, sprouts, and tomato.  Minus one point for the wimpy store-bought bread.  At 8$ a sandwich I expect a thick cut of something fresh baked.", "author": "Fallon C."}

My first impression was \"How effing cute!\" I loved the 50's decor and interior. I loved the story of the shop even more and I was smitten by the pics of the owner's twins. I'm a single mom and small biz owner so it touched me. I wanted to support it. I wanted to come back again and again. I ordered a piece of pre-made veggie quiche and somehow I waited a very long while for it to come out of the microwave scalding hot. I saw other folks being served rather quickly and their stuff was more complex. I was patient though I wanted to go back there and help. The server and the register person WERE very nice and I luckily had no finger licking experiences. I do have to say though, yes, they are supposed to have their hair back and yes, they are supposed to wear gloves which they were not doing. That may be a health code problem and that sucks but I'm not freaking out about it. The quiche was lovely and it was a good size too. I'll probably go back but yeah, it took too long and was too hot and I had to wait 7 or so minutes after I got it for it not to burn my mouth.", "author": "Melisa B."}

Today the sandwich specials at Hazel's Kitchen had me locked in a state of indecision for about 5 minutes. When it came time to order, in usual fashion I made a last minute decision and picked a winner. A turkey sandwich between two slices of whole wheat with a pesto aioli, warm provolone, and lots of veggies - lettuce, thinly sliced zucchini, caramelized onions, and roasted red peppers - tossed in a light balsamic vinaigrette. The beautiful colors made it even more appetizing. Mmm, mmm, good! My only complaint (yes, I know that I'm a snob) is that the turkey cold cuts were too salty for my taste, and the texture of the cut resembled the ones that come in a 100 slice bulk pack. I would've much preferred an oven roasted breast. It would be just as good without the meat. But yes, aside from that, it was delicious with a capital D. Extra points for the cuteness of the interior!", "author": "Monica N."}

I got a bagel with their lox spread which was pretty good. They actually use real lox in the spread versus the over processed stuff you find at most places. You could tell because the spread was  white with pink spots, not all pink. My boyfriend got the scrambled egg sandwich. I had a bite and it was terribly bland even though I watched them season it. They make the eggs in the microwave which never fares well. They were rubbery and dry. Yuck. The service here was pretty bad. Super slow! And before you ask -- no there were not a bunch of people in front of me. I had time to go to Farley, order 2 lattes, and finish my whole latte in the time it took them to make my order. It took about 15 minutes for us to get our orders and neither were difficult to make especially considering the eggs were microwaved. I MIGHT go back to try their sandwiches but it is doubtful. I'll just stick to Farley's and their yummy pastries.", "author": "Sierra d."}
