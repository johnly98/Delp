Not the usual alcohol ones (though I wish it was the usual happy hour drinks), but juice shots. A coworker ran over to Pressed Juicery on October 19th around 1:30pm.\n\nAlmost everyone did a wellness shot, but since I was tired AF, I decided to do a Kona Espresso Shot: kona espresso, filtered water. Now I like my coffee strong and typically hot, so I found this rather weak. The chilled factor didn't help as it made it taste a little watery. Still, it was easy to drink and did the job. It kept me awake.\n\nI've never been big on juice, but their shots are okay. Not sure how effective juicing is in the long run, but once in a while I don't mind doing a shot.

I don't know why it's 4 for $20 when Pressed Juicery members already get 1 bottle for $5!\n\nORDER - I order my usual Greens, Citrus, and Almond since I'm a Pressed Juicery member.

Next drink, Greens 2 and he tells me they are completely out of it. Really? Greens 1 is gone because I have taken the last 2 bottles and now Greens 2? He suggested another Greens, but I didn't want that one. \n\nI believe there is only 2 mini fridges at this Pressed Juicery. Why is the stock limited and not stocked up like the other Pressed Juicery's? This should be one of the busiest locations because this mall was packed for a Thursday afternoon.

I like the fact that for someone who is not as familiar to juicing as myself, this place tends to make you feel comfortable in a way. The person working there asked me what favors I like and let me try their popular ones as well as favors that I didn't think will be good. I must have sampled half of the menu before getting to the favor I like. What I like about the experience was that they allowed you to sample all of it rather than buying each one and seeing if you like it. Considering how much a bottle cost, $5 dollars for members and $6.50 for non-members, it is great that they let you sample all of it before you buy a bottle. Would I continue to pay $5 dollars a bottle? Probably not, but I will definitely get into juicing myself after having tried it. Definitely a must try for someone who isn't into eating veggies and fruits like me (I know they are good for me but meat is so much better!)", "author": "Chenny O."}

I wanted the large green freeze but when I tried to order from the empty counter the girl told me it's a watery flavor and doesn't come out well but she could give it a try to check on the consistency.\n\nShe didn't have much optimism and to be honest, paying $7 for a thing that seems like has a kamikaze style consistency didn't sound that great but that was the only flavor that really sounded appealing to me. \n\nThe girl at the counter gave the freeze swirl a try and quickly turned around with a rather disgusted face stating it was still pretty leaky and watery. I was ready to walk away when she asked if I wanted to try their strawberry version, that she noted as being more popular.\n\nThe strawberry version sounded kind of boring to me but there was nothing else at the food court I was in the mood for so I tested it, it wasn't great but also wasn't terrible, and asked for a small with no toppings. The girl then turned around and asked if I wanted a small (my new size request) AND a large (my old size request), which seemed either very strange or the worst attempt ever at an upsell to a single person. \n\nIt was fine but not memorable or anything I'd crave again/go out of my way for... at least not in the basement of an indoor mall, but I could see myself being drawn to this again at a different more scenic outdoor location on a nice day.", "author": "Candice G."}

At over $6 for a juice, and at a mall kiosk no less, you could really be getting better and bigger cold pressed bottles from indie juiceries. \n\nTheir flavors are standard. I prefer the ones off of the Citrus menu, and my go-to is Citrus 2, which has pineapple, lemon, apple, and mint. The mint was especially strong this time, which was a nice, cool contrast to the otherwise apple-dominant drink.\n\nLast weekend, they were offering samples of the new pink and blue Vogue juices. The juice sample cups they have are waaaaay too small. You're not going to get a good taste of all of the ingredients in the terrifyingly neon juices, which wasn't a good incentive to buy the full size.\n\nWhen I stopped by, the service was pretty eh.

They are made without preservatives! If you are new to Pressed Juicery, there are several types: Roots, fruits, greens, and some special blends that come bottled for on the go. They do juice cleanses as well!\n\nMy favorite is the Citrus 1 (pineapple, coconut water, aloe Vera, cucumber, and lemon) this drink is refreshing and hydrating...easy on the tastebuds. If you're looking for something more \"green\" the Greens 3 (Apple, celery, cucumber, ginger, kale, lemon, parsley, romaine, spinach) is drinkable enough for me with all the good stuff. I love this for when I need to get these nutrients in my diet for the day! The juices here are not cheap but for the health factor and convenience I would totally subscribe to getting these drinks delivered to me if the price wasn't so high. \n\nMinus one star for the hit and miss service because when I walked up the staff were not paying attention to me and about three other people who were standing at the counter waiting to be helped.

But since I was always busy with school, I never really found time to actually go out and look. So one day when I saw the stand at Westfield one day, I was stoked to try it out.\n\nPros:\n- They provide many different concoctions of pressed juices, each with different ingredients that are meant to provide your body with different health benefits apparently. \n- They have juices that are green-based, fruit-based, and a mix of both.\n- Surprisingly, the prices at this kiosk were decent in comparison to other places I've heard some range from $9-$12, but this place priced their drinks at $6.50\n- It's in the mall, so if you find yourself wanting something that doesn't have the added ingredients, then this place is the place for you.\n- They categorize the drinks, which i find pretty neat but yeah.\n\nCons:\n- The service is a hit or miss. There were two workers working that day and while one was attentive and helpful. the other one was in their own world doing something else. \n- While the price is decent, the ingredients are pretty simple.. so simple that I could probably just make my own pressed juice at home for half the price.\n- The drink had some weird thick consistency, but i put it off as it being part of the fruits in the drink.\n\nI opted for two fruity drinks, which both had pineapple. I enjoyed the pineapple, mint, ginger, and pear one since i'm an avid fan of ginger. The other drink had similar ingredients, except it also had lemon and apple in substitution for ginger and pear. That drink had a weird consistency to it. \n\nIn conclusion, it's nice to try, but I don't think I'd come often.", "author": "Jerianne G."}

That makes me feel more at home and at ease with being in a hectic place like the mall. I say all these good things about his service in particular because I used to serve in retail and I know how SUPER stressful it can be. Yet, he is always very kind and very genuine about making sure that we (the customers) are all taken care of (which was something he actually told me). \n\nNot only is his service great, but the juices (especially Citrus 2 and the rose lemonade) are super yummy. A bit pricy but what can you do? Besides, they taste great. So definitely worth the money. Their Freezes are okay too, but I'm always here for the juices and the always great service I get.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-15", "description": "I finally feel that I have strong reason to write a full review after doing a day cleanse with their juices. Now many people do juice cleanses for different reasons whether it's to detox, jumpstart clean eating again, etc. I personally decided to try a one day cleanse during the week leading up to my half marathon. I made sure I picked a day where I wouldn't be training or any crazy physical activity since I knew my energy would be lower than usual. Their day cleanse currently is $40 which includes 6 bottles plus two waters, which I found to be a great deal\n\nI was assisted by a very helpful worker, Michael, who seemed to enjoy helping me customize my 6 bottles. I told him I was looking for what would help me re-energize, detox and hydrate the most. I chose 1 citrus, 2 greens, 2 roots, and the chocolate almond for the signature blend which is meant to be taken as the last bottle. \n\nThis was my first cleanse every so I was a little worried of how much I'd have withdrawls of actually chewing food or if I'd get hungry. It was definitely tough (esp being on IG and scrolling through people's delicious looking lunches), but the juices actually kept me content throughout the day. I didn't feel any fatigue, I think the chlorophyll h2o helped with that. My favorites were the citrus and greens. The roots has a more earthy taste to it and I don't recommend the one with cayenne and carrots, the taste was too strong for my liking. The chocolate almond at the end of the day was certainly a treat! I downed that one easily, it tasted just like a protein shake\n\nDo expect making trips to the bathroom more frequently than usual. The most I went was probably 3 times within an hour haha and it's also important to be drinking regular water throughout the day to help with the hydration and for me it was just good to wash everything down.\n\nNow for the real review of when I started feeling the benefits of it! I didn't wake up feeling all brolic and able to do 20 burpees or anything crazy. I did feel energized and awake first thing in the morning. I was back to solids but made sure my meals were clean for the day. I had egg cups with turkey, tomato, spinach and cheese for breakfast and tilapia with steamed veggies for lunch and at least 64 ounces of water throughout the day. When I went for my run after work, I felt amazing! I felt like I was gliding through my 5 miles, which usually takes me longer to get in the groove. There was no gross foods or any toxins in my body weighing me down, therefore I was able to pace myself easily.\n\nI'm glad I chose to do a day cleanse...3 days may be a little tough for me but I definitely recommend their juices here.", "author": "Georgina G."}

Keep walking past the hypnotic smells of giant hot sugar topped pretzels and other aromatic lures - to reach Pressed Juicery's modest counter - conveniently located by BART.\n\nPressed Juicery's nuts milks are rich and decadent. The helpful staff at Pressed Juicery are also generous with free samples - if you're interested in trying them before you buy them. I recommend their classic Vanilla Almond milk which is sweetened with dates and has fresh vanilla bean in it - or their Brazil Nut drink which is unique - but oh so luxuriously what's up. It even has kale, romaine, and spinach in it.\n\nMy only advice in regards to Pressed Juicery's divine nut milks - is to not drink them in excess. Their Brazil Nut drink packs a heavy selenium punch and like the other almond drinks it is high in natural fats and calories. And though they're all naturally sweetened with dates - it never hurts to moderate your sugar intake.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

I attend classes at the San Francisco State Downtown Campus so after emerging from a grotty BART ride, I like to grab a couple to tide me over. The good news is that the juices are always fresh, stored with utmost care (so the juice is chilled and palatable), and made quality produce. Bad news is that the staff I've come across are anti social to a fault and some of the elixirs don't warrant a $6 price tag for 16 oz.\n\nIf a sense of renewed vitality is the goal, I go for the Citrus 4, Greens 5, and Roots 1. I really like the marriage of aloe vera, cucumber, and pineapple in the Citrus 4. The Greens 5 is a bit different than your average sludge because the addition of fennel and orange give it a nice pop. The Roots 1 is a very earthy and robust combination of beets, carrots, and greens. If I'm looking for a sweet juice, I opt for the pineapple, pear, ginger, and mint. Definitely their best tasting combination I've tried thus far. Some of the other concoctions I've purchased were easy to drink in terms of consistency but hard to want to drink because of their overall flavor and after taste. \n\nMy main dig is that the customer service has been a downer every time I've made it to this Pressed Juicery location. First off, these employees look miserable. Upon my first visit, I asked for specific suggestions. The girl at the cash register basically grunted that the green 4 was popular and set down a menu on the counter in front me. Another time, a guy who rang me up never said a word. He acknowledged my presence with a nod, retrieved the juices I wanted, set them down, rang me up, and then just stood there. Not even letting me know how much I owed. Just staring off into space, totally mute, waiting for me to fork over some cash. The whole exchange was so awkward that I ended up going to Jamba Juice the next week to palette cleanse. \n\nIf you are close to Westfield Mall and wanting health conscious juice made with all natural ingredients, Pressed Juicery is the way to go but if you're hoping for service with a smile and clear answers to any questions you may have, you're likely to be disappointed.", "author": "Ruby G."}

Lost 3 lbs by the 3rd day...I'll take that!\n\nI like that you can pick your own mix of juices within the general guidelines they give you for the cleanse. Also like that you can pick the sweetness level of your juices (1 for low sugar content)...all the way up to 5 for more sugar). I'm a fan of the vanilla almond, beets 3, brazil nut, and rose water.\n\nCan be a bit pricey if doing a multi-day cleanse but I did feel refreshed afterwards.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-01", "description": "This little kiosk is located right behind the Starbucks at the Powell mall entrance (next to Abercrombie & Fitch on the lower floor). \n\nI was never into the whole juice craze thing mainly bc juice is loaded with sugar, and lack fiber and protein. But I have been trying to get back into my regular healthy eating after eating out for consecutive celebrations, hang outs, vacation, etc. So I thought I'd try a 1 day \"cleanse\". \n\nWHAT I GOT:\n- Greens 1: Refreshing, light, definitely taste the celery (ok, recommend for morning)\n- Greens 3: Similar to Greens 1 but with an extra spicy ginger kick (meh)\n- Greens 5: My favorite one probably bc it's the sweetest one from the pineapple/orange and it's not celery/cucumber based (yum!)\n- Citrus 1: Tad sweet and citrusy, definitely taste the cucumber, pineapple helps a lot (not bad)\n- Roots 3: Damn, this one packs a punch. Really spicy and gingery. I had to chug this baby down. (recommend if you need a wake-me-up)\n\nYAYS:\n+ You do feel mentally healthier from drinking these. I can also say my GI system cleared up a bit.\n+ They have a bundle sale 5/$30 which saves you some pocket change. And if you sign up for their rewards program, you get 25% off your first purchase. \n+ Service was friendly. They know which items are more popular/good for beginners, so ask questions!\n\nNAYS:\n- These juices were rather bland.

Your body needs nutritious substance to fight off the infection. (I learned this the hard way.)\n- Be aware that each bottle only ranges 60-200 kcal (except the nut-based ones), so you will be starving your body - hence you may feel a little groggier than usual. \n\nTO CONCLUDE:\nNot sure if I'd drink these again even though they are more affordable than the other juice shops (ie Project Juice, Living Greens).

The tagline says my scarlet letter is a starbucks gold card, but I tried the juices from the noe valley location once and I fell in love.  It's frightening to know that the drink I crave now is 4x more expensive that what it used to be. Oh well, San Francisco livin', right?\n\nOn to the review of this location, to echo the comments of my fellow reviewers, the employees here are not quite as friendly as the ones at the noe valley location. To be fair though, given the location, I get it. However, no points to the employees here for giving you death stares when asking to sample a new flavor, nor for the lack of knowledge of the different juices.\n\nThis rating, however, is specifically for the chocolate almond I purchased here that I assume had been toppled over sitting in their refrigerator for a bit too long.  I didn't notice this at first, but when I was done with the drink and miles away from the mall, I realized that the drink had settled, and formed a weird leathery, plastic-y thing on the side of the bottle.  Now, I get it. It's almond milk, it's pressed juice, it settles. But usually when I see this, you can just shake it and the separation goes away.  No chance here, this build up was solid.  Besides it just being a little gross, I have to wonder, is that where all the nutrients are? Did I really just pay $8 to not have all the nutrients this beverage claims to deliver? \n\nHowever, I looked pass the incident, as I realized maybe it was just an oversight on the staff's part.  I came back here again and purchased the same drink.  (The drink's good, what can I say.) Initially, I didn't see any thing awry with the drink, so I happily paid and continued with my shopping.  After a couple of sips though,  I noticed the same thing, but this time the built up sediment was floating around the drink.\n\nEven if it is natural, it's a bit disappointing to have chucks of something floating around what should be a smooth drink.  I have never experienced the same thing at the noe valley location, so it makes me feel that this is an indicator that products here just don't move as quickly. Not ideal.\n\nRegardless, I can't say I won't come back.  Like I mentioned at the beginning of my review, this place is my new addiction.  What I will say though, is that I will make every effort to avoid this location if I can.", "author": "Patricia K."}

Giving a 5 star review for their Palo Alto location and a 1.5 stars for this one? The service. Coming here a few times, I will probably never come here again. I go to school in Union Square and find it convenient that I can come get my juices after/between class. No. I'd rather drive farther to the Palo Alto location than deal with this. \n\n1) First time going, I was on the 2nd day of my juice cleanse and needed to buy the last 2 days. Stopped by. Homegirl working there had the most horrrrrrrrible attitude. Didn't know what she was talking about when I asked for certain benefits and what juices were good. Gave me crap for wanting to buy more than one juice as one full day is already 8 juices which means I had to choose 16 juices. Everytime I was trying to separate the juices I picked for each day into different rows to keep track, she kept mixing them up. excuse me, stop touching my juice. and worst part, when I got home, she put in almost 1/4 of them the wrong flavors. I asked for half of them to be greens 1.5 and she gave me all greens 1. \n\n2) A lot of the juices were out of stock. \n\n3) 3rd time I went, it was around 3-4 in the afternoon. No one was even working. I stood there for a few minutes looking at the menu/waiting for someone to help me. Nope. Not a single person was at the counter. It was completely empty. So I left and vowed to never come back. lol\n\n1.5/5 - 1 points for the juices being delicious. I still love Pressed Juicery, but I hate this branch. This is the only PJ I've been to that was like this. 0.5 for the girl labeling my juices. even though they were in the wrong order..... -_- ugh", "author": "Carmen L."}

It is a good deal,but the promotion will end on Jan 10.\n\nFor the service, like other yelpers said, it is not that good. I expect they have more knowledgable and experienced staff working there. It will be better if they assist me to choose what I want for the cleanse rather than letting me circle the cleanse I want on the paper. I took pretty much time to read and choose the flavors on the paper. The staff seem to be impatient. Besides, I registered my information when I came there last time. However, the staff said they can't find any record. But I am sure I registered last time with my phone number. Also, some flavors are out. \n\nThe stars are given to the great deal of the price.", "author": "Cynthia P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-17", "description": "Agree with the other less than five star reviews that the service here could use a revamp. I suspect since the kiosk is located right by one of the BART entrances in and out of the mall, the staff get a colorful assortment of foot traffic and plenty of crazies, so when the actual paying/interested customer comes by, they're kind of over it. Thankfully my coworkers picked up a pamphlet of the juice menu offerings and we pretty much know what we want, so as not to inundate the reps with questions. The menu is helpful in that the ingredients in every drink are listed, and there are options for single, 3-day, and 7-day juice cleanses as well as pricing for all. \n\nI think the location of the kiosk could be placed in a more centralized and brightly lit area of the mall. Where they are now is kind of easy to miss unless you enter or exit near that spot. However, they seem to be doing pretty decent business cause they frequently run out of stock (either that, or their replenishment is not too good).\n\nPricey - on average, one bottle of juice runs $6.50, but sometimes they have promotions like buy one get one free.", "author": "Elaine W."}

Frantz was the employee that helped us. I wanted to give him a shot out for his incredible customer service and patience. He was knowledgeable about the products and really was the main reason why I decided to get something after all. Great customer service goes a long way and he proves to be a great asset to the company. I ended up getting the vanilla almond coffee which was delicious even though it had a bit of a gritty finish going down. I can't wait to try the vanilla almond that we brought home with us. I would definitely come back again to explore some more.", "author": "Scott H."}

There was one guy manning the counter on a Sunday afternoon. I approached him and asked him about the samples he was offering. He had no idea what they were. Then I asked for his opinion on which drink to get. Again, had no idea and just told me to pick whatever I wanted. He sure knows how to sell the product..... *rolls eyes* If I hadn't already heard about this company I would've walked away bc I was so turned off by the incompetent employee. The guy couldn't answer any of my questions and made me feel like I was bothering him.\n\nI much prefer the kiosk at the Ferry Building.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-07", "description": "I originally gave Pressed Juice four stars because I really like juice, especially in the health food desert of the mall.  On further consideration, I've reduced the rating to 3 stars.  The juice at Cafe Bellini a few yards away is much better.\n\nPressed Juice is the most ubiquitous juice chain in SF, and also the worst.  All the juice tastes not-fresh.  It doesn't taste rotten or super awful, but it doesn't have that fresh flavor you expect (and get) with fresh pressed juice.  This is probably because the juice is made in LA and shipped to SF.  The \"Evolution\" brand juice in the refrigerator case at the supermarket tastes fresher.  \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThis is not a very exciting juice place at all, I have had far better.  \nFirst, none of the juice is made to order, so you are stuck with premade mixtures.  Second none of these are what I would ever choose myself.  Third a lot of them taste unappealing / bad.\n\nOn the upside they offer samples, so you can try the flavors before buying, and the prices are a lot less than the similar Project Juice in the nearby Crocker Galleria.   At Project Juice, I liked almost all the flavors, but I did not like most of them at Pressed Juice. I'm not really sure what the difference is, perhaps quality of produce, or proportions in the mixes.  \n\nBoth of these places really annoy me by not having a plain kale with cucumber, apple, or pineapple juice.  This is a very standard juice mix that is nearly always available at juice places, with possible additions like mint or ginger.  I do not want chard or spinach in my juice due to high oxalate content.  These veggies are better consumed cooked.   \n\nI would also like to see collards and sunflower and pea sprouts offered in juices.  Sadly these are not yet common anywhere.  \n\nIn any case, if you are dying in the wasteland of the mall, grab some bottled pressed juice here, or across the way at Cafe Bellini, where the juice is made fresh to order in a centrifugal juicer.  You can get the coveted kale juice mix over there, but I settled for a cucumber juice mix at Pressed Juice after numerous samples.\n\nI agree with the reviewer who brought up organics - it's an issue.  If you like juice you probably like organic juice, so Pressed Juice should really try to label organics and use them when available.  I was wondering in particular where the aloe and coconut in my drink came from, so more food source transparency would be nice.", "author": "N T."}
