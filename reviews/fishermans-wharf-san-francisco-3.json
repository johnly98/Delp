Last year I went here with a friend and bought some food, and it was just \"meh\". The calamari was chewy and the fish and chips really didn't taste fresh at all. I love some good fried seafood, but the options here just weren't making my tummy jump for joy. And I love me some fish and chips too!\n\nThis recent visit, I literally walked around in circles a few time taking a look into the cases to see if anything really screamed out at me. Nothing!\n\nBut this is a must see place of SF. It's just one of those must see touristy places. There's also a wide variety of entertainment, mainly street performers. And you have a wide variety of mainstream food options in the area as well. You have Boudin's SF there and McDonalds if you really are craving that. Then, there's shopping opportunities there too. I wasn't at all intrigued by any of the stores. I did go to The San Francisco Dungeon! And I also jumped onto one of the Big Bus for the night panoramic tour.

Recently, I tend to avoid touristy areas as I don't like dealing with crowds. (Maybe it's just my old age, but I like to keep it low key.) Last week, I went to Fisherman's Wharf and decided to embrace it. I got here on Thursday, September 27th around 6pm.\n\nI ended up checking out Coco Fresh Tea & Juice for a boba tea and Fog Harbor Fish House for a seafood centric dinner. It was a gloomy and cold day, so very chill. Not a lot of people walking around. In the past, I've visiting numerous spots: Alioto's Restaurant, Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, Buena Vista Cafe, Ciopinno's, Ghirardelli Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop, Gold Dust Bar & Piano Lounge, McCormick & Kuleto's Seafood & Steaks, Original Joe's, Pier Market Seafood Restaurant, Players Sports Grill & Arcade, Wipeout Bar an Grill, 7D Experience, Pier 39, Sea Lion Center, etc. I actually didn't know FW was this large until I looked at the businesses on their site. I honestly thought it was just that small around around Ghirardelli Square. I guess I've been to more businesses in this area than I thought. It was fun walking around and reliving my younger years. We used to go to Wipeout and sit at a fire pit, just drinking and talking. Reminded me of when we used to hang out at Pier 39 all the time.\n\nAn enjoyable evening playing tourist.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-21", "description": "Reviews for places like Fisherman's Wharf are typically an anomaly for me, but I thought with the upcoming tourist season, tourists would be interested in getting the heads up on what to expect, along with my out of town Yelp friends.\n\nFirst and foremost, \"the Wharf\", as we locals refer to it, is definitely a touristy locale. In addition to the endless clam chowder and sourdough bread, think lots of tschotske shops filled with SF magnets, SF t-shirts and sweatshirts, etc.  That being said, it doesn't mean it isn't fun.  As a local, I often take a nice walk through the Wharf when the weather is especially nice.  It's an entertaining pastime. In the peak of summer, with all the foreign languages being spoken, I feel like I'm the one who has traveled to a foreign country.  Of course, the backdrop of the Bay, is always alluring, even if you live nearby, and have seen it hundreds of times.\n\nDining here, however, is a different story.  Locals typically don't think of the Wharf when they think of eating out.  I have come here during crab season, though, to purchase live crabs and have them cook it on the premises for me to take home and devour on the couch.  Outside of that, the only place I've been to recently is Alioto's, which has been owned by the famed Alioto family since the 1920's.  It's ok, if you find yourself at the Wharf, as you'll get friendly service, and decent food at tourist prices, but I wouldn't describe Alioto's as a destination by any means.  \n\nThere are often lots of \"colorful\" characters roaming around the Wharf.  You'll likely run into street performers ranging from magicians, to rap singers.  There's also the famous \"Bushman\" of Fisherman's Wharf.  The original one died in 2014, but there's another man who has taken his place, duplicating his schtick.  Essentially, Bushman hides himself by holding a huge huge bush in front of himself, and when unsuspecting people pass him, he'll spook you, with a huge \"Boo\" as he removes the bush and reveals himself.  You've been forewarned, so don't be caught off guard!\n\nGiven the homeless situation throughout SF, you're also likely to pass many homeless folks throughout the Wharf, especially in the evening.  If you're coming from the suburbs, or somewhere where homelessness is non existent, you need to be aware of this.\n\nIf you haven't heard already, car break-ins throughout SF, have been rampant in the last year.  In fact, there were over 30,000 car break-ins in 2017.  If you think I'm exaggerating, just look it up on-line!  My guess is that that number is actually under reported, as our car was broken into, and we never filed a police report.  It's just par for the course these days in the City, specifically in tourist-centric areas, like the Wharf and Lombard Street, aka the Most Crooked Street in the World.  So, lock your cars, and don't leave anything visible, including your luggage, purses, jackets, makeup bags, food, etc.  It really is that bad, and regardless of what the police say, they've had no real handle on it.  Everyone in SF is aware of this, and you need to be too!\n\nIf you've never been to the Wharf, and have some free time, it's an enjoyable place to spend some time at.  If you're up for a good walk, you can walk about a half mile to Pier 39, and then head further, about another mile to the Ferry Building, a personal favorite of mine.  Just a few of many, many things to do in the beautiful City By the Bay.", "author": "Lori N."}

Lots of restaurants, stores and places to see, but you dont have to spen a lot or shop at every store. We basically came and walked around all day, eat at a rowdy restaurant that overlooked the water, and overall had a great time. You can also see hundreds of sea lions just sleeping one on top of the other on these wooden pallets. It is the coolest thing I've seen. Great place.", "author": "Tairyn A."}

Okay, not quite, but Fisherman's Wharf is a must if visiting the city by the bay! Yes, for the most part, the wharf is still a tourist trap filled with 5 for a dollar postcard shops & 3 for a Hamilton t-shirts, but it's what you find in-between the obvious is where it's at! \n\nYou'll see & smell the best clam chowder (chow-dah) west of Boston, of course, it would be sacrilege to not eat it from a sourdough bowl! You'll see & smell the seals (RL animals in the semi-wild) that call the wharf home for part of the year. You'll discover more than Ghirardelli chocolates here, more like Ghirardelli everything - it's where it all began! You'll smell & smell the seafood market and street entertainers that always seems to be in a spunky mood! You'll be able to take a selfie at the historic crab sign and other wharf landmarks! How about visiting the 3 generations Alioto's restaurant?\n\nHave you been to Pike's Market in Seattle? It's like that, but more fisherman raw! Think Quint in Jaws! Just so much to do, but if gawking people and fish just ain't your thing head to Pier 39 just steps away aka the retail hub of the wharf! Maybe the Cannery Shopping Center, Ghirardelli Square, a Ripley's Believe it or Not museum, the Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9canique, Wax Museum at Fisherman's Wharf, the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, etc. All part of the wharf! How about jumping on a ferry to the infamous Alcatraz? Yup, you can do that too! \n\nLastly, it's easy to get to Fisherman's Wharf. Catch the historic cable car or the historic F line and it drops you off steps from the fish & crabs. The regular Muni too! If you plan to drive the street meters are insanely expensive, so I'd suggest parking in the designated lots. And no, you do not have to be Black Beard or Capt. Ahab to enjoy the wharf... the crowds, the smell of fish, heck just cherish the joys of being a land mammal... thar she blows!", "author": "Eric R."}

I would still argue that it's worth experiencing at least once just to say you have been there, but its not a place that you will likely want to visit over and over again. \n\nThere are no restaurants and coffee shops that interest me in this area and the only time that I end up here nowadays is if I am taking a long walk along the waterfront and walk past it.

Personally I'd heard of Fisherman's Wharf but wasn't quite sure what was there or what to expect.  \n\nFirst of all it is nicely located right near Ghirardelli Square, Pier 39 is down the road, but honestly I would not park and walk that far, and cable cars run right down to the wharf.  \n\nI noticed there wasn't actually much to do.  There are plenty of restaurants to eat at and a lot of food stands.  Honestly if you don't like seafood much the smell is a little overwhelming.  I found myself holding my breath a bit when walking by.  There are a lot of souvenir shops but I noticed all of the souvenir shops pretty much sell the exact same things.  It's like there is a monopoly on San Francisco souvenirs and everyone has to buy them from the same distributor.  The only thing you can do is browse for the best price because you are looking at the same things.  Also oddly no one carries plus sized clothing.  I guess because there are so many hills in San Francisco everyone is fit but hey some tourists would like a plus sized hoodie.\n\nParking is crazy.  It is very hard to find a spot even a Thursday when we were there.  We ended up finding metered parking a few blocks away but at $4.50 per hour it's high. That's basically 8 cents per minute.  That quarter isn't getting you much parking time. \n\nI don't think I'd visit again on any future visit to San Francisco.

As a tourist, it's a magical, beautiful, glorious awe-inspiring food filled paradise, albeit freezing cold and foggy and windy. But when you're on vacation and are bundled up walking along the water and ducking into seafood places, cracking into crab dipping it into butter, and breaking sourdough bread, maybe sipping on a hot drink at a local bar in front of a hot roaring fireplace, do you care if it's a wee windy or foggy? Not really, you're with your people and in one of the best cities of the world. It's got a character running deep in its veins with a gypsy like wanderlust ... who doesn't fall in love with S.F. via Fisherman's Wharf? Anyone immune to its charms isn't mortal. There's the bells of the cable cars in the distance and ice-cold ice-cream sandwiches, knick knack shops on every corner, tie dye t-shirts, the smell of pot in the air--the hippie era is alive and well thank you very much. It's love and peace all the the way. Now for my eyes as a local: It's freezing and I hate it, it's foggy so I can't see in front of me, I need to wear a hoodie to keep the cold out no matter if it's summer, the crab is overpriced and I'm gluten intolerant so forget about the glories of the bread. Also I don't drink so a bar sin't gonna do jack for me. And here the biggest doozy: the parking. There's zero parking spots on the streets and how much does it cost to park in any of the adjoining garages? It'll set you back a days worth of wages. It's obscene the cost of owning a car and god forbid, needing to park it near Fisherman's Wharf. But if you're a tourist, you'll likely not have a car and if you Uber or taxi, no worries. No matter, if you're a local or tourist, one of the joys of the wharf is the ferries, being ferried back and forth across the water is a joyous thing, experiencing the water up close, it feels like an adventure, and if you're doing it with kids, mores the better. It's not fair for me to complain about the weather because this is not the fault of the Wharf--it just is what it is, and the wharf is pretty damn all shades of awesomeness.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

New Year's Eve was bustling with plenty of both tourists, out of town folks (like us) and locals. Many souvenir shops, restaurants, and entertainment tours/activities were even open late on New Year's Eve.  \n\nOver the years I've had a chance to enjoy some of the Bay cruises: Red and White Fleet, Alcatraz Tour, Angel Island State Park Tour, Hornblower brunch cruises: the San Francisco Belle and California Hornblower, and even sailed on a boat named \"Kitty Kat\" for an eco whale watching tour. Along Fisherman's Wharf I've stopped and enjoyed some of the street performers, they come in different forms of entertainment like musical talents, acrobatics, artists, street dancers and circus-type performers. If you enjoyed the show do drop a few dollars on their collecting bins. At the Wharf there are plenty of restaurants to enjoy. Endless! \n\nAlso around this time every year around the third week of January enjoy the arrival of the sea lions. These San Francisco residents began showing up at Fisherman's Wharf area shortly after the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and they've been a fixture since. Find them on the western side of the pier. \n\nSan Francisco can be very expensive depending on what type of activities you want to do but I always enjoy breaking away from the valley (especially during hot summer months) and enjoy a day here at the Fisherman's Wharf. There's plenty of things to do in this popular San Francisco tourist spot and there's always something for everyone!\n\nReview #0636", "author": "May A."}

Fisherman's wharf is a neighborhood consisting of many tourist attractions, local businesses and the docks which house many commercial and charter fishing vessels. The boats are all well-maintained functional and very colorful. They are a joy to see. If you are into ships the Wharf houses The Maritime Museum and a fleet of historic vessels. Near the museum you can pick up a Powell & Hyde's cable car and ride to Lombard Street, Chinatown or Union Square for $7.00. \n\nThe food in Fisherman's Warf is of the charts, Great breakfast places like Eight AM and the Hollywood Caf\u00e9, Burgers, Mexican and wood fire cooked pizza at the Carmel Pizza Company.  They have Boudin, the original sourdough bread bakery, fudge and ice cream shops. \nThen as you should expect, there is the seafood. The massive catches of Dungeness crab provides fresh product to many restaurants and crab shacks like the sandwich places on Taylor Street.  Great chowders are available pier 39's Chowders and Chowder Hut on the Embarcadero.   Italian cooking influenced seafood is evident at Capurros, Pompeis and Cioppinos which features it namesack San Francisco original fish stew. All are located on Jefferson Street.\n\nThe hands down biggest edible attraction is Ghiradelli.  A must go for super fresh delicious chocolate.  They have a square on the hillside with a beautiful mermaid fountain and a lot of nice shops. Souvenirs and shopping are everywhere.  They are especially abundant on Jefferson Street and Pier 39.  And speaking of Pier 39, it is the coolest place to spend time being entertained.\n\nThere are many hotels right in Fisherman's Warf and everything is compacted so tightly that is an easy walk to most places.  It is a place where you can easily spend a week exploring but now for the cons.  It is very expensive to do just about anything.  The neighborhood is dirty and littered.

The Aquarium at PIER 39 is good for kids and Fog Harbor Fish House is a view restaurant that actually serves very good food.\n\nWarning to non-locals about parking: Meters, if you can find one and manage not to hit a meandering pedestrian, are so expensive and tickets so likely, do yourself a favor and take the MUNI F line. \n\nMeters are enforced 7 days a week until 7pm (or later) so pay attention to the signage or better yet, just don't drive. \n\nA short walk from that loud epicenter at PIER 39 is the other side of the Wharf- better classified as The Embarcadero- that houses the excellent Exploratorium and local transportation hubs like the Cruise Line Terminal, Bauer's Limousine and a smattering of expensive restaurants\n\n(though the second location of Queen's Louisiana Po' Boy restaurant, eminently affordable, will open on Pier 33 late summer 2017).\n\nThere's a section of the Wharf for different moods: Touristy and frenetic or dreamy and reminiscent.\n\nFlip a coin if you can't decide which to visit.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

Fisherman's Wharf was my first stop upon arriving in San Francisco over the holiday weekend. After such a long drive up from Big Sur I couldn't wait to experience the legendary Fisherman's Wharf and picturesque Pier 39. Unfortunately, every other tourist had the exact same idea. Traffic was a nightmare and don't even get me started on parking. On the bright side I had a loooooot of time to Google parking options in the area. \n\nPIER 39 has convenient visitor parking in the PIER 39 Garage, located directly across the street from the Entrance Plaza. The PIER 39 Garage is open 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Summer Parking Rates: Weekdays are $10/hour (maximum daily rate of $50) and weekends/holidays are $12/hour (maximum daily rate of $60). Visitors who dine at participating full-service PIER 39 restaurants receive ONE HOUR OF FREE validated parking in the PIER 39 Garage. Participating restaurants include: Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Restaurant & Market, Chart House, Crab House, Eagle Cafe, Fog Harbor Fish House, Hana Zen Japanese Grill, Hard Rock Cafe, Luigi's Pizzeria, Mango's Taqueria & Cantina, Pier Market Seafood Restaurant, Players Sports Grill & Arcade, Swiss Louis Italian & Seafood Restaurant and Wipeout Bar & Grill. Be sure to ask your server to validate your PIER 39 Garage ticket. Multiple parking validations cannot be combined. Limit one parking validation per vehicle. To avoid auto break-ins, take all valuables with you and check that your vehicle's doors and windows are locked. This is also the parking garage that fills up very very quickly so have an alternative in mind.\n\nTips:\n- Have someone in your car use Google or a parking app like SpotHero to locate the nearest, cheapest parking while you are stuck in traffic\n- Have someone in your car use the app OpenTable to make reservations at a local eatery if you do not want to waste your time and parking money waiting for a table\n- Bring a jacket or sweater since it does get windy and chilly \n- Wear comfortable walking shoes because there's a good chance you will be parking far away", "author": "Jennifer G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-19", "description": "This review is for Tourists.  Locals, if you really need to read a review of Fisherman's Wharf, you probably need to explore The City a bit more.  Yes, I know, there will be plenty 'o push back for a 5 star Fisherman's Wharf review.  Bring it.  \n\nSan Francisco isn't just the City by the Bay, it is a city built because of it's maritime geography.  Gold wasn't discovered in SF.  It just made its way down so that it could be connected with the rest of the civilized world.  The culture of The City is one that has historically been tied to the water  As a tourist, there's any number of great places to visit in San Francisco.  At least some of your time should be spent in this area because there is little else like it.  You will see beautiful views, you will see Sea Lions and Fishing Boats, you will find Bread Bowls full of Chowder.  You will find people from all over the world who may be experiencing their first visit to the United States.  You'll also find a lot of people trying to cash in on it - and this can include a lot of types.  There are no shortage of tourist traps.  But, there is a lot of good.\n\nOne thing that makes Fisherman's Wharf a no-brainer for Tourists is that there is something for everyone.  A family can come and everyone can have fun.  People of all ages can find something interesting.  And, there are so many beautiful things that you can take in.  Just be smart about it.  Don't spend your day looking for some lame t-shirt.  Never get a t-shirt on vacation.  Never.  Seriously.  And don't get junk.  Don't do that anytime.  If something is a chain, only eat at that chain if you will NEVER have an opportunity to do so at home.  I met someone who went to Bubba Gump Shrimp who lives a mile from the Mall of America in Minnesota.  What are you thinking?!?!  If you're here from another country, you can do better than Joe's Crab Shack or Applebee's, but at least it's novel.  (Great moment - Group of Texans get of a bus and a young man in his early 20's says:  \"That Applebee's is downright majestic.\" with a gleam in his eye. ... Yeah dude.  Probably the most expensive you'll ever see.) \n\nThings you SHOULD Do:\n*Learn History.  I highly recommend utilizing the fact that there is a National Historic Park here.  Hit the Visitor's Center, Maritime Museum, Hyde Pier, Boudin Museum (up stairs at Boudin), Pier 39 Historical Markers, Embarcadero Historical Walk, and the Ghirardelli Marketplace has some really cool info about chocolate making.  \n*Take in the views.  Aquatic Park has great views of The Bay, Hyde Street Pier and Alcatraz.  The section of Fishing Boats on Jefferson is great on a nice day.  Sneak in around the far side of the Crab Stands to get a different look at the boats (this is the actual Fisherman's Wharf).  There is a nice promenade from Pier 43 down to Pier 39.  And, the views from the upper-deck of Pier 39 are cool, particularly by the Sea Lion Visitor Center (great view of the GGB).\n*Have one classic Fisherman's Wharf meal.  If you are going Crab Stands do actual Crab, a Crab Sandwich or Chowder.  Crab isn't cheap, but you will likely never sit at a Crab Stand and eat Crab a second time.  Sandwich:  Sabella and LaTorre.  Soup:  Crab Chowder at Nick's Lighthouse.\n*Sit Down Meal:  Scoma's or Alioto's\n*Go to a bar and talk to tourists.  Gold Dust is great and has a storied past (albeit at a different location).  Buena Vista is the home of Irish Coffee in the US.  Castagnola's has really fun live music, especially when Paul is playing.  Jack's has tons of beer to try and also live music.\n*Musee Mechanique.  I will say no more, but you're welcome in advance.\n*Two local street acts:  Bushman and old time magician Jerry Roy Salazar.\n*See the bread made at Boudin.\n*If you want to hit one shop:  Frank's Fisherman.\n*If you are going to get something SF to wear:  San Francisco Giants cap.  Instant Baller.\n\nThings you Should NOT Do:\n*Buy a T-shirt or any lame trinket.  Teach your kids now.  Quality.\n*Be hard-sold.  There are some hard sellers.  Don't do it!\n*Eat at a chain or at Pier 39.  This would be like going to the Louvre and looking at Dogs Playing Poker.  You're in SF.  Use Yelp wisely.  Reach out to an Elite - we'll tell you what's up.\n*Avoid any place with an employee in a bad mood.  If you're at a place with a service industry person in a bad mood, that place sucks.  A lot.  And, feel free not to tip those folks. \n*Give money to anyone.  Trust me.  It's not heartless.  People come to Fisherman's Wharf to pray on gullible tourists.  Also don't feed Seagulls.  \n*Walk five-wide on a sidewalk.  And, don't do that any other place either, tourists.  Some of us have some place to be.  Also, you don't get 5 minutes to frame your photo on a busy sidewalk.  More than five seconds, I'm photo-bombing you.  And also, if you're in line for 10 minutes at In-and-Out, could you know what you want?  There are like three things on the menu.\n*Bad VPL.  Seems alarmingly prevalent.\n*Dodgers Gear.  Sad  :(", "author": "Adam S."}

The entire Embarcadero area is a must visit for any tourists and visitors of the Bay Area. There are many great opportunities for photos of the San Francisco Bay, great seafood restaurants and plenty of souvenir shops to roam around in. I can't begin to tell you how many restaurants and gift shops there are here. For dining, you can't go wrong with Fog Harbor Fish House, Crab House at Pier 39 or La Mar Cebicher\u00eda Peruana. If you're seeking a seafood snack, stop by Chowders for some ... well ... chowder! In addition, there's an In-N-Out within the area and towards the end is Ghirardelli Square for all you chocolate lovers. \n\nIf you plan on roaming around the wharf for a long period of time, don't forget to bring those comfy shoes/sneakers because there's plenty of real estate to cover! Also, be prepared for the wind sometimes by bringing a long sleeve shirt or something to put over your short-sleeve tee. One final note, if you decide to drive here and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for parking, skip the parking garages and look for street parking. Every time I've been here, there were always plenty of metered spots nearby.", "author": "Chris E."}

First of all surrounding parking lots were charging $60 flat rate. So many people were taking pictures of the rates because it was so outrageous. But we knew we didn't have a choice because we saw another lot charging $100. \n\nBesides the weather being cold and windy.....there are way too many people. All the restaurants were jam packed. The fireworks were supposed to start at 7pm. But they didn't start until about 9:30. We were cold so decided to huddle up in a restaurant.....any restaurant. It seemed every restaurant we went into were super crowded, with no seating and no service. We even went inside Starbucks to use their facility and they required a receipt. We didn't mind buying anything except the line to buy a drink was about an hour's wait. \n\nIt took forever for the fireworks to start. When it did start, we couldn't see the fireworks that well because it was super foggy. We decided to leave about 15 mins early before the crowd because we knew the traffic getting out of the area would be a nightmare.  WE FAILED.  It took us another 2 hours to finally get out of the parking lot, the streets which most of them were closed off, and going around thousands of people walking in the streets holding up traffic.\n\nOverall the fisherman's wharf is a fun place to visit during non-holidays (although Pier 39 has better attractions and restaurants). Please stay away from here unless you live within walking distance during the holidays.", "author": "Sharr K."}

The first day, an early Friday morning, the place seemed calm and serene. We were able to walk the wharf and wander at a leisurely pace. We stopped to see the sea lions on Pier 39 and had a wonderful view of them. It was an amazing experience to see and hear them barking. Honestly, this was the best part of Fisherman's Wharf. As the morning turned into afternoon, it started to get busier and became crowded. This was when we decided to leave and come back the next day. \n\nThe second visit, a Saturday early afternoon, the place was packed. It was crazy busy - barely any room to walk, hard to navigate from shop to shop, and incredibly loud. We went to see the sea lions again and it was hard to find a space to stand. We didn't stay long as the crowds were overwhelming.\n\nOverall, the best experience was the sea lions and I would highly recommend seeing them. I would recommend going early in the morning, preferably on a weekday, in order to avoid the crowds. The crowds really start to show up after lunch time and seem to be a constant on weekends.", "author": "Nicole B."}

It is a hood that most San Franciscans avoid and is home to some the most popular businesses in the city. My two cents? Come by and bask in the tourist aura, reserve your judgements until the experience is fully embraced.\n\nWhile it was established as far back as the Gold Rush era for commercial fishing, it still very much remains a spot where fishermen and their ships work today. The oodles of seafood caught from this part of town are still put on display and sold to anyone who is willing to buy some locally caught fare. Leave the fishing rod at home though, no one without a permit is dipping their hooks into the water anytime soon.\n\nUnderstandably, there are cheesy chain restaurants, expensive ventures for the kids and family, and more people crammed into one area than all of the rest of the city. There will be lots of distractions, gimmicky souvenirs to be sold, but that's not to say it's all a bad time. Here's why:\n\n* It is home to the only In-N-Out Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz/in-n-out-burger-san-francisco) in SF proper. It's by no means the best In-N-Out, but if you can't head to Millbrae or Daly City for a vastly superior version, then this will just have to do.\n\n* Enjoy watching some of the sea life and an incredible, brisky view from Pier 39. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pier-39-san-francisco). One can catch some serious views of the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and the rest of the SF skyline.\n\n* If there is one venue to hit up in FIsherman's Wharf, it's the Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9canique. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/mus%C3%A9e-m%C3%A9canique-san-francisco-4) Unless you've been there 10x, it is a fun place to visit and peruse. It's even better with kids.\n\n* Hit up the dungeness crab and other chowder stands (http://www.yelp.com/biz/fishermans-wharf-chowder-and-crab-sidewalk-stands-san-francisco) along the sidewalk if *you must* but know that the Codmother (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-codmother-fish-and-chips-san-francisco) is your best bet for a quality seafood experience.", "author": "Jando S."}

Sure, you don't get the whole sit down & service deal, but I'm willing to sacrifice all of that for some fresh seafood. Plus, they give you HUGE portions. Definitely go if you are a seafood fanatic! Note: there is A LOT of people there.\n\nSightseeing:\nBesides the whole Pier 39 thing, there are a lot of cute little stores a little farther from that. For example, there's a really cool hot sauce place called Hot Licks. This place sells ALL SORTS of different hot sauces/salsa.

I know, it seems kind of counter-intuitive to do so, but you won't regret it.\n\nBlah blah blah, chowder in a bread bowl, blah blah blah. I prefer the In-n-Out actually. Heh.

Shops are interesting here and food is good. The pier contains a ton of seafood restauraunts- keep in mind it's on water so it makes sense. It's two stories so be sure to walk upstairs as well to check out the shops. They do two staircases that play piano sounds as you go up. People always get a kick out of it. Towards the end of the pier you will find a merry go round + magic show for kids and towards the left you'll find sea lions! It's a bit expensive here in the pier so download their coupon book. Do try fog harbor and bubba gump if you have time. Trish's doughnut is amazing as well. I am in love with their sports store so check it out. Also do check out their chocolate store you will be amazed with what you find! Try to come during the holidays when the huge Christmas tree is up. Street parking can be tricky, but parking garage can be expensive to read carefully before you park. I normally take public transportation here and just walk. Everything is walking distance. Keep in mind it's a touristy spot so be patient where ever you go. I definitely recommend everyone to come here at least once. There's no place like this.

Everywhere you go there are tons of people walking, eating, shopping, enjoying the street shows, and other activities. On one end you have the popular Pier 39 and on the other end are restaurants and various stations of people selling crab or shrimp sandwiches. You can even buy whole crabs to eat or take home. In between you have many gift shops where you can buy souvenirs, schedule to take a tour of San Francisco by bus, bike, or little compact cars, various restaurants to grab a bite, and other activities you can do. \n\nParking can be a real hassle here. There is a parking structure right across the street from Pier 39, but costs can definitely add up if you stay the whole day.

It's located along the city's northeastern waterfront, facing Alcatraz Island and the bay.  It consists of a collection of shops, restaurants, and other attractions such as a wax museum and a Ripley's Believe it or Not museum.\n\nThe big Fisherman's Wharf sign is located at the corner of Taylor St. and Jefferson St.\n\nThe restaurants in Fisherman's Wharf run the gamut from casual outdoor food stands like Sabella & La Torre (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sabella-and-la-torre-san-francisco) to fine dining like the floating Forbes Island restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/biz/forbes-island-san-francisco).  Gary Danko plans to open a restaurant in Fisherman's Wharf, not far from his nearby original restaurant in Russian Hill.  Fresh seafood is sold here and clam chowder in sourdough bread bowls are very popular (for good reason -- they're delicious).\n\nSeagulls are ALL over the place, especially at the pier, because despite what the signs say, people still feed them.  Leftover bread is often fed to the seagulls.  It's hilarious to watch people bring food to the pier and try to eat in peace while the seagulls stalk and harass them.  I've seen flocks of seagulls aggressively attack unattended bread bowls.  It is a sight to see and causes an entertaining commotion.\n\nA lot of retailers are gift shops and souvenir shops selling random merchandise and knickknacks.  If you're shopping for gifts of souvenirs, you can typically find the same or comparable items for less at a local Walgreens.\n\nThe pier is nice because it provides excellent views of the bay, including Alcatraz and both the Golden Gate Bridge and Bay Bridge.  It's also fun to check out the sea lions gather at Pier 39.\n\nThere are homeless people, the most \"famous\" one being the Bushman.  He sits on the sidewalk, hiding behind a bush, and jump-scares unsuspecting passersby.  I first noticed him when I was across the street and heard screaming.  There are videos of him on YouTube and he even has his own Yelp page: http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-bush-man-san-francisco.", "author": "Daniel B."}

They have some souvenir shops for the Golden Gate bridge, too. \n\nParking is the worst part in San Francisco.  Luckily for tourists, there is a Pier 39 validated parking structure (but it's still really bad).  You can park anywhere in the 5-floored structure for a free first hour if you leave before 6 pm  or free first two hours if you leave after 6 pm.  The catch is that you have to have it validated at a place listed on the back of the parking ticket.

Fisherman's Wharf is a huge tourist attraction in San Francisco, featuring specialty shops, restaurants, and entertainment. \n\nThere were no people around during our visit, thankfully, (as I very much dislike crowds) because it was too early for the stores/restaurants to be open. However, I can only imagine how insane the crowds of tourists would be during late morning or afternoon! Fisherman's Wharf is definitely not a place I would want to be anywhere near during these times. \n\nMy mother and I enjoyed a relaxing and quiet stroll throughout the Fisherman's Wharf area and along the waterfront which was nice, but despite that, Fisherman's Wharf would not be a place that I would feel a desire to return to for a second visit. Initially, we did not specifically plan to or intend on visiting Fisherman's Wharf, however, we just happened to be in the area while riding the cable cars and decided to briefly check it out.  \n\nFor me personally, Fisherman's Wharf was disappointing. My expectations were low to begin with and they were not exceeded. The streets along the Bay as well as Pier 39 were very commercialized and were lined with tonnes of specialized souvenir shops, American chain stores and mediocre restaurants catering to tourists and selling overpriced goods. It felt like a miniature Las Vegas. \n\nFisherman's Wharf is an overrun tourist trap and was not worth the visit for myself and I would not return for a second visit. There are so many more unique things to do and interesting neighbourhoods with character to explore in San Francisco, that offer a far better experience, in my opinion.

While always portrayed as a very touristy attraction, this bustling seaside area is fun and exercises all the senses.  \n\nWalking down the main street provides a colorful view of souvenir shops, acrobatic performers, spray paint artists, seafood vendors, and restaurants.  On the far end is Boudin, complete with a sourdough workshop and store.  Nearby there is an avenue dedicated to shopping with some restaurants, complete with a Hard Rock Cafe. Piers stretching into the ocean allow even closer observation of the many sea lions that live in the area.  Crab vendors and saltwater taffy stores jostle for attention side by side, there is a battleship and accompanying maritime museum parked nearby, and the chime of the cable car rings in the distance.  Bigger stores dominate the other end of the wharf, and further on lies Ghiradelli square and a variety of parks and green spaces. \n\nAs is true universally in SF, parking is a hassle.  There is a garage nearby but it's pricey, though not so bad if you are only visiting for a day.\n\nGiven the press of the crowds, I try to spend some time exploring the side streets, particularly for restaurants.  Scoma's and Carmel Pizza Company are examples of some gems found slightly off the beaten track.  \n\nFor an invigorating sea breeze and a quick fix of San Francisco, there is no better place to be.", "author": "Emily Y."}

There are plenty of shops, food stands, and restaurants. One of the touristy things to do is eat clam chowder in a bread bowl. I thought it was amazing the first time I tried it. It lost its luster the second time I visited the wharf and ate it. I did not even try to seek it out the third time. If you have never tried it, I would still recommend it since it is part of the full tourist experience. If you enjoy short boat rides, I also recommend taken one from the wharf that circle around the bay. It takes approximately 40 minutes and costs about $30. The boat will pass right by Alcatraz then swing to and under the Golden Gate Bridge before returning to the wharf. I enjoyed getting up close to Alcatraz to see it from the outside and feeling the sea breeze during the cruise. I definitely enjoyed the experience once but there are so many other things to do in the city that I would not do it again. Another fun spot in the wharf is Ghirardelli Square. Of course, they are known for their chocolate. Their ice cream is also very good here. As a warning, parking is very expensive in the wharf. If you do not mind walking, park away from it on the street and take a walk. I took a look at the map and choose a random area west of Lombard Street and walked 20 minutes to the wharf.\n\nIf you are visiting San Francisco and looking for recommendations, feel free to message me through Yelp and I can share my itinerary, which includes my Yelp reviews.

Then you can decide for yourself if it warrants a second visit. In addition to being a hub for local flavor there is also some history in Fisherman's Wharf. Here are a few thoughts on what to do, where to shop, what to eat and some lodging options. \n\nWhat is there to do?\nIn addition to being a hub for local flavor there is also some history in Fisherman's Wharf.  Given that, I do think Fisherman's Wharf has its place on a San Francisco itinerary.  Foodies will appreciate checking out the crab stands and sourdough bread at Boudin.  History buffs will like the ships dotted along Hyde Street Pier.  Patriots and military buffs alike can tour the USS Pampanito and USS Jeremiah O'Brien.  Kids and adults may have fun checking out vintage coin-operated machines at Musee Mecanique.  This is also a good launching point for bicycling across the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nSo many shops, so little time . . .\nWell, unless you are looking for junky tourist stuff you can skip most of the shops.  One that seems better than the others is Wharf Central in The Cannery.  They have some nice books about the area and carry some better brands like Roxy and Columbia.  \n\nWhat should I eat? \nOf course in addition to the attractions in Fisherman's Wharf there are tons of places to eat.  If you're not adventurous then this is where you find chains.  But if you are reading this review, I have to assume that you're willing to try some local eateries.  Blue Mermaid Chowder House and Bar instantly comes to mind.  \n\nLodging in Fishmerman's Wharf?\nOn at least a few of my trips to SF I have stayed in San Francisco.  I like both the Argonaut and The Tuscan.  The reason I like staying in this area is because there are grocery stores and drug stores close by so you can grab a soda or snacks for your hotel room.  Also, staying in Fisherman's Wharf is convenient to transportation like the Powell and Hyde Cable Car Line, the Powell and Mason Cable Car Line and the F-Street Street Car Line. \n\nBottom Line: Fisherman Wharf offers a lot more than crowds and junk shops.  http://visitfishermanswharf.com/", "author": "Courtney K."}

Guardino's at the corner of Jefferson & Taylor has the best dungeness crab and clam chowder, and they even sell their soup in a can.  The hoard of seal lions that can usually be seen on the floating wooden pallets west of Pier 39 is definitely a sight to see.  I'm not sure as to when they're there or not as I've experienced two scenarios - a sole lion plopped into the ocean as soon as we got there, leaving the place deserted, and another time when it was 100% occupancy with noisy barking and stinky air.

The Wharf doesn't have access to BART, and to get there and back, you have to take the F bus line.\n\nIf you must see the Wharf you can also stop by Lombard Street, Ghirardelli Square and even walk to the Palace of the Fine Arts/The Golden Gate Bridge viewing area (it is a 2 mile walk, just to be warned) to have a whole day filled with tourist activities. After that I suggest going to see the real SF and all it has to offer.", "author": "Courtney D."}

There's plenty of restaurants and food stands that sell seafood (lots of fried options, also their signature clam chowder in bread bowls) that are slightly on the high side in terms of price. I was also underwhelmed by their shops, which seem to cater to tourists sell either cheap trinkets or expensive crafts. They have the Mus\u00e9e M\u00e9canique, which is a museum with old fashioned arcade games which I thought was fun to go through. Out on the piers and the main street, I was probably approached 5-6 times whether I wanted to go on an Alcatraz cruise, so that got old after awhile.

Around the area, you might find some cheap t-shirts and cheesy souvenirs for sale, very cheap and of dubious quality, but around Fisherman's Wharf, that's when you start paying like $10 for a portion of Dungeness crab or $8 for a bowl of clam chowder, though they are delicious.", "author": "Jerry I."}

But let me give you a few extra details. \n\nStart at the Aquarium on Pier 39 and make your way to Pier 43. You'll hit many food places and shopping places along the way.

There are cute shops, small restaurants, fresh seafood and a beautiful view of the ocean.  You get to see amazing views of Alcatraz Island, you can see the Golden Gate on one side and the Bay Bridge on the other.  Definitely visit Pier 39 and watch the sea lions- you can get lost in that for hours, especially if you aren't used to seeing them.  Ghirardelli is also right within walking distance and a cool site to see.  Obviously with any touristy site like this, it can get crowed and overwhelming, parking will be expensive, street performers are looking for money and the you will cross the occasional homeless person.  However, if you go in knowing it's a tourist trap and set the expectation right, then I highly recommend it for anyone visiting the city for the first time.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

As soon as we arrived, the smell of seafood and salt water filled my senses and at that point I wanted to dive into a nice warm clam chowder bread bowl. There were so many food vendors to choose from at the wharf which was great. However, the food was pricey especially since most of the dining restaurants offer and sell mainly seafood.

Did you know a male sea lion can grow up to 800 lbs?! Although they are loud (picture a massive dog bark), and a little stinky, they are definitely a sight to see!  Also, on the same pier 39, you can see Alcatraz very clearly.  Great place for a photo opp. \n\n  2. The chowder!  Who doesn't like a good clam chowder served in a delicious sourdough bowl. No one, I know. The Wharf offers many restaurants, from casual to elegant, where you can \"get your seafood dine on.\"  \n\n 3. The aquarium! Even though I live in LA, I don't spend a lot of time in the ocean, checking out the wildlife.  As such, I love going to the aquarium.  The aquarium on the Wharf is great, not too big and fill of fun sea life. \n\nFinal note- make sure you take a coat if it is cloudy.  Near the water gets really chilly!  This is also a major tourist spot, so maybe plan your visit on off hours to avoid the massive rush.  If Pier 39 is too crowded, head in either direction and you will run into additional piers, all equipped with restaurants and shops.", "author": "Taylor W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-13", "description": "I love coming here to shop and eat!  Sometimes my boyfriend and I go here on some of our many travels.  It is a favorite spot of mine.  The shops can be fun to explore even the tourist shops.  I have found a few good deals on sweatshirts and jackets at some of these shops.  But, I have to admit some of the tourist shops are tourist traps as well.  Some of the clerks at these shops can be pushy and aggressive when coaxing customers to purchase merchandise from their store.  I have learned to avoid the stores with the worse aggressive clerks in them.  \n\nAnyhow, there are some unique and fun shops to explore.  I  especially love to shop at Rainforest Cafe (as well as eat there). Nearby is a huge two-story Ross that I absolutely love, it is one of my favorite Ross stores to shop at with a Cost Plus nearby.  Although, my favorite unique shops are in Pier 39 that include a store that sells items for Left handed people (my boyfriend and I are both left handed), an Irish clothing store,  a fairy themed store (although their Mountain t-shirts are over priced), Hard Rock Cafe gift shop (but I also like to eat there as well) and more.  \n\nThere are many great places to eat here.  As I mentioned, I like to eat at Rainforest Cafe and Hard Rock Cafe. But there also is Crab Shack and Wipe Out to name a few more.  Someday I hope to eat at the Bubba Gump's restaurant there.  I have been to the Bubba Gump's in Cannery Row and thought it was pretty good, but to be honest not great.  Still, I have heard the view from the restaurant in San Francisco is breathtaking!\n\nThere are a few things that I do not like about Fisherman's Wharf.  As I mentioned, there are some aggressive clerks at a few of the shops that try to push customers to purchase items from the store.  I prefer to decide for myself what I want to buy and if I think they are charging too much for a particular item, I will not pay for it.  If they are willing to bargain, I may consider, however.  \n\nSecond, there are a lot of homeless people who hang out at the wharf.  Some of them can be aggressive in trying to get money from tourists.  At one time when my boyfriend and I were walking down the wharf, I saw a man who covered himself with a fake tree bush and would jump out of it to scare people who walk by.  Also, you have to watch where you walk or ride a bike as homeless are often sitting and sleeping directly on the sidewalks.  I am sure there are not too many places for homeless to stay in San Francisco and they would prefer for be where most of the tourists are in hopes that there will be some that will be generous to give them money.  \n\nBut  it is the aggressive ones that scare me.  I have also read a few months ago, that this is a serious issue.  I am not the only one who does not like to being harassed to give money away, many others who come to San Francisco to shop, eat and explore feel the same way.  I sympathize with the homeless but I want to not have someone aggressively coming up to me asking for money.  Anyhow, I do not travel with much cash especially since it is not safe, wallets and purses can get stolen.  I also prefer to give to charities.  \n \n I have heard that recently there is this unusual homeless man who has been hanging out there who dresses up in an Elmo costume (Elmo is a licensed character of Henson Co. and is used in Sesame Street).  Anyhow, this homeless man swears all the time and is just very negative even with children present.  And, then he still expects people to give him money!\n\nPros:\n-there is so many things to do here - lots of shops, restaurants, museums and attractions\n\nCons:\n-some of the clerks at the tourist shops can be pushy & aggressive\n-there are a few tourist traps to avoid \n-many homeless people on the sidewalks and some can be aggressive\n-parking can be costly unless you are lucky to find some of the few free parking spots a few blocks up", "author": "Irene S."}

Through the little coin arcade that reminds me of the carnival scene from the movie Big.  I half expected the fortune teller machine to grant me a wish.  We walked past the ships, the shops, the restaurants.  Yet it never felt as though we were walking - there was so much to see!  Writing this makes me reminisce about how it felt to be there - the cold, brisk ocean breeze, the smell of salt from the water.  The smell of clam chowder and seafood.  It's enough to make me want to book a flight out tomorrow. \n\nI have been to San Francisco and the wharf numerous times with family and friends. My most recent trip was the most magical experience, vacationing with my fiance, showing him the sights and watching him awestruck by the views.

Why you may ask? in case you decide to throw a tv out the window with one of your wild parties. \n\nDon't go whining about how expensive everything is because YOU were the one who decided to go there in the first place.

Excellent Italian food, some what pricey, but worth it.\n\nMamita's Mexican Restaurant.

Don't look for a public restroom there are 2 in the neighborhood. one near Fisherman's Grotto, and one near Ghiradelli Square. That's it! oh wait there is one more that keeps odd hours. Don't go into hotels or restaurants asking if you can use theirs as most likely the answer is no. \n\nThere is a half way decent view of Alcatraz from the shore line, but...if you actually want to do Alcatraz, book it before you arrive because it is sold out most of the year.\n\n\nif you come to San Francisco make sure to get out of the area.

Lots of souvenir shops with San Francisco logo clothing- shop around before you settle on spending some money. There's a suede/leather store with inexpensive jackets.

There was a free magic show geared towards kids, and plenty of restaurants and shops to keep you busy. Pier 39 had a space dedicated to sea lions so it was exceptionally fun to watch them basking in the sun and barking at each other. This is a great place to get a variety of tickets to Alcatraz or ferry to the Golden Gate bridge and around Alcatraz. There was some kind of vintage looking train that was cruising up and down the Wharf that could be fun. This was obviously a great place for seafood hence being at a Wharf and other members in my group seemed to enjoy some clam chowder, shrimp pesto pasta, and fish and chips. \n\nAs a vegan it was not too difficult to find an option. While everybody else was chowing on sea critters i was able to enjoy a penne pasta with tomato sauce, veggies, and a superb glass of vino. Fun place, lots of options, and super touristy but that goes without saying. If you're a tourist and want to chow on sea food, tour Alcatraz, or take a ferry under the Golden Gate then this is the place for you.", "author": "Hollie W."}

I didn't really see anything exciting here other than too many tourists, most of whom are from abroad.  It's a great experience for them, but it was too congested, and had too many cliche gift shops.  There are more exciting parts of the city to visit, although parking in general is difficult.\n\nNote about street parking - it's $3.00 an hour, 2 hour maximum, but they do take credit cards, and go in 5 minute increments ($0.25 per 5 minutes).  Public parking in lots is around the same price, with a $25-40 max per day.", "author": "Paul K."}

The bay, the statue of Gandhi, the tchotchke shops, the restaurants, the colorful locals, the huge Christmas tree, the view of Alcatraz. It just felt like we were having the most iconic day. I wish I could say more, but it's been a few years now. All I know is that whenever I think of my trip there, when I don't think of the outstanding wine country tour we took (which left from Fisherman's Wharf), I think of the Wharf itself.\n\nThat said - the place that does bus tours out of the wharf that's right across from that big seafood place? Use them. When I told our concierge we wanted to go on a wine tour but didn't want to rent a car to drive up there ourselves for reasons of imbibing and not being from the west coast, she set us up with this company. All I know is that we had a bus driver pick us up, drive us there, and bring us back, all the while providing commentary that was both hilarious and informative.

We bought souvenirs here since there were tons of small shops with gift items which drove costs down versus buying these items at the hotel that we stayed at or the airport. The only restaurants places that I can vouch for in this area was the Boudin Bakery (delish!), Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. (Okay, not stellar - great view though),  and Ghirardelli's (although we just got desert here). There's an old arcade at Pier 42 I think it was as well as a couple of old ships that you can tour for a small fee.

You get to detox your demons from the weekend while also enjoying the bustling tourist scene.   While huffing and puffing away, you feel superior to the tourists both athletically (all kinds of gasps and exclamations can be heard in passing about how many \"joggers\" there are in San Francisco) and fashionably, as chances are that you are more stylish in your Lululemon running gear than 99.9 % of those SF sweatshirt-sporting tourists.  \n\nYou will catch the finest sunset EVER on the top of Ft. Mason with GG Bridge as backdrop starting at Marina Green.  If you do an out and back, the return incline on that hill will kick your butt in the most rewarding way.  \n\nThe Monday night Wharf running strip offers more live music, from the blues tunes blaring from the restaurants to the banjo playing street musicians, than the entire 26.2 mile length of the Nike Women's Marathon course.  I don't think I remember mimes, spray can artists, or the latest addition to the wharf scene- a four-man steel drum band playing Bob Marley covers, on that over-rated Nike course either.    \n\nIf you are to add this run to your route repertoire, I issue this caution: there is no longer A lone BUSHMAN; there are now TWO BUSHMEN on the fisherman's wharf strip.  Watching everyone's reactions from yelling, to laughing to freaking out, as well as contemplating the devastation and destruction that would occur if bushman #1 one confronted bushman #2 for taking over his turf, is pretty amusing and will keep your mind busy on your last leg. \n\nThe Wharf is THE place to be on a Monday night, guaranteed.", "author": "Kerrie T."}

If you grab a bread bowl of clam chowder at one of the stands, there's not much seating (ie - you can sit along the pier but there isn't formal seating) and it costs about $6-7/bowl.  At Boudin, it's more expensive at $8.95 but there is designated seating if you don't want the hassle of finding a place to sit. \nWalking along the Wharf is fun the first time because of the novelty and the bustling tourists but I guess I've been here too many times to appreciate it like I used to.", "author": "Tanya N."}

This was my 2nd trip here and this time we brought our son along since he is old enough (6 years old).  The views you can get of the bay, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, and San Francisco is phenomenal.  We took some great photos just from walking the piers at Fisherman's Wharf.  There are always some sea lions to look at and watch them play together.  There is a bush man who hides and waits to scare people.  The food here is just amazing.  They also have some really nice shops, people selling art, additional attractions like the wax museum, and the Ghiradeli chocolate factory.  From here you can go on boat tours to Alcatraz, or cruise under the Golden Gate Bridge.  There are small faster boats, and large comfortable boats to take tours on.  So many fun things to do here, we spent one entire day here finding all the things we could do.  Driving anywhere in SF is not fun, but be warned if you take a Trolly car you may have to wait in a long line to leave depending on the time you choose to head out.  Really nothing bad to say about this place, it's an obvious tourist attraction, but it's nothing like anything we have in Las Vegas so it's a lot of fun to experience everything the place has to offer.", "author": "Jesse C."}

On the flip side, like Times Square it's a recognizable part of city, is fun to walk around and people watch, and is full of a rich history. Unlike Times Square though the prices aren't as outrageous and there's a few things of substantial value to check out. Besides the view and the people watching I loved MUNI's historic F line, Musee Mechanique, and this one spray paint artist on the street doing amazing works of art in the matter of minutes and selling them for as little as $10. If you're into sourdough bread then Boudin is here and if you like steamed crabs then Fisherman's Wharf is still great for that as well, otherwise the wharf isn't the best eating destination in the city.", "author": "Matt E."}

We grabbed some sourdough while we were there from one of the nearby bakeries (I think it was Boudin?) that was pretty good.

If that makes sense.\n\nWhen I first came to San Francisco, my hotel was literally a block away from here. The minute I got settled in my room I walked down here and grabbed myself a bowl (made of sourdough) of clam chowder. Sitting on the wharf slowly eating my boiling hot chowder while watching the scenery all around. Perfect way to begin an experience in SF if you ask me. \n\nIt's practically the real center of the city in some ways. You can see the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Angel Island, Treasure Island, Sausalito and Oakland all from pretty much anywhere on the Wharf if you look over the bay. Look into the city and you can see pretty much the whole entire city (almost literally, it's built on a million hills). There's the Piers, each of which serve a unique function. Ghirardelli Square is only blocks away, and the Powell-Mason cable car line is underneath that. There's the F-Line Streetcar which takes you to the Embarcadero and Market Street. It's also in walking distance to Lombard (but that's up very steep hills so you might as well just take a bus or cable car to that). \n\nThere's also a vibrant street life in this area. You see all kinds of tourists and then there's the locals. You have street performers, burnt out hippies, activists and people involved in the fishing industry among many others. Sometimes you just need to take a stroll in this area in order to be entertained. \n\nMy hotel in particular (Holiday Inn Express) sucked, but I am so happy that I stayed on the wharf for my first time in San Francisco.

We had been planning a trip through San Fran for years.  We got a overpriced hotel close to fishermans ward so we could walk around the tourist spots easily.  On the first day we were headed to pier 39 and the first thing we see is a guy with a ponytail on rollerblades with no clothes on.  My kids saw his private parts.  I think they are still in shock.  Not too much further into our day a couple more naked guys were just hanging out.  We saw a policeman and told them about it and they said welcome to San Fran.  They said it was against the law to be naked in public but they didn't enforce it.  We decided to be more vigilant and try and shield our young daughter from being exposed to older naked men.  As we proceeded to down the street we were approached over and over and over avian by homeless people, who were pretty aggressive seeking money.  During this adventure we smelled marijuana smoke the entire day, all over.  Needless to say, we didn't stay 4 days I. San Fran.  We didn't even stay the night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-02", "description": "The Wharf is the only place in the City where San Francisco's legendary bay meets the land, in a spot where people can get up close to its post card beauty, without having to have port clearance (and still have the view blocked by another pier).  Sure, there are a lot of places to get down to the Bay, but the Bay off the Marina isn't quite the same; and that beyond the Bay Bridge is almost a different bay, it certainly isn't the same San Francisco.  I've always gone to parts of the Whaf, especially the area around Aquatic Park.  \n\nAs I've told legions of tourists, when warning them away from the restaurants, it's not that the food is bad--it's just that at the prices you pay, you could eat at the City's finest restaurants, but the Wharf food is as mediocre as any in the Four Corners.  Still, a freshly boiled crab is about as simple as great food gets.  Add a loaf of Boudin's Sourdough , some cheese and wine from Trader Joes, and you've got San Francisco in a bag.  The thing to do, is what too many tourists fail to do...WALK AWAY FROM THE PARKING LOT!!! There's a killer view less than a block from the crab pots, and the tourists are all eating their gooey chowders on the curb amidst the cars, buses and fumes.  The Boudin Museum is worth the money, a great way to learn about San Francisco, sour dough, and there's a bread tasting at the end, and right after that, another nice little restaurant bar.\n\nIn any case, I've never had a bad drink in the Wharf.  It's a thing about this city, the food can be crap, but the bartenders seem to know what to do about it.  I love the bars, upstairs especially, at Fisherman's Grotto.  Old dark wood-like plaster ambience.  The oyster bar at the newest version of the Eagle Cafe is a nice place to sit for oysters and cocktails, and I've had nice appetizers there as well.  \n\nFor atmosphere, I like to walk out on the piers.  There are no \"Keep Out\" signs, and you can go quite a ways off the streets, among the fishing boats, and out on Pier 45, and if you're up early, you can see the fish come in.\n\nThe Maritime Museum is closed for another year, but that was always one of my favorite buildings in the City, and the fact it held a great little maritime museum, full of ship models and local history, only made it better.  Hopefully, given they are spending so much money, and actually planning it as a museum (as opposed to stuffing one into a bath house) it will be so much better this next time around.  And then, of course even with its decay, the Municipal Pier is a delight.  What better place to stroll hand in hand, steal a kiss, or even get more involved, on a high backed concrete bench, than there?  The City glimmers in icy detachment so close you can almost touch it, the lights of the bay seem so remote, and in the distance, that Bridge...  the moon...  the stars...\n\nIf the food were better, if there was more a feeling of neighborhood, instead of selfish greed on the part of the merchants; if the buildings were closer to architecture, or at least something like a local vernacular, instead of a strip mall expediency plastered with some of the biggest names in the City; if more of the Wharf had the spirit the view  suggests, even demands; I'd give it four or five stars.  I give it three (instead of two) because the \"F\"line goes there, and brings the locals who might someday force a change for the better.  All that said, the locals who avoid the Wharf are little more than fools, no different than the tourists who eat their food on the curb.", "author": "Paul T."}

It's true, that while it has become a corporate playground designed to wring every last penny from hapless tourists who think they are having a genuine San Francisco experience there's still a little Old San Francisco under the shiny patina of Boudin and Hooters. It's mostly the smell of fish but at least that's authentic San Francisco.  I like to imagine it as it was a hundred years ago when it's streets were teeming with drunken seamen (tee hee) and syphilitic prostitutes.

I'm talking hours of free entertainment. Hours. Despite the reputation San Francisco has earned as being full of freaks, you'd be hard pressed to find a more bizarre and surreal environment as the present day Fisherman's wharf. Where there were once grizzled fisherman there are now Germans hunched over steaming Sourdough bowls full of clam chowder. The syphilitic prostitutes replaced by non-ironically mulleted children wearing \"Git 'er done!\" t-shirts and packs of silver clad statue dudes. Once the center of the seafood market in San Francisco, one can now readily purchase Alcatraz psych ward sweatshirts, (how insensitive, REALLY!) $5 carmel apples and, on my most recent visit, I spied a pair of pink hot pants with \"I have the pussy, I make the rules,\" written on the ass.

There were giant talking shrimp, beckoning you to come eat them, a lady belted out her fleece vest 2-for-1 at more than one crosswalk crossing, and it is sort of both sparsely populated, and dense with people.  But, walking through there was a good reminder that next time I'm visiting somewhere, hopefully far away, I'll remember to steer out of these places and find the real amazing things that lurk outside of all the false novelties.", "author": "Kathryn M."}

The wharf is still a working fishing port with drag boats, herring gill netters, salmon trollers and long liners. Check out the boats. The wooden ones with a beautiful clipper type flared bows are called Montereys. They were  made by Italian immigrants and had their roots in Mediterranean hull designs. Some of them were built 80 years ago and still earn a living. Fish are still unloaded at pier 45, often early in the morning while you sleep. Many fishermen who have departed the wharf never returned, long before the dangers of commercial fishing became glorified on the Discovery Channel. One incident is burned into my mind. A wharf based boat full of albacore tuna was sinking off Half Moon Bay in a storm during the 1960s. It was  beyond the reach of Coast Guard helicopters and could not stay afloat long enough to be reached by other boats. They had no life raft. The crew radioed that they were closing the doors and \"going down with the ship\". With all the bloody tuna aboard they knew they would be shark food if they tried to stay afloat in life jackets. The bodies and the boat were never found. In 1986 the wharf based drag boat Jack Jr. was run down by a tanker off Pt Reyes with the loss of the entire crew. In that tragedy, the skipper's last words, captured in an emergency radio transmission later replayed on news broadcasts, were, \"Oh, my God, you're going to hit us!\" The tanker kept right on going and never even stopped or searched for survivors. The captain of the tanker was charged with a crime but got off on a legal technicality. \n\nI fished with my Dad out of the wharf during the 60s. We had no radar and no life raft, couldn't afford either one. How we went from the wharf to the Farallon Islands and Pt Reyes, time after time in the dark and in pea soup fog without getting run down by the numerous freighters that come in and out of SF still amazes me. Someone was watching out for us. \n\nNext time you are at the wharf, take a good look at the boats. There are sport fishing boats and a few pleasure boats, but there are still a number of hard working fishing boats which call Fisherman's Wharf home. Today they have radar, GPS, life rafts, satellite distress beacons and other devices to improve safety, yet danger still claims lives and boats in the seas off SF. In 2002 the Reliance went down with all hands and in 2004 the Relentless disappeared without a trace.  Next time you are down at the wharf, pay some respect to those who paid the ultimate price to put fresh fish on your plates. Their names are on a plaque in front of the little chapel on the pier straight across the water from Scomas.", "author": "Mark M."}

From the depths of Hell itself comes this most unnatural travesty, this most vile testament to all that is tacky and cheap. The lesser angels of our nature hath ne'er unleashed such a wonton scourge upon God's green earth as this tourist trap! Lo, lo and take thy leave of this most heinous nightmare. Leave this place and never speak of it again. For should God Himself strike fire upon the Earth, ridding the world of Man's most cruel and vile undoing, then, surely, this Fisherman's Wharf should stand as the first sign of impending apocolypse! Lo! Lo! Burn thine San Francisco sweatshirt and novelty license plate! And never speak of this tourist trap again!", "author": "Dave S."}

Of course I drew the shortest straw and had to take them.  God I hate this place.  Anyway to make a long story short I got pick pocketed here!  They got my wallet with $200 in cash and my credit cards.  By the time I realized they had racked $1500 in charges.   A**holes!  I will never go back!  This place is always packed with lowlifes and tourists.", "author": "Kayte M."}

There's lots of shopping and restaurants. The best part was there was this homeless dude on the bridge and he has this huge branch of leaves. He would hide behind it and scare people as they walked by. It so was so funny.", "author": "Garrett L."}

The giant metal crab in front of The Fisherman's Wharf was looking at everyone who past it or walked in front of it. The San Francisco bay is full of cool stuff like the Ripley's Museum, the Wax Museum, and Alcatraz. By far my favorite part is The Fisherman's Wharf the smell of seawater taffy and seals fill my nostrils and for once it smells kind of nice. Everywhere I look is restaurant I want to eat at or store with something I want to buy. It was amazing. \n\n At the Wharf there is some pretty cool places to eat one of my favorites was the hard Rock Caf\u00e9. Everywhere I looked I saw the guitar or signed record of someone famous and the food and service was great. If you collect autographs the place you want to go is The Field of Dreams, they have possibly every great autograph a sports fan would ever want. Another great part of the Wharf is the Taffy Barrel; it literally has barrels overflowing with amazing salt-water taffy and other candies. Another cool thing about the wharf is all the seals that wash up on the little rafts. They are always fighting each other to get a nice warm spot to lye down on and feel the warm summer sun on their bodies. Believe me if you ever go down to San Francisco visit the Fisherman's Wharf you will not be disappointed.  I give this amazing place a 5 out of 5 it is hands down won of my favorite places I've ever been to.", "author": "Holy Rosary S."}

From the Marina Green I crossed Fort Mason, came out at the end of Van Ness and strolled through Aquatic Park and out to the Wharf area. Had a burger and fries at In-n-Out (came in  just as they were fixin' to close) then moved on. Strolled past the row  of tour/fishing boats with glamorous names and  then veered left, onto a deserted boardwalk, past a few seafood restaurants... There, along the boardwalk, was a fleet of San Francisco's commercial fishing vessels, those hard-working boats without which there would be no seafood restaurants to go to. It was quiet here, and the air smelled of day-old fish, but I didn't mind. I strolled on past a small Mariners' Chapel, then out onto the fish processing piers, empty now and dotted with derrick cranes used to haul the catch out of the boats. A few of the processing plants were still busy even at 2 a.m., and I could glimpse the bustle of activity inside the cavernous warehouse spaces. I  was at the heart of San Francisco's fish processing district, the real Fisherman's Wharf. So think of the fishermen the next time you sit down to enjoy steamed mussels or Dungeness crab. Think of the people who, day in and day out, tirelessly bring you the bounty of the sea. Or even visit the fishing piers yourself - despite the fish stink, it is a rather humbling experience.", "author": "Froggy V."}

I've been going there for years and had a lot of great memories of going there as a child.  I tried most of the resturants there and found my favorite one to be Pier Market (in Pier 39).  After a full meal I would enjoy a nice stroll to Gharidelli for a Ice Cream sunday for dessert.  You really can't beat this place,  the food, the sights, the sounds, the people,  and did I mention the food?  This is definitely the place to be if you are a seafood lover (yes the clam chowder at Boudins is acctually really good, much better then almost all the resturants).", "author": "Roast D."}
