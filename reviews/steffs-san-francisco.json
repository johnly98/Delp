The drinks are reasonable with specials as well, and every now and then they have some pretty legit local brews. It's a standard american bar and i love them for that. Not overly grime-y like some places can be but also not super nice. Just a good bar to have a few drinks with friends.", "author": "Jason P."}

She then came back and said are you going start a tab?  I said yes and gave her my card.  I patiently waited, even as the game had started.  After a few minutes another lady came behind the bar.  I quickly said excuse me to the lady.  At this point the Asian lady yelled that it was not her job and that I would have to wait.  I said, but the game is already on.  She said...you know what....turned around and got my card...came over and put my card down and grabbed my beer and said I could go watch the fame somewhere else.  I was completely astonished.  How the hell did she escalate to that.  There was no yelling, I wasn't rude.  How the hell did we get here???

If you're looking for a frill-less and chill place to drink with friends, Steff's is a good option. Perfect for sports fans, but for those that don't care as much, there's also a pool table to have fun with. Another slight complaint though would be the bathroom. I don't care if the bathroom is old, as long as it's clean and works. However, there was no door for the ladies' bathroom, but rather just a curtain which was strange.

The drinks are cheap and the people are fun. There are plenty of T.V's and the staff is really friendly. I have watch countless games here and have not regretted the decision. You pay about $3.50 for a Bud or Bud light and $5 for a shot of Fernet or Jameson during happy hour which isn't half bad. The crowd mainly consist of work people but you do get a lot of the construction workers from the trans-bay terminal here so it's a mix of everyone. \n\nThey have free popcorn which is awesome and they do sell corn dogs which is an added perk to the spot. There is also a pool table in the back with plenty of T.V's which I have yet to use. There's a jukebox which has a bunch of hip hop music which is an added plus. I often have come here before I go to a more expensive spot without any hip hop music to use my money wisely haha. You can also come here on your lunch and eat your lunch and enjoy a beer. What more can I say about this place really?? It is always a go to for me and my coworkers and I'll be there tonight as the Giants take game 2 of this World Series!!\n\nYeah, I think you need to go!", "author": "Javier G."}

A rack of 8 TV's hangs over the bars, typically showing 3 sports channels at once.

I like to come here for lunch during baseball season and watch a few innings over a sandwich and a frosty beverage. The rest of the year, there's not much on the tube to hold my attention, but they're always busy in the evening for basketball games.\n\nTrivia: According to a 2004 US Bureau of Labor Statistics study, Montana is the only state wherein more than 1% of the population is employed as bartenders.

I saw the bartender pull out a corn dog from a container under the bar (not sure if there was a cooler under there) and popped it in the microwave for a few.  No one in our group dared to try them, but we saw many people in the bar try their luck.  An extra star, and a BIG thank you to the bartender with the accent, who said \"I hate you\" after she carded me and saw how old I was. :)", "author": "San D."}

The bartenders are cool and the beer is cold. COLD- Just to emphasize to the ones who know the importance. If you're into sports this is the place to go, cause they have a buttload of plasmas, and if you ask the bartender nicely they will change it to the game you need.  The bathrooms aren't scary and there's plenty of seating. OH and btw  beer and liquor is CHEAPER here. Beer at the most is 5 bux and makers is 7. Temple made me pay 10. Nuff said.", "author": "malarky j."}

The bartender has always been cool about switching to a game you actually care about; this is sweet because I don't have MLB extra innings at home. Bar patrons tend to be a random assortment of 9-5 types, with a few regulars. Everyone tends to mind their own business so this is a good happy hour stop--to watch sports. The unfortunate part though, is that they have no happy hour specials to speak of. Beer isn't the cheapest in town but if you're only having a couple on your way elsewhere, it's not too bad. Also, if you smoke, you'll never miss anything because you can monitor the game from outside, either from the big projector screen or else from one of the 4 or 5 stacked TVs in the entryway. Geez, this was a totally serious review.", "author": "Jenn W."}

I didn't mind as my friend and I were pretty unenthusiastic about the night that pre-empted Steff's so we sat at the bar and played liar's dice. We were there for a little bit over an hour and had an ok tim. I was a bit worried when the drunk guy next to me started tripping over the stools and hitting the bar, nearly knocking over 2 pints of beer that were right next to me. Also the washing method of the glasses that doesn't include a dishwasher is a no no for me. This is definitely a dive bar, sports bar maybe, and a good place to get semi cheap drinks at the end of the night.", "author": "D J."}

Don't order any of the food because it will make you sick. It's not a bad place to watch a game and they do have an internet jukebox which is nice. There is also a pool table in the back. Personally I love the place but I do understand why others dislike it. It's a nice dive type sport bar. In fact if I was a bar I think I'd look like Steff's", "author": "kArlos A."}

The bartenders are friendly, there are lots of TV's, there is a Jukebox and pool table.  Downsides are the floor gets sticky, the bathrooms are disgusting and as of late there have been some real rowdy people hanging out in there.  Still, you can find me there a few nights a week hanging out with my compadres.", "author": "Pele N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-23", "description": "A perfect stop on a pub crawl or any night out for an unpretentious drink and a chance to converse with friends. Slightly quieter than other neighborhood venues but a perfect stop while you wait for some of the clubs in the area to open. Stefanie is friendly and accommodating and worked with me to sort out stopping here on our massive bar crawl. The staff were open and non-judgemental. Perfect for our night out.", "author": "Jessica M."}
