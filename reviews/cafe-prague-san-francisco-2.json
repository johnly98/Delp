I saw a person shoot himself with something, I'm not going to pass judgment on what it was. The restaurant itself was super dark and kind of spooky, maybe they're playing it up for halloween ? Anyways on to the actual food, I ordered the tuna melt which cane with tomato soup. I have never been a fan of tomato soup, so maybe my prior prejudices may come in to place when I say it's was horrible. I have had tomato soup in the past but this one, I especially hated. As for the tuna melt, I like a good tuna melt sandwich. They decided to put their own spin on this sandwich. It had avacadoes, tomatoes, dijon mustard, and some other sauce that made it taste sour. I honestly can say this was the worst tuna melt that I have had. The dijon mustard just killed it for me. I will stay away from both items in general. They killed my craving for a tuna melt .

We simply asked one of the waitresses if there was a price for more bread and she snapped at us saying, \"More bread? You want more bread?!\" She grabbed our plate and headed to the kitchen. We were confused. Was it rude that we asked her if bread was free? This wasn't an Olive Garden where there's an unspoken rule about free bread.

Thanks! \n\nIt turns out my friend has only had their sandwiches (American style) here, which she loves.

When the goulash arrived, I thought it was kind of small, but then I realized that I was fast approaching my satiety level as soon as I took some bites of the goulash. Each bite of the beef was very soft and tender, topped with savory sauce with a slight kick. And the soft, yet dense bread was like a sponge, absorbing all the wonderful flavors of the sauce. Since I was so full half-way through, I took the rest of the goulash home. The leftovers still tasted just as good the next day!\n\nMy friend and I caught up for almost an hour, and the waitress never intruded, letting us hold our conversation. \n\nI also loved the decor in here.

The mixture of the meat in the stew is a very even texture. I could also taste a little bit of fine beer with the sauce, albeit slight.

Since Hidden Vine may not have a full menu, Prague seemed reasonable in terms of pricing and the interior seems kind of quirky and comfortable with bench seating and cushions against the walls.  \n\nAfter sitting down and order a couple of items for dinner, the oddest sounds entered my ears.  The music that played in the background was a mix of my 2013 Pop playlist and my Daddy Yankee Reggaeton playlists on Spotify.  Needless to say, I was digging the music although it was a bit loud.\n\nIn terms of food, I really liked their burrata although the vinegar dressing on the greens was a bit heavy handed.  The other items, the tuna crostinis and the tomato soup, were disappointing.  I think the soup was supposed to have gnocchi in there but when it got to us, it turned out to be bread pieces.  Ummm looks like gnocchi isn't the same as gnocchi.  The soup itself was good as it was a creamy tomato soup but I was bummed about the swap.  The tuna was a bummer due to the tuna being canned and not fresh.  I should've known better to order tuna from a place that may not look like that they use real fish for their dishes.\n\nOf course, also found out that they are cash only at the end of the night.  Usually they should have signage of some sort to warn customers that they don't take credit cards.  Well whatever they are doing to convey that message, it wasn't good enough.  It was a good thing that I had cash on me or else I would've had to use whatever ATM that they had on site.\n\nOverall, it was a below average experience here that could have been better if they communicated their CASH ONLY preference and delivered the food quicker(they took more than 30 minutes to deliver soup, burrata, and tuna fish on bread).  I can't and likely won't recommend a place like this to anyone I know.", "author": "Ben H L."}

The area is pretty dry for dinner after 6pm even though there are movie theatres, comedy club, and heck SF is a big city...\n\n\nWe came in without a reservation while they were filled with a private party  - it is a small place.

They go together perfectly for happy hour. \n\nWhile Cafe Prague has typically been a post-work spot for me, I've come to enjoy if for lunch too since coming here with a colleague for lunch.

Get the steak sandwich and a beer. Go in the evening for outside seating.\"\n\nI made the walk from my hotel, and found a very charming restaurant tucked in a side street near the fire station.  I took his advice, and ordered the steak sandwich and a Pilsner from the friendly waitress. \n\nThe food was not a disappointment. The beer comes at a half liter for 6 bucks, and it was..well, it was good beer. I'm no beer aficionado, but I liked it.\n\nI found out later, before the sandwich came, that I had a choice of soup or salad, so I opted for the French Lentil soup. Why not, be adventurous, right? The soup came out nice and hot, and it was thick with pieces of carrots and vegetables. I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was very hearty, and all I could think of as I ate it was that a great deal of work and time had gone into making it. \n\nThe steak sandwich was quite delicious as well. It's served on a very crisp, crunchy baguette, which has a nice soft inside. The steak had a little pink too it, which is perfect, and the sandwich came with greens (maybe spinach... maybe lettuce), tomato, and just the right amount of bleu cheese. I don't really like bleu cheese, but I let it happen, and the combination of flavors was quite delicious. I could be wrong, but I believe there was another kind of cheese on the sandwich as well, and it had kind of a Brie melt. It may have been havarti though. Either way, it added to the overall profile nicely. \n\nSee the pics for more detail. This is a great place in the city yet it still retains a neighborhood, European feel.

Cafe Prague should've never messed up on this dinner and should've had more attentive service given that we were seated late and my party received our food almost an HOUR later than expected with a reservation.\n\nI'm furious and would give this restaurant zero stars if Yelp would let me.\n\n-----\n\n***Lost my reservation for a party of 20, NEVER again for a large party or any eating occasion.\n\nIt was my birthday and I made a 7:15pm reservation for a party of 20 earlier this week for a Friday dinner. Everything was good to go and the cafe called me back several times to confirm a couple of details. I was even told that I would get the couch area to ensure we had more than enough seats for everyone.\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, I learned that my reservation had not been communicated and there was not a table in sight to be reserved for my party. For a reservation of two people, maybe I can understand that a reservation would get lost, but not for 20 people. My party was finally seated around ~7:45pm, my friends were starving and we received our food an hour later. With plans to meet up with others at 9:30pm, our dinner was a bit rushed and my party ended up splitting to meet others while I stayed back to wrap up the check -- Yes, that's a pretty expensive check to have people leaving while I'm still wrapping up the cash. We had to ask for the check twice before it came to our table. No comps in dinner, no sympathy for the party for lacking in customer service.\n\nWhat I'm most sad about is that I've recommended several people to find this restaurant, but that won't be happening anymore.", "author": "Christina L."}

Cafe Prague reminds me of a fine dining restaurant in Prague back in 1990 when you could buy a 5 course dinner for $2, except a bit run down. In spite of the chair-damaged walls and stained carpeting, the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable with deep banquette seating on one wall, a table-height counter on the opposite wall, and a cool bar, arranged perfectly for meeting the neighborhood, or the after work crowd. There's a lot to look at and 2 TVs if you're alone or want to see your team in action. In a way, maybe depending on the music, it's like Copenhagen.\n\nI love this place, because it's got a neighborhood feel in the midst of the financial district, the food is good, the beer excellent (try the Staropramen), has great wine, comfortable seating, and there's free wifi! (just ask for the password.) The carpeting and exposed beams in the ceiling help keep the noise level down.\n\nMondays are especially nice to come in and bring a laptop or a book since it's quiet. But Tuesdays and the rest of the week, lunchtime gets crowded. \n\nThere's also outdoor seating on quiet little Merchant Street tucked between Clay and Washington halfway between Battery and Sansome.\n\nThe lunchtime waitress remembers people.

Cafe Prague is the closest I'll get to reliving my days on the Danube, from the (slow and unsmiling) Eastern European service, to the taste of paprika as I chow down. It's an adorable little restaurant that seems to get more and more crowded every time I go, filled with comfortable furniture that looks nothing like a modern-day American restaurant. \n\nI've actually noticed an improvement in service over time, but they definitely aren't trying to turn tables around in 30 minutes, so save it for when you can spend 1hr+ on a meal. Don't forget that it is cash only, although they have an ATM in the back if you're in a squeeze.\n\nTip for ordering - I generally get the normal goulash or szeged goulash (basically goulash with a horseradish thing going - it makes it taste a bit more tart than the normal one), and ALWAYS start with the tomato gnocchi soup.

Here was a great little wine bar, that unfortunately was closed when we peeked in, (making a mental note to try it later).  Next door - Cafe Prague, which looked kind of funky/chic on the outside, with a kind of makeshift patio in the Euro-street tradition. \n\nThe inside was even more cozy and welcoming, and our waitress/bartender (whose name I HAVE to get next time - homework assignment!) was very accomodating. Guess that wouldn't have been hard to achieve, since it was at the top of \"Happy Hour\", and we were the only ones there.\n\nWe ordered from the HH menu, both of us getting the tomato soup with gnocchi to start.  Bear also got the cheese plate, while I honed in on the spinach salad.  Plus, our hostess gave us free sample bites of tuna on toasted bread bites.  YUM.\n\nThe soup was exquisite, not loaded down but gently 'infused' with the gnocchi, which was definitely homemade, not frozen or canned.  My spinach salad was HUUUUGE! It was a bit of a challenge for me to get through, and that isn't something I can usually say about most salads! But this one was generously endowed with EVERYTHING...especially the spinach greens, boiled egg and lardons of crisp bacon. A lemon wedge was provided for extra flavor, but the only thing missing was an extra bit of something - maybe some kind of vinaigrette to give it that extra OOMPH.  I did steal some incredible bleu cheese bits from Bear's plate, and that really helped!\n\nHe struggled with the cheese plate, ending up taking some of it 'home'.  That was also an expansive dish, with the four cheeses, (bleu, Cammembert, goat and Brie) served with pitted olives and hot French bread slices.  Wines complemented the meals - Chardonnay for me, merlot for him, as well as some samples of the dark beers they have on tap.\n\nAll-in-all, a rather nice 'discovery' in back of Club Quarters.

So i miss out on some of these hidden gems like Cafe Prague.  But since I was off last Fri, my boyfriend asked me to meet him for lunch since he had his daughter later that evening.  I wanted to go to Mixed Greens since he always raves about their salads, but I guess he's sick of that place, since that's where he normally eats nearly everyday.\n\nI have to say, I felt like I was in Europe, the moment I stepped into the restaurant.  The vintage, out-dated and unpretentious decor, was border-line tasteless, and yet it was extremely inviting; charmingly comfortable.  And at first I dis-liked the loud techno-house type music (which I only like at night club), but then it changed to Diana Krall-type romantic music which I love.  \n\nThe menu was gigantic with countless items under salads and sandwiches... it took me awhile to decide.  My boyfriend ordered one of their native beers, but i just had a diet coke since I had to drive up to Atherton after our lunch.  Well if I didn't have an appointment, I most likely would have given a 5 star rating, meaning if you are not in a rush and can take at least a 2hr lunch, then this cafe is outstanding for lunch.  Unfortunately the only negative about this place, is that the wait for the food is extremely long.  Otherwise, the food is absolutely delicious!  I enjoyed every bite... we shared our sandwiches and the tomatoe soup.... yummmmm!\n  \nWill definitely come back when I have nothing but lunch to worry about:)", "author": "Myra M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-03-25", "description": "My colleague and I walked down the alley (Merchant Street) on our way to the Hidden Vine wine bar. Unfortunately, but now understandably, they were busy and had no available seating. We decided to try the Cafe Prague next door, which had plenty of room.\n\nCafe Prague's wine selection is almost non-existent. They had just one red wine by the bottle, which was something fairly unpleasant from San Louis Obispo. Their food selection is OK and was completely adequate for light snacks. You wouldn't go out of your way for the food, but we had no complaints about it. \n\nSo far, this was all somewhat to be expected. After all, it's called the Cafe Prague, so they're featuring beers rather than wine, and the food basically went along with that motif. It was a little loud, with people standing outside smoking cigarettes, the smoke wafting in the open doorway. I should add that this doesn't bother me in the slightest, and even adds to that old world Eastern European ambience. But, I know some people would find it annoying.\n\nThe bill was $61.85+tip, for a beer, a bottle of wine, and 3 appetizers--not an unreasonable sum for downtown San Francisco.\n\nThe completely unacceptable shock came when I laid down my credit card and was informed that they took cash only. There is no signage to that effect and, more importantly in 2015, there is no reason for it, other than to be abusive to customers and, maybe, to hide cash under the table. There are numerous options (like Square) that make it easy for even the smallest merchants to accept all major credit cards for a flat 2.75%. If this place can't afford that as a cost of doing business their business model doesn't seem sustainable. I happen to carry cash, so they couldn't rope me into using their on premises ATM (hidden in the back) which presumably exacts a usurious additional fee.\n\nIf they were extraordinarily good at something, perhaps I would just deal with this insult and patronize them anyway, ala Peter Luger's in Brooklyn. Given that Cafe Prague isn't especially good at anything and would only warrant a 3/5 rating even if they took credit cards, I certainly won't be going back.", "author": "Mark F."}

To that effect, the service was a bit too slow for a business lunch hour. \n\nI will go back for the ambiance and chill feel.", "author": "Ellen B."}

Five dollars for a half-liter and eight for a full liter are OK prices, not great. \n\nThe beer selection is sparse and remembering the half and half trick with the two Czech beers from last time I ordered it again. I was given a liter mug that was about 4/5ths full http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=jy_RGAeAvNeCv5BxZsUWFA and a bill for $10.95, Ten dollars for the beer and .95 cents tax. I pointed out the listing on the happy hour menu that stated liters were $8 and he said that didn't include half and half. I looked at him incredulously and he told me to talk to the owner. I told her I was willing to pay the listed price for the beer, ignoring that the mug wasn't nearly full, and she agreed. After 7 the beer price goes up to a ridiculous $7 a half-liter so I only had the one.\n\nOne of my friends ordered the Polish sausage appetizer and it took 90 minutes for him to get it and then he was short changed when he paid.\n\nThese people either have no idea what they are doing or they are purposely trying to chisel people, either way Cafe Prague is on my no-go list.", "author": "Manny F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-20", "description": "After walking around Chinatown all day and looking at the jars at the Chinese herb stores, everything on the menu here looked pretty appetizing. There were a couple of unfortunate things that kept this place from getting more stars.\n\nFirst, the music. Now, I'm no music expert, but I'm pretty darn sure whoever was singing \"Hotel California\" at the top of the lungs in Spanish is NOT a big star in the Czech Republic.\n\nSecond, the menu. There were, basically, five items on the menu that could be considered Czech, or have origins in the area. The rest were kind of American. I can see American items on the menu, but if you're a Czech restaurant, well, please have more Czech things.\n\nI was fearful of trying some of the items because they sounds like they might be, well, large, and I didn't want to tote a belly full of roast duck up some damn 45 degree street for seven blocks. So I opted for the safe sausage and mashed potatoes.\n\nIt was perfect for me. I was looking for something light (as in quantity) and it was a tasty sausage with some sauerkraut and pickles and mustard and a nice dollop of mashed potatoes. The coffee was Euro-style, which is to say, \"full flavored,\" which is to say, why waste time drinking six cups when you can do it all at once? I liked it a lot. Some nice beers on tap. We left with our hunger quenched but not nappy. Service was good, but we had to have her count the change again because she messed up. Handled it well though.\n\nNot that I'll be hiking around the Financial district any time soon, but I would really like to see some more Czech items. My fault for not asking how large the portion was on the duck, or the dumplings, or the other items. And for God's sake get rid of that music.\n\nI would come here again to try the other items, though.", "author": "Wayne D."}

It's sort of tucked into an alley-way...but that's mostly a side point.\n\nI'm half Czech, so I've had a lot of Czech food over my lifetime and this place was nothing to write home about.\n\nBetween me and my fiance, we had:\n\"czech fries\" to start (fries with raw garlic on them. They were pretty tasty but not really czech. We followed that up with Gulash and Svickova. The gulash, a meat stew with dumplings, had waaaaaaaay too much paprika in it. The svickova, a sauce made of pureed root vegetables, served with dumplings and beef, was also mediocre. It was a bit too runny and definitely lacked flavor. Overall, I would give the food a two. \n\nFor desert we each had a strudel (an apple based dessert). Now, that the restaurant got right. It was fantastic and a great way to end the night. 5 stars.\n\nAs for other elements, the atmosphere was pleasant and non-stuffy. There was a good mix of Czech and American patrons. The waitress was friendly, and there was a pretty big TV one could watch. The noise level was also quite low (which I appreciate).\n\nThe one thing that stood out was that they didn't take debit/credit. Although there was an ATM on site, it was broken.

The sauce and dumplings and beer were excellent though.  \n\nThe decor of the place is eclectic and cozy and comfortable. \nThe thing that really ruined the otherwise charming atmosphere was the overly loud and obnoxious (yelling and brash) music which didn't fit the place at all!  We do love many types of music but this was just totally out of place and WAY too loud. \nIf we had not been looking specifically for a Czech restaurant, we would have gone elsewhere.\n\nWe asked the waitress if it could be turned down... she did turn it down but a barely detectable amount.  We engaged her in conversation about the music and asked if she had perhaps a different type she could put on. She got defensive and angry and said if she changed it to what we wanted, then someone else would complain and it was just not a good idea to change it.  Then she said ok... you tell me what to put on and I'll put that on.  We suggested something more in keeping with the restaurant... maybe some European style background music.  She grumped off and changed it to some very nice french cafe type music.  She came back to the table to ask if that was ok.. we said YES! much better! and a fellow at a nearby table chimed in and agreed wholeheartedly.  There were very few people in the restaurant that evening.\n\nWe continued our meal and ordered dessert, when she delivered the strudel to our table she commented...  we'll see if you find something wrong with this too.\nPerhaps she meant it as a joke... but, it came across as poor attitude. \n\nThe strudel, by the way, was excellent!  and a generous portion.\n\nThe owner was not present that night and we can't help but wonder if things would have been different if the owner was there. \nWe strongly suggest he talk with his waitress regarding how to treat customers and the restaurant's music.  Although we had asked for an out of the ordinary adjustment, we were very polite and (we felt) reasonable in our request to turn the music down.\n\nFor those looking for Czech food in SF - a small cafe called Paprika is well worth the trip.

The place wasn't too packed and half the time, the waitress was on her phone. We ended up going to the counter to pay - I'm almost wondering if this was what we were supposed to do all along anyways, but we did see other tables getting their checks as they finished so I'm not sure what was going on.\n\nIn any case, the food and atmosphere was great and the service was (mostly) good and I would definitely come back again.", "author": "E E."}

I had the lentil soup, which was hot and had lots of vegetables. it was a bit on the watery side and lacking many lentils, but the flavor was good.  It comes in a large portion considering it's a side with the main course (sandwich in my case).  I had the melted brie over turkey and prosciutto and really enjoyed the crusty baguette and fresh greens.

I was initially disappointed when I saw the menu as there was no svickova listed as I had seen on a menu posted on a website.  I asked the waitress if the sauerbraten on the menu was actually svickova and she assured me that it was.  I can understand that sauerbraten is easier for most Americans to understand, but what you are getting is the superior Czech dish, not the German one.  This meal was fantastic.  A true joy.  Better than the svickova my mother used to make.  It was served with the traditional dumplings (knedlicky) and a little cream and cranberry along with a slice of lemon.  Accompanied with some Staropramen (Old Spring) from the Smichov neighborhood of Prague, you have the real deal in Czech cuisine.  Finished the meal with an apple strudel and coffee.

However, seeing that Yelp, in their infinite wisdom, decided to make a whole new listing for Caf\u00e9 Prague, i am forced to write a new review.  Aha! I shall buck the system and make this a quasi-update instead by putting my old review on the bottom.  \n\nTechnically, to justify Yelp's new designation, they have moved locations.\n\nHowever, it is the exact same place as old (see infra) with some minor differences that make a world of difference...to me at least.  So as of now...two stars but it may be bumped up (see infra).\n\nFirst, the space retained very little of the other location's charm...total bummer.\n\nSecond, and man this is such the deal breaker too, the new location is sorely lacking in counter girls that are basically Sylvia Saint look-a-likes.  I used to go out of my way in the mornings for a coffee from Caf\u00e9 Prague to chat it up with some fresh off the boat 20 something ridiculously hot Czech, Polish, or Hungarian girl that liked my accent.  Now...sadly sadly sadly sadly (I can't say sadly enough) lacking...however, I am willing to pop in on occasion just in case!  I will report back!\n\n\n********************************************\n\n3 star rating\n11/10/2007\n\nConsistently inconsistent.\n\nI gave it a shot.  Actually about thirty shots give or take.  And while I waited for the place to just click it just doesn't go smoothly.\n\nDon't get me wrong I love this place but you just never know what is going to happen on each and every visit.\n\nPrices changes daily it seems.  Sometimes even between the time you see the price on the outside board to when you pay.  Coffee orders are usually 75% correct.  ATM machine is always a crapshoot.  Ice some days...some days no.\n\nIf you are like me (an eastern europeanphile) you'll just chalk it up to the culture from which it sprung.   The interior is laden with Prague images and artwork.  They play Czech music often (which may be a minus for most).  The servers are aloofly nice.  The food is downright good but a little pricey.\n\nAll in all...I still recommend this place.  I'll just have to whittle my visits to just a beer on the patio only times.  Otherwise, I just can't count on getting the same experience twice...and unfortunately, this is right by my work and my mind is on other things and I need a little more consistency to make the rest of my day easier.", "author": "Chris D."}

He just seemed annoyed.   There was nothing at all inviting or friendly about the place and so we didn't stay to eat.  Maybe the place is better when there are happy people around.", "author": "Jorah N."}

So tasty, nice atmosphere. Friendly and helpful staff. Big wide bar and comfy stools with plenty of space to enjoy your platter and down a few hearty brews.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I have been here twice now and I really like the KRUOVICE beer. Seriously i have no clue how to pronounce it but it tastes pretty darn good. They have a good happy hour that lasts till 7pm with beers only being $3.50. The food is pretty substandard though. We tried the quesadilla and it was pretty week. If you need to eat, go with with the cheese plate, it is a much better value.", "author": "Jeff P."}

We went over for post-work-vent-about-layoffs-happy-hour- it was decent. For happy hour, wine was $2 off, which was nice. We had three glasses of pinot each and the cheese plate. It was a nice simple place with a cool Eastern European decor. Service was decent, they seemed a wee-bit short-staffed, but it wasn't too busy, so it was fine. I'd go back again, but honestly, I prefer happy hours with cocktails, not just wine and beer.", "author": "Ieesha C."}

I went in the middle of the day last week for coffee and a snack with my friend.

It is tucked away in a little ally and when we walked in were greeted by blaring 90's cheesy techno beats and and disco ball spinning at full speed likely capable of inducing epileptic seizures. The bartenders/owner was visibly drinking behind the bar and, against the wishes of almost every patron within the bar, kept turning the music up to the point where my ears were ringing. At least they had Krusovice on tap, which I have not been able to find outside of the Czech Republic. The first beer I ordered was definitely Krusovice and I ordered a second, however I was brought something completely different despite their insistance that it was. I love Czech beers and know them very well at this point...it wasn't an effing Krusovice. One of the other patrons then offered up his own ipod, which they played for a few songs, but then switched back to the 90's techno, at which point my husband and I left. It was an incredibly weird and awkward experience and definitely not worth going back. Can some other bar in SF please carry Krusovice on tap???", "author": "Sheena S."}
