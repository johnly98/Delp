The go-to for me here are the pulled pork nachos.In fact, anything pulled pork here is pretty legit. But that plate of nachos is pilled high with lots of cheesy, meaty, spicy goodness. Tender flavorful pork, cheddar cheese, and fresh pico de gallo over crisp chips. So yummy and large enough to share for two. Otherwise go for a classic and dependable burger washed down with some grapefruit IPA. \n\nThe servers are great and Bell Tower has kept their prices steady and fair through the years. It's low key and relaxed. The same few seats outside are prime spots on warm sunny days and with good reason.", "author": "Jon L."}

I think this is your body trying to prevent you from continuing to eat food that is served past the date it should be thrown out. \n\nIt thinks: \"Wait...something is off here. I'll only turn on the appetite after I know that I'm far away from where ever I'm eating this.\" \n\nThis is savvy though because it's like you ate but you didn't so good for diets too.", "author": "Jackson S."}

A wonderful selection on the menu, setting, service, price and food make this a great spot on the corner to snag some great grub on Polk.\n\nThe space is cozy, but they have a full bar and maybe one of the smallest kitchens for a full-service restaurant I've ever seen. I was actually a little skeptical how the food would turn out when we walked in, but don't judge books by their size....or something.\n\nI am normally averse to restaurant specials, but the pork loin stuffed with chorizo, peppers, and mushrooms with onion gravy, mashed potatoes and steamed veggies sounded too good for this Iowa-grown boy to pass up, and I was blown away. A great special, all for only $20. My wife got the salmon special and loved it. Dessert was good, too. \n\nAt one point while we were waiting for our food, we kept long-necking dishes being brought to other tables- they all looked and smelled so good!

I love the menu here- almost everything on it is something I would order and they always have interesting daily specials. Service can be hit or miss but is usually really friendly and good. They also have the Dogfish 90 minute IPA on draft and it's only $7 for a pint which is a great deal. \n\nFood wise, things could generally be seasoned better and I wish their dishes had a better sense of balance. I have mostly ordered the rib eye with creamed spinach and fries and it's a very generous serving of steak. The fries generally don't have much salt and the spinach is often under-seasoned also.  That being said, it's a satisfying dinner and I always have leftovers to take home. The pork chop is pretty good too and they have a pretty delicious French onion soup. Most of their dishes come with interesting sides and they also have a full bar and solid wine and beer list. \n\nDefinitely more interesting menu options than your standard neighborhood bar. I wish the flavors in the food were a bit more consistent but overall a solid spot and I'm sure I'll continue coming back. Probably closer to 3.5 stars but I'll round up.", "author": "Seema U."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-19", "description": "This place markets itself in the weirdest way and is honestly so confusing - it is the weirdest fusion of traditional American bar food, Mexican food, and Italian food. My friend brought us here to have \"Mexican food\" and there were maybe 2 dishes on the menu that seemed remotely \"Mexican\", one being nachos. However, it seemed like there were a generous amount of pasta dishes on the menu, one being the special for the night. \n\nCame with a group of 4 and two of us ordered the \"special\" - beef stroganoff for $18. Now to say I love pasta is an understatement - I literally could eat any type of pasta/noodles and would think its amazing, probably because i'm such a carbaholic, but really it's hard to screw up pasta for me. And I could totally be wrong since i'm not a beef stroganoff expert, but since when does it come with tomato sauce?? The beef was also ridiculously dry and tough and i ended up leaving most of it on the plate. The pasta itself was fine but i was just so turned off by the whole meal and the place so it really wasn't a saving grace for me.\n\nOverall, expensive food, failed attempt at fusion (if that's what they were trying to do), ok service, and average size portions. To make matters worse, the tables were being cleaned with really strong bleach and the stench stayed with us the entire meal. At least I know the tables were clean though?

The beef cut was awesome, tender and dressed with a sauce. Dish was paired with butterflied shrimp which was fresh and cooked perfectly.\nOverall the dinner was fabulous, service was attentive and atmosphere was romantic for a bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-10", "description": "I'm basing this review on the fact that I would never again consider \"dining\" here again:\n\nThe bad:\n1)  The noisiest place I have eaten since I was a kid at summer camp.\n\nThe acoustics are horrible and people's voices are incredibly amplified - the woman's laugh at the next table was almost punishing and I could clearly hear the voice of someone on the other side of the restaurant.  When I thought it could not get any worse, they turned on \"music\" and the resultant cacophony was less than pleasant.  My dinner mate and I continually asked one another to repeat what they just had said.  \n\n2) The service was terrible.  There were two waitresses total to cover both the inside and outside tables.  The result was incredibly slow service and not only slow, but bad.  For example, I finished my beer half way through my meal and was not only not asked if I wanted a second one, but never saw one of the two waitresses pass close enough to even flag her down.\n\n3) I had a hamburger.  Now it is pretty difficult to screw up a hamburger, but it was the oddest tasting, worst hamburger I have ever consumed. To clarify, I did not consume the whole hamburger and I was hungry!  I don't believe there was any sauce, etc., on the burger, it just tasted bad.  As I type this, I still have an after taste from my encounter with that alleged hamburger.  If you want a hamburger, go to a fast food restaurant, save lots of bucks, and get one that tastes like a hamburger should.\n\nI'm not sure if you can award a restaurant zero stars, but I have not tried that tack because my dinner mate tells me that her salmon was excellent, however, I am writing this revenue based on my own personal experience - not someone else's. However, based on her review, I gave the place a whole star. \n\nAs I stated at the beginning of this review, I will not be back - there are too many excellent choices in the area.", "author": "Sandy S."}

Again, our order came quickly.\n\nThe house red wine tasted like...well, a house red.  It was fine for such a cheap price.  The nachos were served up in a very generous portion and were quite satisfying.  Ditto for the cobb salad.  Nothing we ate was awful, it just wasn't special or anything worth returning for.  \n\nOverall the food is decent.  The vibe was a little flat, perhaps due to the time of week we visited.

I don't like bars, I don't like crowds of people but I had to burn 30 minutes and my heart pined for a double IPA.  I walk in and there is only one empty stool at the bar.  \"God!\", I thought, \"I have to sit next to someone I don't know, and what if they start talking to me?\" - but I walked in and sat down as if that's what everyone does.  \"God!\", I thought, \"Now I got to get the bar keeps attention and she's so busy!  What if she doesn't notice me?\"\n\n\"What will it be?\", she said with a warm smile that was welcoming.  \"God!\", I thought, \"She noticed me!!!\" and said, \"Double IPA\".  She never heard of \"double IPA\".  She looked at the customers for help.  I thought, \"God!  You call this a bar?\"  One of the customers said, \"Get him a Union Jack.\"  He looked at me helpfully and said, \"You will enjoy the Union Jack.\"  His cutie girlfriend added helpfully, \"It's from Paso Robles.\"  I looked at her appreciatively and said, \"Pasa Robles\" annoyed that she said the name as I was unaccustomed to hearing.  \"Paso Robles\", she said.\n\nThe barkeep brought me two samples of different beers.  One awful sweet beer and the Union Jack which was quite good.  \"I'll have this one\", I said holding up the beer she placed at my left.  She smiled and said, \"Which one is that?\"  \"The one you put to my left.\"  I was curious to see if she could remember.  She didn't, so I was forced to say, \"Union Jack\".  \"This is America!\", I thought, \"Why are people in Pasa Robles giving beer British names?\"  She brought me a nice pint and placed it on a Lagunitas coaster.  I looked over and saw 'A Little Sumpin' Extra\" at the pump and wondered why she didn't give me that one.  \"There's a proper name for a beer.\", I thought.\n\nA group of men finished their drinks and left.  The barkeep gave them a shout, \"Hey!  Thanks!  See you guys later; but don't tell my husband!\"  They laughed and I thought, \"So she's got a husband?\"  Then I thought, \"Oh, it's a joke, but maybe she has a husband anyway.\"\n\nAfter checking in with Yelp, verifying I have no new emails in the last 4 minutes, I started to watch this college football game and enjoy my beer.  My face was glued to the screen until the bar keep goes up and says, \"Anyone watching this?  I'm gonna change it if nobody is watching it...\".  I smiled as she broke my total absorption in the game and said, \"Not me!\"  \n\nWhen my 30 minutes were up I posted a twenty and waited for change - but needed call attention to my need to leave.  Then a strange thing happened.  She said, \"I'm sorry to see you leave!  I wish you would stay longer.\" - in such a way that I felt so cared for!  I told her I was going to go eat dinner.  She asked where and I said, \"The steak house.\"  She then named off half a dozen and said, \"Which one?\"  \"Harris\", I said - and she said, \"You won't be disappointed.\"  Because she was so nice, I told her how much I enjoyed the beer and watching her and her niece (she explained earlier they were related) work.  The bar was full of people and she was the only one taking care of the customers but she gave me her full attention to listen to what I had to say and take the time to appreciate my patronage.  At last, she said, \"My name is Debra, what's yours?\"  \"Steve\" I said.\n\"Steve, I'm glad you came in, and I hope you come back.\"   Up until then, it was just a bar, but it was in that 30 seconds of attention that was so profound.   \"God!  This is the best bar in the whole wide world!\", I thought.", "author": "Steve S."}

The first time I came here, I had a great time. Unfortunately the second time around I had an extremely negative experience. I ordered a fruit bowl from the acai place next door but my boyfriend wanted to stop in for some nachos. When we spoke to the hostess/waitress I specifically asked if it was ok to bring in outside food before we even were seated, and she said yes no problem! So my boyfriend placed his order and then I ordered a cup of coffee just to be extra considerate for them allowing me to bring in my bowl. A few sips into my coffee the waitress came back and said she was misinformed and that I could not have outside food. I felt I  was being shamed even though I asked prior to even sitting. So we had to request the food to go and leave. It was a poor experience and I will not be returning unfortunately.", "author": "Elise M."}

And it's likely to be a hot spot on the weekends and sometimes has a line that goes right around the corner or the pricing is super steep (and yet we foodies still go eat there)...\n\nBut at the Bell Tower isn't really any of this. The restaurant is small, but cozy...it also doesn't have some insane line and features very reasonable prices. There is a giant 60\u2033 television in the back too, so my family and I were able to watch the Mavs get destroyed by the Spurs (game 7) over brunch.\n\nBut back to the food.\n\nThe following dishes were had: Eggs Benedict, Pulled Pork Sandwich, and Pistachio Baked Brie Salad. The eggs benedict were just alright - very standard, not much flair. I couldn't put my finger on it, but it was just missing something. The pulled pork sandwich was excellent though, nice flavor and very hearty on the meat. The shoestring fries were good too...not too oily but perfectly crisp. The runaway winner though was the pistachio baked brie salad. The brie was a very hearty wedge that was rolled in crushed pistachios, deep fried, then drizzled with truffle honey served with toasted baguettes and a light spring mix. The brie was to die for. So good\n\nLooks like I'll have to be back - everyone talks about the ahi tuna tacos!", "author": "Elaine Y."}

They recognize us (we live around the corner) and they know what drinks to serve us as soon as we sit down. It's just a combination of good American food with a few Italian dishes, a few Mexican, and some good bar food. Great place to watch a game at their bar, too; good vibes although if you're eating there when a game is going on, it can be a little loud but that is certainly not their fault. Their 3 cheese pasta is delish, the ribs are awesome, the chicken sandwich is great, the portions are large (I always have enough to take home for lunch). The servers are always friendly, they're always smiling - you see the same faces so you know they must like their work because they have really low turnover. They always come by to see if everything is alright and if there are any issues they have always dealt with them quickly and painlessly. Very good value for your money. It's just a great place.

I think the location is cool and it is a nice option for sitting outdoors when its sunny (that one week in September), but nothing, and I mean nothing on the menu has made me stop and say \"Hmmm, that was a pretty damn good (insert foodstuff here)\".  My general rule of thumb is if I can make it better myself, well then I do...of course not if its an especially lazy Sunday, then I don't.\n\nLiving two blocks away has afforded me the chance to stop in a number of times.  Plus they have that magic thing called beer which has bewitched me!  I've had the tuna tacos, the pulled pork sandwich, the special chicken sandwich, (which was so bland and bad, my roommate and I proclaimed it the worst use of the word \"special\" we've ever encountered on Polk Street and if you know Polk Street, there is a good bit of \"Special\" going on here).  \n\nToday, was the final straw.  I've vowed to not go back for food again.  Ordered the fish and chips and it was bland.  Surprise!  Not really.  I saw that twist coming before the butler ever made that suspicious phone call at the end of Act One.  But honestly, I had to over salt everything.  The fish batter tasted exactly like the fries, or was it the other way around?  Change your frying oil, get it.    \n\nI see lots of folks raving about the mac and cheese...maybe if I am feeling extremely forgiving or its part of my AA program (making peace with the past and shit...never mind), I might, just might give this place one more shot...maybe.

The service always comes with a sincere and heart-warming smile, is efficient, smart and just works. It all stems from the top so thank you Barbi!

The waitress asked us how many we would be, we said two, she waived her hands and the empty tables and said \"sit anywhere\".\n\nNow, there was only one two-top, and the rest were four-tops.  I walked over to the four-top next to the window as it was a nice day and the tables outside were all taken.  The waitress comes over right away and I ask if it is ok if we sit there.  SHE THEN ROLLS HER EYES AND SAYS, \"COME ON GUYS, FOR TWO?\"  What the hell is that?  We both put ourselves through school working in the restaurant industry. In no circumstances would I have EVER said something that snide to a customer. \n\nWe move upstairs to a two top, the BUSSER comes by and takes our drink and food order before she even comes by to check on us again. He was great by the way. Before anything comes out, I see a table opening up outside. My wife asks the waitress if we can move out there, she says there is a list.  No problem, except for that she takes the time to come by again a few minutes later to tell us \"If you wanted to sit outside, you should have told me.\"  Again, don't lecture the customer, that's crap.  Also, it wasn't an issue of outside being another server's section.  She was the only one working.  \n\nFood was, meh.  Burger was ok, Polker's down the street is better and cheaper. My pulled pork sandwich tasted fresh out of a bag from Trader Joe's or something.  Not very good, not awful.  \n\nServer ignored us for the rest of our stay other than these interactions listed here.  The Busser was great, he came by loads of time while we witnessed our waitress standing at the bar chatting with the bartender.  \n\nOverall, I'm not coming back.  Lived in the neighborhood for a while now, and there are lots of other great spots.  Not worth it living in a city with such great places close by to have a ok meal and horrible service.

I was recommend a dark ale and it was all sorted out. For food I ordered the pulled pork quesadilla. Really tasty, the pork was cooked perfectly. Very delicious and massive portion. Money well spent. \n\nExperience #2 - Was about five days after experience #1. For drinks, my friend wanted to try the house red, and was trying to ask where the wine came from. Our server was clearly not educated in wine whatsoever, the table had to explain to her that wine will be labeled regionally if it is from Spain. We were treated like idiots because it was the \"cheap wine\". Tsk tsk. If you can't sell a house wine, you're not going to sell the expensive wines, dear. \n\nMy friend ordered the pork nachos. These were like experience #1 and really tasty when I tried them.\n\n It was Fat Tuesday so they were doing a New Orleans themed menu.. (I'd like to interject here and say that I lived in the south and spent much time in Louisiana. I know my Cajun/Creole well. ) I ordered the gumbo. The scents were on point. The flavor? Well, I couldn't taste the flavor because the salt was so heavy. When I asked to have my food replaced the pretty little blonde server tried to explain (but really just) lecture about what food is seasoned and what food isn't. She kept freaking out over anything with salt, told me that the pork chops are smoked and that adds a natural saltiness. At that point I was so annoyed (and hangry because I was the only person at my table without food) by the girl speaking to me like I don't understand seasoning, that I ordered the burger. Which came to me totally underseasoned..really? Sigh, I'm not hypersensitive to salt people. The gumbo was just overseasoned. Geez.\n\n I will say, Mr Man Bun server was very helpful, understood when I switched my food, was super friendly, educated in the menu and its ingredients, and really was the only reason I didn't flip out on Blondie. I don't have a bad temper, but I do when an uneducated server is trying to tell me that smoking food adds salt. (Again, LOLz... girl please) \n\n\n\nSo many LOL'z. So many. Please, please train your staff and don't run out of my favorite (and, apparently everyone else's) drinks. I will add more stars.\n\n\n\n Two stars for experience #1 the pork quesadilla/nachos **\n\n One star for experience #2 with man bun saving the day. Thank you sir.

He enjoyed the meal but felt the wasabi mashed potatoes was a bit over the top (an awful lot of wasabi which for him was odd since he is used to eating wasabi). I tried a bit of the mashed potatoes and thought it was a unique blend.\n\nMy meal was the mushroom ravioli which was delicious. Now admittedly, it was a heavy entree which is not normal for me but given how hungry I was, it was a perfect fit. The mushroom gravy was delicious and quite cheesy which complemented the ravioli rather nicely.\n\nPrior to our entrees we had the salt and pepper calamari with the chili dipping sauce which was fantastic. It was a perfect blend and the calamari (being deep fried) didn't feel too heavy or too breaded.", "author": "Shauna S."}

My friends and I were lucky enough to stumble upon The Bell Tower, and had a great experience!\n\n5 out of 6 people at our table decided to order the Stuffed Chicken Breast! Upon looking at the menu, it is definitely the standout, so I can understand the appeal. And it was, indeed, quite an array of awesome ingredients combined magnificently on one plate. \n\nAs a lover of pork (and bread pudding), I diverged and took the path less taken.. deciding to go with the Grilled Pork Chop with cheddar jalape\u00f1o bread pudding(!) and corn with bacon. SOOOO AMAZING! My boyfriend tried mine, and agreed that my dish was better. Grilled to perfection, the outside was nice with a slight crisp, while the inside, juicy and tender. The cheddar jalapeno bread pudding was a unique and delicious accompaniment.  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and recommend it to anyone coming here!\n\nThe restaurant itself has a chill, but classic vibe. The service was great, and the waitresses made great recommendations as to wine pairings for our meals. Overall, I really enjoyed my time here and would love to come back again someday.", "author": "Kristina R."}

The servers were incredibly attentive, constantly checking on us, making sure our food was ok, refilling our drinks, etc.  We shared the pulled pork nachos, which were delicious, and the chicken and brie sandwich.  I didn't love the chicken sandwich, I thought it was pretty bland, but the nachos were great.  The pulled pork gave them really nice flavor and they were super cheesy.\n\nAfter going to see a movie, we tried to think of a place for dinner where we could finish up watching the games, and after our earlier experience we headed straight back to the Bell Tower.  Again, impeccable service.  Constant refills, friendly conversation, etc.  I can't speak highly enough of the people working there.  We had the cowboy spring rolls and the fried calamari (we were still full from lunch!) and both were good.

We ordered 3 glasses of wine between the 2 of us, he ordered the salmon (~$17), I ordered the cobb salad ($15.50), and we ordered the escargot as an appetizer ($7). The bill came out to be 77 bucks, how? I have no idea. I didn't really look it over, but my friend and I split the bill. I had a salad and a glass of wine and 3 pieces of escargot and paid almost 50 bucks including tip. That's extremely ridiculous considering the quality of food that night was just okay.

As we waited, we walked around the restaurant - beautiful tapestry on the indoor benches and the pastries look delicious.  If you go outside, there is a very nice patio area with a fountain and arbors over select tables.  There was a room called The Banquet Room that was full of about 20 women.  That was nice, and made me think that this was a charming area to hold a luncheon meeting.  \n\nThe reason I gave this place only 3 stars was that when we got home they had gotten the sandwiches all wrong.

Not only did it look half full with denizens cheering on their respective teams, it also had sunlight streaming in on the bar stools and counter.  Not to mention the dog cushion out front (that was the clincher ;)\n\nThe interior is inviting and warm, probably due to the large expanse of windows in this place.  Wood floors, a long bar counter, and two panel tvs flanking the corners of the ceiling.  The only problem, was that the sun was reflecting on screens and there was no decent seating along the counter.  In addition to the dining floor area there was a raised area to the back, which floored a massive 73-inch flat panel.  And the game was about to start.\n\nLeave it to \"W\" to go forth and see if we were able to join the \"private party\" (waitress had told us beforehand) and the one and only man he had inquired with turned out to be the owner, who was most gracious in letting us sit up there.\n\nWe ordered the Salt and Pepper Fried Calamari with sweet tamarind dipping sauce and the Quesadilla appetizer.  Menu was pretty expansive for a bar menu, including thick hamburgers and salads for women watching their waistline (apparently I was not, since I ordered the quesadilla).  In addition to what was on tap, they had my fave pear cider!  Calamari was good, tender pieces of calamari breaded in a crunchy shell.  I think we preferred the traditional tartar/cocktail sauce so had to request that.  The quesadilla was so-so, but still thick with melted cheeses (I've been spoiled by quesadillas in the Mission)\n\nService was quick and courteous and being part of the owner's private party (in addition to the resident Bull Mastiff) was a great way to spend Superbowl Sunday.

I used to eat at The Bell Tower regularly.  It  wanted to be the typical neighborhood restaurant - comfort food prepared averagely, cozy confines, no need for reservations, relaxed atmosphere.  It also has some of the only outdoor seating in the entire Polk Gulch, a definite plus.  It was fine, average dining, overpriced to me, but then, most neighborhood restaurants along the Cow Hollow-Union St-Polk St axis are average and overpriced.  \n\nSo the second-to-last time I went I had a terrible dining experience.  The wait for service was long, and when the waiter came it turned out to be a surly douchebag who seemed to think that I worked for him.  Which, okay, the service has traditionally been very friendly there - maybe the manager had an off day hiring? \n\nFast forward a month later, my parents are in town from back East.  We have a few drinks, as is our custom.  We head to The Bell Tower for vittles. We sit.  And wait.  And wait.  About 10 minutes later, who should appear but The Surly Douchebag.  At this point we have all figured out what we want to eat.  Douchebag the Wonderwaiter asks for drink orders.  \n\nMy brother: I will have a vodka tonic, and I'm ready to make my entree order.  \nDbag: No you are not.  Right now I'm taking drink orders, and you all are going to give me the drink orders and I will come back for the entree orders.  \n\nI flipped.  I asked to see the manager.  Dbag pointed out the bartender as his manager.  As my parents gathered their things and went out to the street, I went up to the bar and got her attention.  As I began to complain, the woman looked at me like, why are you telling me this?  \nAre you the manager?  \nNo.  \nIs the manager here? \nNo.  \nWhen will the manager be here?  \nTomorrow.  \n\nSo aside from poor service and a bad attitude, Dbag the Wonderwaiter is a liar.  \n\nThe point being, this place is of marginal diner's utility to begin with.  The menu is boring, the preparation is average, and the prices are high.  Add in bad service, and the possible embarrassment of your parents/friends/colleagues being insulted, and you can ABSOLUTELY find a better meal in Polk Gulch.

I'm not a huge mac and cheese fan in general but I love chorizo so I had to try it. Server was extremely friendly, and made suggestions on drinks for my companions.", "author": "Julia R."}

Yummy!  The tea selection is pretty poor.  The BFF and I aren't the biggest fans of Stash but it made due and didn't ruin my dessert.\n\nCame here another time and had a savory dish, which was the chicken sandwich.  Pretty good but I don't know if I would pay for food that I can make at home.  Then again, if you're hungry and lazy, the Bell Tower definitely cooks up a good meal to keep you from starving.  I'm more partial to the desserts because they're tasty and rich but not too sweet.  It's a clean place with a bar as well, if you're into drinking and eating....perfect place to hang out and watch a game or two.  It's definitely, conveniently located on a corner so you can stumble in before or after an evening at the bar.  I'm quite interested in checking the Bell Tower out for breakfast or brunch because the selection does look promising...definitely up for paying them yet another visit.", "author": "Dorothy S."}

I saw the Bell Tower sign, bells and whistles went off and I made up our collective minds.  \n\nNone of us were disappointed in the food.  Me & F each had the quesadilla (ask for jalapenos.)   It was delicious, esp for a non-mexican place. And it was huge.   I totally forget what M ordered, but she loved it and I know I ate about half her fries.  They were the really skinny crispy ones, who can blame me?\n\nThe drinks were a bit, umm, weak.  But at that point, that was probably ok.  Perhaps they sensed our *level* and went weak on our respective vodkas and gins on purpose - after all, at one point, we were (very nicely) asked to *use [y]our inside voices.*\n\nGood mix of people.

One of these being The Bell Tower.\n\nFirst of all, the fact that this was recommended by Gill I already knew the food would be great as she knows her stuff. And it's a short walk to the Red Devil Lounge where we were heading off to after dinner.\n\nMy wife and friend were greeted at the door by one of the most friendly waitresses ever. She told us it would be a \"short twenty minute wait\" and as we glanced at the food being served up on the tables were sold that this would perfect for us. \n\nOur \"twenty minute\" wait turned into no more than 10 and were seated near the door. This sounds worse than it is, as the table was more than comfortable. Our waitress could tell that we were thirsty and took our drink orders right away. My wife was in a Manhattan mood, I asked our server if the bartender could put together a caipirinha. Not only could they make one, the caipirinhas were outstanding and included generous amounts of lime. Yes, I am a fan of limed.\n\nThe menu is a problem in that everything sounded delicious. Pizza, pulled pork sandwiches, seafood dishes, pork chops, steaks, pizza, truffled mac and cheese, beef stew and bbq ribs. Our heads were spinning at all the choices. \n\nMy wife has a weakness for bbq ribs and especially when they come with French fries. My friend went with the salmon and I the pork cop. I also requested the truffled mac n cheese for the table to share. My pork chop was cooked to perfection and a generous double cut. The side dishes included a bread with apple and blue cheese and southern greens. My wife commented that the pork chop was one of the best she had ever tasted, and I have to agree. It was amazing. The sides complimented the pork perfectly I cant speak for our friends salmon as I don't eat seafood but judging by the way he pulled a Hoover vacuum cleaner and sucked that thing down within seconds of hitting the table I would say it must have been pretty dang good. My wife raved about the bbq ribs and each time I tried to snatch a fry off her plate would get the evil stare. Again this is a good sign that her dish was better than excellent.\n\nThe service could not have been better as our server checked on us frequently during the meal and made certain that all of our needs were met. She also had an outstanding fun-loving attitude which made our experience that much better.\n\n$111 dinner for 3 with 4 cocktails, 1 beer, 1 glass if wine. Excellent value!\n\nThanks to Gill C for recommending The Bell Tower!", "author": "Rene C."}

Our orders were large, our table went to town splitting stellar mac and cheese and pork nachos while the rest of us respectively ordered a burger, tuna tacos, escargot (yummy yummy butter garlic sauce), french onion soup, and a wedgie salad.

I had to ask for bread again after not getting it the first time, and then - never got it. I had to ask for mayo twice. I had to ask for refills, my husband got his but I didnt get mine. I had to ask for a to go box twice.

I don't remember specifics about that night (except for the nice Irish man that chatted with me ALL night and then never called! Bastard!) but the bartender was great, she served all of us drunks until we could barely stand and then sent us on our merry drunken way at about 3:30 a.m. to stumble up to the pizza place on Polk that stays open to feel us drunkards. \n\nThe 2nd was last Saturday where we stopped with a large group to buy a birthday boy shots and beers and hang out! The waiter was nice and let us push tables together for us all to sit and drink at! (Actually he insisted that we do it!) This impressed me since people were still eating and he was basically giving up tips by letting is invade his space! The drinks are not a bad deal (4 bucks for a cider beer), and the bar tender is still the nice lady I remember from last time! \n\nOn another interesting note: There was an orgy going on, on the patio behind me. I guess 2 ladies (one in very questionable attractiveness) and a man decided that it was a superb idea to begin a 3 way make out session right behind my head (my back was to the front glass window) so it was kind of awkward until I figured out what was going on. I felt like I had something on my face because it looked like half the bar was staring at me.

And extra especially one that has a cobb salad on the menu.  The perfect food.  Completely impossible to mess up it involves all of my favorite things, bacon, cheese and crunchy veggie's so I can feel like I'm being healthy. Given a full bar and a cobb salad, anyone who knows me would think there was no way possible for a place to get less then three stars.\n\nSo let's take a moment to look at just how this amazing feat of disgust was accomplished.\n\nFirst, I must say that I have heard about how bad this place is and had absolutely NO intention of going here.  I was on my way to Nick's Crunchy Taco Happiness which was closed for Easter.\n\nHmm... I thought traffic was a little light that sunday.\n\nAny-who. After walking around the area, seeing everything closed for Easter, getting worried about making it to Red Devil to see Colin Hay, I see that The Bell Tower is open.\n\nCue ominous music.\n\nI order a cosmo from my overly chipper waitress.  I'm in the mood for something a little tart, so I even ask for Charbay vodka for a little extra kick.  Some strange game of telephone ensues between myself, the waitress and the bartender and I find myself with a sirupy sweet Kamikaze.  Oh. No. Way.  This is WAY to close to the Marina for this type of mistake to be made.  Unfortunately, Colin is waiting so I smile and go back to my day dream in which I slap the chirp out of the waitress and keep the drink.\n\nThen the food arrives.  My partner ordered the burger.  It was... well.... in his words \"OK I guess\".  That is slightly less tasty then just \"OK.\"  He's nearly as picky about his burgers as I am about my cosmos so you can take that how ever you like.  \n\nMy Cobb Salad however will go down in history as the Cobb Salad that broke my faith in the Cobb Salad Religion.  And on Easter Sunday no less!  I knew the chicken was going to be fried.  I'm ok with that.  I like me the fried chicken.  However, I had assumed that they would at least blotted the grease off it before plopping it down on an overly dressed, under bacon'd pile of greens.  I felt like I would have had a healthier meal at McDonalds.\n\nWe finally got our check from a waitress, ours having figured her job was over after she took our order had gone on to spread her chipper self elsewhere, and ran down to Red Devil and my date with Colin who made me feel immensely better. Not only can that man sing, he's funny and it's hard to dwell on bad food when you're doing a spit take with a (real) cosmo.", "author": "Cosmolicious L."}

This afternoon I was there with two friends so we took a regular table.  What followed was such an unpleasant experience that not only did I try to lodge a complaint (the waitress proceeded to cut me off and argue with me and no \"manager\" was available when I asked) but we left a small tip and none of us will return.  Too bad for the Bell Tower.\n\nAs I see from other reviews, the \"waitress with the long black hair\" has not only thrown her piss-poor attitude our way.  Why is she still working there?  We waited FOREVER to get our drinks, to begin.  Everything was delivered to the table with a curt or short comment.  We waited for the second round of drinks until our meal was more than half done, and when my friend got up to inquire (we had already asked about them once before) she was told, \"Why don't you sit down so I can bring them to you?\"  Nice.  We also ordered a side of guac which never arrived and yet we were charged for.  When we pointed this out, she just disappered with the check.  No \"sorry about that\".  God forbid.\n\nI worked in the bar and restaurant industry for several years and many of my friends still do.  We enjoy going out, are friendly and good to our servers and always tip a solid 20% or higher.  We are not high maintenance (unless wanting to receive what you order and not pay for things you don't get counts as being difficult.)  \n\nIf it's shitty attitude, arguments, and a hard time you're looking for, you should do well to visit the Bell Tower.  Personally, for my time and money, I will visit any of the numerous other destinations on Polk St in the future and skip this place all together.

I've convinced myself to go back because I'm obsessed with their chorizo burrito, but every time I end up kicking myself in the end because the service is so terrible- might even be the worst Ive experienced in SF. \n\nThe last time I was there the food took about an hour and 15 minutes, we didn't get drink orders taken until 30 minutes after we were seated, we were desperate to get our waters re-filled but it was impossible to get our waiters attention (and it WASNT EVEN BUSY). I ordered a side of fruit and ended up getting a chopped up bruised banana. I'm sorry, but I'm not about to eat a piece of brown fruit. Try again.\n\nOne of my friends ordered a tea and and the lid to her tea pot was a shot glass that still had remnants of whiskey in it. Um...is this a joke?

Nope, that definitely was not the case. \n\nAnd then there was the bill....ohhhhh dear lord...the BILLL....I don't even want to remember how long that took to get. \n\nEveryone I was with, including myself, went delirious at the table because we had been sitting and waiting for so long for everything.

There are plenty of bars to meet people, listen to music, or rub up against the other sex while horrible techno music thumps through your ears, and The Bell Tower is not one of those places. \n\nIt serves food late, typically until midnight, which means it retains a dinning room feel well into the evening. The ambiance is subdued and their are usually a few colorful characters hoisted onto stools at the bar. It has a very local pub feel, where conversation is easy and the lights are dim. \n\nThe food is tasty, albeit nothing to rave about specifically.

I also had a spinach salad with walnuts, blue cheese, and thick cut crumbled bacon. It was all solid. Nothing mind blowing, but just what the doctor ordered. My buddy had the burger and I tried it, also very juicy, flavorful meat and on an interesting not quite foccacia, but cousin of foccacia type roll. \n\nThe place just had a nice warm vibe to it, and I felt at home.

I had been the the BT many times and had a great experience when I dined that late night.\n\nThe service is hit or miss - we had two servers that were kind of switching off and one was excellent and the other blew... but it was a great meal and relatively inexpensive for a sit down restaurant. \n\nEvery time I come to Bell Tower I have a new appreciation for it - most recently and now at the top of my list of good qualities is that it serves dinner late.

Perfect for a day sitting in the sun outside.\n\nSo, gal pal and I are super excited. So, we get to the Bell Tower, sun shining and all, and look at the menu. Where's the $15 bottle of champagne? Apparently, it doesn't exist. OKKKK, I guess our friend was wrong. We can deal. \n\nSo we tell our waitress - we'd like the $30 bottle of champagne (cheapest they have), plus a carafe of OJ. We plan on drinking a lot here. Celebrating the new year and all. Yada yada. She laughs... then disappears. No champagne. No OJ. Nothing.\n\nI think our waitress quit us. A new girl comes out and takes our food order. Our food arrives before our champagne. Where's the champagne we ask? Oh, our champagne cooler broke. I'm chilling the champagne for you in ice. OK, but we're almost done with our brunch.\n\nSo finally we get the champagne. Food is taken away. Can we have a carafe of OJ to go with the champagne? The waitress doesn't understand our request. We'd like to make mimosas. Can we order some orange juice to mix in?\n\nA few minutes later... the waitress walks out with OJ in a tiny coffee creamer cup. Not even a big coffee creamer cup. TINY.

Great drinks, burgers, nachos, etc.    Top notch service there with a lot of local \"color\", so to speak.  Branched out to the tables when I was there with my family.  Still pretty ok, but a decided difference in the drink and service quality.  \n\nFast forward to today.  Forget about it.  I sat adjacent to the bar and there was such a HUGE discrepancy in what I was being served vs. the people at the bar that it was disgraceful.

Overall there will be something- some item on the menu, a place to sit, a cool bartender, just some little quirk that will make you want to come back here. And you'll keep coming back here. But you might ask yourself why.\n\nI first came here eons ago with a friend of mine who no longer lives in the neighborhood. She had The Magic Bell Tower Touch meaning it could be a balmy Sunday afternoon on Polk and as soon as she would saunter up to The Bell Tower poof! one of the coveted outdoor tables would open up. I hadn't returned in forever but I recently came for brunch and a girls pow wow. Both times were popping and let me tell you, the acoustics inside can be pretty bad depending on where you sit. You might find yourself shouting \"what?\" more than once during your meal. \n\nThe food is the primary draw. I like many folks am partial to the french onion soup. Seriously, french onion soup is right up there with clam chowder and pho for combating the chilly inner cold a strong misty fog can bring on and they do a killer job with their thick warm gooey crust and fat soup soaked chunks of bread sopping throughout the broth. The pulled pork sandwich is quite tasty and I found it to be a few steps better than the chicken with brie sandwich my friend got. Ditto for the option of spring mix as opposed to fries. The mac and cheese with truffle oil was ten shades of rich, heavy cheese goodness. Yes, the accompanying spring mix eased a bit of my guilt (because let's face it when you choose mac and cheese with truffle oil you're not exactly all up for health conscious decisions no?) but the mac and cheese was so heavy and filling I only got through half. My friends went for equally delicious choices of potato skins and chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Sadly, the friend who didn't throw caution to the wind and ordered a caesar salad was seriously disappointed. I couldn't blame her. The salad itself looked a little sad and uber white iceburgy (if you can understand that). Both occasions called for some drinks and I enjoyed both the white wine I shared with the ladies and the bloody mary that accompanied my brunchy sandwich.  \n\nMy only complaint is that service is a little hit or miss. The waiter we had for ladies night of planning was nice, accommodating and attentive in our wine selection. The waitress on brunch day was not as great until she cheered up mid meal. It was also distressing to arrive a half hour before brunch ended (according to the signs) and told that in order to have brunch we would have to \"try and find a seat\" in the overflowing bar by the host. A little irksome but not detrimental to a decent experience. Lively atmosphere.\n\nP.S. In the bathrooms, the hand dryer is next to the sink and the paper towels are right behind you.

We were both incredibly satisfied with the food. I am a bit hesitant when ordering veggie burgers because they are usually just a Garden/Boca burger with some extra stuff, and usually not worth the $9. But this was really good. I would order it again. The fries were perfectly, well, fried--not too greasy and I ate all of them. \n\nThe second time I went, I shared a pizza and a salad with the bf. We both were excited to go again because of how yummy our first trip was. I actually preferred the salad over the pizza...\n\nAnd today, the third time: I got the Atlas omelet and he got the Blue Omelet. His looked great--blue cheese, bacon, avo, tomato...And the egg was completely cooked. Mine however, was not. I am NOT a fan of runny eggs, soggy or undercooked eggs in any way. I really only eat omelets and scrambles. I was truly disappointed to be served an omelet that fell apart on its own: it was runny and very bland. I added a lot of salt & pepper and hot sauce...but still, I ended up leaving about half the egg. On the plus side, it was stuffed with a LOT of spinach & mushrooms, and really, just small amount of feta (which I prefer to avoid overly greasy food). Surprisingly the feta couldn't add enough salt or savory flavor to save the egg. The potatoes served with it were soggy and a bit cold. And that is definitely a sad thing: home fries should be crisp and a little spicy and flavorful...these were not.\n\nI would go back, but I would not order breakfast foods. I like the ambiance although today was a bit loud (it's football Sunday, afterall). The outdoor seating is always taken but next time I'll wait for it...and stick to the sandwiches...The service was pretty slow today, and even though it cleared out by the time we finished we had to beg for the check after twenty minutes.

The food coming out of the kitchen looked good so we were excited to get our meal. I got the chicken sandwich and fries while the lady friend got the macaroni and cheese. My sandwich tasted like fish, so I'm assuming the grill is rarely cleaned and tasted pretty terrible. The fries we're tasty, but it's really hard to fuck up fries. They were a little undercooked and I had to pick and choose which ones were crispy. My g/f mac and cheese was tasteless and was soupy, which should never be the case with this type of food. We played a game of adding condiments to the bland dish to see if the additions made it taste any better. It didn't really add much to it. I thought that my first visit to my neighborhood bar and eatery would have been a great experience, but wasn't. It was just tasteless and lazy.

Definitely has a \"neigborhood\" vibe, and I know if I lived nearby, you'd find me there.  Not a sports bar per-se, but they've got 3 excellent and well placed TVs playing the main games of the day.

As I enjoyed my Steam Anchor and local company I found out that the owner of the Restaurant/Bar is originally from MN and that many MN fans that have moved to SF also meet up weekly for Viking games at Bell Tower.

My dinner companion had recommended it, and, backed up by my yelpsearch, I felt fairly confident going in. I'm not sure if it qualifies as a neighborhood bar with a great starters/salad/dinner menu, or as a neighborhood restaurant with an extended bar section! The bar area blends into the restaurant area seamlessly. Sometimes, a little tooooo seamlessly.\n\nI'm not fond of the drunken rowdies, and my minor encounter with three of them in the curtained alcove outside the restroom solidified my opinion. WITH THAT SAID, I really liked the place! Friendly bartender (co-owner), friendly waitress Megan (we discussed the movie \"Half Nelson\") and a friendly bartender from another restaurant who came to visit (Greg). Casual environment; and really easy to get a table, even though it was 9:00 on a Saturday night with great weather!! \n\nI misordered my drink, so I left it at the bar. Not the fault of the bartender at all. That's on me. My dinner companion enjoyed his martini thoroughly. Dinner was comfort food. I ordered the stuffed chicken breast, which came with whipped potatoes and snowpeas. I can't tell you exactly what the chicken was stuffed with, but I do remember that it involved spinach, tomatoes and onion. It was all gooood. My friend ordered a full rack of baby back ribs, which was prepared with a hoisin sauce. They were accompanied by french fries and cole slaw. He ate every single rib, neatly I must say, and declared: \"You know when a black man likes your ribs they're great ribs.\" He said the trick is in the pre-boiling; gets the pork more tender, and it comes off the bone easier. We also split a dessert: a chocolate cake thing with two scoops of ice cream and a little bit of sauce (not caramel, not chocolate, what was it? I forget but it was overly sweet for me). I'm glad the cake wasn't swimming in it.\n\nFACTOIDS: Parking is horrendous, so I twirled around for a while, and ended up paying $10.00 to park at the Pacific & Polk parking set-up.  And happy to do so! Basically, these guys in fluorescent serapes take over a small business lot and park your car for you. The car can stay til 9am! So if I was planning to stay until the wee hours, this would have been a good place to stow my car. What is great about this place is that because it's a bar, it's open until 2am, and the kitchen is open until midnight!\n\nI delete one star because of the bathroom. Not only is it unmarked, but it was a complete mess. It would be advisable to institute an hourly check on this place. Because it appears to be the only bathroom, it gets really thrashed.\n\nBill: For 2, including a couple of rounds of drinks, and a shared dessert, tax and tip: $70.00.

I didn't even have ability to ask the name of the horrific waiter who verbally assaulted me and my friend.  And, no, this isn't one of those ridiculous reviews where somebody tries to be pedantic a know-it-all-ish--I'm not talking food here (it was yummy and all that stuff, very Apple bee's with an edge, but sometimes that's what I want and I would have been happy with it).\nWe ordered around ten, and, though the place was clearing out, there were still seven or eight tables of people eating dinner.  So we ordered our wine at the bar and sat at a table by the window and ordered our food.  Twenty minutes later our conversation was was interrupted by the bartender (who I think meant well) waving his hands and saying \"who-hoo, girls.\"  This was followed by the unthinkable: a waiter yelling across the restaurant (THE WAITER) saying, \"HEY, GIRLS, PAY ATTENTION.\"  To WHAT?  To the wait-staff NOT Waiting on customers but yelling at them?\nOur food was waiting at the bar, and so we went and got it--all three plates--it's not like we didn't order anything worthy of proper waiting, either...if that was his thought process...\nHumiliated and shocked, I put the plates down and promptly said the obvious: \"I don't want to eat this, or pay for this, or be here.  I can't believe someone just spoke to a CUSTOMER like that.\"  At this point I decided there must be some misunderstanding, and yeah, pretty pissed off, I walked over to the waiter and said, \"Hi, if you expect customers to pick up their own orders you should tell them that when they order.\"  Guess what he said?  \"I didn't take your order, you can leave.\"\nEnough said.\nSo, sadly, this might have been one waiter and the rest might be great (after reading other reviews, though, it doesn't sound like it.)  Even more sadly, it doesn't matter.  I haven't been that mad in a long, long time.  I was seeing red, I still am.  I'm nearly thirty, I'm not a GIRL and I don't care how old someone looks, you don't ever YELL at them when they've just purchased a fifty dollar meal (or call them GIRL or just generally act like a jerk).  Screw this place, I'd rather eat dirt than set foot in this  place.  Some body needs to buy an etiquette book, tie it to a brick and throw in through the window.  While I'd happily do the throwing, I wouldn't waste my money on a book or string.", "author": "Jamie H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-05-21", "description": "5/21/08 12:25pm\n\nDear Barbara, \n\nI can not tell you how upset I am with your restaurant. The experience was truly horrible. I came here with a friend for dinner last night and I swear, I wanted to strangle one of your servers. She was an Asian chick, roughly 5'3, long black hair who has freckles on her face ... I walk in, wait almost 10 minutes before I walk over to the bar and ask one of the servers if we were supposed to write our names down. She told me to hold -- which i did, but after 5 mins, I ask again, and she snapped at me saying to wait. STRIKE 1. My friend and I walk back to the front, and we wait... There was an empty table right next to us. Then, the girl comes over asking how many people. I kindly tell her 2, and she said it's a 20 minute wait. I ask her if we could sit at the table next to us and she said no. a FIRM no with an attitude. STRIKE 2. I understand your restaurant is located in Snob Hill, but she didn't have to come off snobby... I ask her why not, and she said something that i didn't expect. \"If a party with more than 3 people come, they get the table.\" \"Did they make a reservation?\" \"No, but just 20 minutes because I don't want to move your food and clean the table.\" STRIKE 3. I can totally understand if reservations were made but it wasn't... But then again, I thought that's part of the tipping process, is it not? We could've easily left but after waiting 15 minutes and finding another 10 minutes to find parking, we didn't feel like finding another place... i couuld not believe how she did not want to seat us because she didn't feel like wiping the table. Is that the way your restaurant is run? I highly doubt it. I love dogs, and one of the reasons my friend suggested this place is simply because he has been a frequent flyer at your place telling me that your restaurant is comforting American food. I am a foodie. I am a diner. Thankfully YELP has given me the chance to bitch about the horrendous service I've encountered. On the other hand, our server was truly pleasant -- she was this young British gal, in her late 20s with glasses, full of smiles, and very accomodating, every other word was \"CHEERS!\" I swear when i write this, the Asian girl has seriously got to watch her potty mouth.  Your $16.50 Baby Back Hoison BBQ Ribs were pretty tasty, but I wasn't really digging your cole slaw...My friend's $20 special of a roasted hen with a side of broccoli and spanish rice was good.. the broccoli was superb, never had i had such fresh broccoli in ages! I have to admit, I was really pleased with the variety of food Bell Tower served from sandwiches, pizza, and bar food ...  I can't help but to give you a guys a 1 star because the service totally made me speechless, perhaps you can retrain her on what customer service is...Anyhow, I don't know if I would want to give Bell Tower a 2nd chance... As an owner of the restaurant, I hope you can take my review and the many others who have rated this place with low ratings as constructive criticism, as it is nothing personal, but maybe to the server it is... All in all, I wish you the very best in the future in hiring friendlier servers ... \n\n\nYours truly,\nJ", "author": "Jennifer S."}

I went here wanting to get some old fashion American style ribs.. I walked inside and the waitresses were just talking to each other and i stood inside for awhile and then i was fed up so I asked the bar tender \"Eric\" if he could help me with my order. He gave me a menu and I looked at the ribs that I wanted, and he said \"I'm sorry sir, but we aren't serving dinner until 5\" he said \"but if you want ribs just order 2 rib appetizers.\" Eric was very helpful so i didn't mind tipping 6 bucks for my take out order... But the food kinda sucked.. The fries were good... and the coleslaw was tasty too, But the ribs were not the tender fall of the bone ribs but more like cardboard stuck to a big stick and covered with a maple syrup barbecue sauce..

Hence the three stars when it should probably be two. It takes a lot to get me to write a review when I've been living in LA for six months (i've heard enough) and I barely had time to visit SF much less write about it, but I feel like I have to say something.  So the first time I went here, we got served after roughly twenty minutes with no silverware. Hey, no prob, its late (8). \"Excuse me can we have some silverware?\" (Nod). 5 minutes of staring at my salad. \"Excuse me (I'm asking a different person) can we get a couple forks when you have a chance? (in a very sweet tone)?\" No response.  About eight full minutes staring at our food, until I get up, walk to the side station and get myself some silverware. Putting food down without utensils is pretty high on the list of waitressing f**k ups, I know because i've done it. But you can bet I sprinted/hurtled to resolve that awkward situation when i was serving. Ive been here three times. Twice we were asked what we were ordering to see if we were allowed to sit at the tables (the place was not full). Once with a party of  eight we were instructed to \"take out our IDs and hand them to the bartender.\" Everyone except me was approaching 30.

The appetizers are one of the best things about this place.  It is definitely relaxed, comfortable and spacious, plus it has a decent number of beers on tap.  It's great for a chill night or a place to start out post-work, especially if you're with a group of friends.  It's got an interesting, eclectic crowd, three tvs, and a ridiculously huge chair that looks like it was made from a crown royal bag.  \nI recommend the tuna tacos, which are made with ahi tuna and a semi-spicy remoulade (they're delicious, even for a girl who's not crazy about seafood).  The chicken sandwich is a pretty solid lunch option too.  I hear their burgers are delicious and a friend of mine is slightly obsessed with their potato boats.  Stick to the apps & sandwiches though - they are more solid than the entrees.\nIf you're sitting down, the service is a little hit or miss.  You'll usually have more than one waitress, which is great.  Some of the waitresses are awesome.  I've had one or two that were a little inattentive and one who was downright unfriendly.
