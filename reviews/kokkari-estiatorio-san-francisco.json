This is one of the absolute best restaurants in the city, if you have never tried it I recommend you change that as soon as possible. \n\nI used to take clients all the time for lunch, especially when it was hard to get someone out of the office and then you name drop Kokkari and all of a sudden you have a full table.\n\nEVERYTHING on this menu is PHENOMENAL! :) My mouth is watering just writing this, the fried cheese is a fan favorite and if you like cheese how could you go wrong?  The hummus and spreads are pretty good, I must admit though that I do not like their hummus but the green dip (Maybe spanakopita) with the feta is  TO DIE FOR.  I normally order the chicken Slavonkia (I think how you spell it) and get the other dip as my side instead of what it came with which I definitely recommend.\n\nThey normally change the apps and specials (which they have soooo many amazing fish dishes and they come out as a full fish and they can de-bone it for you upon request). The salads have always been tasty in my opinion too.\n\nThey don't have too many vegetarian dishes, but you can definitely make it work. They have a ravioli and some of the shared apps and sides and salads definitely provide enough options but it would be a shame because the meat they serve is fantastic.  The Lamb Chops are out of this world, everyone raves about them and they are definitely the best in the city.  The lamb burger is great as well.\n\nI personally love the Turkish coffee and they have good desserts although I normally try to avoid them at that point because I am so full from everything else.  Very Reliable spot for work dinners, events and for friends and family in town, dates etc.  It has a romantic environment but can be hard to get a reservation if you do not book in advance.

They take reservations two (yes 2!) months in advance. If you want a table plan ahead. Otherwise get there early and sit at the bar. You will still spend the same money sitting at the bar so I'd recommend a table. \n\nMonday night the place was booming. Jammed. Great vibe. My wife and I spent 3 weeks in Greece late June early July and we longed for authentic Greek food besides what I turn out of my own kitchen. So we went. In general it was excellent. Not a \"5\" but a strong 4. So why wasn't it a 5?\n\nFirst, the restaurant is lovely inside. Tons of money spent to a high standard designed to look like you're in an upscale restaurant in Athens (Grand Bretagne). But it's not overdone or flashy - very tasteful. Great vibe and hostess, servers, all others very attentive.\n\nSecond, the food. I can't say much more than my fellow Yelpers have already. Yes, try the lamb, try the chicken ( it's not just Chicken it's Greek Chicken Served with tasty orzo and fasolikia, Greek style green beans. Yum. Try almost any appetizer- try 3-or 4 they aren't big portions though they aren't priced as small. So was looking forward to the octopus-- usually done with olive oil, garlic, S&P.\nA bummer because for $17 we got a chewy rubbery dish. Ugh and unbecoming a restaurant of this caliber. If they can't get the good stuff they should not sell it. Period. ( if you're in NYC go to Kellari Grill on W 44th between 5th and 6th. None better ever. They fly it in every day from Greece.)\n\nNext--the Moussaka was dense, heavy, the bechamel sauce was as think as mashed potatoes. The base which is always potato was way too thick - the eggplant almost non existent. \n\nAnd they still got a 4? Yup. Cause everything else was stellar. So bottom line- do not order Moussaka or octopus-- not that big a deal. You'll love the place. \n\nExtensive and Expensive wine list. Fantastic selection of world wines including local\nNapa favorites. Ask your server where he/she thinks the values are -/ they know. \n\nDesserts-- the loukoumades ( little doughnuts) are to die for. The Baklava is good. Not great. In all of Greece you order and get a large piece that's dripping in honey, butter, loaded with walnuts --\nThis version was a little dry. \n\nThe \"nits\" are just the things that kept it from getting the top score. Not a reason not to go.", "author": "Greg C."}

Constantly people walking around and getting up, moving around, coming and going, but nicely lit place with homey decor. There's a fireplace-looking rotisserie in the back that happened to be radiating just a little bit too much heat though so it was toasty in there (I thought my fever was back until I checked in with the others who were also warm).\n\nFood: 4/5: Food was very impressive. Everything was fresh, with interesting textures and flavors. Here's what we ordered:\n- Octopus: Really good, but just a bit tough for my liking. served with lemon\n- Saghanaki: Basically, a thin layer of ooey gooey, pan-fried cheese. Delicious. Perfect with the table bread and peppers\n- Peppers: i think this was the special of the evening, shishito peppers that were flavorful and cooked perfectly.\n- Grilled whole branzino: amazing. Perfectly seasoned and grilled; found a few bones but that's to be expected, just eat carefully. \n- Lamb Chops: SO good. I agree with the other reviews on here that these were not gamey at all and didn't even really taste like lamb. More of a fatty steak. Got them on the rare side and they were tender, juicy and amazing. \n- Baklava and Baklava ice cream were pretty good but nothing amazing.\n\nService: 5/5: waitress was attentive and friendly, explained the specials, made recommendations, and kept our glasses filled with delicious greek white wine. \n\nHighly recommend!", "author": "Priyanka C."}

It now has a special place in my heart and here's why: the ambiance, the food, and the attentive staff. Please feel free to read on for more deets\n\nThe soft glow from the lamps scattered restaurant-wide, oriental rugs under sturdy wooden tables, upholstered chairs which conveniently hid my monstrosity of a dufflebag, & ginormous bread getting toasty by the fireplace-turned roaster, which in turn rotated glossy, yummy-smelling proteins, contributed to the lush and cozy atmosphere. \n\nI decided to order 4 Mezethes (small plates) and 1 Dessert: *Pantzaria beet salad (red beets, Greek yogurt, dill, olive oil, green onions, and chopped pistachio nuts), Soutzoukakia lamb meatballs, *Kolokithoukeftethes zucchini cakes (crispy exterior with flavorful shredded zucchini interior, I wish I knew the spices used -it was that good), *Octapodaki tou Yiorgou octopus (boiled, blanched, and grilled for a perfect, tender bite), sweet corn salad (sweet corn, dill, feta, and arugula), and baklava and praline ice cream. The items with the asterisks were my favorites. \n\nMy friend had left dinner early for a concert & I decided to stay awhile alone in a restaurant by myself (yes, you heard right ALONE as in table for 1). Those yummy leftovers wouldn't be able to eat themselves, now would they? And, after learning that my friend would be leaving, the host encouraged me to stay until I was ready & that there was no need to rush. The initial fear of what others might think of my eating by myself eventually turned into a giddiness of being able to check an item off the bucket list earlier than I expected. In my effort to truly relish this opportunity of eating alone, I thought about all the things I was thankful for in that moment in time. The food, the warmth from sitting fireside, and the lovely sanctuary that Kokkari provided. \n\nAfter having had such a heart-warming meal, I was then ushered out by a \"Goodnight\" and that he'd hoped I would visit again.

Problem is, finding a reservation for a normal dinner time without much notice is near impossible. (I'm not the best at committing.) Finally, on Friday, February 23rd, I came here for a friend's birthday. I believe he made reservations about six weeks prior for our party of six at 10pm.\n\n*Meat Dolmathes - grape leaves stuffed with lamb, rice, dill & mint ($16)\n*Kolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing ($12.25)\n*Spanakotiropita - traditional filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill ($10.25)\n*Octapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil ($17.75)\n*Garides Skordates - wood-oven roasted prawns with feta butter & Kalamata olives ($17.25)\n*Soutzoukakia - grilled lamb meatballs with spiced tomato sauce & Greek yogurt ($14.35)\n*Psari Psito - traditional grilled whole fish with horta & lemon, Lavraki - Sea Bass ($47)\n*Ippoglossa - halibut steak pan roasted with black lentil salata, roasted grapes, artichokes & pomegranate ($38.25)\n*Arnisia Paidakia - grilled lamb chops with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes ($47.50)\n*Goat Stew Special ($38)\n\nMy favorite dish, hands down, was the rack of lamb. Super meaty and flavorful. Even the bday boy who doesn't like lamb enjoyed all the lamb dishes at Kokkari. (I guess he finds it too gamey.) I also adored the octopus and prawns. The octopus was tender with a nice chew. The head on prawns were great for sucking. I do love them delicious head juices. The sauce was also amazing. Great for bread dipping. I'm not eating deep fried foods right now, so I couldn't try the zucchini cakes. Everyone seemed to enjoy them though. They start the meal with complimentary bread and special olive oil from Crete, which is a treat.\n\n*Baklava - Traditional walnut & honey baklava with vanilla-praline ice cream ($10.50)\n*Galaktoboureko - Semolina custard in filo with fresh Meyer lemon spoon sweet & pistachio ice cream ($10.75)\n*Loukoumades - Traditional Greek doughnuts with honey, cinnamon & walnuts ($10)\n*Rye Manhattan: up ($13.50) x2\n*Old Fashioned ($12.50) x3\n*Bulleit Rye ($12)\n*Turley, Old Vines Zinfandel, California '15 ($52 bottle)\n*Graham's 10 year Tawny Port ($12)\n*Blandy's Malmsey Madeira 10 Year ($13)\n*Fonseca 20 Year Tawny ($15)\n*Greek Coffee - Stone-ground coffee heated over hot sand, Sketo for no sugar ($6)\n\nWe all started with one cocktail each for the apps and then had a bottle of red to share with our mains. I believe the sommelier helped us pick out the zin as we weren't sure what to order. It worked perfectly with our mixture of meat and fish as we had one in our party who wasn't eating meat. Dessert was a sweet treat. I couldn't eat some of it since it was deep fried, but the baklava was definitely tasty. I adored the ice cream. I got the 10 year tawny port to pair which I enjoyed.\n\nSuch an awesome spot for a birthday celebration. Between the food, the service, and the drinks, I was amazed. So glad I finally tried out this spot!", "author": "Elena N."}

We're new parents, it was our one night out and we had reservations; 30 min is a long time to wait. Not to mention the bar area is full and crowded so waiting there wasn't an option. \n\nThe lamb is delicious but at $40ish, pretty pricey. The fish although cooked well and a nice piece, was not good, topped with a tomato sauce and olives. Personally, I just didn't think all the flavors meshed well.\n\nThe apps were good, nothing to write home about, but enjoyed. The pita with the dip was amazing, another order of pita costs you $4. \n\nThe donuts for dessert were delicious! \n\nWe wrote in our reservation and I also told the hostess it was my husbands birthday and they did nothing. That, plus seating us close to 30 min after our rez, kind of not the best customer service. \n\nThe place is beautiful, and the food is good, but the popularity detracts from a real authentic and relaxing experience and doesn't guarantee an on time reservation. \n\nOverall, def a worthy spot to try, but I wouldn't put it up there as a top SF restaurant.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

The service is stellar and you leave your dining experience feeling happy that you chose to eat there, every single time!\n\nFor appetizers, I've tried them all, you can't go wrong, just pick what catches your fancy (my favorite is the anginares souvlaki). For main meal, their oven roasted branzino or rib-eye are my go-to picks. For dessert, I would get the yiaourti granita but only because Evvia doesn't offer that on their menu. If I would be picking based on my favorite, get the sundae.

We went with entrees and only one appetizer.  The appetizer was great (lamb and rice dolmas).  The entrees were not.  I had moussaka which was not at all like moussaka I have had before.  It was just a bunch of flavors mashed together more like a stew. It was hard to make out the egg plant since it was over cooked and hard to even find the taste.  My wife had the lamb shoulder special which again was simply like a stew with no distinct flavors that stood out.  Each serving was too large really for one person which the waitress should have told us.  And the arugula and peach salad was terrible. Very small and consisted of a handful of arugula, tasteless peach and a lite drizzle of dressing.  To be honest, I wouldn't have served what we ordered to friends if I did a dinner at home.\n\nThe best way to order at this restaurant is to only order off the appetizer menu and avoid the entrees.\n\nAnd be prepared for a costly meal.  2 glasses of wine each, one dessert plus what I described above came to almost $200 before tip.  Also, be prepared to not get the table we got and instead get a small table among a crowded room of many small tables. Quite noisy and caverness. We won't be going back.

Confess!!! Ok, ok, ok... stop already. I can't take it anymore. I do love Mediterranean food. There, I said it. Now that I have that weight off my shoulders we can move on to the wonderful experience we had at Kokkari Estiatorio. We were in San Francisco for the Bridge to Bridge run and had heard wonderful things about Kokkari. We had made a reservation in advance and were pleased to be seated close to our arrival. The dining room is spacious and decorated with a warm Mediterranean aesthetic. There was a feeling of excitement as servers move constantly among the tables attending to each party's needs. We intently studied the menu and had a hard time deciding on our choices. Everything sounded so good that we decided to share so we would all have a chance to sample everything. Yay! We started with a combination of dips including melitzanosalata (a delicious eggplant dip), tzatziki, and favaslata (made from yellow split peas) and served with house made grilled pita. All three were exquisite. Our next choice was the kolokithokeftethes. These are zucchini cakes served with a cucumber mint yogurt dressing. We all agreed later after finishing this wonderful meal that this dish was the first among equals in our selections. Unexpected when we ordered but definitely our favorite at the end. Next came the dolmathes which were excellent with the traditional grape leaves stuffed with a tasty mixture of rice, dill, and mint. We then had the kalamari. This was grilled calamari stuffed with feta and herbs and served with a roasted tomato and and eggplant relish. Some of us then had the soutzoukakia which are grilled lamb meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce with a greek yogurt. This got rave reviews from those who sampled this dish. Our next taste adventure on this Mediterranean culinary excursion was the garides skordates. These were wood-oven roasted prawns with feta butter and kalamata olives. The feta and olive taste combined with the roasted prawns was great. Do we need more? Oh, there are so many more choices! Next we had the makaronia which is a ravioli of ricotta and zucchini with vegetables,  pine nuts, and goat cheese. This was a very nice complement to our other choices. The last dish in the series of main course options was the petri posto, the whole grilled fish. A nicely grilled flaky white fish that had a really good flavor. Finally, we selected a few desserts to share since we clearly did not get enough to eat yet. The rizogalo is a fantastic dish with arborio rice pudding with honey glazed fruit. A delightful sugary sensation. Our other choice was the fruit tart which was a very nice tart with ice cream. Wow! Stick a fork in us. We were done. This was a great dinner experience. We all were marveling at every dish and how fantastic everything had been as we were leaving.

Located in the Financial District (FiDi) of San Francisco, this special and distinguishing Greek cuisine is pinnacle of Greek cuisine in the City by the Bay.\n\nPerfect in every respect, I have dined here for years as a long time San Franciscan. Every guest I host, over the many years, all rave about the refined yet causal ambiance, great service and the delicious dishes.  Their lamb dishes are extraordinary. Period.\n\nThe lamb shank, lamb skewers and riblets are amazing. Tables frequently order another round of these local favorites. Walking is easy if in the FiDi as is ride sharing services. Valet is an option as well although I rarely if ever drive in this very walkable City.\n\nDid I mention that their lamb dishes are among the best in the [Bay] Area?", "author": "Michael G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-29", "description": "Kokkari is truly a gem in San Francisco! Delicious Greek food, classic decor, and consistently kind service every time. \n\nI've had the pleasure to try Kokkari a few times without needing a reservation because it quite close to my husband's office. This is probably one of the few restaurants I know in FiDi that is almost always jam packed even during weekday lunches. That said, it hasn't been a problem to walk in for a table of 2 during lunch. I do recommend making a reservation for dinner, any time of the week, because they are nearly always at full capacity.\n\nFood is amazing, and the service is on point. Making it understandable why this is a popular destination for important lunch meetings. In general, everything I have had there have been executed well with no disappointments from any of the times I've been. I think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu, so it's mostly a preference of what you prefer to eat. Overall, the underlying flavors for all of their entrees are pretty similar, with their signature Kokkari dressing. Inspite of that, the seasoning is light and allows the flavors of the ingredients to really shine.\n\nMight I also add that their dinner bread is crusty on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I appreciate that a little bowl of salt is provided at the table for you to adjust the amount of seasoning in the olive oil.\n\nHere are a few of my recommendations of favorite dishes. Do take note that if you mention that you and your party intend to share dishes, they will separate entrees onto 2 plates for you. Certain dishes, for presentation purposes, are left on 1 plate. Dinner and lunch menu's are mostly similar with the exception that dinner has more appetizer and dinner entree options. \n\nAppetizers:\nRoasted Beet Salad: I love beets. These are perfectly roasted and tossed in a thick greek housemade yogurt with a wonderful sprinkling of pistachio dust\nOctapodaki tou Yiorgou: grilled octopus! Marinated and cooked to utter perfection. Probably the best I've had, second just to Dio Deka in Los Gatos\nArnisia Plevrakia: grilled lamb riblets. These are SUPER tasty. Juicy, burst of flavor. Cooked to tender perfection.\nSpanakotiropita: spinach cheese stuffed in phillo dough. It's very light, airy. \n\nEntree:\nPsari Psito: roasted whole fish. The fish variety changes everytime I have been here. I love their branzino (sea bass), and greek red snapper. All have been cooked in the wood-fired oven with the perfect amount of lemon, oregano dressing. Very nice, well flavored and fall off the pieces. No bones because the chef has already complete deboned it, except for the head. Price varies from $35-50, depending on the fish.\nArnisia Paidakia: grilled lamb chops. I've always been a fan of lamb chops, but a lot of places tend to overcook or marinate them. These were SO GOOD. Juicy, kokkari dressing, easy to slice my knife through. Awesome. If there is one thing you HAVE to get here, I'd say it's a lamb or the fish.\nArnisio Souvlaki: grilled lamb tenderloin. These were also delicious. I would say on par the lamb chops, perhaps slightly easier to eat. It's very succulent, well flavored, paired well with their thick cucumber salad tzatziki. It's like eating little cubes of lamb steak- order medium rare.\nMoussaka: one of my favorite Greek dishes, but hard to find one that is not greasy or overdressed. I like to think of it as a eggplant, ground lamb pie, with a bottom of puree'd yukon gold potatoes, and a floating cloud of bechamel custard to top it all off. It's freaking delicious.\n\n\nDesserts:\nNo brainer, if you're going to pick 1, go with the Baklava topped with a praline ice cream. Beautiful combination, perfect ending. \nIf you're going for a home run, and can make room for it, I also highly recommend \"Galaktoboureko,\" which is a filo pastry stuffed with a custard, paired with blood orange and pistachio ice cream to cut through the richness.\n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with Kokkari. I think it's one of the must-try restaurants if you're ever in San Francisco!\n\nPrices are steeper, but as are most nicer restaurants in FiDi, so if you're going to treat yourself this is a nice place to go for. I'd say lunch per person runs around $50, and dinner around $80-100 per person. But the food is worth it!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

The food is dependably good and the service is among the top five during of my three years of living in the Bay Area. \n\nTonight we had the rotisserie special which was an incredibly juicy yet crispy pork. We also had the branzino which had a crispy exterior followed by light and flaky meat, all of which was complimented by a douse of extra virgin olive oil which added to the unmistakably Mediterranean flare of the dish. \n\nThe last dish we ordered was the Moussaka which was a blend of an incredibly rich and creamy top followed by hearty tasting spiced lamb. \n\nThe only unenviable element of the night was being placed in the front of the restaurant in a round table which was inadequate for a party of four. We only ordered three entrees for the four of us and our waitress had to substitute two of our dinner share plates for appetizer-sized dishes. \n\nAll in all a top tier restaurant and amongst the best San Fran has to offer.", "author": "Jason H."}

Sister restaurant, Evvia is one of my faves in the South Bay so I was super excited about Kokkari. I didn't realize 80% of their menu is the same, though. Arrived promptly for our 5:45pm reservations and was seated immediately. Even at that time this placed was PACKED. Doesn't seem that big from the outside, but this place is HUGE.\n\nOrdered:\nx Kalamari (grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, orange & black olives) - we usually order the octopus because it's just the best ever, but decided to try the calamari for a change. OMG I've never had stuffed calamari before and it was just AMAZING. I highly recommend this dish.. even if you don't like calamari :P\nx Spanakotiropita (traditional filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill) - It was my first time having this aside from the frozen Whole Foods and Trader Joe's version. SO GOOD! The dough was so flaky and delicious. I couldn't really taste the feta, but it was still creamy and delicious in the middle.\nx Psari sto Fourno (wood-oven roasted with potatoes, autumn vegetables, persimmon, charmoule) - ordered this with snapper and it was just ok. Stick with the branzino. There's a lot more flavor. We ordered deboned, but it came with SOOO many bones.. it was a huge turn off for me.\nx Ravioli - This ravioli was pretty bland :( I remember the first time I went to Evvia I ordered ravioli and it was also bland.. not sure if it's a Mediterranean thing.\n\nIn all another great dinner.

The food here is exceptional. We arrived early for our seating but I found the wait to be pleasant as I was taking in the gorgeous rustic interior of the restaurant. Baskets of bread loaves were sitting in front of an hearth with lamb on spits roasting in the fireplace adorned with ceramic and metal cookware. \n\nWe had some of the sourdough bread to nibble on and it was so good I ended up eating quite a few slices. There was one slice left at the end of our meal and I asked for it to be boxed. Our waiter was sweet enough to pack me a couple extra slices to go!       \n\nSAGHANAKI \nEat this quickly while it's piping hot! The textures and flavors of this cheese just blew everyone at the table away. The crispy outer layer gave way to a delectably gooey center. And the flavor combination of sour, savory, and salty was exquisite. It's a wonder how this dish is so simple yet so delicious.    \n\nHORIATIKI \nThis wonderfully refreshing classic Greek salad goes so well with the heavier dishes. All the ingredients were just bursting with freshness.  \n\nKALAMARI\nBiting into these tender, succulent pieces was absolutely delightful. I really enjoyed the added flavor from the black olive garnish. \n\nARNISIA PAIDAKIA  \nThe meat was finely grilled, flavorful, and juicy with the lemon-oregano vinaigrette enhancing the natural flavors of the lamb. The three chops looked modest in size but I felt they were quite filling. The potatoes were incredibly tasty.

My friends got the range free chicken. All of the foods came out hot and tasted great. We ended the night with a baklava and a sundae. Baklava was delicious. When I went to make reservations, all of the 7-8pm times were taken. I would recommend to make reservations like a month ahead for the time slot you want. The only times that was avail when I made reservations was at 9:30, 9:45 or 10pm. \n\n\nSo the bathroom was under the restaurant and it was a little creepy going there.

TL;DR the spectacular food and one-of-a-kind ambiance lived up to the hype, but the price... let's just say it's good for special occasions. \n\n(+) Complimentary bread: Mmm, warm, fresh, and fluffy soft.\n\n(++) Zucchini Cakes ($12): Woah, the most stunning fried zucchini I've ever seen. The composition with the golden coating surrounding cakes of shredded zucchini reminded me a bit of latkes. Soak up the mint-yogurt dressing and add some cucumber slices, and you get cool earthy flavors alternating with the more indulgent creaminess and fried crispiness.\n\n(+++) Grilled Octopus ($17.25): Never was a big fan of octopus, but its robust flavors synergized with the strong smokey tones of the grilling and seasoning of lemon, oregano, and olive oil. It's a bit heavy from the olive oil, but it's hard to stop eating.\n\n(+/-) Special: Duck Dolmathes: Frankly just tasted like plain dolmathes with a thin layer of duck. There wasn't anything special about the dolmathes; in a blind taste test it would likely be similar to what you find at your local Mediterran deli. The duck wasn't bad, but it didn't come together in any noteworthy way.\n\n(+) Halibut Steak ($32.75): Pan roasted for tastiness and surprisingly moist. The accompanying fava puree, broccolini, and artichoke and olive tapenade gave a distinctly Greek twist. The portion is alright, though I expected something larger or thicker for something called steak. I think the branzino specials may be a better deal, though the prices of $40+ scared me a little. \n\n(++) Moussaka ($25): Comfort food. I think it could have used more kick, but the casserole of spiced lamb, eggplant, potato, and yogurt bechamel was hearty and filling. They don't skimp on the lamb either.\n\n(+++) Grilled Lamb Chops ($31.50): As featured on 7x7 things to eat in SF before you die. And boy, am I glad that I got to cross this off my bucket list. The succulent meat has flavorful juices oozing out as you bite into it, infused with a pronounced roastiness and tangy lemon-oregano vinaigrette. Mop up the remaining meaty broth and seasoning with the mashed potatoes. The downside? Your standards for lamb chops will never be the same again.\n\nI loved the rustic feel of the dining rooms, with the tall ceilings, large paneled windows, wooden fixtures, vintage chandeliers, and other traditional decor. We chose a window seat, and the chairs were fancy-pants individual armchairs. Talk about picture-perfect dining.\n\nIndeed, Kokkari turned out to be an excellent choice for a celebratory meal. Since I took my family here to celebrate my graduation, Kokkari had just the right food that's of high caliber cooking but not too abstract (my parents would not know how to appreciate fine dining, and boo would be left hungry), professional service with the change of plates/utensils, and reservations available for lunch and dinner to avoid hassles. We even found street parking (albeit at $3.25/hr) and there are also garages nearby.\n\nI would highly recommend Kokkari for the overall dining experience, but only if you either have exorbitant amounts of dispensable income for eating out, or are willing to splurge a little for a special occasion.", "author": "Edna C."}

The food here has some pretty bold flavors, and they cooked our fish and lamb entrees to perfection.  Menu was all Greek to me, but they have good translations.  I like how scaleable the menu is.  Plenty of appetizers if you want a lighter dinner Tapas-style.

Solid 5 stars.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nAPPS\n1. Grilled Artichoke-Eggplant-Pepper skewers with Greek Yogurt dip is a must-have, and a great way to incorporate veggies.  The char on the Artichokes brought out a lot of the flavor. (5 stars)\n2. Watermelon-Feta salad is great on a hot day.  Very simple, but good (4 stars)\n3. Grilled Octopus was super tender and juicy, and nice smoky flavors.  Great for sharing for 2 people, but may be too small for 3-4. (4 stars)\n\nMAINS\n1. Wood Oven Roasted Branzino.  This is one of two whole fish preparations, and is the more complex one compared to the grilled version.  Fish was very moist and seasoned from the olives and Chermoula.  Roasted potatoes, turnips, and arugula make this a complete meal. (5 stars)\n2. Lamb Chops medium rare came three per order and had a wonderful sear with soft and juicy interior.  I'm not used to seeing lemon with lamb but here it works well - adding a bit of acidity to cut the richness of the meat. (5 stars).\n\nDESSERT\n1.  Arborio rice pudding with peach and honey was excellent!  Definitely one of their lighter desserts and similar to the Mexican version except you get peach instead of cinnamon. (4 stars).\n2. Greek Coffee - oh boy watch out for this one.  Similar to Turkish coffee in that its real bold and has all those grounds near the bottom.

My sweetie and I have celebrated birthdays and anniversaries here. This is a place for special occasions, but it is also a neighborhood restaurant for a drink and a casual meal. One of my most favorite restaurants in the City!!!!  This place NEVER disappoints. \n\nWalk into a warm bar area with fireplace and energy!!  Wonderful bar with fresh accoutrements for cocktails and a first rate mixologist. Martinis are poured. \n\nDinners are fantastic: fresh grilled or fire roasted fish, chicken, steak. LAMB?  Duh!!!! This is a Greek restaurant!  If they can't nail lamb, then they are lame. The lamb is always great. I had the mixed lamb grill tonight, with rib, shoulder and leg--I left only bones. The potatoes are cooked in the juices that drip from the meat. \n\nWe also had the octopus as an appetizer. If you're an octopus lover, you know that this is not an easy dish to execute. Cooked to long or too short, it's chewy. The cooks at Kokkari mastered it: perfect grill taste in outside and tender and moist inside. Seasoned simply with lemon and high quality olive oil, it is a winner!!\n\nUnless you were born in Corfu, you won't recognize a damn thing in the dessert menu other than baklava. But, everything is good!  We had a rice pudding with grilled peaches. Also, the custard with dates and walnuts was ridiculous. Leave some room for dolce!!\n\nMediterranean atmosphere. Great service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-04", "description": "Plush, slightly worn chairs with fancy patterns, oriental carpet over hardwood floors, and lots of older people in business attire. Felt like I walked right into a common room (what we called social lounges) at school, if they suddenly specialized in fancy Greek food.\n\nCame by for a celebratory lunch, so there were lots of things on the menu to try.  Overall, everything was tasty and portion sizes were large. For appetizers, we had the zucchini cakes, grilled calamari, and grilled lamb riblets. The zucchini cakes didn't really taste like veggies (in a good way, for all the usual veggie avoiders), and the texture was stringy and easy to cut into with a fork. The grilled calamari had perfect texture-- easy to chew and cut through, but not undercooked. The feta in this was melted down, and wasn't too pungent. I didn't notice the bulgur wheat in this. Good grilled flavor. The meat on the lamb riblets easily fell off the bone. The gamey flavor of the lamb here was fairly light, and it had just enough chewy portion to be tasty but not difficult to eat if one was at a fancy business lunch. Meat texture was bouncy and juicy, though more moisture would always be appreciated.\n\nThere was a bit of a wait between the apps and main courses, but we were a larger party and the place was packed (packed!) on a Monday at lunch. We got the ravioli, amisio souvlaki (grilled lamb skewer), cretan pilafi (brown rice with butter and lemon rice with greek yogurt), and patates sto fourno (potato wedges with oregano and lemon). The ravioli was not as al dente as other higher end restaurants I've had, but the filling did stand out in terms of its taste (you could really taste the freshness of the spring veggies and the pine nuts). I would have preferred the filling to be slightly less pulverized, but to each their own. The grilled lamb skewer was strong in lamb flavor vs. the riblets, and while the meat was not super tough, it definitely could have benefited from more moistness and seasoning. The brown rice was fairly standard-- good as an accompaniment but didn't stand out on its own. The potato wedges were also standard-- super hot and melt in your mouth insides, but I love potatoes generally. Overall, I think the apps (3.75/5) were stronger than the mains (3.3/5).\n\nWe finished with the vanilla ice cream and baklava. Really good vanilla ice cream has that special je ne sais quoi about it-- I think it's the bean bits that really make the vanilla flavor pop. The baklava was pretty standardly good. I preferred them separate (3.5/5). The Arnold Palmer I got was heavy on the tea, but with the ice (and passing of time), the concentration of tea to lemonade was good. The cappuccino I got was super foamy on top (so much that you could spoon it out and eat it), and wasn't overly sweet.

This place is always packed but service has always been great and the dishes are always well executed. \n\nAlthough they have a pretty large menu, they are pretty straight forward....nothing too fancy. For appetizers, the grilled pita with the different kinds of spreads are always great to share. The saghanaki, which is a pan fried cheese is also fun to have. I also enjoy the grilled octopus and the calamari stuffed with feta cheese. I have been here so many times so now I typically like to order their nightly specials. They have had grilled lamb's tongue, pork sausages, lamb dolmathes as their appetizer specials, they were all great!\n\nFor the main course, I would typically get the whole grilled fish if I want something lighter. It's a very simple dish (oregano, olive oil, lemon, salt) and yet it's very satisfying. It comes with a side of steamed/boiled vegetables (the veggies might be a bit boring but I guess it works with this dish because it's so simple?) You can ask the waiter to debone the fish if you prefer.\n\nIf I'm craving for red meat, I would usually get the lamb chops or the lamb souvlaki. Both dishes are excellent, seasoned nicely, and grilled to perfection. The ribeye is great too, but the portion is huge for one person.... I would suggest splitting the ribeye. Also, check what they have on their special rotisserie. Often times they would have duck and that's a great dish to try as well....very tasty.", "author": "Sam M."}

The service was warm and attentive. The manager came to check in with us during the meal and right before we left. We were served warm bread with a big bowl of olive oil once we sit down. \n\nFor appetizer, we indulged in their grilled Octopus and fish roe dip with homemade pita bread. Both are outstanding and the dip is rich, creamy and smooth. It goes so well with their soft but firm pita bread. It was a match made in heaven. For entr\u00e9e, I was eyeing the lamb chop but decided to go a healthier route of grilled Branzino fish. Both cost over $46 but come in rather big portion. My husband got the lamb chop instead. \n\nI had a slide of the medium rare lamb chop and it was full of flavor and excellently seasoned. My Branzino fish came in whole with head, tail and bone. It was a beautiful thing although I cannot finish it all at once. It tastes fresh, sweet and tender. \n\nWe were really full after entr\u00e9e but figured an order of dessert will just put us to sleep so why not? We got the Baklava and it came with a scoop of very sweet Vanila ice cream I believe. The baklava comes in two triangle pieces and if you never have it before, you should be aware that Baklava is naturally very sweet since it has a lot of honey in it plus crushed pistachio.

Unless I'm mistaken, I'm sure Greek/Mediterranean cuisine involves a LOT more flavoring that those ingredients. What the hell. \n- Grilled octopus. Grilled then dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. $13 (or something) for a few bite size pieces ??\n- Special of the day: mission figs with cheese and honey something. This was my favorite but there was way too much dressing and a little too much honey. The leaves were literally completely covered..\n- Zucchini cakes with yogurt sauce: UHHHHH why is this popular?????? $13 for two rounds of panko covered zucchini batter. I guess the pickled cucumber and yogurt sauce were good complements...\n- Puff pastry with spinach and feta. SO oily?? \n- Special on the pit: roast lamb. THIS TASTED LIKE BOILED LAMB, which of course was then doused in olive oil and lemon juice. Chewy and overcooked. And expensive??\n- Lamb chop. Not sure why all their lamb items don't really taste like lamb... This was probably my favorite, and was actually cooked to Medium as requested. \n- Whole grilled sea bass. Grilled and dressed with..... YOU GUESSED IT, freaking olive oil and lemon juice. They \"deboned\" it and there were still so many bones left. There is no way to eat this dish elegantly. At least my mom said the fish tasted fresh.... \n\nService: C \nTell me why our server looked like he had a migraine all night? Not once did we see him smile. He was so stern, I felt like I was supposed to be pouring him water. He did take the time to explain the dishes when I had questions, but we did not felt welcomed by him. I'm not even sure if he introduced himself when he first approached our table. \nWe mentioned that it was my birthday when I made the reservation, but there was no attempt to celebrate. If we're paying this much, at least a scoop of ice cream would've been nice. I know I know, I'm so self centered for being upset at this, but you know what? We are common peasants who are out there to celebrate my very ordinary birthday, so I would at least like to be acknowledged.\n\nWeird quirk:\nThe bathroom is downstairs so you need to take an elevator..... Very ... Dungeon feeling. \n\nOVERALL:\nEveryone was so snobby. I felt like I should be serving the server instead because he looked so... Sad. Food was equally as sad. Bill was severely sad. So was wallet. Never coming back....", "author": "Susanna C."}

This is truly one of my favorite restaurants in Northern California and I try to come here as often as I can. \n You really can't go wrong with any of the menu choices to be honest. Some of my favorite appetizers include: spanakopita (light and fluffy), Kokkari potatoes, Kalamazoo, and the grilled lamb meatballs which are perfectly seasoned and paired with a fresh Greek yogurt. \n I usually order the salmon as my entree but you cannot go wrong with the rib eye. They also have a four cheese ravioli on the menu which is nice for the vegetarian palette. \n  Finish your meal with the baklava ice cream- mind blowing. Thank me later. \n This place will change your love for Greek food; take a group of friends or take your significant other, make reservations and enjoy the evening at this gem in the financial district!", "author": "Jay E."}

So I'll just touch on a few highlights.We were a group of 7 celebrating my bros birthday.  T and I got there ahead of everyone else.  Early enough to see them taking the whole lamb off the rotisserie, and I already knew what I'd be eating.  It was slow cooked over the flame with potatoes roasting underneath in the drippings - a little shoulder, some leg, a couple of rib chops.  It was sublime.  We got several apps, my favorite was the Kalamari - grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, orange & black olives 12.75.  The squid were pretty small, but the combo of flavors, was extraordinary.  I highly recommend it.\nWhat I really want to talk about, though, is the service.  Our server,Hank, was absolutely exceptional.  He was always there when we needed him and dealt with each of the quirky personalities in my extended family with grace, expedience and humor.  Since the birthday boy was paying for all of us, we brought wine and asked him to split off the corkage and give us the bill for that.  He was kind enough to tell me, as he opened the 4th bottle that starting with the 5th one the fee goes up from $25/ to $35/ , so we had him stop at that one.  Is it just me, or does using Uber make you drink more.  \n\nFood:  36/40\nService:  20/20\nAtmos/intangibles:  18/20\nValue:  16/20\nOverall:  90/100 just squeaks into the 5 star territory", "author": "Diane B."}

The ambiance of the restaurant is very cozy even though the restaurant is large.

We also had a fried cheese dish that was browned on all sides with a gooey center. They squirted lemon over the top, which added a sour component to the dish that was delicious. The cheese reminded me of the best browned pizza cheese but way better! \n\nFor our main dishes, my husband ordered the Moussaka which is a ground lamb casserole with potatoes and a b\u00e9chamel type sauce that has been baked off. the casserole has some sweet spices in it like cinnamon. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  I ordered the whole roasted sea bass, which was delicious and delicate.\n\nWe couldn't resist dessert. I ordered a semolina custard filo dessert that came with pistachio ice-cream and candied quince. OMG so good.

Both my boyfriend and I are not huge fans of Mediterranean food, but we decided to give it a try. Overall, our experience was alright. \n\nAppetizer:\nGrilled octopus: 5 stars. Simply delish! \n\nEntree:\nOven-roasted branzino: 4.5 stars. They had three different fish for fish of the day. You can get them either oven-roasted or grilled. I chose oven-roasted, and the dish came with roasted tomatoes and Yukon potatoes. The fish itself was great, but the roasted vegetables were amazing as well.\n\nGrilled lamb chops: 3 stars. I'm not sure what happened with our dish. Most Yelp reviewers rave about this dish, but we weren't so happy with ours. We asked for medium-rare, but two of the three lamp chops came out medium to medium-well. Also, those two lamb chops were lacking flavor very much. For a $47.50 dish, we were looking for more, but ours definitely did not meet our expectations. \n\nOur server was very helpful and attentive. She was knowledgeable in dish preparation as well as the restaurant's beer selection. If it wasn't for her, I would be leaving a 3 star review. Kokkari is definitely pricey for what it offers in terms of food, but maybe our next visit will be better.\n\nAlso, they offer valet service.

I made my second visit here during a business lunch with a big group of 11, and we reserved and were seated at a long communal table in the inside dining room, facing the open kitchen. Despite being such a big group, the service was timely and impeccable--somehow, all of our dishes still arrived at the same time, and the food was amazing like always. The lunch menu is almost identical to the dinner menu, though a few of the entrees are smaller (and cheaper).\n\nMezedthes are the star of any Greek meal for me, so four of us split a bunch of starters (this was a good number of people to split these dishes, as quite a few items came in fours). The salty baked feta was served in a tomato sauce and had the perfect amount of kick/spice--perfect for eating with bread. The grilled meatballs were tender and juicy (pairing perfectly with the tomato sauce and dollop of yogurt), and the zucchini cakes with yogurt sauce and cucumbers were so unique. The stuffed grilled calamari and dolmathes (rice in grape leaves) were both delicious as well, and the fried smelt had a fantastic crispy texture--kind of like fish-flavored fries!\n\nHaving tried so many starters already, we decided to split just two entrees--the lamb chops and the grilled whole sole. Both of these dishes had bold Greek flavors of lemon, oregano, and olive oil--there was nothing crazy about these dishes, but everything was perfectly executed! The lamb chops come with the most delicious fried potatoes, and the juicy whole fish is deboned at the pass right before being served!\n\nOverall, another great experience at Kokkari--I definitely preferred the flavors and the variety of the starters more than the main dishes themselves, and this was such a balanced, delicious meal. However, this restaurant is certainly expensive and the portions are small for the price, but the unmatched quality of ingredients and execution are worth the expense.", "author": "David K."}

The fried cheese thing (\"Saghanaki\") is delicious and so are their spreads with pita. I'd been raving about Kokkari for a while, and thought I'd make a reservation to introduce my husband to one of my favorite places.\n\nUnfortunately, it wasn't as good as I remembered. The octopus appetizer was delicious - perfectly cooked and seasoned. We had some salad, but it wasn't memorable. The lamb chops were tender and wonderful and tiny and came with a tiny side of potatoes (the potatoes needed to be rationed carefully in order to not eat them in one bite and have them to go along with the 4 bites of lamb...) I ordered a fish and it was well cooked and tasty. My fish came with sauteed greens, and they were weirdly textured and really didn't work with the fish and I found them completely inedible. \n\nThe quality of their meats / fish is absolutely wonderful. However, everything just tastes like it's been charred and seasoned with olive oil / lemon juice. It's kind of boring and the lamb chops are literally the smallest I've ever seen at any restaurant (especially for the price...). \n\nOur server was nice and the wine selection was good. It's a nice place for a date or a birthday celebration. I've actually never been to a restaurant that does absolutely nothing when you tell them you're celebrating something special.... well Kokkari does absolutely nothing which is really awkward... There are a lot of great restaurants in this city at this price point, and to be completely honest, I think this one is the least creative / smallest portions (with spices, sauces, ingredients) compared to its peers. I understand the high ratings - it's a classy place and it hurts to admit that you spent ~ $100 per person for a mediocre meal with minimal ingredients that you could have made at home.", "author": "Nelya T."}

This isn't your typical Medi/Greek restaurant, folks.  This is excellence and perfection and absolutely stands up to other spots in the city.  \n\nYou'll have to get reservations ahead of time on open table.  I tend to make reservations months in advance in increments just so I can keep coming back.  Parking is horrific out here.  Take a lyft...also it would be best since they do have a full bar and an extensive wine menu.  We ended up with a fantastic bottle of sancerre which really complemented our meal.  Awesome for special occasions and hopefully, you'll get a seat in front of the hearth.  \n\nSpeaking of the hearth, they've got meat on the fire, depending on the chef's choice of the day, and tons of bread sitting up in front of it.  Really creates such an amazing ambiance and I just can't get enough.  I was so stoked when I found out the special was duck.  Yesssss!!!\n\nAnyhoo we started off with:\n\nFeta sto Fourno - Greek feta baked with tomato, capers & Metaxa brandy.  I will be the first to tell you that I am not a fan of feta.  I told our server this but she still recommended it saying that most people who don't like feta end up loving this dish.  Glad I listened to her.  It was fantastic and the flavors were bursting at the seams.  \n\nNext, we ordered their infamous \"fries with eyes\":  Marithes Tiganites - crispy smelts with garlic-potato skordalia & lemon.  I could eat this entire dish myself.  The smelts had such a great texture.  Although fried, it still tasted light and was absolutely delish.\n\nOk, back to the duck which was the Souvla Tis Emeras, the rotisserie of the day.  Perfectly cooked, a must order if they happen to have it when you're there.  More than enough to take half of it home as I was stuffed from everything else already.  We also ordered the Arnisia Paidakia, grilled lamb chops with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes.  Also such an amazing dish and you can't go wrong with either of them.

The hostess wouldn't seat us until our whole party was present, and told us to go to the bar for a drink. The only problem was that there was absolutely no space, so we waited in the corridor. The hostess then very rudely told us that we shouldn't be standing there, which I sort of understood, but there was literally nowhere else for us to stand without being in the way anyway. We quipped that there was nowhere else for us to stand, and that we weren't going outside in the cold. Not to mention, this probably could have been avoided if they just sat us, as 3 out of the 4 people in our party were present anyway. Yeesh.\n\nThankfully, after that whole debacle, our server was very kind and cordial. He gave us some really good recommendations for wine, as well as the food. We were seated in the back area near the windows, which was really nice. The interior is very well-kept, and the presence of the wood-fired oven makes the vibe seem more home-y, which I appreciated. \n\nOur favorites:\n- Lamb chops: Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the signature lamb chops were everything that was promised to us and more\n- Grilled stuffed calamari: The varying textures were all great, and the sharpness from the feta and olive really went well with the tender calamari\n- Moussaka: So good. Each layer was perfectly portioned, and I really enjoyed the meatiness.\n- Banana Kataifi: Unbelievably tasty. It wasn't on the the dessert menu, but was listed as a special, and it's definitely worth it. Not sure if it's available year-round, but it certainly should be.\n\nIn general, as previously mentioned, our service was very attentive, and the courses were very well-paced. The prices are definitely on the expensive side, but the ambiance is very nice and the quality is really great. With the bottle of wine for 4 people, and about an appetizer/entree per person with dessert, it was about $80 a person, including tip/tax. Not too shabby \n\nOur meal here was pretty much perfect, besides the hostess needing an attitude check (did I really just use the term \"attitude check?\").

I came here a few nights ago with my boyfriend while we were on vacation to celebrate our last night out in San Francisco. I had done some research and discovered it is one of the best places to eat in the city. Not to mention, Greek food is one of our favorites. I had made a reservation about a month in advance and although we were a few minutes early, they seated us right away in a cozy corner table with a nice view. \n\nThe bottle of wine we ordered was a nice, more dry Pinot Noir; the Caraccioli Cellars, Pinot Noir, Lucia '13. Very delicious especially for the price of only $52. \n\nWe started with the Karpouzi me Feta (watermelon and feta appetizer with basil, pine nuts and olive oil). I am a big Top Chef and Master Chef television fan and have always been intrigued by the watermelon dishes they create but had never before had the chance to try one. It was spectacular and everything I had hoped for. They were offering a specialty peach salad that night that we also got and thoroughly enjoyed. \n\nMy boyfriend actually opted for an appetizer for his entree, the Soutzoukakia (lamb meatballs with spiced tomato sauce and Greek yogurt) and I had the Arnisia Paidakia (lamb chops with lemon-oregano vinaigrette and potatoes). Both were superb. Even though the meatballs are traditionally an appetizer my boyfriend was barely able to finish them the portion was so nice. On my lamb dish you could really taste the vinaigrette which had soaked so nicely into the lamb. \n\nAs for dessert, per the recommendation of our waiter, we went with the Galaktoboureko (custard in what looks like a connoli but tastes even better with apricot and pistachio ice cream). I probably would have ordered this dessert even without the recommendation because of how much my boyfriend loves ice cream, nonetheless I'm glad it was presented to us in such a high manner because it was delicious. My only critique is that they put more apricots on the plate because those were my favorite!\n\nOf course the service was wonderful.

She made the meal really fun! We brought our own wine since the corkage fee is only $25. We started with the crispy zucchini cakes. This appetizer comes with 2 of the cakes, a sliced cucumber salad, and a minty yogurt sauce. That sauce really makes the dish! For our entrees, we each got a side of the goat stew which was on special, and we got the pork which was the special on the spit that evening. Both dishes were phenomenal, but that stew is really magical! We also had our eyes on the lamb chops, but we'll have to come back another time to try those! We ended the meal with 2 desserts- the galaktoboureko and the special which was a phyllo nest with sweetened ricotta, figs, and baklava syrup. They were both really tasty- I liked the galaktoboureko better and the bf liked the special better. We were also impressed that they remembered to write happy anniversary on our plates without us even reminding them when we walked in! (We told them when we made the reservation). \n\nOverall, we had an awesome experience here, and if you're on the fence about going, DO IT! I'm excited to go back myself to try some of the other dishes!", "author": "Rachel D."}

Although the food was ok and the service was quite good, this review is meant to counterbalance all the hype to provide a more accurate overall rating for this restaurant. \n\nOne common theme in marketing/psychology is that one's satisfaction doesn't derive from intrinsic quality but from the difference between actual quality and expectation of quality. For example, if you eat at a restaurant you expect to be like McDonald's but is actually the quality of in-and-out, you'll be greatly satisfied. If you eat at a 3 star Michelin restaurant, but it turns out to only be a 2 star experience, you'll be very disappointed.\n\nUnder this scale my experience at this restaurant is 1-yelp star. At the time of writing this review, Kokkari had 3850 reviews and 4.5 stars. Comments describing this restaurant would include:\n\n\"The olive oil is the best thing ever, I swear I would drink it if I could!!\"\n\n\"Some of the best food in San Francisco, period.\"\n\n\"The meal is one of the best I've ever had.\"\n\n\"The most tender and full of flavor lamb shank that I've ever tried\"\n\n\"I kid you not, BEST LAMB CHOPS IN THE WORLD. And that's coming from someone who usually hates lamb.\"\n\nAnd hundreds of similar reviews. Reading the Yelp page convinced me that this restaurant achieved something akin to human discovery of fire. When I walked in with my girlfriend, I was expecting to be nothing short of amazed. The real (objective) results were as follows:\n\nZucchini Cakes: 4/5 stars. Unique, crispy appetizers. Would order again.\nFilo Cakes: 4/5 stars. I've had Filo cakes in the past, but these were above average.\nLamb Chops: 3/5. Chewy, not too much flavor. Quite average.\nLamb Shank: 3/5. Same as above.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty average meal. Service was superb, and the waiters were quite accommodating. But remember, I was expecting to witness the discovery of fire. But for $140, it did not come even close to that. 1/5.", "author": "Chris W."}

And Kokkari scores in every category.\n\nRight now, the fresh (and I mean still moving) sea urchin from Monterey Bay and Feta-stuffed squid are both exceptional. As for the entrees, get the lamb chops, and ask for four instead of three because you and your date will most certainly fight over them. Pair that with the Branzino and you just might have room to split their namesake sundae dessert (their in-house ice cream is beyond compare).", "author": "Mike V."}

I wasn't amazed at the appetizers we ordered but the entrees were exceptional. The restaurant is huge! There are so many rooms throughout but I wouldn't suggest coming here without a reservation. The servers were very informative regarding each dish and attentive throughout the night.\n\nFor starters we got an order of the kalamata pita (flatbread) and the avgolemono (egg-lemon) soup. When I think of pita, I think it of more on the softer side but this dish was a little crispier than I was expecting. It's basically a mini pizza; extremely thin flatbread with a hardened crust. The avgolemono soup was a little too sour for me. I know it's a egg-lemon based soup but it seemed like the ratio between egg to lemon wasn't consistent and there was a ton of lemon juice.\n\nNow, the entrees are spectacular. We opted for the arnisia paidakia (grilled lamb chops) and kokinisto me manestra (lamb shank). I loved both dishes. The grilled lamb chops had a great presentation. The meat was juicy and tender. It didn't taste or smell gamy at all. I loved the lemon-oregano vinaigrette that it came with... it balanced quite well. The lamb shank was also superb. It's placed on top of orzo pasta and the meat fell right off the bone! Reallly tender and tasty!!\n\nI would definitely go back to Kokkari! Maybe I'll order some different appetizers next time.", "author": "Jason L."}

Buzzing, but not too loud and we were able to hear everyone at the table we were seated at. The first thing I noticed was the service - it was incredible. Our waitress was so knowledgeable (and knew every thing on the menu that could be tailored to my Gluten Free diet) and she was able to help us by recommending several dishes, so if you go and you can't decide what to get, ask your waiter! They have a seasonal menu, but I recommend the asparagus, the lamb steak, the dolmathes, the amazing hummus (We ordered a dip combo plate and there was one dip that was the most delicious cheese I have ever had so I highly recommend).

Thursdays to Sundays are usually booked out 30 days in advance, especially during peak dinner hours. \n\n-Apps: Baked feta topped with roasted tomatoes, onions and a hint of capers and flecks of chili flakes\n\n-Order anything roasted on the spit; there were chickens and pork shoulder tonight.  The pork shoulder was especially decadent, made more so by a small sliver of crispy pork skin that reminds me of lechon (Google it.  Hint: It's Filipino!)\n\n-Get you some goat stew on a bed of orzo.  Ignore that it's goat and just focus on the feta and the orzo and the flavor that makes this goat the G.O.A.T\n\n-With dessert, have your Greek coffee, sketo style for its unsweetened caffeinated glory.  I'm still effin awake and I sipped this thing six hours ago.\n\n-For dessert: kataifi with roasted peaches and vanilla ice cream drizzled with caramel sauce.

It was pretty much a ghost town for our 9:45 reservation, thankfully (we ended up parking not too far away--definitely will feel the wind on a chilly day). I have no clue how there's no reservations at a reasonable hour on a Friday (since getting here on a workday seems virtually impossible), and that you have to book at least a month in advance. Our server (who mentioned it was his first day), pretty much memorized the entire menu and specials it seemed, which was very impressive. Sadly, the restaurant didn't really live up to all the hype for me. I wasn't overly impressed with the food (although out of all the items we had, the lamb was definitely top notch and I really enjoyed the ice cream sundae for some reason), and it takes a long time to get your order. We had to wait to be seated even with a reservation and being on time, and then the items came out pretty slow. Granted, it was busy, but not teeming with people. Waiting for your table to be ready sort of defeats the purpose of arriving on time--but I'm sure if we were late there'd be another 30 minutes added on. Don't order anything but wine, beer, or some standard Lemon Drop-esque cocktail here either--I asked for something with bourbon and lemon; the waiter seemed pretty confident the bartender could make me something with that (there is a Gold Rush cocktail of bourbon, honey, and lemon that I have made and ordered out that is quite good and very simple to make), but literally came back with...you guessed it, a Lemon Drop--complete with a wedge of lemon in a martini glass and a sugar rim. I had to do a double take and confirm it was the \"college freshman girl, get wasted on two while listening to Britney Spears and discussing Sex and the City\" libation of choice. And sadly, it was. Big time letdown--but my own fault, you don't order drinks like that at restaurants not known for cocktails. The bathroom is also really far inside the cavernous venue; you have to walk down a long aisle and take an elevator (!) to get downstairs to the bathrooms. If you don't feel like walking, just hold it to build character.\n\nOverall, glad I tried it, but not worth the wait time, average food (minus the items listed above), and subpar drinks.", "author": "Dan M."}

Our hostess, who was very kind and knowledgable, took us through the different items on the menu briefly but concisely describing each item.

There was one true gentleman server there that evening and he shined liked a rockstar! He was Elton John, Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson all wrapped in one!

Thank you. Maybe invest in some upgraded seats, to offset your meals or substatiate the cost vs Denny's Diner hardback seating. Your average appetizer is the cost of a meal at many restaurants. My soup and meal alone was roughly $65, withouth said appetizer of spanikopota and saginaki!\nMy spouse and I drove 3 hours to spend a significant day with family. We went there to enjoy our time specifically, not to be treated like I was in line waiting for ICE to be called and told to move along out front by Mr. Yellow/Tan Coat.

We got there at 5:45 on a Monday and it was already pretty full. Reservations from 6-8 were all taken when we tried to get in, several weeks beforehand.\n\nGreat food and service. Our waitress was extremely helpful, but not pushy. She clearly knew the menu very well, because she could list all of the ingredients of each dish we asked about and explained the cooking methods. My wife is gluten free, and the waitress walked her through the menu. We also had a nice wine recommendation.\n\nThe food was excellent. We had an order of dolmathes, Spanakotiropita  and pita with tzatziki sauce. I'm often hit and miss on dolmathes, but these had a flavor that mixed well... the mint and grape leaf flavors were there, but not overpowering. The spanakotiropita was done just right. The pita was thicker and more like sliced wheat bread than your traditional pita, but it was still good. The tzatziki sauce was also not overpowering.\n\nFor my meal, I had a lamb shoulder with orzo. The portion was huge, with the meat easily bigger than my fist. It was cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone and able to be pulled apart without a knife. The orzo and sauce was a nice compliment to it. My one minor complaint, was that there was no vegetable with the meal, but with a portion that large, I did not miss it that much.\n\nOthers at my table were equally impressed by their meals. Two people had kebabs which were cooked perfectly. My father had the whole fish sea bass, which he said was one of the best he had ever had. Even my mother, who went with the somewhat boring roasted chicken, thought hers was very good.\n\nTwo minor warnings... one, get reservations well in advance. Two, the prices are fairly high, but for a nice meal, with good service, it's understandable.", "author": "Tom D."}

I had made a reservation some time in advance to make sure we had our spot secured, as this restaurant is very very popular and gets busy. \n\n I also wanted him to try my favorite dishes, so we decided to go all out. \n\nWe started with the Mezethes (Appetizers):\n\n1. Octapodaki tou Yiorgou (Has a strong grilled taste, which brings out a very unique flavor in the octopus)\n2. Peinirli (Very warm and tasty pita, with a great addition of fig, caramelized onions, and ricotta)\n3. Kalamari (Can't go wrong with this dish because it's flavors are to die for. Had to put in a second order because it was so delicious)\n4. Arnisia Plevrakia (The meat just comes off the bones and has the best seasoning)\n\n\nFor the Kirios Piato (Appetizers):\n\n1. Arnisia Paidakia (The lamb chops were extremely juicy and had the perfect zest of lemon-oregano vinaigrette)\n2. Kokinisto me Manestra (The most tender and full of flavor lamb shank that I've ever tried. The orzo was a perfect combination to the shank, as it added it's own flavor to the entire dish)\n\nThe Glyka (Dessert):\n\n1. Galaktoboureko (The most exceptional dessert with filo dough and pistachio ice cream. This is a MUST TRY dessert when coming to this restaurant) \n2. Baklava (The mix of honey, walnuts, and ice cream is indescribable. Truly something incredible and succulent) \n\nOur 5 year anniversary dinner was unforgettable. There were so many exquisite dishes and there was superb service which made the evening even more magical. I can't wait to be back for some more mouthwatering foods!!", "author": "Julia K."}

For one, I didn't appreciate the arrogance of the manager when I walked into the restaurant--no smile, and looked me up and down like I just interrupted his conversation. Where's the Greek hospitality? \n\nFood:\nAPPETIZERS\n- Complementary table bread: Sourdough I believe, but I skipped this to make room for the real food lol \n- Grilled octopus: delicious. Very tender, great with a squirt of lemon on top. I definitely recommend for an appetizer. \n- Arnisia Plevrakia (lamb riblets): tender and flavorful. Came with 5 I think. The plating was well done. Great starter to have.\nMAIN COURSE\n- Psari psito ( grilled whole fish): I chose sea bass, but there's also a sea bream option. Again, very tasty, well made. I love that they give you steamed lemon to squeeze over the fish, it really enhances the flavor. Also comes with some streamed veggies.  I would try the sea bream next time. \n- Arnisia Paidakia (lamb chop): comes with 3, but they can add 1 more lamb chop if you're planning to share to make it fair. I would say do it if that's the main course for you. But otherwise, 3 lamb chops is perfectly enough to satisfy your lamb craving, especially if you're ordering other dishes as well. Very juicy, and well seasoned. I highly enjoyed this, and slightly man-handled my lamb chop. I definitely recommend this. \n\nWINE:I love Greek wine! Red or white, it doesn't matter. They are all so aromatic. White with fish, red with lamb? Or mix it up. Just get a glass! \n\nOverall: The food is delicious. I would return again, hopefully to friendlier and more gracious staff.", "author": "Cindy H."}

We requested to be seated by one of the windows to be able to enjoy it. On pretty days it seems like they keep them opened. This diner kept closing my window and I became increasingly annoyed after it happened several times. It was ridiculous considering she had a sweater draped over her shoulders. Here's an idea, ya cold? Put on your darn sweater! I eventually had to play the snitch and our waiter had to tell them to keep the window open and offered them another table.

The restaurant is very fancy and the service is pretty amazing. Sadly this review might be a little biased as I'm not a huge fan of Greek cuisine. Came with a group of friends (7 in total) for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday.\n\nFirst of all, there is unlimited bread refills and the bread is pretty solid. I love bread so this was definitely a highlight.\n\nWe had some appetizers to share:\n- Peinirli (stuffed pita): meh, I got a pretty small piece on the side so didn't get much of the stuffed filling, so it just tasted like a plain pita with some arugula.\n- Saganaki: was not a fan of this, fried cheese was pretty heavy and definitely didn't suite my tastes.\n- Spanakopita: spinach pieces. Again hard to split so just got a small bite. Was good but I couldn't really tell the difference between that and ones I could get from Trader Joe's.\n- Octopus: very good, had a good smoked flavor and the meat was tender.\n- Crispy Smelt: wow, this was pretty amazing: the smelt was just so crispy and went with the tartar like sauce so well, it was pretty addicting to eat.\n- Pita with various dips: the pita was very solid and fresh. There was a dip that had a cod roe based flavor that was incredibly good (and went so well with the regular bread).\n\nThen we also shared some entrees:\n- Moussaka: I feel like this is pretty staple for Greek cuisine but unfortunately it was way too heavy for me.\n- Grilled lamb skewer: lamb was very juicy and tender. Also only got to try a small bite.\n- Roasted chicken: decent, chicken was tender but a bit bland.\n- Braised lamb shank with orzo: wonderful, the lamb shank was just so tender it just falls off the bone. The orzo makes for a good pairing.\n- Lamb riblets: again very tender, lamb had a good gamy taste.\n\nOverall, the food experience was unique as I'm not familiar with Greek cuisine but it was a bit of mixed bag of ups and downs.", "author": "Alvin W."}

You may already have a favorite Kokkari server but if you do, trust me, ask for Johnny. Not only is he the most knowledgeable server I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, his attention to detail was superb, his understanding of the food immeasurable and the phrase \"he's a cool dude\" was made for him. It is unbelievable that he is a newcomer to Kokkari. It was a pleasure meeting Johnny.\n\nFood\n\nThe food was nothing short of spectacular. The arnisia plevrakia (grilled lamb riblets) fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. How the hell can a chef do that? The lentil and vegetable soup was unique and tasty, The grilled whole fish was to die for and the presentation artistic and the pan roasted halibut steak was cooked to perfection. This is one place where you can believe the hype. The folks doing the cooking at Kokkari can flat out \"throw down.\"\n\nTo be fair I want to point out two SMALL items of concern \n\nConfirmation Personnel\n\nMy latest visit to Kokkari was November 7, 2017. I have been to Kokkari many times and just love the place. Today, I have a suggestion: If confirming reservations frustrates your employees, allow us to confirm on-line or via email. On November 7, 2017 at 3:11 pm I received my fourth call about confirming. The other calls occurred last Sunday. I immediately stated my name and I said I was confirming. After a brief hold I was asked \"is your reservation for Thursday?\" I said no today Tuesday at 6:00 pm. The lady responded: \"contrary to popular opinion we do not have the reservation list memorized.\" I said, I was just trying to confirm. I received four calls, and twice when I returned the call to confirm the phone rang and never went to a voicemail.  The lady replied- \"Well, I do not know about that,\" to which I said, \"Good Day\" and hung up. You were just named a top twenty U.S. restaurant by Trip Advisor, come on now, you should all be happy!  Initial impressions and words matter!.\nDress Code\nI am not asking for shirts and ties, spatterdashes, or dresses but I would also consider a semi-dress code. Salesforce employees and other \"not ready for the world\" twenty-somethings took bar area of the restaurant yesterday and there was overflow bordering the dining area. Some people do not understand restaurant attire; I get that. San Francisco is an anything goes city; I get that. That said, patrons who spend over two hundred dollars minimum on dinner for two are entitled to more. I saw folks wearing reverse baseball caps, ratty jeans and tee-shirts. This attire is beneath this August restaurant. Patrons at tables on both sides of us commented. I know, things have changed but can we make a couple of exceptions? I do not think it too much to require folks to wear a collared shirt or mock turtleneck.", "author": "Chocoolate I."}

I'll have a breakdown below.\n\nThe service was great, but not top-notch, or at least, it wasn't for me. The hostess in the front seemed very cold and when we asked her to take a picture of us at the end before we left, she seemed like she didn't want to and acted like she didn't know what to do and handed my phone off to a waiter that was walking by to take a pic of us instead. Awkward?!?\n\nI also put that it was our anniversary dinner on our reservation. Both our hostess and waiter never acknowledged it, which is FINE. I know a restaurant isn't obligated to celebrate with you for events. But it was just weird when we opted to not have dessert after perusing the dessert menu, and then he was just like, \"No celebratory dessert?!\" \"Nah.. we're pretty stuffed.\" \"Really?!\" Uhh.. way to make it awkward!\n\nThe dinner service in itself was fine. Attentive, but not overbearing. Overall, very good but those 2 events just kinda left me feeling.. weird.\n\nFOOD:\nCOMPLIMENTARY BREAD - YUM! Slightly sour, soft, fluffy and chewy on the inside, with a nice crusty exterior. I'm not sure where it's from, maybe Acme?\n\nSTARTERS:\nI was reading that people thought the apps were kind of small, so we ordered three starters between 2 of us. We were pleasantly surprised! I thought the starters were pretty big and good to share between 3 or 4 people! \n\nMARCHES TIGANITES / FRIED SMELT: OMG. 5 stars. Better than French fries. OK, OK, maybe not better. Totally different, but on the same ranking as delicious scale. Heaping portion. I don't even like fish, but this was one of my favorite dishes of the night. ALSO: for the curious, no, these didn't have bones or really any fishy flavor. That's probably why I liked it.\n\nPEINIRLI / STUFFED PITA: 5 stars again! The pita was so fluffy and soft on the inside but had a pretzel-like crust. A little grainy, and you could taste the ricotta, feta, and garlic equally. SO GOOD.\n\nSPITZPILAOA  LAMB MEATBALLS: 4 stars. I like my meatballs a bit more soft and slightly crumbly when biting into it. These were quite dense! But the sauce it came with was divine! It would make a bomb spaghetti.. I know this is Greek food.. but damn, it really would make a really good spaghetti!! The Greek yogurt was a perfect contrast to the savory meatball and the tomato sauce!\n\nENTREES:\nWe got the two specials of the day because it sounded so good! It was a Monday, so we got:\n\nA pork chop attached with pork belly which is roasted over their fire, along with potatoes which cooks in all those drippings.. 4 stars.  The potatoes which soaked up all the yummy pork fat... MMM, artery clogging goodness. Could have been browner, but I'm not gonna complain. The pork chop was very lean, so it was a little tough. The darker meat, the crusty parts, and the pork belly were DELICIOUS though! Wish it came with more pork belly. It tasted better the next day when I had a clear palette and wasn't too stuffed from eating all the entrees. \n\nGoat stew - 5 stars! The bed of orzo with the goat stew was creamy and perfect to go with the goat stew. Makes me want to accompany all my saucey type dishes with orzo!  The goat stew was delicious, and not too gamey. This smelled and tasted even better the next day.\n\nI would return again to try their lamb chops for the entree, and more starters! Would definitely definitely get the smelt again!", "author": "Emily C."}

The saganaki and the grilled octopus were both fantastic. The latter was tender and not rubbery. We also had three spreads: tzatsiki, favosalata, and taramosalata. The last was the best. All were served with fresh pita. We also tried the lamb souvlaki. It was wonderful. Our server, Todd, took excellent care of us. We had two different wines and Greek coffee. Even the desserts were delicious! This is one of the best places around!", "author": "Nobbi L."}

I got that to share among 3 of us and they were nice enough to split it up into 3 plates since we said we were sharing (for an extra charge they didn't tell us about, of course). I thought it was pretty good. It was cooked pretty well, and the lemon wedge was really good with it, but I thought it could have used more seasoning or sauce of some sort. My mom makes rosemary lamb chops at home and I thought they were better. Don't get me wrong, it was still good, but I would have rather had my mom make them because my mom is that good . The potatoes that came with it were delicious! We also go the pork belly app which was good. It had peaches on top which added a nice sweetness and I really enjoyed it. We also go the watermelon with feta on top. The watermelon was perfect in texture and in sweetness. The feta added a nice saltiness contrast to it. Since we had room for dessert, we got 2 of them to share. I loved the baklava. It had the perfect combination of flaky, sweet, nutty and sweet. We also got the birds nest dessert (not on menu) and it was pretty good except I wish it had been sweeter.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal with nice ambiance. The presentation of the dishes are beautifully plated as well. I personally wouldn't come back for the lamb since I like my mom's, but I would recommend it if you don't have a mom who can cook really good lamb.", "author": "Sophia Y."}

Several of my friends had already been to Kokkari (multiple times) and I felt like I was missing out, so I made reservations for six on an early Saturday evening. Reservations can be difficult to come by, especially since they're only available one month prior online and two months prior over the phone. We booked for a 5:30 PM dinner which worked out great, considering we continuously ate and drank for 2-2.5 hours.\n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived first, and we were able to get seated while waiting for everyone else. Fantastic service upon arrival and throughout our dinner. We allowed our Greek friend (and Kokkari regular) to do all the ordering, and what an incredible feast we had!\n\nFor starters, we ordered a BUNCH of appetizers. My favorites were the grilled octopus and dolmathes, which are the grapes leaves stuffed with rice, dill & mint. Others at my table most enjoyed the crispy zucchini cakes and beets. Separate dishes. And of course you MUST get grilled pita and dips for the table. Everything tastes so fresh, it's amazing.\n\nOnce we were stuffed with appetizers, wine, and some Greek liquor, the main courses came out. Our friend ensured that we each got some of the lamb chops and ribeye. The lamb chops had this simple lemon-oregano vinaigrette that complemented the natural flavor of the meat, while the ribeye was accompanied by braised greens and potatoes which you can't miss out on. Would recommend both!\n\nAnd because dessert belongs in a different stomach, we shared a few items that I can't remember because I was so deep into a food coma and didn't write anything down. I believe we had the Greek yogurt and Greek doughnuts. Well anyways, everything was fantastic. \n\nI'm not sure how my friend affords to eat here regularly, both in money and time. You seriously need to plan your Kokkari trips in advance, but it's totally worth it. The wait staff members are friendly and helpful, until you overstay your welcome, at which point they will stare you down. The food though... Incredible flavors and portions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-09-03", "description": "We visited this place for our anniversary and both of us were very excited to finally eat here. We've lived in the city for over 15 years and have eaten at some very amazing places, making it a point to try as many restaurants as possible. This however was a major let down. I'm honestly shocked that the reviews are so popular for this restaurant. I expected much more from all of their dishes. We started off with the house bread and some champagne. The bubbly was good, but the house bread resembled something bought at a Safeway store, nothing special. Next we had their traditional house salad. Again the salad could have been prepared by myself in 5 min and resembled produce from a low end grocery store. I expected for that price a much higher quality tomato, since it was the main veggie in the dish. Tomato was bland and a bit unripe. For our mains we both took recommends from the waitress and were very let down. We ordered the pork loin and goat stew. The pork loin was way over cooked and dry, as well as glutinously large. Barely ate any of it. The goat stew was not a stew, but more of a rice dish. The meat was very stringy and jiggly along with the rice very oily. We did not finish our dinners, nor take them home. After paying $180 we left very puzzled. Perhaps we just ordered the wrong dishes. The waitstaff were lovely and the atmosphere nice, but food very average for the price.", "author": "Kristy S."}

At this point, we were so famished and tired from the long trek from SoCal to NorCal and visiting the beautiful Hearst Castle grounds, I thought anything would have tasted absolutely amazing and beyond anything our taste buds had ever experienced in the Greek food world.\n\nWe thought we could wait but about 20-minutes in, I had to go bug the maitre'd and luckily she seated us 10-15 minutes early. During the waiting time we used the restroom, which was so interestingly downstairs, you get to it by using an elevator. Getting sidetracked...\n\nOur waiter barely attended to us and scarcely made any recommendations. Dining at 10pm apparently has the customer service gone out the door, at least from our male waiter. He was the guy hosting the table right next to the fireplace. Other staff seemed quite pleasant with a female host escorting my gal friend to the restroom. \n\nAfter asking for recos, he told us it was all about the lamb chops. My friend asked his reco on the chicken or lamb and he told her they were equally good. She was later quite pissed but did not say anything cause she's super polite and positive. But at $35 for this chicken, it should have tasted better or he could have helped her in the direction of ordering the lamb because she was not happy with her entree one bit.\n\nBacking up a bit, they were out of the lamb riblets appetizer, so we ordered the famous zucchini app (it was pretty good but also very small) and the octopus. The octopus was not worth it for $17 as we could not finish it since it was so charred it was mostly burned. If our waiter had been more attentive, he might have asked what was wrong with the octopus that so many others were raving about--the only excuse I could give is that it was so late, the kitchen staff must have gotten tired and burned our food.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the moussaka which had a nice eggplant cheese covering to it which nicely accompanied what seemed like ground beef. It was like shepherds pie without the corn, potatoes, peas, or carrots and a eggplants creme fraiche covering. It was ok. Noone was in love with it. They could've done something better about the presentation of this dish.\n\nThe lamb shank was the only really good dish. It was huge!!! The Kokkari potatoes complemented the dish well but not sure why they were coined Kokkari potatoes, they weren't out of this world either. \n\nEveryone was underwhelmed and we will likely not return. It's incredible that despite the fact that we were starving, the food did not knock our socks off.", "author": "Kristen Q."}

We didn't get any appetizers or wine just cocktails. My cosmo was great and my husbands old fashioned was made very well. \n\nService was on point and we never were left waiting or hanging. I made reservations on open table pretty easily, just a couple of weeks in advance. \n\nThe other time I came here for work, I got the Monday special which was good but not as good as the lamb chops. This time we also got the Tzatziki, Favosalata and Tirokafteri with grilled pita trio, it was huge and delicious. You could definitely share this with a part of 4 or more. \n\nThis spot caters to the business, local, and special occasion crowd. You can dress up or down, I would say it's business casual.

It is easy to see why.   Everything, literally everything, on this menu is excellent....flavorful, excellently prepared and delivered.  \n\nOn this evening we ordered the appetizer, Tzatziki and Tirokafteri with housemade grilled pita, which is two kinds of dipping sauces with the warm and thick pita bread.  And also a single Horiatiki - the classic Greek salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, oregano, olives & feta.  Both were yum yum yum and was perfect for the three of us.  \n\nThen we went a lamb binge and ordered all three of the variations on the menu.  I had the rotisserie of the day..lamb cooked in the dining room fireplace.  We watched them carry the entire roasted lamb from the fireplace in the first dining room to the open kitchen.  The plate came with three cuts--the shoulder, leg shank and rib.  I also had the must have kokkari potatoes (made with seasoning and lemon--incredible).  That would have been spectacular if not for the lamb skewer and the lamb chops also ordered at my table.   Both were really, really great, but i would say the chops were quite spectacular and I would consider that a must have if you are only going to be here once.\n\nWe ordered a Stolpman Sangiovese which was truly one of the finest I have ever had--round and mellow ($70 on the menu).  They have a great worldly wine list here as well.  \n\nFor dessert we had the also must have Baklava Ice Cream.  This is inventive and super tasty.  We ordered two kinds of ouzo as well.  The Katsouros Ouzu is a bit mellower than ouzos are usually and I recommend that to go with the sweet.  \n\nI have eaten at Kokkarri over a dozen times over the years and I have never had anything that wasn't delicious and wonderful.  This is truly one of the finest restaurants in the country--the only other one I have been that operates at this level of service, food and ambiance is Commanders Palace in NOLA.  This is truly as good as it gets.\n\nHowever, be prepared to pay for the experience.  The bill for three people was $325, plus a $50 tip.", "author": "James S."}

As the great Barney Stinson once said, \"Suit up!\"\n\nKokkari serves what is hands-down the best Greek food in all of the Bay.

They also didn't have much of a lingering gamy aftertaste. The Kokkari potatoes that came on the side were also bomb, with their crispy exterior and fluffy insides.\n\nGLYKA\n// Pagoto Baklava ($9.75) - 4 stars\nI could totally see Baklava lovers go crazy for this unique ice cream flavor.

Last time we wanted to go to Kokkari but could not get in, so this time we made reservation way in advance.\n\nI'm sorry to say Kokkari did not meet expectation.\n\nWe decided to split two appetizers, the zucchini cakes and a special, apriots (plum/apricot hybrid) with yogurt & honey. Agree with Yelpers that zucchini cakes really good. Small portion but it's an appetizer. The apriot was unripe, sour and hard. We both felt if a restaurant has a special made with seasonal fruit the fruit needs to be ripe, otherwise just use oranges.\n\nI had been leaning towards halibut but server said rotisserie special is duck. We agreed my friend would get halibut, I'd get duck, and we'd trade bites. He got the better end of the deal. The halibut and fava puree were both really good. The duck was not. It was fatty & bony, which ducks are, which is why good restaurants work around that. What looked like impressive portion was much less so when I cut all the bones off. Worse, the duck was dry and tough, clearly overcooked, while the skin was flabby and fatty, undercooked. I later talked to a woman in the restroom who said she goes to Kokkari regularly, when I said the duck was disappointing she told me I should never order duck there, get the fish. But they put it on the menu. They should know how to cook it.\n\nDessert, decided we would get the baklava with nut ice cream and the baklava ice cream and split both. Dessert saved the meal. The baklava was good, not spectacular, but both ice creams were really good.\n\nService was attentive and courteous.\n\nIf I ever return I'll get halibut, but frankly I'm disinclined to return.\n\nWe have pictures but for some reason uploading photos not an option?

I arrived a bit early and got a drink at the bar, which was very heavy on the whiskey, and delicious. Joey was our server and took very good care of us, including helping me navigate the menu towards choices that could be made vegan. We split the grape leaves, zucchini cakes and Brussels sprouts and they were all fantastic. The mint in the zucchini cakes put them over the top. I also loved the Kith and Kin Cabernet that I drank.

I dream about these sundaes!\n\nI would highly recommend you ask to sit in Jeff or Johnny's section because the service from both of them was other level along with all the other bussers, food servers and front of house.

I'm a huge fan of Mediterranean cuisine and Kokkari lived up to every expectation. They have lots of bomb specials on rotation, so definitely check them out!\n\nReservations are highly recommended!\n\nFOOD:\n- Spanakotiropita / Filo Pies (5/5) - Sooooo flaky and delicious. The filling is an incredible explosion of creaminess and saltiness.\n\n- Kolokithokeftethes / Zucchini Cakes (5/5) - Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside, these are perfectly complemented by the tartness of the yogurt sauce. I didn't know zucchini could taste so good.\n\n- Octapodaki tou Yiorgou / Grilled Octopus (5/5) - I've never had better octopus. The octopus morsels were grilled to absolute perfection--tender without being chewy. Then they're tossed in an incredible, tangy lemon oregano olive oil that might as well be crack.\n\n- Arnisia Paidakia / Lamb Chops (5/5) - I kid you not, BEST LAMB CHOPS IN THE WORLD. And that's coming from someone who usually hates lamb. The were cooked soooo well and seasoned so perfectly with lemon and herbs. Almost stupidly juicy and tender without any hint of gaminess. The chops are also served with some of the best lemon potato wedges you'll ever have :)\n\n- Psari Psito / Grilled Whole Fish (4/5) - Super fresh with a great char. It's paired with that same lemon olive oil that I still dream about.\n\n- Souvla Tis Emeras / Today's Rotisserie (3/5) - Monday's special was a roasted pork belly/bacon slab thing, but it was unfortunately the least impressive part of the meal. It erred on the dry side and wasn't as flavorful as the other dishes.\n\n- Yiaourti Granita / Yogurt Sorbet & Seasonal Granita (5/5) - The perfect way to end a heavy dinner. The lime (?) granita was SUPER tart, which I actually really enjoyed. It paired very well with the sweet and creamy yogurt sorbet.\n\n- Ekmek Kataifi (4/5) - This was a dessert special of shredded filo layered with fruit, pistachio, and a layer of custard. Kind of reminded me of a coffee-less tiramisu. Really good, but a little too sweet.\n\nAMBIANCE (5/5):\n- Great for any occasion -- birthdays, work events, family gatherings, etc.\n- Beautiful decor\n- Spacious\n- Comfy seats lol\n- Unfortunately the dim lighting makes for some pretty terrible food pics\n\nSERVICE (5/5):\n- Attentive and fast\n- Very knowledgeable about the menu/wines", "author": "Amy T."}

From that standpoint, Kokkari definitely did not disappoint. It was very fancy and the service was excellent. The ambience was very nice. \n\nTo start, we had the zucchini cakes.  They were excellent and I highly recommend them. The crispy outside was fantastic and the yogurt sauce complemented the dish very well. \n\nI ordered the lamb chops because they were rated as one of the top 100 things to eat in the city.  They were fine. They came out and were kind of moderately warm, they'd been sitting a while. The lemon butter sauce they're in was definitely good. But nothing really wowed me. \n\nGirlfriend ordered the lamb casserole. It was like a Greek shepherd's pie. It had a nice cream sauce on top and was good. Again though, nothing suggested this couldn't be made at home. \n\nThe restaurant's saving grace was the dessert, something which wasn't on the menu. I can't remember the name but the waiter described it as shredded phyllo soaked in baklava syrup, topped with strawberry rhubarb jam, custard, creme fraiche, and pistachios.  This dessert was AMAZING!!\n\nUltimately, might go back for the ambience but it's a bit overpriced.

That said, Kokkari is the best place to convert a non-Mediterranean foodie like me :)\n\nThis place is busy, and we had to try two or three times to get a reasonable dinner reservation time. It's located close to the Embarcadero, walking distance from North Beach, Chinatown, and Financial District. The decor is beautiful--an old-world, rustic feel that encompasses almost two long rooms.\n\nWe started with the zucchini cakes, which are a signature dish of theirs and didn't disappoint, and the octopus. The octopus was advertised to us as the best octopus in SF, and I would have to agree. We also had grilled branzino and the spiced lamb skewers (debated back and forth between the lamb chop but chose this). The fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked, and the lamb (while I'm not the biggest fan) was some of the best lamb I've ever had. \n\nIf you're a wino, treat yourself to the $8,900 bottle of old world wine ;) this place has so much wine that they need TWO menus for it.", "author": "Tim X."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "YES, it IS INDEED worth the hype.\n\nBut WHY? This is something no other yelp review could definitively tell me as I obsessively read through them last night before my very first Kokkari experience. Here's my shot at it:\n\n1.) The space is really cool. It's large, warm, and beautifully appointed, with floor to ceiling windows, golden floor lamps, a giant fireplace, stone walls and beautiful tapestries. It's quite crowded, but everyone has enough space. You feel both fancy and also warm and cozy.\n\n2.) There is an atmosphere of jollity--everyone is nicely dressed but the whole room buzzes with conversation and laughter. You get the sense that everyone there is having a blast, but the noise is just the right level, so your own voice doesn't get drowned out and you can hear your dinner companions just fine.\n\n3.) The service is impeccable. The servers have perfect timing, you can always find them when you need them, and their knowledge of the food is outstanding. They can describe each dish in detail--the presentation, the flavors, the preparation--and are excellent menu guides for people like me who can never, ever make up their minds about what to order. Further, if you're someone like me who asks really annoying and specific questions like \"I've never had branzino, what does it taste like,\" the servers don't even blink: our waitress proceeded to explain not only the texture and flavor of the branzino but that of the sea bream and mackerel that were also on offer, in adjectives that can only be described as poetic and that helped me to perfectly imagine the fish. \n\n4.) The food is magnificent. We had the octopus appetizer, the lamb chops, the branzino, the baklava, and the flourless chocolate cake. Each were nothing short of spectacular. \"But WHY is it so good?\" you ask. Because they have perfected the trifecta: 1.) absolutely top-quality ingredients and mind-blowing meats/fish, 2.) simple preparation with minimal ingredients, all of the highest quality, such as olive oil, herbs, and lemons, which allows the incredible flavor of the dish itself to stand alone, and 3.) a kitchen with both miraculous gadgets (I don't know who made their grill but it must have been Jesus, the smoky charcoal flavors effusing the branzino and octopus were to die for) and cooks who can execute Olympian feats of medium-rare or char-grilled mastery. \n\nIt's rare that a restaurant in SF lives up to the hype, but Kokkari certainly does. Do make sure to make a reservation well in advance, and if this is your first time let your server's expertise guide your odyssey through the menu.\n\n(Get it? Odyssey?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-13", "description": "We have eaten at Kokkari periodically ever since it opened. It was a lot better then than it is now. Leave this one to the tourists who are clamoring for tables. Kokkari and sibling Evvia were once stellar examples of a cuisine few restaurants offered after Square One closed up. But nowadays Mediterranean menus are everywhere, and many do the dishes far better than Kokkari.\n\nPros:\n- The feta is outstanding in quality. Really, really magnificent. The tomato/caper relish is fabulous with it. It will also be the most seasoned dish you'll have all night. Kokkari is really timid with the seasoning, which surprised the heck out of us and our 9 other friends.\n- Gigantes (giant beans) excellent, as good as dish as Aziza/SF used to make.\n- Roasted potatoes. Finally some seasoning: the whiff of rosemary and top-notch execution make these simple spuds a genuine gourmet delight. Add in:\n- Tzatziki, which goes well with anything when it's this good (and yes, there are other Med. restaurants that offer spiced yogurt just as good, but not all of them), and is especially good with the roasted potatoes.\n- Special skewer: roasted organ meats. Absolutely perfect: heart, liver, kidney - all lamb, all rare, all excellent; generously sized cubes. Notable since rotisserie lamb was dreadful and scant.\n- The service is excellent. The waitstaff are true professionals, a relief after the ham-handed service most restaurants offer these days.\n\nOkay/Good:\n- Kolokithokeftethes, zucchini cakes. I prefer more delicate ones, but these were good if not remarkable.\n- Marithes Tiganites, crispy smelts. A special, they were good but all of us found the skordalia dip tasteless and boring, as it always is.\n- Soutzoukakia - grilled lamb meatballs. An okay dish, nothing unusual. Meatballs were very firm, the tomato acidity soothed with creamy yogurt. \n- Avgolemono soup. A \"B\" version. It's a chicken broth, good but weak, lightly thickened with egg and flavored with lemon. It's thinner than usual, as there's less rice than most restaurants use. There's a nice amount of chicken in it.\n\nThumbs down:\n- Saghanaki, fried cheese. Cold and like rubber. Go to Three/SMateo or Gold Coast/Alameda to have this done properly, which means flambeed in ouzo.\n- Spanakotiropita, spinach pie in filo. A disaster. Tiny, dry, overpriced. When did spinach get expensive?!?\n- Octapodaki tou Yiorgou, grilled octopus. Tender but stingy. Our party had to cut rounds in half in order to have one tiny bite each. \n- Garides Skordates, roasted prawns. Stick with the Spanish Gambas Ajillo at any tapas place. These weren't very fresh and had little garlic flavor.\n- Hirino, feta crusted Berkshire pork belly with curried cauliflower. Not much seasoning, no real evidence of feta crust in flavor; if cauliflower was curried we couldn't tell. Pork belly was soft and tender, well-executed if not remarkable in overall dish concept.\n- Special: Lamb dolmades. If the waiter hadn't told us some rotisserie lamb had been added, none of us would have known these were anything but rice and feta. Just get the regular dolmades and save yourself some $$.\n- Rotisserie special, lamb. The lamb was overdone and dry. There was no taste of any herbs or spices, just salt. There's a lemon half to squeeze over the dish. The plate was mostly potatoes. There was one slice of lamb and the rest were small shreds. The portion of meat was skimpy for the very high price. We wouldn't recommend ordering any rotisserie items in view of value.\n\nSummary: What Kokkari does well is high-quality food, in a handsome restaurant that's easy to reach. Greek food is not a hotbed of complex spicing, and Kokkari understates even the spicing it does use. The menu is exotic enough to sound daring, but in reality is straightforward: not much different than a good Cal-Italian restaurant. Sub tzatziki for sour cream and you could entertain the most confirmed meat and potatoes lover. \n\nIt's hard to remember there was a time when yogurt and filo, eggplant and lamb, in all their many permutations, were virtually unknown to most diners. But these days competitors are everywhere. Not just the little lunch cafes serving hummus and gyros, but food trucks and delis, even supermarket take-out steamtables. These days Mediterranean food is available in its various ethnic identities: Greek vs Turkish, Southern Italian vs Moroccan, Spanish vs Lebanese. \n\nYou can eat well at Kokkari. It's just that you can eat better, for less, at any of at least 100 restaurants around the Bay Area. Your choice.", "author": "Jean K."}

And the hospitality was as good as, if would have been seated at those nice tables.\nIt is a great place to have your birthday lunch/dinner or come here on a romantic date or just with friends. But make sure you have a RESERVATION!\n\nThe service was perfect to the dot. Our waiter was very knowledgeable. He started off with the specials list and got our drinks and appetizers taken care off right away. The service was not too slow considering a fully packed house.\nWe were served with complimentary bread and olive oil (which by itself was filling up my tummy).\n\nAnd this is what we ordered:\nWe shared 2 appetizers. Spanakotiropita (filo pies) and the Zucchini cakes (as recommended by Stephanie Y). I highly recommend the zucchini cakes. It came with a side of mint yogurt dressing which complimented the cakes so well. There were 3 pieces per order which was perfect for us.\n\nFor the entrees, I ordered the ravioli and my friends ordered the Chicken Souvlaki, which is basically chicken skewers. Since it is the season of Lent, I had to stick to vegetarian food. The ravioli was pretty good and I felt the portion was good enough for me.\n\nI will be back for more. I definitely do want to try the non-vegetarian dishes after Lent.\nThis is one place I didn't mind paying a little more because of all the good food and hospitality. It came up to $45 per person including the tips.\n\nHighly recommend this place!", "author": "Steffi C."}

In fact, it's become tradition and I love it. Every once in a while I head over for lunch and guess what? It's just as good!\n\nLast week, my friend was able to get a last min reservation which is tough to do. I found out that they turn away over 300 calls a day because they are so packed all the time! Crazy huh? Never the less, we were seated with the consistent hospitality that I've experienced every time I've dined there. \n\nWe ordered the following: \n\nFried Smelt (Fries with eyes) - Probably my favorite appetizer. I mean, come on. Fish you can eat like french fries. Just silly. \nOctopus - Tenderized to perfection. \nBranzino (for each of us) - Head on and everything. Lemon, oregano, olive oil over an open flame. Stupid good. \n\nThis place lives up to the hype and more.

I booked the reservation a month ahead to get the time slot I wanted. Reservations are hard to get for the best time frames. The restaurant gives you a coozy, fine dining touch. Decor has warmth with high ceilings. Open kitchen with a fireplace, cooking up chicken, etc. The restaurant is huge and they are fully booked every night. Wow! The bar area is first come first serve. Grab a drink and you might get a seat. \n\nAppetizers:**Kalamari-grilled calamari stuffed with feta. It's so freaken good. The calamari was cooked perfect with the feta, explosion of flavors. \n**Arnisia Plevrakia - grilled lamb riblets - Super tasty, did not have that strong taste you get from low quality lamb. \n**Pantzaria-roasted beets with Greek yogurt & pistachio - YUM. The blend of the yogurt and beets was delicious. Not cheese so its okay to eat a lot and not feel fat. ha! \n\nEntrees: **Arnisia Paidakia-grilled lamb chops (3). IT'S A MUST. Their most famous dish. Not a big fan of lamb but wow, it's super good. Cooked prefect with a good amount of redness. The seasoning was perfect. Not too salty. \n**Goat Stew (Special, off the menu) with soft cheese and artichokes. - My first time having goat. It's like a pork stew. Very tasty, not bad at all. \n\nDessert**Baklava - Traditional walnut & honey baklava with vanilla-praline ice cream - Ordered for the birthday dessert. OMG so freaken good.

I initially was not going to go here because the menu seemed to favor lamb dishes (of course...it is Mediterranean) which my husband doesn't like. But in the end, we did go, and it was really amazing. My husband had the rotisserie of the day which was pork. It was probably the best pork we have ever had in a restaurant. I had the branzino and my son had the salmon. Both of the fish dishes were very good. For appetizers we had the lamb meatballs which were good, and the giant beans and fried cheese, both of which were very good. Tip: They give you a generous portion of bread and olive oil after you order...don't eat it all. If you order an appetizer, the bread will probably come in useful for sopping up the sauces.", "author": "Heather C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-02-08", "description": "I had a subpar experience at Kokkari for lunch years ago but decided to give it another go due to the overwhelmingly positively reviews (both on yelp and from friends), Once again, I'm simply not impressed. \n\nI met up with two girl friends and we ordered 2 apps, 3 mains and 1 dessert. The apps were the lamb meatballs and the fried smelt. Mains were the rotisserie of the day (lamb), the lamb shank and the seabass. And we got the dessert that starts with a 'k' that I can't pronounce.\n\nThe apps were ok, nothing special. I like the smelt more than the lamb meatballs. I thought they probably took too long to bring out the smelt because it's no longer piping hot so not as crunchy as it should be. I thought it was oversalted. The lamb meatballs were pretty bad, I thought. It was too salty and the lamb was too dense and hard, not tender at all. The flavor was tomato heavy, with nothing more than just salty and sour. \n\nThe seabass, which didn't look like seabass to me, was a whole fish. I thought seabass are huge fishes. This one was deboned for us and it tasted more like a river fish. It was too salty and also just not enough aromatics. I like my flavors layers and not one note and this dish definitely fails the test. The lamb shank was also too salty (see a trend here?) and also one note. Throw some figs into the braising liquid or something. I can't taste anything other than salt and it doesn't nothing to bring out the sweetness of the lamb shank. My favorite item of the entrees was the rotisserie lamb. Somehow they managed not to bombard the dish with salt (!) and I could taste more nuance flavors of the meat. I could also taste the herbs they used to marinate the meat. The potatoes were also good.\n\nI think my favorite item of the night was the dessert. It wasn't perfect either. It's fried filo drenched in honey, topped with a pistachio (?) custard and on top of that, creme fraiche. I would have like the dessert much more if they used some sort of short bread crust instead of the slivered filo. The filo was stringy and stale in texture, either crunchy nor soft. It was just weird and unpleasant texture. The custard and the whipped creme fraiche was perfect combination, though.\n\nThe service is OK. The waiter was adequate but the bus boys were really great about refilling waters. Maybe I'm,just too picky, but for the reputation and the price, I expect a much better meal. The food was way over salted and just so one note. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Definitely never coming back here again. It's really too bad because I really wanted to like this restaurant because the decor here is fabulous and romantic.", "author": "Alice W."}

Some of my colleagues had ordered different entrees and said their dishes were just okay so I'm basing my 5 stars on my entree alone.\n\nWe came with a large group for lunch. Reservations were easy to get by phone. The service was exceptional and very attentive the entire time.\n\nWe shared the grilled octopus ($17) and calamari ($13) to start. The plates are rather small so you might need to order several plates of the same appetizer to share if you have a larger group. Both dishes were incredible but I really loved the calamari. They also serve you free bread which is perfect for soaking up the rest of the sauces in the appetizer dishes.\n\nFor my entree I got the grilled lamb chops ($32). It's pricey but if you're on a budget I recommend you try them during lunch over dinner since the price is a lot cheaper then. They were hands down the best lamb I have ever had. The meat was so tender and juicy. The potatoes were equally delicious and had been marinated in the amazing lemon vinaigrette.

All of the staff was polite and even on a table for 2 and as busy as the place was, the manager even came by to ask if everything was good. Why the 3 stars? Because food is everything and it was truly average. My halibut was very good albeit the chicken was so so and insipid.

He introduced items that were not on the menu to us and we ended up ordering most of it. \n\nAppetizers: \nZucchini cake - similar to crab cakes\nOctopus (grilled?) - It was a bit crunchy on the outer, but soft inside.. pretty good for those who loves seafood.\nLamb's tongue - Now this is my favorite appetizer! Very soft and probably because I've had cow's tongue before and really liked it... so I especially like this one too.\nLenthil soup - Veggies, tastes sweet & salty.\n\nMain Courses:\nMy husband ordered the Goat stew is scrumptious! It comes with Greek rice and the flavor is pretty sweet. I would highly recommend this, you will not be disappointed. I ordered Lamb Shank and it was good, but after tasting the goat stew, I wish I would've ordered that instead. Lamb shank was more bland to my taste but the meat is pretty soft. \n\nFor dessert, we had this \"cake\" layer that has a name started with a K (too long to remember). We were in love with this dessert, it's the best. Sort of reminded me of panna cotta. A must try!\n\nSo why 4 stars when I had a great experience?\nMy husband's glass of wine had something floating in it and the waiter took it to the bartender to remove it, but told us it was a new glass that he handed us. We just wasn't favoring the lie.\nAnd at the beginning when we entered the restaurant, we told the host & hostess that we had a reservation. The man host asked for our last name, he was having a hard time with the spelling and looked annoyed with a slight attitude toward me then turned it over to the hostess. \nFor the price we paid for our meals and the classy / fancy presentation that the restaurant tries to deliver to the customers, little things like should be examined by the upper management.

I do think it is a bit overhyped but if you are a lamb lover, this place is a must!\n\nAtmosphere (5) - The atmosphere is great for a dinner meeting, date, or special occasion. It is nice but not too fancy. The first time I wore jeans and a blouse, the next time I wore a nice dress and heels. All in all, you can make it what you'd like (just don't show up in shorts and flip flops). They have a beautiful private room in the back with their wine collection, which could be great to look into for a large party or event! \n\nDrinks (5) - Their cocktails are very good and the bartenders were super friendly! They have an extensive wine list with new age and old age varietals. I highly recommend their wines, the list is great. If you'd like to bring your own bottle, which I did the second time around, the corkage fee is $25/bottle with a max of 4 bottles per table. \n\nFood (4) -  Both times I have been, I have thought the food was good but not necessarily incredible. For appetizers, the Saghanaki is a must!! It is pan fried Kefalograviera cheese and essentially salty goodness. I'm not a huge fan of cheese but I've ordered it both times. Zucchini cakes were amazing too (only two in the appetizer though). For entrees, I am only speaking for fish dishes (since I don't eat lamb/beef). The sea bass was good and the portion is large (entire fish); but all in all, the fish entrees are very simply done and I was expecting more. I also tried the salmon this last time, which had more flavor, but was a bit overcooked. \n\nService (3) - This is where my main \"eh\" is. When you walk in to the restaurant, you can tell that the servers know they work in a great restaurant. I was eyed up and down by a couple of the food runners as they stood in the back near the kitchen area. However, they are very knowledgeable in the food and wines. When I comment negatively on the service, I'd also like to point out that as I was walking out of the restaurant this last time, one of the food runners made a joke to another saying \"that girl is wasted\" and laughing (I didn't hear because I was walking past but my boyfriend overheard as he was following me). They do tend to stand in a huddle near the kitchen and look/make comments to one another. Unfortunately I was not wasted (3 drinks over those two hours), I was just super giddy/smiley since it was my boyfriend's birthday and we had just had a great time. \n\nI debated giving this review 3 or 4 stars. I decided on 4 since it is pretty unique for a Greek food spot. If they improved their service and attitudes, and stopped having all of the food runners just stare at you throughout dinner, I would definitely consider a 5.

He was really friendly and made sure we had what we needed and didn't interrupt us too often to check on us. \n\nWhat we got: \n- Oysters - Nice big oysters that they pair with their homemade sauce which was delicious. Tons of onion, dill, and other spices paired well with the lemon and just made the oysters so great. \n- Grilled Octopus - AMAZING. The octopus was so simple but so tender that it melted in your mouth. We finished it so quickly! \n- Grilled Lamb Chops - Nice and juicy and cooked perfectly at medium rare. Not too gamey either. \n- Lamb shank with orzo - The lamb shank was so tender that it basically fell off the bone, literally. I tried to cut a piece off and the whole things came off the bone. It was so hearty and rich in flavor and with the orzo it was oh so satisfying. \n- Loukoumades - AWESOME. After seeing these made on the food network you know I had to get them. They're basically doughnuts but they're covered with rich honey and and other delicious things that the sweet tooth in me just died.\n- Galaktoboureko - MY OH MY. We couldn't decide between the two desserts so we just got both. This was a great alternative to the sweetness of the other one. Simple yet so tasty. The pistachio ice cream definitely had to be my favorite part especially with the spoon sweet. \n\n***Honestly I can see why reservations fill up so fast for this place and for the raving reviews.

We were super lucky and found street parking.\n\nRESERVATIONS: Must call in advance. I called about a month ahead, OpenTable is showing only a couple days available during the entire next two months so call the restaurant to see if they can take you even if OpenTable says there's no available spots. \n\nAMBIANCE: I immediately felt underdressed when I walked in! This is definitely a special occasion type of place, perfect for date night or girls night out. There are 2 large dining areas, one with a huge fireplace rotisserie cooking the daily special \"spit\" items. There is also a private dining room downstairs by the bathrooms that is nice and quiet and away from the bustling upstairs. If you don't have time for a leisurely dinner, stop at the bar, which stays open between lunch and dinner.\n\nFOOD: we ordered a bunch of small dishes to share and a bunch of entrees which we devoured family style. I've never been to Greece and the only Greek food I've ever eaten is gyros and hummus, so it's hard for me to even compare the dishes that we had to anywhere else because I've never had anything quite like it. We ordered lentil soup, whole fish, meat from the huge rotisserie, octopus, eggplant, and stuffed grape leaves with shredded duck! It was all well prepared and was the perfect way to end my short trip to SF. \n\nSERVICE: top notch. I told our server I had a plane to catch and he made sure we got through all our courses in time.\n\nI had such a short time in SF that I wanted to find a dining experience unlike anything we have in Hawaii.

Inspite of being very busy that night, the food came perfectly on time.\nOur server was professional, very attentive and friendly. \n\nFOOD: The simplicity of Kokkari is part of its charm. The menu is clean and simple. The food is basic Greek but of very high quality and executed with perfection.\n\nWe ordered:\nZucchini cakes ($8) - Its a MUST! The star of the night. These cakes are delish, not soggy at all for a vegetable like zucchini. Its perfectly fried and crispy on the outside. Served with a creamy mint yogurt sauce.\n\nCalamari stuffed with feta ($14) - It didn't live upto my expectation as the stuffing had too much olive for my liking. Didn't do the magic.\n\nLamb chops ($38) - Served a trio, its grilled to perfection. Well seasoned and juicy. Served with potato wedges.    \n\nLamb shank ($35) - Ohh this dish was perfection to the T. The meat fell of the bone, so tender. Served with orzo and sauce, the orzo was perfectly seasoned.\n\nFor dessert our server suggested the Galaktoboureko and we were so glad we went with his choice. This simple looking dish was mindblowing. 2 pieces of filo rolls filled with semolina custard inside, served with the best pistachio ice cream I ever tasted! \n\nKokkari is great to celebrate special occasions.

Nicely flavored but the quality of octopus wasn't the best I had. Perhaps I had too much expectation. Traditional filo pies were good but I wasn't overwhelmed by them.\n\nI ordered grilled lamb chops for my lunch. This one met my expectation.

Finally my niece found a seat at the bar a few feet away from us, ordered some appetizers, but customers rushed ahead of us whenever a place was available so we simply stayed in place. After an hour at our perch, my niece handed us a tiny appetizer plate with two hors d'ouvres. Suddenly a manager, I believe Dimitrios confronted us angrily for eating food when we were not seated at the bar. We tried to explain we had been waiting for a long while, and had ordered things, but others who hadn't been waiting as long as us had taken the available seats. He did not relent: and was obnoxious.

The waiter knew we were sharing the dish so had served us the lamb chops on two separate plates.\n\nThe waiter had told us that the starters are in very small portions and would be be what we expect them to be; he was too right on that... every starter were so small and when they're charging on average $14 per starter dish, the only justification would be their taste. I honestly have to say every single one of them were just disappointing, bland, forgettable, subpar, and worst of all, they were all served lukewarm as if they had been made a while ago. This is just literally the worst Greek restaurant I've been.

I know, shame on me. Then in the early days of courtship, he suggested we eat at Kokkari to introduce my palate to Greek cuisine. I thought Wow, he must really want me to like him!\n\nNeedless to say, Kokkari does not disappoint. The dining rooms are dimly lit and very intimate, and we were set next to the fireplace-looking rotisserie which really made for a romantic setting.\n\nTo start, we ordered the housemade grilled pita bread and chose tzatziki, melitzanosalata (eggplant), and taramosalata (carp roe) as our spreads. It came with dolmathes (stuffed grape leaves), kalamata olives, and pickled vegetables. While tzatziki is definitely one of the most popular Greek dips, I liked the taramosalata the most because it had a very rich, almost caviar-like flavor.\n\nWe also ordered the grilled octopus, spanakotiropita, saghanaki (pan-fried cheese), and lamb riblets. The octopus was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect balance of tenderness and char. The spanakotiropita was a yummy, flaky crisp of spinach and feta goodness, and the fried cheese had a delectably salty yet lemony note to accompany its gooey richness. \n\nHe must have been REALLY excited to introduce me to Greek food because we ordered so much food for two people. I don't know if the waitress forgot our lamb riblets or she just noticed that I was huffing and puffing to finish the appetizers, but I was actually thankful that they didn't come out because I was incredibly full and we still had lamb chops coming. We really must eat with our eyes though because I saw those beautiful, medium rare lamb chops and started drooling again. They were tender and mouthwatering, and they instantly became my favorite part of the meal.\n\nWe ordered galaktoboureko for dessert, aka filo-wrapped semolina custard. It was a delightful union of textures and flavors with the flakiness of the filo, the smoothness of the custard, and the crunchy-creaminess of the pistachio ice cream. It was the perfect ending to an already beautifully executed meal.\n\n------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: I have now eaten here maybe about 5 times. Usually what we've done is order a bunch of mezethes (small plates/appetizers) then skip to dessert. See above for my diary entry and skim for a description of some of the dishes.\n\nMenu items I recommend:\n-Spread platter w/ pita bread: Still get the taramosalata, tzatziki & melitzanosalata, but I also recommend tirokafteri. It's a hot pepper and cheese spread, and I may even love it just as much as the taramosalata.\n-Grilled lamb riblets: Still love the lamb chops, but the riblets are fall off the bone.\n-Octopus\n-Spanakotiropita\n-Branzino (great option for non-lamb eaters)\n-Galaktoboureko over the baklava, but both are good\n\nItems I could skip:\n-Crispy zucchini cakes\n-Grilled calamari (kalamari)\n-Greek coffee (almost like an espresso; really thick with coffee sediment on the bottom)\n-Selection of Greek cookies\n-Loukoumades (Greek doughnuts)", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

Every fish dish we ordered was so fresh! Ambiance was amazing too; like dining in an upscale living room. Great for a conversation too. So worth the $$.", "author": "Nancy K."}

I've been a frequent diner at Evvia for years, so I rolled in here with a good idea of what I wanted to order.\n\nThe lamb chops (duh!), wood oven roasted prawns, and kataifi dessert were amazing. No surprise there. The duck ravioli sounded good, but the filling was too dense. I also tried the baked feta, which turned out to be too salty for my taste.\n\nFor a guaranteed good meal, skip all the frills and fancy shit and just get the lamb chops.", "author": "Suany W."}

The experience was top notch, but the food itself (which should have been the star at a restaurant, am I right?) was lackluster. \n\nKokkari is impeccably decorated and the attention to detail with decor is fantastic. It feels like you're stepping into another world when you walk in and from start to finish you'll be treated like royalty. They really have nailed the service aspect of things- every person my group encountered really seemed like they would bend over backward to make sure our visit was a great one- they obviously take great care and attention when hiring staff!\n\nMy group wasn't overly hungry so we opted for a mix of the \"mezethes\" or appetizers. We got a broad range and got the grilled octopus, hummus & taramosalata dips with fresh pita bread, lamb riblets, grilled artichoke and eggplant skewers and the saghanaki.\n\nI guess the problem with places that are so hyped up is that you expect to be blown off your seat with the food. It was GOOD food, it just wasn't worth the hype in my opinion if that makes sense? Definitely a good meal but nothing was more special than you'd get from any of the other Greek restaurants around town.\n\nIf you're in the mood for killer Greek food my recommendation would be to go somewhere else- if you're in the mood for an overall great experience where you'll feel like a princess and can live with good but not great food then this is an excellent choice!", "author": "Elliott W."}

We UBERed.\n\nFood:\n- Zucchini cakes (actual name is complicated!!), per yelpers suggestions, was our appetizer. It came out to be two thick zucchini cakes, probably the diameter of a tennis ball or so, and some tatziki sauce. It was super delicious, flavorful, and just the right texture. I enjoyed it very much!\n\n- WHOLE FISH is what I ordered. The fish of the day was sea bass which I took grilled with lentils. We were laughing about how this dish could not possibly be a whole piece of fish, but it was! I did SERIOUS damage though. This was super tasty and quite refreshing. I loved squeezing the lemon on which added zest. My only complaint would be that this dish was swimming in oil.\n\n- Pork chop special is what my girl ordered. There were about 5 hefty pieces of pork that were moist and lean, had the right amount of fat. Of course she only ate 3 pieces because she's notorious for never finishing her COFFEE!\n\n-Baklava - Sweet, crunchy, sticky, not bad\n\nOverall, this restaurant is huge but I would still make reservations.

It took months in advance to secure a reservation (yes, they're THAT hot). A brisk 10-15 minute walk from the Pier/Embarcadero, Kokkari Estiatorio is where the party is at in this neighborhood (all else around is a small park, a bank and lots of apartments). In all, parking is quite do-able in this area...but I still prefer to walk (only a 9 minute walk from the Embarcadero bart station). Although the food was good, I was not blown away. Sure, it'll always be a safe location that won't ever disappoint if I were to ever recommend a place in the city to dine at but, at the end of the night, there wasn't much that captivated me/left me lingering to come back for more....except maybe the kolokithokeftethes! Really a 3.5 but I'll round up.\n\nKolokithokeftethes\u00a0- What a tongue twister! They're crispy zucchini cakes/fritters and they were the best dish of the night. Formed into discs of patty perfection, these zucchini cakes look unassuming but once you become acquainted, there is no going back. The zucchini cakes melt in your mouth on first bite. The addition of feta bits in the mix is what makes this dish so sweet and savory. Dip it in the pecso with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing and it's golden.\n\nMarithes Tiganites\u00a0- I've been a fan of fried smelts for quite some time now. These were crispy without being over fried and I was so glad that they weren't drenched in oil- i could attest to this as I may have accidentally wiped my \"greased\" fingers on my white shirt instead of the table napkin. Major fail. After freaking out and then thoroughly examining my top, the stain was only mild and there was nothing to worry about! Phew!   \n\nMoussaka\u00a0- Eggplant, lamb, and potato all strategically laid in casserole form. This dish faired much better than the rest of my group's entrees. I've have overly creamy moussakas before and was quite happy that that didn't occur at Kokkari's! Go ahead and satisfy your tastebuds with this savory dish. \n\nIppoglossa\u00a0-Pacific halibut steak with fregola, spinach, artichokes & a farina pepper puree. The halibut was very bland.

Flavors were still good though. I don't really like chickpeas, but I enjoyed the refreshing acidity and the rest of the components of the salad. I liked the light/tangy tzatziki as well (although I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to eat it with), and the grilled pita was soft and surprisingly delicious.\n\n-GRILLED LAMB CHOPS ($30) - 4.5/5\n[with lemon-oregano vinaigrette and potatoes]\nI tried some of my friend's lamb chops (medium rare) and they were pretty amazing. Super tender and flavorful, but super fatty (although I'm pretty sure that's why they're so good).

If anything, it is some of the clientele that they attract that can truly ruin an experience. On Saturday 10/28, I checked in at 8:30 with a brunette hostess who very politely informed us that a few tables were still paying their tabs and as soon as they got up, they would get my party seated. I could see that they were a bit backed up and I understand that this is by no means the restaurant's fault, as they were doing the best they could for a busy Saturday evening. As I was waiting on the ramp to be seated, a very disgruntled group of four who had been told the same thing about their table caused a disturbing scene. A man from the group got into the poor hostess's face and was literally yelling at her because he had had to wait to be seated. She tried calmly to explain that this was not personal or intentional, and that she was sorry for the inconvenience. This man continued to berate her and became increasingly aggressive until she told him she was going to get a manager. This man then yelled at the manager and yelled, \"I am a CEO!\" My party and I were both appalled and entertained by the sense of entitlement and self-importance. When he started cursing loudly at the manager and drew attention from diners, the manager asked him to leave, and he and his cranky friends stormed out and were saying this was \"racist\". APPALLING. Nothing that any of the staff did was rude, unprofessional, or racist in ANY WAY and I felt compelled to reiterate this. Unfortunately Mr. CEO didn't get what he wanted and calling the service racist seemed to be his only way of vindication. Too bad. \n\nThe food is great, with a nice rustic ambiance that is not too stuffy. You NEED a reservation, unless you are open to standing for awhile to nab a bar seat.

Had the opportunity to dine here with a friend and we really enjoyed our evening here. We had a late reservation so the restaurant was quite empty. This is definitely a restaurant for a special occasion but we were just here for a casual dinner. I recommend dressy attire to fit the classy ambience. It was a beautiful rustic type of atomosphere with tables dimly lit with lamps, throne like velvet chairs, with an elegant bar filled with a wall of liquor. They have no cocktail list, but there is still a wide variety of spirits and wines offered at Kokkari. Be sure to check out the impressive wine list and the wines they offer btg. \n\nThe pan seared greek cheese appetizer was quite ordinary. It just tasted like a good fried cheese. It was amazing with the wine but I did expected something to wow me if I'm paying that price for a medium sized, rectangular shaped with a side of lemon and oregano fried cheese. I was also highly interested in other appetizers such as the baked feta, watermelon feta, zucchini cakes, lamb meatballs, and lamb riblets but a person can only have so many appetizers, right? The grilled octopus was really good, grilled to perfection with a hint of lemon zest, fresh oregano and olive oil as the sauce. Simple, good, but not memorable. There are daily rotisserie specials that are roasted in an open fire in the beginning of the shift. I don't know how I feel about having the rotisserie special late at night when I know that it's made hours ago, hmm. I don't want the ends and bits so I opted for other main plates. Honestly, I wanted everything lamb from the beginning to the end but I told myself to relax and don't get too excited. I ended up having the lamb chops, very very simple (just like the octopus dish, not memorable) three chops nicely grilled but not evenly flavored with a lemon oregano vinagrette and potatoes for a banging forty-six bucks. Let's just say I've had better. \n\nAs for service, I expect better coming from a restaurant like this. It's just not as comfortable when the server and busser try to clear your plate a couple of times before you are done. I get the hint, they want me to move along with my meal but the server should be able to tell that I'm trying to enjoy my meal after the first two times, What's the rush? Prior to ordering, there server just didn't seem enthusiastic overall. Did I have to tell him I wanted a spectacular first time for that to happen? \n\nOverall, very impressed with the establishment itself but the service could be more warm and welcoming and the food can be spiced up a bit. It might or might not been a bad night. I might come to a conclusion that I've ordered the wrong combination of dishes for my meal but don't steer away from trying the other dishes and giving this establishment a try.", "author": "Carrie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-04", "description": "I've been on a bit of a mission to try all three \"highly recommended Greek restaurants\" in NorCal  -   Kokkari, Evvia, and Nemea.   \n\nAfter eating at Kokkari this past weekend I can finally conclude that my favorite out of the 3 is Nemea followed by Evvia and then Kokkari.   \n\nEven though Kokkari only ranks 3rd on my list i'd still recommend it to others.  \n\nHere are the items we got\n\nTaramosalata -  This is the one dish I always get whenever i'm at a Greek restaurant and Kokkari's version does not disappoint.  The flavor and quality is there and the pita bread is on point.  The one thing that kind of made me sad was that their regular bread (the free bread they bring to every table) was not as good as the ones at Nemea or Evvia.  The bread at Nemea and Evvia had this nice slightly burnt char to it and it was even more delicious than the pita bread when you dipped it into the Taramosalata.  If anyone knows if this style of bread has a name please message me!\n\nTraditional whole grilled fish (branzino) -  This was a good dish but not as good as Nemea's version.  The fish itself was slightly overcooked and the spices were not as flavorful\n\nGrilled lambchops -  This was really good and whether or not you like this version or Evvia's version depends on how \"fatty\" you like your lamb.   Evvia's version was super fatty while Kokkari's version was very tender but not overly fatty.  Kind of like Japanese Wagyu vs. USDA Prime.   \n\nRotisserie roasted duck -  This was the off the menu special of the day.  For around ~42 dollars you get about 1/3rd of a duck that is slow roasted on a rotisserie stuffed with an assortment of spices.   I was surprised how similar it tasted like Chinese Roasted Duck....which I personally like better...and I would have been able to get an entire Chinese Roasted Duck for less than 40 bucks.   Not to say the duck here was bad, on the contrary it was quite good.\n\nI know my review makes it seem like Kokkari is more like a 3 star restaurant but I do really think it deserves 4 stars...it's just that when compared to Nemea and Evvia I didn't enjoy the food as much at Kokkari.", "author": "Ben Y."}

There's the lamb meatballs, lamb riblets, the moussaka, lamb shank,  lamb skewers, & lamb chops.  \n\nThe lamb chops are fantastic.  \n\nDon't leave without trying her baklava.

The space almost feels like an intimate dining room in a fancy hotel that is classy and romantic, but also cozy and inviting. The restaurant has a rustic chic type of warmth with wooden accents, plush oriental rugs, and a wood-oven fireplace. The beautiful interior is really only the icing on the cake though because the delicious Greek fare is the real treat!\n\nI've had the fried zuchinni cakes, which are perfection with the pickled cucumbers and creamy tzaziki dressing (cucumber mint and yogurt). I love the contrasting textures and hot and cold combination. I've also had the persimmon salad and the grilled calamari stuffed with feta, olives, and fennel, which was quite good and definitely packed a punch with the intense flavor from the olives. There were so many appetizers that sounded yummy. I'll be back to try crispy duck ravioli, lamb riblets, and fried smelts! I had the goat stew for my entree, which was amazing! I wasn't sure what to expect with goat meat, but it was so tender and flavorful and the orzo was a nice complement. The portion was also generous and is enough to split between two people. \n\nThe Kataifi Ekmek is a must-get dessert with a uniquely textured shredded phylloh dough, honey, custard, and whipped cream. It was SO good. We thought the desserts would be tiny, so we ordered rice pudding as a backup, but both portions were huge! I actually had to take some home...and if you know me that never happens! \n\nThe service here is really quite excellent. The food comes out at a good pace and the servers are knowledgable about the menu and happy to give suggestions. I also rarely find servers that are not only attentive and friendly, but respectful with how they both approach you and clear your dishes. They even offered to keep our dishes warm for us when one of us left the table, which earned them big brownie points!\n\nLately, I've had a string of bad luck with \"fine-dining\" restaurants disappointing me.

The tzatziki was excellent, probably the best I've ever had, and both of us agreed later that it was the best part of the meal.\n\nThe entrees were a huge disappointment.  I had the halibut and it was full of large bones and way overcooked.  I'm not the type to send it back and it was edible, so I ate it.  My companion had the soggy ravioli, which tasted ok but  was certainly nothing special.  These dishes were both misses.\n\nFor dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake.  It was super rich.  I really like flourless chocolate cake, but this one was a too rich for even my taste.  Not bad, but not good either.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of pinot and they must have stored it next to the oven.  It was way too warm, even well above room temperature.  I was going to ask the waiter to chill it, but he had just dumped half the bottle in our glasses already, so there was no point unless I wanted half too warm and the other half too cold by the time I got to it.  They have a nice wine list, they just need to educate their servers on some wine basics to keep from ruining it.\n\nThe quality here has severely dropped and they are living off their reputation with tourist business or we hit them on a bad night.

There's nothing like some stimulating palate foreplay before you conquer an exotic set of moist lamb chops. Mmm. \n\nYeeeep, I thoroughly appreciate the savory flavor of a good dirty martini. Not only did we have a great experience with our drinks, also with the food and service here. Due to impromptu dinner plans, my fianc\u00e9 and I had to resort to bar seating. Though we didn't score a table, we were delighted by our overall dining experience at the bar. Special thank you to barkeepers, Tony and Fatah, for their warm hospitality. \n\nPopular restaurants can often succumb to their own success, but according to all the glowing reviews of this superb place, service and food seem to stay consistent. We actually prefer the experience we had here, compared to the one we had at its highly revered sister restaurant, Evvia, in Palo Alto. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n+  Octapodaki tou Yiorgou (Grilled octopus): This one excited me, so I would definitely recommend this as an appetizer. Perfectly firm, yet oh so fork-tender, flavorful grilled octopus. The fragrant lemon, oregano, and olive oil coating on each piece of octopus made this app even more scrumptious. \n\n+ Goat stew (not on menu, need to ask server): I heard about the hype regarding this specialty dry stew, so I wanted to request for it. Some people have reservations about goat, but I did NOT think it was off-putting/gamey at all. Chunks of goat were savory and tender and I really liked the soft cheese in this stew. Hearty, delicious stew, BUT nothing memorable. We agreed we wouldn't order this next time. \n\n+ Arnisia Paidakia (Lamb chops w/ lemon oregano vinaigrette): Medium-rare cook was perfect and this aromatic dish was beautifully seasoned. Disappointed by the side of 'Kokkari potatoes' it came with. The potatoes were unappetizingly tough. \n\n+ Galaktoboureko (Semolina custard filo with blood orange spoon sweet and cr\u00e8me fraiche ice cream): This was thee climax, at least for me. Surprisingly delish, simple, egg-roll looking things. Crisp. Warm. Delectable. Even my fianc\u00e9 stole a few bites and he doesn't even appreciate sweets! I wasn't feeling the blood orange zest though, so I shoved this to the side--too intensely tart for my taste. Nevertheless, this is a MUST for dessert.\n\n+ 5 stars overall dining experience\n+ 5 stars for its handsome, sizable venue and cozy, exotic ambiance \n+ 4 stars for food: Hearty meal, nothing complex or monumental  \n+ Be sure to call at least 2-3 weeks in advance to secure your table reservation\n\nSuperb service was EVERYTHING here. You'll definitely feel taken care of.\n\nWe will be back when our wallets permit! ;(", "author": "Merica S."}

We started with the grilled octopus, one of my favorites. It was wonderfully tender (they marinate) yet still had enough tooth feel to satisfy.  It was deliciously seasoned.  Avgolemno was just like my aunt's.  Not overly thickened and just the  right amount of lemon.  The romaine salad was delicious, although a dressing of  feta and kalamata olives is inherently salty and the large plate was easily a splitter.  The chops were exceptional. Tender and perfectly cooked.  Simply but nicely seasoned.  The lamb shank and orzo was really good, with a great lamby saturation to the orzo that reminded me of Yiayia's.  The final test was Galactabourdico.  While not the same sheet pan preparation as Y's (so less custard) it was crispy and delicious.  We loved the atmosphere, which is comfortable and cozy.

When we arrived (at 8 pm on a Tuesday), it was pretty crowded, and remained so the whole night (was still popping when we left after 10).\n\nOur waiter was very nice, though I was slightly annoyed that we had to ask him about the specials (rather than him volunteering that info), when I heard him explain them to other tables unprompted. And there was a fairly long wait between dishes. Overall, though, a delicious birthday dinner! We ate...\n\nSaghanaki (pan fried cheese) - The lemon juice balanced the fat perfectly; great crunch from the pan frying, but gooey in the middle. I tried it with their pita, but I think it shines best by itself. \n\nOktapodaki tou Yiorguo (grilled octopus) - Fantastic; so soft and not a bit chewy. I was hoping for a little more crunch from the grilling, but overall it was great. The micro-greens paired perfectly.\n\nArnisia Paidakia (grilled lamb chops with \"Kokkari potatoes\") - Very yummy; I was lickibg my fingers (...and the lamb bones...). The \"Kokkari potatoes\" turned out to be fairly unremarkable potato wedges - fine, though slightly on the dry side.\n\nPagoto Baklava (Baklava ice cream) + side of hot fudge: Noth quite yummy and satisfying! Our waiter was a bit surprised at my request for fudge, but I was not about to have an entire birthday go by without eating chocolate, so that was non-negotiable. They were super generous with it, though - it came in a little gravy boat, and tasted great with the ice cream (...and alone )\n\nGalaktoboureko (basically an egg roll filled with semolina custard; served with a scoop of pistachio ice cream and some quince paste): Quite good, but I think the ice cream was better.", "author": "Liz F."}

The octopus appetizer was good- the rest of all of it was mediocre at best. A manager never came by to apologize for the red wine spill or the wrong entree order. They didn't offer to buy us desert, a glass of wine or take care of their many mistakes in any way. At the  end of the night when we were in the front of the restaurant putting on our coats a manager asked us to \"move out of the way\" for a seemingly more important guest. He was arrogant and rude!

It was only 6pm when we arrived and the restaurant was almost full.\n\nWe ordered Kolokithokeftethes (zucchini cakes) as a starter, Arnisia Paidakia (grilled lamb chops) for my entree, and lamb rotisserie special for his entree.\n\nWe were so hungry waiting for our food that we munched on the free bread. The zucchini cakes were very delicious but they were tiny for $11.75.\n\nI really enjoyed the lamb chops and they were cooked to perfection. I know that my date had food envy because my entree was much better than his. The lamb rotisserie had too much meat and not enough veggies to balance the meal.\n\nFor dessert, we shared an order of baklava.

The only other way to dine here without a reservation is to scope out a spot at the bar or get a really late reservation. \n\nIs it worth the 1.5 - 2 hour wait for bar seating? Maybe not but if you can get a reservation - it's a great spot to check out for Greek. \n\nThe decor is beautiful - nicely adorn with wood accents, gorgeous center fireplace (where they roast the meat specials), classy furniture, chairs, table tops, and nice bar setup. The restaurant isn't that big - small to mid-sized - the crowd tends to be older.\n\nThe bartender was personable and recommended a great sweet reisling. I scoped the place out for a business dinner and the hostess/host were super helpful in doing their best to try and secure me bar seats as I didn't have a reservation.\n\nThe menu had a good selection of appetizers, main entrees, and a number of specials. We tried the appetizers - skordallia and a cheese dip which were both delicious. The octopus app was ok - a bit too charred/smokey tasting for my liking. The grilled lamb riblets were amazing though - tender/ flavorful , a must try.\n\nMain entrees - my boss got the lamb special that they were roasting on the fireplace and I got the grilled fish. Both were delicious - the fish cooked and seasoned perfectly. The lamb special was amazing - super tender. \n\nFor dessert - we got the greek yogurt drizzled with walnuts and honey - out this world - the yogurt was definitely fresh and made in house - the light sweetness of the dates/walnuts/honey paired super well with it. The Galaktoboureko - custard in filo dough with ice cream - delicious as well. The dessert was the standout in my opinion. \n\nGreat option for fancy greek but make a reservation. You don't want to be stuck waiting over an hour at the bar.", "author": "Brenda L."}

You mix all of these together and what do you get? Kokkari. \n\nCame here on Easter Sunday night to celebrate my Dad's birthday and we all had an amazing time. I reserved our table one month in advance and we arrived 20 mins early to our reservation, they were able to accommodate us and sat us down right when we walked in! The atmosphere is classy and elegant. Our server was very well-mannered and explained to us the popular items on the menu, the specials of the day, and gave us the time to decide on what we would want to order. \n\nFor appetizer, we got the recommended grill octopus, fried zucchini cakes, and the fried smelts. The fried zucchini cakes were soo delicious! It was rich and creamy, a hint of cheese, and the side of cool tzatziki sauce was the perfect sauce to balance out the heavy flavors. The fried smelts were good but I would skip this next time. The side lemon garlic hummus was great though. Last but not least, the grill octopus!! Sooo good. Big meaty chunks of octopus grilled to perfection, a little lemon juice on top, it was perfect. We all enjoyed this dish a lot. \n\nFor entrees, we got their lamb chops at medium rare, rotisserie special of the day - roasted goat from napa, and the braised lamb shank. The lamb chops, wow, seriously super delicious. They were so soft, so succulent, so juice, so perfectly seasoned and the side of lemon was excellent to balance out the fattiness and also bring out the flavor. After I sliced the meat out from the bones, I went for it with my hands and ate every little edible piece off the bones. My sis's roasted napa goat was phenomenal as well! The goat had a bolder taste than our lamb chops and the seasoning was also more dense in flavor. My sister enjoyed it a lot. My dad's lamb shank was very tender and the meat was pretty much falling off the bones. Very good. We also thought the yukon potatoes were also very sweet and tender, delicious. \n\nWhen our waiter came around to check in on us, I told him that it was my Dad's birthday. He knew exactly what to do and asked for my dad's name and what I want to order as the dessert. He proceeded to come back with ice cream on a bed of dulce de leche with a lighted candle and happy birthday words. The presentation of the dish was beautiful! I think my Dad was smiling all the way to his ears. We all sang our birthdays softly and dug right in. The ice cream was very creamy, smooth, and the dulce de leche was sweet. Maybe a tad bit too sweet for me but I was never really a sweet tooth person. \n\nAfter a month of preparation (of my wallet), finally I find myself to the big bill that came at the end of our meal ($270 w/ tips). I think for everything Kokkari has to offer, the price is right and well worth it. It was a wonderful dining experience. My family was still talking about it the week after our Kokkari meal.", "author": "Hoyan L."}

Finally, I decided to make the reservation after my white coat ceremony to celebrate with my parents. Kokkari provides you fine dining with excellent service at a price that for San Francisco standard's is not too bad. To go down the list of food:\n***Kolokithokeftethes: a zucchini latke, maybe I'll make them for Hannukah next year\n***Marithes Tiganites: my father was obsessed with these and said they reminded him of his childhood on the Black Sea and he has never seen them in the states since we moved here two decades ago\n***Arnisia Plevrakia: well seasoned bite size lamb pieces\n***Avgolemono: tangy tasting soup - if you are a soup fan, I say give it a try\n***Arnisia Paidakia: this is the hallmark dish of Kokkari. Now, for some backstory, my mother cooks excellent lamb chops. Therefore, these chops were good, just as good, but not super out of the ordinary for me. However, if you do not eat lamb chops often or did not grow up eating them, then I am sure you will love them. This is the best lamb chops I have had outside of my mother's kitchen. \n***a goat goulash special that day (not on the standard menu): full of flavor and delicious\nOverall the savory dishes were delicious, felt homemade, and were accompanied with excellent service. However the dessert, I was honestly not as big of a fan of:\n***Galaktoboureko: nice pistachio ice cream, but kinda bland custard\n***Loukoumades: this is probably the type of dish you love if you ate it growing up, but otherwise, it is just a regular sweet donut\n\nThis also seems like a great place for a formal dinner party.", "author": "Nikita K."}

This is one of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at in the SF area (which to be fair, is not many, but they were all carefully selected). \n\nThe restaurant itself is rustically beautiful. We were seated at a large family-style table right in front of the partially open kitchen. \n\nService was top-notch. Our server was incredibly friendly and really made our experience better. With a party of seven you assume something will come from the kitchen wrong but not a single thing did. He effortlessly managed our entire experience like a pro. \n\nWe tried the following:\nAPPETIZERS:\n- Dolmathes - grape leaves stuffed with rice, dill & mint ($9.25): very lightly stuffed, which actually allowed for better flavor. The grape leaves were so tender. \n- Zucchini Cakes - with cucumber & mint yogurt dressing ($12.00): fantastic. Absolutely delicious. \n- Saghanaki - pan fried Kefalograviera with lemon & oregano ($16.00): this is basically a fried cheese topped with herbs and a squeeze of fresh lemon. It's bright and summery. Recommended! \n- Grilled Octopus - with lemon, oregano & olive oil ($17.25): yes to this one! So good, and beautifully plated. \n- Tzatziki, Favosalata or Tirokafteri with housemade grilled pita ($10.00 each): we selected these three of the five options available and they came on a platter with pita, stuffed grape leaves, fresh cucumber slices as a crudite, and pickled vegetables. The pita was so very light; apparently it is cooked with Greek yogurt for fluffiness and tastiness. The whole table enjoyed all the dips. \n\nENTREES:\n- Greek Salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, feta, oregano & olives (appetizer size is $13.50 and entr\u00e9e size is $17.75): we split two of these for the table. This is not the iceberg lettuce salad you envision but a large serving of roughly chopped veggies. Really yummy!\n- Whole Fish, traditionally grilled with braised greens, lemon & Cretan olive oil (market price): options the day we visited were local sole or Mediterranean sea bass AKA branzino, the sole being the smaller portioned of the two. Quite tasty!\n- Lamb Souvlaki - lamb skewered with tomato, onion, bay leaf with chickpea salad, tzatziki & pita ($26): the chickpea salad was especially on point but the lamb was also very tender and cooked perfectly. Large enough for two to split, honestly! \n- Moussaka - traditional casserole of spiced lamb, eggplant, potato & yogurt b\u00e9chamel ($25): while this may be a bit heavy for a lunch item, it was hands down the best thing I tried. Think of this as the ultimate comfort food! So tasty! \n- We also tried the special of the day: short ribs on a bed of housemade pasta. Honestly, this one was not noteworthy compared with the rest of the dishes - but I'd venture that is a rare miss as everything else was great. \n\nDESSERT:\n- Rizogalo: arborio rice pudding with honey roasted pear ($10): delicious.

My girlfriend and I came here on Saturday to celebrate our anniversary and this place turned out to be the perfect spot! Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by the friendly staff and seated at our table which was right next to the giant bread table/roasting fire (it was a little hot at first, but then it cooled down).\n\nAppetizers:\nSpanakotiropita - delicious pies that were warm and well balanced with feta and spinach. Best I have had.\nZucchini Cakes - pretty good with the yogurt!\n\nEntrees:\nPork Shoulder Special - roasted for 48 hours. So tender and moist... amazing! The olive oil/salt dressing on the side was excellent. I really liked how they served a lot of meat and topped it with a few pieces of chicharr\u00f3n which was delicious too!\nSea Bream Special - very good! This was roasted as well. It was a little on the firmer side and not as flaky compared to sea bass and halibut, but it was still very soft. It did have more of a ocean/fish flavor, but that just added to the fresh taste. The fish was huge!\n\nDessert:\nBird's nest (made from wheat shavings) topped with homemade dulce de leche ice cream and caramel. It wasn't too sweet and the crunchiness from the nest made it a nice end to our meal. Coffee was good too!\n\nThe ambiance is very warm and personal with floor lamps and large cushioned chairs adding an elegant feel. The service was great and our waiter really took the time to explain everything and answer our questions. At first we thought the place was small, but after walking back to the restrooms (which are in the basement) we saw how big it really was. The front part of the restaurant seemed more formal than the back. If you come on the earlier side you may get lucky and find street parking (it's worth looking) if not they have valet.

I've lived in the mediterranean and this is real, authentic mediterranean food. The karides are off the damn charts good, as are the fish. LOVE that both are served whole, with the heads still on - that's how it's supposed to be. Everything is just so, so good. The olive oil is like the stuff you get freshly pressed from small producers in the Turkish countryside. The olives are pure heaven.

It was a great experience then, so it seemed appropriate that when it was my last day at my first job out of college, I had my goodbye lunch here... \n\nWe showed up right on time for our noon reservation, and it was PACKED! We were squished at the front with everyone else who were here for their rezzie. Poor supply chain management.. But we were promptly showed to our table for 2 and brought waters and menus and yummy acme bread. The restaurant is quite large, and the decor is nice. You can also see the whole animals roasting out on the fire pit. Pretty cool. \n\nWe ordered - spanakopita, lamb riblets, flaming cheese, and lamb chops. All were good. But not amazing! It was sad.. :( Chops were definitely the best item we ordered - tender and juicy and flavorful. The cheese was not a hit with my friend - too salty, but I enjoyed it with the bread. I also need to find out what olive oil they use - it's soooo good.\n\nThey have a great wine list - by the glass and bottle and magnums. Nommmmm.

Go big or go home people. This was so, so good. Up there with the top 3 I've had. It doesn't get much better.\n\nI know this place is pretty spendy but we didn't think it was terribly priced and portions sizes were generous. Perhaps being from DC we are used to $75+ dinner bills.

Neither of us were familiar with Mediterranean food and had no idea what to order from the menu. Luckily, our server was super nice and made some recommendations. \nWe ended up ordering grilled octopus, stuffed grilled calamari, crispy baked duck ravioli, and the goat stew. The octopus and calamari were tender and not rubbery, which is alway appreciated. The goat stew was recommended to us by our server and we thoroughly enjoyed it even though I had never tried goat meat before. The duck ravioli tasted fabulous and I completely regret not ordering more of it. I will not make this mistake next time.\nThe food is definitely pricey here.

Having taken the aforementioned precaution, I was quite blown away by the size and classy interior of the restaurant.  Granted, I was already excited about getting lunch with three very good friends, but Kokkari definitely heightened the experience.  \n\nThanks to a bit of Yelp research beforehand, between the four of us girls we got the zucchini cakes, grilled lamb meatballs, and wood fired prawns for starters as well as the Tuesday special and lamb souvlaki.  Our waiter was very helpful in making suggestions as well.  Among the appetizers, I preferred the zucchini cakes: rich and almost cheesy.  The cake was offset by the freshness of the yogurt and cucumber that accompanied it.  The meatballs with sour cream in the sauce and the prawns were tasty as well.  Wasn't as much of a fan of the bread; bit too cold and tough for my taste.\n\nAs for the entrees, the souvlaki hirino was huge, a sort of greek wrap that did not lend itself to dignified eating.  Inside were pieces of pork, a portion of veggies, and a white mayonnaise like sauce.  Very filling.  The lamb was a bit tough, but the side dishes that accompanied helped with the chewiness of the meat.  \n\nAltogether we each paid $24, so about $96 in total.  I hesitate to give the restaurant 5 stars because while the food was delicious, it was not truly mind-blowing for me.  The initial bites of every dish were amazing, but slightly greasy tastes started creeping in towards the end.  In any case, the service was fantastic, the interior design of the restaurant (complete with roasting spit on the fireplace) was a pleasure to behold, and ultimately we were all very satisfied with our dining experience.

Fun fact - online reservations don't seem to be available between 6:30 and 8 pm.\n\nLOCATION.\nParking is hard to find, so you'll probably end up shelling out the $12 (!!!) for valet parking, but it will be a time saver. It's situated on a corner near the Embarcadero, so if you're seated next to a window, you're bound to see someone vastly less fortunate than yourself (I'm assuming if you're eating here you can afford to, and then some) wandering past. Definitely a humbling reminder to be grateful for what you have.\n\nSERVICE.\nThe majority of my time at Kokkari was absolutely fantastic. Our waiter was witty, attentive, offered great advise on the menu, actually called dishes by their appropriate Greek names, and was genuinely engaged with us. However, once we received our entrees, it felt like we dropped off the radar of our waiter. It kind of felt like a \"welp, you've most likely spent the max amount you will at this point, bye\", which is not a great experience. He came by exactly two times after that - once to drop off dessert menus (and disappear for 15 minutes), then to drop off the bill (and then disappear for another 15 minutes).\n\nTHE FOOD.\nWe ordered the following below, as well as one of their appetizer specials I'm blanking on right now:\n++ GRILLED OCTOPUS\n- SAGHANAKI (far too rich & small portion-wise)\n+ GRILLED LAMB CHOPS\n+ ROASTED LAMB\n\nThe grilled octopus was my favorite part of the meal. I'm not a big meat & potatoes kind of gal (despite my upbringing), so I found the entrees a bit too heavy, although delicious. I foolishly ate half my plate and assumed the waiter would box up the rest when he took my plate, but nope, chucked it in the bin, so that was a bummer.\n\nPRO TIP: \nNo complimentary birthday desserts are offered here, so just keep that in mind. I didn't really come in expecting anything, but was surprised when there was nothing. I guess it's become such a common thing at both nicer and more casual restaurants, it was odd to see the opposite.\n\nI definitely understand the hype behind Kokkari, and I had a relatively nice experience, but not enough to want to come back (especially with the bill we racked up!).", "author": "Claire S."}

It is renowned in San Francisco for delicious Greek food and exceptional service. Kokkari is not an every night kind of restaurant, but great if you are looking to celebrate something special. Be sure to make reservations in advance. \n\nThere menu consists of all things Greek. We started off with some drinks at the bar, which we took to our table once it was ready. Instead of ordering a main plate each, we choose several of the appetizers, this way we made sure we could try a greater variety of dishes. Some of the favorites out of all the plates we tried were: Zucchini Cakes, Lamb Short Ribs, House-made Grilled Pita with Tzatziki. We also finished it off with some dessert, an amazing sundae - The Kokkari Sundae - with chocolate and vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and toasted hazelnuts. \n\nOverall, my experience at Kokkari was great. It certainly lived up to the hype. From the brick oven where they cook the pitas, to the open kitchen concept, you really feel like you're getting an authentic Greek experience!", "author": "Aletta B."}

Great for dates and special occasions--especially if you enjoy lamb, seafood, or Greek food in general.\n\nReservations can be tough to come by, but trust me that the pain is worth it. First off, the decor feels like a refined friend's home as the dark paneled wood and comfy chairs give an intimate atmosphere. Tables are close enough that you feel like you're all enjoying the fine dining together, but not so close that you can hear others' conversations. \n\nThe food of course is the main star. Of the appetizers, I've tried the lamb meatballs and the lamb riblettes. Well seasoned, perfect portioned, and just enough to whet your appetite. From there, you move onto the main course, where I would recommend the traditional whole grilled fish or the lamb casserole. I've eyed the rotisserie of the day multiple times though, and it has also seemed a solid choice as well.\n\nService is dutiful, informative, and prompt. I would advise against the Ouzo sorbet, though, which was cloyingly sweet. \n\nAll in all, a beautiful restaurant to enjoy a hearty and well-sculpted meal. Come here for a solid dining experience--none of that pretentious air of some other restaurants. Just friends and good food.", "author": "Irene C."}

After seeing this on the Yelp 100, it rose up on my list to try. \n\nGrilled Octopus - This was just delicious! They were very tender and had a great charred flavor. My only complaint was I wanted more. I wish I got the whole octopus.\n\nLamp Chops - Ordered medium rare just like how I like my steaks. It came out perfect. I love the presentation of it. There's 3 chops and the meat was very tender and flavorful. I couldn't resist but pick the meat off the bones. It was served over their roasted potatoes.\n\nRotisserie Duck - This was their special for the night. I was debating from their duck or chicken after seeing them roasting in the fire in the back. This was their take on a Peking duck. Half the bird was served over the roasted potatoes. It was very meaty and the flavor was spot on. They really pulled this off right.\n\nBaklava Ice Cream - Dessert... one of the most important parts of a meal. I was very excited to try this. They basically blend in baklava into the ice cream and put baklava honey over it. It came with three scoops. Great to share but I was tempted to just get my own.\n\nParking in this area is generally hard to find but they do offer valet parking. I came here via muni so I didn't have a problem.

Even if you aren't as fortunate as us in getting a window seat, you'll be pleased with their other options. There are several areas to the restaurant with rooms for larger groups so make sure to inquire about the private room as well. Bar area is cool and spacious but my guess is finding a seat is a real crap shoot. Wine is affordable and we ventured out and were referred to a wonderful bottle of greek wine. We done! \n\nAppetizers are yummy as we did what most people have done in ordering the baked cheese and octopus. Don't fight it just do it! You won't be sorry. \n\nDinner was magnificent.

As a group we ordered the zucchini cakes (5/5, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside with an amazing yogurt mint sauce), octopus (4.5/5, very tender and flavorful, but the charred grilled flavor was a bit overwhelming), lamb tongue (4/5, very tender, mild lamb flavor).  \n\nFor the main course I ordered the lamb shank (4.5/5).  It was a large portion, very tender and a delicious mild lamb flavor.  It was served over a bed of orzo pasta with some myzithra cheese. \n\nThe others got the goat stew special (5/5), fresh fish of the day, and lamb skewer.

You'll thank me later. \n\nWe started with a nice selection from the small plates menu: fried zucchini, fried cheese, and a hummus platter with a decadently fluffy pita I will spend the rest of my life trying to find. Save plenty of room in your carb budget for not only the pita but also the wonderful, freshly sliced bread with fresh olive oil.  We also ordered the lamb meatballs, and I seriously could have eaten these items as my meal. \n\nIf you're on a budget, I would still recommend giving this a try, especially if you're with other people. You can craft a nice little meal out of the small plates, get to try a lot of different flavors and order a glass of wine from the wonderful wine list.

It comes with two sizable pieces that you can cut up.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.\n\nENTREE\n\nPsari Psito - traditional grilled whole fish with horta & lemon\n- I've tried the bass and the fish that's similar to a snapper (I don't remember what it's called).  You can have the main bone taken out, or the fish as a whole.  Either way, it does take time to eat it, but savoring every bite is the best way to do it.  Flakey, scrumptious, and so delicate.\n\nKotopoulo Souvlas - lemon-oregano chicken roasted with baby leeks & Kokkari potatoes\n- Very succulent and juicy.  \n\nArnisia Paidakia - lamb chops grilled with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes\n- I'm not usually a lamb person.  I have very sensitive taste buds and it's usually always too gamey for me.  But every time I come here and try any lamb dish, I'm just simply in love with it.  This particular dish was just spot on.

You genuinely feel like family when you dine here.  I love every moment of it.\n\nOh, and don't forget to snap a picture of the rack of lamb on the rotisserie in the fireplace when you first walk in :)\n\nRandom note to self: Get a bottle of Schug (pinot noir) to pair with a heavier fish and a lamb dish.

With a living room setting, extended room in the back place and a rotisserie oven on public display (that night was roasted duck), the ambiance was romantically undeceivable!\n\nIt was a lamb theme that night when ordering, indecisively.  Lamb riblets, lamb casserole and lamb chops.  Everything was lamb besides the red wine, sparkling San Pellegrino water and scrumptious dessert, Kataifi!  Their lamb riblets were commendably tender and falling off the bone!  Use the oil that's flavored with the tasty lamb riblets, as a dipping sauce with the complimentary bread!  Lamb casserole was hearty, but I think it could have been substituted with something better.  Their lamb chops passed - cooked as I wanted, medium rare and tasted nice.  I've had better spiced and flavored up lamb chops before.  Of course, red wine was ordered to compliment the tasting of lamb.\n\nWhat caught me off by surprise, which was recommended well by our server who spoke Greek fluently, was their Kataifi as dessert!

Lady on the phone said check-in earlier can probably get us seated before reservation time. We got there less than 10 minutes, by 7:45.\n\nThe receptionist told us a 30-45 minutes wait. Checked after half an hour as instructed, receptionist said that next seating is at 8:30, so she needs take care of that first. Respect that, continued to wait despite that no one ever checked on us. Back again around 8:35, this time she said that she doesn't know if they can seat us early since our reservation is in an hour. What a convenient excuse. \n\nNo way we'll wait for a table, we've decided to leave and cancel. Just right when I walked out of the door and pulled out the opentable app to cancel this reservation, I already received a cancellation email via opentable from the restaurant at 8:40. \n\nIt is RUDE to make us wait an hour if you didn't wish to serve us in the first place. \n\nI can SEE that the restaurant is super small, so it's okay to tell us that you DON'T take walk-ins and we'll just leave. I've called TWO HOURS in advance and you said YES. After ONE HOUR wait INSIDE the restaurant, you informed us that walk-ins cannot be accommodated. This is NOT a new restaurant, you should probably know better your table turnover rate. \n\nOn a Friday night, I would never expect to get seated right away at any popular spot. An hour plus wait for restaurant is reasonable and understandable without a reservation. Waiting is not the issue, but how this management handles situation like this is surprising and unacceptable, especially since the receptionist also had another employee standing next to her this whole time. \n\nFine dining experience is more than just delicious food, the \"experience\" suggests the involvement of at least some customer service. This is not my first time dining out in SF and never had I have any seating issue before. Apparently, I'm not the only one who have experienced bad service at this place based on other reviews.", "author": "Ivy F."}

The stuffing was cheesy and gave the zucchini a richer flavor.  Yogurt dressing was refreshing and helped round out the other rich and fatty flavors. \n\nSaghanaki  - Delicious gooey pan fried cheese. It was salty and slightly sharp but generally pretty mild so it won't offend anyone. The crisp edges added more flavor and texture. Great on bread.\n\nGrilled Octopus - Grilled well, but I wasn't a fan of the texture. The way they prepared it made the octopus really soft. I think the natural springy texture of octopus is fun to eat so this didn't really do it for me. I guess softening up the octopus helps prevent the tough, rubbery texture when it's overcooked, but without the springiness, I thought it was kinda boring. An easy solution to this is to just not overcook the octopus. Then they won't need to soften it.\n\nGrilled Lamb Riblets - The lamb riblets were grilled well and had a flavorful sear. The execution was on point as the meat was tender but not to the point where it's meat mush. The meat held its structure but still slid off the bones easily. \n\nGoat Stew - The waiter described the stew being made with spices like nutmeg and allspice, but I didn't really taste much of that spice component. It still wasn't bad though. The goat was tender, and the cheese gave the stew more richness and aroma. The stew had enough basic seasonings like salt, but it would've been perfect if there were more of those warm spice flavors. \n\nMoussaka - Pretty good. I thought the stuffing of the moussaka had the warm cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice flavors that were missing in the goat stew. The creamy bechamel helped layer out the flavors of the stuffing to make them more palatable and easier to enjoy.  \n\nGrill Lamb Chops - Spectacular. The perfect sear gave them a smoky charred crust, and they had a beautiful warm red center. The simple seasoning brought out the best in the lamb, so it didn't need any fancy spices or anything. I was doubtful about the lamb chops at first, but now I see the light. \n\nGood job, Kokkari.", "author": "Nei N."}

Let's get to it then!\n\nOverall, the food was very good and we really enjoyed our seafood dishes - the grilled octopus appetizer (lightly charred on the outside for texture yet still tender inside) and grilled whole fish entrees (branzini that night). Outside of the seafood, we ranked the juicy lamb chops (Arnisia Paidakia) as our next favorite item, and thought the rest of the food (including the goat stew) was tasty but not memorable.\n\nKudos to the reservation desk (including the manager) - I had to make some last-minute changes to our reservation and they graciously accommodated our extra guests despite the restaurant being fully booked!\n\nIt's not necessarily our server's fault, but there was a painfully long wait (~45 minutes??) between our appetizers and entrees which put a huge damper on our dining experience. Our server was friendly but we found it odd that he would constantly pour more wine into some of our guests' glasses - despite the glasses being full and the guests mentioning that they didn't want any more wine. I know it sounds snobby and nitpicky, but you kinda expect a certain level of service at a place like this, right? :)\n\nSo is dining here worth it?

Located on the edge of the financial district, street parking was not an issue. Our party of six checked in for our 6pm reservations and were promptly seated in the rear Taverna room, which has views of the large open kitchen and windows looking out to Jackson St. It had a mellower vibe than the front room, which has a vibrant bar and a large rotisserie, which had a lamb and some chickens on the spit. \n\nOur friendly server welcomed us and exchanged some pleasantries before describing the specials before taking our drink orders. Our group looked over the menu and we decided to go at it family style so that we could try a more of the dishes. \n\nStarters:\nMarithes Tiganites - crispy smelts with garlic skordalia and lemon.  Nice and crispy, but wished the smelts were a little larger.\n\nArnisia Plevrakia - grilled lamb riblets with lemon, garlic and oregano.  Not often you see lamb riblets on a menu, but rack of lamb or lamb chops.  These were grilled perfectly and the lamb was moist and tasty.  \n\nGrilled Sardines - a special of the day. Two sardines to the order, grilled and drizzled with olive oil and seasonings. \n\nPapio Manti - crispy duck ravioli with spiced brown butter and yogurt.  The ravioli were filled with a tasty duck filling that were complemented with the butter and yogurt. \n\nTirokafteri - feta cheese spread with housemade grilled pita. Nice feta spread for the thick slices of grilled pita. Also came with some pickled vegetables.\n\nMains:\nSouvla Tis Emeras - rotisserie of lamb. The dish consisted of several cuts from the lamb.  Though tender, wished it was not as well done so it would be as dry.\n\nPsari Prito -traditional grilled whole branzino with horta and lemon. The fish is deboned before it's brought to the table.  The fish is light and fresh tasting.\n\nMoussaka - traditional baked casserole of spiced lamb, eggplant, potato and yogurt\n\nGoat stew (special of the day) - tender pieces of goat over a bed of orzo.

My wife and I and another couple visited the restaurant on a Sunday night.  The restaurant was packed.  This wasn't surprising given how difficult it was to get a reservation.  The dining room is huge, which surprised me.  Despite the size, it looked very classy.\n\nAfter a wait this long and all the stellar feedback I've heard, I was worried that my experience wouldn't live up to expectation that I've slowly built up.  (Aside:  I watched the movie, Argo, for the first time much later than most of my peers .  I heard from many of them that it was \"It was the best movie they'd ever seen\".  Then, I watched it, and I thought it was just OK.  Btw, Argo, like Kokkari, is a Greek word!).  In any case, Kokkari actually EXCEEDED my expectations.  The meal was fantastic!  It wasn't like the movie, Argo, at all!\n\nFor dinner, our group shared a few starters, including a corn+feta cheese special (Kalambaki), a Greek salad (Horiatiki), and a combination plate of flat bread with tzatziki, eggplant, and feta (Pikilia).  The corn dish surprised me to the upside the most - very flavorful.\n\nFor my main, I had the Lamb Chops (Arnisia Paidakia), a dish that I've heard about for years.  My wife had the Lamb Souvlaki.  It arrived on the biggest skewer I'd ever seen, which was pretty cool!  The waitress promptly slid the food from the skewer to my wife's plate so that we'd wouldn't hurt ourselves trying to deal with the bad-ass skewer for the rest of dinner.  Both lamb dishes were really great.\n\nBeyond the actual food, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the service was outstanding.", "author": "Sebastian N."}

Wife and I came here for a 5 PM Saturday evening reservation.  This is  a very large restaurant with several rooms, but the tables were set with sufficient space and overall the ambiance was cozy and pleasant.  We were seated promptly, and the waitress was very welcoming and solicitous, and clearly wanted to be helpful.  They have a full bar and a good wine list - the martini was exactly as ordered.  There were a number of specials in addition to the menu, and the waitress was very helpful in describing and making suggestions.  Wife opted to have a number of appetizers as dinner (grilled octopus with lemon- wonderful, grilled stuffed calamari- not so great, crispy smelts- delicious, grilled lamb riblets- wonderful, roasted carrots with feta cheese-delicious) and I opted for a special 3-pork appetizer (blood sausage-delicious, pork belly- wonderful, and another pork concoction also delicious), traditional egg-lemon soup (a bit sour, we did not quite like this), and the grilled lamb chops (this was wonderful and flavorful, I was trying to decide between this and the lamb shank- the waitress helpfully mentioned that the latter's major space was cinnamon, which I do not like.)  We shared a baklava (very nice) and Greek coffee (flavorful and muddy as expected) for dessert.  As should be obvious, the service was outstanding.

Everyone talks about its magic, and people have had experiences, but I personally had not yet experienced anything except hearsay.\n\nThat all changed when I was graciously taken to a work lunch here, where I got a sampling of their appetizers, and one of the BEST lunches I've ever had when it ended with the the lamb chops. To share, we had the Baked Feta, Zucchini Cakes, Spanakotiropita, Calimari, Brussel Sprouts, and Lamb Riblets.  Out of everything, I definitely liked the Brussel Sprouts and Zucchini Cakes the best!\n\nLet's get on to what's more important: the lamb chops.  I'm normally not a huge lamb fan; in fact I almost never order it.  When I told my fiance I was headed to Kokkari, the first thing he told me was: If you don't get the lamb chops, you'll a) be wasting your time with whatever else you get, and b) will experience the biggest FOMO of all time.  Pretty compelling argument, don't you think?  I'm so glad I took his advice, the lamb was likely one of the best things I've eaten, and for it to come at a lunch meal, completely blew me away.

We spent  $306.00 for the 4 of us. Not including a pre-meal bar bill of $60.00  Staff was fine, place was unbelievably busy especially based on the meal. They are making a fortune and should be a big mystery to other establishments who serve better meals at half the price.

I really didn't want to be disappointed and am so glad I wasn't.  I made my reservation about 1 month in advance and was lucky to get a good seating on a Saturday evening. \n\nMy boyfriend and I arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were immediately greeted and checked in.  We were led through a dining room with a open fire pit and rotisserie meats cooking. The smell was mouthwatering. Our table was nice and cozy in the larger back dining room with a view into the kitchen. \n\nOur Server came to greet us and let us settle in with wine and dinner menus. We decided on a nice bottle of viognier suggested by our server which really paired well with the zucchini cake and grilled octopus appetizers and drank well through out the meal.\n\nStarters: \n- Zucchini cakes w pickled cucumbers and spoonful of tazeki. The dill and cucumber flavors were so wonderful and the cakes were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Very good, but maybe not a knock your socks off dish. Very straight forward and delivers\n\n- Grilled Octopus- Now this was definitely a highlight. Tender and well marinaded full of lemon, olive oil and butter flavor without being heavy. The slight crunch from the grill and softness of the octopus was a great texture combination. I think this was some of the best I've had. There was no sign of chewiness or toughness!\n\nMains:\n\n- Sea Bass: a whole fish oven roasted with gold potatoes and red onions served with a beautiful lemon butter sauce. The fish comes deboned and filleted. Our server suggested we have this first and served us as if we were having a courses meal. I really appreciated this as up next....\n\n- Goat Stew: a dish I would have never thought to order but the BF was keen as soon as he heard this off menu option was a young goat, not gamey or like mutton so I went along for the adventure. I'm so glad I did. A hot cast iron dish set before us and I could smell the spices immediately. A mixture of cinnamon, feta and cardamom invade your senses in the most pleasant, mouth watering way. Little snow caps of feta sprinkled atop big chunks of goat, on a bed of orzo just calling your name. I served up portions onto our plates so we could get a little bit of everything for the perfect bite. This is DEFINITELY a dish I would order again. I rarely red meat but this was so tender and didn't upset my stomach... I'm writing this review 2 days later so it's quite safe to say.\n\nDessert: I suggested sharing 1 but was quickly shot down so we ordered 2 Greek Coffees and 2 desserts\n\nCoffee: something to note here- DO NOT stir your Greek coffee, you will be sorely disappointed by this rookie mistake. The grounds are so fine and sit at the bottom of your espresso sizes coffee cup. Your server will ask you how sweet you would like your coffee. BC it's such a small portion I suggest only a Demi Tass or none at all. I am also a dunker and am in full support of doing this the the small biscotti that is served with the coffee.\n\nRice Pudding: while I love baklava, I feel like it's a pretty standard Greek dessert so was out to try something different. I'm so glad we did. My BF's choice, this perfect rice pudding dish is served with a honey glazed grilled peach. I saw glimpses of my BF in his happy place. \n\nSemolina Custard- inside filo dough pastry served with frozen creme fraiche that tastes more like a tart Greek yoghurt. I loved this, while sweet, it was not too sweet like many American desserts. \n\nI really enjoyed these both especially since I don't get semolina too often and it's not something I would make but the rice pudding was definitely a star.\n\nService was excellent, our appetizers came out a bit quickly but overall Kokkari has lived up to all the great reviews and I would definitely come back.\n\n\n- 2 appetizers\n- 2 mains\n- 2 desserts\n- Greek coffees \n- 1 bottle of wine\n\nAbout $260 w tax and tip", "author": "Audrey L."}

I can't say enough good things. I have really never sat down at a nice restaurant and had Greek food, but it was great. I tried a ton of things I had never had before: Octopus, Fried little fish (forgot their name), and Goat Stew! Yes, I said goat! The stew was amazing, flavorful with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg, and the lamb we got was really well done and so great!!! I am not a fan of lamb normally (I know- so weird!) but this made me a believer that lamb can be amazing and not super \"gamey\". \n\nOur waiter was cool, calm and collected- made the beautiful, expensive restaurant not seem as intimidating, and he suggested amazing wines! Oh, the wine list here is KILLER! They have some of the best and most expensive wines. There is sure to be something for everyone. \n\nThe restaurant is BEAUTIFUL! It is huge, with an interested bathroom set up where you take an elevator down one level. It was overall a beautiful restaurant, with fabulous unique greek foods, and great wine choices. I would definitely go back!!!", "author": "Ronni S."}

The zucchini cake was absolutely awesome. Perfectly fried with a yummy yogurt dipping sauce. The calamari wasn't my favorite. It wasn't traditional calamari which is fine with me but it was stuffed with feta which was super overpowering. The calamari didn't ruin the night though because dessert stole the show! We had the special which was like a tart berry cake thing and the Greek donuts. We couldn't decide between the two so our waiter just said he'd surprise us...

It had a little kick to it which was a nice surprise and it went well with the bread. As you should expect at a geek restaurant, the olive oil served with the bread was simply perfect. The grilled calamari was great quality and delicious. It was stuffed with feta, fennel, and black olives. We also got gigantes, which was a stew type dish with white beans, tomatoes and feta. This was a different dish in a good way. The aginares souvlaki was a skewer of grilled veggies and Greek yogurt. The veggies were perfectly grilled and paired nicely with the yogurt. The Horiatiki was a classic Greek salad done right with tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, oregano, olives and feta. The lamb skewers were out of this world delicious. \n\nAll of these dishes were perfect for sharing and I would recommend all of them. We were three gals and this was plenty of food. We were excited to finally check this place out so we were happy to try lots of different dishes. \n\nOur waiter, Mario, was awesome. He knew we were visiting from out of town and missed getting a chance to try Kokkari the past few times since it was hard to get a reservation. He brought us one of the best desserts I've ever had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-05-20", "description": "I contemplated some before deciding on my 3-star review based on a few factors.  The overall experience was actually not bad, and food was delicious yes, but I feel that the management could have done MORE to deserve our 4 or 5 star experience.\n\nI brought my bottle of 2012 Duel from Darioush Winery to our dinner, and the wine retails for $60 at the winery.  Our server is a nice and decent guy, greeted us and explained their Daily Specials, Rotisserie of the Day, so on and so forth.  We ordered the wood-oven roasted prawns as appetizer, which was good.  When our entrees were served, however, this was when the accident occurred.  One of the servers spilled half of my Darioush bottle not only on the floor, but also spilled some on my BF's suede leather jacket as well!!  Obviously I was not happy because I purposely brought THIS bottle to dinner to go with the food, and worse, spilled some on my BF's suede leather jacket.  Is there any coat check at Kokkari, BTW?  \n\nThe Managing Partner, Paul Kirby, later came over, apologized for the accident, and showed me the wine list and asked us to pick any bottle we liked as a substitution.  He looked at my bottle and said, \"Oh, so this is Darioush's second label?\"  Please do your homework first!  Of course this is NOT a second label bottle, Caravan is Darioush's second label bottle, but still retails for $50 these days.  After looking at the menu, we have decided on the Nickel & Nickel, Suscol Ranch Merlot, Napa Valley '13 (which retails for $55, I know for a fact; at the restaurant it costs $105).  He said of course and took away the wine menu.\n\nFive minutes or so later, our server came back with a DIFFERENT bottle, Rosati, Cabernet Sauvignon, Mendocino County '09 ($60 at the restaurant), and said the N&N is all sold out, what a convenient excuse!!!  I felt that they pressed the Rosati bottle on us, but I didn't want to push it further or cause a scene and affect other diners.  Apparently, if you asked your guest to pick any bottle from the wine list and the guest happens to know a lot about wine and picks a good bottle, how is it possible that the bottle is so conveniently SOLD OUT?  I could have requested the Shafer, Merlot, Napa Valley '13 (just bought at K&L Wine Merchants for $60; $110 at Kokkari), but since I also have that bottle at home, hence we decided on Nickel & Nickel's Merlot instead.  Also, I was being FAIR; the bottle I requested is comparable to the retail price I paid for mine.  I wouldn't want to trade anything for my Duel had the server not spilled our wine in the first place.  Paul offered for us to take the jacket for dry clean and bring back the receipt, which we are totally going to do so, no doubt.\n\nI guess what I want to say is, if you are all about customer service to deserve the current 4.5 star rating, do not do things \"half ass\" or just do the mediocre to brush off the customers.  I think they probably don't care too much for the service side after all, given their already stellar reviews from 3,500+ other Yelpers.  However, we felt shortchanged and disrespected in the sense that the bottle we specifically requested was not available and they gave us something half the price of what we requested as a substitution?  This is neither acceptable nor excusable.  At the very least, they should have brought us another red blend/Cabernet from Napa Valley, and not from Mendocino.  Our dessert, Baklava, was comp'd, so that part was nice.\n\nOverall, I doubt if we'd go back to Kokkari given the hiccup and complications, and I've really struggled as to whether I should have given them a 3 or 4 star review.  However, came this morning, the \"replacement bottle\" that they pushed on us didn't sit well with me, and hence they deserve only a 3-star review, already generous if you ask me.  Check out my previous reviews on Far Niente and Nickel & Nickel; I've been to both wineries and do know my Napa Valley wine WELL.  Ultimately, I hope Kokkari's management could take this as a learning experience, because some customers, after all, do TALK about the dining experience, especially when it is less than pleasant.  The other three stars are attributed to the delicious entrees, the special date night with my love, the convenience of the location, and some credit to our server for his friendliness.\n\nP.S. Some of my friends read my review and thought my 3-star rating is overly generous; they say I should give 2 stars instead.  I'll leave this to the Yelpers to decide.  :)", "author": "Vicky H."}

It was terrible, but that was the standard.\n\nGreek food in America currently is blue and white checkered vinyl tablecloths with chunky Greek salads, fried calamari, leathery pita breads, and grainy dips. It is terrible and remains the standard.\n\nThis is the first Greek restaurant that I've tried that is trying to set an improved standard. Considering that Italy and Greece are neighboring countries, it's strange how some Italian restaurants developed into elevated epicurean cuisine while Greek food remained as everyday family restaurants.\n\nKokkari Estiarorio successfully achieved a higher standard with Greek food. This was instantly evident with the pita and dip. The insanely good pita bread was flavored like a foccacia, but airier. The taramosalata dip had a salty hit of cod roe instead of the typical gritty and dull flavored dip. The combination of cod fish and cream created a California sushi roll flavor. Something as common as pita and dip was the best dish of the night.\n\nWe continued to order small appetizers instead of large entr\u00e9es to try as many dishes as possible. The domalthes had tender grape leaves filled with creamy rice instead of the dried bits of rice that fall out of stringy leaves. The saghanaki had a crust that reminded me of crispy fish skin instead being like the usual fried mozzarella stick. The stuffed calamari didn't grab my attention and I'm not sure why. It was tasty, but nothing special stood out. The baked feta had a unique meaty texture and an acidic garnish to balance the bold cheese. It seemed very simple, but the understated elegance of this dish shouldn't go unnoticed.\n\nThe only entr\u00e9e we tried was the makaronia ravioli which was nicely executed, but too pesto-like to be exciting.\n\nThe galatoboureko dessert sounded better than it was because the \"semolina custard in filo\" didn't have rich custard and super flakey filo.", "author": "Brian U."}

We did, however, order the grilled octopus and baked duck ravioli. \n\nDo not get either. The baked duck ravioli - 5 measly pieces at a whopping $17 - NOT worth it. It came out room temperature and tasted like something I could have bought at Trader Joe's to reheat in my microwave. As for the grilled octopus, it was interesting, but I was not a big fan of the taste. \n\nWhere Kokkari shines is their entrees. We ordered the lamb chops and their dry aged rib eye. \n\nI'm not normally a fan of lamb, but theirs is cooked very well. It is so tender that the bone just falls off. However, this dish does still have a slight gamey taste. \n\nThe dry aged rib eye was perfection. I requested medium rare and they cooked it just the way I like my steak - done on the outside, and melt in your mouth slightly-rare on the inside. I only finished half of my steak as it is rather large, and it was still tasty the next day after reheating in my oven. \n\nThe service was lackluster. I expected better quality in service since the restaurant is so pricey, but I felt the servers simply slammed down the dishes and hastily slipped away, like at an Applebee's or something. Oh well. No biggie. \n\nI'm glad I had my gift certificate, because I don't think all of the food warrants such a high price. I would consider coming back only for the steak, or maybe to try their popular grilled fish dishes (which I have heard good things about).", "author": "Mina K."}

The octopus appetizer was super small. Literally just a few pieces, I get its an appetizer but still for $17 I'd expect a little more of the serving.\n2. They have a good selection of veggie appetizers but only one veggie entree. Would be great to see at least one more veggie entree option. \n3.

Convinced my bf to let me take him for his bday dinner, yup im awesome. We made reservations 2 weeks before and I was more excited for his bday dinner than he was. We got all dressed up and headed over for our 8:30 reservation. We were seated right away, I wish we would have got a better table bc we were stuck in a corner right by the door, but oh well! As you know this place is unbelievably busy. I didn't realize how big the space was until we got there!\n\nWe started with off with vino of course and accompanied it with the following:\n\nZucchini Cakes- A few friend recommended these so we were very excited. These aren't your average plain ol' zucchini cakes, Kokkari serves 2 crispy on the outside and soft and rich on the inside, almost creamy pieces of goodness. Paired with a mint yogurt sauce and pickled cucumbers, it was the perfect starter to our meal.\n\nGigantes - another recommendation from a friend. This dish was very surprising, different but still yummy. Big white beans served in tomato sauce topped with feta. Its tangy yet creamy, very very filling! We used the bread they served to eat with the sauce. I liked it but will def want to try other starters next time.\n\nWhole grilled fish- So I am not a huge fish eater, and whole fish kind of freaks me out. But since they de-bone the fish for you and I was already pretty stuffed we decided to split this dish. We chose the Mediterranean sea bass. OMG IT WAS DELICIOUS. Yes sea bass is very soft and moist but the seasoning and the way the fish was grilled was just perfect to me. It was served with a side a sauteed spinach which was great bc it wasn't too heavy. Our server had cut and served the fish perfectly .  You have to squeeze the lemon on top and just enjoy the deliciousness. \n\nKataifi Ekmek- I didn't think I could have any dessert but bc the bday boy insisted we tried one of the dessert specials. It reminded me a less heavier and more yummier version of cheese cake. The pistachios on top were perfect! \nOverall, we had a great evening. \n\nI had very high expectations and was not disappointed. I cant wait to  come back!", "author": "Hetal P."}

Very flavorful, and the meat was moist and tender. Of the two, the sea bass was better, but I loved the sea bream. Good enough that I can probably eat this every day (if only my wallet allowed that). Even looked up the recipe online to see if I can somehow replicate it... wishful thinking mostly.\n\nWe also got the zucchini cakes to share and while it was good, I didn't think it was $12 good for 2 small pieces.

Our friendly waiter came by and offered us menu assistance and lots of good advice. Our table of 6 ordered zucchini cake appetizers, stuffed calamari, and Greek salads to start. The zucchini cakes were warm and tasty - beautifully complemented by the tzatziki, which was thick and no doubt made-in-house. The calamari was grilled, and stuffed with feta, fennel, orange and black olives. Never had I tasted calamari like this before - tender & lemony - and it was an immediate hit for the entire table. (Don't forget their bread to mop up both the tzatziki and calamari sauce!). Lastly, the Greek salad was fresh, with tons of feta chunks to share. So far I think it is fair to say that we were off to a good start.\nAs for the mains: I had been told that their lamb chops were the best in the city. And what I received did not disappoint me. Possibly the best lamb I've tasted in my life (and my mom makes a mean chop), the meat was cooked perfectly, and the spices on the chops worked together to create the most exquisite mouthful possible. Accompanied with 'Kokkari potatoes' the salty, dense potato was a great side. I shared the lamb chops with the special of the day - a type of lamb stew that came with porcini, orzo, and veggies. Although quite tasty, and the supposed favorite of many waiters, the stew seemed to pale in comparison to the chops. Although it did make a great leftover dish.* (to be reheated the next morn with eggs) \nA close second to the chops was a whole fish - line caught that very day just a few miles away from the restaurant itself. The whole fish was served grilled, simply with lemon, sea salt, and olive oil. Although still second to the chops in my opinion, the fish was excellent quality and well worth a sample.", "author": "Nicole W."}

This was the only part for which I cut one star, otherwise everything was more than amazing. These were a little low on flavor and watery. When everything else is close to perfection but you have one watery dish, it stands out like a sore thumb. \n\nSpnakakotiropita ($9.75): Traditional and delicate filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill.

Be sure to combine the three elements: the filo, the poached peach and ice cream for maximum effect!\n\nMilo Furnisto ($9): A baked apple with stuffing of walnuts and raisins, side of a scoop of ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-22", "description": "If there's a single piece of advice I'd give to anyone regarding Kokkari it's: make a *expletive* reservation. \n\nDon't be the little-bit-tipsy people who decide at 7pm on a Friday night to take a pricey Uber across town to one of SF's more renowned restaurants and think that bursting through their doors full of hopes and dreams and ignorance is a \"good plan\". Don't show up in the rain, along with everyone else in the vicinity, and decide that you're going to \"wait it out\" because \"someone will probably bail on their reservation\". Just....don't. I can tell you from personal experience (which may or may not be the exact experience described above) that THAT is a HORRIBLE IDEA.\n\nNow that you're prepared to make a reservation, I can tell you WHY making a reservation is a good idea. Such a delicious idea. Such a \"best *expletive* Mediterranean food I've ever had in my life it's just plain goddamn amazing\" idea. \n\nNow, even though you may think that I was unable to dine here, given the diatribe above -- I did. Somehow, by the grace of some benevolent higher power, we snagged a couple of barstools while the throngs of other hungry and waiting patrons weren't looking. During our waiting time, however, Manager Dimitrios treated us with expert hospitality. He took our drink order, ensured that a fabulous wine was in our hands, and assured us that he'd do everything he could to provide us a table that night. And if we hadn't been able to sneak into a couple of barstools, I truly believe he would've found us one. Luckily, we didn't need to abuse his hospitality and were able to proceed with the culinary mind-blowing.\n\nThe bartender was a treat. Genuinely kind and interested in taking care of us even though his bar was absolute mayhem. I wish I remembered his name, I am not proud of my memory. He deserves serious accolades. On his recommendation, we ordered the grilled calamari which was succulent and fresh, lightly seasoned, neither chewy nor tough. Divine. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the white fish, again on the bartender's recommendation. Cooked in olive oil with lemon and capers, I think. I cannot be certain. It doesn't matter, really. The finished product rendered me powerless and I ate the whole thing. I'm not even the littlest bit ashamed of that fact. My partner in dining crime ordered lamb. I wish I could tell you which dish. I don't even know. The fish had me so enraptured that I simply couldn't focus on anything else. He was equally enraptured though, so, that tells you something. \n\nAll in all, I have to say, there is something to be said for cuisine that focuses on highlighting and amplifying simple, natural flavors. The freshness of the food here is the real gem, the true piece de resistance. And its expert handling by the chef is why the reviews here are so consistent, so reliable. Clearly, Kokkari has hit the nail on the head...in multiple areas of the industry. Cuisine, quality, customer service, atmosphere (as an interior designer, I was thrilled with the decor and ambiance), all were notable. Not that Kokkari needs to be recommended by a little ol' Yelper like myself, but it will be. I won't be able to help myself. And I'm not even the littlest bit ashamed of that fact.", "author": "Virginia M."}

The hostess (older white lady) didn't even bother to keep us posted with the status of our reservation. We just stood there twirling our thumbs while she pretended to be busy with whatever was at the host podium. Checked in twice with her, same cold answer \"there aren't any tables available.\" Didn't even bother to check or assure us it shouldn't take much longer. We finally get seated at 745pm and it was at a table all the way in the back of the restaurant. We asked if we could sit at another table that was empty and she said \"sorry that's for a table for 4 people and there are only 3 of you guys.\" However, the table she seated us on was for 4 people. At this point, my friends and I are feeling snubbed and treated differently. Long wait, no update and giving us a bs reason as to why we couldn't be seated there. We overlooked that and stayed.\n\nOur waiter gave us the menu and we see a party of  3 people getting seated at the same table we had inquired on. We went up to the hostess and asked her why they were seating 3 ppl in that table that was meant to be for 4 people. She proceeded to tell us that we had to call in advance to reserve that specific table and it was for VIP people only. I could tell she was lying through her teeth. \n\nWe proceeded to walk out and go next door to 5A5, our usual go-to place in SF.

In the end, the food is good but not justified at the offered price points with service leaving more to be desired. \n\nWe came for lunch for two and spent almost $200 including tip. . .without alcohol. We tried the infamous zucchini cakes, the traditional spanakopita, fried smelts, and a bowl of lentil soup. \n\nZucchini cakes - not as cheesy as the pictures. Crispy and decently seasoned. For $12, it was an expensive underwhelming appetizer.\n\nSpanakopita - crispy phyllo layers, salty feta that wasn't acidic, and creamy spinach. Straightforward but straight up wallet busting for two pieces for almost $11.\n\nFried smelt - well battered, crispy, and lightly seasoned. It came with a mashed potato aioli that was terribly garlicky. This was the only appetizer that I didn't mind paying $12, since not all places have smelt or done well like this. \n\nLentil soup - more like a clear broth minestrone with the pasta replaced with lentils. This was something I could have made at home for way less than $10 and be able to pass off appropriately as rustic. . . But this place doesn't seem right to have rustic dishes. \n\nFor our mains, we had the branzino and the lamb chops. I always hesitate ordering fish since it is always so overpriced. I felt this way in this case, since it was $44 and although cooked appropriately, it was covered with a garlicky sauce that ruined it for me. \n\nThe lamb chops were undercooked even though we asked for medium. Only one chop was cooked to medium rare and the other one was almost rare. For a place that does this type of meat, they really should know how to properly cook meat. The potatoes were crispy and lemony. \n\nThe Greek coffee did not have any deep or dark notes. I've had Armenian and Turkish coffees, and this paled in comparison. And it was almost as short as the shortest Italian espresso you can order. . .so it was like $2.50 for each of the two sips I had. \n\nThe semolina custard rolls were tasty but not necessarily ' blow your mind' kind of dessert. The quince was cooked in honey so the fruit taste was masked by the floral honey. And the pistachio ice cream, clearly natural, had a taste that is hard to describe but it was not reminiscent of a pistachio nut. \n\nLastly, the ouzo sorbet. Unique with the refreshing twist of citrus. But the taste became monotone with the anise background and the sorbet really needed biscuits to help break up the monotony. \n\nThe service really lacked finesse  and warmth. My water glass was empty at least twice during our almost 2 hour long lunch. The waiter didn't openly provide recommendations. The waitstaff dropped off dishes without much acknowledgement or ability to navigate fitting new dishes amongst the dinnerware on the small table. They also took our dishes without asking if we wanted the leftovers boxed. \n\nGiven the price point, Kokkari left me wanting and expecting more on the food front and left me disappointed on the service front. \n\nI'm glad we didn't come for dinner service because we'd have just paid more for the same mediocre experience.", "author": "K.

We waited at the bar (the only open seating because the tables are usually all reserved) but were offered the table when someone miraculously cancelled.  We immediately hopped on it.  \n\nWe asked our waiter for his recommendations and loved everything he suggested.  We got the zucchini cakes, gigantes, grilled octopus, and saghanaki to start.  The gigantes were my least favorite but still amazing: large beans prepared in such a way that the taste resembles lasagna.  Delicious!  The zucchini cakes were moist and soft, the zucchini adding a satisfying crunch in the warm, gooey texture that made up the cakes.  The saghanaki was also mouth watering - still sizzling when it arrived to the table, garnished perfectly with lemon.  I would definitely recommend the saghanaki if you are a cheese person.  My favorite, however, was the grilled octopus, which resembled steak more than seafood in taste (due to the grilling).  The texture was amazing - not overly chewy from being over cooked.  The appetizers are all reasonably priced in comparison to the quality.\n\nFor our entree we got the goat casserole (per our waiter's suggestion again, who said it was a staff favorite) - a special not even listed on the menu.  The sauce was sweet and tangy, the meat not gamey in the least.  \n\nSo delicious!  Hopefully we will get lucky again and get seated once more when we brave the Kokkari crowd in the future.

I think my rating might reflect my astronomical expectations given their overall 4.5 yelp rating based on thousands of previous reviews. We were expecting transcendent food, service, and ambiance. But what we experienced was merely very good food, service, and ambiance. Now on to the review.\n\nWe were able to snag a same day reservation here probably because it was Easter and everyone else was at home with their families and dyed eggs. The restaurant itself is quite lovely, cavernous, and a bit more formal than we expected. We were seated in the middle of three 2-seater tables- three empty tables, practically guaranteeing we'd have neighbors on both sides of us. I guess we could've asked to be seated at one of the outside tables, but this was minor for us so we rolled with it. Still, annoying...\n\nOur waiter was a nice guy, and the pace of the service was fine. We started off with the zucchini cakes and the lamb meatballs. Both were wonderful as everyone else have mentioned, with the star being the zucchini cakes. We also sampled a couple of glasses of Greek wine, one red, one white. Also, special. We were happy we had these items.\n\nThen things starting going off the rails. We both ordered whole fish- they had three varieties that night and we ordered two of the three. I preferred mine grilled and de-boned and my friend wanted his roasted with the bones left in tact.\n\nWe both got roasted fish, both de-boned. I actually didn't know mine was wrong until the waiter came to apologize and offered to replace the fish. By then I was already too full to start again with another huge fish but maybe I should have because, though my fish was cooked well, and was very fresh, I didn't think it was special.\n\nI think the culprit was the \"lazy\" beurre blanc sauce that covered the fish. Uninspiring, and just really, well, lazy. Also, I was glad they had the option to remove the bones from the fish, but whoever had done mine wasn't very good at it because there were many (like 20+) little shards of bones throughout my entree. Someone had split through the bones and to be honest this was much, much worse than just leaving the bones in place. I could've removed them myself properly and thus avoided this issue...\n\nFinally, two somewhat underwhelming desserts- the baklava and the galaktoboureko. The galaktoboureko was actually very tasty, but not mind-blowing by any means.\n\nWe found the cost of the dinner to be very reasonable given the quality of the food. I think without the hype I might've been persuaded to give this place 4-stars. But really, I don't think we're actually going to go here again so very difficult to recommend that anyone else go. \n\nThat said, the food here is very good and opinions vary. You probably should try them and judge for yourself.", "author": "Art C."}

I've never really had Greek food and I've heard this place is a reputable one for Greek food. Honestly, I was feeling a bit nervous because I haven't eaten lamb since I was a child and this place is well known for their lamb chops. Long story short, my anxieties are blown away because the food is BOMB. Apparently, yogurt seems to go with every dish and fret not, because it compliments with everything you order! \n\nBf and I ordered the zucchini cakes, lamb chops, and moussaka. Moussaka is a bit on the heavier side but it tastes absolutely delicious and the texture is smooth and velvety. The lamb chops have the right amount of smoky flavor and the meat is soo tender! As for the zucchini cakes, they don't have meat in them, but their texture could have fooled me! We ended the meal with baklava. It kind of tastes like a pecan pie but better,\n\nThe service is impeccable. THey are so knowledgable with their food and always greet us with a smile. Given how busy the night of valentine's day was, they still make effort to fill up our glasses of waters. The entire restaurant was filled with customers, and even then, we did not feel like we were rushed. \n\nInterestingly enough, we were definitely the youngest ones there as the target demographics seem to consist of late 20's+. Even so, waiters still respect us as customers, and I've definitely been to some higher end restaurants where we were subtly judged. \n\nBe sure to make reservations!

He knew about Kokkari Estiatorio but he had never been there yet, so we were both excited to try it out for the first time, after all, lunch is likely gonna be good. Service was refined but a little on the slow side. The appetizers we got were the only things we thought were good, which were several traditional Greek dips served with pita bread. The problems started right after that; my whole fried fish was small and unevenly cooked, but tasted okay. The gyro meat had gristle. Their restrooms are far away, which seemed so weird. I had to walk way back to the rear of the building and then take an elevator down. Maybe this place is better for dinner? It's a beautiful looking place, but felt it could have been better.", "author": "Anna K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-26", "description": "I never thought I would give Kokkari this rating and review. It used to be my all time favorite restaurant in SF. Not sure what happened there last time I was there on 6/23/17 but I walked out there utterly disappointed and angry. The place was packed as usual and the ambiance was very nice (hence a star for that). However when it came down to food and service it was just REALLY BAD.\nZucchini cakes which I must've ordered a dozen times before were nothing like the zucchini cakes I always got there. They were overcooked and salty. Octopus was just okay. But the main disappointment was with the entrees. I ordered the whole grilled fish and my boyfriend ordered lamp chops. Again, I've ordered all of these dishes before and they were always delicious. This time at the time when we expected to get the entrees (which by the way was a long wait this time), the waiter came over and said that \"the fish has been spoken for\". I didn't even get what he meant but apparently he said that someone else had reserved this fish and they didn't have any more. I mean didn't they know that right after he put the order in? I think to come back close to an hour after we ordered to say they didn't have it is just terrible service. He proceeded to offer to get another fish which we declined and instead followed his other advice to add the 4th chop to our lamp chop order. Well... when we finally got the chops, that 4th chop was raw with blood coming out of it and the other 3 chops were 90% fat and only 10% meat. They were terrible and not eatable. \nWhen the waiter came with a bill, there was no apology for the screw up, no offer of a dessert on the house or something, nothing at all. I was sure that they would add that 4th chop free of charge since they screwed up on the fish ordwer but was I wrong - that extra $15.95 charge for that extra chop was on the bill. \nThis was by far the most disappointing experience at Kokkari! We paid $250 for 2 and felt like we threw the money away. Too bad, I would've loved to keep coming back but sorry you guys lost my business. This is not a way to treat your customers given your \"high end\" reputation.", "author": "Marina B."}

It comes down to that.\n\nI came with a few friends, and we had to wait a bit (15-20m) even though we had a reservation. That was okay because the host staff were very polite and accomodating, and the waiting area was pleasant. It gave us a chance to take it all in - including the lush seating, the big but cozy bar, the large fireplace, the bread cutting table... \n\nWhen the host informed us we could either have a smaller table immediately or a larger table in a few more minutes, I decided to take a trip to the bathroom. This adventure A) led me to the conclusion that this would be a 5-star experience and B) made me feel like Belle from Beauty and the Beast (you know, when she's walking around and everyone's singing about her). Each member of the staff I passed greeted me, moved to the side, pointed me in the right direction, smiled and answered my questions before I had even formed the words. The restaurant was larger than I had expected and much more lavish - but in a very comfortable way. I also noticed they also have very nice private rooms for special occasions. \n\nFinally at our table, our server was helpful, knowledgeable, and pleasant. He was just the right mix of attentive and invisble - he and all the other waitstaff (including food runners, bussers, etc) were extremely professional and all appeared like magic at just the right moments. My water glass was never empty, and my dirty silverware was replaced with clean silverware regularly.\n\nAs for the food?  EVERYTHING we ordered was fantastic. The appetizer portions are on the small side, so I'd recommend ordering a few plates to try. The grilled calamari stuffed with feta was light but full of flavor. The lamb meatballs had just the right amount of spice and felt substantial but not heavy. I really loved the artichoke and eggplant skewers with greek yogurt sauce - so much that I would even consider it as a part of my main meal next time! \n\nThe dinner menu is small but still guarantees you'll find a hit. Everything was very freshly prepared - from the whole grilled fish (on the lighter side) to the lamb dishes (more filling). You can order your fish completely whole or de-boned, which I prefer. We also tried the arborio rice pudding, which came in a fairly large portion and was one of the most interesting rice puddings I've had, thanks to a mix of the Greek spices, the apricot, and the drizzle of honey. \n\nWhen all was said and done, I didn't even find the prices to be too crazy. The bill was less than other places around town (like Foreign Cinema) but the overall experience was SO MUCH more. Kokkari - welcome to my personal short list!", "author": "Catie F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-06", "description": "Worth the 60-day wait after making reservations! :) Sis was up at midnight to get our reservations and was only able to get the 5PM (or 9PM) reservations--you may need a dedicated T1 line, a top of the line gaming computer, and lightning fast clicking action to get the coveted 7PM reservation :P\n\nThe 5PM actually worked out well. Because we were early, the appetizers came lightning fast. Our main course took a while as the restaurant started getting filled up. So the timing of each course worked out well.\n\nBathrooms access via elevator in the back dining area, back wall.\n\nWhat our party ordered:\n\nApps-\nSaghanaki - essentially melted cheese in a hot skillet. Best eaten ASAP with bread...yum, melty cheese and bread.\nArnisia Plevrakia - lamb riblets. Tasty, but skip if ordering lamb chops for main course. The lamb chops were much better.\nKolokithokeftethes - zucchini cakes. Yum, good veg break from all the heavy items. Always been a fan of yogurt sauce. Also comes with pickled cucumber slices.\nKalamari - feta stuffed calamari. Sis named this as her \"top\" app, but it was just OK for me. Unique taste combo though.\n\nMain Course-\nMoussaka - lamb casserole. Its ground lamb, so it was on the dry side. Mild, neutral taste, which may be why its so popular in the reviews. Least liked dish of the night, sorry.\nGrilled fish - choose to have it deboned. Very good, cooked perfect.\nArnisia Paidakia - lamb chops. Yum, just yum. Only one way to order it=medium rare. Even if you normally order steaks medium, go medium rare! To reduce the heaviness of the dish I ordered it with braised greens instead of the potatoes. Turned out to be a very good choice, as you already have bread to mop up the lamb drippings :)\n\nDessert-\nRizogalo - rice pudding\nThe special, forgot name - shredded filo with custard, then cr\u00e8me, then pistachio crumbles\nBoth desserts were very good. Haven't eaten many Greek desserts so it was a treat.\n\nGreek coffee - essentially unfiltered espresso. The fine coffee grinds sink to the bottom of the cup. When you get to this sludge layer, you are done. I actually prefer regular espresso because ending the last sip with a grainy texture sucks--your already disappointed it gone, but now you have \"sand\" in your mouth. Toss up here, dessert really needed the coffee (I ordered it with \"little sugar\") to cut the sweet, but did not like the preparation.\n\nTIP ALERT: Order everything, including main course, family style!!! They will give each person dinner plates and put all the dishes in the middle. Unless you are on a business dinner, this is the only way to do it. You get to try so many more items...and sharing is always a good thing :)", "author": "Jen Z."}

We normally order two different entrees, eat half, and then trade. He started in on his pork, and several bites later decided it wasn't anything special and was ready to trade. The problem was that my lamb chop was out of this world good. Did I love him enough to surrender half of the best lamb I've ever had for some mediocre slices of pork? This is a guy I've dated for a few years too. Could I look deep into my heart and muster up enough love to give him half? No. No, I couldn't. I did love him enough to give him a third though. I watched as he put the lamb in his mouth and melted into his chair with how delicious it was.  Then I watched as he was hit with waves of regret over his comparatively poor entree choice. The pork was flavorful around the edges, but lacked any notable flavors towards the middle. I started in on the rest of the lamb as he watched me with forlorn eyes from across the table. As he watched, he told me that he would even happily and shamelessly take the bones when I was done. At that point, I was overcome with pity for him and let him have the rest. I guess I really do love him. If anyone ever asks you what true love tastes like, it tastes like Kokkari's lamb chop. As delicious as the lamb was, it was still not the cause of the intense and repeated food orgasms we had. Those came with dessert.\n\nFor dessert, we decided upon the the baklava ice cream (pagoto baklava), and the galaktoboureko (semolina custard wrapped in filo dough with a side of pistachio ice cream). The waiter had recommended the galaktoboureko saying that it was the best dessert he'd ever had. I normally don't like to hype things up because it generally leads to disappointment, but this is a dessert I am unafraid of declaring as one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. I think it'll live up to the hype. My boyfriend was lucky I gave him half before I tasted it because I don't know if I could've done it afterwards. I might've loved him enough to give him half of the lamb, but I don't know if I could love anything or anyone enough to willingly part with half of this dessert again. Baklava ice cream was also delicious. Order both if you have stomach space for it, but if you can only choose one, the galaktoboureko is hands down the better choice. \n\nReservations are available one month in advance of your desired dining date. While this appears to be a popular place to eat out, getting a reservation here does not require you to be sitting at your computer at an ungodly hour to grab a spot as soon as reservations are released like at a certain other popular dining establishment. It can accommodate way more people than other places I've been to in SF. It's a beautiful restaurant. While our table was close enough to another couple that we could've passed as one party of 4, I enjoyed the decor and the giant cushioned chairs. It felt like I was having dinner in the lobby of a classy hotel. \n\nPrice: Zucchini cakes were $10.75. Octopus was $15.50. Appetizers in general run from $8 to $15.50. Lamb chop was $42. The rotisserie special pork ended up being $32. Entrees range in price between $22 to $49. Ice cream was $8 and the food orgasm inducing galaktoboureko was $9. Final bill before tip was included came out to be $127.51.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

Kokkari could be your best dining experience of the year. The restaurant is massive with two large separate rooms. The decor is elegant and comfortable. The impressive fireplace is roasting chicken next to the guest. The front of the house is friendly and effective. They serve some of the greek classic dishes but they are crafted with care and the best ingredients.\n\nIt is difficult to replicate our meal as we tried only 1 items from the menu and ordered all the specials as they all sounded amazing and indeed tasted fabulous.\n\nAt Kokkari, anything roasted or grilled is going to be phenomenal. The leg of lamb grilled in olive oil and rosemary was divine. Strong meat flavor, tender pieces with the combination of the oil and lamb fat coating your palate at every bite. \nIf there is lamb on the menu order it. \n\nThe goat stew is another great appetizer. The portion is generous ( in LA is would be a large main to share for 2...). The goat is tender and bold. The seasoning is screaming its Mediterranean influence at every bite.\n\nThe appetizers are normal sizes which means if you have your own appetizer, main dish and dessert you will be more than full. The large bean appetizer is packed with flavors and comes piping hot.\n\nThe chef is expediting the tickets and controlling every dish before it leaves the open kitchen. From the second room you can observe the chef tasting plates, cleaning bowls and commenting on every dish. It is rare to see this much dedication.\n\nThe quality of the ingredients, the precision and focus of the cooking make every dish delicious. You will want to buy Kokkari olive oil as it is mesmerizing.\n\nKokkari should be an inspiration to all Los Angeles Chef plagued with the small plate decease and not able to handle high volume high end restaurants.", "author": "Loic C."}

We availed of the $12 valet parking instead of going in circles looking for parking.  I was sort of expecting five star service the moment we stepped in but the hostess was busy assisting the party ahead of us.  It would have been better if she at least acknowledged us by smiling or nodding.  As more people arrived crowding the entrance, additional personnel came to assist in checking people in.  Everything went well from there.\n\nAMBIANCE: It's a good date place....there's a rustic elegance to it, very intimate.\n\nFOOD:\nSpanakotiropita - The best spanakopita I've ever tried.  I loved that the phyllo crust was not too thick nor too greasy; it had the perfect ratio of spinach and feta.\nMarithes Tiganites - These crispy smelts were addicting! \nGarides sto Fourno - The wood oven roasted prawns with tomato and garlic butter was so good that even my tomato-hatin' husband was impressed.  \nPortokalosalata - This is my type of salad because it doesn't have any greens :) I liked the mixed citrus but I wasn't a fan of the rose water.... it felt like I was eating from a bottle of perfume.  My husband said it was like eating flowers.  Nonetheless, we still finished the entire plate.    \nArnisia Paidakia - The lamb chops were perfectly grilled.  The meat was tender; there was no after taste.  \nLavraki - The grilled whole fish was also a winner.  It was prepared simply yet expertly.  \nGalaktoboureko -  This semolina custard in film with blood orange spoon sweet and creme fruit ice cream is a must try! It was the perfect ending to a superb meal.  I will return to Kokkari in a heartbeat for this dessert.   \nGlass of Cabernet - I'm no wine expert, but i did manage to enjoy a sip.\nGreek Coffee metro - My husband didn't care much for his coffee. \nFrappe coffee - I am not a coffee drinker, but I had to try it.  I initially liked it, but I made the mistake of stirring it halfway through... it became too strong for my inexperienced coffee taste buds.  \n\nSERVICE:\nThe service could use some improvement.  The appetizers arrived quickly but our entrees took forever.   We had to ask for our water glass to be refilled a couple of times.  We had a hard time flagging down  our server for the dessert menu.  He should have offered us the dessert menu before he attended to a bigger party so that we could have placed our order by the time he was done with that party.  But i'm already nitpicking.  It was still, overall, good service.  \n\nBOTTOMLINE:  It's a must try!!! This is probably as good as it gets in terms of Greek cuisine in the Bay area.", "author": "Janice T."}

Yes, it's true, make reservations as far in advanced as you can. I did mine about 3 weeks out & didn't get my first choice, but was lucky to get in still. \n\nWe were seated in the restaurant as soon as we arrived. The first thing I couldn't get over was how BIG the restaurant was! It was truly impressive. Once seated, we were immediately greeted by our server, Jillian. She was extremely friendly, knowledgable & had a whole list of specials off menu to list for us! My Dad & I went for the lamb meatballs & baked feta as appetizers with white wine pairings suggested by our waitress. Both were delicious, but I have to say I preferred the baked feta a bit more. It was so salty and creamy at the same time, especially paired with the delicious local sourdough bread basket that was served.\n\nFor dinner, I went for the moussaka, & my dad went for one of the specials, Roasted Spring Lamb on the spit, freshly carved, with a Greek red wine pairing by our waitress again. Both entrees were perfect. My moussaka was creamy, meaty, spicy & hearty - exactly what you look for in a moussaka. My dad's fresh carved lamb was mouth-watering. So tender, so juicy, so delicious. We both gobbled down our meals & wine, agreeing that this was one of the best meals we have ever experienced.\n\nDessert was just as good - seasonal berry bread pudding with fresh creme. So tart, so fresh & a great way to end what was a pretty heavy dinner. By the time the bill came, our Dad & I were also impressed at how GREAT the meal was for the price we got. Only about $160 by the end of it. \n\nAll & all - an AMAZING experience. Thank you, Kokkari for such a memorable birthday dinner for my Dad.

We had the baklava ice cream and the rice pudding for dessert. We both enjoyed the ice cream, even if it was a little too sweet.", "author": "Amanda R."}

I can honestly say that everything I tried was incredible, but the zucchini cakes and meatballs were extra special. \n\nFrom there the rest of the table went the lamb chop or fish route. I don't eat lamb  and a whole fish didn't really appeal to me due to bones. What I really wanted was some delish pita with tzatziki sauce. And so I ordered just that along with a Greek salad. I was in Greek heaven. By far the best pita bread I've had (made in house) and the feta and veggies in the salad were so fresh. And of course you can never go wrong with tzatziki sauce. \n\nFor dessert our fab waiter (more on him later) recommended we share a variety of desserts. We somehow made room for a few orders of baklava, rice pudding and (my fave) flourless chocolate cake. \n\nThe atmosphere is lively yet not too loud. They gave us one big round table, which was perfect for our group of 10. We could actually all interact thanks to the setup. I also spotted a private dining room that would be perfect if you wanted a bit more privacy. Perhaps my next group dinner. \n\nAnd finally on to George, the best waiter I've experienced in a long time. I loved his knowledge and his enthusiasm. I found myself wanting him to pull up a chair and join us for dinner. Kokkari is lucky to have him, as were we on Wednesday evening. \n\nThank you George and Kokkari for the 5 star meal!", "author": "Andrea R."}

Watermelon salad was very flavorful.. watermelon pieces with crumbled feta , basil and drizzle of olive oil. The cheese dish along with a small bite of bread was very good and balanced. We had macaronia for the main course. which is 4 cheese ravioli with summer squash in pesto like sauce.

My property recently got a new GM who is kind enough to set up a Concierge Supervisor dinner for us and her. \n\nUpon arriving I fell in love with the ambience and look of Kokkari. The high ceilings with wood beams along with the fireplaces and floor to ceiling windows that opened creating an indoor/outdoor space almost really set the mood for what would be an amazing night. \n\nThe service was incredible with attention to drinks never going empty and wine being replenished also. We ordered about 6 appetizers and everyone was amazing. The octopus and flash fired peppers and cheese on the small skillet were my favorites. \n\nI ordered the steak medium rare and it was perfection. The seasoning was just right not being too strong or salty and the steak was cooked exactly at a medium-rare that I enjoyed thoroughly. \n\nIf you've been trying to land a reservation at Kokkari and find it's fully committed there's a reason! Do yourself a favor and book the first available reservation and be ready to experience an overall amazing dining experience. At Kokkari it's not just great food, but great everything, definitely an experience!\n\nCheers to Kokkari!", "author": "Alex T."}

Juicy, tender, and very filling. For the appetizer I tried the Kalamari stuffed with cheese, it was tasty, but nothing special to it. On the other hand, the grilled octopus was amazing. Cooked perfectly so that it does not feel like you are chewing a rubber band. I also highly recommend the Moussaka, their traditional casserole which has lamb, eggplants, potato, and yogurt. \n\nThe service was professional, clean, and exactly what you would expect.

Floor to ceiling windows and doors, the moment you walk in you can't help but be in awe. It's as if you have stepped out of San Francisco and into Greece (fancy Greece!)\n\nWe got many dishes like the octopus, sizzling cheese dish, the sea bass, greek salad, and a few desserts. We were a party of 7, and were seated right in the middle of the main room with comfortable sofa-like chairs. I loved how crisp and cool it was due to the windows being open, and that it wasn't too loud, even though the place was PACKED! This restaurant is not only a place to come to tease your taste buds, but it's ultra romantic as well. \n\nOur server was Max.

I love it. I also love you - my wonderful boyfriend who surprised me with the reservation there after I came home from a trip! How lovely is that! It is definitely one of the most popular restaurants in SF when you have 2812 glowing reviews! \n\nWe finally got a reservation a week in advance(how lucky, right?!) at this SF foodies' favorite. When we walked in, we felt warm and welcomed by its decor. although it has a front and back dining room, we could feel the rustic greek vibe everywhere. I love the fire place. I love the romantic small tables with cushiony sofa like chairs. It feels like we were invited i into someone's home in Santorini/Mykonos... Okay I'm just dreaming now. ps. It also has an elevator to take you downstairs into the private dining room and restrooms.\n\nWe ordered:\nKolokithokeftethes: Crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber and mint yogurt sauce. It is so amazing! You know it's good when my bf who is not a big fan of vegetables wanted to keep eating it! Crispy golden brown on the outside and soft in the inside. \n\nOctapodaki tou Yiorgou: Grilled octopus with lemon, oregano and olive oil garnished with watercress. We are big fans of grilled octopus. A lot of places ruin the octopus and make it rubber like. But the Octopus here is tender, and very much flavorful.\n\nArnisia Paidakia: lamb chops grilled with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette and kokkari potatoes. We are LAMB lovers. The lamb melts in our mouth like butter. Having only lemon and salt and pepper as the only seasoning, I love how you can taste the real flavor of the meat. Honestly, all our dishes that night have the same seasoning and we love it! It is so simple yet delicious. The lemon juice definitely brings out the flavor and the citrusy lightens the meaty dish.  \n\nWe also had a Tonight's special(not shown on the menu) which is basically all parts of lambs(including the insides) that are oven cooked, same style seasoning and garnished with arugula. It was simply amazing!\n\nWe were so stuffed with all parts of lamb and the wonderful wine that we couldn't dare to order dessert. The service was amazing also. The waiter we had was very friendly, attentive and polite. You can just tell he was so sincere with his suggestions on order choices, he really cared about our experience there versus at other restaurant sometimes you might run into a waiter who just points at the menu and says \"this one\". I love kokkari from all aspects, the decor, the service, wine list and especially the food.

I kept putting it higher for the typical names people toss out as top SF restaurants.  \n\nWe walked into the place in a bit of a bad mood and when the food started coming, it was beyond good.  All the stress of the day melted away, we got lost in the cuisine and enjoyed the best meal I've had in San Francisco... PERIOD!.\n\nWatermelon Salad - watermelon blocked, topped with baby basil, pine nuts, fantastic feta, and then drizzled with olive oil.  Simply amazing combination of favors yet very light and natural. \n\nSweet Corn - Spiced butter, roasted corn (take on off the cob) and little crumbs of feta.  This one vegetable is so good you could just keep eating it as your main. \n\nLamb Meatballs - Lot's of places talk about how they have wonderful meatballs.  These are made to perfection and 100% lamb vs a mixture, which while perhaps improving the lightness of the meatball, draws away from the flavor.\n\nRavioli - Phenomenal summer squash, tomatoes, and in a pesto like sauce.\n\nMoussaka - Best I've had.  Perfectly made in your own casserole dish vs being served on a plate from a larger dish.", "author": "Anand A."}

Kokkari is obviously a upscale restaurant in terms of the pricing and quality of food. However, they manage to keep the interior really cozy (by splitting the large interior into multiple dining rooms) and rustic with the decor. I love the feel of this place!\n\nWaiter (Jeff!) was extremely knowledgeable and added greatly to the experience.\n\nTo start, this might sound lame, but the breadbasket is awesome. You can see them cut the loaves on this rustic-looking station near the fireplace, so you know it's fresh. They serve it with salt and their own olive oil which is super flavorful!\n\nZucchini cakes were awesome, as expected - and zucchini is definitely the star of the dish. No weird/annoying fillers in the cake, it's all zucchini! The inside is so soft and creamy and there is a satisfying crunch from the outer crust. The yogurt sauce is delicious as well - it is somehow very rich while still feeling light on the tongue. Recommend!\n\nLamb shank was seriously mouthwatering delicious juicy. They aren't kidding when they say \"fall-off-the-bone-tender.\" Literally don't need a knife for this one. The portion of meat is really large... a big hunk of meat on a big bone... it's quite impressive. Not only is the meat super tender but the flavor is on point as well. The juices all soak into the orzo underneath and it makes for an amazing dish. Highly recommend!\n\nGrilled turbot was a special that night and it did not disappoint. When they said \"whole grilled fish\" I was expecting it to still be whole. However they had deboned and filleted the turbot already before serving, which made it easier (if maybe less fun) to eat. The portions that were skin side up on the plate had nice crispy skin, and the flavor on the skin was really delicious. However, the portions that were placed skin side down got a little soggy so I wish they plated it all skin side up. Came with a nice healthy portion of greens as well. \n\nBaklava Ice cream lived up to the hype and more. Super rich and flavorful vanilla ice cream with big chunks of baklava mixed in. How could you go wrong? The phyllo somehow doesn't get soggy in the ice cream either, it really is a delicious treat. \n\nPortions aren't huge (except for the lamb shank), they are sensible sizes, and everything is seriously delicious.

I made the reservation 1 month ago and it was already filled up, so i settled with a 830 reservation for 8. The restaurant is really nice, a little too dark for casual dinners imo. \n\nOur waiter seemed like he had a long day, he kept it professional, but he wasn't inviting either. We all got random things on the menu since we didn't know how to read the menu. but we mostly ordered all protein. The zucchini cakes were delightful as well, with the white sauce was app heaven. I highly recommend that and the rotisserie  lamb special. The slow cooking goodness topped with some fresh lemon was the best. Best lamb I've ever had. Most of the entrees are good portions, most of them are really rich so you will be stuffed, but appetizers are really small almost tapas small. \n\nI rate this place 4/5 for service reasons. The waiter isn't what you expect from a high end restaurant, i dont expect ass kissing but be more friendly/social. He also messed up on our bill giving himself no tip - then confronting us that we paid him no tip. \n\nAll in all the food is as good as it gets.

We showed up a little early for our reservation, so we went to the bar to get some drinks. The hostess comes over to let us know that our table was ready and she proceeded to carry our drinks to the table for us. She was very friendly, didn't act like she was forced to, but I still insisted that I can carry my own drink. The atmosphere was relaxing. We ordered appetizers, entrees and a dessert along with some Greek coffee that is heated over sand. Just a warning if you are not familiar with this type of coffee, it will taste grainy when you are at the bottom of your coffee due to the sand. Also, this coffee is pretty strong. When they say light, it basically is a watered down version of the strong coffee. I absolutely loved the sundae we ordered. It was chocolate & vanilla ice cream with hot fudge, whipped cream and topped with toasted hazelnuts. This was big enough for two people to eat and it was amazingness in a cup! \n\nWhat was a little strange to me was that the restrooms are located downstairs, but I thought it looked really cool downstairs because that is where all the private dining rooms are located. It feels like you are somewhere else when you are down there. It feels really intimate down there, so it would be perfect for a small private event.

Based on that I thought this would be a great place to take my hubby for his birthday. Last year I took him to Gary Danko. The reviews for both places made me think they were similar.\n\nBut they are not. Gary Danko is a couple or more steps above Kokkari, in many respects. Price for example. Kokkari is quite cheap compared to Gary Danko. The mezethes are priced $8-14, very reasonable. The main dishes $22-49. You can get 3 course meal for about $40. At Gary Danko, it's $76. \n\nThe service at Kokkari was very good, but at Gary Danko you are made to feel like a king/queen. Kokkari has a business meeting atmosphere. In fact, a lot of the people in there looked like they run out of their Financial District offices and grabbed tables here. Gary Danko feels luxurious and romantic.\n\nI'll stop comparing them because they are probably not similar. They just both show up at the top of Yelp's best reviewed restaurants!\n\nAnyway, I did like the decor of Kokkari. I loved the fireplace/pit in the middle where they roast chicken and lamb, and other meats. The chairs and tables reminded me of being in a very nice cabin. We had reservations (which are hard to get so plan way in advance). We were seated at the front by the bar. Which was great location until the bar fills up and people start loitering around your table.\n\nOn to the food.\n- Gigantes (giant beans, OK)\n- Saghanaki (pan fried cheese.. amazing!)\n- Kalamari (grilled squid stuffed with feta.. yum)\n- Marithes Tiganites (fried smelts.. little fish with head fried.. we asked to have this taken back. Really did not like it yuck.. maybe we're just not lovers of whole fish with heads)\n- Sikotakia Tiganita (fried chicken livers.. yum)\n- Moussaka (I've had this many times in other places and their version is just not good sorry.. very bland and no taste)\n- Arnisio Souvlaki (skewered lamb.. it's good but you can't really mess up grilled lamb can you)\n- Kokkari Sundae.. Chocolate and vanilla ice cream sundae.. huge and yum\n- 2 specials that night not on menu: duck wrapped in bread, (kind of like pig in a blanket.. this was really bad)  and dessert filo layers stuffed with custard and creme fraiche topped with pistachio.. very good!\n\nWe both had 2 glasses of wine. Total came to about $210 (tip included). For that price, my conclusion is it's not worth going for special occassions. Maybe a business meeting with important clients. Or nice dinner with friends or family where you don't have to go all out. You'll  probably enjoy the food if you select wisely. But as for us, it was just Meh. You can have this caliber (or better) of Greek food for much much cheaper. It doesn't deserve the 4.5 stars.", "author": "Vol T."}

My husband never uses salt at the table, but actually used some on his lamb, we did get a bone which was nice, but the lamb and potatoes did not have flavor or taste of the fire. Very disappointed.\n .", "author": "Susan P."}

Triple check!!!\n\nHere's the scoop on what we had:\n\n-Justin Cabernet (outstanding because I selected it without the need for a \"som\")\n-Saghanaki (delicious but very small portion)\n-Octopus (the best I've ever had in the USA)\n-Tsipura (very good)\n-Napa spring lamb (decent but overpriced)\n-Halibut (average)\n-Sokolatina flourless chocolate cake (very decent)\n\n\nOverall, here's my impression:\n\nThis place is sophisticated, for sure, however, it was a bit stuffy for my taste.  I'm a laid back kind of guy, with a world of experience that I don't need to advertise in order to impress anybody.  I know my way around most menus and wine lists and I usually know them better than many waiters.  Although ours was pretty competent, Todd was overly patronizing , a bit judgmental and much too pretentious while trying hard to run up our bill with additional offerings, but I guess it comes with the territory, right?  If you work in a joint that caters to the power hungry with corporate expense accounts, and all those pretentious new money rubes, it's gotta rub off on you to some degree.  I suppose.\n\nAssuming I don't know a red from a white, or suggesting I consult your \"som\", because you don't see me dressed in my Sunday best, doesn't mean I don't know a Chateau d'Yquem from a Petrus, or a saghanaki from a provoleta, or a paella from a fideua......you get the point. \n\nAt any rate, although the food was good, it was totally overpriced in my book.  I've had better meals in less pricier joints with more character, better service and tastier food.\n\nAt any rate, I'd been wanting to try this place and I did, however, I'll go elsewhere, the next time I crave some OPAAAA!!!!\n\nGood times in Frisco 415.", "author": "Anthony D."}

I visit perhaps 2-3 times each year, and each meal is a wonderful reunion of familiar favorites and new temptations.  Throughout the experience, from seating to leaving, nothing is ever amiss, and everything is always amazing and smoothly handled.  This place is a benchmark for local restaurants to measure their overall organization against.\n\nYou may not know you like Greek cuisine, but Kokkari will prove to you that you do.  There is a mix of 'ethnic' and 'less adventurous' items throughout the menu to satisfy all appetites.  A few of my favorites, besides EVERYTHING, are the Saghanaki (a DELICIOUS pan-seared cheese appetizer), the Gigantes (giant baked beans in a tomato sauce), and anything out of their rotisserie- especially the grilled fish.  On my most recent visit, they featured fresh petrale sole- and it was truly one of the finest sole dishes I have EVER had!\n\nLast but not least, don't miss the boat on the baklava with ice cream, or the baklava ice-cream (ice cream mixed with baklava).  Can't go wrong with either, but my preference is the baklava itself- beautiful rendition of this classic.\n\nKokkari is a spot to be considered for all purposes- formal, less-formal, birthdays, dates, etc.  You can never go wrong.

With over 1,700 glowing reviews, Kokkari doesn't need another one because it's ALWAYS packed. Even at 10 PM on weekends it's bustling every time my friends and I pass by on our way to 5A5. But as an avid Yelper, I can't go without yelping one of San Francisco's most popular restaurants.\n\nOn Saturday, 11.19.11, my friend and I came to Kokkari for dinner at 8:15 PM. I made reservations exactly one month in advance. Unless you want to eat dinner at 5 PM or 9:30 PM, plan accordingly and make reservations early. If you don't see a feasible time on OpenTable, call for reservations.\n\nF O O D \nKokkari serves Hellenic cuisine which focuses on culinary traditions of ancient Greece. All the dishes are made with top-notch ingredients and served simply, unmasked by heavy sauces. We ordered most of the dishes Kokkari is known for:\n\n*KOLOKITHOKEFTETHES: ZUCCHINI CAKES w/ Cucumber and Mint Yogurt Sauce ($8.75) - 4.5 STARS\nA must order, the zucchini cakes were perfectly fried to a nice golden brown with a nice crispy exterior. Inside was soft and tender with a bite to it; not mushy as one would expect from a vegetable with a high water content. The thick yogurt sauce added a creamy and refreshing layer of tang to the cakes.\n\n*ARNISIA PAIDAKIA: GRILLED LAMB CHOPS w/ Lemon-Oregano Vinaigrette and Kokkari Potatoes ($38) - 4 STARS\nSimply grilled and lightly dressed, the trio of lamb chops were showcased in its unadulterated form. It was rich, tender, and robust in meaty flavor (not gamey) with a light citrus burst from the vinaigrette and a subtle smokiness from the char marks. Our only gripe was that the lamb chops were slightly overcooked to a medium rare when rare was requested. The kokkari potatoes were like steak fries, super crisp and fluffy soft on the inside.\n\n*PSARI PSITO: MEDITERRANIAN SEABASS w/ Braised Greens and Lemon ($32) - 3.5 STARS\nJust like the lamb chops, the whole seabass was simply grilled with lemon being the only seasoning. Though tender and sweet, it was slightly overcooked as it wasn't as flakey as we had liked it to be. The fish was deboned but I found bits of small bones in the flesh as I was eating the seabass. \n\n*BAKLAVA w/ Vanilla-Praline Ice Cream ($9) - 4 STARS\nNo Greek meal is complete without this staple Greek dessert. Unlike other baklavas I've had, Kokkari's baklava was chockfull of walnuts; I prefer mine with more crispy layers of phyllo dough. This baklava was more like a walnut pie. The ice cream gave a nice cold temperature contrast to the warm and sticky baklava. \n\nS E R V I C E\nThe entire staff at Kokkari is professional, friendly, and attentive. Though very busy, all dishes were well-timed which shows that both the front and back of the house operate like a fine oiled machine.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R\nLike a rustic Greek inn, Kokkari is a very large restaurant yet maintains a very warm and inviting atmosphere with the huge fireplace, open kitchen, and wooden furnishings. \n\nKokkari is perfect for dates and large parties (private dining rooms are downstairs.)\n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking is difficult. Valet parking is $8. \n\nBy the way, beware of the cocktails at Kokkari. They pack a big punch and will definitely make your dinner more enjoyable.\n\nYA SOU!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I was surprised at how reasonably priced most dishes were. I went for a company lunch and my boss, true to form, ordered just about everything on the menu; it's going to be a sad rediscovery to dine out without this boss once my time with her has ended. \n\nA few favorites of mine and the rest of the party: \n\n- Baked feta, so warm and salty\n- Pita bead, thick and soft and chewy\n- Spanakotiropita, blended cheese and spinach inside philo dough\n- Wood oven roasted prawns\n- Fried Smelts, which I want more of RIGHT NOW, tons of lemon juice and hummus for dipping\n- Lamb riblets, drizzled with olive oil and garnished with oregano and lemon, I was literally gnawing at the bone after the meat was gone, I have no shame\n- Dolmathes, actually my first time trying these, though I eat a fair amount of Greek food, I was very happy with them\n\nI didn't really care for the meatballs, but I come from an Italian family where meatballs are crazy tender and flavorful, so I have very high meatball standards.\n\nFor my entree I had the Grilled Lamb Chops (shocking, I know). They were so delicious and perfectly seasoned. I rarely order lamb but this may be my new favorite food. I took one chop home for later and gave my roommate a bite to try (mainly because I was so stuffed from all the appetizers) and she was over the moon about it and raved the next day too. \n\nWe again got every dessert, and I was thrilled with the ice cream flavors. I shared a fudge sundae and picked at each ice cream, the praline flavor was very good, and we had the Sokolatina for a birthday in our company. I quietly asked the busser for a coffee after I realized I wanted some, and I didn't think he heard me, but guess what, guys? He did, and soon I was sipping on my own cup.\n\nEveryone told me the server really makes the experience, and I could not agree more. If you have the option, choose to sit in Michael's section! He is so sweet and funny and really made me feel at home, this being MY first time, but my party goes annually. The resturant staff was very accomodating and moved our party of 10 to a large round table near the window, outside of Michael's section, but still kept us with him as our server, really nice, simple touches make for the best service.", "author": "Crystal C."}

When we arrived the bar area was very crowded and impossible to get a seat.  Luckily we got to sit at our table right away.  We started with some wine and cocktails all of which were good but a little pricey in my opinion.  We ordered a couple of dishes such as the stuffed octopus, the lamb meatballs, the duck ravioli, cr\u00e8me fresh ice cream with lemon puff pastry, and a pasta dish.  My favorite was the stuffed octopus- I had NO idea this was going to be so delicious but the flavors worked together great!  It was stuffed with feta cheese and had a citrus sauce and some sliced mandarin oranges.  The flavors were GREAT!  I would order this again for sure.  The lamb meatballs were really delicious as well, the lamb was cooked perfectly and seasoned nicely and the sauce was really good.  The duck ravioli was my least favorite dish I enjoyed the sauce and the duck but the deep fried (I think?) the ravioli and it had a crunchy texture.  It was still good but not amazing.  The dessert was delicious as well!  The cr\u00e8me fresh ice cream was the most delicious thing I have had!  \n\nOverall this was a great meal and I really enjoyed all the fun flavors and menu items makes me want to come back quickly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-02", "description": "Having read the reviews before having dinner at Kokkari, it really upsets me to have to give it 3 stars.\n\nThere are two sections of the restaurant (the front and the back).  The front is a lot quieter, a lot more romantic and looks really nice.  The back (where we were seated) was a lot louder, a lot more people, really close the kitchen (which I hate) definitely nothing intimate about sitting at the back, the tables for two are really close together (I may as well be having dinner with the couple next to me). \n\nSo before you continue, this review is based on a couple who don't eat meat, so if you eat meat, you probably should read some of the meat reviews :) \n\nThe vegetarian options are pretty limited.  I was actually quite full, so didn't go for a main (which there was only one... pasta ravioli).  I had the courgette cakes (frankly, I've had better), and I can't even remember what the other dishes were, but they were quite uninspiring.  \n\nThe ravioli in one word - meh.  I prefer my own ravioli. \n\nI have been to a dozen Greek/Turkish restaurants in London which were by far much cheaper than this restaurant, and were a lot better.  This really is only a mediocre restaurant compared to others. \n\nThe biggest disappointment for me was the baklava (OMG there is nothing more I enjoy on this earth).  The baklava was super dry.  I was pretty mad at this point, because my expectations were so high.  I ended up sending it back :( the manager came to talk to me after, but after telling him my thoughts, he had nothing to say, so although he may have meant well, he never said anything. \n\nOverall - just an ok evening - nothing to write home about.

We didn't make any reservations because we thought we don't have to since it was Monday night. What a surprise! Restaurant was packed. \n\nThey could seat us down but told us there is another reservation for that table at 8:00pm. It was 6:30pm. We had 2 appetizers, mushrooms and duck dumplings. Both were really good. \n\nFor dinner I had lamb chops with potatoes and my friend tried butternut squash pasta. The lamb chops had lots of fat on it. I probably wouldn't order it again. The paste was ok. \n\nThey brought a bread with olive oil but when we asked for balsamic they said they don't have it :-( so I had to ask for butter instead. I don't like to dip my bread in oil alone. \n\nI was celebrating my bday so they brought me scoop of ice cream at the end which was a nice touch. \n\nTheir cocktail list is not very good.

Overall, the experience and food were A-OK but I don't quite understand the rave rave reviews here.\n\nPlenty of bread for us, however would have been nice if it were warm. We started with the octopus and zucchini cakes for apps -- both were pretty good. We then shared the lamb chops which were served with 3 potato wedges, and the lamb special (various parts of lamb served with brussell sprouts). Lamb chops were good but not the best I've ever had. Lamb special was just OK -- the lamb was a bit overdone and therefore not too enjoyable. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the baklava with ice cream, which was good but of course too much baklava = too sweet! Would have been better paired with 2 scoops of ice cream and more hazelnuts. \n\nOverall, I would have to say for the price and the difficulty in getting a reservation, the food was just A-OK -- a bit on the expensive side and SF definitely has lots of other places where you can eat just as well for 1/4 of the price. \n\nLikely would not try so hard to get a reservation again.", "author": "Siv L."}

The food hit the spot but to be perfectly honest, I'm not really quite sure what all the hype is about.  We started with a selection of starters.  Zucchini cakes and spanakopita were tasty but nothing special.  We also tried the head cheese which was topped with boiled eggs and pickles.  This was worth trying, if only because it's something out of the ordinary, but reminded me of what you'd get in a French restaurant.  The highlight was the stuffed calamari.  The orange slices really paired well with the grilled smokiness of the squid.\n\nEach couple shared a main.  They were huge!   We had the braised lamb shank with orzo.  The meat was tender, the orzo had a lemon-y tang to it but it wasn't anything really that special.  My cousin and her husband shared the lamb chops.  Again, nothing amazing although they said the potatoes were good.\n\nService was good and attentive although perhaps a bit too long winded and chatty.  By the time she got to the end of her spiel on the specials, you'd pretty much tuned out and forgot what she said.\n\nSo overall, yes, a good restaurant but you won't go away wow'd in any way.  It's solid cooking of simple foods.  I would also say that they need to try and go with more local seafood.  It seems unnecessary to be flying fish in from the Mediterranean.", "author": "Ada C."}

Starting with the ambience, our booth was very comfortable, in the walkway, but we never felt we were in a busy restaurant. Our waiter, Peter was outstanding!!!! He was so helpful with my daughters gluten and dairy restrictions, he took her menu and crossed out all the items that had gluten and dairy. He also made sure that the kitchen put everything that had gluten or dairy on a separate plate, so we all could enjoy the shared dishes. He explained the dishes, and was available at all times. It's as if he was waiting on our table alone. The service was the best I've ever had, ever!! Then there was Dimitri, not sure what his title was, I'm sure the manager, but he gave us special attention as well. The food, was so delicious and well prepared. The octopus dish we had as a starter was so good, the dips were amazing, and the pita bread was unbelievable!! Our main dishes were beyond our expectations, so good!! It was a celebration for my daughter masters graduation from SFSU, they brought a plate decorated congratulating her, with a gluten and dairy free dessert, which was yummy.

I needed to organize a nice dinner for 20 people most of whom were out of town and traveled to San Francisco for a graduation event. The whole process was absolutely flawless - from initial contact with the restaurant and getting to know Danielle who took care of all the planning, close communication and follow up to the last detail such as personalized menus. When we arrived at the restaurant everything was ready and we were treated with utmost attention. The dinner was served family style and we had a chance to pick our menu selections well in advance. The portions were very generous, beautifully decorated and served, service was impeccable. The food is absolutely amazing - the best Greek/Mediterranean food i ever had.

Is this a fabulous restaurant with good food? Yes. We made a reservation for 10pm because we made it last minute. We were seated immediately and the restaurant is deceiving because it is much bigger on the inside than it appears from outside. Lots of space and very nice decor. \n\nWe were seated and immediately greeted and asked that water be brought to us so we could browse the wine menu. The service was great, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the dishes and  explained them with such finesse that it made our dinning experience pleasurable. I ordered a Greek Red Wine while my lady ordered a white. For starters we got the zucchini cakes  and I have to say that even though I hate zucchini, I loved the appetizer. It's lightly breaded and pan fried and it comes with a yogurt sauce that is to die for. Very tasty stuff. We also got the grilled octopus and that is a hit or miss. Some pieces were overly charred and tasted burnt while other pieces were cooked perfectly and went well with the dill and lemon sauce. Overall I was slightly disappointed with it and wished we had gotten something else instead. \n\nFor entrees my girl got a grilled whole branzino which is ridiculous, but she hates lamb. I got the lamb chops which is the obviously good choice with Greek cuisine. The branzino was good but it was not amazing. The lamb chops were very tasty that after I forked and knifed it to the bone, I chewed on the bone to get every last bit of meat like an animal. My primal instincts took over and I didn't care what people thought of me. \n\nFor dessert we got a baklava and another pastry dessert filled with custard. The baklava was your standard baklava you can get at any Greek restaurant so I was not blown away. The other pastry dessert was very nice and both came with ice cream. \n\nOverall the meal was excellent but it was the service that made it all worth while. You feel pampered from start to finish which is nice when you are celebrating getting into graduate school. The food was good but maybe try and get something different than the octopus, baklava or branzino. The other dishes I highly recommend.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

They have actual baklava pieces mashed into the ice cream and it is FANTASTIC. \n\nThe reason why i'm giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the dessert donuts.

I guess there was a reservation that had been canceled or there was a no show, so he offered my sister an I the table. We ordered the smelts, grilled octopus, grilled lamb, spanakopita and the dolma. Everything was delicious!!! The octopus was grilled to perfection and was not chewy at all. The best part of our dining experience was our wonderful waiter by the name of Shane. He was very friendly and gave us some advice and what places to visit while we were in town. We will definitely be dining here again when we go back in July!", "author": "Marl B."}

Kokkari wins in all three areas hands down!\n\nOur appetizers consisted of grilled artichoke and eggplant skewer served with Greek yogurt and grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel and black olives. Both have balance in every profile: taste, flavor, texture.   \n\nThe elusive goat stew was the special of the night so even though the lamb chops were calling my name, I had to quell that craving. They take goat from a local farm in Napa Valley, season it with cinnamon, nutmeg and oregano. Serve this atop creamy orzo and sprinkled with feta cheese then finish this off in the oven. Served in a cast iron dish, this is near perfection. Then you take the first bite and then another one, before you realize, it IS perfection.\n\nMy brother's pan roasted halibut was meaty and filling. Simply served with roated vegetables, olive oil and squeeze of lemon. He's a carnivore by nature and yet, he didn't miss eating steak.\n\nKokkari's baklava with praline ice cream provided a sweet ending to our meal. I've had other desserts here and nothing else is tops except for this one. Get it!\n\nI feel thankful to dine at such a special place and feel even more blessed to have a wonderful brother to share it with. Again, all I can say is: OPA!", "author": "Janice C."}

It's a beautiful restaurant that is much bigger than it appears when you first walk in. There's a huge kitchen that you can look at as you walk around and it feels exactly like a trattoria in Europe. \n\nThat being said, I was slightly surprised that they bring white bread, not pita, to the table. I guess DC might focus more on the pita aspect, although I do remember there being white bread in Greece... I think. \n\nAnyways, we ordered a variety of mezes- 4 and then a trio of dips, which was just the right amount of food for us. \n\nFirst, we had the special of the night- porcini mushrooms and feta cheese. These were absolutely delicious. Very rich- almost tasted like a piece of meat or protein. \n\nAsparagus- this was really, really good. Asparagus was perfectly cooked and the dill/ feta crumble on top was soo good. I'll have to try this at home. \n\nSaganaki- this was not our favorite preparation of the dish, and paled in comparison to the other veggie dishes. \n\nLamb ribs- they fell of the bone, although be aware that the riblets are very, very small- not like beef or pork ribs. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, and I still thought they were good. \n\nTrio of dips- we went with the waiter's recommendation and got the caviar, the favasalata and the pepper dip. First, the favasalata is not hummus, which is how they describe it. It's a blended dip made with fava beans. That does not mean it is bad, but it is not hummus. The pepper and feta dip was also very, very good. I enjoyed eating it. I was not a fan of the caviar dip, which the waiter preferred, and we left some on the plate. \n\nBut the best part of the dip was the bread! The Pita is incredible! about 100x better than their bread. You must get the dips if only to try the pita, or just get a side of the pita- they'll let you get an order for ~$3 if I remember the check completely. \n\nOverall, a nice dinner in San Francisco. I wasn't blown away, but it was nice.", "author": "Erin F."}

Lucky us.\n\nFirst off the ambience is very classy without coming across as elitist or stuffy.  Every single one of the staff is the very definition of professional -- most so our waiter.\n\n[aside:  why is it that so many restaurants today, regardless of what city they are in, land up (or perhaps plan to be?) in one of two undesirable categories:  those that seem to go out of their way to ooze pretention to the point of condescension, having no comprehension of the concepts guest, hospitality, or even basic respect -- though the food is often, if not always good.  And then those who hire and tolerate wholly incompetent staff who like to remind you that they are something better than a service employee and can't be bothered to try better -- while still expecting a generous tip.  But I digress].\n\nKokkari is proudly neither.  Truly a gem.  The waiter took his time explaining the menu, the daily specials, and took an extra pleasure in helping each of us choose just the right items (even if we couldn't pronounce them).  The clincher for me, as I had expressed a passion for lamb and this being only the third day of spring, was when I was tentatively offered the dinner-only Kokinisto me Manestra, a braised lamb shank with meat that quite literally fell off the bone.  He had to confirm with the chef, who gratefully agreed, and I ended up with the best piece of lamb I've ever eaten in my life.  And likely will never experience again short of returning to Kokkari.\n\nThe Spanakotiropita and Zucchini Cake appetizers almost defy definition.  What is the next up category from OMG!?  And the crusted fresh bread was almost a meal in itself.  The wine list takes comprehensive to a new level as well with enough to challenge your favorite self-ascribed sommelier.\n\nThe prices, while not every day dining for most of us, are very reasonable considering what you get in return.

I asked him to give us a minute... but this set the tone for the whole meal. I felt rushed, pushed along and our waiter, while being very friendly, was not receptive to our requests to chill. I looked at the time after we finished our main course - we had been there barely one hour. Drinks, appetizers and main course grand prix in less than an hour. A fancy high-end $100+ meal should not be treated like fast-food. It was not a busy night, there were empty tables so it's not like people were waiting for our table.\n\nMy other gripe is that everything the waiter pushed for, and he was quite pushy, was always the most expensive option. My friend had their special, a lamb dish, which the waiter pushed really hard on, and which was essentially a lamb stew for $49. Not ok.\n\nThe food itself was good, but i do not plan on going back.

Multiple people have recommended it or mentioned it in our time here, and the \"yelpy insight\" has long-said that \"vegetarians go nuts for this spot\". We definitely walked in with high expectations. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty full at 6:00ish on a Friday night. The large fireplace had rotisserie chickens in the top half, and threw off a cozy light in the interior. We were promptly seated in high backed cushioned armchairs and the service throughout the night was impeccable. Attentive servers cleared dishes almost immediately, water was refilled reliably, and we especially loved the cloth-wrapped lemon halves that were served with our dishes (to prevent the seeds from shooting into the food when squeezing-- brilliant!). \n\nWe ordered:\nFeta sto Fourno - Greek feta baked with tomato, capers & Metaxa brandy\nKolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing \nMelitzanosalata (eggplant dip) with house grilled pita\nHorta - braised seasonal greens with lemon & olive oil \nTempura Fava Beans (special that day)\nMakaronia - three ravioli pieces stuffed with cheese in lighter, brothy sauce with mushrooms  \n\nThe baked feta was delicious. We especially enjoyed it spread on some of the bread. The zucchini cakes were equally wonderful--  these were less like zucchini latkes and more like zucchini veggie burgers, like they had mixed in breadcrumbs into the mix to add more heft. We also loved the tempura fava beans (and tempura lemon slice!). The eggplant dip was disappointing only because we were hoping for a more smoky flavor from the eggplant like a baba ghanoush. The grilled pita was wonderful, and if we were to come back we'd try another dip-- likely the Tirokafteri.  The braised greens dish was large disappointment as well. We liked the ravioli, but we weren't blown away by it, mostly because the flavors we had all had before in other dishes. For dessert we had their berry bread pudding (berries, pan de mie, and whipped cream on top), which was good\n\nOverall, were there vegetarian options? Yes, many small plates, and we loved three of the five small plates we ordered. But the entree was not particularly special and we were left with the feeling that the flavors at least in the vegetarian dishes weren't particularly varied. We liked this place, but we didn't think what we had was outstanding.", "author": "T K."}

Helping out a friend who is doing a \"Closing Dinner\" on Monday I called up to see ( on a long shot given the short notice ) what was available for public or private dining for a group of 10.   The reaction I got which extended to a conversation and an almost scolding on behalf of the ( I presume but not necessarily so) hostess was that \" we are booked our people ensure we are always fully booked up. We are so good it's impossible we are not booked up. You must not be from here ( where are you from?

Absolutely flabbergasted by the lack of class and customer centric service not to mention arrogance.  No matter how good the food Kokkari is now off my list.

The lady ordered me a tasty old-fashioned and we hung around the bar. I noticed people getting seated promptly and the hostess noticed me noticing.

When the staff lets you know that you're sincerely being taking care of, it makes a big difference.\n\nAs we were being seated, I noticed that the place was huge and they had an army of servers, expediters, chefs, and other staff members. It was run like a well-oiled machine as far as I can tell. \n\nAfter being seated we ordered the grilled octopus and some sauteed prawns in a tomato sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-08", "description": "This is one of my favorite restaurants EVER! We've been coming here for years, and in hundreds of meals here, we've NEVER had a bad one. NEVER. The kitchen cannot cook a bad dish, not with a gun held to the chef's head, could they cook badly. The kitchen is a well-oiled, finely tuned, calibrated machine--the cooks do balletic dances at the stove, one dish after the other going up in flames, the grill a constant buzz, the Greek coffee sand roaster. Visit after visit, every single dish is consistent. Our favorites: lamb chops and ribeye--grilled perfection, not smothered in unnecessary heavy sauces. It's pure and simple, and anything but basic. Despite my best efforts, I cannot duplicate this at home. All these grilled meats come with \"Kokkari potatoes,\" which are heavenly tangy lemony potato wedges; they sound like nothing special, but my husband is so crazy about them, I give him mine as well :-) Their goat stew with orzo and feta is unique and a must. I should write poems about their feta: fresh and mild, they crumble it over everything, as well they should--the best I've had anywhere, including Greece. The Moussaka is legendary: all ground lamb (no beef and no cost cutting measures) mildly spiced, with layers of potato, eggplant, creamy decadent bechamel. Their Avgolemono soup is all tangy lemon chicken soup goodness, though their vegetarian lentil soup gives it a run for the money. We also adore the baked feta with capers, tomato bits, and brandy, the alcohol burns off and the heat adds a layer of complexity and makes it the perfect spreadable consistency The Greek salad is a dance party in my mouth, just a few ingredients come to life. OMG--the smelts? Little fish battered in garbanzo flour with a dipping side of garlicky skordalia, the healthier option to french fries! Their grilled octopus has spoiled us--they grill it perfectly, charred, drizzled with sea salt and olive oil, arugula. I'm in love with their stuffed calamari--injected with feta, charred on the outside and served with warm orange segments--magical and alchemical artistry. Brussel sprouts, we order them \"extra crispy,\" which they roast with browned exterior, and lemon zest bits. If asparagus and fresh peas are seasonal, those are the bomb as well. We almost always get the skewers of artichoke and eggplant. Dish after dish is a marvel, deeply satisfying, starting with pristine fresh ingredients, preserving their natural state, cooked in iron skillets, on open flames on the grill . . . marinated in Greek spices and herbs. Their olive oil is specifically made for the restaurant--jeez, who does that? They have their own olive trees? WTF, right? I break my gluten-free diet--I can't help myself: the waiter brings their incredible crusty bread, sets it on the table with one hand, and with the other hand in one seamless motion, with flourish from the other hand, pours the olive oil into a white plate. It begs me to eat it. Resisting is futile, I don't even bother to fight my bread urge. I order the same dessert every time: homemade Greek yogurt with dates, walnuts, and honey. Trust me, this is not the stuff you buy at the store. It's the best yogurt you've ever put in your mouth, thick and soft, almost like ice-cream though with a tangy finish, drizzled with thick sweet honey and candied walnuts, sliced dates. I'm such a convert, I sweet talked the table next to us into ordering it and said to them, \"If you don't like it, I'll give you your money back.\" Of course, they LOVED it! My husband gets the same thing each time: Galaktoboureko--custard in filo/baklava ice-cream--he swoons over it. I love the ambience and decor--dark and cozy, comfortable, massive centerpiece of fresh flowers in a vase for the Greek ages. The rear of the restaurant is warm, cozy, watching the kitchen action is pure entertainment. The precious rugs on the floor, the tapestry wall hangings . . . serve as sound muffling to improve acoustics, despite always being busy and full, the sound is tolerable. Their bathrooms require an elevator ride downstairs, but oh my: rustic elegance and luxury. No stalls, but mini rooms, completely enclosed with wood slats. Fresh flowers and oozing privacy. The service is perfection. Kokkari could offer courses in restaurateur customer relations. Waiters not assigned to our table, pass by just to say \"hello,\" the manager passes by to inquire about our food, etc. Their service reflects commitment to excellence: our steak was once underdone; instead of firing it a bit more, which is what most restaurants do, they put on an entire new steak! What?? Seriously? Who does that? I actually felt guilty :-) Once, while we were there during spring, my husband started sneezing with allergies--and the maitre'd came by to offer going to Safeway across the street to go buy Actifed for him! We come here and feel taken care of, their spirit generous and giving, warm and welcoming. We leave feeling not only well-fed, but embraced, pampered, a bit loved.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

I wanted a gimlet with fresh lime juice, so first asked the bartender if they had fresh lime juice. He responds with, why? What do you want? It was rude and really put me off for the rest of our visit.\n\nAt another visit, I went with a group of seven. The hostess was rude when we asked how much longer for our table to be set.

I always make sure to come here on an empty stomach so I could try more entrees and apps than my stomach could normally handle, which is already pretty high to begin with. \n\nI love absolutely everything about Kokkari - the attentiveness of the waiters, the upscale  intimate rustic ambiance, and of course the overwhelmingly delicious food. It makes for an intimate date night, a fun dinner to catch up with close friends, a no-fail restaurant to take the parents to and of course, a nice business dinner to close that deal.\n\nAlthough you cannot go wrong with anything here, I recommend the following extraordinary dishes: \n\n1. Zucchini cakes appetizer: I love the texture - it's crispy on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. I'm not even a huge fan of zucchinis but I absolutely love this dish! \n2. Grilled lamb meatballs appetizer: Mmm. It's such a hard toss up on whether I love the sauce more or the actual meatballs more. The sauce is so tomato-y and flavorful. And when the meatballs are doused in this, they tend to blow people's  minds. \n3. Braised lamb shank entree: Oh dear sweet baby jesus. This stuff is so good and the quantity is HUGE. The lamb meat is literally fall off the bone tender, so juicy and fatty, and is accompanied with an intensely flavorful long rice. This is a MUST ORDER and is one of the primary reasons why I will continue coming back! \n\nThe wine selection is extensive and the waiters recommend great pairings. \n\nSo definitely head to Kokkari for your next rendezvous in the financial district. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

I opted for the rotisserie tonight. Apparently, it changes often. Tonight they offered a pork roast. The slices were full of fat and gristle. How could they not have noticed this poor quality of cut?  The one lean cut was on top of the bad pieces.  The amount of olive oil on the plate was way too much and completely drowned the few oven baked potatoes. The overpowering oregano didn't help. My dinner companion had a very dry chicken dish that he couldn't finish.  How could they have served this chicken without noticing the dry sheen of the skin?  We should have sent it back but chose not to because we didn't know what the reaction would have been considering this was our first time there.  Our \"elbow to elbow\" table diners noticed and commented too that this was a very dry serving of chicken.   Our apps were good including the zucchini cakes and dolmathes.  Dessert wasn't very creative. Ice cream sundaes at a Greek restaurant?  I ordered their dessert special- kataifi ekmek. It resembled a square cut piece of pudding with pistachios on top. It wasn't memorable. Service was stuffy but wonderful. The restaurant is large and every seat was taken the night that we dined there.  However, the food was off tonight-way off. There is too much hype surrounding this restaurant. It seems too, that many people get a weird vibe after checking in with the hostess and then getting shuffled past the front dining room (with plush chairs) and winding up \"in the back of the house\".  You're left with this feeling that somehow you haven't measured up to whatever they are looking for to fill the front room.  I'm sure that's not the case, - but it is kind of bizarre- especially when you pass empty tables there first.", "author": "Thomas D."}

The dessert is the star of the evening. It's very good! I wish I can just come and order dessert!

This is one of my favorite top 10 restaurants I have ever dined. From the fireplace and the rustic wood windows and floors I just loved the setting. Then our waiter was so attentive and friendly. Our service was the best I've had recently and our dining experience was amazing. Oh and the food? Wow- I wish I could try one of everything. I loved every dish we ordered. We started with the zucchini cakes- a huge hit and we were sad when it was over. I have to come back and order them again. We also had the stuffed calamari- I don't like calamari unless its fried and breaded but this was simply surprising. It wasn't the slimy unbreaded version of what I have had before in my lifetime- this was incredibly delicious.  It was also good with my Santorini white wine. I'm not one to try new things especially when it's slimy squid or Octopus but after being so impressed with the stuffed calamari I tried my friends Octopus salad. This was a huge thing for me because I had tried Octopus in Paros, Greece and just couldn't get it down. I never thought I would ever try it again. Another Kokkari surprise- this was delectable so much so that if I come back and I really want too - I may order it. \nNow on to the lamb- my husband had the lamb chops and his only complaint is he wished they gave you more lamb - I did get to try a bite of his and his lamb was better flavor than my lamb soulvaki. My dish was very good but I preferred my husband over mine. I finished every last bite. I loved the tzatziki sauce with the pita. It's a little pricey but it's worth the price. I usually don't spend this much on lunch but since it was the best meal I had in San Francisco and in the top 10 of my lifetime I would say it's a destination restaurant. You can't miss this one when visiting. It's important to make a dinner reservation if you want to enjoy it on your trip. We came for lunch and almost every table was taken- we were lucky to have made our lunch reservation the day before. \nYou really earned your 5 star review - it takes a lot sometimes to impress me but this experience was perfection and I am salivating back in Winter Park, CO for some Greek food.", "author": "Bonnie C."}

Au jus sauce is fragrant and rich. It is perfect for the orzo to soak in. Myzithra cheese slightly melts on top of the hot lamb shank.\n\n\nBaklava 9: Traditional walnut & honey baklava with vanilla-praline ice cream. The ice cream is delicious and reminded me of the Persian ice cream we had at Diva at the Met. Honey baklava was sweet but not so sweet you would cringe. The phyllo pastry is flakey.\n\nTo top it all, service was impeccable and prices wasn't that expensive!", "author": "Nancy W."}

I just loved this place and I can go here any number of times without getting bored. \nEverything here is awesome, be it ambiance, food or people. We went here on Friday evening around 5 without reservation but luckily got seats in bar. This was my first time I went here and never realized that it can be this busy. If you want to go with reservations do it 3-4 days before going.\nWe got served by Fatah, he was very hospitable and amazing. We listened to his advice for ordering food and all the food was amazing.\n\nWe started with Gigantes which was perfectly cooked and perfect in taste. Then we had Saghanaki which is pan fried cheese it was amazing. For main course we had ravioli and it was so so. We have vegetarian constraint so couldn't try much.

The restaurant is huge, but the atmosphere is extremely cozy. And I can't say enough about the food! It's out of this world.\n\nFor appetizer, my boyfriend and I ordered the zucchini cakes with mint and yogurt dressing as well as the grilled calamari stuffed with feta and fennel. The zucchini cakes were crispy on the outside and exactly the same in texture as a crab cake on the inside. It's amazing what they did with the zucchini to get the same consistency, in addition to the flavors that were infused into the mixture. The cake as a whole was light, and the cool yogurt dressing added a nice smooth element. The grilled calamari had a grill flavor like I've never tasted before. The stuffing was uniquely flavored and so delicious. \n\nI ordered the branzino with the wood oven roasted preparation, and it was cooked with scallions and avgolemeno with a side of potatoes. The fish was fileted, so I didn't have to worry about bones and could fully enjoy the tender flakiness of the fish. The sauce was amazingly light and lemony, but still full of herb flavor. I also really loved the slightly crispy skin that added a crunch to the softness of the fish. My boyfriend ordered the lamb chops, which completely changed my perception of lamb. I've never been a fan of the taste, but the way they grilled the chops was perfect. The tenderness of the meat was unbeatable, as well as the seasoning on the outside. It was served with a slightly crispier potato that elevated my childhood memory of jojos from Safeway. \n\nThe meal was already incredibly impressive, but then dessert happened. We went with the semolina custard in filo with creme fraiche ice cream, which was one of the best decisions of the night. Somehow they made they the filo dough light and airy, as opposed to heavy and greasy. The custard filling tasted like nothing I've tasted before, sweet and creamy and eggy to the perfect amount. The hot filling paired just right with the creme fraiche ice cream, which was topped with a slightly sweet apricot syrup. \n\nI could find nothing wrong with this meal, and I will be forever obsessed with the food. Kokkari has definitely made it onto my list of favorite restaurants!", "author": "Ashley T."}

With dinner reservations in hand for about 2 months, we were a table of 4 and had a lovely close-to-3 hour dining experience recently in August.  We were never rushed. We tried a lot of items - from starters to entrees to sides to dessert and we all shared our plates. The wine list was tremendous and we enjoyed a couple of bottles. Our waiter was new (we suspect his 1st or 2nd night) yet he was earnest and we could tell he was trying hard to do a good job. All was wonderful.\n\nWe returned a week ago where we hosted a group of 23 in the Oenos Room, a perfect open-air room for our event. This is a great room because it is close to all the action of the kitchen and restaurant but with a little bit of privacy for a private event. Our two waiters were so accommodating that we could not have been more pleased!\nI highly recommend what was served - Champagne, pinot and chardonnay. Danielle Olsen was helpful in assisting me in selecting our menu. Starters of grilled octopus (oh my - an absolute fav), grilled meatballs, zucchini cakes (a big hit with our group), and Kokkari salad. Sides were roasted potatoes and horta (braised greens). Our entrees were chicken souvlaki and moussaka (a yummy casserole). Dessert was...baklava. \nThe only glitch was the fact that with 23 guests, I had wanted a long table. When I arrived, we were arranged in 3 tables. I would have made place cards had I known. But, as it turned out, people self-selected their seating and the conversation flowed perhaps a little easier with the smaller 3 tables.\nWe cannot thank Kokkari enough for our wonderful meal. Every single one of our guests made a point of saying how much they enjoyed our gathering. The meal, the staff, and the ambiance were just perfect. Thank you so much!\nI am a huge fan!", "author": "Jillian R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-11", "description": "Any restaurant on Yelp with 3100 reviews and 4.5 stars is obviously legendary. Yelpers like to tear down overhyped spots, but Kokkari is so glorious that there is no way someone can eat here and not be blown away (unless they have no taste or don't appreciate good food, that is).\n\nNearly every single one of my friends raved about this restaurant for months when I first moved to SF, and yet I very foolishly put off eating here until a few weeks ago. Even Greeks love Kokkari (my boyfriend who is albeit half-Greek, case in point). \n\nLet me tell you, my friends, that I'm not exaggerating when I say I was on the verge of tears for nearly the entire meal. Each bite was so heavenly that I couldn't speak. I ended up way overeating, of course (omg why do they keep refilling the bread basket and why does the bread -- which is super warm and fresh, by the way -- taste so good with all the other dishes?!), but it was worth it. \n\nI'm told the lamb chops are a MUST, but since I only came here with one other person, we opted for the grilled whole fish instead (which was dressed with dandelion greens, olive oil and lemon and so utterly divine). I'm now convinced this restaurant can do no wrong. \n\nOther highlights:\n- The pan-fried cheese with lemon and oregano. If you're a cheese lover like me, you absolutely MUST order this. You might be wondering how pan-fried cheese could cost $14, but just wait until you experience the texture and level of flavors in this dish. \n- The grilled lamb meatballs with spiced tomato sauce and Greek yogurt. Again just reduced to silence while nibbling at this succulent meat. The Greek yogurt was the perfect cooling element and brought it all together.\n- The grilled octopus with lemon, oregano and olive oil. What I continue to be amazed by at Kokkari is how simple the ingredients are, and yet it can achieve what so many more complex recipes cannot. I'm not the hugest fan of octopus, but here it was tender and again perfectly seasoned.\n- The Greek wine. Definitely order off the Greek menu; the wine from the other regions are like 3x the price. The bf and I shared a bottle for like $50 and while I was unaccustomed to its nuances at first, it improved with every sip. It was the absolute best complement to our food. \n- The service. You know when you get a waiter who's not only honest and gracious, but also just intuitive? Like he can see when you're trying to subtly make eye contact or need more water or gauge what kind of flavors you're in the mood for? That's the type of waiter we had. Simply amazing.\n\nThe only downside? Dining at Kokkari doesn't come cheap. Save it for the special occasions.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

The ambiance was warm and pleasant.  I was disappointed that there was not a cocktail list.  The bartender said \"we don't have a list... just order whatever you'd like\"... which sounded to me like... we don't want to make the effort... or  we'd appreciate it if you'd just hurry up and order wine instead.  Well, that is what we went with in the end... Two of us ordered a glass of wine off the list.  One was great (but $20 a glass), the other (a Bordeaux) smelled like wet, musty socks... I couldn't even put it to my lips.  It sat untouched on the table for the entire time.  The waiter certainly noticed on his multiple trips to our table... but bothered not to ask or say anything... and just charged me anyway.  \n\nThe hors d'Oeuvres (beets, brussel sprouts, lemon chicken soup) were ho hum... the brussel sprouts were overcooked and mushy, which surprised me since they were grilled and sauteed.  If the beets had any pistachios (as mentioned on the menu) I sure didn't see any.  The lemon chicken rice soup tasted like the bottom of the large soup pot had burned (either that or the lemons were charred black before they were added to the soup). There was very little chicken or rice in the bowl of soup.  It was mainly a thick, slighly creamy, burnt lemon broth... very unappetizing and mostly left untouched.\n\nI ordered the famed \"kokkari lamb chops\".  They were certainly impressive in size... but I would have appreciated them a little more trimmed of fat.  They were also on the border of being burned even though they were cooked medium rare. \n\nOur server was efficient, but not particularly warm.\n\nI have a feeling that the management will not be happy to read these things... that their standards are much higher than this.  I am sure there are servers and chefs working here that do a fantastic job (for it is a large restaurant)... we unfortunately didn't experience their efforts.\n\nThis place was recommended to me, but in the end, I was sincerely disappointed.

The Grilled Octopus with olive oil and lemon we ordered for as an appetizer was prepared perfectly. We kept the plate so we could dip our bread into the leftover olive oil.  My date ordered the lamb chops as medium rare, but it ended up coming out as medium, and in some spots medium well. He was kind of disappointed in that, especially since they are just shy of $50. They were huge though, and delicious still. \nFor dessert we ordered spearment tea, and Ouzo sorbet. It had prickly pear, ouzo sorbet (which has a licorice taste), and roasted pineapple. I always like to try new things, so I was pleasantly surprised. It was the perfect light dessert after a heavy meal.\n\nI highly recommend making a reservation here. It fills up quickly at dinner time so my date and I had to eat at the bar since I was here for a last minute work trip. Many people were waiting to sit there and we were able to grab some seats when other people weren't paying attention.

I stumbled upon Kokkari Estiatorio (here on Yelp, of course), and persuaded my colleagues to join me in trying it on a Saturday night.

At first, the hostess told us we'd have quite a wait; but then, they pulled a few strings and got us a table after only 15 minutes.  \n\nThe service and food were equally wonderful.

The hostess was able to accommodate our group and was really sweet and professional about the mistake.  We were seated within three minutes of her fixing the reservation.  Our waiter was even better, witty yet professional, and he even admitted he had OCD as a waiter, which kept our lunch classy but definitely made our dining experience entertaining and funny especially when things weren't set on the table correctly. \n\nAs starters, I tried the grilled calamari and zucchini cakes.  The calamari was perfectly grilled and the zucchini cakes were packed with lots of shredded zucchini and was nicely encrusted.  I settled for the special of the day, Pastitsio, which is like a Greek lasagna... I definitely couldn't pass this up.  I loved that the pastitsio was made with bucatini pasta and that it was packed with spices, specifically oregano and cinnamon.  My friend ordered the lamb medium, and because her lamb came out medium well, our waiter comp'd her meal at the instant she sliced into her lamb and he saw that it was not as pink as it should have been.  While my friend insisted it wasn't necessary, our waiter further insisted that she shouldn't have to pay for something she didn't order / wasn't cooked properly.

Overall, the menus are pretty similar, with Kokkari having a few extra options in each category (appetizers, soups/salads, entrees).\n\nBoth were 5 star experiences. \nWhile Evvia had more memorable, outstanding service, with the waitress actually interacting & making friendly conversation with us, at Kokkari, the waitress, though polite, seemed to be just going through the motions (Instead, she seemed to be more friendly to the tables around us who had ordered numerous bottles of wine...) However, the ambience at Kokkari definitely made up for what the cramped Evvia lacked in that aspect - Kokkari's space is actually deceivingly large, with high ceilings and comfortable, spread-out seating. The dim lighting and tasteful decor create a warm, romantic atmosphere.

Kokkari Estiatorio was a last-minute decision, which showed because we arrived 20 minutes before their lunch service ended. But this means we avoid the lunch rush and got an amazing, spacious window table. \n\nOur server was fantastic and really he made the experience memorable. He was attentive, helpful, witty, professional, and invisible. I have never been to a restaurant where a server had that perfect balance. He knew when to offer his suggestions but also be unobtrusive. And without him we would have never landed the last Thursday lunch special.\n\nI love bechamel sauce. Our love affair first start just shy of a year ago when I tasted the pastitsio at a Sacramento Greek restaurant. When I describe the creamy perfection that is bechamel to the girlfriend, she lashed out in a jealous rage. Enough of that drama, onto the food. \n\nSo we ordered the dolmathes and zucchini cakes to start followed by the pastitsio and grilled lamb chops. Before any dishes came out the bread arrived. Not sure if I was blinded by hunger but that was some bread damn good bread. Dolmathes were okay but the zucchini cakes with that cucumber and mint yogurt dressing was to star, giving the bechamel sauce a little competition.\n\nTwo lamb chops and the pastitsio arrived, sitting beautifully on the plate. Lamb was cooked medium, was easy to cut, and went well with the lemon-oregano vinaigrette. Surprisingly, the pastitsio had more red sauce than bechamel. Still enjoyable but I was longing for the bechamel. Perhaps another time. I will definitely return to Kokkari Estiatorio; I just wish it was more affordable. \n\nWhat I recommend:\n-- call and reserve your daily taverna special\n-- zucchini cakes", "author": "Andrew W."}

I loved that they could easily accommodate a group of 12 (as long as you call a couple weeks in advance, of course). They don't take your credit card number as part of the reservation either, so prepare to receive at least 3-4 phone confirmations minimum.\n\nTheir food is phenomenal, though everything is on the pricier side. I highly recommend the Arnisia Paidakia (grilled lamb chops). I ordered it cooked medium, and the chops were so succulent and tender, I swear I could eat the bone the meat came on! My friends ordered the Moussaka (lamb casserole) and the Psari Psito (grilled whole fish), both of which tasted amazing (but the lamb chops are still #1 in this girl's heart... I mean stomach). The casserole is a bit on the heavier side, while the fish makes for much lighter fare. For dessert, we ordered the traditional baklava and the Pagoto Baklava (chunks of baklava folded into vanilla ice cream). Both were super sweet. I wouldn't recommend the ice cream only because it tasted exactly like pralines and cream, but for $8. I loved that they gave the two birthday gals dessert on the house though! Thank you, Kokkari.\n\nPro-tip: I'm not sure whether this was unique only to my experience, but as soon as the bread comes out, put it on your plate!

I went to Kokkari for a work thing and didn't pay for my meal so didn't pay too much attention to the prices.  Also, I'm a vegetarian so I didn't even bother to look at the choices much and just scoped out the one vegetarian dish on the menu.\n\nIt was very crowded there and we had to literally push our way in, even though we had reservations.\n\nI had their zucchini cakes, watermelon with feta cheese and their squash ravioli w/pine nuts.  It was all delicious.  I have seen lots of reviews about snobby waiters, hostesses, etc.  I did not experience this; our waiter was a very nice man.\n\nWhat blew it for me here was, we were seated at a large table pretty much right by the large open fireplace.  They lit a fire and I thought, \"Oh, how nice...\"  as it was cold out that day.  Well, about 30 min. later they marched in with a large pig, everything but the head and put him on the spit and started roasting him right there in front of me.\n\nUGH!!!!!!!  Now, people eat meat in front of me all the time.  My hubby is not a vegetarian and I'm not one of THOSE vegetarians.  I am not rude to people and I don't inflict my lifestyle on anyone.  But who the hell wants to see a roasting pig right in front of them???????????????  I don't.  Even my hubby (who wasn't there) was grossed out.  The skin sizzled and popped and turned pink...juice dripped into the fire and I frankly wanted to cry then puke.\n\nNot everyone wants to see that shit, seriously.  It was not pleasant and had I not been with work people and been paying for my own meal I would have politely requested to be moved away.  I don't understand cooking an animal like that - that still looks like an animal - right in front of everyone.  It's just gross and mean.

The receipt was from 1999 and was greyed and brittle with age, but the memories from that dinner--and several others I've had there throughout the years--are still vivid. A sign of a great dining experience is how long it stays with you (I mean the memories, not the bad taste when you burp). \n\nWhen I found that receipt I hadn't been back to Kokkari in 10 years or so, and I vowed to visit it again.

There's really nothing to complain about. The service, food, and ambiance are fantastic. Every time. The food follows the philosophy I've heard from so many top chefs; good ingredients, simple preparation, executed flawlessly. You won't find any freeze-dried foamy things on your plate; let the hipster foodies eat that crap. \n\nMy favorites are the fish specials (perfectly grilled with a squeeze of lemon and a side of braised greens), the grilled octopus starter, the baked feta (surprisingly mild and creamy), the zucchini cakes, the Saghanaki (pan fried Kefalotiri cheese; it's amazing) . . .

And yet, the service was impeccable, and we were lucky enough to have a seat near the kitchen, which kept the cold weather outside easily at bay. I was also impressed by the decor -- Efharisto! There was no \"oh look, this place is Greek\" blue-and-white everywhere. There was no silly breaking of plates. This was indeed fine Greek dining -- yes, it totally exists, contrary to most of what you find in America. Our non-Greek waiter was relatively new and learning, so I did have to put my orders in English, but he was apologetic and did ask me to pronounce the menu items in Greek so he could learn, so he gets credit for that.\n\nThe wine list had us in fits because it was so hard to choose from a remarkable selection of domestic and European reds and whites. We actually ended up with an Oregonian Pinot of all things splitting the difference between my partner's Lamb Chop entree and my roasted chicken.\n\nFor starters, we had the Saganaki, which when done properly, is a thing of beauty. No showy flambe here folks, just a well-seasoned piece of exquisite cheese pan fried and nicely garnished with a lemon in a piece of cheesecloth (nice touch -- why have I never thought of catching seeds that way?)\n\nWe also had the Grilled Octopodaki (young octopus), which is a lot harder to find in the U.S. than Kalamarakia, and I personally like the taste and texture better. Again, a winner here.\n\nOur entrees were absolutely perfectly cooked and amazing. My chicken was so much a reminder of all the best food I had in Greece -- the simple stuff -- the not-so-fussy basic application of a few herbs and fresh ingredients. That, to me, is the embodiment of Greek cooking. The lamb was absolutely juicy and flavorful, and the portions were more than enough to accommodate the price tag.\n\nWe finished with a not-too-sweet flourless chocolate cake, and then I snuck in a nightcap of 12-yr old Port, because seriously, why not at that point be a little stumbly on the way home from a marvelous evening. \n\nBravo, Kokkari -- you have now earned second-place to Taverna Cretekou in Alexandria, VA as the best Greek restaurant in the U.S. -- and, first place for the coast I'm currently living on ;)", "author": "Amy P."}

Turns out, I wasn't missing much.\n\nOur food tasted pretty good, but absolutely did not blow me away. Spanakopita and zucchini cakes were very good, but nothing you wouldn't find at a good Greek diner for a fraction of the price. The ravioli was okay, but the delicate squash and brown butter were overpowered by the unnecessary addition of feta.\n\nDessert was the highlight. Flourless chocolate cake - rich, delicious, and somehow they managed to make it quite fluffy instead of the dense flourless cake you're used to. Baklava was just average, but the baklava praline ice cream that comes with it is divine.\n\nEven though we had a reservation, we had to wait nearly 20 minutes to be seated - and apparently so did everyone else, because the hostess was bombarded with complaints. Don't know if they overbooked or let in too many tables without a res, but they need to work that out.\n\nFinally, service was friendly enough but slow and spotty. It took forever to have our lunch order taken and another eternity to give our dessert order. Our waitress would just disappear for long periods of time.\n\nI don't see a reason to go back.

Plan ahead and go to open table when you know you want to have dinner here.\n\nThe whole menu is finger lickin' good. Literally, you may want to after you've tried their Lamb Riblets. I whole heartedly suggest you order several of their starters and maybe share an entree plus a dessert. They're known for their fantastic appetizers and they're all so different! The Zucchini Cakes is another good one. A fresh cucumber and mint yogurt dressing makes it stand out. The zuccs aren't greasy one bit either.

It's located in the Financial District of the city and within walking distance of the Embarcadero Bart station.  \n\nThe interior of this restaurant is very open, rustic, and consists of a couple of large rooms.    We were seated in the back room near the food preparation area and the grills.  The server was very helpful and suggested various dishes which included the fish selections of the day.  He was very knowledgeable about the preparations of all the offerings.\n\nMy husband chose Souvlaki---large chunks of lamb alternating with roasted tomatoes.  The lamb was cooked medium rare, very tender, and had a hint of cumin along with garlic.  I chose sea bream, which was grilled whole with garlic, lemon, oregano,  and had a side of braised greens on the side.  The fish was very flavorful and mild with a medium texture.\n\nFor dessert, I chose an Arborio rice pudding with a poached, caramelized pear on top.  Very light, creamy, and delicious.  My husband had a custard with shredded filo---a slightly gelatinous texture with hints of yogurt also  nice finish to the meal.  The final touch was Greek coffee, which was very similar to Turkish coffee.\n\nI have to say that this is probably the best Greek food I've ever tasted.

Reservations are definitely recommended, since the wait without it is probably an hour, but the ambiance is lovely and the service is impeccable. It may have helped that our server looked like Tom Hiddleston as well. :D\n\nWe ordered the Saghanaki, the lamp chops (Arnisia Paidakia) and the rib-eye (Mosharisia Brizola). \n\nI was eating with someone who had been to Greece before, and apparently the Saghanaki was not legit in the sense that they didn't set on fire on the table (likely something to do with fire codes), but it was incredibly delicious nonetheless. I definitely recommend it for cheese lovers. The lamb chops were so juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. The rib-eye was huge(!) and tasty as well. I think I may have had better rib-eye elsewhere, but on the whole it's still pretty good!\n\nMy only qualm is that we were seated awfully close to another couple that was celebrating their wedding anniversary, and we could hear literally everything that they were saying. It was quite distracting, and I figured they could  listen in to the conversations I have as well. The idea of that generally just makes me uncomfortable, and therefore more hesitant to engage in conversation, which is pretty unfortunate.

I would say that for my overall dining experience, everything was just a bit too citrusy and sour to my liking, but I know that it's a flavor that's very common in this cuisine. But I feel like the sourness just took away from a lot of the natural flavors from the dishes. In addition, there aren't a lot of veggie options/ non-lamb options. I would like to see more variety, or add the daily specials to the regular menu, but just offer them at a lower price during that specific day.\n\n1. Kalamata Pita\nThis pizza like appetizer was packed with flavors, especially from the grilled onions (although not a fan of onions at all). Pita bread had a nice crunch to it that imitated a pizza crust. Would recommend this dish.\n\n2. Fried Smelts\nProbably my favorite part of the meal! This tiny little guys are just fantastic!

It consisted of layers of cheese, eggplant, ground lamb, and potato and the flavors and textures came together very well.  It was quite a bit heavier than the lamb chops thought not overly so - hearty yet not at all food coma-inducing.\n\nBaklava with Praline Ice Cream - Solid dessert.

The rest of the menu is also excellent specially the whole baked fish and not confusing like most other high-end restaurants. It's a long Waite to get a reservation but definitely worth the Waite. The bar is full of high-end libations of your choice go and give this place a try you won't be disappointed. Keep on going guys and don't change anything. Cheers", "author": "SAMAY A."}

We arrived at 11:30AM on a Wednesday for lunch and by the time we left at 1PM it was packed...now I understand why!\n\nWe started with the Melitzanosalata and pita. It was very fresh but the pickled vegetables and fresh cucumber that also came on the plate were even better. The gigantes beans we ordered came out bubbling in their own little cast iron pan. This was my favorite thing we ate and the buttery beans were made even better slathered over pita. The tomato base for the beans was PHENOMENAL. \n\nFor my entree I had the artichoke and eggplant souvlaki. Again, it was served with unexpected sides like Persian cucumbers (I think...), roasted tomatoes and pita. I would never get sick of vegetables if they were prepared as simply and were as fresh as Kokkari serves.\n\nAt this point in our meal I thought, \"If I would ever order baklava, this would be the place to do it,\" since every other part of our meal had been excellent thus far and I also managed to talk my mom into ordering the Greek yogurt with spiced walnuts and dates. Having yogurt as a dessert may seem like a contradiction to some, but when you top it with candied and spiced nuts and drizzle it with thick, sugary honey, it's like heaven on a plate. The baklava was fantastic as I suspected and it was the perfect way to top off an indulgent lunch.\n\nWalking out of the restaurant, I noticed they were spit roasting a whole lamb. If you just set me up in front of that fire with a knife, fork and a glass of red wine, I'd be good for life. Hell, you can even forget the knife and fork and just bring a bottle of the wine and you would be guaranteed a great time in a restaurant as good as Kokkari.", "author": "Hayley H."}

Someone once said that the first impression always sticks and, I must say since stepping foot in this restaurant, I was really impressed. \n\nThe elegant decor and the polished crowd make you feel almost like you walked in a NYC restaurant but the courteous and helpful staff makes everyone feel welcome.   Unfortunately we were not very hungry when we ordered so my friend ordered just a few dishes. We picked some meze and chose the fried zucchini and everything was delicious. \n\nAs main course we chose one of Kokkari's signature dishes: the goat, which was very tasty if you like this type of meat. In general, if not cooked properly goat can result hard and the flavor too intense but not at Kokkari: at this restaurant quality is consistent and cooks work really hard to find the perfect balance.   \n\nSince I cannot end any meal without dessert, I tried both the berries bread pudding and the flour-less chocolate cake and they were both really good: both very moist and tasteful. They both came with a creme on the side that was delicious. Caveat, dessert portions are very big so save room or plan accordingly.

So, we called and told them we'd be a few minutes late and upon our arrival, everyone was worried. Are you really okay? Are you sure you can eat? Can we run to Safeway and get you some Advil? It was adorable and made us want to stick it out even more and my goodness, am I glad we did. \n\nWe started with grilled artichokes and 3 of the dipping items w/pita. It was a TON of food - looking back, we prob should have done only 1 of the dipping items - but it was my first time and all of it was DELICIOUS. I literally had to fight with my wife to get my share of the 'chokes! For dinner I had the white fish of the day and she had the goat stew. The fish was good, but the stew was AMAZING, so if they have it, get it.

The restaurant is pretty expansive as it wraps around the corner of the block with two dining areas:  one at the front near the bar and the other toward the back/kitchen, which is where we sat.  We were seated a table away from the busy kitchen area and it made for a very hectic meal with the waiters continuously moving back and forth.  We especially realized this upon walking through the other dining room to exit and noticed how much more calm and relaxing it was.  If you can, ask to be seated in the room at the entrance. \n\nLemon-egg soup:  smooth and minimally tart but too potent of an egg taste.  It does grow on you after a couple minutes.  Unique but wouldn't order again.\n\nGrilled Octopus:  Very tender and well prepared, but it could have used a bit more grilling/smokiness.\n\nHousemade grilled pita with favosalata:  Pita is thick, not what you would typically expect of pita.  Favosalata was ok.\n\nSquash Ravioli:  Very Good.  Full of texture and flavor with nuts, mushrooms and cheese.  Loads of butter.\n\nGalaktoboureko :  Custard in filo dough, shaped like spring rolls and fried.  Served with Pistachio ice cream.  Very good.  \n\nOverall, the food was pretty good.

As a Bay Area resident for the past decade, I don't know how I missed this one.\n\nIn any case, as the saying goes... better late than never.\n\nTo start, we tried the zucchini cakes, the lamb riblets, and the watermelon salad. All were perfectly prepared, elegantly presented, and seasoned wonderfully. The star were the riblets for me as they were finger licking good. The meat was fall of the bone tender, with that rich lamb flavor, perhaps the best lamb I've ever tasted.\n\nFor my entree, I went with the whole grilled fish (branzino). When it came out, it was still steaming hot, the fish was so succulent, and delicately seasoned so that the taste of the fish itself came through. You'd be hard pressed to find another place that can prepare fish as good as this. If you're put off by eating fish off the carcass, they have an option to filet the fish for you and prepare it that way. But my thought is that eating it as a whole will result in a moister more succulent product although dealing with fish bones could be a little bit of a hassle.\n\nFor dessert we tried what is perhaps their signature offering which was the Kataifi Ekmek. It's the dessert that looks like the bottom layer is a bed of crispy noodles. it's rich but not heavy, with just a hint of sweetness, and a nice finishing crunch from the shredded pastry. It really hits all the nice textural notes that an ideal dessert should have.\n\nI'm really looking forward to my next visit here and can not speak more highly of this place.

It was my husband's dish he just had to order after watching it on the spit being cooked near our table.  We all gasped in delight when it came to the table. The waiter said it still had its bacon cap.  I think that really meant it was mostly fat.\n\nIt came with potatoes that were not crispy or soft, maybe not fully cooked.  It also had big pieces of more hard than crispy pork rind.\n\nIt was a huge and I mean huge bone with what looked like lots of meat along the bone.   It looked so good on the outside.  After so many appetizers that within a few bites, my husband opted to take it home.\n\nWell, I warmed it up in the microwave the next day.  I saw so much liquid fat pooling on the plate, I though WOW so much fat but good to get it off the meat.  Then I cut in.  No matter where, I found fat marbled with little meat.  Impossible to separate the 2.  The only edible part was when I cut off the bone from all that \"meat\" and ate the thin strip of meat right on the bone.  All that fat was really gross though my parrot was delighted to get a hunk of it.  Suet!!!!!!!!!!.\n\nWe had lots of the appetizers, 7,  and enjoyed most of them.  Fun!  My favorite was the Taramosalata served with soft, chubby pieces of grilled pita bread.  The spread is salty cod roe in some sort of creamy spread.  The pita is really good but very filling.  It is accompanied by a mound of very pickled vegetables that I loved and was a welcome respite from such a fatty meal.\n\nI also loved the grilled artichokes.  The grilled octopus was almost too soft but had a great grilled charred flavor.  A lot of the appetizers sat in olive oil.  The only one I did not enjoy was the pikti which was a terrine of pig head and trotters.  It had no flavor and just had a fatty feel in my mouth.\n\nI had the lamb shank which was the typical huge size.  It was not the best I have ever had but good.  I really enjoyed the orzo and myzithra bed it sat in.  Most was eaten at home as I was too full.\n\nI think the desserts were the hilight of the night.  Yes, as stuffed little piggies we were, we managed to eat dessert.  I had Galaktoboureko with semolia custard in filo, a scoop of the best pistachio ice cream I have ever had which sat on fresh slices of apricot.  My husband had the best dessert, which was a seasonal one.  It was a combination of fresh berries crushed and pressed into maybe sponge cake.  It was so full of berry flavor.  So moist and screamed summer.  We all loved it.  Yes, we made him share.  \n\nOur friends ordered the HUGE ice cream sundae.  It elicited gasps of joy when it arrived it was so big and beautiful.  It had excellent ice cream especially the dense chocolate one, lots of whip cream and chocolate sauce.  \n\nWe would go back though knowing now the emphasis on so much fat in lots of the dishes, we would order more carefully.  Maybe order one of the grilled fish I saw being served.  They looked good!!  Never would we order the fat, I mean pork again.  We already are on statins.   I think we could even just order appetizers, skip the entree altogether and then go straight to desserts.  \n\nI should add the service was excellent and the seats were so comfortable.  We had great company for dinner so we enjoyed our evening.   \n\nFor 4 of us, the bill was over $500 but $230 of that was from 2 bottles of excellent wine so the food portion was very reasonable for all that food.", "author": "Kell M."}

Magic. Pure and simple. I can't believe the succulent morsels that covered our groaning table, salty, lemony, grilled kalamari, a salad made of fresh peas and mint that made me close my eyes for a second, so that I wouldn't explode with screams of ecstasy, embarrassing my lunch date and fellow eaters.\n\nThe whole baked sole, crispy on the outside and seasoned exquisitely with a graceful hand, so as not to overpower this tender fish. Saghanaki - pan fried Kefalotiri cheese with lemon & oregano, piquant and so scrumptious I scraped the plate with my finger, yes, I actually used my finger.\n\nThey have great drinks as you would expect, fine Greek coffee and dessert, but the coup de grace for me had to be the service. On the day we visited Chris B. was our server and he was warm and funny, prompt and helpful but never anxious or overbearing. If every restaurant experience could be like Kokkari then the world would be a happier, more satisfied place.", "author": "Teresita C."}

The ingredients that a considerable amount of American palettes aren't just quite used to; grape leaves, tzatziki, kalamata olives, kabob meat, and so on. I am not sure if it is the savory notes of Mediterranean food, the devilishly delicious dips, or the fact that it is just something different and not always easy to find in the states that keep me going back for more.\n\nWith a little help from my Cleveland, Seattle, and LA yelp gals - we ordered rounds of dolmas, Zucchini Cakes, Grilled Calamari, and Grilled meatballs. Essentially, Greek food on steroids - this place makes it fresh and fabulous. The Tzatziki sauce was unreal and the perfect ratio of yogurt to spices with a delightful texture. The calamari was grilled in its original form - not minced or sliced pieces - supporting the fresh aspect of the menu even more. I knew what I was eating and it wasn't a fried ambiguous glob of food. My favorite of your magnificent appetizer medley had to be the dolmas and the meatballs. For dessert? The bakliva ice cream. Yea, that's right: bakliva ice cream. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.", "author": "Frances H."}

Since that day I have been back in so many occasions, probably around a dozen of times. Kokarri is one of the best restaurants in the Bay Area and maybe in the entire California. The Halibut with olives, artichokes and lentils has been a must every time visit this restaurant. The Zucchini cake is excellent as well as the calamari and grilled lamb.\n\nI have taken my clients to this restaurant and they always left happy.

Luckily, the bartender there was *excellent* at managing the situation and making sure people sat in the order they arrived. That was such a pleasure because it meant we could just enjoy our drinks and not worry about defending our territory.\n\nAfter a delicious martini and glass of wine, respectively, we were seated at the bar and soon after had menus in our hand. Now came the HARDEST part--how to decide what to order. During our wait for a spot, we'd seen so many amazing looking dishes!\n\nThe bartender shared the specials and we settled on sharing: lamb meatballs, grilled octopus, fried smelt, Greek salad, and a goat stew. Every. Single. Thing. Was out of this world. It was more than enough food for the two of us, but we agreed we wouldn't have cut a single thing from the order. The only adjustment, in fact, that we would have made is making the portion of the smelt a little smaller--there were really a ton of what our waiter called \"fries with eyes.\"\n\nThe meatballs were in such a delicious spicy tomato sauce and were excellently spiced themselves...we used our bread to mop up all the sauce (and the waiter noticed this and did not try to take it away when he came with other dishes--love the attention to detail!). The octopus was simply the best I've ever had (and the 2nd best of my companion)--it was so tender and flavorful, nearly like butter. The smelt were seriously yummy and my favorite Greek dish. The salad was fresh and bright, and led us nicely into the insanity that was the goat stew. This stew was the highlight of the night--it was caramelized, tender, savory, slightly sweet, with bits of feta and artichoke and fresh oregano that just made every bite better than the last. We couldn't quite finish it, but we took it home and I'm going to enjoy the rest today!\n\nOur meal came to just under $160 total, so it's not cheap, butgo here, the reviews are right. It's wonderful.", "author": "Joetta G."}

I made a reservation for 3  people nearly a month ago but received a call from Kokkari today confirming a reservation for only 2 people. I pointed out the error and asked if there was anything that could be done. The caller rudely said no and hinted that any mistake was my own. I then spoke with the manager to discuss the situation and he was equally rude, if not more so. When asked if anything further could be done to accommodate an extra party, the manager said no because they took more reservations that they could even handle.\n\nI understand that things happen and mistakes are made, but to be treated without regard is unacceptable. A simple apology or some understanding or effort to accommodate would have gone a long way. But the restaurant's snooty, snide and fast talking manager made no effort at customer service. Someone needs to remind him that customer service is the name of the game in the hospitality industry. \n\nBe warned--don't suffer the indignity of dealing with Kokkari's staff.", "author": "Jacob M."}

Most of the time they're just too sour, and tart for me. Like someone put too much lemon on it. The dolmathes here were not like that at all, it was a really good balance. Totally changed my expectations of what a dolmathe should taste like.\n\nThe Lamp Souvlaki was also really good. Juicy and tender, really no complaints here at all.

Not only was he attentive and helpful as most good servers are, he was also extremely charismatic and hilarious, keeping us entertained for our entire 3-hour dinner. \n\nMy boyfriend took me here for my birthday and even though we had high expectations, Kokkari still exceeded them.  The Greek white wine that Edward recommended was delicious and the food was mouth-watering good. \n\nPlease refrain from drooling on your keyboard as you read the next section. \n\nWe ordered:\n     -\"Octapodaki tou Yiorgou\" - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil ($15.50): The tender octopus with a simple dressing makes this small plate unique and a definite must-order. \n     - \"Mapakia\" - wood-oven roasted Brussels sprouts with capers & lemon ($9): I've tried so many different preparations of brussel sprouts and these were the most delicious (maybe it was the capers). \n     - \"Manti\" (one of their specials) - ground duck baked with phyllo dough ($10): My boyfriend ate most of these but the one bite I had was full of flavor. \n     - \"Horiatiki\" - classic Greek salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, oregano, olives & feta ($12): Simple, yet fresh and delicious. \n     - \"Portokalosalata\" - mixed citrus salad with rose water, cinnamon, Medjool dates & candied walnuts ($11.50): I ordered this because I wanted something different from their basic Greek salad. I'm so glad I did because it was absolutely amazing. If you like to mix sweet and savory flavors, you will love this. \n     - \"Psari sto Furno\" - wood-oven sea bass Broudeto style in a spicy tomato sauce with prawns & mussels ($43): The sea bass was so delicate and paired great with the chunky tomato sauce. The prawns and mussels were not as satisfying, so I wouldn't recommend them as an add-on. \n     - \"Goat Stew\" (another special) - tender goat with feta and orzo (and other good stuff): SO GOOD- My boyfriend ordered this and I could not keep my fork out of his plate. You, or someone at your table, must order this if they have it available. It is heavenly. \n     - \"Galaktoboureko\" - Semolina custard in phyllo dough with Black Mission figs & creme fraiche ice cream ($8): Weren't we too full for dessert? Yes. Did we order it anyways and still finish it? We sure did.  According to our server, this was their best dessert, and I'll definitely take his word for it because it was amazing- a gift from the Greek gods, the perfect combination of creamy ice cream and crispy phyllo dough. \n\nAltogether, we ordered way too much food for two people, but everything was so good that we couldn't help ourselves.  I can confidently say that our dinner at Kokkari was the best overall dining experience that I have ever had.  \n\nHighlights:\n- grilled octopus\n- mixed citrus salad\n- goat stew\n- Edward", "author": "Juliana K."}

Let me start off by saying this dude eats. And by eat, he EATS...a lot. Which is great! I pretty much had a chance to try half the menu (I'm exaggerating, ..... kind of?). Let's start off with the food, shall we? \n\n\nOctapodaki tou Ylorgou: grilled octopus with lemon, oregano, & olive oil. Was told by our lovely waitress that it's prepped the night before and soaked in a way where the chewiness of the octopus becomes tederized and soft! Didn't disappoint!\n\nKolokithokeftethes: crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber served with a mint-yogurt dressing. Not my usual go-to dish but we trusted our waitress' recommendations so we went for it. The dressing was refreshing and heavy at the same time. Perfect combo with the fried zucchini\n\nArnisia Plevrakia: grilled lamb riblets with lemon and oregano. OFF WITH THY BONES. Really, the meat was juicy and fell off the bones like magic. AMAZZZZZING FLAVORS. I secretly wished I could've ordered another order of this dish but our entrees didn't even come yet.... I decided to hold out for the sake of saving space in my tummy\n\nI ordered the lamb shank as my entree and I loved it. The meat was cooked perfectly and fell off the bones. Anddddd surprisingly, it was huge portion of meat! (Good thing I didn't order another appetizer.... although.... they DO provide takeout boxes so............)\n\nWith all the \"WHOAAA\" and \"OMG THIS IS SO GOOD\" exchanged during our meal, it wouldn't have been the same without the service we received. Our waitress (I wish I got her name! She was such a sweetheart) was so attentive and helpful throughout our dinner. She was informative and gave great suggestions without being overwhelming. I found out later that my friend rushed to the hostess while I went to the restroom to drop off a birthday dessert he had bought for me. Our waitress came at the end of our lovely dinner with candles and even notified the cooks to add the words 'Happy Birthday' on the other desserts we ordered. \n\nWow this review was definitely a mouthful but Kokkari deserved every single letter. It was a dining experience that'll have me coming back for more!

Only wish that the side can be something other than the potato wedges which are a bit hard and filling alongside the meat\n- Lamb rack: there were 3-4 racks, cooked medium-rare. Tender\n- Lamb shank: my brother finished every morsel of this dish, so I'm guessing it must be nice\n- Pork (special of the day): our waiter claims this dish is his \"favorite\" dish so my dad gave it a try. He's one of the pickiest eater I know and not easily satisifed, but he was blown away by this dish! Unlike normal pork chops, I barely had to use any strength to cut the meat - it's that soft.\n\nNOTE:\n- Main courses are HUGE (twice larger than the usual fancy restaurants) so keep that in mind when ordering other dishes\n- Appetizers are comparatively tiny. We almost ordered more to share after seeing how tiny they were but so glad we didn't since we wouldn't have room for the main courses otherwise\n- This place is POPULAR.

We had the lamb skewer for our main dish and it was cooked perfectly. Not too \"lamb-y\" if you know what I mean. The flourless chocolate cake was the perfect dessert - there was a nice balance of textures - with the cake itself and the whipped cream on the side.\n\nThis is the perfect spot for a nice dinner (date) or group outing. Ambiance was lovely - with an active rotisserie in the main dining room and nice, low lighting.", "author": "Riana L."}

We had an 8:30 reservation, but didn't get seated until around 9:15 because the previous party at the table wasn't leaving. Because of the delay though, they gave us two free appetizers! The best dish of the night was definitely the zucchini cakes - absolute crispy perfection. I would definitely also recommend the spanokopitas and the pita platter.  \n\nThe makaronia ravioli was a bit of a disappointment, as it was bland, but not enough to take away from the amazing appetizers that we were served. You can definitely eat enough appetizers here to make a full meal. The best part was that even though I was full, the food wasn't heavy and didn't leave you feeling uncomfortable. \n\nThe staff here were very friendly and service was extremely fast.

Almost 3k reviews and 4.5 stars?! What?! Okay, super stoked to try this place! \n\nThe outside entrance makes the place look small, but this is deceptive. Behind the bar (which is also pretty small) is an abundance of seating. LOVED the ambiance (this is big for me). Very rustic and warm. The place was packed, but didn't feel over-crowded. \n\nNow onto the food! So... my dining companion was FROM the Mediterranean and was underwhelmed by what we ordered. I agree, really. The food here is good but it's not OUT OF THIS WORLD good like the ratings would suggest. Maybe we didn't order the show-stoppers. The app selection is pretty impressive... and the artichokes were yummy. But I actually thought the chicken entree was a little dry! For these prices nothing should be dry except my wine. I don't eat red meat so I have sampled A LOT of chicken in my lifetime.

From my seat I had a great view of the spit where they were roasting meat which was definitely a treat! Our server was very nice but it was occasionally hard to get a hold of him because he was responsible for a good amount of tables in the vicinity. The bread they give you to start with is delicious and they will replenish the basket as many times as you wish! So legit. \n\nWe ordered the zucchini cakes, chicken livers, and the crispy smelts to start with, and then we decided to share the goat stew for our entree. Service was really quick for the zucchini cakes so we were able to dive right in on those. I was a bit disappointed because they were smaller than I thought they would be, but at least they were tasty! Still not a very good deal at $10.75 for two... I did not like the chicken livers but we ordered these for my boyfriend as he loves them. He said they were pretty good and they did give a decent portion. My favorite were the fried SMELTS! I was a bit surprised that I liked them so much, given that it's a whole small fish, but it was deep fried and crispy and when we dipped it in a side of tzatziki sauce it was AMAZING! Seriously this is an underrated item on the menu, ORDER THE SMELTS. $10.50 for a huge plate of them! After we finished the plate I was kind of full and was scared we weren't going to be able to finish the goat stew lol\n\nThe goat stew was very good, I'm glad we chose that over an exorbitantly priced whole fish (price was \"As Quoted\" aka \"Market Price\" -____-) The stew was served in a cast iron dish and it was piping hot when it arrived. Lots of meat in there which was great and the addition of the artichoke hearts really gave it a nice tart taste to punch up the flavor. Although it's pricey ($30-something) it's worth it and it's something special because when do you really eat GOAT?\n\nWe were too full for dessert but maybe I can come back another time and try some Baklava.

Luckily for us, that meant easy resies and no wait.  \n\nThe ambiance is nice and quiet but that may be because the place was not packed like usual.  Our waitress was also very excellent - she was nice and knowledgeable about the dishes.  I like waiters/waitresses who can speak from their own personal experiences from having actually tried the food where they work.  \n\nZucchini Cakes:  The waitress and every other Yelp review were right on this one.  The cakes were so good -- like crab cakes but with zucchini.  Two cakes on one dish accompanied by mint yogurt dressing and cucumber slices.  The mint yogurt dressing and pickled cucumbers gave the dense fried cake a refreshing balance.  I think I would have been happy with 3 more plates of this.\n\nLamb Riblets:  I am not a fan of ribs -- I know, crazy, right?!  But I love lamb.  And based on my bf's unbiased opinion, these were the best thing ever.  The ribs were very tender and the taste of lamb was present but not too overwhelming.\n\nTaramosalata, Favosalata and Tirosalata with Grilled Pita:  We ordered three spread though I think you have a choice of however many you want to order.  The Tirosalata was my favorite.  It is a creamy and rich jalapeno spread of some sort with feta cheese.  The Taramosalata is a cod roe spread but I couldn't really taste any hint of fish.  It might have been because I ate so much of the Tirosalata.  The Favosalata is a fava bean spread that is reminiscent of hummus except the bean taste is a little stronger than hummus.\n\nLamb Burger, medium rare:  By the time we got our burger, we were stuffed to the max.  It was nice that they cut the burger in two and served each on a different plate because we were only able to eat half.  The burger, which is really ground marinated lamb meat wrapped in pita, was extraordinary.  They made it more rare than medium rare, which I didn't mind at all.  The lamb, like the riblets, was not too overwhelming in the gaminess area so it was perfect.  The spices they use with the ground lamb meat was flavorful and perfectly balanced by the tzakiki sauce.  This has completely changed my view on how a burger should be.", "author": "Linh V."}

I loved the Zucchini Cakes the most.  It was crispy on the outside and the combination of flavors just hit the spot.  We also had the fried smelt as appetizer and it was just as addicting as what the Pringles slogan says, \"Once you pop, you can't stop\".  As my entree, I enjoyed the combination of the salted, well-cooked quail and the tangy spanakorizo (spinach and rice).  The squirt of lemon gave it a little kick. The texture and consistency of the spanakorizo tasted similar to a paella. Two thumbs up.", "author": "Therese F."}

The grilled meatballs were definitely a favorite of mine and my coworkers. They are tiny meatballs, grilled, and topped with a spicy tomato sauce and greek yogurt. The calamari and the cheese pies were both pretty good but the meatballs totally stole the show. I would definitely recommend these appetizers.\n\nFor my entree, I ordered the chicken souvlaki. The chicken souvlaki was grilled and marinated with greek yogurt, peppers and onions and was extremely flavorful! It came with a side of romaine salad and also some pita bread and tzatziki for dipping. I completely devoured the whole plate, it was that delicious! My coworkers ordered various dishes from the moussaka to the halibut. Everyone loved their food!\n\nWe, of course, saved room for dessert and coffee. I had the sokolatina which is a flourless chocolate cake and it came with a huge side of whipped cream. It was very sweet, especially when paired with the whipped cream, and I found it a little too sweet for my liking but it was nevertheless delicious.\n\nService was great from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave us great recommendations. He was even happy to check with the chef about some food ingredients since I'm deathly allergic to pine nuts. The staff are very nice and efficient and make you feel comfortable - just like you're eating at a cozy home in Greece.\n\nI will definitely be back! Well deserved 5 stars all around.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

She said she hadn't had sea bass that delicious since she visited Spain.  She only wished that they they were served with the AWESOME potatoes we received with our meal.\n\nSpeaking of my meal, I had the best lamb chops ever.  They were tender, and not overly \"gamey.\"  Just beautiful.  And so were the zucchini fritters. I still think about this restaurant.    \n\nThe only thing I was disappointed with was the bread pudding.  It wasn't really a bread pudding -- more like a fruit gelatin concoction.  One of my friends actually loved it and found it refreshing, but I wanted bread pudding so it didn't do it for me.  (or as my family says...had my mouth set for some bread pudding but got a bowl full of fruit and some pastry instead.)\n\nBonus, Our waitress was great.

By the time we left around 8pm, we felt like a little tuna being circled by hungry sharks.\n\n* GET THE GALAKTOBOUREKO DESSERT (it was the first one on the dessert menu when we went) - AMAZING!!!  One of the very few desserts my husband remembers to this day (the other is the pot de creme at Scarpetta).\n\n* GET THE LAMB.  So tasty, seasoning was AMAZING - especially when you see them being cooked over the grill in the middle of the dining room.  Nothing fancy schmany - straight BBQ.

Perfect paired with a glass of wine on days you want to dine light.  \n\nThe wine selection is very decent, and the waiter was very kind about allowing us to try several - one for each of our dishes. \n\nFor desserts, we had the baklava and Galaktoboureko which is a custard filled phyllo shell. The Galaktoboureko was absolutely delicious. The custard was not too rich, yet still very creamy, and the phyllo shell was crisp to perfection. There was no need for the ice cream, but we used it to cool the Galaktoboureko down since it was too delicious to keep our forks out of even for a minute. \n\nDessert was accompanied by stone ground coffee heated over hot sand, which was a spectacle on its own if you are have a chance to make your way to the kitchen to view the process", "author": "Grace G."}

I heard only my neighbors rambling instead of my partner -which defeated the whole purpose of being there.  We just stared at each other and ate.   \n\nAnd man, when I had to go to the restroom the restaurant went from 5 star to a 1 star.  a) Can only go to the restroom by elevator  b) The elevator had big guys coming up with huge bins of garbages FROM THE SAME ELEVATOR- they were heading for the back exit since they were closing the restaurant I guess  c) When I went in the elevator after they came out.  I totally felt like vomiting everything I ate.  I felt like I was at the dumpster with some hobos!  Awful experience.  d) elevator = slow :) \n\nPROS:   AMAZING FOOD & SERVERS: The octopus appetizer was amazingly good (DrooL)- I also had a quail entree that was really good.

Octopus is amazing and the sauce is wonderful to dip bread in.\n-Calamari: Some people liked this more than the octopus.

While doing so, he decided to consult Yelp for the top, overall restaurants in the city and came across Kokkari Estiatorio.  The Greek taverna had one of the highest ratings on the site and had achieved this feat with a substantial number of validating reviews.  We immediately booked our table weeks in advance to ensure that we did not miss out on the fabulous spot.  \n\nAs we entered the sprawling, rustic dining establishment, we were overwhelmed by the packed tables and crowded bar, thankful that we had the good sense to confirm our space ahead of time.  While elegant and modern, the restaurant had a real country feel with sturdy wooden tables, heavily cushioned chairs, and a large fireplace adorned with chickens roasting over the open fire.  Floor lamps were positioned next to every seating area, which created an intimate feel for each party.  The large rear dining room was even blessed with a view of the busy open kitchen.  A secretive  elevator whisked patrons down to a dark lair where the restrooms were.  Each element of the decor had been strategically composed.\n\nBack at our little cozy dining area, we were served some doughy bread with authentic dipping oil and a bowl of briny olives.  We began our meal with a fresh Greek salad and a unique dish of Grilled Calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, and orange.  The flavorful squid rings were filled with this creamy, tart blend and served with a side of black olives.\n\nAfter our fabulous starters, my brother opted for the Lemon-Oregano Chicken, which was topped with fresh spring onions and served with roasted potatoes.  The chicken was extremely tender and moist.  The whole plate was rustic and comfortingly home-style.  I ordered a large fillet of pan-roasted Pacific Halibut, which was lightly seasoned, bringing out the true flavor of the fish.  The fabulous daily special was served with brilliantly green peas and asparagus.  The plate was a true balance of land and sea simplicity.\n\nKokkari Estiatorio might have had a lively bar-scene full of trendsetting professionals, but the food was rustic and traditional.

Not my favorite appetizer though. \n\nGrilled Octopus - with lemon, oregano & olive oil - $12.75\nSurprisingly good. The charred octopus is very tasty. \n\nGrilled Meatballs - with spiced tomato sauce & Greek yogurt - $8.5\nMeatballs are delicious. Would taste great with a pasta but these were appetizers so we each had a meatball. \n\nCheese - I can't remember which one it is, but it was a thick slice of cheese Wonderful with bread.  \n\nENTREES\n\nWhole Fish - traditionally grilled with braised greens, lemon & Cretan olive oil - AQ\nMy favorite dish of the night. The fish is beautifully laid out, light and fluffy. \n\nGrilled Lamb Chops - with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes - $27.5\nNicely cooked and it came off the bone fairly easily. Very good flavoring on the meat as well. \n\nKotopoula Souvlas, rotisserie roasted half chicken with lemon, oregano potatoes. Simple and delicious. The chicken is tender and the lemon was drizzled on top when it was served. This was the special for Fridays. \n\nDESSERT\n\nGalaktoboureko - semolina custard in filo with quince spoon sweet & pistachio ice cream - $8    Loved this dish. The pistachio ice cream is light and wonderful. The filo is also very light and delicious. \n\nBaklava - traditional walnut & honey baklava with vanilla-praline ice cream - $9\nNot as fluffy as I liked but still good. Little too much on the sweet side but it may have just been too much honey. \n\nMilo Furnisto - baked cinnamon & walnut stuffed apple with masticha gelato - $8\nLeast favorite dessert. Too sweet for me and the apple was so full of sweets I stopped eating. The ice cream is wonderful though. \n\nALCOHOL\n\nThe winner in alcoholic drinks is this mix of vodka and orange. I'll have to get the name, but it was a bartender special when we asked them for a cocktail with vodka. We each had at least 2 of these. SO GOOD.\n\nGlasses of wine run about $9-12. Pretty good tolosa pinot noir. \n\n\nSERVICE\nVery on point and attentive.\n\nRESTROOM\nYou have to go through the kitchen hallway, down the elevators, down another hall, past the private room, and into the black hole to get there.

The restaurant is a lovely site with the big wooden tables and big windows.  Now on to the food:\n\nDolmathes -as legit and yummy as it gets.  The Greeks make it with dill and mint and so does Kokkari.  This means the stuffed grape leaves are light and herby fresh.  \n\nFried smelts - I am a fan of little fishes (and people).  These are not greasy at all and are served on top of a fluffy bed of potatoes and lemon.\n\nTaramosalata - just amazing and super fresh.  This is one of my favorite Greek spreads. A baguette, taramosalata and some mint tea and you're transported to watching the sunset in Santorini.\n\nMoussaka - made with ground spiced lamb (authentic Greek style) and eggplant.  Soft, fluffy bechamel on top makes this a very comforting dish.\n\nLamb chops - if a Greek restaurant can't make good lamb chops, then it can't be a good Greek restaurant.

The grilled octopus and grilled artichoke and eggplant were delicious. The greek yogurt accompanying the veggies was outstanding and our wine selection was spot on. The big disappointment was the main dish. Based on our server's recommendation we ordered the rotisserie lamb which our server said was outstanding. The lamb was flaccid and full of gristle. Rotisserie if done properly should have a crisp outer layer and juicy interior. The texture was extremely off putting. Perhaps it was not cooked enough. The best part of the dish was the potatoes but they are just a side note. This is an expensive restaurant with an outstanding reputation so I  expected better.", "author": "Rose G."}

I made reservations for a party of six for a Thursday afternoon - really liked the atmosphere, though little of it reminded me of a greek restaurant. \n\nFrom my experience with Greek restaurants, the mezes are usually not to be missed. We ordered the fried smelts, brussel sprouts, zucchini cakes, and octopus for the table. Sadly, none of the appetizers turned out to be ... the octopus was a bit tough and chewy, the brussel sprouts forgettable. The fried smelts were decent but not particularly greek, and the zucchini cakes were good - unexpected cheese taste which met mixed reactions at my table - I liked it. \n\nOrdered the lamb souvlaki, which included grilled pita slices, a chickpea salad, and some mixed vegetables. Sad to say it, but my more recent meal at Bosphorus in Walnut Creek was far better. \n\nIf you're ever in NYC, check out Pylos or Kefi. Much better Greek/Mediterranean food.", "author": "Elizabeth L."}

We had a five star experience the first visit so decided to make dinner here the highlight of our visit to San Francisco with my parents and my nephew (party of five).  We were seated right on time but into a cramped semi-circle booth in the hallway between the fireplace room and the larger back room.  Our waiter brought our waters and the sommelier brought our drinks, then the waiter proceeded to stand and talk to a couple at the table that was just across from us for 15 minutes.  We finally flagged down the sommelier to take our food order; she informed us that one of the owners was in the booth across the way.  The waiter glanced over when he heard us ordering and popped back over.  He never once apologized for leaving us stranded.  We all ordered small plates.  Because the waiter did not pay attention to who ordered what, my husband and I received all 3 of our courses and had nearly finished eating before my dad got any of his food.  We had to flag the waiter down to get refills of our wine and beer.  I was shocked that the service was so poor after we had had such a wonderful experience last time.  (Wouldn't you think the owner would have wanted the other guests taken care of?!?)\n\nThe only reason that I am awarding 3 stars instead of 1 is that the octopus and the watermelon salad, along with the zucchini cakes are superb.

Unfortunately, I made the mistake of deciding to order items that I had never tried at Evvia.  \n\nDespite its #1 rating, I had no trouble getting dinner reservations on a Wednesday night, though I believe it was the last seating.  I came with 2 friends, and between the 3 of us, we ordered half the appetizers and a couple of the entree's.  The grilled octopus and pan-fried cheese were very good, but the lamb meatballs, calamari and smelts fell flat.\n\nThe grilled lamb chops at Evvia are amazing, and from what I hear, it's the same at Kokkari.  However, to try something new, I went with the Moussaka (lamb casserole).  We also had the ravioli of butternut squash.  The ravioli was serviceable, but not what we were expecting from San Francisco's top rated restaurant.  The Moussaka was basically soggy noodles with pieces of minced lamb mixed with yogurt.  This is the one dish I would actually classify as bad.  Should've stuck with the lamb chops and daily fish.\n\nFor dessert we decided not to take any chances and ordered two servings of the Galaktoboureko to share between the 3 of us.  Delicious as usual.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor matches that of Evvia in Palo Alto with a kind of rustic Mediterranean feel.  Our server was OK, but seemed to disappear for long periods of time.  I waived down one of the bussers when I wanted a refill on my drink.\n\nOverall, an OK experience, but not what I expected from Kokkari.", "author": "N. C. L."}

Kolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing - $8.75 - These were amazing! The cakes were crispy and heavy yet the dressing pushed back on the rich taste\n2. Octapodaki tou Yiorgou- grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil - $13.75 - I highly recommend this. I usually don't eat octopus but when I took a bite of this, I wanted more... granted it only came with a couple pieces so I was sad after it was gone\n3. Horiatiki- classic Greek salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, oregano, olives & feta - $10 - This I could've passed on. I feel like I could've had this salad at any Greek restaurant.\n\nMain Courses\n1. Psari Psito - traditional grilled whole fish with horta & lemon - The fish was so soft and flakey. It was delicious but it wasn't the most amazing!\n2. Arnisia Paidakia - lamb chops grilled with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes - $38 - I really liked how the lamb chops turned out. They were soft and a bit rare, just the way they should be cooked (as according to Gordon Ramsy on Hell's Kitchen). The flavor of the dish was infused into the meat which made it really succulent and delicious!\n3. Goat Stew - I don't see this on the menu but our server was able to customize our meal for us. The goat stew was definitely the best of the night. It was sort of like a risotto but full of meat, cheese and flavor. If you have the opportunity to try this, I highly recommend this dish.\n\nI don't remember what we had for dessert.

I visited the restaurant for a late dinner with my girlfriend on a thursday.\nThe decor and ambience are definitely top of the class. The building evokes the architecture of mediterranean houses and the warm atmosphere puts you at your ease immediately.\nWe started with grilled cheese, zucchini cakes, and octopus. The grilled cheese was too salty, while the octopus was a little burned and not entirely fresh. I liked the texture and the flavor of zucchini cake.\nWe shared a seabass as an entree.

I had the traditional chicken lemon chicken soup (referring to all entrees by content rather than Greek names as they're escaping me) and it wasn't my favorite.

The place is great for serious date nights and special occasions. The ambience was very classy and even though it was quite crowded, we didn't feel uncomfortable so the setup was good. Our host was very helpful and he made sure we enjoyed everything we ordered. \n\nWe ordered bamies (okra), lamb riblets as appetizers. Both of them were perfect choices for paleo diet. And then as main dish we got lamb chops and their special for the day, goat stew. Lamb chops were great but the goat stew was *phenomenal*. As dessert we got figs with mint syrup which was light and complimentary to a great dinner. \n\nAs wine we ordered a bottle of Famiglia Mosso, Malbec which was pretty decent IMO.", "author": "Ertan D."}

I've heard great things from co-workers and other locals about how amazing the food here was, and that nothing really dissapoints.  It's true! \n\nThe restaurant is in a quiet part of FiDi near the water.  It's seemingly a small cozy spot, that atcually opens up to an open kitchen, very large backroom and basement with a private room.  The architecture is beautiful with exposed beams and large rustic windows. We had one of the best servers I've ever had, so kind and attentive, we never felt like we were forgotten.\n\nNow onto the food!\n\nWe started with cocktails, and ordered the fried zuchinni cakes and favosalata (hummus).  The pita was so soft, warm and thick.  The favosalata is similar to hummus, but creamier and in my opinion with more flavor.  We were also served cucumbers and other veggies.  The zuchinni cakes lived up to their hype.\n\nFor dinner, we both have lamb. He had the lamb chops, crispy and perfectly seasoned.  I had the lamb shank with orzo, so deliciously flavorful and the lamb fell off the bone.  As if we hadn't had enough to eat, we went for the baklava served with vanilla ice cream. It was the best baklava I've ever had! I loved cloves, and it had a very strong clove and cinnamon taste. This would be a great place to bring clients, have a romantic dinner, be a foodie, or really impress someone.", "author": "Jeanne M."}

Really, one of the most delicious restaurants in SF.\n\nFirst things first - lamb riblets! These are amazeballs. Tender and fatty with just the right amount of char. I'm not the biggest lamb fan, but I dare say: give me these over baby back ribs any day! And I love my baby back, baby back, baby back... :)\n\nWe also ordered the grilled octopus, cooked perfectly, without a hint of chewiness. The fried cheese was unlike anything I've ever had. It's so rich, so decadent, and just SO MUCH FLAVOR. The lamb skewers were great, but maybe the least notable out of the bunch. Finally, you must order dessert! We had custard baked in filo with a side of pistachio ice cream. Delicious even on an absolutely too full stomach.\n\nLastly, I really enjoyed the decor - it's got an Orange County/Newport Beach vibe.

I called from AT&T park, around 5pm, to inquire if I would need reservations for 2 in the next 30 minutes.  They stated they had no tables for 2 for dinner until 9:30p but we were welcome to come in and could sit at the bar and eat.  When we arrived, we put ourselves on standby, in the event someone canceled, and we saw a couple of empty tables.  To our dismay, a couple arriving to the bar after us snagged a table for 2 without a reservation.  I knew they hadn't had a reservation as I asked them specifically if they had called in advance for a table.  I was a bit upset.  The hostess wouldn't even give me any eye contact when I approached her to inquire when we could have a table, as obviously people were getting seated without reservations.  When I ventured to the back of the restaurant for a bathroom reprieve, there were so many empty tables, and that was at about 6:30pm or 7pm!  We eventually ate at the bar, and ordered the lamb riblets which were gamey and greasy, and we had to ask twice for bread.  The highly acclaimed gigantic beans appetizer was partially raw and chewy.  So disappointing.  I have enjoyed several meals here in the past and loved the ambiance, the service and the location.  I don't think I will return or recommend.", "author": "Lisa D."}

I can't say what was specifically ordered as I never looked at the menu and the food arrived before me, but it was delicious. My guess -- red beets with creme fraiche, a white fish cooked to perfection (I hate overcooked and undercooked fish) with a nicely braised skin, and a blue cheese salad on the side. My family was raving about the octopus, saying that it was cooked perfectly -- I don't eat octopus because I love the creature too much, but I'm trying to be honest about my family's reaction.\n\nOur waiter was funny, attentive, quick and patient -- incredibly competent and comfortable service -- I wish I had grabbed his name to include it here.\n\nThen, my mom being the foodie that she is, ordered us three different desserts. One was the \"house fav\" based on our server's recommendation:\n\nGalaktoboureko: This one was subtly sweet -- hard to go wrong with creme fraiche and a meyer lemon mix, in my opinion. Add to that the custard filled film.\n\nNext came the Yiaourti Me Meli, which I think is a great choice for those who may not want an extremely sweet dessert. It felt healthier with the dates and greek yogurt and honey.\n\nMy favorite was the last one: Summer Berry Pudding -- just the right amount of fresh berries and naughty sweet bread(?) -- whatever special magic they've put into this, do not skip on this dessert!", "author": "Michelle D."}

It was not a good experience. We felt the food was good, not great but it was the service that really made our dinner an unpleasant experience. We ordered 3 appetizers. Again good, not great. They did come out very quickly but then the empty plates sat at our tables for 20 minutes after we were finished. In the meantime the table next to us were seated 4 businessmen who brought in their own bottles of wine. Lots of attention was being spent on this table while empty dishes sat at ours. Finally someone offered to clear the plates. Then we waited another 10 minutes for our entrees to arrive. Now its been 30 minutes. As I said at the beginning of this review, the food was good not great. I had the lamb chops and decided to take one of the three chops home. Upon leaving the restaurant I was told the hostess had our \"doggie bag\". When I requested the bag the hostess reached into a closet by the front door and just about threw the bag at me. No thank you or have a great night or thanks for coming. nothing, not a word. We eat out often. One of our favorites is Gary Danko. The service (and food) is so far superior to what Kokkari had to offer. I think dining out is more than just eating good food. Its the entire experience and this was not good. I felt our wait person and hostess couldn't be bothered.", "author": "teri r."}

It's very common that places in this price range can garner this high of rating but turn out to be \"average\". The one aspect I really want to call out is CUSTOMER SERVICE. They were amazing at this and is what differentiates them from even significantly more expensive restaurants I've been too.\n\nWe had brought a jacket with helmets (rode motorcycles there) - they kindly asked if we wanted them placed in their closet. After the meal and while we were sipping coffee, they had covertly brought our jacket and helmets to the front desk so it was ready for us when we walked out. That attention to detail is REALLY hard to find in any restaurant of any caliber. Jillian was our waitress and was supremely awesome - checked in regularly and had a great attitude!\n\nHere is what I ate:\n\n-Spanakotiropita - Delicious. Perfectly flaky with a crispiness that, with a bite, breaks the crust pie into an assorted medley of crumbs (almost tempting me to lick the plate). \n-Papio Manti - Also delicious. Basically small meatballs with a fried dumpling-like crust, the duck meat is what sells it. Lots of flavor in one bite.\n-Psari sto Furno - That day they had three fish options - I chose seabass and got it deboned in the kitchen. Soft, flavorful, nice sides of yukon potatoes, onions, and scallions. Not too heavy with the sauce and just right for fish.", "author": "Raymond C."}

I am not a fan of lamb but Kokkari has definitely gotten their methods down on how to bring out the best flavors of lamb.\n\nBetween the two of us, we had:\n- Saganaki (although there was no fire show... but nonetheless, so yummy, savory, and salty- which I like!)\n- Grilled squid/octopus (also deliciously tender!)\n- Moussaka (bf said that this was the best moussaka he's had, aside from his mom's version of moussaka)\n- Special of the day lamb stew with orzo rice and lemony artichoke, topped with feta cheese (the meat was flavorful, succulent, and so tender)\n- Fried filo-wrapped custard (don't remember the name but the juxtaposition of crunchy filo shell + the creamy custard = heaven and fireworks)\n- A bottle of red \"Avaton\" (www.gerovassiliou.gr/en/wines/avaton) = AH-MAZING. It was also $150... ah well, it's worth it when you celebrate it with someone special :) The most expensive wine on their menu is $6500, btw!\n\nService\n- Superb! Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable... he was also very, very excited to tell us about the menu and offer recommendations from the wine list.

We also started with this fried feta appetizer and spanakopita, which were both fantastic. Overall I would say the food is similar if not the same as Evvia, but the key difference here is that this restaurant is much more upscale.

We decided it was finally time to stop taking everyone's word for it and taste for ourselves. I'm not all that familiar with Greek/Mediterranean cuisine beyond falafel, hummus, baklava, filo. But with Kokkari being known for what it is i knew they weren't going to be serving up the same stuff that you'd see in your average Greek restaurant. Upon walking in, we notice it's an older, mature scene. And the decor matched the more conservative crowd. Immediately I think CEOs, corporate executives, bankers types would love this place.\n\nWe ordered the following: \n-Karpouzi me Feta which was basically a watermelon salad with olive oil, cherry tomatoes and pine nuts.

It just tasted like shrimp in marinara sauce.\n\nEntrees:\n- Lamb chops: MUST HAVE!

To start we ordered the grilled lamb meatballs and zucchini cakes. The meatballs were good, but pretty standard. The zucchini cakes were incredibly delicious. I thought they would be heavy but they were light and fluffy and I wish the dish came with more! We also were accidentally given some kind of eggplant dip and pita. The pita was fresh however I wouldn't order the eggplant dip. Next we shared the lemon oregano chicken and moussaka. The chicken was pretty good, very flavorful and not dry at all. However, I was pretty full (after the pita and appetizers) by the time the mains arrived so I didn't fully enjoy it. Make sure you get the Moussaka, it was great! Comes out looking like some sort of casserole dish but you bite into layers of great flavors with every bite. Finally, closed out the meal with the baklava. I am usually a fan of baklava but I really did not enjoy this one. I think there were way too many walnuts for my liking and the consistency was a little off. Might be okay to other people but definitely not worth the calories for me!", "author": "Tracy S."}

I have ordered two dishes at Kokkari recently that were just \"OK:\" a goat and orzo stew that was not very memorable (other than its price/quality ratio), and a fairly disappointing goose that came to the table with a 10\" long sinewy wing piece that was essentially impossible to eat. Twice recently, I have tried to sit at the bar, but while waiting patiently by the windows, I have repeatedly been shouldered out by rude patrons who have not waited their turn and just plop right down in front of me.

I was fortunate enough to hear about this place in time to snag a table for 2 at lunch on our only free afternoon in SF.  We had just had a ginormous breakfast and walked for hours to make room for lunch here.  When we arrived to this lovely and welcoming restaurant, we were still not hungry, so when our waiter came to take our orders we kept it super light and were really bummed about coming all the way here and not going full throttle.  We ordered dolmas to start and I chose the vegetable souvlaki and my pal the octopus salad. While we waited, we sat at a lovely table for 2 in super comfy chairs and took in the view of the 2 roasting lambs in the fireplace/pit and sipped a French Ros\u00e9 and a Santorini white wine.  There were lots of men wearing monogrammed shirts and cufflinks inking deals and schmoozing clients.  Music played lightly, and conversations around us were lively but not obnoxious.  The lighting was warm and cozy and the decor was mediterrenean, relaxed and pleasing.  \nOur food arrived and it was beautifully presented.  Truth be told,  I was not expecting much from a simple vegetarian kebab, but as Justin N said, it was \"CONFUSINGLY FLAVORFUL\".  Artichoke, red peppers, eggplant and red onion.  That was it.  But it was wonderful!  It came with picked onions, yogurt w a red pepper sauce, pickled cucumbers, mint and the most delicious and perfectly seasoned roasted tomato I've ever tasted!  I was so satisfied that I didn't even touch the thick slices of pita on my plate.  My friend was very happy with his octopus salad and the dolmas were very good too.  The service was friendly and thoughtful.  And despite our super casual tourist attire, every person that engaged us was top notch!\nEven though we did not get to partake in their \"trademark\" dishes, based on our lunch experience, I absolutely plan on returning to Kokkari the next time I'm in San Francisco and would recommend it to anyone*! \n\n*with good taste", "author": "Lisette C."}

The maitre d' immediately took our coats and showed us to our table.  This was nothing compared to the exemplary service we received the rest of the evening.\n\nREWIND.  So that's not what really happened.  If I had been smart enough to show up with one or both of the accessories in my fantasy, it might have been a positive dining experience. I only blame myself. \n\nHere's the real scoop:\n\nOne of my girlfriends and I decided to celebrate the end of finals last month with a nice dinner out in the city.  We picked Kokkari based on rave reviews from various people we both trusted (note the past tense).  We had a reservation for 8:15pm on a weeknight, but we weren't seated until about 9pm.  I'm a patient gal, so it wasn't the wait time that bothered me.   What bothered me was that in the meantime, plenty of other (older) people strolled in and were immediately whisked off to their tables.  My friend was treated like a gnat by the maitre d' as she tried to ask him about the approximate wait time.   When we were finally seated, it was at a tiny table sandwiched in between two larger tables (this fact is important for later).  \n\nOur waiter was quite nice and humored us by answering all our questions.  He was also attentive throughout the evening, but not overbearingly so.  We definitely received great service from him, but only from him.  \n\nThe food was absolutely mouth-watering.  If I were rating Kokkari for the food alone, it would be an easy 5 stars from a girl who likes to grade on a harsh curve.  The zucchini cakes we had as an appetizer were flavorful.  For the main course,  I had the petrofska, which is an Atlantic char fillet brushed with olive oil and lemon, served with a side of olive tapenade.  The char was perfection, with deliciously crispy skin covering flaky goodness.  Dessert was dulce de leche ice cream with walnuts.  It was over-the-top sweet, but that is to be expected with anything labeled \"dulce de leche.\"  Kokkari, you get a pass for that.

I always enjoy Greek food at other places but it never dazzles me. I made the reservation at Kokkari based upon reviews but as the evening neared I was not looking forward to my reservation choice.\n\nWOW was I wrong. Both the food and service were amazing. This was the best meal I have ever had in San Francisco and I have hit all of the top restaurants in the bay area. \n\nMatt our waiter was great from the start, very personable, helping us narrow down our food selections (everything on the menu sounded excellent and the entrees being served near us looked even better). With his help we finally narrowed things down. \n\n\nAppetizers: (All 5 Stars)\nKarpouzi me Feta  (Watermelon & Feta) - light and refreshing \n\nKolokithokeftethes (Zucchini Cakes suggested by our waiter) - amazing you must order this and make them pronounce it. \n\nKalamari (Grilled Calamari - stuffed with feta and fennel) - if you like Grilled Calamari this is a very unique dish\n\nSpanakotriopita (filo Pies) light and buttery filled with feta and leeks etc\n\n\nEntrees: (All 5 Stars)\n\nDaily Rotisserie-  The daily rotisserie for the evening was a goat stew. Having had goat a few times in my life I have always though it to be a rubbery overcooked meat. (like eating an old person). Matt told us it would be tender and juicy at Kokkari. We rolled the dice and ordered it. This was the top entr\u00e9e of the evening. Succulent tender goat meat served in a flavorful red stew with orzo \n\nPsari Psito Wood-oven roasted california sea bass\n\nMoussaka (which was the best Moussaka I have ever had)\n\nArnisia Paidakia - lamb chops grilled with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette\n\n\nWine:\n2010 Andseron Valley Goldeneye Pinot Noir paired well with all the entrees (Suggested by our waiter) \n\n\nDessert: (All 5 Stars):\n\nBrandy soaked berry cake Special\n\nYiaourti Granita - Yogurt sorbet with berry  granita & mint syrup\n\n\n\nI never knew greek food could be so amazing.

I took my girlfriend here for her birthday because we heard such good things, but our experience was exceedingly underwhelming. First, our waiter was very condescending and he spoke so fast in a foreign accent that we could barely understand him. The pork head appetizer was the best thing we had; although, it was served cold just like everything else. Next best, were the dolmas; they were just as good as any premade ones you'd get at Costco or signature cafe in Safeway. We also ordered the octopus appetizer because of its reputation. It had the flavor of charred grilled chicken with a spongy calamari consistency - also cold. The prawns, definitely pass those up! Again, aside from being served at room temperature they tasted like the chef forgot to de-turd them. There were only 4 edible pieces - about half the quantity and quality of edible meat as you'd find in an $8 shrimp cocktail at Walgreen's. Before ordering entrees, we asked the waiter for his opinion since we heard they were so knowledgeable about the food. We ended up with the rotisserie lamb and grilled Mediterranean sea bass. The bass was the warmest thing we were served at about 81 degrees Fahrenheit. It also had the skin, head and some bones still intact which didn't bother me, but there wasn't much there to eat other than those components. The rotisserie lamb was the final, lasting fecal stain to complete the experience. It was like they pulled some leftover bones, grizzle and fat out of the trash that another customer didn't eat, threw in some potatoes and set it down on our table. Good thing I had one last sip of my dirty martini made with none other than Gordon's vodka to wash the taste out of my mouth before heading home to vomit from the torture I had just put my stomach through.\n\nIf you're looking to spend $200 on a fancy dining experience, avoid this place unless you want to be entertained by how bad a meal and service can get at such a price.", "author": "Jake H."}

We felt we were lucky to get a reservation at this highly regarded restaurant at 1:45 PM on a Friday afternoon. We were a little surprised when we came in at that hour only to find every single table was occupied and there were another six or eight couples waiting for a table. Business is good!! We had dinner plans and wanted to have a light lunch, so we focused mainly on the small plates. The wine list is impressive with several delicious choices by the glass, of which we liked  a Riesling and a Pinot Gris. For food We had octopus, calamari, peas with feta cheese, and Saghanaki. The hot cheese plate was our favorite. We thought the octopus was possibly a bit overcooked. The atmosphere was packed but pleasant and the service was fine. A galaktoboureko dessert was perfect.

Also, Metaxa Ouzo is a staple Ouzo to carry.  \n\n3) If you ever eat at a Greek person's house, you will never be served only 3 lamb chops.

Lots of wood, an open spit is the centerpiece of Kokkari. Tables were somewhat close together but that was hardly an issue. Dim lighting, perfect for a romantic weekend dinner.\n\nFood- 2 appetizers. They had a nightly special of duck dolmeh so I had to get that. Lady had the fried cheese which was highly recommended. Dolmeh were perfectly adequate with particular praise for the greek yogurt/creme side thing. The cheese was lemony and delicious. Eat it before it gets cold!\n\n2 Entrees. The lamb chops..I guess these are sort of obligatory for this restaurant. Sort of fatty (which I don't mind) and very lightly seasoned. The expect the flavor of the meat and the fire to be the highlight, and they are right, it is very good. I ordered another special the lamb roast, which was on the spit. This was delicate and flavorful and again lightly seasoned to really highlight the meat. \n\nThis all said, perhaps the most surprising thing was that the potatoes served with our entrees were the best part of the meal for us. Yes the meat was cooked perfectly, yes the presentation was home-y and cute, but the potatoes were the talking point of our entire evening. \n\nAll said and done along with 2 mixed drinks, it was $135+ before tip. Was it worth the price? I don't think so. We were fortunate enough to get an evening reservation at probably the hottest restaurant in the city on the long valentines weekend so we came with very high expectations.

The place is much bigger than you would imagine walking in. There is a larger dining room in the back.

I felt like I was in an old castle!\nI heard tons of hype about Kokkari before our visit, and I was not disappointed! \n\nThe manger, Demetri, was very nice when we arrived. Although our table wasn't ready, he invited us back to this wine island, so that we felt \"more welcome\". He checked on us a couple times throughout the meal.\n\nChris was our waiter. He knew the menu and specials like the back of his hand. It was apparent he is an expert his profession. Although, he did seem a little stressed out with several large parties in his section. It seemed like he needed one more bus boy/helper.\n\nWe ordered.... everything. We started with feta cheese and olives for the table. The feta was wondrous like nothing I've had before. Then, octopus salads. The octopus was charred and the dressing was perfect, not too heavy. Apparently, this is only on the lunch menu, but we called ahead to make sure we could all have it for dinner. I ordered the lamb chops at Chris' suggestion. I've never had such amazing lamb!!! One person in our party said to Chris, \"I am going to let you surprise me!\" - Chris brought him the 22 oz bone in ribeye steak, blackened with lemon sauce. Seriously, WORDS DO NOT DO IT JUSTICE!\n\nFor dessert, we got everything! Galaktoboureko, Milo Furnisto, Baklava and Rizogalo. All FANTASTIC!!!

Romantic except we were around arms length away from another couple and had only a small lamp separating us. Hard to be intimate when you were pretty much intimate with the couple next to you.\n\nFor starters, we had spanakotiropita and some dips - Melitzanosalata, Taramosalata, Tzatziki, Favosalata or Tirosalata - with housemade grilled pita. Both were pretty good and the filo pies were really crisp.\n\nFor main course, we had the following, which I will copy from their website:\nMoussaka - traditional casserole of spiced lamb, eggplant, potato & yogurt bechamel Arnisio Souvlaki - spiced lamb skewer grilled with onion, bay leaf & tomatoes with ttzatziki & potatoes\n\nI dunno what it was, but the moussaka just tasted like I was eating a ton of carbs - more potato than lamb.\n\nThe service was nice, but I don't think the food is worth the price.

Why the 3 1/2 stars though?  It was all kind of...forgettable though.  Nothing really stood out as amazing.\n\nWe had the tempura flava beans to start with, which were good.  I had the  avgolemono, which seemed like they tried to make it fancy, which was a shame because it wasn't as hearty and I didn't like it as much as the traditional kind.  The boyfriend grilled octopus and to be honest that was probably some of the best octopus we've had.  I usually find octopus to be way too chewy and seafoody (if you follow my posts you know that I'm allergic to shrimp and I hate the taste of most seafood), I found this to be really fresh and pretty good.\n\nMain course: The boyfriend got the goat stew, which was a special.  The goat was still a bit chewy, but in all honesty it didn't really taste like much other than that.  He stated that it could have been any meat in that stew and he wouldn't have known.  I had the lamb chops, and it was beautifully cooked and tasted amazing...but like I said, it didn't wow me either.\n\nDessert: we had the strawberry ouzu sorbet, which was very ouzuy and it was refreshing and delicious.

For the main course,I had the lamb chops and oh my! The portion is generous unlike a lot of other restaurants that serve pork cops that are the size of lollipops. I try not to eat starchy carbs so I asked to have my paps substituted and they had no problems doing so with Brussel sprouts. It tasted as if was meant to be paired with the dish. Very well prepared. My fiance had the goat dish which was also fantastic. It reminded me of pulled pork but much better. More lean and more flavor. The service was great as well.the server had a wealth of information on all the dishes and was enthusiastic to help us without being annoying. Lots of places have servers that act very subdued and it's fine, but we actually enjoyed the small talk with our server. Yet she did not impose on used in mid conversation. The meal came fast. No unnecessary waiting. Yet no rush to get us out of there. Great ambiance. The meal in total for two people with two appetizers and two entrees with two glasses of wine and tip came out about $140.

He was a nice guy and all but just different from the usual waiters.

It pretty much looks like pizza but it had a different flavor which makes it stand out versus pizza that you would pick up at a pizza joint. It was really good actually, one of the better dishes that we had for the night.\n\nThe 2nd appetizer that we ordered was the Octapodaki tou Yiorgou, which is grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil.. For $13, I expected a bit more but I guess I should've seen it coming seeing that its delicacy food. If you're looking for big portions, stay away from this plate. It literally tickled my tummy. Wasn't too great in my opinion.\n\nFor the main dish, I ordered the Anisia Paidakia, which is lamb chops grilled with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes. This was the plate that everyone was talking about on yelp and honestly, I expected a bit more. Maybe it's cause I'm not used to eating Greek/Mediterranean food but it certainly didn't WOW me. It had a little too much lemon in it, which made the potatoes extremely soury. The lambchops itself were decent but nothing to gloat over. My girlfriend ordered the Kotopoulo Souvlas, which was the lemon-oregano chicken roasted with spring onions & potatoes and she said the same thing: too soury. A bit too much lemony for our taste but others may think otherwise. Overall, I probably wouldn't be back unless friends were to come here for a birthday or something because I'm not too big of a fan of Greek food.\n\n***Parking***: Street parking/valet.\n\nCash/Credit accepted here.", "author": "Johnny G."}

It's definitely too heavy for lunch and based on the prices, I think it's a better deal for dinner because who can afford a $30+ lunch? I love combination of the greek and american cuisine. \n\nMy favorite app = Tzatziki dip + pita bread. The pita bread is so warm and yummy! The olive oil in the olives is perfect for dipping. I don't usually get impressed by fish because my mom (we're chinese) makes the perfect steamed fish, however, this place will not fail! I love the way they grill the fish. They're always fresh and I love the thin crispy skin. \n\nThe only down side is that it is an open kitchen and since a majority of their entrees are grilled, you leave the restaurant smelling like food.

The table was too big for conversation however, so we asked to be sat in a cozier spot and they were very accommodating and quick about it. \n\nMost of our party was vegetarian, which took the cost our our meal, wayy down. The only vegetarian dishes they have are the appetizers, much cheaper, easier to share. Here's what we got:\n\nKalamata Pita: Too salty, like a pizza on pita bread. (We were refunded for this, because the waiter agreed it was saltier than usual)\n\nSaghnaki: Again, was incredibly salty. Granted, it is a salty chese to begin with, but no amount of bread could make this pleasant on the taste buds. \n\nAginares Souvlaki: Grilled Eggplant and Artichoke Skewers served with yogurt, were delicious! \n\nChicken Souvlaki: Usually not available for dinner, but they had it last night. My friends raved about the meat. \n\nGigantes: Oven baked giant beans. Not impressive. \n\nHouse made pita: thick, with a great consistency, but again too salty for my taste. \n\nI also had a glass of their Malbec ($9) and it was really great. \n\nSince it was my birthday celebration, they brought out a slice of their flourless chocolate cake for me, and it was probably the best thing we ate at Kokkari.

We went here for lunch. \n\nI'm totally glad we went here and was worth the money. \n\nThe main dinning area upon entering has a nice old design. Chairs are huge (each one seemed different) and reminded me of the chairs you see in movies where an old guy is sitting at a fireplace reading. The whole restaurant has a old feel to it, which I enjoy  (absolutely love stuff that is designed based on the past). \n\nWe were guided in the back of the restaurant which is had more traditional seating + layout. The chefs cook out in the open so you can actually see them cook your meal (if you want to stand there and stare at them I guess). \n\nOur waiter was very attentive and great to talk to. He loved everything though, which made choosing difficult! \n\nFor starters, we got the grilled octopus and it was awesome. Very soft and juicy on the inside with a slight crunch on the outside (it wasn't crispy but it wasn't simply soft which I loved). For entrees, we ended up getting the Ravioli and Moussaka. The Ravioli was very light and I would recommend it to anyone who isn't looking to feel like death after eating. It tasted great, but the portions were very small (three pieces of ravioli) The Moussaka though was AMAZING. Lamb, yogurt sauce, and eggplant = win! Everything just mixed so well and it was a treat to eat. \n\nOur tab came out to be $53 (before tip). \n\nThis is another place on my list of places to visit whenever I am in SF (the other place on that list is soto mare so check that place out if you can)!", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

The duck was extremely fatty with no real wow factor. The lamb had a gaminess to it that I didn't care for... For dessert the waiter mistaken our order of the baklava ice cream for a Kokkari Sundae (vanilla ice cream, chocolate fudge, and peanuts... really???), but ended up giving us both desserts comp'd once we brought it up.\n\nOverall extremely underwhelming.

I am very happy to say my bf and I will be returning to this restaurant soon and often. \n\nWe found this place on yelp when we were looking for a place to go for a nice evening, and this seemed to be the perfect fit. Made reservations the day before. Last night we walked in right on time, we were immediately seated, and had our coats checked. We were greeted by our server (pretty sure her name was Kate, even tried to bring home the receipt to remember and still forgot it... sorry!). Very pleasant, and when we told her it was our first time she took the time to explain a few of her favorite dishes and why. We also asked for some input on our wine selection, which she was very patient and knowledgeable about. \n\nWe started with two appetizers, the lamb riblets and octopus. The lamb arrived first, and we both just smiled after taking the first bite. Perfectly seasoned, deliciousness. Shortly after our octopus arrived, which I about died over. I couldn't wait for our entrees! \n\nBefore I knew it there was a delicate looking roasted chicken with sweet potatoes in front of me (the pace was by no means fast, but we never had to wait long for the next course). The chicken was roasted perfectly, and I barely needed a knife to cut it. It fell off the bones without being too greasy (I hate that!). He had the Halibut which I stole a small bite of, also cooked perfectly. I was so enjoyable to eat food that I didn't feel weighted down or the normal \"food coma\" after. So often nice restaurants cause this for me because of the excess of oils and butter, no issue of this from here! \n\nDuring the meal neither my bf's or my wine or water glasses were ever empty and the table was cleared promptly. He decided to get the Frappe Greek Coffee which was a great final touch to the meal. \n\nBeyond our server and the hosts we interacted with being nicer than I can begin to give them credit for, when I got up to use the restroom, I asked a gentleman to point me in the direction. He guided me through the restaurant to where I needed to go! No pointing here! As we walked he displayed some great dining options for larger parties. It was amazing! \n\nKokkari Estiatorio exceeded my beyond picky expectations and made an evening for my bf and I to remember.

So I make a reservation for one night and head over for a casual evening near the waterfront.  This joint is located right next to 5A5 and the location itself is nice along with the actual restaurant d\u00e9cor. The restaurant is spacious and has a view into the kitchen. The servers were very attentive and very friendly with even a manager coming over at one point to check and make sure that we had everything we needed. \n\nThe menu and the vino list are very solid which I appreciated. We got a nice Pinot Noir and the servers were very helpful in choosing out a vino. We were not fully hungry so we decided to order two appetizers and one entr\u00e9e to split. We asked what was delicious and were recommended to order the grilled calamari and were told that there special that night which was the duck meatballs were better than the lamb ones so we should go for that. We then decided to split the lamb chops for our meal. The grilled calamari comes out first and it is stuffed with feta but for me the flavor was a bit overwhelming and it felt that they were trying to put too much feta into the actual calamari. The calamari was also a bit unevenly grilled so it had different tastes depending on which bite you got which seemed strange. The duck meatballs came out and the duck meat itself was delicious but there was too much breading surrounding the meatball itself which detracted from the flavor itself so this was a bit of a miss for me as well. I was semi disappointed by these two appetizers and was concerned about the main entr\u00e9e after eating these two. The lamb chops come out and these were just as awesome as everyone talks about. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly and delicious.

The moment we walked in we were greeted with a warm room that looked like someone's beautiful living room converted into a dining space with a nice bar, couches, and a fireplace with a spit roasting lamb and chicken. The smell of the food plus the spices was incredibly inviting.\n\nWe didn't think to make reservations on a Tuesday but it was packed so we were told we could wait to see if there was a cancellation or sit at the bar. After waiting for maybe five minutes someone came over and said they could separate a large \"family\" table so we could dine. We were very grateful. \n\nOnce we were seated our waiter came by and was friendly and knowledgeable. My boyfriend ordered the Mythos beer which was fabulous and we started out with the kalamari appetizer stuffed with olives, fennel and feta - amazing. \n\nWe both decided we had to have lamb being at a greek restaurant so he got the lamb shank and I got the lamb special. His practically melted in our mouths it was so good and he cleaned his plate. My lamb was much simpler - it felt like it was something you could totally make on your own (in a good way) - but was still delicious. We finished with some coffee and baklava (also delicious)\n\nThe service was accommodating, the environment got an A+ and the food was mouthwatering.

I give it five stars for a warm, comfortable atmosphere and overall ambiance. We had the best time, and I am willing to say it was my favorite evening while in the Bay Area for several days. \n\nOur server was the best. He was knowledgeable, witty, patient, and attentive all around. I was the only Kokkari first-timer of our group; this place was chosen based on everyone else's previous experiences. \n\nThe menu offered several appetizing options, and I was super hungry, so it was difficult for me to narrow it down. Three of us ordered the rotisserie special for the evening, Napa Spring lamb. One person ordered lamb chops. We all shared several delicious appetizers:  flaming cheese, grilled calamari, and dolmathes. All superb. \n\nThe lamb was all delicious. My only complaint was the tiny portion of edible meat. From my expensive Napa special, I had about seven bites. I was still hungry. We informed the waiter who then informed the manager. They offered more food, which was nice, but we just wanted them to know it wasn't enough deliciousness!!!  \n\nDesserts included a berry tarte with ice cream, a custard with burnt/brandied peach, and a mountain of berries. I did not eat these, but the others in my party said they were superb as well. \n\nWhile I only visit SF once a year, I hope to someday return to Kokkari.

Our waiter pannick at the mere site of her and began to rush us through ordering. He spoke very quickly. All the while our daughter sat their quietly while other patrons and waiters smiled at her. Every now and then she threw the menu around, but what child doesn't and enjoyed the bread. We were treated warmly and kindly from everyone else, but our waiter. It was not our child making people feel uncomfortable, it was the waiter. His comments were so obnoxious \"you may want to order your drink now\" \"You definitely will need the glass of champagne\" etc, etc while our daughter again sat their quietly and just stared. \n\nThe main reason I am writing this is because I could never be okay with anyone speaking loudly and making comments directly to my child, while patting her head and arm!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-02", "description": "Now there is something about the ambiance of this place that just makes it exquisite.  I don't know if it's the patterned chairs with cushioned high backings or impeccable service that just makes you feel truly adored by your servers or the fact that I saw Diane Feinstein dining a couple tables away.  \n\nI was on a business luncheon and was worried I'd be stuck with one gigantic plate of the same food.  However I can thank my stars that everyone wanted to share starters!  So we asked what the favorites were and voila:\n\nWatermelon & Feta - What a refreshing combination!  I don't know how they serve this year long (or do they) since watermelons aren't in season all year.  Knowing that fruit and cheese typically go well with each other, who knew this odd couple would work out?  Oh but it did!  And it brought in pine nuts and basil to the family too.\n\nZucchini Cakes - Ironically enough I had recreated Ina Garten's zucchini cakes the week before and this outshined mine completely.  It's fluffy and it tastes very versatile with the other squash that's thrown in.  I couldn't help but keep loading blobs of the mint yogurt dressing because it tastes delicious and it doesn't feel heavy or fattening.\n\nGrilled Meatballs with spiced tomato sauce & Greek yogurt - I was expecting an Italian meatball - thick and hearty - but this was ground meat patted together by children.  Without the compactness means you won't feel as weighed down.  It does have that cinnamon kick to it though.\n\nTzatziki, Favosalata or Tirosalata with housemade grilled pita - What the hell is all this mumbo jumbo you ask?  Tzatziki = yogurt / Favosalata = yellow split peas with red onion and capers / Tirosalata = feta dip.  ALL EXCELLENT.  I would skip out on the first one next time just because I've had it before and try the other two on the menu (Melitzanosalata, Taramosalata).  The Tirosalata has a lovely kick of feta at the end.  I've never had feta in any form besides crumbly and it gave me a new appreciation for this cheese that's typically found in overly acidic-ly dressed salads.\n\nNow onto our only entr\u00e9e which we ordered in case there wasn't enough food but by at this point, we were all stuffed.\n\nSouvlaki Hirino (pork kebabs) - When asking what the special was, our waiter pointed to the fireplace and said \"it's right there\".  Unfortunately there was another tall waiter standing right in front of it but since I'm assuming cannibalism cannot be that widely proclaimed, he was probably referring to the pig on the spit behind.  I was busy eating from all the starters that I didn't get to eat this until it became room temperature.  I know that's not the primary reason for why the pork was a little tough and a little dry but I was a little disappointed.  I know not to order from \"specials\" because that's usually the ingredients in abundance and in dire riddance but he described it in the most beautiful words that I couldn't possibly order from anything else the regular lunch menu.\n\nPerhaps not entirely exquisite but they know how to woo you at Kokkari.", "author": "Shannon L."}

Kokkari has been on my list ever since I moved to SF four years ago. Greek is hands down my favorite cuisine and I could eat it all day every day.\n\nWhen we pulled up to Kokkari Friday night I was beside myself that we were finally going to get to try this incredible place. The restaurant was bustling with people when we went inside. We had a reservation for 9:45 and were seated right away. Our wonderful waiter came over to greet us with a bottle of champagne that my best friend had ordered for us ahead of time. As he opened the champagne, he offered a wide variety of recommendations with regard to the small plates as well as the entres.\n\nBefore I list everything we ordered I must say that we ordered way too much food for two people but everything was spectacular and I would not have had it any other way. To start we ordered several small plates to share- the Aginares Souvlaki (grilled artichoke & eggplant skewers), Octapodaki tou Yiorgou (grilled octopus), Soutzoukakia (grilled lamb meatballs), and the Tirosalata with housemade grilled pita. Everything was so good. The eggplant was out of this world and the Tirosalata was so unique and flavorful, I could have made a meal off of it. For our entrees, I ordered the traditional grilled whole fish (sole) and the bf had the lamb chops. Both were super flavorful and seasoned perfectly.\n\nWith full bellies, we decided it was best to split a dessert, which we didn't need but decided, hey, we're celebrating so why not?! RIght?! Right. We settled on the Galaktoboureko which was the perfect ending to such a delicious meal. When our waiter brought it out to us, there was a candle in it and 'happy birthday Emily' written in chocolate.

Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy my meal, it just wasn't one of the more noteworthy I've had in SF. \n\nI should start by saying that the service was excellent. We were promptly seated and the waitstaff was attentive and patient throughout the entire meal. All of our dishes arrived quickly (but not too quickly, allowing us enough time between each course so that we did not feel rushed). Our server helped us select some of the most popular/raved about dishes. 4 stars for the service.\n\nWhen it came to the food I just didn't quite get the wow factor.For appetizers we had  the octopus, zucchini fritters and saganaki, a fried cheese dish. The octopus was tough/rubbery and a little burnt tasting. Then came the zucchini fritters, which were tasty but hardly memorable. The highlight was the saganaki. (I mean, how can you go wrong with fried cheese?) For my main I had the mousakka, and it was good but not by any means a standout. Maybe I'm being too picky, but I just left feeling like Kokkari should have made more of an impression.\n\nI will definitely go back.

It took longer, and, despite the lack of bar stools available,  was fairly painless.  We were not the only ones standing.  The crowd was extremely high end and chic (younger women dressed in sequin dresses and older ladies who lunch dressed in Chanel).  One of my new lady who lunches (dinners?) friend and I commented on the muffler-less Lamborghini self-parking by the window rather than using valet.  Bartenders made sure that the bar-standers glasses of wine were filled.\n\nThe center piece of the bar area, which is also the front dining room, is a fireplace with a spit, roasting the special of the night.  To my surprise Friday's special was peking duck---- wow, thought the Greeks stuck to lamb.\n\nMy date and I did eat the lamb--- the lamb riblet meze (appetizer).  Delicious.  Slightly smaller than lamb chops and oh so cute.   We also picked out 3 spreads--- taramosalata, favosalata, and tirosalata--- all of which were fantastically displayed on a platter alongside olives, capers, pickled vegetables, stuffed grape leaves and the thickest pita bread I have ever encountered.

For entree's we shared the Moussaka and the Souvla Tis Emeras, which I believe was roasted pork shoulder and belly.  The pork belly was good, but the shoulder section was on the dry side and lacked flavor.  As for the Moussaka, it was a strange dish, and while I can't say it was good, I kept eating it -- I did, however, need to add salt to get the flavors to pop more.\n\nBesides the best company I could wish for, the highlight of the night was the birthday ice cream.  They make it in-house and I really enjoyed it.\n\nI want to try the Kokinisto me Manestra and Mosharisia Brizola next time, but we ordered this time based off Yelp tips and pictures.

I went here last Monday for an anniversary dinner and was moderately impressed.  If I could give half stars this place would probably be 3.5.  I'm from Chicago where we have a greek town and lots of good authentic food.  Sure this is a more upscale/high end restaurant, but the food was traditional like your family style greek restaurants yet not better and twice the price.\n\nThe good:\n-We enjoyed the zucchini cakes, lightly battered and good veggie taste.\n-Arnisia Paidakia was the highlight of the meal, medium rare and very succulent.  I'm not a huge lamb fan, but this was delicious and something I would order again.\n -Ambiance in the restaurant was nice, well staffed, well decorated, surprisingly HUGE dining area.  \n\nThe bad:\n-Took 40 minutes after we were seated to take our order.  Up until that time we had been given wine and bread and that's about it.  On a busy Friday/Saturday night I could understand, but for a Monday, it's not terribly impressive service time.\n-Saghanaki was really salty and greasy, I've had much better elsewhere.  For such a simple dish I'd hope you would nail it as it is a very common traditional dish.\n-Garides sto Furno, definitely avoid.  Prawns were overcooked, tomato sauce was just average.\n\nOverall, we had an enjoyable meal, we weren't in a rush so the service did not bother us.  I thought it was a beautifully outfitted restaurant with potential, but the food was underwhelming considering all the high praise/reviews.  I probably would not go back here again.", "author": "Andrew M."}

(It was the sentiment I got from dining at \"haute\" Mexican Cuisine which btw was a disaster)\n\nKokkari put my worries to rest in such a big way that I almost felt ashamed for doubting it altogether.\n\nThe interior reminded me of a dressed up version of a hunting lodge, the high wooden beams contrasting nicely with the white table cloth. \n\nThe service was flawless. It's a challenge for any establishment to handle a party of 10 adequately, but the staff at Kokkari did so while maintaining an ingratiating spirit and a smile on their faces.\n\nThis ain't your typical \"pita pit\", and this was where I was \"wowed\" the most. \n\nI thought I had a pretty good grasp on Greek food so I was shocked to see the zucchini cakes, fried cheese, beef tongue, grilled fish on the menu (among others). We decided to order family-style so everyone could get a taste of everything (which I HIGHLY recommend if you decide to go). \n\nEach dish was perfectly prepared and elegantly constructed highlighting the freshness of each of the main ingredients so flawlessly the only reason I stopped eating was bc of the horrible noise produced by my gut straining against my Jeans.\n\nWhether it's a business dinner or just a night out, Kokkari's definitely got the goods to make you say Ooohhhh!", "author": "Kevin T."}

On the bottom was shredded baklava pastry topped with what tasted like lime custard or meringue, then layered on top of that was whipped creme fraiche, it sat on simple syrup and was surrounded by \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate syrup. It was delicious to say the least. It's not on the menu but you can request it! Definitely recommend it. \n\nThe prices are very reasonable for a restaurant of that status. The servings of food are pretty large too.

So after much hype on yelp, I'd have to agree with the ratings - it's an absolute must visit if you're in the area. This Miami girl will be coming back and recommending to others!

Even if you are Greek, but  w/o a reservation and not an owner's family member - you will be waiting at the bar to be seated, like a poor distant relative, possibly for a long time.\n\nViktia's favorite dishes: \n- Octopus appetizer (get in ether form, salad or just grilled octipus chunks) - always fresh, plump and delish\n- Main: whole-grilled fish with greens, order fish dry, w/o butter - tasty dinner option in case I watch my calories (luckily in Kokkari it comes without sacrificing my dining experience)\n- Mains option-2 is all things LAMB: chops, souvlaki (aka kebab), moussaka - all fantastic. I would only stay away from the lamb rotisserie - very fatty.\n- Dessert: filo with semolina custard (tube-shaped pastry filled with delicious custard, comes with a scoop of ice-cream. Kokkari used to have this MIND-BLOWING home-made baklava ice-cream (vanilla base with droplets of honey and baklava) that I highly suggest to get with your Filo instead of the plain vanilla. \nI pray baklava ice-cream will be back soon. \n \nFYI i hate writing essays and such...

She was polite, friendly and extremely knowledgeable, helping us through the maze of Greek words in the menu to make the best choices.\n\nThe food wasn't the perfect match for my palate, but it was undeniably high-quality and well-done. The spanakotiropita was a bit heavy on the cheese and light on the spinach, but my boyfriend liked the lamb meatballs and we both enjoyed our rather interesting entree: the daily rotisserie, a \"Peking\" duck (or, as our server described it, the Greek interpretation). While it wasn't much like real Peking duck, it was still quite tasty.\n\nTo top it all off, they actually comped the baklava we ordered for dessert and wrote \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate in beautiful chocolate script!

One of my favorite places ever is Komi in DC (http://www.yelp.com/biz/komi-washington?hrid=30O_JU9RW_LERhLBEGSQjg), where chef Johnny Monis serves up an incredible Mediterranean-inspired meal.\n\nKokkari, though, just... missed the mark for me. We got there, were seated on time, and ordered:\n\n+Spanakotiropita: the phyllo pies filled with spinach, feta, leeks and dill. The best part of the night; absolutely delicious.\n+Gigantes: giant beans oven baked in a tomato sauce with olive oil and herbed feta. Tasty, but a bit undercooked and had a bite to it.\n+Zucchini cakes: fried disks of zucchini, served with a cucumber and mint yogurt dressing. Very filling and just OK. I kept adding salt to it as it tasted under-seasoned.\n+Arnisia Paidakia: \"the best lamb chops\" of your life\" our server warned us. Grilled with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette and served with steak potatoes. It was good (I'm not a fan of lamb), but it was good. The potatoes were Sour with a capital \"s\" from the lemon vinaigrette and the extra lemon they include as a garnish.\n+Rizogalo: sickly sweet rice pudding served with honey and raisins. The pudding itself was good, but the added raisins and honey made it over-the-top sweet. \"Ouch,\" say my teeth.\n+Ouzo sorbet: touted as \"strawberry & ouzo sorbet,\" I'd mistakenly assumed it was strawberry and ouzo, not strawberry-ouzo. Our server asked us if I'd had ouzo before (I had), and proceeded to bring us a shot each of the anise-flavored spirit. With a hearty \"yiamas!\" we drank it down in one gulp. (Don't do that; bad idea, warning: bad idea.) I felt immediately nauseated and tried to \"chase\" it with the sorbet, only to be reminded that it also had a generous ouzo flavor. Oops. ...Opa?\n\nI'm glad I visited Kokkari to understand the hype. The food was good, the service was excellent, but it's definitely not enough to entice me to return. I'm sure no one'll be crying into their moussaka over that, as the restaurant seems to be doing really well.", "author": "Adena B."}

Not a ton of rice which worked out perfect for the soup.  The temperature wasn't piping hot either when it came out, so it made for quicker consumption.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-01", "description": "Good not great.  \n\nKokkari has some really good things going for it.  Its beautiful physical space gives off a warm glow that is comforting.  My first impression upon stepping inside was that I was transported to a nice restaurant in NYC.  The small plates/apps stood out as the best items, worthy of a repeat visit paired with wine (lamb meatballs, oven roasted/wood fired octopus, watermelon feta salad, and fried zucchini cakes).  There isn't anything incredibly difficult in what they produce so the consistency is definitely there.  I can see why this place is so popular with the locales.\n\nThe downside to Kokkari was also noticeable as they definitely could use some polish.  Due to a combo of the simple preparation of the starter dishes we started our meal with, along with the servers choice, we had 4 dishes brought out in a span of 5 minutes  Not one, but all.  I laugh at myself writing this because ordinarily this isn't a problem.  But when you set aside 2 + hours for a birthday dinner, it just comes across as rushed and amateurish.  Another problem I foresee others having is going into their meal thinking the entrees are going to varied and executed with anything special.  Look at their entrees: protein and potatoes.  Not one or two, but literally all of them.  While I love lamb chops/steaks, I can make that at home in equal to are greater consistency.  Throw me a sauce or something to make it worth spending twice what it would cost me to make at home.  Lastly, don't stray from the tried and true Lamb, beef or sometimes fish protein entrees.  We ordered a slow roasted rotisserie duck (Peking) and it sucked ass.  (I don't know what the hell I was thinking but our server was convincing and I'm a sucker for roast duck.)  The duck tasted like it had been cooked earlier in the day and then reheated for plating.  It was super dry and difficult to eat.  I even asked the server for a sharper knife just so I could cut through the meat.  I doubt they would have served the meat had they simply tried it before plating.  Argh.  So disappointing.    \n\nIn summary, I won't be coming back for entrees.  Just drinks, apps and perhaps a bite of some other sucker's over cooked meat.", "author": "Darin E."}

There was nothing terribly innovative about the menu, biggest disappointment perhaps, just standard Greek plates served in a fancy rustic setting. \n\nThe winner of the night for me was the grilled octopus appetizer., hands down. It kind of went downhill from there, we had some zucchini cakes and some beets, which were fine. I ordered the grilled lamb which was really raw and not to my liking, and my fiance ordered the Branzino and that was a bit of a disappointment--usually fresh whole fish is the best thing on the menu in typical Greek joints, but here it was far too bland.\n\nAgain, I wouldn't say no if someone suggested this as a dinner option, but I wouldn't jump at the chance to eat here again.", "author": "Minorwhite D."}

Smelts are these little fishies, and they were fried, so they were eaten like french fries.  I don't know what garlic-potato skordalia is, but it was damn good.

Here is the feedback and why it got 3 (would do 3.5) rather than 5:\n\n - Reservations: called same day, rude, no availability. Went on Open Table, no problem - booked.\n - Check-in: hostess said table was almost ready. She sat at least 5 other parties also of 2 that arrived AFTER me with and without their full parties. Waited 15 minutes to be seated.\n - Waitress: pleasant\n - Servers: the servers were literally dropping the plates on the table (meatball sauce on table cloth, at least not on us)\n - Food: mostly delicious! Meatballs, zucchini cakes, squash (a tad stringy), greek salad (generous but bland and 80% cucumbers, 2% onion, 12% tomatoes and 6% feta - needed lots of extra salt, oil...lemon and more herbs would have been nice).\n- Dessert: best part of meal. It was friend's birthday and I made a note on the reservation. They served it beautifully with candle and chocolate writing on plate but still charged full price for it. That's probably normal at an expensive restaurant like this.\n\nWill go back again but hope for a slightly better experience.", "author": "VeryBerry F."}

We ordered the grilled octopus, calamari, kalamata pita and the Saghanaki. All of which were delicious. I was particularly fond of the Pita and grilled Calamari which had so much flavor. \n\nAll of the girls dined on the Lamb Chops for their entree and I ordered the Sole which I had filleted in the back. Everything was full of fresh flavor and just melted in your mouth. \n\nThe desserts were divine and we ordered a selection of goodies, most of them were specials and all were light and airy. I stayed clear of the chocolate, but the girls seemed to really enjoy it. \n\nFinished with a cappucino and greek coffee. I would enjoy coming here for just drinks and appetizers. Everything was worth sharing, we definitely created our own tasting menu and it was a lovely experience.\n\nI appreciate the hard work that goes into a dinner service and the chef and his cooks should all be complimented!

When in Athens...It was tender and delicious and I can't wait to eat my leftovers for lunch today!\n\nDesserts: \nWe had the baklava with the ice cream and the special dessert that was filo dough dipped in baklava syrup topped with cream and pistachios.

We were offered a booth or a table and chose a table.  \n\nThe ambiance is so homey we felt like we were in someone's home.\nThe interior is huge but not cavernous.  We didn't realize how large it was till we used the bathrooms in the basement of the restaurant.\nOne of the servers actually escorted me through the maze of tables to the elevator which led to the bathrooms.  She was so sweet and this kind gesture made me love Kokkari more than ever.\n\nOur appetizers were all excellent.  Every dish was perfect and so flavorful.  At first I thought we couldn't make a meal from the starter plates.  The portions are not huge but we were happily stuffed sharing the 5 or 6 appetizers and the bowl of lemon rice soup.  I agree with Toni that it could have been more lemony.  But it still was tasty.\n\nI lost count of the number of times our glasses were refilled with water and ice tea or lemonade.  Our bread was replenished too.  All in all the service was excellent. Our server checked back with us several times to see how we were doing and if we needed anything.\n\nAt the end of the meal the manager came to our table to see how we were doing.  And before I forget when we first arrived a couple with a 3 or 4 year old son entered  The Maitre 'd took the kid's hand and asked how he was doing as he led them to their table.  A very sweet and genuine touch.\n\nI loved the fact that the staff treated us so well even though we didn't order wine or entrees.  (Some places treat you like dirt when you don't order wine).  \n\nDespite Michael Bauer's sour review yesterday we had an A+ experience and thoroughly enjoyed EVERYTHING about Kokkari--\na truly perfect time!

On Wednesday evening a special team gathered in the private room below, and embarked on a meal that paid rightful tribute to a great man.\n\nThe private room, dimly lit, could be the venue for a gathering of the dons. A long weathered wood table draws you in, and the complimentary olives wet the appetite.\n\nStarters that stood out were the grilled octopus with lemon and my personal favorite, the crispy smelts with garlic-potato skordalia. The deep fried smelts encased a straight from the sea essence that decorated each bite.\n\nCrispy zucchini cakes paraded up and down the table and left a typically loud crowd in silence.\n\nFor the main, it was the braised lamb shank with orzo and myzithra cheese. In my life, I have never seen protein like this. Brittle to the touch, tender in texture, and hit flavor pound for pound like a heavy weight.\n\nSeasoned and braised for a tenured period, the shank was infused with an aromatic tip that smoked through your veins. There could be no other way to enjoy lamb.\n\nDessert was a circus, accompanied by a breakout karaoke session ( it happens with enough vino ) but the star would be the sundae. Chocolate and vanilla ice cream with hot fudge. Reminiscent of a Fenton's classic, if you thought you didn't have enough room, you'd make some for this.\n\nKokkari is a wonder.

The hosts can be a bit snooty but once seated, it becomes a non-issue. Ambiance is cozy with a large roaring fire in a stone fireplace. The front room is dim and reminds me of a library or den in a men's club with settees and stuffed chairs. The back room is brighter. It has the more traditional restaurant set up of tables and chairs. It features a view of the open kitchen and meat roasting over a wood fire.\n\nAs for the food, start with the Melitzanosalata, Taramosalata, Tzatziki, Favosalata and Tirosalata dips served with house made grilled pita. This pita is nothing like grocery store bought pita. This pita is soft, warm and fluffy. My friends and I are usually generous and pile on the dip but we always seem to run out of pita before we run out of the dips. We just order more pita. Not a hardship, except on my waistline. LOL.\n\nI also like the grilled octopus. I enjoy the chewiness of the octopus but other people may think it tough. I chow down on the fried smelt. Similar to Sasa's (Walnut Creek) fish fries but meatier. \n\nIt all comes down to personal preference. Speaking of which, I don't care for the taste and texture of grape leaves so I didn't care for the Dolmathes but others in my party enjoyed it. Ditto with the Saghanaki. Who wouldn't enjoy the gooey melted goodness of fried cheese? I guess do. I found it overly salty so 1 bite and I was guzzling water. Too bad because I like cheesy appetizers like cheese sticks and jalapeno poppers.\n\nFor entrees, you can't go wrong with anything lamb. I usually get the chops or the Souvlaki. Yum. For dessert, go for the baklava but beware, they're super sweet so share because a little bite will do. I also like decadent Sokolatina which is a flourless chocolate cake. For a lighter and more refreshing dessert, try the ouzo sorbet.", "author": "Cece E."}

He was so warm and helpful. We really felt comfy.\nAnd the food of course one word: AMAZING. We started with some traditional appetizers, with Uzo, we asked recommendation for all of them. And all of them were marvelous. For entree Engin recommended us that days specials; sea bream and lamb. We tasted both.\nAgain, the presentation is simple not showy, but appealing.

I don't think I've ever sat in chairs so comfortable before. I felt tiny, they were like small thrones. The fireplace and ambiance was warm, the wine delicious. \n\nMy soup arrived and I went into attack mode. Hearty enough to be my meal but I still partook in a side of potatoes which were confusingly flavorful for how simple they were. For the soup... was it the best ever? Well for me that's hard to say, there are many variations of a good lentil soup. But I promise you my friends, from one lentil lover to another the soup was both complex and savory, most definitely a contender for such honors.\n\nThis is the type of place that truly lets you relax while you dine. Bring a friend or two, get a bottle of wine, and just sink into the chairs of the main room. The servers are attentive to your needs, specifically mine of the vegan variety, and should I wander the FiDi soon I would certainly have no qualms about testing that soup and it's attempt at greatness one more time.", "author": "Justin N."}

I had a really great experience-- delicious food, professional service,and lovely company. The server was personable, funny, and made us feel at home right from the start. Not much else I could ask for!\n\n- Crispy zucchini cakes ($8.75): Two perfectly crisp zucchini cakes. The zucchini is grated finely and mixed with cheese (feta?) and then fried. It also comes with a yogurt dipping sauce and pickled cucumbers.\n- Grilled octopus ($11.75): I was most afraid of this dish becoming rubbery or chewy, which can easily happen to octopus. It was not at all like that. Instead, it had a good bite to it and was very well-seasoned!\n- Grilled lamb riblets ($10.75): I think this was my favorite dish of the night. I've never had lamb that was so soft and tender-- the meat just fell off the bone. Delicious and a must!\n- Yogurt, eggplant, and feta cheese with jalapeno platter with pita bread ($18): Our server recommended these three, and my personal favorite was the jalapeno. It was good but not something I would recommend, and I actually also felt it was pricey for what we got. \n- Moussaka ($21): This was my first experience with moussaka and now for sure not my last!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-21", "description": "WOW. \n\nObviously a restaurant doesn't get a 4.5+ star average with almost 2000 reviews for no reason. So, let me breakdown my experience for those who are interested.\n\nFirst of all, for being in \"San Francisco,\" the location is fairly accessible. Not far from AT&T Park and just off the Embarcadero, even if you're coming from the east, you don't have to drive deep into SF, which everyone knows is a hassle. \n\nI've been here 3 times, twice for dinner and once for lunch. Every time the waitstaff has been unmatched. Kokkari obviously does a wonderful job selecting the staff. During lunch, we had a gentleman who was not only patient with our lack of wine-knowledge, but very courteously allowed us to try three (very expensive) wines, free of charge and explained approximately 10 wines from memory. His description of our Malbec was spot on for rookie wine drinkers. \n\nThe ambiance is stellar. With a large fire in the entry hall, often with lamb or other goodies being slow roasted over the fire and comfortable (and beautiful) seating. We had a reservation and requested to sit by the window, which the hostess gladly accommodated. \n\nI will say my lady and I are suckers for Greek food, but I don't think I am ultra-biased just because of that. The menu is not overwhelming, with enough options to find something you genuinely want to eat, but not extensively tedious. Each dish is obviously crafted as a piece of art, both in taste and presentation. From memory, I will say the zucchini cakes with greek yogurt sauce is one of the highlights. Twice we have ordered sand-ground greek espresso with our dessert. We first ordered it out of curiosity, the second time out of humor. This little coffee is a shot of speed and is recommended if you're driving a ways home! \n\nOverall, as a young guy who likes to take his girlfriend out for a nice dinner occasionally, Kokkari meets all the standards I have for romantic, tasty, accommodating experience that will not totally break the bank. I've eaten at some nice places, but this is easily one of my favorite 3 restaurants. \n\nCheers.", "author": "Andy F."}

The food was good to very good, but not the best Greek food that we have ever eaten.  We are spoiled, coming from the NY metro area. The wine list was weighted towards expensive bottles, but there were a few under $50.  Bread and olive oil were very good.   Appetizers were mostly excellent, including zucchini cakes,  spanakopita and lamb meatballs. The octopus was good.   The special appetizer of sunchokes was turgid. Entrees were more variable.  The lamb skewers were excellent.  Grilled branzino was very good, but inexpertly fileted.  I ordered the special of a grilled Berkshire pork chop.  The bone of the chop was extra long and was said to contain bacon.  The pork chop was good, the extra part was more like pork belly and was too fatty for me to enjoy.  The potatoes and side dishes were all very good.  \n\nWe really enjoyed the desserts.  The ice cream sundae was excellent.  We had another Greek dessert that was excellent too.  \n\nThis was, by far, the most expensive meal that we ate in SF.   The setting and service were good as any restaurant that we went to.

If its not covered in pork belly I'd probably just graze over it on the menu. But they were delicious. It only comes with 2 cakes so order enough for your party. Also ordered the calamari - juicy and liked the acidic sauce. For entrees, I ordered the snapper roasted and he ordered the lamb kabob.

Both were very large entrees so if you're small like me don't be ashamed to share!\n\nOur server was outstanding, can't even remember when I've had a better one. I used to serve before college so I know how hard it can be. But honestly I HATE it when servers are so friendly that its awkward/overbearing/annoying. Our server and my date and I shared a few laughs, but our server also gave us the perfect amount of space. (Really wish I remembered his name!) \n\nHis knowledge of the menu was very impressive (perfect accent), and recommended the great glasses of wine for each of our entrees. Described a fruity pino grigio that went wonderfully with the snapper, and my date said his wine pairing was his favorite part of the meal. \n\nAll in all, the food is simply prepared but delicious, the waitstaff is amazing, and the wine list is paired to a T.

I was hesitant to try a Greek restaurant at the request of my 25 year old son...but what a pleasant surprise. It's a beautiful bustling space with outstanding service. Do not expect your regular California cuisine, this is authentic Greek food with heavy sauces and whole fish entrees. Since there were ten of us, we were able to taste many of the selections. All three fish entrees were cooked perfectly as well as the Moussaka and lamb chops. To top off the meals, they has an \noutstanding wine list. Ask to be seated at Frank's table.

When he found out I was vegetarian, he basically told me there was no point in me being there.

Their food is always of superior quality and flavor and beautifully presented. The management and waitstaff are attentive and professional. \nWe went yesterday for my sister's special birthday. We had told them in advance that we were celebrating a special occasion and they acknowledged the event and congratulated my sister in an appropriate manner. Our server helped select a lovely bottle of sparkling wine. We felt like VIP guests for sure.\nNow for the food. Their bread is heavenly - crusty on the outside served with special olive oil that Kokkari curates from Athens. We ordered the baked feta which was delicious, rich and creamy. We had chopped salad with pine nuts and a delightful creamy feta dressing. My daughter ordered an octopus salad that was delicious and had the freshest, tastiest octopus we had ever had - slightly chewy as it should be. We also sampled the dolmathes which were stuffed with a savory lamb filling. My brother in law ordered the whole fish - fresh and juicy and beautifully presented. My other daughter and I split the roasted half chicken served with roasted potato wedges. The chicken was so flavorful and juicy and potatoes soft on the inside and slightly crisp on the outside. My sister ordered a greek salad which was lovely and just what she wanted.\nI want to offer another compliment to the entire staff as we also had in our group my one year old grandson. Normally, I would not think of Kokkari as a great place to take a little guy but he is generally pretty good in restaurants. We were greeted by management and staff in such a welcoming way. They told us how sweet and cute he is (which we all wanted to hear) but encouraged us to have a good time and not worry about what others thought. In the end, at least a half dozen other staff and management stopped by to congratulate my sister and fawn over my grandson. \n\nSo - we have been to Kokkari many times before and will continue frequenting this, one of our favorite restaurants.\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d353917-r358765212-Kokkari_Estiatorio-San_Francisco_California.html#", "author": "A W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-16", "description": "Woohoo - my very first Yelp Elite post!!! And I could not be happier about the restaurant it's for. \n\nKokkari...simply amazing. Two of my lovely co-workers and I decided to venture there for my pre-birthday, birthday dinner. I have heard many good things about Kokkari, and have even heard it compared to places like Aziza (which I personally love). But I knew that Aziza is a bit more on the Moroccon tip, whereas Kokkari is Greek . Very similar in style on some dishes, but I can assure you, they are both different creatures.\n\nWe showed up a bit early, but were met with a warm greeting by the hostess, and whisked away to our already waiting table. The ladies pre-arranged to have chilled Prosecco waiting for us, which was a nice touch to start the meal. \n\nBefore I get into the food - let's talk about Max. Max was our hilariously charming waiter. Max is a bit on the flamboyant side, but he really helped shape the night. Funny, knowledgeable, helpful, and always seemed to be at the table at the right times. If this is how the rest of the waitstaff is, I can see how they get such high praise. Management at Kokkari - if you're reading this - Max is great! Give that man a raise!\n\nNow the food. I'm a huge fan of simple foods executed to perfection. Maybe it's the Italian in me, I can't really say, but I'll take a well executed, simple dish, over some fancy fluff that doesn't deliver any day of the week. \n\nWe started with one of the special starters - Duck Dolmathes (dolmas) - these things were A-MA-ZING. I could have made an entire meal out them. No joke. \n\nSaganaki - Fried Greek cheese with lemon juice, greek oregano, and a little bit of pepper. I could seriously eat this once a day, every day. It's that good. My roomie introduced me to this dish last year, but the preparation at Kokkari is ace.\n\nKalamari - Calamari stuffed with Feta with some white beans and frisee. I'm not 100% sure what the dressing was, but wow - again, simple, and perfect. \n\nAll 3 of us decided to try different lamb dishes. I had the lamb chops (recommended by our new friend max), and the ladies had the Moussaka and Souvlaki. \n\nI didn't have the good sense to get tastes of what the ladies ordered, but let me tell you about those chops. Those deliciously sinful chops. *drool* \n\nDressed very simply with basically the same ingredients the Saganaki was, and paired with these roasted and fried (yes, roasted AND fried) potatoes. If I have a death row meal in my future, I could see these chops making it to the table. No joke. THAT good. And don't let the potatoes fool ya - they had a spice and texture that was perfection. Think \"the best wedge cut fries you can ever imagine\".  (I'm actually salivating thinking about this as I write...fwiw)\n\nWe paired the main courses with a nice, '04 Roda Reserva Rioja - and holy cow - silky, medium bodied, not over the top, but definitely NOT understated wine. \n\nMax also mentioned that he loved the Greek whites they had on the list, and was thoughtful enough to bring a taste of one by (which I am kicking myself for not getting the name of!). One taste resulted in me getting 3 glasses for the table - because who can ever have enough wine? Both ladies are not huge into whites, but seemed to agree it was delicious. \n\nAnd then we wrapped up the whole shebang with Baklava ice cream. yea...you heard that correctly - BAKLAVA IN ICE CREAM. I couldn't even finish the 3 small scoops it was so rich and sinful. I could see popping in there just for a cocktail/dessert wine pairing with the ice cream while on a date or something. \n\nThe waitstaff also conspired with my coworkers to do a really nice plate presentation with some cupcakes that the ladies got from Cako (a whole 'nother review is in order for those). They did a little ganache \"Happy birthday\" on the plate and presented the cupcakes nicely for us. A nice little touch to an amazing dinner. \n\nIf you like Greek food, and love simply made and perfectly executed cuisine, you really need to hustle your posterior on down to Kokkari. You'll be happy you did.", "author": "Marco M."}

I usually don't order octopus because the suction cups weird me out.  We tried it anyway since there were such good reviews on the dish.

The place was jam packed both nights, with great ambiance and fantastic service. \n\n\nThe first time we split:\n\n- Kolokithokeftethes (zucchini cakes appetizer) - Great.\n\n- Moussaka (lamb casserole entree) - I loved this dish. It was jam-packed with lamb. Very flavorful and rich. \n\n- Goat stew over orzo (off menu special entree) - We agreed this was the best dish of the night. It is a special that is still on the menu. Came recommended from our waiter. She was totally right - it was awesome. \n\n- Baklava - Perfect way to finish the meal. The filo is light and flaky. \n\n\nWe were dying to try more of the small plates, so we came back a few weeks later and ordered:\n\n- Pita with Melitzanosalata and Favosalata (small plate, some kind of eggplant spread and a hummus-like spread) - This was a great way to start. The pita was warm and grilled, both spreads were great. The hummus was on the sweet side, the eggplant more savory. Balanced perfectly.\n\n- Spanakotiropita (small plate, spinach and feta filo pies) - Again, the filo was perfectly flaky. It melted in my mouth. \n\n- Aginares Souvlaki (small plate, artichoke and eggplant skewer) - This was a generous sized skewer. Veggies were grilled perfectly. The veggie skewer went really well with the lamb skewer for dinner. \n\n- Arnisio Souvlaki (large plate, lamb skewer) - Five really good sized chunks of lamb. We asked for medium rare and my girlfriend thought they were slightly overcooked, but other than that they were delicious. The grilled onion and pepper that comes with it were also delicious.\n\n\nWe decided that sampling the small plates is definitely the way to go, since you get to try so many more things. \n\nEverything on the menu is incredible, you literally can't go wrong. The staff is constantly checking in to see if they can help with anything. On our way out, we were thanked by 5 different people, including waiters that hadn't even touched our table. The restaurant is warm, with giant comfy chairs, a nice fireplace with meat roasting on the spit, lots of wood. Can't say enough about this place!", "author": "Alden Q."}

They didn't rush us to get our order or anything; the waiter was very patient and even gave us a few recommendations.\n\nThe restaurant is also very nice. The decor is warm and inviting without pretension. The bar is hopping, and the restaurant is packed with people enjoying their food.\n\nThe problem is: the food isn't great. There's some good food, and some very mediocre. It's very inconsistent.\n\nSpanakotiropita - very flaky but lacking a little flavor\nSparaggia - I could make oven roasted asparagus like this at home\nSaghanaki - the cheese was very salty, but definitely tasty\nMakaronia - tasty pasta dish with equal amounts of vegetables\nArnisia Paidakia - the lamb was a tiny bit underdone, but still solid\n\nIf they pumped up the menu, I would have no hesitation giving this place 5 stars.

I have to say though - I had a similar experience to the post on 12/20, except I don't fit the profile they mention. There was a group of us, not together, hoping to get acknowledged by someone - anyone - we were waiting near the bar for a table, several groups of 2 and we all stood there looking quite foolish for 20 plus minutes trying to get anyone to offer us a drink, acknowledge our existence - though we all had our name on a wait list for a table. We were definitely invisible and chatted about it amongst ourselves - as strangers. It was not welcoming. I'm hoping it was because of the holidays and it's not typical.

In addition, service is excellent.  First time, we had reservations for 12 people.  As you know with large parties, people are flaky and others show up late.  Waiter told us that he was here to serve us and just went with the flow.  Next time, I went with my husband as a Plan B when our original dinner plans fell through.  Of course, we had no reservations.  The hostess was very gracious and put us on a waiting list and would let us know in about 15 minutes if there were any no shows on reservations.  15 minutes later, we were seated.  (if you want to dine here, make reservations in advance)  My husband is an extremely picky eater so we didn't order wine and only ordered a few small plates and dessert.  Typically, waiters are pretty bummed when they know the bill is low.  Not ours, when leaving, our waiter said he hoped to see us again in a real genuine tone.  And, on the way out, the hostess chatted with us and said she was glad we got in.  6 stars on service.  Typically busy restaurants can be snobby, not here.\n\nAs for the food, I've tried a lot of small plates.  My favorites were the fried zucchini cakes, grilled octopus, lamb riblets, lamb meatballs, lamb tongue (sounds horrible, but it's amazing), and baked cheese.  As for dessert, the semolina, flourless chocolate cake and sundae are amazing.  Seriously one of the best sundaes I've ever had.  Will definitely be back to try other items.", "author": "Shelly W."}

SF is a Mecca for fine dining and Kokkari ranks up there with the best of them. After being seated in the front of the restaurant you immediately take notice of the inviting atmosphere, warm decor with wood accents. The bar was rather small but was insignificant to the wide spread seating. This restaurant was mammoth. This restaurant took up the real-estate of a office building floor. Very unusual for SF.\nFor appetizers, ordered the meatballs and saganaki. Both were very tasty but the meatballs won for the apps. Maybe it's lackluster of classiness but the server did not pour the liquor on top the cheese and      perform the table side lighting. This took away from the dish as the cheese was already cold upon arrival. Not the same feel as warm melting cheese on top of fresh pita. \nMy entry was the lamb burger. Perfectly cooked ground lamb that was flavored well and with mint, onion and tomato. This was wrapped on freshly baked pita served with a splendid tzatziki sauce. The others in the party had the rotisserie of the day and moussaka. The rotisserie of the day was a 1/2 chicken slowly roasted in their brick ovens. The chicken was the most succulent chicken I've ever had in a restaurant. It fell right off the bone with barely a touch. The moussaka, which I've never had the pleasure to experience before, was also a tasty dish as well. This dish was a play on a traditional casserole but made up of ground lamb, potatoes, eggplant and lots of cheese. The spices were perfect for this dish and had a surprising flavor we guess was cinnamon. \nHard to pick a favorite as all dishes were exquisite and unique. I will be back to explore the menu further!", "author": "Megan G."}

We are both lovers of Greek food and were excited to try this place. Would definitely recommend making reservations earlier, especially if you're looking to have dinner on a weekend. Or you can try your luck like we did and wait for open seating at the bar, where you can still enjoy the full menu.\n\nWe came on a Saturday night without reservations, but found bar seating within 10 minutes. The atmosphere is slightly high-end, but still casual. We ordered the zucchini cakes, moussaka, lamp chops, and a dessert.\n\nThe zucchini cakes were delicious and were paired with a divine mint yogurt sauce, but still not something very special in my eyes. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly and had a great juiciness and sauce to it but were still overpriced for us. My moussaka was excellent and I would definitely recommend it. The lamb was spiced generously and everything else paired perfectly with it. I especially enjoyed the eggplant in it. Our dessert was called \"Galaktoboureko\"  and is listed as a \"semolina custard in filo with blood orange spoon sweet & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream.\" Ours came with pistachio ice cream which we loved much more than the pastry.\n\nOur dinner came out to about $80, so prepare to spend some moolah here. I loved the food though, and it was a great atmosphere. At one point two cooks came into the dining area, where a giant fire pit is located, to bring a huge spit of meat back to the kitchen.

Also try their zucchini cakes (mint yogurt dressing is SO good), roasted prawns and grilled octopus. You will be blown away and hungry for more. Grilled meatball is pretty mediocre so I'd pass. Their pita dip appetizer is also really good - great for bigger groups sharing appetizers and you can get more of their house-made grilled pita for just $1. For entrees, I usually go with their fish of the day, and you can never go wrong with any of them. It literally melts in your mouth. Ah, so good. \n\nDessert wasn't exactly my favorite.

Goat stew was flavorful and orzo had soaked up the goat juices and was delicious. Berkshire pork was tender and it came with pork rinds and bacon. \n\nWe also ordered the dessert:  Galaktoboureko - semolina custard in filo with sour cherry spoon sweet & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream.  Oh my goodness, this was really delicious - the custard was so creamy and smooth and wasn't too sweet. I'm not normally a fan of custard but this was divine!\n\nI will definitely come back to Kokkari to try their other dishes - I was eyeing the lamb shank at the table next to ours and is next on my list!", "author": "Nette T."}

Since it's a special and not regularly on the menu, there was no way of knowing if they're have it when we made the reservation. But we we still wanted to try out the menu, and I've been trying to explore different types of food.\n\nFirst off, this is a very nice place. Even in my collared shirt, I felt a little under dressed until I saw the guy in the not-so white t-shirt making it a little less white. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and our server (i forget her name) could possibly be the best I've ever had.\n\nFor appetizers we had the grilled calamari which was very good, the lamb riblets which were charred and dry, and the zucchini cakes which looked kinda dense, but were actually VERY light and had a nice flavor.\n\nThen I had the greek salad which I loved, and the couple at the table next to us couldn't stop staring at.\n\nThey actually had the goat stew, so that's what he had while I went for the Kotopoulo Souvlas which is a lemon and oregano roasted chicken with root vegetables. I'd saw the goat stew was the most flavorful thing of the night. I have nothing against goat, and nothing against stew, but I was still surprised how good that was. The chicken was cooked perfectly, though the vegetables were roasted a little longer than I would have preferred.\n\nAs for dessert, I was going to try the baklava which comes with ice cream, but I decide to kill two birds with one stone, and try the baklava ice cream insteam. VERY good stuff. I was expecting the baklava to be soggy, but it actually kept its consistency. They drizzled honey over the top, which made it a little sweeter than I would have preferred, but it was still good stuff!\n\nThe place is a little pricey, but definitely a place I would return to to try out some other things on the menu. If I could, I'd give it 4.5 stars, but since I can't...4 stars...", "author": "Damon G."}

It comes with 2 pieces, so we ordered the special of the night Duck Confit Dolmathes. Together these were the perfect starters. The Dolmathes weren't totally soaked in oil, so I was glad cause I prefer them not as oily. \n\nMain - I got the lamb chops with potatoes for my main and that was the best choice. I liked it better than the lamb shank, which comes with a tasty orzo. The chops had lemon on the side too which is good and a tradition I like.\n\nDessert - Baklava was pretty good with the ice cream scoop. Also got  a great tawny port.

The waiter brought out a dessert and said \"this is for you guys\" and the dessert had the words \"Congratulations\" on it.  We thought it was a free dessert because no one ordered it.  At the end of the meal, we realized we were charged $10 for the dessert.  \n- It is NOT ok to bring out a dessert and charge us for it.

I was taken here for a business lunch last week and wow - I loved it. Definitely caters to vegetarians with some very tasty dishes. And please keep in mind I normally eat my food without all the sauce on it, so if it's bland, I'll know. :)\n\nWe had a couple of appetizers - the zucchini cakes and that parmesan-tasting fried cheese goodness (I was like man, I have to SHARE?!).\n\nThen I had their peach salad with arugula and a light vinaigrette as my entree, since I figured the appetizers would fill me. So I'll admit I didn't hear this salad  described correctly (it was a special) and I thought it would be peaches garnishing the greens (like strawberries would) but NO - the peaches were sliced in thirds and arranged in the plate like a minibowl with the arugula on top, and feta, walnuts and the vinaigrette drizzled around. An initial alarm went through my head because, honestly, I'm not a huge peach fan either. But now I know what people mean by describing things as \"peachy\" -- because damn those were the absolute best peaches I'd ever had and I was marveling at the flavor and creativity behind putting this salad together. I'd go back just for that. \n\nJust a note of caution: if you plan on drinking heavily at a table that's situated closest to the door and are fiending for a bathroom inbetween shots, that sucker is waaaaay far away, and down a level.

There are two big dining rooms with ample space, and therefore not as crowded in as its sister restaurant, Evvia.  The front dining room had 2-seater tables with lush chairs that I was envious of.  We were seated in the back dining room, where you could watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen.  \n\nWe started off with the GRILLED OCTOPUS appetizer ($13).  A solid 4 stars, well-grilled and coated in a delicious olive oil/lemon sauce.  We sopped it all up with the bread... as unfortunately, we didn't get any olive oil with our bread (although all our other neighbors did).  \n\nFor our entrees, my husband went with the classically recommended LAMB CHOPS with Kokkari potatoes ($38).  Perfectly cooked to order - 5 stars.  Definitely top 5 lamb chops I've had.  I stole many bites off his place, as I was fairly disappointed in my selection.  \n\nI (unfortunately) went with the LOBSTER STEW special ($32), which I was debating against a lamb dish.  (Seeing as how my new year's resolution was to eat less meat, I figured I had to start it off by not getting lamb.)  The lobster stew was a tail of lobster (still in shell) on top of orzo cooked in a tomato sauce.  It was too watery, too sweet, and not of the caliber I'd expect for a dining establishment of Kokkari's caliber.  \n\nAs redemption, I ordered the much-hyped Dessert $9 - the Galaktoboureko, flaky crispy phyllo dough wrapped around tasty creme fraiche served with ice cream.\n\nService was 2.5 stars - slow.... Our waitress was friendly enough to start, but disappeared for long 20-30 minute spurts throughout the meal.  We waited 15 minutes for her to come by and pick up our credit card to run - and finally gave it to another waiter as she'd disappeared again.  \n\n$115 pre-tip, I'd expect better caliber service.

Lately we had been underwhelmed at many 'nice' dinners out as we are both really good cooks and can create pretty special meals at home. Makes it tough when you spend a pile of $ on something you could have done as well at home.  But Kokkari was a great experience from first dish to last.  First, though the place itself makes you feel grown up and cared for.  High celings, sturdy tables with high back upholstered chairs that are wonderfully comfy. Not too loud, huge fireplace roasting meat in clear view, a very good feel. The waiter seemed to have been there forever, knew the menu top to bottom, was attentive and funny as hell.\n\nThe food itself was outstanding.  Great sour dough (Acme I think) Deep fried fava beans were wonderful, but by the time you read this, they may not make them anymore as the waiter told us the beans are tender enough for this treatment for only a week or so. Zucchini cakes with a cucumber yogurt sauce was delicious, as were the lamb meatballs.  We split a special ravioli dish that with butternut squash....it was very good,  but not up to the appetizers. On a return, I think we'd just order all appetizers as the dip combo with pita looked amazing at the table next to us.  \n\nLastly, while we didn't want dessert, they brought us out a delicious sorbet with fruit and a creamy icy sauce somewhere between melting ice cream and creme fraiche.  \n\nJust a wonderful meal, excellent service and picked up a few things we will do at home, a perfect outcome.", "author": "Paul G."}

Italian often crowds out the higher end restaurant scene so it's nice to see their Greek neighbor get some market share.  The rarity of non-gyro Greek joints makes this place that much more special since many dishes expose you to a taste experience you may not have not had before in the States.\n\nArnisia Plevrakia: So flavorful for a cut often neglected by butchers!  Perfectly grilled lamb riblets on the outside with a partially well-done and partially medium-rare meat portion inside.  The fresh oregano is a cool twist since I so rarely get served fresh oregano.\n\nOctapodaki tou Yiorgou: A pretty bland mollusk to start with, but the wood fired grill makes all the difference.  All those suction cups on the tentacles become crispy which contrasts the chewiness of the main meat portion.\n\nArnisia Paidakia: The portion near the bone was reminiscent of the riblets, but the main lamb chop had a good fatty tenderness to it.  The potato wedges tasted like they had some rotisserie fat drippings on top, perhaps more roasted than deep fried.  What a nice chop!\n\nKounelaki sta Karvouna: The whole rabbit was probably on that metal skewer.  Some pieces were great with well marinated skin and juicy meat while others were mostly bone.  The savory orzo with yogurt sauce was great, loved the sour contrast of the yogurt topping!\n\nMeyer Lemon Curd Filo: It's great when a Greek Taverna can innovate on classics.  Wrap filo around curd from the local Meyer lemon and top with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream!  The curd was so awesome by itself and was simply amazing enrobed in crispy filo.\n\nSketo Greek Coffee: Bitter... like so many of my friends.  What I'd expect from Greek coffee.

Kokkari's for sure. Hands down, the best Greek meal I've had outside of Greece.\n\nThere I was on a business trip taking time for dinner with an old girlfriend. (And here's a shoutout to my darling, gorgeous wife who told me to go have fun . . . (but not too much):). \n\nKokkari's turned out to be just the right place. Perhaps a little too white and yuppy to make the place feel like a down home slice of the Bay area, but nonetheless, tre stylish and serving excellent food and wine.\n\nFirst thing that surprised me about the place: Hard to get an early (6 p.m.) table on a Monday night. Whoa. Whazzup with that? This place doesn't have a \"Danko\" or \"Keller\" stuck anywhere in the name. Guess I'm just a country boy who thought one could walk into almost any place at that ridiculously early hour and find a table.\n\nOnce we grabbed the last (and only?) bar table, kindly dressed in a white tablecloth as a nice touch, we started in on the treats.  Folks are right, the crispy zucchini cakes (Kolokithokeftethes) are winners. Lightly fried with a delicate breading, they go perfectly with the cucumber and mint yogurt sauce that dresses them.\n\nWe chose a Metoxi wine (from a blend of cab and limnio grapes) out of the Tsantalis winery on Mr. Athos. It was called a \"monastic wine,\" and I think that was because it was a little piece of heaven: Had the depth of cabernet sauvignon but the velvety sparkle of a limnio.\n\nFor dinner I had their signature lamb chops (Arnisia Paidakia) with lemon oregano vinaigarette and really tasty pan fried potato wedges. Perfectly cooked and as good as any lamb I've ever had. My friend had Psari Psito, a grilled whole fish with  braised greens, lemon & Cretan olive oil. Both were excellent.\n\nFor dessert we took the lead of the extremely efficient and professional server who recommended Galaktoboureko, made special by sweetened Meyer lemon strips and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream.  I finished the meal off with an excellent cup of Greek coffee. And the whole thing, for what we got, was not unreasonably priced.\n\nSo here's my advice. Call well ahead for a reservation.

We started of with Melitzanosalata, Taramosalata, Tzatziki, Favosalata Or Elaiosalata with housemade grilled pita. Tzatziki sauce was nice but the best was their brown hummus like paste. Dolmathes grape leaves stuffed with rice, dill & mint was the best too. It was a perfect blend of taste and seasoning. Spanakotiropita traditional filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill was nicely done too! Hot, crispy, flaky skin and a very nice, simple seasoned inner goodness. Zucchini Cakes with cucumber & mint yogurt dressing was really, really delish! It was shaped like a crab cake, and on top it has white yogurt sauce and more small slices of cucumber, a very nice touch. Grilled Octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil was not as good as I expected. I do like the charcoal grill taste of the outside but it was not as crunchy and the temperature was cold. Grilled Meatballs spiced tomato sauce & greek yogurt was not bad but not spectacular either. Greek Salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, red onion, feta, oregano & olives was not good at all. It was really different than what we had in Greece. Whole Fish traditionally grilled with braised greens, lemon & cretan olive oil was done very well! The outer skin was a bit crispy and the inside was tender, melt in your mouth sensation. It has a simple wrapped lemon with ribbon that you can squish, excellent! Chicken Souvlaki yogurt marinated chicken skewer with peppers, onion with romaine salad tzatziki & pita had chicken breast. Although I loved the charcoal taste, I don't think it was as tender as I typically find in like Indonesian chicken satay for example. Grilled Lamb Chops with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & kokkari potatoes was ok. Wild green and oven roasted asparagus was just ok. Even though it was perfectly pink, it still was a bit tough. The sea salt seasoning was perfect tho! The potatoes was big steak cut potatoes, nothing special. For dessert, Yiaourti Me Meli greek yogurt with spiced walnuts & dates drizzled with marshall's honey has a pleasant surprise of flavor! It was sweet, light, tangy and a lot of different texture to tantelize your taste bud! The other one was Layered tart if phillo, custard, pistachio. This was like a Greek cheesecake. The top was a light soft cream cheese and the bottom crust was like a crispy nest, divine! Overall, it was very well executed and well done!

It was clearly full up but we were told that the bar is \"first come first served\". There was a  group ahead and they were quickly seated so in my head we were next in line...but oh was I wrong. A few minutes later a couple came in and overtook us in line. I forgave them pretty fast as I thought that they might not have realised we were waiting. 10 minutes later they left. If I could only tell them how good a decision that was... A few minutes before they left, two well-groomed ladies had arrived, disregarded the bunch of people waiting and took stance behind two guys who looked liked they were almost finished. \"Can't be\"; I thought to myself. \"Why would anyone do that?\"; I thought to myself. I found out the answer around an hour later (an hour of waiting). Another couple of well-groomed ladies came in (after 3 more couples entered and refused to acknowledge that others were waiting) and were happy to see people they knew eating at the bar. We overheard them ask their friends \"so how does it work, can we sit here?\" So it was about to happen again. No one cares. And atmosphere ruined. I left feeling stupid and embarrassed that I had hope in the kindness of people.\n\nIn a fancy restaurant I can't accept that we're supposed to fight with each other for a seat at the bar. The clientele have no manners or respect or human decency for that matter! First come first served? Nope. First one to be an inconsiderate a** served. \nIt felt like we were gatecrashing a party here. Except that everyone here was making it impossible to do so. I get that the bar staff are very busy but can it be so impossible that they notice that people are waiting and others just come in and steal seats? \n\nI read some reviews where for some people it seems fun and \"interesting\" to act like this. Oh please. I mean, I am new to the US but really? In fancy restaurants we're supposed to fight, whereas in the Taco Bell around the corner we're actually decent humans who actually wait in line? (and yes I know it's not exactly the same thing but this is the first and only time I've experienced such rudeness and snobbery). \n\nI imagine this is the kind of place that appeals to pretentious locals and rich (also pretentious) visitors. If you want to come here with a group of people and act like a jerk for the night; book a table and have fun. It's gotten enough reviews to suggest the food is fine and I'm sure the service is overwhelmingly good once you're seated and spending money. \nBut for those who still think SF is a pretty amazing city and anyone who still has hope for society: AVOID", "author": "Michelle O."}

Warning: this is HUGE and suffices as 1.5 entrees.\n\n*lamb meatballs - divine per usual\n\n*whole sea bass, oven-roasted w/ lemon, herb, olive oil - the true skill of a chef is showcased in the simplest of dishes.  The bass was perfectly roasted and there was plenty of meat under the crispy, lightly salted skin. The oil, lemon and herb drizzled over the fish enhanced the meat's subtle sweetness.

I think it was just an issue with personal preference.  The cinnamon was so overpowering and the meat was rather dry.  \n\nWe over-ordered for a party of two as we underestimated the size of the pita platter!  The service and ambiance were topnotch and consistent with my previous visit.  I love Kokkari and highly recommend it to everyone!", "author": "Jen Y."}

Haha.\n\nI came here on with my family for an 8:30 reservation. We got seated and started perusing the menu. All I can say is there are a lot of words I cannot pronounce! :P \n\nAfter speaking with the waiter we decided to start with their grilled octopus, trio of dips (you have to ask for this because it is not stated on the menu- it came with caviar hummus, eggplant, and tzatziki), and their mushroom special of the day. It took a while for the apps to come out but we dug into the wonderful table bread and olive oil provided. The highlight of the apps was the trio of dips. So wonderfully delicious. I could eat a whole mountain full of the tzatziki sauce. Their grilled pita is soooo good as well to sop up all the goodness. The octopus was ok- it was too soft IMO and didn't have a good bite to it. The mushrooms were good but not my first choice of appetizer. We did need our veggies though, haha!\n\nFor entrees we opted for the Lamb Chop, Lamb Special, Feta-Stuffed Quail, and the Whole Fish of the Day (roasted). My dad had a salad and was the garbage can for whatever the 4 girls couldn't finish! By far the Lamb Chop was the star of the show. Wonderfully juicy and not gamey at all! YUMMMMMMM! The potatoes that came with it were superb as well. Good thing we ordered this because they were sold out of it by the end of the night! The Lamb Special was pieces cut off a whole lamb that has been spinning on a rotisserie in the middle of the restaurant. You got a taste of everything. Whatever piece I tried was so good, fatty, and melt in your mouth. The Feta-Stuffed Quail was my Dad's favorite. The Quail was really succulent and the addition of the feta made it oh so wonderful. The Whole Fish was by consensus the least successful dish of the meal. It was a bit too fishy tasting and it didn't have a distinct \"Greek\" flavor like the other dishes.\n\nFor dessert nothing really sounded appealing until the waiter explained the Galaktoboureko to us. It is basically a filo egg roll with custard layers inside. It was paired with pistachio ice cream. MmM! Really good! So good in fact I only had one bite and then it was all gone!! :/\n\nOverall, a great meal celebrating and enjoying each others company :) I definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner with family, friends, or a date.", "author": "Angela D."}

Ever since I went to Milo's in NYC, it was challenging to find something great out here and I had heard all the raves about Kokkari, so I chose it as the dining destination for my birthday recently.\n\nBesides having to take an elevator to use the restroom, this restaurant's layout is beautiful. The entrance leads into the bar and as you make your way past the hall, you see the kitchen and then more dining areas.\n\nWe were in a party of ten and although the restaurant called me three times to confirm the reservation, they did an excellent job at setting up a large, comfortable table. They also accommodated the request of serving cake, without a cake cutting fee.\n\nI would highly highly recommend the octopus salad and lamb riblets.

Let me begin with the smelt, I have grown up eating whole fish and the fried smelt was probably one of the best I have ever had. Fried perfectly and the light flavorful batter was the perfect compliment to the mild meaty fish. The best way to describe this dish would be fish French fries, in the best way possible. The salty tangy smelt was accompanied by a garlic aioli. Along with the smelt we had the zucchini cakes which balanced out the smelt perfectly. Light and bright served with a thick and creamy tzatziki sauce, this balanced out our starters. For entrees we had the grilled fish of the day, Mediterranean bass with olive oil, lemon and greens and the lamb moussaka. The moussaka was rich, hearty and lamby, the best way I can describe it as being at home and having a hot home cooked meal on a cold winter day.  The bass was amazing as well, it was perfectly cooked with a crispy herbed skin and moist flaky meat. The olive oil and lemon highlighted the fish's delicate flavor and made the greens come to life. I will be back here in the near future as there are at least a half dozen more items on the menu that I need to try. In addition to the food the staff was amazing and made us feel right at home. The d\u00e9cor and ambiance were the perfect match for a meal that was out of this word but still felt like you were at home amongst friends. On a final note there was what I assumed was a lamb or goat being spit roasted in the hearth that I want to inquire about.", "author": "Stephen K."}

I had a fried cheese (not sure exactly what it was) appetizer which was super salty! I also had the calamari which was okay. I was debating between the lamb chops and rotisserie and decided to go for the rotisserie of the day which was a large portion of different cuts of lamb with potatoes. Very filling and really good. The Baklava was also delicious.\n\nOverall, I feel like the place is a little overhyped though.

Walked in and was seated right away.  We had reservations at 5:00PM so we got to see the restaurant transform to how they really function.  They kept up with the very busy crowd, and all the hustle and bustle.  \n\nThe Maitre d was professional and accomodating.  Loved our waiter - Michael.  At first seemed cold and unfriendly but as the night went on and he got started, he warmed up and had a great friendly personality.  He memorized EVERYTHING WE ordered and my husband betted me that our waiter would mess up at least one of our orders - WRONG.  Michael was precise with taking our order!!!  I never had lamb before, and we ordered the lamb riblets for appetizer and OMG - It was delish.  It actually tasted like beef and it just melted in my mouth!\n\nEverything on the menu is a must try.  We ordered and loved the following:\n\nAppetizers:\nArnisia Plevrakia (Lamb riblets)\nKarpouzi me Feta (Watermelon Salad)\nKolokithokeftethes (Fried zuccini)\n\nEntree:\nGaleos (Steak Halibut)\nMosharisia Brizola (Age Rib-eye steak)\n\nDessert:\nBaklava \n\nWe loved the atmosphere and the ambiance of the restaurant.  We sat in the open kitchen area - and I could not believe I did not walk out of the restaurant smelling like food/spices.  That open kitchen is awesome and must be built with great fans that suck up all the aroma of the food.  The restaurant is fine dining, and there were people dressed up  - while others walked in as though they just came from hiking.  You must be careful if you wear heals/stilettos - hardwood floors throughout the restaurant, and it can be slippery.  Thankfully I had my husband to hold on to.  FYI:  Restrooms are in a different level of the restaurant.  You must take an elevator to get there.  There are also small private dining rooms where the restrooms are located.  It's pretty cool!  \n\nPrice is expected to be pricey but $130 is not so bad considering all that we ordered and we did not order wine.  Highly recommend to check out!", "author": "Lyn D."}

We were seated quickly; our drinks came soon after and the waitress was friendly, engaging and very insightful. \n\nWe asked for suggestions for our meal and were told a common tactic to navigate this menu was to order a score of smaller plates and share a larger plate. We decided to go with three appetizers and one main dish. \n\nWe had the grilled octopus, per the waitress's suggestion, the oven-roasted brussels sprouts and the much raved about zucchini cakes. The sprouts were spritzed with some lemon, and they were cooked very well. Some pieces had a nice little char taste to them balancing out the brussel-ey taste that's common. They held together well, not being overly-mushy and were much sweeter than the average cabbage. The octopus was rather disappointing as the waitress had trumpted them pretty strongly. They were still chewy and I felt as if they were under-cooked a bit. (The waitress comp'ed them cause she felt bad which was a wonderful move.) The zucchini cakes deserve all the praise they've gotten on yelp. A deep fried veggie often has the tendency to get soggy, but these cakes were refreshing and packed with flavor on the inside, while crispy on the outside. It was well complemented with the thick yogurt dressing to cut through some of the potential oiliness of the shell. It was my favorite part of the meal.\n\nFor the main, we shared the three lamb chops. They were cooked perfectly to order, seasoned just right. It was juicy and delectable, not at all tough. The oregano and lemon seasoning combination was a great companion. And the potato wedges were a surprisingly impressive starch. They were definitely fresh-cut, and had a healthy amount of salt, which appealed to my taste palate. \n\nI will definitely return in the future, but I want to try out their fish entrees.

You were there to kick start our big girls night out.\n\nParking was a breeze during dinner on the weekend.  Our two cars had no trouble finding a spot within a block from the restaurant.  That's good because we were all in pretty high heels.  Yes, we were doing girls night out, big time.\n\nService was excellent.  Our coats were taken promptly (though at the end they held one of the coat belts hostage unknowingly), water was served promptly, and plus, our waiter was very metro pretty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-20", "description": "On a foggy Monday night, I stepped into this Mediterranean oasis that was truly jaw dropping. Until coming to this Kokkari, I have never been inspired to visit a country due to a restaurant. But boy, this restaurant is like stepping into a home off the coast of Greece. When you first walk in the restaurant is dark and romantic, probably best if you are on a date. In the back of the room lies the roasting pit, which simply makes your mouth salivate over which meat you want devour. If you don't sit in this room they take you to a much larger dining area further back in the restaurant which is very well lit, probably better for groups and families, and also contains the open kitchen where you can see the chefs work their magic. The ambiance is absolutely amazing because after you dine here, you might be on your smart phone booking the next flight to Greece as you walk out the door. My brother and I sat in the larger dining area where our Greek food bonanza began. \n\nTo start the meal as always was a small loaf of bread, I'd like to say either Acme or French, which was very pleasant. The crust was nice and crunchy and the inside was soft and delicious. To accompany the bread was some sea salt and olive oil. The olive oil was good, but was most surprising to me was the sea salt. It was not your standard table salt that is super salty and intolerable if you have too much. If this makes any sense it was not that salty actually  and I could actually eat it by itself, obviously not in huge amounts only small dabs. My brother and I then split the grilled octopus for our appetizer. I've had amazing octopus, Babbo's in New York, but this one simply outclassed all the rest. It was cooked absolutely perfectly not being chewy at all like you would expect and the outside was almost a little crispy I'd like to say. And combined with the olive oil and lemon juice, I must say it is simply divine. For our entree's I had the famous lamb chops and my brother the whole grilled fish of the day, sea bass. I was so excited to try these lamb chops because I have heard they were the best in the bay area. They were certainly good, but I was a little disappointed because I thought they would be better. I felt that they were slightly under seasoned, but the cook on the chops were second to none. Also they had a nice smoky and charcoal bite to them which I thoroughly enjoyed. The potatoes were nice and crispy and was delicious with the lemon-oregano vinaigrette that the lamb was cooked in. The lamb chops again I thought were good, but did not give me that wow factor. I do believe that my mom's lamb chops, in my book, could give Kokkari a run for it's money. I can't say too much about the fish because I only had a small taste, but from that one taste I can say that if you are not a big fan of lamb this is the dish you must get. They will even de-bone the whole thing for you. \n\nService was a let down for me. Although they were there for all our needs whether it be bread, drinks, or anything else our main server seemed very uninterested. She walked off as soon as possible, and didn't really interact with us . I know she may have been busy, but even the most busy restaurants a good server will always be friendly and try to make their customers happy, because that always brings a bigger tip!\n\nAmbiance: 6/5 take me to Greece please!\nFood: 4/5 Octopus yes, I'll try the lamb shank next time \nService: 3.5/5 Maybe our server had a bad day?", "author": "Mitchell L."}

I gnawed at the lamb ribs until the bones were shiny so as that I wouldn't leave a bit of flavor.  Other notable dishes were the grilled octopus and good pita bread.  Had a wonderful greek coffee and a desert that was like pudding/cheesecake along with the sweet strands of pastry.

You will not be disappointed if you eat here.  Usually, on a weekend I am sure you need a reservation so if you are planning to eat here you should make a reservation just to make sure you are seated.  On a Monday they were very busy.   The staff was very friendly, and they are very very nice in explaining to you what they have on the menu and the specials.  They also a huge wine selection available so if you are a wine drinker you will like this place also.\n\nI think for the quality of the food and environment and the way the staff is, for the price point that your paying it is quite reasonable.  Expect to pay about $80 for a dinner for 2.  But it is really good and you should at least try this place at least once.  I came here because I read all the good reviews when I was close by and decided to give it a try and I thought it was outstanding!  Great place to bring a date. \n\nThere is an older crowd that comes in here and I was pretty much in my jeans and sweater, so I am sure I was under dressed.  But I don't care.

We dropped in on a whim since we were in the area, and sat at the bar since we didn't have reservations.  They do offer the full menu at the bar, so this is a good short cut to the great food without fighting for reservations.  The decor is chic and dimly-lit, with a very friendly feel, despite the upscale atmosphere.  The wine list was a nice one-pager that provided good variety without being overly complicated.  \n\nHere's what we ordered (all appetizers to sample wider offerings):\n\nOctapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil.\nThis was my favorite dish of the evening.  The dish had a light and zesty taste, with a very nice grill charring to give the octopus a flavor not usually found in seafood.  Best to enjoy warm/immediately when it arrives.\n\nFig Salad (not on the menu)\nThis was my second favorite dish of the evening - Sliced figs with arugula and sprinkled cheese on top - this combination offered a light sweetness and smooth taste and texture that worked very well as a salad to start with.  Highly recommended.\n\nSoutzoukakia - grilled lamb meatballs with spiced tomato sauce & Greek yogurt.\nI'm not generally a fan of lamb due to the sometime gamey taste.  These meatballs did not have the gamey taste and were tender and delicious.  The yogurt provided a nice creaminess without feeling heavy.  They also went very well with the Duckhorn cab I had.  \n\nKalamari - grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, orange with black olives.\nSimilar in texture to the grilled octopus, but not nearly as awesome as the grilled octopus.  The stuffing does complement the calamari, however, and provide it with a more substance.  \n\nKarpouzi me Feta - watermelon & feta with pine nuts & Greek basil.\nThis appetizer is refreshing and interesting, but given all the choices, I would opt to try something else.  \n\nOverall, we really enjoyed Kokkari.  I'd definitely recommend my friends and family to check it out.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the main courses next time!", "author": "Leo C."}

When we got there it was packed to be kind. The restaurant allows you to get drinks at the bar while you're waiting which I appreciated because it was cold outside but I felt bad for the diners who were close by. It's extremely loud in the restaurant, even worse if you're seated near the bar. But the atmosphere adds to the experience. The open fire oven and the open kitchen in the main dining room is beautiful and really left me in anticipation of my own food. \n\nThe wine list is overwhelming - the smaller one is for the ballers while the bigger one has more offerings that will appeal to the poor folk to saved up to come here :-P. We ordered a bunch of appetizers but my favourites were the lamb meatballs and zucchini cakes with tzatziki. I don't think I really needed a main course honestly. But I did *tummy groan* make room for it. I love lamb and the braised lamb shank did not disappoint! I found the orzo served with it to be a little too salty (maybe from the Greek cheese) and adding a vegetable would have been a welcomed exchange for half the orzo. But eat up the lamb I did. My bf had the lamb kebabs which were also very tasty. The pickled cucumbers and potatoes served with the kebabs were outstanding. They might be some of the best potatoes I've ever eaten.\n\nWe split a sundae (a surprise for my Birthday) and although my stomach had already doubled in size, I couldn't not have a bite. The peanuts, chocolate and whip cream were to die for. The chocolate was rich but without being overly sweet (did they buy it from producers in America???) and I wish I could have taken it with me to eat the rest later. \n\nThe service is friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.\n\nIf you're looking for Greek food, this one is a must for SF!", "author": "Janelle C."}

First time was last nite-booked res 3 wks in advance, so need to plan ahead as tough to get in. Restaurant is beautiful, warm and great ambience, staff professional and our waiter was one of the best we've experienced in decades of fine dining. I will say the bartender was a bit rude when asked for a cocktail menu (as many bars offer unique selections we like to try), his very indignant response being that \"no...we've never needed a cocktail menu in 16 yrs...\". We decided to skip the cocktail experience and just wait for our table on the side-his loss. We immediately forgot about his rudeness as we were seated and cared for expertly by the wait staff. And the best part of all-food did not disappoint-Believe the Hype-it's all true. So many more items we wanted to try but it was just me and hubby...the lamb riblets are a Must (we ordered a 2nd they were so good!), the grilled octopus tender and flavorful and the watermelon feta salad was a refreshing side-beautiful color. I had the roasted sole, hubby had the grilled lamb chops-both amazing and would order again-so expertly prepared and flavorful-even the greens that came with the fish were amazing. Last but not least-the summer special dessert-acme bread pressed into a dessert tin with blackberry brandy and fresh berries, set for hours and then turned upside down so all the rich juices permeate the cake like substance, topped with fresh whipped cream-so refreshing, sweet and we wished we could have have seconds here too!!

We ate a sampling of appetizers, I had a delicious salad with beets and my co-worker had a lamb dish. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. It is obvious they mix up the menu as new seasonal ingredients become available. My two standout favorites were the Lamb Riblets and this eggplant dip we got when I asked about babaganush. The riblets were so good I started exploring how I would go about making them. They were braised then seared and were simply delicious with classic greek oregano and lemon seasoning. The eggplant dip was chunkier than a babaganush and had a lot of dill. I love dill and I love eggplant and I had never had them together like this. A unique treat for sure.\n\nThe other thing we really enjoyed was our waiter. He was obviously a professional. He at one point daintily used a butter knife to swipe the crumbs off our tablecloth. Slick. He was also just sort of witty and snarky. He was so good and so fun I think he actually made the food taste better.

Very heavy, fattening, put me in a food coma, which was the opposite of what I was looking for!  \n\nDecent wine list.  Dessert menu looked good too even though we didn't try it.  Maybe a tad on the expensive side for what we ate.  But overall I would definitely go again and recommend this to others!!", "author": "Theresa W."}

If you're not a fan of lamb, you need to look away. It's as Bubba, from Forest Gump would say, \"How many ways can you cook lamb?\" At Kokkari, you can skewer it, roast it, and grill it. There's lamb shanks and lamb chops to choose from. \n\nWe started off with the lemon/chicken/rice soup. It was my least favorite dish. The Williams-Sonoma recipe I use at home tastes better. The zucchini cakes were very good. 2 cakes with a lge scoop of dill yogurt for dipping. We also tried the lamb riblets - 5 sm ribs which were tasty and tender. They give you slices of bread (not so great) and a saucer of salty olives at the table.\n\nMy sea bass (grilled, but you can have it cooked by rotisserie), $33, was fabulous. A whole fish, grilled to perfection, came with a 1/2 lemon encased in cheesecloth for you to squeeze over the fish. \nHubby had the lamb which was also good, came with potatoes. \n\nOur glasses of wine, were $9-$10 each. My Riesling paired well w/the seafood. I was not planning on dessert but like a glutton, went ahead and ordered the baklava (2 pieces) which came with a sm scoop of ice cream. They were willing to sub coconut (it was OK) instead of the vanilla praline ice cream. I couldn't finish and took my dessert home. Truthfully, some of the baklavas I've bought prepackaged in delis have tasted better. These were overloaded w/chopped nuts and the clove spike in the middle added an odd flavor to the baklava.\n\nHubby's custard encased in a tubular filo was scrumptious, came w/the vanilla praline ice cream. I'd recommend this dessert. \nTotal damage including tip comes to approx. $80/person. \n\nThe wait staff was pretty good. I did encounter a problem w/our reservation a couple of wks ago. I booked via Open Table over 1 mo ago and then later, received an email from Kokkari that they canceled our reservation. I called them and told the reservationist there must be a mistake as I didn't cancel. She told me she was going to put it back in (not by Open Table). Next, I get a notification by email for a reservation a week earlier than the original book date. So, I went back on Open Table and re booked it and had to call her again to cancel the 2nd mistake. Other than that, service was pretty good. It wasn't too noisy except for the large table next to us where this gent was speaking loudly about law to his companions.

The food is so-so and nothing special.  But my biggest complaint is the oil - they DRENCH everything in tons of oil.  After my last visit, I was physically ill all night after ingesting it.  The only dish saving this review from a 1-star rating was the grilled octopus which was (with all ITS oil) excellent.

Sigh, at least the food has been worth it.\n\nWent to Kokkari on Sunday for dinner as one of my besties was flying in from Seattle and I was at work so the proximately was ideal for me. I didn't realize that they shared 80% of the same menu as their sister restaurant, Evvia, in Palo Alto. I loved Evvia so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed here.\n\nFavorites include: the grilled artichoke and eggplant appetizer, the eggplant and taziki spreads with pita, the lamb chops (didn't try this myself but was raved about by 2 of my friends), and the grilled octopus (again didn't try this myself but was raved about by 2 of my friends). I actually didn't enjoy the zucchini cakes all that much though I know everyone loves them.\n\nI had a glass of Sigalas, Santorini '10 and LOVED it. It is their most popular Greek wine and I totally see why. If you feel like wine, definitely get a glass of this.\n\nThe only thing that holds me back from giving this 5 stars is 1. the temperature controls, it was very warm the whole time we were there and 2. while there are great vegetarian appetizers, they are very limited in terms of mains.

I have been coming here since it opened--probably 15 years ago? \n\nMy question for the manager--WHY are the rudest people on your staff the ones who answer your phone?!! Those women lack the capability to be friendly to your customer. I have noticed this trend for the past year. I called to cancel a future reservation--yes who calls anymore to CANCEL a reservation and free it up for someone else--she initially disconnected me putting me on hold, then after I called back she said \"now what do you want\"? I replied that I needed to cancel a reservation. She replied \"Oh\". I gave her my name and date/time and she said I see that there. No \"thank you for calling\". Just \"oh\". \n\nEarlier in the year I called to inquire how far out I could make a reservation for a date. I was given incorrect information. When I called on the date that I thought was correct, I was told there were no reservations on that date. I said \"but the reservations just opened hours ago\". She said no that they had opened on the first day of the month (NOT what the Kokkari phone person had told me). When I said \"oh no I love this restaurant and was trying to plan a get together\" she replied \"You don't have to get rude with me\". WHAT? I wasn't rude at all. I used a standard tone with my voice and if anything sounded sad and bummed out, but not RUDE. The receptionist did nothing to say --let's see what we can do to get you in. Nothing. Rude. \n\nOwner--Manager--whomever hires these women--PLEASE call in now and then and see how they talk to you??? Do a little check on them??

I think the only thing that I was disappointed with was the lobster special that my brother ordered, too much butter. My other brother ordered a lamb shank, and I think that it was cooked perfectly, but I just don't bother with lamb shanks. Why get a lamb shank when you can get a grilled lamb chop? Anyway, nothing was particularly overpriced, the wine list was pretty well balanced.

There is a charm in saying \"no\" - it is called \"being polite\". \n\nI called in to book a table for two, two weeks in advance. The available spots were an hour on either side of my preferred time. I picked one slot and requested a call back if a table opens up due to a cancellation. I was told (without any empathy) that \"we don't call back people - you need to call us back and check\". I asked if there was a waitlist. To that, the answer was \"we don't do waitlists..\". \n\nLet me get this right: 1) I am spending my time to call you two weeks in advance, 2) I am accommodating my schedule to accept the slot you have, 3) I am willing to spend $$$ on you, and 4) You don't have a decency to show some empathy (a simple \"sorry, we are full\" would do) toward your customers.\n\nKokkari - I give you 2 star because I like the food.

The Whole Branzino was cooked perfectly and they debone the fish for you.  The fish meat was sweet and tender and I will definitely return for this dish.\n\nThe Goat Stew was a little heavy as I was not in the mood for stew but as I have never had goat before I thought I would try a bite.  They really make the goat dish quite well.  If you have never had goat before, this would be the place to try it.\n\nThe Lamb Rotisserie was delicious!

All the seasoning was in the skin, and the skin wasn't crispy as I had hoped but more of a fatty wet.\n\nThe Ortikia ($30) was the Quail stuffed with feta and served with smoked bacon rice. The quail was tender but didn't hardly have any feta. The smoked bacon was actually over powering, or rather overwhelming all other flavor and a bit saltier than I would like.\n\nThe famous lamb chops - Arnisia Paidakia ($38) - was definitely cooked tender but according to EC, he's had better.\n\nAnd then dessert - Galaktoboureko ($8) - semolina custard in filo with fresh figs & pistachio ice cream.

Or not, because perhaps one should limit the amount of fried cheese and lamb they consume.\nWe went for lunch while in town for our honeymoon and it was easily the best meal of our trip. We started with the saganaki (had to), which was absolute perfection. My sister in law is Greek, and always judges a Greek restaurant's authenticity by whether or not they bread their saganaki. Kokkari did not, and it was a winner. Sadly, they didn't light it on fire in front of us (maybe it was because it was lunch, or maybe they just don't do that) but it was still fabulous.\nI started with the Greek salad (good, standard) and he got the avgolemono soup, which was also great.\nOur server helped us pick delicious wines to go with our entree (and served us complimentary honeymoon champagne). He had a great Greek white with the whole fish (another thing my sister in law says a good Greek place MUST have) and I had a luscious Merlot with a bowl of mousakka. His fish was great (and he polished off the whole thing) but my mousakka - good lord. This may officially be what I would request at my last meal. So rich and gooey and complex with the nutmeg and cinnamon flavors.

Hostess was nice, even wished us a \"happy anniversary.\"  She must've looked at our Open Table res notes.  We had reservations for 8:30 and were seated promptly.  Our table was nice, as it was by itself.  I noticed that some of the tables were very close together, but we were fortunate to get ours.\n\nOur waiter was very informative and had some good recommendations.  We chose the grilled octopus app which was outstanding.  We both went with the Moussaka.  Again, outstanding.  It was filled with ground lamb, potatoes, and mushrooms.  Kinda like a Greek shephard;s pie.\n\nFor dessert, we chose the baklava with ice cream.  Now, here's where it gets a little sketchy.  First off, the baklava was good.  Not great, but good.  Upon my wife's last bite, she discovered, much to her dismay, a single wayward hair implanted firmly amongst the layers of phyllo dough.  Initially,  we found this somewhat amusing.  This may be due to the quality of the cocktails we had up to this point (they were, indeed, high quality).  Our busboy came by and my wife told him there was a hair in her baklava.  He let out a sort of \"hmmmph\" then took the offending hair and out plates away.\n\nThe manager came by shortly thereafter.  I think he was the manager because he was wearing a suit and had a moustache and that's what managers look like.  He apologized for the hair.  However, when I told him, \"It was on my wife's last bite,\" his reply was rather curious.  He responded, \"Well, of course it was.\"  Now, I may be reading into his reply too much, but it sounded like he was implying that we had fabricated the whole hair thing.   Let me say this - my wife has very blond hair and mine is black.  The hair in question was unequivocably brown.  We do not carry a kit with spare hair in it to strategically place in high end food, hoping to get a freebie.\n\nRegardless, the dessert was taken off the bill.\n\nAll in all, despite \"Hairgate,\" very nice place.", "author": "Alan A."}

This gave me a chance to see the rest of the restaurant which is freaking huge! Biggest restaurant I have seen in the city. My journey to the lav took me through the restaurant and into an elevator to a small basement with some other party rooms which looked pretty cool. The whole place has a feeling of being in a cozy Tuscan mansion with the tall ceilings, fireplaces and smart uses of wood along the walls and ceiling. \n     Started with the meatballs and the saganaki. Meatballs were fantastic. Perfectly cooked and seasoned with a great sauce on top. My saganaki was the only miss of the afternoon. I love me some saganaki! From the table side lighting of the brandy on top, to the gooey, hot cheese begging to be slopped up with some good bread. This was not the case here. We were handed a perfectly rectangular, cold piece of cheese which was like cutting through a piece of meatloaf. The cheese seemed nice but the lack of cooking it made for an unpleasant dish. \n     Entrees were the moussaka (sp?), lamb burger and the special of the day, half chicken. Chicken was up there with some of, if not the best I have ever had. (try the clay pot chicken at betelnut)  We're talking fall of the bone moist with some of the most flavor you could possibly put into a sometimes bland entree choice.  Perfecto.  Lamb burger was again, one of the best. Great balance of flavors with no one component overshadowing the other. The accompanying fries were also fantastic. Thin, crispy heaven. My moussaka was probably in last place but still a great dish. A large soup bowl filled with a lamb, cheese and mushroom \"casserole\". Quite a unique dish with some great flavors I have never experienced before. The sometimes overpowering taste of lamb was somehow very subtle with an almost sweet flavor from I'm guessing cinnamon. \n     Servers were great. Succinct and to the point. Friendly without being overbearing. Attentive every step of the way. I had been wanting to come here for a while and I wasn't disappointed. Probably a 4.5 for me with the misstep on the saganaki but otherwise a fantastic experience!", "author": "Mark N."}

Their decor actually reminds me a lot of Aziza's decor, very unique and has a lot of character.\n\nI loved their plates. It's so pretty, reminded me of the pottery slides of ancient Greece in my design history classes. \n\nSourdough bread. It was alright, definitely not a fan of sourdough though it's distinctly SF.\n\nOlives & Sea Salt. Not really a fan of olives (unless they're canned) so me no likey.\n\nZucchini Cakes. With Cucumber & Mint Yogurt Dressing. This was damn good! The cakes were nicely fried and the texture of the zucchini was fresh and delicious. NOMS. I love the dressing too, it was just the right amount of tanginess and worked well with the zucchini cakes. NOMS. Definitely a fan!\n\nMoussaka. Eggplant, Lamb, Potato & Yogurt B\u00e9chamel Casserole. This was alright, a little heavy on the nutmeg. But otherwise pretty good, aside from the fact that it was a little on the heavy side, couldn't eat too much of it because of that. \n\nArnisia Paidakia. Grilled Lamb Chops with a Lemon-Oregano Vinaigrette & Kokkari Potatoes. These were by far the most disappointing, due to the many amazing reviews on Yelp. They were very bland and grilled past my \"medium\" request since they were barely even pink. Plus, I couldn't even tell there was a vinaigrette in it, there was literally no flavor. I don't know why I paid $35 for these when I could do better at home. So disappointing. \n\nBaklava. Walnut and Honey Baklava with Baklava Ice Cream. On the menu, it said that it comes with vanilla-praline ice cream, but our server told us the special dessert of the day was baklava ice cream. We asked if we could replace the vanilla-praline with baklava and our server was kind enough to oblige. The baklava ice cream was definitely way better than the baklava itself. I found the baklava much too sweet and the walnuts were a little too coarse for my liking. The baklava ice cream, on the other hand, were wonderfully flavored. It wasn't overly sweet and I loved how there was honey ribbon and pieces of phyllo dough in the ice cream. \n\nOverall, I was pretty disappointed in their lamb chops because it was mediocre at best and I've definitely had much better and can personally do better. However, my faves were definitely the zucchini cakes and the baklava ice cream. And their service was very good, our server was knowledgeable about the menu and was kind enough to switch out our ice creams for the \"special\" ice cream. So without the great service it would have only warranted 2 stars but +1 star for amazing service. Definitely a little overrated among the Yelp community though, their lamb chops are not worth those 4.5 stars.", "author": "Constance C."}

This restaurant is always bustling and appears to have a major cult following - with good food, good service and wonderful interior decoration and design with a great atmosphere it's easy to see why.\n\nMany people seem to absolutely love the food here and although I think it's good, to me, it's not \"home run outta' the park\" good but more like \"a triple, sliding into third base and safe by the skin of your teeth\" good.\n\nMy favorite appetizers have to be the grilled octopus and pan fried kefalograviera cheese.  The grilled octopus is extremely popular and for good reason, it's simply amazing.  I honestly thought I was going to have to remind myself at every bite not to think about how I'm eating a tentacle, but it was so delicious that it wasn't even an issue.  The zucchini cakes and kalamata pita are pretty good but I probably would not order them again.\n\nAll of the main entrees are quite good, though some better than others.  The lamb chops I ordered during my first visit were pretty good, but I've had much better.  If you're feeling like lamb I'd suggest the lamb shank (much larger portion and much more tender) or the moussaka (probably the best, in my opinion, of the three lamb dishes). The lemon herb rotisserie chicken that you can see rotating over the large fire near the entrance of the restaurant is tasty, the meat is quite juicy and is a healthy sized portion. The pan roasted halibut is a smaller entree compared to many of the others but is still cooked quite well and with a squeeze of lemon on top it provides a nice little zesty flavor to the light savory sauce the halibut is served on.", "author": "Erich D."}

They have a gigantic wine list so you'll be sure to pick the perfect wine to go with your entree of choice (if you can choose just one).\n\nThe only reason I'm knocking off a star is that this place doesn't offer much space to wait for your table. We got there 5 minutes before our reservation and they recommended we wait either at the bar or the wine island. There's barely space for even one person to stand next to the bar (seating is limited) and the wine island is right next to some tables, so every time a waiter needed to visit those customers I was asked to move. I kept feeling like I was in the way, and was relieved when we finally sat down.\n\nThis was not a cheap meal and I must say, I probably couldn't afford it if I hadn't been treated, but once I'm not suffering from studenthood I would definitely make a point to come back here and blow some celebratory grown-up money.", "author": "Rachel A."}

He wanted to know what \"fancy\" Greek food was about and after hearing all the great things about Kokkari, we had to give it a try.\n\nTo start off, the starters all looked so good, it was really hard to decide!! We got the Octapodaki tou Yiorgou (grilled octopus), Aginares Souvlaki (grilled artichokes & eggplant skewer with Greek yogurt), and melitzanosalata (eggplant) dip with grilled pita. As we were ordering, the woman at the next table was raving about the Saghanaki (pan fried cheese) but we had already ordered too much so we never got the change to try it. EVERYTHING was really good. The grilled octopus was really flavorful and soft. My husband said it wasn't chewy enough for him but I actually enjoyed the lack of chewiness. The artichokes and eggplants on the skewer was paired well with the yogurt. The eggplant dip was a great complement to our other two appetizers because it was not too heavy.  \n\nAs for entrees, we heard the Arnisia Paidakia (lamb chops) is their signature dish so we had order that even though lamb is not my favorite meat. Our waitress highly recommended the Mosharisia Brizola (rib-eye steak) so that was what I ordered. The hubby liked his lamb but didn't love it; I thought the lamb was pretty good, which says something especially since the statement is coming from a non-lamb-loving (even lamb-hating) individual. The rib-eye on the other hand was a huge disappointment. I ordered it medium but it was super dry and it reminded me that I should not order steak anymore. They all taste about the same from restaurants that are not steakhouses.\n\nFor dessert, we had the Galaktoboureko (semolina custard in filo with Meyer lemon spoonsweet & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream), which was like a sweet egg roll with ice cream.\n\nThe bathroom was in an interesting location. I had to take an elevator to the bottom floor to get it.

If you're friendly and at least competent enough to sincerely apologize for screwups, that's often good enough for me.  But even I have a hard time overlooking a situation where it's glaringly obvious that people around you are getting significantly better service than you are.  Would I have ordered a different dessert if our waiter had bothered to tell us about the dessert specials that night?  Maybe, maybe not, but it would've been nice to have the option.  I had to ask him directly about the rotisserie and fish options for the evening, and somehow even that didn't prompt him to list the other entree specials (which I later overheard him describing for a nearby table, no prompting needed).  Was he actually rude to us?  No.  The handful of brief interactions we had with him were reasonably pleasant.  Were there any actual errors?  No.  Our food came out correct and incredibly delicious.  \n\nIf I were going by food alone, this would be a five-star experience.  The zucchini cakes were spectacular, my greek yogurt dessert with walnuts, dates, and honey was out of this world amazing, my grilled branzino was simple, fresh, and perfectly cooked, and my husband loved his lamb chops and potatoes (and also his baklava).  But it's frustrating to be treated like second-class citizen for the seemingly inexcusable sin of not ordering a drink at the start of the meal (at least I assume that was the logic?  I can't be sure, but it seems the most likely explanation).  I'm also not sure what invisible line we failed to vault over in order to be allowed to sit in the comfy chairs in the front part of the restaurant, but that bothered me a lot less than the service, as at least plenty of other people were in the same boat there.  Maybe it's just that the service I've gotten elsewhere in this town recently has been so darn good, it raised my expectations too high.  But is it really asking too much to be informed of the daily specials?  I think not.  It wasn't bad service, but it wasn't good service, either, and at a restaurant of this quality, I expect service to be at least decent.  In this, Kokkari failed.

We came here for my sister's birthday one year and received such awesome service, great wine selection to pair with the food, and delicious food that tantalized your tastebuds!\n\nAs for the ambiance, it was very romantic, rustic, and inviting.  Very familial like sitting at grandma's dining table.\n\nWe shared the starters and for our meals - pretty much passed them around like we were at home eating a family meal.  Everyone wanted to try each other's courses and they were all delicious.\n\nMy favorites are the fried crispy little smelt!  These little fish fried to a crisp with just a bit of lemon spritz on top were absolutely devine!\n\nThe simplicity of their dishes are what make them so delicious.

On average I end up waiting 1 to 1.5 hours before the food actually comes out of the kitchen. Last time I thought I timed it nicely by waiting 1 hour before heading over to the restaurant, but even then I had to wait an additional 30 minutes before my food appeared. If the food will take 1-2 hours to come out of the kitchen, just say so... there is no need to create false expectations for your takeout customers.\n\nKokkari is located right next to my office in the Financial District and it is a beautiful restaurant, with a wood burning stove right in the middle of the restaurant. Everyone in the restaurant is dressed nicely and talking business or flirting with their dates. \n\nI loved the food don't get me wrong, and the restaurant was beautiful.\n\nThe lamb riblets for starters was awesome to say the least. There was a biteful of flavor in each bite and the meat was extremely tender (fall off the bone). The meat to bone ratio was completely off however. Almost no meat at all...\n\nThe lamb chops and the half chicken were the best meats I have tasted outside of Yountville. The most flavorful lamb in the world and it was cooked to a perfect pink.

But then you get some who don't respect the \"line\" at the bar and kinda push their way to a seat and just grab it when we are all being civil and waiting our turn.  There is also the occasional old lady who is lonely and sits there slowly drinking her drinks.  So it's a bit of a scene.  We probably waited 30 minutes before we got our seat.  Well worth the wait.\n\nI've never had such amazing zucchini cakes with Greek yogurt.  Their yogurt is so creamy and thick!  The lamb chops are so much better than the lamb kabobs.  We both got medium rare and my kabobs were practically well done.  When I complained they just explained the kabobs cook faster because it is smaller.  Well, um, duh?  Why are they cooking the lamb chops the same amount of time as the kabob?\n\nThe wine by the glass selection is OK, not great.

The prices that were charged were appropriate for the quality of the food.  Furthermore, the drinks were great.  I asked the bartender to make something to surprise me, considering I enjoy martinis and dry ones at that, and he made a perfectly balanced Vesper.  I must say, the bartender's creativity was not lacking that night.\n\nAs for the parking situation, if you are driving, I would just advise to use the Valet parking service, since streetside parking in the area is hard to find, if at all.  The valet parking service is decently priced and have cash to prepare to tip the staff as well.\n\nOverall, all things considered, I think this is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco and a must do if you are in the area and are looking for a nice place to take a special someone to.

The food and service are both top notch. I love several things on the menu and havne't had anything that I don't like.\nDaily there is a fresh meat over fire they offer - I am not a big meat eater but it always smells amazing and everyone I have always been with loves it.  I have had their chicken souvalki, many fish offerings and several appetizers - I paricularly love their hummus and their pita bread is fabulous. The greek salad is the best I have ever had, the zucchini cakes were recommended by a server at one dinner and it was to die for.  The dolmathes are very fresh flavored and not oily as I have had in the past at other venues. Do yourself a favor and give it a try. Oh and don't forget dessert - Galaktoboureko is so yummy and not overly sweet like the Baklava which is also great but a bit on the super sweet side.

Finally I found a restaurant that he hadn't already tried.\n\nKokkari is beautifully decorated - it's not ostentatious, but feels like a very grand and splendid rustic kitchen, with scrubbed wooden tables and high backed armchairs and ginormous pots and pans hanging from the open kitchen. We were seated in the back room, the one with the kitchen, so it was really warm in there - towards the end of the night I felt a little like I couldn't breathe, but oh well.\n\nThe only Greek food I've had are gyros, so I really wanted to try the lamb - there were 3 or 4 options and they all sounded sumptuous. I ordered the lamb shank - and MAN was it a LOT of meat. The seasoning and the sauce with the rice reminded me of Moroccan food, so I wasn't super impressed. B got the grilled whole sea bass in a avgolemono sauce, and it was DELICIOUS. I'd recommend that over the lamb, although the fish is catch of the day. The wine list was confusing, since I know next to nothing about wine except that it should be drunk in great, hulking quantities, so we asked our knowledgable waitress for some recommendations and they were perfect. \n\nWhen I made my reservations on open table, there was a popup window asking if I had any special requests. I plugged in a question (It's my boyfriend's birthday - is there anything special I can do?) and then promptly forgot about it. But (without any further notice from me) our waitress brought out a little chocolate cake with a candle and it was SO awesome that the restaurant made a note of it when I didn't specifically ask for anything.

It could not have been better. I made reservations for the BF and me. He has Celiac, so a strict gluten free diet is all that is allowed. Kokkari was THE most accommodating restaurant we have been to that has been kind, nice, aware, and just great with the dietary restriction (even more accommodating than Gary Danko!) I tried to make reservations via Open Table, and I couldn't, so I thought I would just call and ask--- and it worked! When I spoke with the hostess on the phone, I asked if they had a gluten free menu, and she said no, but that they could make anything gluten-free. I was skeptical, but went ahead and made the reservation. \n\nFast fwd: when we checked in with the hostess, she knew that there was a gluten intolerance person in our party, our waiter knew, and the chef knew. I only had to mention it once when I made the reservation, and it was so great to not have to repeat myself! The waitress all night was attentive (but not overly so) and just so nice! Also, the table was right in front of the door, and it was a chilly night. I was a bit cold- and they were completely accommodating in finding a warmer spot for us to enjoy our dinner.  \n\nOn to the food: To die for! Everything we had was delicious. We had the grilled squid and prawns for apps. They were great. Dinner: Pestrofa - pan roasted Arctic char fillet over black lentils with artichoke & Kalamata olive tapenade- I am not a fish person, the BF loves fish tho, and he was in heaven. Also, it was a pretty great sized portion. I had Arnisia Paidakia - grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes and I was in heaven as well. Perfect seasoned, perfectly cooked. Dessert: Kokkari Sundae- Hit the spot... not too heavy, just enough sweet to hit the spot. \n\nWe will both be back soon!", "author": "Rosalind R."}

ONE night to dine in San Francisco. What to do? Where to go? So we checked Yelp for overall SF restaurant ratings and hit on Kokkari Estiatorio and since we both LOVE Greek food (and frankly have few great places here in DC), we bookmarked it and were able to get a table for two several weeks in advance.\n\nDespite it being a hot spot and hard table to get, especially on a Friday evening, we were welcomed warmly by hostess and manager (and amazing smells!!!) and seated promptly (despite being about 15 minutes early). \n\nBefore I get to food and drink, I HAVE to rave about our waiter, Chris. What a gem! He was helpful, knowledgeable, friendly ... just delightful. I probably embarrassed him by giving him a hug when we were leaving :)\n\nAnyway, from beginning to end, outstanding food AND wine ... I ordered a glass of Pence Ranch Pinot Noir which was, no joke, probably the best red by the glass I've ever had in a restaurant (and hubby agreed ... he liked his house Greek red a lot, but got a glass of the Pence for his second glass ... and while I usually like to try different blends, I had to have a second glass of it myself!)\n\nFor shared appetizers, we had the saghanaki, the sikotakia tigonita (crispy fried chicken livers marinated with yogurt and feta) and a house special that night, mussels in some sort of amazingness which I can't recall offhand. \n\nAll three were outstanding ... I've never met a saganaki I didn't love but this was especially good, the perfect blend of cheesy ooze and lemony lightness ... the chicken livers were delicious ... but the mussels ... oh, my. I have no idea where they get their seafood but we have NEVER seen mussels this size (mussels on steroids!). They were tender and juicy and just delectable. We would have happily gotten another plate of them had we only known!\n\nWe also shared a main course, the lamb chops, which must have come from the same Land of Huge as the mussels ... literally have never seen lambchops that huge, yet they were still tasty and delicious and cooked to perfection.\n\nWhile we rarely have dessert when we do Mediterranean or Greek (usually because we are just too full), we couldn't resist the Galaktoboureko, filo filled with custard, which was basically Greek dessert spring rolls. \n\nNo exaggeration, every single thing we ordered, from wine to dessert, was flawless. \n\nWe've had great meals at a lot of great places, and the older we get the more we try to hit every spot on our bucket list ... but this meal absolutely ranked in our all-time top 5 ... \n\nThank you to Kokkari Estiatorio, to the chef, to the wonderful Chris, and to the Yelpers whose raves and ratings landed it first on our search list!", "author": "Lisa W."}

If you share and do family style, then you won't be in a food coma because you get a little bit of everything. \n\nThe waiters and waitresses are also really nice and deserve a good tip.

SF is usually known for the wide variety of diverse cultures and people, unfortunately this restaurant is NOT.\n\n1,406 reviews.. 4.5 stars.. what a bunch of lies.. this is beyond over hyped.. if you want to spending $150+ on a good restaurant don't waste your time and look at other highly rated yelp restaurants\n\nOMG... I wished I had sorted the reviews based on lowest. Oh man I will never trust yelp sort again!\n\nAll the negative reviews about this was true. Goodness if I had only taken more time to research how bad this restaurant was.. then I would have avoid this mess to begin with.\n\nBefore you continue reading this review, please note that we are a married couple in our late 20's dressed in formal attire.\n\nCONS:\n-The man who seated us, probably the owner was absolutely rude. He didn't greet us, asked us how we were doing or even smiled during the entire waiting/seating process.\n\n- The seating is horrible.. my husband had to walk down two rows of tables before he could even sit down. I have to say that the seating layout did not make any sense at all. The weirdest thing was that we arrived pretty early around 5:45pm and they sited us in the most tightest spot possible, I was literally 2 inches away from the man next to me. When the man next to me was cutting his lamb chop he bumped into me a few times and excused him self. He even made some funny remarks about how cramped the space was. There were plenty of spaces available but I guess we didn't make the cut :/\n\n- SERVICE = what service? The waitress, a white blond lady with a bun pulled so tight it looked as though she just had one too many botox trips looked mean and off putting. She was the rudest server I have ever had. Note that I have eaten at fine establishments, such as Gary Danko, Michael Mina, and Chapeau just to name a few and for the price I am paying the service should match the food. When my husband asked what type of fish it was the dumbass waitress said well it's grilled and other is roasted.. no shit. What am I ten? He asked what fish is it.. not how it was prepared .. it was clearly written on the menu roasted and grill. I just looked at my husband like WTF?!?! are you kidding me?\n\nNow why do I say she is a racist? Well since we were sat so damn close to the couple next to us I could hear everything she said to them, she was warm and friendly, she brought comped desserts and oil/butter for their bread. Our table was never checked up on us, avoided us, and talked down to us as though we didn't have enough class or money to eat here. The bus boy/bread boy even had more class and politeness than her asking us how our day was and where we came from..\n-The food was really good but super oily.. there was no oil or butter for the bread.. the bread tasted as though it was left from yesterday. \n\nSorry for the long review but here are the key take ways\n\n-Don't go here if your race is other than white, because they stick their noses in the air and treat you like trash because this establishment is only meant for white people\n-Over priced foods for something you can go to your local greek fast food cart \n-RUDE service from a waitress that doesn't even know what is on the menu.. that's just sad\n\nEven though the service was rude we decided to give a 25% tip, but I now regret doing so because as we left there was no thank you or even eye contact recognizing that we had left.. \n\nKokkari Estiatorio you have left a sour taste in my mouth and I will NEVER return again!", "author": "the t."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-07", "description": "I love Greek/Mediterranean cuisine. So when we received a gift certificate to Kokkari, we went! \n\nThe reservation availabilities on Opentable.com are limited, we managed to get a table for 2 on the day before by calling the restaurant directly. Yes, reservations are hard to come by. When we were there on a Sunday evening, the place was packed and Kokkari is a good size restaurant with 2 dining rooms and a full bar. So, if you want to go, make your reservation early. Also the attire is dressy.\n\nDuring this visit, we had 6 courses between the 2 of us. \n\nFor appetizer, we shared:\n\nGRILLED OCTOPUS DRIZZLED WITH LEMON JUICE AND OLIVE OIL. Octopus was grilled perfectly and still tender. Very fresh and appetizing. \n\nOVEN CURED PORK WITH JULIENNED APPLES AND RAW BEETS. Essentially Greek's style prochuitto. Meh! Nothing outstanding to report on this dish. The thinly sliced ham was very mild, not smoky and not a whole lot of flavor to say the least. It was mediocre in my opinion. We should have stick to our gun and order the fried cheese, but instead we went with the server's recommendation. \n\nFor our main courses:\n\nI opted for the GRILLED WHOLE BRONZINO, which was the right choice. The whole fish came in a huge platter and the fish is roasted over the open fire oven, then deboned leaving only the fish fillets with the head and tail still intact and a side of saut\u00e9ed pea shoots. The grilled Bronzino was light, very fresh and flaky. All it needed was a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and a drizzle of good olive oil. It was so tasty and absolutely satisfying. Must love fish to order this dish. My only suggestion on improving this dish is that the restaurant staff would bring the entire grilled fish out to the table and deboned it table side before the customer. That would really make the experience so much more memorable and add a wow factor! Something I experienced when I ordered whole fish in Europe. \n\nFor meat lovers like my dining companion, he had the GRILLED LAMB CHOPS with OVEN ROASTED POTATOES WEDGES. I had a few bites and the lamb was so tender and it melted like butter in my mouth. Good seasoning on the outer crispy crust and grilled to medium pink. The potatoes were also super tasty and had a hint of cinnamon. Very generous portion - you get 3 whole lamb chops, which was a lot of meat.\n\nThen for our desserts: \n\nWe had the BAKLAVA with VANILLA PRALINE ICE-CREAM and the FILO DOUGH with MAYER LEMON CUSTARD and VANILLA ICE-CREAM. If you had baklava before, you can imagine this is a dessert on the sweet side. Surprisingly the vanilla and praline ice-cream wasn't as sweet as the baklava. \n\nUnlike other baklava, Kokkari's has more nuts and only 2 thin layers of filo dough on the top and base instead of multiple layers in the middle. The filo dough pastry with custard was a better choice. The warm custard is not very sweet, but very creamy and silky. The filling and the filo pastry are a match made in heaven. I highly recommend this dessert over the baklava. \n\nOur server was very friendly and attentive even though he had a full house that evening. He made some recommendation for the appetizer (cured ham) that we went with, but wasn't too impressed about it and realized that our server may have very different taste than we do and decided to stick with our guns on the entr\u00e9e choices. We received good table services but the staff and were happy to learn that the owners are actually Greek and some of the recipes are from the family recipe book. \n\nI can't say Kokkari is exactly affordable. Our 6-course with 2 glasses of wine, 2 cups of tea and a bottle of sparkling water came out to be $190 including tax and gratuity. We had just came back from France and for the same amount of courses, plus 4 glasses of wine and a bottle of water was only $150 and that was in a very good rating restaurant in Paris.

I dream about the fried smelt appetizer between visits! And the lamb shank entree is always falling off the bone tender! Year after year, visit after visit, Kokkari continues to woo my palate back.\n\nIt's not to say other dishes aren't great too. The grilled calamari appetizer is tender and unlike most any calamari appetizer you'll encounter elsewhere. The giant beans, the roasted beets, the grilled meatballs all have been winners. If you're in a large group sharing items, traditional favorites like dolmas and spanikopita are also worth adding to the order, though I'd shy away from them for a smaller group or a couple.\n\nAs I said before, I'm a sucker for the lamb shank entree. Definitely my favorite item on the menu with the fork tender meat that braising creates vs, say, their grilled lamb chop. That said, this past visit I got the goat stew special and my girlfriend got the whole roasted fish and both were delicious; the goat was not a bit gamey and the fish was perfectly cooked. There is not much on the menu I wouldn't recommend but I would, however, skip the dry-aged ribeye. At $39 it's the most expensive item on the menu and didn't seem worth it for the quality of the steak. If you're hankering for a great steak go to a steakhouse.\n\nMy usual dessert is the Greek yogurt with dates and honey. Simple and so tasty! And don't forget the Greek coffee after your meal.

You even have to take an elevator to go to the restroom downstairs where there is an inviting private dining room.\n\nMax was our waiter, a character and quite friendly as he explained all the daily specials and came back frequently to ensure our ongoing satisfaction. We shared a couple of unique appetizers - the $7.75 Kolokithokeftethes, which was a couple of fried zucchini cakes served with a dollop of cucumber and mint yogurt sauce, and most refreshing was the $8 Rodhakino, sliced peaches with a Manouri cheese, purslane, honey-lemon vinaigrette and walnuts. Both jump started us on the hearty entrees that followed.\n\nI had the $25 Kokinisto me Manestra, which was a huge braised lamb shank sitting on a bed of orzo and myzithra. Marinated in a variety of exotic spices, the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. Maggie had the $29.50 Arnisia Paidakia, which were at least three grilled lamb chops bathing in a lemon-oregano vinaigrette and their house potatoes. Even though it took a couple of tries to get the meat to the right juiciness, the effort was worth it.\n\nWe were too sated to have dessert, but Kokkari is like that.

From the outside you'd think it's an average sized restaurant with a small wooden door entrance. In reality the place is HUGE, probably takes up half the block, including a lower level with a beautiful private group dining room. The decor and atmosphere is excellent.. for some reason  we always end up sitting at the large wooden table in front of the fireplace with the bread loaves every single time. Kokkari never ceases to impress; from outstanding service to the outrageously delish/generously portioned fresh food and the rustic feel throughout. \n\nSome of my fav. items include the following:\n\nLamb Burger (i usually opt out for lamb.. but the quality of the ground meat and the way they spiced this burger is unbelievably good)\n\nMelitzanosalata, Taramosalata, Tzatziki, Favosalata or Tirosalata with housemade grilled pita (different kinds of hummus and spread)\n\nLamb or Beef Souvlaki - skewered or sometimes just plated \n\nChar or other fish of the day\n\nYou won't be disappointed.", "author": "Catalina C."}

There are several dilapidated 'tavernas', but the town is neither pretty nor interesting as restaurant's website suggests.  In fact, most of the food on in Samos Island, which Kokkari is located, was disappointing.  I would even venture to say that it is hard to find a restaurant in the entire country of Greece that serves Greek food at the quality Kokkari Estiatorio offers.  Much of the reason maybe due to the excellent quality of ingredients restaurants in California uses, which is not the case in Greece. \n  \nAs for Kokkari in San Francisco, I think the restaurant is placed in a wise location.  It's close enough to the heart of FiDi to draw business lunch crowd, yet slightly set aside in a quiet area.  While it's a useful business meal location, I think it is a bit too expensive for out of pocket dining (unless you think $30+/person for lunch is reasonable).\n\nFOOD:  Don't go here if you don't like olive oil.  My grilled ahi tuna was place on top of a thick layer of olive oil.  Many of their dishes seemed to entangle olive oil.  One of their signature dishes, lamb chops, with just the right amount of seasoning, was very good.  Be aware that they use plenty of garlic.  Dish came with Kokkari potatoes which was very interesting and good.  \n\nHere are some items that were good (lunch prices):\nEpiros Feta ($7.50)\nOctopodaki tou yiorgou ($11.75)\nGrilled ahi tuna ($18.50)\nGrilled Lamb Chops ($25.50)", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

Of course, the restaurant is designed by the award-winning architect Howard Backen of Backen & Gillam Architects. It's a spacious, rustic, but elegant, warm and welcoming Greek (Mediterranean) restaurant that's great for dining in with a big group, or just as a couple for a quality evening. \n\nKokkari Estiatorio is known as a cuisine that is fit for the gods. It is named after a small fishing village on the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea. Kokkari is actually  the sister restaurant of Evvia Estiatorio in Palo Alto, California.\n\nThe legend is that Kokkari is where Orion, son of the Greek god Poseidon, fell in love with the daughter of the King of Chios, and because of his love for her, Orion searched the whole island for food to prepare a banquet. Ahhhh :) LOVE :)\n\nThings we tried:\n\nMoussaka - traditional casserole of eggplant, lamb, potato & yogurt b\u00e9chamel. (It's a traditional dish, but I'm not a big fan of it.)\n\nSpanakotiropita - traditional filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill. (I love anything that is made with filo.)\n\nOctapodaki tou Yiorgou - grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil (nothing out of the ordinary.) \n\nMosharisia Brizola - charcoal-grilled, dry-aged rib-eye with braised greens & Kokkari potatoes (My BF's favorite. His words, \"Their Rib-eye is pretty damn GOOD!)\n\nSokolatina - flourless dark chocolate cake with sweetened whipped cream (I love flourless CAKE!) \n\nKokkari Sundae - chocolate & vanilla ice cream with hot fudge, whipped cream & toasted hazelnuts (The desserts get better! Made my night!!!) :0)", "author": "Sweet P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-28", "description": "After visiting Kokkari thrice in the last year and Greece this past September, I finally feel familiar enough with Greek cuisine to judge it.  The food at Kokkari is indisputably good, but it's the restaurant itself that you will remember.  It feels like a Mediterranean palace--earthy, rustic, old world-charming, and one of the most beautiful restaurants in the Bay Area IMO.\n\nWhile there's something for everyone on the menu and everything on the menu is tasty, nothing is outstanding (to me).  Outstanding is the truffle pasta at Acquerello, the beef tartare at Chez Papa Resto, and the barbecued ribs at Oola.  At Kokkari I'm less impressed with the food than I am with the fireplace, drapes, woodwork, and flowers.  This isn't to say the food isn't enjoyable... because it is.  Believe me.\n\nA few delicious appetizers I've tasted include zucchini cakes, grilled octopus, and beef tongue (a special).  My favorite entr\u00e9e is the moussaka, which appears bottomless and is even better than the ones I've had in Greece!  Kokkari's moussaka renders all other casseroles of lamb, eggplant, and potato irrelevant.  If you MUST have something else, the lamb chops are fork-tender and the ravioli tastes like spring.  For dessert you simply can't go wrong with anything wrapped in filo and topped with cr\u00e8me fraiche.\n\nKokkari can be expensive but worthwhile for a celebration or even for a change of scenery (at times the SF food scene seems too French or too Asian).  Depending on what you order, you could leave paying $25 or $100.  Sure, I could get the best-of-my-life beef kebab for $3 or grilled octopus for $9 in Mykonos, but it doesn't come with Aegean romance and American service--not to mention I'd have to fork over $1000+ for the flight there.  For Greek in SF it doesn't get more godly than Kokkari.  I would love to have dinner here for Valentine's Day.  Haha.  All right, shameless solicitation done.", "author": "Liz T."}

The Tzatziki is thick and marvelous - a fantastic way to begin your dining escapade. Tables are close together throughout the restaurant.

In all seriousness, I ate both and was impressed with both the preparations and the level of perfection at which each were cooked.\n\nFor dessert get the yiaourti me meli (have someone with a Greek accent say this aloud to you for added pleasure).

Came here for dinner on a Tuesday evening with a friend. Here are the highlights\n\nPros:\n* Ambiance is fantastic - has a rustic feel and lighting is perfect for a quiet, intimate dinner. Seating area is huge so it didn't feel crowded\n* Staff is extremely courteous. Our waiter, Frank, was really knowledgeable about the menu and was very patient with our indecision. He also brought us a complimentary dessert at the end when we couldn't choose between two of the options which was really really nice of him!\n* Food - my friend and I were vegetarian so we ordered several appetizers and split them for dinner. Here's the full list:\n- Wine: Pinot Noir and Santorini -- awesome!\n- Kolokithokefthethes (Zucchini cakes) -- I was a little nervous about this because several of the Yelp reviews said they were underwhelming. I actually enjoyed them, especially because the hot deep-fried cakes were paired with a cool yogurt sauce and tangy pickled cucumbers which taken together in one bite was delicious!\n- Spanakotiropita -- I'm a huge fan of this dish in other Mediterranean restaurants and Kokkari did not disappoint! The filo dough was light and crispy and the stuffing was not too rich. I did feel the stuffing was a little on the bland side and could've used some more flavor, but I'm biased since I'm Indian and tend to like things spicier than most.\n- Gigantes -- We were deciding between this dish and the eggplant/artichoke skewers and we chose the heartier option. The tomato sauce is very light and the beans are perfectly baked (I hate overcooked/soggy beans and the beans in this dish were on the firmer side which is what I was looking for).\n- Pikilia (sampler of three of the dips) -- We tried the Melitzanosalata, Tzatziki, and Tirosalata. The Tzatiki was my favorite! It was so creamy and delicious and extremely refreshing given most of the other dishes were hot. The Tirosalata was a feta dip with a tangy twist. It was really flavorful but too salty, which was odd since the rest of the dishes were perfectly salted. The Melitzanosalata was a smoked eggplant dish (basically a chunky baba ganoush) which was very different compared to the other two dips and really yummy! Of course, as the reviews said, the pita was amazing!! It was so thick and soft and cut into bite-size pieces. The pita is really what did it for me with this dish.\n- Dessert: Special - Lemon-filled filo dough pastry served with pistacchio ice cream\n- Dessert: Galaktoboureko (complimentary) -- liked this one more than the special\n\nCons:\n- The food came very quickly (like within 10 min of ordering). We ended up taking our time with it and spent over an hour at the restaurant after the food arrived. Though we didn't feel rushed by the staff at any point, it would've been nice to slow down the service. (for example, we ordered two glasses of wine but we got them after all the dishes had arrived. It would've been nice to start with the wine and have time to enjoy that before the food arrived).\n- Bathroom is so far from the main dining area. You need to take elevators down a floor to the restrooms. This was a little annoying as it meant the other person you were dining with was sitting by themselves for quite a while as you were navigating your way to the restrooms.\n- When we asked our server how much we should order, he recommended 5 dishes served tapas style so we could share. We ended up ordering 4 and had enough leftovers for a second meal the next day. Thank god we didn't go with his recommendation.\n- Literally only ONE option for a vegetarian entree, and considering I'm allergic to mushrooms I had no options at all.\n- Our server also offered to make us a sampler of the three dips. Each dip was $7.5, so I assumed a sampler meant a smaller quantity of each so we could try more of them. It ended up costing us $20 for the sampler platter which is almost equivalent to ordering the three dips separately. The platter was too big for two people to share and though I was happy with the variety, if I had known the quantity and the price, I probably would've opted to just order one dip.\n- The dessert special, that was served with pistachio ice cream, was delicious as long as you had the ice cream to off-set the relatively dry texture of the filo dough pastry. Kokkari was not generous with the ice cream, leaving my friend and I scraping our plate to get every last bite so we could finish the lemon pastry without our mouth drying out. I hate it when restaurants skimp on ice cream, and considering Kokkari's appetizers were all well portioned, I don't know why they held back with dessert :(\n\nOverall: Dinner at Kokkari, though pricey (for two with tip ~$100), was really enjoyable. I do hope they add more vegetarian options (which is the main reason I knocked off a star) but until then, I plan on coming back to try the other dishes I missed!", "author": "Vaibhavi U."}

Wearing a nice suit and Converse All-Stars was all he can do. Just kidding!\n\nShe made reservation and the hostess lead us to our seats, in which we were seated immediately. Not a bad start, would you say?\n\nFor appetizer, we started and shared a plate of grilled lamb tongue with capers and bell-peppers with tasty shallot vinaigrette on a skewer (don't know the name) The Grilled Lamb was very delicate and extremely tender that it melted in our mouths.  For a $9.00 appetizer, it does pack a punch and was a great choice. (Thank you, thank you!)\n\n\nFor the main course, Matt orders the Kokinisto me Manestra, which is a piece of lean lamb-shank covered with the marinated Greek sauce with orzo and sprinkle of myzithra (Greek Cheese) to round out the dinner plate. The $25.00 dinner-plate was what the doctor ordered and faired very nice.\n\nWife ordered the Galeo, which is a thick ass roasted Halibut Steak, and comprised of a fingerling potatoes, Morel Mushrooms and Fava Beans. Her $26.00 seafood plate was very tasty and complimented very well with a tasty glass of $8.00 Greek-wine. \n\nWhat more can you ask for, a perfect and lovely night, although we had trouble pronouncing our plates and other items on the menu, but more importantly we did have a wonderful dinner. Coming to this restaurant can be very pricey, but well worth it for a date and a second visit, in which we didn't have any dessert.\n\nMatt may not be Greek, but you can call him \"Big-Papa!\"", "author": "Matt G."}

I get it - but a little green makes me feel better.  The fish was wonderfully cooked, good flavor but not a knock your socks off experience.  The spiced lamb pie (with eggplant and potato) was good, but not something that I'd want to eat more of than a few bites.  And the lamb shank - it was cooked perfectly, but the seasonings didnt compliment the cut of meat.  Should have ordered the lamb chops.  \n\nNext time, I'll order only the small plates and a salad.

Ask for him if you can. He's professional without being fake or pretentious, and still has a great sense of humor too. He was super attentive although he had to run down the stairs numerous times throughout the night. We saw like ten different waiters serving us different dishes.

Lamb shank or chops would've been a better choice of lamb, since the meat on this cut was quite thick, but the sauce was great along with the potatoes and I'm sure either of those cuts would've been phenominal. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the rice pudding and a special baklava with pistachios and lemon-sage ice cream -amaze!

I think it is the latter.\n\nKokkari is \"ho-hum\" at best.  Nothing about the food screams \"wow\" or justifies the price you pay.  The service and ambiance, however, is quite good.\n\nMy meal began with the  Favosalata (similar to hummus) and the grilled octopus.  The  Favosalata was pretty good, but then again it is easy to get what essentially amounts to bean paste correct.  The grilled octopus was okay.  It was slightly overcooked (making it a bit rubbery) and lacked flavor.  A far far cry from Bottega's grilled octopus (which is amazing if you follow my reviews or have tried both dishes at both restaurants).  \n\nFor my entree I ordered the grilled lamb chops with potatoes as my server informed me that Kokkari had recently gotten some special lambs from a local ranch.  The lamb chops where cooked well but fairly bland.  The potatoes were basically steak fries.  Beyond my three small lamb chops and some steak fries there was essentially nothing else on my plate.  I spent most of my meal sneaking bites from my fianc\u00e9e's beef short-rib pasta which was actually pretty good.\n\nBeing that we were dining with another couple, I also got to try the lamb souvlaki (which was over cooked) and the grilled fish of the night (which was fairly bland).  \n\nAll and all, my dining experience at Kokkari was nothing to remember.

Finally, finally, finally.\nKokkari Estiatorio has been on my mind for a while now and I finally dragged my mom and I over there on January 3rd. I've always loved Mediterranean food, but usually opt for cheaper choices like La Mediterranee, Sunrise Deli or Oasis Grill for my falafel, lamb, or hummus fixes.\nWe made a reservation the day before and headed over there around 11:45am the next morning for lunch. It was nice that it was a weekday and quiet so that we were able to get quick service and have room and time to chat.\nThe ambiance is wonderful- cushiony chairs, a warm fireplace with huge loaves of freshly baked bread, gigantic flower arrangements, dark wood and a glittering full bar.\nWe were promptly seated near the fireplace and brought bread and water. Our service was attentive which I enjoyed, but my mom said it made her feel uncomfortable that they were there right away anytime you needed them! Haha. We had our choice of flat or sparkling water and we also ordered tea. Keep in mind, tea here was 5.00 a pot. We should have just ordered one kind and split it. I got chrysanthemum and mom got sencha.\nFood-wise we decided to get a bunch of different things and share. Lamb riblets were amazing- tiny, tender, and not gamey at all with a little bit of a crisp. Zuchinni cakes were nicely dense, crunchy, and served with a cooling yogurt sauce and cucumbers. The Greek salad was good, but we could have passed on it as it was something I could have made at home- generous chunks of tomato, cucumber, and feta, dressed with slivered red onions, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar. For our entree we shared their moussaka which was amazing!!! Perhaps a bit too heavy and rich for such a warm sunny day and for lunchtime, but nevertheless the portion was enough to share and bring home. A casserole of ground lamb, potatoes, tomato, and eggplant with a wonderful tangy bechemel sauce baked on top. Oh, halfway through we also ordered pita which was grilled, warm, and thick! We were too full for dessert, so I hope the next time I go, I'll be able to taste those!!\nI was worried that lunch would be expensive, but it ended up being quite reasonable at 60.00 for the two of us for lunch. It could even be a great tapas place since they have so many yummy small plates to share.\nOverall, wonderful service, authentic food, and a nicer atmosphere than the usual SF mediterranean joints.

The whole thing just kind of melts inside your mouth. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the Mosharisia Plevra- beef short ribs braised with garlic & red wine vinegar over hilopites hand made pasta. The beef short ribs just falls off the bones and melts in your mouth. You can barely taste the garlic in it, but can definitely taste the red wine vinegar, but it wasn't too over powering. The hand made pasta was just perfect. \n\nHe ordered the Arnisio Souvlaki- spiced lamb skewer. I had a piece of it and it was really soft and you can't taste the lamb at all.

We've also tried the roasted potatoes, which are nice and crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with some subtle lemony flavor. Great complement to your meal.\n\nEntrees: We've tried the oregano roasted chicken. It was well prepared but didn't come with the roasted potatoes like I had seen in some yelp photos (bummer!). We've also had the souvlaki lunch entrees (I had the chicken, he had the lamb). Both were delicious and perfectly portioned for a lunch-sized meal.\n\nDesserts: OMG. Their dessert menu is just about as big as their lunch/dinner menu, and what we've tried so far has been AMAZING! On our first trip we had the greek yogurt with dates, candies walnuts, and honey. It was a light and delicious way to end our meal. On our second visit, we got the baked apple with nuts and cinnamon, with a scoop of baklava ice cream. SO YUMMY!!!!!!\n\nOverall, I would say the food is absolutely delicious and stays true to the Greek culinary tradition. We loved it so much that we bought the Kokkari cookbook...I can't wait to get home and try to recreated some of our delicious Kokkari experience!\n\nNote for next time: Bring some nice clothes (we were just in town for a few days and didn't bring any this time...we felt a little out of place in our jeans!), and make reservations, even for lunch. They get full quickly.", "author": "Ashley S."}

I went with my family just for a special dinner a few nights ago and was so pleased and so full after our meal. The portions were surprisingly large given the prices. I was expecting this place to be like every other restaurant in San Francisco with small portions and high prices. But I was wrong!\n\nI highly recommend the Fried Smelt for an appetizer. The fish are fried perfectly and are soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside. The dipping sauce was like a garlic aioli or something, delicious. We also got the Trio of Dips served with Pita (roe, eggplant, and sweet pea). The pita bread was a little salty for my liking, but the rest of my family loved it. Aside from that it was soft and warm, and paired really well with all 3 dips. \n\nFor the entrees we got the Lamb Chops, Moussaka, Suckling Pig (special) and Goat Stew (special). All had wonderful flavors and the mixture of spices was so different from what I've ever had. However, as good as the dishes were, they weren't perfect. Or maybe I'm picky. The the Goat meat in the Goat Stew was really stringy and chewy, but the flavors were amazing. In addition to that, I wasn't a fan being served essentially french fries with the lamb chops. I like to have some kind of legit grain with my meat.  The Moussake had wonderful flavors but there wasn't much texture so I grew bored of that dish quickly. Luckily there was 4 of us so that means we had 4 entrees to pick from. But again, all the dishes were good and I can see myself going back to order any of those again. Or maybe all! Leftovers are always a plus.\n\nThe dessert was probably my favorite dish the entire meal. We ordered the semolina custard wrapped in filo/phyllo (?) paired with quince and pistachio ice cream. The flavors were so well balanced and not overly sweet. It was very refreshing and I would love to have this recipe to try to make on my own! I don't recommend, I demand that you order this for dessert if you decide to come to Kokkari for a meal! The Greek coffee was also different and delicious, and you should definitely get it with your dessert. \n\nThe servers were also very nice and friendly. Our server, I think her name was Sara/h (or Tara?), was very knowledgeable with the wines and was able to recommend the Hippolyte Reverdy Sancerre 2010 and the Patricia Green 2008 Pinot Willamette Valley. They  both went well with every dish on our table. \n\nAaannnnyyywaaaaaaays. I will definitely be coming here again. Maybe I can convince my parents to take me here for my birthday next year.", "author": "Amanda C."}

But topped with delicious cheese and a variety of mushrooms.  Fresh fish was good, served with yummy roasted vegetables.  Good wine selection. \n\nBest part was the atmosphere and decor.  Open kitchen in the back dining room, and an open grill roasting chickens and hams in the front room.  Comfortable and lively bar, seats about 12.   Two large dining rooms and two private rooms.    Minor annoyance is it is quite a trek to the bathroom.  But the basement is gorgeous.

Lamb riblets were a little oily and adding more oil to them didn't help.  The meat was well seasoned, tender and juicy.  \n\nOn a cold day, ask for a table in the back room.  We were situated close to the fireplace (which was turned off) and the door opening and closing got old quick.  Service was a little slow but the food was good.

I think this is the reason that this restaurant continues to thrive in the economic downturn, while others of its caliber are ostensibly suffering somewhat.\n\nThe only thing I would like to be different is for the entrees to have a little vegetable content on the side, both for enhanced presentation and for the sake of not having to order extra mezes in order to balance what is already a large meal.", "author": "Zain K."}

Nevertheless, i couldn't agree with her more. i love the old fashion, antique but modern decor. The seating area is kinda loud due to many people talking and chilling by the bar but i love the comfortable seats. i felt like a queen sitting in the tall throne type chairs. \n\nOur menu:\nAppetizers:\n1. Kolokithokeftethes (crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing): MY FAVORITE -- soo good especially with the mint yogurt dressing\n2. Kalamari (grilled calamari stuffed with feta, summer beans with black olives): We thought it fried calamari but i was glad we made the mistake because it grilled to perfection. It was kinda salty but still very flavorful. \n\nEntrees:\n1. Arnisia Paidakia (grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes): The lamb chops was perfect especially since i had the lamb medium rare. The potatoes were huge like french fries but again, kinda salty for my pallet. \n2. Moussaka (traditional casserole of eggplant, lamb, potato & yogurt bchamel): Don't be discourage by the portion size but in fact the casserole is filled with lots of lamb, potatoes and eggplant. The BF was stuffed! \n\nTotal cost of the meal: around $90 with drinks.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and never hesitate to refill our drinks. He was really nice and at the end of the meal he surprised me with a complimentary chocolate cake for my anniversary. I assume the BF had something to do with it. Overall, Kokkari made my anniversary very memorable and i cant wait to come back again.  \n\nThe only reasons that prevented me to give Kokkari 5 stars was the saltiness. For some reason some of the food made my lips really dry and plus you have to take the elevator to the bathroom? Plus parking can be a little hard but there is a parking lot nearby or maybe you can get lucky and find street parking. \n\nGreek Food IS LOVE. \n\nKokkari was name the BEST Greek and Mediterranean restaurant in SF by 7x7 Magazine.", "author": "Carol Y."}

Let's start with the decor which on a chilly San Francisco evening is warm and inviting.  We hadn't really eaten all day so decided to try a number of different dishes. Our favorite starter may have been the Aginares Souvlaki (grilled artichokes and eggplant).  Very flavorful, especially when dipped into the accompanying greek yogurt.  Speaking of yogurt, the roasted beets with greek yogurt and pistachio was just as delicious.  We enjoyed the grilled octopus as well but it wasn't quite as good as the other 2 dishes.  The Kokkari Salata was excellent as well.\n\nFor main courses, we shared the rotisserie lamb (a special that night) and the Branzino, which was grilled.  In retrospect, I think I would have enjoyed the lamb skewers more.  The rotisserie lamb was very good and tender but I actually like lamb more with the hint of charcoal that you get with a skewer.

It's quickly become one of our favorites and on our list of restaurants to frequent.  Not only is the food amazing, but the restaurant itself is beautifully designed.  There are multiple large rooms, each with a different feel and ambiance; however they all make you feel as if you're sitting in a big living room.  From my experience, the waiters and hostesses have always been no less than superb and attentive as well.  I truly enjoy everything about Kokkari.\n\nWhile the main dishes are all very good, I've become quite of fan of the appetizers and would recommend trying multiple mezes instead of the entrees; think tapas style dining!  I always make sure to begin with the Taramosalata (whipped caviar) served with housemade pita.  I love tarama and for some reason it's not easy to find in the bay area.  It's so yummy spread all over the warm, soft, and thick house pita.  I'm salivating while writing this.  \n\nAnother one of my favorite mezes is the Grilled Octopus Salad with lemon, oregano, and olive oil.  I've never had Octopus with the same texture.  Usually calamari is chewy, however Kokkari has a way of making their octopus so tender, it literally dissolves in your mouth.  Once again... salivating.\n\nAmong my other favorite mezes are the Kalamata Pita, Kokkari Potatoes, and Wood Oven Roasted Prawns.  The Kalamata is similar to super thin pizza with olives, tomatoes, caramelized onions, and myzithra cheese.   The prawns come dressed in tomato sauce and feta, and the potatoes are nicely seasoned with oregano and lemon and then roasted.  I've never been disappointed with an appetizer so far and they are all decently sized.  The portions are larger than appetizers at other restaurants; I'd advise that 4 would probably enough for a whole dinner for two people.  However, we usually order more than that because there are consistently others we want to try and Kokkari always offers up a nice daily special that usually reels us in.  Last week it was the Veal and Rice Greek  Meatballs and Goat Stew!\n\nThe GF will always order the Avgolemono (traditional egg-lemon soup with chicken & rice) because she loves soup.  I find it to be pretty good, but otherwise wouldn't order it without her.  It tastes like a typical chicken soup with some lemon... that's all I can say.\n\nWe've tried a few of the entrees including a bass special and the goat stew.  They were both very good and I would recommend them to anyone.  The goat stew was crazy!  The meat was nice and tender and soaked in an amazingly flavorful sauce.  However like I mentioned before, I personally will stick with the numerous mezes I can play around with.  Kokkari also always has duck and chicken on a rotisserie in the middle of the main dining room that we still haven't tried but it looks delicious.\n\nThe only thing I would advise against at Kokkari is the Greek Coffee.  They make it sound special by heating over hot stones.  However it's served in such a small espresso cup and about half full of coffee grounds.  My palate is not yet able to distinguish whether this is a very fine coffee, so for now it's not worth my 5 bucks.\n\nOverall, Kokkari is stellar.  From the food to the atmosphere, to the service, this restaurant shines!  I recommend it to anyone and I will continue to haunt this place for many years to come.", "author": "Timothy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-19", "description": "There are several reasons why this place is the awesome. \n\n1. It goes without saying the food is marvelous.  Flavors are clean, simple, and mouthwatering. I don't think there is bad thing on the menu.  Don't leave without having the lamb chops, and they have a decedent fried cheese appetizer (I forget the name) that is wonderful.  Finish it off with one of their marvelous deserts (best fruit tart I ever had) and a rich cup of greek coffee.\n\n2. The service.  A mark of truly quality restaurant is the service. Sure the food can be great but if your service is awful is going to sour everything else. And the service here is above par! Yes the waiters are knowledgable and friendly but its the little things that make the service here great, like always letting the guest go first rather than jumping in front of them just because they're in hurry to get their food out, holding doors, pulling out chairs and always going that extra mile.  Whoever trains the service staff should be proud.\n\n3.Upscale without being stuffy.  The service may be above par, the food divine, and the decor high end but that doesn't mean you have to hold your pinky in the air.  Kokkari still maintains the Greek spirit of love a life and at every table you see people laughing and enjoying themselves.\n\nIn short: if you haven't been, GO!  Run, don't walk!", "author": "V R."}

Made a reservation through OpenTable for 11:45am (before the lunch rush), and we were immediately led to be seated in the main dining room next to the kitchen area. I could have sworn we were greeted hello no less than 5 times from stepping into the restaurant to reaching our table (very impressive). We were seated in the middle of the dining room area and to my right I could gaze out at the gorgeous sunny SF day. What could be better?\n\nOh, how about the Taramosalata, Octopodaki tou yiorgou, Kolokithokeftethes, Moussaka, and Baklava special!!\n\nAlright, so who am I kidding... [translation please]\n\nTaramosalata - dip made with fish roe, served with housemade grilled pita (our waiter's personal favorite). YUM! Amazing smooth texture, incredibly aromatic and perfectly delightful on the thick and warm pita. \n\nOctopodaki - grilled octopus with lemon, olive oil, oregano. This dish seems to be a Yelp favorite and I can see why. I've never ever tasted octopus as tender and fragrant before. Ever! I loved to smother my octopus pieces in the olive oil/oregano/lemon to get all the rich flavors!\n\nKolokithokeftethes - zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint yogurt dressing. Oh hello!! I can eat maybe 10 of these and still not get sick of its fabulousness. They're perfectly seasoned and then add the dressing into the mix... outstanding! One of my faves.\n\nMoussaka - spiced lamb casserole with eggplant, potatoes, and yogurt b\u00e9chamel. We were already pretty full once our shared entree was delivered. The lamb is good (although slightly too salted for me), but what I looooved was the yogurt b\u00e9chamel, this cheesy, slightly aged gooey goodness! The eggplant and potatoes were deliciously cooked.\n\nBaklava special - walnut & honey baklava mixed into vanilla ice cream, also came as our waiter's suggestion. My friend and I politely destroyed the dessert. Simply a-maaazing.\n\nI can't say anything bad about the impeccable service. Everyone was so courteous and helpful, and made sure our first visit was a memorable one. Our water glasses were never less than half empty and I can easily tell the servers and waiters were proud to be serving the great food.\n\nI want to try the whole fish next time, and of course, more appetizer! Kokkari lives up to its hype!", "author": "Jing D."}

So one nice and sunny Thursday afternoon my friend and I decided to meet up there at 6 after work.  She suggested we sit at the bar and get drinks and appetizers.  \n\nI get there and she was having a friendly discussion with the bartender and waiter, she's been there a few times so they knew her.  I asked the bartender to make a suggestion about a wine and he gave me glass of refreshing chardonay.  We began catching up and finally ordered some appetizers.  We got the pitta with a few dipping sauces and lamb meat balls.  Both were great, fresh and truly Mediterranean.  \n\nWe took a break and had another glass of wine that seemed to never end because the bartender kept refilling it, the benefits of making friends.  We then ordered the musaka to  share which was a great idea, it was quite rich.  And topped off with dessert, we got the yogurt with honey and dates and nuts, it was the perfect choice, not too rich or sweet yet satisfying.  \n\nThe atmosphere was great, on this sunny day it shined in and filled the rooms with light and made you feel that you truly were on some shore in Greece or Italy, the food was there to match, the ingredients all fresh, flavorful and like they came from the region.  \n\nDress up when you go here, a lot of people were after work in suits and the rest dressed up.  The restaurant manager also stopped by and talked to us for a while, for such a high end nice place, it was nice to see that he made the time and remembered my name, even though she just introduced me once, this along with the incredible food ensures I'll be back for more.", "author": "Inga W."}

I went here friday night for my birthday dinner with a group of my most amazing friends. \n\nFirst, the reservations where made a week in advance for a party of 5 at a 7:30 table. we amazingly got seats and for that I thank them greatly. We were seated promptly and our waiter was very considerate, well informed, and genuinely seemed to like his job and our table even though we were a group of uncultured college students, most of whom (myself sadly included) had not been to a nice restaurant in several months.\n\nWe started with the zucchini cakes with mint sauce, the octopus and the watermelon feta salad. The zucchini cakes were crisp, subtle, and were liked by even the zucchini haters. The octopus was tender and cooked perfectly (difficult task) and the watermelon salad was refreshing with unexpectedly complementary flavors.\n\nFor entrees we tasted, savored and enjoyed bites of everyone's dishes. The lemon oregano chicken was juicy and flavorful, the feta and artichoke ravioli was very good, but pasta is never spectacular. The halibut was practically melt in your mouth. I ordered the lamb shank which literally fell off the bone. Came with delicious orzo and was some of the most tender meat I've ever had. And, on top of that, everything came in huge portions. Even Josh, the bottomless pit, was full at the end of the meal. That meant the rest of us couldn't move.\n\nThey then embarrassed me by having the waiter bring out a cake with a candle.... how cute. Manager came out to wish me happy birthday. Flourless chocolate cake was super rich and the custard filo pastries were absolutely delicious and contrasted perfectly by the apricots and vanilla ice cream. Fantastic wine and coffee selection to go with everything also and very reasonably priced for the amount and quality of food.\n\nNow one of my absolute favorite SF restaurants. Will return again, I assure you. Five stars for food and ambiance. 6 stars for service and how hilarious it was being the youngest people in the room who weren't there with their parents.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

I've been to Greece, and I think some of the food is not very authentic. Also, the price is a little bit on the pricier range.

(with the saddest frown on my face, hoping the sympathy vote would get us in)  =(\nReceptionist (looking at the computer screen in front of her): Give me a minute and let me check to see if we can find a table for you.\nWaiter next the receptionist gave me a wink: I'm on your side, come with me.\nMe: =D  (replied with the most ridiculous open-mouth smile)\n\nDavid B. was right.  They had the windows wide open for a nice breezy lunch.  As my gf bitched her way about her f'ed up ex, I couldn't help but to shift my attention to the lunch menu.... Oh... today imma do a lamb lunch!\n\nSo I finally got her attention shifted to the lunch menu as well,  we ordered the following:\n\nStarters:\nAsparagus with feta cheese and dill - Yep, again, asparagus over-roasted to perfection with a little olive oil drizzle all over and feta cheese and dill with lemon vinaigrette to complement the sweet asparagus\nGrilled Lamb Tongue Souvlaki - Oh my my my!  Just like the waiter who brought over the lamb tongue said, \"you've got the best dish in the restaurant! Great choice!\"\nGrilled Lamb Riblets - And the riblets, ohh so heavenly grilled to perfection, a slight crunch on the edge of meat mmMMmm... oh joy!\n\nEntree:\nLamb Souvlaki - It was good, grounded lamb meat grilled on wood stick.  The appetizer got me so full already, so I didn't really touch the pita bread that came with the dish.\n\nYou know the food were good when your heart-broken gf stopped bitching about her f'ed up ex and shifted her attention to enjoy the food!

I love lamb and anything else that goes along with it- the herbs, the cheeses (goat especially!), the spices,and all the gamey goodness! Came here with my cousins and brother on a weekday and it was packed. \n\nTo start off, we ordered a bottle of Chateau Julia to share and for appetizers we had the saghanaki and stuffed calamari, for entree we had the lamb shank, lamb chop, lamb special and a whole fish and to end the perfect meal, we shared a Galaktoboureko and a Baklava.\n\nI swear to you, it was a lamb-a-full night!", "author": "Jenny K."}

When we were seated and given the menu, I got very excited once I saw the variety of lamb dishes and other classical Greek recipes. \n\nAppetizers:\n\n- Kalamari: squid stuffed with feta. Four measly pieces of calamari to share between 4 people for $11. You've got to be kidding me. The whole dish was, however, very well prepared and the feta added a great taste to it, but everything was too vinegary\n\n- Pork feet and cheek mix. Can't find the actual name of this dish on the website, but for $13, it was so-so. It was quite an interesting dish to try but had no real taste in it. The meat was pretty tender like how pork cheek should be, but once again everything was covered in vinegar.\n\nMain dish: Lamb Chops. This where it went down the drain for me. First of all, I asked for well done, just how real lamb chops are always served in any normal Mediterranean restaurant. I get my dish, and it's completely red inside. So, I call the waitress over and here's our conversation:\n\"I asked for well done.\"\n\"Ok....\" *Long pause and stare*\n\"Does this look well done to you?\"\n\"I don't know. I can take it back and have them cook it some more\"\n\"Yes thank you.\"\nAfter that, I get my dish and even though they grilled it some more, some pieces were still pretty red. I decided to just let it go and finish. I have to admit the lamb chops were huge in size, which was probably why they couldn't thoroughly cook it. However, the taste just SUCKED. It seemed like they just threw it on the grill with no marination whatsoever, covered it in vinegar, and served it. And you expect me to pay $31 for that? NO THANK YOU!\n\nIn the end, I had to gulp down a good amount of water to get all the vinegary taste out of my mouth. The lamb chops aren't worth it, and neither is the service. Our waiter's attitude just seemed to be very fake the whole time. \n\nDo yourself a favor. Go to a nice hole in the wall Persian restaurant and get some real lamb chops for half the price.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

Growing up with a Greek dad and a Spanish mom, it's hard for me to eat Mediterranean food because it's never \"as good as mom's\" as they say. This was even better. \n\nFor appetizers we got the crispy fried smelt with a lemon garlic dip-- these were just as good as you get in the little shacks on the Mediterranean coast. Undetectable bones, perfect batter, creamy tangy sauce.... I could have just had these with a cold beer and been happy! \n\nWe also got the zucchini cakes, which were perfectly golden and crispy on the outside, and soft and creamy on the inside. These were served with a cucumber Greek yogurt sauce which was the perfect refreshing accompaniment. \n\nFor entrees we enjoyed the Moussaka and the Lamb Shank.... I can say nothing but good things about both entrees. The Moussaka was so beautifully spiced, the Greek yogurt bechmel was delicious, and the lamb so tasty and not gamy at all. Same goes for the Lamb Shank-- perfect fall-off-the-bone meat with wonderful spice and flavor, and a rustic tomato based orzo pasta. Dessert was baklava ice cream. Crush up baklava and whip it together with homemade ice cream-- how can you go wrong? \n\nI will definitely be back, and will be so torn to order the exact same thing or try some of the other wonderful sounding choices we saw on the menu.", "author": "Laura L."}

The restaurant was lovely and the food was pretty solid. Some of my friends were so impressed with the food that they were willing to make a second trip back to Kokkari for lunch.\n\nWe ordered everything on the menu and it was amazing. Each dish embodied all the ingredients and flavors that was used. A few friends ordered the following:\n\n** Braised lamb shank with orzo & myzithra: $28 - This dish was so aromatic and delicious. (I'm not a huge lamb fan b/c all of the lamb dishes that I've tasted tended to be a little gamey but not this dish). It was actually really tender and tasted exactly like beef.\n\n**ravioli of sweet peas & feta with mushrooms & cheese: $21 - My friend ordered this dish and wasn't too satisfied with it. There were about 5 ravioli's in the dish and she left still hungry.\n\n**Galeos - pan roasted Pacific halibut steak with sweet corn, fresh tomato & olive sauce: $25.5 - This was delicious and ooh so tender. The fish was super flakey and buttery and the portions were just right. \n\n** They had a pork shank that was amazing. It was a daily special so hopefully they add it to the menu. The pork was a little salty but nontheless the best dish on the table. \n\nPros: Food, Service, Ambiance, Decor, Drinks\nCons: Price, Bathroom is located on the bottom floor of the restaurant (you have to take an elevator to get there).", "author": "Janet T."}

Taramosalata, stuffed squid, lemon soup... the fish... \nThe lamb riblets are straight out of OHMAGAWW!

Ouzo is this incredibly strong liquorish tasting beverage, and when it interacts with ice, it turns milky. It is best served cold, because it's too strong otherwise.\n\nWe moved to a booth ,and had some small plates to start. Every time I go to a Greek restaurant, the first thing I order is the taramosalata,a Greek caviar spread that bursts with creamy fresh sea flavor. That usually is a good indicator of how good the chef is. The plate came, and it was delicious though I think the best I've had yet is in Chicago Greektown's  Santorini. \n\nIn anycase, the plate was great, along with the eggplant spread and the garlic yogurt spread. I highly recommend the eggplant!!\n\nWe ordered some kind of fish dish. I know i liked it, but by now I'm probably on my 3rd glass of wine, so the good vibe and conversations took over.\n\nThe staff and server were extremely friendly and wonderful. They very personable and great servers.\n\nThe decor is amazing.

My 5 friends and I, all ladies, went here on Saturday night before we hit the town and let's just say that the people are super old and conservative.

It's a small affair, only 15 people. I have been on the phone with Kokkari 4 times in the last week each time speaking to a woman named Joanie. Joanie is not helpful or accommodating, she gives the impression that a larger party is an inconvenient hassle not a boon, she doesn't return my calls when promised and -- most annoyingly -- she talks over you while you're talking. How can you hear what I'm requesting if you are talking while I am? Her tone is not conciliatory when she has to decline a request, and gives the \"Well, we're a busy restaurant\" line which - frankly - applies to a ton of places who have the good sense not to actually say that to a customer.\n\nAfter a week of phone calls and, finally, an authorization from her manager that, yes, it is okay if we dine here, we finally have a reservation at the only time that wasn't 5:30pm. We're booked at 8:45pm.  \n\nMy point of writing this is that it struck me that even the process (and here I really mean *process*) of booking a reservation is an indicator of how the actual dinner may go. Joanie has successfully given me enough pause to hold my reservation while looking for other options because I lack confidence in our being seated on time, and the demeanor and warmth of those interacting with us. If this were just my husband and me, it wouldn't be so weighted but for an important event like a retirement it causes some hesitation.\n\nIn short - if you have a small party, avoid calling and just use Open Table to book. This place is not good for large groups (even at the Kouzina, which I requested.)\n\nI really hope I take back everything I've said because the dinner was so amazing, but just these four calls have already made me look at Kokkari askew.", "author": "Jeffrey+Kathi A."}

We had the halibut steak, artichoke salad, chicken, and peach salad (4 items), and each one of them were light and flavorful, but fell a few notes short of spectacular. Everything felt a little under seasoned, and needed more flavors to come out. The fish felt a little one dimensional, though it was cooked perfectly. The heirloom tomato and peach salas was heaven on a plate. Absolute perfect, a must try!\n\nAverage: \n~4 stars \n\nDefinitely worth a try if you are in the area. The price isn't as expensive as you'd think. Our four entree dishes came out with tax+tip to only $78.", "author": "Kevin D."}

Not tough, cooked perfectly, very clean taste), halibut (so tender and a generous portion), moussaka and vegetarian ravioli.\n\nService could have been a bit better.  Our waiter seemed a bit brash, almost unhappy to have been dealing with us, even though we weren't rowdy or annoying (I didn't think so anyway).  We picked up on some slight attitude a couple of times, but I do appreciate that they didn't charge for a cake cutting/serving fee, and were nice enough to plate each slice and serve it with what tasted like a chocolate sambuca drizzle.\n\nPrices seem on par with what you would pay at any other fine establishment in the city, and I would say portions are about average (though I found the fish to be a good amount).

Largely because I ate so many time (20+) at the Palo Alto sister restaurant which in the end is just better. So this place was a disappointment as a result.\n\nThe veggie souvlaki plate with eggplant and artichoke was well done, and I enjoyed it. That said, it was quite light on the amount of eggplant and the artichoke was not cooked as well as I had expected.\n\nThe chicken souvlaki plate was a HUGE disappointment. Not all the chicken pieces were cooked to the same consistency. The plate size was FAR too small for a good lunch portion in my opinion. And again, it was just not as good as the one in Palo Alto.\n\nThe highlight was the after dinner Greek coffee (it was $5 and I forget what it was called.

I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a while, I finally make it there and my experience just killed it for me.\n\nWe made reservations for 845p, but somehow the restaurant lost our reservation and we were nowhere in their system.  The hostess swore we were the third party in line and would be seated right away...NOT! We ended up waiting 45 minutes before getting seated. I was growing more and more bitter by the minute but the restaurant was kind enough to offer us some wine and olives on the house for the mistake. I reminded myself to be open minded about the food.\n\nFinally seated and starving, we ordered some zucchini cakes and spanakopita appetizers. Both were delicious but honestly, didn't taste any different from ones I've had before. For dinner, we ordered the ravioli with sweet peas and mushrooms and moussaka. The ravioli was awful, had absolutely no taste whatsoever. I've never had to put salt on my dinners before, this was a first. I felt like I was eating a garden. The moussaka was MUCH better, definitely loved the decadence of it, the tender lamb and hints of cinnamon. It was delicious. We ordered the galaktoboureko for dessert, basically custard filled phylo dough with some creme fraiche ice cream. It was light and delicious. \n\nSo everything minus the ravioli was ok, I was going to write off Kokkari as a not too bad experience until the bill came. They charged our party of 3 extra for each appetizer. No one told us that the appetizers came in pairs and no one told us that they would charge us for extra pieces. Our waiter failed to mention that he would take it upon himself to order an additional piece for us. You don't know until the bill shows and extra charges are automatically applied...who does that?!?! \n\nI had already been at the restaurant a total of 2.5 hours at that point and was eager to leave.

Every dish was phenomenal and I recommend everything that I've tried so far, which include:\n\nWine:\nSobella (Pinot Noir)- YUM!\n\nAppetizers:\n1) Dolmathes- grape leaves stuffed with rice, dill, and mint\n2) Grilled octopus\n3) Traditional Mediterranean spreads with homemade pita bread (you can pick 3 spreads and we picked caviar, yogurt cucumber, and an eggplant spread)\n\nI tried octopus for the first time at Kokkari. I was afraid that it would be chewy but it was actually very tender and grilled to perfection! It has become my favorite appetizer here, hands down.\n\nThe spreads were delicious and my favorite one was the cucumber yogurt one. There's definitely enough to feed a group of people. Unlike traditional pita bread, the pita bread here is REALLY THICK, but oh so fluffy and soft! (Oh, and FYI: the spreads come with 2 dolmas and cucumbers!)\n\nEntrees:\nI tried the Psari Psito, which is the traditional whole fish. It changes daily, so ask your server for the daily special. i've had the Mediterranean sea bass and a flaky white fish.\n\nThe whole fish comes filleted so there are very little bones (maybe like 2 small ones). The fish is moist and light and comes with a side of braised greens or oven roasted potatoes. I've tried both and I recommend getting the potatoes, which are perfectly seasoned and they complete the dish.\n\nMy co-workers got a variety of items, including:\n1) Avgolemono (egg lemon soup with chicken and rice)\n2) Pan roasted Pacific halibut steak\n3) Grilled spring lamb organ meats and Kokkari potatoes \n4) Lamb stew\n5) Summer vegetarian ravioli \n\nAlthough this place is pricy (expect to shell out about $50/person), all the elements come together to make this meal worth every dollar. You pay for the experience AND the food, both of which are unforgettable. It was one of the best meals we've ever had and a great way to spend our first paycheck!", "author": "Krystie M."}

I used OpenTable and was able to get a 1:30 reservation on a Friday.\n\nI had two appetizers:\n\nGrilled Octopus:    \nIt was tender and delicious, with a large wedge of lemon that I squeezed all over it. The oregano was not overpowering, and the olive oil used in this dish was nutty and flavorful in a good way. Overall, I loved it and will definitely go back and order it again. It came out a bit less warm than I would have liked...like, lukewarm. So that lost Kokkari some star-cred, but it was still very, very good.\n\nDolmades:\nI love dolmas and eat them all the time (kind of a dolma connoisseur). I wanted a little something besides the octopus and chose the dolmas as a healthy and delicious choice and because they had gotten mostly very good reviews. They were just okay--not as flavorful as I would have liked and I needed to add salt. Not great, and certainly not worth $7 for 4 of them. Next time I'll try the zucchini cakes that everyone raves about. \n\nIt took 5 minutes or so before my waiter came by--not really so great at an upscale establishment. The octopus was really, truly excellent, despite the temperature issue, which is why this restaurant still gets a 4. I'll be back.\n\nOther Notes:\n\n-Very loud at 1:30pm. \n-Restaurant is large with open floor plan and several rooms.\n-Extensive wine list\n-You need to take an elevator one floor down to get to the restrooms", "author": "Kate M."}

Not sure I'll be back again to see what the third time is like, however.\n\nWent there for lunch and I was surprised at how snoot-a-roo the place was. I mean, to have the host and waiter talking down their noses at you is a bit much, no? Must one have a steely and condescending attitude in order to deal with the hoity-toity, all day, every day? Well, maybe. But it didn't jive with me. \n\nOur waitress was nowhere to be found for our first 15 minutes there, and I didn't exactly have the time to take a leisurely few hours for our meal. Took an enormous effort to flag down another waiter to ask questions and hear about the specials, and then to flag down our waitress to take the order. Really? If I hadn't been with company and on a time schedule I would've walked out. \n\nOn to the food. Tuna Souvlaki was great. Saganaki, great. Spanakotiropita, not good at all. Very, very little filling, all flake - dry and tasteless. Overall, not worth the price. Tuna, yes, the rest, no. That's all I got. Didn't have much time to savor the food as we were rushing to eat and make it out the door to our next appointment. And we gave ourselves an hour and half. C'mon, that should be plenty of time for lunch, it just requires your waitress to actually show up and do her job. \n\nNow that I've written it all down, yeah, I'm not going back.", "author": "C J."}

The staff can sometimes be a bit overwhelmed and aloof.\n\nBut, as always, outstanding food will keep me coming back and Kokkari somehow keeps a steady focus on serving traditional Greek cuisine with a homemade touch in spite of any flaws.  Take the fried cheese app for example- a sharp, strong cheese, fried and garnished with olive oil, lemon, and parsley.  Simple, yet unlike anything I've ever had.  The whole fish could not be more expertly cooked- bursting with flavor from skin to bone, fresh, and just the right texture.  For the carnivores, the lamb is a hearty portion yet somehow melts in your mouth.  Pair any of these dishes with a selection from an outstanding wine list.", "author": "Mike B."}

Finally got a chance to go there yesterday since a friend was in town visiting.  \n\nSeveral months ago my gf's and I walked by here after leaving 5a5 and saw Gavin Newsom with his entourage having dinner there.  Never knew the name of the place until yesterday.  My gf made reservations and told me the name of the restaurant but didn't realize till I walked up that it was the same place.  \n\nThe waitress was very attentive.  Showed me to our table and came back within 2 mins to ask if I was ready to order a drink.  I started my evening with a mojito and it was made to perfection.  just how I like it!  The brought a basket of sour dough bread and foccacia and also a side of butter and a mixture of olives.  We started off with Grilled Octopus stuffed with Oregano and Grilled Artichoke Hearts/Eggplant skewers.  They were both very tasty.  My favorite of the 2 was the skewers but that's just because i love grilled veggies.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the rib eye cooked medium rare, my gf ordered Lamb Chops and the other one halibut.  All 3 of the dishes was absolutely delicious.  I think the rib eye is one of the best one's I've had in SF.  Cooked right to med rare, very juicy and tender.  The portion size of the rib eye is great  It was served with braised greens and yummy potatoes.  Everything on my plate complimented eachother.  Def worth every $.  \n\nFor dessert we ordered Galaktoboureko - semolina custard in filo with Meyer lemon spoon sweet & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream.  Very light and crispy and not overly sweet.  Glad we decided to go with that one.\n\nI can't wait to come back here again.  There's so many things on the menu that I want to try.

We walked in and were warmly greeted by the hostess and seated by the host at a table for four.

It looks as if the building was built after the 1906 earthquake, but I don't know its history.  A huge fieplace dominates one wall and as we were leaving we noticed a lamb being roasted on a spit over the fire.  By tonight the restaurant will be redolent of lamb.\n\nWhen Anna and Marian arrived we looked at the menus and the consensus was to order a variety of starters to share.  Rinky knew she wanted spanakotiropita and I knew I wanted lamb riblets.  To that we added zucchini cakes w/ cucumber and mint yogurt dressing, Kokkatri potatoes roasted w/ lemon and oregano, brussels sprouts roasted w/ bacon and lemon, Grilled asapargus w/ feta.  I saw they had skordalia as a side w/ a couple of the dishes so I asked if we could get it as a side by itself and we could.  We decided to get a bowl of the avgolemono to share too.  Marian, Anna and I ordered iced tea and Rinky ordered lemonade.  Refills of both were freely given.  Bread was brought to us and we were offered a choice of butter or olive oil and chose the latter.\n\nThe spanakotiropita came, two large, crisp triangles of filo filled w/ chopped spinach and feta.  It was as described, closer to tiropita than spanakopita;  it was very good.  The zucchini cakes were crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, nicely seasoned and good sized.  The mint yogurt sauce was a good addition.  The slices of cucumber tasted as if they'd been marinated in lemon juice w/ a little olive oil.  Delicious. The asparagus were beautifully cooked and very tasty, as were the brussels sprouts.  The potatoes were crispy and flavorful.  The lamb riblets were tender and flavorful, a generous portion of 10 or 11, sufficient for the 3 carnivores among us to have a good amount.  The skordalia was richer than I expected, as if mayonnaise was added to the potatoes, garlic and almonds.  It came w/ hot, thick triangles of pita-like bread and the biggest slice of cucumber I think I've ever seen.  Only the avgolemono was a little disappointing, lacking a strong lemon note.  We were glad we ordered one bowl for all of us to taste, rather than a whole bowl for any of us.  It was pleasant, just not lemony.\n\nThe bathrooms were all the way in the back of the restaurant, which is huge.  An elevator, whose floors and walls were lined w/ distressed wood, took us to the basement, where the bathrooms were spacious and warm w/ wood and plaster walls w/ alcoves for lamps and pieces of pottery.  The look was lovely and consistent w/ the rest of the restaurant.\n\nDespite all that delicious food, we wanted a little taste of dessert, so we ordered a single galaktoboureko, semolina custard in filo with Meyer lemon spoon sweet & cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche ice cream.  It was just the taste we wanted .  Service was warm and attentive.  We were delighted and I will introduce Alan to it one of these days for dinner.", "author": "Toni M."}

We had heard great things about this place and couldn't wait to try it. \nBeing Greek and growing up on traditional Greek food, we knew this place would have to really live up to it's expectations to get this kind of review...and it definitely did! The top 3 awesome things we experienced:\n1. Ambience-we first got here and it was homey feeling and packed with a classy crowd. \n2. Service- Everyone from the door to our waiter, to other waiters were so generous and accommodating. My boyfriend needed to use the restroom (twice) and was walked down (through elevator etc) to the restroom. Such service! We also got a nice Galatoboureko treat for our anniversary!\n3. FOOD!!- AMAZING. We shared the octopus, calamari, saganaki and xoriatiki salata to start. All there just melted in our mouths! The seafood was fresh, cooked very traditionally (grilled not fried) and was delicious. We ended the night with some of the best lamb chops i have ever had! \n\nI will definitely be going back here, as i have a lot more on the menu to try!

Thankfully our server ended up having a nice personality and the entire service went very smooth..no mess ups/no forgotten anything..so i was happy with that....\n\nSooo it doesn't seem so hard right, get good ingredients, season them and cook them right...\n\nI have to start off with the fact that we went here for LUNCH on Tuesday...which typically as anyone knows who works in the industry it may not be the best time to get the best food at any restaurant...anyway, we went.\n\nFor starters i think our server was a little put off in the beginning that he had a younger couple not in business attire. We stuck out like a blistered thumb lol we were dressed up nice too...but not in boring black pants/skirt and a white button-up...\n\nSO we ordered:\nLamb meatballs, Grilled Octopus, Saganaki, Souvlaki special and Halibut...\n\nMeatballs: Tasty...not hard and overcooked, seasoned well and had great flavor, must have been marinated before? The sauce was also very good...probably made the dish...\n\nGrilled Octopus: I personally didn't like the meaty texture of the Octopus...but that is a given considering what part of the Octopus they were using...i really enjoyed the lemon olive oil concoction that they were swimming in though--later on dipped my lemon potatoes in it and they were perfect!\n\nSaganaki: I really just wish they flamed this @ the table because you have to eat it as hot as possible. AND wish they served Pita with it...never had it without Pita served on the side...\n\nSouvlaki: The PITA here is the best i have had in the city...seriously. The overall flavor of the souvlaki was good..but the meat was not as moist as it could have been(AKA over cooked) and it wasn't even seasoned...sooo even pork that should always taste like delicious heaven tasted bland and hard. \n\nHalibut: OVERCOOKED...sent back : ( sorry...but not worth eating...\n\nAll in all i would give Kokkari another try....maybe mid summer when all veg/fruit is at it's peak and for dinner service.....hope it is better! : )", "author": "Sarah F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-18", "description": "Went here for my Grandma's surprise birthday dinner as a party of 11. We went on a Friday night at around 5:30pm. \n\nThat night, I experienced one of the best services I have ever had at any restaurant. First of all, our waitress knew almost every detail about every item on the menu. She also knew every little detail about their specials that day. Just hearing her explain the specials influenced about 3 of us to give it a try. Apart from knowing more than she needed to know about the menu, she was really kind.\n\nI have to give credit to the entire restaurant's staff. Our waters were never empty. We never asked for a single refill. After our appetizers, the waiters would clean up our plates and utensils and then set up the table specific to each individual's order. For example, my aunt received a steak knife and a fork because she had ordered the rib eye while I received a different type of knife and a fork because I had ordered their quail. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but the amazing thing is that these waiters did not take our orders yet they still knew what to give the entire family quickly and flawlessly. \n\nI based my five star rating off of the service alone, but the food was excellent as well. Our family ordered the calamari. Because I am used to having my calamari fried, I almost refused to eat it when it had arrived on our table. I am glad I gave it a try. It was grilled and stuffed with feta on top of some sort of beans. Super delicious. For my main entree, I had the Ortikia, which was the feta stuffed grilled quail served with a few vegetables and potatoes. Delicious. It was my first time eating quail so I was a little nervous, but it tasted just like chicken. Plus it looked cool having two small quails on my plate. I also had the opportunity to try my aunt's rib eye. Absolutely amazing. One of the top 3 steaks I have ever eaten in my life. Full out of my mind, I sat back in my chair to rest myself. Then I saw one of their desserts on the counter which was ready to be brought out. I immediately desired to order it and my entire family stared it down. It was the Kokkari Sundae. Chocolate and vanilla ice cream served with whipped cream, hot fudge, and toasted hazelnuts. My family ordered 3 of those. I ordered their Baklava served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Absolutely amazingly extremely delicious.\n\nThe restaurant gave my Grandma a complimentary Kokkari sundae with a candle on it. A man who appeared to be the manager of the restaurant approached my Grandma and held her shoulders wishing her a happy birthday as well as thanking the entire family for celebrating at their restaurant. This was the first time I have seen a manager do this and this made me happy.\n\nEven though this restaurant was pricey, my family had an amazing dinner. The service was perfect and the food was delicious. The staff I will definitely come back just as long as I have the money for it.", "author": "Mark Q."}

Many of the 'must eat' joints are pricey, with one or two dishes that really stand out. I am really tired of a lot of those places, finding many of them overpriced and inconsistent. Then there's Kokkari, a restaurtant I've read about for years, but visited for the first time last night. With Kokkari things are different. Kokkari is on your 'must eat' list because you must eat there. Trust me. It's nothing less than a necesscity. \n\nThe dining room was large (in fact there were more than one of them). There was a wooden aesthetic, wooden blanks on the walls, making the environment cozy and warm. Even the elevator had this decor! \n\nMy date and I sat down in the second dining room. It was full of people. Our server came up to us several time. I had a lot of trouble figuring out what to get and how much was too much to eat, and he helped us through the whole thing. We decided to get several appetizers and one entree. Here's what we ordered:\n\nZucchini Cakes - with cucumber and mint yogurt dressing\nGrilled Octopus\nGrilled Lamp riblettes\nGigantes - Oven baked beans with marinara and feta cheese\n\nGoat Soup\n\nThe Zucchini Cakes came first.. Upon first bite I was amazed by the thick creamy texture of the yogurt. Later I asked the server about that and he told me that it was made the tradional Greek style and that it was hung. It was sensational and the lightly fried cakes were also flavorful and perfect with the yogurt. Truly these were blissful bites. \n\nThen came the octopus (we originally ordered calamari, but they ran out. Such a smooth texture, very lightly flavored. I think the texture, rather than the marinade did it the most justice. I wish it had been a little more charred. Nevertheless, it was still damn good. The lamb riblettes came next. They fell off the bone, fell apart in your mouth like liquid. My date loved these, I wish they were a little more juicy, but I still thought they were tassssty. The beans came last. They were sizzling hot. I took a bite, and had a foodgasm. I love white beans and with marinera and Kokkari's potent feta (unlike any I've had) I was in heaven. The feta truly is extrodinary. Fortunately it was also in the goat souuup....\n\nI haven't had meals much better than the goat soup in my life. I thought that the appetizers would be the prime of the meal. I was wrong. The goat soup was mind blowing. MIND BLOWING. I kept telling my date, \"Do you realize you took me on one of the best dining experiences of my life?\" He didn't seem to register how important this was, but let me tell you, it was important! Not only were there succulent piecs of goat, feta cheese and artichoke delicious, there was also a cinnamon nutmeg flavoring that gave the whole dish this amazing savory-sweet taste that made me feel like my mouth would explod. I was in a state of complete delightment. If this is hedonism, give me more!\n\nWe got a lemon dessert with pistachio ice cream. This was not my favorite part. I wish I had something else, but it was nothing to cry about, nor was my dessert wine. \n\nDid I also mention that we got a bottle of wine? It was pretty good, but not the best I've had. I was expecting a little better for this restaurant. In spite of this, and anything else I've complained about though you must go here. It is without a doubt incredible. I will definitely be back, and you should check it out too.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

I ordered the grilled octopus- seasoned well but a few pieces were not cooked properly and were almost gooey.

Our VP selected 9 different dishes for a set dinner and everything was superb. I'm definitely taking K here on our next special occasion.\n\nThe scene:\n\nThe interior is very rustic, very Mediterranean. With dim lighting and a giant cozy fireplace, Kokkari makes for a perfect date spot. We sat in an intimate private room towards the back with 20 or so coworkers. Everything visual about this restaurant is perfect.\n\nService was a little on and off for me. The waiters were very kind, but they kept hitting me on the head with the serving platters as they were serving each person around the table. One waiter even spilled a drop of tomato sauce on my lap from the meatball appetizer. Thank goodness my napkin was on my lap! He apologized and gave me an extra meatball to make up for it.\n\nThe food:\n\nThe food was outstanding! The only thing I didn't try was the Greek salad which consisted of tomatoes and cucumbers. It looked amazing, but I couldn't get myself to eat it because of the tomatoes.\n\nKokkari Patates (oven roasted potatoes with oregano & lemon) - Wow, these were amazing. I never thought I'd love fries this much. The potato wedges were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.\n\nSoutzoukakia (grilled meatballs with tomato & green olive compote) - The meatballs were tender and juicy. It literally fell apart in my mouth once I popped it in. Good thing I got that second meatball!\n\nMelitzanosalata, Taramosalata, Tzatziki, Favosalata or Tirosalata with housemade grilled pita - The first dish on the table was the pita and dip platter. I was hooked on the Melitzanosalata which is a puree of eggplant and spices. I love eggplant, especially when it's turned into a smooth, creamy dip and paired with a warm fluffy pita bread.\n\nHoriatiki (classic Greek salad of tomato, cucumber, bell pepper, onion, oregano, olives & feta) - I think I might've offended the waiter when I told him I didn't want any salad. No offense to the restaurant, I just don't eat tomatoes!\n\nMakaronia (ravioli of winter nettles with mushrooms, pine nuts & feta) - This is probably one of the best raviolis I've ever had. I'm a big fan of nettles. Nettles are a kind of leafy vegetable that's been growing popular in restaurants within the last couple of years. The mild flavor of the nettles paired with the crumbled feta, crunchy pine nuts and creamy sauce made for a great contrast.\n\nArnisia Paidakia (grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes) - WOOOOW! This was the best rack of lamb I've ever had. The meat was so tender, the knife cut through it like butter. The strong aroma and flavors of lemon and oregano were so Greek and so perfect for lamb. When I come back with K, I'm getting this dish.\n\nKotopoulo Souvlas (lemon-oregano chicken with roasted root vegetables & Kokkari potatoes) - I never order chicken when I go out just because... it's chicken! It is so simple and can often be dry. I was amazed when I cut through this yogurt marinated chicken. It was so juicy and flavorful, I couldn't believe it was chicken!\n\nSokolatina (flourless dark chocolate cake with sweetened whipped cream) - This may surprise you, but another WOW goes to this dish. This was a mixture of heavy, rich, smooth, creamy, chocolaty goodness. It was almost like eating pure chocolate ganache. The cake just melted in my mouth from the heat of my tongue.\n\nTurkish Coffee - The wait staff were taking after meal drink orders and someone shouted, \"They have Turkish coffee!\" In a spur of the moment, I said, \"I'll have one of those!\" Little did I know Turkish coffee is the strongest coffee out there. After one sip, I could just feel the jolt of caffeine run through my blood stream. At 9:30 at night, I regretfully put the coffee down and let that $6 tiny cup of coffee go to waste.", "author": "Sam L."}

Let's start with the ambiance... in my opinion; the establishment is broken down to three areas of the restaurant. You got the front, where they also have their full bar located, and the furniture are home-style, comfortable and provide a sense of hospitability. Oh, did I forget to mention the big fireplace? In the back is their big dining room and where the big kitchen is located too. They have a couple long public dining tables, but they are happy to move you if you're looking for something a little more intimate. The furniture here is more modern, but still very cozy. Lastly, the final part of the restaurant is downstairs. It's a private room, and is also where their snazzy restrooms are located. You have to catch an elevator to go downstairs. You might want to keep that in mind the next time you're looking for some stairwell to go downstairs.\n\nNext, let's talk about how delicious the food here is. Greek food is never is easy to come by, but it doesn't seem like you can go wrong with any item here. I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and I was not disappointed in anyway. For lunch, I ordered the chicken souvlaki, and the portion was huge for such a great price. Not to mention how delicious it was. It was savory and kept me loving every bite. If you're wondering if I finished it, yes, yes I did. It was so good, I had to come back for dinner, where I tried their moussaka, which was a casserole of spiced lamb, eggplant, potato and yogurt b\u00e9chamel. Now, I admit, I never had this before so this was a dish I was experimenting with, which pass with flying colors. I would definitely order this again.\n\nWith all my dinner meals, of course, there's always got to be some wine involved which they have a great selection of. I give this restaurant some really great marks and I believe you will too. HAPPY EATING!", "author": "Rob B."}

(But, as I've explained before, my wife's lamb chops are out of this world so it's probably all for the best.)\n\nWe were lucky to get a reservation as this place is very popular these days.\n\nHad some amazing appetizers -- octopus, brussel sprouts (with bacon), grilled calamari, and some flatbread with the restaurant's signature spreads.  Yum yum.  Apparently everything tastes better when you give it a funny name!\n\nLamb, lamb, chops, and fish.  The four of us were very happy.  I loved that the restuarant gives you a \"have it your way\" experience on the fish.  Want it served completely \"sanitized\"?  OK, we'll remove the head and tail and filet it for you all in advance of bringing to the table.  Want to cut it up yourself?  OK, we'll let you do that, too.\n\nDessert?  Of course.  Baklava, Baklava Ice Cream, Baklava Ice Cream, and some sort of greek version of a profiterol (ended up not being that great).  Baklava ice cream is pretty darn good.   I also didn't think the greek coffee was that good.  Tempted to say that was just personal taste but I have had turkish coffee that I thought was very good.  Soooo.....who is really to blame here, folks?  Either Kokkari blew it on my coffee or they have to admit that turkish coffee is better than greek coffee.\n\nDespite the waiter's warning, I accidentally ate the clove that was stuck in the top of my baklava.

The place was starting to get crowded but the staff was courteous, attentive, and professional. The place is definitely larger than you would expect from the outside but that goes to describe just about any establishment in SF. \n\nOur waiter was quick to give us the rundown of the daily specials and provided us with as much time as we needed to decide with no pressure. Bread, olives, and water came right away. \nWe both got a glass of wine and it was quite a generous pour that lasted me throughout the night beyond desserts too. \nAppetizers were Dolmathes and calamari. Both delicious with great flavor. The dolmathes were fresh and  just the right texture. The calamari was freshly grilled stuffed with flavorful feta and sat on a bed of shaved fennel and something else that added to the overall dish. They were stuffed small squids, not the sliced rings you typically think of when you think calamari.\n\nMy husband got the highly recommended lambchops and it certainly lived up to expectation. The portion was generous for the price and even the potato slices that came with it were perfectly cooked and seasoned. My sea bass that was just grilled and seasoned with olive oil, lemon, and simple herbs was delicious. Not the typical fatty sea bass but the mediterrenean kind that is slimmer but packs a lot of fish goodness.\n\nFor desserts, we got a fig tart with pistachio ice cream, and baklava with a hazelnut vanilla ice cream. The baklava was delicious and lighter, not as sweet as the common one sold outside, and just a great ending. The fig tart was really yummy but the pistachio crumbs on the side was a little too salty and contradicted the fig tart a little too much. Other than that, it was wonderful.\n\nOverall, a delicious meal at a great restaurant with a loud but homey ambiance. Many families seem to dine there with large groups of people so I think it's a great place for families to go. Not really for little kids though.", "author": "Carol L."}

They let us chill at our table w/ some olives while waiting for a party which was very nice of them since most establishments get pissy when ur late and are incomplete.\n\nThe decor had a warm, Mediterranean feel that felt cozy despite the tons of people around you. It transported you to somewhere definitely non-American which is definitely a good thing.\n\nSo far so good right? So why 3 stars...\n\nWell...the FOOD.\n\nIt was decent at best and hit flat most of the time. The appetizers I felt outdrew the entrees which is never a good thing. \n\nZucchini Cakes/Grilled Octopus - I never order veggie dishes..esp at expensive restaurants since I feel its not worth the money. But surprisingly these cakes had a nice pop to it and the texture was perfect. The octopus was also grilled nicely and was very refreshing. It was a good start that got me excited about the next course.\n\nLamb chops - I ordered this based upon rave reviews and I had to say was not impressed. The lamb was cooked well but lacked seasoning and punch. The sides also were bland and I felt like something was missing overall. Just didnt have the flavor I was looking for in a Lamb dish that I've had at many other places. Sad.\n\nBraised ShortRib over Pasta - This was opposite of the Lamb. WAY too salty. Everything was cooked well just tasted too much of the sodium which hid all the other flavors of the dish. Double Sad.\n\nBaklava - Wow...talk about dumping sugar and then some. All I can think about when eating this is how many cavities I will be getting. Did not like it too much.\n\nWine - Ordered a bottle of Cab from Sonoma...this was tasty at least!\n\nAs you can see, despite the great service and decor, the food is the MOST important of any review and experience and it definitely was sub-par in my opinion.

We had a delicious early meal before a show at the curran theatre. We had heard good things and its sister restaurant Evvia in Palo Alto is one of my favourites. Greek food is so underrated!\nThe waiter was professional and helpful and we used his guidance in our selections. The freshness of the bread and my pea and fava bean salad were wonderful. The lamb meatballs are a must! The portions are not huge but sensible enough to allow you to enjoy 3 courses without feeling stuffed. ( I didn't have the lamb shank which did look enormous!) My main course was a whole grilled branzino which the chef filleted. It was absolutely delicious, moist and sweet. It comes with saut\u00e9ed greens and the obligatory lemons and olive oil which kept it fresh and light.  I would have liked some potatoes and in future I will order a side dish. My husband had the lamb chops which he assured me were amazing.\nWe managed to squeeze in desserts and coffee too. The semolina filled filo rolls with  ice cream was fantastic, the ice cream was so delicate and creamy. I would have the rice pudding next time, the seasoned dried fruits on top made it smell and taste like the holidays. I remember rice pudding as a school dessert and pretty horrible but this was so creamy and rich without being too sweet. I think I will try and make it at home.\nAll in all a lovely meal and definitely would return.", "author": "Lisa J."}

Thanks, Laurie...because my wife and I enjoyed one of the best restaurant meals we've had in years!\nFirst, a shout out to our waiter, Frank, who recommended our selections and was attentive and friendly. You nailed it, Frank!\nStarted with the octopus and the pork belly - on special - apps. Octopus beautifully prepared...not chewy or fleshy. But the pork belly was spectacular. Melted in our mouths and with the light mustard sauce, it was divine. \nFor the entree, I had the famous lamb chops, perfectly done and paired with simple but delicious roasted potatoes. My wife was daring and ordered the special goat stew...OMG! It was sweet and savory, with tender meat served over orzo. It was hard to decide who had the better meal.\nWithout a doubt you should eat here *if you can get a reservation*.

They were ridiculously busy for a mid week lunch and no wonder it's so crowded, I bet everyone and their brother in the Financial District are here on \"business\" meetings.  I think it just might be a good excuse to get some good food on company money.\n\nThe appetizers we dined on were the feta & olives, grilled calamari, and some kind of melted cheese appetizer on bread.  The grilled calamari was excellent but a lot different than I was expecting.  I was expecting some chopped up squid that would be generously grilled over the fire.  What we received was 4 small pieces of squid (the size that you buy to go fishing including the tentacles) stuffed with feta, fennel, & orange with black olives.  That was really the highlight of my entire meal.  \n\nI thought I'd be a little adventurous and have the mousakka which was supposed to be a spiced lamb casserole with eggplant, potato, and yogurt.  What it really turned out to be was a mixture of stuff that didn't go very well together but was extremely filling.  They did not skimp on how much of that grounded up lamb you got.  Do not expect to go home hungry with this entry but I'll go with the grilled ahi tuna next time I dine at Kokkari.", "author": "Albie F."}

Just a stone's throw away from Embarcadero 1.  Valet parking is available for $8.  \n\n2)  Lunch Menu - The menu is the same as Evvia's.  Although I didn't see the larger spanikopita lunch entree (I think it's called something sandwich), but we ordered the spanikopita (I know I'm missing two syllables) appetizers and they were good and exactly the same as Evvia's.  I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki and it came with four pieces of grilled pita bread as well (well, one big piece cut into four pieces).  The beef dish was pretty good - it was the lunch special not on the menu - so please ask your waiter.  It came with pilaf rice and potatoes as well. \n\n3)  Service - The service was great even though my lunch partner was in a White Sox cap, jeans, and flip-flops *sigh* (Thank God I was wearing a sweater cardigan and knee-length suit skirt).  We sat in the larger backroom with more tables so there was more people-watching to do and the waiter would constantly come by the table to see if we needed anything.  \n\n4)  Reservations - You need reservations to this place during lunch, even on the weekdays.  I looked for times on opentable.com two hours before lunchtime and they only had 11:45 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. available on a Thursday.  So plan ahead!", "author": "Chris L."}

A friend and I went for a late lunch after shopping in the city.  We arrived at 2:00, were seated quickly, and were presented with a basket of bread and a small dish of salt.  We requested olive oil for dipping, and then waited...and waited...and waited.  The lunch crowd had died down, the restaurant was not crowded at all, so it was puzzling.  \n\nA party was seated next to us, and the same thing happened.  No olive oil, even after requesting it.  \n\nMy friend and I ordered four small dishes to split.  When the first two arrived, they finally brought the olive oil, after we'd filled up on dry bread (we were starving).  The zucchini cakes were delicious, and the dolmathes were -- well, they were dolmathes.  We ordered a small dish of prawns in sauce, and the prawns had an artificial, metallic taste I couldn't place.  We also got a dish of fried cheese, which was tasty, but very, very salty, and swimming in oil.  Even splitting it, my friend couldn't finish her half. She had a glass of wine with lunch, and we both had coffee, and split a dessert.  The tab?  $45 each (including tip) for lunch.  Not cheap.\n\nI have been to Evvia in Palo Alto and had a much better experience.  Also, another thing happened that really gets on my nerves.  It's very irritating when an inexperienced waitperson barges into your table with nary an \"excuse me\" when you are clearly in the middle of a conversation, cuts short your discussion, and blocks your view of your lunch companion with arms, dishes, glasses, etc.  If I'm paying almost $50 for lunch, I want to be treated a little better than that.", "author": "Lira K."}

The skewers were outstanding, as were the sweetbreads. The octopus and riblets I would rank as good, and the tzatziki was just your standard tzatziki.\n\nThe service was also excellent, though the size and respective tab of our group probably helped out a little. The waiter was knowledgeable, a virtual encyclopedia of the menu and wine list. He was quick to describe to me the difference between all the desserts. I opted for the Galaktoboureko which the waiter described as a eggroll with custard filling, a little bit like a cannoli. As expected, it was quite good. \n\nThis restaurant is on Jackson Square in the Financial District. It makes a great place for a special occasion or business dinner.

She was very friendly and showed us to our seats.  The restaurant is very nicely laid out and decorated and the seating/dining area was very comfortable.  Our server, Pacshalis, showed up and asked if we would like to order appetizers.  We said that we would like to have cocktails first and he seemed to get a bit miffed over this.  He reluctantly took our drink orders and returned after they were served to take our dinner orders.  He had trouble remembering the specials and when asked some questions, such as whether their lamb was American or not he asked, \"What do you mean?\"  We said is the lamb raised in America or NZ or some other place?  He said something like, \"It is raised in America if that is what you like.\"  Yeah, right.  He seemed like he was being bothered and was very snotty.  I tried to order some wine for the table, but he just walked away without acknowledging anything.  He ended up standing at a waiter's station maybe 10 feet away from our table so I got up and went to order some wine.  He wouldn't even look at me or answer me and pretended to be studying the order list he was carrying.  It wasn't until another waiter asked me if he could help me that our waiter finally acknowledged me and took the order.\n\nOur food was a mixed bag.  It was all nicely presented, but some was very tasty and as described and some was clearly inferior and not what we were told.\n\nOur party ordered two of the specials that evening: A grilled veal chop cooked rare, and a rotisserie grilled pork loin chop.  The veal chop was baby beef, not veal, even though we asked if it was really veal or baby beef and were told that it was definitely veal.  The rib bone was well over an inch across, which was way too large for veal, and they had cut half of the meat off so the actual chop was about 1/2\" thick or less and then cooked it till it was overdone and chewy.  The pork chop was not a chop at all - it was pork shoulder - and contained mostly large chunks of fat.  Both diners were very disappointed in these \"specials\" that were in the $35+ range.\n\nTwo of us had the grilled quail, which was very tasty, and two others had a couple of traditional Greek entrees, which they enjoyed.  And, the grilled octopus appetizer was fantastic.\n\nWe may return, but would definitely like a different server - one who knows the menu, is honest, and is friendly.", "author": "jack q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-30", "description": "My folks were in town for 2 weeks at Thanksgiving (their second trip here).  The only restaurant request for this trip was Kokkari.  My Dad, a Greek guy and excellent cook in his own right, said it was the only place in SF worth going to a second time.  Really?  Last time in town I thought I took them to quite a few interesting places (Chez Panisse, Boulevard, Gary Danko) but this is what they liked.  I made a reservation.\n\nThis time we were seated in a booth by the front room.  My folks were very pleased with the location, off to a good start.  Our server explained the menu, made recommendations, and gave us plenty of time to decide while sipping on our cocktails.  She also offered to decant our wine for us.\n\nAppetizers:\nSaghanaki- pan fried Kefalograviera with lemon & oregano.  \nGrilled Octopus - with lemon, oregano & olive oil. \nGrilled Lamb Riblets - with lemon & oregano.\nAvgolemono - traditional egg-lemon soup with chicken & rice.\nMy Dad loved the lamb, we needed a second order.  I really like the octopus, it was tender and the smoky flavors remind me of home.  My Dad tried it and wiped out the rest of the plate, first time he really liked it that I can remember.  The soup was not as good as my Yia Yias, but no food is as good as hers really. \n\nDinner:\nKokinisto me Manestra- aromatic braised lamb shank with orzo & myzithra.\nArnisia Paidakia - grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes.\nI really like the braised lamb shank.  Lamb and orzo as we call it in our house.  The portion huge and the orzo tasty from braising in the lamb drippings although a little on the greasy side.  The lamb chops generous and lemony.  The potatoes crispy and tender all at the same time, just like my Aunt Dotties.  My Dad was over the moon with the whole experience.  It was the perfect family meal to share on the last night of their visit.  Glad I didn't have to cook it!  \n\nOn the way out I asked the hostess if it would be possible to get their cookbook (I had already purchased it) signed for my Dad.  I was instructed to call back and make an appointment, to be sure the Chef would be there.  I followed up the next week and had my appointment for the 15th.  When I arrived at the appointed time, I met one of the managers who was very nice.  I explained that my Dad just loved the restaurant and had brought a bottle of wine for the Chef, as a thank-you from my Dad for a great Greek meal.  I saw the Chef come up and speak with the hostess, but the manager had my book and the wine.  Shortly after, the manager returned with my book and explained the Chef was in Palo Alto that day and requested I come back the following day.  She kept my book to get it signed and asked me to bring back the wine to give to him myself.  I was puzzled.  Hadn't I just seen the Chef?  When I returned the next day, at the appointed time, I was greeted by the hostess who explained that the manager was in a meeting and couldn't be disturbed for 20 minutes or so.  She offered to check with the Chef about the book and deliver the wine for me.  She quickly returned and told me I had to wait for the managers meeting to end to get my book.  OK I thought, I understand that restaurants are busy at the Holidays and the most important thing here is getting that signed book for my Dad.  I waited at the bar for the managers meeting to end, about 20 minutes as stated.  When her meeting was over, the manager delivered the signed book to me (telling me the Chef had returned from Palo Alto the night before and signed it for me then) and took the wine from me to give the chef on my Dad's behalf.  The inconvenience of making an appointment to get the book signed and having to come back a day later (when the Chef was probably there the first day) was my problem.  Having my Dad get that signed book on Christmas day was a priceless experience.  He was thrilled that the Chef would actually sign his cookbook.  My Dad then said, \"I hope you brought him a nice bottle of wine as a thank-you for doing this for me.\"  Yep Dad, I did.", "author": "Kim A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-05", "description": "We were interviewing a candidate and since he was flying in for the interview my boss had asked me to choose a place to go for dinner after the all day interview.  I'm the only one in our group who actually lives in SF and was able to choose a place from the list of places I had been meaning to try.  Dinner reservation for 6 and a corporate credit card?! That's my idea of a great dinner I only wish we did that more often!\n\nI think we ordered every appetizer on the menu and overall every thing was delicious. Some highlights were the Kolokithokeftethes the zucchini cake with cucumber mint-yougurt dressing. It was perfectly light and fluffy and full of flavor. \n\nThe grilled octopus was absolutely delicious. I could eat an entire octopus if you put it in front of me prepared by the Evvia kitchen!. I was fortunate enough to travel through the Greek Islands with a friend a couple years ago and this was just as good as it was there. Perfectly grilled slightly chewy but not tough in any way and absolutely delicious. I just ate dinner and I'm getting hungry thinking of that octopus. \n\nMy boss got the lamb which was delicious. They have a open fire spit and roast a whole lamb on it. There isn't a better way to cook lamb than over a fire. I think there's a caveman primal urge with meat cooked over an open flame that just speaks to my soul. I had the  Katsiki Yiouvetsi (braised goat with roasted tomatoes, green beans, Greek olives, orzo & herb feta). The Katsiki was delicious and came out in a hot ramekin. \n\nI also tried the whole grilled fish that a coworker had ordered. It was grilled with lemon and oregano vinaigrette and served with horta. Horta (sounds more like Khorta in Greek) is a traditional Greek green that is served at every dinner table in Greece. No wonder the Greeks are so healthy. One trick that my friend taught me in Greece was to be very careful with the horta as it can be chewy and cause a choking hazard.  No more ADD. \n\nAll of the food at Kokkari was delicious and it was a perfect location for a business type of dinner. All of the apps are great for sharing and lead to some livening of the dinner table (especially during business dinners!). I highly recommend the food, service and ambiance here. It's the perfect place for a quality sit down dinner.", "author": "Mike K."}

The Greek salad was fresh - I loved the cucumber and chunks of Feta cheese. The persimmon salad was different. I love the fruit but I've never had it prepared in a salad form. I could have done without the dill. The octopus was rich and quite chewy. The shrimp was tasty but I could only have a few bites because it was so rich. The lamb chops were the best part of the meal. I usually don't eat lamb because it's so gamy but it was cooked very well here. The pizza was mediocre at best. \n\nAll in all, the atmosphere is nice and romantic here and the drinks were great but I was not really impressed with the food.

I know this is close to the 2300th review but I had to comment on the food.  We start with the spankopitas which was light and flaky to perfection, asparagus with dill and feta was a good combination, whole fish grilled with lemon and Cretan oil was excellent!! It was low lit romantic setting.  Also Dave Chapelle was there outside having a smoke.  I would definitely recommend this place for a romantic evening that has  nice ambience and light but filling dishes. There was street parking and the prices were mid range for downtown San Francisco.", "author": "Trice G."}

Servers are friendly, professional, and extremely accommodating.  The restaurant itself is comfortable , lively and inviting.  The wine selection is fantastic.  Had a bottle of '12 Robert Biale Zinfendel...so smooth and tasty. Started with the crispy zucchini cakes with mint and cucumber yogurt.  Everything about this dish is perfect. From the warm crispy cake filled with soft zucchini to the cold refreshing Cuc/mint yogurt you top it with.  The Greek salad was fresh and vibrant. Shared the lamb chops and goat stew for dinner. Lamb chops are cooked perfectly and have a bright flavor of spices and lemon and are accompanied by 3 delicious oversized potato wedges.  The goat stew is insane. The flavors are so warm and comforting it makes you keep coming back for more and more and more. It literally melts in your mouth!  For dessert we had a piece of heaven. It was crispy shredded phyllo dough coated in honey topped with custard, then panna cotta then crushed pistachios. Insane!!!  So rich but light and fluffy. Even if you're  too full for dessert...order this!  You won't regret it!", "author": "Joanna P."}

The manager makes his way around the room(s) to speak with guests and shake hands, which is the sign of a well-run place. Staff is on top of their game and service flows really smoothly.

I don't know why it took me so long, because all I can say about this place is - AMAZEBALLS.  \n\nI was impressed as soon as I walked through the door, with the genuinely friendly staff, the authentic ambiance and finally the ridiculously delicious meal.  I was a little hungover from the previous weekend's festivities, so the husband and I did not order any alcohol - but that's o.k., more stomach space for food.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered the special appetizer of Duck Dolmaths, one of the dips (not sure of the name, but it was made of feta) and pita plates, and grilled Octopus.  The husband wanted to order a bowl of Avgolemono soup too, but the waiter said that as much as he wanted to sell it to us, he wanted us to save room for our entrees.  All dishes were heaven - the lemon, oregano, and olive oil were great combinations.  Such simple ingredients, yet the food was spectacular.  For our entrees, I had the Lamb Rotisserie special (slow roasted pieces of the whole lamb they had on the rotisserie all day) and the hubs had the Lamb Chops.  Though both were Lamb meals, they were both very different.  The Lamb Rotisserie was so tender and melted in the mouth - this is for people who aren't afraid of all parts of the lamb.  And the Lamb Chops - so nicely crisp on the outside and tender on the inside; we'd definitely order this one again.\n\nAnd if the night couldn't get more scrumptious, our waiter comped us an order of homemade Baklava (you could TASTE the from-scratchness), complete with a candle to top of this birthday meal.  Very unexpected.\n\nI definitely want to come back again, and it's very likely I'd order the same items.  I know that this time around, we won't wait 8 years for the next visit.", "author": "Tabitha I."}

Everything was well cooked and well presented; the pagoto baklava (baklava-flavored ice cream) was exceptionally good.  For the food alone, this place gets 4 stars. I still feel that the \"classy\" Greek food combination is very bizarre outside of Greece (same goes for Spanish food), I'm not quite sure what to make of it. \nThe service was a bit flaky, we had to wait for a while to be seated (which I do not appreciate), but we were given a complimentary olive flatbread to compensate for the delay (which I do appreciate). They brought us the food from the wrong table twice and our waiter was somewhat stiff. However, we were not rushed at all during our meal. \nIt's a large and noisy restaurant, not exactly an intimate venue and as they do seem to shoot for the upscale type of establishment, they should really redo their ceiling!", "author": "Anna J."}

I liked the fireplace in the front dining room. The only glitch was our seat in front of the entrance door that kept chilling us through dinner. (It also didn't allow us a very good view of the restaurant). We ordered the baked feta appetizer and also the mussels that they had as a special that night. Both were excellent. I thought the feta should come with pita but it didn't so we requested some and they obliged. The broth/sauce of the mussels was incredible and was the best part of both appetizers. Our mixed drinks - we had several, were also perfect. We both were interested in the moussaka so we inquired about it.  Our waitress responded that it was like a warm blanket wrapped around you...we were sold. It was awesome - piping hot, creamy, well spiced, and well seasoned.  I initially wanted to add salt but I was worried that it would disturb the delicate balance of seasonings in the casserole. I'm glad I refrained. For dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake and I think it's the best dessert I've ever had, beating out the sticky toffee pudding I had in San Antonio that previously held that special spot in my heart. Our meal cost about $160 before tip for both of us which was a very good value for the quality of everything we enjoyed that night. I can't wait to come back to SF and go here again.

This is a great restaurant to dine with friends, family or for business (lunch or dinner).  My only two complaints are that you have to book a month in advance to get a decent dining time and that the bar doesn't have a cocktail menu - a necessity for the forgetful and unimaginative (read: me).

The bartenders are the smoothest, most professional in the City, all the while being warm, friendly and personable.  They know the favorite drinks of hundreds of customers by heart, they pace things well, they know when to ask if you want a refresh, and they do it all with incredible aplomb.

The food was amazingggg (as expected), but I thought the service was a bit on the slower side (obviously understand that it was Valentine's Day though). \n\nI'll try my best to recall everything we ate (which was a lot!):\n* pita bread and assorted spread with olives. Of the three spreads, (i) more traditional hummus which I liked (ii) chopped tomatoes / veges - reminded me of a salsa dip.. which was my favorite! and (iii) what tasted like a cucumber-based spread (which I obviously did not like since I'm not a fan of cucumbers)\n \n* baked shrimp with melted goat (?) cheese (the sauce reminded me a lot of ravioli sauce) \n\n* tomato salad with feta cheese, onions.. - very whatevers - nothing special. \n \n* wrapped roasted duck, - kind of a weird texture, but I really liked the combination of all the different flavors! (reminded me of a smaller version of the lotus-leaf rice for dimsum..)\n\nFor the main course - we both had the lamb chops with the Kokkari potatoes. By the time we got to the main course, I was already pretty stuffed, but it was still delicious! I was a huge fan of the potatoes especially! The lamb chops were cooked well, and definitely lived up to the hype. \n\nDessert - we got the (i) Baklava and (ii) warm flourless cake with ice cream. I definitely would have enjoyed both more thoroughly, but I was just way too stuffed. The baklava was good, but definitely nothing special (just taste like any other traditional honey-walnut baklava). The flourless cake had a hint of cinnamon/spicy flavor that I wasn't exactly sure what it was. \n\nOverall - I would def. go back so that I can try rest of the non-set menu items that I've been craving to try!!! (eg. the Rotisserie, the grilled zucchini, grilled octopus, etc)\n\nTips: \n* Parking - because it's in financial district, parking can be a bit of a pain. However, they do have valet service for $8 dollars so do yourself a favor and save a little time (and energy!)\n\nAmbiance: \n* very romantic! I love the two tall wooden doors.. and the fireplace right where you walk in! It feels very cozy.. and old school.

I was surprised and still think about how great of a choice tonight was. \nThis is my first Greek Restaurant. I'm impressed. Reservation is highly recommended.\n Lights were dim but enough to be able to read your menu. \nThe place looks rich and almost feels like it's steeped in rich red wine. Saucy and yet alluring. I think its the warm fire burning on the giant open rotisserie going. It gives the place a warm glow that you feel when you take in an excellent  cabernet.\nFeeling bold that night and ordered the most exotic entree: Lamb organs and Goat Stew. Loved the Lamb organs since they're sorta kabob style and burnt on the edges. It was a little gamey but as expected. It was soo good. I think I ate faster than JD on this one. Lol.  \nWe shared both entrees but i think my company like the Goat stew better. It was so tender that the meat just melts in your mouth. \nBoth came with the Kokkari potatoes and oh my! These potatoes are top notch! They're so good. i was torn! Meat or potatoes?? Who gets it first? It's wedge style and I had to control myself from just eating them and forgetting all about the entrees. \nWe also shared the Peach Salad. Excellent for summer! But there was probably more peaches than greens. It  was still really good though. Very refreshing.\nLastly our waitress was very knowledgeable and helpful. The place was clean and very classy.", "author": "Janet D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-26", "description": "There was nothing wrong with Kokkari - I found the space warm, welcoming, and an immediate boost to my spirits. The service was frisky, which I find much less appealing in a middle-aged man whose wit is dulled by carrying too many trays of food to strangers.\n\nUltimately, however, I'm all about the food - and here there is also nothing to complain about. All of it was tasty and high quality product, like my entree, the rotisserie of the day, a spit roasted Berkshire pork. This was a nice dish, this pork - and I was served different, generous bits of the animal, including the best part, the crisp skin.\n\nAnd yet...I never heard the harmonies of the angels from on high. This may seem like an absurdly high standard, but not so - I certainly heard the angels warming their vocal chords and tuning their harps when I heard Berkshire pork was the rotisserie of the day.\n\nBut let's go onward...\n\nThe zucchini cakes with cucumber and mint yogurt dressing was good, if unimaginative. The fried smelts with garlic-potato skordalia and lemon, also good, though it grew tiresome - maybe a little less would have meant more. The grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, and orange with black olives? How could that go wrong, right? Well, it didn't go wrong. And yet...the angels remained mute. The pikti, a terrine of Berkshire pig trotters and head with toast, cucumber and black olives? Correct! Good, but more exciting on the menu than in the reality.\n\nNothing was bad. The pickled veg? Tasty. The bread? Also good. The olives? Of course. The baklava and other assorted 'traditional' desserts? Also enjoyable. And yet...\n\nThe other entrees I sampled were also good.\n\nThe whole grilled fish (deboned for you, yes) with braised greens, lemon, and Cretan olive oil? Fine. Though, to be honest, it tasted too fishy and too lemony to me - which, I know, it's fish, but fish doesn't have to taste fishy - and, contrarian that I am, I've never been a fan of too much lemon on seafood (just a spritz for me, thank you).\n\nSurprisingly, the least appetizing entree on the menu ended up being the 2nd most excellently prepared entree that night (the 1st being my pork) - the dry aged rib eye steak. This is something I would never order in a Greek restaurant; but I got to taste it, and it was perfect - perfectly cooked and a deliciously aged piece of meat, full of flavor and neither bland nor watery like lesser cuts of non-prime beef.\n\n3.7 stars rounded up. Would I eat there again? Definitely - if you're buying, I'm flying. But with so many places to eat, so few recession dollars to spend, I'd rather make a repeat visit to a place like The Farmhouse Inn and Restaurant. Now there, my friends, is a place where the angels are in full flight.\n\nWine was excellent, cost was fair - but certainly not an everyday sort of outing.\n\nOn a lighter note, Willie Brown was there that night and he seemed to be a happy man.", "author": "Brski B."}

It's dim and there's a lot of dark wood furnishing.  \n\nOur bread was fresh and tasty but I will refrain from making a big deal out of it because I was hungry and probably not in the right frame of mind to evaluate its worthiness.  We also got some olives.  Had to ask for olive oil though.\n\nI had the hardest time hearing our server(s) speak!  They spoke too softly and mumbled everything.  \n\nLuckily when we asked for suggestions and the specials, the server was very enthusiastic and helpful.\n\nWe started out with the zucchini cakes with mint cucumber yogurt sauce (via yelp consult) and lamb riblets (server recommendation).  I had no idea what to expect for the zucchini cakes, which looked more like a baby cassoulet.  There were beans and stuff in there too.  It was definitely interesting; I'd never had anything like it.  Its taste wasn't spectacular though.  We much preferred the lamb riblets.  So tender, so juicy, so tasty!  \n\nWe wanted to get a fish dish as well as a meat dish.  Opted for the specials menu.  We picked the local petrale sole with a lemony vinaigrette served with mustard greens and the pork shoulder with apples, served with rice and a yogurt sauce.  The portions were huge.  The petrale sole was delectable!  Very light, very fresh, very tasty.  Loved it.  The pork shoulder was a huge contrast.  Each piece of meat was very fatty.  No matter how hard I tried to find lean meat to eat, every bite consisted of 80% fat.  It did taste good though.  The apples complement the pork very well.  We loved the rice with the yogurt sauce!  \n\nThough we were rather satiated, we couldn't pass up dessert.  The special sounded fabulous but too heavy (phyllo, meyer lemon filling, pistachio ice cream, and some other good stuff).  We opted for the Arborio rice pudding with a caramelized pear.  It was quite good.  The pear went well with the pudding, but definitely do not eat the pear by itself for it is SOAKED in flavor and its strength is overwhelming.  The dessert selection is aplenty so be wise and save room!  Or eat really slowly.\n\nOther notes: our food came out ridiculously fast.  Especially the appetizers and dessert.  Amazing.  \n\nTo get to the restroom is a journey in and of itself.  An elevator is involved.  The one time use hand towels are amazing but wasteful.  \n\nPrices are reasonable for the quality, presentation, uniqueness, atmosphere and overall experience.  \n\nAlso very BART accessible.", "author": "Lydia W."}

A real contributor to this is the intimacy of the seating (large stuffed chairs and tables not too close together), the location of the bar - way inside, opposite the entrance and the open fire with a spit and an entire animal (assume lamb) roasting on a spit - that's awesome!\n\nThe service was adequate.  The restaurant is a little more high end, so the expectation is a little higher - this was as I say, adequate.\n\nThe food, hmmm. Well, it was...hmmm...OK.  Yeah, that's what it was, ok...Just OK.  I had lamb kabobs which came with the basic condiments of a gyro.  It was in fact, sort of like a deconstructed gyro.\n\nThe lemon-chicken-rice soup was a little inferior because the chicken was tough actually.\n\nThe desert - a chocolate sunday was good.\n\nAdding it all up its probably a 3.5 round down to 3.

We had gone there for our anniversary and were running late. I called to tell them we'd be late and not only did they hold the table the extra half hour, but they were really sweet about it. I had some champagne pre-ordered (they didn't have the champagne I wanted, and were really great about offering similar levels and options) and they brought that out soon after we were seated (remember, 1/2 hour late). Our waitress was great with helping me decide between several of the lamb dishes on our last visit. Love the grilled octopus - never chewy, always flavorful. You really can't go wrong with any of the lamb dishes - I've tried all of them, I think. Moussaka is amazing too. Most all the apps are great.

I'd even go so far as to say that it's one of my faves in CA and I think that's a pretty big compliment in a city full of great restaurants. \n\nI love the ambiance too, it's sort of a jazzed up rustic look, with dim lighting and yummy smells bouncing of the walls and beams of this place! You can come all dolled up, or come in a pair of jeans and shirt. You can come for a romantic date or a nice dinner with the family. Anything goes. The hostesses are warm and friendly, and the service is impeccable. For all this and more, Kokkari definitely deserves 5 stars! \n\nAmong some of my favorites are the gigantes, zucchini cakes, Kokkari potatoes, fresh spreads and pita, the lamb, chicken and the moussaka. I'm not a huge fan of lamb, but this is just about the only place I'll eat it. \n\nI've come with friends, co-workers, and family, and it's definitely always a crowd pleaser. \n\nSpeaking of which...I definitely need to come back soon! \n\nP.S.

I wasn't terribly hungry, but many things on the menu, especially the beef short ribs(with braised with garlic cloves, vinegar & little onions over orzo) looked positively scrumptious.

I know she loves Greek food and like my BF said there are only two great places in the City to go to and this one was worth every penny. Reservations are difficult to make as they book up a week or so in advance and there isn't very many time slots. For example: we had 9:30 dinner reservations when we really wanted 6. Because it was so late we all decided to go with a few appetizers and cocktails since we were planning on going clubbing. Each appetizer we ordered was absolutely delicious. My brother's favorite was of \"fried cheese\" dish. The wait staff was excellent they really entertained us and helped us choose what to get and they always promised to take it back at no charge if we didn't like it - well we never sent back anything because it was all good.

They gave me a terrible table (single woman waiting for her dining companion syndrome). When my sister showed up I asked to be moved to a banquette. The waiter hovered over us and asked us if we had made a decision at least three times, even though we asked him to give us some time. \n\nWe ended up deciding to share several appetizers, and asked him to pace them. Well, they weren't paced and came out one after the other. Believe me, the gigante beans don't taste as good if they aren't piping hot.

It was super crowded but fortunately we had a reservation, so we got our table on time.\nour waitress Sarah was very nice and professional with a great sense of humor.\nThe decoration and ambiance was awesome. we had a huge 8-person  square table, in the best part of the restaurant.\n I really don't get  why people like the food. I don't mean it is bad but, there is nothing special about the appetizers and the main courses except for the high prices!!!\nThe food was not tasty at all. we ordered sea bass, lamb chops, lamb shank, short ribs. I tried a little bit from every plate but none of them was great. lamb chops were not delicious, no seasonings except black pepper!!\n The short ribs were better but very salty.\nI won't go to this place again and don't recommend it. \nIf you want to spend 80 $ for dinner and wine, there are so many better places you can find in the city.", "author": "Mahyar M."}

I got the lamb shank with orzo and greek cheese... the lamb shank was HUGE and sooo much meat and soo freaken juicy! the orzo was in a light sauce and they put really salty shaved pieces of greek cheese on top which i think gave it so much flavor!! i was so full but i totally finished it!! I shared dulce de leche with my friend and it was a nice finish- tasted like very freshly made ice cream! my other friend got a lamb special and my other friend got grilled octopus and patates from app menu.. everything was superb!!  the wait staff was also phenomenal!\n\nwonderful evening :)", "author": "Lisa Z."}

When our meal ended, the waitress brought over the dessert menu.  I was a bit confused and told her that we didn't want any dessert.  About five minutes later, they brought out his birthday sundae.

I'm pretty sure Kokkari is a model of Heaven itself, as I felt this meal was truly divine...\n\nTo beat the recession, the bf and I decided to pass on entrees and instead get a few small plates, called Mezethes, to share.  On recommendation, we ordered the Kolokithokeftethes - crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber and mint-yogurt dressing - $8.75, and the Arnisia Plevrakia - grilled lamb riblets with lemon and oregano - $9.25.  These two dishes were absolutely amazing and nothing was left on the plate to show for it.  And if Kokkari wasn't as classy as it is, I might have considered licking the plates.  Words cannot do the flavors that danced in my mouth justice...\n\nPassable were the Marithes Tiganites - crispy whole smelts with garlic-potato skordalia and lemon - $8.50.  Our fabulous server, Thomas, told us that these were nicknamed \"fries with eyes,\" but these were just too fishy to eat.  We left most of the little critters on the plate, and at the end of the evening when our bill came, Thomas told us that he took the smelts off the bill since he noticed we hardly touched it.  We hadn't even asked him to do that, and I love a place that can truly appreciate its customers' needs.  It was completely unecessary for him to do that, but we appreciated it nonetheless.  It meant a lot to us that he was so attentive!!\n\nFor dessert, we wanted to try something a little different.  The flourless chocolate cake (\"Sokolatina\") was suggested, and looked delicious, but the bf got the Kokkari Sundae instead.  It came with house made chocolate ice cream (I think the best I've ever had!) and vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, and toasted hazelnuts - $10.  So decadent.  Equally delicious was what I ordered - the Yiaourti me Meli which was house-made Greek yogurt with spiced walnuts and dates, drizzeld with Marshall's honey - $8.  \n\nTo conclude, Kokkari is an experience not to be missed.  If you can't afford a Greek vacation, come here instead.", "author": "Kira K."}

If I lived in here in town, I wouldn't bother. But if you are going to visit here, this is worth a stop.\n\nPutting chronology and predictability aside, I'm commenting on a second meal in two nights at which I had a dish I've never had in Chicago, which was awesome: yogurt sorbet with strawberry granita. This was among the best desserts I've ever had. It was to be trite, a really hot foodgasm.\n\nBigger picture: the place is well run despite its size. When we first arrived and I saw the capacity of this place, I thought \"uh-oh, it's a high end, overpriced factory for upscale lemmings.\" But, it's not at all.\n\nTip: the sort of expensive entrees are superfluous. You can make a meal of the many well-portioned and fairly priced appetizers, which is what we ate, primarily, consisting of: \n\nZucchini cakes, grilled octopus that melted in your mouth, grilled artichokes, grilled Kalamari stuffed with something creamy that was delicious, smelts that rocked, and a few I forgot already.\n\nI was interested to see when they served our saghanaki if they would stoop to the low class \"Opah!\" flaming nonsense which I can't stand in most Greek restaurants in Chicago. Happily, they spared us. The flaming was done elsewhere. The dish was served without fanfare. And it was perfect - not greasy, gross or heavy.\n\nThree of us split a grilled halibut entree served on some interesting greens I'd never had and didn't ask what they were.\n\nLast tip: go to the bathroom before you really must. This place is huge, and the bathroom is accessible only by a trek to and wait for an elevator. Waiting for that elevator when you really need a nature break could be annoying.\n\nGreat place.", "author": "Michael S."}

The moment you walk in, you smell the intoxicating aroma of food.  I have to admit I was really excited to eat here but fell a little disappointed with the actual dinner.  \n\nWe started with Greek \"munchie\" food and had the house-made grilled pita with an array of different spreads (Melitzanosalata, Taramosalata, Tzatziki, Favosalata  and Tirosalata).  Try saying THAT five times in a row! LOL\n\nThis was satisfying as it pretty much what you would expect for a simple starter.  Lily and I ordered the rotisserie chicken.  I had seen these babies spinning around and around on the spit and I just HAD to try it!  I was surprised because the chicken really wasn't as juicy as I had hoped.  It was still flavorful but not amazing. \n\nOur friends had the pacific halibut steak as their entree and I wasn't too impressed with that as well.  The tomato, olive sauce that came with it, was a bit on the salty side.  Our service was slow.  So slow that they brought over four glasses of complimentary proseco to accommodate for our wait.

Perfectly charred, yet juicy. It's their signature dish & I can see why. The Domata Salata (Heirloom tomato & peach salad) was delicious! Probably my favorite item from the evening. It was refreshing and so different from the traditional Greek salad. The Kalamari had this great feta stuffing and the orange segments in the dish were delicious complements as well.\n\nThe Ehhhh: The Saghanaki (fried Greek cheese!) was good, but a bit too salty for my liking. I much prefer the version at George's in LB. They even include olives and have a table side flambe! But I digress...\n\nAnd yes...even with a 4-star rating, there is a bad: Our waitress was VERY cold to us in the beginning. Her responses were curt and she didn't crack one smile. However, once my boyfriend ordered our food she looked surprised and said, \"Oh wow...you know how to pronounce the menu items. AND you ordered very very good things!\" It's like she admitted that she pre-judged us and didn't think we were familiar with Greek cuisine. Very weird. She eventually warmed up to us and was sweet throughout the entire night. Sadly, we were also very off put by our dining location. We were sat at the very first table in the second main dining room. For some reason, my boyfriend's chair kept on getting tripped on throughout the night. Both customers AND servers were hitting his chair and not one person apologized. It was really annoying (must have happened about 6 times) and if there's one word of advice for Kokkari, it is to get rid of that table and just space the other ones out accordingly. Please!\n\nI'm willing to give 4 stars to Kokkari even with the chair mishap just because the lamb chops & salad were THAT GOOD.

Personally, I'm more of a fish person, so the meat didn't excite me as it did other people. I did try the lamb chops which are delicious. The zucchini cakes were also great, as people before have mentioned. They taste like crab cakes a little. Got stuffed cuttlefish (stuffed with cheese and steamed), which was good, but not as good as the zucchini cake (probably because not fried). The lamb meatballs with goat cheese is delicious as well.\n\nTheir fresh fish is very very good. It is a little plain because its literally just a fish fillet in a sauce, but the fish (sea bass) has never been overdone either time that I've had it. I've been impressed by how tender the fish is. \n\nI had rabbit the last time I was there. This was made well, but I felt the side (just rice) was a little lacking. This could also because I was trying not to eat carbs. \n\nThe rotisserie has been sold out both times that I went, which has been a bummer. I do want to try this next time.  \n\nOverall, the food is great, but maybe not up my alley.", "author": "Julia L."}

Definitely go with a group if you can:  then you can order a pile of Starters, throw in a couple entrees, and have them served family-style.  There's plenty here to keep a vegetarian happy, and the carnivores went away satisfied too.\n\nI didn't have anything bad, and the service was excellent.  The Spanakotiropita was the first Starter to be served, one to each of us.  Then we just piled stuff up around it, and they brought out clean plates as soon as you finished off any particular round of goodness.  For me the highlights were the Ravioli (filled with winter squash), which one of the meat eaters kindly gave me theirs in addition to mine (which I appreciated, but it was to their loss), and the Gigantes (\"oven-baked giant beans with tomato sauce\" and other good things).\n\nWe also had Saghanaki - the cheese is too strong for me personally, but it was popular at the table.  The Zucchini Cakes were not to my taste, but I was unique in that.\n\nFor the meat eaters, there were beef short ribs  - I can't say what it was like, but it was popular and what was left made its way into the doggie bag.  Grilled meatballs were also served.  They got compliments, but I don't remember them eliciting a strong reaction.\n\nRounding off our selections were standard pita with dips and the Kokkari Potatoe wedges.\n\nTo drink I had retsina for the first time and quite enjoyed it.  \n\nWe finished off the meal with flourless chocolate cake, Baklava, and Glyko (\"sweet\") Greek Coffee.\n\nAs you can see, coming as a group means you can hit the menu pretty hard.  The fact that no one had anything bad to say about any of our many selections says something important about this restaurant.\n\nWe had reservations, and by the time we left the place was packed.  And this is not a small restaurant.  So this is no hidden gem - make preparations.", "author": "Steve T."}

Every meal is a celebration in itself.  No formalities at the table, everyone attempting to talk louder than the next, laughter echoing down the street, lots of food being placed in the centre of the table and everyone digging in like famished dogs.\n\nEverything on the menu here is delicious and authentic...and the lemon flavored potatoes takes every Greek adult back to their childhood.  I am salivating as I write with the mere thought of them!\n\nThe lamb chops are extremely tasty and tender...and the assortment of dips with pita bread want to make you get up off your chair and break out into an awesome zembekiko (traditional Greek dance).\n\nAs for the Greek coffee..hmmm Greek coffee and I have never truly been friends..ever since the age of 4 when my father taught me how to make it (they start the Greek kids early).  He  never seemed to worry about the flaming fire as I strategically tried to place the coffee pot (hands trembling) on the burning inferno.\n\nI've always described the taste as bitter dirty pond water..but then again, I did try to make it taste bad way back when, so I'd be taken off coffee making duty.  My friends beg to differ and order it each time we go.\n\nThe fried smelts (marithes tiganites) are the cutest little whole bodied fish ....eating a fish the size of your pinky makes you get into spy mode and look around for the SPCA before popping them into your mouth.  And don't work yourself up into a panic about eating the tail and head, you won't feel the eyes crunch in your mouth at all ;-)\n\nAs for the avgolemono (egg lemon soup with chicken)...this is a dish every Greek kid would eat when they'd come down with the flu..and miraculously be cured.  \n\nAs for dessert, don't leave this place without trying the baklava or the galaktoboureko...and then get ready to say (whilst holding your belly) FOOSKOSA!

I can't really comment on the food because we had one appetizer that I didn't really enjoy and a couple of drinks, but nevertheless my experience was great even without trying a full meal.  Also, right before we were about to walk out, he randomly gave us a dessert and some Greek port on the house.  That definitely sweetened the experience!

Kokkari is named after a small fishing village.  You feel transported and de-stressed once you step inside... fantastic old world rustic European vibe with a huge fireplace, great pottery & decor, dim lighting, high ceilings/beams, warm relaxed ambiance, great music, and fresh flowers. Great for Birthdays or special occasions. Can be a bit crowded, but that tends to melt away after you're seated. I love coming here after a long week with good friends, sitting at a big table, sharing food and laughs, and lingering for a few hours. \n\nAwesome bartenders and cocktails - they really make you feel welcome -like family.  I MUST have the Grilled Kalamari appetizer stuffed with feta, fennel & orange with black olives!! (this dish is amazing! - the fennel & orange really bring a fresh brightness with the charred smokiness - the grilled octopus is great, too). I cannot visit without ordering the salatas appetizer platter ~Melitzanosalata (eggplant dip), Taramosalata (made with fish roe), Tzatziki (yoghurt/cucumber), Favosalata (hummus-y) (or Tirosalata (whipped feta)) with their warm, fresh, house-made grilled pita and some warm olives - SO good. \n\nFor dinner, (if you still have room!) I love the Galeos (roasted halibut), or the perfectly cooked Arnisia Paidakia (grilled lamb chops). I'm not a big fan of lamb, normally - but these are to DIE for!! Yummm! \n\nAnother must is to try some Ouzo (a Greek, licorice-flavored liqueur)! The Kokkari sundae, the Sokolatina (flourless dark chocolate cake) and their Greek coffee are good, too (it's a stone-ground coffee that is heated over HOT sand). \n\nThey have a perfect selection of wines, and I've had some amazing ports here, as well. The private dining room downstairs is really nice. Even the restrooms are gorgeous (you have to take an elevator downstairs). Service here is always top-notch - everyone is very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable about the food - and it's preparation, recommendations, and their wine list and pairings. They are very accommodating and attentive - without being overly-attentive.

Conveniently located at the outskirts of the Financial District, the restaurant is well-decorated and exudes elegance.

OMG.  That was some good shiznick.  \n\nEntrees included ravioli and the lamb shank.  I swear that lamb started the cooking process about a week ago, because the meat just fell right off the bone.  It was a tad on the salty side, but otherwise excellent.  Finally, we had the baklava for dessert, which was sweet and crispy.\n\nWith regard to service--it was excellent.

A tad high priced but not overtly so.", "author": "George F."}

One of the mains was the wrong item, took about 10 min to get the replacement and to the waiter's credit he brought out some grape leaves on the house. One main (lamb from the rotisserie) had more gristle and fat than I would have expected (and I like the flavor these impart, but 40-50% is a little heavy) and the moussaka was pretty salty. The ribeye was out of this world good and desserts were fantastic. Reasonable price for a bottle of good Greek wine the waiter recommended.

I was not asked if I wanted more bread.\n\nBut what sealed it was the granita that was way too sour to eat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-06", "description": "I suppose this review is not going to sit well with the 800 people who reviewed this place before me.  Well, the food at Kokkari didn't sit well with me, so I think it's only fair that I speak the truth.\n\nYesterday was my third visit to Kokkari, but first since 2002.  I remembered this place being a lot better, but it seems that memory failed me once again.  My friend turned 32 (or sixteen twice, as he put it), and he asked me if I could take him to Kokkari.  We showed up at 6 pm, and the place was packed.  Recession?  What recession?\n\nAs soon as you open the heavy wooden doors, you find yourself in the quiet opulence of a ritzy country club .  Dim lights, wide, tapestry-upholstered armchairs, antique-looking torchieres, heavy pillars - the ambiance is just perfect.  Hmm, what's that in the back?  A rotisserie?   They don't have those at the country clubs.  Some tables were more secluded, but ours was a few uncomfortable inches away from our neighbors'.  \n\nGetting to the bathroom was an adventure.  I had to walk all the way to the elevator and take it to the ground floor to get to the bathroom.  Fortunately, one of the waiters walked me to the elevator because I would have been lost on the way to the bathroom.  The bathroom was my favorite part of the experience.  It was fantastic!  Old Greek vases adorned the walls, and quiet Mediterranean music was playing.  I was waiting for the belly dancers to show up, but alas, it didn't happen.\n\nThe service at Kokkari was very professional, but not warm or friendly.  My friend had walked in to the restaurant with his Starbucks cup and set it on the table.  The manager showed up and offered a couple of suggestions: throw it out, warm it up, bring him a cup.  He took the Starbucks cup and reappeared a few minutes later with my friend's berry chai in a coffee mug.  They even reheated his drink.  Nice, huh?  Our waitress was nice, but it felt as though she was in a rush.  In fact, I felt like I was rushed through the entire meal.. One can't open a restaurant bursting at the seams with ambiance and expect to funnel people in and out every 15 minutes.  Our waitress did not offer to refill our iced tea and waters until the very end of the meal, although they did bring us more bread and olives.\n\nAs you can probably tell, I am stalling so that I wouldn't have to talk about the food.  The food was definitely not worth the price of admission.  \n\nWe started by sharing 3 appetizers.  The much ballyhooed zucchini cakes (looked kind of like crab cakes) with yogurt weren't nearly as good as I had thought.  In fact, they lacked flavor.  The artichoke and eggplant skewer was not as good as advertised.  The Spanakotiropita (filo pies with spinach, feta, leeks and dill) was the saving grace.  They looked like Greek hamentashen, but tasted even better.\n\nMy entree was downright horrible.  I opted for the rotisserie of the day, which was pork.  I told myself before coming to Kokkari that if they had roasted pork, I would order it.  I remembered it being that good.  Well, it wasn't.  I got two pieces of pork: a chop cut and a bacon cut.  The pork was drenched in fat, surrounded in fat, covered with fat and decorated with fat.  The two pieces on top of my chop were two pieces of deep fried, salty pork fat.  Ugh.  The chop was OK near the fatty part, but the inside was dry and tasteless.  The bacon cut was better, although when I cut out the fatty skin, I was left with nothing.  The pork was served with roasted potatoes, swimming in a pork fat and oil mixture.  UGH.  \n\nTo quote Joe Pesci's character from My Cousin Vinny: \"Excuse me, you guys down here hear about the ongoing cholesterol problem in the country?\"\n\nWe split our two desserts.  The flourless chocolate cake with whipped cream was rich but plain.  It wasn't exciting or unique.  The filo crepes with semolina custard and pistachio ice cream were very good.  Semolina custard tasted kind of like chilled cream of wheat, but it seemed to work with that particular combination.\n\nSo, the only two dishes that were good here were made with filo dough.  I always say that anything deep fried tastes good, and our dinner was yet another example.  The $138 ($118 + tip) we spent on dinner was way too much for the quality of food and the quality of service.  It wasn't a good value, and it wasn't a particularly great meal.  Add the cost of tums to relieve your heartburn, and Kokkari seems like a very expensive option.  Too expensive for me to repeat anytime soon.", "author": "Yan G."}

I dined here last night with two friends and everything (well, almost... I'll get to that in a sec) was simply perfection. The waiter was attentive, but not disruptive, the food was delectable and the ambiance was warm and cozy. The only, and I repeat only thing wrong with our evening was a brief disturbance by two, very intoxicated and scantily clad girls along with who I assume was their sugar daddy. They were perched beside a counter close to the bar area (right next to our table) and were tacky, vulgar and should not have been allowed to stay in the restaurant in that condition. They didn't even dine... there are many other places in the City that would be more appropriate for a group like that. Anyway, back to the food...\n\nMust Try:\nI implore you to try the lamb chops! They are simply divine. They were perfectly cooked and flavorful and not drowning in sauce. The only \"sauce\" was a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of lemon. Soooo good!\nFig Tart - this was the special dessert of the night and it was delicious. The figs could have been a tiny bit softer, but the flavors were fantastic.\nFlourless Chocolate Cake - I'm not ordinarily a huge fan, but this was great. It wasn't dense, but rather mousse-like, rich and creamy.\nEggplant & Artichoke Souvlaki - this was simple yet amazing. The eggplant was delectable and the artichokes were freshly prepared - not those yucky things out of a can.\n\nStay Away:\nEverything was delightful.\n\nBread:\nThe rosemary bread was fresh and delicious. The only thing missing was butter or some type of a dipper. Otherwise it was very good.\n\nWine List:\nThey have a pretty extensive wine list along with a full bar and a huge selection of after dinner drinks.\n\nService:\nFantastic. Not pushy or rushed. We were there enjoying our evening for over three hours and never felt like we needed to hurry out of the place. Our water glasses were always full and bread basket never went dry. Plus, when two of us finished and the third person was still eating, the staff did not take the other plates away until she was finished.

I love pissing off complete strangers!  Politics and religion just became my sole conversation topics for the evening!\n\nThe original thought was that we'd just split a whole bunch of appetizers because with the possible exception of the crispy smelt they all looked amazing.  We also determined the answer to the age-old question \"Is it possible to have too many fried cheese dishes on a menu?\"  That would be a resounding no.\n\nBut also tried the lamb meatballs, some prawn dish, deep fried fava beens (which rocked) and ended up splitting a moussaka, because I just can't go to kokkari and not have the moussaka.\n\nDespite having stopped in here for drinks at least 10 times in the past 6 months, I had forgotten how phenomenal kokkari's wine list is. Both old world and new world.  Torii Mor pinot?  Yeah I know you've never heard of it. I joined the club my last trip to Oregon because I thought it would be the only way to get my hands on it.

Really refreshing and surprisingly filling. I didn't regret not ordering a main course when I chose a salad for my entree\n- Any whole fish dish- I recommend asking them to fillet the fish, just because it's really annoying if you order one that has lots of bones. Either way, it's cooked really well with good seasoning, although a little too heavy on the olive oil in my opinion\n- Lahanofilodolmathes- it's too hard to describe, but it's basically a large piece of meat mixed with seasoning and some veggies (I think?), wrapped in grape leaves, and covered in a hearty broth. Deeeelish!\n- Souvlaki Hirino- this thing was massive...definitely wouldn't order anything else if you were going to get this, but really flavorful and overall awesome! \n\nDessert:\n-Milo Furnisto - baked cinnamon walnut stuffed apple with masticha gelato.

My boyfriend and I were just perusing Yelp for a good Greek spot and found this gem. A little more expensive than we were aiming for, but we wanted to spoil ourselves. Was definitely well worth every penny, and actually cheaper than the dinner we had the night before but a hundred times better.\n\nFirst off, we had the Spanakotiropita - filo dough triangles stuffed with spinach, dill, feta, and leeks. We could've just ordered 10 more of those and been set. Also for appetizers were unlimited complimentary olives -- an immediate win with me. Bread was nothing special, but I was so hungry, I managed to eat nearly all of it in the basket. Now on to the main course: YES, the lamp chops are as good as they say! It's not overly greasy, it's super flavorful, and cooked to perfection -- crispy and well done on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. I scraped every piece of meat off the bone (if it wasn't a fancy restaurant, I would've sucked the bone dry...that's what she said?). Paired with 3 crispy, very well seasoned potato strips -- amazingly done. My boyfriend had the Moussaka, a casserole with lamb, eggplant, and cheese. Also executed to perfection. creamy and delicious but I'd take the lamb chops any day over the Moussaka. To finish, we had two desserts: baklava for the boyfriend and a berry pudding that was not on the menu. Let me tell you, this berry pudding will BLOW YOUR MIND. It comes out looking like a volcano topped with real whipped cream. Overall sweet yes, but all natural and not overwhelming. The fruits seemed to be blended/pureed and maybe had some kind of spongey cake thing mixed in? Kinda hard to tell, but nonetheless, it kicked ass. Refreshing and the perfect way to end our meal. We left satisfied and not overly full; though this is not to say their portions are small, just not excessive.\n\nThe service was genuine and extremely observant. They have a wait staff that's very well-trained. Our server was only on her second day and apologized for forgetting the description of one of the specials, but I could not even tell she was new. The restaurant does not really have a Greek feel to it either. It's deceptively huge, room after room leading into one another. You have to take an elevator down to the basement for the bathroom, which is gorgeous. The entire restaurant has a fresh, clean, and modern feel -- stone floors with big candles, nice chandeliers (nothing gaudy), fresh flower centerpieces, just overall, really beautiful.

We were staying nearby, and in a search for restaurants close to our hotel, this came up.  I have to admit I haven't had any great Greek food in Seattle, let alone upscale, and after seeing the great reviews, I knew we had to try it.\n\nWe didn't have reservations, but it was fine, we got there right at 6pm on Sat night, and was told there was a table ready right then, but there was a reservation on it at 8:30pm.  We thought, no problem, we don't usually take 2.5 hours to eat a meal for the 2 of us.\n\nAt first, we were going to go with 2 entrees and maybe an appetizer, but after hearing the specials and looking further @ the menu, we decided on 5 appetizers and an entree.  Started off with grilled lamb tongue (sooo tender, doesn't have the texture of tongue, awesome) and roasted mussels (very big and juicy, though only downside was a few of them didn't open and the shells cracked a lot).  Then we went on to one of the dips (eggplant + peppers, sorry I can't remember the name!  But it was awesome, the pita breads were thick and the dip very fresh), stuffed calamari (amazing, i think this is a must try - at first I thought - cheese stuffed squid might be too much but it wasn't that filling @ all), and the artichoke and eggplant skewer (this was the weak one of the bunch, though the vegetables were big and we really ordered it so we didn't feel like we were only eating meat).  The last dish was the goat stew we shared - fantastic flavor, and the orzo was perfect.\n\nFor all that though, dinner did come out to right at 2.5 hours - service was a bit slow but I had a feeling our waitress was running around a lot, and it was pretty packed.  Looked like we got the last empty table when we walked in at 6 w/o the reservation.  \n\nHighlights for me were definitely the lamb tongue, calamari, and goat stew.

I was in the industry for a long time and I would never normally do this (since I feel most complain about the smallest things), but my experience needs to be heard. \n\nI was in with a group of 8 girls celebrating two promotions and a birthday. All is well, wine flowing, and the waiter, Perry, offers to bring out a \"sampler\" of apps. Having only been my second time there, I thought how great that the chef would prepare a plate of apps for a large group. WRONG. Perry just ordered 2 of most of the appetizers listed on the menu. I see nothing wrong with him ordering, but not once did he explain what he was doing. From my experience, an informed customer is a happy customer who has nothing to question or complain about later on the bill. Had we known his plan, we could have picked out our own since there were about 1/2 of us that didn't care for his selections. I was in no way upset at this point, the apps were excellent!! \n\nTime to order dinner, I paid no attention to what everyone else was ordering and ordered the lamb shank (SO GOOD!!). What I did notice was that Perry was visibly annoyed and seemed to come around to our table less often to pour wine. When the main course was served, I knew the reason for the sour mood. Most of my party had ordered soup and a salad. (cheaper fares) At that time we were ready for more wine (we'd brought 2 bottles and bought 2 bottles). The table was split between chard and other, so we requested a wine menu and asked for white (not chard) suggestions. Not only did Perry direct us to the red side, he suggested a $95 bottle of pinot noir and tried to pull the menu away before we could catch the price tag. (Always give a price point for your suggestions!) \n\nDessert was the same as the apps. We had a birthday, wanted to do something, again, Perry suggests a dessert \"sampler.\" I prob should have known better, but I'd had some wine and didn't want to think about it. AGAIN, no explanation, and out came just about every dessert on the menu plus a birthday sundae. \n\nI realize that he was trying to build his check any way possible. Since my friends hadn't ordered the higher priced items for entrees, he was trying to add whatever he could to the bill. I even had to ask for our corkage to be removed by the manager. (should have been waived) Perry became even more pissed when we split the bill and he promptly collected our signed copies. He even circled back to the table when a lone copy was left, beelined for the POS terminal just to roll his eyes and throw a fit that we hadn't left more than the 20% auto-grat. \n\nI have no problem with a waiter trying to build the check, BUT the difference is, a good waiter will do it without his guests knowing and they will leave feeling like they had a great experience.", "author": "J R."}

After a few past experiences at Kokkari, I was skeptical they could pull off a dinner party of this magnitude.  But I learned three things after the experience: \n\n1. Kokkari's service is stellar. From the valet, who reminded us that there was still a present in the back seat, to the waiter who remembered that I was drinking a different wine than most everyone else and the entire staff who managed to serve everyone pretty much in unison, and always with a smile.\n\n2. The food is equally stellar.  The beautifully seasoned lamb chops and chicken skewers, the incredible freshly baked pita and antipasto dips, the flourless chocolate cake.  All excellent.\n\n3. This update feature is useful for more than just my usual childish shenanigans.\n      3a.  I now join the masses who love Kokkari\n      3b.  Kokkari doesn't really need any more excellent reviews\n      3c.  Numbering the points in a review is just annoying.", "author": "Jay Z."}

The beets had a nice assortment, and they tasted very fresh.\n\nThe lentil soup was hearty, and the whole fish was prepared nicely, highlighting the freshness of the fish.  My favorite was the roasted prawns with tomato and feta - the prawns were large, sweet, and the salty creaminess of the feta with the tanginess of the tomato were perfect accompaniments.  The sauce is also great for dipping bread.\n\nWe passed on dessert.  The food was very solid, and each dish had its own characteristics.

I generally loathe birthdays and find them to be a bit nauseating, but I shan't ever pass up the opportunity for a sweet meal.\n\nDamn, this place is good. Impeccable service, wonderful ambiance. We were seated in the rear section of the restaurant this time, by the open air kitchen, and it really enhanced the dining experience for me. The air was buzzing with a nice, communal bustle. Prior to the meal, I'd really had my heart set on ordering the braised lamb shank but at the last minute opted for the whole grilled branzino again, and it was just as good as I remember it to be. It did arrive at the table de-boned, which was kind of thoughtful of them I suppose...but it made me sad that I didn't get to Saigon that mother myself. Since we decided in advance that we were going to pass on dessert, it somehow seemed appropriate to order four separate appetizers. The arnisia plevrakia (lamb riblets) was once again ridiculous, and the octapodaki tou yiorgou (grilled octopus with lemon and olive oil) was melty and perfect. The roasted brussels sprouts had just the right amount of char, and the addition of fresh grilled lemon peel worked in near-zen harmony with the accompanying bacon. The fourth dish was a seasonal recommendation from our server--a \"salad\" consisting of slices of blood orange, locally sourced, liberally smattered with spiced walnuts, honey, and dates. It was really simple and was a wonderful palate cleanser. I loved it.\n\nAll in all, I have nothing but the highest accolades for Kokkari and can't wait to come back again.", "author": "Anna C."}

The flat bread was good, but didn't leave me wishing I wore a toga or anything. The meatballs were sweet, tender, and moist. Perfect for the state of my jaw that evening. \n\nMy friend ordered the Halibut steak and struggled sorting through hidden bones in the fish meat.

A restaurant of this caliber in San Francisco should at least offer two entrees with no meat or fish, that have substance.

I was running a little late to start the night off, so I joined my table just in time for the feast to begin.  Apparently they ordered the zucchini cakes and a hummus platter to start off, and things just went off from there.\n\nThese zucchini cakes are SO good.  Plop on a little tzatziki sauce and leave me alone, thank you very much.  I'm salivating thinking of them now.  Some other apps that we tried were the smelt (which the orderer really enjoyed, they aren't really for me though), brussell sprouts (yummm), and the stuffed calamari.  Everything tasted great, and came out quick upon ordering.  Forgot to mention the actual pitas; even these were great!  They were a little thicker than normal, and served lighty grilled/crispy.  Perfect.\n\nWe only ended up getting a couple entrees and going tapas style with our apps, so I can only review the lamb chops.  They were some excellently flavored lamb chops at that.  The temperature wasn't exactly as I ordered, and they seemed as if they cooled down a little bit from the grill, but they were still stellar.  The potatoes included with them were a treat as well.  \n\nFinished off with an order of galaktoboureko and some baklava, which I definitely recommend the earlier of those two mentioned.  It was a very nice way to finish off the meal.  The baklava on the other hand, could have gone without.  One member of our party went with the greek coffee is well, and I would chalk that one up for the experience not so much for the delivery.

My sister was in town and was so blown away that she wants to go here on every trip (not allowed, too many other good spots to check out!).  The rest of their apps are awesome as well, I've never really had one I disliked (though I think the octopus is a bit overrated).\n\nThe meat, oh the meat.  The lamb chops are simply the best you will find.  I dare you to show me better.  My other favorite dish is their goat stew (seasonal, so may not be on the menu when you go).  You must try it.  It sounds.....odd, but is simply delicious.  The servers will tell you so.  And the lamb shank just makes any other you will try pale in comparison.

The front dining room is very Mediterranean and inviting, with a huge fireplace where meat is spit roasted.  We were seated in the back dining room.  The weather was very nice and the large windows were open to the street, giving a wonderful airy feel.  \n\nOur waiter was extremely helpful.  We started with the octopus and the lamb ribs.  Both were excellent.  The meat on the ribs was delightfully crisp on the outside while falling off the bone tender. Know that the size provides six small ribs, in case you are sharing.  We then tried the Kalamata pita, expecting more of a spread on pita bread.  What came was more of a pizza/focaccia.  Nonetheless, it was delicious, especially the myzithra cheese on top.\n\nFor entrees, one person tried the fire roasted pork special and two of us had the the grilled branzino.  We all tried the pork when the dishes arrived and the two of us that ordered fish wished we had just split the pork.  It was extremely moist and there was enough on the plate to split three ways.  The crispy skin was an extra treat.  \n\nThe fish, however, was a big to strong tasting for the rest of us.  It was prepared perfectly but we had not tried Branzino before.

Took us a while to finally get into this place...heard about it about a year ago, and tried to just get in within a days notice, or walk in...no go. Loooong waiting list. \nFinally decided to try on a weekday as we had out of town guests. Success!\nWe were not disappointed. We ordered these incredible fried smelts for an appetizer...so good! Extensive wine list and creative cocktails (mojito was very good!). They excel at their grilled meat entrees, particularly lamb (of course!) My husband even tried this goat stew that came highly recommended...wow...wonderfully tender...not gamey at all...the spices included cinnamon and cumin and they truly complimented that dish. I tried their chicken lemon greek soup....so incredibly creamy and sublime! YUM. Desserts were incredible...baklava was excellent as well as this greek yogurt with honey, pistachios, dates....omg...if you're in the mood for a wonderful greek meal...check this place out for sure!", "author": "Nina B."}

When I asked the waiter, she said that they couldn't find a supplier of octopus that was good enough, but that they hope you have it back on the menu soon.  \nSo we went the crispy smelts, which were surprisingly flavorful, and came with garlicky sauce that was excellent.  This was followed by the short ribs, which were quite good, but not knock-your-socks off, (the house-made pasta that it came with was the perfect texture and you could taste the freshness) and the lamb chops, which were cooked to perfection, but slightly underseasoned (and I don't even like salty food!)--but with a little sprinkle of salt that they placed on the table--it was great.

I drove up from SJ just for dinner and had to race back home for 10pm con call. Such a good friend, huh? ;P\n\nAnyways, the outside of the restaurant looks pretty basic, but inside it's pretty large and very well decorated. Nice atmosphere and ambiance. Classy, but not pretentious and not overdone. We were all late 20s and almost everyone else in the restaurant was older.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nOctopus - So good. Not one bit rubbery or chewy. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. One of my friends said it tasted like chicken. lol!! Try it.\n\nSpanakotiropita - Pretty standard. Well made and delicious. I think I would try something else next time like the grape leaves or lamb riblets. Mmmm...riblets.\n\nFor dinner, I had the lamb chops. I was considering the rotisserie, which happened to be lamb as well, but with so many people raving about the lamb chops, I had to try them. Mmm...delicious! Very flavorful, but not overpowering. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and served with seasoned potato wedges. I think next time I want to try the rib eye.\n\nDessert!\n\nRice pudding w/ red wine poached pear - OMG, I need to learn how to make red wine poached pears. I swear I could eat them all day long. The rice pudding part was just ok. Not as good as rice to riches. ;P\n\nBaklava - Delicious! Served with vanilla-praline ice cream. Traditional and a must.\n\nWe skipped out on wine since everyone had to drive afterwards. It is a bit pricey, but a perfect special occasion/splurge/date place if you can afford it. We split the tab to make it easier. It ended up being $40/person including tax/tip. But, two of my friends weren't that hungry, so they split one entree (pan roasted sea bass). So maybe about $45-50/person and bump it up to ~$65 if you're having wine. Yikes.\n\nWhat recession? ;P\n\nOh, the service was fantastic.

At around 9, the hostess told us the table paid for their bill and we were basically waiting for them to leave. What table takes 40 minutes to leave? Don't they realize that people have reservations and plans after dinner?  I wish the restaurant told the table that people were waiting! We were basically standing there waiting where the wheelchair ramp was since there was no other space available.\n\nWhen we got to our table, there were a few free plates of appetizers available. It was a type of flatbread pizza with feta & other spices. The other appetizer was this tempura squash item.\n\nSince there were a bunch of us, we decided to share plates between mostly pairs. We decided to try the special: the duck rotisserie,, and the Makaronia. Duck rotisserie was stuffed with spices and came with rotasted potatoes. The duck was pretty moist and yummy :). The Makaronia was hand-cut noodles with summer squash, sweet corn & myzithra cheese - $21 Makaronia was also delicious! I loved the corn with the noodles , it was fresh and light. The two dishes complemented each other well. I've never had greek food like this.\n\nThey charge for cake-slicing and gratuity was 20% (it might be because we're a big party?) but my meal was $27 which isn't too bad but then again I did split with 3 people... so I would recommend this place for special occasions if you're a student!\n\nI lucked out and found a spot about 2 blocks away.

The service is commendable as well! The maitre d' and managers are all present and engaging. Our server, Daria, was beyond great. She was knowledgeable, helpful, and just a pleasure and there at all points when needed.

It was ok... but to be fair I don't usually order pasta because it should be simple and at most restaurants, they try to make it fancy (This being one of those places too). I was actually more impressed by the ambiance that this place brought. Everything was lit in shaded halogen so as giving you that orangish glow throughout the place. Pretty spacious place too. There is a fire place where food would be roasting normally in the main room. The chars are very large and comfy for being a dinner chair. I don't know it felt like you were sitting in a little villa ... in the middle of the financial district. Service was nice, but in a formal way.

Last time I had been here was two years ago, and I vaguely recalled a delicious meal being had.  My memory was not wrong.\n\nFirst on our list was fried smelt after a lengthy consultation regarding the appetizers which included terrine made with Berkshire pig trotters.  The large order of fried smelts (so copious that it reminds me of going to the beach and getting fried clams in one of those red and white gingham paper containers) is accompanied by a potent puree of garlic and olive oil.  \n\nMy friend got the moussaka and I got the lamb chops.  Best to get the lamb chops if you are hungry; it's quite a plate of meat with baked potatoes rubbed down with garlic (the Stinking Rose doesn't do such wonders with garlic that this place does).   I took a bite of the moussaka with its rich and flavorful bechemal sauce.  Highly recommended.\n\nFinally, we got down to the coffee and dessert.  Our friendly and helpful waiter explained how Greek coffee worked and how to drink it and stop when one hit the graininess of the grounds.  I ordered the galaktoboureko which is almost like a dessert tasting plate with a smooth semolina custard in small cynlinders of filo, pistachio ice cream and the loveliest pieces dates dripping in honey.  My friend had the refreshing granita which was this incredible minty yogurt sorbet on a bed of pomegranate granita. \n\nAfterwards, our bellies full and in dire need of exercise, we \"accidentally\" meandered to Loehmanns, shopped for a couple of hours, and then hit a bar.

We decided to do small plates including the Horiatiki (Greek Salad - their feta is unlike any other), Kalamata Pita (get it every time), Lamb Riblets, Octopus and  a Sardine. Food was brought out as it was ready, which was quite fast. We finished the meal with amazing baklava with a la mode and an espresso, both of which were perfect. Add on a great wine list and you've got yourself a great night for a great price (under $100).\n\nAll my subsequent visits have been just as wonderful and I've had the delight of experiencing the bartenders and the fact they know what they are doing and talking about. \n\nMy favorite part about Kokkari is it's versatility; a great place for a casual lunch, after work cocktail or the start to a wonderful date night.", "author": "Aaron R."}

Today being Monday, I've been trying all weekend to come up with a reason to not give Kokkari five stars. I still can't. Kokkari is to Greek food like Bouchon is to French food. It sticks with what is important; flavor, atmosphere, service and fun. \n\nWe got an 8 o'clock reservation. We were immediately seated even though the restaurant and bar were packed. There was a very nice table waiting for us in the back of the restaurant next to the wine cage. That was great because it was a little quieter back there and the six of us could talk. Our server was very nice, knowledgeable and patient. She walked us through trying to pronounce all the Greek on the menu. We started with a variety of appetizers that were all great. We could have easily filled our time and stomachs with that part of the menu. Which is exactly what I wound up doing. Everything that they brought out was tasty, well prepared and simply presented. My favorites were the lamb riblets and stuffed calamari. The only bad part of the evening was when the busser took my plate with the lamb infused olive oil away before I had finished mopping up all the olive oil with bread. \n\nTwo people had at our table had the rib eye. I got a little taste of one them. I've never tasted beef that was that flavorful. It was amazing. Everyone else at our table enjoyed their entrees as well. \n\nDessert was interesting. We all ordered something and then passed it around. My girlfriend had a sorbet nestled in a bed of granite. The combinations of flavors and textures was perfect! Another friend ordered the yogurt with honey, walnuts and dates. Something so simple but oh so good. The rest our desserts were delicious as well. Even the Chocolate Sundae. (Really, who goes to a Greek restaurant and orders a Sundae?) \n\nWe all waddled out of there 2 hours later. The food was so good I just wanted to keep eating. There are no diminishing returns on flavor here.", "author": "Aaron B."}

In the case of Kokkari, he's absolutely right.  \n\nYou step through the doors and are instantly transported to a beautiful Greek villa, the kind you can't really actually find in Greece.  You may be seated at the long table next to the kitchen, at a cozy booth, or next to the fireplace.  Anywhere you sit, you are sure to be comfortable and feel the relaxed pace of Greece.  \n\nYou'll want to try the appetizer sampler with assortment of dipping sauces for the toasted pita points.  The skewered beef is always a delight.  The side dishes are perfect.  The wine list is excellent.  \n\nSave room for dessert -- the chocolate is heavenly, and the baklava is a wonder!  And coffee -- is very rich, deep, sand-brewed and delectable.  \n\nThey have a beautiful private dining room, great for parties or groups.  \n\nService is exceptional -- so warm, inviting.  The standard is a relaxed pace -- you don't feel like they're trying to turn the tables and oust you before you're ready.  However, if you are on a deadline, they are most accommodating.  \n\nIf you're needing a vacation but can't get away, visit Kokkari for a wonderful repast that will totally refresh you!", "author": "Bevy M."}

Past the bar is a second room that mixes amazingly well a high-tech spotless open kitchen, a glass-enclosed private dining room, exposed beams and standing lamps. Its an atmosphere that manages to be wonderfully romantic and intimate yet energetic and comfortable. Lots of restaurants try for 'casual elegance' but few pull it off the way Kokkari does.\n\nThe food is every bit as good as the atmosphere, possibly even better. If you don't have the lamb as a main dish, at least get it as an appetizer (listed as Arnisia Plevrakia- grilled lamb riblts). Everything on the menu is great, but if you like fish and it happens to be available check out the Lavraki (sea bass). Amazing.\n\nFor all this praise, the thing that makes Kokkari isn't the food or the furniture so much as the people. Management understands that the restaurant is there to make its customers happy and has assembled and trained a staff that takes this seriously. Service is wonderful... attentive without being obsequious, informed without being supercilious, friendly but not intrusive.\n\nI'd expect to spend about $75 a person for normal dinner. On our last visit my wife and I were both eating very lightly and paid $75 plus tip and a $20 bar bill for  two appetizers, an entree, two servings of tea and a dessert.\n\nReservations can be hard to get but the full menu is served at the bar. With a smaller dinning room semi-hidden on a lower level, the venue can also handle private parties of from eight to three hundred.", "author": "Bill S."}

Grilled Octopus- tender and delicious\n2. Meatballs- good but not fabulous, but then again I don't like meatballs that much\n3. Melitzanosalata- A hummus-like puree (I believe fava bean) with house-made pita bread. The pita bread here is off the hook, it will make any lo-carber fall off the wagon!\n\nEntrees:\n1. Grilled Lamb Chops- I'm iffy about lamb and the only place I'll order it is at Kokkari- it has always been excellent, not to lamb-ey, tender and juicy inside and very well seasoned. I think the seasoning of the lamb here gets rid of the gaminess that usually throws me off.\n2. Moussaka- a warm, melting, creamy bowl of comfort!  Contains ground lamb, yogurt bechamel, potatoes i think, and has a yummy spice flavor..kinda like they put a little cinnamon in it.\n\nThe service is excellent- super friendly and warm. I have never had a bad experience here!\n\nGreat for special occasion dinners and groups as well- the restaurant is large and can easily accommodate a large party.

Elevator down to the bathroom and pvt dining room huge. Walking into Kokkari, the first thing you notice is the smell. The smell? Is it good? is it  bad? Its a good thing my little Hercules. The night we went they had a huge pig on the rotisserie covered in bacon. Amazing. I dont eat pork...but i was salivating on the hostess. Poor thing.\n\nWe sat down(obvi) and ended up with the most ADORABLE waiter ever. Overly friendly and spent too much time talking to us. Not a bad thing at all(he was greek) but he was also working. tsk tsk. Started with the skewer of eggplant and artichoke hearts...and then we ordered the whole fish and the halibut. Ended with ouzo and chilled melon with honey and mint. \n\nThere is nothing to complain about. Which is odd. But to me, this place is seemingly perfect. It is affordable, fun, friendly and the perfect place to take out of towners. It IS San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-13", "description": "For awhile now, I have wanted to go to Kokkari, which has commonly been touted as SF's best Greek food.\nI love Greek food, so I was elated to go here last night, practically dancing all the way there.\n \nI love the setup of this restaurant with a large bar in the front area w/ seating in the front area as well as a larger seating area further back.  The seating is great -- heavily cusioned seats in great condition were everywhere. Service was polite and while we had 8 pm reservations - we got seated perphaps closer to 8:45 pm or so.  This wasn't a problem as we just hung out at the bar having a glass of wine.  \n \nTheir wine-by-the-glass list was mediocre, but their bottle wine list was impressive!!\n \nWhen we finally did get seated - service was slow.  I think it took a whole 20 minutes before they even came to take our order - - which again, was not a problem considering we were too busy talking to really care.\n \nNow, I didn't like our server.... starting off with, \"Would you like bottled water on your table or JUST TAP WATER?\"  Why not just tell me you're trying to sell me bottled water instead?  From there, we headed in the wrong direction fast.  I, of course, opted for the tap water, though normally, I might have ordered sparkling water, but the wording just irked me.\n \nThen when he finally did come back - -  we had decided to order the ribeye, but we were debating between lamb shank or lamb chops.  We asked the waiter, who told us, \"This place is open solely due to the lambchops!  Hands down, get the lambchops.\"  Is something wrong w/ calling it a \"signature dish\"?  Now he's irritating me.  \n \nThen when we added that we'd be sharing two appetizers as well - - and listed the Artichoke/Eggplant w/ Yogurt, and Grilled Octopus - --  he exclaims, no joke, \"No way!  Those are my two favorites but I am warning you now, it is WAY too much food!  You have no idea how much food that is - you can't finish it, I'm telling you.\"  Now he's starting  to make my blood curdle.\n \n-  Sigh - \n \nBreathe, Grace - -breathe.\n \nI hate when people tell me \"You have NO idea _______________\".  Usually, they have no idea what I have ideas about.\nSo my reply was a curt:\n\"And you have no idea how much we can or cannot eat.\"\n(Hey, I'm just the tap-water drinking patron... )\n \nHe shrugs and says, \"OK then!\" and walks off.\nGood GRIEF.\n \nNow, for the food.  We shared everything - and the octopus was really good.  The artichoke appetizer was yummy - - solid four stars, and excellent yogurt w/ a hot sauce (that wasn't hot, really) atop it.  For the entrees -- we had ordered the ribeye medium rare, but it came out medium.  We also ordered the lambchops medium-rare, and that came out as requested.  That said, both dishes were prepared well and tasted good.  I've had better cuts of ribeye elsewhere, including my recent visit to Town Hall - - and for being the most expensive thing on the menu, I was underimpressed w/ the quality of meat, though flavor was fine.  The lamb was very good - - but suffered in comparison to the lambchops at Evvia in Palo Alto.  \n \nFor dessert (yeah, we even had dessert, evil waiter-guy), we ordered the flourless chocolate cake which was rich and delicious, but between the two of us, it was almost too rich to finish!!!!   The greek coffee was so-so but I'm not really sure what it's SUPPOSED to taste like - - it was similar to a bland espresso but thicker in texture - and grainy.\n \nThe whole experience rates about 3 stars in my book as far as food goes, but mix in good appetizers, great company, terrific conversation, good wine, and nice ambience, and I'm inclined to give Kokkari 4-stars, though reluctantly.  Having a great night carries some weight.\n\nBut because of that wretched waiter, I clench my teeth trying to keep him out of my final rating of this place  Also, although the busboys were friendly - they whisked away plates without checking to see if we were finished.  If you see food left - - don't whisk away the plates without checking!  The bread they served was tasteless and boring.\n \n$8 for valet  - and they do have a coatcheck for those who need it.  I'd definitely recommend reservations - - it was pretty busy on a Wednesday night w/ plenty of couples waiting at the bar area.  It took us a good 10-15 minutes before we secured seating at the bar.  I'm much happier when I have a seat.  :-)", "author": "Grace K."}

I had the artichoke souvlaki the first time.  That was good, just not awe-inspiring.  The second time I went, I got the moussaka.  That was just WIERD.  I think I expected a Greek lasagna-esque type dish.  I guess it could be described that way, but more importantly, it had a large layer of creamy substance that didn't really mix with the lamb.  \r\n\r\nBut this last time - amazing!  Have the zucchini cakes.  I ordered them with someone who doesn't even like zucchini and we loved them.  The tzaziki was really good too.  One of the two breads they bring is also great - it's some kind of herb foccacia.  And according to my lunch partner the olive oil was good enough to drink.  For my main course I had Wednesday's special - lots of letters that didn't look like they should go together, didn't even try to pronounce it - it's a pork sandwich .  The sandwich came with tasty pork bits, grilled veggies, and tzaziki in a pita.  Super super tasty.  \r\n\r\nThe service here has always been great.  They are attentive but not in your face.  \r\n\r\nGas rating: 3\r\nThat moussaka not only gave me gas, it flat out made my stomach hurt.  The lamb souvlaki also made me a little gassy.

It's a large restaurant -- we were seated in the main (front) dining room (the room with the rotisserie and the fireplace) in a booth.  It was cosy, intimate, fun -- everything I would want from an evening dining out -- and, in fact, a great place to take a date (It's a large place, with several rooms, so if one is taking a date, it may be best to specify).\n\nThere are plenty of vegetarian appetizers; only one vegetarian entree.  Ordinarily, that might offend my sensibilities, but there was no lack of food on this night, and no one would reasonably be rebuffed were they to make a meal out of the various appetizers offered.  Among the apps, we shared the zucchini cakes, the pan fried cheese, the spanikopita, the Greek salad, and my friends had the octopus (which they said was among the finest they've ever sampled).  All was good, but the zucchini cakes stand out as the hands-down favorite.  They were so delicious, I wanted to bend down on one knee and propose.  For an entree, I had the ravoili -- again, the only vegetarian entree on the menu -- and honestly, the least exciting item I sampled on the menu.  I wouldn't order it again.\n\nFor dessert we shared the flourless chocolate cake.  I wouldn't have thought that the Greeks knew much about flourless chocolate cake, but let us not forget their contribution in the field of democracy, modern political and theoretical discourse, and the Olympics.  The Greeks pose the probing question:  Who needs flour after eating something that good?  And I don't even have a sweet tooth.\n\nFor vegetarians, best to come in a crowd, so one can sample the various offerings permitted.  Be forewarned:  this is not an inexpensive outing.  That said, worth it.  The ambiance, the food, the intimacy  all make for a wonderful night out.  Recommended.  I'll be back.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Alas, everyone knows about this Greek restaurant and its fantastic foodstuffs, so be sure to call ahead if you have a large party.  Or be prepared for a ten-year siege on its impregnable walls.\n\nNear Embarcadero at the edge of the Financial District, Kokkari caters to an upscale clientele.  The ambiance is festive, not like the bacchanalia of yore, but much more subdued and refined (though with similar volumes of alcohol available: the wine list was fairly extensive).  The feel of the restaurant was definitely Mediterranean, with large tables, heavy wooden chairs, and shiny copper crockery hanging from the walls, yet a very modern touch to the decor.\n\nThe food was excellent.  The moussaka was one of the best I'd had this side of the Pillars of Herakles.  I chose the roasted chicken as my entree, though I probably should have gone with the more traditional Greek fare.  Regardless, the meat was succulent and saturated with herbs that miraculously complemented each other.  Despite my sophistry, I could find no flaws in the arguments posited by my taste buds (curse them and their Socratic method).  Absolutely delicious.\n\nWhat struck me most about Kokkari, however, was the singular attentiveness paid to my water glass by the ever-alert busboy who catered our table.  This man invariably came running to fill my glass every three to five sips of water.  Never did I reach the halfway mark during my stay at Kokkari!  Like a strangely compulsive Poseidon, he devotedly brought me the very element he commanded, keeping me hydrated and within homeostatic bounds throughout the night.  His curvaceous pitcher was his Amphitrite, well-instructed in the ways of watery, refreshing pleasure.  Together, they would drown me in their clear, trickling love and attention...\n\nFour and a half stars for Kokkari, plus another half star for this wondrous waterboy.

I could linger at my table all night chewing the fat as I chew the fat off this phenomenally tasty piece of meat.   I practically had to engage in armed combat with my dining companions in order to get my fair portion.  I would highly advise you to order this appetizer, or depending on your party size, several orders of it.\n\nNow for what I consider the single greatest piece of meat it has been my pleasure to ingest: the grilled lamb shank (over orzo).  I try to avoid calling any piece of meat \"succulent,\" since I think that work is overused and abused, usually just denoting an especially good meat.  No, I mean, per Mssrs. Merriam and Webster, that this lamb shank was both \"(1) full of juice [and] (2) moist and tasty.\" May I also add \"tender\" and \"literally falling off the bone\" to the descriptions offered by my lexicographer friends?\n\nI also sampled a few other entrees here but none would compare to the lamb shank.

No matter who I'm here with (and it's usually for business, so I can't be my typical menu-nazi self), no matter what time of day, someone ALWAYS wants to order the spreads.\n\nWhy such a crisis?  Because the spreads are boring.  They are possibly the MOST boring of all the apps.  And there is some good stuff here: giant baked white beans, stuffed calamari, meatballs, any seasonal vegetable or special salad, even the zucchini cakes... why go for the spreads?  Of course once they are on the table I will eat them, thereby reducing stomach space for other good things to come.  Why can't we for once just take a pass? \n\nOf course, the spread-orderer then goes for the second most-boring thing on the menu: the kabobs.  Sure, they are decent kabobs (and unusual in that they are not so dry as to choke you immediately).  But they are kabobs.  Meat on a stick... served with the same accoutrements as the spreads.  What, you didn't get enough tzatziki and pita?  Here you go!  (This is an especially flagrant offense at dinner time, when there are spit-roasted meats --- duck, baby lamb, suckling pig --- to choose from.  Fools!)\n\nI, on the other hand, commit no such ordering atrocities.  For a long time, my go-to lunch was the whole grilled fish.  Sole or bass, fresh, local, light and clean, drizzled with olive oil and lemon... nice seasonal veg subbed for the stringy over-boiled greens that usually accompany... life was good.  But then I discovered the lamb chops. \n\nThese were chops to be reckoned with.  Big, robust, meaty, perfectly charred on the outside and a gorgeous pink-red all the way through.  With some crisp-yet-buttery potatoes... what was I thinking, wasting lunches on fish all those times?\n\nUnfortunately, on my most recent visit, said chops were overcooked to the point of mostly gray toughness, forcing me to saw unattractively at the area closest to the bone to find some rosy flesh.  I remembered the pink perfection of chops past and sighed...\n\nBut was not disappointed for long, because it was then dessert time, and Kokkari's desserts kick ass.  All of them.  Rice pudding, baklava, whatever fruit tart is right at the time, monster ice cream sundae that other restos should look to for sundae perfection, the requisite flourless chocolate cake done phenomenally well, and my absolute favorite, the custard-filled pastry that sounds meh but is knock-your-socks-off tasty.

We had the loveliest moussaka, fish entrees and everything Greek esp hummus and olives! \nAfter reading all the captivating reviews on Yelp, we've decided to try this place out. We were early for our reservation and was told to return closer to our time. When we showed up, we still had to wait for a few minutes (we noticed this was the norm since other couples or diners were told the same).\n\nWe were whisked to the back room which was a nice relief since we saw 3 other couples being seated in the main area, just a stone's throw from the entrance in this tight and crammed table area which diners would definitely stare at them when waiting or walking in, not a very romantic spot. Well, then again, the restaurant's noise level is high so it's definitely not your pin drop type of ambience. \n\nOur server was super nice and friendly and told us the special for the evening. Bf settled for the duck special which was oven roasted to perfection, succulent and just had pure tenderness. I was craving moussaka from our Greek trip so I settled for that. For starter, we had tzatziki and pita bread....pita bread was warm, soft and so good, just fabulous! The sides of olive oil and olives were fabulous as well. \n\nFor dessert, we were tempted to go for the Greek yoghurt but the server reminded us that he has yoghurt for dessert so we settled for his suggestion of Galaktoboureko - Traditional semolina custard in filo with warm quince spoon sweet & lemon-sage ice cream, delicious and a nice finishing touch. We'll go back to try the lamb the next time. The duck and moussaka this time satisfied us very well. :)\n\nOh yes, do take the elevator to the lovely and spacious restrooms at the basement level. So clean and in a bright red color!! Love it. :) A nice touch....When I was downstairs, I also snuck a peek into the Hania room which is a private room which sits about 6 people, would be a fabulous experience for a small group and esp for the special occassion with a close group of your closest friends or family. \n\nSigh, this dining experience made us wanna return for a trip to the Greek islands soon.", "author": "Yan M."}

We were pretty excited considering the glowing reviews on Yelp, and I have to say, we weren't too disappointed, although not overwhelmed. Having said that, I don't think we experienced the restaurant at its best.\n\nWe arrived on time for our 9:30 reservation, and were told by the delightful hostess that there was a 15-20 minute wait - which meant we would be eating at almost around 10 pm. I didn't mind too much - I like sitting at the bar before a meal. The problem was that there was no seating at the bar, and there was nowhere that was not awkward to stand either. Not their fault, I suppose, although it would be nice if they had some way of more graciously handling this.\n\nThe price of a glass of wine was a little breathtaking. My Viogner was pleasant but not really more outstanding than a wine I've paid less for elsewhere. My partner's Merlot was pretty exceptional, however. \n\nWe were seated between a server station and a rather loud couple - not really conducive to a romantic Valentine's Day meal. I was bumped into a number of times by servers passing by - I schooched our table in a little toward the loud couple to alleviate this - my partner and I didn't need to talk, much, anyway :) Next time I will request a booth.\n\nOur main server, who was really quite wonderful, explained how our menu would be served, what would be brought automatically and what we could choose (the entree and desserts). He offered us tap water (which I thought was a little manipulative, because who wants to drink tap water? Why not filter it?) and I asked for panna, which was also quite pricey. \n\nWe were brought a little dish of marinated olives - I think usually this comes with some bread, which would have been nice, since the olives were very salty.  I much preferred the meaty, firm Kalamata olives that came with the appetizers and salad. We began with a dish of spreads:  melitzanosalata  - a delicious eggplant relish reminiscent of babaganoush but less creamy, more fresh and chunky;  tzatziki - a wonderful creamy yoghurt and cucumber spread, redolent with garlic; and a lovely fresh and light taramosalata, a dip made from smoked cod or carp roe blended with lemon juice, olive oil and a little bread, one of my favorite things, and now one of my partner's favorites :) This was served with little warm flaky buttery triangles of spanikopita, fresh cuke spears, passable dolmathes (I like mine better) and  fresh fluffy pita bread. \n\nNext, they brought us a classic Greek salad which featured an incredibly special feta - creamy and 'sheepy', very fresh. I did not like the tomatoes, which could have been riper, and would have been better if they were not refrigerated - they were a little mealy. \n\nThis was followed by grilled octopus, which was something in between what I've had before and what the most glowing Yelp reviews report - a tiny bit chewy, but not unpleasantly so, yet not outstanding. I refer to my earlier qualifier. It must have been a stressful night for the restaurant.\n\nOnce the lamb riblets arrived, I was beginning to feel as if  more food was a bad idea. They were nicely prepared, not overly spiced, just a little olive oil and lemon - I wished for a little bread to mop up the juices and oils, but the pita was long gone :( \n\nFor our entree, we ordered the \"Thalasina Scharas Yia Dio - mixed seafood grill for two of whole Mediterranean sea bass, prawns, mussels, & calamari, roasted fennel & braised gigante beans with black olive\" (there was no black olive).  I was really too full at this point to enjoy the subtle flavors of the perfectly-cooked seafood - I had a little of everything but we ended up taking most of it home. The roasted fennel was lovely - I usually braise it but I really enjoyed the firm texture and fresh flavor of the roasted veggie. I wish there had been more of that.\n\nStrangely enough, when it came time for dessert, my brain overrode my tummy and temporarily I had room for just a bit more. My partner ordered the baklava, which came warm with vanilla praline ice cream. I joked with him that I bet it would not be as good as my homemade version but it really was! \n\nI ordered the Galaktoboureko. The word 'sumptuous' accurately describes this dessert - two cigars of buttery, flaky phyllo surrounding a rich semolina custard,  Meyer lemon spoonsweet (which was sort of like a marmalade but with thicker slices of Meyer lemon, truly divine) & cr\u00e8me fraiche ice cream. We shared a glass of lovely citrusy Eiswein that perfectly complimented the desserts.\n\nI believe we'll come back for appetizers and maybe share an entree - the food is very good, authentic; the prices for bevvies are too high (Kokkari, please consider offering filtered water!). The atmosphere and service are really excellent, although I will be assertive about requesting a quieter, less vulnerable spot next time :)", "author": "Marianne S."}

I was the only lady and lowest on the totem pole of our group of 6.  The host ordered 3 dips to start which I thought was an unadventurous choice, but probably appropriate for this corporate crew.  I had forgotten how amazing their pita bread is!  The very Greek server described the specials in detail in an almost dramatic fashion that I found very charming, but my lunchmates sort of snickered at (boo).  I ordered the octopus salad (crickets from the group) while the men lamely ordered greek salads (really?) or whole fish.  Everyone loved the meal, as expected.  \nAnyway, it's not like Kokkari needs yet another 5 star review, but I wanted to mention that if you're going to go, please don't order a plain old greek salad.

Damn good lamb!\n\nWifey's been on the warpath lately.  She says I spend too much time at the gym, or surfing the web, or watching TV, nag, nag, nag.  I guess it was gettin' to me because I woke up in a cold sweat the other night with her squeaky, high-pitched voice echoing in my head.\n\n\"Do you love me?  But do you really love me!?!?\"\n\"Would you be really sad if I was run over by a bus?\"\n\"Ten more minutes!  I need to fix my make-up!\"\n\"Does this dress make me look fat?\"\n\nWhy do women torment us with these impossible questions!?!?!\n\nTo regain my sanity and appease the she-devil, I booked a night out at Kokkari.  If memory served me, the soothing Mediterranean surroundings and fancy-schmancy  fireplace would calm her like smoke on an angry hornet... or so I'd hoped.\n\nNot an easy place to book, after seven years, the place is still pretty popular.  Perhaps it's the nice location down by the Embarcadero?\n\nAfter a warm greeting by our hostess, we're seated promptly in the back dining room with a nice view of the open kitchen.  I smell roasting meat, lemon, and oregano and my body goes limp from pleasure.  Even wifey looks less scary by the light of the fire.\n\nAfter a zesty octopus appetizer, I move onto the main event... the lamb.  Soooo tender, soooo juicy.  Oooooohhh!\n\nWifey went for the whole roasted branzini special, and I was mighty glad she did.  After one mouthful of the perfectly cooked and succulent fish, she was a sweetheart the rest of the evening.

As we walk through the entire restaurant I got to see all of the beautiful decor.  The decor is very nice, it reminds me of a very nice estate type place with a gorgeous fireplace in the front room.  As we sit at our table we are greeted by our server who proceeded t greet each and every one of us. He was extremely polite and quite knowledgeable of every dish. The way it should be (I have special dietary needs... he answered all of my questions). \n\nThis is what I got to try before the main dish:\n- Fried Smelts - with garlic-potato skordalia & lemon 7.50\n- Wood Oven Roasted Prawns - with tomato sauce & feta cheese 12.75 \n- Gigantes - oven-baked giant beans with tomato sauce, olive oil & herbed feta 7.50\n\nEntre:\nGrilled Lamb Chops - with lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes 27.50 \nThis was the most delicious lamb I have ever had at a restaurant.  I ordered it medium-well and when I got it, it was cooked to perfection.  The dish brings three huge wedges of golden delicious potatoes and 3 lamb chops. I love how they wrap the lemon in cheesecloth to prevent the seeds from getting in your food.... lovely! \n\nThen came time for the dessert. Everyone ordered one and the sharing began... I am not much of a sweets person, so my choice of the Rizogalo (arborio rice pudding with caramelized pear) 6.50 was fabulous!  \n\nThe other ones I had a try at:\n\nYiaourti me Meli - (Greek yogurt with spiced walnuts & dates drizzled with Greek Attiki honey) 7.00 - A very delicious combination with the most delicious honey. A little too sweet for me, but it was good. \n\nSokolatina (Flourless dark chocolate cake with sweetened whipped cream) 8.50 - I am not a sweets person... and I am really not a chocolate cake person either, but this chocolate cake was right on the mark with enough sweetness to satisfy and perfectly moist with a nice little side of whipped cream. \n\nI had a Moroccan tea to wash down the dessert after drinking Pellegrino as if it was going out of style (the servers keep refilling my glass!!  This is a definitely plus!)  \n\nWhat to wear: It is a dressy, business like atmosphere among the patrons. Suits galore, power lunches, it is in the FiDi and it seems to attract losts of business people.  \n\nThis was a great lunch and going with a large group allowed us to try a lot of the great food available here.  \n\nWould I go back, you bet your 5 stars I will!

Greeted by the most friendly, attentive waiter you could hope for. Very nice, knowledgable, and ... just made us feel very comfortable. He advised us on some drinks (brought me some sort of Greek absynth that ended up being the highlight of our night!), and brought us a sampler of appetizers. The lamb ribs he brought were UBER fatty. I'm talking, 20% bone, 10% meat, 70% fat. The grilled octopus (that I had read about and was excited to try) tasted rubbery ... and ... well, rubbery. No particular flavor. \n\nMy buddy and I split the fish for two plate ... it came with 8 amazing prawns ... but the fish itself was bland ... and the mussels on the plate tasted like they had been freshly peeled of Pier 39 that day (thats to say, they tasted like ugly sea water. YUCK!). We both grabbed the mussels straight away hoping for a good experience. We ate one each, and had them take away the remaining 12. Felt like it was going to make us both sick.\n\nThe women ordered a greek salad and a ravioli dish respectively. The salad was fresh and solid, but nothing special. The ravioli was the winner at the table. My wife loved it. But with disappointing appetizers, bland fish, disgusting mussels ... the ravioli simply wasn't enough to salvage the trip for me.\n\nAmbiance was so-so.

We started with a selection of the small plates that included the prawns, giant beans, some sort of fried Greek cheese, the trotters (which were surprisingly good), but the star of the small plates was the grilled calamari with black olives, fennel and orange.  Holy cow, that was the best calamari I've ever had in my life!  Our large plates consisted of the goat stew, some ravioli and of course the lamb chops.  Everything was amazing and the waiter helped us pair up some wines.  For dessert I had the baclava with praline ice cream and it was darn good.\n\nThe ambiance of the place, too, deserves mention.  The restaurant is deceptively large when you get inside.  There is a rustic sort of feel with all the wood and what looked like wrought iron or something to me (sorry I'm not so sophisticated).  In the main dining room people looked really comfortable in high-backed chairs with arms and plush cushioning.  We wound up in the back back room (beyond the back room) I am only assuming because of the size of our party, which was seven.

I enjoyed the fava beans the most with the pod intact , it had a nice crispness on the outside and a smooth bite on the inside. \n\nFor the main course, I ordered the lamb chops and I'm not a lamb kind of girl but I decided to take a risk since that is what Kokkari is known for. It was a good choice! Usually lamb has a gaminess taste but I didn't taste any of that. The potatoes that are accompanied with it are top notch. Its got a lemon/herb taste that is somehow infused into the potato wedges. They've got this in the mezes list if you are not into the lambchops, so try it out. \n\nFor dessert we ordered the Yiaourti Granita (yogurt w/ fruit granita and mint syrup) as well as the Galaktoboureko  (custard in phyllo). I liked the lightness of the combination in the granita and yogurt. The Galaktoboureko's custard is not at all like the custards that I am normally accustomed to. Its like a puree but tasty nonetheless. \n\nThe service was great and the environment can be very noisy but that didn't stop the parents of baby that was sitting at one of the tables nearby   (just to note, from experience... babies can sleep thru anything).

(they are super nice, knowledgeable and passionate about the menu, and are super classy--take your coat and give u a number, pull out your chair and they hold your leftovers until you are paid and ready to go) the drinks are right on! (don't have a cocktail menu which means they can make ANYTHING---of course they didnt have blueberry stoli since its my new fave cocktail, whatev..not the end of the world--got a really strong rasp. vodka tonic instead followed by a delish pinot noir), great wine selection ranging from $9 a glass to $950 bottles.....and the food.....i don't know if i can even go into detail without drooling all over the keyboard and shorting the circuit but i'll try....\n\n....so we started with the homemade pita and three dips (Melitzanosalata, Favosalata & Tirosalata --one of eggplant, one of fava beans, and then one made of feta and peppers) served on a plate with fresh, thick pita, olives, cucumbers and a couple of dolmas....then i had a simple salad with huge chunks of feta and fresh herbs and the Galeos as my main dish (halibut steak atop a thick roasted potato with fire roasted summer peppers & artichoke with black olives & capers)---yes!!! it was super tasty and aesthetically pleasing as well! some guy walking by even had to do a double-take and ask me what it was.....fricken delectable. that's what!!!\ni would be willing to choke on a few fish bones as long as i could get a taste of this dish!!!\n\nand then for dessert we had  semolina custard in filo with ice cream and a reduction of myer lemon rinds......which was light but filling and new to me (which is always exciting)...who would have thought that the thick, inedible peel of a lemon could taste soo good?!\n\ni took home a bunch of leftovers and had them last night and even those deserve 5 stars!!!!\n\ni most definitely recommend this dining experience and cannot wait until i go back!!!", "author": "Kaylan S."}

We got 7:30p reservations and were seated in the front room (highly recommended by the way).  I started with a glass of Prosecco which was delicious, not too sweet.  We ordered Saghanaki and Kalamari to start.  Something about grilled, melted cheese doused in oil and lemon brings smiling and giggling.  The calamari was great, stuffed with feta and rounded out with the acidity from fenal and orange.  I really want to come back and try more of the small plates but we opted for entrees this evening.\n\nHubby had the lamb chops, perfectly seasoned and cooked to a proper medium. I ordered the fish, which was grilled, deboned and served with the head.  The Chipmunks \"Fish Head Song\" kept running through my head the whole time I enjoyed it (the Prosecco and wine probably helped it along).  It was a light flaky white fish and I couldn't pronounce the name of it even if I remembered it.  I ordered a glass of the Santirini white which was an amazing pairing.  \n\nWe ordered Greek coffee, which was the only ehh part of the night, and debated over flourless chocolate cake and the semolina custard in filo.  Our waiter told us to go with the cake and brought out the custard filled filo on him!  Ahh, so sweet.  Plus, while the cake was to die for, rich and moist and of course chocolaty, I couldn't pull myself away from the other dessert.  It was like a creme brulee Hot Pocket!!  So delicious.

Kokkari earned every one of those stars and is well worth the expense.  The service was impeccable, and I highly recommend you request Abel as your server.  He was not only attentive, considerate, humorous, and knowledgeable, (characteristics I think should almost be standard in a $$$ restaurant) but he also went the extra mile at  every opportunity.  From bringing us appetizer plates with extra servings to accommodate the size of our party to giving advice on where to find markets with inexpensive halloumi cheese (a crowd favorite prior to dining), Abel was amazing.  The host also took time to come over and speak with us for no other reason than to ensure that we were well taken care of and having a good time.\n\nThe decor is well though-out, authentic, and homey, with a hearth burning in the corner, setting the tone for you to cuddle in as you succumb to a seemingly home-cooked meal. As for the food-- wow.  I can't add too much more than what has already been described as amazing in the 600+ reviews that proceed me.  I had the moussaka and loved it, and don't generally even eat meat, let alone lamb!  My restaurant club counterparts also raved about the lamb chop, lamb special, and halibut special.  We also ordered almost every appetizer and every dessert on the menu, and I can't say a single bad thing about any of them.\n\nI am thoroughly impressed with Kokkari, and that is no easy feat given my admittedly high expectations.

Due to the night I expected a deterioration in either food quality or service.  But it was in fact my best experience there.  They were incredibly attentive with their service.  The fixed price menu of $75 per person was worth every penny.  They provided a terrific set price menu with lots of choice and picked fantastic dishes for the menu.  The only thing is that there was so much food that I think the entire restaurant left with their dessert and more in a box. \n\nI think when a restaurant caters for Valentine's Day so magnificently that it makes you realize that they really appreciate their customers.

The food was VERY rich however, and I couldn't eat at all the next day.  It's also a high-end restaurant with a full bar (usually Greek food isn't at high-end restaurants).\n\nBest Appetizers (in order of amazing, from most to least, but least was still better than 75% of restaurants)\n*  Tzatziki & Favosalata with Pita - OMG.  I kept eating these, they were incredible.  Never in my life have I tasted such pita!  It was pillowy, soft, and had the slightest hint of herbs.  Dear Lord, I hope Heaven's restaurant serves such good pita.  Otherwise all my charity work would have been in vain.\nThe tzatziki is incredibly rich & creamy, with pieces of dill & cucumber, I'm pretty sure they used whole milk Greek yogurt.  Tasted a lot like high-end cream cheese.\nFavosalata - take the BEST hummus you've ever tasted.  Now multiply it X 1000 and you've got the taste of their favosalata.  It was rich, creamy, and tart.  \n*  Saghanaki - fried cheese.  It's not feta, but it tastes a lot like a combination of feta & parmegiano reggiano.  It was incredible.  It's soaked in lemon and olive oil, but the cheese is crispy so it's a mix of crispy & soft textures.  It's very tart but strangely addictive.  \n*  Dolmathes - grape leaves stuffed with rice, dill & mint.  Usually most restaurants make these too bland or too vinegar-y.  These were the most perfect dolmathes I have ever tasted - just tart enough without being too tart.\n*  Soutzoukakia - lamb meatballs in marinara & Greek yogurt.  Think meatballs with VERY concentrated lamb flavor.\n\nMy entree:\nI got Souvlaki apo Entosthia, which is organ meats on a skewer, with spiced potato wedges.  Sounds unappetizing, right?  Most of my colleagues got lamb, and it was pretty average.  But organ meats are very rich, creamy, and fatty, with highly concentrated flavor.  One of the other people at my dinner party tried my dish, and said it was MUCH better than the external cuts of lamb.  \nThe spiced potato wedges were comparable to KFC's but less salty, they were very good.\n\nI finished off the meal with regular coffee.\n\nThere's a few things you should NOT order: \nAppetizers:  \n* Melitzanosalata (an eggplant dip like baba ganoush which was very bland)\n* Octapodaki - grilled octopus, these tasted like grilled chicken and were nothing extraordinary.  I expected them to be slimy like calamari but they had the same texture & taste as chicken.  \n* Brussels sprouts (tasted too smoky for me)\nDesserts:\n* Rizogalo - rice pudding with roasted peach.  It was far too sweet, and tasted like over-sugared oatmeal\n* Greek coffee - it had no flavor and lots of grounds.  \n(if you want coffee - get the regular coffee, that was fine)", "author": "Bee M."}

SO yummy :) We also ordered the zucchini cakes which were absolutely amazing! It was quite small though, but the flavor wasn't so it's okay. Our waiter suggested the \"Domata Salata\" which was the heirloom tomato salad. I was a bit disappointed. It was pretty much 5 slices of tomatoes with feta cheese and some spinach on top. It tasted really good, but I would've much rather have eaten an actual salad lol. I loved the ambience. It was nice, good lighting. Our server was also REALLY nice! i liked him. When my bf went to the bathroom, I told him that it was his bf's bday and he brought out a really cute ice cream sundae at the end of our meal :) loved it! My only complaint is that we were seated super close to another couple that was \"cupcaking\" off the hook lol! kind of awkward right? All in all, I had a great experience and I would not mind going again!\n\nYUM!!", "author": "Soumary A."}

What better way to spend eternity than blanketed in creamy bechamel, lying on a bed of savory tender lamb and eggplant in a beautiful harmonic balance?\n\nThis is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  The warm interior, friendly staff, and atmospheric fireplace make every meal here a little special.\n\nDefinitely get some fresh feta as an appetizer, it's addictive.  Personally, I have a hard time straying from the moussaka as an entree--it comes in a tiny little crock, and you may think it's a little small when it's placed in front of y ou, but it is so rich and delicious that your tummy will be very happy with this size.  \n\nThis is a favorite gathering spot for some of my oldesf friends in the city once or twice a year, when we toast the future and relive the past, all between bites of Greek deliciousness.", "author": "Kevin S."}

As far as dress code goes, as long as you're wearing at least a collared / buttoned shirt or a nice sweater, you won't feel out of place (a few previous yelpers said they felt underdressed). Business casual or dressy is probably the best way to go in this joint.\n\nService was good, not much to say on that front except that it lets you concentrate on the food itself. Zucchini cakes were almost like crab cakes, pretty good. I had the special which was sea bass with a tomato base sauce, choice of oven or grilled. I chose oven and it came out perfect, deboned, very soft and tender. My gf had the ravioli which was good but nothing extraordinary. The meat dishes looked really good but because I was partially abstaining for Lent, I couldn't partake in any of the different meat varietals they had. One day I'll have to go back for the meat. Place was filled so definitely seems like a popular place for Greek food. Baklava with ice cream was alright. I never had baklava before but it's a bit too sweet for me because of all the honey they put in it. I'm sure it's a good treat for those who like it though so don't take my word for it. Bill came out to be $100 for appetizer, two entrees, glass of wine, and dessert which I was fine with since it was for a special occasion.", "author": "David N."}

Because of this, I'm irritated when someone pronounces \"Gyro\" wrong, I really know a good bowl of Avgolemono when I taste one, and I realize that Kokkari has the best Greek food on earth. That is not an exaggeration. \n\nI've been to Kokkari a few times, and each time I go, I fall more and more in love. The grilled octopus is one of my favorite dishes, but the lamb riblets, the Saghanaki (fried cheese), and the zucchini cakes are all fantastic. It's best to go with a large group, and order dishes to share...that way you won't miss out on any of these Greek delicacies.\n\nService is always impeccable. On our last visit, our server offered expert advice on both dishes, as well as wines to pair with them. Even at the bar, both drink and food service is fantastic.\n\nIf you're looking for a cozy spot, be sure to request a seat by the fire.", "author": "Brianne K."}

Trust me, in a city with a cornucopia of  \"casual\" fine dining options (all with steep fine dining prices of course), I'd take the white table linens and friendly service at Kokkari, any day. It's a value thing, really.\n\nWhat do I mean? Well, when you first step in the first thing you notice is how luxurious everything looks in the natural lighting that imbues everything from all sides. Then as the host takes you to your seat, you'll notice the quaint bread station, the open kitchen with its wonderful smells and the long chef's table that gives the main dining room an authentic but refined rustic feeling. There is no fake Greek theme feeling here.\n\nThe menu is a trip if you're not familiar with Greek food. I distinctly remember being quite lost the first two times I've been there. But not to worry - the wait staff is very helpful and is quick to provide recommendations. The portions are fairly generous. The last time we went, my friend and I had the combo appetizer (their Tzatziki and Dolmathes are amazing), the jumbo prawn feta dish (very tasty and fresh), a classic Greek salad to share, and for our main dish my friend had the spinach feta ravs and I had the roasted chicken. The chicken was tasty, but I can't say it was amazing (not like Zuni's chicken, but then again, it wasn't fifty bucks, either). Needless to say, we were stuffed! \n\nThe only unfortunate thing that happened during my last visit there was that I asked the busboy who cleared the table to box my entr\u00e9e as I barely had touched it (I was pretty full) and I think he forgot. The chicken had flown the coop! I'm sure if I had said anything they would have offered to bring me a whole new entr\u00e9e, but I was too impatient to wait and I really didn't feel like carrying anything back with me anyway.", "author": "Jeff K."}

I'd noted on the Open Table reservation that we were celebrating a birthday.  The waiter asked whose birthday it was, and when desserts were brought out, Happy Birthday was written on my boyfriend's plate (in chocolate sauce) and there was a candle.  I didn't say a word, it just happened.  Nice touch ... a nice subtle acknowledgment befitting such a nice place.\n\nAnd oh the place - so warm, so inviting - something about it just felt classy yet homey.  I felt very comfortable there - super nice but not pretentious in the least.  Also, points for seating us right away even though we ended up getting there 30 mins early.

I'm glad I decided to go.  The Tuesday before I left for San Francisco, I called and made a reservation for that Saturday (9/13).  \n\nTo my surprise, I got a call Friday morning (I was already in town) confirming my reservation.  Upon my arrival, I was greeted warmly and promptly shown to my table.  After I was seated my waiter, Chris, came over and introduced himself.  He asked if I wanted bottled or tap water.  After making my choice, he returned with the water and olive oil (the bread arrived almost immediately after I sat down).  \n\nHe then gave me a few minutes to look over the menu.  I was trying to decide between  2 appetizers and he suggested a 3rd, the roasted red peppers stuffed with Kefelegravia cheese.  I was also torn between several wines, when he suggested the '07 Vina Godeval, Godello from Valdeorras.  Too bad this didn't come in a half bottle.  Both were great recommendations.  \n\nChoosing an entree' was again a problem.  Since I'd been in town, I already had steak and lamb and I didn't really want chicken.  The woman at the table next to me had the grilled halibut and said it was delicoius.  After hearing what the specials were, I decided on the halibut.  \n\nWhile enjoying the peppers, a manager (or owner?) stopped by to check on how everything was going so far.  Nice touch.  The halibut arrived, accompanied by a succotash of grilled corn, squash and red peppers.  \n\nAfter dinner, I had a cup of coffe.  No Greek coffee for me, that stuff would make hair on a bald man grown.  I decided that I needed to have dessert.  I settled on Soklatina, a flourless chocolate cake served with a dolop of fresh whipped cream.  I was in heaven.  I have no idea how the pastry chef did it, but the cake was about an inch high.  I've never seen flourless cake that high before.  \n\nWhile eating, I got to watch a guy make coffee the Greek way.  He would put the coffee and milk in a little copper kettle and then set it in a large copper drum, that was filled with sand.  The sand was heated by a fire underneath.  The sand would then heat up the coffee/milk mixture.  \n\nI had a great meal here and would return again.  The service was exceptional and the food even better.  When leaving, I went out to catch a cab, but since the restaurant is located in the Finacial district, and it was Saturday, there weren't any.  The hostess called a cab for me, which arrived in about 5 minutes.\n\nI do have on gripe, though.  Before packing, I made sure to check the dress code of each place I planned on going to.  The dress code for Kokkari is dressy.  Ladies, that does not mean capris and flip flops or jeans and a T-shirt and gym shoes.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

They forgot to give us a choice between which vegetable so we had the very unappealing and very unappetizing braised greens.\n\nWhen I think of grilled fish I normally think of mesquite grilled, and its usually thick meaty fish opposed to something as delicate as sole. So what happens with this type of grilling is the contact isn't directly on the grill but the fish is still being touched by the flames. You get a crisp skin on the outside but the inside meat is still very moist like it was oven baked or steamed.\n\nI personally wish it wasn't sole because I'm not a huge fan of its thin meat, I like to eat larger bites of meat. I think the snapper would have been pretty good with its oily texture. But for the type of fish it was, the fish was very well prepared. I bet if it had roasted potatoes and tomatoes it would have blown this dish off the charts.\n\nFinally my dish, the Soulva Tis Emeras (daily rotisserie)\n\nLet me tell you a little about the Red Wattle pork. When our waiter first told us about it, I was surprised because usually you don't hear much about people describing the TYPE of pork you get, it's usually just WHERE the pork is from. I decided to do a little bit of research on this specific piggy myself.\n\nThe Red Wattle Heirloom pig is a dying breed of pig. Not because its being over-consumed but because it's not being \"produced\" in high enough quantities. Most of the time when people grow pigs they not only sell the meat but the lard as well. As silly as this may sound, the RW is not a fat pig, so it lacks in lard. Since farmers are looking to maximize profits they don't often grow this pig. SO at one point it almost died out completely. There were probably TWO herds of these pigs in all of America in the early 1900's.\n\nIn 2006 they were still considered severely endangered species of pig and there were to one expert's opinion only about 300 left in existence and they all lived in Texas. (Same Herd, hence the heirloom label). (read here for a long story, pretty interesting) More and more people are trying to grow these pigs now because upscale diners are bored of normal pork meat, and as they should be since pork at a nice restaurant is usually something I avoid (tends to be dry and requires alot of sauce for flavor).\n\nBut look no further for the pork revolution. If it was my choice I'd mass produce these puppies (piggies) c(piggies) cause the meat is without a doubt the best pork I've had in my life. Tender, flavorful, perfect trim of fat, all come out to make the greatest piece of pork that has ever come into my mouth. It's really unlike any other type of pork. I mean you either have porkchops which tend to dry out, or you get slow cooked pork that splits up in strips. Nothing as easy to slice through like this pork.\n\nAt Kokkari, they chopped the meat right off the spit, put some spiced oils on top, pan fried the skin and called it a day. The dish itself is a little bit oily, I could use a few tablespoons less of olive oil but I was blown away by the quality of the meat. The simplicity in which they made this dish speaks wonders to the quality of the meat itself. Words cannot adequately described the heaven I was in after eating the pork. All I know is, if you ever see Red Wattle Pork anywhere.. you need to order it.\n\nFinally we have dessert, the Galaktoboereko.\n\nCreme filled Fila dough with roasted apricot on the outside and a scoop of ice cream. The dish was good.. but not great. The dessert actually reminded me of those cream cheese toaster strudels you can get in your freezer section at the local supermarket. I like them, but I don't like paying $8 for two.", "author": "Charlie F."}

The great thing about this restaurant is that's it's pretty accessible if you don't have a car, since it's a walking distance fromt the Embarcadero station. This restaurant is huge! What we ordered that night was the taramasalata, the chanterelle and haloumi, and goat stew (off menu, but be sure to ask your waiter about it, it's fantastic!).  Our food came pretty fast considering that it was PACKED that night. The taramasalata was pretty tasty and filling for a starter, but the only strange thing about it is the bread that they serve alongside for dipping. Then came the chanterelles. Do order these, especially if you love mushrooms. The cheese does not overwhelm the mushrooms and compliments it perfectly. The main course however, is the thing to shout about. The goat stew with rice-shaped pasta (absorbs the flavour of the sauce, delish!) is served in a mini clay dish, still simmering, dotted with generous servings of feta and has the strong fragrance of herbs. Although we couldn't finish (the goat stew is very filling), definitely do pack up any goat stew leftovers; it's just as fantastic the next day. We finished our dinner with Greek coffee, which was pretty interesting (in a good way). The waitstaff were very friendly and courteous, and not snooty like you would usually expect in more expensive restaurants, which is a great plus.\n\nThe only con about this place is that you have to take a lift to get down to the washrooms, and it moves at a glacial pace.

I walked into the back kitchen, gave the cooks a few hi fives but still couldn't find it. Finally I realized I had to actually take an elevator downstairs.

There are other Greek restaurants in the city but Kokkari is top notch.\n\nAside from the amazingly delicious food--ask the waiter to recommend something--the decor and service are spectacular. You definitely want to make reservations and dress up a little.

The two medium-sized lamb chops were seasoned to perfection and finished with a crisp crust. The succulent meat was cooked medium rare as requested and served with golden brown fingerling potatoes. There were no heavy sauces or strong flavors to take away from the naturally savory taste of lamb. \n\nBoth of my colleagues had the grilled octopus salad, which looked and smelled delicious (though I did not deign to eat off their plates since we were on a business lunch). \n\nThe unadorned wood furniture and decor evoked the ambience of a rustic country kitchen and set the stage for a fresh and delicious meal.  \nTo top it off, our attentive and amiable waitress had a great sense of humor and not a glimmer of snobbery.", "author": "Chris T."}

The service is also excellent. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. \n\nWhen it comes to the food: I actually thought the appetizers were better than the main courses.  We tried the Saghanaki which is pan fried cheese with lemon and oregano and is delicously salty. Also in the appetizer section, we tried the Soutzoukakia which are meatballs. These were also excellent. \n\nThe main course consisted of lamb chops. I was a little disappointed by these since they lacked some flavor. The other dish was the grilled fish which was excellent but again a little low on flavor.  \n\nFinished up with some Baklava that was excellent!

The zucchini cakes with dill sauce were awesome (I am craving them right now) and the spanakotiropita (spinach, filo dough & cheese) were very good as well.\n\nFor my main course I ordered fish that came with potatoes, pomegranate seeds and whole cloves of garlic, which was delicious. The rib-eye steak was also really good and was served with spinach and potatoes. \n\nI wish we had ordered desserts, but we were too full.

The food, the decor, the atmosphere..just amazing.\n\nI came here for my company's Holiday Luncheon and boy was I glad we did.\n\nWe had made reservations a month in advance and that's the only way they will book the table for you. It has to be exactly a month prior to the day you show up. I did not make the reservations so that had no effect on me. \n\nAnyways, we were seated around a round table (I LOVE round tables, it's much more personable) and the service was light, quick, and very attentive in a discreet way (the best service you can ask for). Our server was smart, funny/quirky, and very knowledgeable about the menu. He seem like he takes alot of pride in his work (hard to come by). \n\nNow keep in my mind that this is an introduction to Greek food for me so please bear with me as I attempt to name the dishes.\n\nOne of my co-worker is my partna' in crime, we vouch to always sit together and order different things so we both can share and taste everything. \n\nAs a starter we had the dolmathes and the fried garlic smelts.  I had Dolmas before so I knew what to expect when the little dish came. It was the best one by far.. really soft and the rice filling was very flavorful. The fried smelts was awesome.. AWWWee freakin' some.. They were so good.. I felt bad because I almost (not almost I did) finish all of them. It taste like garlic fries but better..these were little fried fishes. I also nabbed some grilled octopus and beet salad from the other people in our party. Those were good too.. but not Awwe..freakin' some like the smelts! \n\nFor the entree I had the lamb chops. It was cooked perfectly, just the way I like them; medium rare. It came with a few wedges of fried potatoes. It was very good and very filling. The partna' had the whole fish of the day. It was a very fresh and flaky sole with a side of greens. Really tasty and healthy, a good choice for those of you who are counting..whatever it may be, carbs, calories, sodium, pennies.   \n\nFor dessert we had the Baklavah, a custard filled filo dough dessert that I can't pronounce or name for the life of me, and the Dolce De Leche ice cream with a pine nut sauce. Everything was really good and very sweet, but maybe too sweet. Still they'll get five stars from me!\n\nOh the bathrooms are a trip, you have to take an elevator to go downstairs to it!

But by 5 , we were already close by and didn't know what else to do until then.  Luckily, the restaurant was already open for drinks so we didn't have to hover outside their door for half an hour.  Once inside, we were quickly brought to our table and our drink orders taken.  And though we were told that food orders will not be taken until 5:30, we ended up ordering and having food served to us before then!  Such a happy surprise!!  \n\nWe ordered the lamb riblets, a dish that we had a few years back when we came here for the 1st time and I have dreamt of it since then.  Though I dreaded that it may not live up to the expectation I have for it this time around, I am happy to report that it was just as I had hoped it would be.  It was perfectly tender, smoky and packed with flavor.  We also ordered the roasted potatoes (also good), watermelon salad (my partner loved this dish), baby octopus with tomato sauce (tasted very similar to what I can get from a can) and zucchini cakes (very disappointingly uninteresting  and bland to me, somewhat only salvaged by the yogurt dressing).  And, though we were quite full after all the appetizers, I am very susceptible to visual suggestions and looking at their roast special of the evening - the duck - turning around and around in their fireplace somehow allows my stomach to still have room for this entree.  And it was a big portion of half a duck with more roasted potatoes.  Ultimately, I can only fit 2 pieces into me.  But I am still happy to have ordered it and to have leftovers to enjoy!!  We finished off with 2 cups of Greek coffee (which has an unerring resemblance to Turkish coffee) served sweet.

I associate it with work because I work around the corner from this place and we frequent Kokkari because of its proximity.  But being close to work is not bad when you like the food.  \n\nHaving said that, though, I think it's a pleasant place to have a meal and I find most of their dishes relatively tastey.  The ambiance is also quite pleasant and the service is good.  \n\nHere are some dishes I recommend:  I'd order the grilled pita and spreads to start (very delicious!!!).  I'd also recommend any of the salads or the lamb souvlaki (moist and so good!).  I would not recommend the whole fish (they always say it's their \"special\" - the sole, or whatever).  Yes, the fish is good, but it's a little bland.  Kinda vanilla.  I'm sure it's pretty healthy but my taste buds were left pretty unimpressed!  Also, their lemonade and ice tea was watered down.  Stick with the water or a nice glass of wine!\n\nOver all, though, good food and good service = 4.5 stars!\n\nP.S.  If I remember correctly, the last time I stayed for dessert, they come out with the little bread crumb scooper and cleaned your table after your meal.  That's cool.  I like that.  That's service.", "author": "Quyen T."}

Of course I had the advantage of dining with an native Greek person, who ordered food for our entire party.  Those are the best dinner parties...where you don't have to think.  I was impressed by the elegant, yet cozy decor.  I was also impressed by the friendly and efficient service -- especially while accommodating a party of 9.  \n\nI've never been to a Greek restaurant before and I've only had a few Greek food items here and there during my adult life, so when I say the food at Kokkari was hit or miss..I specifically mean for my palate.  A few of the items were not my cup of tea, but my friends loved them and I could definitely see why.  While I think Kokkari did a good job with all the dishes that were served, I think some of them are just an acquired taste.  I enjoyed the flatbread pizza, the grilled meatballs, and the classic greek salad.  And for the dessert, you must try the  Galaktoboureko -- baked phyllo crust with a lemon custard filling.   Yum.   I did not enjoy the dolmas, the pan fried cheese, nor the grilled octopus.    \n\nI want to come back and try some of the dinner entres which sounded fabulous.

The restaurant has a very rustic yet majestic feel to it, lots of oak and vaulted ceilings. Neither is it too over-the-top in your face with people smashing plates over their heads, yelling \"Opa\"! (I KNOW, I was secretly disappointed too. :p)\n\nFor most of us it was our first time trying Greek food apart from the usual gyros with tzatziki sauce. There were a lot of \"that sounds delicious\" and \"whadda hell's that!?\" as we studied the menu, waiting for everyone to show up. The wait staff helped us to wade through the list of long named dishes to find something we liked. Some of their dishes may be a bit much for the squeamish, but our group was pretty adventurous so we had the lamb innards in a ruddy sauce, which were very soft and didn't smell offensive (as is usually the case with menudo). Tried the pork riblet appetizer but the sauce was practically the same. We also ordered the grilled calamari stuffed with feta cheese--although it sounds good, it was more of an arranged wedding rather than a marriage for love. \n\nOrdered the moussaka as my entr\u00e9e, packed with layers of ground lamb, potatoes, eggplant, which is delicious right up to the last bite, that is, if you make it that far. When they brought out the bowl, I looked at it, perplexed, wondering if the serving was large enough to make me full but no worries here (especially if you gorged on the appetizers like I did). Had a bite of the lamb shank which was so tender that the meat just fell off the bone.\n\nMy only regret is not budgeting some room in my stomach for dessert! No \"betsu bara\" here (Japanese for, \"having a second stomach reserved for dessert\"). \n\nThis place is a delight for those looking to take a break from the usual and is suitable for any special occasion.

The service is not bad here, but not great either. I definitely feel that for a fine dining establishment such as this that charges about 40 dollars per entree, you need to have staff that are just a bit more attentive.  \n\nThe food comes out pretty quickly here when you order and the portions are quite hearty so it might be a good idea to do several smaller plates and share an entree. For an appetizer we had the grilled octopus which I thought was very good, but a bit oily. We ordered the grilled lamb which were cooked to perfection and the special of the day which was a roasted pork. YUM! While the meats were indeed tasty, I feel like this restaurant has a tendency to douse everything in olive oil at the end which made it all kind of greasy. It was especially unnecessary with my dish since it had such a high fat content anyway. It wasn't bad, it just could have been better without. We had a bottle of Syrah to pair with the meal which worked out quite nicely. \n\nI did like the ambience of the restaurant, which isn't pretentious in any way. It was pretty romantic, although they really need to get rid of the awkward table in the corner that has a smaller table wedged in between the chairs.

I had the lamb chops which is one of their signature dishes, and I think they were the best lamb chops I've ever had: seared with lots of crunchy bits of tasty goodness on the outside and flavorful and juicy on the inside. With that said, I could have made a meal of the appetizers. We had the Saghanaki -- a pan fried cheese (who can NOT love FRIED CHEESE!!!!!)  -- and the Spanakotiropita --- a stuffed filo pie. Both were excellent. The only thing that could have made the meal any better would have been if Kokkari were an outdoor traverna overlooking the Aegean. \n\nThe restaurant is beautifully appointed in sort of a rustic-chic look. I felt slightly underdressed in a blazer and nice slacks --- most of the patrons were dressed to the nines, so you might want to rethink the jeans and flip-flops. Valet parking is available. Noise level is high, although the acoustics at our table were such that conversation was not a problem. Tables are packed in quite tightly; it's not the place for a quiet, intimate, romantic dinner in a secluded booth --- but then, it's a Greek place; you expect it to be a little on the raucous side. \n\nDrinks are as expensive as entrees at lesser places.

I expected a lot from this Greek restaurant being of Greek origin myself. Service was great, most plates were tasty but be prepared to pay a lot for very small portions. overall a good experience... Except for MY dish... the Moussaka... this was the worst worst moussaka I have ever had anywhere in my whole life and it was lacking so many of the key ingredients that I couldn't even call it a Moussaka. It was a bowl of oversalted dry dry ground lamb... I had took hard to find half a slice of eggplant or even potato, not to mention the bechamel sauce or spices. I couldn't finish the dish even though I was hungry, for everything else, I recommend the place.", "author": "Alexandre K."}

If you don't mind that there is feta cheese in almost every dish, this place is amazing. \n\nThe best pita bread I've ever had. None of that cardboard tasting stuff you get at the store, this is thick, bread-like, and flavorful pita...a little rosemary in it I think? \n\nI had their \"monday\" special which is basically a Greek Cioppino - saffron seafood stew. Awesome. I was practically licking the bowl. Only thing I didn't like is that  the shrimp was not peeled...not my preference when I am on a business lunch. My dining companion had the tuna, layered over grilled asparagus with artichoke and olive tapenade. Deeeelish.\n\nThey have an extensive wine list which I look forward to trying with dinner.

What I've noticed with the food is that the small plates are almost all good, entrees are inconsistent, and dessert is excellent.  The service is kind of a mixed bag too.\n\nFor starters, the greek salad, zucchini cakes, and dolmathes are all very tasty.  The kalamari is good too, if you like non-fried calamari.\n\nLast night the daily rotisserie was Napa Valley lamb.  It was ok, really nothing special, although the potatoes that came with it were delicious.  I think that their regular lamb shank is better, as is their ribeye.  I've had a whole fish here before and also remember that not being very good.  Hence the inconsistency in the entrees.\n\nDesserts are money.  Last night I had the galaktoboureko, which is awesome.  That greek coffee they serve up is wonderful as well, you have to try it if you like coffee.\n\nAs for service, I thought it was ok.  I felt like our water glasses weren't refilled often enough.  Also, while everyone was nice, there seems to be a certain smugness pervading the staff.  It's as though they make an effort to be cognizant of Kokkari's status as one of the top 10 most booked places on OpenTable.  I think that's why I rounded the 3.5 down instead of up.\n\nIf ambiance is important to you, then I'd say this is a 4-star place, because I think the decor is very nice and that the restaurant is just very comfortable and inviting.", "author": "Joseph N."}

So I'll write about eating a good meal.\n\nThree of us shared the \"pita with choices of three dips\" appatizer.  Sort of dangerous because you tend to load up a little too much before the main course.  The dips had really difficult names to pronounce, much less remember, but the best was a spicy feta concoction, while another creamy one with cod in it (i think) was not my thing.  The eggplanty one was good too.\n\nI had the moussaka for the main course, great, very filling.  The others had tuna and lamb souvlaki, which both looked good.  I finished with the special coffee that is prepared in hot sand.  I didnt (and don't) quite understand, even after it was explained to me, but I was assured I would not be biting down into a sandy cup of grit when drinking it.  In any event, it was good; nothing like the coffee I regularly drink.  Probably not worth the five bucks (to me), but when do I get a chance to drink hot-sand-brewed beverages (I ask rhetorically).  Not often (I answer, thus negating the rhetorical quality of the previous sentence.)\n\nOkay, its clear I need to go find a place to take a snooze.\n\nP.S. our waitperson was excellent, friendly, knowledgable; the room is very comfortable, not overly noisy (maybe because we were in a booth toward the back).", "author": "Padraig M."}

Pretty much everything was extremely good.  We started with the Grilled Octopus per some recommendations I saw on other reviews, and wow, did they deliver!  The most delicious, tender and smoky octopus ill probably ever have.  I would say that it was my absolute favorite part and that anyone going there MUST get it.  \n\nWe also had an heirloom tomato, caper and feta salad.  The feta was top notch...so buttery and creamy yet firm...yum.  (side note...very excited tomatoes are back in season!)\n\nI had the lamb rotisserie, which was good.  Tender, garlicky and flavorful, but not every slice was as tender.  I would probably have gotten the fish special in hindsight.  \n\nMy boyfriend got the Lamb Chops, which was definitely the winning choice.  Perfectly cooked inside and charred on the outside.  \n\nThere was a great wine selection and our waiter's pairing recommendations were spot on.  Where he really earned his points was when he brought out a free dessert with a candle and \"Happy 27th Birthday Austin\" written in chocolate on the plate.  Score!\n\nThe atmosphere was very nice, including the extremely well done and tasteful decor, however it was slightly loud (although likely due to the fact that there was a table of 30 suits right next to us).  \n\nTeh check came out to $150 + tip for 2 apps, 4 glasses of wine and 2 entrees, but ive done worse damage.

The decor is very nice and gives you a warm homey feeling.  It's hard getting a reservation here and even booking a week in advance we got a 8:30 reservation. The restaurant is large and has 3 sections.  There is a large wood burning open oven that they use to grill the fish.  As you walk through the restaurant, every waiter or waitress you pass by all greet you and say welcome.  This is a small special touch that many people appreciate.  A perk about getting seated in the back of the restaurant is that you get to walk by alot of tables and see what people are eating. Chinese people love to stare and see what other people are eating for some reason.\n\nThe waiter was extremely friendly and very helpful.  He took about 10 mins explaining all the various dishes on the menu and how you could have them prepared. For appetizers he suggested all the items we already were thinking about ordering.  We had the:\n\nKolokithokeftethes - which are crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber and mint-yogurt dressing,  \nSpanakotiropita - which are filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill, Aginares Souvlaki - grilled artichokes & eggplant skewers with Greek yogurt \nSoutzoukakia - grilled meatballs with tomato & green olive compote \n\nWe all agreed that the Spanakotiropita were the best out of all 4.  The crispy zucchini cakes and grilled artichokes & eggplants were really good as well.  The meatballs were a bit salty.\n\nFor the entrees we ordered:\n\nThe sea bass,\nKokinisto me Manestra - aromatic braised lamb shank with orzo & myzithra, \nMosharisia Brizola - charcoal-grilled, dry-aged rib eye with braised greens & Kokkari potatoes \n\nThe fish was cooked in the wood burning oven and had a good smokey taste, flavorful and moist.  It was accompanied with vegetables that were also good.  The meat literally fell off the bone on the braised lamb shank.  It was flavorful and very tender. But my favorite of all is the rib eye.  We had it cooked between rare and medium rare which at all good steak houses know it as rare plus.  I'm always skeptical about ordering a steak at a non-steakhouse, but we decided to give it a try.  Boy are we glad we ordered it.  The meat was cooked exactly to our liking, red center and the steak was very flavorful, had a hit of lemon and was very tender. I'm a steak Nazi and have done extensive personal studies in meat so for me to say a steak is good is rare.\n\nFor dessert we had the Galaktoboureko, which is semolina custard in filo with apricot spoon sweet & pistachio ice cream.  It was very good! We also tried the Greek coffee which I didn't think was very good. \n\nOverall it was a great dining experience and the prices aren't that bad. I suggest if you eat in a group, order a bunch of appetizers and share the entrees family style.  This way you'll get to try alittle of everything and the portions are large. Great place for a date or dinner with friends.\n\nWe only tried this place because so many people have been raving about it.

This appetizer is WAY too big in terms of portion, so by the time I got to the 10th smelt... I was all smelted out.  The potato garlic cream they have as dip for this was divine... again, for the first 10 mins. \n\nThe grilled octopus was done pretty well.  It was not overcooked so the meat was still tender.  it was drizzlled with good olive oil, so you can taste the grassiness of the oil.  \n\nWe then shared a chicken kabob dish... great flavors, but the chicked was overcooked to the point of dry... which required liberal application of the mint yogurt sauce. \n\nso...

From hostess, waiter, and busboys, the service was spot on. We made reservations for a Thursday night at 8:00 p.m. and glad we did because there were about 20 people waiting for tables. It has an upscale atmosphere but it not stuffy. We were seated at an intimate booth between the front and back rooms, we could hear the buzz of the place but still hear each other speak. \n\nThey bill themselves as \"Contemporary Hellenic Cuisine\" and I have to admit that I was not exactly certain what to expect. They did not have the typical Greek menu that I am accustomed to but it's a very interesting menu and I have to say that I finished one martini while trying to decide what to order--I wanted everything. \n\nFor my life, I cannot remember the names of the dishes we ordered but, for starters ordered: Crispy Zucchini Cakes with Cucumber & Mint-Yogurt Dressing; Grilled Calamari stuffed with Feta, Fennel & Orange with Black Olives; Grilled Meatballs with Spiced Tomato Sauce & Greek Yogurt. All were really, really good but the Zucchini Cakes stood out--I could have had those alone as my entree. \n\nMy dining companions had the Lemon-Oregano Chicken with Fasolakya (my friend mentioned that he does not like dealing with chicken bones and the waiter offered to de-bone the chicken); Dry-Aged Rib-Eye; and I had their Braised Lamb Shank with Orzo and Myzithra Cheese. All around, we thoroughly enjoyed our dishes. The chicken was juicy and flavorful; the rib-eye was nicely done, tender and well trimmed; and, my lamb shank was just perfect, it was so nicely prepared and cooked that I didn't really need a knife and the portion was actually just slightly more than I could finish and the Orzo was perfect too. \n\nI will definitely be back.", "author": "Adam Z."}

I would have to agree, although I'm not quite the aficionado that he is on the subject. We started with the Zucchini Cakes with cucumber & mint yogurt dressing (my favorite part of the meal) and the Grilled Calamari. For our entr\u00e9es we had the Moussaka (very rich, I recommend splitting) and the Duck Special cooked in Ouzo. Doesn't taste like black licorice, just has an excellent flavor! Finishing with something sweet, we shared the Galaktoboureko (or as my husband's friend likes to call it \"galactic booty call\"). It was delicious. Decor and Service are on point as well.

It was so filling though that I didn't have room for dessert.\n\njuly 2007 update:\n\ncame back to kokkari for a dinner party. i picked it but it didn't quite occur to me that not everyone might not be into lamb, but luckily our entire table was! yay!\n\nwe started off with some spanakotiropita (filo pies of spinach, feta, leeks & dill) and those were fab. then each of us picked out an additional mezethes (greek small plates): kolokithokeftethes (crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing), dolmathes (grape leaves stuffed with rice, currants & pine nuts), and soutzoukakia (grilled meatballs with tomato & green olive compote). and this was all before we even looked at the main course portion of the menu.\n\nwe also opened a bottle of a red and a white. i kinda remember what the red was, but i didn't taste it so i don't have much to say about it. but i ordered the white for the table and it was surprising. it was a '94 gewurtz from the cellar. and at cellar temperature, it was crazy strong. deep marigold color and the bouquet reminded me of a sweet brandy or something. weird that they didn't say it was probably a little intense for a dinner wine, but it still worked.\n\nthen our server went into his spiel about the menu and we all decided on either the lamb chops or the lamb shank. i went with the lamb shank with myzithra, but instead of the orzo that came with it, i requested kokkari potatoes instead. the meat literally fell off the bone and melted in my mouth. the potatoes were good but a bit much as i was pretty stuffed at that point.\n\nwe followed that with some dessert for everyone. i was originally going to go with the walnut & honey baklava, but our server described the day's special and i went for that instead. it was a trio of stone fruit sorbets (very popular these days): nectarine, either apricot or peach, and plum. two were excellent and one wasn't so excellent. couldn't actually tell which was which as my tongue was quite fatigued at that point.", "author": "spiff e."}

It worked out to our advantage, as we ended up wanting to just order a plethora of apps and share anyway (and the service at the bar was impeccable).\n\nWe got:\n- Dolmathes (grape leaves)\n- Spanakotiropita (spinach pie)\n- Zucchini cakes\n- Roasted winter squash\n- Grilled meatballs\n- Roasted brussel sprouts w/ bacon & lemon\n\nEach dish was perfect, and accounting for the complimentary fresh bread + dipping oil and olives to start,  we left at that perfect level of fullness and satisfaction.\n\nThe ambience here is delightful, with huge floral displays, little touches like a bowl of pinecones and pomegranates, and decadent - like the large open fireplace and island for slicing freshly baked breads.

I came with high expectations which were exceeded. Food, ambiance and service were top notch. It's one of those places where choosing what to order is agonizing because everything looks so good. A stolen glance at the tables next to us left my mouth watering. \"I want everything\" is what I told the waiter. He smiled knowingly and offered some helpful suggestions. I encourage you to choose wisely... despite any self-assurances that you'll \"have to return and try these other dishes next time\", whatever you end up ordering will likely be so good you'll be compelled to order the same in future visits. I finally went with the with the Gigantes, Avgolemono soup, and Arnisia Paidakia, with a glass of Pinot Noir. I'm not usually a dessert guy, but the Sokolatina looked irresistible, and it was a superb end to a memorable meal.

We tried both and were happy that we did. I ordered the T-bone pork. Half of it was a bit dry and the other half (the fatty half) was great! Also the vegetables that came with the dish were yummy! I heard that the rib-eye here was very good here, but I didn't try it. Maybe next time.\n\nOK, so this is a continuation of my bathroom adventures. Why must the road to the bathrooms in these restaurants be so complicated?\n\nAnyways, you go down the hall all the way at the end of the restaurant, expecting to find a bathroom, but instead, you find an elevator. I would have turned around and walked back to look for the bathroom else where, but luckily someone told me the bathroom was downstairs. So after taking the elevator down one floor and some nice / awkward conversation, you turn left for the women's bathroom and right for the men's bathroom.\n\nI have to say, the bathrooms are swanky.

The ambiance was great, and I heard in the summer time they open all the big wooden windows and that's even better.  \n\nWhen we were waiting for our table, we were all gazing at the \"bread and olives table\" by the fireplace.  The presentation of the whole place was at once classy, stylist yet homey.   Their mojito's were awesome too, and I'd actually say it was worth the $10 at the bar.\n\nThey have plenty of appetizers, all of which sounded heavenly.  Our table tried the house smoked salmon, and the blood orange salad with rose water.  For about $8 a plate, they were a great treat and wonderful way to start the evening.  Everybody pretty much ordered a big meat entree, the lamp chops and the rib eye were both the best we have respectively ever had.  The desserts were amazing as well, and you gotta try their Greek coffee that is heated in a hot sand pit.    \n\nI very rarely go out of a restaurant that happy, usually there is one or two small things that I have reservations about.

The sourdough and focaccia bread was great for the dipping sauce. \n\nFor our entrees, she had the rib-eye steak, I had the rotisserie lamb.\nTo be 100% honest, I thought the lamb lacked taste, but that might be because it wasn't really seasoned. It was simply a lamb meat rotisserie. It was good, but not stellar. My girlfriend's rib-eye was excellent, and I was slightly jealous :) \n\nWe had a greek wine with the meal that was light and refreshing, almost too much so. I am inexperienced with Greek wine but our server explained that it was light, so I don't blame them. It was nice experience. \n\nFor dessert we managed to share the custards with pistachio ice cream and quince. I hadn't had quince in ages, and it was really really good (as was the rest of it). I mentioned it was her birthday and they put a candle on it for us, and wrote happy birthday in chocolate. A really nice touch. I also had a greek coffee, which is similar to Turkish coffee. (I turned the cup over to see if I could read my fortune, but I don't know how, really). \n\nUnfortunately, I can't remember the server's name, but she was a tall woman with curly hair. Very pretty, warm, and extremely gracious. She really helped us have a wonderful time. \n\nEverything with a generous tip came too about 200 dollars, which was well worth it for me.

The restaurant was big and busy with a casual bistro feeling.  It was a very warm night in SF, and it was HOT in the restaurant.  Nonetheless, the food was great and the service was professional and friendly.\n\nFor starters, we had zucchini cakes, grilled octopus, the spreads, and the grilled pork belly.  All four were pretty good yet the pork belly was the winner.  As a Chinese known for eating just about everything, I was pleasantly surprised to see three Americans enjoying the pork belly-- skin and all.  It was juicy and flavorful, and the texture from the grilled skin, the melted fat, and the slightly crunchy cartilage was truly amazing.\n\nFor entr\u00e9e, I had the whole bronzino, which was sweet, juicy and delicious.  My husband had the ever-famous Moussaka, which was extremely rich and flavorful. (Warning: Don't let the bowl fool you.  The serving may look small; it was-- as it should be-- very filling.)  Our friends had the braised lamb shank and the grilled lamb chops.  I was so busy with my fish that I stopped chatting for awhile.  Looking through the half-empty wine glass (our friends brought an excellent bottle of Shiraz), I vaguely remember seeing meat falling off the shank bone.  Judging by their smile-- and the couple of minute silence after the entr\u00e9es were served-- they were happy with their dishes as well. \n\nFor dessert, they ordered a baklava and a flourless dark chocolate cake.  I had a bite of both.  They were good: moist and not overly sweet.  However, I was too full to enjoy dessert; a shot of grappa was the perfect ending for my dinner.", "author": "S M."}

Nice architecture, dimmed light, fireplace with rotisserie, furniture, etc.  The service was good.  I'm picky about always having my water glass full, and they always filled it up (except once, but the glass was still 1/4 full).  And I'm always impressed when our napkins are folded as you come back to your seat if you get up.  Capacity  was about 1/2 full when we arrived Saturday evening at 5:45.  But quickly filled up.  The place is pretty big, take a walk to the back.  You can see the chefs cooking everything.\n\nWe started off with the calamari.  I had though it was deep friend calamari, so beware if you folks don't like your calamari non breaded.  Regardless, it was good.  The stuffing inside the squid was delicious.  We dipped our bread in it and wish we had more.  I ordered the rack of lamb.  I love lamb.  It was really good, but I've had lamb just as good for 1/2 the price.  My wife ordered the rotisserie, it was cuts of pork.  It was good, but not great.  Something about rotisserie always makes us feel like it's gonna taste fantastic.  Otherwise, I'd give the review 5 stars.\n\nA nice touch was at dessert.  We ordered the ice cream.  And they wrote Happy Anniversary on the plate in chocolate.  And put a candle on the top.  We would come back again definitely.", "author": "James D."}

Boy were those reviews right on the money.  Let me preface everything by saying I'm Greek, so I can be a staunch critic of Greek restaurants in the States that serve mediocre food in tacky, brightly lit blue and white surroundings.  This place is nothing like that.  It is absolutely elegant and captures the true charm and coziness of the Greek countryside.  The food was delicious and very authentic with a few haute cuisine twists by the chef.  Presentation and service were impeccable with very friendly and personable staff.  The prices were very reasonable considering the value of the overall experience.  I very much look forward to the next opportunity to visit this place.  The only weird part about the restaurant is that you have to take an elevator down to a dungeon to get to the restroom.", "author": "Hugo B."}

I'm traveling for work, and consequently ate alone, so I sat at the bar. The bar tender was well attendant, very helpful, and over all a fun guy. He wanted me to enjoy my experience.\n\nI started with the meatball appetizer. One would think that meatballs in a tomato based sauce would have the same flavor as it always has had at every neighborhood italian joint ever. This had a completely different flavor (albeit a more greek one). Well, rather, it had 3 different layers of flavor: the meat, the seasoning in the meat, and the sauce. Each went very well witht he others, with only the sauce standing out [slightly] morre than the others.\n\nFor my entree, I had the lamb shank on orzo. before cutting into it, I was ready to be disappointed, as it seemed like it was going to be all fat. The uppon cutting through the skin, I realized the jiggly appearance and texture was because all of the hughe hunks of meat had completely separated form the bone and were (to use a very cheesy verbage) encased int he skin in a sack of flavor. The depth of flavor here was amazing. The orzo and sauce were also equally breathe taking.\n\nAnd finally, i lvoed the ambiance. The high back chairs around intimate tables all witht he fireplace made the place seem modern, but also very homey.", "author": "Ryan W."}

We were sat next to a Russian couple, both of whom were very loud and the guy was wearing a shirt with a few too many buttons opened.  I think that sort of caused my girlfriend to lose her appetite.\n\nNow, onto the food.  The salad was very good and I especially loved it with the combination of feta and cracked pepper.  Also, the saganaki was a tasty appetizer.  I always order this when I go out for Greek food, and while this was good, it wasn't as good as I remember the one in Santorini.  On the other hand, I guess I'll have to keep in mind that in Santorini, I had a little too much time in the sunshine, combined with fast women and ouzo shots, so my judgment wasn't the greatest in that state.\n\nOnto the main entrees.  My girlfriend's ravioli with asparagus and feta was good and I liked how it wasn't smothered in cheese....helpful for those of us that are lactose intolerant.\n\nI ordered the moussaka.  It was good, but it was too rich and I could only finish about half of it, as I didn't want to get Montezuma's revenge and worship the porcelain god that evening.  \n\nOverall, it was an enjoyabl experience, with good food and atmosphere.

So this is a special occassion restaurant, unless you make over $130,000 I suppose.\n\nWe started with grilled octopus.  It was nothing special... just seemed like grilled octopus dipped in olive oil.\n\nPeople said that the lamb chops are excellent, and as one who loves lamb, I had to have it.  The lamb chops came as three chops.  The first one was just OK. I gave a bite to my girlfriend, who said it was great.  She doesn't like lamb because she doesn't like the taste - something about being too gamey.  The second chop was much better, in my opinion.  I gave a bite to my girlfriend, who said it tasted too much like lamb.  She doesn't like lamb, but appreciates the tenderness of the meat.  To her, well cooked lamb doesn't taste like lamb but is still oh-so-tender.  I like the taste, so the second chop was better.  The third chop was so-so.\n\nI appreciate expensive food and all, but I'm already very happy with a $20 meal.  This is because at that price, I can still pick up the bones and eat the meat like a barbarian.  I did that hereanyway, because I like lamb and the best meat is the bit stuck to the bone.  I also don't embarrass easily.\n\nIn all, it was a dining experience that one would expect for a $130 dinner for two.

Kokkari is larger than it looks from the outside. It's also a lot fancier than I had expected. I arrived for a lunch, when this place may be better suited for a nice dinner. Nevertheless, I was satisfied by my meal. \n\nMy lunchmate and I split 4 appetizers, ordered individual salads and split a dessert. We had the traditional greek grape leaves app, the phyllo dough with spinach and cheese app, the lamb riblets and the grilled octopus. The grape leaves (which I usually avoid) were quite good, while the octopus wasn't chewy, but broke apart just right in my mouth. I would avoid the salads upon my next visit, but the Yogurt sorbet with fruit granita was incredibly refreshing and satisfying.\n\nThe waiter was a little overly enthusiastic, but I will not criticize his passion since I'm the same way when it comes to good food. \n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience and a place I will be sure to visit again... probably at dinner next time.", "author": "eileen b."}

It's a $$$ - $$$$ restaurant, but worth it on occassion.  The pita with the different dips is a must.  Just the pita bread itself is extremely yummy.  All the different mezzes (appetizers) are really good.  Even the smelts (little fishies).  It sounds disgusting, but they are actually quite tasty.  As for entrees, they are all really tasty.  There isn't anything that has stood out to me.  All the fish is very fresh. For dessert, I'm not a huge greek dessert fan, but their assortment of cookies is good.  I don't drink coffee either, but everyone says the coffee is something you should try.  The chrysanthemum mint tea is a great cap to a pretty heavy meal.  \n\nThe service is wonderful and the ambience is very different.  It's a little dark inside and can be pretty noisy, but you definitely feel the \"mediterranean-ness\".\n\nGreat place to celebrate a special occassion and one of the top restaurants in SF.", "author": "Michelle H."}

He didn't have time to answer our questions about the menu and kept looking away while he was talking to us. The appetizers came out too quickly -- we had three things on our small table at the same time which made it hard to share and maneuver. The server took my plate away while I was still in the middle of eating our apps, but he left my husband's plate. When I asked to have my plate back, he said he was switching it out to get a cleaner one, but why wouldn't he have taken my husband's equally dirty plate then? We also asked to have some of our leftovers packed up for us to take home, and we never got them back. \n\nNow that we have young kids my husband and I aren't able to go out as much as we used to.

There were others that were ok, like the calamari or octopus, but i am not too into my seafood tasting of the clay oven.  Anyway, I was actually stuffed after trying one of everything, but I managed to make more room because it was free...\n\nI actually had time to relax between apps and ordering, so I took the chance to bathe in the beauty of this place.  It is very warm; reminiscent of an indian clay oven joint; tapestries on the wall; windows opening out onto the street and large wooden family-sized tables.  Apparently, this is one of the SF 100 restaraunts, which does not suprise me, since getting to the bathroom involves taking a trip on the elevator, and then passing the wine safe and the small VIP room by the bathroom.\n\nSpeaking of--these bathrooms get 5 stars, as well.  I have always taken to heart the saying that the kitchen is only as clean as the bathroom...\n\nI ordered the CRISPY DUCK CONFIT--which was exactly the way it should be cooked.  The greens were ok--but more for appearance.  Nonetheless, it was amazing.  My colleagues ordered the Grilled Lamb Chops and the Ahi, which were also perfection.\n\nFor dessert I had the Stone-ground GREEK COFFEE, which is heated over hot sand.  The sand bits sink to the bottom, so you are advised not to stir.

Maybe it was the hype, but my experience didn't quite live up to expectations.\n\nFirst, the good:\n-The food: My boyfriend's rib-eye was great. He said it was probably one of the best steaks he's ever had. My lamb chops were really tasty as well. The potatoes could have been crispier, but so it goes. The octopus appetizer was good (my boyfriend was neutral about them), and the meatballs were delicious (but, really, I don't think I can remember meeting a meatball I didn't like). Dessert was passable, but not spectacular.\n\nNow, the bad:\n-Service: The restaurant was pretty understaffed. Our server was completely preoccupied with the large table of 8 behind us. I'm sure they were ordering a ton of wine, but really, when I'm paying that much money to eat at your restaurant, you should at least fake it. The couple next to us got the shaft as well, so I don't think it was personal. Just totally annoying. After our plates were cleared, it took the waiter over 15 minutes to bring a dessert menu. Hmph. He was also super-smug and pretentious. \n\n-Ambiance: We were seated next to a high-traffic aisle, and as a result, patrons walking by almost seemed to keep bumping into us. The tables were too close together as well, and the people sitting behind me felt it necessary to grab/touch my chair to steady themselves as they went to the restroom. Which happened at least 7 times. I did not appreciate it. \n\nIn addition, this place was LOUD. Though I suppose that was all the better for my boyfriend and I to talk about our waiter practically in front of his face without him realizing it. \n\nAlso, there was a large group of people seated at a table across the room, who thought it would be fun to toast themselves loudly every few moments as they got completely wasted. The decor may have been classy, but I wouldn't say this place attracts the classiest of patrons. \n\nBottom line: the food is good, but there are so many better places to eat at in the city.", "author": "Nora G."}

All were really good.\n\nThe Octopus and Prawns were my two favorite  appetizers. The Octopus was cooked really well I thought it was going to be really chewy but it was actually tender and easy to chew. The lemon, olive oil and oregano added a delicious citrus flavor to the Octopus.\n\nThe prawns were fantastic. They came in a tomato broth with feta cheese melted on top. The cheese was a very nice contrast to the flavor of the shrimp and broth and definitely made this dish more memorable\n\nAt one point my Boss' boss said that we couldn't leave until all the appetizers were gone and since it was my anniversary I would have to be the one to eat what was left. I just smiled and grabbed my fork. I was ready to take that challenge. \n\nAs an entree I had the Ahi Tuna steak. It was delicious, nicely seared with a bean salad. It was well portioned and the salad and pickled onions complimented it nicely.\n\nThe wait staff was nice and very attentive.

Or twice...er maybe.  \n\nSo my friend made reservations, and got me all hyped up to join her...but this match wasn't truly meant to be in the first place.  1) I just don't like lamb, 2) I'm not a big sodium lover, and 3) I'm deathly allergic to walnuts.\n\nI enjoyed the zucchini cake appetizer, and the galaktoboureko dessert (filo rolls with custard, creme fraiche ice cream, and some of the most delicious figs I have ever had in my life, and NO walnuts, YAY).  I ordered the Galeos (halibut) because I just didn't feel like having meat or chicken tonight.  And it was OK, healthy-looking food, tender...sitting on a bed of veggies I could have put together myself, but after a couple bites I felt like it was a little too salty.  If I ever came back I would definitely skip the grilled octopus appetizer (kind of a funky, smoky after taste that you need to chase with some Roederer - we were kind of celebrating).  I would skip the lamb altogether, because I just don't like lamb.  And did I forget to mention I am REALLY not into LAMB?!\n\nOur server, Karen was pretty awesome.  I can't complain about the location or the ambiance of the restaurant...A LITTLE LOUD THOUGH.  Just a LITTLE cramped.  I was studying the dessert trying to figure out if I could even attempt to make it...but I came to the conclusion that I'd just have to come back for it.\n\nTonight I spent $75 to enjoy a traditional Greek dessert.

Being fans of quality over quantity, Kokkari was a hit with us. That said, you can certainly go the quality and quantity route, too. \n\nOn the advice of our attentive, though not overbearing, server we just did a variety of Mezethes (appetizers) and added a few salads. As others have written, the zucchini cakes were good and the accompanying non-traditional ztaziki even better. The grilled veggies were good, but the flavor of the poblano sauce didn't stand up to it's aroma. Braised lamb riblets were tasty, rich and fall-of-the-bone tender. Even my wife was surprised with the flavor of the fried smelt and the accompanying garlicy, citrusy hummus (though I enjoyed them more with the ztaziki). We both had the arugula salad; the acidity of the vinaigrette was wonderfully contrasted with sweetness of the honey wheat croutons. I would have loved to try the tureen of trotters and pig head, but have trouble justifying cold dinners. \n\nThough we didn't partake, the entrees looked on-par with the Mezethes and quite generous. The crowd was a mix of young and old, tourist and townie. Definitely a good place for a romantic, after-dark dinner or a group celebration.", "author": "Erick P."}

The only reservations we where able to get was for 9:30pm on a Thursday evening.  Which does say a lot about a restaurant.  We arrived almost 30min early and they host said they where waiting for us.  They walked us to our table which was near the kitchen.  Our waiter was cordial and after a little chit chat.  He suggested that he would bring out three starters of his choice for the table to start.  We where more then happy due to the fact that everything on the starter menu looks so good its hard to choose.  After having a few sips of wine the waiters came by and served us  Spanakotiropita ( which I had him repeat because it sounded so fun when he said it) Zucchini Cakes and Chanterelle Mushrooms with Feta Cheese.\n\nThe Spanakotiropita was flaky with warm spinach and feta in the inside.  The Zucchini cakes crispy outside and soft inside. They where topped with a yogurt sauce and pickled cucumber.  The yogurt sauce had a light goat cheese flavor which went well with the crunchy cucumber and crispy zucchini cakes.  The chanterelle mushrooms where lightly sauteed witch cubed baked feta cheese.  Very light and earthy in flavor.  For the main dish I had the Goat Stew.  The dish comes in a clay pot casserole which is extremely hot.  I had to wait a while before I could dig in.  Instead I grabbed a piece of bread and dipped into the sauce while I waited for the dish too cool. Damn was that good!  You can taste the cinnamon, salty feta, and all the Mediterranean flavors. The dish is comprised of shredded tender goat meat, orzo pasta, tomato, feta cheese, and artichoke hearts.  I wish this dish came with a spritz of lemon.  It would of brought out more of the flavors and spices.  The next day leftovers I did just that and it tasted much better.  My boyfriend had the special which was a trio of pork cooked 72hrs in a pit.  It was shoulder, butt, and bacon with Kokkari potatoes(cooked in the pork drippings) and a half lemon wedge.  I also had this dish for lunch the next day a long side some corn tortillas.  The tender pork and the flavorful drippings with a spritz of lemon was just one great dish.  We finished off the meal with dessert Galaktoboureko and some  Greek coffee Glyko.  The coffee was good not to sweet and did not leave me wired or with a stomach ache.

The lady who served us know her wine very well despite her self proclaim minimal knowledge in the menu, we were totally 'woah' over by the details.\n\nMy favourite mezethe is the grilled octopus!  It is grilled to perfection not too chewy and melts in your mouth.  A defnite must eat! \n\nI cannot remember the main dish I had, it was a 'catch of the day' fish air flown from Greece.  It was super delicious and there were 2 styles of cooking it, fried in a batter or grilled.  The whole fish is served and full of bones, the best way and fastest way to eat it is fried.  \n\nMy partner had the lamb chops and it was super delicious too!  He was done so quickly with his main dish!  \n\nWe had the Yiaourti Granita and the Baklava for dessert.  I love the Granita!!!!!  So refreshing, light and not too sweet!  The Baklava was light and fluffy! \n\nKokkari is on my 'to go' list for special occassion!", "author": "Xiuf L."}

It was delicious back then and I went back last week for the first time in 5, 6 years and they didn't miss a beat. Everything I had with my party of 10 was superb.\n\nSaghanaki, fried cheese, is the closest to crispy, smoky, salty goodness of a well-done bacon without ever touching meat - a real crowd pleaser.\n\nThe salad of glistening slabs of persimmon with cubes of Feta and olives is a mouth-watering fare you don't ever want to end.\n\nGrilled Chilean Sea Bass (whole) came on a family size serving platter, with saffron potatoes and grilled chanterelles and olives. Even though we all ate a lot, none of us entered a food coma in the end. This is a clear indication that the food pairings were highly complimentary as well as FRESH.\n\nWe tried all the desserts, but my favorite by far, at the end of a LARGE dinner, was the yogurt sorbet with pomegranate granita and mint syrup. So beautiful and refreshing. Their ice creams/sorbets are all homemade and exquisite.\n\nWaitstaff was knowledgeable and courteous.

Fantastic flourless chocolate cake with whipped cream, the roomie had something that he gobbled up within minutes.  Very good.\n\nNoise Level: 3 stars.

While it is tasty, I found it to have too much cinnamon, plus, I realized how easy (and cheap) it is to make my own moussaka at home, which I can season to my liking. One of the few items on the menu that I don't think worth the price.

Speaking of which, the eggplant dip was incredible -- not smooth like baba ganooj, but chunky and slightly sweet and more like a relish. Also enjoyed the grilled octopus, blood orange salad, lamb riblets, lamb souvlaki main dish, and Greek cookies for dessert.\n\nThe staff were charming and friendly, the atmosphere was warm and festive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-13", "description": "I went to Kokkari several years ago, before I had ever gone to Greece. I thought the food was fantastic. Since that time, I found a Greek boyfriend and have been to Greece several times. Upon returning to Kokkari, I'll say that the decor is very nice and the waitstaff is attentive, but the food is not up to the standard of being traditionally Greek, or even \"upscale Greek\".\n\nWe were not impressed with the Greek salad. We forgive this because tomatoes are out of season. However, the octopus was blanched and then grilled for five minutes. The best way to get flavor out of octopus is to grill (essentially smoke it) for a long time. The meat is then tender and delicious, Kokkari missed on bringing out the flavor and texture in the octopus. We found it rubbery and flavorless. Zucchini keftedes (patties) were tasty; however the Gigantes (large beans) were also lacking in flavor. In each case, these appetizers missed the mark compared to places in Greece and in the US, that are more authentic in bringing out the flavor. Dishes were swept away before there was an opportunity to enjoy the left over sauce and olive oil with bread (a big Greek no-no because that is the best part). Our entree was the evening's roasted special pork. It was ok, not bad, but did not knock our socks off. The best part of the meal was the rice pudding dessert which was very tasty.  Greek coffee was also traditionally made and very good.\n\nAll-in-all, Kokkari is good, but don't bring a Greek person here because they will be very perplexed about why it has a high rating.", "author": "Nancy M."}

At the server's request I ordered the rotisserie of the day which happened to be duck.  Unfortunately I was totally let down.  The flavor was hit and miss (sometimes I could taste all of the spices and herbs and at was pretty good, others...not so much).  To top it off it was really umm...dry?

I always hesitate because it inevitably seems that everyone tells us how INCREDIBLE a restaurant is and we go, spend copious amounts of money and then are sorely disappointed.  \n\nYou will not be disappointed!  From the extremely attentive wait staff (you MUST ask to be seated in Abel's section), the comfortable atmosphere and the amazing food, I don't really see how it could be much better. \n\nWe had the saghanaki (pan fried cheese with a splash of lemon) and the homemade pita/dip platter to start and could have easily stopped there.  Being the gluttons we are, we forged ahead to the spit-fired lamb with Yukon potatoes.  I've never had lamb cooked like this before, but once again, was very pleased.  Dessert was a no-brainer... I asked Abel what he suggested and we, because we are obviously brilliant, went with his favorites; Galaktoboureko (custard wrapped in flaky, buttery filo dough topped with pistachio ice cream) and Yiaourti me Meli (the homemade yogurt drizzled with honey and loaded with nuts and dates).  We topped it off with the deliciously uncommon Greek coffee.  Perfection.\n\nI asked to speak to the manager before we left and told him how much we enjoyed everything.  He was professional and warm.  As we were leaving, he called my husband by name and told him that he hoped to see us soon.  \n\nThey do have valet parking for $8, which is pretty reasonable.  The dinner ended up being $118 (no alcohol!) without the tip, so if you're wanting lamb, be prepared to pay for it, but I assure you...it was the best $118 + tip I've spent in the city for dinner. \n\nMr. AnnaBear grew up in Detroit and has been lucky enough to experience some great Greek fare.  He ranks Kokkari #1 overall.  He's had better food, but never with such great service and surroundings.", "author": "Anna N."}

Apart from the great atmosphere, one thing that truly left a lasting impression on me was their friendly, and very knowledgeable staff.  \n\nThe place is classy with high ceilings, beautiful decor, and comfortable seating.  There is a huge fire place in the middle where they roast their meats.  Singles, couples, and smaller parties can sit at the front dining area, the bar,  and along the walls leading to the back where larger parties are seated.  There are private dining rooms available downstairs.  The restrooms are also downstairs.  \n\nWe ordered (based on our server's recommendations):\nGarides Yuvetsi, wood oven roasted prawns with tomato & feta cheese - $12.75\nGhurunaki Stin Souvla (Souvla Tis Emeras - today's rotisserie) grilled pork, beans - $29.50\nArnisia Paidakia, grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & Kokkari potatoes - $29.50\nYiaourti me Meli, Greek yogurt with spiced walnuts & dates drizzled with Greek Attiki honey - $8.00\n\nThe prawns were perfectly cooked, and the tomato & feta cheese sauce was worth noting, however this dish didn't make me say; \"WOW! Those are some good prawns!\"  The pork was really delicious.  It was still juicy after 20 mins.  Much better than I expected.  I may order this next time if it is available.  My lamb chops were perfect.  Good size, well seasoned, juicy and tender.  mmmmm!  The stinkin desert pretty much ruined our dinner.  Greek yogurt with spiced walnuts & dates drizzled with Greek Attiki honey.  When they say \"drizzled\" I think they meant \"liberally drizzled\" as it was definitely on the sweet side.  I think the yogurt and honey combo slightly upset my tummy. :(  Tummy hurt, no good.\n\nOur server was nice.  However it took a while for our main dishes to arrive.

Warm, comfortable with a rustic charm that is in no way kitschy.  It feels like someplace you can relax and go again and again.\n\nThe Service - kind, friendly, personable and also very warm.

Overall fabulous place in terms of energy, ambiance and staff. Light and airy, yet really knowledgeable and serious on that note. \nThe only weird part was the fact that you huddle into a small hallway to then take an elevator to get to the bathroom downstairs....not a huge deal.\nAnyway, went with three friends and stuck with the appies. Here is what we shared and what I thought of it:\nFasolakya Tiganita (fried beans and cheese) - good but won't get again. Not anything special.\n\nKolokithokeftethes (cripsy zucchini cakes) - FABULOUS! loved these. Good size, tender and tasty, cooked perfect.\n\nBamies Briam (okra braised with tomato and onion) - loved this too. \nOkra was great -not soggy or gross, and just the right seasoning.\n\nKalamari (calamari grilled and stuff with feta and kalamata) - no go. Texture was wrong for me. they did a good job, just not my personal fave.\n\nSampler platter with: Melitzanosalata (feta),  Taramosalata (salmon roe) and Tirosalata (eggplant) - These three were amazing, but the salmon roe was my fave. Sounds odd, but it is nothing like you expect. Please try it. THe pita is so fresh and tasty and with these spreads it is to die for. The dolmas on the side were ok, but the big event are the spreads. \n\nDessert was the Galaktoboureko which is a filo with a semolina custard and then we had figs on the side with Greek coffee which is an interesting little thing. Different for American tastes, but good - strong, but good. The dessert was great too - really fresh and like all the other stuff, cooked to perfection.

The starters ranged from delicious (melitzanosalata, taramosalata, tzatziki sampler, feta and olives) to average (spanakotiropita) to not very good (dolmas).  My entree, the Ahi Tuna, was the biggest disappointment.  It was a flat slab of tuna that I am pretty sure I could easily duplicate from the frozen section at Trader Joe's.  My summer bean salad had maybe three summer beans, which were delicious, and the rest was a practically inedible (due to the stem to leaf ratio) plate of greens, with a small amount of pickled red onions.  When it came to dessert, I was again disappointed.  I am a huge fan of baklava, and although that is what they served me, I think they might have left the flavor in the kitchen, because it was downright bland.  \n\nThe environment was great, the decor tasteful, and our waitress adept, but the overall experience left me wanting more.", "author": "Rebecca M."}

Great food is great food, and Kokkari is solid.\n\nFirst, I love the level of quality in this food. It's easy to tell that the food you're eating did not come out of a can. When they make an artichoke dish, those artichokes are freshly peeled and expertly prepared. When they serve something with garbanzos in it, you can rest assured that they're going to be as clean and unmessed with as possible. \n\nThe second thing I love is the seating. In the long run, comfortable seating is just a good idea. It pays off because people feel more comfortable. They can loosen their ties and enjoy themselves without feeling pushed or rushed. \n\nMy only complaint is the price point. I don't see how why they can't shave a few bucks off here and there.

Whole fish roasted or traditionally grilled with spices and cretan olive oil and rib eye steak cooked to perfection served with kokkari potatoes.

The restaurant was a lot bigger than I expected it to be, but the design and decoration was very classy with great ambience.\n\nOur party was seated right away, and the food was brought in a very efficient manner. Our servers (three) were all extremely friendly and came checking at the right times to refill drinks and to see how we were enjoying our food. I definitely felt that we were being well-attended to.\n\nAs for the food itself, we had, as an appetizer, some sort of mushrooms (tasty), the spanakotiropita (cooked to perfection), and a bread-and-dip platter of favosalata, tirosalata, and tzatziki. Each of them were delicious in their own right, but I'd say the tzatziki was the best! I ordered the Kokinsto me Manestra (lamb shank) as an entree. It was savoury and rich, though I had eaten a bit too much of the appetizers to enjoy it as much as I could have. The meat was tender and fell right off of the bone. For dessert, we had Yiaourti Granita, pomengranate-flavoured, which was advertised as \"palate-cleansing\" by our main server; this proved to be the case as the flavours of the mint syrup, yogurt sorbet, and crushed pomengranate ice blended well.\n\nI would absolutely recommend Kokkari (I personally can't wait to try some of their other dishes), and I'll be excited to go again as soon as I have the chance.", "author": "Maggi L."}

They were in fact delicious and so tender. Each one was pretty small, but there were 6.\n\nFor the main course I got the 'whole fish'. I forget exactly what it was (something I hadn't heard of before) but it was white, thin, and flaky... and so tasty. I got it grilled and the spices they used on it were so good. Keep in mind 'whole fish' comes with the head and tail (and then the part you eat is in the middle). It did have a few bones in one area, but as long as you eat slowly and are careful, it's not a problem. I didn't think the 'braised greens' were anything special but oh well the fish wash! \n\nMy boyfriend got the lamb shank... I tasted it and thought it was pretty good. I can't say too much else but he seemed to enjoy it and finished it off. \n\nGood portions and value. My 5 stars are due to the awesome tastes that all the dishes had, just the right amount of sauce and spice.  I wish we had gotten another appetizer (or more) because so many sounded so good.

My whole fish (sole with braised greens) and my friend's chicken weren't at all memorable. The olives and the soft, soft pita bread with three delicious spreads were the best part of the meal. The feta-stuffed calamari was tasty, too. I could have happily shared a bunch of appetizers and then had a salad. If the menu has twice as many appetizers as entrees, perhaps that's a hint. \n\nBut the service is excellent, the wine list is extensive, and the atmosphere is warm and cozy. You know the portions are big if my marathon-running husband leaves full. \n\nI don't recommend the large, square table in front of the fireplace. It's too wide to be able to hear each other across it, and the couches on two sides sit you a touch too low. Also, animal-lovers beware: There's a lamb roasting on a spit in the fireplace.", "author": "Tracy C."}

And when you dip it in some taramosalata or tzatziki...oh man.\n\nIf you're going with one other person, I would suggest sharing one entree and a couple of their appetizers because there's such a great variety to choose from.

Not a big on feta, spanikopita, dried candied fruit, or saganaki. But for those that do like it, Kokkari definitely has the goods.\n\nWe had plenty of appetizers, the best for me was the Kalamata Pita, kind of like a flatbread pizza. I wasn't the biggest fan of their Tzatziki, too tangy and heavy by itself, but with the Zucchini Cakes, which were fabulous, it paired perfectly. Their pita bread was amazing, freshly baked and lightly grilled. \n\nAs for mains, we ordered the Moussaka and I wasn't terribly impressed. The bechamel sauce was excellent as was their preparation of eggplant but the ground lamb was overpowering and dense. And maybe that's just because lamb has to be done just right for me because this tasted a bit too gamey for my taste.\n\nFor dessert, I had the cookie plate and I felt apprehensive about finding that one cookie with anise which would have ruined it all for me but luckily, I didn't find one. The rice pudding had the candied currant in it and I couldn't handle it. The yogurt sorbet was really good though. They paired it with a red icey fruit crush and it was the perfectly light and refreshing. \n\nBeware of the Greek \"mud\" coffee.\n\nThe service was great. It's good when you don't notice what's happening. All of a sudden plates and new sets of silverware appeared, drinks were refilled mysteriously, dishes were placed rather meticulously. Our waiter took very good care of us and in good humor, taught us how to pronounce some of the items on the menu\n\nThe ambiance felt a bit as though it was a good place to take a high powered client out and not as much fun for a group of girls wanting a night out but it was still fun and we took it for all we could get. Pricey, so come prepared. In case you're wanting to impress, they DO have a $700 bottle of wine. \n\nI'd recommend Kokkari for sure.", "author": "Jenny M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-21", "description": "Named after a small fishing village on the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, Kokkari is a fantastic Greek restaurant in downtown San Francisco. The interior of the restaurant is said to offer the charm of a rustic old-world Mediterranean country inn. It definitely has the charm but in the literal sense there's nothing rustic about this upscale urban restaurant. The impressive interior is warm and inviting, with appealing woodwork and impressive attention to detail.\n\nWe booked our reservation the same day, to the surprise of the hotel concierge, with the only time available at 9:30. If the restaurant was supposed to be busy that night it didn't feel like it. Most of the tables were full but unlike many bustling downtown restaurants the atmosphere in Kokkari remained calm and relaxed. This really helped to create an intimate dining experience that felt more like visiting a spa than a restaurant.\n\nWith plans to be in Napa Valley the next day I chose not to partake in wine that evening but instead enjoyed a couple cocktails with dinner. They did have a nice wine list however, focusing on fine producers from around the world including several Greek and Mediterranean selections and of course an emphasis on California. On my next visit to Kokkari, and there will be a next visit, I'll look into pairing some Greek/Mediterranean wine with my meal.\n\nThe menu offered up several outstanding choices, with no real surprise given my affinity for food from that region. To start the meal we enjoyed a Kalamata Pita, basically a flat bread/pita pizza, and some feta stuffed calamari. I always appreciate it when restaurants offer new ways of preparing calamari, especially if not fried, and really enjoyed the flavors that the feta provided. For some, the texture may be a little weird. As a main course I enjoyed the Moussaka, a rich casserole dish that comes in a little crock-pot and offers rich flavors of silky cream and nutmeg bbq pork.\n\nI don't often order dessert but the meal was going so well we couldn't help but splurge on the house favorite Galaktoboureko, as recommended by our server. The filo wrapped custard and apricots were excellent and the cr\u00e8me fraiche ice cream was perfect. Overall our experience was excellent including our server, who offered up fantastic recommendations and provided impeccable service...including when I spilt salt allover the table and tried my best to cover up the accident myself. \"It happens all the time,\" I was told.

The food and service are of the top caliber for San Francisco, but dining here is an experience. You feel warm and fuzzy rather than sterile and quiet. For me, it doesn't get better than this. \n\nAs a party of three celebrating a birthday, we knew we were in for a treat as we walked through the sumptuous rooms of Kokkari with its warm woods, copper accents and fire ovens. Water service and bread were prompt (the birthday boy LOVES a good bread basket). Our waiter, Christopher, deserves a special mention. His encyclopedic knowledge of the menu was applaudable and he was just a nice guy willing to walk you through the menu to get the best meal possible. A chilled greek white wine along with a sampling of appetizers started us on our way. We tried the dolmathes ($7), Kolokithokefthetes ($9) and Spanakotiropita ($9).... all three were delicious, but the zucchini cakes were my favorite. For entrees, they offer grilled or plank-baked fish each day... no matter what it is, get it, get it grilled and savor. Served whole with roasted vegetables, it's impeccable ($32).  As the other reviews will tell you, the lamb chops are arguably the best in the city; at $31, it's a worthwhile splurge for the flavor and tenderness. For dessert, we tried both the Sokolatina ($9) and the day's ice cream (baklava); they were both flavorful and well-balanced without being heavy on the sugar. With a little Greek Coffee (metrio means medium sweet), you'll get that kick you need to pull you out of the impending food coma from sampling all the delights of Kokkari. Pacing of the courses was great and the food is drool-worthy on all counts. \n\nThankfully I had a generous gift certificate in hand and we spent it all. I highly recommend taking any client here the next time you've got an expense account to burn. Or, simply know that you're paying a worthwhile price for food, service and ambiance that all combine for a wonderful evening conducive to good conversation and great celebration.", "author": "Erin M."}

Honestly, orgasmic. \n\nPrices I felt were totally reasonable - especially for the quality of food, srevice and decor. Really, just an amazing dinner.", "author": "Lindsay A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-03", "description": "My husband and I eloped in SF this week. The restaurant we chose for our wedding dinner was Kokkari, because his family is Greek and we just love Mediterranean/Greek food; after visiting yelp were swayed in the Kokkari direction.\n\nWe came a little early for our reservation, which was unnecessary, because the place was packed. We waited for about 30 minutes in the bar/hallway area, which actually wasn't too bad because there was some great people watching to be had. While we were waiting, we realized we were standing with our backs to a small two person table, where my butt was practically on the dinner plates. We both took note of this terrible table and remarked, \"that's totally where they're gonna seat us.\" \n\nAbout 20 minutes later, that is precisely where they seated us. We probably could have said something, but we actually both just laughed and sat down. Oh well. It wasn't that bad, really, since the restaurant has an intimate and warm feeling, so we barely noticed the people standing near by. \n\nLet's talk about food, though: It was excellent. We started with Spanakopita and lemon soup, both of which we liked. My husband got the rotisserie which was lamb, and I got the lemon chicken. The chicken was good, but I kinda wished I had tried something more exciting. My husband on the other hand thought his lamb was spectacular, moist, and flavorful, he practically licked his plate clean.  For desert we tried the greek yogurt with dates, walnuts and figs (?), which ended up being my favorite dish of the night.  Would recommend!", "author": "Dee E."}

I always smile when I see those things all faded out and still in the window.  They don't even have gyros (thank god) or most other recognizable Greekisms.  Kokarri's brand of  cuisine is a delicious fusion of Mediterranean influences. Think seafood, lamb, feta and olives (and more... I assure you) presented in the best possible way.\n\nThis place is real nice and on a pretty grand scale.  Pretty much a can't miss for special occasions (for the rest of us... who don't walk suit and tie from the financial district).  My girlfriend took me here my birfbday and we were really impressed with all the details.  Read on...\n\n  The restaurant space itself has a very inviting and well designed feel.  Depending on your mood the restaurant offers two very distinct rooms to dine.  The first near the entrance is living roomesque, appointed with couches, fireplaces, lower lighting and a bar area.   The second space is much brighter, with light wood trimmings and large windows which provide appealing natural light and view onto the nice quiet street beyond. This space also has some larger tables and is flanked by the kitchen.   The place is pretty cavernous though, with several other rooms in back and downstairs (where you must elevator to the bathroom!) even has a cellar room if you have fat pockets.  \n\nThe space and ambiance aside, the food is some of the best I have had.  We went for a pretty wide sampling of plates and I have to recommend the grilled octopus and the artichoke and eggplant kabobs.  The flavor is heavenly, the perfect balance of char, lemon, oil and oregano.  And the texture of octopus is incredible, like chicken but tastes like swordfish.  Plus, we are always suckers for olives and feta, anywhere anytime, and these were a solid, if pedestrian choice.  For dinner I had a whole baked fish.  I always find it novel, but it was really tasty here, seasoned perfectly and suited my mood, served with potatoes and some kind of veggy.  I believe my girlfriend had the ravioli (its was the only vegetarian entre) but also bursting with flavor.   Very fresh food, cooked right, seasoned to a T.  \n\nPlus, they have a very interesting and extensive (if pricy) wine list.  Featured many selections from the baltic region and the wine we had was Macedonian-- the most affordable \"old world\" red and had that kind of spicy, fruity, and complete, that sticks in your mind's palate for days after.  \n\nTo cap things off, they even brought out a gratis desert, the meyer lemon custard with filo and ice cream with a birthday candle.   It was a a very delicious touch.  And for kicks try the sand heated coffee (its not the best, but now you know what the huge open kettle of flaming sand you walked by is all about).\n\n  I must say the service was damn near telepathic (really, the best I've ever had), everything you needed was quickly attended to and was never obtrusive.   \n\nAnd finally, believe it or not I found benjamin that had slipped out of someone's money clip on the floor next to our table!

We chose to have the lamb chops, which the restaurant is known for and deservedly so.\n\nThe wine list is phenomenal, hitting all the key spots around the world.

(good thing the meal was free!)\n\ni came as part of a client's very belated office holiday lunch (in january LOL), so we all went hog wild. we had the following starters: \n\n* grilled pita with these spreads: melitzanosalata, tzatziki, tirosalata. (i didn't try because well, i'm not a fan of such spreads, but the pita was thick and yummy!)\n\n* grilled lamb riblets: yes, they're quite riblet-y (as opposed to rib-y), so they're small, but the meat is succulent and flavorful.\n\n* grilled calamari: i was a bit sketch to see calamari stuffed with feta, but hey, it was delish! (the feta was goopy and melty and so yummy inside the little squid!)\n\n* spanakotiropita: pretty much what you'd expect, but the crust was oh-so-flaky and buttery! the pieces were decently-sized too, so having one per person was definitely enough.\n\n* wood oven roasted prawns: HALLELUJAH. seriously, i would drive all the way from fremont just to have this dish again. the prawns were ginormous and meaty (nom nom!) and the flavor was just phenomenal. (i had to have two shrimp--could not leave it at just one, client-consultant lunch etiquette be damned.) i can't describe it...just wonderful. tomato-y and yet very far from shrimp topped with spaghetti sauce. gah! so good!\n\nfor my main course i had the beef short ribs taverna style. this was a very hearty, crock-pot-ish dish. the meat was braised to such tenderness. not all sloppy melt-in-your-mouth with no substance, but enough of a balance between tender and chewy. i'm not normally a big fan of orzo, yup, i ate every single last piece. \n\nthe person sitting across from me at the table had the albacore tuna souvlaki--it looked to be a bit overcooked, but he didn't complain, so maybe not. \n\nfor dessert i tried some of the greek yogurt with honey (yiaourti me meli). i'm a big greek yogurt + honey fan and this was excellent, if not a bit TOO sweet. others at the table said the flourless chocolate cake (sokolatina) was very yummy. i also had a cup of sweet (glyko) greek coffee--like an espresso with sweetner. a nice change from a typical after-dinner coffee.\n\nthe service was excellent, as was the warm decor. i would definitely come back in a heartbeat!", "author": "Jonathan K."}

If you time it right it could make for a very sweet activity before or after.  It can get a little noisy but it is still pretty intimate in some places.  The owner remembers alot of faces as I've also been introduced to Evvia, their sister restaurant, in Palo Alto.  You must order the lamb- without question!!  Outside of a vacation to Turkey it was the best lamb I have ever had.  I always get it and am never disappointed.  The place is pretty big and right on the corner.  They have a pretty deep dining room and some private dining areas one can access by elevator.  It's a long walk back there from the front.  Can't wait to go back.", "author": "sarah b."}

Recommend it highly, but the bar is extremely crowded, if that's where you are headed. We went on a Friday night and that's my go-to seating.  We got a table for two immediately and truly enjoyed the entire experience, thanks in large part to Edward, our server. We had Artichoke and Saganahki for appetizers, the special white peach salad (both of us). Then my dining companion got Moussaka and I got the stuffed calamari for my entree. FABULOUS all around. Wine selection was incredible and Edward helped me with the pairing. We didn't get dessert, we just didn't have room.", "author": "Dottie P."}

You have to get a reservation though, and probably a week in advance for a good time, so it seems best suited for special occasions.  The seating in the front by the wood oven is vastly superior to the back, where its not quite as romantic.  So if you can reserve seating area in your reservation then do that, but either way, its not that big of a deal.\n\nFor appetizers, we got the prawns and meatballs.  The prawns were good, but not as amazing as some people on here have posted.  Although the sauce was delicious and perfect to dip the bread in.  The meatballs were really good as well, and same goes for the sauce haha.\n\nFor entrees, I got the goat stew.  It was delicious.  I tried some of the chicken and potatoes dish as well.  The potatoes were average, but the chicken was moist and very good.  The best entree at our table was the lamb shank.  Holy cow, it was huge and the meat fell off the bone.  I tried some and it was fabulous.  If not for the taste, just the appearance.  Its one of those dishes that when they bring it to the table, everyone elses eyes get big and they are like oh man i should have gotten that! \n\nI got teh flourless chocolate cake.  It was good but nothing special.  Can't speak about any of the other desserts.  Overall, I was very pleased.  The service was a little slow, but thats not always a bad thing, especially if there is a good ambiance and good appetizers.  Would have really loved some butter or olive oil to go with the bread tho lol", "author": "Payam S."}

I was lucky enough to live in Greece for two years dining at the tables of tavernas and yiayias (grandmothers) across the country. Kokkari made me feel like I was there again. It's completely authentic, so authentic, I even heard Greek being spoken in the restaurant. We had a lot of food: fasolakia (white beans) zucchini cakes (always a must), the Psari Psito stin Sxara (a whole mediterranean branzino sea bass, holy cow that was good), stuffed kalamari... everything was incredible. Kokkari is as good as it gets. I've eaten at enough Greek restaurants across the bay area to say that. Everything about it was comforting. We got a table in the window looking onto the park, next to this enormous firplace with a rotisserie lamb inside.

Let's just say, as a group, we were underwhelmed.\n\nHoliday aside, and the usual pitfalls that come with staff hit by a busier then normal night, the service was smooth. Our specific waitress was a little flustered, but her supporting cast was great.\n\nThe food, sadly, was not nearly as redeemable. As a party of 5, we ordered 5 starters: zucchini cakes, lamb meatballs, purslane and apricot salad, fried smelts, and gigantes (beans). The zucchini cakes and salad were good, not great. But the remaining 3 apps left something to be desired. The meatballs were dry and underseasoned, despite the sauce that was liberally applied over the top, and the fried smelts were limp and the garlic sauce that came with them was too pungent. The gigantes were fair, although the baked beans dish at Nopa is far superior (as are their fried little fish).\nThe entrees too left us disappointed. The two fish dishes we ordered were a little too fishy tasting and the accompaniments and sauces were bland. We had two orders of the rotisserie duck, which sounded promising and was fine. The skin was not crisp and the duck was a little overcooked and dried out. The sauce on the potatoes and the baby arugula was nice. The only \"wow\" dish was the porterhouse. A tender, perfectly cooked piece of meat with excellent sides and seasoning.\nWe gave dessert a shot. It was fine. A little too sweet and they all tasted similar. But at least a tasty ending to the meal.\n\nThree stars based solely on the porterhouse. Otherwise the rest of the food would bring it to a 2.\n\nI would recommend the short drive down to Palo Alto to visit Evvia, Kokkari's sister restaurant, which is vastly superior.", "author": "T T."}

DONT GET THIS IF YOU WANT TO FEEL STOPID! i say this because you could simply make this on your own. you just get honey, granola, yogurt, and walnuts and mix it together, and wala, there you have it, a cheap ass breakfast to be...

We were a little crammed into the back private area and the seating was a bit awkward because they pushed round and square tables together, but it was nice and cozy anyways. We had a filling 4 course meal and the wine was constantly flowing. For the main entree, we all had the grilled lamb chops, roasted chicken and halibut. The chicken was tender and nicely seasoned, the lamb chop was flavorful, however the halibut was overcooked and dry. For dessert, we had the selection of Greek cookies - the baklava was the best. I would've liked to substitute that for the Kokkari sundae, but I'll just have to go back another time for it. We also got a round of ouzo, so by the end of the night, I got to see a whole other side of a lot of my coworkers.", "author": "Connie C."}

The waitress was nice and helpful, but the service was slow and not the finest because I had to request water 3 times before actually getting it. Also they separated our table into two and got our orders mixed up between us and a couple, which was acceptable once, but irritating after this occurred a couple times more. Overall, the service was a 2.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the zucchini cakes which were very delicious.  The yogurt dipping sauce added a nice light touch to the cakes. The portions for the entree are big such that my friend and I had to go boxes in the end. I had the lemon-oregano chicken with roasted onions & Kokkari potatoes, which I enjoyed. The chicken was tender and well seasoned, maybe slightly too lemon-y. My friend had the braised lamb shank with orzo & myzithra. The lamb was so tender that she didn't need to use a knife to cut it and still delicious. The orzo was tasty, but I think in combination with the lamb, was definitely too rich and buttery to handle.  We finished the night with desserts of course. The semolina custard in filo was delicious and just right for the palate.  I enjoyed the sundae with chocolate and vanilla ice cream because of the touch of hazelnuts and layering of hot fudge, but the vanilla ice cream was slightly too creamy and rich.", "author": "T. K."}

Everything was amazing. From the mains the paidakia (lamb chops) with the potatoes are Kokkari's specialty anyway and rightly so. We also had the fresh seabass with horta (braised greens) - I was immediately transported to a Greek island! \nThe service is impeccable, everyone was very professional and friendly, not stuffy at all. In fact we even had a two year-old with us and did not feel uncomfortable at all.\nAnd if you think it is expensive, well, wait till you have fresh fish in Greece!\nFinally, it's so authentic Greek that they treated us to dessert and dessert wine! \nIt was perfect!", "author": "Chris D."}

We arrived around 7:30 for an 8:00 reservation, and the very kind hostess was able to seat us almost immediately, despite the place being packed. \nMy first impression was great. The front room is both open and cozy at the same time -- extremely high ceilings, and yet a warm, comfortable feel. I got the sense that the people at each table felt like they were in their own little worlds. A lot of the tables in the front room had big upholstered chairs that looked really comfy. \nWe were seated in the back room, after passing by the massive open roasting oven. The back room is even bigger, but just as cozy. \nThe menu was amazing -- we easily could have picked 15 different dishes that we wanted. Fortunately, we didn't make up our minds too quickly, because the specials sounded even better. We ended up going with the peach and arugula salad (the last week they were offering it for the year, our server informed us), the zucchini cakes, the goat stew and the Mediterranean branzino special. Husband drank Mythos beer and I had a couple of very tasty mojitos.\nEvery single thing we ate was delicious. The zucchini cakes are a standout -- they were thick and juicy like really good crabcakes, and you get to feel good about yourself for eating zucchini. The peach salad was delightful too -- I highly recommend it if they serve it again next summer. My goat stew was amazing -- the goat meat was tender, almost falling apart, and the flavors melded together perfectly. My hysband's branzino was light and flaky, though I only took one bite because I was so engrossed with my stew. \nDessert was delicious too. I ordered the baklava ice cream, and it shouldn't come as any surprise that combining two delicious things leads to something even more delicious. My husband got the rice pudding, which I didn't love, but I don't like rice pudding in general -- he thought it was pretty good. \nThe service was excellent -- our waters were constantly refilled, they brought us a second basket of bread without asking, and our server was nice and funny. The restaurant crowd was mixed, from lots of guys in suits with no ties doing business dinners to groups of thirty-somethingsvin nice jeans to dressed-up couples celebrating an anniversary. Overall, a great experience. \nQuick tip: the bathroom is downstairs, and you have to take an elevator to get there. I kept seeing confused people getting to the end of the hallway and wondering where to go from there.", "author": "Kristin P."}

You walk in and you are whisked away to another time and place with the giant fireplace with grilled meats rotating on the spit.  The ambiance is warm, rustic and refined.  The food is no different as each bite is soothing to the soul.  An extensive selection of wine is available as evidenced by the countless bottles scattered around the restaurant.  I've gone several times, but most recently we started out with about four or five of the small plates including the grilled octopus, grilled stuffed calamari, grilled meatballs (there are in fact non grilled dishes on the menu I think!), zucchini cakes, and spanakotiropita.  The first three were fantastic.  The octopus was cooked as octopus should be prepared but so rarely is.  If you've never had octopus properly cooked, it shouldn't taste rubbery but should instead be tender and soft.  The calamari stuffed with feta, fennel, orange and black olives works.  The orange adds a unique citrus flavor to the mix.  The meatballs were also excellent.  Our vegetarian friend wasn't impressed with the zucchini cakes, but enjoyed his spanakotiropita.\n\nFor our entrees we were in heaven with the lamb souvlaki (delicious ground lamb skewered and grilled served with warm pita), the short ribs taverna style (mouth-watering short ribs that melted in our mouths with an outstanding risotto), and the must-have moussaka.  They were out of pastitsio, the Greek version of lasagna, that day unfortunately.  \n\nIf you dine at Kokkari, you MUST and I mean MUST order the Galaktoboureko for dessert.  It's so damn good!  Trust me, even if you're stuffed and in pain, which you will be, order this and you'll thank me later.\n\nSister restaurant Evvia (the original) in Palo Alto is also a winner in my book.", "author": "Dave L."}

I took my greek friend here because we have been talking about splurging and eating a big dinner here for a long time. Well we definitely splurged (see our menu and comments below). Atmosphere was fantastic - very romantic and charming, food was unbelievable, wine was terrific. Only thing that I didn't like was that the waiter, even after we explained that we are very very familiar with greek food, still tried to dumb everything down for us and explain \"in american terms\" what all the dishes were. Oh well, I guess that's a good thing for people who don't eat greek food all the time.\n\nHere's a run-down of what we ordered. We had our dinner \"Greek style\" meaning we stayed for 3.5 hours and slowly ate our shared dishes and had good conversation. None of this american eat-as-fast-as-you-can-and-bolt type of thing...\n\n*Saganaki - mmm fried cheese with olive oil and lemon. Quickest way to my heart is wine and melted cheese. So good. Have had it a bit more stringy at other places - this was more crisp but still very good.\n*Tzaziki - pretty basic and common greek dip, but Kokkari uses real greek yogurt so it was very thick and the fresh dill made it even better\n*Tirosalata - One of my favorite greek salatas made with poblano chiles and feta cheese. Not spicy at all but has a great flavor from the chiles.\n*Melitzanosalata - thick/chunky eggplant and tomato \"dip\" - went well with the grilled pita bread, but liked the other salatas better\n*Kokoretsi - lamb organ meats... yum! But seriously, it was very good and was just like regular lamb meat, maybe a bit more of a lamb-y flavor to it. If you love lamb like I do, you'll love this. Potatoes were good dipped in our leftover tsaziki so make sure they don't clear away any plates that still have food on them until after you're done.\n*Katsikaki Yuvetsi - goat stew. Very, very, very good. Had that definite \"greek flavor\" with spices like cinnamon and cloves.

The 4 of us went family style so we got to try lots of dishes and most everything was delicious, but the superstars were the roasted artichoke/eggplant skewer (love the yogurt sauce!), the tomato fritter (special for the night, but we're told it's in the style of their zucchini cakes), the special rotisserie Berkshire pork (possibly the best pork I've ever had), and the desserts - wow.

Other dishes we had - watermelon/feta salad (pretty good, but I could have made this at home), lambs tongue (very tender and tasty, definitely worth trying - after all, where else are you going to get lambs tongue?), lamb chops (tender, flavorful - a solid dish for the less adventurous.  Bonus points to Kokkari for throwing in an extra chop so everyone could have one a-la-family-style).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-12", "description": "When I think Greek, I think of Kokkari Estiatorio, located just north of the Financial District, or its sister restaurant, Evvia, in Palo Alto.  Since Stanfurd sucks, I prefer going to Kokkari in the City  to satiate my occasional Greek craving.  \n\nFood:  5 stars.   The food at Kokkari is very comparable to what I experienced in Athens a few years back.  Most dishes have lots of oregano, olive oil, and/or lemon.  Simple yet delicious.  For appetizers, we enjoyed the octopodaki tou yiorgou (grilled octopus with lemon, oregano and olive oil), saghanaki (pan fried Kefalograviera cheese with lemon and oregano), and aginares souvlaki (grilled artichokes and eggplant skewers with Greek yogurt).  The octopus was the best that I've ever had (not that there is much to compare it to).  I also loved the crispiness of the pan fried cheese and the grilled artichokes were perfection.  For entrees, we had the roasted whole branzino, roasted whole sole (both were fishes of the day), kotopoulo souvlas (lemon-oregano roasted Fulton Valley chicken with fasolakya), arnisia paidakia (grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette with potatoes), and mosharisia brizola (charcoal grilled dry-aged ribeye with braised greens and potatoes).  The grilled lamb chops, a signature dish, is tender and delicious, as is the ribeye.  The chicken skin, although so bad for you, was soooo good and so worth the cholesterol.  The chicken meat was nice and juicy as well.  I was surprised that the fish dishes, although good, were outshone by the meat dishes.  All entrees are pretty large in portions, which is good for me because I got to take some leftover chicken and ribeye home with me.  For dessert, we had the kokkari sundae, which tasted like a normal sundae, and the sokolatina (flourless dark chocolate cake with sweetened whipped cream), which was rich and decadent.  A couple of us wanted to try greek coffee for the first time.  It was going to be our last time, unfortunately, because the coffee had a muddy texture that I just didn't care for.  \n\nService:  5 stars.  The valet can be very patient and understanding with customers.  This was evidenced when my road raging friend got into a cussing match with another driver as she pulled up to the valet.  The hostess and wait staff can be quick to react to our needs.  This was evidenced by how quickly they rushed over to our table to clean up the mess that occurred when my same friend accidentally knocked over her water glass as she sat down.  Our server was very helpful, patient, and always available to answer our questions.  This was evidenced by the same friend's request for our server to describe the fishes of the day a couple of minutes after he had already done so.    \n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.  The first thing I noticed about this place was damn, there are a LOT of old people here!!!  That's generally who they stick in the dining room in front.  Fortunately, there is a plethora of younger people dining in the larger room in back.  The dining rooms definitely resemble the design of restaurants in Greece, with a few exceptions:  (1) couches in the front dining room, (2) a grand fireplace that serves as the showcase for the front room, and (3) an elevator that takes you down to the restrooms (don't hold your #1 til the last minute).  \n\nHits:   Grilled octopus, grilled artichokes and eggplant skewers, fried cheese, grilled lambchops, Fulton Valley chicken.\n\nMisses:  Greek coffee (my preference), too many old people, smug waiters, having to take an elevator to use the restroom.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Evvia, Mezes, Zeyno Mediterranean Grill", "author": "Keith C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-29", "description": "One of the reasons why I love my low-life job is that I get to pick where we eat for our holiday luncheons.  It's a good and bad thing because there are so many picky eaters.  You've got the vegetarians, the ones who don't eat red meat, don't eat raw fish, you name it.  I chose this place because the vegetarian had mentioned it so I knew it would be decent.  They were able to accommodate our party of 20 at the chef's table.  It's a great place for group events, however, I booked too late to get a private room so it was still a bit noisy.  \n\nSince we had a large party, we had to book off a set menu and it was family style.  Originally I asked people in my group what they wanted to eat, after getting 20 different answers, I had to pick them myself.  Luckily, they have something for everyone's tastebuds here.  We ate salad, zucchini cakes, potatos, kale, chicken and fish as main courses, and baklava and flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  The zucchini cakes were delicious - it's vegetarian, but tastes like crab cakes so it was good for everyone.  The chicken and fish were ok - I am a red meat eater, but had to go with the chicken to please the non-meat eaters.  If I were to choose again, I think I'd rather go with lamb or something.  Chicken is just chicken.  The fish was sea bass which wasn't bad.   The baklava with ice cream was my favorite, but the flourless cake was really too sweet for me.  It was very dense.  Some people might like that, but I couldn't eat it.  I saw one of my coworkers getting upset when nobody was eating their cake, so I knew he'd eat all the rest of them.  After all, I ordered the cake for him originally.\n\nI really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant.  It's very classy, yet comfortable.  The service was exceptional and they kept our glasses full and they were prepared for our large group.  We never had to wait for any food to come, they just waited patiently for us to finish.  Since it was for the holidays and we had a gift exchange, they even helped us out with that by putting all our gifts aside and giving a bowl for numbers.  I'd definitely come back here.", "author": "Stacey C."}

We did just that.  \nWe each had a glass of wine and ordered the grilled calamari.  \nWe were seated before the appointed reservation time which was nice .  The place was crowded.

I had the ravioli, my husband had the Friday special (paputsaki) and my daughter had the lamb souvlaki.  We would recommend each.  We consumed everything!\nThe only issue we had during the course of our meal was the wine.  We ordered a pinot noir from the wine list.  Our waiter came back to let us know that the list had not been updated and they were out of our choice.  No problem, we ordered another pinot...same thing.  Our server came back to tell us they were out of that one too.  No problem though, he had brought back another choice and offered it at the same price of our original selection.  We agreed.

I've never gone out to eat in the city with a 50 year-old woman and a 79 year-old woman, and let me tell you that most restaurants in this young city are not kind to older people.  Pesce was the exception.\n\nI'll start with our service.  Our waiter was some shouted at my grandma for the first half of our service then completely ignored her and addressed all questions to me when she looked confused (her hearing is fine; she couldn't figure out why this man was treating her like a 4 year-old).  She asked for butter for her bread several times and never got it.  I had planned on ordering a glass or two of wine and put in the order with the rest of our food.  By the time our entrees arrived I had to cancel it because it still had not come.  Unfortunately, our waiter refused to make eye contact with us because he was too busy schmoozing with the table next to us; they ordered bottles of wine.  It took me a good 20 minutes to get his attention to cancel my drink.  To his credit, he gave us free dessert in an effort to make up for this but I wasn't happy about washing down my lamb chop with a glass of water.  The rest of the staff was fantastic though, and ended up attempting to pick up the slack. \n\nOnto the food...fantastic!  The food is the reason I'm giving it 4 stars.  When I come back, which I will do in spite of the horrible service, I will probably order all appetizers (Sorry Kristen, for not listening to you and just doing that in the first place!).  We had incredible duck dolmathes, roasted butternut squash, and zucchini cakes.  We split an a lamb chop special for our entree, which probably also contributed to our waiter's attitude.  We ordered it cooked medium to medium-well for my mom and grandma and it came medium-rare (which I was happy about).  Our [free] desserts were also delicious!\n\nThere were a few more things that happened but I should stop complaining because we left full and satisfied but with a bad taste in our mouth (metaphorically, not literally).  I'll come back without the old ladies and try again because I hate to think that a place that serves food that amazing can really deliver such an awful customer experience.", "author": "Alyssa W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-09", "description": "This is my third visit in as many years; it's been too long, Kokkari!\n\nGreek cuisine is something I'd like to know better; my experience is limited to gyros, Kokkari, and Gerald Durrell's descriptions of his childhood in Corfu.\n\nAn early December visit means that the working fireplace was very welcome, and the decor (with pine cones and apples tucked into the chandelier) was cozy and beautiful. We came with a fairly large group to celebrate a co-worker's impending maternity leave, and they gave us a good (large, round) table. Our waiter was a nice guy; he patiently waited while we gave our co-worker her gifts after the main course, and added a candle to her dessert. I also appreciated his pronunciation of the difficult-to-me Greek words; hopefully I can now remember how to say \"moussaka\" next time.\n\nHere is what our group ordered (asterisk marks the ones I personally tasted):\n\nAppetizers:\n*Spanakopita\n*Zucchini cakes\n*Grilled calamari\n*Tzatziki and two other spreads with housemade grilled pita\nPersimmon salad\n\nEntrees:\n*Octopus salad\nGrilled lamb chops\nLahanofilodolmathes (braised cabbage leaves stuffed with veal)\n\nDessert:\n*Baked apple with \"sap\" gelato\nRice pudding\nSorbet with fruit granita\nChocolate cake\nBaklava\nGreek yogurt\nGelato\n\nI've never particularly enjoyed spanakopita since I'm not a huge fan of savory phyllo treats. (Baklava, on the other hand, is *all good*.) The various spreads were interesting and toothsome, particularly the one made with cod roe. The grilled calamari was tender, sour with lemon juice, and stuffed with feta, which I have to admit visually grossed me out a little as it gushed out when I pressed down on the morsel with my fork. Yup, my hands-down favorite appetizer was the zucchini cake. I couldn't tell what else was in the filling, but it was one crisp fried morsel of deliciousness.\n\nThe grilled lamb chops, which are Kokkari's signature dish, were very popular with my group (half chose this). Two more chose the tongue-twisting Lahanofilodolmathes, which are cabbage leaves stuffed with veal, braised in avgolemono (egg-lemon soup). I was tempted but decided against it. For one thing, I'm Hindu and rarely eat beef -- although I did have an In-N-Out burger to see what all the fuss was about -- and for another, I remembered watching a PETA commercial on raising calves for slaughter. I will say that people seemed entirely content with the lamb chops and the veal.\n\nWell, I was feeling adventurous, so I got the octopus salad. I don't think I'd had octopus before, so I wasn't sure what it's supposed to taste like. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to taste like much of anything. The chewy texture, along with the tiny suckers on some of the pieces, didn't really bother me. But I wish the octopus had been more flavorful and tender. The salad comes with a ton of frisee; I made it halfway before tiring of the dressing. It was light and lemony, and I generally do enjoy tart flavors. But I hadn't realized how important the lemon is in Greek cooking; I guess I don't like it *that* much.\n\nSo let's move on to dessert! As you can see, our table ordered a wide selection, and the presentation of each was simple and lovely. I am so glad I continued being adventurous and ordered the baked apple. That doesn't sound too risky, you say? Well, it came with a scoop of -- get this -- sap-flavored gelato. I looked up the mysterious \"mastiki\" flavor; Wikipedia says that the mastic shrub is culitvated for its aromatic resin. The flavor was cold and sweet and sharp, and invoked a green woodsy feel. I've never had anything like it. Like a sweet popsicle made with the essence of a pine tree. Probably one of the most interesting things I've ever tried; I feel oddly proud that I went for it. Combined with a succulent baked apple (which was filled with walnuts and cinnamon), it made for one of the most memorable desserts I've ever had -- and I usually have to be restrained from getting the most chocolate-y thing on the menu.\n\nThings I have to remember to order next time:\nZucchini cakes\nMoussaka (this was from an earlier visit to Kokkari. It was delicious but guilt-inducingly rich)\nBraised dolmathes (stuffed with lamb or chicken)\nBaked apple with mastiki gelato\nGreek yogurt\n\nYup, I should start counting the days (and going to spin class) until my next visit to Kokkari. Thanks to the friendly waitstaff; we had a tasty lunch for a happy occasion!\n\nAlso, I have got to figure out how to write shorter reviews ... With 1000+ glowing reviews, y'all really needed another one!", "author": "S R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-29", "description": "Hellenic cuisine is a rare species of restaurant, I feel, so I was especially excited when I discovered Kokkari Estiatorio. Sister restaurant to Evvia Estiatorio in Palo Alto, Kokkari shares with Evvia a warm decor of wooden floors and waist-high wood panels on the walls that establishes an atmosphere that is both elegant and comfortable. Kokkari's space is deceptively enormous, featuring back rooms to back rooms and a small lower level. One nice touch is that the wood panel motif extends into the interior of the elevator, maintaining a degree of consistency to the restaurant's ambiance even when guests find themselves in that rectangular metal box. On our way to our table, we walked past an open kitchen, which had a large wood-fire oven and what appeared to be a large stone mortar filled with sand, that served as the backdrop to our dining experience.\n\nWe started with an order of crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing, whose serving size the waiter kindly adjusted to fit our party. The cakes were spot on; their exterior was perfectly crispy without any hint of oil, and the interior was smooth, warm, and moist. While the grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette were recommended as the house signature dish, I decided to try the rotisserie special of the day, a brined and fire roasted Berkshire pig entree that was a succulent survey of the leg, loin, shoulder, and belly bacon cuts. Admittedly quite fatty, the rotisserie pork was moist -- nay, juicy -- and tender to the point where I possibly could have set down my knife and eaten my meal with a fork alone.\n\nFor dessert, I had the galaktoboureko, a semolina custard surrounded in filo served atop slices of candied apricot and with pistachio ice cream, which was good but not particularly noteworthy. The service, however, was outstanding throughout the meal. The waiter was quick, attentive, and affable.\n\nWhile Kokkari may not wow those looking for cutting-edge culinary innovations, it delivers extremely well-executed Greek food and an excellent all-around dining experience. I'm glad I made it out to dinner with the couples Kramer-Emmart and Kumnick-Raju, affectionately and better known as the Krametards and the Kumjus.

Since I was there for my friends company's Christmas party, I think we ordered close to everything on the Menu. We started with the Kalamata Pita (great if you love Kalamata olives), the Kalamari (not like the basic Calamari you usually picture, but still really really good), Arnisia Plevrakia (grilled lamb riblets, sounds bad I know, but it's SO good!! Try it, you'll love it.), we also had the\nAginares Souvlaki (grilled artichoke).  Everything was great, I would recommend any of the appetizers based off of the fact that we ordered so many and there wasn't one that I didn't like.\n For my meal I had the grilled lamb chops which were excellent, not to dried out and the seasoning was perfect. For dessert we ordered the sundae and chocolate cake, both really good, but kind of mediocre, nothing stellar about them.\n\nOverall I had a really great time here. The ambiance and decor upstairs are really romantic and classy. I would definitely come here on a date or for a nice dinner with my family or some close friends. And an FYI- it's a pretty expensive place, so try to have your sugar daddy/mama take you here. They have a really fantastic fireplace upstairs as well. Since we were downstairs in a private dining room I feel like the wait staff catered to us a little more closely then the wait staff upstairs would, but I guess that can't be determined until I eat upstairs. \n\nAfter writing this review I'm definitely craving to come back here!\n\n(PS- if you are interested in having a private dinner party here the minimum limit is 1,000$ that you must spend on your meal.)", "author": "Sarah T."}

It was so good....i can't even put it into words. So simple, with just lemon and oregano on top. The skin was so crispy and delicious and the meat was tender and soft.

We did send the entrees back for more \"heat\" as they were both delivered almost stone cold but our waitress didn't blink and hot plates were delivered toute suite.  The Kokkari potatoes are completely addicting (think garlic-lemony roasted goodness) and we thought we should have ordered a side to share after we tore through the few that accompanied the entrees.\n\nHad a turkish coffee(so-so) and the desserts were lemon curd in filo with pistachio ice-cream (very good) and their flourless chocolate cake (terrific).\n\nWe had a fine Groth Sauv Blanc at the bargain price of $36/bottle and then a couple glasses of a Pinot Noir that were pricey but good examples of their vintage/origin.  The wine list is extensive and interesting but no real critical guidance is available......couldn't help think that the missing component  of Kokkari's wine program is a on-site sommelier.

Another restaurant I've been dying to go to, so I decided to take someone special here to celebrate a milestone birthday.  The food was good but not knocking my socks off.  The service was phenomenal, especially since our waiter knew we were on a time crunch to catch a flight!  We started w/ the Zucchini cakes which was tasty.  For dinner, I had the rotisserie special of the day - duck (on the bone), and he had the short ribs - which was good, and better than my dish.  The birthday boy selected the Fig Tart, which I was skeptical about but it ended up being soooo delicious!

Nothing is available until 10pm which is on the late side for me but what the hell, its always such an amazing experience every time I go. We were sat in the corner banquette facing the restaurant, medium crowd, excellent service. Basically ordered the entire appetizer menu to start. My favorite though is the watermelon & feta, crispy smelt (SUPER YUMMY!) and the saghanaki! Paired that up with an old world Greek red. Then made our way into the dish that is NOT on the menu...the goat stew. Let me tell you this wonder combination of spit-fired goat, orzo, stewed tomatoes and feta is nothing but super goodness. I just sat and savored every bite. I even felt a bit selfish eating the last morsel and soaking up the tangy sauce with some pita bread. Then we finished up the evening with sampling the dessert menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-26", "description": "I just got back from one of the best dining experiences I've ever had, and luckily for you, I'm going to share it. \n\nAround 9pm, on a cool and beautiful night, we entered Kokkari. Because of our ignorance to how busy this place gets (even on a Thursday night), we did not make reservations. It was packed, and the hostess basically told us we had to cross our fingers and wait. Thankfully the food gods were on our side, and they let us slip into a small table on the side. \nKokkari had a very lovely appearance. The walls had a pleasant darkened wood texture, which radiated a warm and comfortable vibe. The lightening was dimmed romantically, which should please those couples out there. It was basically everything you could want and expect to see from a top-notch restaurant, and a perfect place to bring a date, that best friend, your boss, or hell, even your parents. The restaurant attire seemed to be on the \"upper\" side of things, so I wouldn't exactly have little Tommy's soccer team come here for a victory meal, but I walked in wearing a band t-shirt and no one gave me an evil-eye (that I saw). \n\n After being seated, we were greeted by the friendly and knowledgeable host. He was kind enough (or cruel enough, depending on how you look at it) to tell us his recommendations, which added weight to the already intensely tough decision that was to pick our meal. While we were being indecisive on our entrees, we ordered the Spanakotripita and Kalamari appetizers. The Spanakotripita was ok, but the \"kalamari\" on the other hand, was one of my favorite dishes, and a MUST GET for anyone heading to Kokkari. Perfectly grilled calamari stuffed with flavorfully feta cheese and olives? Oh yeah, that's right. Next time I'm getting two orders of this mouth-watering dish. Alongside the bread, which was good in its own right, they gave out a complimentary plate of Greek olives. Those olives I can only compare to heroin, expect for that death part, but hey, just as addictive. Who knew olives could be so damn good?!\n\nBy now you might have guessed that I am going to have an aneurysm explaining how much I enjoyed my entr\u00e9e. Well, I won't disappoint you. I got to try the Kokinsto me Masetra (Lamb Shank), Moussaka, and Goat Stew. The Lamb Shank was out of this world good. Served on the bone, all one had to do was lift it up for the juicy meat to gracefully slither off the bone. The mossuaka, being one of my favorite Greek dishes, was served differently from what I am used too, but it was a welcomed change. It was served almost like a cr\u00e8me brulee, with the top layer of yogurt to be the dishes highlight (also like cr\u00e8me brulee). The Goat Stew was also to die for. Much like the lamb, the goat was tender as can be, and rest of the stew complimented the dark meat brilliantly.  \n\nSo, just how good is this place? You'll be seeing the tender luscious meat gliding off colossal lamb bones in your dreams. You'll be the watercooler all-star at work as you describe your meal and how fantastic it was. You'll serial date just so you could take as many people here and impress them with your astounding taste. You'll suffer a food coma and wake up weeks later in a hospital bed. Ok, I took that last one a little too far, but I hope you get the point. This place is really good... really, really good. Make reservations, wear that sexy black dress you've been saving for a special occasion, and eat some of the best food you can find in the bay area.", "author": "Russell S."}

There is a table by the fireplace with sofas, which helps dress down the place if you will yet keeping it elegant. The bar looked nice as well.\n- Service - very attentive although we had a minor glitch\n- Good wine list\n\nCons:\n- One of the bus boys kept coming back every 2 minutes to see if my friend and I were done with our meal when we were clearly not finished and having a leisurely meal. We finally decided to mention this to our server who informed us that the individual was new and offered us free dessert.

It's good every single time I eat there (which isn't nearly as often as I'd like). Every other place starts good, then gets lazy. This place is crushing it year after year. How??\n\nMy latest visit: Sit at the bar. Chat with the cool bartender who pours extra wine for free. He sets up a full place setting for us and dinner arrives. \n- Assorted spreads - freaking amazing. (Who knew fava beans could taste so incredible as a dip?) The warm bread is so good it's outrageous.\n- Local deep-fried sand dabs - not especially Greek, but especially awesome.\n- Lamb riblets - I will now only eat lamb in riblet form. Not that I'll figure out which part of a sheep is the \"riblet\"\n- Skewers of eggplant and artichoke - Vert tasty but compared to the other stuff no fireworks. My dining companions were nuts about this dish, tho\n- Whole branzino with avgolemono sauce - sublime flavor. Whole fish is more work to eat, but it's sooo moist and tasty.\n- Goat stew. Strange? Maybe. Very very good spices and flavors in this dish. Cinnamon, other stuff I couldn't identify. Tasted a lot like lamb actually. This was the singular winner of the night. The bartender paired a glass of wine with this that was perfect. A high note.\n\nDesserts were the semolina pudding in filo and a chocolate cake. Delicious and generous portions.\n\nThis place just has everything. It's a little expensive, but you get it all in service, ambiance, food, and consistency. It's about food that's just yummy. Not \"unique\", not \"challenging\", not \"groundbreaking\", just unbelievably satisfying. And the dining experience is a textbook example of how to run a restaurant.\n\nEvery native should eat here at least once, and every visitor should make this a required stop.

You can still wait at the bar, but even that is crowded sometimes.\nFinally, we went there ahead of time and we got our table earlier...\n\nWent there with another person, and we had a very sweet table for two, seating on very comfy armchairs. Even if it's a bit noisy, the atmosphere is good and charming.\nWaiter service is fast enough and friendly.\n\nOn the food side of things, I first ordered a glass of Rose wine. A bit expensive, but very good so that I didn't regret it. It didn't really match what I ordered after that, but anyway, that was my choice. :) The Greek olives and bread we had before the starters were wonderful.\nAs appetizers, we shared some zucchini cakes that came along with cucumber salad and a yogurt sauce. Fresh, very tasty, this one is a must have! Second appetizer was a sort of pizza mainly made of greek olives, basil, caramelized onions and feta cheese, on a roasted pita bread with sprinkled rosemary. Very different from the other one, but still very good, generous and truly Mediterranean!\nThen, we ordered Moussaka and a roasted half chicken with Kokkari potatoes and onions. The latter one was very good and tasty, and again I retrieved that Mediterranean flavor I like very much.\nHowever, I have been a little disappointed by the Moussaka. Firstly, I didn't know that Cinnamon could be added to that dish (I'm not a great fan of Cinnamon). Secondly, even if it's doable,  there were so much Cinnamon that all the other flavors (eggplant, lamb, sauce) were hidden behind that. That way I felt like having my dessert instead of my main course...\nWe didn't ordered any dessert.\n\nTo sum up, it's a quite expensive place, but the price / quality is very good so you won't regret it.

Yay for new hire lunches.\n\nStarters - most to least favorite, although everything was really tasty (split 9-ways)\nGigantes - oven-baked giant beans with tomato sauce, olive oil & herbed feta.  I don't like giant beans; or at least, that's what I thought 'til now.  If you don't like them here, then you probably don't like them at all.  The texture and flavors were really great!\nOctapodaki tou Yiorgou - Grilled octopus with lemon, oregano & olive oil.  I'm biased; I like octopus, especially when they're not rubbery knobs of cephalopod meat, which these were not.  Surprising considering they were sizable chunks of octopus, and yet they still had a nice soft (but cooked) texture.\nBizelosalata -sweet green peas & feta with green onions.  Flavors that remind you that spring has definitely sprung in the Bay Area.\nGrilled Lamb Riblets - with lemon & oregano.  Lamb.  Riblets.  Finger food goodness.\nFried Smelts - with garlic-potato skordalia (think hummus) & lemon.  Upon first blush, they look like french fries with little itty bitty eyes hidden beneath a battered exterior.  The skordalia was definitely more garlicky today.  Sometimes more potato-y, sometimes more garlicky, according to our server.\nSaghanaki - pan fried Kefalograviera (cheese) with lemon & oregano.  Fried cheese.  Eat with tasty bread.\n\nMains (split 4-ways)\nRavioli - stuffed with wild greens & feta with artichokes & roasted Greek peppers. Wish they had given us 4 ravioli instead of 3, but the bite that I had was a lovely combination of savoriness I wasn't expecting from a pasta dish.\nGrilled Ahi Tuna - roasted asparagus with Kalamata olives & tomato sauce. Tuna so good, though I wouldn't say it was \"rare\" as described.  Definitely seared a bit more than I think we were expecting.\n\nDessert (all mine)\nYiaourti me Meli - Greek yogurt with spiced walnuts & dates drizzled with Greek Attiki honey.  I love Greek yogurt.  I buy Fage at Trader Joe's.  It doesn't even come close to the Greek yogurt I had today at lunch.  The density of the yogurt at Kokkari was like a heavy cake batter, and the freshness of the yogurt unlike anything I've ever eaten.  Though the walnuts and dates were tasty, I wish I hadn't eaten the few that I had and focused more on the yogurt.  Then I got too full and had to pass it down the table.  \n\nNote to self: order no more than one or 2 apps, skip the main and go directly to the Greek yogurt.  No sharing the yogurt, though, next time it's going to be all mine.", "author": "Anonymouse C."}

I was sitting alone at the end of the bar near a table at which the manager was sitting having a meeting with another employee. When I finished my soup and asked for the check, I was told that it was \"taken care of.\" The manager said he felt that his meeting intruded on my quiet lunch and, to apologize, my lunch was on the house. How nice is that?!? I was so caught off guard by the graciousness of the gesture that I was halfway down the block before I realized that I should have tipped my server, even though I wasn't charged.

Started off with the bread basket which was served with this olive oil that was the best olive oil I have ever had, thankfully they sell the bottles there so I ended up getting one. For the appetizer we had the zucchini cakes served with a yogurt sauce, sadly their were only two of them because I could have eaten twenty. Then for the main course, obviously I ordered the lamb with potatoes and the flavors couldn't have been more dynamic. The meat was cooked perfectly and I couldn't have been happier.

This place is the complete package on every level imaginable and I do declare this to be my favorite restaurant.\n\nI have been here twice and had the bar experience and the dining room experience. With kids and without.\n\nFirst the bar experience - We arrived on a friday night without reservations (clearly we are insane) but we had the pleasure of being directed to the bar by a very helpful manager that informed us a couple was getting ready to be seated at a table and if we wait behind their chairs we could sit right down at the bar. Thank you sir! You did not have to do that. But this is a reflection of their entire staff...helpful, extremely polite and very customer oriented. \nThe bar is large and incredibly well stocked with anything you could want. The wine list is amazing and you can order the full menu at the bar. As I said, it was friday night and the place was packed...especially the bar....however the bartender rocked! He paid equal attention to everyone, made spectacular drinks, and never was away from us for more than 5 minutes. He got our orders right and they came quite promptly. Kudos to him....he was swamped yet remained a pleasure to talk to, he was very patient, and he seemed truly happy to be there.\nWe ordered many different small plates and lot's of wine and I can't remember the last time I had food as good as this. Nothing was bad and everything was served up to perfection. The flavors, the presentation, it was all great. Also the ambiance of this place is incredible. Makes you feel ike you are all part of one big family dinner.\n\nThe second time we went was with friends and we made reservations. We also brought along 4 children and I must disagree with those of you who say it's not kid friendly. Not only was our waitress like a second mother to them, they also were more than willing to create a number of kid friendly dishes for the kids. Again, the service was amazing and our waitress was brilliant. She knew the answer to every question we asked her and I went with her recommendation for my entree and she did not steer me wrong. I can't recall all the food we had but let me just say we had 9 people and I tried everything and it was ALL amazing. \n\nThis place knows how to treat you, knows how to cook, and you would be hard pressed to find a better place to go. \n\nOh a funny side note: the night we ate at the bar we saw Ryan the temp from the show \"The Office\". Said hi to him. He was very nice...took pictures with a lot of kids and talked to everyone. 5 stars for him...lol", "author": "Josh J."}

I had my birthday and, since I come from Greece, I wanted to celebrate in a place that reminds me of my home country. Kokkari is probably one of the least original Greek restaurants in San Francisco Bay Area. We had made a reservation early at noon, so we reached the place and we sat on our table shortly. We just took a Greek \"tsipouro\" drink and we ordered from the different and impressive menu. The lamb ribs were one of the most tasteful recipies that I have ever tasted. We had also taken greek appetizers; \"tyrosalata\" (creamy salad with traditional feta cheese and spicy green peppers), \"taramosalata\", \"octapus\" and \"kalamari\" as I like fish food, and some yummy \"kolokythokeftedes.\" The food was impeccable, I was really glad to having been in such a restaurant. In the bar people were flirting and releasing the tension after work. The music was greek and I felt grateful for leaving those moments. In order to visit the restrooms you have to take the lift and get driven to the beautiful space downstairs. There is also the option of private dining. The service was really good, and even though the restaurant was full of reservations, your personal waiter was always districtly there.

Also had the avgolemono soup, which was good, but for $8, I can make a huge pot of it that tastes exactly the same at home for the cost of a rotisserie chicken and a big can of chicken broth.  Finally, the lamb riblet appetizer was like the anti McRib--nine tiny rib bones laden with thick, juicy, tender pieces of lamb meat glistening in a simple herb and olive oil marinade.

It's so huge that the hostess insisted she walk me across the entire restaurant to where the elevator was so I could take it down to the restroom. \n\nWe started with the Kolokithokeftethes (crispy zucchini cakes with cucumber & mint-yogurt dressing) and the Aginares Souvlaki (grilled artichokes & eggplant skewer with greek yogurt). Two thick zucchini cakes that tasted lovely on their own without the mint-yogurt dressing. One skewer grilled to perfection demolished in about 30 seconds and had us saying, \"Winner winner chicken dinner.\"\n\nFor the main course I had to try the Arnisia Paidakia (grilled lamb chops with a lemon-oregano vinaigrette & kokkari potatoes $31) which is supposedly one of the more popular dishes. Boyfriend had the Kotopoulo Souvlas (lemon-oregano chicken with roasted onions & kokkari potatoes). The Galaktoboureko (semolina custard in filo with apricot spoon sweet & pistachio ice cream $8) was the only thing on the menu that I even attempted to pronounce and wound up being our favorite thing that night. When we broke into that Greek eggroll-looking dessert and tasted the semolina custard we both looked at each other and said simultaneously, \"That is so damn good!\" You know it's good when you take a bite of something, your mouth is full, but you keep making jabs in the air with the utensil in hand.

I went here for the first time on a recent visit to SF and brought a big group.  We were originally going to be 8 people, then I changed it that day to 5, then we ended up being 10.  When we arrived twice as big as I had told them, they didn't sweat it at all and were very accomodating.  The waiter was amazing and very helpful.  He explained everything on the menu to us and after we discussed for a bit, I just let him order for the table.  As our first appetizers were coming out, 2 more friends showed up unexpectedly, and started socializing with us and eating off our table.  Any other 5 star restaurant of Kokkari's stature, would have made a fuss..but the wait staff was amazing accomodating...offering our friends a table nearby us.  We were actually able to squeeze them in to our table and grew to 12!  The food was FANTASTIC.\n\nI especially loved the fried cheese and the chicken.  It was all very fresh and clearly authentic and high quality ingredients...these guys know what they are doing.  I would go back in a heartbeat.

I don't repeat that often and given the number of times I've been to Kokkari it certainly merits as one of my favorite restaurants in SF. Kokkari has the combination of beautiful, relaxed, comfortable, great service, and great Mediterranean food that works for me over and over again. Today we had roasted octopus (very fresh, perfectly cooked) and another starter of olives and feta (and the feta was actually GOOD - so often bitter and salty) - and then I had the whole roasted branzino, served with a nice pile of cooked greens and a little tureen of EVOO-based sauce. The fish was so tasty that it didn't need any sort sauce, but it was nice to have anyhow, and again the fish was *perfect*. Branzino is so good it's hard to totally fuck up, but this was so nicely done, I even ate the skin. Greek coffee to finish is a nice changeup from espresso. \n\nPart of what I like about Kokkari is that the cuisine is very much Mediterranean (great fish, seafood, lamb, plenty of veggies, lots of olive oil) minus the pasta focus and plus a little more of a savory/spicy kick that you'd get with Italian, for example. This is the kind of food that I make myself (not nearly as well), and could eat every day. \n\nGreat place especially for a business lunch or dinner, or a special date or birthday, but I'd go back any time. Never fails, super solid place, let's hope they stick around for a long time.", "author": "Bowen D."}

Before he asked for entrees, he awkwardly ran away.   Then the Zucchini cakes.  He was kind enough to serve each of us our cakes, by tossing them on our plates.  Then he continued to plop the yogurt dressing.  So by this time, I thought it was funny and started to giggle.  Which possibly made him nervous and then he dropped cucumber slices on the table and left without cleaning it up at all.\nIt ended with him asking if I wanted coffee.  After reading about the smancy Greek coffee machine, of course I wanted coffee.  He once again ran away.  I was able to catch him  to tell him that I wanted it sweetened since he never asked.  And he responded with 'oh.. you wanted Greek coffee' , well my bad for thinking otherwise. For 5 bucks, half a cup of espresso with sludge on the bottom.  SOO not worth it.  Maybe a larger cup would help justify it.\n\nPerhaps I had very high expectations of this restaurant.  I have been wanting to go for the past 4 years.  It was disappointing and no way worth it.  Maybe I went on a bad night.  Maybe the poor service tricked my tastebuds.\n\nHumus platter - the cucumber  sauce is the same as the zucchini cakes, eggplant one wasn't so good, cod roe -mMM salty humus\nZucchini Cakes- think falafel with zucchini.\nRoasted Eggplant and Artichokes - Very nicely done.\nMoussaka -  It reminded me of a cheesy pumpkin pie made with eggplant.

LUV this salad\nEntrees (Kirio Piato):\nThalasina - pan roasted fillet of white fish with olive tapende...found a but salty. even took off the skin but still a little too salty for my taste.\nArnisia Paidakia - lamb chops w/ lemon & oregano..okay it's hard to go wrong with chops. YUM! had 2 pieces =)\nMakaronia me Horta - ravioli of greens & feta w/ artichokes & roasted Greek peppers....not a fan. again too salty (am i getting old?)\nDessert (Glyka): \nBaklava - traditional walnut & honey baklava w/ vanilla-praline ice cream....oh. my. god. SO delish. prefect ending in my mouth! \n\nI would def come back to try the other dishes.", "author": "Alice C."}

But the food at Kokkari is just average... can get a better Greek meal at just about any good home style Greek place and for a fraction of the price. Most of the other items are typical steakhouse fare with a slight Greek twist. Sure it was Friday night, but the service was distracted and rather poor considering the fanciness ratio.

Simple flavors, seasoned extremely well and executed consistently.  Every time I cheat on Chiaroscuro and come to Kokkari for lunch, whatever I norder tastes exactly the same as it did the previous time.\n\nBest things on the menu (in my opinion): the lamb and chicken souvlaki are to die for.  The moussaka is also outstanding.  As an appetizer, go with the zucchini cakes.\n\nThis place is always completely packed at both lunch and dinner.  The restaurant winds around all the way to the back, and is deceptively larger than you would expect.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-04", "description": "One word describes Kokkari:FRAUD.  My husband and I and another couple were there last night for dinner.  This is a \"Greek\" restaurant which has only one brand of retsina on its wine list.  With the exception of the  fried zucchini flowers, all of the dishes we had (about 16 various ones from appetizers to deserts) were either excessively accommodated to and reconfigured for American tastes (e.g., galaktoboureko with pineapple and coconut;ouzo sorbet;rice pudding the consistency of paste, etc.)  and/ or very poorly prepared (e.g., overdone, undrained, tasteless greens; greasy, rubbery smelts; dry, stinky, tasteless fish--both main course varieties; overly-spiced lamb shank with overdone, overly-spiced orzo, etc., etc., etc.) .  This is certainly not authentic Greek food by any stretch of the imagination.  Moreover, the prices for these faux Hellenic delicacies were absurdly high considering the poor quality of the fare.  It is our opinion that this establishment is of the trendy, vacuous variety, an evening's amusement for the very naive and pretentious;a popular stage on which to see and be seen,  a in short, a social scene pretending to be a restaurant.   It makes one both angry and ashamed to be a Greek.   Shame on the owners, if they are Greeks, which I frankly doubt.  They are certainly taking the San Francisco eating public for a ride.", "author": "Maria S."}

Everything on their menu tastes amazing, the waiters are all very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive, oh, and did I mention the food is amazing? \n\nWell, all good things must come to an end, I suppose.  My last visit to this restaurant was beyond bad, it actually sent me to the doctor's office.  My friend was in town and treating me to dinner.  Naturally, I picked my fave restaurant.  We sat down, and began munching on their delicious bread.  Their bread basket is fabulous, with a variety of breads and always warm.  WARNING: do not eat the bread.  Kokkari has a big fireplace where there's a bread station and you can see loaves of bread piled up and being cut to be brought to tables.  Well, we were seated right next to this fireplace, and I saw my waiter bring our bread basket, which was still half full, place the bread into another basket, and then serve it to another table.  STRIKE 1, plus 1, plus 1...\n\nThe food we ordered was fabulous as always.  I highly recommend their fried cheese dish.  No, it is not like mozzarella sticks from TGI Fridays.  It is this amazing pan fried blend of cheeses that just melts in your mouth.  \n\nLong story short, we returned home from dinner around 10 p.m.  Around 1 a.m., I was asleep on the bathroom floor from all the vomiting, and by the next day, I was at the doctor's office who took me off work for THREE DAYS for what she said was a very severe case of food poisoning.  \n\nWill I go back, probably.

The last time I was there it was a Friday and the special was a papakutzi (Greek spelling is clearly not a skill I have!).  It was a twice baked eggplant with lamb, tomatoes & spices baked, covered with a yogurt bechamel and then baked again.  Really good!!\n\nThey have a lot of yummy appetizers - you can make a full meal with just those!  I don't like fish, so didn't have any of the fried smelts, but my friends loved them.  I did love the garlic-potato spread that came with them though (I can't remember the name of it - starts with a \"s\").  I kept stealing it off the plate :)  I love the dips you can get with the fresh pita bread - so tasty - you get to choose three from six possibilities.  The beet salad with feta was really good and I'm not even a big beet fan (sort of take them or leave them).  My friends also loved the calimari and the octopus appetizers too.\n\nTheir wine list is great as well, a lot of choices in reasonable price ranges.  Of course ouzo is available as well - can't take the taste but love the smell.  The flourless chocolate cake is fab and so is the phyllo filled with lemon curd.  And the Greek coffee?  Soooo goooood!!!  Can't wait to go back!!", "author": "Jocelyn D."}

It was really dark there and lacked the buzz of the other two rooms.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share - thought hummus (must try, very different from other restaurants) with pita and lamb riblets were the best. Lamb chops were good but chicken souvlaki was awesome!  We shared fudge sundae and baklava with praline ice cream - both very yummy.  I would definitely order the baklava again as it was fresh, full of walnuts and not too sweet.  Ones in the stores can be very syrupy, tooth achingly sweet.

Kokkari is such a worthwhile experience. Our waiter, Chris, was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and guided us to tapas style dining. We loved the kolokithokeftethes (crispy squash cakes with cucumber), kalamari (grilled calamari stuffed with feta et al.), arnisia glossa souvlaki (grilled lamb tongue!) and the taramosalata with grilled pita.

They brought over the sommelier and I told him what our price range was.  He recommended an amazing bottle of wine from France (as I remember) and it was actually $20 more then what I said but he really thought we would enjoy it (and it was their last bottle) and he gave it to me for $20 less!

Possibly because of all the great reviews I read about the place. Our server was in the weeds when we were seated so it took a while for us to get our bottle of wine that we ordered. I get very antsy when I'm waiting for my first drink! The food was good - especially the grilled squid but other than that dish I thought the rest was just OK. The potatoes were tasty but they needed a sauce or some tasty salt on them. The flatbread was good but I can get pizza anywhere and that's basically what it was. My husband had the lamb riblets and he did not enjoy them. They were cooked well-done and not to his liking. Maybe that's just his taste but he still didn't care for them. The shrimp with feta had good flavor but the shrimp were a bit overcooked. I did like dipping the bread in the sauce that the shrimp was in though. I don't know if it was an oversight but the bread came out without any butter or dip. The bread was good and worked well with the shrimp sauce but I just thought it was strange.\nOne thing that I found particularly annoying was that the busboys kept trying to clear all the plates before we were through.

I'm thinking every item on the menu is delicious. The mezethes (appetizers/small plates) are over abundant, but don't get overwhelmed - i bet all of them are great. This last time we tried the special 'duck dolmathes' - duck with pine nuts, rice, currants wrapped in grape leaves and the spanakotiropita - filo pie filled with spinach and feta. Both were amazing. There are so many other interesting small plates that I almost wish we would have tried something other than the filo pie....perhaps the Kalamari - grilled calamari stuffed with feta, fennel & orange with black olives. The filo was wonderful don't get me wrong, but it's a pretty traditional greek food. For the entree I had the moussaka. I can't get enough of it...I had it the first time around and even tried to make it at home. The home version was pretty good, but nothing compared to kokkari's rich and delightful blend of lamb, eggplants, potato & creamy bechamel sauce. Yum! Be prepared it is very very filling. So filling that it almost makes you want to skip dessert until you see the dessert menu. You'll definitely want something light like the Galaktoboureko,  custard in filo with warm quince &  lemon-sage ice cream. The quince was a little too sweet for my taste, but the overall flavors mixed very well! A few other things - great wine list and very cozy atmosphere with a lovely fire place in the middle of the room.", "author": "Samira S."}

To start, we ordered the zuchinni cakes and the grilled octopus.  Zuchinni cakes (one \"cake\" each) with the yogurt dressing was delish!  Mmmmm I wanted more!  I think I had high expectations for the grilled octopus because of everyone else's reviews but I honestly thought it was nothing spectacular.  It was good but nothing new to my taste buds.  I ordered the rib-eye for my entree and it was cooked the way I wanted.  It was seasoned well and also nice and juicy (ordered medium rare).  I had to take home half of it because it was a pretty big portion.  Bf ordered the rotisserie lamb.  We saw it cooking in the fireplace and I didn't think it tasted like how it was being cooked (i don't know if that makes sense).  I thought it lacked a little flavor (maybe because I was comparing it to my rib-eye) and needed some kind of seasoning or sauce with it.  It tasted more like it was a boiled piece of meat and not a rotisserie.  He ate it all so must've been somewhat good.  But then again he's not really picky with his food.  For dessert we ordered the Sokolatina (flourless chocolate cake).  OMG it was sooo good!  My favorite dessert.  It's a definite must have after your meal.  Kokkari is a definite go back restaurant on my list.  Next time I go, I will try the lamb chops and see if it lives up to everyone's high marked reviews.  I'm in between 3 and 4 stars right now because the rotisserie lamb didn't really wow me.  We shall see if they get another star when I go back and try something new on the menu.", "author": "ana a."}

It's a warm and cozy feel with great food selections!  They used to have a great beat salad app, but it hasn't been offered in a while.  Since then I've resorted to taking on their fried smelt, zuchinni cakes or grilled octopus to start off my meal.  For the entree I've only tried a few dishes they offer (not a lamb or feta fan) but always hear rave reviews from my fellow diners in my party.  My usual would be the whole fish they have on special or the artichoke souvlaki (grilled artichokes & eggplant skewers with Greek yogurt & housemade pita).  Sounds like it's not filling but it's actually perfect and grilled perfectly.  Been here a bunch of times for both lunch AND dinner.  I always reccomend people give it a whirl.

The eggplant was fabulous and the other two were definitely tasty.  We went with the whole fish specials for dinner -- dorado (aka branzino) for me, petrale sole for him.  I had mine roasted, and it came swimming in olive oil, along with some roasted potatoes and olives.  (Some people may think this is a bad thing; I thought it was brilliant.)

The waiter was quite nice and helpful with suggestions -- although he kept forcing me to make an attempt at pronouncing the dishes.  My dining partner had the lamb chops and they were cooked to perfection and so tender.  YUM! As I said before, my moussaka was amazing.  The portion was so huge I only at about a quarter of it -- the leftovers to be savored at a later date.  Although we were both stuffed, we could not pass up on dessert and ordered the apple tart with fig ice cream.  I was wishing for a second stomach when this came around and was disappointed that I couldn't eat more of it.

Buried away from the hussle and bustle of the financial district and the abundance of tourists, this restaurant is quietly situated across from apartment complex and park near Embarcadero. The decor is very old fashioned and comfortable yet elegant. Even though the restaurant can be loud, you are still able to have conversations without having to strain your voice. The service is superb and the dishes are just to die for. Instead of ordering the usual calamari for appetizers, opt for the grilled octopus. It's just as great, if not better! My other favorite appetizer is the Kolokithokeftethes -- crab cakes with yogurt. Another favorite :) Although I am not much of a fan for meat, the Moussaka is what the restaurant is best known for. And of course, a good meal is never great without wine and dessert. Everything on the dessert menu is creme de la creme!!

I have a feeling that even without these things, our meal would've been great, but I had to warn you. Anyway, the must tries on this menu are their sampler of appetizers, which usually includes the tzatziki that i can't stop eating, as well some other dips that are yummy, but not enough to make me divert my attention from the tzatziki. The signature lamb chops are a favorite with my husband. I tend to just order more appetizers for my entree - with yummies like spanakopita, fried zucchini blossoms and eggplant cakes, why force yourself to choose?

A little noisy(lunch) but not the worst I've seen & I don't mind it too much as long as people can her you without screaming too much.  It can be a bit pricey on your own dime(lotsa bus. lunch/dinners here).  But \"It's Greek\" so it not like eating Filet Mignon - it's not so bad so spend the coin and enjoy.  Go for anything lamb for dinner cuz it's the place for lamb & they do-it-up right.  The mousaka is also very good and their deserts(try the greek yogurt, candied walnuts, dates, and honey) are even better.  the food rates 5 out of 5 for greek food and I'd say 4 out of 5 for all foods - I may be a little biased.  If you're not too peckish, all you, \"eat like a bird\" eaters, could easily fill-up on the hummus & veggies or fried cheese appetizers among the many others.  The deco is fabulous and worth a bar drink visit in itself.  It's kinda the old style southern mexican, adobe, craftsman, big-wood & sandy ceramic look... or basically, it's just how you'd want your favorite mexican(or greek I guess) party hideout to look.  Even the bathrooms are tastefully done.  It's a great place to relax, unwind & take-in a different environment with a friend or two after a crazy S.F. day.  The wait staff is outstanding as well as the bartenders(they knew all my favorites drinks & had all my favorite alchohols); I'm an x-tender so that impresses me.  Our bartender even asked if he could serve us food at the bar!.. not just drinks! - bartenders usually hate serving food(present company included) at their bars!\").  Appetizers at the bar are a great way to fill-up and still stay hip with the crowd - lots of socializing going-on here.  Kokkari seems to get a large \"Bix\" overflow & vise versa on busy nights.

I made the reservation through opentable.com and when the restaurant called to confirm, the reservationist followed up on my note that it was a special occasion by asking the name of the bday guest and whether we wanted anything special done.  The waiter was super attentive and friendly and the table was regularly checked for water, empty plates, etc.  The food came out quickly and everything was quite delicious. Not the best I've ever eaten, but all well prepared and seasoned.  We all split a few appetizers including the zucchini cakes, skewered veggies, and pita and dip platter.  All very good (esp. the dip platter, really yummy tzatziki)  We all got the evening's rotisserie which is not usually what I'm into (not so much a meat from a spit kinda girl) but it was very tender and not too fatty.  We got the flourless chocolate cake and fruit gratinee with yogurt ice cream for dessert which were both really delicious.  (plus it came with a candle and happy bday on the plate which is always nice).  Also, we were seated near the enterance and the maitre'd Dmitri chatted with us several times through the course of our meal.  He was really friendly and brought us a complimentary round of Greek dessert wine at the end of our meal which was really delicious.  They also comped the dessert because it was a bday celebration.

We started with an appetizer of lamb riblettes as accompanied by a green salad with red wine vinaigrette. Although I usually steer clear of vinaigrette's as a result of the poor balsamic versions I had had previously, the dressing was light and tossed with the shredded lettuces with a delicate hand. The surprise came from the feta cheese that was crumbled throughout, as opposed to chunked on top. I had had a version of the lamb riblettes in Hong Kong, which I didn't like because the meat was laced in fat. Kokkari's came much better proportioned and less greasy. Lamb riblettes differ from the ribs in that there is much less actual meat on the bone. The skin is grilled to a crisp whereupon under it, you find visible layers of meat, fat, and miscellaneous others. The riblettes were marinated in a wonderfully fragrant olive oil, which I greedily sopped up with my olive bread. We repeated our success at LuLu's by opting for the whole grilled branzino. The fish came filleted with the skin on. Although the fish was moist, what really stood out was the natural sweetness of the meat--a rarity in Western cooking. We were a bit disappointed in the Kokkari potatos, but only because I had expected them whole and roasted, when they were actually baked like french fries. They also veered on being too salty. Desserts was compelling and catered to my preference for light flavors. I was crossed between the rhubarb soup + passion fruit sorbet and the yogurt sorbet with blood orange granita and mint syrup--I settled for the latter and was delighted with my choice. The Greek yogurts are strikingly similar to their Vietnamese counterparts, which are made from condensed milk. This leads to a much more balanced flavor with a mild tartness that is mitigated by sweet undertones. I will have to come back to try out the more adventurous dishes before arriving at a final decision..", "author": "Monica T."}

I'd had a fabulous experience the other three times--great food (especially the lamb chops!), great service, great atmosphere. Hadn't been back for two or three years, but decided to go there for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend. Not a good idea as it turned out--the food wasn't great and the service was quite frightening. \n\nI always think it's strange when restaurant reviews talk mostly about the service, but we eat out a LOT and have never had such an intrusive dining experience. It completely colored the whole evening. I'm not sure whether it was the location of the table or if this is just how Kokkari is these days. \n\nWe were seated at a booth in the hallway between the two main rooms, which at first seemed nice and cozy, away from the hustle and bustle. But we soon realized that we were in waiter central--literally dozens of waiters walking past at every moment. We could have dealt with this, but it was indicative of the whole dining experience: during the meal we counted at least 10 different servers fussing over our table, to the point where we simply couldn't relax and enjoy the meal. To top it off, though they were courteous, none had an iota of friendliness or humanity about them--it's as if they were instructed never to smile or have any sort of connection with those they were serving. Very strange. \n\nThe appetizers arrived almost instantly after we ordered them (which at first we were delighted with, because who doesn't like fast service?), but as soon as a plate looked even the least bit empty someone would try to remove it (without asking if we were finished, which we weren't, and had to tell them so before they ran off with it). It was hard to enjoy eating when we would continually be interrupted by people moving plates around, filling water glasses, etc.--every minute or two someone would be stopping by, and we were afraid they'd take something away that we still wanted. It felt like they were trying to get us out of there as quickly as possible.\n\nThree servers were somehow needed to deliver our two entrees. Thankfully, after that no one came by at all (not even to ask how our entrees were, which is lesson number one in Waitstaff 101) until we were completely finished the entrees. It was only then we could try to enjoy our food, but both of us felt hassled and stressed out by then.\n\nIf the food had been mind-blowing, we probably could have just laughed off the bizarre service. But it was just mediocre. We had the meatball, calamari, and Greek salad appetizers, and the lamb chops and chicken entrees. Meatballs were pretty good, calamari was weird with liquid-cheese center, and Greek salad was uber-basic, with a rather tasteless dressing I could have made myself (Greek dressing is an art!) and really bland tomatoes. Boyfriend said the chicken was fantastic, and we both agreed that the potatoes were pretty good, but the lamb chops--the reason I'd gone to Kokkari in the first place, even though they are $10 each!--were just all right. They did give us a free dessert for my birthday, which was very nice--but before i knew that surprise was coming, the waiter took my napkin from where it was laying on the booth and picked it up and put it in my lap, which frankly I found a bit offensive (what if there were dirt on one side and it ended up on my dress?). I guess we all have different notions of \"good service.\"\n\nI don't think I'll be going back to Kokkari.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-22", "description": "Mmm, I love Kokkari.  Just about every year I go to visit my dad in Greece and Kokkari is about as close as you can get to the real thing here without cooking it yourself.  I always recommend sticking to the mezethes (greek tapas) at Kokkari or at the sister restaurant in Palo Alto, Evvia.  They are definitely more like what you'd get in a restaurant in Greece.  The dolmathes (grape leaves stuffed with pine nuts and currants) were ok, but a bit bland. . . . ultimately, not as good as my mom's.  The horiatiki (greek salad) is consistently the best I've ever had and often better than in Greece---Kokkari finds the tastiest tomatoes.  The xortakopita/spanakopita has the perfect balance of greens and feta.  And the lamb is very flavorful and delicious for american lamb.  The octopus was pretty damn good, crunchy little suckers!  I didn't have it this time but their pita is so fluffy that you should try ordering the tzatziki, taramosalata, etc.  Dessert is just ok here.  I think their galaktoboureko (semolina custard wrapped in phyllo) could be better with a little orange zest and grand marnier in the custard.  Service was warm, attentive, and pleasant.  The atmosphere was sophisticated but rustic with older wealthy people surrounding you for one of their many meals out that week . . .  I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Elena S."}

You may ask yourself how someone can say two places are 'the best', when that is supposed to be saved as an adjective for something that is more superior than all others. Well, chances are that I should go back & change that review, but it really is fantastic and so is Kokkari. This is a huge step up from Mezes, this place is the swank, you come here on an anniversary, for a corporate lunch, for a group dinner if you have the dough. Mezes is where you go with friends for good food at more modest prices. Kokkari is an experience, it's lush and warm - that is how I'd explain the decor, food AND service. hands down one of the best dining experiences in town. Sometimes I think that there aren't chefs in the kitchen but little Greek grandmothers. Plus you can have your coffee grounds read after, so it's not all stuffy, you see?", "author": "Colleen B."}

I have never been so impressed by service before.   Well, first, let's start with the food.  It was stellar.  The octopus was so delightful.  I went with my Greek friend who was returning to Europe in a few days, so we decided to just order everything we wanted and take the leftovers home (which was probably more than we actually ate there).  Thanks to a friend of a friend, they squeezed us in for a last minute reservation on a bustling Thursday night.  And we were fortunate enough to get one of the tables for two in the front with the big, super comfy, cushy chairs!  I loved that part.  And then we ordered about half the menu.  heh.   Everything was delicious, even the brains!  I also highly recommend one of the dips (any of them).  My Greek friend was quite impressed with a lot of food too, so that's got to be good, no?  The wine's were delicious and they have a pretty good wine list.  But back to the service.  It started with the wonderful maitre d', friendly, professional, intelligent.  And our server was so friendly and helpful.  But the thing that impressed me most was how they served the food.  I told you that we ordered a lot (we were there almost 4 hours total) and they spaced everything out so seamlessly.  I didn't even really think about it until we left, but it really was amazing how they managed our entire meal.  I never felt rushed, but we also never felt neglected.    They seemed to ALWAYS know just the perfect time to bring the next dish out. And our server, what a wonderful man, wish I could remember his name, also started talking about some dish that apparently Greek's love (at least my friend got SUPER excited about it) and it wasn't on the menu so he went and checked to see if the kitchen could make.  They could.  Of course.   If I remember correctly, their dessert wine list left a little to be desired, but who cares at that point.  What a wonderful night.  I would recommend this place to everyone.  It's not cheap, but it was more than worth it.  I think they're setting the bar on service.

I was simply amazed at the attention to detail.  The ambiance at night is a bit to quite for my tastes, but it is a classy place (or as classy as it can be for having a roasting spit in the middle of the restaurant).

Trying the spreads is a must, but you also must get the octopus, spinach filo, zucchini cakes and everything else.  They offer a lot of vegetarian options.  The only warning is that the food is very heavy, don't plan an industrious afternoon after a meal here. I recommend making a complete meal out of appetizers and a bottle of wine.", "author": "Christina F."}

It is no joke when people say Kokkari makes sure their customers leave happy! My pork chop was a bit over-cooked and I mentioned it to the waiter. He quickly took my plate and offered me a glass of wine on the house. He then returned with my new pork chop 5 minutes later. It was great...maybe a little undercooked this time, but he took my meal off our check! The food was wonderful! We have already set the date to have our Holiday Party here this year!", "author": "Tamra B."}

Of course I was given a $100.00 certificate so that covered a 1/3 of our bill which came to almost $200.00.   I found the service to be excellent.  The waiter was very knowledageable of the wines.  We had the Smelt, the Grilled Meatballs, the Lamb Sweetbreads, the Octupus appetizers was out of this world and the fried cheese.  All 5 Star.   But the entree I had was the Mousakka.  Was not impressed.  It is like they just dumped good meat in a small dish and added a ton cinnamon and topped it with instant mashed potatoes  I have had Mousakka prior in Greece, and what I had at Kokkari comes nothing close to the real stuff.  I know the woman that was sitting in the table next to me complained that her chicken wasn't good, it was dry and had no taste.  I noticed she ate very little of it.  For the price its expensive.  Go for the appetizers, they were fantastic! But as far as the entrees, not sure if I would order one again.  My 2 friends shared their entrees with me and I found the lamb chop just 'ok' I can do better at home  and the fish, that too was just 'ok'.  That I what happens when you get non-greeks making greek food.  They should stick to tacos.", "author": "Unemployed A."}
