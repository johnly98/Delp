High quality ban chan - fish cakes are bomb.\n\n2. Very efficient service.\n\n3 Their soon du bu (tofu soup) is on point. This is my favorite Korean dish and always order it at every Korean restaurant I go to. After trying Manna's soon du bu, I'm happy to say it is definitely one of the best in the Bay Area (the other one I recommend is tofu house in Palo Alto). The flavors are very authentic, and it's just the right amount of salt and spice (some places over do the salt). Get medium spice and with beef.\n\n4 Other things to get include seafood pancake, spicy wings, and dol sot bibimbap. \n\nThere is usually a wait on weekends, so would recommend going during the week. Your party must be present to be seated.", "author": "Lizzie F."}

Maybe it was the places we went, but Manna won hands down. Unlike other places in SF, Manna seems to put the right blend of veggies, a delicious crispy bottom and tasty chicken ( yes I get chicken in mine). We also love their tofu soup, which I have them make with water and chicken since I don't eat beef or pork. Their banchan also has a good mix of flavors and I find myself eating most of them and asking for more. \n\nThe service is usually pretty great too, with yummy hot tea to get you started. There is almost always a line and you have to ask for water, but other than that, 5 stars!", "author": "Kat M."}

I mean she wasn't driving, but we ended up in the Inner Sunset two days in a row. \n\nThere were a few people ahead of us as we were quoted 15 - 20 minutes wait time....which was approximately just about right. The menu is right underneath a glass cover on the table, a brilliant way to prevent sticky icky menus. The server immediately gave us two glasses of water as we got seated down.\n\nWifey decided to order the Beef Bulgogi while I chose the Stone Pot Bibimbop and a side of Sweet & Spicy KFC to share. While the glass of water was a nice touch and appreciated, we also requested hot tea for both of us. Their Banchan came after and it was a nice selection of the usual suspects. Nothing to scram about, but it was good.\n\nWe received the KFC first and it wasn't as advertised. It definitely was sweet, but not spicy. In fact, the sauce was uber sweet and overpowered the entire thing. It was almost like eating candied chicken wings...which is not my thing. \n\nThen my Bimbimbop came and dismayed to see the yolk of the egg was overcooked. I mean, what's the purpose of having an egg on top if I can't mix the entire thing with the yolk oozing to blend together? The hot stone pot created a nice crust on the rice though, but it was missing that punch that only an egg yolk could provide. \n\nWifey's Beef Bulgogi was pretty OK, but it was also more on the sweet side. Thank god for the kimchi to break the monotony of sweet on sweet and ordered another side of it. \n\nOverall, nothing wowed us and nothing stood out. It was just run-of-the-mill Korean food, with good and friendly service.", "author": "John G."}

For some odd reason, we decided not to do family style, so naturally, I ended up with an entire plate of Korean chicken wings to myself. I typically would never do this...but I really had a hankering for wings that night. Needless to say, I polished off the ENTIRE plate of sweet and spicy chicken wings and had no regrets. \n\nManna has been in constant rotation ever since. I come here about twice a year and always come early since they don't take reservations. The place isn't that big...maybe around 30 people max can fit and there's usually a wait by the time 6pm rolls around. Reasonable prices, a no frills atmosphere, and a well rounded menu that isn't overwhelming. The dishes are tasty and authentic, but still welcoming for those who are unfamiliar with Korean food. \n\nBesides the chicken wings, the kal bi, bbq spicy pork, kimchi fried rice, and seafood pancake are my go-to orders. The dol-sot bibimbap is also one of the best I've had because they get that stone pot so darn hot! It actually crisps the rice up, which is a rare occurrence.

The restaurant itself is pretty small but works in their favor since the size and structure of the place felt like eating homemade food out of someone's kitchen. Tables are very close together, so be prepared to get cozy with your neighbors.\n\nThe cashier/service counter where the waiters pick up food from the kitchen faces the floor so it is easy to hail anyone if you need help (or need refills on banchan... my favorite and much too often problem). \n\nGet the dolsot bibimbap, which comes in a sizzling hot stone pot. You can get pork/chicken/seafood/tofu as the meat options and with a beautiful sunnyside fried egg on top.

Had them for the first time recently and they came out piping hot, in a delicious sweet soy sauce glaze, with a perfectly crispy outside (which stayed this way even after it had been sitting in the sauce for a while). Definitely getting this every time I come here now. \n\n#9 - Dol-Sot Bibimbap - There are many other Korean dishes I would prefer over bibimbap, so I don't order this often and don't know how it compares to other places. But my parents like this here, as do many other Yelpers apparently.\n\n#13 - Seafood Soft Tofu Soup - We were asked how spicy we wanted this and were given the options of no spice, mild, medium, and spicy. When asked anywhere else, I usually order a medium, but we decided to get the mild this time. HOLY CRAP it's spicy for mild! Bearable, and still delicious, but the mild here is spicier than the \"medium\" level at other places, such as Dae Jang Geum Tofu House. \n\n#27 - Seafood Korean Pancake - I usually order this item with caution at Korean restaurants, because there is the tendency to put in too much batter, making the pancake too thick and starchy. Not the case here. This is the best seafood pancake I've ever had. Light and crispy with a generous portion of seafood, yum. My dad loves the sauce that comes with this too. \n\nThe small dishes here don't have much variety, but taste is definitely on point (broccoli, fish cake, shredded potato, kimchi, bean sprouts). Service is decent and water is refilled often. Parking is kind of difficult in this area because there are so many good options for food. We usually look for at least 15-20 minutes, but I'd say it's totally worth it. The restaurant is small, so we almost always have to wait - half an hour this time (Thursday at 7pm).

Seemed like a small sort of authentic Korean place which is different for us.  As an aside, wtf is up with all the \"asian\" places in the Sunset being so busy every night.  My theory is that they have good street cred due to actual dudes from country in question making stuff in the back.  Which is a good argument, it's authentic.  But in the 80s/90s when I lived here before nobody gave a f.  Also it was much foggier, I swear.\n\nManna is a small place with a limited menu. I like that.  They don't try to do everything, focus on a few good dishes.  Then they served us water in warm glasses and the water tasted funny.  Finally when our waitress rounded the corner towards us I complained. But it turns out this was on purpose due to it being some sort of tea.  My bad.\n\nI ordered a soup of some kind.  I took a picture but it's been awhile so i don't remember what.  But is was super hot to the point that it was boiling.  That's good soup in my book.\n\nWe also got about five or six little plates of Korean side dishes like Kim Chee and other stuff.

Now that the friend doesn't live there, and I have to look for real parking UGHHH, it's shitty ppl. Like horrible beyond belief. Inner sunset has got to be one of the worst areas to find parking...at most hours of the day...esp for restaurants around this area. THEN, on top of that, the wait at Manna is sometimes crazier. If you're looking to skip the lines, come before 5:30 (any night) or after 8. It's a small, small spot. The bathroom is like an airplane bathroom!! As for the staff, they're nice ish. Sometimes hard to get their attn, but they are dealing w lots of takeout orders at the same time. \n\nBut onto the food. Banchans are fairly tiny serving sizes here and there are a limited number in variety, but you've got the good ol basics here (more than the four you get in My Tofu House in Richmond...). I ALWAYS order the seafood soondubu here. There's never any variances. Not unless I'm also ordering the seafood pancake, which I haven't gotten in a while. If you're getting the Tofu stew, ask for an egg. They apparently don't hand them out like hot cakes here. Gotta ask!! Remember!! \n\nOverall, still a solid 4 experience. So 4 it is!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

But that's my fault for not venturing out into the (Inner) Sunset more.\n\nManna is a pretty small Korean restaurant, so either come at an off hour or expect to wait. I wouldn't recommend coming with a large group. Good for 2 people, 4 people would be doable, but any more would be a squeeze. My friend and I stopped by during lunch hour on a Tuesday and luckily, there was one table for 2 open for us.\n\nService is quick here. Honestly a little too quick because we had sat down for maybe a minute and hadn't looked at the menu yet before the waitress came by asking if we were ready. It felt a little rushed but at least they were also attentive about refilling our tea and banchan when we asked.\n\nTheir menu has a large variety of Korean dishes: bibimbap, tofu soup and other soups, meat like bulgogi and kalbi, noodles, rice cakes and more. Lunch specials average around $10, while most dishes on their normal menu are still around $10-14. Not bad given the portion, quality and taste.\n\n* BANCHAN (complimentary) - 4/5\nTheir banchan spread was somewhat limited compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to, but everything tasted good. The kimchi was kind of sweet rather than strong, fermented quality kimchi. There was also broccoli, bean sprouts, potato strips and fish cake, all of which were pretty normal.\n\n* DAKDORITANG ($9.99) - 4.5/5\n[chicken stew w/ mixed vegetable in spicy sauce]\nNot a soup despite the \"tang\" and despite the \"stew\" in the description, which was a little disappointing because a spicy chicken stew sounded really good to me. The waitress did mention that it's not a stew but I ordered it anyway and thought it was delicious. So much sauce, so much flavor! It wasn't super spicy but had some heat to it. The chicken was cooked with zucchini and potatoes, and I ended up adding the broccoli and bean sprouts from the banchan for some more veggies and to soak up the sauce.", "author": "Jessie L."}

But still pretty satisfying. \n\nDumpling soup was great! It's been a while since I had it but I do remember loving it. \n\nSoy sauce wings were good. The sweet spicy ones were even better!

The place is very small and it can get very loud.\n\nMy friend and I ordered a kimchi fried rice, rice cake, sweet & spicy chicken and a japchae.\n\nKimchi fried rice- I've never had it with cucumber or whatever the green stuff was so I was surprised by it. The flavor didn't make a huge impact on me because it honestly tasted like any other kimchi fried rice but with more oil in it. The oil made the rice a bit soggy but it was still alright, somehow. I don't think I'll order this dish again.\n\nRice cake- my friend and I ate a couple of the rice cakes and then stopped because it was a lil bit spicy lol but this dish was alright. The rice cake was very chewy and it was super flavorful!\n\nSour spicy chicken- oh lord! No wonder why this chicken is so popular in here! The combination of both sweet and spicy felt like I was tasting heaven. I really liked it.\n\nJapchae- I got this to-go for my boyfriend. I forgot to ask him for feedback but he finished his japchae at the speed of light so I think it's self explanatory LOL\n\nOverall, this place was alright. I had super high expectations on this place because all my friends liked/rec it but I was just a bit disappointed by the kimchi fried rice. Next time I'll order the bibimbap and I wanna try the soy sauce chicken! Customer service was super good. A man, I assumed it's the boss, was so funny. I like him", "author": "Kathy D."}

So we yelped other places with chicken wings and found Manna pretty close by. I read they're usually pretty busy inside and we were eating a tad early so thought it'd be a good opportunity to try it plus everywhere else seemed to not open until 5pm the earliest.  The pictures of banchan fish cake and KFC on the menu also sold us.  I didn't ask if the banchan was free refills but we had plans to eat Orenchi Beyond after so we were trying to keep it light.  Ordered the seafood pancake and KFC. I think the pancake needed the sesame sauce they give you and it was very proportionate with the ingredients and batter.  The KFC was good but I like this place in OC more since they also do all flats with lighter batter. Overall I'd definitely be interested in coming back to try more food.", "author": "Jonathan C."}

It's also a really small restaurant so try to come during off hours.\n\nThe food here is pretty delicious and reasonably priced. This is pretty much my go to Korean restaurant in SF that I go to. Everything is pretty safe to order. I typically get a bibimbap or jabchae noodles. Both are consistently tasty and never disappoint. The small dishes that they provide have changed a lot over the years so these might not be up to date. I love their fishcakes. I can't really think of another restaurant that has better fishcakes. Their sprouts, broccoli, potatoes, and kimchee are fine too. I'm very disappointed that they took out the sweet black beans because they were my favorite after the fish cakes.

We got the dwinjang chige, which is like a bean based soup w/ a little of red pepper sauce. It was surprisingly tasty -- we didn't know what to expect w/ the bean paste base. :O It was savory and tasty, but you might need to be accustomed to the bean-taste ;)\n\nWe also tried the dokboki, but we added ramen into it! It was super yummy, they make the dokboki sauce sweet and spicy here. It's definitely worth a try if you're craving just dokboki but want more carbs/for it to be more filling. \n\nI'm a regular at this place! And the owner always smiles at me with warm greetings :).

Irving Street has a plethora of good restaurant options and so you may skip out on this place, but then you'd feel tremendous regret after reading my review. \n\nManna does a great seafood pancake. Lots of pieces of actual seafood inside the pancake  instead of all batter and green onions. Although, I love green onions actually. Those things are amazing when grilled and eaten in pancake form. The one minus of the pancake is that sometimes, it gets a little oily so eat it fast and forget about how you've just downgraded your health status. Kalbi short ribs are a decent option too if you like being a carnivore. I would say it's your standard fare and similar to other Korean places in the city.  A for the effort here. To round out the meal, I tried their chicken \"stew\", which really wasn't a stew since it didn't come in a pot. Instead, it was served on a plate and that really confused me for a few minutes.  It actually was really tasty since the chicken was tender and the sauce was perfect balanced between sweet and spicy and salty. \n\nI can't review a Korean spot without mentioning the banchan. The selection isn't huge since they only give you like 5 things. However, it's done pretty well regardless of whether they make it in-house or not.  The one standout I would say is the jicama (I think?) that cleanses your palette for more eating! The tea also does the same, which the waitresses refilled pretty often. I noticed it's a popular lunch spot so get their early or you'll be waiting in line.", "author": "Quoc N."}

Chose this place because it was close and convenient. \n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nI got the beef soondubu, which didn't blow me away but hit the spot. I ordered it spicy, because as my Korean friend says, if it ain't spicy, it ain't soondubu. The soup seemed to be more onion than tofu or beef. My friends also ordered soondubu (chicken and seafood) as well as the dolsot bibimbap. The bibimbap was good, nice crispy rice on the bottom, but then again, it's pretty hard to screw up bibimbap. \n\nThe banchan wasn't anything to write home about. They had the basic dishes -- fish cake, kimchi, bean sprouts, broccoli, and shredded potato. My favorites were the shredded potato and the fish cake. \n\n0.5/1  Stars for Value -- \nOK, the price (and selection) of Korean food in SF is just ridiculous. It was $10.99 for most dishes (for dinner), which is decent. I know other places charge over $13 for soondubu, which is just heinous. My tofu did come with rice, but my one qualm is that it didn't come with raw egg. YO. The egg is an integral part of my soondubu experience! \n\nOne of the more ridiculous prices I saw was kalbi for $16.99. Seriously? I'm better off making it at home. Anyways, I would recommend coming to check this place out at lunch time, where the portion sizes are the same but the prices are $2-3 cheaper.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service\nOur waitress was awesome. After she took our orders, she repeated them back to us to make sure there were no mistakes. She kept our hot tea refilled (served in glass cups, what's up with that?), and didn't give us any attitude when we asked for more banchan. \n\nWe were a party of 4, but one of our friends turned up 30 minutes late, while another showed up unexpectedly. The waitress took everything in stride, and even brought over an extra chair for our extra friend. If I had to have one complaint though, I would say that the food service is kind of slow, with dishes coming over 10 minutes apart. Lots of banchan eating while waiting for friends' dishes to arrive.\n\nNo bonus star because I probably wouldn't come back to Manna.

The only gripe that I have is that the Beef in the Bi Bim Bop and the Pork in the Spicy Pork were all in small shreds and not in larger grilled pieces.  Why such small shreds?  Unless you're trying to turn over tables faster and smaller pieces of meat cook faster.  I like to chew , thus give me bigger pieces of meat which I am used to from other Korean restaurants.", "author": "Scott L."}

We had to put a lot of effort flagging someone down for our order, though it was frustrating to see the other tables who came in later having their orders taken in first. \n- One of our dishes came in really late.

It's a small place on the corner of 9th and Irving that seats about 15 people. \n\nBecause of the lack of tables, the wait for Manna is very long. For instance, a party of 2 on a Sunday night at 7:00pm is 1 hour. A part of 2 on a Tuesday night at 7:00pm is 1 hour or more. Because of this, I'd recommend anyone wanting to go to Manna to be prepared for a wait or to come in at more odd hours of the day. \n\nIn terms of food, the quality is great and most dishes range from $10-15. They will serve you 5 side dishes consisting of broccoli, kimchi, bean sprouts, white radish, and fish cake. The food comes out steaming hot and very quickly. The most popular dishes here seem to be the bibimbap (in the stone pot) and the kimchi pancake, although I doubt you can go wrong with anything you pick here. I've also tried the seafood tofu soup and it is superb - They didn't crack an egg in it as many other Korean restaurants do. Maybe you have to ask for it?  \n\nService is professional and efficient. They refill your water frequently and without prompting. Barley tea is free. They do try to turn tables quickly and this is probably not the place to go if you want to take a leisurely lunch.\n\nOverall, this is an awesome place for Korean food. Come here at the odd hours or early evening (definitely before 7pm) to avoid a long wait. Order the bibimbap in the hot stone pot. Prices are reasonable in the $10-14 range.", "author": "Nicole J."}

( Not in order )\n\n1. Soft Tofu Soup w/ beef ( Spicy ) #12 ; The soup is just the right amount of spiciness for someone who enjoys a kick for their taste buds! The soup comes out pipping hot in a small black pot, accompanied with a side of rice. Easily, the best tofu Soup I've ever had. Extra charge if you want to add an egg. \n\n2. Dol - Sot Bibimbp w/ Beef #9 ; A must have, especially for those who are super hungry. The portion is ridiculously huge! Comes in a hot pipping stone pot, accompanied with a bottle of korean spicy sauce to mix the rice and veggies together. \n\n3. Kanpoongki #5 ; These chicken wings are literally the perfect combination of sweet and salty! The are ridiculously delicious and layered with lots of sauce! Great sharable item with friends! Get the wings, you will not regret! \n\n4. Korean Seafood Pancake #27 ; The seafood pancake is pretty standard as far as flavor goes. It's a rather large portion, so great item to share or even as an appetizer. \n\n5. Kalbi #1 ; Great portion size, as far as flavor it was just the right amount of sweetness, however I  wish the onions were carmelized more for flavor. Overall, if you are a big fan of ribs, this might be for you!  \n\n6. Dai Ji Bul Kogi #3 ; Really good Spicy Pork!! However, I wish it was more spicy, but if you want just a kick of spice, this would be a great option. \n\nOverall, this is one of those places that you will never get tired of going to because it's just that great.

The kimchi at this place wasn't as fermented as I usually like so the pancake didn't have that tangy/tart taste to it that I love. However, it was crispy on the outside without being oily which was much appreciated. The soft tofu stew was great, particularly since it was a really chilly day, and the spicy rice cakes were absolutely perfect.

People were cramped together and it was sooo tight but who cares. We ordered the beef bibimbap, some bulgogi pork, dukbokki, and kimchi panqueque. They brought the banchan, my favorites being the broccoli and fresh as pucc kimchi. I was shaking waiting for my impending feast. The bip came out in no time, and we attacked. We squirted some sauce on and got to it. The bip...was but a dream. Everything about it...amore. Next up, the dukbokki. This was subpar, the rice cakes were hard, there was so much sauce, idk. Comin in hot fresh out the kitchen was the pork. The real star of the show here was the kimchi pancake. I repeat...the kimchi pancake***!!! This is such a pregame for my soon to be trip to korea, i just love it.", "author": "Sarah S."}

We came around noon on a Sunday and only waited 10 minutes for a group of 2. \n\nThe Food: I found it delicious and relatively affordable, despite the Korean lady complaining to her SO how unauthentic the tofu stew is. We ordered the spicy BBQ chicken, bulgogi (BBQ beef), and jap chae (yam glass noodles) and got two bowls of rice/barley tea/pickled veggies (banchan) for as complimentary items. The spicy chicken wasn't that spicy but was delicious, the bulgogi was authentic enough (to my hangry Chinese girl taste buds), and the jap chae was amazing but IMO a bit low on the beef. The kimchi was really really good. \n\nThe Service: they were pretty good about refilling our banchan but the waitress accidentally forced my guy friend to pay for my meal by taking the bill before I slapped my CC down. Awkward but understandable. Asian girl + Asian boy at Asian restaurant = must be dating! ;) \n\nOverall, it was a great meal. Thanks Manna!!

Once we entered the building, the smell and smoke grazed my face and my mouth started to water.\n\nFirst, the bon chon was quite limited. I felt that they were a little bland. But at least they set the table with their version of go-chu-jang on the table for me to customize the flavors to my liking. Our group decided to share a seafood pancake and the sweet and spicy chicken. The seafood pancake wasn't grilled long enough so it was a bit soggy and floppy. But there was more than enough seafood to have been sprinkled throughout the pancake and it was both chewy and flavorful. The chicken was extremely appetizing. The batter was at a perfect thickness but it was easy to bite into the meat without it being overbearing. The sweetness level was on point and the spice was mild to my desire. I can honestly say that this is the best fried chicken I have ever had from a Korean restaurant.\n\nI then ordered a beef bibimbop for myself and it was delicious! The meat was very juicy and tender. The vegetables were light with a slight crunch and the runny egg on top was the perfect way to melt all the ingredients together. I ended up asking for more kimchi and bean sprouts to add in! The burnt rice from the hot pot gave the ending of the meal the perfect touch.\n\nI felt like the price was fair and the food was extremely extremely gratifying!

That kind of crushes my soul, but I won't knock Applebees too much for their effective advertising.\n\nThere was a certain fresh-but-savory balance in Manna's bowl that is not so easy to find. It's hard to compare bibimbap to bibimbap, but each bite at Manna felt rewarding.\n\nThe service was kind too. We were cramped at the table, and once another table cleared up, the server moved us immediately. \n \nI would return if I were in SF and looking for Korean food. Parking is a nightmare and there will probably be a wait, but those are small prices to pay for consistent, affordable, Korean food.", "author": "Chris O."}

My friend and I came here on a Wednesday. We got here around 6:20pm and there was already a 30 minute wait. There is no space to wait inside so you have to stand outside. The wait time doesn't get shorter, because when we left around 8pm, there was actually more people lining up...Seems like a pretty popular place.\n\nWe ordered a spicy pork ($13) and a rice noodle ($9) for two of us. The spicy pork came with rice, and with the side dishes, it was a plenty of food. The spicy pork came grilling on a stone plate, and SMELLED DELICIOUS with grilling onion pieces. It is A BIT ON THE SWEET SIDE, but if you eat with rice, it taste just perfect. The rice noodle came in a big portion. Nothing was too special about it other than the traditional Korean sauce, which is also sweet. IF YOU LIKE SWEET DISHES then this would be the perfect place for you. \n\nServing time was reasonable, but the service was eh. The place is pretty popular and the owner knows that too, since it is the one of the ONLY KBBQ in Inner sunset. When we finished they were trying pretty hard to get us to leave. The setting was VERY CRAMMED. If you are claustrophobic, go somewhere else.\n\nOtherwise, food is good. A little bit on the expensive side.", "author": "Wendy F."}

Korean food is where you can usually get the fullest for the cheapest in SF. Walked in around 2pm almost 3, and it was not super packed but it was pretty much filled. This place was tiny so it didn't seat more than 20 people at most. I ordered the Dol Sot Bibimbap and Soft Tofu Soup in Medium Spicy. The side dishes came first and it wasn't like a lot compared to other Korean restaurants like Tofu House. Manna's prices however, is cheaper. Food came in fairly quick and service was very attentive. Refilled our cups whenever it got low and asked us if everything was okay. The bibimbap was the best part with the goojuchang(spicy-light spicy red sauce). The soup didn't have anything extraordinary, it mainly tastes like the kimchi bowl noodles from Costco but without then noodles. Overall this place is amazing for Korean food, only downside is that it's way too small in here but so it isn't very convenient for groups to come here.", "author": "Lisa W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-17", "description": "When I first heard about Manna, I was stoked to check them out.  Despite the diverse array of restaurants 9th Ave has to offer, the area's long been without a Korean restaurant (sorry, but Hahn's Habachi doesn't count).  Now that I've finally tried them though, I wish I had a good reason for not trying them sooner!\n\nReally, the consistent line for a table is the only reason I've put off scratching Manna off my bookmarks.  With a menu full of so many tantalizing dishes, it's easy to see why people have been drawn to check them out.  However, after one look at the food as it came out, it was even easier to see why people keep coming back!\n\n-- BANCHAN - Cold Potato Strips, Broccoli, Fishcakes, Sweet Beans, Bean Sprouts, and Kimchi\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manna-san-francisco?select=1qnYALIc6fxleqrD_qmkgw#3_WA0Uq_KkNej-3KIqjPxw)\nSelection was a little light (we only had five beans), but the quality was great.  The fishcakes and kimchi were particularly notable; the fishcakes weren't overly dressed while the kimchi had just the right amount of spice and pungency.\n\n-- FRIED DUMPLINGS with Beef and Vegetables...$7.99\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manna-san-francisco?select=1qnYALIc6fxleqrD_qmkgw#J64m2q8iocWFYjUxtfuoCA)\nAs much as I enjoy steamed mandoo, they just taste that much better fried!  The filling was delicious, there wasn't much filler, the skins were perfectly thin and crispy, and they weren't very oily.  Not much to complain about! \n\n-- DOLSOT BIBIMBAP...$10.99\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/manna-san-francisco?select=1qnYALIc6fxleqrD_qmkgw#jyIbsa5w_rA8F6NDT2avUg)\nJust like with the little dish of broccoli, the vegetables were so fresh!  There was so much natural flavor, I didn't even need to add much of the gochujang sauce.  Though it could have used a little more beef, that's also true for any bibimbap...\n\nAlthough there's likely to be a crowd waiting outside during peak lunch and dinner times, don't get discouraged like how I did.  The wait may look long, but the line seems to move rather steadily.  For lunch on a Saturday, my friend and I only had to wait about 5-10 minutes for a table.\n\nAt this point, since I've only tried two things (simple ones at that), I can't quite say whether Manna is a five star joint or not.  However, after I try some of the soups, stews, meat plates, and noodle dishes, I wouldn't be surprised if this gets knocked up a notch.  I guess that means I should go back soon!", "author": "Mike L."}

Both the appetizers and the entrees came out at the same time. I thought the tea was yummy as well. \n\nMy BF and I tried the soy sauce wings and they're like super amazing! After we finished it, we wanted to order more even though we were full off of one order! I could've just ordered that as an entree instead of getting the tofu soup. I got the soft tofu soup and it's just like every other restaurant so I wasn't much a big fan of it. We also got the regular hot style bibimbob, which was amazing as well (I especially like the crunchy rice part). \n\nI definitely would recommend getting the soy sauce wings if anyone is a first-timer. Also, it would be good to go early cause there's always a dinner rush and a lot of people wait outside. The place is kinda cramped and small, but that shouldn't be too much of a big deal.", "author": "Vanessa L."}

Every time I come here, I wait at least 15 minutes max but during the lunch deal it's much shorter. My favorite dish has to be the Jab Chae and the Kal Bi. The Jab Chae is always very savory and has great texture. The Kal Bi is cooked perfectly with enough flavor. Everything is usually very flavorful. I would also like to mention that the Kimchi Fried Rice is also very delicious. However, it is more on the sweeter side than spicy so this kind of threw me off because I love spicy food and expected the kimchi fried rice to be just that. This also goes for the kimchi appetizer, it is much sweeter than spicy. Those are the 3 main regular dishes I order and the main reasons I come to this restaurant regularly. I also love the workers here!! They are all very friendly.", "author": "Catherine C."}

It's a small place and is a really cozy little spot best for small groups. There isn't really any table for more than four people so you most likely would have to split up into separate tables if you're bigger than a group of four.\n\nThey give you some side dishes such as broccoli, bean sprouts, fish cakes, kimchi, pickled vegetables. The side dishes weren't that great and normally fish cakes are my favorite but I found the fish cakes a little lacking in flavor.\n\nHowever, the food was excellent. Prices were around $10-$11 a dish which is normally the cheapest you can find for Korean food in the city. We got the kimchi stew, seafood pancake, and pork bulgogi to share. Everything was delicious and we finished everything on our plate. Stew wasn't overly salty or oily. Pancake was crispy and thin. Nothing was burnt. You don't know how many times I've ordered spicy pork bulgogi and had them burn the meat on the side. They gave us two bowls of rice and were very attentive in making sure to refill our tea or bringing us bowls for the stew. The tea was really good too.

None of this is their fault, of course, just a learning for me for next time...get it in a cold bowl. I wasn't thrilled that the dumplings don't have a vegetarian or seafood option.

This place is usually crammed so go early or be prepared to wait. If anything order to go. Their chicken is yummy and so is their tofu soup. Why I give Manna five stars is because many places that order to go do not include side dishes, but a reason why I love Korean food is because of the many choices, that being side dishes. A majority of the time I order to go, so having them include my favorite side dishes for free along with my meal, I feel my money was stretched, unlike other places where side dishes, when ordered to go costs almost an extra $3.\n\nI've tried many types of beef medium tofu soups and I know this place does not have MSG. It's real spices and real flavor. Usually for Korean food, go for spicier. After all, they are known for their love of red pepper, so it naturally would taste better for dishes to have the spice.

Always a must order for me.\n- Bul kogi ($13.99) - average portion size and just enough to satisfy. Meat us always juicy and tender. Ive never received it burnt before.

Manna's seafood pancake was huge and did not disappoint! The pancake was crispy with big pieces of diverse seafood including squid and oysters spread evenly throughout. I specified medium spicy level for my soft tofu soup and it came out quite spicy, so next time I would get low spicy level. The boy got the dolsot bibimbap, and I liked it a bit better than the soft tofu soup. We felt the pressure to eat and consolidate our many little banchan plates in order to have enough room for all our main dishes (hello, first world problem!).

There is something so comforting about settling down with a sizzling bowl of Dol-sot bibimbap on a cold winter night. It wasn't very cold in San Francisco that night, but I was still wanting a sizzling bowl. Since my daughter and I were going to the Penguins and Pajamas nearby at the California Academy of Science we decided we would grab dinner beforehand rather than eating in a museum cafe. \n\nThere are 3 dishes I can never decide between on a Korean menu Dol-sot bibimbap, soft tofu soup, and a kimchee pancake. Since this was my one shot here, and the prices were reasonable, I ordered both the Dol-sot bibimbap and pancake. \n\nManna offers 3 different versions of the bibimbap: traditional beef, seafood, and vegetable. I ordered the vegetable. The man dining at the table next to me ordered the soup and it took everything in me to not ask him if I could try a bite. \n\nThey quickly brought out the food and the bibimbap was delicious. They gave me a squirt bottle of the gochujang, which I always prefer so I can put on as much as I want.\n\nThe pancake wasn't the best I've ever had, but I would have polished it off if it had been the only meal. \n\nThe banchan sides were delicious, especially the kimchee which I can polish off pretty quickly.\n\nMy only complaint was once our food was delivered we did not receive any service so glasses went empty while trying to eat the spicy goodness.

Came here with 3 of my girl friends and we decided to get 3 dishes and split them all. We ended up getting the beef tofu soup, seafood pancake, and japchae! The tofu soup was pretty standard. Good flavoring but not too spicy! The seafood pancake I think was my favorite dish of the night! I've never tried anything like this so I was surprised when there was actual oysters, octopus, and shrimp in it! I expected them to skimp on the portions because seafood is expensive, but they definitely didn't! It was also fried and crisped up to perfection and served with a type of soy sauce on the side. The japchae was really good as well, a little too sweet if you eat too much though. It's different than normal japchae because it's very saucy, but I liked how they gave a lot of meat and veggies in it too. \n\nUs 3 girls were pretty full from these 3 dishes (and the side dishes of course!!).

It took me a while to write their well-deserved review but here it is! \n\nThe food here is cheap with reasonable portions. They offer complimentary banchan (is that what they're called?) and will refill it upon request! My favorite ones are the fishcakes and broccoli. They also offer pickled radish, potatoes, sweet black beans, bean sprouts, and Kimchi of course. They switch it up sometimes so they might not have all of the ones I just listed. Also, they give you refills on the rice too for when you order the meat or tofu soup!  So if one bowl of rice isn't enough, just ask for another bowl! \n\nI have tried almost everything on the menu and everything is just tasty. The following listed are a few of my favorites. The seafood pancake is big in size and is packed with seafood. The spicy chicken wings are so tasty. It is crunchy and is coated nicely with their spicy sauce. Mmmm gives me a little chicken wing fix when San tung down the street is busy. I always order the seafood dolsotbibimbap when I get there and I can never finish it! They give you your own bottle of sauce so you can add as much as you want to your liking. The egg is always cooked perfectly. When you mix all the ingredients together in the crackling stone pot, it blends together harmoniously. The occasional crunch from the burnt (not actually burnt) rice.... Errrrmyyygerd! SOOO GOOD. \n\nThe service is great here. The owner always greets you with a smile when you come in. It is a small restaurant so if you come in a big group it may be hard to get seats. 2-4 people is a good amount.

They also have this really great spicy beef stew and it's around $13. It is totally delicious and the beef is super tender.... had to ask for another bowl of rice cuz I finished it so fast!", "author": "Sam L."}

How could I pass up another chance to go? The restaurant is small so I felt a little guilty for taking my time while catching up with my friend. But the lunch rush was over so there were other tables available. The servers were all friendly and came by often to refill our glass of tea.\n\nI ended up ordering the spicy rice cakes with fish cake since my sister recommended it. Best decision ever. Sometimes I'm not sure whether or not I like rice cakes because it's very starchy. I feel that you can get tired of it pretty quickly. However, this dish here was not the case. The rice cakes were perfectly seasoned with the spicy sauce. There was also a good amount of fish cake, which created a balance for me. I loved that it wasn't all rice cakes and that there were different textures. My only complaint was that there were so much onions, both green and white ones. I would accidentally bite into one and it would leave an unappealing spiciness from semi cooked onions. However, other than that, the food were delicious and the sides were good and plentiful.", "author": "Andrea G."}

It was definitely much larger than I thought, not an appetizer and should be shared. Unfortunately, I had stuffed myself so full with the chicken (bone-in, tender, and the sauce wasn't overpowering) that we ended up having to pack the pancake, but I gladly ate it all the next day for lunch.\n\nBecause the place was so busy, and there were only two waitresses, the service was only a little slower, but I'd gladly come back for the food again.

I can see why the wait is so long, even for a small group. I definitely don't recommend this place for a larger group. The service was pretty good. The man who was in charge of seating the waiting guests was considerate to ask our party of three if we would want to sit at a table for two or wait for a larger table. \n\nI ordered their seafood pancake, dukbokki, and kimchi fried rice. The seafood pancake was delicious. I feel like places really can't do this wrong. The only thing I didn't like about it was that some slices of the pancake were completely bare. The seafood and other goodies weren't distributed well. The dipping sauce was also not a particular favorite of mine. I'm used to having sauce that is slightly tangy and savory, and I think Manna uses just soy sauce with some sesame oil. It was really salty. There dukbokki was so good! I love this dish for its chewy rice cakes and sweet & spicy sauce. I thought the flavors were spot on and texture was perfect. I really like their addition of zucchini; I feel like it adds freshness and a crispness to the dish. I didn't get a picture of the fried rice, but I only thought it was okay. I had a few bites and didn't return to that plate. It tasted sort of bland. I like some fermented soy bean sauce in my kimchi fried rice, but I didn't taste any of that flavor. If you like eating the kimchi, as in the fermented cabbage, then I'm sure you'll like this rice. \n\nI posted a photo of the bibimbap, but I didn't eat any of it so I can't give any opinion on it. \n\nI suggest you come here before you're actually hungry and just catch up with friends while waiting for your seats.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-16", "description": "With all the great reviews, I couldn't wait to try Manna. My impressions: Well, first of all, the wait was horrendous. It took over an hour and since the restaurant was so small, there was no indoor waiting area so we had to wait outside. Luckily, it was a warm night. \n\nThe seating area of the restaurant was probably about 600-700 square feet, mainly made up of tables for two. If you have a party of more than 4, don't even bother. I was with a party of 3 and it took really long because we had to wait for two tables for two that were side-to-side to be vacant before we could be seated. Oh well, it is what it is and I should've did my research before I went.\n\nNow for the food. Like all Korean restaurants, it started with the banchan, 5 different dishes in this case. I can't say they were the best I've had. The bean sprouts dish, for example, were blanched but still had the raw taste to them. Since every Korean restaurant does their banchan their own way, I guess I can't really complain.\n\nAs for the main dishes, I got the staples: seafood pancake, seafood sundubu, dosot bibimbap and pork bulgogi. The standout of the four was the seafood pancake. Super crispy and big! The dosot bibimbap was disappointing. Usually when I order this at other places, I would let it sit for a while so the rice would crisp up and develop a char on the bottom. Unfortunately, the stone pot was not hot enough. The vegetables in the dish also didn't seem fresh and were soggy. I recommend you pass on this one.  As for the pork bulgogi, it was good and not overly spicy. The sundubu was good as well, packed with quite a surprising amount of seafood in it.\n\nOverall, I like Manna. Are there better Korean restaurants that I rather go to in the City? Yes, plenty. But Manna does offer a unexplainable charm. Maybe it's because it's small and you're elbow to elbow with your neighbors. Maybe it's because the tables are so small, you're worried there's not enough room to hold all the dishes you ordered. Whatever it is, I'll definitely go back. \n\nMy tips: 1) Only go here if you have a party of two, otherwise prepare for a long wait, 2) Consider takeout. There were tons of people ordering things to go and 3) Don't be angry at the semi-rude owner, who's just trying to get everyone seated and eating as fast as he can. He's doing the best given the circumstances. He was actually very accommodating to our party.\n\nPrice-wise, it's very reasonable. They don't offer any leaves and garlic for your bulgogi or red bean rice in a dosot like other places do. But not every restaurant has the room for that.", "author": "Albert L."}

Service isn't exactly the best, as it was hard to grab their attention. But when you do, they gladly refilled our banchans and tea.\n\nThe chicken wings were pretty good, but even after the bi bim bap I was pretty full... I only managed to eat two wings.

Most tables are meant to sit two, so if you have a party bigger, cross your fingers for tables to finish up close together. We waited about 30 minutes on an early Saturday (6pm)\n\nBreakdown of our dishes:\n1. Kanpoongki - Sweet/Spicy chicken wings. They were more sweet than anything else. Not spicy at all. And they were comparatively small compared to other places. Not even close to San Tung standard.\n\n2. Dol Sot Bimbimbap - Served sizzling hot, this dish was pretty good, but the ratio of vegetables to beef was absurd. We only had a little sliver hiding under the egg. :( That said though, the flavor was pretty spot on and I do like the crispy rice pieces from the bottom.\n\n3. Kimchee Pancake - This was probably my favorite of the night....and probably also the cause of my suffering later. I have a feeling it wasn't cooked thoroughly.\n\n4. Spicy Seafood Stew - I didn't actually try this, but it was impressive. Instead of stuffing it with assorted pieces of small shellfish, they managed to get an entire blue crab (the legs and most of the body) in here. Good to know its fresh even though the crab itself didn't have much meat.\n\n5. Japchae - The noodles were nice and chewy, But we were surprised that the actual serving was so much smaller than the sample picture.\n\nMy impressions of Manna were actually pretty good...that is, until I got food poisoning. I'm not sure how recent that 78/100 health score is, but it'll make me think twice before coming back.\n\nThey take everything but Amex.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

The fish cakes are a nice touch, giving it a bit of a seafood flavor in it. The seafood pancake is the best out of all the korean restaurant in SF. Along with the soy sauce, it is soft and they don't skimp on the squid, clams, or shrimp. Although there was some shell bits in it. Love the bibimbap also.

Literally, just seconds after we sat down, there were already people lined up outside. Mind you, this was a Tuesday night. So... What makes this place so amazing?!\n\nThe food is excellent! I has the veggie tofu soup and my mom had the beef short ribs (see pictures). We both finished every bite and sip! Both of our dishes were full of amazing flavor and cooked to perfection. I loved the little appetizers that they give. My favorite were the black beans. Also, ask for their house spicy sauce. It's amazing! Sweet and spicy---yummmm! \n\nThe service is excellent! The two girls and the man at the front (I believe he is the owner) are all very sweet and attentive. Every time a new dish came out to another table, my mom had to ask what it was! Usually, waiters would get annoyed by that, but these guys were so sweet and told my mom what each and every dish was!\n\nI'm not sure if they take reservations, but if they do, I highly suggest to call in for a table! \n\nIf you want amazing Korean food at a great price, come here!!!", "author": "Anastasia N."}

Just walking in from the cold and smelling the food in the air was warming enough. It's a small space so seats were hard to come buy but we were seated fairly quickly. They have lunch specials and the banchan selection is pretty decent. I ordered the jap chae and it was really flavorful. I did find it odd that it was served with an order of rice like all the other lunch specials - carb overload. Still the noodles struck a nice balance of sweet and savory. \n\nThe folks that work here are just lovely.

I'm kidding, ok...maybe not. :/\n\nTaking over Little Bangkok (Thai) last June, Manna serves up Korean cuisine at affordable prices. For lunch, nothing is over $9.99 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tr15WgMHIC_W2gqBpuk3-A?select=2dGc21IsA7mT5cYRdco-bg) and nothing over $12.99 for dinner (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tr15WgMHIC_W2gqBpuk3-A?select=0HVVBelFxAx1YdTHB8z6pQ). A great welcome change as I usually pay $26 for a plate of kalbi at Korean restaurants in The Richmond. With the lower prices, you will notice that the portions are smaller though. \n\nMy friend and I came to Manna last night for dinner after one of us had a whole bottle of wine to himself at happy hour; keyword: \"himself\" so I wasn't the drunkie this time.

These wings were disappointing. Although there were cooked to a delicious crisp, the sauce didn't coat all the wings. The sauce was bland lacking both sweetness and spice; not finger-licking worthy.\n\n*KALBI ($12.99) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tr15WgMHIC_W2gqBpuk3-A?select=1qnYALIc6fxleqrD_qmkgw\nWhere's the sizzle yo? The kalbi oddly arrived in less than 5 minutes with no steam permeating from the iron plate and into the air. It seems they precooked the kalbi before throwing it on the iron plate for presentation purposes. The kalbi was tender but lacking the quintessential smoky flavor from the non-existent char marks and the marinade was reminiscent to Chinese hoisin sauce--way TOO sweet!\n\nManna is a PRIME example of how service can make a difference. The super friendly owner and waitress made up for the lackluster and not very well executed food. \n\nFor solid Korean grub, I'll be taking my ass back to The Richmond...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

And not only is it fun to say, but eating it is an adventurous and satiating endeavor.  It's chock-full of delicious and warmly satisfying ingredients, topped with an egg cooked to your specs, and ends with a reward of golden, buttery, crunchy rice that you scrape from the hot stone bowl.  To me, this dish is pretty near to perfect.  \n\nWhen last I encountered Dolsot Bibimbap it was at a Korean joint in Berkeley and, though good, it was filled with too many healthy tasting options for my palate.  Manna's version is filled with a plethora of wonderful ingredients but it just tastes satisfying and delicious, not like I'm eating health food.  This is a compliment to Manna.  If I lived nearby I'd be eating Manna's DB here on a weekly basis.  \n\nAn order of Soft Tofu Seafood Soup was equally satisfying.  When ordering, the waitress questioned the desired level of spice and, when she noticed wavering, settled on \"medium spicy with a side of additional spice\".  The soup emerged boiling to a degree that I thought it might contain something live (it did not) and accompanied by a healthy dollop of added spice bomb to be used as desired.  \n\nMeals included an ample array of tasty banchan, refilled upon request.  \n\nIncluding a small Korean beer, pre-tip dinner for two was under $25.  I've not been so satisfied at such a reasonable price in a long time.  \n\nManna has large picture windows looking out onto Irving and has a warmer feeling than most Korean joints I've been to.  At these price points and with this nice ambience I'd likely choose Manna again over the numerous restaurants in the surrounding area.  If it were a cold night with fog rolling in it'd be a slam dunk.  Manna's food is truly belly warming.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Restaurant was crowded on a Sunday evening just before the holidays. I had the worst day ever. Completely exhausted and a bit bitchy. How could I enjoy food when I felt so irritated? Came here for its famous dol-sot bibimbap and bulgogi. The service was quite pleasant. The owner kept on asking my friend to see if I was Korean. No I'm not. Why is everyone asking me if I was? I needed to be left alone that day, and me in a foul mood finally rubbed off on my friend because he was becoming irritated as well. Who could blame him? I was simply in a \"why am I eating with you tonight\" mood.  Thankfully no one noticed it. \n\nSo we ordered dol-sot bibimbap  - one for each, and then some bulbogi for extra protein. DsB was the hit at this Korean place, even when you were irritated. Now, if that's not comfort food, what is?\n\nFast forward a few weeks. Am no longer a bitch. Decided to write a review for this cool little Inner Sunset restaurant. Inner sunset is where you probably have been seeing me hovering lately. I've been so bored of the Mission and was looking for something hip and cool, Instead of going somewhere new I returned to Inner Sunset where I spent a lot of my youth hanging out with my friends from back east.  Fun fact, I'm still hanging out with friends from back east. Just newer immigrants than my original crew. \n\nAnd I wanted to tell my friend that back when I was young, Inner sunset had just Ibisu as the only Asia restaurant stand-out, and I've wasted a lot of mornings drinking margarita and Bloody Mary in this popular brunch place nearby. But now you can get the best bibiimbap here without having to go to Korea or L.A. So yes I would like to return soon to this corner diner style restaurant. And I promise that I'll behave like a mature adult and not some pouty brat.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I called it a game of Diner Dash gone wrong.\nWe had waited 30 minutes for a table for 4 to clear up and we were next on the list, BUT, the group that was before us that was a no show, came back from the bar across the street. The owner is a really nice guy though and he put them back up on the list. We ended up staying because we figured a table would open up soon. Unfortunately, every other table started opening up so we couldn't get two tables for two that were next to each other for the longest time. Two tables for two kind of near by each other opened up and he asked us if we would like to take a seat and we gladly accepted, because waiting in flats and waiting in heels are two different things. Another table for two finally opened up and he managed to swing some tables together as if they were magnets! \n\nThe moment we sat, we were given utensils and our ban chan (YUM!)\nOrdered the same stuff + a dol sot bibimbap and kalbi. Tbh I'm there for the wings and the kimchi fried rice. Manna does those two things waaaaaay better than Toyose, no competition there.\n\nTowards the end of the meal, we were offered an order of the fried dumplings on the house. It was the greatest gesture, really! And boy were those things good. I like to call them Ling Ling 2.0.\n\nReally love the food here, definitely worth the wait. I might skip on dinner if it was four of us again though. Still think this place is a little bit too cozy though.. Let's be real, this place only seats like 10 people and the food comes out super hot so no one can really eat for 10 minutes anyways LOL\n\nAlso wanted to give a big finger to all you people who head to the bar across the street and enjoy yourselves while the rest of us wait patiently and still manage to get seated after you because the owner is so nice.

The waitress constantly refilled our tea and our FREE banchan before our main dishes came out. The banchan was very limited -- only five dishes and a complimentary sweet & spicy chicken wings dish (because it was opening day). I had the dol-sot bibimbap, which came with very moist rice that doesn't stick to the pot, but the meat was limited. I sampled some of bf's kimchi jaeyuk bokum (pork and kimchi w/ spicy sauce), which was very good as well. The amount of spiciness wasn't overbearing, however, there was very little pork and a lot more tofu. We were offered some hot soup, but we were too full to eat anymore.\n\nPrices are extremely reasonable. All dishes are ~$10 or under, and dinner dishes are only $1-2 more than lunch dishes.

I only been to this restaurant once when it was crowded but our wait was only 5 minutes or less, we were surprised of that but very happy. \n\nThe food I ordered were soft tofu soup, duk bok ki (rice cake and fish cake in spicy sauce), and dae ji bol koji (spicy pork in spicy sauce). As you can tell these food are all spicy but their spicy level is just the right amount so if you are a mild person, I'm sure you'll be able to handle these dishes. The dishes you order come with banchan (side dishes) and rice, you can request for more when you run out without extra charge. For the soft tofu soup they ask the spicy level you want and whatever level you get is fine because the broth goes well with the rice and you'll be satisfied. \n\nI would most definitely recommend this place to try because its in everyone's budget and its delicious, also I've told my friends and family members to try this place and they enjoyed it too.", "author": "Victoria G."}

My friend was just going to leave it because to him it's an honest mistake, right when we were paying I mentioned it to the manager and he offer to remove it from the bill, we politely declined but he insisted.\n\nOver all this location has great food at not so high prices and great management. From the times I've been here the servers are genuinely glad to serve you, which is a big plus.", "author": "Oriel F."}

I've only been going for the past year and all instances were good, but in retrospect, there are some issues. \n\nOff the top of my head, the seafood pancake is excellent, the wings are hit-and-miss, the bulgogi is great, and the fried dumplings were fantastic. Portions are always surprisingly substantial. The octopus is one of the worst seafood dishes I've ever eaten in my entire life. It was like trying to eat spicy racket-balls, in that some parts were so over-cooked that I literally could not chew through them, and the sauce was dull.\n\nService is friendly, but it's hard to get a glass of water or a timely refill on tea, and I've been unintentionally skipped on the wait list because they couldn't figure out which side of the sheet they were using.\n\nPleasant staff, good food, reasonable prices, and ample portions, but not a great dining experience overall.", "author": "Quinn S."}

(with beef or chicken, depending on what else I'm having)\n\nTheir spicy tofu is always something I get every time I come here. It is just right and not too expensive! I always ask for mild; maybe next time I'll try medium spice. It tastes so good with their rice, yum. Not too oily either. And it's perfectly suited for the foggy and cold weather in San Francisco.\n\nTheir bulgolgi can sometimes be dry, but I usually throw it in with my spicy tofu soup and rice combined kinda dish. If it was more juicier, I would probably like it more. Otherwise, I'm not complaining. It is still good, but I've had better bulgogi elsewhere.\n\nI've tried their Dolsot bibimbap, and from what I remember it was really filling that I could barely eat anything else.\n\nThey offer a small variety of banchan, usually consisting of mini broccoli, bean sprouts, this tofu cake-like dish, kimchee, and this potato thing that my sister really likes.\n\nParking can be hard in this area since it's near so many other businesses and a popular area for dining, so maybe if you come during off-hours for lunch and dinner, you'll be lucky.\n\nWhy I keep coming back is because their prices aren't as expensive as other Korean restaurants I've been to, and it's close to home. Everything is decently priced, and the quality isn't bad, but it could be better.

Still enjoyable, but I definitely prefer the ones over at places like SO or Aria. And, worth noting is that our entire dish was mostly drumsticks, not wings - not that I'm complaining, because I much prefer these anyway!\n\n* Soft Tofu Soup with Beef, Spicy (Sundubu, $9) [ http://bit.ly/U8XMaL ] - Flavor-wise, Manna's sundubu is probably among the better ones I've tried in the Bay Area. Great flavor, good spiciness, and all around heartwarming and filling.

It wasn't even all that!\n\nWe had to put ourselves on the waiting list because the place was jam-packed like a can of sardines and waited for about 20 minutes to be seated. We all waited outside because there definitely wasn't enough space inside for our party of four to stand around.\n\nWe decided to divvy things up family-style and ordered the dol-sot bibimbap, kalbi, and kimchi bokum bap from the lunch specials menu. However, note that their lunch special runs from Monday-Friday. They must've misinterpreted what I said because they brought out the kimchi chigae (#19 from the regular menu) instead of our kimchi bokum bap (#19 from the lunch specials).\n\nI felt bad for having sent it back to the kitchen, but the waiter seriously gave me hella shit. I told him about the problem and he brought it back to the front where he talked to what seemed like the owner and pulled up our tab. He came back and addressed the lunch specials vs. regular menus and had the nerve to roll his eyes at me. We came on a weekend and didn't read the menu thoroughly to realize that the lunch specials only apply on the weekdays, but we still ordered from the lunch specials and the waitress that took our orders didn't say shit. They were probably throwin' shade up front, but despite the confusion on both ends, were nice enough to correct our order. Good call because things were about to go down!!!\n\nThe food was decent, but had the potential to taste a lot better. The kimchi definitely wasn't up to par, the dol-sot bibimbap was bland and skimpy on the beef, the kalbi didn't have enough flavor, and the kimchi bokum bap was just greasy. This pretty much sums it up to \"plain\" in four different variations. The total came out to about $34, which seemed just right for what we had.\n\nMaybe it was just the time of day, but I'm indifferent.

Beef in the galbi tang was super tender (as it should be) and the flavor was just awesome. \n\nBanchan quality has gone up a notch. They definitely are not stingy with it here either. They always ask if you want a refill of anything when they notice you are empty or low on it. \n\nThe prices haven't gone up (yet) but they probably will later. Upon mid scoop of rice into my galbi tang, I looked over and noted that Chris Cosentino was eating here. \nI have an inkling that Manna will continue to do well ;)", "author": "Susy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-22", "description": "So there is a small story going into this place.  \n\nOnce upon a time, I went to college in Davis and there was a Korean restaurant called Manna.  A friend suggested, \"oooh! we should go there!\" Another replied, \"uhhhh no, it's not the same Manna as the one in SF.\"  Given that I'm from SF, I had no idea what this Manna place was, where it is, and how it compares.  Eventually some later time, I tried the one in Davis and it was disappointing .____.  Decided to take my little cousin out one time and since she's never had Korean, I went onto my trusty Yelp app and THIS Manna came up. Hazzzah! I finally tried it. -- End of lame story.\n\nWhoever that friend was years ago that spoke of this Manna was correct, this Manna is so much better.  It's a very small place and had about 10 tables all together from what I recall.  Good thing we went on a week day and some random time in the afternoon, we didn't have to wait too long hehe.  Though, after being seated, it did take some time to get the attention of the waitress.  Of course, that could be my fault too because I sat on the side facing the window and my little cousins doesn't know what to do at restaurants because she's a hermit. :P  Anywho, got the orders in: Kimchi Fried Rice (typical), Seafood Pancake (also typical), Chicken Wings (Most obvious), and the Bibimbap (I never order this because I had it once somewhere before and I just didn't like it.  My cousin wanted to try it). \n\nFIRST OF ALL, that is way too much food for us.  I always overestimate how much I can eat.. But it's okay because we both had a full box of to-go ^____^  The chicken was crispy, just the way I like it! And hot too;  a lot of times I've been to place where the chicken is not as hot as it should be.  I like it when I burn my tongue..... lulz, jk. But you get the point.  Seafood pancake had a lot of stuff in it, less of the mix which it awesome because so many places, all I eat is the pancake mix.  The Kimchi Fried Rice, duhhhhhhh. Best I've had ever really.  I almost didn't want to share with my cousin because she said she liked that dish the most... But of course, being the kind and generous person I am (no, not really)  I shared ;)   And lastly, the bibimbap! To my surprise, I really liked it.  I especially liked the crisped rice at the bottom. Yummmms, don't tell my mama, she will go off about my health. \n\nSo there ya have it! the only downfall was the service because it cleared up by the time our food came out and it was hard getting attention for water and such but eh! She was still super nice and all. \n\nI also got very lucky and found parking right in front in the corner, heheheh. 'Twas a good day, the day I finally tried SF's Manna.", "author": "Lisa L."}

Their food tastes great, staff is friendly, and prices are super cheap and even cheaper during lunch! I usually get the Dol Sot Bibimbap (bibimbap in a hot stone bowl), which is only $8.99 during lunch and $9.99 during dinner. They also have many other Korean dishes (bulgolgi, galbi, japchae, tofu soup, seafood pancake, etc.) to choose from and all at affordable prices. Their banchan is also always fresh.

Granted, this is a pretty small place and I don't think I'd recommend this place if you have more than 4 people unless you're willing to wait even longer for tables to empty. I imagine shorter waits for parties of two. And as other reviews have mentioned, be prepared to circle this area for parking.\n\nThat being said, the food came out relatively fast and it was pretty good! We ordered bulgogi, ddeokbokki, and a seafood pancake. It came with the usual banchan and two bowls of rice. We had no expectations for the seafood pancake but we ended up liking that the most because of the crispy outside and delightfully chewy inside with a pretty generous amount of seafood (I think scallop and squid?)! The bulgogi and ddeokbokki are what you would expect from any other Korean place so no surprises there!\n\nAs for service, wait staff were attentive when we needed refills on tea or banchan.

The restaurant space itself it quite small, with fewer than 10 small tables.  Luckily, there were a couple open tables next to each other, so my group of 5 could be seated immediately.  The menus are printed like placemats, located under the glass table top, and we were quickly given cups of hot tea.  Within minutes of ordering our meals, there were a variety of side dishes brought to our table (kim chi, bean sprouts, little dried fish, fish cakes, broccoli, potato).  Manna has written on their menus that side dishes are unlimited and they are good about refilling them when empty.  The side dishes were pretty standard tasting.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered (and shared, as usual):\n\n-Sweet and Spicy Chicken Wings ($8.99): these come out fresh from the fryer- be careful- they are hot!  The sauce on top of these fried wings is very thick and very sweet with a little bit of spice.  The flavor is pretty good, but the sweetness can be overwhelming after a few wings.  The order comes with 9 wings- so it'd be good to have someone to share these with.\n\n-Beef Bul Kogi ($10.99): A generous portion for the price.  The beef was soft and the flavor was good.  \n\nThe food came out hot and the service was very helpful.  We got refills of our water, tea, and side dishes many times.  However, my only complaint was that the food did not come out at the same time.  Two people, who ordered bibimbap got there dishes right away.  My beef came about 5 minutes after and the two orders of chicken wings came another 10 minutes or so after.  Since we were sharing our dishes, this didn't really affect us too much- but I could see that this would be slightly annoying otherwise.  I'd say this is about 3.5 stars, but I'll round up because the service was so friendly and there isn't any other place to get Korean food in the neighborhood.\n\nNotes:\n-Unlimited side dishes and rice refills.\n-Free hot tea.\n-Parking in the area may be difficult, depending on the time, but is usually manageable.", "author": "Samantha L."}

My tofu soup was nothing special. It seemed like there wasn't that much tofu in it. My friend said her bi bim bap was just \"okay\". To me, the food here doesn't seem to be able to compete with what you can get in the Richmond District, including dishes at Muguboka, My Tofu House or Han Il Kwan. Not only are the food portions at Manna smaller, but it lacks flavor and substance.\n\nThe service was quite slow, and I had to ask for tea (went practically the whole meal on an empty glass) more than once. While our server was polite and thanked us for dining with them, I did not feel they were adequate enough to make me a repeat customer.

And it's hard to find good Korean food with good portions at a good price in SF (at least that's been my experience - and please message me if you have suggestions!!!).\n\nManna is close to my house so it's a satisfying walk especially on a cold Sunset night given you're about to eat some hot and spicy yums. The place is in fact small, so don't rule out having to wait a bit (seems to be about 30 minutes tops). They turn over tables quickly; however, I at no point felt rushed to complete my meal. A benefit to the small space if you're social like me, is that you get to interact with your neighbors, especially in the case that they're eating something that looks good and you're curious what it is.\n\nThe last time I was there, my husband ordered the beef bibimbap over rice. He loved it alongside his Cass beer. I ordered the kimchi chige (Kimchee-pork soup which is my Korean go-to). It was delicious. alongside a bottle of clean soju. It could  have been a bit more spicy but that aside, the flavors were excellent and a perfect portion. The banchan portions and quality were very good. Their kimchee is quite nice.\n\nCome here for a casual dinner, heck, maybe even a 2nd or 3rd date dinner if you're feeling like getting off the grid a bit. Service is excellent.

Nonetheless, I am SO happy to have Manna. It's yummy, close to where I live, pretty cheap... and basically is great comfort food for SF weather.\n\nFOOD\n-#9 Dolsot Bimbimbap!!! This is my favorite Korean dish. Ever. It's $10 for a nice big bowl of this, including kbbq. (Some places you have to pay extra for the meat) It comes with everything - sliced carrots, bean sprouts, sliced zucchini, sea weed, and egg. Everything, including this comes out hot and fresh off the stove. This dish be my favorite for ever and ever and I approve of it here at Manna.\n-#13 Seafood Soft Tofu Soup. Love. I get it at level spicy and it's pretty tolerable. Flavor-wise, this is bomb. Seafood-wise, it doesn't always have tons of it in it. The last time I had to make sure there was seafood in it - I was afraid they had mixed up my order. However, it is no additional cost to include seafood in this soup ~$9 so it didn't bother me much that it didn't have as many squids and clam as I would have liked. \n-#28 Seafood Pancake. I've never seen such a HUGE seafood pancake! Seriously, it's just so much! Lots of seafood (ha, I noticed there was more of it in here than my seafood tofu soup). Comes with dipping sauce. Totally worth the monies to get this.\n-#4 Dak Bul Kogi. Get this if you like BBQ chicken and lots of it. Since it's the only thing in this dish, make sure to order something else to balance everything out.\n-#26 Kimchee Jaeyuk Bokum. Sweet tofu, pork, kimchee and gochuchang. I really liked the tofu since it is sweet.\n\nSIDE DISHES\n-All orders come with side dishes (banchan) of broccoli, fishcake, bean sprouts, kimchi, sweet black bean, and potato strips. \n-Free hot barley tea + refills with all orders.\n\nPROS\n-Everything listed above! \n-Food comes out pretty fast :)\n-Great service!\n-Good for parties of 4, and 2s.\n\nCONS\n-Closed on Mondays :(\n-Gets pretty crowded during dinner, so come early! \n-No proper ventilation... it gets pretty steamy, so, foggy windows from the outside.\n-Don't wear a big jacket.

Korean food is often manna for my ailing body, but there were no sniffles that day, just a void that was eager to be filled by my favorite food.\n\nAfter walking in, I was immediately plied with tea and tasked with choosing lunch from either their lunch menu or regular menu. They're offering nearly everything you'd want from a Korean restaurant: bibimbap, japchae, bbq, jiigae, hite beer :)  \n\nWhy did I have to choose? In the Bible manna appeared with the night's dew. I deliberated for awhile, but chose the seafood soft tofu soup. The banchan were tasty (kimchi, bean sprouts, broccoli, and a few more), and offered to be replenished by the nice waitress. The soup was a spicy stew of kimchi, oysters, shrimp, and squid, with rice on the side, and was wonderful, once it cooled down enough to be eaten.\n\nGoing to a Korean restaurant alone is always challenging, because I fill up on banchan before the meal comes, which is usually way too much for me. Manna's servings are perfect. They arranged their lunch menu (11am-3pm) with healthy but tempered appetites in mind. I still walked away with some leftovers, but not half of their kitchen nor enough to feed a Sim City. \n\nSorry, simmites.

This is my second Korean restaurant, but not my 2nd time trying Korean food (my roommate is Korean). The kimchi pancake was very good, and very sizable. I also really liked the bibimbap was good. The spicy+sweet sauce went well with the beef. I also liked that it was served on a hot bowl and kept cooking the whole time. Lastly, we got the short ribs. They were sweet and good, I personally like beef to be cooked a little more, but I guess it was cooked in more of a Korean Style.", "author": "Nikita K."}

We found parking easily at the meters, but i can see parking trouble later at night since it's near a busy area (Naan n Curry, Crepevine, Starbucks, ect.)\n\nCame in and got seated right away. I'm slightly claustrophobic and the place felt a little suffocating. I feel like in order to get around I have to side step between tables because they're that close. Bathroom: REAL small. You open the door and the sink is right there. Then you have to walk past a water boiler I guess, to get to the toilet. I liked that they had mango soap though. =)\n\nI want to say that there are maybe 12-16 tables.\n\nAnyways, back to the main reason why you're probably reading this review! The food. Yum.\n\nBanchan: Only 5 small dishes. We got kimchi, bean sprouts, these really hard peanuts, broccoli, and potato. I was disappointed that I didn't get any fishcakes. That's my favorite. And after looking at the photos, I'm even MORE disappointed because I could tell that previous yelpers got fishcake or a different variety of banchan. Maybe it's a weekly thing?\n\nBF got bul kogi. Came on a sizzling platter and a bowl of rice. I want to say that it's just enough for one person, probably female. Male? I'm sure they'd want more meat, but at 8.50 for the lunch menu, it wasn't too bad. \n\nI ordered the dol-sot bibimbab. It was either that or just bibimbab. I kinda have a thing with food coming into stone pots and sizzling platters. I feel as if a hole in my stomach has been filled with yummy, sizzling, crunchy, food. \n\nOur bill came to $19 even. It should have been a little more with cents, but they were nice enough to just leave it off!\n\nThe female waitress was very attentive! She refilled our tea plenty of times and come over maybe three times to ask if we were doing alright. We got our bill without needing to asking and she came and took it no longer than a minute or two after we set it back down. There was also a couple next to us who ordered something but found it too chewy for their teeth. The waitress allowed them to make a different order and didn't seem bothered at all by it.\n\nOverall:\n+Lunch menu was decent.

We came here a few weeks back on a Saturday just a bit before 6pm. We were seated immediately, but as we pondered the menu, other diners started to pour in and the small Manna was quickly filled.\n\nI ordered the Dok Bul Kogi with Rice. The chicken was very moist and delectable. However, the rest of my group were not as satisfied with their portions (they got variations of Bibimbap and Soft Tofu Soup). If you've got a small appetite, this place will be good for you. However, if you generally eat two bowls of rice and meat for a meal, Manna just may come up short for you.\n\nThe only good thing is they'll keep refilling your side dishes, only IF you remind them, especially when it gets busy. And if the whole restaurant is filled with customers and your party's already got their food, the automatic attention you get from the waitresses decreases rapidly. I only say this because it took simply forever just to get more tea and to get our check.\n\nAlso, it took forever to find parking, considering how Manna's located in the inner Sunset, of which street parking is almost inexistent during dinner hours. Expect to spend at least 10-15 minutes to find parking; better yet, take Muni to get around parking hassles.\n\nThe price is just so-so in relation to their portions, but it's still worth trying what Manna's got to offer.", "author": "Bonita K."}

This place can literally can only accommodate parties that are smaller than 4. The wait for a table is not too long since people tend to eat fast here. I usually get their Dot Sot Bibimbap which comes in a stone pot or their Kimchi Fried Rice. The Dot Sot Bibimbap came with an egg, beef, bean sprouts, carrots, and cucumbers. The Bibimbap is sometimes inconsistent as the pot is not hot enough for the rice to burn which gives the nice taste, but you drench it with gochujang to compensate for the taste. Their Kimchi Fried Rice was alright, but they do not have much meat. I can actually do a better job making Kimchi Fried Rice at home. They are very stingy when it comes to the amount of Banchan they give you since they only give you a sauce plate full with only one refill. Service here is very responsive as they come check up on all the tables fairly often and they refill your tea while they are at it. Overall not a bad place for Korean food if you have a small party and if you looking for a quick place to eat.", "author": "Peter C."}

The waitress promptly greeted us and served us some tea to start while we looked over the menu. We decided to share the Seafood Pancake and the Dae Ji Bul Kogi (marinated pork). After placing our order with the kitchen, our waitress returned with several different \"sides\" for us to munch on while we waited for our food. The sides are bottomless and range from lightly steamed broccoli to kimchi. None of the sides stood out to me as being absolutely fantastic, but they helped stave off some of the hunger for what ended up being about a thirty minute wait for the food after we had placed our order.\n\nThe seafood pancake came out first, and it was a little different than I had imagined. There was a plethora of seafood that tasted fresh, which I was very enthused to see. The only aspect of the dish that I didn't like was that it was very sloppily made, meaning that all the Chinese broccoli was on one side of the pancake, and most of the seafood was on the other, making for a very unevenly disbursed meal. That aside, the pancake is HUGE and we couldn't finish it on our own.\n\nAs for the pork dish, I was absolutely blown away. It was perfectly tender and flavorful, and the marinade was fantastic. I would 100% recommend this dish, and I can imagine it is indicative of the quality of all their other meat dishes as I was hungrily looking at the bowls of Bi Bim Bop and other meaty dishes that the other patrons had ordered around us.\n\nI feel that Manna was fairly authentic considering the majority of the clientele was Korean and it was incredibly busy for a Sunday night.

And this place is goooood.\n\nA small little restaurant encased in all glass in the inner sunset, there is something strangely cozy about this place. You can look outside and see the fog rolling in, but you're inside this glass case of a restaurant and you're comforted by some bubbling tofu stew, Dol-bibimbap, or sizzling bbq. Even though this is the furthest thing from being at grandma's, you feel like you're taken care of as long as you're inside Manna.\n\nAnd the food is yums! The seafood tofu stew is seafoody but spicy - just how you'd want it. The bbq is not too sweet - a pet peeve I have with some Korean bbq places... but theirs is flavorful in the right way. Same with the Dol-bibimbap - their meats and sauce isn't just straight up sweet stuff, but actual flavor.\n\nTheir seafood pancake is some of the best ever - crispy and with lots of seafood. Thick and hearty. \n\nOn top of that, this place is CHEAP. And it's great for small parties of 2. \n\nWe want to eat everything when we come here so over-ordering is always on order. But it's okay because it tastes great the next day. \n\nLike others, came for San Tung, but ended up here. And now, we just come here.

Plus I literally hang out with all Koreans whose moms know how to make everything bomb-diggity, so yes, my standards for Korean food are pretty darn high.\n\nUnfortunately, SF doesn't have much Korean food, and sadly, Manna was just OK.\n\nFOOD:\n1. Bulgogi - The beef was overcooked, because it was tough to chew, despite cut into tiny slices. It lacked that strong marinated flavor. The only thing that really added flavor to the beef was the fried onions that was laid underneath the bulgogi.\n\n2. Spicy & sweet chicken wings - Got this because Yelp mentioned they were pretty bombass, and the reason why we came to Manna in the first place was San Tong's line was too long...so of course we had to get them chicken wings! I liked how the wings were not overly fried or greasy at all. Bonus points for not lathering sauce over the wings to make them all sticky and goo-ey like some Korean places. The meat was pretty tender. HOWEVER, the wings were not spicy at all, and was only a tad bit sweet. \n\n3. Japchae** - Got to save the best review for last because this japchae was AH-MAZING. I highly recommend this! I've never really had such delicious japchae -- you can definitely taste the sweetness of the sweet potato in the noodles, but it wasn't deathly sweet at all. I had my bottle of hot sauce on the side, but you definitely didn't need it for this dish! The noodles were fresh, chewy, and just SO full of flavor. I didn't even want to eat the shreds of beef or onions that came with it cus the noodles were THAT GOOD.\n\n4. Banchan (side dishes) - Kimchi wasn't spicy, fish curd was hard to chew, and everything else was just meh.\n\nSERVICE:\nMediocre. They were nice people but...very unattentive. I asked my server for water/tea 3 times before she finally came to refill it. She also forgot to give me my take-out box until I mentioned it for the second time..sigh.\n\nWAIT TIME:\n30 minutes on a Sunday night. Place is pretty small (maybe can fit 20 people MAX). \n\nTIP: Be prepared to wait OUTSIDE in the freezing cold, so bring a jacket OR get take out!\n\nTIP #2: If you want things more spicy, ask for the spicy sauce! They bring you a bottle of spicy sauce to lather spiciness onto your food :)", "author": "Evelyn S."}

Understandably so, we have no K-town here. Koreans can't settle in J-town, that would be absurd. They can't settle in Chinatown either, that would be weird. So they randomly take the outskirts of certain neighborhoods with seemingly no appointed settlement--if I recall correctly, I believe parts of the Richmond and Sunset? The rest end up in SMELL.A.\n\nA big highlight of this place is the affordable prices. Everything is around $9-13, which is very reasonable for Korean. We ordered the Bul Kogi, Seafood Pancake, Seafood Tofu Soup, and the Sweet & Spicy Chicken wings. We decided that everything except the Bul Kogi was delicious. It was a little dry and tasteless, or maybe we're just not fans of that type o' meat.\n\nIn conclusion, ordering 4 dishes for two people was way too much.

She later came back and apologized for forgetting but it didn't really matter because it was so tasty anyways.   We had the sweet & spicy chicken wings too, which were more Chinese flavored Korean-style chicken wings, but were really good nonetheless.  The banchan was good, but most importantly about that was that the kimchi was really good, a crucial sign of a good Korean restaurant.

Staff is friendly and attentive.  Food arrived fairly quickly (and thankfully there was a nice array of banchans as we were famished), and devoured just as quick.  Here's what we ordered:\n\nSpicy pork arrived on a sizzling plate and was still sizzling, just the way I like it.  (Strange to me when grilled meats aren't sizzling on a sizzling plate.)  Pieces of pork were cut not too thin and not too thick and were seasoned very nicely.  Wish it was spicier though.  Love the white and green onions that arrive below and atop, respectively.\n\nKimchi jigae was flavorful, spicy and had beef and tofu!  The tofu was more a firm tofu rather than a silken tofu, which was fine by me because if I wanted silken I would have ordered tofu jigae.  \n\nTteokbokki was somehow flavorful and hearty yet light at the same time.  Ingredients were fresh with plenty of rice sticks, fish cakes, mushrooms, green and white onions, kimchi and zucchini.  The sauce was just the right amount of spicy.\n\nA fair amount of people around us were having dol sot bibimbap, and is also one of my favorite dishes.

The side dishes they give you at the beginning of your meal were good. The Bibimbap was as good as any other place, nothing quite special but it was good. It could have used more vegetables though, because I kind of felt like i was eating a lot of rice. It came with spinach, bean sprouts, carrots, a few more varieties of vegetables, and a fried egg on top with the red sauce on the side. I really liked the Dukbokee. The texture was a little on the chewy side, but that's how I like it, and the sauce was the perfect amount of spicy. (I can't take spicy very well, so I guess it wasn't SUPER spicy if that's what you like). It also game with a lot of fish cakes and vegetables. They kept our water and hot tea filled, and great service overall.\n\nThough we didn't order much, I noticed many other tables around us also ordered Bibimbap, bulgogi, the seafood pancake, and something that looked like noodle soup.

The restaurant is relatively small, but could accommodate a group of 6-7 people. (I doubt if they would have space for more than 10.)  Most of the tables are for 2-4 people, and there aren't that many tables to begin with. They don't take reservations so it's first come first serve.  \n\nThe restaurant atmosphere feels like sitting in a friend's house for dinner. The service is fast, attentive, and very, very friendly. Apparently the owner knows my friend by name since she goes back there all the time.  \n\nTheir menu delivers quality homemade food, though on the smaller portion side. Our favorites are the kimchi fried rice, kimchi pancake, bibimbap and the cold noodle. Their fried dumplings are a bit too bland. They offer generous ban chan.  The tea they serve is the quality barley tea. The friendly owner even brought out and showed us the barley tea package they used!\n\n\nThe bill comes in surprisingly cheap for a group of people. One of the down sides is that the place is packed and there are always people waiting, so we felt like we had to leave soon after the meal. I would go back to try other items in the menu.", "author": "Elle W."}

Based on the great reviews, I thought, \"why not.\" It was a cute family run business and I really like kimchi (I know, lame excuse...)\n\nKorean restaurants give you side dishes while you wait for your order. These are the equivalent to American appetizers with the only difference: they are free. I will say that these dishes met or exceeded expectations. \n\nMy biggest disappointment was the dish that I had ordered, which, sadly, I forgot the name. It was a rice cake stir fry with meat (pieces of beef and tons of fish cake) and vegetables (aka too much green onion). The dish really wasn't that great. There was barely any beef and trust me, I overhauled the entire plate to find scraps of it. They compensated for the lack of beef with an overdose of fish cake. And as mentioned earlier, the dish's vegetable was pretty much all green onion. It wasn't worth it.\n\nOrder something else.", "author": "Lily Z."}

Ok, if the restaurant is full and there are so many people waiting outside, how bad can the food be?\n\nFinally seated after a little over an hour. The establishment is tiny, which is probably why there was a long wait. There are probably 10 or so tables inside. Staff is friendly but not swift.  Seemed a little inexperience.

What's also strange is that the owner came by to tell us how to add the hot sauce to the bi bim bap. You think if we knew how to order bi bim bap, we would know what to do with the hot sauce. Not to mention my friend is half Korean.\n\nOverall, the prices here are about $2 cheaper than most Korean restaurants. However, you really pay for what you get. Strange flavors and small portions.

It's pretty small, is starting to get crowded, and I'm afraid that it'll be hard to get a table once word gets out about this place.  The dishes here are very reasonably priced when it comes to Korean food!  Where else can you get a full serving of Kalbi in SF for only 12.99?  Their other bbq meats, like bulgogi, pork, and chicken, are even cheaper.  Such a great deal, and the food is so good too!  \nI also like that they are very generous with their free side dishes.  It's true that you only get 6 side dishes, which isn't much compared to some other Korean places...but they refill those side dishes as you finish them!  They actually refilled our sides twice during our meal, and they were super nice to boot.  I am definitely going to be coming here more whenever I want Korean food.", "author": "Tyler C."}

Of course it all depends on what flavors you lean towards, but if you like a little more tang and zip, you'll probably prefer the Manna wings. Don't believe me? Try them yourself.\n\nAnother awesome thing about this place is that, compared to other Korean restaurants, this place is a little bit cheaper. I often find myself struggling to get out of dinner for under $20 for myself (entree + apps, not including drinks) at most Korean places, but this place makes it really easy.\n\nI can recommend their BBQ as well (they make it about as good as any place in the city).\n\nFor Sunset's best Korean food option, check this place out.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

Even beyond our neighborhood, if you want authentic Korean food that's cheap, I actually can't think of any decent places.  There are good Korean restaurants in Richmond, but you often have to pay over $20 for a dish - granted, it does gets you an abundant number of banchan along with other freebies and the meat portion is generous, but sometimes you just want a simple bibimbap without launching into a full feast.  \n\nManna gives you exactly that.  For less than $10, you get a nice bowl of bibimbap with delicious veggies and a little bit of tasty beef.  Yes, I think I got 5 pieces of beef altogether, but I don't mind that, given the cheap price. \n\nThe couple that runs the place is beyond nice and accomodating.  We overhear them patiently explaining to a couple next to us that every dish on the menu comes with banchan and you can get refill on banchan up to 10 times!

Been here several times and it's always consistent.  Most dishes are $10 or less ($1 cheaper during lunches), which is hard to find these days for Korean restaurants.  And you get just as much food as places that charge $15/dish.  The place is a little small, probably fits about 25-30 people, and there is a line during peak hours as a result.  I recommend going off-peak hours as they're pretty wide open.\n\nRecommend:\nSeafood Tofu Soup - Very good and lots of ingredients\nSeafood Pankcake - It's very tasty and has lots of toppings. Many other places charge in the mid-teens for this.\nBulgogi - It's like most other places, but cheaper\nBibimbap - Pretty good, but given that it's almost the same price as the meat entrees, would recommend those instead.  It's rare that the meat entrees are similarly priced to Bibimbap, but quality is still good and consistent. \n\nThey also give you unlimited banchan and rice.

This korean restaurant has a variety of different typical korean items.\n\nSince this was my first time there, I can only rate the dishes that we ordered, all which were pretty tasty:\n\n1.   The ddukppoki was very soft and moist as was the fish cake, indicating it was cooked properly.  It was a lot better than Toyose's version of the dish.\n\n2.   The bibimbap in the clay pot was nice as well.  I've never actually had bibimbap in a clay pot, I usually have it cold with the veggies and whatnot, so it was a nice experience.  I wish the go ju jang sauce was a little bit spicier to add a little more kick to the bibimbap, but I think overall, the dish was pretty good.\n\n3.   The spicy bbq pork dish was not bad, though I think I have had better in terms of flavoring, but it was tender and cooked properly, so I can't complain.\n\n4.   The side dishes were pretty typical for a korean restaurant.  The only side dish I didn't particularly like were the salted anchovies because they were really hard when eating them compared to ones I have had before.\n\n5.   They serve tea with rice grains boiled in it which is a familiar taste when I've been to many Korean restaurants in Southern California which has a nice, refreshing taste for my palate.\n\nThank goodness this restaurant replaced Little Bangkok because that place sucked (had the worst service and terrible food).  Manna had really good service and they kept refilling our tea and was attentive to our needs for the table which was excellent.

This isn't the place to go for people who like a little charcoal/burnt taste to their meat.\n\nBulgogi beef was really soft and tender. The marinade wasn't that good since it tasted like watery beef. Kalibi beef was chewy and had quite a bit of fat, but it was well marinated. The Korean wings were not what I expected... it tasted a bit more like orange chicken wings.

If you want the best experience of this place, I highly suggest not going when the male manager is there, especially when you're with a group of 5+ people. \n\ni am highly disappointed in you, Manna. I ate here before with my friends and i felt its food is quite delicious for a Korean restaurant in SF. My grandma was craving Korean food so I suggested Manna. I knew beforehand that the restaurant is small. Roughly 8-10 small tables that fit about 2-4 people each. \n\nWe, a group of 7 decided to head over there around 5:00pm before the dinner rush. My aunt arrived earlier by herself separately and tried to get us a table or at least on the wait list. (They DO NOT take reservations.) My aunt told the manager that we have a group of 7 and the other 6 will be here 10-15 minutes. My aunt's car was parked right in front of the restaurant and decided to sit in her car to wait for us since it was cold. My aunt suggested the tables next to the main window. The manager agreed. \n\nDuring those 10-15 mins, apparently there was an unofficial rule of \"first come first serve, as long as your entire party is here\". There are three tables by the main window parallel to the front door, enough to fit our group if pushed together. The smallest of the three tables was empty. The second one was empty. At the third table the customers were almost finished with their meal. Apparently two more groups of people came during those 10-15 minutes and the manager seated them at those empty tables. At the bigger empty table, they ordered immediately and received their food. The smaller table's customers didn't even settle down yet. \n\nWithin 15 minutes exactly at around 5:15pm, I and the rest of the family arrived, I wasn't aware of this problem and only assumed our table will be ready. Unfortunately that is a foolish thought. My aunt told me she witnessed the manager give away those tables that would've been ours. I went inside the restaurant with my aunt, hoping we'd have our tables but those customers were eating away. I recognized the manager from the previous time with my friends. He wasn't the friendliest guy but he didn't serve us at our table last time so I disregarded him when i was with my friends. But this time, I saw the manager's character. I noticed some tension between my aunt and the manager. My aunt reiterated many times that the other 6 will be here in 10-15 minutes but the manager said he had to sit the other customers who came later than my aunt first because they had everyone there. My aunt complained that the manager didn't even bother trying to tell her about this. But the manager backfired saying he walked around and outside a bunch of times but never saw my aunt. This kept going back and forth between the two. \n\nWe were willing to wait for the two bigger tables to finish but my aunt and i noticed this. There was an empty table for two that the smallest table customers could move to on the right side of the restaurant since they haven't even started yet. We asked the manager if they could move so we can have that table but he refused to do so. Instead he suggested if we all can sit separately since there were other tables finishing up. Why? Why do we need to when he promised the window tables and failed to do so and then blaming it on us not being there? More of this bantering that would've been avoided if the manager was better at organizing table space but he refused to give in. I looked at the staff in the back. I could tell they were looking at us with a slight hope to help us but they never tried. \n\nIt was 5:30pm when we all decided to walk away. There was no winning over this manager who clearly lacked customer service training. We eventually walked over to Marnee Thai on 9th & Irving who, despite being almost the same size restaurant, were more accommodating and welcoming to a group of 7.", "author": "Vickie C."}

Or the quality, as it tasted pretty good - juicy and tender, with nice cuts of meat! (not just fat) Came on a sizzling platter atop some nicely cooked onions. Pretty great for the price!\n\ndwinjang chige ($8.99) - bean paste soup with veggies and tofu. I was in a bland sort of mood and so I thought this would really hit the spot. Unfortunately I didn't know that jalapenos are added and I'm really bad at eating spicy so this kinda ruined it for me. The soup itself came with a great bunch of veggies and also some beef thrown in there (happy surprise!) but I just couldn't enjoy it too much with my mouth on fire. \n\nEach of our orders came with a bowl of rice and we also had a good spread of banchan: anchovies, kimchi, fish cake (!!), pickled daikon, and bean sprouts. They come unlimited and if you ask, the waitress will come by and bring you new dishes of them! The portion sizes of the entrees were pretty hefty and we had enough leftover for a lunch, but we're also small eaters. Service was friendly and attentive and we had our side dishes and tea re-filled frequently. Parking can be found a few blocks away... I'll be back!", "author": "Janey L."}

I like the casual dinner Korean concept similar to the one I've experienced in numerous of places in LA so I gave it a try.  \n\nI have to disagree with the majority of the other reviewers.  The portion is moderate.. not huge.  The price is looks attractive but I think that is because the portion are smaller.  In terms of the big test, the taste:  I was disappointed.  We ordered the Kal Bi, Bulgogi, Beef Bibimbap, and the chicken wings.  \n\nThe Kai Bi is much much smaller that I anticipated.  The price is attractive, $14 but its portion is small compare to if I go to a traditional Korean  BBQ.  The taste: Its cooked in the kitchen but it didn't have much distinctive BBQ flavor.  A bit bland if you ask me but my daughter who is 8, chowed down on it.  I think the traditional BBQ have the edge on this even though its pricier but its definitely have better value.  \n\nThe Bulgogi.. the biggest disappointment of all.  For the most part it was over cooked, and you know its over cooked when the slices of beef are seared crisped.  Since it was overcooked, it lacked the juice and favor.  Dumb downs on this. \n\nAs for the Bibimbap, I ordered the stone kind so I get for the good stuff where the expectation is the rice is crispy and adds more flavor.  Its a mehh... For the most part, the rice in the bibimbap tastes like the pain ole rice.  \n\nThe only thing that got me going was the chicken wings.  The chicken wings was lightly battered so its not so heavy.  I admit, I was expecting the wings to be drenched in heave flavorful sauce but it wasn't.  It was nicely dressed and flavorful without all the sugar coating sauce.  If you come to this place, the wings is a must try.  \n\nConsidered that I came early and still waited for half an hour, this place is definitely not worth the wait.  I just have better.", "author": "Rama L."}

I'd really recommend the Seafood Rice/Vegetables Stone Pot dish, it has a little bit of everything and was delicious. The Seafood Tofu Soup is on the salty side but enjoyable if paired with rice.

They have decent lunch specials from 11-3pm that range ~$7. The menu is pretty standard  with portions being average. \n\nWe ordered 5 dishes: the seafood pancake, the seafood tofu soup, the kimchi spicy pork, the beef short ribs, and the fried chicken. The fried chicken was quite bland and I recommend getting the sweet and spicy if you are craving some fried foods. The seafood pancake was average at best. A little bit soggy with not that much seafood. The beef short ribs were ok. Not over cooked and the dish was about 8 ribs total. The best dish was probably the kimchi spicy pork. The dish is good hot but when it started cooling down my good friend noticed that it tasted like ketchup which I also agree. There was also not that much pork (maybe 8 pieces total). The total came out to be $60 after tax and tip. \n\nService was decent although I feel this place is understaffed  especially at max capacity. The food came out about 15 mins after we ordered and I feel this place can get busy at night since there isnt that much seating. \n\nOverall, a decent value for korean food especially for the lunch special. I think this place compares to Shin Toe Bul Yi on taraval.

Busy and no tables were available so we decided to take the food to go. We were about to go somewhere else and eat but then we asked the cashier how long the wait would be and it was only 10 minutes! Not 15 not 25, but only 10 minutes. In city time, that is absolutely amazing. \nThe servers, cashiers, and staff did not look rushed. The all looked so happy and calm. We went for a stroll and as promised 10 minutes later got our dinner. \nThe Kalbi was juicy, just the way Korean BBQ should be. The side dishes were plentiful, and fresh. Healthy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "Yesterday my husband and I were visiting a friend in San Francisco. We decided to go to this restaurant near my friend's house for lunch after hiking from Lands End because we saw many people waiting outside and we thought it must be a very nice place to eat.  We also love Korean food.  But this proved to be a completely wrong decision.  I had the worst restaurant experience ever in my life.\n\nThe owner was extremely rude to us.  He ignored my request for hot water (I do not drink cold water because it causes pain to my belly), he was extremely rude and arrogant to us, he removed my husband's dish, and the most terrible thing is, he threw us out before we even began to eat.  And when I recalled, I realized that he intentionally skipped us when calling guests from the waiting list.  I cannot think of any reasons of his behavior.  The only reason I can come up with is he has some issues with us Chinese guests \n\nLet me tell the whole story so that you can judge if my suspicion is reasonable.\n\nWhen we passed this restaurant, we saw many people waiting outside so we decided to give it a try.  My friend went inside, put her name on the waiting list, and asked the owner how long we had to wait.  The owner said about 20-30 minutes.  Because there was still a long time, we went to a bakery across the street and bought some cookies.  I was checking time frequently to make sure we did not get back late.  \n\nWhen we came back 15 minutes later, my friend went to check with the owner but saw that her name was crossed out from the list -- we obviously missed when it's our turn.  So she put her name on the waiting list again.  This time we decided to wait right outside because we did not want to miss again.  My friend told us that thonly two groups of people were before us, one 2 people and the other 3 people. \n\nWe waited for one whole hour outside, thirsty and hungry.  Then a waitress came out to call the names.  I went closely to listen just in case she called us.  She called the first name but the group were gone.  She called the other name and 3 people went inside.  I checked the name list and knew that we were next.  The waitress went inside.  After some time, the owner, a middle-aged Korean man, came out to call guests. He called \"Hana\" instead of my friend.  A group of 3 entered. I was surprised we were not called.  Then he called another name, not my friend again.  I went to him and asked to see the name list.  I saw that two names below my friend's were crossed out.  I was confused.  But before I could ask, he went inside rashly.  I told my friend. She went inside to check.  The owner said he called my friend's name already.  After the whole thing, I re-thought all the details and realized that he was LYING.  Two reasons: 1. Why didn't he cross my friend's name if he had called us? He did so the first time, and I saw the waitress crossed out names when no one answered.  2. I paid very close attention whenever they came out and was very certain they didn't call us.\n\nBut at the time, we did not think too much and went inside.  Because of my thirsty, I finished my tea and my husband's.  Then the first meal was served to my husband.  I was so thristy so I turned around to see who's available. The owner was bring a tea pot around.  After he came back to the counter where is close to our table, I requested, \"Sir, could you please give me some hot water?\" \n\nIt seemed he did not hear me, so I repeated for at least three times.  He finally came, but with a cold water pot.  \n\nI said, \"I am sorry but I cannot drink cold water. Could you please give me some hot water?\"\n\nHe did not look at me. Instead, he was looking up all the time. And he filled my glass like he did not hear what I was saying at all. I repeated my words several times.  But he did not look at me or respond at all.\n \nSo my husband asked, \"Sir, did you hear my wife's words? She cannot drink cold water.\"\n\nThe owner suddenly became terribly angry and yelled at my husband, \"Why are you mad at me? Why are you mad at me?\"\n\nWe were extremely confused and did not know what to respond for this sudden and unexpected accusation.  Then what is even more bizard, the owner TOOK my husband's dish and PUT IT AWAY.  Then he asked my husband to go outside with him.  Both my friend and I were worried the owner might beat my husband so we followed. \n\nWe followed the owner to the corner of the street. Then he said, \"I REFUSE TO SERVE YOU.\"\n\nMy husband asked, \"Why?\"\n\nHe simply said, \"Why are you mad at me?\" and repeated, \"I refuse to serve you.\"\n\nYelp does not allow me to write more than 5000 words. But anyway, we felt very humiliated and left.  I could not think of any reason why the owner performed so rudely and aggressively to us. I think the only reason is that he recognized we are Chinese from my friend's name, which arose his inexplicable aggression towards us from the beginning. I feel sad if he really is a racist.  I have a lot of Korean friends and respect Korean people.", "author": "Yueran Y."}

Saw a small, quaint Korean place and knew it had to be good if groups of people were willing to wait. Yelp reviews confirmed it (have I ever mentioned that I spend way too much time looking up restaurants on this site? haha)! Brought my parents here a couple weeks ago and came again with a friend last week. This review will focus on my first encounter, though my second was just as good!\n\nGuesstimated eight small tables, no more than two to four at each, but groups can push a couple together if lucky enough to get empty ones next to each other. The place has a nice, family-owned, homey feel, and everyone was very friendly.\n\nMy picky parents' appetites were satiated, which rarely happens when I pick a place for us to eat. They're not huge fans of Korean food, but perhaps Manna converted them? Their conclusion was that it was okay, but I consider that pretty good, considering that they typically dislike all the restaurants I bring them to. The three of us shared the dol-sot bibimbap, bulgogi, and clear yam noodles. The bulgogi serving was a good amount and we could barely finish it with the other dishes. The meat came in medium bits and had nice flavor, without being too moist or dry, and was such a good lunch deal (almost all LD's are under $10, btw!). Though obviously not barbecued on a grill, the effort and style would've pushed the price up, and it was tasty. The seafood bibambap was equally good, though without much seafood. The crispy bits at the bottom got me though, and there were plenty of the beansprouts, veggies, etc. The yam noodles were alright, yummy but not better than what I've had at other places.\nService was kind and on point, refilling our tea cups several times throughout our meal. I love me some corn tea, so that was a definite plus! Free rice and banchan refills too... what?! Whispered the happy news loudly to my parents and took advantage of it.\n\nThe bill came to about $30, which was unheard of for such a satisfying, full meal! So happy to have discovered this place and am already planning on returning ASAP :) My college student budget declares thank you, food deities, for bestowing this gift of a yummy, well-priced Korean restaurant! \n\nNote: I haven't had a dinner experiences here though, so if I do eat here some night I will update my review on how it went!", "author": "Tina Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-14", "description": "Irving street patrons! Please support your local Korean spot and this is the place to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nYes, how ingenious to FINALLY have a little Korean spot, it took this area long enough! I can only give this place 4 stars because I have another Korean spot that is my loyal fave but....I will give you the pros and cons as I much as I can, unlike the whiny person that complained about the lack of side dishes.... \nPros: This place has a menu that is comfort foods that goes well with their soju and beer selection as well as the palate of the demographics. It's simplified due to the selection of side dishes that are served. I'll tell you this though, it's a start up little spot, those side dishes are simply appetizers that wet the palate. Note, if you have an establishment that has been around for awhile, you will deliver more side dishes but for now, the owners are seeing what is popular and what is not with the patrons. Why waste money on side dishes that the patrons won't eat or like, simple economics and a smart one. \nHere's another reason why they don't serve that many side dishes (yet), their main dishes were made really well, like my grandmother made. The number 38 (dumpling soup) was as authentic as my grandmother's hugs and her own mandu soup. I wanted to cry because it tasted soooo amazing and definitely prepared with care. I also had the dolsot bibimbap, super hot so that I didn't get jipped by not having crunchy rice on the bottom like some places, it was a good amount with good accoutrement's and the egg and meat were just right. \nLook here, complainer who probably can't tell what is good and what isn't at a Korean restaurant and probably gets full from the side dishes thus he cannot tell if his main dish is actually fantastic, stop your crying and go somewhere else that's crappy. The service was on top of it, the owner was so super nice and accommodating, I asked if they had duk (thinly sliced rice cake) in the mandu guk and he said it wasn't on the menu but he added it anyways. Soooo good, and they REFILLED our several side dishes as we ate them with our main dish. I hope this place thrives and continues their quality of Korean food, they have all the things I love on their menu and I will be back to sample more! \n\nThe wait, not long at all, and it was WAY SHORTER THEN NAMU, (I hated the wait at Namu, it's trendy and not worth the HOUR AND A HALF WAIT!!!!!, the food isn't spectacular)\nThe cons for this place, parking is a b-cth but it's worth it here.", "author": "Natasha C."}

It was definitely pretty flavorful, but not very spicy, even though I ordered it spicy. It was about $10 at lunch I think. The owner or manager or whatever was really nice and friendly. We came in as a group from work and he gave us the lunch prices even though he said that they do not offer those on holidays. Since we were working on Columbus Day, which shouldn't even be a celebrated day, he said he would five us the pricing. Everyone else seemed to really like their food as well. My coworker got the bibimbap, which he said was great. Another friend got a rice dish that she really liked. I think this is a pretty solid pick overall and left feeling very satisfied with my meal. Might make it back, but it depends how long I work here because there are just so many restaurants to try in the area.", "author": "Miguel V."}

I ordered medium spicy and it wasn't too spicy but it was really good when you pour it over rice! The bulgogi and kalbi here is also very delicious! the food is really fresh and authentic , you can tell they make it on the spot freshly! They also have really good tea here!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-05", "description": "So I was searching \"korean\" on yelp one day because i just came back from a trip to korea this summer and i started yearning the soup I fell in love with over there. Unless I'm in korea or LA I try to avoid eating too much korean food in San Francisco as Korean food is often associated with vocaburarly like \"pricey\" or \"expensive\".Bi-ssa yo. hehe  To my surprise I find Manna which just opened up recently. I didn't know until my sister checked this place out but Manna bought out the same location a thai restaurant used to be. I was ecstatic to find out a new korean restaurant opened up in the Sunset. What caught my attention mostly was the rating on the payscale. Only one \"$\"! Do you know how rare that is to see that attached to a korean restaurant in SF? \n\nSo I finally check this place out with family on a Sunday evening. There was 5 of us. The place is packed when we arrive. AFter a short wait of like 5 minutes we were quickly seated. Our waitress a slightly elderly women served us and was very friendly. Despite the amount of tables she had to manage by herself she still promptly took our orders and came back shortly with water and tea. The wait for food was not that long maybe like 10 minutes. When the food arrived it came at quick succession one after the other. Our table even though quite large was barely able to accommodate 5 large dishes plus the appetizers they give you for free. From the top of my head we orderd dolsat seafood bibimbap, pajeon(seafood pancake), japchae, beef stew, and something else. I forgot the last dish but the most memorable food to me was the japchae. It has the perfect amount of oil and the noodles were probably the best I've eaten in SF. Portions were decently large and by the end of dinner we were all stuff. The total bill came out to $50. Not bad for 5 dishes and appetizers.\n\nI definitely recommend this place if you are craving korean food and want to save some moolah. Manna is a welcomed addition to the sunset and a refreshing beginning to good affordable korean food.", "author": "Jude N."}

The place is tiny maybe 7 tables?  It's located on a corner with big wide windows and is extremely well lit at night.  I felt kind of self conscious eating because I'm sure people driving/passing by were looking in and can see and judge my eating habits haha.  I was extremely hungry and kept going back and forth.  I even thought about getting two meals, but then I looked up and saw the big windows and opt to get the seafood tofu soup only.  This is the first time I ever finished my entire soup bowl!!  I usually finish the seafood pretty quickly and get tired of the soup and the outrageous amount of tofu leftover, however this place passed the test.  I was extremely full though so I don't know if it's a good thing for me but it just shows how good their tofu soup is.  The only thing I have to complain about is WHERE IS THE EGG??  My favorite part is cracking the egg and eating the semi raw yolk.  (I'm a huge egg lover so I was extremely sad and disappointed.)  Other than the missing egg it was delicious.  Their side dishes are also great.  And I must commend them for their customer service.  I think it was only a couple serving and they were so quick and attentive.  I asked for water and bc it took a while, I assumed the guy forgot, however he came with a beautiful glass of water soon after that thought.  Even my friend said \"Oh! He remembered!!\"   Great great job.  I'll definitely be back because the two guys sitting next to me got kalbi and now I want it!", "author": "Tammy N."}

One, the prices.  Everything is super reasonably priced (entrees under $10 and $5 for a large Korean beer).  It's great to have the option to go to a Korean restaurant and spend less than $20 per person for food you don't have to cook yourself.  Sometimes that's ok but it's nice to have another option.  Second reason Manna is a winner is:  I LIKE THEIR KIMCHEE.  I don't care if it's \"authentic\" or not.  I've been trying kimchee everywhere it's served thinking I'll like it eventually but never do.  Until Manna.  I still don't love it and I don't know why I feel the need to like it but that's not really important.  Probably because it's such a Korean staple.  They only serve about 6 side dishes but this was the first time I have actually liked ALL of them, including the kimchee.  My seafood soft tofu soup totally hit the spot on a foggy summer SF night.
