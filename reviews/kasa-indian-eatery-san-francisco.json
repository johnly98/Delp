But I just am hoping....\nI really like(d) this place, so I'm hoping management will read this and do something about it. I love Kasa. The flavors are awesome and the food is unique. *However* Lately they've been slipping. My boyfriend and I usually ordered two Kati rolls a piece and an order of samosas. (It's really a shame when they run out of the samosas!) Today I ordered my rolls and something(s) went horribly wrong. When I saw the person serving me dousing the roti in oil and then slapping it on the grill I should have just stopped. When they started the 4 rolls I asked for a little cilantro and they were quite heavy handed. No big deal. I can live. But then I ordered two chicken tikka masala rolls and it got worse. My server gave me plain chicken tikka. When I pointed out the mistake they just took some sauce from the chicken tikka masala and poured it over the dry chicken tikka. That's not chicken tikka masala. That's chicken tikka, with masala sauce. The rolls were so over stuffed they weren't able to actually be wrapped. It was sort of like an taco? All of the masala sauce ended up stuck to the foil. The kicker was when I went to retrieve my vegetarian taco/rolls from the white cardboard container they had been sitting in. There was so much oil on the roti that it had actually leaked out and pooled at the bottom of the box. It was disgusting. I just couldn't bring myself to eat it. This isn't the first time in the recent past that the staff's attitude has actually ruined my experience. I really love this place and would love if the staff cared about their jobs.

We actually saw the Kasa on Pine and Polk while out at lunch and next thing I knew, R suggested that we should get some Kasa for dinner. The Kasa on Castro was much closer to where he lived. The restaurant itself is also small but located in the corner of a very cute neighborhood. \nHe got the roll that comes wrapped in naan bread with chicken tikka. He really liked it. He had also ordered it with spicy sauce but for some reason, the sauce ended up being all the way at the end of the roll so he didn't really taste any spiciness until he was almost finished with it. \nI got the platter w/ the cauliflowers and tikka masala. It came with this strange salad w/ a yogurt dressing. Not my favorite part of the platter, I admit. However, everything else tasted pretty good. The goo alobi was soft and tender. Sadly, I can't say the same for the chicken tikka masala. The chicken pieces was a bit tough for me. \nWe had also gotten drinks. I loved their chai and when it's cooled a bit, so refreshing. The mango lassi was not like the other kinds we had drank before. There were pieces of spices mixed in it, like cardamon, and ended up having a spicy aftertaste. \nAnyways, I can see us getting takeout from Kasa when we can't decide between Mexican and Indian food.", "author": "Michelle R."}

It shouldn't be necessary to repeat an order three times, especially when it is simple. What's hard to understand about \"take out\" or \"to go\"...? Recently, I've been getting a lunch of chicken on a large tortilla-like nan and a lassi. The price? $11.99. Fine. Yesterday, the employee who needed things explained three times charged $16.99 for the same meal. When I pointed this out, he began a mystifying explanation about how, if I had ordered it under a different name, it would have been $16.99 blah blah blah. I tried to email and call the owner. No response. Anyway, I'd caution against patronizing Kasa until they hire employees who don't rip off loyal customers.", "author": "adrian b."}

You are not great and you are expensive so the way people return is based on convenience of location, business options and customer service. Serving roti in substitution for rice is cheaper so you make more profit on the Thali doing this and satisfy the customer. You are not our exclusive Indian, in fact ALL of your competition does this for us. Over the years I have noticed you become emptier and emptier. It is because of your horrible business practices.

The kati roll was kinda small but had enough meat and nice flavor. A bit of kick in the end. B/c it has been a while since it was prepared, the wrap was a bit soggy. The one I had from the food cart in NYC was better. The half portion chicken tikka masala was actually a great deal!! So much chicken! I ate it with the samosa b/c the samosa were not super flavorful and I needed a medium to eat the chicken with. It ended up being the perfect combo. Crispy samosa with soft potato was bland by itself but with the masala, it was a wonderful meal. I thought I wouldn't be full b/c the kati roll was kinda small but the 2 samosas were very filling along with the tub of chicken tikka masala. \n\nYummy food!

I would say that this place flows like Chipotle does...fast casual food. Most of us decided to order the thali plate (platter with your choice of two main course, roti, handmade bread, slow-simmered daal, lentils, rice, veggie salad, chutneys and raita, yogurt). I went with the tikka chicken masala and the gobi aloo (cauliflower and potato). The chicken wasn't freshly cooked and was a little dry but I'm sure with more turnover the meat would've been more fresh...they just need to anticipate customer flow and not make too much and have proteins sitting out too long. \n\nThe rest of the platter was very colorful, full of variety and pretty tasty. I don't think the spices are the most authentic, but suitable for the general American palate. For Indian food the $13 cost of the thali after taxes seemed a bit overpriced but at least I wasn't left hungry when I left. I also added on a mango lassi to help clean the palate and it was the perfect complement to the meal. It would've been nice to have some free hot chai like you'd find at most other Indian/Pakistani sit down places...but not here.\n\nOverall, I like the simplicity of the place and the quick service. You can kind of tell that they pull from some elements of Chipotle in terms of the menu and the plating of the thali. I also liked the big communal table in the middle of the store which is good for a group of 8.", "author": "Sam L."}

Looks like the restaurant forgot that spices are to be used, not displayed as decor. I had a thali with lamb and karahi paneer for dinner. Both were nearly tasteless with the karahi paneer being worse, lacking turmeric (my Indian soul revolts at this sacrilege), other spices, even enough salt and flavor. The 'roti' was a machine made pita, no authenticity. The staff tonight were Hispanic and no offense, but if they were the cooks, they probably lacked skills in Indian cooking.

Everything was plated beautifully which made me even more eager as we were at the cash register paying. They had a picture of chai tea in cups that read \"best chai in SF\" or something along those lines. That marketing worked because I totally bought into it and hey, you don't know unless you try right? Even though it was pre-made, they didn't let me down.

It's hard to do everything all at once when orders come in, but it needs to be done by order for certain items.  Their mango lassi has cardamom seeds in it, and those seeds steeped in lassi make it taste like a cardamom lassi, and not in a good way. It was also too thick.

Ordering a kati roll is like ordering a Chipotle burrito, ordering a thali platter is like ordering a burrito bowl. \n\nService: Like I said, its a Indian Chipotle.

Grab all the utensils and napkins you want, as well as pour yourself some water at the service station next to the register. There is even a fennel palate cleanser/breath freshener, too! Just remember to clean up after yourself. Anyway, the people at the counter are efficient and friendly. They answered my questions about certain plates happily. Also, its super easy to order to-go and just walk to the park if you don't want to eat inside!\n\nAmbiance: Its clean, casual, high ceiling, cute framed pictures, and big windows. You can easily move tables together if you have a big group. It puts off a really relaxed aura, while some places that are packed and bustling make me anxious, Kasa is calm. \n\nFOOD:\nKati Roll - Chicken Tikka Marsala. Its delicious. It looks small but its fantastic. Order one for $4-5 if you're not extremely hungry. Order two, three (or four) if your tummy is roaring and grumbling! You can put whatever dish you like in the Kati Roll, I've only personally tried the Kati Roll with Chicken Tikka Marsala, but order three different Kati rolls if you want to try different dishes OR you can order...\n\nThali Platter - Lamb Curry (if you order adds an extra $1, but its worth it!) + Chicken Tikka Marsala. This is a big plate for $10-11. It has all the sides with salad, lentils and rice. Its freakin' awesome and its HUGE. This is great if you like a variety of different flavors and textures in your meal. Its big and I definitely have to share it with someone. But, I'm a tiny Asian girl so that was to be expected. But, if you have a big big appetite, get the Thali Platter. It also comes with steaming hot roti!\n\nI have to admit I like this place, but its fast food ambiance put me off just a little bit. This area has so many other great restaurants, too. Kasa has some rough competition with the other sit-in restaurants. But, when you can't wait and want a quick and relaxed bite, Kasa's where I would go.", "author": "Vivian C."}

The food was fresh, the meat was tender and juicy and the mouth watering flavors where OUT of this world. Now the meat is chewy, flavorless unrecognizable boneless chicken that is served with bones. Roti rolls taste flat and stale. The once mouthwatering flavors are a thing of the past, now just bland and motionless.

It was quite a sight. Castro went absolutely nuts. Hooray equality!\n\nAnyway, Kasa Indian Eatery was kind of in the thick of all of it so we decided to check it out. \n\nNot bad. Not bad at all. \n\nWhen we got there, there were still a lot of empty tables and a manageable queue but by the time we got our food, the line got pretty crazy and extended all the way to the sidewalk and all the tables had been taken. Good thing there were still some empty stools on the counter by the door. \n\nWe turned to Yelp (as we often do) to help us decide what to order. The Kati Roll was the consensus so we went with that. And besides, we are fans of anything wrapped in a warm blanket of dough. It makes the food feel safe and loved. \n\nWe tried the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Kati Roll and got a few Samosas too. I wasn't too impressed with the Tikka Masala although I think it might have been because we didn't specify to add heat. It lacked that oomph. \n\nThe Lamb was pretty tasty and very tender and I like how it was mixed with some mint chutney and red onions. Yogurt sauce was also scooped onto the plate and it was a perfect compliment to the strong flavors of the curries.\n\nThe samosas were pretty delicious too. Especially slathered in some of that refreshing yogurt sauce.\n\nAll in all, I was fairly delighted with my experience at Kasa and will definitely be back (to try the papadums and the combination plates). The staff is attentive and friendly, the food is cheap and tasty and you can order beer or wine to go along with your meal. \n\nI also appreciate the whole \"serve and bus your own tray\" model. It eliminates the need for paying extra for a service that frankly, we can really do without in most cases.\n\n4.1 stars.", "author": "Angelo B."}

I hate beans, but I actually crave the daal--it is so creamy and satisfying!  \n\nI have scanned some of the reviews, and OMG some people are bonafide a-holes!  Giving the place a crummy review because you went one time (after enjoying many experiences there), and you got a little less food than the previous visits?  Get real--this isn't McDonalds, it's real food!   Would the same people freak out if they ordered at another Indian restaurant and got 10 pieces of paneer in their curry and only 7 another time?  Freaking crazy people.  They also don't weigh the food by the pound when they serve it. \n\nBest part is the employees.  I have eaten at the truck countless times as well as both physical locations, and the employees are very kind and accommodating.  For instance, just politely ask for a little more filling, and they will likely accommodate; or at least try that first before giving a crummy review.  I probably have eaten there 300 times, and I have never noticed a change in the quality of the food.  \n\nNow on the other hand, Samovar used to serve rice pudding with their Indian tea service.

Instead they merely lay out the options and fillings like a burrito place. Hence the star of the show has been relegated to a sideshow and completely lost on the casual customer (which is almost all of them). \n\nFor those who came in late, a Kolkatta Chicken Katti Roll is made thusly (to borrow a word from Alton Brown): Paratha, an egg beaten and cooked on/with the paratha on the tava, chicken tikka, generous portions of juliennes of red-onions and cilantro, a dash of finely chopped green chillies, lime juice and a dash of the \"Chinese\" green chillies ketchup, a pinch of pepper all served up as a wrap. \"Roll\" is Indian for \"wrap\" -- and not a dinner/bread roll. \n\nComing to the aforementioned Kati Rolls, the parathas are a little too thin and does not have the thick, hardy, crispy-on-the-outside Kati rolls as found on the streets of Kolkatta (formerly Calcutta, the erstwhile capital of British India). The onions were sadly limp, and lacked the crunch (they were probably chopped a few hours in advance) that is expected and treasured. The green ketchup is missing but I don't blame them as I don't see this particular condiment in stores. \n\nAll in all, the kati roll is the closest thing to the real deal in these united states and goes a long way in relieving my cravings. And what's more ? They also sell India's best selling cola - \"Thumbs Up\". \n\nI couldn't care less for any of the plated meals. \nLet's Kati Roll baby ! :-)", "author": "Umesh T."}

The restaurant itself was busy and the menu is minimal and the service quick. The prices are decent, especially for the Kati roll, which is in my opinion very much like a soft taco or burrito (but not as big).\n\nI ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala Kati. It's not big enough to merit a full meal, but definitely the size of a generous snack. It's not too heavy but still satiates that need for a little bit of flavor and protein. \n\nI really love Indian food, but this is more like quick serve food (though not nearly as bad as somewhere like Naan N' Curry) and it's not as good as a real sit down Indian restaurant. Because of this, I probably wouldn't order a thali. The thalis I am used to are a bit different than what I saw here. Definitely seems like an ideal food for a food truck, which they have. \n\nMy Kati roll was just ok. I wouldn't dissuade someone from going to Kasa, but it also wouldn't be my first choice. The place itself is rather loud and I can tell that when it gets busy seating might be a problem. \n\nMy biggest gripe is that the chai is tiny and the taste of cardamom or pepper is overwhelming.

I have heard about their food truck from friends and co workers but I haven't been to it myself. I did hear that they only serve their samosas on their food truck which sounds amazing!\n\nMy co workers and I usually come here pretty often and I usually order 2 kati rolls ($4.50 each) and a side of daal ($3). For the Kati rolls you usually pick which dish you want and it is rolled up inside a roti or naan like bread. It is pretty amazing. My favorites dishes for the Kati roll are the Aloo Jeera which is Cumin-spiced saut\u00e9ed potatoes and their chana masala which is the garbanzo beans cooked with spices. I believe the chana masala is only there sometimes for the daily special. When I order the daal, I usually ask them to put a little bit of rice inside which is a nice touch.\n\nI eat a lot and the food is really filling so don't feel that it is necessary to order as much as I did.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-23", "description": "Finding light, fresh, flavorful and authentic North Indian food at a restaurant is almost impossible, not only in the US, but even in India itself (my parents are from India, and I lived there for over a year as an adult, so I know the food quite well). In India, people expect restaurant food to be heavy and fatty (the healthier stuff you can get at home, so why buy it from a restaurant, or so goes the reasoning), and I think most Indian restaurant owners in the US have that same mentality.\n\nThe end result is that 99% of North Indian food in the US is dull, oily and woefully generic (find me a North Indian joint that doesn't have tikka/butter chicken or aloo gobi/mutter paneer and I'll buy you dinner at said establishment).\n\nAs such, I had high hopes for Kasa, which sounded like it was aiming for something different. It looks almost like a Chipotle and you stand in line and pick your dishes. To be fair, the food here was pretty good, but my criticisms stem from a lack of variety and some unusual decisions in how they make standard Indian foods (such as dal and roti).\n\nYou can get either a kati roll ($4.50 a piece for this flaky tortilla-esque bread, filled with your choice of curry) or a thali plate ($10.50, and comes with rice, two curries and some side salads). Unfortunately, the kati rolls are not vegan (the dough is made with butter); similarly, the roti is not vegan (which is amazing to me, as roti is almost always vegan, whereas naan is usually not).\n\nAs such, I opted for the thali plate. Of the five vegetarian curries, only two of them were vegan, which was disappointing. This was sign number one that Kasa is not aiming to offer the simple, light, flavorful Indian food that I dream of.\n\nThe only two vegan dishes were the aloo gobi (sigh, how predictable) and an aloo jeera (potatoes and cumin).\n\nTo make matters worse, Kasa doesn't offer brown rice. As I hate white rice, and they couldn't give me roti (which is traditionally vegan and made of wholewheat), Kasa did offer to give me more of a curry, so I got an extra heaping of the aloo gobi. That was nice of them.\n\nThe food wasn't bad at all. I'd like more variety (two potato dishes is a bit much), and it would be great to have vegan options of dishes that are usually vegan anyway (such as dal), but the food here was about as light and simple as I've found in the US.\n\nIf they had more vegan options for curries, and offered vegan breads (they said they can make vegan bread with advance notice, but it takes them about 40 minutes or more to make the stuff), as well as homemade chai with almond or coconut milk, Kasa would get another star. For the price, too, it's not a bad deal, as you get a pretty filling meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-01", "description": "In our continuing quest for Indian food in San Francisco, we discovered, thanks to something called \"Yelp\", the Kasa Indian Eatery. Yelp's a perfect thingy to find new places to stuff your craw, if you had one, and Kasa was an affordable Indian homestyle that is now bookmarked as a place to go back to if I'm ever again in the area.\n\nTake this place: we'd come off of a Sunday hike to Mount Davidson Park and were looking for an Indian restaurant nearby that was open on Sunday's before 5 PM. Yelp led us to this place on a corner in the Castro on 18th and Noe that is a little like a cafeteria and an Indian Bistro.\n\nYou get two main choices: a wrap called a Kati Roll, which is a filled (with one of the choices below plus marinated onions and chutney) roti rolled like a burrito for a inexpensive $4.50 each (order 2 or 3 for a meal) AND/OR what we had which was a Thali (A Combination Plate).\n \nFor about $11, you get an authentic homestyle round and sectioned stainless steel tray that holds many wondrous things: first, two choices of the following selection:\n\nChicken Tikka \nChicken Tikka Masala\nLamb Curry\nTurkey Kebabs\nKarahi Paneer\nAloo Jeera\nor one of the Daily Veggie Specials (like today's Saag Paneer)\n\nAlso with that you get a Daal (lentil) with basmati rice, a large handmade wheat roti, a veggie salad (that is to plotz for), two chutney's (including a cilantro one) and a large spoonful of raita (yogurt).\n\nThis is a lot of very good food, served up by friendly and efficient people behind a counter. You then can order drinks or a mango lassi ($3), and find your seat in this small restaurant.\n\nWe three did the Thali with: \nChicken Tikka \nChicken Tikka Masala\nKarahi Paneer\nSaag Paneer\n\nAnd we all agreed how real the food tasted (locally sourced or naturally raised BTW) and how much great food you can get for relatively little in SF. The daal was spicy as was the Karahi Paneer, but the perfect tempering of the raita and the fresh flavors and crunch of the fresh salad tempered this spice. With all the fresh, different textures and flavors that were served on a single platter, we found this a welcome change from the many standard Indian buffets we've had in our past, where we would tend to stick only with \"what we knew\".\n\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was meaty with a sauce that did not come with that super-creamy opaque sauce, which allowed you to better taste the moist, grilled nature of the chicken. So many other Tikka Masala cream sauces try to cover up cubes of chicken that had gone dry too many hours ago, but this was done in small batches and the result was simply excellent.\n\nSaag Paneer was really good and generous with their Paneer. Their large roti was really tasty and felt homemade rather than commercial.\n\nThe service tends to remain behind the counter and you are obligated to clear your own table and set your used dishes in a slot under a counter near the drink machine.\n\nBut this rather small place is clean, fast, and delicious; not much more to ask for in the City. We will definitely return.", "author": "Glenn H."}

I love to stop by every now and then when I'm in the Castro, but the spicy-ness level (even without their head-splitting green paste) is too much for my stomach to handle nowadays.\n\nTry out their chicken tikka masala kati roll - has intense flavors.

It sounds like it could be interesting, but somehow you can't get your head around the concept. Well, Kasa has somehow figured out the idea of \"Fresh Indian\" food because it doesn't have the oily residue of most dishes I've had at Indian restaurants. In fact, this isn't really a restaurant but a casual place to grab a bite in the Castro.\n\nIt took over the Castro Tacqueria, which I am embarrassed to say I never tried. I was meaning to, but now it's gone. I didn't even get to say adios. Now I can say namaste. It's a cool open space with counters on one side, a few tables on the other, and a small community table in the middle. The menu is not too complex. You either get the Kati Rolls (one for $5.50, two for $8.95 or three for $11.95) or the $10.95 Thalis, which is described as a \"deconstructed Kati Roll\" and comes with daal, roti, basmati rice and raita. But they come in six varieties, so there's plenty of choice.\n\nI went for the Lamb Curry Thalis, and it was very fresh-tasting without the tell-tale grease you would get at the buffet places. It's amusing that it's served on an aluminum plate tray that looks like it came from an upscale prison. Now usually I have a Diet Coke with something I know will be spicy, but I tried their Belgian beer on tap. I believe it was called \"Tripel Karmeliet\", and that was so smooth. I think this will be a new pit-stop for me. Namaste, dude.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...Fresh Indian...I get it now\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...clean, open, the whole gen-Z vibe\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and young\nTOTAL - 4 stars...finally a fresh alternative in the Castro to the stodgy Bombay Indian well worth a stop", "author": "Ed U."}

After perusing the menu, I decided the best option for me was to try the Thali, which is a homestyle Indian platter with one or two of their house dishes, roti, daal, rice, veggie salad, tomato and cilantro chutneys and raita. I opted to try the Chicken Tikka Masala (marinated, char-grilled chicken in a spicy, creamy tomato sauce) and the Karahi Paneer (wok-tossed Indian cheese with green preppers and tomatoes). Both were fresh and delicious. I especially liked the paneer because it was prepared a way I hadn't had it yet. The sides were delish with one quibble, the roti was a bit greasy for me. Regardless, I ate it all, and it was a decent sized portion.\n\nPS.  I liked the open interior and big wooden table. I don't expect atmosphere in my fast food, but adore it when I get it.

Sad that the kati aren't made with naan, but that would be tough to do at their price point.  Samosas had been sitting a while I think, and were rather on the small side.

Ok, he was hungry, and has taste. I get that. \nNext, he started to sample out of the trash. Really really hungry I guess.  \n\nI should have offered  to buy him something, but if you know who I'm talking about then you know he's unpredictable in a scary way.  So I didn't. \nFinally, some other people got a little freaked out and left.  So he sat down and ate their food.  They were nowhere near done with their food- I think just done with the experience. Gotta admit, I left shortly afterward for the same reasons. Really uncomfortable.\n\nWhat did the guys at the counter do? Appeared to me they did nothing, same as me.  \nMaybe they called the police who just hadnt arrived yet? They might have had  previous experience with this guy too, and were afraid of setting him off.\n\nThe food was actually pretty good ( thus the three stars) but I have not been back.  I think the physical layout of this place ( counter and kitchen in the back) and the fact that there's no real table service is kind of a flaw.

I think the metal plate is the thing that makes it the most interesting. It's nothing special but not a lot of places in the US give metal plates and dinnerware.\n\nAnyways, as for the food. I had the Tikka Masala and lamb curry. I'm not sure what is considered 'authentic' Indian cuisine but the tikka masala i received here was not in its usual thick creamy sauce. Nor was the curry.

I was looking forward to my kati roll and some chai or some Indian soda, Thums Up (cola) or Limca (lemon lime) at Kasa (even though it's in a non-Indian area).  \n\nThe menu is simple - 6 dishes in kati roll form ($5.50 for 1, 2 for $8.95, 3 for $11.95) or thali (plate) form ($10.95).  Order at the counter.  They wrap up the rolls quickly.  Choose a mint chutney or a spicy chutney which they put in your roll.  The roll is about 1/3rd of the size of a burrito.  The homemade roti is thick and chewy, resembling a thick tortilla.  They didn't make chai that day and I really wanted some.   \n\nI had a lamb curry kati roll with spicy chutney and asked for two other rolls to go.  The rolls come with sides of raita (yogurt sauce) and a chopped veggie salad with carrots, cucumbers and red bell peppers.  The dishes I had were all flavorful and not oily.  They tasted distinct from one another as well.  I'm not sure how spicy they are because I asked for spicy chutney for all my wraps.  The meat rolls are mainly meat with hardly any veggies.\n\n* Lamb curry: Juicy cubes of lamb in a brown curry, not much potato, my favorite dish.\n\n* Turkey kebab: Ground turkey reminded me of meatballs. Flavorful but dry.  \n\n* Aloo jeera:  Mainly soft sauteed potato cubes and just a few onions.  Not much else.  A little boring.\n\nI felt the sides were weaker.  It's a shame you don't get to choose the garnish salad.  The one that I had was crunchy and light but didn't have much flavor and didn't taste particularly Indian.  It would be better if you could choose a side, e.g., choose to have dal instead.  The raita was more sour than average.  And also it would be nice if they provided extra chutney on the side.  Instead of a salsa bar, how about a chutney bar or chutney in squeeze bottles?  \n\nThe service was a little odd and overeager.  Since you get your own utensils and I was ready to bus my own table too.  Well, before I had finished my food, one of the employees tried to take my tray away.  Then he took my dirty paper napkin and brought some fresh napkins (I didn't ask him to do this).  I've never had this happen before.\n\nI would come back because the food is affordable, healthy, veg friendly, and fresh.  Also, I still want to try the chai.  They should consider adding dessert options, like some Indian ice cream.  And the chutney bar!", "author": "Lolia S."}

Chicken tikka, lamb curry, and karahi paneer.  I wasn't too impressed with the kati rolls.  The rolls here were very thick and chewy, whereas I was expecting something a little bit more buttery and flaky.  The rolls could be chalked up to opening night jitters, they were probably the largest bottleneck in the evening's production.\n\nThe plate came to just under $12.00. Well-priced for the quality and amount of food I received.\n\nThe chicken was well-cooked and spiced.  I highly recommend complimenting it with the spicy sauce (which was supposedly named \"The Urban Turban,\" but I think that got dropped at the last second).  The paneer was very underwhelming, and got totally lost between the other vegetables, the sauce, and the bread.\n\nThe lamb curry was absolutely delicious.  Big, savory pieces of lamb and delicious soggy chunks of potatoes.  A delicious roll.  If I had to go again I'd get three of these guys.\n\nThe atmosphere isn't anything special -- simple and sparse decor, a few tables and a somewhat cold-looking bar area.

That zany, fuzzy black cat has a way of making me spend more money than I would have otherwise spent if everything weren't so incredibly cheap.    I thought, \"Hey!  I like Indian food.  And I really love cheap Indian food!\"  And so, money was spent and  I ended up with a Groupon to Kasa.\n\nI like the look of the place.  Getting Indian food can kind of be a lengthy and elaborate affair - the lunch buffet, the dinner buffet, the fried appetizers, stewed entrees, and chilled desserts - it's wonderful in its own right, but it also instilled in me a real appreciation for Kasa.  The place is clean and tidy, but relatively small, simplistic, and modern.  You order from a counter, and the selection is rather limited...\n\n...but boy, is it good!  You can either choose a Kathi roll, which I did not, or a Thali plate, which I did.  The plate was huge!  As the menu indicates, it comes with daal, roti, rice, chutneys, salads, and then two entrees - I chose the Aloo Jeera and the Karahi Paneer.  It was perhaps not the most authentic Indian food I've ever had, but it was still exceptionally tasty, and healthy to boot!  There's very often a lot of oil involved in the making of Indian food, but I didn't find anything to be too greasy at all.  The cheese was mild and chewy, the peppers were hot, the daal was just salty enough to provide a nice counterbalance to my starchy-and-simple potatoes - I ate pretty much the whole plate, and that's unheard of for me.\n\nThe service was excellent, too!  They were rather busy, but the servers and bussers took the time to be friendly with my boyfriend and me.  They didn't have the drink I wanted, so I got some chai for free!  Not that it was even necessary - with the Groupon that I had, the entire meal cost nothing!  That's two incredibly hearty dinner plates and a mango lassi for under $30.\n\nSo, to sum up: hearty, healthy Indian food for less money than seems reasonable.  Not the place to go if you're looking for a romantic evening out, perhaps, but otherwise it's an excellent place to indulge all of your naughty Indian food cravings - you won't come away feeling naughty at all!", "author": "Becca S."}

They serve kati rolls, a Kalkota street food that can be described as Indian burrito. It's actually more familiar than it sounds if you've never had it because you choose from a selection of popular Indian dishes such as chicken tikka masala and saag paneer to fill your kati flatbread. They'll add condiments, chutneys, and sauces before they roll it like one would roll a burrito. The roll is served with a cool raita dip, which helps to tame the heat if you chose to go spicy. Most guys will probably need 2 kati rolls to be full, but plenty of girls will be satiated with just one.\n\nHowever tempting it may be to get yours to go, or worse to eat it on the run, DON'T! Kati rolls are delicious and seemingly compact, but pretty damn messy to eat and transport. You need every square inch of the big silver tray they serve your rolls on for the splattery mess you're about to make.\n\nIf eating Indian dishes in burrito form is not your thing, you can opt to do a platter for a little over $10 and eat with real silverware. Either way, you can enjoy your food with beers on tap! I tried the mango lassi, which had too much cardamom for my liking, but still kinda yummy.

I especially loved it when my friends and I arrived only to be among several other groups of Indian patrons.  I give lots of respect to a place that can pull it off.  I like knowing that if I'm going to a place that calls itself \"Indian\" to have Indian patrons - they're the ones that are going to tell you if it's good and/or authentic.  \n\nBeing in the low key mood my friends and I were in that night, we opted to group together to the most bang for our bucks.  I was only hungry for 1 Kati roll that night while my friend, Thomas L., was ready to try 2, which worked out great.\n\nThe place has a very simple atmosphere and can get loud if there are lots of people.

For $4.50 each, I thought I could get away with just ordering two, but they are tiny!! Like, smaller than a mcdonalds snack wrap.

On the restaurant's website, chef and co-owner Anamika says, \"We want to make Indian food that would make our grandmothers proud.\" I do not know what her grandmother thinks, but I love it.\n\nThe Kati rolls include a meat or vegetarian filling of your choice wrapped in a flaky roti with onions and chutney. On my visit last weekend, I ordered one Chicken Tikka Masala roll and the daily special Gobi Aloo roll, a combination of cauliflower and potato. The Chicken Tikka, served in a creamy tomato sauce, is very spicy and delicious. The Gobi Aloo is mild in comparison and lacked the kick of the Chicken Tikka. It would be a good choice if you enjoy less spicy foods.\n\nThe rolls are served with a cool raita sauce in which to dip them. The sauce is an especially great accompaniment to the spiciness of the Chicken Tikka. The rolls are relatively small. I usually order two ($8.95), which makes a nice meal. If you want a snack, order one ($4.95); if you are really hungry, order three ($11.95).\n\nTo drink with your meal, Kasa serves assorted beer and wine, a selection of Indian bottled and standard fountain sodas, house-made Mango Lassi ($3), and house-made Chai ($2.50). On my last visit, I ordered a glass of Tripel Karmeliet ($5.50), a beer from Belgium. I would not order it again as I tend to enjoy a fuller bodied and more hoppy beer and because I found the small 20cl glass (approximately .35 pint) overpriced.\n\nBottom line: Go to Kasa for the delicious Kati rolls. If you wish to imbibe, grab a beer at a nearby neighborhood watering hole after your meal.", "author": "Z. M."}

Kasa was the closest Indian restaurant to me and I thought to visit after learning it was a popular spot. \n\nGetting there, I thought, what is this, a cafeteria? It's like a prison cafeteria with the metal trays and really tiny selection of foods that actually don't look appetizing at all. \n\nI got the food anyway, since I figured it can't be THAT bad if there were lines wrapping around the block when this spot first opened as well as a fair amount of people inside eating. Seriously, I don't know how they managed that feat, because it was hands down the worst food, Indian or not, I have ever had in my life.  \n\nThe rice was insipid and tasted like air, no flavor AT ALL. The  Lamb Curry wasn't even curried and dry as a bone, tough to swallow and tough to chew. I think it must have been a 20 year old goat living on a sparse mountain top rather than a lamb, the meat was so tough and dry!  It was shredded up in an attempt to make it more palatable, but nothing can mask the inferiority of that meat.  The Chicken Masala, oh god, even worse.  Dry chicken and a greasy, congealed orange mess of a sauce that hardly had any flavor.  I didn't even know you could botch masala that badly.   The dipping sauces that came with were flavorless and also unpalatable. \n\nI have thus erased this place from my mind and memory.

There are several options to fill it, including with turkey kebabs (mmm), chicken tikka masala, karahi paneer (Indian cheese and peppers), or aloo jeera (spiced potatoes).

What Kasa did instead was to provide a casual fast food ambiance with indian meals (aka Thalis) that have small servings of multiple curries ordered and served chipotle-assembly-line-style. Great concept. Great branding (all with that purple colored building, attractive logo etc). No wonder this place received a lot of 5 stars in its early days.

First, this is not your typical Indian Restaurant but more of a quick Indian meal takeout / restaurant which serves generous portions of staple Indian dishes such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Tikka, Lamb Curry and Aloo Jeera just to name a few.  They also have a chalkboard for specials. The day I visited the place was hopping and they were out of an eggplant dish I wanted to try so I opted for a few of the other meatless dishes because these tend to be better way to judge the real execution.  While waiting in line, it became clear the staff knew many of the regulars by name - a nice touch.  They were also helpful to patrons who were not quite sure what to order from the Indian choices as were the couple in front of me.  \n\nBasically, at Kasa you have two choices of how the food is served.  One style is an Indian Wrap known as a Kati Roll and the other the more traditional Thali which is a stainless steel platter holding servings of multiple dishes. The Kati Rolls look interesting - especially if you want something simple, and quick to go. This night I opted for the Thali plate which was a nice filling combination.  The dishes were not overpowering and were quite well executed.  While I was there there was never an open table and only very few seats at the \"bar\" locations - a sign of good food. \n\nOverall, if you are in this area of the city and looking for a quick, good Indian meal, then Kasa is your answer.", "author": "G M."}

Okay, I really could only eat two for lunch, but if you're hungry, three should do it. And order anything but the veggie ones. Just sayin'. I tried the Gobi Aloo before, and this time, it was still not cooked to tenderness. I couldn't blame it on my teeth because even Ryan found it tough, and he's got teeth that can open beer bottles. He just doesn't do it often - no dental insurance. The karahi paneer just wasn't for me either.\n\nThe meat-filled rolls are quite tasty though. The chicken tikka masala is a tad too spicy for me, but if you like that burning sensation, make sure to get it! My favorite is the chicken kofta [meatballs], and Ryan's pick is the lamb curry. The side of raita helps it all go down.\n\nI'm glad the kati rolls come in the portioned size that they do. You can mix it up a bit in terms of flavors. It's the perfect snack size while you wait in that ridiculous Ike's line down the block. Or if you want to avoid the line altogether, you can get a thali [plate] at Kasa.", "author": "Tinna H."}

The yogurt sauce is great and the mango lassi is delightfully yogurty and smooth.\n\nMy only complaints are that if you're really hungry, it can be slightly unsatisfying. You know, two rolls aren't quite enough, but three are too many? Not really the fault of the restaurant, but you know.

So I had my birthday party last Saturday and although I didn't have time to plan a formal catered event, with the help of the nice guy who answered the phone we worked out a wonderful assortment of Thali plates for our guests. I order about 7 thali plates and each was filled with about four main items plus two sauces/toppings. They delivered them straight to my house and were really warm when they arrived.  \n\nWhat a way to taste the food!  My guests and I loved the lamb curry, the Karahi Paneer, aloo jeera, and the turkey. Also there were some other tasty meats but I am not sure which they were. The cauliflower was great. the pita/nan stuff was great but there was this thin little wrap tortilla like thing that was in the bread that really rocked our world.

I had the Thali with turkey kebabs and lamb curry. The kebabs weren't bad but a little dry and the lamb curry didn't resemble curry at all and was on the salty side, though I will say the meat was tender.\n\nI tasted the chicken tikka and tikka masala which were also just ok. On the overall, I can't say that the food was as authentic as they claim it is. Maybe authentic by American standards only, but I think most Indians would give it a Thumbs Down and laugh in their Thali.

Who knows how long food has been sitting there.\n\nTo order, you first choose if you want a Thali (plate) or a Kati roll (think Indian burrito). If you get the Thali, you get a choice of 2 different curries. The Kati roll contains one kind of curry but is wrapped in a buttery roti (thin bread) with marinated onions and chutney. I have never seen anything like that before and at $4.50 each, you can't go wrong.\n\nThe food:\n\nI got the Thali ($10.95) with the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Ghobi Aloo. K got 2 Kati rolls - one with Chicken Tikka Masala, one with Karahi Paneer (Indian cheese). The total came to $22.\n\nThali - I actually wasn't too impressed with this. The plate was huge, but there really wasn't much of the Chicken Tikka Masala or the Ghobi Aloo on it. The server was carefully assembling the curries in the small divider portion of the 24 plate. I felt kind of ripped off since I was paying $10.95 for this. There wasn't even enough rice for the small amount of curry. A majority of the plate was covered with different kinds of salads that I didn't even touch. There was chutney, red onion salad, a mix of raw veggies, and lentils. The lentils were great, but I was still hungry after my meal.\n\nKati Rolls - I took a bite of K's and it was pretty good. I don't eat onions or whatever's in the chutney, but it tasted pretty good to me. At Kasa, it seems like the kati rolls are the way to go. The Karahi Paneer tasted very similar to fresh mozzarella. I've never had Indian cheese before, so it was an interesting experience. For the big eaters out there, you can definitely get full on 2 Kati Rolls for $9 total rather than the $11 plate.\n\nMango Lassi - I've never had Mango Lassi before and decided that night to try it. Wow, it is definitely not my cup of tea. It' s like drinking a heavy yogurt with a hint of mango flavor and a strong taste of spices that seem like they shouldn't even be mixed with a sweet delicious fruit.\n\nDespite the rave reviews on 77 and Yelp, I don't think I'll be coming back to Kasa. I might just be too picky of an eater to really enjoy what they serve.", "author": "Sam L."}

Kasa may be fast-casual rather than a place to consume 13-course feast replete with wine and servers clad in collar shirts, but for a low-key, high-taste Indian shoppe, Kasa gives the Castro a more favorable culinary rating.\n\nSecond, Indian food is a style of cooking always heavy and consistently carb-filled, where every single dish kind of tastes like lamb rogen josh or chicken vindaloo. Not so with Kasa. In fact, I don't think I've ever had Indian food where I could clearly discern a variety of complex flavors in each mouthful. This fare clearly had time and love put into every serving-- you could literally smell and feel the subtleties in the food here. \n\nAll this from an eatery that serves its food in metal plates, not unlike those used in the kind of prisons where rich, crooked hedge fund managers go after they break the law.\n\nThe last law Kasa breaks is that a restaurant with this kind of throughput-- I would guess they served over 40 people in the 30 minutes in which I ate-- would have owners who are out of touch with their clientele and merely trying to serve the faceless masses as fast as possible (then urge them out the door). Kasa beats the odds with three owners who are kind, patient, and extremely friendly-- Tim is never too  busy to share a mango lassi with a friend.\n\nI'm a big fan of Kasa.

And, Kasa's milky sweet chai is true to the chai we had every morning and afternoon in India.\n\nMy top pics at Kasa include the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Curry, and Dal Makhani.  They are all flavor packed and moderately spicy (look to the chutneys if you're after the \"kill me\" levels of spiciness).  The meats are free range and grass fed, respectively.\n\nThis spot is also a great value, especially at lunch when you can get an entire thali plate with either a mango lassi or chai for less than $10.\n\nThe staff here is friendly, upbeat, and flexible - they'll let you mix and match selections (ex. 1/2 chicken, 1/2 lamb, extra raita, no chutney, etc.).\n\nMy only quibble with Kasa is that I wish they had as great a selection of vegetarian options as carnivorous options.\n\nps.

This is not your typical Indian Restaurant with traditional Indian food. They serve \"Kati Rolls\", which are like \"Indian Burritos\" and you have several meat and vegetable choices to pick from. If you're very hungry I'd recommend two rolls because one won't fill you up or you can order the \"Thali\" (plate) which comes with Rice, Meat, Vegetables, Lentils (Daal) and Salad. And if you have room for dessert, try the Mango \"Lassi\" (a yogurt drink that has the consistency of a smoothie). \nI would highly recommend the Aaloo Jeera (potato & cumin) Roll or the Karahi Paneer (cheese, green peppers & tomato) Roll if you're a vegetarian. And for meat lovers I'd recommend their Turkey Kebab Roll.\nWhat's also unique about them is that they have a Truck going around town, which stops at different locations in the city, so you can get a taste of Kasa without having to go to their Restaurant in the Castro.

More specifically, a couple hundred feet away from some very steep cliffs. \n\nAs a kid, we would watch in awe as surfers nimbly handled the steep descent, one hand firmly on the sharp rocks jutting out and the other on their boards. And then when we got old enough, we realized that it was a favorite place for those attempting suicide. We'd be on the football field during PE, hear the familiar whirring of the rescue and media helicopters, and go home to a news story on so-and-so from San Pedro driving their Prelude off the cliff. \n\nYou may remember in the mid-90s when some teenagers committed suicide by jumping off a cliff. Marilyn Manson was blamed. Yep, happened in my backyard. Jealous? \n\nOn a seemingly unrelated note, I wandered past Kasa for nearly six months with little more than moderate interest. One day I stepped off the precipice and plunged headfirst into two delicious kati rolls. One chicken tikka, one lamb curry, and washed down with a refreshing mango lassi. Like the surfer gods of my youth, I deftly maneuvered around the roti, embracing every last piece of buttery hangover curing goodness. \n\nAlright, terrible analogy. But with a place like Kasa, it doesn't really matter. Either you jump off and enjoy it, or you sit on the edge looking down. It's not healthy in the slightest, but for those of us looking for a slow artery clogging death, it's a perfect choice. \n\nNew Slogans: \nKasa: 70% better than suicide! \nKasa: Marilyn Manson approved! \nKasa: Who the fuck cares?

It's a quick service - where you order first, pay and then find a seat. It has a clear simple menu. Either choose a 1) Kati Roll or 2) Thali Plate.\n\nKati Roll is an Indian Wrap Sandwich. Pick your choice of filling - choose from a list of chicken tikka, turkey kebab, lamb, and veggie - which is then rolled in their freshly made roti along with other seasonings. $4.50 for one. Not too big so that you can't polish off 2, though I think 1 is enough for me. They serve it with a side of raita yogurt to stave off any spiciness. I tried the chicken tikka which was nice and tender.\n\nThali Plate is bigger where you choose 1 or 2 mains + comes with daal, rice, slaw, green parsley chop, lime seasoned onions, and a roti ($10.95) all served on a big round silver tray with partitions for each item. I chose the Chicken Tikka Marsala and the Gobi Aloo (cauliflower veggie mix) which they put together in the same tray slot. So you don't get double when you choose 2 items, they merely fit them in the same place. It works. My Marsala was a little spicy so I was thankful for the raita. Very tasty. The Gobi Aloo was ok.

The Tikka Masala was OK, not really inspired but good. I think I may be losing my interest in Tikka Masala in general. Its not a legit Desi dish anyway. The lamb, however, was superb. Succulent and spicy, it had the texture of good chile verde. I would come back for that and get a three roll plate any day. I'm also kicking myself for not getting the Turkey. See, I have to go back.

How lovely of fate to bring these two together to celebrate their regained independence.\n\nI had their vegetarian specials, which I don't remember what they were because I got pretty wasted after dinner... but I think it was \"aloo\" this and \"gobi\" that and it was fresh and spicy... just like me. I do remember that the roti was good.\n\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jrobert484/3336164122/\n\nOur friend finally wrapped up his yoga class, and then he joined us and wrapped up his masala in a roti.

Yes, it is that great and that affordable!  Savory classic Indian dishes wrapped up in a roti---so divine!  So addicted.\n\nEnough said---5-stars.  If you want details from an addict, read on:\n\nFavorites\nKarahi Paneer!!!  The turkey kabob and chicken tikka masala are tied for second.  Sorry I just can't choose.  If I could eat three at a time, I would.  Two is more than enough for me, but I plan to soon work my way up to eating three (as any good addict would).\n\nPortions\nOne: $5.50, for a snack or light meal.\nTwo: $8.95. more than enough for anyone with a normal appetite.  \nThree: $11.95, if you haven't eaten all day or simply have a large appetite.\nThali: $10.95, I haven't tried one, but I have had the rice and daal on the side (just ask!) and both are as good as it gets.  The daal is so savory; the rice fragrant.\n\nTo go\nTo bring my addiction home, I recently picked up two kati rolls to go (chicken tikka masala and the turkey kabob).  The roti was substantial enough to make the journey from Kasa to mi casa without getting the least bit soggy.  I had to know if they would make it home to me okay, and I was skeptical, but overjoyed that it worked out!  Each roll gets wrapped in foil, like a taqueria burrito, and the thick and creamy raita and fresh side salad are packed up in separate to-go containers.\n\nOverall\nAs an addict, I've tried everything on the menu and all of the regular six choices, plus specials are to-die-for-delicious!  The super fresh side salad started off a little too \"plain\" for me, BUT, the sous chef came out to ask about the food--maybe since I'm there constantly (?!)---so I shared my opinion on the salad and about two weeks later IMO it was improved . . . they are looking for and listening to customer feedback for sure!\n\nFeedback on Feedback\nThose who write about the food being bland or not spicy enough must have *dead* taste buds because the spice level is PERFECTION, from the curry, to the fresh-buttery (not oily!) roti, to the daal, nothing here is bland!  Kati rolls should also not be compared to burritos in terms of quantity/size because kati's are filled with the main dish plus just the right amount of chutney and red onions, not with the big fillers of rice & beans.  Plus, they taste 1000x better than a burrito.\n\n5-stars\nFresh, quality, amazing food.  Great concept.  Affordable, great value.  Wine and beer on tap, Indian drinks, includ'g chai.  CLEAN + design-conscious place to eat in the Castro (but not pretentious or trying too hard).  Friendly, helpful customer service that doesn't cost an arm and a leg!\n\nFinally . . .\nGreat place for groups (sit at communal table or at tables w/benches).  Everyone orders and pays separately so no dealing with splitting the check.  Or go alone and people watch at the window facing counter while you devour your newest food addiction . . . AND last but not least, it's kid friendly if your kid is awesome enough to like Indian food!  \n\nCan't think of a better addition to 18th Street!!!", "author": "TC C."}

It is rather crude phrase to describe an elegant principle - the elimination of that which is unnecessarily complex.\n\nKasa, the new casual Indian cafe in the Castro, exemplifies this principle, from its open, pared down surroundings (consisting of 2 tops, 4 tops, a counter and a community table), streamlined menu, great prices, and simple, fresh, high-quality ingredients.  I've been here twice now, and was very pleased both times.\n\nService is immediate - you go up to the counter and get in line, and select from the menu of 6 staple dishes or one of the specials, which they prepare for you cafeteria style.  You can order them either as a Kati Roll with a salad, and raita, or as a Thali, their self-named \"deconstructed\" roll which comes with daal, rice, a salad and raita.   The Kati is the cheaper, more lunch-like way to go ($5.50 for 1, $8.95 for 2), whereas the Thali ($10.95) is more like a meal.  \n\nI've had the Lamb Curry, the Chicken Tikka Masala, and the Karahi Paneer - all delicious.  The meat is free-range, so you can feel good about that.   There are reasons to love both preparations - the delicious roti used for the Kati, or the creamy daal that comes with the Thali.\n\nDrinks range from beer and wine to sodas to chai.  I like the Mango soda the best.\n\nOne last great sign that good things are happening here?  The folks at Kasa listen to their customer comments.  Soon after opening, they were inundated with requests for vegan options, and now offer them daily.  If you are vegan, make sure you ask for fresh roti, which they will make for you without butter.\n\nThe owners and staff are super-cool - say hi and let them know what you think.  Personally, I wish SF had more restaurants like this - it reminds me of places that I have been to in London, which offer great food at a great price, nice enough to sit down and have a leisurely meal, but equally accommodating if you have to eat and run.\n\nToday's thought:  lunch at Kasa - wonderful.  Lunch with Laura B. smiling all the way through it - sublime.  Now that's a great KISS if I ever saw one.", "author": "Liz S."}

At 3 for $11.95, this is probably your best deal price-wise.  And I have to say, not only are they well-constructed (leakage/collapse was minimal), but all the fillings (CTM, lamb, and kahari paneer) were loaded with flavor.

Indian!\n\n- The beer - go for the Belgian Ale - yummy and cold.\n\n- The people were friendly and helpful.\n\n***And the things-I-sure-hope-hope-they-improve...\n\n- The prices are a little steep - portions are available in various sizes, but I mean, for 10 bucks I can get literally twice as much food from a tacqueria! And there are plenty of those around to be sure.\n\n- Rather stingy on the mango chutney.\n\n- Best dish might have been the dahl, which came only with the tahli and not with the roti. How about offering a side of dahl for a buck or two?\n\n- White rice only? How about a brown rice option? \n\n- They better get those first-night logistics figured out - no way am I going to stand in line for MORE THAN AN HOUR again. I just won't. No matter how good it tastes. \n\n***They get three stars for now - I hope I can upgrade them soon. I hope they can straighten these things out and I can make this a regular alternative to the pizza-burger-burrito fast food alternatives in the neighborhood. I really do.\n\n\n\n\n\n(On another note - how about those ringers' reviews? Have you ever seen so many zero-friends-one-review-five-star write-ups? \nC'mon, Yelp! Inc, do something. Real people, real reviews? I think not! That alone leaves a bad taste in my mouth.)", "author": "Kingpin X."}

The food here is simple but unique, authentic, and more importantly, out-of-this-world good!  \n\nits menu is conceptually different than most Indian restaurants. You order in one of two methods: the Khathi or the Thali.  You can pick any of the curries to go with either and both come with delicious roti bread...it's softer and yummier than naan (if you can believe it!).\n\nThe Khathi resembles a little burrito with the roti wrapped around your favorite meat or veggie curry, and the Thali is a \"deconstructed\" version with the roti, rice, dal, and curry separate.  Everything is made from scratch -- how do I know that?  The kitchen is open for public purview, which I love, and you can watch your food being made.  The meat is free range and the wine/beer list is small, but quality.  The owners and staff are all very friendly and happy to provide more info about the dishes.  My friends and I loved everything we tried.\n\nSummary: everything here is good!", "author": "Sid D."}

I wouldn't write home about the food, but when you're hungry and looking for a lot of food for a reasonable price, the thalis are perfect.  The food itself is pretty solid, with plenty of good vegetarian options.  I tried the gobi aloo (is this reversed?  that's the order they wrote it), which was a daily special, and the karahi paneer which was fantastic.  My girlfriend claimed the dhal was spicy, but I couldn't taste it.  I wish I had tried the Kati Roll, that looked pretty awesome.  I think I'll end up coming here a lot because I live right near it and it's pretty simple and cheap food, but I don't think I'd choose it if I were getting a group of friends together for dinner.\n\nOh, and the chai seemed a bit watered down.

Interestingly enough, I can come up with logic like this on more than one occasion, why my opinion is more important. But I digress. \n\nI called up my friend and asked her if she was game to try out this new Indian joint, Kasa. She was very scared because of all the Indian restaurants in the Bay Area I think I have only given the Radha stamp of approval to one, and in a very limited arena. \n\nAnyways, we show up and the line is about 5 people deep. Walking in, the place was clean (always a surprise at an Indian restaurant) and you can see the people cooking up the food (I like this so I know there aren't any dirty people touching my food, ya I know let me live in denial). The idea seems simple enough but it takes us a good 10 mins to actually get to the front and order (remember there are only 5 people in front of us). \n\nSo I order 2 rolls, the chicken tikka masala and the lamb curry roll. I find out that the lamb is currently being cooked, but it will be ready in 20 mins. Now I'm happy that the food is being made fresh, but am wondering why it's going to take 20 mins in a taqueria-like place to get my food. Oh well, I decide just to get two chicken tikka masala rolls.\n\nSo here's the break down of why they get 4 stars:\n\n1 - food, a little spicy, fresh, and on the more authentic side of Indian food\n1 - cleaniness and somewhere I wouldn't mind hanging out for a while\n1 - polite staff\n1 - what the hell, I really needed some Indian food\n\nWhy the minus one star? 1/2 because of the slow service, and another 1/2 because the lamb wasn't ready :(\n\nI'm definitely coming back...be ready!", "author": "Radha S."}

Then you've got to try the first (that I've seen) miraculous marriage of the two.\nThe menu is utterly basic - they make 6 things: chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, turkey kebabs, cumin potatoes, and karani paneer (cheese, spices & onions - fantastic!  seriously, best version of this I've ever had.).  Once you've figured out what you want, you can either get it wrapped in roti like mini Indian burritos, or on a plate which also has rice & daal in a \"deconstructed\" version.\n\nThe food is fantastic - rich, flavorful, VERY fresh, and wonderfully tender (especially the lamb, which is described as \"saucy\").  You should also be aware that most of it is pretty spicy; I think it's awesome, but if you're a spice wuss you should be nervous).\nYou also have a choice of spicy chutney or minty sauce on your rotis.  (Hint: the chutney goes REALLY well with the lamb.)  Even better, unlike a lot of cheap Indian food, you'll never get the nasty ghee oil-slick.  This is fresh and healthy stuff!\n\nThey've got Kingfisher and a fantastic light, crisp Belgian beer on tap (I forget the name), and some tasty wine as well including a very dry German Riesling which goes very well with the spicy food.\n\nThe space is plain, basic, and pretty noisy - it feels like a taqueria.

Think Delfina Pizzeria vs. greasebomb by-the-slice joints, or Little Chihuahua vs. artery-clogging tacquerias. And now Kasa's doing it to Indian.\n\nPeople seem naturally attracted to the Kati mini-wraps, but I'm a fan of the traditional Thali plates. Maybe I'm just used to eating that way, but I find the combination of rice, delicious(!!) black dal, and more entree / less buttery roti to be more balanced than the roti-heavy wraps. It's even served authentic-style on a tin plate.\n\nIt's all literally prepared in front of your eyes and you can see the quality. I'm not usually a fan of chicken tikka masala but this one is great -- very tomatoey and not too much cream. My favorite is the spicy aloo! Also tried a great off-menu cauliflower dish. Hope they put that on the board soon.\n\nIt's funny to hear people complain about authenticity.. basing their comparison on the greasy cheap joints. Same problem with tacquerias and pizzas. You just have so much of that crap that you come to expect it and fear change. You reach a point where you won't even touch a \"Vietnamese sandwich\" that costs more than $3. You're just missing out at that point. We did find the lamb to be a little under-spiced (could've been an early-days fluke) but everything else was great.\n\nThe icing on the cake was the Belgian beer on draft.. Triple Karmeliet. This is a fantastic beer and highly complimentary.\n\nIn an aloo-to-aloo comparison with other dhaba-style joints, Kasa definitely wins my heart with its focus on quality over quantity. If you take it easy on the roti you can eat a healthy and satisfying quick meal on the regular here.", "author": "Tom L."}

Also snag one of their bottled mango drinks. I don't usually indulge in juice (waste of cals and I prefer chewing things) but this mango juice is really amazing. I would come here just to buy the juice, really. If anyone knows where I could buy this without also being tempted to eat curry filled creations, please let me know.\n\nPersonal Notes: Beware of the whole chile peppers sometimes left inside your curry. You're not supposed to eat these suckers but it can sometimes be unavoidable. Last time I was there I accidentally chewed and swallowed an entire pepper not realizing it for a solid 15 seconds before I burst into tears and ran to the bathroom to eat paper towels from the dispenser.

The Castro needed more Indian dishes badly, and as the 'hood started to buckle again under yet another economic lag, restaurants started to fold. One that kicked the can was La Castro Tacqueria. A few months later, a nifty idea rose from its dust and ashes, and named itself... Kasa!  \n\nI was right there on their opening night, and Anamika and Tim offered quite a delight. Of course, it's not authentic Indian food, nor could you place the recipes in any particular region in India.  But who gives a flying frak. The food tastes good, and I am relieved, because I really didn't want to watch them fire up then shut down six months later (which seems to be happening a lot around here).  Unfortunately, the prices are steering towards unaffordable, not because of the actual prices, but because we're in a recession, for Christ's sake.\n\nThe staples here are the Kati rolls, unto which you choose a meat or vegetable stuffing. They're a bit heavy and butter-laden, but admittedly one order will fill you up just right. Specific kati hits include the lamb and curry, or the chicken tikka masala, which are both truisms in any Indian shanty.  If you don't know what to try, just ask the lovely lady with a British accent.\n\nIf you want to go easy on the buttery bread, then order the Thalis version of your dinner, which is what they refer to as a \"deconstructed kati\". Deconstructionism right here in the Castro. How sublime (and appropriate).  \n\nNow, it's time to throw plenty of good energy at this place.

I am heartened to find out they are completely aware of the noise problem and taking steps to rectify it. (I hope I didn't get that employee in trouble for telling me it was a low priority. I have definitely misrepresented the place I work for before - no one can know everything that's going on behind the scenes.) Good customer service is key and I am impressed with Kasa's owners. It's still a 3-star joint for me, and I don't know if I'll ever be going back myself, but I do think it is a worthwhile place to check out for yourself at least once.\n\nI am leaving my original review, though, because everything in it (except the employee misrepresentation) is still an accurate reflection of my experience:\n\nI hate to do this - a 2 star review for a place where the food is decent, if a bit overpriced - but after having one of the worst dining experiences in recent memory, i just have to speak my piece.\n\nI'll say it right off - the 2-star rating is based completely on earsplitting loudness and the kind of atmosphere that made me want to bolt my food and run. If you're the type of person who doesn't care at all about noise in your dining experience, skip this section and go on to the next one, which is more of a 3-star review of the restaurant's other qualities. But for those of you who like to be able to talk to your dinner companions without screaming (\"What?\" \"What?\" \"I'm sorry, what?!\" \"Forget it!\") I would stay away from Kasa, at least at dinnertime. \n\nWe went there last night around 8pm and the place was full. There was music on, there were people at most of the tables and counter spots. It was impossibly, indescribably loud. Kasa has cement floors and metal furniture. Every time someone pulls their chair back to sit down, or scoots their chair forward, the sound screeches sharply off the walls, ceiling, and floor (which are all hard surfaces, with no attempt at acoustical muffling) to the point where it stops conversation. Not that conversation is really possible. Everyone in the place was screaming to be heard. When I went to ask the man behind the counter if the owners were planning to do anything about the acoustics I had to shout my question several times before he understood what I was saying. (His answer: In a perfect world they might, but it's not high on the priority list.*) \n\nNoise aside, Kasa is a fine restaurant but not destined to become a favorite, at least for this vegetarian. I've been there twice, a couple of months apart, and both times the \"specials,\" which double the number of veggie offerings from 2 to 4, were the same. The cumin potatoes were totally bland, and the paneer was dull. The aloo gobhi and green beans with potatoes were both tasty enough, but lacked any real brightness of seasoning or anything to really make them stand out. I remember the dal being okay the first time but last night it tasted like the liquid from a can of pinto beans.\n\nIt's nice to get a thali plate with two main dish choices and rice and chopped-veggie salad and raita and chutneys, and certainly if you ordered a serving of all those things at an a la carte Indian restaurant it would cost more than $11 (the pre-tax and tip cost), but the portions are pretty small. Definitely filling but I'd rather pay $8 to fill up or $13 and have a whole 'nother meal of leftovers. Also, an all-veggie thali costs the same price as one with meat, and that kind of bugs me. That is definitely not how meal prices are scaled at most Indian places.\n\nI do have a couple nice things to say after all that: The chai is amazing. They seem committed to sustainable and local food, which is pretty swell, and maybe makes the price tag more justifiable. But if you are curious about Kasa, I suggest either staying away from peak dining hours, or making sure you packed your ear plugs. \n\n*In case you're curious, here is what the owner of Kasa had to say when he responded to this review:  \"I completely agree that our space can get too loud, especially at dinner.  We try to make sure the music is turned way down at night.\n\nIt's a difficult problem for us.  We put some recording studio foam underneath all the tables to absorb some of the sound.  We've used epoxy to apply pads on feet of our chairs a few times, but they come off within a couple days each time.  If we could go back in time, we certainly wouldn't buy those chairs again.\n\nI wouldn't say fixing the sound is a low priority (our server said that incorrectly).  We're working with it and trying a few  cost-effective things to see what makes the most impact.  We like the sparse look, but need to figure out how to achieve that with more sound dampening.\"", "author": "Scrumptious S."}

I decided to go somewhere I hadn't been before, as a little treat for being smoke-free for two whole days now (well, one and a half... ok, less than that, if you don't include sleep-time, which I do because I'm on the patch, and I had some CRAZY dreams last night.  I seriously dreamed that I was a part of the Corleone family, and Al Pacino kept getting mad at me for gossiping to my friends about the family business.  WTF).  \n\nAnyway.  I made the trip in the rain, and showed up drenched to the bone.  I was surly and irritable, as any new non-smoker will be, but was immediately welcomed by the staff, which reminded me to take a breath and smile back.  I ordered the one-roti plate, which was very good (I got the veg cheese dish filling - forget what it's called), although I would have appreciated another sauce or two to round it out.  The chai was sweet, warm perfection.  Exactly what I needed to warm up and cheer up.  And with a hefty tip it was still super cheap.  \n\nNext time I'll definitely get more food, though.  One roll was great and filling, but not enough to constitute a full meal (for me anyway, maybe you're different and/or skinny), and I definitely want to try the rest of the veggie menu.\n\nI will be back for sure.

First, if you want to eat at home you have to either take it out or have it delivered. Take out is nearly impossible given the location. There is zero parking in this neighborhood. That means delivery. This is a hit or miss proposition. If by chance they take a large internet order, there is a scaling problem. You're told it'll be an hour and fifteen minutes. Likely that means closer to two hours. So...it all comes down to how much you want their food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-06", "description": "I'm proud to say I was Kasa's first customer...ever.  I anxiously waited 'til they opened at 11:00am on a Thursday and had the delight of eating their first officially served, paid-for meal.  I live right up the street and have been back numerous times but I've had interesting knowledge of seeing their food evolve as they adjust their food prep and process to accomodate \"the masses.\"  \n\nThat first meal was amazing.  The kati rolls were MUCH smaller than they are now, and delicate, almost like a crepe.  So delicate that the balance of meat/filling to kati bread was just right.  Plus, you didn't get a \"choice\" of sauces to go inside.  They simply put what the chef thought should go with each filling.  The lamb was pleasantly fiery with the red sauce and the onions provided a cool, crisp counterpoint.     The yogurt raita was fresh.  The pickled vegetables were cut into perfect dices, seasoned with just the right amount of spices, composing the perfect Indian mirapoix.  \n\nNow, I've seen the kati rolls evolve into something closer to a burrito and yet the amount of filling stayed the same.  That is to say, the kati bread became much thicker and bigger but not the inside--hence the ratio of wrap to filling is completely thrown off and it's simply too bready.  Many a times I've seen plates left on the empty tables with half eaten bread but the insides all picked out.  \n\nIn its original concept, a person could feasibly eat 3 kati rolls (it's offered on the menu but rarely ordered).  But now, there is no way anyone who knows how filling each roll is, would order 3.  My hypothesis is that rolling out the dough for the kati rolls became too labor intensive, and it became much more efficient to roll-out 1 larger dough than 3 smaller, delicate ones.  Such a shame.  \n\nI go back there probably once a week still because all the food, ingredients, the people, the atmosphere are all still great.  I just wish I didn't have the knowledge of what Kasa was before they altered their process and food to cater to the masses and the huge lines.  I applaud them for \"making it work\" but secretly wish for that first meal when everything was smaller and that much more precious.", "author": "Tom K."}

One thing doesn't: the price.\n\nYou've got a young, high-school- aged staff of white kids serving you.  Nothing wrong with that, maybe, except that there is.  I don't pretend to be an authority on whether this is \"authentic\" Indian food (I think it's an unfair term, anyway).  But you're certainly not getting an authentic vibe.  And that, like it or not, admit it or not, makes the food taste worse.\n\nThere's practically nothing in each of those little wraps.  I ended up not finishing my third wrap, but that was more because they were bad and not because they were filling.  In the end you do get enough food, but only because you're eating 3 wraps worth of bread!  There's one, maybe two, pieces of meat in the curry they give you.  They're even pretty cheap with the dips they give out.  \n\nIn fact, I asked for second of one of the dips (the non-yogurt ones).  It's a good thing, because when I was running home, my bag broke and one of my dips splatted all over some poor fool's driveway.  Sure, I was literally -running- home, so the bag's probably aren't used to the swaying, but still, weak sauce. Or weak dip.  If I weren't pissed off about paying for $12 for this crap, I'd probably admit it was my fault, but I am, so I'm holding Kasa accountable and I'd like you to join me in doing so.\n\nWhen I did get home to eat my sad, dip-inhibited wraps, the bread tasted stale.  Part of this place's appeal to me was that it's open relatively late, but it appears that just means you're eating day old bread.

They are like Indian burritos, where the wrapping is a lightly-pan-fried roti.\n\nWhen you walk up to the counter, you will have two big choices to make:\n\nChoice #1: Do you get Kati rolls (\"Indian burrito\") or Thali dish (full meal with basmati rice, salad, etc.)?\n\nI say use your extra ca$h on the Kati rolls. You can get rice-based entrees anywhere else, and the Kati rolls will give you more variety:\n\nChoice #2: Once you've chosen Kati rolls, do you get 1, 2, or 3 rolls?\n\nFor a normal-appetited person, one roll is a light lunch, two rolls is a satiating dinner, and three is just crazy.\n\nMy recommendation: go with your honey and split 3 rolls between the two of you (and ask the Kati-assembler person for two plates). That gets each of you a 1.5-roll satisfyingly-filling 3-sample dinner, with room for dessert.\n\nStaff are friendly.", "author": "Rob T."}

I was looking for a place to have a quick dinner, and so I stopped in.  What a happy experience.  It's fast, tasty, and healthy.  It's cheap.  They have good beer on tap.  \n\nI had a chicken tikka masala kati roll and, at one of the servers' suggestion, a karahi paneer (yogurt cheese, spinach, green peppers) kati roll.  I had a nice, flavorful ale to go with it, the name of which I cannot remember.  Each roll was delicious and filling.  The little garnish salad they serve is fabulous--diced red onion, sweet peppers, cabbage, carrots with black mustard seed and cumin in a vinegary dressing.  Fresh and lively.  The raita was just fine.\n\nThe interior setup is done well.  It's airy and comfortable.  The folks who work there are upbeat and helpful.  My only criticism is that they don't make mango lassis.  They do have mango juice, but I'm a mango lassi kinda broad.  That's a very minor criticism.  They're new.  They're evolving.  They'll come around eventually.  \n\nI'm just delighted to have them in my neighborhood.  I will be darkening their door often, I suspect.\n\nUPDATE:  I hear that they're now making mango lassis (11/08), although I can't confirm that personally.

Kati Rolls or a Thali plate. From there you can choose one of several uncomplicated options. Stepping up the the line deep with several other ahead of me, I was expecting a pretty decent wait before it was my turn to order, yet the line moved surprisingly fast. Being my first time there, I went for the Thali plate with the grilled turkey kabob. At $10.95 I thought the quantity of food that I got was a good value, and could barely finish all of my dinner. The kabob's had a nice flavor with just enough spice, but not over-bearing. The establishment itself is fairly small, and due to the openness and seating arraignments, noise level can sometimes be on the loud side... but then again, this is not the place for that quite intimate meal. \n\nWhen all is said and done, this is a place I am sure to revisit when grow tired of the standard Castro eateries... next time to give the Kati rolls a try.", "author": "Matt O."}

Please take note, I'm not one of those eaters that has proudly killed off their taste buds in pursuit of spicy food.

It definitely needs more. Also the taste was a little too bland and Americanized. \n- The paneer was tasty but again, too little flavor. \n- I was bummed they didn't have naan or cholle (garbanzo beans)\n\nI think my overall disappointment had to do with the fact that there wasn't enough flavor to the dishes.

Good sign. New places need traffic to take off.\n\nI ordered a chicken tikka kati roll; an aloo-jeera roll and a beer. The rolls are about $5.50 each, and probably 1 would be enough for a person. They look like burritos, but the similarity is only superficial.\n\nThe wrap used to make the kati roll is very good. It is basically a plain paratha that you'd get in an Indian joint; but it is very well-made.\n\nThe chicken tikka was pretty good. The chicken pieces were a bit larger than I would have liked, and the veggies (green peppers and onions) were lesser than I would have liked; but no biggie.\n\nThe aloo-jeera (potatoes and cumin) roll was slightly disappointing. There's an art to cooking potatoes for a wrap; cook too much, and they become mushy. Cook too little, and they're not done. I think the potatoes were a bit underdone. My recommendation for the chef would be to explore the option of other potatoes (which can maintain shape) and cook some more. \n\nOK, so why the 3 stars? The staff is a bit new to this whole \"kati roll\" business. One of the guys making the rolls was more interested in chatting up his (presumably) buddies and not paying as much attention. The other guy make a paneer roll for me instead of the aloo-jeera roll; two totally different things. For all they know, I could have been lactose-intolerant (or vegan) and gagged on the paneer roll.

Yes, they just opened, yes, they have a cute note saying \"please be patient while we work out the kinks\", but no, I won't let it go. The whole concept this place is a modern eatery, serving what are essentially Indian versions of a Burrito or a Shawerma.

This would be a killer deal if the two-roll plate was $6.95. But at $9, and with the wait we experienced, you're much better off getting a more authentic \"indian junk on rice\" at a traditional restaurant.\n\nGood food, high prices, identity crises. Here's hoping they figure it out!", "author": "Tolga E."}

Tonight was my inaugural night after previously sampling the Chicken Tikka Masala one day on my way home from work when I couldn't resist dropping into the inviting atmosphere; that had melted in my mouth and in the spirit of diversity, this time I opted for the Thali with Chicken Tikka & Lamb Curry (they let you sort of create your own configuration of main dish which is great); as with all Thalis, this was accompanied by veggies, yogurt, dal (as a nice twist, the owner, Anamika, was perched off to the side poring through the lentils to ensure the utmost quality which added a nice homey touch to the experience) and of course, flaky bread & rice. \n\nAs for freshness & quality: the meat is savory soft and well-spiced. Note I am a vegan 90% of the time but since it's free range I have no qualms eating it here, esp. given how tasty it is. \n\nAs for simplicity: 2 for 2 as menu offers the key essentials which again are happily configured by the helpful waitstaff; and the hours delightfully uncomplicated (11-10 7 days a week). \n\nAs for accessibility:  the service is fast and the ambiance open and location is right off Castro so not in the obnoxious thick of things but still quite easy to get to. \n\nI'm so glad I live 1.5 blocks away so I can justify the indulgence on a regular basis.\n\n11/20/08 update - check out the well-deserved buzz they got @ SFGate:\nhttp://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/11/19/NS9B14653D.DTL", "author": "Diane B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-15", "description": "I came here for a late-night dinner a few nights ago with some friends. I was impressed by how busy it was at 9pm on a Thursday, and excited to try out their menu.\n\nWhen we walked in, I realized it was like Indian fast food - kinda like a Subway or a Chipotle. You stand in line, and then give your order to the first dude putting the wrap together. He puts something on it, then passes it on to the next guy. He asks you if you want raita and/or onions. And so on. Then they put it on a tray and you pay at the end of the line. \n\nThe menu is pretty small - they only have about 6 different wraps (kati) to choose from and a few \"meal\" options. The entire menu fits in large print on the wall. I read the whole thing and decided I wanted 2 wraps; the turkey kebab and chicken tikka masala. The price seemed fair - $8.50 for two wraps.\n\nAs my kati rolls went down the line, I watched them being assembled, and everything looked and smelled delicious. When we sat down to eat, however, I bit into the kebab, and my friend, who also ordered the chicken tikka masala, bit into hers. We both started fanning our mouths.\n\nIt was wayyyyy hot! Adding raita and drinking ice water didn't help. Both dishes left the kind of burning sensation that blocked out all other taste, and my whole mouth was throbbing with pain after a few bites. However, I was so hungry (and of course wasn't about to waste $8.50 in food) that I continued eating only to stop the hunger, even though for the rest of the meal my lips, mouth, throat and stomach were on fire. \n\nI have always been sensitive to spice, but I usually order food at the \"mild\" setting, and I'm fine. Maybe I've just gotten used to living in a de-spiced, Americanized-ethnic food world and now assume that no choice of spiciness level equals a default on \"mild\". I also guess I could have asked about the spice level of the food before ordering. However, since none of the dishes had any warning about spiciness, I assumed they must all be relatively mild. You can always add spice, but you can't really take it away.\n\nA few minutes into our meal, an employee came over to our table. He asked how we liked everything. I told him that it tasted good, but that it was a bit too spicy for me to have an enjoyable dining experience. He advised us to try putting raita on it. I explained that while I appreciated his advice, I had already tried the raita and it just wasn't enough - the food was too spicy. I asked him if they made multiple versions of the same dish so that you could order a mild, medium, or hot version. He apologized, saying there just wasn't enough room. Understandable. So then I asked if there were items on the menu that were less spicy. He said everything on the menu was pretty spicy, but that they had lots of food that wasn't on the menu; \"you just have to ask\". \n\nI thanked him, and he walked away. But actually, I was super annoyed by that response. It felt like he was in essence saying, \"Well, we're not going to warn you that our food is ridiculously spicy, but if you *do* happen to burn your mouth off, then at *that* point, you should think to ask about food that's not on the menu.\" \n\nSo, first of all, what restaurant has food that's not on the menu?!??! That doesn't make sense to me. If people don't know what you offer, how will they know to order it? I told my friends I had never heard of that concept, and they informed me that lots of restaurants do this. Apparently, this practice helps to make customers feel like it's \"their\" restaurant, so they can order \"their\" special off-menu dish, because they *know* about what's not on the menu.\n\nIf this is what Kasa is trying to do, then it makes me feel excluded, not included and part of the Kasa patron *elite*. If you don't at least warn me that your food is excessively spicy, then when it burns my mouth and makes for an unpleasant dinner, why would I want to come back? On top of that, you told me about other \"off-menu\" options *after* the fact that your food caused my dinner to be unpleasant and painful.\n\nAlso, throughout the whole conversation with the employee, he had a big grin (smirk?) on his face and a bit of a condescending attitude, which came off like \"Well, it's not *our* fault you didn't ask for something that's not on the menu\", when really, what I wanted to hear was, \"I'm sorry it's too spicy for you. Next time, I would recommend ordering the _______. It's not on the menu right now, but it's a very mild dish and I think you'd really like it.\"\n\nSorry, Kasa, but your mix of chili powder and attitude will keep me away for quite a while. Maybe if one day I hear that you have options (and empathy) for those of us with sensitive taste buds, I'll try again.", "author": "Maria P."}

This usually doesn't happen in more formal restaurants, much less a place where you take the food back to your table.\n\nI was a little taken aback by the limited menu choices.  There were basically two choices and 5 dishes.  The two choices were to have one of the main entrees as a wrap, or to have it as a plate of food.  If you had the wrap, then you could choose how many pieces.  (This was sort of like choosing how many inches you want your submarine sandwhich to be.)  We were hungry, so we choose the plate of food.\n\nThe plate was $11.xx and consisted of a portion of the entree that you choose, a portion of daal, a small naan, a little crispy vegetable salad, a very small portion of two different sauces, a taste yogurt side and a large pile of rice in the middle.  When I was done I was still hungry, which is not what I would have expected for the price and considering that the service is similar to a taquieria.\n\nStill, everything did taste good, and I do think that with a little jiggering, that the place has a ton of potential.  Everything did taste fresh and good, and everyone that worked there seemed to be in great spirits.\n\nUPDATE - The owner wrote me a follow-up email giving me details on how they were working on every issue I brought up.

Have tried the lamb curry a couple times and it seems a bit tasteless, so have learned to pass on it.

Notably, the kati rolls have gotten much bigger, so that 2 rolls is plenty for me, or you can split 3 between 2 people.  The chicken tikka seems to be the best filling - flavorful and quite spicy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-14", "description": "I have never maybe been so indecisive when reviewing a food place in the city.  At first I thought Kasa's kati roll was the best invention since the corn dog or fried Snickers bar.  With a kati roll, think Pancho Villa meets Naan N Curry.  It's Indian food rolled with roti (resembling a small burrito).  The first roll I tried was the chicken tikka masala, which was delicious but the other rolls went downhill for the most part after that.  I would give the chicken tikka masala close to a five, the lamb curry a solid four, and the rest of the rolls a three for an overall rating of a high three star for Kasa.\n\nThe chicken tikka masala and lamb curry are the standout rolls.  The sauces and seasonings on these dishes were above the rest of the dishes, and I'm not usually a huge lamb fan.  I've also tried the turkey kebob, chicken tikka, and a few of the other special vegetable rolls but each of those has lacked the flavorful ingredients found in the chikka tikka masala and lamb curry.\n\nAt 2 kati rolls for $8.95, this place is on the more expensive side for fast food but the ingredients do seem better than average.  With 2 rolls, you can get full, and 3 rolls for $11.95 you will be stuffed.  Your best bet is to get one chicken tikka masala and one lamb curry roll.", "author": "Josh K."}

Then I asked an Indian (American born) what he thought and to my surprise he thought it was to spicy. Then I brought my British boyfriend and he thought it was perfect. Now when I raised that question - it is quite spicy, but I would place it more in the moderate category. They do give you some yogurt sauce to put out the fires with however. Anyway, it took a bit of deciphering to figure out the menu and what to order. You order the same dishes either Roti or Thali and all it means is they serve it to you in bread or you have the option to put it in yourself (like with fajitas). We weren't overwhelmingly hungry so we got the Plate with two dishes, Chicken Tikka Masala and the Daily Vegetable Special (they have two to choose from). It put mine in the roti and at it like that. Very tasty! They do have wine and beer as well btw, although I had a very sweet mysterious guava drink.\nThe decor is a little spars, to the point that the place seem too empty. I suppose it is too look modern, but it has been rainy and grey here the last couple of months and starring out into a dark wet world doesn't seem ideal right now.

Quite simply, it is a new interpretation of Indian food designed to be quick and more affordable bites.  And I think it does a good job--the flavors are still there, and even though it is isn't necessarily made to order (they keep previously prepared food on a hot plate), the food is still quite good.\n\nLove it for what it is.\n\nThere are plenty of traditional or \"sit-down\" Indian restaurants out there, and Kasa is not one of them.

He was chatting it up with us (more so than the cashier who had time to talk to us, though he was pretty nice too) and seemed genuinely interested and nice. Funny enough, I think the manager might have also been there, typing away on his laptop-I wasn't quite sure cuz this guy barely looked up, much less said hi.\n\nThe second time, we were barely acknowledged by the staff there (though it was probably because there was a line behind us since they were training a newbie who didn't even know what Chicken Tikka Masala was). By this time, I've tried most of their variations of Roti stuffings and I can definitely say that they are all good. The only downside would be that the portions are a little bit small for the prices, though they are somehow quite filling (I was full after one and bursting after two).

My one year old liked the dal/raita/roti, and my four year old liked the lamb kati roll, even though it was a touch spicy for him (but, really, none of the food here is all that spicy).  You can also get kati with just egg, which the friendly owner recommended for kids.  \n\nDespite the fact that the kati look like mini burritos, the food doesn't feel fake -- to me the flavors were more fresh, vibrant, and interesting than most indian places in town, although I'm guessing the real thing is a lot spicier.

A very yupster/huppie crowd queued up to decipher the menu, which I find very intelligent.\n\nKasa leverages an \"iPod strategy\" (constrain choices to produce radical simplicity) to help a Castro audience appreciate (a specific genre of ) indian food. It calls itself an \"indian Taqueria\", to help San Franciscans relate to the Kathi Roll (by virtue of its similarity to burritos?), and you can have em with any one of the 5 standard fillings, and a daily special. Additionally, there are \"bundles\" (2 roll combo, and a lunch discount). If you like to skin your iPod, get it with egg on the inside. The best part is the \"Thali\" (which Kasa describes as a \"deconstructed Kathi Roll), which I always thought of as a synthesis of various things, but must admit, is better understood as a ripped open Kathi Roll. The visual merchandising and decor are impressive, and marketing is FAB!\n\nThe execution could improve, perhaps the rolls could be packed a bit \"longer\" than \"fat\", to make them easier to bite into (unless we are expected to eat them with a fork, eww!). Maybe a paper/foil wrap will make handling easier. There is a decent selection of beers, but for \"street food gone upscale\" I would expect larger pints with less head.\n\nGood start - I think Kasa is onto something.

Tim did reply to me with an apology.  He invited my family and I back to the restaurant on them to correct the not so pleasant experience the first time around.  We did have to email back and forth for over a month or so, but he stood by his word.  Perhaps the holiday season is not the time to have big expectations, but it shows that most good restaurants have someone follow up on customers' negative reviews and make them positive ones.  \n\nSo all in all, if you don't like your food or the service you received, I noticed if you are polite about bringing it up to the owner(s) attention that the good ones do reply in kind.  Trust me, I had to deal with some of those reviews myself with my parents' restaurant when they had it running.  I realized that if you sincerely apologize and then offer a solution that meets both parties' expectations then the customer is usually grateful for that and will return.  So it's a win-win for everyone.\n\nHappy holidays everyone, and may 2011 be a wonderful year for all.  :)", "author": "Maggie L."}

I had been eyeing it for a while, but the husband is not very into Indian food, so hadn't had much chance to check it. Then on Friday I was like, \"OK, we are trying it\" and had to come back two days later, I loved it so much.\n\nThe space is nice, sorta industrial-sparse, but comfy. The big windows, on a sunny day like we've been having as of late, make it terribly inviting inside. There's no clutter, the lower tables are lined up to the wall, with some high tables in the middle. Concrete floors, and a counter in back. Everything looks sparkling clean.\n\nThe lunch deal is awesome - 2 Kati rolls and a drink for $7.95. I had a chicken tikka masala and an aloo jeera roll. The bread they use is amazing - fluffy, light and oh so tasty.  I came back a couple of nights later after a few beers and the spicy food was just what I needed to get me home satisfied. The food leans towards spicy courtesy of the spicy sauce they add, so you may wanna tell them to go light if you can't handle it. \n\nPeople are super-nice. I'll be coming back here often - The one bummer is that I can't take this place on the road with me when I am away...!", "author": "Marcelo T."}

The ambience is nice, the staff is friendly, the price is not cheap but not unreasonable, however the execution in terms of food flavor is quite lacking.  \n  \nThe food is ok at best.  If you have no idea what authentic Indian food tastes like you'll probably like it.   Saw only one table with Indian customers, and none amongst the servers or staff - yes, I do think that it takes an Indian chef to cook or at least create that authenticity.\n\nWe found the chapatis (used as the outer part of the roll) smelling of oil.  The chicken tikka masala was like grilled chicken with ketchup, the turkey and lamb curry was bland.  I just don't understand why you would try to wrap a curry in a roll - it was dribbling out every time we picked it up for a bite.  The paneer was the only tasty thing we had amongst our group, and the side raita and salad was nice too.\n\nWhat really irked me was the sign on the menu explaining the \"thali\" as a deconstructed roll.  That is totally ridiculous, and I don't know how they get away with it in an area where so many people will actually know the truth.", "author": "S C."}

There are a lot of tweaks and kinks to work out when first opening a restaurant, and hopefully the process is ongoing.\n\nI wanted to like it. I really did.  The concept is simple and straightforward, the service is friendly and the ingredients are fresh.  \n\nMaybe the Kasa-ians have been reading Yelp and trying to make adjustments because my chicken tikka masala was anything but bland.  It was practically nuke-ular, to quote a lame duck.  The chicken didn't stand a chance, it was so seriously outnumbered by whole peppers  (the stems still in tact I assume to provide some justification for spitting beyond not liking the food).  Just for fun I decided to count and my humble single serving had 15 whole peppers.

I really liked that they had a simple menu, saving me time agonizing over what I should get.  My boyfriend was happy.  The main dish I chose was the chicken tikka masala.

The chicken in particular was tender. I've had the chicken tikka, chicken tikka masala and the lamb. The only downside is the serving sizes - they mete out the smallest quantity of raita like it was being rationed, same with the veggie fresh salad - what's up with that? I like that the food is spicy with nice flavors.\n\nDecor/Vibe - a bit spartan, hip, modern but with a funky layout so you stand in line in the middle of the restaurant with people eating around you, and then you have the pleasure of standing in front of the bathroom when you order your food, which seems a bit too close for comfort.\n\nService - Sure, I know it's a new restaurant and all, but service is maddeningly slow - which would be so easy to fix. How many people does it take to make a roll? At Kasa I counted 1) the woman who asks you what you would like and is in charge of the rolls and then spreads the chutney (again, as if it was being rationed) 2) the guy who gets the tray and asks again what you've ordered and makes the roll. 3) the guy who scoops the raita and salad. I think I waited 10 minutes in line and 5 for the making of one roll.  You can also look in the back kitchen and see loads of people - not sure why speed wasn't emphasized - go into any burrito joint and they speed down the line. Each of the servers seemed timid, unsure of the serving sizes. Also darn hard to hear what they are saying. \n\nThe people who work there are friendly and all, but they look and act like they should be working at a clothing store instead of a fast food indian restaurant. Maybe they should hire some people who've worked at a taqueria to teach them some operational tricks.\n\nValue - I think the value is OK, but the serving sizes could be notched up just a bit\n\nI would like to like this restaurant more, but I get so frustrated at the wait and slow service.", "author": "Spoon G."}

I wouldn't say we were all close friends in school and have had little contact since graduation, but for the first time ever, we made an effort to catch up. One of them suggested a \"good Indian place\" in the Castro and so we decided to eat at Kasa. The unusual and enjoyable food complemented the unusual and enjoyable company quite well.\n\nI don't know if Kati Rolls are some popular new fad and I am behind the times or what, but this was the first time I had encountered Indian food like this. Being my first time, I decided to get the 3 roll combo in order to try several flavors. I ordered a potato roll, lamb roll, and a chicken tikka masala roll. My favorite was by far the lamb and the chicken tikka masala was quite good. I opted to have the roti in the potato roll dipped in egg first and that was a mistake. The combination of fried egg and potato gave it more of a breakfast burrito taste...not so much bad as just unwanted. Quality-wise the 3 rolls were a bargain for the $11.95. Quantity-wise, I was stuffed.\n\nThey are served with a smear of raita on a bare metal plate. I can't say they get points for presentation...it really looks prison-esque.\n\nI suppose it is obvious and glib to describe the food as Indian burritos, but describing the establishment as an Indian taqueria is apt. Like any decent burrito joint, I would frequent it if it was in my neighborhood, but doesn't warrant a trek.\n\nSo, sadly, like the dinner with those former classmates, I think Kasa will be a one time thing.", "author": "Matthew C."}

But when I do it, I want to do it right!\n\nSo, the reason I am writing about Kasa is because it was SUCH A SURPRISE!\n\nAs mentioned before, I am Indian and am too lazy (and untalented) to cook up the intricate dishes that my mom makes. So if I can't get homemade food, I will take my chances with the various Indian restaurants around. This is not always the most satisfying solution to my cravings. And my parents (esp. my dad) refuse to even go to the typical Indian restaurant because of the oil-sitting-in-your-stomach-afterwards feeling! Also, why spend money on food that tastes like it has been sitting around for days when the food is so good at home.\n\nBut after leaving Chicago, I have finally found my replacement for my mom's home cooked food. Yes, I do enjoy the occasional greasy, overly done Indian dish - but only so often. And I don't feel happy about it afterwards. However, finding an Indian restaurant that is CLEAN! COOL! DELICIOUS and AUTHENTIC was something I was not expecting in SF.  Kasa is a place that I could eat at more than a few times a week.\n\nI've eaten the kati rolls and thali dishes about 4 or 5 times so far. And since other reviewers have explained these dishes I won't go into that. What I will say is that it is an unbelievable deal for the price. If you non-Indians had any idea what is involved in creating REAL INDIAN food, you would realize that this place is actually underpriced! I had a hard time finishing my thalis yet still WANTED TO LICK THE PLATE (which is also authentic!) The amount and quality of this food is way more than the price. I am actually offended to read some of the reviews from people who think it is overpriced and not authentic. \n\nYou must be the same people who think that you can find delicious, authentic and well-priced Chinese food at Panda Express!\n\nI just wanted to write about how I have finally found an Indian restaurant that I actually am starting to become addicted to but after reading reviews, feel like I need to defend my ethnicity's home-cooked food from people who think they know what good indian food is.

I got the paneer roll and I really liked the paneer, it was nice and firm and tasted pretty fresh. The filling and veggies were a little dry and they do give you a generous helping of raita but I guess I'm such a curry girl that I prefer the tikka masalas (yes I know they're not authentic.) Everything was still tasty though. And don't miss out on the mango juice! So good. So overall, I wasn't so wowed that I would seek this place out but I'd definitely consider it if I was in the area.", "author": "Cathy T."}

From its clean and well kept kitchen exposed for all to see, you would not know you stepped into an establishment that serve exotic dishes, except for the four large photographs of Indian street life hung on one side of the wall.\n\nWithout any outward adornments, and a pared down menu of either a kati roll or thali plate, make your selection buffet-style and grab your plate after you paid your meal. Okay, this must be cheap. Value over service...right? Perhaps if you took one kati roll and called it day, but a thali plate is not what I call \"cheap\".\n\nWe had dinner and chose the thali plate that cold evening amid a less-than-handful of diners.  Served on a chrome chinet plate, my suspicion of \"cafeteria\" apparently was not too far off the mark.\n\nStyle over warmth: that's how my butt felt on those cold aluminum stools.\n\nMind you, we are not neophytes to Indian cuisine: we've eaten in plenty of indian/pakistani enclaves in the Mission, Tenderloin, Berkeley, and Fremont areas and even in London.\n\nWith the Cure and Cyndi Lauper quietly echoing in our eardrums while we ate, the \"value\" concept was quickly replaced with longings for decrepit, roach infested hole-in-the-wall steamy windowed restaurants with Indians actually cooking Indian meals with tables full of people laughing and animated, ripping off chunks of naan and being served sizzling pungent iron plates of Tandoori chicken or fish that smoke up half the room.

Depending on the time of day it can get really busy but there is ample seating. I especially like the communal table in the middle with the high bar stools.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-19", "description": "General summary is that this place is overpriced (priced out of being \"fast food,\" which kati rolls should be)  but it's very good and I'll be going back for more.  If a bit cheaper, this would be a more solid 4 stars (I'm thinking 3.5 right now, and giving them the bump due to the beer surprise described below).\n\nThe kati rolls are excellent, though a bit small.  The chicken tikka was cooked with wood or charcoal, with that excellent charred flavor, which is great.  I was initially concerned that the meat was already cooked sitting at the counter, but it was clear it had just recently been cooked, so staleness (especially the little charcoal-burned bits on the chicken going soft) was not an issue (hope that's always the case).\n\nThe parathas are nice and flaky without being too greasy.  A bit more greasy would be a bit more tasty, but I prefer it this way-- they strike the right balance for me here.  Finally, the paneer roll was excellent, really a worthy substitute for the chicken tikka, which is great news.  Another slight minus for not offering unda rolls, which would really complete the experience.  \n\nThe staff is super friendly.  The place is amazingly clean for a kati roll joint, and the seating very clean, spacious and airy, which almost feels a bit off (I'm used to grease, crowds, noise, and a hole in the wall atmosphere), but it's very comfortable.\n\nThe icing on this cake is that they serve Tripel Karmeliet on draft!!!!  Not very Indian, but bonus points for mixing 2 of my favorite things in the world (kati rolls an tripel karmeliet).", "author": "r h."}

The menu is very limited. This is somewhat understandable because of the limited kitchen space, but some more variety could be added - particularly in the appetizer and dessert categories (how about some pakoras and samosas, or different pooris on different days). A small restaurant needs to distinguish itself - adding dosas to the menu would do that.\n2. The limited offerings were just run of the mill and very bland, though attractively presented. The kitchen is definitely spice challenged. It would have been more palatable to me if at least some spicy Indian pickle were offered. But alas!\n3. Roti is the only Indian bread offered.

From each bite you can tell the ingredients are quality and the meats aren't greasy or too salty. Many of the other Indian and Pakistani restaurants in town may be cheaper, but the environment is not as enjoyable and the owners and staff of Kasa treat you with care and a smile. It is also a very kid friendly restaurant (they have booster seats/high chairs) :), today one of the owners asked if my toddler was enjoying the food and asked if it was to spicy. It (the chicken tikka masala) was actually a bit too spicy and she offered us a tot sized portion of the grilled chicken which was less spicy.

I have tried the jeera aloo, karahi paneer, and aloo gobi rolls. The karahi paneer isn't worth having. The other two rolls are great. You can get a thali, which I feel is a bit too expensive, and the main dish's proportion becomes too much. Parking is hard to find. All in all, a welcome unique place in SF", "author": "Kuldeep T."}

Unlike many Indian places, the food at Kasa is a great value, is served quickly and without pretense. The menu is very simple, primarily kati rolls, either regular or Unda style in a couple of configurations. Fast, filling, and tasty food at a great price. If you're looking to be immersed in an Indian cultural experience, then perhaps Kasa might not be your cup of chai. There are no pictures of the Taj Mahal, no Shivas, no employees in brightly dyed traditional clothing - nope, the interior design is bright white with tasteful black and white photography adorning the walls. Instead of some Hindi music, they were playing some nice hip hop last time I was in. For me, this refreshing approach places the emphasis where it belongs - squarely on the delicious food. Bon appetit.", "author": "diego a."}

Some days I get full off of one kati roll, but other days I need two. The rolls themselves aren't too big, but for some reason they're really filling. They are a little expensive, but the price never stops me from ordering them. I do need to get more adventurous with the filling though; I always order chicken tikka masala.", "author": "Joseph C."}

I love my food with fresh ingredients and lots of flavor. This is what Kasa delivers. The time the chief Anamika Khana takes to marinate her vegetables, organic chicken, lamb, and turkey comes through in every bite. I usually do not eat Indian food because it is too spicy, but these dishes are just right. If you need your food super spicy hot they have chutney that will put some fire up you know where. Check out Kasa you will not be disappointed!", "author": "Marty G."}

Tasty, fresh, friendly--the owner stopped by while we were eating lunch to see how we liked it.  Spicy with a great cooling raita.  I fully intend to stop here OFTEN and bring lots of friends.  You should too.  As has been noted a refreshing alternative to burrito night.", "author": "Katharine D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-04", "description": "We've been here a few times now and we dig it, both for dine-in and for take-out.  It's not a typical Indian restaurant at all but satisfying in part for how different is from typical Indian joints. The kati rolls are the real specialty and they fill them with lots of tasty choices, but our favorites are the chicken tikka masala (spicy, but not overly saucy) and the lamb curry with potatoes (very full of flavor but not overpowering), though we've had a bunch of the veggie ones too and they're also strong.  Only complaint is that the roti are pretty greasy, which is great but if you eat two or more kati rolls, you feel a little blech.  The plates are a good value too - you still get one roti and you feel a little better at the end of the meal.  The decor has never made a lot of sense to me - it doesn't really sync with the comfort food being served - and it prevents Kasa from being a place I'd go for a real sit-down meal.  But we've brought our 1-year old a couple of times and they've been very accommodating.  It's the only Indian restaurant near the Castro, so it fills an important niche, and fills my belly too.", "author": "Warren B."}
