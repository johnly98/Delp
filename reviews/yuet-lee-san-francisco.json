Somehow YL comes to the rescue for all of the above crowd and hits the right notes with their food, like Stan Getz and Antonio Carlos Jobim serenading their lesser known Bossanova classic with noblimente, \"The greasy stir fry from Ipanema\".\n\nIn any case, no excuses are needed really to come here. You could even have a mediocre meal at say, Michelin Star Mister Jiu's, and feel that you need some blue collar Cantonese \"izakaya\" style delights in order to send you home more satisfied.\n\nThere's so much going on in the menu here. For best results, get well versed in the Dark Side of the Cantonese food force. And figure out what they do well, quickly.\n\nQuick, fast, hot food is the order of business here. So get dishes that focus on intense wok stir fry (or if deep fry is your thang) and have a chit ton of flavor. The magical combinations of grease, intensity of the wok sear and heat, and umami together (from the soy sauce and other ingredients) will create some magical chemical reactions that send your brain roaring and yearning for more. And if you already have enough alcohol in your system, so much the better!\n\nI don't know what it is, but seriously, alcohol makes the food taste better here. Especially if it is already in your system. But you are more than welcome to start sober, then down a few ice cold beers during dinner and see for yourself if it gets gradually better (or try a meal here without any alcohol in your system or during dinner).\n\nTried so far:\n\nSingapore stir fried rice noodles - it's not bad, and if you have the munchies this works nicely\n\nSoy sauce supreme fried noodles - it's a decent rendition during the late hour, and is almost always a de facto dish that needs to be tried if you have quite a bit of seafood and need some carbs at the end (instead of a fried rice)\n\nBeef chow fun (dry fried) - A touch greasy but the remainder of the plate has no excess pool of disgust. A very notable and worthy rendition and the wok sear is intense and so aromatic, when you eat it right away (hint, don't let it sit!). Every strip of rice noodle (ho fun) is coated beautifully with the soy sauce. For better results, add a little chili sauce for some acidity, bit of a kick, and cutting the grease.\n\nSweet and sour pork (I believe the sauce is made with sour plum of some sort) - it's a very interesting prep where it is a touch saucy, and is very different than the typical ketchup pineapple vinegar version. It works but it's not the greatest\n\nPeking spareribs - this one is actually far superior. There is actually some complexity in the orange themed marinade and the wok stir fry sear intensifies that quite a bit. Much better than the sweet and sour pork. Grease is goodness here.\n\nPork belly, fermented shrimp paste and tofu clay pot \u5927\u99ac\u7ad9\u7172 - the control of the savory, the umami, and the aromatics is pretty intense with this. Fermented shrimp paste can be overpowering but they did it right here. The addition of chives really brings it all together. The tofu is the star here, surprisingly. \n\nNo doubt other stir fry classics like ones involving crab, or salt pepper squid are requirements here. But don't be afraid to venture a bit further out, and get out of the Panda Express Moo Shoo Poo Poo Doo Doo side...it seems the YL galaxy is a bit wider and versatile than previously thought...", "author": "Ken K."}

Correctly or incorrectly, I've always associated it with being more of a tourist-centric spot. This time, I was invited by a friend to join her and her mother, both of whom have great taste in Cantonese cuisine, and was pleasantly pleased with our meal.\n\nDefinitely Get:  The whole steamed fish, simply, but deliciously prepared with ginger, green onions and cilantro.  It's my favorite method of preparation, and it was executed flawlessly.  Moist, tender, flaky.  I could eat this everyday, seriously.\n\nWe also had a veggie, which I don't know the English or Chinese name to, but it's in my picture, and it belongs within the cauliflower family.  It's something that isn't on many menus that I've seen, and it was done well.\n\nThe deep fried tofu itself was good, but I didn't care for the sauce that topped it.  I'm not into sauces at all, and the tofu would've certainly held its own sans any sauce of any kind.\n\nThe salt and pepper calamari was good, and is a dish listed as one of their specialties.  I probably would venture trying other dishes before doing a repeat of this.\n\nThey also serve lobster, which looked really darn good! So good that I'm tempted to return simply to get that.  I believe it was approximately $35.00/lb., which isn't at all bad, given that it would easily be twice as much in a haute restaurant.  \n\nNo ambiance to speak of.  No thrills, no frills, basic hole in the wall place, with corresponding service, but good food, if you select correctly, at a very good price point.", "author": "Lori N."}

The noodles are laced with crack that will keep you dreaming about them days after, plotting your return to this secret house of flavor. The late-night seeker of sustenance will count himself lucky if he happens to stumble upon this noodley siren-call station.\n\nI love their family-style service and attitude. It's the perfect Chinese Diner feel for Chinatown, and yes, they are open late! As a former New Yorker, I deeply appreciate any food-serving establishment open past 12, as most of them close by then, or earlier, at least in the Chinatown district.\n\nI've heard there's an early bird discount on weekdays. They also have very generous portion sizes. Needless to say, with the new laws, you might consider this as a post 4:20 PM field trip. This will answer the munchie craving better than any bag of fritos. Proceed at your own risk, however, for your taste buds will never settle for an old, dry, crunchy snack again when you could be eating from the succulent dishes at Yuet Lee.

I believe this is a different owner since having Anthony Bourdain, Jackie Chan, Emeril Lagasse, and Guy Fieri. I came here because during lunch it was the only place that was pretty empty and had no wait time. Well, I should have taken that as a hint that it was not good. At lunch time on a Sunday and it's slow and all the other places on Broadway is busy. Hmmm. I had ordered some jook(rice porridge) with sturgeon. The porridge you can tell had gelatin to thicken it up. Not good. I had already had jook yesterday somewhere else in Chinatown and that place had phenomenal jook. (See my review of Yee's Restaurant) I also ordered a simple Chef's special chow mein which had seafood, beef, chicken, and pork. It was decent but I wouldn't come here just for the chow mein. I think anyone who sees the man in the picture with all the celebrities should know that that is a different guy and different owner, cause the food now is not so hot and it would be best to find a busier place to visit in Chinatown.", "author": "Patrick T."}

We were never rushed out from the restaurant, though they did warn us they would be cleaning up while we ate. \n\nWe ordered the parsley with minced pork porridge and the beef & egg rice noodle dish. Both entrees were very good. I liked the flavor that the minced pork brought into the porridge, no soy sauce necessary! The chicken rice noodle dish was not greasy at all and tasted delicious. While this was not necessarily the best Chinese food I have had, Yuet Lee definitely serves up  better and fresher food than many of the other competitor restaurants around Chinatown!\n\nI can find myself here again if I need a healthy fix of Chinese food. But if you are looking for late night Chinese eats, you might have to head down the street to New Sun Hong Kong Restaurant.", "author": "Philip M."}

They do 'force' you to leave a certain amount of gratuity despite being basically MIA the entire time, or being super rude when they do actually give you attention (I really don't know what's worse). The place is also very dingy and truthfully the only reason that I or anyone else goes here is mere convenience as it is open late and the location is close to where I live. \n\nThe food itself is decent at best and oftentimes I question the quality or origin of some of the meat being used since some of it has a really gross chewy texture. Given how cheap they are about their tip policy, I wouldn't put it past them to partake in sourcing some sort of domestic animal or rodent just to save a few bucks. The kicker is that the food is also pretty expensive especially for what it is. \n\nI usually go for Elaine's Kitchen down the street for my Chinese comfort food needs - the food and service are leaps and bounds ahead of this place, and the prices are much more reasonable for the quality and quantity of food (especially their weekday lunch special which can't be beat). Unfortunately, Elaine's is only open until 10pm so only pure desperation will ever bring me back to Yuet Lee ever again...

The chow fun was not overly greasy and had the right amount of flavor.  Duck was authentic.  The cost was also reasonable as well.  \n\nThe restaurant was small and a bit clustered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-01", "description": "After hitting up China Town, my parents and I were starving and decided to eat somewhere nearby since the BNB we were staying at was in Pacifica. On the way back to the car, my Dad spots this place adorned with the photos of the owner with various hosts from Travel Channel and Food Network (ie Samantha Brown and Andrew Zimmern), plus the Zagat stickers from 2011 - 2014. I checked the reviews on Yelp and it had 4 stars so it must be good right? So we decided to eat here.\n\nLittle did we know we were about to embark on the most uncomfortable dining experience ever! It was terrible. If somebody from the restaurant is reading this, it was the Host and the Cook who helped serve the food working Sunday, 8/31/2014 Labor Day weekend, around 8:30pm. They are the ones who gave my parents and I terrible service and ONLY reason why I'm writing this college paper length Yelp Review.\n\nOkay.\n\nFirst of all, when the Host (middle age Asian man, gray hair, glasses) took our orders, he did not come across very well. He sounded like he was annoyed. I tried to shrug it off because it was Labor Day weekend, but nope! When he came back to arrange our table, this guy haphazardly tossed our napkins before us. Now I'm not a stickler for placing napkins on a table - nobody should be - but I'm pretty sure a Host does/should not toss napkins in front of the guests. For the plates, he arranged the table super rushed and sloppy like he wanted to get away from us.\n\nShortly after that, an Asian man in a white button up shirt (I can assume he was a Cook) came over with a bowl, placed it onto the table and walked away...without telling us what it was! The hell? My parents and I were staring at each other blankly wondering what it was. It wasn't until Mr Grumpy Host came back shortl to let us know it was the Chicken Noodle Soup my Mom ordered. The Cook came out again and placed a plate of noodles on the table and murmured a barely coherent 'Noodles'. That was my Dad's Vegetable Noodle order, so he sheepishly rose his had to accept the dish. Shortly after that, the Cook came back with the Clam with Black and Pepper Sauce. This time he just handed it to me. The hell? This guy didn't even talk to us!\n\nThe WORST part of this dining experience came while my parents and I started eating. In our peripheral, we could see the Host leaning against the table next to us. We were NOT the only party there. We were at a table close to the BACK of the place. There was at least 4-5 other parties in the restaurant, so why stand there facing our table? Shouldn't you be closer to the door or maybe even looking at the door? \n\nSo here we are, trying to eat and this guy is watching us! Awkward and uncomfortable! I couldn't fully enjoy that delicious Clam dish and that dish was REALLY good. You could tell the clams were fresh and the meal was very hearty. I've never had clams made outside of a Progresso Clam Chowder can, so I was very satisfied. But I couldn't fully enjoy my dish with a middle aged Asian man hovering over me, watching my family and I eat. When I requested more water, this guy sounded even more annoyed. Okay seriously, was this guy scheduled when Zagat, The Food Network, and The Travel Channel stopped by? Or was he on his best behavior? \n\nThe entire time we were there I never saw him once, check on ANY other table except to just deliver their food. He just stood there next to OUR table, watching. To make it worse, that table he was leaning on had a group of people on their phones. Not eating, just sitting there and playing on their phones. These people had to have worked there because the Host didn't say anything to them either.\n\nWhen we were done, he never asked us if we needed a doggy bag or if we were ready for the check. He overheard us talk about the check and a doggy bag AND THEN brought it to us. This guy really did NOT deserve any tip at all. As soon as my parents decide to leave the change for him, we were out of there ASAP. \n\nOutside, my parents were LIVID! My mom too, was mad about how he tossed the napkins on the table and my Dad was saying that he felt really uncomfortable being watched. So it wasn't just me feeling this way. They too felt that this restaurant gave us terrible service.\n\nSo overall, despite my Clam Dish being exceptionally delicious (I'm smiling thinking about it), that's the ONLY reason I'm giving this place 2 stars. One for how good it was and another for the freshness of the clams. Other than that, terrible service combined with a VERY uncomfortable dining experience docked it the other three stars.", "author": "Janel B."}

First, Yuet Lee appears to serve dishes that are consistently not hot enough, ie., lukewarm at best.  The chow mein and beef stew in noodle soup we had today didn't have much more than a hint of bok choy; and the beef stew (ngow nom) looked like resuscitated old meat with an excess of untrimmed fat. Secondly, since when do restaurant personnel have the right or authority to insist on what THEY regard to be a decent tip?  This isn't the only establishment in Chinatown that haggles with customers about the size of tips.  [At least one restaurant in J-Town is notorious for intimidating customers into leaving bigger tips.]  Well, this WAS a convenient eatery that now and again, depending on the chef on duty's mood and other factors, served some semblance of a decent Chinese dish.

We had a party of 5 and we were starving after the whole day. The employees seated us quickly and we began to order. We started out with 5 dishes. Unfortunately for us, the portions were much smaller than those served at many other Chinese restaurants. On top of the small portions, everything looked good but tasted SOO BLAND (EXCEPT THE PORRIDGE. That was fine.) We ordered 3-4 more dishes, hoping for better quality and actually leaving with a full stomach. The next few dishes were just as bland; very disappointing. At least the cook on the dishes was good. \n\nI did leave the restaurant full, but I probably ate around a third of all the food. With a bill totaling ~$120 before tax and tip for 8-9 bland dishes, I definitely do not recommend this restaurant. The quality of food and portion served is NOT worth the price. However, it does open late so if you are in the area for a small bite, it's a good option. \n\nHm.. just to close off, I would like to say we didn't get the salt & pepper prawns Anthony Bourdain recommended.

The dish came with squid, scallops and shrimp (that were a little tired and not super fresh).  The chow mein noodles here are really thin (like vermicelli) and always come out dark like they were cooked in a bunch of soy sauce.  But, it doesn't taste salty.  So, I think the oil is just old and dark.  In fact, when I ate it, I had to add soy sauce to give it a bit more flavor.\n\nYuet Lee is an institution and there are pictures of famous people and Chefs on the walls.  Perhaps when the Cooks spot the famous people, they make much more extra effort to put out good food with high quality ingredients.\n\nSince I'm not famous, I'm just going to have to focus on eating at places that consistently serve high quality food at a fair price.\n\nGiven how much Asian food I eat, I'd say my rating is fair when compared to the other Chinese restaurants I have rated.

A reasonable question, since 8 of us were seated but only 6 of us ate, places usually charge 18-20% for parties of 6 or more. The waiter said (in Chinese of course) \"For OUTSIDERS we charge gratuity, but for INSIDERS we don't.\" So hooray for being a group of Asian kids and my boyfriend for speaking fluent Chinese?

The waitresses were rude as they were slamming our dishes down onto the table and snapped at us when we asked for things. The biggest issue however was the mandatory tip they made us pay.  For the horrible service, that made us pay 15% but calculated wrong and it turned out to be over 20% in tip.  Additionally, they added the tax over everything including the tip, so we had to end up paying even more.  As we were leaving, we heard the manager of the store yelling at the waitresses telling them to not tell customers about the tip anymore.  This place obviously tries to scam their clients and I will not be coming back.", "author": "Derek V."}

I took my Caucasian friends here for an exception, Kam Po. But it has closed down for the night when we arrived. YL was the closest choice. It opened late. Customers were Asian tourists and non-Asians. The foods were typical mediocre Chinese cooking for tourists, in a not too \"hole on the wall\" setting. I can't complain about the foods knowing what to expect before walking in, except one thing, they charged American price. $$$\n\nThere are 50 plus Chinese restaurants around this area with better (relatively speaking) and cheaper foods. Maybe only a few handful open late.\n\nWhat I don't get was their lousy service. First, it's a small restaurant. Then there were at least 4 wait staffs. We didn't get much service unless you call ordering and placing foods/beverages on our table as service (I call it minimal requirement for getting money from us). And serving us soup from the big bowl to small bowls once. There was no water. No refill of my small cup of tea. No checking on us. We were practically being left alone. I had to ask for our check. This was poorer service than typical Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe waitress questioned my small tip. And cursed after my explanation for lousy service.\n\nThe irony thing is that if they want to serve Chinese style, like minimal service, don't expect much tips. If they want tips, work their hands and feet for it. My grandmother always said money don't grow from tree... but maybe it did in their village.\n\nI don't like to pay for insult in short. And I prefer some Chinese standard service. Good luck on your visit!", "author": "Zack W."}

He always wants to go here if we're around the North Beach/Chinatown area.  Unfortunately, we never get to go because Yuet Lee doesn't open that late.  Luckily for me, today, I got a chance to take my parents here.  We didn't order anything exotic.  Although, I almost ordered the salt & pepper whole crab.  I should have, I think it would have been wickedly good.\n\nMy parents and I got to try the Boiled Chicken w/ Ginger and Green Onions,  Salt & Pepper Pork Spareribs, Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice, and an Abalone and Chicken Noodle Soup.  I didn't care too much for the Abalone and Chicken Noodle Soup, but everything else was great!  The boiled chicken was so delicious.  I even at some skin which I usually don't.  The Salted Fish & Chicken Fried Rice was just great!  It was definitely one of the best salted fish and chicken fried rice dishes I've ever had.  And, the Salt & Pepper Spareribs were just as good.  They could have gave a few more though.  For $11, we really didn't get much, compared to other Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe lady that waited on us was cool!  She was on top of things, and extremely helpful and patient.  For a Chinatown restaurant, it's absolutely worth a try in my book.  Read their top 10 dishes that I failed to see before ordering.  They have it posted on the walls.  It looked like a good guide to order the right things at Yuet Lee.", "author": "Jules S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-01-09", "description": "It was my first time eating here. When I went into the restaurant, it was small.  It look bigger from the outside. I saw them preparing wontons on one of the dining tables. Raw meat and veggies.  I didn't want to see that while I was eating. There were flies flying around. Some of them landed on my food. Finally some of the people on my party got sick from eating the food.  Stomach ache. We ordered four dishes a clam plate a shrimp plate a sweet-and-sour pork plate and a plate of barbecue beef. We also had rice. When we were done the bill totaled $65. Including eight dollar tip we paid a total of $70. It was expensive. Also, each plate was very small in portion.  It was my first time eating there and it is definitely my last time.  I do not recommend anyone going there to eat.  When in Chinatown, all the other restaurants have big portions and are not as expensive.  \n\nThis place is expensive and the potions are very small.  Maybe that's why they give you smaller serving plates.  Everything is served in this small size oval plates.  The eating plate they give you is also small.  So when you put food on it, it'll look like a lot.  Just take a look at all the posted pictures and you'll see what I'm talking about.  Don't be fooled by the pictures.  They looks like a big plate of food, but in actuality, the actual plate holding the food is so much smaller compared to any other restaurant.  And that's what gives the illusion that it's a big full plate.\n\nThen they serve rice in this big bowl.  When we were out, we asked for more rice.  What did the waiter do??  She didn't take that same big rice bowl to give us more rice, she took one of the unused eating rice bowl and give use that little rice.  Really??\n\nThe actual menu is a joke.  Looks like some a kindergarten class put it together  with all the cut out strips of paper that was glued onto the menu to cover up other items and prices.  With the price they're gouging from the customers, you would expect them to have better looking physical menus.\n\nIt's not even a high class restaurant.  I don't know what it's so expensive.  For that money, I can take it elsewhere and have a 5 star meal without flies touching my food and not have to see raw meat being prepared on the dining table next to me.", "author": "Jack L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-18", "description": "I can't believe that I've never reviewed Yuet Lee, given that I've been coming here for 19 years. My then-partner and I discovered it around New Year's after getting out of a late show; the Stanford students' guide (in those pre-web days) listed it as one of the gems of late-night dining, and recommended their still-famous salt & pepper squid. We were hooked, and it became a tradition for me when in SF. \n\nThe cuisine is mostly Hong Kong/Cantonese with a heavy emphasis on seafood, though there are some meat and vegetarian items on the menu for those who don't eat seafood. Chicken in ginger sauce and beef chow fun are both good. The wor noodle soups seem to have been removed from the menu, but on our most recent visit we got the wor dumpling soup (no noodles, but both shrimp and pork dumplings); the soup was so good that my partner, who dislikes most seafood, gave me the shrimps and scarfed down the rest of the soup. \n\nSalt & pepper squid is one of their specialties (they do the same treatment with prawns, but I've never ordered them). I have to admit that the squid varies somewhat from visit to visit. Sometimes it has tons of pepper and is very spicy; last time it was more like a squid tempura. The batter is always light and crisp, balancing the slight chewiness of the squid, and it comes with a jalapeno/soy/cilantro dipping sauce. \n\nLike many smaller restaurants in Chinatown, they prefer cash. Service is brusque but fast. The atmosphere is more divey/hole in the wall than fancy, but the food is consistently good.", "author": "Cage H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-09", "description": "Yuet Lee is an SF Chinatown institution and rightly so. For one thing, it's opened late--to around 3am I think--and thus draws in an eclectic crowd of clubbers, locals, cops and other interesting folks in the wee hours. Also, it's a superb example of the classic, no-frills, Cantonese seafood house. The emphasis is on fresh, diverse, dishes and the menu is long and varied enough to live up to this mission with items such as salted fish with diced chicken & bean cake, sauteed crab, fresh crab in curry sauce, pepper and salt roast spareribs and braised catfish with black bean & roast pork. \n\nThe clay pot dishes--such as the aforementioned catfish--are superb but I have never had any form of seafood here that I didn't enjoy. The serving sizes are more than ample and often downright generous and while the service can be impersonal to a degree, it is mostly prompt--you don't expect the staff to fawn over the patrons in a place like this, either. Other stand-out dishes include their soups, especially the General Li's Mixed Ingredients Soup however their won-ton soup is even quite good--you really cannot go wrong with Yuet Lee. I would advise possibly coming here around nine at night--after the dinner rush but before they get far into the night and perhaps out of some things.", "author": "Mike W."}

That is, until this weekend when we arrived late at night from LA starving and craving some authentic Asian food. Right away I knew this would be the perfect opportunity to finally try this neon green beacon of light. That, and San Tung was already closed for the night. \n\nFirst of all, the fact that this place is located where it is and open till 3am earns it at least three stars all on its own. But even beyond its convenience, Yuet Lee serves up some yummy and authentic tasting (at least to this Korean) Chinese food that really hits the spot. \n\nI ordered the beef with tomato over rice and although I felt that it was a bit skimpy on the beef, I enjoyed the flavor of the sauce and the portion was hearty for the price (I think under $7). Cody P got the chicken broth with noodles and although he was afraid it would just taste like his usual chicken noodle soup, this one definitely had that Asian punch to it... something about the broth that was more pungent and Asian tasting, though it's hard to describe how. The egg noodles were plentiful and Cody P was very happy with his choice, especially after washing it down with a cold Tsing Tao. \n\nThe servers aren't very chatty or gregarious but they're on their shit and they get the stuff out quickly. The ambiance, as anyone who has been inside can tell you, is nothing to write home about but that's part of the charm...

I know I came in sweats, since I live just a block away, but the waitress treated me like I was a teenage delinquent. I wanted just the plain rice porridge, and she immediately grabbed my menu away from me and said that they don't serve that, and gave me a look to imply that I should leave. \n\nI was confused why there was no rice porridge, since it is listed plainly on their menu, so I asked if it is an item that is just out today (weird for a staple food item to be out before the dinner hour even hits). She said that I was not allowed to order the plain rice porridge on its own and could only get it if I bought it in conjunction with another porridge that had meat in it. I don't think that they should list an item on the menu if they won't sell it, and I think that if she didn't want to sell me the rice porridge on its own, she should have let me look through the menu still and pick another item instead of hastily dismissing me.\n\nI don't usually let one experience at a restaurant discourage me from ever returning again, but after today's trip, I can say plainly that I will never come back again.", "author": "Melody L."}

It is actually on the border of North Beach/China town just a couple blocks from Columbus.\n\nI ALWAYS get the oft raved about Pepper and Salt Roasted Fresh Squids ($13.25).  This is one of the best squid dishes I have had the pleasure of partaking in.....ever!  A little salty, a whole bunch crispy and very meaty.  Divine stuff indeed.\n\nTook the lady friend for her first time here and she wanted some basic food as we were starving from the long drive from OC.  She chose the Braised Noodles With Ginger And Onions.  These are thin, about the size of vermicelli.  It was subtle in its complexity with VERY fresh julienned ginger, nice dish.\n\nWe also settled on Young Chow Fried Rice that was your typical Chinese rice dish with bay shrimp and pork.  \n\nAll of this came from the tiny kitchen that is no more than 10 steps away so hot one has to wait a few minutes for it to cool.  I usually come here for a late lunch, so can't speak to the late drunken crowds yelped on but everything I have had here has been great, even while sober.  This time the squid was a little oily but the oil was not greasy, just a tad heavy handed going into the wok.\n\nMake sure you check out the kitchen, I love how every square inch is utilized with woks and pans steaming away.  And to address some of the complaints re; surly service; thats just the way it is in these old school Chinese places.

What a bad experience for our friends from France who wanted to try good Chinese food and good service..and they didn't get ANY. The food was served in SMALL PORTIONS and OVER PRICED. Too oily!! Moreover, the service was UNACCEPTABLE!! They included 20% to the bill saying it was for the MANDATORY tip...(they said it was 15% but we did the math..20%). We got mad and we left less than 10% and the waitress came over saying \"that's why we put the tip in the bill, because you people don't leave anything\" . She was mad..but it got worse. The owner's brother came over trying to defend her employees saying that the tip on the bill is not mandatory, it's just a suggestion, but we told him he shouldn't do that. He got also mad and KICKED US OUT of the restaurant. He even threw our tip on the floor..but of course, he picked it up later. The worst part came after I realized I forgot my sunglasses and left them on the table. When I came back...my sunglasses were gone. All the employees said they didn't see any sunglasses..BULLSHIT!! My sunglasses were there...I saw the waitress cleaning the table when we were arguing with the owner (we were very calm, just talking, the owner's brother started YELLING..so LOW CLASS ).

We took a seat and the Asian lady took my friend and I's order. Everything was okay up until the Asian man with gray hair and glasses began to stare at us THE ENTIRE TIME WE ATE. He occasionally walks by every couple of minutes and just stands next to us as we eat. I couldn't eat because he just stared at us and I felt so disrespected. When they came to get the payment, the cook came out and said, \"no tip\"? We were going to pay the full price then tip afterwards but we ended up just throwing a dollar on and just left.

I love watching wiggly crabs and big dopey fish!\n\nI was the only person in the restaurant so got a little more attention than I would like, but in general I really enjoyed my time here.  I got a nice big soup and some beer.  I wish I remember what the soup was called - it was really tasty and had rice noodles, chicken and mushrooms among other things.  The bowl was large and reasonably priced.\n\nAs a tourist, it was really great to come here and be able to relax right by a window, have a great meal and people-watch.  They have tons of tables right by the windows, and mine had a prime viewing spot of Stockton Street - the market across the street and the bustling crowds going through the busy intersection (Broadway?).  DC's Chinatown has long ceased to be an authentic one, and people-watching there you really just see tourists, Caps fans, and yuppies.  So I really appreciated being able to sit here in San Francisco and see a real Chinatown!\n\nI would come back here next time I am in the area for the people-watching experience and for the reasonable \"early bird\" prices.  Though glancing through the menu, it seemed some of their full-price entrees are more expensive than I would have expected.  Maybe because there were a lot of seafood dishes, but still, I would think cheaper entrees could be found at some of the other restaurants around the block.

Someone had suggested Golden Boy Pizza but after waiting in the ridiculous line for about 15 minutes, we decided we were too hungry to wait any longer for their clam and garlic pizza and opted for another place.\n\nEnter Chinatown. We live in NB and wanted to eat somewhere close because 1) we were hungry and 2) we were drunk and probably not coherent enough to make it anywhere more than a few blocks away. So me and my handy-dandy Yelp app on my phone find places nearby that are open. Aka Yuet Lee. It's open 'til 3am. SO CLUTCH.\n\nWe start wandering down Stockton and find it after a few minutes. It is POPPIN'. At 2:15 in the morning! We walk in and are seated right away despite it being busy. I remember it being half-full of people ending a night out and half-full of regular people who were just finishing up their dinner. At 2am? Really? Weird. Anyways, we ordered the veggie chow mein ($7.95? I think) and clams in black bean sauce ($13.95). The order came ridiculously fast (I mean, this IS a Chinese restaurant so I guess I shouldn't really be surprised). Both were pretty good.

That's what I told my visiting East-Coast friend and we sought out this place due to numerous recommendations.\n\nAfter luckily finding a parking spot for our rented blue Mustang convertible a block away, we walked in and got seated right before a steady flow of customers entered. It was mostly a non-Asian group, which is always a warning sign if the ethnic group of your ethnic restaurant isn't represented that well. \n\nThis is the bare-basics style of cheap booths and tables, with gaudy Chinese d\u00e9cor.  The restaurant did sport a number of celebrities photos on the wall - all endorsing the place, including Jackie Chan, Chef Emril, and Hideki Matsui.   \n\nService was cold yet competent and our food came out as soon as they were cooked, a few minutes after each other. \n\nThe first dish was my favorite - Salt and Pepper Squid ($13.25). It's the current #1 in their top 10 dishes showcased on their wall. This Asian take on calamari was salty deliciousness. When dipped in the jalapeno-filled soy sauce, the squid went to the next level - the level of orgasm. \n\nNext came the Beef Tenderloin with Black Pepper Sauce ($15).  Since this was a recommendation from our waitress, it didn't quite meet the high expectations I had. It reminded me of an un-lemony version of one of my favorite Filipino dishes - Beefsteak Tagalog. The meat was somewhat chewy and I had to finish off a healthy mouthful since it was easier to take it in whole. The sauce was solid though and of course we ended up cleaning the plate but I wish we had a chance to try something else instead.\n\nOur last dish was the Chef's Special Chow Mein with dry noodles ($8.75).  It had pieces of squid, shrimp, and various vegetables, but the ratio to noodles and the goods were not in our favor. Still, it was a solid dish and the sauce over the crunchy noodles helped make our meal memorable. \n\nBy the time we left, it was creeping up to midnight and people were still coming in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-08-20", "description": "The reason why people think Yuet Lee serves good Chinese food is because it's 2:00 in the morning and you find yourself in North Beach, drunk and hungry, and desperate for anything greasy and oily that would help soak up all the alcohol.  So your options are limited at this hour of the day as is your judgment for what good food is, and Yuet Lee happens to be one of two Chinese restaurants opened (the other is Sun Hong Kong further down Broadway, which is even worst but at least much cheaper).  I've eaten Chinese food all my life and all over the world, and there's no other reason to eat at a place like Yuet Lee other than that.  Its prices are outrageous.  The food is mediocre at best, super greasy and oily and will likely give you the runs later.  Don't get caught up with all the celebrity photos on the wall, most of them have no idea about authentic and good Chinese food, and don't pay an average person's price when they go out to eat.  They're just playing tourist when they come here, don't get trapped!", "author": "Jackson Z."}

I think a lot of other people didn't enjoy their meal services here due to language barriers or they felt that the waiters were pushy (I mean, they are trying to get you to buy more stuff.)\n\nSo here I am trying to tell you what to get and that's that. Hopefully, it'll aid you in your ordering. :D\n\nI do order in english most of the time unlike my Dad because I don't speak cantonese, only mandarin (which they do understand...)\n\nSo anyway, order the salt and pepper crab. This is a highlight on the menu! Alright, so if you want to compare it to R&G restaurant at the edge of Chinatown, don't. This one costs about half of what R&G costs, and is still rather good. It's messy, so be prepared! \n\nNext to order if you're up for fried food would be the salt and pepper squid, I know you're gonna insist it's essentially the same, but look, you don't need to do much work here, just stick a fork in the squid and put it in your mouth!\n\nAlso, the ribs here are fabulous... Dripping in sauce or lightly grilled/fried. One of my staples is the fried rice with salted fish and chicken. Honestly not many people like salted fish, so order with discretion. Its more of an Asian thing, so try it before ordering it in such a large plate.\n\nLastly, my Dad loves and adores the beef with scrambled egg. Less oily than the rest I've recommended and extremely soothing to the soul. And sometimes if you order lots, they give you free soup too. :)\n\nOne other perk is that it's open late, so great and amazing for those late nights after clubbing/drinking or simply a late photo-shoot.

For all of you out there in yelpland who know what I'm talking about....ahhh, Yuet Lee.\n\nYuet Lee is one of the typical restaurants on yelp that get such diverse and ridiculous reviews that it doesn't get its true rating justice.  People who give bad ratings give such simple reviews and explanations that it's not really fair to the loyal readers who need \"good advice\" on where to eat!\n\nThe hard facts are 1) it's usually always packed, 2) the clientele is diverse (which politically incorrectly speaking means, local Chinatown people eat here) and 3) they have pictures of celebrities.  I understand the last one is cliche, but that's why it's cool and legit!\n\nNow, for my warranted opinion and review based on numerous dinners (being either sober, drunk or *%$&#!ed up) - this place is a solid SF institution.  Solid 4 stars.\n\nI will share what I usually order (recommended by my fat cantonese friend):\n- scrambled eggs with beef\n- clams with black bean sauce\n- salt and pepper pork\n- green vegetable thing (pea shoots? )\n- squab\n- salt and pepper calamari\n\nEach and everyone one of these dishes are delicious, tasty, filling and fast.  Who cares is if it's overpriced?  That's a relative term and it's in SF.  Who cares if the service sucks or they're rude?  They've been there longer than you've been in SF so who's wrong now???\n\nI have no idea how the other dishes are and if I'm going to get seafood crazy canton style I would rather go to R&G or the Kitchen.  But if I want good, quick and tasty Cantonese food AND I'm in North Beach, then Yuet Lee will always be top of the list.

Quintessentially Chinese in food, attitude & even \"ambience\" (lots of Chinese chattering loudly...wait, that's us)\n\nBeen coming here since I was like 5 yrs old, don't even live in San Fran but everytime we go, this is where we go if we aren't having Dim Sum \n\nSeafood is their specialty, and like everyone before, their Salt & Pepper Squid is amazing! The steamed whole fish is always perfect, never over or under cooked, and full of flavor. Lobster black bean sauce super yummy!\n\nDuring the day, you'll see someone wrapping up fresh wontons which are delish. Plump with pork & shrimp and just the right amount of spices. Wonton noodle soup is super yum.\n\nChinese style beef stew is pure authentic... I know typically non-Chinese people don't eat this but my hubby who isn't Chinese LOVES this. So I definitely think everyone should try it, ladle it over your white rice & enjoy. \n\nService is super fast-- YES there is a language barrier  so they may seem to be pushy, but if you have ever eaten with a Chinese family...we are all pushy! LOL ;P  But really, we love our food & want everyone to try everything... which whenever we see the owner, he'll offer something new for us to try. Yeah that's the guy in the pic with Jackie Chan--he's a boisterous friendly guy. \n\nThe kitchen is open for you to watch your food being prepared... Its just an experience to listen to the sizzling going on and watch the steam as it rises. You know this is freshly made & not served out of a warming tray. \n\nPrice is neither expensive or inexpensive, medium unless you're ordering things like crab & lobster (hello...those are bound to be more expensive). \n\nLove that they are open late, so that when I'm staying with my sister, I can just walk down 2 blocks and get my Beef Chow Fun fix or Won Ton fix. \n\nThe only down side is that yeah...it looks run down, could use a different paint color even though the bright green is memorable.

I so wanted to make #500 a 5-star review.\n\nBut nothing special happened.... I waited, and waited, but nope -- I still have no 5-star event to review.  That's kinda sad, huh?  \n\nYeah, it is for me, too.\n\nSo, for special #500 - I decided to review one of my all-time favorites, Yuet Lee.\n\nI first came here about 8 or 9 years ago, late at night after clubbing, and a massive group of us chowed down.  I was told it was THE place to get porridge, and I had to say - that was awesome porridge.  \n\nThen, I never came here again until last year, when I happened to walk in and realized, \"This is the same place I came to long ago!\"  PORRIDGE-TIME!\n\nTheir abalone porridge is great - as is their pork and egg porridge.  Their salt and pepper squid, which seems to be their best-known dish is good, but I don't find it amazing.  The seafood soup is very tasty, and their fried rice is pretty good.  Everything I have ordered here has always been quite good to amazingly good.\n\nI know of no other place that takes your order and has your food on the table quicker than this place.  It's like they have a psychic running the kitchen.  That said - late at night, there can be a wait to get seated, so at 2 AM, it's not necessarily a quick meal.\n\nAs far as service goes, it's hit or miss.  I've sometimes been greeted like an old friend and at other times, the servers seem irritated that more people came in.  I can't say anyone has been outright rude - but it's basically typical for a Chinese restaurant.  This crass service can sometimes irritate me, but since they consistently give me good food - I don't mind so much.\n\nWith Yuet Lee, though, I do have one complaint.  They don't make some of the more typical Chinese soups like sizzling rice soup.  Late at night, I am usually not one to want a meal (rice, meat, etc.) but rather a big, piping hot bowl of soup to myself.  Now they have seafood soup, but again, that is too much \"stuff\" (squid, shrimp, bok choy, etc.).  It's better than nothing, but it doesn't quite hit the SPOT.  I can't ding Yuet Lee for it, it's their menu and their type of cuisine, but it's just something I wish they had.  That, and hot and sour soup - and this place would be close to PERFECT.\n\nTo my knowledge, they are opened until 3 AM on the weekends.  During weekdays, they close earlier, but still a lot later than most places.  If it's 10 pm or later, Yuet Lee is one of the only places that comes to mind for food - and guaranteed, they are opened and ready to miraculously present food to your table in approximately 5.7 seconds.\n\nFor food, I go to Yuet Lee for a late night meal.\n\nBut if I'm craving my sizzling rice soup - I will just head down the block to New Sun Hong Kong restaurant and get soup.  For everything else - Yuet Lee RULES.", "author": "Grace K."}

We got the wonton noodle soup, and he got the same thing with duck and we got the preserved egg and pork porridge.  \n\nThe porridge was really thick.  I like mine thin, but it was pretty good for what it was.  I wasn't expecting anything \"gourmet\" but it definitely hit the spot for down right homey.  \n\nThe bowl of wonton noodle soup was delicious.  The wontons were nice and big filled with giant shrimp and pork.  It was the perfect amount, so not overly porky.  The wrapper is smooth and fresh, very good.   The noodles were almost like the ones you get in hong kong.  It's still kinda hard but very succulent.  The soup wasn't anything spectacular but still very good and flavorful.\n\nI tried a piece of the duck from my boyfriend's soup.  The meat was really tender, the skin had good texture that seems fit for roast duck in a bowl of noodles and the seasoning of the duck was like normal roast duck.\n\nYuet Lee deserves 5 stars because they are open late which caters to my needs/wants and the food for the price is amazing.  For all three items our bill was $23 with tip....and we left almost a $3 tip.  So If we weren't being fatties, we could have gotten away with this meal for less than $20 and then some to spare.  \n\nI will definitely make this place my  new late night spot.", "author": "Zu W."}

A day-glo green beacon on the corner of Stockton and Broadway, it's the Chinatown go-to for fast, cheap, sometimes fabulous food. \n\nMy faves: anything salt and pepper style - I especially like the crispy pork spareribs. They're perfectly spiced, sprinkled with cilantro and never fatty or greasy. Wonton soup - the wontons are small and delicate with shrimp mixed into the pork filling. The broth is clear, fresh and flavorful. Clams in black bean sauce - this dish suits a particular mood. It doesn't always jive with certain drinks that one may have imbibed before arriving at Yuet Lee, but when it's right - it's oh so right. Savory and lip-smackingly satisfying. Decent fried rice. Pretty tasty jook. \n\nUnfortunately, the overhead fluorescent lighting is absolutely horrid. Headache-inducing and especially insulting in the wee hours of face-stuffing when garish glare does no one any favors. \n\nI may have to wear sunglasses the next time I find myself chowing down here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-17", "description": "Why do I come here?\n\nConsistently good food and the SFPD.\n\nI am usually here, rushing past the denizens of Chinatown and the onslaught of a torrential downpour with my very good friend, to dry off and warm up over a fantastic meal.  We make a point of visiting this establishment when we are in the area and it has never failed to supply us with a fantastic order of porridge and other delectable treats from the sea.\n\nThe interior is typical of a Chinese restaurant that never really took the time or money to invest in itself since the 1960's.  But where the money and effort is lacking is made up in the food and human ambiance.  Don't expect customer service, this is Chinatown.  This is where you head to get your table and menu, eat the food, and then leave.  No one is paying for charm or ass-kissing.  Advise to head toward North Beach for that.  However, If you are lucky to get a table near the stove, I find it neat to peer through the small openings to watch them stir fry something interesting in their many woks lining the grill.\n\nMy friend usually settles on the fish porridge, the salt-and-pepper fried squid and then my contribution would be to request a starchy accompaniment such as the standard chow fun or the flash saute of Tung Choi greens.  At first, the porridge reminded me too much of the Okayu style rice porridge in Japan my grandmother use to make when we got sick.  In addition, I'm more of a sashimi person and am rarely inclined toward fish that has been boiled.  Hence, the aversion.  However, the porridge here is delicate enough to overpower my negative memories and the white fish influencing the broth: a savory disposition.  Positivity in a round bowl.  Hot.  Steaming.  I cupped my hands around the bowl.\n\nThe squid?  Anything fried is good.  Hence my reflections on the salt-and-pepper fried squid.  It is tender and never rubbery, encased lovingly in a very light and crunchy floured coating.  Sometimes slightly oily, but that is usually the consequences of being drowned in a vat of lard.  The Chow fun is a large hot heap of noodles:  wok tossed and brimming with vegetables, shrimp, char siu and bean sprouts.  The very standard smoky flavor is so seductive to the palate.  The Tung Choi depends on the season but the results bring me to the edge of my seat each and every time. Bright emerald greens.  Crispy and flavorful, dotted with small chunks of garlic.  We have also sampled the sweet pea greens too.  Heavenly.  The portions here are large and we usually leave with cartons to go.   Being night owls, we appreciate the fact that there is a decent spot open late at night after catching an art gallery opening downtown.\n\nThe  S F P D  bit:\n\nOur most recent visit was slightly more eventful.  After we found parking off Broadway and just finished placing my car in park, the bus in front of us suddenly stopped and several officers of the nearby SFPD went running ahead with their firearms drawn.  R and I literally ran into Yuet Lee and we were seated next to a group of, again, SFPD motorcycle officers taking up one of the larger round tables.  6 huge men in uniform, a usual severe picture except that they had just finisheda very standard Chinese meal and were apparently in high spirits.\n\nThe owner of Yuet Lee was having a conversation with one of the officers so to make small talk with the older officer sitting diagonally from me, I inquired about the mayhem up ahead on Stockton.  \n\n\"Did you see that commotion out there?  Shouldn't you be out there?\"\n\nHe smiled, leaned back in his chair,   \"Oh that.  That's not our problem.  They've got that under control.\"  He waved his hand away and then stuck them under his belt.\n\nAnother extra star for the ambiance and our funny men in uniform. \n\nI love them all.", "author": "Miika M."}

So, I entered this, as it was the only one open in the area, and looked like service would be fast. And, I was completely bowled over by the food !!!\n\nThey had a quite a lot of seafood in the menu, but I wanted something I could finish fast, and ordered for \"Crispy Fried Garlic Prawns w/ Chow Mien\". It was definitely the best chow mien I ever had, and I have been having Chow Mien since I was a kid. And the prawns, were wonderfully fried in garlic. The taste was strong, unlike a lot of Chinese restaurants in the US, and the smells were completely Yummy!! and a bottle of Tsing Tao beer along with this was perfect. The portions were quite large too, and there was no miserliness in adding prawns. The service, as I expected, was prompt and fast, nothing fancy, but definitely not rude.\n\nThe thing is, I was born and grew up in Calcutta in India, which has a large-sized Chinatown from Pre-WWII days of the British. The Chinese there are mostly Cantonese-speaking. So, I've had quite a lot of Cantonese food and especially chow mien. The complaint about SALT in the food is because European cuisine is typically much less salty, and hence, most of the Chinese food in the US is adapted to suit American preferences. So, this highly-salted Chinese food is very authentic, AFAIK, if you are talking about Cantonese food. And yes, the place is somewhat pricy, given that Chinese restaurants across the street with well-appointed interiors, almost charge the same price. If you want to get quality service and quiet atmosphere, I would suggest New Sun Hong Kong at Broadway and Columbus, which also has superb Chinese fare.

I was eating at Yuet Lee with a friend from Vermont.  It was late at night and we were really hungry so we asked about the 'whole cat fish' dish, which is usually really good steamed with black bean ginger and green onions.  I think the jaded waiter wanted to give us some shock value, so he grabbed his ratty old net and went to the fish tank and netted a mid size catfish.  As he was absentmindedly walking to our table with the catfish, somehow the catfish slipped out of the net flopped across the restaurant floor under another table where people where eating.  The waiter went nuts, yelling in Cantonese, cursing and wrestling with the fish under the table.  Once he recaptured the fish, it was direct to the chopping block.

They could have added more beef and veggies to the proportion. The flavor was just right.\n\nSpare Ribs and Peppers: Green Peppers and Spare Ribs stir fried in garlic and black bean sauce ~ yum! This dish was what I expected and did not disappoint me. The black bean and garlic sauce soaked well into the peppers and spare ribs (watch out for the little bones in the ribs). \n\nSpinach and Fish Cake Soup: This soup was perfect to rehydrate after a night of drinking fun. Simple to make and simple to eat. The spinach wasn't boiled to death and the fish cake was fork tender and not too spongy nor tough.\n\nThe prices were about $1-2 more than other restaurants of this type but where else can you get food this late?

We've had the big oysters with black bean sauce served in the shell, too. The sizzling spareribs clay pot is also very tasty. I also like the bean sprout with yellow chives chow mein. We also like the jook (rice porridge) they have here that has bits of pork or beef in it, green onions, and ginger. Yummy!\n\nThis place is OG!

My only disappointment about the food is that both were branded on the menu as \"spicy\", but neither were in the least.

I've always been impressed with the pan fry (hong kong style) BBQ chow mein. That chow mein is probably the best there is in San Francisco. \n\nHowever, I was just there for Thanksgiving 2012 and though the food was good, I was however, disappointed with the way the head waiter treated me. I noticed earlier in the evening that the head waiter was arguing with another patron at the end of their meal but wasn't sure exactly what it was about. Another table behind me faced the same fate towards the end of their meal as well. When it came time for my final bill, the head waiter came over (not the same one that I've had all night, mind you) and stood next to me, waiting for me to pay the bill. This place was near empty by the time I was finishing up dinner with my father and it was not even close to closing, nor was my father finished with his meal. I pay the bill to get the guy away from staring at us and then the head waiter returns with my change, he says to me, \"30%, you must leave a tip at 30%\". I'm not sure what thats all about, so I asked the waiter, about the percentage. I was certainly not going to stiff the wait staff, but the head waiter then began to tell me what my tip was to be at the 30% range and insisted I gave him (not the female waiter who had been doing the work all night), the tip. He again stood by and counted the tip in front of me and said I had to pay more (I left a $10 tip as it was). \n\nSorry, but I'm not paying nearly half the price of my meal towards a tip. We ordered 2 items...give me a break! \n\nAfter this experience, I won't be coming back and certainly, won't be recommending this place to friends that come to experience Chinatown.", "author": "CB S."}

With the intention of going to Tuttimelon on Broadway afterwards, we decided to stick around Stockton/Broadway so we could walk to our frozen cravings after dinner.\n\nI yelped a few places for wonton soup, since that's what both of us really wanted, and Broadway Cafe and Yuet Lee came up.  My very Chinese friend also recommended these two, and so we parked and tried to decide which one to go to.  I'd been to Broadway Cafe, and my friend had eaten at Yuet Lee before, so he wasn't feeling adventurous and made the executive decision to skip Broadway Cafe.\n\nBreakdown of the 3-star score (which is sad, considering the previous reviews are 4- or 5-stars):\n\nLocation: 5 stars.  Parking is easy at night (no meters).\nCleanliness: 4 stars.  Great for a Chinese restaurant that isn't white-washed.\nService: 4 stars.  Efficient and not super friendly, but still courteous.  I asked the guy if he liked BBQ pork wonton soup, or the beef stew won ton soup, and he said he didn't like either of them.  Kudos for honesty and not trying to sell us anything he didn't like.\nMenu: 5 stars.   I need to come back here when I'm absolutely starving.\nPrices: 4 stars.  I've seen cheaper, but I've also seen more expensive.  Portions aren't as big as I thought they were going to be.\nBok Choy: 4 stars.  Greasy, but oh-so-delicious with the garlic sauce.\nWonton Soup: 2 stars.  The wontons were okay (but nothing compares to my grandma's wontons), but the noodles were like a mass of over-bleached, over-permed hair, and the soup was so bland that not even salt and soy sauce could help it.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty good place but NOT for wontons.  I'd seriously just come back here for bok choy.  Oh, and if you speak Chinese, you should ask the waiter if they like beef stew or bbq pork wonton soup.", "author": "Tori S."}

Its not exactly cheap, but the portions are very good (I only had the chicken chow mein, but it was plenty for my appetite at the time). The seafood looked good especially the oyster as many people seemed to be ordering them.\n\nUpdate: Had the Young Chow Friend Rice (shrimp & bbq pork). The pork was so good that I should have just gotten the pork friend rice without the shrimp. Also order the Noodles with Seafood which I really can't recommend. The noodles were decent but the shrimp and scallops just didn't have much flavor. The other items, mainly squid and slimy mushrooms, just seemed to be thrown in at the last minute.\n\nUpdate: Made a BIG mistake and ordered the BBQ Spare Ribs in Black Bean sauce. I expected the same small spare ribs I found at most chinese restaraunts growing up. These however, were small pieces of actual rib with an even smaller amount of meat surrounding. I couldn't even bring myself to finish them and stuck with the always safe BBQ Pork Chow Mein instead.\n\nUpdate: The BBQ Pork Fried rice is consistently good, as well as the Pepper and Salt Squid.", "author": "Nicolas H."}

The wonton was not good, just meat.  The soup was not good, salty.

Everything written about the d\u00e9cor and service is spot on but being from New York, we've seen much worst. After all, we were here for the food and not necessarily the ambiance. It was 8:30 pm and the place was busy but we were seated right away. Two menus were flung at us and within seconds a lady was asking us what we wanted to order. As typical in many Chinese restaurants, the menus tend to be quite extensive and this place was no exception. We asked the waitress for some suggestions and she pointed to a few of the specials. (Hint: There is a Top Ten list of most popular dishes located right above the second table to the right as you enter.) I ordered the Crab Saut\u00e9ed with Ginger and Green Onions which at $28 was a little steep and my gf the Peking Spare Ribs (Sweet and Sour) for $8.25. We ordered a bowl of rice, which we were told would be extra and two Tsing Tao. \n\nWithin minutes, the spare ribs arrived. Actually, they were more like pork chops. The portion was pretty large and well prepared although my gf thought they were a little too sweet. The crab would take a little longer since they had just fished it out of the tank. When the crab arrived, we were shocked at the size of it. This thing was massive! The gf worked on the legs and claws while I dug into the meat inside the shell. Good eats! We had two more Tsing Tao and before we knew it, a check was slapped on our table. Total came to $65.75 which for Chinese food is on the high end but I did order a pretty expensive dish. Next time, I'll probably stick with the more common dishes. Overall, it was a pretty decent meal. Definitely worth trying but only if you're in the area.", "author": "Jorge S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-10-23", "description": "I had been having fierce cravings for some salt and pepper shrimp or squid when the manfriend actually volunteered to go have wontons with me. In my mind I knew that head-on shrimp were not going to go over well with him but the craving wants what the craving wants. That being said, Yuet Lee will reside on a special list of meals that we've endured throughout the years. There was the beef noodle soup out in the Sunset that was dominated by plentiful chunks of all manner of offal, the other beef noodle soup that had what I found to be wonderfully gelatinous (two words that do not go together in a whitie world) beef tendons, the various strands of jellyfish and delightfully cartilaginous chicken feet, tripitas tacos, fish heads, etc. These special meals all have the common factor of some tasty little morsel that I relish; unfortunately these are the same bits that the manfriend finds completely inedible and an utter mystery as to why anyone would think of eating them.\n\nWe sensed the impending dining tragedy as we sat down and went over the menu. The subject of chicken chow mein was broached and my hackles were raised. One might as well be ordering sweet and sour pork, fried rice, and some fried wontons. EEK! In the end, he settled on kung pao shrimp (not the most authentic dish, but I thought it would be better than a meal of chow mein), I went for salt and pepper prawns, and we split some wonton noodle soup. The wontons themselves were very flavorful (hello msg) but the broth was bland. Luckily the small saucer of fresh jalapenos and soy sauce added some flavor to the broth. Kung pao shrimp were coated in a gloppy reddish brown sauce that tasted like sweet and sour take out from the steam table. I was shocked when we got the bill and saw that this horrifying rendition weighed in at $11.50. That is when the manfriend pointed out that while the chicken chow mein may not have been a specialty of Yuet Lee, it would have been a much cheaper mistake. Point taken. \n\nThe salt and pepper shrimp ($15) were well fried but were not the best version that I've had. I prefer a lot more in the heat department and more chili slices as a garnish. However, they were a tasty albeit expensive lunch for me. The concept of eating shrimp peels, heads, eyes, etc and the fact that these guys still had their vein intact did not sit well with my dining companion. As I was trying to convince him to stick with seafood, he pointed out that most of the crabs, lobsters, and a few of the fish in the tanks weren't looking so good. Koi Palace this was not. \n\nI begrudgingly said that we could get him a slice of pizza or a sandwich later and we both added it to our special bitter meals (aka excursions into Chinese cuisine) list. I foresee a solo meal of salt and pepper squid in my future.", "author": "Candice L."}

How about MSG?\n\nThe menu touts the food as \"flavorful without being greasy.\"  I got the seafood lo mein and I could not BELIEVE how greasy it was!!!  Terrible.  With tip and all, it was $14.  The dish came to 10.25, actually, and with tax, 11.20.  But WOW, it was VERY greasy.  Also, I got a headache afterwards that suggests to me there was MSG in the food.  It was very salty and had this addictive sort of overtone-taste that might be my imagination but I THINK I can recognize it as MSG.  Anyway, the food is EXTREMELY GREASY!\n\nWhat I love about the place is that they don't play music, and it's not crowded or loud.  Also, it's weird in there, surreal, I mean.

On to the food...\nThe famed salt and pepper squid were really tasty, the squid tasted fresh, it wasn't greasy and had really nice flavor to it, I'd happily eat another plate of these. The seafood soup was really delicious, the broth was nice, light, clean and clear and it was chock a block full of seafood, oysters, mussels, fresh chunks of white fish and squid. The real star of the night for me was the clay pot, it was delicious, the oysters were succulent and flavorful and their was some kind of really firm fleshed fish in there as well, and I love when clay pots have some green onion in them. The sauce was delicious, really, really savory with good meaty flavor to it. I will definitely order it again. This place is open until three in the morning which is good to know for those late night cravings. I definitely plan on going back and trying their salt and pepper crab.", "author": "Cathy T."}

We are definitely coming back for more. We arrived at 11:30am on a Saturday to have lunch before stocking up on food at the markets on Stockton St.  We ordered three dishes, Pepper and Salt Roast Fresh Squids, Deep Fried Oysters and Abalone with Chicken Noodle Soup. The recommendations on the Pepper and Salt Squid are ON THE MARK, the dish is amazing, fresh, delicious, and a big portion. We loved the deep fried oysters too, also huge super fresh. The soup was healthy and soothing, and the noodles were perfect. We threw in some spicy sauce to give it a little kick. We couldn't finish everything so we took our leftover squid and soup to go. The meal was $40 - including two beers and a soda. So really all that amazing seafood and huge bowl of soup for $30 and we had leftovers. \n\nIn terms of decor, who cares if it's bland and not pretty to look at (the bathroom was super clean by the way). We also had great service,  so overall the experience for us was great. The food was amazing and we enjoyed hearing it all cooking away while we watched the passersby from our table next to the window. It was the right way to start a Saturday before hitting the crowded markets on Stockton.", "author": "D G."}

There were 3 - count em - 3 limp pieces of Bok Choy and a rumour of carrot peelings, perhaps 5 mushrooms, a couple of pieces of greasy tofu and maybe 10 peas in the chow mein. That's it. Utterly pathetic. To make it worse we had asked if it were possible to have the chicken chow mein with extra vegetables and the grumpy a-hole waiter simply said \"no we don't do that\" and walked away. I mean how tough is that? What a prick. The pork was considerably more generous - 5 pieces of porkette ribs that were maybe 2 inches each on rice with HEY BONUS 4 pieces of bok choy and some gravy.

The asparagus was properly priced at $8.50, but consisted of very large pieces (well overgrown) with lots of browning.  They had absolutely no flavor, save for the strangely gelatinous garlic (buttery?) sauce.  A real let down during asparagus season.

A friend had the fried rice and it was greasy and mediocre.  Nothing terribly tasty.  Just big portions for a good price. We had gelato afterwards and this place was so greasy, the ice cream felt light.", "author": "Raz R."}

It's bare minimum. No fancy crap but the food, the food kicks ass. Probably some of the best Chinese I have ever had. The Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce is great and any of the noodle dishes. Oh and the salt and pepper squid is really good. Worth checking out at least once if you have never been in my opinion.", "author": "KATELYNN R."}

You would never know the food is as great as it is.  We had the salt and pepper calamari, clams in a black bean sauce and a plate of roasted duck. My favs were the clams and calamari.  Prices are reasonable ($12 per dish) for the portion size.  Its a small place and the food comes out quick.", "author": "Shanna B."}

If you had a bad experience, you no doubt ordered the wrong thing. The salt and pepper squid (ordered \"dry\") is unbelievable; the beef with ginger and green onions also amazing, and the Hong Kong style noodles is the best ever. Dont order the won ton soup. Dont order anything Szechuan; it is a Cantonese restaurant, folks! I grew up in Asia and eat Chinese all over the world, but Yuet Lee ranks as one of my favourite food experiences of all time.", "author": "Anne B."}

I was startled to find when we arrived that my sweet and sour prawns, which were not listed on the menu, were an incredible $15.50. When I got home and opened the box, I found that they'd only filled it halfway. Additionally, the food was terrible; the sauce had no taste. Even the steamed rice was somehow substandard.", "author": "Chris T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-25", "description": "Okay, yeah, this place is a bit pricey for a casual Chinese restaurant but the food is very good.  In fact, it is currently my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.  My usual order is either Hong Kong-style Seafood Pan-Fried Noodles or Chicken and Salt Fish Fried Rice.  Though I don't do it often, this is the ONLY place I order sweet and sour pork .  My order is taken and the food is served piping hot within a reasonable time.  I and/or my party eats, we get our check, pay within a reasonable time and exit.  No fuss.  The wait staff is pleasant considering the amount of drunken patrons that go in after 10pm.  Your mileage may vary but mine has been damn good so far.", "author": "James D."}

Having been to Hong Kong, I can say this was as authentic a Chinese restaurant as you will find in the US. We had dungeness crab which was pulled live out of the tank in front us and cooked right away.  We also had a big mound of spinach.  Service was quick and efficient.  It's not as friendly as you'll find in your own neighborhood, but they were very helpful, taking plates away as we finished, bringing us finger bowls to clean our hands.  We had dinner early on a Sunday and the place was packed, with a line as we left.  Most of the diners looked like locals.  Live fish is expensive there, so bring your credit card. They even served a live fish which was still wiggling in the net when it was show to a couple sitting across the aisle.  Decor is typical Chinatown, but you come here for the food and quick service, not ambiance.", "author": "John S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-25", "description": "This place is listed on the tour guides and draws a lot of tourists- way more than local Chinese or locals in general. They are known for their salt and pepper squid that can not be beat they are so addicting. (I also like the squid from Cha Cha Cha's, but they are different.) I like that they don't use msg on most of their food- you can also request it to make sure they don't add it, if possible. But, there is soooo much more. When I want home cooking, I come here. I love their broth - it's seasonal and often contain Chinese herbs - when I visit, I must have it as I consider it my medicine for the week. Another fantastic dish is their steamed oysters on the half shell - very impressive as well. Those oysters are local and are so big, they look like they're on steroids. They are yummy and oh so Cantonese. Some drawbacks - the horrible green color (just don't stare at it), it can be cold and there could be a wait for seats. But, it's not enough to keep me away from the food. They are closed on Tuesdays, so beware.", "author": "kim y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-04", "description": "Yuet Lee is located on the North side of Broadway on the edge of Chinatown and North Beach.  It's a very good destination if you enjoy seafood.  While there are other good Chinese places in the neighborhood, it's the seafood that sets Yuet Lee apart.  Also the place is also open late which is another plus.  If you go with the crab, the mussels, and the other sea foods you won't go wrong.  Not that you'd go wrong with anything else on the menu. If you're just a chow mein, lo mein,  or fried rice kinda Chinese restaurant aficionado then perhaps this place is not for you as you can get cheaper dishes elsewhere.  In season, the sea bass is incredible.  The duck, in particular, is also mouth watering as well as is the salt and pepper shrimp.  Others have said that this dish is salty, HELLO..it's salt and pepper shrimp.  They do serve other delicacies such as frogs legs and that dish is very good. They aways serve a little  bowl of chiles in sause that adds a tasty touch.  The place isn't fancy by any means but I've been upstairs and in the dining room downstairs many times and I have yet to see anything that won't make me come back.  Parking in the neighborhood during certain hours can be challenging.  I suggest parking above the Central Police Station and walk the block and a half.  Yuet Lee is a very good restaurant if you get the urge for a fish dish late at night and I highly recommend it.", "author": "Nick C."}
