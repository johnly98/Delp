We arrived on a Thursday at 6pm before the rush, so was easily seated. The restaurant is nice and cozy, so you can expect a line at normal hours although they work efficiently to get everyone in and out.\n\nBetween the two of us, we shared the Garlic Edamame ($5), Roti Bread with Curry Dipping ($5), Zen Noodle Soup ($15), Laksa ($14), and Ginger Ice Cream ($4). I can't even decide what to talk about first because everything was delicious! The edamame are piping hot and drenched in a spicy garlic dressing --a must order! As for the roti, it was standard but loved the curry dipping sauce to go with it for a nice starter. Between the two main soups, they were special in their own ways with the zen noodle more of a lighter Tom Yum seafood flavor while the Laksa is similar to a thicker curry noodle soup. Even though we were stuffed, we decided to try the ginger ice cream which was amazing! I was so pleasantly surprised with the flavor, which was not too strong and mixed in with some candied ginger bites. It was the perfect ending to the meal.\n\nThis place has easily become a new favorite from their delicious food, great price point, and wonderful service. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!", "author": "Cindy Z."}

I'm usually weary of any Asian Fusion places that serve pho AND ramen, but I was pleasantly surprised by this place.

Large pieces of delicious calamari. Would definitely recommend\n- Green Curry: Solid curry. Perfect spicy level and comes with rice\n- Takoyaki: Excellent. Would get again \n- Laksa: Good, but you have to be in the right mood for the super thick curry soup. Would order again on a cold day \n\nCan't wait to go back!

Come here if you don't want to deal with too many asian food options and want to just go with the classics (choices: 1pho, 2ramen, 1laksa, 1fried rice, and a few other appetizers and whatnot). Also a safe space for those who eat ramen with forks *giggle* The people here are nice and relatively attentive. \n\nWe arrived at 9pm on a Friday and waited ~20+minutes. A ton of tables cleared up but no one came to seat us as there seemed to be a hold up for take-out/delivery so a huge batch of people got seated all at once. \n\nAnyway.. if I'm paying $14 for curry and noodles with a few toppings, I expect the toppings to be somewhat fresh and bountiful. NOPE. Chicken's dryness could not be masked by the heavy curry and there was maybe less than half a palm-size of shredded chicken. Cilantro was not fresh either. Also not a lot of tofu or shrimp(though shrimp was cooked fine). Basically there were way too few toppings and a whole ton of curry (not spicy btw). Places like Marufuku in Japantown are able to deliver fresh and plentiful toppings for the same price. \n\nMongolian chicken dish was $15 for what I'd consider college-student level stir fry. Chicken was also dry. The \"sesame bread\" side was an average, bland, white-bread sprinkled with some sesame seeds. I was hoping for the classic sesame bread with scallions inside but nah. It was dense enough for soaking up the sauce from the dish so I'm not mad. The flavors were there but rip because I know I can get 4x this amount for 1/2 the price at a real mongolian bbq (and with maybe not so dry chicken) \n\nAnother thing to note is how every single food item came out way too hot to eat. I hadn't experienced that in a while. The takoyakis (bite-sized, smaller than average) shouldn't be that hot especially if I'll eat it in one go!! They were delicious though. \n\nAll in all, it is what it is. I didn't come here expecting legit asian food and I'm not deeply disappointed but there really was nothing extraordinary enough for me to be paying the price I paid. Probably won't be back anytime soon.", "author": "Lydia Z."}

I got the chicken pho and it was so yummy, and my boyfriend was very pleased with his tonkatsu ramen. We had such a pleasing meal served by such kind servers on a Saturday night before we went out for drinks. \n\nI highly highly recommend this place.

Heard this place was the go-to asian fusion restaurants in the area, but was sad that the ramen was not satisfying. The broth was salty to the point that I could not finish it... I understand that Shoyu and Miso by default have a lot of salt in it, but the tonkatsu flavor did not balance the saltiness. Plus, there were not enough veggies in the bowl either. The ramen must appeal to many people since it tastes very similar to other places in the Mission - I prefer a more bland based broth honestly.\n\nGlad this restaurant had small bites though. The shu-mai were tasty - was happy to see the meat took up more than 1/2 of the shu-mai (i.e. pretty big pieces of meat). We should have ordered more appetizers, but settled on dessert.

Hanger steak bbq was very interesting- steak was medium-rare cooked and the SAUCE, I believe, is a cilantro based.

The Spice Jar appears like a hipster, almost more Westernized restaurant but don't let that fool you. I've passed by it all the time on my way back to work and after finally trying it, the flavor of the dishes definitely took me by surprise. \n\nThe menu has a section for small bites, salad, soup/noodles/rice, and \"hungry.\" Prices are pretty reasonable for the most part and entrees will run you about $11-14 except for some heavier protein outliers like the Mongolian Lamb ($19), Seven Spiced Salmon ($16), and Hangar Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps ($18). The choices vary by certain Asian cuisines, such as Thai or Vietnamese. Some also appear to be more Asian fusion as well.\n\nThe space is pretty limited and has a communal table. When I went it appeared like it was a good setup for dates. We sat at bar seating near the open kitchen area. \n\nThe staff is pretty nice and friendly. Even though the restaurant was quite busy, the waiter was really kind about coming to refill water and check up on us. The service definitely left a good impression on me.\n\nBased on the previous reviews, it seems like some of the dishes are a hit or miss, but luckily I had a pretty good experience.\n\nSeven Spiced Salmon - Portions were smaller than expected for the steep price of $17. I wish there was more to this dish, maybe more rice or a side of veggies. The fish did feel a bit overcooked, but it didn't bother me too much. With that said, I enjoyed the flavor and quality of the salmon.\n\nLaksa - Tried a bit of this and loved the flavor as well. The soup is veeeery heavy and hard to finish as it has more of a thick, curry consistency. It would have been better if the \"soup\" was watered down but this also wasn't a huge issue. We ended up not being able to finish and took it home to put on top of rice!  \n\nI'm curious to try other dishes, and given the the reasonable prices and proximity I will be back!", "author": "Chelsea W."}

Spice Jar is tucked away in a residential neighborhood b.w. the Mission & Potrero Hill but near the hustle and bustle of 24th Street. Making it a cute little destination to stop by while exploring the area or perhaps before grabbing ice cream at Humphry Slocombe or Dynamo Donuts.\n\nSpice Jar is quite the small restaurant with capacity for around 15-17 tables including indoor and outdoor seating. The indoors is quite lovely with interesting light arrangements above their wooden tree-emulating tables. The orangey yellow dim but not too dim lighting make it a romantic spot but also a nice place to come to with family or friends! I feel right at cozy home when I walk in. \n\nIt can get quite busy here even on a random weekday night so I would call ahead to see. The waiters and waitresses are super nice, just a little busy sometimes. They give a family like vibe *but I am unsure of their relations haha*\n\nAs for food, it is quite phenomenal here! I love love it. True to their name, Spice Jar dishes are packed with flavors and I lay there floored by their food . A few... maybe a lot... that I have tried are as follows:\n\nEdamame (~$6) - covered in garlic and spice, I'm IN LOVE. I would not skip out on this especially as the portion size is a bit ridiculously large. Our table of 3 had leftovers.. a rare occurrence with edamame haha.\n\nFries ($6) - delicious thin fries covered in herbs with a clean feeling. Def have had better but also these hit the spot and as a potato addict I wouldn't skip out on these either\n\nSpice Jar Fried Rice ($14) - so I for one never get fried rice at restaurants cus PFT I can make that at home. But honestly it is so good here! With shrimp and chicken woven throughout the veggie packed fried rice, the flavor can't be beat. And interestingly enough, it's not salty. I think it attests to how they create great dishes with their unique spices!\n\nLaksa ($14) - MMMMMMMM. Is all I can say. Haha I love their laksa here. Flavor punch throughout. Thinnish just right noodles. All with some delicious dry tofu and chicken. Which I'm a fan of. If you like meaty dishes tho, maybe get something else because I found myself digging for some chicken that was on the dryish side.\n\nTonkatsu Ramen ($14) - the most meh dish of them all. Packed with flavor but the noodles are just like my shin ramen noodles and they get very puffy pretty quickly. Comes with a good chunk of Pork Belly but the meat in this is pretty good not great!

Now that I've tried it a few times, I think there are definitely pluses and minuses to the dining experience.  This restaurant offers a pan-Asian menu in a crisp and clean setting. \n\nDuring my first visit, I decided to sample their appetizers/sides.  While the shu-mai were overflowing with pork filling, the aonori garlic fries tasted under-seasoned and lacked a strong garlic flavor.  I decided to try a salad during a subsequent visit, and though the crispy calamari salad looked very appetizing, I felt underwhelmed by the mixture of flavors.  I thought the calamari was fried well but could have used some salt; the dressing gave it some kick, but given that one of the billed ingredients was red curry honey, I was expecting more spicy heat.  \n\nI thought the service was fine, though it took a while to get my waiter's attention due to the busy lunch crowd.  Given the variety of menu items, I'll probably give it another try to see if I find something truly spectacular.", "author": "Keith H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-22", "description": "Hmmm I hate to be negative, but sometimes it feels like the food scene has been downgrading to mason jars and moderately photogenic but overpriced, mediocre food. I was quite excited to try the Spice Jar given the glowing reviews and proximity to SFGH. \n\nA lot of fusion nowadays seems to be very hit-or-miss: either they have found the perfect balance and creatively synergized diverse cuisines, or it dilutes the wholesomeness of the original dish in a lackluster (though usually good-looking) concoction. \n\nThe Spice Jar features a menu of selected classics from Asian cuisine. If you are indecisive and crave anything within the range of ramen, pho, laksa, Mongolian beef, dim sum, poke, and fries, Spice Jar has it all. \n\nI tried the TONKOTSU-SHOYU RAMEN with braised spare rib, spinach, bean sprouts, soft boiled egg, and green onion. It turned out quite underwhelming from both a hard-core ramen enthusiast and an open-minded fusion enthusiast perspective. The tonkotsu broth was quite salty and lacked pork flavor, and its combination with shoyu made it even more diluted and rendered an indecisive, halfway-there profile. The braised spare rib had a nice fall-off-the-bone texture but not quite enough flavor. Perhaps the most anti-climactic was the hard-boiled egg. I guess my favorite part was the ample spinach. \n\nAmbiance is cozy and hip, with nice wooden tables in a cheerful, sunlit space. Something about the acoustics is off though; I was sitting across the table from friends and it was so noisy, we could hardly have a conversation. \n\nSpice Jar has a good concept as a homey, modern restaurant serving pan-Asian and fusion specialties, but the food isn't really quite there in my opinion. It may cater to those with different tastes than myself, and service was quite friendly. Unfortunately this was a lunch from which I left mildly dissatisfied and with $14 less... but with a pretty picture of ramen.", "author": "Edna C."}

(vs the overbearing noise associated with popular restaurants)\n\nThere is a definitive California flair to the Asian fusion interpretation here. Japanese, Chinese, and Thai influence set the foundation for the menu items. However, instead of the greasy spoon alternatives and bastardization that often make FOB Asians cringe,  the chef has combined different elements to reinterpret and make it downright comfort food for many. \n\nI would probably stick with the noodle dishes (tonkotsu and spicy miso pork ramen) and salad dishes. To make them Pho Ga (or other noodle dishes more healthy, ask for half portion noodle and add in spinach, +$2). Call them becca's pho ga, or becca's spicy miso pork ramen.

I've found that The Spice Jar is fairly hit or miss depending on what I order. That being said, the dishes that I DO like are absolute hits. Nothing hits the spot like Spice Jar's Pho Ga (chicken pho) on a rainy day! \n\nTip #1: I love the Pho Ga (chicken pho) and the chicken salad. The Pho Ga isn't your typical pho. It's not very greasy or salty, so it might not be the traditional hangover cure, but it's great for a refreshing, warm meal on a cold day. The chicken salad is huge -- it comes with a ton of chicken, lots of crunchy vegetables and toppings for texture, and a delicious miso sauce. \n\nTip #2: Small place. There's limited seating, and mostly 2 person tables. There's a large communal table in the middle so you might be elbow-to-elbow with a stranger.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-02", "description": "Some people say, \"variety is the spice of life\". To me, that just means quantity over quality--like buffets. They usually suck and give you bubble guts.\n\nThen, you have Pan Asian restaurants that serve popular dishes from various Asian countries. Usually, I'm not a fan of Pan Asian or Asian Fusion cuisine because they rarely come close to the dishes I had growing up, the flavors are watered down, and/or the fusion of flavor profiles are just a hot mess. \n\nAfter seeing some raving reviews for The Spice Jar and that they had outdoor seating so we can bring Tater Tot, we decided to give it a shot. The Spice Jar is a newish restaurant (opened in late June 2015) that took over Local's Corner which was ok but grossly overpriced. The Spice Jar's menu is Pan Asian with several Asian Fusion dishes. There's items ranging from Chinese Dim Sum items to Vietnamese Pho to Japanese Ramen to Malaysian Laksa. The prices were reasonable for the very generous portions: small bites ($5-$12), salads ($8-$12), soups, noodles & rice ($9-$14), and large plates ($11-$19). No desserts. No msg is used. Shochu, sake, wine, and beer only. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n*Braised Sparerib Bao w/ lettuce, pickled cucumber, hoisin sauce ($5): http://bit.ly/1NaltR6\n*Crispy Calamari Salad w/ mixed greens, vermicelli, red onion, cilantro, red curry honey ($12): http://bit.ly/1LUlGaS\n*Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps w/ Korean spices, saut\u00e9ed veggies ($18): http://bit.ly/1NNmzCD\n*Mongolian Lamb w/ onions, scallions, sesame bread (not shown) ($19): http://bit.ly/1KI2tb0\n\nBased on the dishes we sampled, The Spice Jar is just not my cup of tea. Seems to be better suited for yipsters and techie transplants so they choose a great location. We were the only Asians there aside from the staff. \n\nThe Sparerib Bao had a huge hunk of meat but in order to eat it with the bao, you had to cut the meat off of the bone first so it became messy. The bao was light and fluffy but the meat was tepid and a bit tough. It tasted like a boiled rib from the am that was drizzled with hoisin sauce. \n\nThe Crispy Calamari Salad was gigantic and good enough for 4 people. The calamari was overfried so the batter was hard. The greens were overdressed with the pungent, sour dressing (pool of dressing at the bottom of the bowl). The dressing didn't taste like curry or honey but a lime-fish sauce dressing used in Cambodian and Laotian salads. \n\nThe Hanger Steak BBQ Mushu Wraps (Asian fajitas) looked delicious as they sizzled on the cast iron platter. The hanger steak was cooked medium rare as requested but it was very chewy. The marinade had a savory sweetness similar to hoisin sauce, not Korean spices. I liked the accompanying cilantro (?) aioli but not with the steak as the flavors didn't mesh well. This would have been better on the calamari salad. This was also another messy dish because you had to slice the steak into smaller pieces before placing them in the wrappers to eat. I recommend that they place the mushu wrappers in a tortilla warmer because they dried out quickly. \n\nThe Mongolian Lamb was the most traditional tasting of the dishes we tried but the only dish that I felt was overpriced by $2-$3. The lamb was super tender and flavorful. It's served with sesame bread to make a sammie but I recommend substituting with rice so it's easier to eat.\n\nService was very welcoming and gracious. There's no doubt the Japanese owners are super sweet so if I was rating service alone, it would be 5 stars. They were also very nice to Tater Tot who would wake up from his nap every time a dish arrived thinking it was for him. Poor guy. Food service is on the slower end so do come here when you're not in a rush. \n\nThe Spice Jar is a small restaurant best for parties 2-4 people. The homey, rustic space hasn't changed much from Local's Corner aside from the painted walls, and addition of spice jars lining the walls. \n\nParking in the area is much easier than the central mission area.\n\nThe Spice Jar may not be my cup of tea but I wish the owners well. I hope they don't suffer the same fate as Local's Corner.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The waiter must have come by three or four times to top off my water. Plates and utensils were changed between meals, even though they were fairly clean. We were asked multiple times if everything was going well. Really, I haven't been to a restaurant with such great service in a long time.\n\nThat being said, the food was really, really mediocre, leaning on bad. The garlic noodles weren't chewy enough (maybe overcooked?), were too vinegary, and didn't really taste of much garlic. The Laksa was okay, but the noodles were slightly soggy. The mushroom tempura came out cold, so I know they don't fry it when you order it. Also, there was no hint of the promised truffle salt. The gyoza was deep-fried, like they do at milk tea shops. The salmon was overcooked (not medium-rare), but otherwise seared well. The green yogurt(?) sauce it came with was unsavory, but there was furikake somewhere in the dish that was a pleasant surprise. \n\nOverall, this is a restaurant I would actively avoid. I honestly feel terrible about giving them two stars because the restaurant is fairly new and service was so wonderful, but I honestly feel cheated at the price we paid for the food we received ($35/head). There wasn't a single dish I really loved, but many dishes I wish I hadn't ordered. At the end of dinner, neither of us wanted the leftovers.\n\nI was dining with a pescetarian friend of mine, so we weren't able to order any of the recommended dishes.

It's a bit cramped in here so not the best place for a big group. Can look like it's filling up quickly but the turnaround seems fast. Also a lot of take-out orders too so the kitchen is a bit slow.. a good 6 workers or so for this restaurant which can only fit probably like 25-30 people.... but the wait for your food will be worth it, I promise.\n\nThe workers are all extremely friendly but service may be a bit absent as they ARE busy - responsive when called though.\n\nMe and my friend tried quite a few items between the two of us and the only dish I would NOT recommend is the calamari salad.\n\nSpare rib bao - as many have stated, it comes as just one meaty rib still on the bone. I was scared it was going to be a bit messy but it was literally fall off the bone tender. Definitely one of the most tender ribs I've had. It was flavored thoroughly! The pickled cucumbers were thickly and roughly chopped, I wish it was cut more thinly, slightly more acidic, and less sweet. Still a very good appetizer - I just wish it came with 2 ribs :(\n\nChicken kara age (not on the online menu) - YASSSSSSS. Crispy (and stayed crispy) and perfectly seasoned. Lightly battered and came with 8-10 decent sized pieces. Would be perfect with beer.\n\nCrispy calamari salad - judging from how crispy and delicious the chicken was, I thought it would be the same for the calamari.. The calamari was soggy and didn't taste seasoned :/ The calamari ratio was about 3:1 with the greens, which would normally be a good thing, but it just wasn't GOOD. The red curry honey dressing was pretty nonexistent - kind of like a really watery honey with some spice - I don't think it complimented the salad.\n\nZen noodle soup - I don't usually like noodle soups with seafood because I don't like sea-foody tasting broths - but this was delicious! Very light tasting broth, delicate coconut flavor and just very, very slightly sour and hot. So good! I could eat a million bowls of these. Came with a good portion of shrimp, mussels and calamari.

I wouldn't exactly call it fusion because they somehow bring in distinct flavors from each culture in an authentic way. My boyfriend and I came in on a Tuesday, and ended up waiting almost half an hour for a table, which goes to show just how popular it is. We started with the chicken lettuce wraps, a simple dish but full of flavor. I loved the addition of the mushroom with the minced chicken, helping to cut the natural saltiness of the dish. We also tried the har gao, which was definitely on the doughier side but great in terms of portion size. \n\nFor entrees, we had the tonkatsu ramen and the Spice Jar fried rice. The flavor of the ramen broth was amazing as it tasted like the pork had been stewing for hours. The fried rice was generous in shrimp and chicken portions, but definitely a little too salty for me. Overall, it tasted as close to home-cooked as you can get from a restaurant in the city!", "author": "Ashley T."}

When I first stumbled upon this place about two months ago via Yelp I couldn't be more excited to check out an Asian cuisine in the Mission. \n\nFirst time I came for dinner. Ordered: \nshu Mai, spare rib bao and homemade tofu. Previous review I read saying the tofu was a must order. It was just okay to me. The wasabi salt was a nice touch though. Really enjoyed the \"fall of the bone\" spare rib bao and the shu Mai. Don't forget to try the Buddha beer! \n\nAnother visit for lunch ordered the Zen noodle soup (order was split with a friend) and the har gow. The spices in the soup were on point! The serving was just right for a lunch portion not leaving us overly stuffed. And don't pass up the ginger mint lemonade. Im weary about anything ginger. That too much gingery taste but it was the perfect blend. So good! \n\nDon't expect your authentic Asian cuisine here. It's Asian fusion and my kind of Asian Comfort food especially because of all the spices and flavors.  (I am Asian, well Filipino.  Authentic Chinese is my least craved food. I'd rather have Panda Express lol)   Look forward to returning and trying more dishes.", "author": "Erica M."}

The interior design is very cosy, country home; while adorable, it almost reinforced my expectation of an underwhelming experience, due to cognitive dissonance. That being said, The Spice Jar pleasantly surprised me. I sampled an assortment of dishes and enjoyed all of them.\n\nI started with the Crispy Calamari Salad--a generous portion of fresh greens, topped with delicious, lightly breaded calamari and red honey curry dressing. The little critters were crisped perfectly and didn't overpower or wilt the salad leaves.\n\nI ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen next, and also loved it. I'm used to eating delicious ramen at food trucks, but this was truly a treat. The rib was fall-off-the-bone tender, and the broth was flavorful and substantial without being too salty. The noodles were cooked just right, with a bit of bite to them. The hard boiled egg was done just right too. \n\nThe couple who owns the restaurant are truly charming and wonderful. I've eaten here a few different times, and in recognizing me, they brought some Aonori Garlic Fries on the house. Yum! I was happy to see, upon my more recent visit, that they'd hired some wait staff. I can't imagine how insane opening weeks must have been with just the two of them doing all of the work--from cooking, to waiting on tables, busing, etc. \n\nThe interior design is worth mentioning again, because it is so unexpectedly adorable. The bottom of tables are adorned with material that feels like mattress topper--it prevents you from bruising yourself while shifting your legs. I almost want all the restaurants I go to to adopt this methodology. I'm so clumsy, it definitely saved me on multiple occasions.\n\nDefinitely eat here.", "author": "Nicole C."}

We were lucky that our wait wasn't too long, 15-20 minutes top.  But, they were definitely busy for a first day.\n\nAfter some pick and choose, we got the followings:\n\nHar Gow - The skin texture was wrong.  It tasted like mochi or Korean rice cakes.\n\nBraised Spare Ribs Bao - The meat was a little dry and the bao itself was not great.\n\nHomemade Tofu - This was not the silky kind we thought it would be.  The texture was more dense and firm.  This could be more of a personal preference thing.  The wasabi salt that came with it was a good idea, but you can't really taste the wasabi part though.\n\nGarlic Green Beans - The beans were a little mushy.\n\nTonkotsu-Shoyu Ramen - Mr. J and I thought the ramen was not bad.  But, we both think a good ramen still need some good chashu to go with it.\n\nLaksa - I am always searching for a good laksa.  This is probably not your most authentic laksa, but it is so far my favorite in the Bay Area.  The soup was not as thick and heavy as most of them out there and it got a little kick to it.  I pretty much down the whole bowl.\n\nCoffee Panna Cotta/Jello - We were lucky to try this not on the menu yet dessert.  It was delicious!  A little less in portion size and add some fresh seasonal fruits on top would make it even better.\n\nI'd come back just for the Laksa!  And, maybe try some more items on the menu.

We ordered a bunch of dishes to try and everything was solid.\n\nWe started out with the Albacore Carpaccio, definitely a MUST-TRY for raw fish lovers. The fish was fresh and lightly covered in a house-made sauce with fried onions and small jalapenos on top. Each bite was amazing. Then we moved onto the Calamari Salad which lacked dressing but fear not...just ask them for dressing on the side, they're quite accommodating! I thought the fried calamari was cooked well and added a great crunchy texture to the salad. \n\nWe also got their Braised Spare Ribs Bao which is not the best bao I've ever had but it was pretty good nonetheless. Note that you'll have to slide the meat off the bones yourself before eating it in the bao but it does come right off pretty easily. It's said that they slow cook it for 5 hours.

The design/style caught my eye, especially the beautiful art/lighting piece in the center of the room. \n\nThe menu has so many things that all sounded appealing. We went for a few things and split them. Portions are BIG! \n\nThe Garlic Edamame was delicious but would only order if you want to share them between 3/4 people because it's a lot of edamame. \n\nThe Tonkatsu Ramen tasted really fresh. Love the rib that comes in it. The meat practically falls off the bone and adds to the broth.\n\nThe Mongolian Beef was tasty and nice to try it with bread - although I would have preferred it with rice. \n\nIt's a great find though. Go before a line of Mission Techies find it.", "author": "Stanley B."}

The Spice Jar is definately worth a visit. It feels like a good date place. Not a date where you're trying to spend alot of money but one where it's two down to earth people wanting good food and conversation. Parking is sparse and the restaurant is small. In my opinion it being small gives it charm.  It's more down home then hipster with a diy light fixture giving off soft light to compliment the decor that's chill yet urban. \n\nThe food was delicious. My wife ordered ramen. She loved the flavor but questioned the texture. Not in a bad way, but just comparing it to other places. She ate it  all. I had mongolian beef. It comes with bread to make a little sandwich but I think I would have enjoyed it more with just the tradition white rice. My cousin ordered the Pho.

Not the best I've had, but still somewhat tasty. \n\nFor the main courses we had the Spicy Sesame Miso Ramen. It really wasn't that spicy even with spicy in the name. It was decent. You could probably afford to increase the spiciness across all dishes. We had the Spice Jar Fried rice.

I think they are in their honeymoon phase right now and are overwhelmed with popularity.  So, be prepared to wait.  There were only two parties ahead of us late on a weeknight and it took us about an hour to finally get seated.  However, the owners were SUPER friendly and conscientious.  They noticed that we had been waiting quite a while for especially chatty SF elitists who had finished dinner, already paid, yet still would not relinquish their seats even though there was a line of people waiting to get seated!  So, the owners sat us outside for a bit, served us water, and complimentary garlic edamame.  Which was delicious, by the way.  They were really sweet...which is also why I hesitate to say that although some of the food was fantastic, some of it was not as impressive as I would have hoped.  Which hurts me to say because they seem like super nice people--serious dilemma, but I have to speak the truth!\n\nPork Bao - This was the bomb dot com.  HUUUUGE chunka pork that was doused in some delicious barbecue served on a steamed bun.  Very flavorful and super tender.  Slightly difficult to hold and eat though without making a mess.  But, they serve it with wet napkins to clean up before/after.  Thoughtful!  P.S. the pork is still attached to the bone, so before you chomp down, make sure that you take the bone out first!\n\nChicken Karaage - Nicely fried without being too greasy.  It was crispy and piping hot when it arrived.  Both of the guys I was dining with loved this dish but I wasn't as \"in love\" with it.  But maybe that's because fried food just isn't my thing.  It was good, don't get me wrong but I would take the steamed pork bao over it any day.\n\nHar Gaw - Wanted to love this...really wanted to.  I love those Cantonese shrimp steamed dumplings with the clear chewy skin but these were oversteamed.  The skin was a bit too thick and started breaking apart.  The shrimp pieces were generous but did not taste too fresh which left a strange aftertaste in my mouth.\n\nTonkatsu Ramen - Ramen broth was thick and delicious without being overpowering and the noodles were also spot on.  The meat was good too, very similar to the pork in the pork bao.  But, the egg was not hard-boiled and the saffron was just too overwhelming.  I know that they were trying to make it a more fusion dish but the saffron was too much.  It actually detracted from the rest of the dish--even if it did look more decorative.\n\nI think the food has potential and I'd like to try some of the other dishes but only 2 out of 5 really blew me away.  But, although the food was so-so, the service and atmosphere were fantastic.\n\nThe space itself is small but really cute.  I love the branch/lightbulb chandelier.  The lightbulbs are all unique and it's really cute.  I also love the quote on the wall: \"People who love to eat are always the best people\" because duh.", "author": "Jess Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-13", "description": "Came here on the the first day they opened and my friend and I were lucky enough to snag the last table before the rush came in. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nBraised Spare Ribs Bao -- The thing was HUGE! I was expecting a smaller bao, kind of like peiking duck style. But this thing was more like a cross between a bao and a taco if you will. The meat was really tender and came off the bone, just like the waitress said. Even though there was a bone in it, the amount of meat they gave us was still pretty generous. The bao was very thick and doughy. The combination of the two was a disaster in my mouth. Although the meat had a decent flavor to it, the bread completely overpowered the meat, and it was difficult to swallow because it was so dry. The pickled veggies helped, but not too much. After the first bite, I ended up eating the bao and the meat separately. Even though it wasn't intended to be served that way, it tasted much better in my opinion.\n\nHar Gow -- One order comes with four har gows, but they separate the har gows into two steamers so they don't stick together. There is also a piece of lettuce between the har gows and the steamer, maybe to keep it from sticking to the steamer or for sanitary reasons perhaps? I'm not quite sure. The skin of the har gow is really thick, unlike traditional har gows. It comes very close to tasting like bao to me. The skin is very sticky, so it sticks really well to the steamer and the lettuce, and I completely destroyed one of the har gows before I even got it onto my plate. :( The prawns were huge! But, the har gows soaked in the flavor of the lettuce in the steamer, which took away even more of the authenticity of the har gows. :(\n\nShu Mai -- The most authentic dish that we ordered, in my opinion.  They were slightly smaller than the har gows, but not by much. The texture of the skin was thin, and the filling had a good pork to mushroom ratio. The mushroom is subtly more noticeable than the pork, just how I like it.\n\nGarlic Aonori Fries -- They were surprisingly good! Most likely just frozen Sysco fries with garlic aonori powder. But I'm not complaining! I could sit in front of the TV and eat these all day!\n\nZen Noodle Soup -- The waitress said this dish is one of the few dishes that the owner bought over from the previous restaurant due to is popularity. She had a lot of good things to say about it, so it felt wrong not to order it. However, I am a wimp and cannot handle spicy foods, we asked them to tweak it a little bit and make it as mild as possible. This was also the last dish to come out, so we were already pretty full by the time it go to us. The soup had good flavor, but it was a little sour for my liking. They use rounded rice noodles for the dish. There was surprisingly a lot of seafood also. The were only a few pieces of calamari, which were slightly chewy, but still tender enough for me to swallow. The shrimp was a bit overcooked, but that's usually the case when you order shrimp with a soup. They were very generous with the mussels, and it was probably the best part of the dish. The mussels were on the smaller side, but I guess the amount they gave us made up for it.\n\nWasabi Ale -- Not my cup of ale. Very interesting taste. I thought the taste was similar to some sort of powder mix. I really wanted to like it because of how unique it was, but my taste buds said no. :( My friend enjoyed it, so I just let him drink all of it.\n\nThe place is pretty small. They could seat maybe 25-30 people or so. When we walked in, they were trying to fix the balance on one of the tables. The aisles were pretty narrow too, and it was difficult to not bump into other parties when we walked out. Decent food, but clearly, they have a few kinks to work out.", "author": "Vivian L."}

Gotta say, I ate everything that came to the table and my favorite was the albacore carpaccio! Next favorite and it was a close tie, was the shrimp dumpling. So tasty! Also loved the Mongolian beef and the crispy calamari salad. The ramen could have used more flavor and the seafood fondue had a strange taste I couldn't quite place. Otherwise, all was really really good. Go and check them out!", "author": "Tera K."}

There are definitely some unique items on the menu that would be hard to find elsewhere but somehow i left feeling slightly underwhelmed\n\nWe had the shrimp dumplings and cast iron seafood fondue which were probably the highlights. For mains, we had the laksa and the salmon both of which were above average but nothing spectacular. \n\nI'd definitely frequent this place if i lived in the area or happened to be in the neighborhood but I dont think i'll  make a plan to come back.\n\nThere is a LOT really good asian food in SF which makes competition really tough and while this place is a solid B+ it just falls short of an A for me", "author": "Aditya J."}

The staff at Spice Jar really care about you and are trying very hard to give you a pleasant, delicious experience. They are friendly and cheerful and aware of the fact that many of their patrons are waiting in long lines to eat (a fact that is made evident by their generous offerings of free edamame)  pulling my rating into the 4-star region. \n\nSo, I do not recommend going any time in the next few weeks (there are still some logistic items for them to figure out) but I feel that in a month or two things will really have settled down and the menu and speed will have been adjusted enough to really be a gem of the Mission district.

I've had this place bookmarked for some time now, and took my gf out on a night we were having a particularly hard time deciding what to eat. The wait was only about 10 minutes long on a Thursday night. The menu featured some interesting items both familiar and new, so we chose to go with the shu mai pork dumplings and short rib bao as appetizers, followed by the Mongolian beef and laksa soup. The shu mai were good but nothing too special. The short rib bao is something I would definitely come back for, though. The beef is so tender, and is perfect wrapped in the bun with all that sauce! The Mongolian beef had good flavors, and the portion is adequate but not worth $14. The Laksa soup was definitely worth every penny. Super delicious!", "author": "Gabriela M."}

We watched the drawn-out drama with Local's Corner and then saw it close and very eagerly anticipated what would fill the vacancy. And there it was: Spice Jar. Using our dogs as a daily excuse to walk by, we'd peer in, check out the posted menu, and sort of scrunch up our noses thinking...good luck. A 'Greatest Hits' of Asian food??? What????\n\nWell, I'd say they're about a month in now and we decided it was a good time to check it out. First thing: they got a hood!!!! That was one thing Local's Corner said they weren't able to have in that space, which was why they used induction. But Spice Jar managed to get it approved, which was great to see.\n\nEvery single person we encountered was SUPER nice and attentive. It's a small space and they were packed. But everything flowed so smoothly. No one appeared stressed and we never had long waits for drinks, refills, or food. They were functioning as though this place had been here for years. \n\nFor drinks, we ordered a couple different beers. We love beer and were thrilled to see beers on tap. I tried the green tea iced tea and loved it. Super refreshing and not at all sweet. Great for green tea lovers. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the har gow and chicken karaage. Both were fine. Nothing spectacular but just right for a local comfort food place. Yes, we've had better har gow and chicken karaage but for a place literally right around the corner from home, we were totally happy.\n\nThe tonkotsu ramen and chicken green curry came next. My husband is a ramen freak. We love Ivan Ramen and Momofuku in NY. In the Bay Area, Ramen Shop in Oakland is by far our favorite. We weren't expecting to be thrilled by Spice Jar's ramen but were very pleasantly surprised. Of course, if we have the choice, we'd obviously take Ramen Shop any day. But again, to have this less than 5 minutes away on foot is a miracle. It's a totally decent, good solid ramen. Finally, my green curry! I want to eat green curry right up until I die and am forever in search of good ones wherever I go. (Coincidentally, we recent visited Farmhouse Kitchen, a new Thai restaurant also in the Mission where I ordered green curry. Now, my husband and I have eaten green curry a bazillion times from New York, Boston, San Francisco, Paris, Berlin...and Thailand on many occasions. So I think it's safe to say that we're fair judges of what green curry should look and taste like. Not to get off track since this is a review of Spice Jar, but we were horrified by Farmhouse Kitchen's green curry. HORRIFIED.) Okay, I'm back. Spice Jar's green curry really made me smile. Seriously. They nailed the flavor and consistency. The chicken was super tender and moist. They could toss in some more goodies as it was just some eggplant, cherry tomatoes and a little basil. But all in all I am on my knees thanking heaven for access to some very good green curry a stone's throw from my front door. \n\nAnd the price!!! All that for fifty-something dollars?!?! How happy are we?!? For a small neighborhood restaurant, they're doing a lovely job. Great addition to the neighborhood. Great service. Great value.", "author": "Amy K."}

Really wanted to like this place, and it's not like I dis-like it, but it didn't wow me or make me want to think I ought to go there again. At least not for now. It's a cute corner restaurant with decent menu and super kind staff (which I assume is the owner). Food wasn't bad either, but again, no wow factor. If I lived near-by, I might be a regular, but living down this far on the peninsula, it's hard for me to recommend it over at least a handful of other similar joints in San Francisco.

Sure - it's fried tofu and not tofu puffs, but it's still yummy tofu. The broth, not as spicy as original flavor, but still thick and has that grainy curry powder texture. Overall, it's 3 out of 5 for authenticity, but I still think it's a good dish and I'll have it again.\n\nThe other dish we had was Calamari Salad. It's good portion of calamari, crispy on the outside and absorb some of the salad dressing which is very delicious. I can't wait already to come back for it.", "author": "Guacamole L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-27", "description": "3.5 stars. \nThis new restaurant is still working out kinks.  \nFriday night dinner was very crowded, about 20 min wait to sit, and then another 20 minutes for food to arrive (2 bowls of noodles).  The owners should probably streamline the menu to account for the small kitchen and limited cooks. If you have to make 5 kinds of (very different) noodle broths, on top of all these other menu items, it's going to take forever to serve everyone.  \nTable next to me complained that their appetizer dumplings arrived 40 minutes into the dinner (after they were already full from everything else, and tried to send it back, but the server said something about how he is just the server and couldn't do anything about the speed of food).  \n\nPho ga was light and not strongly flavored; the chicken was rubbery and dry.  When the waitress asked how my food was, I showed her the rubber chicken and she immediately took it away to remake it (even though I insisted I didn't mind eating the noodles alone).  Although this was very nice, my eating companion was then left with the problem of eating alone or waiting for my food to be remade while his soup got cold.  \nZen noodle soup was fine but nowhere near the spice or deliciousness of comparable noodle soups at Kitchen Story.   \nAlso got some mongolian beef and fried rice to go, nothing special there.  Next time, I would probably stick with the japanese menu items.  \nMatcha iced tea was delicious! \nOverall a very clean, hip place with decent food but nothing too special.  The owners are very kind and caring and I hope they work things out!", "author": "T Y."}

However, the dressing was the highlight of the night.  It packed a lot of flavor, but was light enough not to overpower the salad.  The noodles were a nice touch as well.  \n\nLastly, was the bbq korean steak with mushu wraps. For the mushu wraps we weren't expecting to get tortilla wraps but that's okay. The steak was perfectly cooked and just melted in your mouth. And the sauce that it was cooked in? Perfection. \n\nWe will definitely be coming back.

This place is a treasure.\nSpice Jar is a small, neighborhood restaurant that serves Asian Comfort Food. I had high expectations but the food was so much more complex and delicious than I anticipated.\nMy boyfriend and I shared the cucumber salad (fresh, crunchy, spicy.) Then he had the Mongolian Beef (thin slices of meat with green onion, sesame, hoisin and what tasted like a wine reduction.) I had a seafood coconut broth with basil, calamari and mussels. \nEveryone who works here is so very lovely. The wife of the owner spent a lot of time describing the dishes and outlining their most popular items (their ramen and the calamari salad looked incredible.)\nI recommend you visit at slight off hours (11:50 for lunch, rather than 12:00, for example) because already the place has lines out the door at peak hours (they are very organized and seat you as quickly as they can; but the place is the type where you'd want to linger rather than rush.)", "author": "D Z."}

But finding chicken with a side taste is not something I can recommend. \n\nThe cook told me the chicken gets cooked in the morning. I believe chicken stays fresh for a while after it has been cooked, so I assume the chicken is either not getting cooked right away after it's bought OR not stored cold enough OR the vendor might not store the chicken correctly.

Like what we use for chicken fried rice. The whole thing taste like an experiment, put all together with left over Chinese food.
