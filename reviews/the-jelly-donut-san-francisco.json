Not only did I get an apple fritter, they threw in some complimentary donut holes!!!\n\nThis place may look no frills, but the donuts are quite contrary. My fritter was a big portion for only $2.00.

My favorite donut place ever is Vasy's in Fremont, and this place holds its own in terms of quality and price.\n\nAlso, the people who work here are extremely friendly and it makes me happy to buy donuts from them. The first time I came here, I opened my paper bag after getting to work and realized that the lady (who very enthusiastically called me \"sweetie\" several times) had popped in an extra old fashioned donut.

The Jelly Donut was exactly what I was looking for. It's about two blocks away from the 24th Street Mission BART station, so I was able to make a quick pit stop in a matter of minutes.\n\nWhen I went around 8:30 am on a weekday, there was no line and I walked right up to the counter. The lady working the counter was very friendly and greeted me with a smile. I ordered a selection of six donuts and paid only a little over 6 bucks, which is great value. Plus she threw in a maple old fashioned for free. I love that service!\n\nMy whole team enjoyed the donuts. I went with with a classic, a glazed old-fashioned, and really enjoyed it. It had just the right amount of crunch on the outside while the inside remained soft and doughy.\n\nI would highly recommend this donut spot to anyone looking for donuts in the mission or near a Bart station.

Because its selection can be hit or miss and not fresh later in the day. All doughnuts are baked during the night, so their freshness wanes during the day. Its apple fritters aren't ready til after 10 am for some peculiar reason. Its coffee is horrible and tastes like dirty water.\n\nI suggest getting there early before 7 am for truly fresh doughnuts. The counter intelligence is a bit gratuitously and ingratiatingly friendly, calling you sweetie. The little old woman during the day is abrupt and seems rude,  but to be fair she suffered a stroke and has issues. The woman at night is so wonderful and generous, she makes up for the lack of the freshness of doughnuts or lack of selection. If you tip her a dollar for all the free doughnuts she loads you up with, you'll have a friend for life. I didnt realize that the Cambodians took doughnuts to the next level in this country.

And hey, it's been a while since I've had a good apple fritter, why not stop somewhere and pick one up.\n\nI love the apple fritters at Happy Donuts at Pac Bell Park.  But they're not open until 10:30.  The Jelly Donut is open at 7:00, so there we go.  Besides, it gives me a chance to write another Yelp review, heh heh . . .\n\nThe Jelly Donut is located in the Mission District, the land of no parking.  I parked at 25th & South Van Ness, only one block away, which is pretty good.  A flat brisk walk took me to a tiny storefront with a few small tables and lots of donuts staring at me.  It's not the clean, white, too-sanitized look of Krispy Kreme;  just the neighborhood donut shop that looks like it's been here since Art Agnos was mayor.  $1.75 later, back to the car I went.\n\nThe fritter is big.  It filled the small white bag I took with me.  It was room temperature when I got it, not that that bothered me, I don't need it hot.  Slightly crunchy, quite tasty, took a long time to eat it all.  Happy Donuts is still better, though, because they have apple slices cooked inside and Jelly Donuts' apple is cooked in the dough.  Oh well . . .\n\nI should also mention that my bag also came with four donut holes.  So I can review the donuts, too.  Good ol' fashioned donuts, not the mushy stuff you get at Krispy Kreme.  I could probably eat my normal 8 donuts from Jelly Donut, whereas I find it hard to finish 4 from Krispy Kreme.\n\nA good place for breakfast, on your power walk through the Mission, a short snack.  Or if you're taking care of your friend's kids, and you want to get revenge on something your friend did, you can take the kids to the Jelly Donut a half hour before you take them home, feed them lots of donuts, and get them all sugared up before they go back to mom & dad.

Also came by two nights ago and had a couple of donuts right before they closed on Wednesday night; they don't do a second run of new donuts midday, so if you are coming by here late, expect relatively stale raised donuts (but I'm sure the cake/old-fashioneds are just fine).\n\nBut again, on both visits, the service was super friendly, chatty and cool.  Lots of attention paid to my daughter and you could tell these guys have a relationship with a lot of the locals.  And the prices here are very fair; 85 cents for a glazed ring.

For some reason, you order one donut and they always give you two. Some times they give you even more than two.

It's something to show your friends when they are visiting the neighborhood, like a magic trick. No one believes you when you tell them, and then it happens!\n\nThe donuts are average coffee shop donuts, no artisanal craft cronuts for the hipster consumer.

I didn't eat the donut the day off, so the taste of the donut could have definitely been skewed. However, I still had really good day old donuts in the past, so am not sure what to really think in this case. My friend and I stopped by to pick up some donuts after lunch around the corner at Wise Sons Delicatessen (delicious). The Jelly Donut was rated one of the top Glazed Donuts in SF by 7x7, so I've been wanting to compare their glazed donut to Stan's Donuts from Santa Clara (one of my personal favorites). I purchased half a dozen glazed to split with friends, and the girl behind the counter was super nice and threw in some free donut holes and a chocolate glazed donut for free. She also didn't charge me for the plastic bag. \n\nThe bf and I heated up the Original Glazed Donut (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-jelly-donut-san-francisco?select=8xfsY3sBhNS87oPXsLsJ0A#8xfsY3sBhNS87oPXsLsJ0A) in the microwave the next day (like we normally do), but it still had a stale-ish taste. The donut was also dry and not very fluffy, so we definitely felt let down after the high expectations from 7x7. In any case, I'm giving them the benefit of doubt in this case, and will have to come back and try a fresh donut next time. However, this is one of the friendliest donut shops I've ever been to, and they definitely have a great customer service! Parking around this area of the Mission usually isn't too bad, and there should be a good amount of metered spots available.", "author": "Amy D."}

It doesn't look like anything special from the outside but the employees are very friendly, the donuts are fresh, and the prices are cheap. Most of the donuts cost $1 and the employees will often throw in extra donut holes or broken donuts for free. I have had a chocolate coconut, old fashioned glazed, and an apple fritter. The chocolate coconut was my favorite, I like that their donuts are denser and cakier (I'm not a big fan of the airy Krispy Kreme style donuts). \n\nI would give it 5 stars, except the coffee is just ok (but only $1, so can't complain much) and I've only seen powder creamer instead of cold regular milk and cream.\n\nIf you're near the 24th mission BART station, walk by and grab a donut here!", "author": "Christine B."}

This is absolutely no frills very small neighborhood donuts shop which was founded in the 80's and run by the same family ever since.  If you are looking for trendy ambience and a stylish place to go, this is so not your place.  But if you appreciate genuine friendliness of the owners and very affordable selection of doughnuts and house coffee, then this place is for you.  I'm not into doughnuts, but ended up going to this place while waiting for my car breaks to be worked on in a break shop across the street.  There are literally only four small crowded together tables.  When I asked the owner named Panda if it would be OK for me to stay there for a few hours, she was very open and welcoming.  So I bought a coffee and a doughnut and settled down at one of the tables.  When I opened the bag it tuned out that in addition to the doughnut, the owner sneaked in a bunch of tender melt in your mouth doughnut holes.  What a nice surprise, I loved the doughnut holes. The regulars were filing in one after another; the owner knew all of them and had a kind word for for everyone, asking about their work and families.  You don't get to see places like this anymore.  I would definitely recommend this place to meet anyone's doughnut needs.  It is close to the 24th Street BART station.

Order a pair and you will be rewarded with a bounty of extra donut holes. I tried ordering a single once and the order was magically tripled. When I stood there agape at the goings on, Ms Donut offered: \"do you want more?\" (I ordered a dozen and got much, much more.)\n\nJust as the Platonic form of Quantity stalks their sweet-smelling premises, so too does Quality lurk eagerly behind their brightly lit display. These tantalizing toruses are fresh, cakey, and light. I find their frosted features a bit on the sugary side but that's hardly an error. Their plain cake donut is my fave but even the smallest morsel of their fresh glazed donut holes will make you lightheaded. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is: I like this place and I like their donuts, and you should eat there because it's tasty and has good value.\n\nObligatory Title Pun: I don't think you're ready for this JELLY.\n\nMenu Readability: Just look at the donuts, fool.\n\nNeed to mention: Prices are so low as to be laughable.

I stopped by one morning and purchased one crumb cake donut and one chocolate covered custard round.  When I returned to work with my morning snack I found an extra crumb donut inside the bag.\n\nThe crumb cake donuts (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/np1YpFt9GfX-umR1ZKx_uA?select=xlDGpQjRzb1hdpkJnRV_ZA) were soft and fresh with moist cake and crumbs falling everywhere.

The chocolate covered custard donut (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/np1YpFt9GfX-umR1ZKx_uA?select=RNoD2CLUKnpunN7MyYVfcg) was good, but I was a bit disappointed with the small pocket of custard inside.  I like custard donuts loaded with custard.  I'll return one day to see if their jelly donut is special enough to name a shop after.\n\nIt's a small shop on the corner of South Van Ness and 24th Street.

We ordered the biggest apple fritter I've ever seen in my life, one crumb donut, one chocolate frosted raised donut, and I also asked for 1 donut hole. The total came to $3, which I thought was a pretty good price.* The bag seemed surprisingly heavy when it was handed over (part of this was due to the fact that I did not yet fully appreciate just how big that apple fritter was). Imagine my delight at opening it up to find an extra crumb donut and a billion donut holes!\n\nThe donuts are really nice. The apple fritter was just slightly too dense for my taste but had a delightful crusty edge to it. Also, I'm not kidding about the size. 6 people ate some of it -and there were still leftovers-. I haven't really had a crumb donut before (so I'm not totally sure that's what you would call this, either - but it seems appropriate) but I really liked it. On the other hand, sometimes I think a simple glaze frosting is all that's needed for a donut, which the chocolate glazed certainly demonstrated. The donut holes were huge (clearly a theme for this place) - I imagine they could only be holes of a donut with an 8 inch diameter or so.

PLUS, they always give you an extra donut or a couple donut holes for free! I feel like giving this place 1-2 stars based on not being able to save 37.5 cents is a bit stingy and unfounded, but that's just me.\n\nDonuts are baked fresh everyday.. my personal faves are the cake crumb donuts and the French twist (I think that's what they're called) donuts.

Tasted kinda bland....but, heck, a donut is a donut, right? That's what I wanted....and that's what I got!", "author": "Danyell K."}

The donuts are delicious and the service is amazing, silly as it sounds to say that about a place you go to and get donuts... but it's true. The smiling catches and I always leave with a grin and too many delicious donuts.", "author": "Ricky B."}

I think the crumbcakes I had here were a bit underdone, though (maybe they churn out more than they keep under quality control -- must have to make a lot to give so many away!).

(in Homer Simpson fashion)  The fact that this place is around the corner from my house makes me love it, but after having their donuts on two separate occasions and being floored at their tastiness, I now can say that I love The Jelly Donut unconditionally.  Both times, the person working has given us a special little treat in our bag to find when we get home (read - getting HOOKED UP).  So far I've tried - old fashioned chocolate, chocolate covered custard-filled, cinnamon crumble, glazed buttermilk bar, apple fritter, glazed donut holes, and of course, the obligatory glazed jelly donut.  Looking back at this list, you might be judging me right now - but don't.  Give this place a try and you'll see just how wonderful it is, and you won't blame me for my lengthy list of favorites.  I've never been disappointed with anything I've tried.  One tip - it's cash only, but there is an ATM onsite.  Jelly Donut, you have earned a loyal customer in me!", "author": "Jenna C."}

We had read the Yelp reviews, and very quickly we understood the flavor from the bad reviews. There were 3 people behind the counter, 2 of them smiling at us. The smiling ones were just there for companionship of the grumpy one, that was in charge of getting us our donuts. I asked for the maple/cream filled. It took 3 tries even with me pointing to receive the kind I wanted, then she gave me a random free donut. The place was run down and grimy. After Starman got his donut (the smiling ones cajoled grimly into giving him a free donut), we got out of there quickly, and ate our trial donuts on the street. They weren't very good or special. I tucked my free one away in my coat pocket. We felt tired and greased out on just one, and so didn't visit any other donut shops. National Donut day was over early. Later that night, when I was very hungry after aikido practice and waiting for the bus, I found my free donut and ate it. At that moment, it was delicious. But I won't ever go back for more at the Jelly Donut.", "author": "Herschell L."}

The doughnuts are top notch-no artificial aftertaste, fresh and just sugary enough to get those taste buds watering.\nThe best part is the woman working the register always slips me an extra one! I have gotten at least $20 in free doughnuts by now.", "author": "Hayley S."}

True the coffee sucks and the doughnuts honestly are just so-so but it has that neighborhood vibe and the couple behind the counter just couldn't be nicer.  Lovely, lovely people.

Right when I got there I was put off by the straggly looking customers and the over all cleanliness of the place, but I was already there so whatever, I ordered some donuts. 1 glazed, one chocolate and an apple fritter thing.  Like everyone else said I got some freebies. \n\nGet in my car, and start eating...\"Uhgggg.\" Something not so soft and chewy. NEVER GOING BACK. \n\nIm starting to give up on yelp. There are better places in the east bay. Like World's Fair Donuts. \n\nIm done with donuts for a while. Horrified. Should have trust my better judgement.", "author": "Cindy D."}
