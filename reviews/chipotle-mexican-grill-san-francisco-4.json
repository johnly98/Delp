Overall it was standard and satisfying enough - the salsa was perfectly spicy, I will say. \n\nStaff was friendly but the restaurant itself could be cleaner and their soda machine had no carbonation. The guy at the register gave me a heads up on the carb, but didn't say why or if it was being fixed? A bit odd and disappointing since I was craving a soda, but the lemonade came out just fine. \n\nI'll never go out of my way to eat here - or at any Chipotle for that matter - but I wouldn't be too upset about another quick meal here. That said the prices are egregious ($11.50 for a bowl and soda, no meat) and I could get way better Mexican food for less virtually anywhere in the city.", "author": "Alex K."}

We knocked on the door and no worker even looked our way.  They finally opened the doors at 11:02am.  One of the men waiting with me walked straight to the counter to ask why they opened late and why they couldn't let us wait inside.  Instead of apologize, the worker named Jazmine who was not at the counter demanded, \"What did you say?!  What do you want?!\"  The man repeated that they should open on time.  Jazmine walked away to the other end of dining room but yelled, \"We're short!  We can't let you in till we're ready!  What do you want me to say?!  You don't like it, you can go somewhere else!\"  Jazmine never apologized.  What was worse, a DinerDash guy came in, cut in front of me and waived his phone showing his pickup order.  They immediately started making his order, even though I had been waiting the whole time.  I exclaimed, \"I've been waiting and you make HIS order before mine!\"  Jazmine again yelled something that was not an apology.

I'm a big man with a big appetite and nothing irks me more than to order a burrito bowl and gets scoops half the size of my regular franchise location. Here, they exceed my scoop expectations, meaning I don't have to double down on meat while ignoring awkward glances from the no-meat, no-rice, no-sour-cream-no-cheese, no-anything-tasty vegetarian behind me. \n\nThe atmosphere, as I mentioned, leaves much to be desired. It's a small place and being in downtown SF usually means crowds. Each time I've come I've had to grab a table at butt level with someone at a higher bench.

Mostly because it wasn't fast in any sense of the word. It's like the employees are just all hanging out and maybe they'll make you some food if you're lucky. The lack of speed with which the people move there is incredible. So that's my chief concern with this Chipotle location.\n\nSecondary concern was food quality. I went in around 1 pm on a Saturday and they were scraping the bottom of every pan. Come on guys. You know when your lunch rush is.

The initial tortilla-rice-beans guy was fine, but the mea-salsas-extras guy was sooo surly. \n\nI was ordering for three people to bring food home and I asked him which salsa was the tomatillo one. He proceeded to dump the hot red one on the burrito. Knowing what I know of salsas and my friends taste, I figured the red one would be too spicy and that tomatillo salsa should be green. Turns out both the hot and mild salsa are made with tomatillos. Why didn't he ask for clarification if they both had tomatillos???\n\nI don't handle spicy food well at all and I know how quickly too much spicy salsa can ruin an entire burrito so I asked him to remake it. The huffiness he gave was just crazy. I wasn't rude, I apologized, I said please. I don't think it merited such attitude. \n\nPlus, this store was pretty skimpy on all the portions, but I've been noticing that in a lot of chipotles recently so maybe it's just the company's way of dealing with rising wages/food prices.", "author": "Jamie S."}

Heavy on the sodium but every order tastes exactly like the last - no surprises here.  \n\nLONG:\nLet you in on how I handle my long distance relationship: we get on the phone and agree on a place to eat, then with our headsets, drive \"together\" to our agreed upon destination.  Since so many places in Portland are local and unique, we sometimes will do a chain I can find in Cali like Chipotle.  Otherwise, we just order a different version of the same thing at comparable restaurants.  Sometimes, my date will even eat dinner twice to conceal what we are doing because it's that pitiful - yearning to share a meal together more than during our special trips.  \n\nYou probably think this is crazy, but did I mention that she's my soul-mate/ twin and we've been torn apart by adulthood?  She's married and I hardly ever get to see her because she's in another state with no plans to move back - ever.  Yeah, sad story, super-wack, but I love her new life and tribe -  for that I get on a plane whenever I can.  When the distance gets to be too much, we pick a spot and then tare some food up.  And we do this pretty often, even though she's a grad student w/ 4 kids, and I'm a miserable law student.  True love knows no barriers. \n\nFOOD\nI personally like their burrito bowl w/ chicken, black beans, cheese, sour cream, guac, corn salsa, no rice.  The other R-sita always orders barbacoa all the salsas and sour cream.  We both get it to go, then eat together in our respective cars. \n\nObviously, I miss my R-sita dearly right now - having tele withdraws since both in finals [I turned my phone back on but she left hers off] hence the excessive Yelping.  While it might be a minute before we do it again, I will never stop going to Chipotle for a gringo burrito/bowl to go.  Even if we become neighbors again, we are going.  Been going hard for 11 years.  Not just because it's another public portal for us to connect, but it is good enough to stop time.  This is where my co-dependence starts and ends. \n\nNOTE:\nAnd if you see a girl who looks like me in Portland eff-ing up a juicy barbacoa while on her cell, might be my girl getting more than a gringo fix.  Don't bother her - she's likely on a \"date\" with me.  I need it.    \n\nTIP: \nIf you have an iPhone, you can download an app to place your order.

When I moved to San Francisco about 5 months ago, I was excited to try all the Burrito options the city has to offer. I have tried a lot of burritos but I still get nostalgic for a big fresh burrito from Chipotle. I was told 2 days ago that there was a Chipotle by my school downtown so I had to go check it out.\n\nI walked in excited for the burrito that I have come accustomed to since I started going to the first one in Denver about 15 years ago. The fresh lime cilantro rice, sauted fajita veggies and clean refreshing Guacamole, YUM. They proceed to make my burrito and my heart sunk. They put so little filling on the tortilla that I had to say something. They told me that they only put in one small scoop of rice, beans, and veggies. I asked them to put more and they did, which I appreciate. The woman (she was new) had trouble rolling the burrito even though that was the average amount of filling that I have had at any other Chipotle location. This place has not gotten their burrito rolling art mastered. All of this would only knock of one or two stars for me because I would hope the food would redeem my experience.\n\nUpon going to pay, the manager (I think) gave me a lecture on why they under fill their burritos and why what I got was not standard to them. She said that she has heard a lot that they put less than other locations and they use a different standard than other Chipotles. I am not a big fan of being lectured to when my expectations are not met, but I still had my burrito, and it was going to be great.\n\nFirst, the rolling was sub-par so everything mushed out as I ate. Rolling of a massive burrito is an art they have not mastered. It also did not help that they over heated the tortilla and it became crunchy, not stretchy. Inside, the rice was good as well as the beans and guac. The veggies, however, were mushy. They have always been crunchy and fresh tasting, but these had none of the qualities that I look for. As I sat watching people get their burritos, I saw many people walking away with something of a size that should embarrass the founder of Chipotle. \n\nI have loved Chipotle for years (except the few when McDonalds owned them) and this will not stop me from going to other locations especially in Colorado and everywhere else I have had great burritos. But please do not judge all Chipotles based on this one location. The rest deserve your love. This one, not so much.", "author": "Peter V."}

I admit, I'm slightly embarrassed to say I pretty much checked up on you every week when I found out you were going to settle into the neighborhood. Embarrassed? I guess truth is, I'm not at all that embarrassed. I'm proud to scarf down a whole giant burrito to myself- don't judge! \n\nFor a very busy opening day, the restaurant seemed quite organized. Slightly chaotic, but there were plenty of workers frantically jumping around. Despite the lunch crowd, the workers were very welcoming and friendly. The restaurant is slightly small, but very cleanly designed! I like the industrial look, with very interesting rows of tables and lights. \n\nNow the best part? Ordering online or through my iPhone app!! 6 burritos, and 15 mins later-all I had to do is go up to the take out window to pick it up. My order was a bit behind, but I forgive you guys- opening day is stressful! Thank you for slapping on a sticker with the corresponding name to each burrito!\n\nI'm an occasional sucker for chain joints like you, and I admit that I enjoyed the meal a lot. The burrito was a bit sloppy in structure, but hopefully this is perfected. The barbacoa (shredded beef) was full of flavor and tender! I like to top my burrito off with corn salsa & a little hot salsa (it has a bit of a kick!). For extra charge, guacamole can be added. So a typical burrito cost me about $10-a bit more costly than a taqueria, but I forgive you. \n\nThanks Chipotle! I'll probably be seeing you soon! And like you said...\n\nLife is Burritoful! ;)", "author": "Catherine O."}

All of the people there were SO rude to my father, who is older and cannot hear very well, just because he asked for clarification when ordering. They gave us so much attitude, the service was absolutely horrible, the food was not up to par with other Chipotles I have eaten at, and there were about 10 seats in the whole restaurant, so my family had to eat separately.

You know the food isnt going to make you cream your pants or anything. It is, though, going to make you think about it when it's not around and more likely than not make you go out of your way to get it in your mouth. Rawr.\n\nFood aside, the atmosphere here was way fun. I ran in at 9:45 or so on a Wednesday, worried I wouldn't make it before close, and there was a line almost out the door. Annoying? Not at all. Jovial and convivial and festive. There's an energy in that neighborhood around that time of night (especially in the summertime when the tourists are all out and about) that this Chipotle embodied charmingly. \n\n\nReally though, the thing is this: I could not BELIEVE how awesome the staff here were. I order this really funky thing there (no details necessary, just, you know, imagine 7,656 grams of carbs in a cardboard bowl with an aluminum lid) and I almost always have to coax the person behind the line to make it right. It only has two ingredients, so it's not very laborious, they just don't seem to want to believe that I'm really asking for what I'm asking for. Not the case with this girl. She was ON BOARD man! She took me seriously right off the bat and made it just right,  and laughed at the silly wiiticisms I am apparently compelled (at mental gun point) to launch at servers or other food professionals I interact with. \n\nI bought a small drink, and the cashier (a different woman) just gave me a large cup instead gratis. She explained: \"Because we're just cool like that.\" \n\nYou sure are Chipotle on O'Farrell, you sure are....\n\nP.S. Fine! Stop bullying me! I get a Burrito Bowl with nothing but rice* and corn. God!\n\n*or, as I always say when I'm ordering it a \"shit ton\" of rice", "author": "Devin F."}

Decent price for a decent size burrito, but I would rather get a burrito bowl!  This location is a dent size with bar seats and table seats.\n\nI order the burrito bowl, it comes with choice of cilantro-lime rice, pinto or vegetarian black beans, meat (braised caritas or barbacoa, adobo-marinated and grilled chicken or steak) or guacamole, salsa and cheese or sour cream.  They have roasted vegetables that you have to ask for, (grilled onions, peppers)  then you can ask for a side of flour tortilla or tacos for free and make a small taco or use the flour tortilla to eat with burrito bowl\n\nOverall this place can be busy, but the line goes fast so it shouldn't be that bad of a wait.  The only thing I was a bit upset was that they were kind of skimpy on everything in my bowl.  It wasn't topped of as how I usually get it.  I told the person \"can I get a little extra\" several times and I guess he did not get it that he wasn't serving enough!!!  By the way you will get more with the burrito bowl, than getting a regular burrito!!!\n\n-Parking-\nThis is another location parking can be difficult, if you are shopping around downtown by Powell and O'Farrell street, then this would be a decent pit stop for food.", "author": "Kenneth Y."}

I don't really look for much more from this sort of establishment, and these guys delivery a perfectly serviceable fast taco or burrito.", "author": "Mark G."}

It may have been inspired by Tacaria's around here in the Mission district, but it is far inferior in every way and I am even from Denver way back when and lived a block from the original.

Like Starbucks or MacDonalds you know what to except and sometimes that is exactly what I want, no surprises.   This is the first time I have encountered a problem with this company.\n  I like Chipotle\"s  salads because of the dressing. Without the dressing this is a boring salad, good but boring.  With the dressing it is a really good salad.  Today, at this location only, they didn't have any dressing, Zero, and with no idea when the dressing would be ready.  I was willing to wait five, ten, even fifteen minutes for the dressing but I was told by two workers that there wasn't any dressing and none forthcoming any time soon if even that day.  I might have been ok with this except that they were half way through making my salad when I was told, halfway, my daughter's salad being even further along then halfway.  Oh, and before that revelation, they didn't have any brown rice although it was coming, soon, but obviously not soon enough for my order.  \nWhen in the service business, and especially the food service business, it reflects poorly on a brand to run out of items that are on the menu, especially items that make them unique. And it reflects on management when the customer isn't shown some sort of humility, like a coupon for 10% off or a free drink then and there. \nI will not be back to this location.", "author": "Danyle J."}

Their burritos probably weigh about 1/2 to 2/3 as much as an average one anywhere else and let's face it you go to Chipotle to get a (fresh and tasty) gut-bomb.", "author": "Mike L."}

I could have accepted that since I am an architect and appreciate the industrial style - if their architect wasn't inept and unable to properly size the furniture. I am slim but tall and could not for the life of me fit in between the bolted on table and bench... just ridiculous.\n4. they have sidewalk seating - great when the weather is nice. but you can't drink the beer you bought with your food when seated outdoors, at their own tables, supposedly due to some city ordinance??? either the chain (mcdonalds from what i hear) or the city - are inept.\n5. 6 people in line takes 20 minutes. just ridiculous.\n6. they need to buzz you in if you go to the restroom. really???\n\nso buh-bye chipotle, not sorry you're not in my town. you would never make it in new orleans anyway.", "author": "Vlad G."}

My husband and I are on vacation from Miami, so we are used to rude people; but the lady assembling the orders takes the cake!  After a long day of walking we were starving and decided to get food here.  I ordered a salad and was looking so forward to eating it, when I got to the register I asked for salad dressing; the lady at the assembly line that took my order overheard and told me they were out of dressing; I apologized to the cashier and told her I no longer wanted the salad...what is the point of a salad with no dressing.  The assembly line lady very rudely said \"for future reference, ask us if we have dressing first, that way we don't have to make the salad\".  First of all, I have never been to a Chipotle that has run out of dressing (i go once or twice a week). Second, she is the one that works there and knew they were out of dressing... To her I say this: For future reference, if someone asks for a salad and there is no dressing, let that person know... Chances are they will change their order and you don't have to make the salad! LOL! So rude!  My husband and I walked out laughing in pure disbelief that she had the audacity to say that to me; like if it was my fault... Horrible customer service by assembly lady... The cashier was nice.  Will NEVER go there again!", "author": "Marcio C."}
