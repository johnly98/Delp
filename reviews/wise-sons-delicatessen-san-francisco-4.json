I was intrigued since I was already in the mood for a sandwich, just not any 'ol plain sandwich though.\n\n$15.50 Corned Beef Reuben w/ Russian dressing, Swiss cheese & sauerkraut on rye:\nThis reuben turned out to be surprisingly small. It seemed like the guy stacking my sandwich didn't put enough corned beef in there. Now I actually don't enjoy biting into a mountain of meat, like you would get from certain popular Jewish delis. However, this sandwich really could have used more volume. It was cut in half and each half was only a few bites. Normally, I wouldn't have minded, but the price is rather steep.\nAs for taste, the corned beef was pretty good. The rye bread was buttery and nicely toasted. The Swiss cheese had melted a bit and the sauerkraut was only mildly acidic. It also came with a pickle.\n\nI also wanted to try their babka, but they didn't have it at the time. Apparently they serve a truncated version of their menu here, since it is a stand at the market and they don't have their full kitchen. \nIt was a good reuben. Taste was there, but for the price and the portion size, I most likely will not be returning for a sandwich. I'll give it a 7/10, but just barely.", "author": "Joy W."}

I could have gone to any of the locations, but according to other yelpers reviews the location at the Ferry Building is the best.\n\nMy friend and I split the rueben and classic with pastrami. I wouldn't quite say I was disappointed, but I wasn't blown away either. From all of the hype I was expecting it to be amazing. The pastrami itself was salty and tender. It was cooked perfectly - I loved that I was able to bite right through the sandwich (after a little jaw unhinging) without pulling it all out. The overall package (bread, sauces, etc) was a bit lacking and the pastrami was really the star of the show. I personally enjoy my ruebens a bit more saucy but could barely taste the dressing or slaw.\n\nIt's just unfortunate that all of the food in San Francisco has become relative to me and I couldn't help but wish I had gone to deli board instead.", "author": "Christine M."}

It wasn't until I moved to San Francisco and saw what passed as pastrami that I truly understood how good I had it.  Then came Wise Sons.  When I crave a nice hand carved pastrami or corned beef sandwich, they're the only ones I think of.  They still haven't mastered the NYC bagel yet, but I'm hoping they'll crack that case soon.\n\nPastrami: Best meat offering by far!  Nicely spiced exterior.  Tender, but still retains its shape.\n\nCorned Beef: Way better than those tough, overboiled slabs you get on St. Patrick's Day!  Subtle flavor throughout.  Firm, yet tender.\n\nBrisket: Probably the most lackluster of the meats; it's decent but you're better off ordering Pastrami or Corned Beef.\n\nBagel w/ Lox: Reminded me of brunching back in Manhattan, except this had higher quality cream cheese, fish and veggies/herbs.  The bagel was kind of meh, but the crunchy contrast it provided helped the experience.\n\nBialy w/ Lox: Like the bagel version, except without the bagel.  I enjoy a good bialy by itself, but it was too soft for an open-faced lox sandwich.  I'm not sure if their toaster was set too low or if bialys just don't toast well.\n\nMatzoh Ball Soup: Better than at a NYC diner, but not better than at specialty delis in NYC.  The Matzoh Balls were standard. The broth was light, but still held some decent flavors.\n\nLatkes: Generous sized potato pancakes.  They were reheated on the griddle to order, so not as crispy as one would get if made fresh right there.  The apple chutney was far superior to the apple sauce from a jar many places offer.\n\nPotato Salad: A nice side if it comes with your meal, but I wouldn't go out of my way to order it separately.\n\nHouse Pickles: Solid effort.\n\nChocolate Babka: So many delicious veins of chocolate flowing through this delicious dessert!  Kinda heavy, so like a meal by itself.  Or at least something to save for a 3PM coffee.", "author": "Adam B."}

I had definitely wanted to get it during the year, but since the kitchen in their bakery had been burned down in the Mission fire earlier in the year, it was difficult for them to bake very much.

The babka is this sweet cake with this awesome crumb topping. For the price - it's a steal!

How was it? Well the corned beef was well done and had some great flavor. Cheese was nice and oozy. The bread was decent. Maybe there were a few spots on the bread that were a bit too charred for me but overall it was a messy and delicious sandwich. It was just a bit pricey. For $12 I would've expected them to pile on a little more corned beef.  \n\nOh well. \n\nBut the food was indeed good and I am willing to give them another go.

That and the fact that it is Tuesday, I decided to take 1 mile walk down to the Ferry Building and try Wise Sons.  After standing in line for 15 minutes (it was a long line and this is a very popular place), I ordered a combo corned beef/pastrami sandwich on light rye, a side of coleslaw and an order of their home-made kugel.\n\nThe sandwich was great!  It's not \"piled high\" like I am used to, but it was a decent portion for the price ($11.50).  It came with two pickles.  Real pickles.  Real kosher style deli pickles.  Not those crappy sweet pickles that other so-called jewish delis in the area throw out.  The meat tasted like it was supposed to.  Flavorful and well cured.  My only complaint is that while they offered two kinds of mustard (a sweet mustard and a spicy mustard), they did't have any standard yellow deli mustard available.\n\nThe coleslaw was excellent, with a hint of spice, but not overpowering.\n\nThe kugel was amazing with green raisins and a crusted top with just the right kind of sweetness.  Almost as good as grandma used to make.  \n\nThis place is a must visit for anyone who appreciates good deli food.  I am very picky about my deli food (see my other deli reviews on Yelp).

Some day, you may know the true joy of eating a moist, sweet bread which has layers of sweet chocolate thickly swirled throughout. The babka at Wise Sons had a dry taste to the bread, and WTF, the chocolate was bittersweet!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-16", "description": "Perhaps I'll start out by saying that I hope to re-review Wise Sons down the road when they've established themselves in a more permanent setting. However, in their current location, I just can't say they're ready for prime time just yet.  While the food was good (in some cases, very good--more on that in a sec), the experience I had there was just awful.\n\nI was very excited to see another Jewish deli opening up in town, even if it was a pop-up restaurant. My people can't get enough of our roots in SF for reasons that have always escaped me. So, I was eager to give this new place a try. \n\nAccording to their pre-published menu, they start serving sammies around 11 a.m., so my friends and I arrived around 11:40 at their pop-up location on Valencia... a smallish cafe that is not set up for food prep. (They use hot plates to heat everything up.) As you can see by the other reviews on here, the word is out: the line was out the door and nearly a dozen people were standing inside waiting for their food.\nWhen we got to the front of the line, the very nice guy taking orders informed us that they were already out of pastrami (!!), did not have any more of the chocolate babka (other than a few samples, which were delish) and were nearly out of corned beef. Um, that's like a third of their menu. I wanted corned beef anyway, so I felt fortunate. I noshed on a truly wonderful pickle (also set out as a sample of sorts) in hopes it would tide me over.\n\nThen the waiting started... and went on... and on... and on. It took at least a half hour for my sandwich to arrive. In that time, a part of eight people arrived and got in line. By the way they were acting and interacting with the staff, it became very apparent that they were friends of the staff or possibly investors. About half of them got out of line and claimed eight of the maybe 20 seats in the caf\u00e9, despite the fact that there were nearly ten people who had already ordered waiting for a place to sit. When I mentioned it to one of the women that my friends and I were ahead of her and waiting for a table she was, shall we say, less than sympathetic. But her snotty rudeness isn't the restaurant's fault, is it? Just wait.\n\nRemember the chocolate babka they were out of? While I stood waiting for my food, a full plate of it magically appeared from the back and was offered to the Friends of Wise party. How thoughtful!\nAlso, when my order came up, in a tone that was neither hostile nor bitchy, I said to the man behind the counter I thought it \"was not cool\" that (despite their posted signs stating, \"Please be respectful of others waiting to eat\") they allowed parties to sit down when they hadn't even ordered yet, since it meant other customers (like my friends and me) basically had to go outside, stand on the sidewalk, and eat there. He stared at me, almost irritated, and said, \"Well there's nothing I can do about it,\" and walked away.  Seriously? Don't you WORK here? In disbelief I walked away and ate my sandwich outside.\n\n(And I would point out, by the way, that I was done eating before the Friends of Wise had even finished ordering, let alone received their food. Also, they had long since run out of corned beef as well by then but, aside from putting up a sign inside the restaurant, never went outside to tell those standing in line.)\n\nAgain, I have to point out in the spirit of fairness that Wise's food was good. My corned beef, while seasoned really well, was incredibly fatty. For $12, there really wasn't that much meat on the bread (at least when compared to other Jewish delis I've visited in SF, Chicago, LA and NYC). The bread was excellent and had a perfectly chewy-crunchy crust. The potato salad wasn't extraordinary, but was pretty decent.\n\nIf it wasn't for the experience I had here, I would give this place four stars in a heartbeat. If the Wises want to really open a class-act deli, they need to cater to all of their customers, not just those who quite clearly appear to be their friends. (Not to mention finding even a pop-up space more appropriate to their operation.) Bad food can certainly drive customers away, but a bad experience can also be equally repellant. \n\nI hope to visit again soon and give a better rating, but as they stand now, I won't be back.", "author": "Aaron L."}

We got there at 11:30 and there was already a huge line out the door for people waiting to order. The menu was limited but really good. Between 5 of my friends, we ordered and tried the majority of the dishes. My favorite was the pastrami Reuben. The meat was juicy and really well cooked. Also, they make their own rye bread, which was very fresh and worked nicely with the sandwich. When we were waiting in line the portions that other people had looked on the smaller side. However, in practice, the portions were just the right size. I was definitely very full when I was done. \n\nThe venue itself was pretty functional.

We went to yelp and Wise Sons popped up. Since were weren't finding much else around the neighborhood, we decided to eat here. And we're glad we did! \n\nIt was pretty busy when we got there and were a little concerned about seating but was able to snag a table outside. The staff is great. The cashier had a smile on her face, despite the countless amount of people making orders. Another staff member, upon seeing that we had snagged a seat outside, changed our order from \"to-go\" to \"here.\" I loved that he was concerned about the waste we would be creating by using the to-go cartons as opposed to plates.   \n\nI don't really remember what my friends ordered--even though I did share with one of them--but I got the Challah French Toast. It was DELICIOUS! I have had challah bread before, and really liked it, but as French Toast.... Amazing! It was a life changing moment. The generic, run-of-the-mill French Toast just won't cut it anymore. \n\nThe next time I'm in San Francisco I will definitely make a point to come here again.

Like everyone else, I've been longing for some NY deli here in multicultural land.  It never crossed my mind how hard that would be.  Perfecting a recipe for one dish takes tremendous effort, let alone a menuful.\n\nI'm here for the pastrami.  On rye. With cole slaw. And a pickle. \n\nThe bread is excellent.  Crispy crust, not too much caraway and a soft interior that stands up to the meat. It is a very good platform for what is to come.\n\nThe pastrami is a work in progress.  Cut \"brisket thick\" with a good peppery crust, a bit of smoky something and served perfectly warm.  A few bites were tough, I chalk that up to the thicker cut.  Thing is, the stuff holds up on its own, sans bread, it leaves a slightly salty, peppery heat after each bite.\n\nWhich leads to the cole slaw, a nice blend of white and purple cabbage with a good bit of carrot for sweetness to balance out the pepper of the pastrami.  As anyone who has made  cole slaw in large batches will tell you, the dressing sinks to the bottom.  You have to continuously stir it before service.  That said, the dressing seems light, with a good balance of sweet and vinegar.  Remember to stir in now and then.\n\nPickles.  My Mom made pickles in a big crock in the back yard when I was a kid.  Now Mom is a hard-core garlic pickle master, so my palate was really unprepared for the subtle masterpiece the Wise guys have produced.  See, when you're doing the pastrami thing, you really don't need a salty, vinegary tsunami overwhelming the saltiness of the pastrami or the vinegar of the cole slaw. This is a  cucumbery pickle that adds the crunch without the pucker. A bit more dill wouldn't do it any harm, either.\n\nAnd get a slice of babka.  You won't be sorry.\n\nSandwich & sides: $12 Babka $3\n\nWhen they start making egg creams, I'm moving in.", "author": "Der G."}

Neither Russ and Daughters nor Second Ave Deli are close enough to take care of those reuben cravings that hit a couple of times a month.  SF the city with every type of food on planet earth does not have a decent Jewish Deli (or Egyptian Food, but that is a separate rant).  I cannot wait until these lovely boys get a permanent location.\n\nThe cafe they pop-up in is small and lacking of space.  Lines are long, people hover over you while you try to eat and overall it lacks appeal.  Is it worth feeding meters twice, standing in line for 20+ minutes and then waiting for your food?  Holy crap, yes.\n\nSo visit one (sometime in the beginning of February)  my hubby and I (and friends) shared a corned beef sandwich and a reuben sandwich....hands down best reuben ever. The corned beef was moist and flavorful but a little fatty for my taste.  Portions are California size, not NYC size...then again the sandwiches are not 17.50 either.\n\nSecond visit  there was a white fish sandwich on the menu.  OMG, I would have ordered a second if I knew it was going to be so good.  We also ordered another reuben (just as good as the first time) and a pickle plate.  The pickle plate was so good: not just pickles but radishes, beets and onions.

I stumbled upon Wise Sons during my research and I'm sure glad I did.  Tinkerbell was helpful in working w/ me on the menu.  Even though I ordered for 40, I was still a bit nervous about running out of food as some of the reviews on Yelp were that the portions were a bit on the smaller side.  My concerns were unfounded.  There was plenty of food and still a lot leftover from my big party.  Most importantly, my guests said they loved all the food.  Many asked where the food was from and a big testament was that there was a lot of continued noshing (people getting 2nd & 3rds) through the very end.  I ordered the smoked fish platter - the salmon was the first to go but I thought the trout salad was one of my favorites.  The pastrami & corn beef platter was consumed immediately with only the smoked turkey & egg salad sandwiches leftover.  The chopped liver was delicious.  The babka was out of this world - rich chocolate, moist & decadent.  The bagels from Beauty's were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  My guests commented frequently that the bagels were outstanding.  There were a lot of accoutrement that came with all the dishes.  I would cater from Wise Sons again in a heartbeat!  Thanks Wise Sons!!!", "author": "Ha N."}

We had bagels with lox smear, onions, capers, home made pickles and a bunch of other goodies. We also bought a loaf of the fresh rye and a jar of pickled beets. I can't wait to go back to try the pastrami sandwiches. All that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the woman working the front counter was rather rude. When we asked for some knifes she said that they didn't have any even though they were very clearly right behind her and then she watched me wait for about fifteen minutes for the jar of beets.All of the other staff were incredibly welcoming and helpful. I will definitely will come back, but hopefully on a day they have a nicer staff person at the register.", "author": "Alexandra F."}

Wise Sons Delicatessen at the Ferry Building.Two! lines to get your grease soaked container? You first stand in a ridiculous line to place an order - there are only 4 items on the menu, but when you write each order down and calculate total in your head, yeah it does take 20 minutes to place an order. Then you move in into the next line, the pickup line. Fast forward Another! 20 minutes later, your name gets called and if you haven't left by now, you get your food. Think with that wait time it must be worth it? Hardly, all I taste is grease, lots of it. The food is very fatty, seriously not cool to have that much of just beef lard in each slice of pastrami.

Definitely not required but made for an extra OOMPH on the yum-factor. \n\nI had the trout salad sandwich, an unusual choice, but i really liked it. much lighter than the reuben and just as flavorful. \n\nthe hardest part is waiting for your order....but totally worth it", "author": "Christine f."}

YES the pastrami was as good as I'd imagined, (although I tend to like it a little bit leaner). The Ruben I had a bite of also did not disappoint. We are talking about quality house cured meats on delicious rye bread. So simple and so effen good!\nThe potato salad was a bit chunky and toothsome, lightly dressed in a fresh herby dressing. The cole slaw blew my mind- seriously, I'm going to try and duplicate it at home. Straightforward, a little tangy but not too creamy. Awesome! The pickles were pretty fabulous too. \nI didn't care for the black and white cookie, it seemed under-baked and over-sweet. Next time I want to try the potato kugels and the pickle plate (which had carrots, kraut, pickles, beets). Both looked incredible.\nVery freakin' expensive but so worth it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-25", "description": "This is one of those places where I truly, truly wish I could give half stars. I'd give it a solid 3.5, mostly because I'm one of those people who turns my noses up at places getting any less than that when I'm looking for food on yelp and I *liked* Wise Son's. I want it to do well, I just have some constructive crits.\n\nFor any of us paying attention to the Jewish Deli crisis in this city and others, there's a lot of talk about what exactly a Jewish deli is. Much of this is tied up in nostalgia and myths of epic sandwiches the size of your head, never ending metal bowls of pickles, and chicken liver that punches you in the face with it's liver-y-ness (screw you, pate). But at places that serve things like that the quality of the meat, bread, pickles, etc, tends to be so-so. Quantity over quality. Which my cranky old Jewish antielitist-snob dad loves but the foody in me tends to shy away from. The modern Jewish deli seems to be going away from that focus and looking at 1) buying sustainable and local meats/bagels/bread/etc and 2) doing their own foodyness- smoking their own salmon, corning their own beef, baking their own stuff (remember, a lot of this is outsourced out our favorite old-fashioned delis).  All of this drives up prices, unfortunately. \n\nWise son's is clearly a modern Jewish deli and is trying to do both of those things, and they do it very successfully! The corned beef was superb, the smoked trout and salmon amazing, the babka to die for (and those of us who've made it know that it should be slightly dry and the chocolate kind of \"pasty\"- so shut up, haters). But I have two words for Wise son's : Happy Medium. \n\nThe portions were really small, even though it was really delicious. I had the smoked trout on a bagel, for instance (they were out of lox and they offered to sub the trout for it). The bagel was everything a bagel should be- chewy, dense, perfectly full of sesame, kind of sweet in that mouthy chewing way (hooray malt syrup). And the smoked trout was so friggin' good. But it was small. Way smaller than the 11$ I was charged warranted. Guys. I know that you won't loose that much money by making your portions bigger, so please do! And charging for a *tiny* plate of pickles. No. Offer a \"never-ending\" bowl for something cheap (3 bucks, max) and it'll go over huge, I promise.\n\nNow maybe these things will be fixed when they have a proper location and room to spread out. Maybe they'll start having big ol' barrels of pickles at the counter and way more spreads and meats to spread around (they have to make everything beforehand in what I can only imagine is a tiny space or even a home kitchen). I certainly hope so. I'll be going back when they have a permanent location and I hope they find the Happy Medium.", "author": "Carly S."}

The cut was pretty thick as well as heavily peppered which I really though distinguished it from other delis that cut it thinner thereby losing a lot of the texture to the sandwich. The one thing I will say is that if you were judging this place based on service it would definitely be two stars.

The menu looks like it changes from week to week, based on the prior reviews. I tasted several interesting things this week, including an open faced bialy with lox and brisket sandwich. The open faced bialy was solid--good proportion of lox, cream cheese, a few capers, and very thinly sliced red onion. It came with some amazing quick-pickle cucumbers. The brisket sandwich was tasty, but we were looking for more of a sliced brisket sandwich, while this sandwich contained more of a shredded beef--almost pot roast-like brisket.

Also, even though the restaurant is only open for a few hours each time, all the items on the menu aren't available until 11am.
