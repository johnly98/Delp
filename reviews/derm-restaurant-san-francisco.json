However, I've enjoyed Thai food when done really well, and I was really hoping this highly rated restaurant would change my opinion about Thai food.\n\nIn fact, it kinda did the opposite. I found the pumpkin curry to be just weird; reinforcing my view that a sweet sauce with hints of curry is not the way to go. Their Pad Thai was alright, but not the best I've had or anything.", "author": "Albert Z."}

So the place is pretty simple ambience wise, but the food is to die for, specially if you eat non-veg. \n\nIf you are okay to eat what I say, try their duck curry, that's hats off the best thing on their menu. We were eight people and everyone eordered something different , till duck curry was just too good to be not ordered again. Im going back to this place just so that I can have that. \n\nIf you like Tom yum soup flavour then order Tom yum shrimp fried rice, it's soooo good. Their prawns and chicken were on the milder side and could have been more tasteful.\n\nBut overall this place serves good food, the staff is courteous and it's a good place for groups.", "author": "Ramyata M."}

The wait was too long so as we walked back to the car, we decided to try Derm since there were plenty of tables available.  Good thing we went in when we did because about 4 more parties came in right behind us and filled up the place.  \n\nI'm not usually on this side of town, but my husband suggested driving down this way.  Translate - could we please go somewhere new?  I mean, we go to new places all the time, but I guess he meant we stay in the same parts of the city when dining and we really should venture out a bit more.  \n\nThere were a lot of good things on the menu and I was worried I would order it all. I was good though and just ordered a couple of appetizers and entrees.  We started with the roti kang kiew and thoong thong, which I'll admit I was a little embarrassed to pronounce.  I saw the pork special and decided to order that along with the ga prow gai.  The pork was so tender and flavorful.  I liked the ga prow gai, but wish it didn't have so many onions.  The roti and thoong were delicious as well.  \n\nA table near us mentioned they had a lot of dietary restrictions and it seemed like they were able to accomodate them pretty easily.  Service seemed to be a one person show and she nailed it, making sure we got water refilled and plates changed out between appetizers and main dishes.  It took a bit of time for dishes to come out, but I figured it was because they got slammed quickly, as well as several people came by for takeout orders.\n\nI keep this place bookmarked for when I'm looking for Thai in this part of the city.  Definitely a good option for a small or big group.", "author": "Maria S."}

There actually weren't many people here for dinner, but we had a great experience.\n\nService was friendly and quick. The portions are quite large - my friend and I split veggie spring rolls, pad thai with tofu, and panang curry with tofu, and had enough left over for a late night second dinner. Everything was great, but the pad thai did have a slightly fishy taste to it. The panang curry was delicious, with just the right amount of spice and flavor.\n\nThe tofu was my favorite part. Ordering vegetarian meals at Thai restaurants is usually easy, but a lot of places don't put much effort into flavoring their tofu the way they flavor their meat, but Derm really does it right. The fried tofu in the pad thai and the firm tofu in the curry both had a great tangy lemon flavor that went really well with each dish.", "author": "Apoorva A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-08", "description": "Before I write a five star review, I try to eat at the restaurant at least twice just so I know the first time wasn't a fluke. And Derm has passed the test! Dare I say it might be my favorite Thai restaurant in the Bay Area?! I've only tried their lunch offerings and hope to go back for dinner soon. \n\nWhenever I first try out a Thai restaurant, I always get the pad se ew just because it's my favorite. The pad see ew at Derm did not disappoint. Noodles were cooked perfectly. The sauce was not too sweet or too salty. Fresh and large cuts of veggies. And the PORK! The pork was so tender and seasoned so well. Normally, restaurants give you an option for which meat, but the only option they provide is the pork probably because they are that confident about it! Portions are also huge. You can definitely share this dish. \n\nThe Roti with green curry was also fire! Served in a cone with two sauce cups on the side. Points for presentation! A little on the greasy side but the roti is served piping hot and crisp. The green curry has a kick but nothing you can't handle (even me as a non spicy food eater kept dipping because it was such a great pairing). \n\nThe show stopper for me was the papaya salad though. Wow. I haven't had good papaya salad since my days traveling in Southeast Asia. The papaya salad is SO much better than the papaya salad at popular places like Burma superstar or Champa Garden. I don't know how to explain it. It just was the perfect level of tartness and sweetness and vinegar/fish sauceness. Please try the papaya salad and let me know what you think. \n\nThey were also so gracious about menu adjustments. We wanted to get the Pumpkin red curry with tiger prawns and Thai basil but swap it out for the less spicy yellow curry. They were able to do that for us which was so nice. Warning about spice level - their mild is still pretty spicy! \n\nOn my second visit, I tried the Pad Thai. Huge portions again. I love how they have big chunks of eggs and the pieces are not too sodden in the sauce like most places. I'm so appreciative of how fresh their ingredients are. I loved the large cuts of green onion and the extra portion of sprouts on the side to give the dish more crunch. Shrimps (5) are also big ones and thoughtfully deveined. \n\nWe also got the Mu Yang, the marinated BBQ pork. Smokey and so delicious. Jeaw sauce comes with some cilantro in it so if you don't like cilantro you can just pick it out. Also comes with a small side salad pairing of cucumbers, pineapple, and red onions. \n\nBottom line: I highly recommend it. Perhaps I like them so much because it suits my palette (I don't like overly salty or sweet food) and perhaps because each of the dishes transported me back to my favorite spots in Southeast Asia. Just something so right about this place. Hope they keep it up!", "author": "Lisa K."}

The pork ribs that came with the dish were falling of tbe bones albeit salty, just like some reviewers had mentioned. The Mixed Vegetables with tofu was a delight though (added tofu cost extra $2). They used really fresh and healthy ingredients such as Brussels sprouts and broccolis among others. The sauce was light and bursting with fragrance. They used plastic containers for take outs, and that i did not like.  They did not provide napkins or utensils. I actually did not mind the lack of either as I was eating at home.

I appreciate they use some more exotic ingredients that you don't see often like the strange peppercorn-ish bundles in the ribs dish.  But, unfortunately, execution isn't the best...\n\n1. Thai Ice Tea $3:  Didn't get to taste it.\n\n2. Leo, Lager, Thailand $5:  You know, I'd have to say, this was one of the best Asian-style beers I've ever had.  I mean forget the Corona of Japan, Sapporo, or that super shtty Chinese Tsing Tao, the Bud of China... this ain't any of that crap.  There's good body, and good balance.  Some richness.  It's good for what it is.  7/10\n\n3. Roti Kang Kiew $8 \"Fried 'roti' with green curry dipping\":  Never had roti before--it's kinda like Chinese green onion pancakes, but with more layers and thinner, and lighter.  Dare I say, I think I might even like this more than your typical Chinese version!  That curry dipping sauce kinda sucks though--way too thin to be a sauce.  But I guess maybe that's the way it's supposed to be traditionally?, I don't know.  Anyway, love the roti, but overall not that exciting.  5/10\n\n4. Gai Ping $9 \"charcoal grill Thai style marinated chicken's wing w/ dried chili tamarind sauce\":  I LOVE the char on this.  Wow... brings a lot of taste to the chicken.  Unfortunately, I think I prefer steroid stuffed, over vaccinated chicken, cause this stuff must have been on some vegan diet.  Meat's a bit stringy, and pretty dry for dark meat.  Flavor's awesome, but the meat quality just ain't there.  5/10 \n\n5. Ka Na Mu Grob $13 \"wok-fried CRISPY pork belly and Chinese broccoli\":  I was most disappointed with this one.  The description has \"CRISPY\" all in caps, and well, they didn't use the right word here--I think they're more looking for \"HARD SHELLED.\"  Yes, it's fried... so fried that the outside turned into particle board.  Inside isn't juicy either.  The pork was mixed with some healthy green stuff, which helps balance with the fatness.  4/10\n\n6. Ga Prow Ped $15 \"sauteed roast duck in Thai Chili and basil sauce\":  Just had a taste of this.  Not bad.  It's kinda like getting roasted duck from a Chinese market, then stir-frying it over.  But tasty.  6/10\n\n7. Mu Prik Kang $15 \"fall off bone pork spare ribs stir fried w/ green chili paste, rhizome, peppercorn and basil\":  Funny thing is, I actually hate it when meat is literally \"fall off the bone\" so with that being in the description I was prepared for something I may find less than perfect.  To me, if it's actually delaminating from the bone, well, why have the bone?  I like my American-style ribs very tender and juicy, but still grabbing to the bone's surface--that's the perfect doneness.  Anyway..... again, funny thing is....... though I was prepared, it actually was the opposite!--the meat was definitely stuck on, and maybe even under-braised.  Needs to be tenderized far more.  BUT, like I mentioned above, i LOVED the exotic ingredients in this!  They had these weird peppercorn-tasting branches that was kinda like a cross between capers and peppercorn off a grape bundle.  Also had these crunch small eggplants?--I think they're eggplants.  Anyway, one of the few times I'd say I liked the vegetables more than the meat.  6/10\n\nSo......

Would like to see some artwork on the wall. \n\nI wanted the Thai ice tea but they only have cow's milk, no substitute. \n\nNot entirely satisfied but happy with service and distance from home so will come back and try other dishes.", "author": "Alice P."}

I am not much of a dessert person however since it's my first visit here I had to try few things on the menu. Pork belly with Chinese broccoli was very good, a bit salty side however it was savory with brown rice and enjoyed the fresh crunchy Chinese broccoli! \n\nPenang red curry with beef was flavorful and perfect consistency of creamy coconut milk.  A bit sweet but I can tell you that  it was definitely one of few good Thai curry dishes in S.F  Also Beer and wine choices are excellent!  It's a bit high priced Thai food compared to other restaurants near by.  Happy hour drink price would be a bit better appealing if they focus more on the food sale. \n\nI'll be back to try few more things soon.

Well, technically Derm is a little bit outside our hood (we're about 3/4 mile away) but we're totally walking the distance  to make this a regular haunt. Consumed were the following: \n\nGuay tiew lui suan- super fresh, and the dipping sauce a great ginger-y spicy accompaniment. Just the right amount of chew in the rice wrapper, and the veggies were fresh. \n\nTom ka gai soup- this is our standard appetizer when we eat thai food, happy to report Derm's is super delicious. Perfect creamy coconut base with just a hint of tanginess, lots of chicken. \n\nPad see ew- the other yelpers told me this was not to be missed. I'm really glad I ordered it. Too many times at other restaurants, it tastes like the noodles barely spent time getting seared in the pan. Derm's noodles had a delicious char on them with a perfect chew. Good amount of meat and crisp broccoli in there, too. \n\nGa prow gai- really well seasoned. Great over the sticky rice. Meaty!\n\nServers were attentive and very nice.

In a city where people have mostly sworn their allegiance to a Thai restaurant for pick-up, delivery, sit-in, Derm's slightly sophisticated offering of Thai dishes deserves more than a shot: It deserves full-on discovery into the menu.\n\nI went for lunch with my mom so we needed to keep things easy (no cuttlefish). We started off with chicken satay and small \"fried wonton bags\" stuffed with (pork or chicken?) and shrimp. Bother were cooked perfectly: the satay was grilled with a tasty layer of yellow curry on it. The wontons were golden brown.\n\nafter these two delicious dishes, we split the panang curry with slow-cooked beef chuck and peppers. Another score! Panang is one of my favorite curries and Derm does it well. And in a way I had never had it.\n\nTIP: Look at the menu online before you go!

I made a reservation the day before and came by the next day with a group of fourteen. Our table was already prepped upon arrival -- I was impressed by the clean and modern decor, including the fresh seasonal flowers at each table.\n\nThe menu had a lot of options that suited our diverse group -- we had some folks that didn't eat red meat, some that didn't eat fish (including anything with fish sauce), and some that didn't eat too-spicy food. Everyone was satisfied with the availability of choices.\n\nThe group shared the por pia sod (Thai fresh rolls), por pia tod (crispy egg rolls) and the roti jang kiew (crispy fried flatbread) to share. We enjoyed everything but I would definitely order the por pia sod again -- the sauce on top was great. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the Pad Ke Mao which was quite good but a LOT of food for one person. I ended up eating half of it and taking the rest to go for lunch the next day. Not a super smart move given that the rice noodles got clumpy and had an undesirable texture when re-heated. I would recommend splitting one order for two people and just eating it all on-site.\n\nService was a bit slow but that was likely because there was only one server for the whole restaurant. Additionally, our meals didn't exactly come near-in-time to one another. I estimate that there was a gap of about twenty minutes between when the first entree came out and the last entree arrived. This made for a bit of awkward timing as some were nearly done with their food by the time others just started eating.\n\nI'll be back to try them for dinner.

Our table of four ended up being all around pleased with the quality of the food and the pleasant service.

I appreciated that Derm had a nice menu offering that goes beyond the typical pad thai dishes, while still being friendly to those that don't want to delve too far from the norm. We really enjoyed the Ka Na Mu Grob (pork belly and Chinese broccoli dish), pad see-ew, and house special panang curry.  All of the dishes were tasty and definitely a step above the typical Thai I've encountered at other restaurants of this style and price point. The woman helping us was very attentive and helpful throughout the meal, even checking on us to see how we liked a specific dish since she said some customers may find it too spicy. The spice factor tended to follow the \"American\" scale in that it wasn't too spicy. If you can handle more spice, definitely let them know and I'm sure they can accommodate you.

This is the best Thai food in SF now. I love that they think carefully about their flavors and don't just list curries or dishes with choice of 5 meats/fish/tofu, but only use the one which is the culinary match to the sauce. I've been twice now, and can't wait to keep going back to try more. For dessert, the owner makes a coconut cake and the sweet crunchy dessert roti's are addictive. They also carry 4 -5 unique beers on tap, including local breweries. The atmosphere is not great, but it is clean and easy to have conversations!", "author": "Bea L."}

The Pad Thai was excellent and the red curry Kang Daeng Pak was over the top. We started with the shrimp rice wrap and added wok tossed Brussel Sprouts with garlic.  Great location and easy area parking if needed.  Strong recommendation for dinner or take out.", "author": "GREG C."}

The spices and flavorings meld together really well.  The place isn't fancy but the food was outstanding. I will definitely come back and eat in next time. A winner in my book and I'm very particular.", "author": "Irene S."}

She had the roast pork belly with Chinese broccoli and I had the sauteed duck, both were great.  They gave us a complimentary slice of Thai iced tea cake which was delicious -- moist, good flavor and not too sweet.  Service was excellent.  We'll definitely be back.", "author": "David C."}

The stand outs were the salad with the rice balls, grilled squid, crab fried rice and pad see yew. The chef that made the fried rice has some skills.  The dish was perfectly made.  Derm will be our new go to restaurant for Thai food.", "author": "c v."}

My boys say we always eat Italian so searched on Yelp for a Thai restaurant near their place and Derm popped up. A new restaurant with very good reviews so a reservation was made.  We started with chicken satay and fresh shrimp rolls.  Both were very tasty and gone quickly.  We also had the ribs, brussel sprouts, tofu and eggplant dish, pad thai and a thicker noodle chicken dish with two bowls of brown rice.  This was sufficient for five of us and there were no leftovers.  All of our dishes were flavorful and plentiful.  The service was very quick.  The price of dinner.....$126 for a party of five with one beer and one glass of wine.  Would definitely return.", "author": "Kathy T."}

I can get a bit noisy so when I return, it will be for lunch or early dinner. I had the pad Thai and really enjoyed it. Would definitely order it again.  My dining companion had one of the curries (I can't remember which one) which was tasty but a little spicy for me. She loved it.", "author": "Jamie K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-31", "description": "Food was almost OK, the service was mediocre at best. I was lured to this place by very good reviews on Yelp, but the reality turned to be not so bright - the waitress barely paid attention to our party and brought the ordered tea when we finished cake. In a few hours, half of the guests informed of some weird food allergies they had due to the strange ingredients used by the cooks. Will never come to this place again...", "author": "Alexander L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-16", "description": "This neighborhood Thai restaurant was a delightful surprise when we ate dinner there last night.  Service was very attentive, even as the tables began to fill.  Food choices are interesting, and we really enjoyed an amazing sweet corn appetizer, the special short ribs preparations (in a lovely curry sauce, and the meat was tender and not at all fatty) and a tofu curry dish.  There are nice beer selections, too.  I'm excited because the food is well prepared, the menu choices are varied and the prices are reasonable.  Glad to have this choice in the neighborhood.", "author": "Bonnie L."}
