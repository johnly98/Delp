The place is a very small but super cozy restaurant, makes you feel like you are in Italy somewhere. \n\nEveryone in the kitchen speaks Italian and or Spanish and they are a busy kitchen, hustling to bring out amazing food to the tables. \n\nI attended a private event and I was glad that the only decision I had to make was to choose a protein or main course and dessert if any! By the way, I ordered both. And this was a true Italian feast. \n\nFor appetizers we had crostini with mushrooms, a delicious and super light arugula salad with fresh burrata, a nice caprese salad and grilled calamari with white beans! By now I could barely move on to the pasta course, which consisted of two choices of home made pasta... by now I was in foodie heaven! But they took it even a step further and had an amazing portion of fish with grilled veggies. \n\nFor dessert we all shared the tiramisu and the pera. Which was by far my favorite. The pear was nicely poached soaked in syrup and served with a side of pear granita or chilled pur\u00e9e. It was be perfect combination of warm and cold elements, as well as sweet and spicy in a very cohesive way.\n\nWe closed the night with a nice cappuccino. A super memorable experience of high quality Italian cuisine in San Francisco!", "author": "Gabriela K."}

Charming and cozy interior with gracious staff and most importantly delicious food featuring homemade pastas. We started with an instalata Romana and Fragole and bruschetta. Vine ripened tomatoes and fresh burrata, delicious. We moved on to fettuccine al sugo and fettuccine with crean sauce and sausage both were so good we asked for bread to sop up the sauce. I'm Sicilian and no one beats my moms sauce. But they have (don't tell my mom ). Pair your entree with their excellent selection of Italian reds.

Food is still solid. Ambiance is still warm and cozy. Service is friendly and personal ( if they know you omg...its muwah muwah muwah from Aldo!)\n\nGreat fresh fish dishes that are prepared simply. All pastas are made in house with sauces that are made from scratch.\n\nIf I were to really plead to you to try one dish it would be that amazing Lasagna ( served only on the weekends I believe). It is made of these intricate thin layers of pasta, with a bechamel, cheese, and tomatoes...it could be one of the best out there.\n\nSmall dessert offerings but all are very good. The Tiramisu is very good ( thank you Aldo for the birthday surprise!)\n\nLovely simple salads.\n\nA simple wine list that presents mostly Italian wines and some Californian  as well.\n\nParking is insane around here but they have an arraignment with parking near by.\n\nAbbondanza !!!!!!", "author": "David G."}

My partner took me here on our Friday date night and I was absolutely swooning.\n\nThe restaurant is tucked away in Russian Hill/ Nob Hill right off of Hyde. The quaint restaurant is cozy and warm. Walking in, we were greeted right away with smiles and we chose to sit on the mezzanine (great choice). We ordered wine, ate some yummy bread (their olive oil is out of this world), split the Burrata, and then got to the good stuff: homemade pasta!\n\nThe Burrata appetizer was delish. I love Burrata, no restaurant can screw that up! For the main course,  I ordered Fettucine alla Ghiotta ($19) and my man decided on the Amatriciana with Rigatoni ($19?). Damn that pasta is FRESH! If you want some good homemade pasta, you have to try this spot. My partner described the flavor as umami- it really did touch all of our taste buds. My ONLY complaint was that the cream sauce on my pasta was pretty heavy. I felt quite bloated after eating it. I usually don't order cream sauce pastas for that reason. It was still delicious.\n\nThe service was also a highlight. Everyone was so sweet! Our favorite was the busboy that evening. I wish I had gotten his name, he was a star (and really funny). They were super on it and made us feel very special.", "author": "Hannah S."}

My husband and I have been wanting to come here for a while since we live so close, but the restaurant is small, and was always at 100% capacity whenever we stopped by. Luckily, we were able to get in last night. I highly recommend making reservations here because if you walk in without one, you'll most likely be waiting an hour or so.\n\nService was very friendly and accommodating. Our server was from Pisa, Italy which made the experience feel even more authentic. They also allow you to bring your own bottle of wine ($25) which we really liked. The menu is not big, but not small either. They offer the perfect amount of dishes and it was actually hard for us to choose because everything looked so good! They also offer specials as well. \n\nMy husband and I started with the Verdure alla Griglia (grilled vegetables with shallots and balsamic dressing). The portion size was just right for the two of us and we appreciated the different assortment of vegetables on the plate. We loved the grilled/charred flavor and the balsamic dressing was very tasty!\n\nHowever, our minds were blown over their pastas! We shared the Fettucine al Sugo di Carne alla Milanese (housemade fettucine with Milanese meat sauce) and the Capelli d'Angelo al Filetto di Pomodoro (housemade angel hair pasta, fresh tomatoes, olive oil, garlic). The pastas are all made in house and the dishes tasted AUTHENTIC. What I loved the most about the angel hair pasta was that the tomatoes tasted so fresh and the dish was very saucy which is my favorite.\n\nThis is honestly the best Italian food I have ever had after coming back from Italy a few months ago.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-19", "description": "Ristorante Milano. This review is beyond overdue and after coming here on several separate occasions, you were absolutely fabulous down to the last detail, and I absolutely just can't rave about how much I absolutely adore you. \n\nI had come here on a whim with a date based off of recommendations from many others here on Yelp and had booked reservations with them online before, which I would highly recommend as it is a very popular restaurant. When I had arrived, though it was packed, I had reserved through Opentable, which I'd recommend. However, regardless if you wait or make a reservation online, the food is most certainly worth the wait. The owner, Aldo was extremely sweet and was really helpful when it came to suggestions and did his best to make sure we were comfortable and at ease. The hospitality was very sweet and as receiving as well.\n\nThe atmosphere was very intimate. Candlelit and with a flower in the middle of the table, it was certainly dim but romantic. A wonderful recommendation to take someone on a date.\n\n(I will also note that their bathroom is tiny, it's virtually a closet right next to the wines. It's actually verging on too small, but you come to this establishment to dine, not for the bathroom though, right?)\n\nWe had started off with an order of the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa based off of the recommendations of many fellow Yelpers, and we absolutely didn't regret it at all. By far, hands down one of the best pastas I've ever had the pleasure to consume. The light, housemade pasta in a light, creamy sauce, infused with their porcini mushrooms and Italian sausage were both creamy and gave a nice earthy flavor to the dish.\n\nWe also had ordered the Gnocchi con Salsa Aurora, which was also amazing, though I still preferred the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa over the Gnocchi. Though the gnocchi was delicious, the creamy tomato and cheese melting in my mouth with every bite, I also noted it was a little cold when it was served to us.\n\nWe then decided to end the meal on the Tiramisu, which was absolutely perfect. The Tiramisu was fluffy and with a nice coffee flavor infused in the cake itself. The top was dashed in cocoa powder. Although I never thought I was really a fan of Tirimisu, I'd have to recommend the Tirimisu here. It's probably one of the best Tirimisu's I've eaten. \n\nI also had a glass of their Rose, which paired nicely with the pasta we ordered.\n\nFor my personal experiences, I've had a couple of issues personally booking special requests and making reservations,  though I don't want to take away from how wonderful the restaurant is, and to be fair, the errors were quickly amended to. The times where I had booked or had made a reservation in advance, I had made special requests, and these errors were made \n. - The first time I made a special request, it was my male companion's birthday. I had asked to have a special birthday dessert made for them, but to my horror on the day of, it was instead presented to the couple seated next to us instead who also had coincidentally the same name as I did when I made the request. When the couple next to us had denied that it was theirs/ it was not a special occasion for them, the waitress instead of taking back the dessert gave it to them on the house, while I sat in shock watching my surprise for my friend to be ruined. \n\nTo be fair though, I think after having someone watching my horror from behind the kitchen, it was made up with a tiramisu, by the same person who had made the error to the couple next to me, so it was sweet of them to make up for it (even though we were still charged for the error, sadly :(   )\n\nThe second time I had a minor issue with the service was when I had booked a table well in advance of a couple of days before dining here, and when I showed up to my dismay, at the time I had reserved it for (late night at around 6-7) there was no seating really available despite I had booked in advanced on Opentable. (It was a full house when me and my other companion had arrived). However, my server graciously let us go next and move past the other people who were waiting in line outside.\n\nOverall I would still rate Milano a very high middle 4 leaning to a 5, the only thing not pushing it to a 5 for me would be my prior experiences booking things in advance, and the higher price tag. I strongly believe that if you come here, you won't be disappointed at all whatsoever and that you'll love this entire place to pieces from the hospitality down to the food. I have and will continue to recommend Ristorante Milano.", "author": "Allison O."}

Both delicious, quality Italian food and top-notch professional service.  After seeing the other yelp reviews, I gave this restaurant a try and was not disappointed.  I started off with one of the special salads that had strawberries and also tried the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa, which had fresh made pasta with mushrooms and sausage in a cream sauce.  The pasta was cooked perfectly and still had that slightly stretchy and chewy feel, and the sauce had a nice mild taste which was offset by the mushrooms/sausage.   They also had a solid Italian wine selection, I went with the Montepulciano, which was very good.  \n\nAs to service, when I arrived, my table wasn't ready yet even though I had a reservation.  It seemed like they were very busy at right around the time I arrived.  The hostess who greeted me was very nice and let me know my table was almost ready.  It ended up taking a while, and there wasn't really a waiting area, so I just stood near the inside of the doorway.  However I have nothing bad to say about the service, they were very apologetic and professional and as soon as a table opened up, I was quickly seated.  They even provided a complimentary wine for the inconvenience, which says a lot about how they value their customers.

But tonight, Valentine's Day, was one the most humorous and one of the more slightly disappointing dining experiences I've had. \n\nI ordered the Gnocchi Aurora- which on the menu states gnocchi, gorgonzola, and tomatoes. The sauce on a regular basis had been very creamy, rich, and packed with flavor. It was the regular choice and my go to order any time that I came here. I guess recently, they started to add a blue cheese topping that is not stated on the menu. Personally, I am not a picky eater whatsoever- but blue cheese is one of those things that bring my mouth to the verge of death and despair. \nSo with that being said, they brought the dish out which had a vastly large amount of blue cheese crumbles on it- I tried to pick it off and had a bite just to try, but honestly couldn't take it. I was craving that gnocchi dish I had from the Milano I always knew. So hesitantly, I told them that I was very sorry and couldn't eat this dish due to the blue cheese. They happily brought me another gnocchi- now this is where it gets a little funny. A miscommunication or misunderstanding perhaps. \n\nInstead of bringing a gnocchi with no blue cheese, they brought a gnocchi with no cheese or cream at all. Just gnocchi with red sauce. I laughed, but at this point was so hungry- I couldn't bother them anymore for a third dish of what I was asking for. \n\nMoral of the story is- make sure to specify very clearly what you want or else you get a pasta dish made for lactose and tolerant people; noodle and red sauce. \n\nOutside of the gnocchi- the biratta with fennel was amazing as always. The staff are so friendly and the owner is always there making sure your meal is going swell.

The food is very good, the ambiance cozy, although parking is tricky -- we ended up parking a couple blocks away for $10.\n\nWe had reservations for a Saturday at 7pm, and were promptly seated shortly after we arrived on time. The restaurant is very busy, at least on the Saturday night that we were there, so reservations are recommended. Other diners who showed up without reservations had to wait awhile.\n\nWe started off the meal with the Calamari ala Griglia, which is a tasty grilled squid and white bean salad. It was very pleasant, and was a lighter alternative to the ubiquitous fried calamari that one finds at other Italian restaurants.  We also had a green salad with persimmons and gorgonzola, which paired well with the calamari.\n\nFor mains, we had the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare, which was a tomato based seafood pasta, and the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa which was a porcini mushroom, italian sausage, and cream pasta. The fruitti di mare was delicious, and the tonnarelli was amazing -- super mushroomy and rich, although quite heavy with the cream. \n\nThe service was very friendly and attentive, and I look forward to dining here again.", "author": "Allen T."}

It started with a very warm welcome from the staff.\nI arrived first and requested a table in the back which is up a few stairs snd has the feeling of a loft. This restaurant is always full and is on the noisy side so it was nice to be a little bit separated from the main part of the restaurant. There are also a few tables out in front along side the front  window that are probably quieter but feel more apart from the restaurant.\n\nWhile waiting for my Son to arrive I spoke to the man sitting next to me. I asked him what he was eating and found out that he was an investor in the restaurant. He was very happy to make suggestions on the menu. What intrigued me was the pasta dish he was eating. It was one of the daily specials, a  beet ravioli in brown butter sauce. He sang it's praises.\n\nWe did indeed order the beet ravioli and it was divine beyond belief.luscious melt in your mouth pillows of pleasure. Beautiful to look at and even better to eat.\n\nBut first we started with the grilled vegetables and a balsamic dressing which were nothing short of magnificent.The zucchini and eggplant were so tender, the dressing perfect.\n\nMy son had a glass of the Sangiovese wine and I had the Multipulciano. Italian wines are wonderful here and reasonably priced. Be sure to try them.\n\nNext we had the grilled  calamari with  with cannellini beans. This too was terrific. I have been to this restaurant once before and this is the dish  I came back for. I was not disappointed. It's great to have calamari that's not fried grilling adds so much flavor and this restaurant knows how to grill.\n\nWe shared the rosemary grilled veal chop it was perfectly charred and delicious accompanied by very tasty vegetables.\n\nWe were full but couldn't pass up the tiramisu, a dish the restaurant is known for. It was superb! Bittersweet cacao  powder is dusted around the outside, moist sweetness on the inside. It is the perfect blending of flavors.\n\nThe only downside to this restaurant is the noise level. There were times I had to cup my ear to hear my son and this was on a Thursday night.  there's one more thing that didn't work - the bread. It is mediocre, just skip it. Street parking is impossible pay $10 to park in the Jug Shop parking lot on Polk and Pacific and walk two short blocks up to the restaurant.\n\nEvery dish we had was perfect this is a don't miss restaurant. Once you go here you will want to come back again and again. Dinner for two was $150.", "author": "Mary S."}

There's a plethora of these kinds of little neighborhood Italian spots in San Francisco, but not all of them are delicious and authentic.\n\nThe folks here are authentic Italians from Italy - so it was a pleasure to speak with them in Italian!\n\nThe space is fairly small but well designed -I like the small tables by the windows out front- lovely ambiance that captures plenty of natural lighting! The interior tables are in the more dimly-lit dining room but can accommodate larger groups (6-8 people).\n\nWe ordered Calamari alla Griglia - $15, Insalata Romana - $12, Crostini with Mozzarella, and shared a seafood risotto. The risotto was delicious and better than the one at Venticello's for sure.\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of Tuscan wine for $37.

On our most recent visit, we ordered the crostini ai funghi, and burrata with arugula and fennel to start; and the tonnarelli alla capricciosa and the lasagna special as main dishes. The tonnarelli alla capricciosa (my entree) was so delicious, rich, creamy and tender that I didn't want to stop eating (even when I started getting full). Supposedly this is one of their most popular entries. For desert, we ordered the Pera Cotta al Marsala and the Tiramisu; both were delightful.

My dad declared his lasagna the best he's ever had, and my mom and I both swooned over our tonnarelli with cream & sausage and fettuccine with cream and tomatoes. The pasta was perfectly tender and each dish perfectly portioned. We also were pleasantly surprised to snag great bottle of Chianti from the wine list for under $40. The only downside was it was VERY cozy - I couldn't back my chair up as far as I liked because the tables were so close together, and waiters had to take turns passing with plates.

It gives you the feeling that you are in a romantic little restaurant that is made especially for you and your date. \n\nService: Service is great here. I made a reservation a week before the date I would be coming in and my table was ready as soon as I arrived. Although I do wish I was seated in the main room that is right in the front, that room seems to be for parties of 4 or greater. I was seated in a room to the side of it that was slightly smaller, but being seated near the window was a nice touch. Our server was very kind and came back multiple times to offer us more bread, ask us about the food, and take care of our every need. He didn't rush us at all, which was nice and we felt relaxed the whole time we were there. \n\nFood: We got the gnocchi in the tomato sauce and a butter nut squash ravioli plate. The gnocchi was fantastic--it was just heavy enough, the tomato sauces was nice and creamy, and together, they tasted divine. However, the butternut squash ravioli sauce was a little sweet for my taste. Regardless, the ravioli was cooked really well and the vegetables that it came with were fresh and tasty. \n\nDrinks: We ordered a sparking pink wine, which was refreshing and really good with our dinner!\n\nWarning: The only complaint I had was that there was literally NO parking nearby, so make sure you realize that before making plans. We had to park in a garage and walk almost 20 minutes (some parts uphill) to finally get to the restaurant.\n\nVerdict: I will definitely be returning for another special occasion! Great service, flavorful food, and an adorable restaurant.", "author": "Anu P."}

An authentic ambience that feels like Italy. The grilled local sardines over arugula were highly recommended as unique and delicious. Amazing, really. A hearts of romaine salad and a beautiful chilled white wine paired beautifully. The gorgeous and attentive waitress selected wonderful wines for each course. By 7p, a line spilled out the door. The owner graciously visited with patrons throughout the night. A bus boy took fallen napkins from the floor and offered fresh linens to patrons before they'd even noticed. The handmade gnocchi with gorgonzola and fresh tomato were tiny pillows from heaven. And the paper thin veal scallopine was dressed with lemon and offered clean and fresh flavors. With no plans for dessert, minds changed with news of the daily special: profiteroles. When you die and go to heaven, this is the meal served ... \n\nNote: Ask about parking when you make reservations or, better yet, take a taxi.", "author": "Phoebe W."}

I can't wait to go back the next time I am in The City.\n\nWhile staying at our hotel in the Union Square area, we were fretting over where to have dinner. After much Yelping, we settled on Italian and the reviews led us to Milano. Thankfully, they are on Open Table, so we scored a 6pm reservation and grabbed a cab to Hyde and Pacific.\n\nWe were one of the first patrons of the evening and our friendly, authentic Italian server took great care of us. She explained the menu with patience and all our choices were good ones.\n\nI had the Fettucine al Sugo di Carne alla Milanese...basically, pasta with meat sauce. The pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection and the sauce was zesty and a little acidic with a decent amount of meat. My daughter and wife were also happy with their pasta.

There's little space for waiting around.\n\nWe scoped out the menu ahead of time on their website, and knew what we each wanted to get way in advance of arriving at the restaurant. However, nowhere on the site did it say their menu rotated per day, which is what our server told us. Myself being a picky eater, I only had a few things in mind that I wanted, none of which were listed as being offered that day. We asked our waiter to check with the cook if a pasta that wasn't on that day's menu could be made, and they accommodated us without hesitation. Our food was very good, and the waiter was very nice.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that they seemed a bit under-staffed for a Monday night, with only two servers going around to ALL of the tables in the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-09", "description": "I ended up at Ristorante Milano as part of a business dinner for a group of 6 weeks ago.  The seating is a little cramped, but the restaurant is bigger than it appears from the outside.  It was a wine maker night, so they had a few wines by the Fossacolle winery featured and had the winemaker there too.  We ordered so much of the Rosso di Montalcino that they gave us all a pour of another wine with dessert.  I'm not a red drinker, but the Rosso was mild enough for me to ask for a little more!\n\nFor starters we got the bruschetta, beet salad and grilled calamari.  I'm not a fan of calamari or beets so I just stuck with the bruschetta.  It was different as it looked and kinda tasted like a sweet potato topping with burrata.  It was really good though and a hearty slice.  I also liked the herb soft bread they used for the breadbasket.  For my main I actually ordered a special on the wine night special menu which was a truffle taglitelle.  There was a little bit of shaved truffles ontop, cheese and a truffle butter sauce.  My waiter warned me that it was a smaller appetizer size, but it was still a very good portion, as I took some home to share with him.  I was getting full, but one of my coworkers and I decided to split dessert.  We shared the Torta Caprese: Warm, dark belgian chocolate almond cake, shaved almonds and cream.  Loved the contrast of hot and cold.  It was a nice chocolatey cake, that wasn't overly rich or too heavy.  Everyone else seemed to love their entrees and desserts too.  \n\nI always get pasta at an Italian restaurant because 1. I love noodles & 2. My dad always told me that you can determine whether or not an Italian restaurant is good based on their pasta.  I loved my truffle pasta, but wish it was a permanent item on the menu.  Honestly though, a lot of the pasta dishes on the menu seem pretty ordinary, as a lot of them are sausage or meat sauced based.  This is one reason why I am giving them a 3.5.   Ristorante Milano is not a destination place in SF as there are better Italian restaurants in SF in my opinion (i.e. Allegro Romano, if you can get a reservation & Vicoletto).   I am rounding up because the food and wine were solid and because the service was excellent, though a 3.5 is appropriate.  Yelp please allow us to do half stars one day!", "author": "Cat C."}

The restaurant is located in the middle of an otherwise residential block of Pacific Avenue in Nob Hill. It's right off the Hyde St. Cable Car which makes for an incredible way to start or end your evening.\n\nMy wife and I started dating in college and within three months she moved to Italy. We traveled there together while she was abroad and fell in love with the food. We returned to Italy for our honeymoon so that we could relive all of it again. We haven't been back to Italy in 7 years, but Ristorante Milano has been our portal to experience the flavors the way we remember. \n\nThe food alone does not make for a meal. From the moment the owner swings opens the door to welcome you in with a \"Buena Cera\", you will know how special this place is. The staff compliments the dining experience with their authentic accents and witty charm.\n\nWe have had so many experiences here, from our first meal on my 24th Birthday, a few meetings of our families, Valentines dates, every Christmas Eve and so many anniversaries. \n\nTo start the meal, we always opt for one of their bruschettas. We were happily surprised with a squash rendition that we had never imagined would taste so good. We'll often opt to order their pan seared calamari as well. Or, if we want something crisp, we'll choose the arugula and fresh burrata salad or sweet red and golden beet salad, both leave you wanting more.\n\nOnce we've started teasing our appetites with the complimentary oil dipped focaccia, my wife usually indulges her taste buds with the creamiest Gorgonzola gnocchi, instantly transporting her back to Florence. I usually insist on dining on Mondays so that I can take advantage of their daily special, the dish I care about most in San Francisco. Their version of a braised lamb shank is completely traditional, slow cooked in stewed tomatoes until it's just about to fall off the bone. It's served over a delicate layer of creamy polenta so that every bite of this dish ends up deserving its own moment of silence. Pairing it with a classic Chianti makes everything complete.\n\nThe dessert menu is unfortunately unchanging and so we either go for the classic Tiramisu or the unusual Marsala wine soaked pears with a scoop of their home made vanilla bean ice cream.\n\nThe place is small, so I am hesitant to let this secret out, but I feel like being generous and so I want others to know how good dinner really can be.

He was searching online and asking me what I wanted for dinner and I told him to just surprise me. He did a wonderful job and Ristorante Milano was great! My BF did call and make a reservation for 8:30pm on Wednesday however we arrived a little after 9pm. It wasn't a issue at all because there was no wait and we were sat right away. It's nice that the restaurant closes late. The place is very small with a warm and inviting feel. The decor is simple and elegant with nice heavy sliverware and I like the small festive Christmas tree on every table. One thing that I really loved is they offer you sparking water! Every restaurant offers water, some even give you a lemon but I love sparking water so that fact that Ristorante Milano offers this (with no extra charge) was a plus. The bread and oil wasn't my favorite. I thought that the oil was going to be flavored like the California Pizza Kitchen oil and bread and it wasn't. It lacked flavor however our meals did not! I ordered the linguine with fresh shellfish and it was out of this world! One of the best dishes I ever had! It was just bursting with flavor with every bite and a good mix of each shellfish. My friend ordered the mix of grilled chicken, lamb, and sausage served with green beans and potatoes. I tasted his and it also was flavored well and very good! The portions are just right. We ate it all and opted out for dessert however I was pleasantly surprised when the server brought out a few cookies for us to enjoy. They were hard cookies and I like soft so I wasn't a fan but my friend liked them. \n\nThere were a couple things that really stood out for me that the staff did to wow me. First, after we finished our dinner, I moved because I wanted to sit next to my friend as we ate the cookies. When the server noticed that, he came and turned the table for us. He didn't have to do that it was fine how it was but he just wanted to make us feel comfortable I guess and that was appreciated. Secondly, the  servers always pour the water for you. It's on the table and you can easily grab it and pour it your self but they always were right there to do it.

In any case, it was still good.\n\nWHEN I come back, I would suggest the Tonnarelli all a Capricciosa.  It has mushrooms + sausage, and it is SUPER creamy.  The flavor is very mushroomy, so be prepared for that!  I love mushrooms, which is why I really enjoyed this.\n\nThe reason I like their pasta so much is because\n1) the pasta itself is SO GOOD.  it's the perfect consistency, and it retains their sauces very well.\n2) the sauce to pasta ratio is perfect.  they complement each other very well, and like i said, the sauce actually sticks onto the pasta, so you're not getting random bites of flavorless or flavorful pasta.\n\nDownside?  The wait is AWFUL.  Our reservations were for 9:00, but we still had to wait a while because the table they had anticipated finishing up was taking a bit.  The place is small, but pretty romantic.  Very SF :)  Anddddddd... it's also kind of hot inside.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

We met up with my fianc\u00e9's good friend from college and they are both from Italian families. The restaurant is located in charming nob hill and has a quaint atmosphere.\n\nFor apps, we ordered the grilled calamari with white beans and a squash bruschetta. Both appetizers were delicious. It's great to have calamari on a menu that's not always breaded and deep fried. Very similar to what you would see in Europe. The butternut squash bruschetta was a great twist on the traditional due to season, so the flavors were perfect for the weather. I loved that the portions were large, bread slices were toasted well (crunchy and yet still doughy) and had large slices of buffalo mozzarella on top.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered the traditional house-made fettuccine with meat sauce. The pasta was a little too thick for being fresh made but the sauce was good. My fianc\u00e9's gnocchi was the dinner choice hit. Go there for he gnocchi!! We then all split the tiramisu and I wished we ordered individuals.\n\nAnd of course, the olive oil was rich and tangy. Delish!!", "author": "Theresa N."}

Aldo's a good friend of my sushi chef pal Fujita-san and quite the accommodating proprietor.  \nService is quite good, and we started with the calamari and white beans plus the highly rated chicken livers with bacon, etc. on a skewer.  Those chicken livers are the bomb - must order!  Calamari was quite tender and we ordered the featured white and red wine of the night to accompany.\nFood server recommended the swordfish, the featured seafood of the night and she had the sausage and cheese ravioli, also the pasta of the day.  Both were superb.  I gave her almost half of my swordfish and received a single ravioli in return but it was her birthday so whatever but boy was it good!  \nConcluded with the tiramisu for her and I had the expresso ice which was quite good.  We brought some of the tiramisu home and I ate it later that night.  Everything was rather good and I would have gone 5 stars but I told them it was her birthday and neglected to get candles for her birthday cake earlier in the day so I was in hopes that they would at least put a candle on something so she would have the official birthday cake candle wish blow (I did light my lighter earlier in the day when we had the coffee crunch cake from Japantown with group but it's not an official candle so ...) but Aldo did give us a table for 4 so we had lots of room to spread out despite the Friday night crowd.\nFoods great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-30", "description": "Ristorante Milano has remained in the neighborhood for many years, since my childhood, which is a testament to the quality of their food.  While many restaurants in the area have come and gone, Milano has undergone changes to the menu, facelifts, and other adjustments, but still there always seems to be at least a semi-full dining room when I dine there, and the food has always been excellent throughout the years.\n\nThe restaurant has a relatively small capacity, and reservations are recommended but not always needed.  The place is cute and a bit unique in it's configuration, featuring a ground level dining room, a small 'street-side' dining space, and a slightly elevated dining space above the main floor.  Total capacity may be around 50 patrons...\n\nThe menu seems to have undergone a bit of a transformation- or a reduction in selection to be more accurate.  This seems like a tactical move- although my most recent previous visit was months ago- there seemed to be a lot more selection at that time.  However- I like a more restricted menu where a restaurant really focuses on their 'best items' rather than slews of mediocre items to please the masses.  There are probably 7-8 appetizers, 7-8 pastas, and 7-8 entrees (meat/poultry/seafood), and a couple of nightly specials.  Really a fair number of items to choose from without being overwhelmed. \n\nOn our latest meal several nights ago, we dined on their bruschetta- very tasty but overpriced at two slices for $10, their Tuna carpaccio- FABULOUS and generous in its portion size- a MUST order for me when I return.  My wife enjoyed their gnocchi w/ pancetta and mushrooms, and I consumed their house-made ravioli of the day which was a delicious gorgonzola and sausage mixture.  All of this + a glass of wine and tip combined for $93.  I left feeling that the meal was a tad on the expensive side- but it was really excellent top to bottom, and in reality- I'd probably pay about the same for a lesser meal at most other Italian restaurants that I visit.\n\nIn summary, Ristorante Milano is a consistent, intimate, and special little restaurant which I am lucky to live very near to.  I will be back again and again, and highly recommend this neighborhood gem for a great dining experience.", "author": "Andy S."}

What's he going to do about it anyways?  He's a kid and you're a grown-ass man.\n\nWe had the anchovies as an appetizer, the seafood linguine and the fish special for entrees, and a chocolate cake for dessert.  The anchovies were light and subtly flavored.  The seafood linguine was a monstrously sized dish that was beautifully seasoned and overflowing with clams, mussels, and shrimp.

(You let me down fellow Yelpers.) \n\nI made a 7:00 reservation for a friend and I on Friday night. First of all, this restaurants location is a little strange. Only 2 blocks off Polk, in a residential district, it feels a little out of place- but I can dig it. Anywho, an older gentleman (owner?) Told us we'd be seated as soon as he had a table available. (I'm sorry- but doesn't this void the whole point of a reservation?) Anywho- we didn't wait too long- but I was a little surprised a table wasn't available.\n\nThe restaurant is quaint and cozy- and the layout is a little strange. We were seated in the upstairs portion (4 tables total) and enjoyed people watching from our little corner.\n\nOur server, although friendly, was SLOW. We waited quite awhile for our meals (but very much enjoyed the wine!) My girlfriend ordered the Tornatelli with Sausage and Mushrooms- I ordered the Saltimbocca. Let's review, shall we?\n\nPASTA: Her dish, although described as \"lightly creamed\" was anything but light. She described it as being \"covered in Campbell's cream of Mushroom soup.\" I tried a bite, and felt it severely lacked flavor. The crumbled sausage was kinda a joke- and didn't add a whole lot to the dish. \n\nCHICKEN: The greens with this dish were delicious- as were the mashed potatoes. But the dish, in it's entirety, was a salty, oily mess. Although flavorful, I couldn't get over the oil that floated on my plate.\n\nThe bread was delicious and soft- and the rosemary olive oil was  a great accompaniment (but I couldn't taste the rosemary!)\n\nAt the end of the night it was apparent something was burning in the kitchen- and a smoky haze hung over the place the rest of the time we were there.\n\nIt did the job- but the experience, as a whole, was a little lack-luster.", "author": "Annalise F."}

My friends and i had dealt with some major traffic/parking/reservation stress and were starving and desperate for a place to eat. We swerved into the first parking spot we saw and called the nearest restaurant to see if they could accomodate us.

My other friends ordered the Linguine ai Frutti di mare (thus breaking the no double ordering rule). \n\nThe first thing that you notice is the very high quality of the handmade pasta. It really brings any pasta dish to a whole other level. I'd say the best dish was in fact the tonnarelli was the best dish of the bunch, though they were all super tasty. It comes with what they describe as a light cream sauce, though after a while it does start to feel pretty heavy. It was ok with me as I was allowed to slurp up my friend's leftovers! As for my selection, I usually like a more hearty lasagna, with big crusty cheesey corners, and this one was a bit more refined.

It's so easy to make mediocre pizza and pasta, and many Italian restaurants can dand do, so it takes quite a bit to get me excited--especially because I've been spoiled by Boston's amazing Italian food.\n\nThe server was friendly and gracious. He ran us through a number of specials that weren't on the menu.\n\nI started with a beet, green bean and orange salad. The produce was impeccable and nicely dressed. On to another special, the butternut squash risotto with sage. I have never had risotto this good! Without any dairy it managed to have a very creamy mouth-feel, thanks to the silky squash texture. The risotto grains hit \"al dente\" right on the...tooth.\n\nFor dessert I had a simple and nice roasted pear cotta with sorbet.\n\nMy friend had a beautifully prepared roasted veggie salad--they do nice things with vegetables here--and a seafood linguine that she enjoyed a lot.\n\nI'm surprised there weren't lines out the door here.

It's a nice little romantic spot, great ambiance, its small but quaint and comfortable.  At about 9pm on a sunday night, there was no wait at all.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful in explaining things and providing recommendations (like their linguini is house-made, but not their spaghetti).  He also recommended our appetizer which was the Burratta cheese over a bed of arugula salad.  We loved it, so smooth and soft, it melts in your mouth, MMmMm yum.\n\nI had the Clams and shrimp in linguini with basil tomato sauce which was excellent.  My friends ordered the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa which was fantastic.  The dish was sweet and a little heavy but damn good, I never had anything like it before.\n\nWe ended our meal with the a poached pear, with pear sorbet in a wine reduction sauce which was refreshing.

My favorite pasta dish was a special that hasn't reappeared in sometime: the orecchiette special.  It was simply delicious.  Mike's favorite is the tonnarelli covered in a slight cream sauce with mushrooms and sausage.  The angel hair with tomato and basil has a lot more sauce and cheese than I'm used to ... but that doesn't mean I gobble it all up!  The only things that weren't to my liking were the skimpy glasses of wine, the linguini frutti di mare (really small pieces of shrimp and maybe a bit too salty), and the mushroom risotto.  \n\nThe next time I go, I'm ordering the gnocchi!

There's a little loft at the back of the restaurant and many of the tables are placed in front of the big inviting front windows. I wanted to LOVE this place, I wanted it to fulfill my every need for a corner Italian joint with a romantic flair, but I have to admit that the food just left me unfulfilled and my wallet sad. The food isn't bad, I'm not saying that, but it's not as great as I thought it would be. The gnocchi was okay, but nothing out of this world and our fresh mozzarella appetizer was definitely not as good as in other Italian restaurants in the city. Our bill for 1 app and 3 entrees (no drinks) was over $90 with tip. Overall, I'll probably give it another shot but with so much delicious food so near by, it doesn't make it to the top of the list.", "author": "Emily S."}

We ordered two appetizers (carpaggio and grilled calamari) and four entrees (gnocchi, grilled chicken with radicchio, clams linguini with white wine sauce, and a veal entree). Only the gnocchi was deemed really, really wonderful. The other selections weren't memorable. Dessert was expectantly very good (tiramisu, sorbetto, chocolate ganache cake).\n\nThe ambiance was noisy, but I expected that for a small neighborhood Nob Hill restaurant. I just thought the well-reviewed food would compensate for that. Service was really topnotch, though, as we were well-tended. Unfortunately, the cuisine fell rather flat.

We were greeted immediately and told them we had reservations. They acknowledged and walked off, which is fine, but they did not say anything, whether we had to wait or that its going to be a few more minutes. 10-15 minutes pass by and we can clearly see tables opening up, but still no acknowledgement on when we would be seated. \n\nFinally, we were seated and later did we realize they had like a 20 top coming in. Still, communication needs to be made to make a customer feel welcome. We ordered a bottle of wine and received a complimentary bread basket and olive oil for dipping. The bread was yummy and we were starving, so we ate it all. The selection of wine was great, mostly California wines, which we were fine with\n\nWe ordered a mushroom crustini that had Gorgonzola cheese. It came with five servings, good enough for two, possibly three. We enjoyed the flavors of the mushrooms and the cheese pairing. The bread was crispy and soft. For dinner, we ordered the fettuccine alla ghiotta and sausage gnocchi. Everything was fresh and you can tell they hand make the pasta there. The gnocchi was soft and flavorful along with the fettuccine. We normally aren't fettuccine eaters, but felt like eating it that night and were not disappointed. The serving sizes were just right. They may look small at first, but its the plating and looks that deceived us.\n\nFor dessert, which we had the chocolate torta which was topped with whip cream. We felt it was missing the ice cream element, but still very good.\n\nI would highly recommend making reservations at this place, as it seems to be packed all the time, from other users reviews.", "author": "Mini P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-02", "description": "A friend of mine moved into the Russian Hill area and we decided to find a local restaurant. After Yelping a few options, we picked Ristorante Milano as the location for their \"Congratulations On Moving to SF\" dinner.\n\nWe had a reservation for two at 6 o'clock, but that early in the evening, it wasn't really needed, but in my opinion, it's always better to have a reservation just in case. \n\nAmbiance: The restaurant is a nice quaint, hole in the wall that has a real cozy feel to it on the inside. We were seated on their \"upstairs\" section, which is literally a flight of 4-5 steps which opens to another section that has a few more tables. Because it wasn't that busy yet, it was nice to be able to have a quiet meal as we talked and caught up with each other.\n\nService: I come from a family that once owned a few restaurants, so I know how hard it is to run a restaurant and how hard it is to give the best quality service one possibly can. Ristorante Milano has no problems with service. Our server(I forgot his name) was some young italian stud and I'm positive that if given the chance, my friend would have preferred to have dinner with him than catch up with me(it's probably the italian accent haha). He was very attentive and checked up on us regularly. Water was always filled and our cups were never close to empty. \n\nFood: NOW comes the good part. We ordered the following four items: Antipasto plate, gnocchi, veal scallopine, and tiramisu\n\nAntipasto Plate: This was a smorgasbord of vegetarian items: eggplant, roasted peppers, mushrooms, vegetable omelette, and grilled polenta topped with fresh mozzarella and basil. This was the perfect starter. It wasn't too heavy to start and everything was delicious. My friend thought that the mushrooms were a little too tart/vinegary for her taste, but I enjoyed them. I have always enjoyed polenta, but I have never grilled it before. I found that by grilling it, it added a smoky/bbq/grilled flavor to it that helped contrast the rich creaminess of the mozzarella, which complimented the fresh basil on top really well. The roasted peppers and eggplant were delicious and we finished it all!!\n\nGnocchi: We picked this after reading all of the reviews on yelp and hearing the recommendation on this. I have had store bought gnocchi made at home, gnocchi at other restaurants and homemade gnocchi, made by my italian friend's grandmother, and let me tell you, Ristorante Milano's gnocchi and my friend's grandmother's gnocchi taste very similar, which can attest to the fact that they know exactly what they are doing!! The gnocchi was firm, but wasn't mushy, yet it was soft when you chewed it and not chewy. I've had chewy and mushy gnocchi, Ristorante Milano was neither!! The sauce was nice and creamy, yet not too heavy and rich. My friend ended up taking my dish and I finished her veal scallopine.\n\nVeal Scallopine: The veal scallopine was served with a mushroom marsala sauce with sauteed cauliflower and zucchini and some risotto on the side. The veggies were cooked and seasoned very well, in fact I think I could have finished a whole plate of their cauliflower and zucchini as  a main course. The risotto was well cooked, it may be a little toothy for some, but I prefer a toothy risotto. It also was well seasoned and not too rich. The veal scallopine was delicious and it was covered in a MOUND of mushrooms. I LOVE mushrooms and I LOVE sauces. The marsala sauce was DEEELIISSHHH. I could taste the slight nutty,brandy taste from the marsala wine or madeira wine they used. Again, perfectly seasoned so it wasn't too bland or too salty(a common issue I've had with italian food). \n\nTiramisu: Before I get into this, a little background information: I used to be quite the big boy, but after years and years of self-control and changes to my lifestyle, I've lost a good amount of weight, but no matter how healthy I try to eat, or how much exercise I try to get in a week, the fat boy inside of me still wants to come out and play, and play he did when it came time for dessert. My friend and I were super full, but I've heard great things about their Tiramisu so we had to try it. I am a fan of Tiramisu and I must say that I think Ristorante Milano has one of the best tiramisu's I've ever tasted.  There was just the right amount of espresso soaked ladyfingers to contrast the rich mascarpone. mmmmmm fat boy wants to come out and play just thinking about it again.\n\nConclusion: Overall, it was a very nice dinner. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to meet a friend for dinner or for those that want to take their significant other out for date night.  But there is one downside to this place, and that is that when I go back, it's going to be hard for me to want to try something else besides their gnocchi and if that's the only downside of this restaurant, it definitely deserves its 5 stars.", "author": "Mikey H."}

Had the fresh grilled calamari for the appetizer and it was delightful. The calamari wasn't overly rubbery, but had just the right texture to it. The fresh seafood pasta special was amazing as well-- just the right amount of spiciness to the sauce, and the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked.\n\nOh and most importantly... 50% off a bottle of wine on Wednesdays.

We found Ristorante Milano on Open Table, the reviews were consistently good, so we made our plans - the first time to this establishment for any of us.\n4 of us came to dinner last Monday nite, earlier than we would normally eat, but being a work night and experiencing horrible weather, we arrived for a 6pm reservation and were immediately seated at a nice table by the window, in a small room to the right of the entrance. There were perhaps two other tables occupied when we arrived. Our server, Rafael, could not have been more accommodating, being very patient as we kept getting sidetracked in conversation before really focusing on the menu and nightly specials. The menu that night was overflowing with delicious sounding appetizers and entrees. Rafael was again extremely helpful in describing each dish, even helpfully suggesting a couple. One of us has a lactose intolerance and Rafael went over the entire menu describing what they could do modifying a dish to accommodate her restrictions. Being the Christmas season we started with a bottle of champagne before even looking at the menu. After making our dinner selections (including bruschetta, grilled calamari, and green salad appetizers / gnocchi, seafood risotto, veal, and swordfish entrees), Rafael again was very helping guiding me thru an extensive wine list. Though most of our entrees would otherwise suggest a pairing with a white wine, we all wanted an Italian red that would compliment our meal. Rafael made a couple of suggestions, opining that a red with softer tannins would be a good choice. The man not only knew the entire menu inside and out, but he was dead on with the wine.\nWe had a truly wonderful, memorable evening - great food and wine, wonderful company. The entire staff at the restaurant was extremely attentive without being intrusive. Though patrons were practically lined up out side the door waiting for their tables, we never felt at all rushed to move along. Had the crowd not been so large, we could have lingered much longer, but we happily departed so the table could turn over, completely satiated. It's a winner! We will definitely come back. Thank you Rafael for making the evening such a good experience.", "author": "Mike C."}

I liked the interior design, it is also warm but modern.  The food was very tasty too!  We had the lasagne (which was on special) and the gnocchi with gorgonzola, tomatoes and basil.  This dish was a treat!  \n\nThe only issues we had were with the service.  They weren't unfriendly, they were just clearly understaffed or not good at managing their time.  I worked in the service industry for years, so I'm pretty understanding and granted, it was a Saturday night.  However, while we were seated immediately for our reservation, it took 15 minutes to get menus and another 10 until our waiter greeted us.  I wanted to try the Tiramisu, but by the time we got to dessert, the rest of our group of 6 just wanted to get out of there.  It took over 2 and a half hours to get through our meal.  I do not see a reason to blame any one part of the restaurant (server, kitchen, etc...). They really did just seemed under staffed or perhaps not prepared for it to be busy.  Still, shouldn't you know that it's going to be busy on a Saturday night?  \n\nIt is quite likely that this place gives better service on less busy nights.

We love our wine, and drink more than a bottle per couple, so this is a great deal. \n\nMy friends had already ordered a white when we got there, and being more red drinkers, we decided to order a second.  We picked a wine based on a recommendation of our sweet waitress.  She brought it out, and didn't pay any attention whether it was acceptable.  Our \"taster\" was a little distracted by the menu, I fear.  Nevertheless, she went ahead and just started pouring it.  Meh, okay, thats fine.  \n\nI tried it, and it had that indicative musty nose that it was on the brink of corked.  I'm super sensitive to it, and I decided not to say anything.  Until my friend looked across the table from me.  She didn't need to say anything, lol, and I nodded.  \"Yep, its corked.\"  Once you smell it, there is no enjoyment in drinking it, really.  \n\nSo we said something to our waitress.  She smelled it, and actually tasted it.  She agreed with us.  She had another waiter do the same, and he too said, yep its on the brink,  Its not totally corked, but he could smell it.\n\nThe owner was a dick.  He basically was like thats how its supposed to taste and if we dont like it he will let us choose another wine.  Um, excuse me?!  Wine is supposed to taste corked?  Even my friends non-red wine loving mother could smell it.  We wine taste quite frequently, more often than I will reveal here.  We know our wine.  We know quality wine.  We typically drink French or Napa or Sonoma.  I was deeply offended as was my friend.\n\nBesides that event, the salad was fantastic.  My butternut squash ravioli was....OMG...so sinfully good.  The gelato... meh...Ive had better.  The food was good and our waitress was extremely apologetic and fantastic, but I truly feel that I can't rate any higher because of the poor service we received from the owner.

Evidently people like lots of food.\n\nSeated on time, the ambiance was fine. Thinking back to the early 1980s when this place was Gideo's I fondly recall many good meals here. Nobody here had even heard of Gideo's so I didn't bring it up again.\n\nWe were seated on the balcony in the rear. I had a great view of the back of a wine rack and the lovely aroma of the restrooms wafting over my dinner. Mmmmm. They really might consider doing something about this. But...on to the food and wine.\n\nI asked the waitress, having little familiarity with most of the wine on the list, for something round and earthy. She pointed out a few she liked and suggested a Chianti Classico as her favorite. Putting ourselves in her experienced hands we went with it. Mistake. Super fruity with a giant spiky fruit taste, there was no earthiness, no roundness, no subtlety. Just shrieking, underage whine. We never got past a glass each. But the food would be better, right?\n\nI ordered my salad...beets with grapefruit and a sprinkling of sheep cheese. The portion came out and was large enough to feed a small nation. It was obviously prepared earlier and refrigerated as it was ice cold. I ate about fifteen percent of it and couldn't consider another bite. The entree would be better I figured. It came in a while. Grigliata Mista, \"Grilled combination of sausage, chicken breast and lamb\". A big plate with, you may have guessed it, more beets. The beef was inedible. Bone and fat. The chicken was a think cutlet in some sort of gravy and the lamb was another thin cut full of spice. I had none of the beef, three bites of the lamb and two of the chicken and done.\n\nThe meal was a disaster on all fronts. I just don't get it. So much potential to do something good and they squander it on serving large portions of sub-par stuff. The design of the place is nice. Location...out of the way but not too far is good. An additional star off because of the missed potential. Too bad. I wonder what Gideo is up to these days.", "author": "Gary C."}

The dishes themselves are a bit homely--oversauced for the most part, strewn with a little too much musky, dark, limp, julienned basil.  But they go down easily and if that were all we had to talk about, I'd be up at around 4 stars for Milano.\n\nBut our experiences with other items are less successful.  For example, the complimentary focaccia and olive oil were both largely flavorless.\n\nThe bruschetta antipasto with heirloom tomatoes was billed as coming with gorgonzola but arrived with thick, largely flavorless discs of mozzarella, and the otherwise tasty chopped heirlooms were drowned in not very fruity olive oil and way, way too much garlic.  I would not order it again.\n\nThe proprieter is charming, and he graciously seated us quickly at a rear table in the loft area which quickly got very stuffy.\n\nOur server, though, was far less charming.  She seemed a bit sour and there were long waits for water, then bread, then the appetizer.  And through all of this I waited nearly 30 minutes for a glass of wine, but when the error was finally detected it was comped.\n\nMy lasagna special featured delicate homemade pasta in at least 9 or 10 layers, with a tasty bechamel lurking between the layers, and a generous, maybe even slightly too generous layer of beef and veal meat sauce which was sweet and tasty.\n\nMy companion's fettuccini with Milanese meat sauce--the same sauce on the lasagna--was tasty, but way oversauced and the fettucine is not as delicate or perfectly elastic as we have had at, say, Pasta Moon in Half Moon Bay.\n\nI liked the place and I might wander in if i the neighboorhood but given the waiting lines we saw on our exit, I doubt this is feasible, and if I have to go to the trouble for reservations, I'll likely opt for someplace a little more special than Milano.", "author": "Kevin S."}

I will say that the restaurant is rather small so be prepared for an intimate setting.  It didn't bother me at all but you need to be prepared that you will be dining very close to the table next to you.  My only complaint is that the markup on the wine was a bit higher than normal in my opinion but other than that, everything was great.  I'll be back again for sure.", "author": "Shane T."}

My husband had the Tonnarelli which he said was gummy and the sausage was very hard to find in the cream sauce.   Our son had Fettuccini Milanese, which he said was good but the pasta had a combination of both flour and spinach noodles.  There was no mention of this on the menu and our son cannot eat spinach, so half the dish was wasted.   I had the Chicken Saltimbocca which was very salty.   We also had a moderately priced bottle of wine and shared a scoop of gelato. All items were a la carte.  We agreed that the food was not memorable.  Although the owner was bustling about the small restaurant, he never stopped by our table to ask how things were or to wish us a happy holiday. It was not a warm or comfortable restaurant.  The one hundred and fifty dollar tab was way too steep for a mediocre meal.", "author": "MC B."}

We have dined here twice during the past month.  Went back a second time because we wanted to see if the place was for real after an incredible first visit where we ate family style and shared many dishes.  Second visit was as good as the first.  The food bursts with fresh flavors.  You can taste all of the ingredients because they use very few.  Just the best fresh stuff available.  We love the Calamari with Cannaloni beans.  Asked the owner who is named Aldo how he makes the dish so fresh and delicious.  He told us he gets the calamari fresh each day and then simply grills it.  Amazing....the Butternut Squash Ravioli was one of the best pasta dishes of my life.  Everything we tried here was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-10-12", "description": "Wandering around the Hyde Street area, my friend had passed by this little Italian restaurant many times and finally had the opportunity to dine there with me.\r\n\r\nWe chose a small table at the very back and up some stairs.  It was a bit of tight squeeze, as with all the other tables in this establishment.\r\n\r\nThe meal started with a very dense focaccia type bread and olive oil for dipping.  I had to hold off after one slice since I knew it was filling me up quickly.\r\n\r\nWe ordered the Antipasto Misto ($11.75), a selection of house made appetizers.  It included a quiche type thing, roasted peppers which were lovely, toasted bread with mozzarella, some red sauce on toasted bread, mushrooms, and olives.  It was an interesting mix and great for two people to share.  It would have been nice if they told us what all the appetizers were when the plate arrived.\r\n\r\nFor our entrees, we shared the Capelli d'Angelo al Filetto di Pomodoro ($11.95), which is homemade angel's hair prepared with fresh tomatoes, oil and garlic and the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa ($12.95), which is house made pasta in light cream sauce with porcini mushrooms and Italian sausage.  The capelli was a bit heavier on the sauce than I expected, but very tasty.  And the tonnarelli was very flavorful too.  The sausage was a bit ground up, and I think I expected more chunk-like pieces.  The portion sizes are okay.  It doesn't look like a whole lot.  I think if I didn't order an appetizer, I would have finished my entree quite easily.\r\n\r\nThinking I had not saved any room for dessert, I changed my mind once the (very cute) waiter told us the specials of the day.  I went with the  Poached peach with amaretto cookie crumbs and ice cream ($6.50) and my friend could not resist her favorite - Tiramisu ($6.50), which are ladyfingers dipped in rum and espresso layered with mascarpone and cocoa.  The peach was piping hot and a very light dessert that was calming to stomach after the heavy pasta dinner.  My friend was not impressed with the tiramisu.  Her biggest complaint was that there wasn't enough rum in it.  She could hardly taste any.  Since I'm not a tiramisu fan myself, I couldn't really say much about it expect that I still didn't like tiramisu.\r\n\r\nOverall, the waitstaff is quite pleasant and nice.  Very friendly with smiles and everything.  So, I will give a big thumbs up on their positive attitude at this restaurant.  As I am a heavy water drinker, I did have to ask not once, but twice for my water glass to be refilled.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't exactly call Ristorante Milano romantic.  It was loud in the main dining area and with all the tables so close together, you can hear everyone else's business.  It fills up pretty quickly on a weeknight, as with most of the decent restaurants around the Hyde Street area.\r\n\r\nOverall, my friend and I felt this was a 3 star experience.  The food was good, not great.  You can tell you are getting a homemade experience, which is definitely nice.  When it came down to it, the food was just that - good, not fabulous.  \r\n\r\nSide note: Restrooms - tiny!  No fat people allowed!  Tables are small for parties of two and it gets crowded on there right away, especially if you're sharing.", "author": "Teri C."}

Light and airy, true puff perfections, offered with two different sauces (the tomato and basil was possibly some of the best sauce I've tasted). After eating the entire dish you wont feel disgusting and bloated, but instead happily satisfied (see I've said my piece about the gnocchi as well!). \n\nWhat I want to HIGHLIGHT is the Crostini ai Funghi-- yes that would be Mushroom Bruschetta. I don't believe people have given justice to it. It is hands down the best bruschetta I've tasted! Different from traditional tomato bruschetta, there are instead diced and perfectly seasoned mushrooms with Gorgonzola cheese. Although it's an appetizer I would've ordered another batch and eaten it again as my entree. Do not miss out on these! \n\nService was very attentive without being overbearing. There is a quaint waiting area outside of the restaurant (a bench and tables/chairs with flowers about) which is nice if there is a wait.

My one-bite boyfriend was just fine.\n\nWe split the Risotto special with seafood. A few shrimps, mussels, and a mystery white fish. But what was really disappointing was the risotto. It had zero flavor, and might as well have come from a cardboard box meal. Watery, tasteless. I picked out the seafood and left the rice.\n\nWe also split the Veal Scaloppine with marsala and mushrooms.

It was just the right amount of food. They also give you bread with olive oil, though I don't think either of us were fans. I'm usually a big bread eater but this one didn't have much flavor so it was easy to say 'no' to the carbs! :)\n\nTuna Carpaccio: Pretty presentation, but did not have very many flavors to it. I thought it was very warm compared to past tuna carpaccios that I've had. We squeezed all of the lemon on top hoping it would make the dish more zesty, but it still was seemingly flavorless.\n\nFettucine al Sugo di Carne alla Milanese: You must order with the homemade fettucini noodles. They give you green (spinach?) and plain ones combined with the red meat sauce so it gives it a really beautiful presentation. The flavor here was packed with yumminess! We were definitely both a fan and agreed it made up for the Tuna Carpaccio. I always feel guilty ordering spaghetti with meat at a restaurant because it's so cheap/easy to make at home, but I can safely say I could not replicate this.\n\nSpecial of the day - Rissotto: The Rissotto was cooked to perfection. I'm not sure what was in it, but it had very mild flavors compared to the Fettucini alla Milanese.

I'm use to a swordfish steak not a fillet where it is 3/4 to 1\" thick and this was 1/4 to 3/8\" thick and tasted like it was boiled with parsley sprinkled on top.  I'm sure not a food critic but I would not return.  The owner or manager did ask us how we liked our meal and what we thought.  We told him and he did remove the entree from the bill.\n\nI got a calamari appetizer that was very good and my entree was a \"stew\" with mussels, shrimp and  scallops over rice that was okay but nothing great.\n\nMaybe it was just a bad night for us as the other reviews have been very good and is the reason we chose here to eat.

Often times, these meat sauces are too salty for me, but tonight it was just right!  The plate came out steaming and the noodles portion was perfect with plenty of sauce left over for dipping with bread!\nMy fiance had the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa - pasta in light cream sauce with Porcini Mushrooms and Italian sausage...this was perfect!

We waited until the last minute on a Sunday night to make reservations. Little did we know it was prom night and just about every restaurant in town was booked. Milano was the only restaurant I called that was willing to squeeze in our party of 6 on 20 minutes notice. They even re-arranged their seating in the loft for us (though, that made going to the restroom tricky). \n\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive. The food was buenisimo! I had the fettucine alla ghiotta and it was one of the most heavenly things I have ever eaten. The sauce was so rich and creamy, with great flavors that really complimented the Italian sausage in it. My friend had ordered the gnocchi and after having a bite of mine, she said she had wished she had ordered the fettucine instead. Two people in our party had the special ravioli filled with boar. One thought it was great the other wasn't wowed. We topped off dinner with a duo of their housemade sorbets. The pear sorbet was very rich and smooth and not overly sweet. The raspberry was a bit more granulated, probably from too much sugar but still good, I just preferred the pear.\n\nGreat intimate spot for a delicious Italian dinner. I just recommend making a reservation well in advance because this place is always bumpin' even on a Sunday night! Oh, and additional kudos for being patient while our math whiz divvied up the check.", "author": "Lorraine L."}

She ordered the Angel Hair and Tomato Sauce. Usually I wouldn't even bat an eye in that item's direction but there was something so comforting and special about it.

I wonder if the quality has gone down over the years or if San Franciscans have merely decided better options exist. \n\nMy major gripe is Milano's prices. They are too high for what seems like a neighborhood restaurant, even though it is located in an expensive neighborhood. Entrees range in price up to $30 and nothing is ever stellar. I tried a Veal Marsala-like dish for $30 at Milano and it was inferior to a similar dish that is $10 less at Nob Hill Cafe (same neighborhood, if not nicer). \n\nI don't want to decide to not cook one night, walk a few blocks, and then have an impromptu $80 meal. It feels too lavish for a 24 year old research assistant whose parents are probably at home eating a Whole Foods rotisserie chicken. \n\nThe best thing I've had at Milano was a very simple fettucine with meat sauce. It didn't blow my mind, but it was very satisfying (except of course too expensive). The other things I've liked were a bruschetta special and the espresso granita dessert. Both were pretty darn good.\n\nThe service is very nice and the waitress we've had every time we've been there is cute, warm, and totally welcoming.

My mother had the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare  - house-made linguine with fresh shellfish in a white sauce - $25. The seafood was fine but the white sauce turned out to be a rank, foul-tasting light brown broth. The linguine noodles were blase, and covered in grease from the broth. My mother and I agreed the awful broth ruined the dish. My aunt, visiting from Arkansas, had the Fettucine al Sugo di Carne alla Milanese - house-made fettucine with Milanese meat - $19, which she liked. I found it okay but tasteless and lacked any meat. I had the Scallopine di Vitello - milk-fed veal scaloppine of the day - $33. This was the worst dish of the night. It tasted horrible, it wasn't veal, and it was really veal parmigiana without the veal!! It had a very funky flavor. I stopped the waiter and asked him if this dish was veal, he said it was. I told him the dish tasted weird, he replied, \"It's made with smoked mozzarella.\" What??? First off, it was not veal scaloppine, it was fake-veal parmigiana. The fake-veal was tasteless beyond the funky flavor - I suspect it was tofu or some artificial meat. My mother thought it was some processed fake meat. It definitely was NOT veal - I've had veal hundreds of time and cooked it numerous times. Second, it was not scallopine - the fake-meat was covered in melted cheese and topped with tomato sauce - fake-veal parmigiana! I would have sent it back but I didn't want to create a scene in front of my visiting aunt who we had not seen in decades. For dessert, my aunt had the pistachio gelato, and liked it, but like I wrote she's lives in Arkansas. My mother had the chocolate torte and liked it. My mother had a glass of Proseco - $13, which was decent, and a cup of coffee. I had a glass of unremarkable Chianti - $12. My aunt drank water. Before tip, our meal was $134.07. After we dropped off my aunt at her hotel, my mother and I discussed the meal and felt we got totally ripped off.

I knew it had become pretty popular and was worried the food might suffer because of it. I went early to avoid the rush of people (yes, even on a Tuesday night, Milano will fill up by about 7:30, but they do take reservations). It turns out I didn't have much to worry about.\n\nFor appetizers we had the bruschetta special which was delish and served with mozerella, tomatoes and olives. It was very flavorful and when all of the different flavors combined it was like biting into a warm summers day. Also for apps I was feeling a bit adventurous and ordered the Fegatini alla Griglia (chicken livers and bacon w/ radicchio). I would call this fair. The radicchio went well with the livers but the meat was left on the flame a little too long and instead of being smoked was more like burnt. Which is too bad because I think smoky bacon would have complimented it very well. \n\nFor the main course we both got the gnocchi and I was very happy when it came out just as light and airy as I remembered. Like little pillows of goodness melting in your mouth. I still think Milano has the best gnocchi in the city. \n\nFor dessert we got the tiramisu and the little pick me up was great. After my very disappointing tiramisu experiences in Seattle I was really hoping for a good showing and Milano delivered. Served with ladyfingers that were soaked in espresso, large layers of light and fluffy cheese filling and given a wonderful dusting of cocoa on top, it's a piece of goodness on a plate. \n\nYes, it's a little pricey. If you order an app, entr\u00e9e, dessert and a little wine you're looking at $40-$50 a person. If the price scares you off, just order an entree and leave with a $20-$25 bill.", "author": "Russ C."}

That would be the only negative I have with the place, personally.\n\nThe boy and I shared a vegetarian appetizer that was delicious. I honestly wish I could remember the name of the appetizer, but it's been a month. For the main dish, I had the cheese ravioli at the recommendation of our waitress and the boy had the gnocchi. Both was heavenly delicious. The ravioli were bigger than they appeared on the plate initially and the gnocchi simply melted away in my mouth. We had a dessert, too, but I can't remember what it was.. I just remember there being chocolate and it being heavenly and telling myself that the boy deserved to get something special for bringing me to such a delicious place.\n\nI would definitely go again if I could. Parking is hard to find, so plan ahead (we had taxi'd there) and I would definitely recommend making reservations first or else you're subjected to wait time. Not for big groups, unless you guys like rubbing elbows with every John, Dick and Henry that sits next to you.", "author": "Anna W."}

I wouldn't say it was as great as everyone says, but I did enjoy my meal. \n\nFor appetizers we had Bruschetta, Calamari & mozzarella. All were a variation of what we are used to: Bruschetta was with mushrooms, Calamari came with beans (but I thought was really good) and the mozzarella was served on polenta. I liked them all, but they weren't what I was expecting.\n\nFor dinner, I had the gnocchi which I really liked. It was cooked just right and melted in my mouth. I'm a gnocchi lover and they made this well. They only had one type of beer (Peroni) which was a bit disappointing after a day of wine tasting when we wanted something else. \n\nIn terms of ambiance, it's hard to tell. I think it would normally be great, but there was a party of 12-15 people close by that were *really* loud so it was hard to hear each other. At least it sounded like they were having fun.\n\nOverall, I would go again but will probably try a few new Italian places in North Beach first because I didn't think it was overly special.", "author": "Katie W."}

As other reviews have indicated, this place is tiny, and really only good for small parties.  The tables are extremely close together, and the place is quite noisy, meaning we felt like we were dining at the same table as all of our neighbors.  So ambiance, not that great, but the service was very good.\n\nOf course, the thing everybody really cares about is the food.  They started us with some awesome looking bread that unfortunately wasn't near as good tasting as it looked.  It was dry and crumbly and maybe a bit stale?  However, olive oil and balsamic vinegar make even mediocre bread decent.  We had the calamari appetizer with cannelloni beans, which was very good, but also very expensive for what we got.  I had the Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa (recommended by others here), and was generally pleased.  It wasn't the best pasta ever, but it was fresh and tasty and not overbearing.  If you've ever had the Archers Farms mushroom pasta from Target, the flavor was very similar to that, except with much better ingredients.  My girlfriend had the fettuccine with sausage and tomatoes and the flavor was rather subtle and a bit understated.  It wasn't bad, but she was a bit disappointed.\n\nThe high point of the meal was really dessert.  We got the poached pear done in a Marsala reduction with pear sorbet, and it was fantastic.  I highly recommend it to anybody and everybody.\n\nThe plates here range from about $17 - $30, and the cheapest wine they have is $9 per glass.  We're pretty frugal eaters, but after our $18ish meals, two glasses of wine, an appetizer, desert, tax and tip, we had spent close to $100.\n\nOverall, a decent experience, but nothing special, and $100 is too much for what we got out of it.  It's doubtful we'll return.", "author": "Alex P."}

I am putting Milano into the category of \"middle of the week local dinner spot.\"    \n\nI am thankful though, that the food wasn't especially good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-07-10", "description": "Photos uploaded.\n\nI am very picky about Italian food.  More specifically, I am really particular about my pasta.  \n\nWhen in search of good pasta dishes, I don't care about how authentic it is, and whether or not it's available in some corner of Italy, or not.  What I do care about is that it MUST taste good -- not be overpowered by whatever choice of sauce, and most importantly, the noodles must be of great texture, and perfectly cooked.  \n\nHaving heard of Ristorante Milano for awhile now, I've even heard someone describe it as a piece of Italy being available in San Francisco.  Needless to say, I had high hopes as I reserved this restaurant for a party of four for dinner.\n\nAnother outing with Archie, and this time, we were meeting up with Jacqueline and Andrew for dinner.  We all came hungry, and ordered a lot of food.\nOff the top of my head, we had the following:\n\n- Prosciutto with Cheese:  good\n- Chicken Liver Dish:  excellent\n- Burrata Cheese w/ Tomatoes:  good\n- Fried Anchovies or was it Sardines?:  decent\n- Bigfin Tuna for Andrew:  didn't try it but it was raw, which was unexpected\n- Gnocchi for Jacqueline:  tried it, it was alright, but I am admittedly not a big fan of gnocchi\n- Ravioli for Archie:  good pasta, I didn't like the butternut squash filling, altogether too heavy and it looked oily\n- My pasta - -can't remember the name but the thick noodles were homemade and perfect cooked - - the sauce was seriously ODD.... like drenched in walnuts.  Overbearing, but A+ for the noodles.\n\nArchie brought two fabulous bottles of wine for us to share, as usual.  \n\nThanks to Jacqueline, who brought her amazing brownies, we had no need for dessert.  Y'all should try it, great stuff, and readily available here: http://www.jacquelinesgoodies.blogspot.com/ (Yes, that is a plug, what of it?)  Seriously - they were moist and delicious - and while I am not big on sweets, I had to help myself to one anyway.\n\nThe place is small, packed and loud.  It is quite reminiscent of a small Italian restaurant - - service was pretty decent, and all in all, I liked the food just fine, but was really quite taken aback by the walnut taste in the otherwise great pasta.  It was entirely too much - and furthermore, there was NO mention of this walnut at all on the menu.  I have a small pet peeve - - and it's small tables.  I mean, it's one thing at a coffeeshop, but at a restaurant that will be bringing out four plates - - I feel like it's rude to give us a small table on which we cannot fit four plates at a time.  The entire mood of a meal is already enlivened when you present dinner at a HUGE table, like it says, \"Welcome, eat to your heart's content, you can fit it all on our tables.\"  The neighborhood has difficult parking -  but there are some cool, local spots nearby, like Cafe Meuse, where Archie and I hung out afterwards.  \n\nAll in all, while I enjoyed dinner here, Ristorante Milano missed the mark, and doesn't quite make its way to any list of mine.  I've had much better Italian food at Fino, or other SF places.  \n\nIt's not actually perfect for a date, and it's definitely not great for large groups.  It's not a Happy Hour spot, and while the food was overall decent - - I can't say that I thought it was any more deserving than 3-3.5 stars.\n\nThe night was terrific in that I was amongst great company, and really enjoyed myself.  I wish I had picked a better restaurant, but oh well.  I did make all my usual disclaimers, \"I've never been here, do not blame me for the food, I am hoping it's good too, but I dunno!!!!\"  \n\nThanks, Archie, for dinner - and Jacqueline and Andrew, for coming all the way up to the city just to eat with us!  Now to think of it, Archie - you drove quite a distance also - so thank you for that, too!  \n\n(Funny, I was the only one who was local ... and also the only one who was late.

As the place is small, he chose to stand between our two tables, which was slightly weird because his rear end was dangerously close to my head. (Did I mention the place was a bit small?) But I really found that more silly than annoying.\n\nThen the man finished giving the couple the specials and told us he'd be right back for us.

We were, but the man tried to say something to her (either we weren't ready, or he wasn't ready, or whatever).\n\nBut we were ready, so we ordered.\n\nI ordered the Saltimboco di Pollo (no, neither my memory nor Italian is that good -- I had to look it up on their web site.)

I mean, I can't complain about bad service here... but is it  possible our service was *too* good?\n\nAs we waited for our food, we noshed on the focaccia bread. Major points for the restaurant for only pouring olive oil to dip the bread in. I mean, seriously, I can't stand vinegar mixed in my olive oil. Here it wasn't even an option (well, maybe we could have asked for it, so if that's your thing, don't despair). Just a little dish of olive oil. Mmmm.\n\nI think my one complaint was that I was a little off put by the Coke can on our table. My friend wanted a Coke. Nothing wrong with that. And I certainly didn't expect the restaurant to have a soda fountain in the back. But I just found it odd--and almost crass, in some weird way--that in this nice little restaurant with tiny tables and white tableclothes, that a Coke can would be sitting in the middle of a table. Next time, maybe pour it in the kitchen and bring it out. Or get those cute glass bottles. \n\nOh! And the bathroom is adorably tiny.

And also, because of this distinctive relationship to italian food, my judgement is probably biased.\n\nHowever, the food here was excellent.  Truth be told, I didn't have to pay for it ... which may have made it better, but I did have the full-on experience including antipasti, entree, wine, and dessert.  And to make it even better we had a waitress from Italy, who was also really hot.  It didn't hurt the experience.\n\nThere were many great things about the meal, but my favorite dish was my entree, which was a saffron chicken risotto with zucchini.  I've never seen saffron risotto offered at a restaurant (it's always that mushy *other* risotto which I'm not really a fan of) and thought that my dad was the only one who prepared it that way.  But I was pleasantly wrong as this was absolutely phenomenal.  The rice was the perfectly aldente, the chicken was tender and tasty, and the zucchini was added at a point where it was warm but still crispy.\n\nMmm.\n\nOne thing that would have made my dining experience over the top, would have been to review the menu before hearing the specials.  They have many regular specials that are all noted in their menu, and had I known that, it would have been easier to follow.\n\nOtherwise, if you have some cash to drop, this is a great place to eat.", "author": "Becca B."}

I made a reservation online at 7:40pm for 8:30pm so that was awesome, and when we got there we were seated within a few minutes even though the place was full. Minus one star because the place was basically a fire hazard with way too many tables and people waiting by the door to be seated (the whole time we were there). Basically no room to back up your chair because someone was seated right behind you.\n\nAside from the obvious lack of space, the food was excellent and the bottle of wine we got was some of the best I've ever had.

The kind who wants every meal to be delicious and would rather not eat than eat bad, or even mediocre, food.\n\nLast night I had a non-foodie moment (what can I blame for this: exhaustion, laziness?).   I just wanted to have some regular, basic Italian comfort food within walking distance from my place.  I didn't care to hear about the provenance of the olive oil or that the porcini mushrooms were overnighted from Italy.  In retrospect...  maybe I should have cared.\n\nSee, I had been to Ristorante Milano before, about a year ago.  I remember laughing at the horribly dated, cheapie decor and tacky low-budget place settings.  But I remember the food being unexpectedly good.  Sadly this is no longer the case.\n\nAre my standards too high?  Is it ok to serve stale foccacia, flavorless olive oil (surely some low-quality blend), an equally flavorless salad of amaturely sliced fennel, weedy arugula, olives, and burrata that desperately needed a squirt of lemon and better olive oil and good salt (salt on the table being the awful diner kind... I'm seriously considering toting my own box of fleur de sel with me to restaurants to avoid this sad fate)?  It is also all right to pass off a truly underseasoned, soggy mess of overcooked noodles as lasagne?  Where was the rich bechamel?  The deep flavors of long-simmered meat?  All I tasted were rudimentary tomato flavors scented with eau de tin can. \n\nAt least the tiramisu marginally redeemed the experience.  It was excellent.  \n\nFood this bleak would normally make me angry.  But I'm not.  Maybe because the company was good and I was too relaxed to care.  Or maybe I've reached this zen-like mental state where I accept that not every restaurant can be great.  \n\nWell.

But then, a good long wait before our entrees...felt like 20-30 minutes? I don't remember anyone checking up on us...granted it was a Friday evening and the restaurant started to get busier and busier. Entrees were very good when they arrived, but again, no check-in w/us during the meal. Soon we were looking for our waiter to ask for the check, and he was very busy w/the other diners. I managed to get his attention and ask for the check, but he never returned to our table after that, obviously forgetting about us. I flagged down the hostess who eventually brought me the bill (but had to get our food ticket from the waiter to ring it up anyway). That whole paying process took another 20 minutes which was frustrating and reflected in my tip.

Everything was very good, but that pasta was just fantastic.  I have to go back very soon just to get a plate of that pasta for myself.  \n\nAmazingly, we still had room for dessert.  We shared the tiramisu, persimmon sorbet, and the poached pear.  Divine!\n\nThe place is small, so if you have a large party, it's going to be tight.  In terms of service, our waiter was fantastic.  I can't say enough about him.  So personable and just all out friendly (not to mention cute with an Italian accent.  HELLO!)  The owner or manager ( I don't know who he was) - I don't think he liked it when my dad commented that our table for 5 was so small.  We basically got two small tables pushed together and then an extra chair on the side.  The \"owner\" went around to check on every table through the evening and ask how they were.  Every table except ours.  Whatever.  Lucky for him the food and our waiter were so good.", "author": "Denise M."}

But there is nothing bad that I found about the restaurant to be honest. \n\nWhen my party arrived, we were offered numerous tables in the back, middle, and front of the restaurant--we decided to stay up front. And although the menu was already filled with an amazing assortment of appetizers and entrees, they had numerous specials that were quite delicious. I had the Tonnarelli Alla Capricciosa, which everyone at my table finished off. My lover had the pasta special which was lamb and really good. The bro had Ahi carpaccio which was really tasty too. For appetizers, I would recommend the Speck E Formaggi because they have fresh prosciutto and the best soft and hard cheeses I have yet tasted. \n\nAnd now the finale--dessert! I was a bit disappointed because I had the impression that they had Zabaione Caldo (warm custard whipped to order with Marsala wine and vanilla), but it wasn't on the menu. Bummer. The boys order Tiramisu and I questioned the server about the Zabaione and they made it specially for me!!! Yay! \n\nNo restaurants can ever go wrong with great service, great food and also making their customers feel special! Magnifico!", "author": "Maureen B."}

We were seated in the 4-table upper level of this split level restaurant, which was a blessing and allowed us to enjoy our food.  Other than ourselves, upper level diners included a solo diner, and a young couple.  The lower level, however, was beset by a family with a constantly crying child (whose parents made no move to soothe it) and a table of 8 boisterous men acting like boys.  I mention this only to point out that the staff had the good sense to segregate us -- props to them.  We all agreed that, given a different set of dining companions, it might be nice to sit near the large front windows to watch the street life.\n\nThe waiter was attentive and helpful, and suggested a perfect Chianti Classico.  The only missed note was the grilled calamari appetizer, which was probably wonderful when it first came off the grill.  However, it arrived warm and quickly cooled, after which it was not very nice.  Although the meal started poorly, it quickly recovered.  My son had lamb sausage and polenta, my wife had gnocchi in a tomato cream sauce, and I had a lovely ravioli stuffed with sausage and Gorgonzola.  All of our entrees were perfectly prepared -- the sausage and polenta was particularly outstanding.  \n\nThe desserts were flawless: tiramisu, poached pear, and chocolate cake with almonds.  Nobody was willing to share, and that's unusual for us.  And telling.\n\nOf particular note was the busboy (\"boy\" seems an inappropriate appellation for a swarthy man with an earring who looks like a pirate), who scurried around unobtrusively but incredibly efficiently.

Some of our party was early and some were late, but they seated me and some other who came early immediately. \n\nWe got some bread as we ordered (ie. after the late-comers finally arrived) and I was starving.  So I ate three slices of the tasty bread (they cut these slices big!)\n\nI ordered the tonnatelli w/ porcini mushrooms, italian sausage in a light cream sauce.p  The tonnatelli itself was nice, but the overall dish was bland.  I couldn't taste the porcini or the italian sausage!  I added salt and parm cheese but it didn't really do too much.  Needless to say I was disappointed.\n\nI tried my friend's gnocchi which was excellent, so I know they definitely have good food.  I just chose the wrong dish....but I don't like restaurants that have good dishes and bad dishes. They should all be good!\n\nThe service though, was excellent. Our waitress was very sweet and fun.  We had brought in a cake for dessert so they served it for us ($20 \"corkage\" fee) and sang to the three birthday girls.\n\nOn our way out the girl who made the reservations thanked Aldo for his kindness and he followed us out and thanked us for coming and asked if we had a good meal.

Overall I thought the place was good but my experience was in part undermined by the large party beside my table.\n\nFood: very good.\n\nService: good; but funny story about that, mid-way through the meal, my appetizer plate was being cleared and I asked for another glass of wine from the busser.  Shortly thereafter, the waitress came up and asked if I would like another glass of wine.  The waitress and the busser looked very much alike, and for a while I was confused, thinking that the same person was asking me if I wanted a glass of wine twice.  Took me a while to figure out that it was two different people.  I am going to try to take the positive perspective on this and claim that my full attention was on my date for the evening and that is why I was distracted....\n\nNoise level: extremely high!!!!!!!!!  We were seated next to a large party, perhaps 12 people.  The kind of people who like to yell from one end of the party to the other.... dear Lord.  Things got so bad that I asked my food to be wrapped up to go and skipped desert, my date and I just couldn't stand it.\n\nI think I will try this place again and see if the noise level issue was just an aberration.", "author": "Chris W."}

It's a nice intimate restaurant where you can sit back, relax, and enjoy your meal. Enjoy your pasta that is, \"the way a whore would make it\".   : )  \n\nI ordered their Fettuccine alla puttanesca. Apparently, pasta alla puttansca originated in Naples and was named after local prostitutes, meaning \"Pasta the way a whore would make it\".  It is supposed to be quick and easy.  The sauce that is. To make. The puttanesca sauce  is a lite tomato-based sauce, and in my opinion, lacks the spice that is befitting it's name.\n\nNow that my mind is out of the gutter, let's talk about rest of the dish, which included their homemade Fettuccine with capers, olives, anchovies, and fresh tomatoes.  The pasta was fresh and perfectly prepared.  The blend of the other ingredients added a nice taste and texture to the dish, which made up for the sauce's lack of flavor.\n\nOverall, enjoyable, but not fantastic.

So often, Italian restaurants rely on quantity over quality, and serve overflowing bowls of starchy heavy crap. Ristorante Milano instead serves rationally sized plates of fresh, delicate food. Their gnocchi is exactly as good as everyone else has said it is, and their other pasta dishes are just as luscious.\n\nI also really like the fact that if you ask the waiter for a wine recommendation, they don't try and be snooty about it. A friend of mine prefers sweeter wines, and they were happy to suggest a demisec wine that would go nicely with the meal. They are happy to suggest a red wine for the fish if that is your preference.\n\nI've been with friends, and based on my experiences, it was my first choice for a place to take my parents when they were visiting.

It's very comfy and cozy inside, whether it's a crowded Saturday night or early on a less busy weeknight.  The gnocchi comes in lots of varieties and is quite good.  I grew up eating my Sicilian great great uncle's gnocchi so it's high praise for me to write that a restaurant serves \"good\" gnocchi.  Anyway, it's one of my favorite Italian restaurants in the City.  The only semi-complaint that I have is that when I once took my underage cousin for dinner during her busy finals period, the server was pretty intense about politely suggesting - via her recommendations and incredulity that we didn't want more - that we order an appetizer or drinks or dessert.  It wasn't totally out of line, but it was a little cloying and surprising (and brings them down a star).", "author": "Steven W."}

We had the best seat in the house, top level left hand side back corner table, with a view across the place- one star deducted because we waited 45 minutes after our reservation -- which was frustrating at the time, but in retrospect well worth it.

I would highly recommend this place for dates.", "author": "Cathy T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-09-28", "description": "I've lived in Oakland for more than 10 years now and am frustrated by the lack of decent eateries.  For some reason  Oakland can't seem to get its act together as far as cuisine is concerned.  Driving by Milano,  I was curious to see if the legacy could be disproved so I decided to pop in for lunch.  It was practically empty (a bad sign) and those folks that were there didn't seem too happy.  Nevertheless,  I went in anyway.  The waiter was a nice guy but seemed to be a little on the bored side.  The owner was there as well,  keeping one eye on the customers and the other on the napkins that he was folding.  I decided to keep it nice and simple so I ordered the caprese salad and a seafood risotto.  I figured that any Italian place worth its salt couldn't possibly mess this up.  The caprese arrived and looked fairly typical.  Unfortunately the looks and the taste did not exactly coincide with each other.  The Balsamic vinegar was thick and syrupy  and,  in my opinion,  slightly bitter.  The tomatoes were hard to cut, under-ripe and too thick.  Finally,  the basil was bitter and not at all basil-tasting.  I have to add a lot of salt and pepper just to mask the bitterness.  On to the risotto... It was undercooked.  Risotto should be creamy and rich.  This one was undercooked and grainy,  not a texture that I was expecting.  It was also bland so I had to add more salt and pepper to give it flavor.  I should have asked for Parmesan cheese but it didn't occur to me at the time.  The waiter should have asked me at the beginning if I wanted some.  The seafood (shrimp,  clams,  muscles) were fairly decent but the muscles were a little on the fishy side which made me question their freshness.  I usually don't do restaurant reviews but I was pretty disappointment with this place.   I guess part of me was really hoping to discover an unhidden gem in Oakland that could dispel the bad-food reputation that this City has.  Milano is in a great location and with drastic improvements, could really knock em dead with their food and service but I don't think that the $38 I spent on lunch today (including 2 beers) was worth it.  Milano,  are you listening? Get your act together!", "author": "Brian Divina M."}

The wait staff always welcomes us with a smile and makes great recommendations.  I love when they recite the specials...a tremendous list where everything sounds delicious!

I was pretty excited to have dinner at Ristorante Milano because I have heard rave reviews about the excellent food from one of my co-workers awhile back already. Ristorante Milano is a cute little neighborhood Italian restaurant where you go to have great food and wine with great company. The restaurant is located in Nob Hill where there is absolutely no parking! Be smart and park a few blocks down at the Jug Shop (corner of Polk and Pacific). They have some sort of deal made with the restaurant so that you can park there. I wanted to order the Linguine ai Frutti di mare, but since we were there pretty late, all they had left were clams. So they whipped up a linguine, clam, and white wine sauce dish for me. It was delicious. I loved how they used fresh linguine! The sauce was very light and delicate. The Pinot Grigio I ordered went perfectly with my pasta. Our waiter was also very cute. He had a very cute Italian accent. All in all, it was a very nice dinner with exceptional food in a relaxed setting.", "author": "Patricia L."}

Just like at home, there are some snafu's as well.  It's like you're going over Uncle Guido's house:  its loud, its fun, its crowded, but it tastes good.  Not a perfect evening per se, but a very tasty and memorable one.  \n\nJust like going to my cousin house, we call him 'Mario Crumb-Buns', you get a warm welcome from the owner...Aldo.  He's very pleasant and makes sure you feel like you walked into his personal living room.  We had reservations at 8pm and being that it's a tiny place, it's almost impossible to time the tables perfectly, so we had to wait about 20 minutes, but we didn't mind.  *Note, there is barely enough room in the entrance way to wait, so either bundle up with warm clothes and wait outside or fear the urge to hate tight spaces. Oh and the bathroom?....I felt just like Gulliver, shipwrecked and washed ashore finding myself inside a beach side bathroom on the island of Lilliput.  If you were 2 feet tall, you'd think the bathroom was a bit cramped.  So think how anyone of \"normal\" size feels.  So if you seem like you should be a contestant on the \"Biggest Loser\", you better relieve yourself before. Even if you don't eat here, stop by for a pee and experience this masterpiece of toilet dimension.  Truly interesting.  \n\nSo the Food and service:  We had sweet sausage with lentils and a salad with barrata(sp?) cheese.  It was good, not great.  The bread they give you table side is focaccia, but it's dry and seems stale.  Our main courses were very good.  Pork Tenderloins and my gf had the Lamb Chops.  Each was seasoned and cooked very well.  The service was great.  Fun and well informed wait staff that made us feel well taken care of.  The prices are VERY reasonable as well.  Most entres were under $15 and I still left food on the plate.  I talked with other Russian Hill frequenters while waiting for our table and they come to this place every two weeks.  Heard great things about the Lasagna, chicken, and fettuccini a la ghiotta.  \n\nI will go again... but with completely empty bladder.  Ouch!", "author": "Vince C."}

The Tonnarelli alla Capricciosa is the housemade pasta in light cream sauce with porcini mushrooms and Italian sausage. I felt like the dog 'Snuffles', who when given a bisciut, would float up into the air making happy, contented sounds, then slowly drift back down. The earthy woody flavor of the Porcini mushrooms was so intense in this sauce. The pasta was cooked perfectly and had a nice chewy texture. Lasagne paled in comparison, but the layers of pasta were so light and airy. Mozzarella con peperoni is presented on soft pillows of grilled Polenta. We also shared a Radicchio salad that was dressed in a light citrus dressing. Being full did not stop us from ordering desserts. The Tiramisu is very good, but the prize here is one of the dessert specials, the Ricotta pie that has a hint of lemon. Waiters here are hotties.

I am finally breaking down and writing a review because after few years being spoiled rotten with the epicurean scene in San Francisco I am still in love.\n\nI love Ristorante Milano because of its straightforward in-your-face SIMPLE GOODNESS. Nothing is strange or \"exotic\". Every dish my companions and I ate were elegantly and solidly executed. They don't try anything overly complicated to bedazzle you, or go out of their way to sensationalize an unusual ingredient. They just do FOOD well. \n\nThe gnocchi in house-made tomato cream sauce is so rich in flavor that makes you wonder how light and ethereal it is at the same time. The fettucine alla Ghiotta, tonnarelli alla Capricciosa, are all the familiar Italian flavors combined to become explosive than each ingredient alone.  Fegatini alla Griglia, skewers of chicken liver and smoked bacon on a bed of grilled radicchio is perfect (I suspect they brush the radicchio with bacon fat before grilling because how else would radicchio taste so good!?).  Scottata Milano, thin slices of beef barely cooked, sweet and tender paired with crisp and zesty arugula. \n\nIf you decide to go, watch out for their specials, there will always be a few off-the-regular-and-specials-menu items.  I have had some great grilled petrole sole with arugula pesto sauce, roasted rabbit on creamy polenta, and risotta gamberi made with shrimp stock, safron and orange zest, off the menu. \n\nI read through other less-than-ethusiastic reviews. And I can only say: do not expect tortured food ingredients, or exotic pan-Mediterranean or Italian infused modern Californian cuisine that has pervaded San Francisco (Beretta, Incanto, SPQR, great restaurants that everybody who haven't tried should try).

Parking is really bad as noted by others, but that's not the restaurant's responsibility, and parking is discounted to $7 at one of two lots just a block away, a steal in that neighborhood.\nFood:  OK but not stellar at these prices.  A \"shaved fennel and romaine\" salad ($8.95) was basically just chopped romaine (can easily be much more creative at home) bo-o-oring.  Among other entrees one in our party of six ordered a pasta dish with a very over-reduced cream sauce that made it look and taste like glue.  Another was my lamb chops, although perfectly cooked and tender (if a little cold), 2 small ones served on a large plate garnished with a couple of tiny cauliflower florettes, two cubes of roasted potatoes and one polenta triangle - at $22, it just didn't cut it; needless to say I left the restaurant still hungry, even though I did share an appetizer beforehand.  Another in the party ordered pork medallions with soft polenta, tasty and appealing but under-salted.  Forgot to mention the foccacia and olive oil (served only after we'd finished ordering), the extra-virgin OO was just delicious - high quality.  \nLimited but nice wine list, reasonably priced.\nService:  My partner and I were about 15 minutes late for our 7 o'clock Saturday reservation (parking) but the 4 others were seated already, and even though the table where the 2 of us were to be seated had not yet been cleared and re-set (to be pushed a couple inches over to join the others after I managed to squeeze through to sit on the banquette) no more than mere minutes passed before our server was asking if we were ready to order - we weren't - and this happened several times until we finally gave in to the pressure.  And this type of rushing continued throughout the meal until our entree plates were snatched one by one the instant we had taken our last bite.  One person ordered dessert and others had coffee, and no sooner were those served that the check was promptly dropped on the table.  Not bad service, actually attentive considering that they were busy, but efficiently rushed.  The system is obviously in place to maximize seating and turnover in the small restaurant, as evidenced by the army of servers and bussers milling about - never seen so much staff in such a small restaurant before.\nSo, I hate to ruin the love-fest of the other reviewers, but in my opinion there are plenty of high-quality Italian restaurants in the Bay Area, not counting this one.  Wouldn't go back.\nAnd another thing:  The NOISE LEVEL.  Couldn't hear most of what my friends were saying and had to shout to make myself heard; unbearibly loud.\nBTW, the fleur de sel guy really needs to get a life!!!", "author": "MM L."}

Be prepared for that - no sweaters. \n\nThe waitress was friendly, authentic Italian, but took forever to come over and take our order. We ordered the Antipasto Misto. It was ok, had an olive and tomato salad, roasted red peppers, marinated mushrooms, and frittata, which was probably the best part. We both ordered the Insalata Mista which came out when we still had our appetizer, so we were a little cramped for table space.\n\nThey have a \"fan club\" for their gnocchi and I always debate whether I should get the gnocchi or not when I go out. I've never had great, fabulous gnocchi at a restaurant - always too mushy for me as gnocchi is typically potato-based and should be somewhat firm. It's tough to make - it's easy to overcook. So it was ok, not to die for, although the aurora sauce (cream and red sauce mixed to make pink, ie aurora) was fantastically rich and full of flavor.

After some thorough reading, I settled on Ristorante Milano as they were known for homemade pasta and their menu contained my 2 pre-requisites for an Italian meal:  fetticini bolognese and linguine di mare.\n\nDon't be fooled by Ristorante Milano's somewhat touristy banner, inside it's all comfy, cozy, family italian.  The owner-host, Aldo, will introduce himself, and we even scored the window seat table - all contributing to what I'd say was a 4-5 on the ambiance scale.\n\nWhen it came time to order, I decided on the bruschetta special (which is just your standard issue bruscetta), and the linguine di mare.  My husband went for the fetticini with sausage and cream sauce (momentarily forgetting italian translation.)\n\nBefore our appetizers were served, we were given a large warm foccacia bread basket with olive oil to dip -  immediately my food review started strong.  Unfortunately, though, the bruscetta was slightly lacking, just standard tomatoes on over-toasted bread, which had gotten soggy.  Needed some salt, more olive oil, fresher bread.\n\nLuckily, the linguine TOTALLY redeemed the bruscetta's short-comings.  It was perfectly imperfect, so hand made it even varied in thickness.  The sauce was perfect and the clams and muscles divine.  I only wish they had perhaps offered scallops or crabs as possible shellfish for the pasta.\n\nMy hubby loved his fetticini, and also raved about the home-made pasta.  We both agreed that in our 2 weeks in Italy we only went to 2 restaurants that made their pasta so well!\n\nWould give this place a 5 star if it weren't for the bruscetta, but will definitely be back for the fetticini bolognese and a different appetizer, so don't be surprised if this review soon changes to a 5!", "author": "Casey M."}

They were the consistency of pieces of play dough cut up in small pieces. They were not soft, fluffy  and pillowy as they should be.  Perhaps it was a bad batch.\nI am a Northern Italian and know exactly what Gnocchi should taste like. These were much too heavy and cut up a little too small. It was\nobvious that the cook made the tubes too narrow and then, to top it\noff, cut them sloppily where there were pieces of two Gnocchi still \ntogether. The Gnocchi were over-drenched in a fairly good tomato cream sauce, but the Gnocchi themselves were bland. I had a terrible case of indigestion within 15 minutes of leaving the place and it lasted for several hours. I felt like I had a huge clump of indigestible flour/potato matter stuck in my stomach! The Gnocchi were far  too heavy  and hard to digest. Based on these Gnocchi, I am giving this restaurant one star.  Also, the place has tight seating - so if you don't like others hearing all of your dinner conversations, this is not the place for you.The owner needs to go to \"Bright Smile\" - never saw such yellow, repulsive teeth!!", "author": "Girly Foodie F."}

After I landed in SFO, my fiance drove me up to his favorite little Italian spot on Pacific Avenue. When we first drove by there were still people waiting outside to eat around 9:30pm. When we got to the restaurant around 10pm it seemed like the line had cleared and people were finishing up with their dinners. We were able to get a table right away and immediately munching on their foccasia bread with olive oil. We started with the Insalata Mista and Crostini ai Funghi (bruschetta with sauted mushrooms and gorgonzola cheese) It ain't your typical bruchetta! It was really delicious. The sauted mushrooms and gorgonzola! Brilliant! I opted for lasagna (my usual) and it was really really good. Probably one of the best lasagnas ever! The meat sauce was so good! My fiance got Gnocchi con Salsa Aurora (his usual) and it was also really good. He says that Ristorante Milano has the best gnocchi in the country. It's definitely a hyperbole but we certainly have had our share of gnocchi and lasagna all over the place (including Italy) and I would say it's pretty high up there. Ristorante Milano is definitely a great neighborhood restaurant and wonderful Italian spot away from the touristy Little Italy area.", "author": "Julianne C."}

We walked in without a reservation at 7:30 on a thursday night and were seated right away at a nice table in the back.  In fact, only two of the three of us were there and they allowed us to sit there for 15 minutes waiting and they brought us yummy bread in the meantime.  Finally when our friend arrived the waiter graciously explained an endless list of all wonderful sounding appetizers and entrees.  We ordered the beet salad and prosciutto and fig appetizers and a bottle of wine and were off.  Both appetizers were excellent and my butternut squash ravioli was delicious.  All pastas are made on-site daily.  We had such a nice leisurely dinner with just the right amount of attention from our server, it might be one of my new favorite places in the city.  Our bill for the three of us which included two apps, bottle of wine, additional glasses of wine (we are winos), and three entrees came out to be about 40 dollars each which is pretty great for what we got.", "author": "Lindsay P."}

It was getting annoying after a while. I had  their special of which was polenta topped with seafood in a red sauce, which was absolutely delicious and the appetizer was a ball of mozzarella with assorted tomatoes in olive oil. It was extraordinary. My girlfriends ordered fettuccine with seafood, which one of them indicated that it fresh and was the best fettuccine she'd ever had. I would definitely go back, but I would go somewhere else for their desserts, I was not too impressed of their Profiteroles or their tiramisu. I have had better.

We were sitting outside and the owner came out apologized for the wait and went to get us a complimentary sparkling red wine which was delicious.  Once seated we ordered a nice bottle of a montepulciano  recommended by our waiter which was very good.  We started with the burrata, arugula, fennel salad which was a little bland but with a little salt it was really good.  The Burrata was smooth and delicious.  Then we had the grilled calamari with white cannellini beans which was also a little bland but with a touch of salt was also good.  The calamari was nicely grilled.  We finished with the house made linguine, capers, kalamata olives and anchovies, which was delicious.  I guess we like our food a little salty.

I came here with someone special and it was quite the eventful evening... as we were waiting to be seated, we found that there was a couple who were oddly together.. let's just say a young eastern european escort with a much older mature asian man.  It wasn't just that is was the odd couple, but she walked in with spandex coochie cutters with fishnet hoes, low cut slim fitting top and it was quite the scene when the ENTIRE restaurant was gawking at the couple walking by to be seated.  Back to the food, we sat down (happened to be right next to this \"odd\" couple) and ordered a nice bottle of sangria and our two delicious dishes.  Ristorante Milano first started us with fresh baked bread which seemed like focaccia bread but much softer and oh so yummy dipped in olive oil.  Our order was this delectable pasta dish which I can't remember the name, but it was apparent the noodles were homemade and it was perfect.  It was simmered in a cream sauce and maybe some mushrooms with small bits of meat mixed into the light cream sauce. The cream sauce was Not heavy and it was just so savory to the tongue.  I would definitly order that dish again.  The other dish was a veal dish which was just as savory and had a little side of mushrooms and greens.  Very tastey, but not sure I would order that particular dish again.  Over all, it was excellent.  Now back to the \"odd\" couple... it was funny, when the man walked up from the table... as soon as he left the \"escort\" started to CHOW down on her food... yes, I'm sure it could have been because she was very hungry, god only knows she sure works for it, but at the same respect... a part of me believes she knew how tastey her dish was.", "author": "Jenn C."}

They had a great time and loved the food -- they practically licked their plates clean.  My parents had the Linguine ai Frutti di Mare and the Tonnarelli alla Capriccio.  They both received heaping portions and raved about how tasty their meals were.  I don't think my parents spoke the entire meal, they were too busy eating.  My husband ordered the Lasagna (with a white cream sauce) and I ordered the ravioli.  They were good, but we both kept eyeing my parents' plates.  For dessert, we ordered the Tiramisu and the Pan di Mandorle, which were both delicious.  All in all, had a very enjoyable experience.

The waiter lacked personality and the hostess made no attempt to make up for the late seating with a drink or appetizer.  How is a restaurant Italian without a Cesar salad on the menu?  Almost 40 minutes after placing our order, our food came.  We shared, what looked to be an amazing Dungeness crab salad with a Meyer lemon vinaigrette --- there were two pieces of shell in the salad and the dressing overpowered the crab's taste.  For entres, my friend had the fettuccine with tomato sauce and olives.  She said the noodles were a bit starchy and just OK.  I had the risotto, and was reminded why I prefer to make it at home.  Overly starchy --- they must have not sealed the Arborio rice with oil properly, and the mushroom taste became so bland and repetitive with no other interesting flavors to cut it.

Don't be fooled by the two dollar signs, this place can run you $25+ just for a single dish after tax and tip. The Ravioli del Giorno came with 7 pieces of regular sized bland ravioli... I was expecting a bit more for $16. The $18 Risotto was not much better in terms of taste. The only saving grace was the Fettucine alla Ghiotta and Grigliata Mista which tasted quite good. However I will paraphrase the other reviewer who said the prices are highway robbery. I don't mind paying a lot for good food, but would it kill them to make their portions bigger so customers can feel like they are getting something in return? I don't think it would hurt their already huge profit margins much. The dining area is also ridiculously small and crammed full of tables until there is barely any room to walk around. Just take one look at their so called 'bathroom' (am I on an airplane?) and you will understand. They need to pony up and rent a larger restaurant for the prices they are charging.
