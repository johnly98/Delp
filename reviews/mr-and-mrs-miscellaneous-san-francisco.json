Still had high hopes and decided to give them a shot but I absolutely do not understand this place's high ratings. It's not a bad shop but compared to everywhere else in SF the flavors are limited, the texture is average, the service is below average (our employee looked like he wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of there to a point where my friend and I thought he was upset with us), and they limit the number of items you can taste to 3 items (they also don't warn you about the limit until you've already tried 2).\n\nTheir flavors are a bit on the less sweet side which I prefer. I tried the frosted flakes, Friar Tuck (cinnamon & hazelnut liquor), pomelo, and my friend's chicory coffee & matcha. None of them were overly sweet and usually the tart/bitter flavors come out a bit more which is nice. I settled on the Friar Tuck which was the only flavor I haven't seen elsewhere. Texture-wise the ice cream is average. Firm but not too creamy but at least not overly crystallized either. Just fine.\n\nOverall, Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous does have solid flavors but between the poor experience, limited service, and average textures, I'll opt for one of the other ice cream shops in the city.", "author": "Vivian C."}

The flavors are rotating and fairly unique, but the hours are a bit random. Due to the ever changing menu and minimal social media and web presence, you really don't know what's going to be offered until you get there.\n\nDuring my visit, the flavors were pannettone, eggnog, irish cream, banana, bourbon & caramel, just chocolate, mascarpone, sweet cream, and pumpkin. Scoops start at $5.50 for a single, $8 for a double and $9 for a triple. A cone is an additional $1, and you can only get 1 flavor per scoop. The scoops aren't that large, and if you're already in the shop, you might as well get your money's worth by getting the triple since it's triple the amount at double the price (I'm sure you can find 3 flavors you like).\n\nI tried the pumpkin, bourbon & caramel, panettone and just chocolate, all in a cup. The ice cream has a very creamy texture and a medium firmness to it. The flavors are complex and bold, but not as experimental as some other places. The pumpkin tasted like homemade pumpkin pie, the panettone almost reminded me of eating the classic Italian sweet bread. The chocolate had a rich chocolatey flavor and was slightly bitter. The bourbon & caramel was just sweet and needed some saltiness to balance it out.\n\nThe interior is cleanly decorated with a long communal table and a few smaller tables. The staff is friendly and patient as you explore and sample the menu.

There was peanut brittle, thai tea, cookies and cream, etc. \n\nWe opted for the thai tea ($5.50 single scoop) with a housemade waffle cone (additional $1). The thai tea flavor was pretty good and the cone was tasty however it melts incredibly fast even when it's not that hot out. The bottom of the cone isnt really sealed shut so the ice cream leaks through.\n\nOverall, I keep hearing so many great things so I want to come back and maybe try some other cool flavors.", "author": "Annie N."}

That is until you get distracted by Hard Knox your first go around. Then you go out of your way to make it there again, even if you're in the Castro area.\n\nMaps to get here makes you go the craziest way, but it always works out well. It's on the corner and is somewhat hidden, besides the image of an ice cream cone with about six scoops of ice cream on a cone.\n\nWhen you walk in you realize they don't have air conditioning. It was a particularly warm SF day, think the 80s, so it was warm in here. Stale warm. Tons of people, mostly families, spilled about at all the tables. The one small two top nook was also taken up by a couple, which also lined where a mural image was painted on the wall.\n\nThe ice cream selections for the day didn't really entice me. I tried a few to see how I liked the texture and flavor they offered. I decided to change it up and I went with a sundae with their sweet cream ice cream and added their homemade caramel and toasted almonds. It was actually really good. It was nice to deviate from just a scoop in a cup.\n\nThe homemade caramel is what made it good. It was a bit smokey if that makes sense. I can't quite put my finger on the flavor, but it was really good. The almonds could have been natural for all I cared about, the caramel flavor was good enough. The crunch the almonds provided was perfect.\n\nLil ordered the special of the day, which was essentially their take on Mint Chip. They did also just put out a Matcha Green Tea ice cream while we were there, but I didn't try it. \n\nOverall it wasn't bad and was on par with SF ice cream pricing (which is dumb expensive), but I don't think I'll be heading back here anytime soon. It's near ATT park, but not convenient to get there post Giants game.\n\nToo many options make this one kinda obsolete...", "author": "Steph G."}

Someone in our group said he tried to come on a Friday and there was a line out the door, so definitely recommend coming late afternoon on the weekend to beat the crowds. I was split between the Paradise Tea and the Banana with Dark Rum flavor, so I deferred to the server's recommendation. She said the Banana was a more popular option, so I went with that and upped the WHABOOM with their in-house made caramel. I was so full before that ice cream, but I devoured it and could have ordered another. It was well-balanced and not sweet at all! The caramel complemented the flavor very well (had a caramal apple flavor to it, less sweet, more of that brown sugar, nutty flavor).

Besides the street parking scattered in the area, there is a parking lot area if you go down 22nd Street past the store. \n\nWhat I really like about this place is the unique flavor offerings. There were no overlapping flavors the two times I came here. This may be because the second time it was the weekend of St. Patty's, so they were offering inspired flavors (e.g.: Shamrock Shake, Irish Coffee, Bailey's, Guinness). The downside to this is that you never know exactly what flavors will be available, and they may not have \"classic\" go-to flavors in case you're super picky. But I don't think it should be a problem, because I haven't had a flavor I've hated yet! My personal favorite was the French Lavender (but some people complain it tastes like candles/soap).\n\nOne thing to note is that the ice cream is on the sweeter side, and the store doesn't really have water readily available. They can serve it to you in the little ice cream cups, but with the long lines and the little amount that the cups it can hold, it can be a little inconvenient.\n\nNow ice cream in SF is quite expensive, so I recommend going with a group of friends and getting the triple scoop to share.

They don't have a ton of flavors, but each one is incredibly unique. I sampled the berry brandy, orange blossom, and salted mango. Every one was delicious, but I settled with the orange blossom on a house-made cone. The cone has a freshly made, crunchy texture that puts cake and sugar cones to shame.\n\nFrom a price perspective, this is definitely on the higher end as far as ice cream goes. But given the quality, it's more than worth it.", "author": "Tim X."}

Second, their waffle cone is fresh made and super delicious. Last but not least, you could sample as much as you want. I tried their sweet cream, berry & sour cream, rose and black sesame. I was at first deciding between black sesame and berry sour cream. Eventually I got their berry sour cream since this seems more unique and I was craving for something refreshing. I love how the sour cream did not take over the flavor of the ice cream while keeping fruity ice cream taste buttery. The sour cream def created another flavor texture for the ice cream. I also love their black sesame, you could def taste the seedy flavor. Their waffle cone was amazing. First thing I noticed is that waffle cone was thick enough so it did not break easily. Also you could tell it is a delicious waffle cone by \"smell\" it. The size was just perfect because you did not finish it in a bite while it did not stuff your belly with only cone. The only down side for this place was that it did not have AC so it was steaming hot inside. I guess it made sense so people could finish their ice cream and get otta there since the line was long.

It's not hard to find parking, it's filled with specialty stores such as a winery, art galleries, brewery, and eateries.\n\nIcecream-wise, they use stuarts, which is quality milk. Second, their flavors change all the time. I was able to try different flavors everytime. Their icecream leans toward a bit sweet, which doesn't work for all flavor.

I got a kids scoop which was a fairly generous single scoop at ($4).

Excellent flavors - they occasionally have various asian-inspired flavors, and those are usually some of my favorite. My go-to flavor that they usually have is Malted Milk. Sometimes they have other flavors too like White Sesame / Black Sesame that are some of my favorite.\n\n2. Perfect texture - I like the texture of the ice cream here a lot. It's not really a gooey or melty texture al all - it keeps its shape very well.\n\n3. Consistency of experience - I haven't had a bad experience here!\n\n4. Indoor seating - There's usually enough seating indoors.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. Price - A single scoop is a bit pricy (although it makes sense in San Francisco), which is why my girlfriend and I usually get a triple to share.\n\n2. Hours - The hours here are inconvenient and they're occasionally not open when we're in the area and are thinking about Ice Cream. However, this place is definitely worth a special trip when you're in the area!\n\nTIPS:\n\n1. Check the hours and make sure that they're open before you make the venture.\n\n2.

The girl at the counter said that they make their ice cream in small batches and that when they run out of a flavor, that's when they replace it with a different flavor. I sampled the salted mango and the French lavender. (They used real spoons for the samples.) The lavender was really good - you could definitely taste the lavender flavor. The salted mango wasn't really salty - I couldn't really taste any hint of salt, but I really like the fruity mango flavor. I ended up getting a scoop of the salted mango and a scoop of the black sesame. The texture and consistency of the ice cream was really good. Perfectly creamy - not too icy or soft. The black sesame was good, but not the best black sesame I've ever had.  \n\nI was hoping that they would have earl grey the day I visited.

You're only allowed three samples, sadly, but I guess it's better than nothing?  Between my boyfriend and me, we tasted pink squirrel (like the cocktail, with almond extract!), NOLA-style chicory coffee, burnt sugar, and maybe one other but I'm totally blanking.  We both ended up getting the pink squirrel.  It was awesome on its own, but I ended up adding the house-made citrus rainbow sprinkles for fun - they ended up making things a little too sweet, but I'm not regretful.  I think this ice cream is better than Humphrey Slocombe, but I haven't tried Bi-Rite to compare it to that...\n\nThe shop itself is pretty cute and they had a fun selection of vintage candies - all Halloween themed for the month of October!\n\nThe downside here though are the hours.  They close between 5 and 6 pm every day, which is absurdly early.  And they aren't open on Monday or Tuesday.  Who can go and get ice cream before 6pm on a workday?  It boggles my mind that they don't stay open later at least on Friday and Saturday when I see so many people in this neighborhood for dinner, drinks, etc. In addition, I made a special trip here to surprise a friend one Thursday, leaving work at 5pm to make it before closing time, only to find a note on the door that they randomly weren't open that day.  They are always doing mad business - I can't imagine that they couldn't support longer hours at least a couple of days a week.  Why not open later and close later?  Like, who is getting ice cream at 10am on a Wednesday??\n\nAnyway, I like this place but I wish it was more \"user friendly.\"", "author": "Tay H."}

We walked here after our lunch at Piccino on the kinda warm but breezy Saturday afternoon.  Upon first glance I didn't see too many attractive sounding flavors, but sampled the Pink Squirrel and loved it.  He also sampled the cookies n cream.  I asked the employee what the Pink Squirrel was and she said it originated from the cocktail of the same name with an almond liquor flavor.  And it did taste like it!  Loved it and the creaminess of their ice cream.  We shared a double ($6.50) which was a generous portion.  The ice cream didn't even start to melt until the last little spoonfuls.  \n\nHe asked me if I prefer this over my beloved Bi-Rite, and I said it's a hard choice, but I like the flavor selection more at Bi-Rite, but prefer the creamy texture of Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous more.  He preferred M&MM more.  I believe Bi-Rite is a little cheaper too.

Luckily, the line moved fairly quickly and we had time to decide which of the unique flavors to try. \n\nEarl Grey - tastes exactly like biting into a tea bag, but not too overpowering. Nice, refreshing, and flavorful.\n\nOrange Blossom - reminded me of an orange creamsicle. Orange flavor with a creamy texture.\n\nThai Basil - strong, but surprisingly not overpowering basil flavor. Probably one of their more unique flavors.\n\nThe two ladies behind the counter were nice and efficient, without getting flustered by the giant line of ice cream hungry customers.

In my book, Mr. and Mrs. beats Bi-Rite and its other competitors by the smallest of margins. Drawbacks in the debate for superiority point to the area (Dogpatch) where Mr. and Mrs. is located, the lack of days and hours it is open, and the rotating and unpredictable flavor schedule. Pluses include better parking and more inside seating for those #table4two dates. But the ice cream itself cannot be beat.\n\nThe consistency is perfect, a symphony of creamy, light, and smooth. The texture is to die for. Their flavors come out sharp, but never too overwhelming as in other ice cream spots. And it also doesn't break down icy or melt as fast. When it has added chunks or chips in their flavors, Mr. and Mrs. takes the time to keep those pieces standardly small and uniform. Overall, Mr. and Mrs. takes extra time in their craft to deliver an ice cream that hardly ever disappoints. \n\nSome of the flavors that I have tried and endorse:\n\nBurnt Sugar (Yes, close to caramel, but has the darker tones of actual burnt sugar)\nWhite Rabbit (My Asian folks rejoice. Eat it paper and all)\nSweet Corn (Yummy little bits of corn. Bring floss)\nCalamansi Honey (Sweet and sour gloriousness)\nJasmine Green Tea (Does not have that overpowering green tea flavor)\nand many more...\n\nAnd don't sleep on the little extras. The cookies are pretty darn good, as is the licorice. And if you're feeling adventurous, top your ice cream off with some of that house made hot fudge or caramel.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-11", "description": "REVIEW #1000--Not for myself, but for Mr. & Mrs. Misc--1000 people averaging 4.5 stars can't go wrong!\n\nAdventurous ice cream flavors + cutesy name + catchy storefront painting of towering ice cream in the hip Dogpatch neighborhood--all the ingredients for a place that would make San Franciscans melt.  \n\n[THE BAKERY]\n\nWhen I first walked in, I was surprised that to predominantly find wafts of bakery smells rather than the rich milky smell of a creamery at Bi-Rite and Ici's.  To give the benefit of the doubt, maybe it's all diffused in the heights of the tall warehouse ceiling, or perhaps it is masked by the baking smell.  I was disappointed when I realized that what I thought were samples were really just small pastries for sale.  All the baked goods do look delicious if you somehow have space in your stomach for ice cream AND brittles/cookies.  \n\n[THE CREAMERY]\n\nYelp tells me of wondrous ice cream flavors, but on any day they only serve 8 choices.  (I guess there are only 8 Wonders of the world.)  I guess that decreases the utility for Yelp review such as this one, but before you stop reading, you may want to look at my suggested procedure:\n\n1. Decide what looks good on the menu while in line \n2. Sample 2 of the richer flavors you want to try (so you can try it without getting too full from entire scoops.  As a general rule of thumb, I usually sample anything with caramel because it tastes best in small sample sizes)\n3. Get a double scoop of the lighter flavors you want to try (no need to waste samples; if it sounds good, chances are it is good)\n4. Eat the top scoop quickly so you don't look like a fatty that got a double scoop\n\n[THE FLAVORS]\n\nThe flavors are indeed quite Miscellaneous and playful.  \n\n(+) The JASMINE GREEN TEA is understandably popular, and I would imagine it to be particularly so in tea fanatics who are secretly craving boba and find themselves at a pricey ice cream parlor instead.  I know saying this goes against my people, but I find the jasmine green tea ice cream to be the epiphany in the latest trend towards creamas/milk foams/sea salt things--a perfected remake of the jasmine milk tea.  The tea flavor is so good that it tastes more like tea than the actual milk tea of those dismal powder-powered chain boba shops (i.e. Lollicup, TapEx, Quickly's).  \n\n(+) The PISTACHIO MASCARPONE (the two go surprisingly well together) and FLAN (description included something with caramel) are tasty, though these belong in the sampling category because they are so rich I'd probably feel sick after whole scoops.  \n\n(+/-) The VANILLA BEAN is as boring as it sounds; instead I suggest the CHOCOLATE CHIP which is vanilla ice cream with chocolate chips.  \n\n(-) The alcoholic ones are not alcoholic enough.  I've tried the LEMON CAMPARI (which has delightfully strong lemon of kid-made lemonade) as well as the KAHLUA CREAM (which had a strong coffee flavor that could have been mistaken for Vietnamese iced coffee in a blind taste test), but neither were very alcoholic.  (Or maybe the City just makes strong drinks so now alcoholic ice cream is weak in comparison)\n\n(-) My friend got the GRASSHOPPER, which is a hipster name for mint chocolate chip.  Anecdotally in our case study with n=1, we report that the grasshopper seemed to melt faster because we both ate our ice cream at the same spot at similar rates, only the grasshopper melted way faster and it got all over her hand and got blown into her clothes.  \n\n[THE CONES]\n\nI was excited to try the HOUSEMADE SUGAR CONE because I was unimpressed with Bi-Rite's generic cones and I horribly miss the artisan-swirl-chocolate-filled cones from Ici's in Berkeley.  I had high hopes in my extra $1, but the ROI was not great because there wasn't much unique about the cone except that it got uniquely soggy.  I'm sure it would be quite good on its own, but like the low-melting-point grasshopper, they need to do a bit of materials engineering work.\n\nSurprisingly, the REGULAR CONE was better than the specialty housemade sugar cone because it did not get soggy, plus it does not cost extra. More $ saved means more scoops P:\n\n[MISCELLANEOUS TIPS]\n\n- Prices are exact change!!!  No fumbling with an awkward handful of coins while simultaneously juggling a melting ice cream cone and having no hands to take a picture.\n- $3.50 half scoop, $4 single scoop, $6 double scoop, $8 triple scoop... expensive, but worth it once in awhile, especially if you still have a lot of flavors to be tried.\n- Creaminess is average, meaning you can probably finish a double scoop if you had lunch awhile ago and you go with my strategy of sampling rich flavors and getting lighter ones.\n- Parking in the immediate area is annoying, but if you go further into the residential area it is not impossible.\n- There is a decent amount of seating with 2 large communal tables and a small side table.  It gets busy on weekends, but people usually leave after they finish their ice cream (quite fast because it's so tasty)", "author": "Edna C."}

Sure thing!\n\nI've had Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous on my radar for a few years. We don't venture out to Dogpatch very often, but finding ourselves here on a sunny Sunday I was 100% ready to give it a go. \n\nThey have a ton of unique flavors here and I gladly sampled around 4 of them. They rotate flavors fairly often, so it is likely that they won't have the same flavors the next time you go in. I settled with a kid's scoop of Orange Blossom in a sugar cone and my bf had a scoop of sweet cream. I really loved the hint of floral orange blossom throughout the ice cream. It was perfectly nuanced and not too fragrant. It was, however, cloyingly sweet. I don't have a huge sweet tooth to begin with, so maybe it's just me, but the sugar level was overpowering to the point that I didn't want to finish the ice cream, save for the fact that it was keeping me cool on a 70+ degree day. Notably, all of the ice creams I sampled and the taste I had of my bf's scoop confirmed that all the ice creams lean heavily on the sweet side. \n\nSo, overall? Fantastic selection of quirky and traditional flavors. Would I go again? Maybe, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If you're in the hood and need a sweet treat, stop on by.", "author": "Liz G."}

We parked right next to the place. \n\nATMOSPHERE: your typical trendy ice cream store with long wooden tables that are kind of squished so it's hard to squeeze in sometimes. There's actually a good amount of seating compared to most small ice cream stores. They have the blackboard menus and other goodies like cookies and flavored licorice. \n\nFOOD: I was sad they didn't have the brown butter or mint flavor so I got cookies and cream but I also tried my moms earl grey and it was good. I like the tea flavor which reminded me of green tea. Very refreshing. I have to admit though, their cream is more creamy than I prefer and slightly sweeter too so it wasn't as icy and refreshing and scoops. Their flavors are pretty unique but overall I wasn't super impressed. My sister who is allergic to dairy was excited that they had sorbets but apparently you have to buy it by the half pints instead, you can't get it by the cone or cup. \n\nAlso, the kiddie cup was the perfect size for me.  It's basically one round ice cream scoop.\n\nOverall not bad but it didn't fit the bill in terms of ice cream I prefer.", "author": "Brittany T."}

Perfect for devouring ice cream on a cold day and drawing the envy of passerby as they stare through the floor-to-ceiling windows. \n\nIt sounds like the flavors rotate seasonally, or whenever the owners decide to experiment with new ingredients, but there are safe choices like Sweet Cream for the less adventurous sweet-toothed. I tried the Maple Black Pepper and Misugaru (originally a Korean drink powder with roasted rice, barley, soy, and red bean) before settling on the Misugaru since I love the subtle toastiness of rice and barley. Other flavors currently in stock are Sesame Rose, Eggnog, Pumpkin, and Almond Butter. I resisted the urge to sample all the flavors... If you're feeling like your dessert was especially hard-earned today, go for a sundae or root beer float. Cookies and other sweets available at the counter also. \n\nToppings like whipped cream and sprinkles are available for $1 each (eh...), and you can get your ice cream in a waffle cone for no extra charge. But if you ask for the homemade cones (which always seem to run out), it's an extra $1 as well. A single scoop is $4, making Mr. and Mrs. kinda pricey, and forcing you to buddy up with someone if you want to meet their $5 min for card requirement. \n\nThe line moved efficiently thanks to three employees handling the counter. Seating was a little tight: two rows of black tables set up cafeteria style with short stools on either side. A few smaller tables scattered along the sides can be yours if you get the timing right. \n\nI totally fell in love with this area of SF when we came here and will be back for sure if I'm in Dogpatch.", "author": "Helen S."}

It's still no Salt & Straw - a must if you're in Portland and they offer at Joan's on Third in LA but not quite the same.  However, Mr. & Mrs. exceeded my expectations.  Let me just say that I like my ice cream creamy, buttery thick, smooth, and made from scratch!  None of that icy frozen stuff please.  \n\nBelow is my rough rankings for all the ice cream spots I've tried thus far in the bay area.  \n\n5 Stars \nMr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous\n\n4-4.5 stars \nBi-Rite\nIci Ice Cream\nHumphry Slocombe \n\n3.5 -4 stars\nMitchell's Ice Cream\nPolly Ann\nSwensen's Ice Cream\nJoe's Ice cream\n\n3 stars\nThree Twins Ice Cream \nSmitten\n\nI came here twice for good measure to ensure it is indeed good, quality ice cream.  It's not quite in the middle of the city which may not be really convenient but parking is definitely easier than dealing with the inner city.  \n\nSo far I've sampled\n- Rosemary Maple: if you love inhaling the smell of rosemary like me, imagine eating it. This is for all you rosemary lovers, it was perfectly sweet and salty along with the amazing scent.\n\n- Grasshopper mint w chocolate pearls - This was definitely a hit, imagine mint chocolate but with crunchy chocolate pearls. It was a great combination together.\n\n- Guanana - Banana & Guava, unexpectedly my favorite flavor there, I really wished they had it there the second time around. For some reason, this weird combination worked really well and I couldn't get enough of it!\n\n- Sweet Cream - A simple flavor that was creamy and sweet.\n\n- Banana w peanut butter - Another great use with banana but I am not a huge fan of peanut butter in my sweets.\n\nThe ice cream is fresh, creamy, and rich in unique flavors that doesn't overpower like Humphry's ice cream. The set up is simple just like their ice cream.  Their use of unique flavors stand out but it is still combined with the simple ice cream flavors.  My only complaint is that I wish they keep a few consistent flavors so the next time I go I know they'll be serving those flavors (guanana hint hint). \n\nThings to know: \n- They let you sample and never give you dirty looks.\n- Get the housemade sugar cone cone! ($1)\n- You get one flavor per scoop, might as well just get double or triple!\n- Pricing: Single - $3.75, Double - $5, Triple $6\n- Parking - There is some metered parking out front or behind the store.", "author": "Cam C."}

I wish they had a website or their fb page was updated with the new flavors! I wished they had longer hours and the line inside was directed a little better. Maybe rearrange the tables?

I'm going to take care of that now.\n\nI often use my lactose intolerance as an excuse to limit my intake on dairy, but on specific Tuesdays and Wednesdays each month that whole \"I can't have too much dairy\"-thing goes right out of the window.  I generally stop off at Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous prior to volunteering at the San Francisco Food Bank located just four blocks away.  Often the reasoning is two-fold.  Why arrive too early inside a massive warehouse waiting for other volunteers to arrive when I could kill time inside a fabulous ice cream shop and have some fabulous ice cream to boot?  If I crunch enough enzyme tablets prior to my visits my lactose excuse simply disintegrates.\n\nI not only love the ice cream here, but everything I've tried has been magnificent whether that be the peanut or almond brittle, the malted milk balls or the crazy Peanut Brittle and Toffee Cookies (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=9uxO9bcwXSjZ5qgjsrQTOg).  I normally like crunchy cookies over soft cookies, but these stand nicely in between with crispy edges and a soft, chewy center of buttery cookie with fabulous peanut brittle and soft toffee melted in.\n\nI've easily tried over twenty of their often-changing ice cream flavors, and over the months I have found a few favorites.  Their Nougat ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=InskBR3E7c-vh42WbKEaeA) was the first flavor I had ever tried.  If ever I experienced love at first bite this was it.  It's basically sweet cream from Marin's favorite Straus Family Dairy with organic pistachios and bits of dried fruit like cherries and apricots. The description is pretty simple, but the flavor was so intense.\n\nI believe their signature Ballpark ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=-4KQDWx35oYwrneUwjSPpQ) was also one of the earlier flavors I tried.  I thought the entire composition was genius, and yes, its components did remind me of things I've had at a ball game.  It's crunched up pieces of chocolate-covered pretzels, chopped peanuts and Anchor Steam beer all mixed within a creamy, rich Straus cream.  Totally awesome!\n\nYesterday, I went all out and had a double scoop consisting of Bourbon & Caramel and Fudge Ripple (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=zcfLTHIT86XD2qmOkW9QSg) since San Francisco enjoyed a rare day of abundant sunshine.  As a whole I thought the two flavors combined very well together.  On their own however I thought the Fudge Ripple easily outflavored the Bourbon & Caramel.  Both flavors use the same delicious sweet cream.  The Fudge Ripple flavor had my tongue dancing though.  Mixed in with the sweet cream was big chunks of rich, gooey chocolate fudge mixed with chopped toasted almonds.  Meanwhile the Bourbon & Caramel was mostly sweet, sticky caramel.  For me anyway the bourbon flavor was a bit too subtle.\n\nAll in all though this is an amazing place for delicious ice cream, and a perfect place to fuel up prior to a Food Bank project.  I'll be back the first week in September.  Can't wait to see what flavors will captivate my taste buds next!!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

They're located in the Dogpatch and offer a wonderful blend of creativity and flavors into their ice cream.  Their shop, run by two people who I presume to be Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous, makes a unique batch of ice cream flavors fresh everyday.  They said that they never have the same flavors on consecutive days because they like to change it up.\n\nI came here with a couple friends on a hot SF day.  I had a scoop of \"Milk and Cookies\" ice cream and I was in heaven.  It tasted exactly like a cross between your childhood dessert and sweet victory, in other words, it was amazing!  The portions were generous and for only $3.50!

There's a few chairs for people to sit and enjoy their ice cream and they even have a bathroom in here if you need to use it. The menu is big so you won't have a hard time seeing what flavors they have and you're even allowed to try out the flavors before you order so yay. \n\nService was friendly, although they don't really give you another ice cream if you have a problem. Like for instance, when my cousins and I were here, we saw a girl fall down and drop her ice cream on the floor. Instead of replacing it, the workers did nothing and the girl ended up eating the ice cream that she had dropped. Yuck. \n\nI got a scoop of their white rabbit ice cream which is condensed milk and white chocolate and it was delicious. My cousins got different flavors of ice cream, and I forgot what they were called, but they enjoyed them so yay on that, too. And older cousin told me that when they run out of one flavor, they'll immediately refill it with another which is smart. \n\nOverall, it's a good place to get ice cream flavors that you can't really get anywhere else.", "author": "Venus L."}

I guess I got lucky in that I went on a day that had chocolate flavor. Right when I paid, I sampled apricot ginger, and French lavender. The other flavors available were Ghost Chili and Shochu, Buttermilk and Blackberries, Cookies & Cream, Vanilla, French Lavender, Apricot Ginger and a few others that you might see in the uploaded pic.\n\nSampled the apricot ginger and that  was very good. Perfect for those into delicate natural fruit flavors.\n\nAlso tried a little French lavender....freakin SEXAY. I'm a dude and while I don't love lavender as much as many dudettes out there, I have to say lavender ice cream is quite ass kicking in SF. I can't say whether Bi Rite's Honey Lavender was better or this...but they're very close.\n\nChocolate malted crunch....this looked and sounded good. It was decent but as someone who grew up on Dreyer's Rocky Road and Haagen Daaz Chocolate Chocolate Chip, this did not floor me like the jasmine green tea ice cream.\n\nSo with that in mind, I got lucky in that I found a flavor I absolutely adored, and it happened to be available when I was there. Who knows, maybe it won't be again when I visit next time.\n\nThe Jasmine green tea ice cream....oddly enough after eating a few spoons, I could close my eyes and imagine myself at Yum Cha, partaking in dim sum. Maybe not Koi Palace, but some uber high end Michelin star place.\n\nWhat if they could make a cha siu bao ice cream, a ha gow shrimp dumpling ice cream, and a beef cheung fun with soy sauce ice cream, as well as a turnip/daikon cake with Chinese sausage, Chinese ham, dried scallops ice cream.

I had heard about Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous through a variety of channels and have been excited to try their ice cream and cookies for a while.  On a Saturday afternoon visit, there weren't many cookie varieties left, so I opted just for ice cream.  They had several fun flavors (i.e. Earl Grey, Old Fashioned, Basil Chip...), and I opted for Pink Squirrel, which consists of almond flavoring (and something else, that I don't remember).  Nevertheless, it was good. \n\nI was initially excited about the Old Fashioned, but the ice cream itself was plain and the only good part of it was the bourbon soaked cherries.\n\nI'm definitely planning a trip back!", "author": "Audrey C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-02", "description": "The Mr & Mrs Miscellaneous were in the house!\nScooping up the ice cream to the hungry line of customers. I've never been to their shop before so I made a special trip on the Metro (T-line) to 3rd & 23rd and walked one block back - in this neighborhood there are not alot of pedestrians and I passed a few of the local brothers hanging out. \n\nAmbiance: Very spare, just white walls inside with a big wall of glass windows facing 3rd street letting the stream of light come in. Two rows of country wood tables with seats so people can enjoy their ice cream indoors communal-style. This invites chatting with your neighbors and comparing flavor preferences.\n\nThe Line: I was lucky I hit the shop around 3:30pm when there were less than a dozen people but there was someone who was picking up multiple pints to take away and each pint is handpacked. A few minutes after me there was a swarm of people so the line went out the door.\n\nFlavors: You have your traditional Vanilla, Chocolate, White Rabbit in addition to more exotic experimental flavors like Lime Chile. From other reviews sounds like they change their flavors everyday. I sampled two flavors which I ultimately ended up getting: Chicory Coffee and Black Lychee Tea. First off: the ice cream finishes very clean. There is no heavy, artificial residue taste in your mouth after you savor a bite. The Chicory Coffee was very nice with the chicory giving the ice cream an elusive sweetness complimenting the coffee taste. The tea flavor tasted like you were having a concentrated mouthful of pure tea.\n\nThe Mrs. served me at the counter and she was so sweet! Considering that there is a constant stream of customers, it's nice to have someone who exudes such genuine delight in serving their product. I had tasted Mr. & Mrs. Misc ice cream at an event and I mentioned this to the Mrs. She smiled and chatted with me for a minute or two and was patient enough to let me try my two samples before deciding. I could have asked to sample more but that's greedy huh?\n\nBe warned! When you make it to the counter to order, you are faced with a row full of goodies. There are canning jars large ($14) and small ($7) with their homemade peanut brittle. There's a cake dome with homemade toffee peanut brittle cookies ($2.50) and there are small canning jars with a variety of sprinkles or other toppings for ice cream. All so tempting. I picked up one of the small paper sacks of their homemade malted peanut butter balls ($4.50) which looked really tasty and I couldn't pass up.\n\nGood karma for me as I collected my double scoop of ice cream ($5) 'cos a tiny school-style table in the corner opened up. I snabbed it and was entertained watching the parade of couples, groups and families ordering and consuming their ice cream. When a couple sat down opposite me, I chatted with them since I spied the lady holding a jar of the peanut brittle. \"Is it buttery?,\" I ask. \"Yes, it's delicious and I can eat the whole jar in one sitting!\" says the lady. I pulled my bag of malted balls a little closer to me as she eyed my treats and says she can inhale these candies just as quick.\n\nFor sure when you are without a car, Mr. & Mrs Misc. is a bit of an effort to get to in the Dogpatch. But it is accessible by public transit (either the T-Metro or the last stop of the 22-Fillmore which is 2 blocks away). The ice cream is fresh, creative and obviously a labor of love for these two.

I came from Salumeria, around the Mission, on a blistering hot day and was expecting some amazing ice cream as the perfect cool down desert, but I was underwhelmed in all honesty. When I first arrived, there was luckily no line so I felt free to try some flavors. I tried the olive oil, cake & cream, old fashion, salted mango, and almond butter & honey. Of those 5, I could only taste 2 distinctively (salted mango & almond butter). Thinking that the Old Fashion had the coolest components, I decided to get a single of it. I was wrong.. The entire cup of ice cream completely lacked flavor besides when I ate an actual cherry! I tried REALLY hard to taste the orange and bourbon and such, but nothing came to.. I will admit, the texture was suuuper creamy and fulfilling, but it was just all cream with no flavor /: My friend ordered a salted mango, and it was far better, though. I was actually able to taste it and the texture was again, very delightful. I would say the \"salted\" part isn't as blatant as the mango, it's more of a slight after-taste (not in a bad way). It was honestly very reminiscent of Polly Anns mango ice cream with just a hint of saltiness. \n\nOverall, I would just rather go to Bi-Rites.. The amount you get for you pay isn't the most worth it, and the flavors aren't very apparent, or there at all..

I love how out of the way their Dogpatch location is because it allows me to visit a part of the city that I rarely get to enjoy. I usually come on a Friday afternoon right before dinner (high five for dessert ruining your appetite for dinner!) , and parking has been a breeze. There's never a wait like Bi-Rite, but that has nothing to do with the quality of the ice cream here, I assure you. Perhaps I have great luck, or I have great timing...maybe both?\n\nThe flavors in rotation are creative, and there are plenty of them. I've been here only a handful of times but I see different flavors on the handwritten menu each time. They use Straus milk, which I love, and the butterfat content is lower than other shops, allowing two scoops to settle down faster in your tummy than if you were to consume that amount at, say, Mitchell's. I like convincing myself that there's less guilt if I'm going to be a baby piggy on my cheat day. Everything I have tried so far has been very memorable (that in itself is pretty amazing, don't you think?) but I REALLY loved the Black Lychee Tea, Banana Toffee, Honey Lavender, and Eggless Buttermilk Lime. I have yet to try the elusive Pink Squirrel, but I'm sure my timing will be right one of these days. It might bother some, but I also really like the communal tables; there are two of these long tables, and it wouldn't hurt to check out what your neighbor has in his/her cone so you can try that flavor next time.\n\nOh, and by the way, beware of the nice brunette who works there on Friday afternoons.

You've got Neighbor Bakehouse cranking out croissants and other pastries that'll lift your spirits even on the gloomiest of days. (Not that there's a lack of sunny days in the 'patch). There's Third Rail that'll provide more spirits (and some mean beef jerky and cocktails). La Fromagerie makes the best cheese sandwiches in town (bonus: served by a lovable French staff).\n\nBut really, Mr. and Mrs. is reason enough to plan a trip. It's my favorite ice cream in the city and possibly the entire Bay Area. As a loyal Berkeleyan, I'm sorry Ici. Your cones are still genius and unbeatable. \n\nThe flavors at Mr. and Mrs. are handwritten and seem to be slightly different each time I pay a visit. I've had their pumpkin, brown butter, black sesame, chocolate chiffon, and sampled others. They even have a fernet flavor on occasion to the ecstasy of local San Franciscans.\n\nThe ice cream texture is unbeatable, the flavor delightful, and the wait completely reasonable (major points on Birite here). \n\nUltimately the final test is the ice cream happiness factor. My state of mind before, during (especially), and after (did not feel grossly full or saturated in sugar and fat) all of my Mr. and Mrs. experiences was that of pure elation.\n\nDefinitely get over here guys.", "author": "Sydney M."}

Their lighter flavors (the first three, for example) easily top my list, with their sweeter ones coming in at a close second, though possibly too sweet for some. Texture-wise, their ice cream is spot on: neither too hard nor too soft, melting in your mouth juuuust right.\n\nPro tip: come with a non-germaphobe friend and order a double or triple scoop to share and save!

The great thing here is that the sesame flavor comes with milk chocolate flakes which reminds me of Thrifty/Rite Aid's chocolate malt krunch ice cream.\n\nI also tried the Root Beer which has a really different consistency from the other flavors that day.  It was much more dense and the root beer flavor doesn't hit you until the end and only very lightly.  My friend who used to work at a gourmet ice cream shop said this was a difficult flavor to turn into ice cream and I can see why.  The flavor just doesn't stay as potent from the bottle to ice cream.\n\nThey also have other goodies here like homemade brittle, brittle cookies, chocolate chip cookies, and licorice (sour mango was delish!).  Ice cream may be the product choice when coming here (obviously) but the peanut brittle and toffee cookie one of the best cookies I've had.  They make them really flat and chewy--my favorite style!  I was really sad because I left half on the table at home and my dad ate it.  \n\nI like the big communal tables but the line doesn't make too much sense.  You go all the way to the ice cream to sample and put in your order.  Then you have to walk backwards a little to pay but you run into other people who are going forward in the line.  That needs to get fixed for crowded days.  Another thing to fix are the spoons which kept snapping in half when my friends tried to scoop a little out of their cup.\n\nIn the SF ice cream realm, there's definitely some stiff competition but I like the direction of adventure they take here with other flavors like salted mango but also being able to make the traditional favorites (peppermint, cookies 'n cream) really well.

They described the chocolate as \"molten.\" And it beat Bi-Rite, Fenton's, Mitchell's, and the others.\n\nI really wanted to taste it, and it landed on my bucket list of food places to try. I never happen to be in that part of SF, but I recently had a little time before I needed to pick up my dog at the vet. \n\nAnd what the hell?! They had no chocolate ice cream on their menu that day. I sampled the other flavors, but a chocophile like me doesn't get real excited by Vanilla, Violet, Caramel, Banana Graham, Malted Milk, Chicory Coffee, and the other non-chocolate flavors they had. Sheesh.\n\nSo the guy behind the counter suggested the hot fudge, which was an okay idea, but really not what I'd had in mind. I also sampled a Chocolate Peanut Butter Malt Ball, which was different, but was too sweet for me. *sigh*\n\nThe hot fudge was thick and pretty good, but wasn't really doing it for me. It tasted chewy like it had caramel in it, which was interesting. I think fudge is a pretty subjective thing, and I really was there for the ice cream. The missing chocolate ice cream. *sigh*\n\nThe guy spooning out the samples was extremely pleasant, and had just come inside from a cigarette break. Unfortunately the samples were affected by the smoky scent that lingered on him. He recommended that I call ahead first, if I want to be sure to arrive on a day that they offer chocolate. If I return, I'll be sure to call first. \n\nI remembered reading that their cookies were quite good, and they looked delicious. This is a Yelp friend's photo of a cookie that convinced me to try one, not a cookie from the day I was there. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YzA3ocJ0XvsTuD18qr2ctg?select=zcfLTHIT86XD2qmOkW9QSg#2527PMpJhisHCCqqaCYAwA I bought the Dark Chocolate & Peanut Butter Cookie.

Some of the areas with businesses for eats can be a hit or unfortunately, a miss.  \n\nWith a few places of great dining (mainly hole-in-the-wall places), I do enjoy working in the industrial Dogpatch and Bayview/Hunter's Point Area (Third St.). \n\nIn my car and using my cadaver dog nose, I can smell the freshly baked ice cream cone mixture being cooked at this ice cream parlor on the corner of Third and 22nd Street. \n\nNormally, I would eat my ice cream in a little cup or straight from a pint or gallon container. But the smell of the freshly baked cone has lured me to eat it from a cone...even in my gangster-like business suit.\n\nThe ice cream shop has ten different daily flavors. I had a scoop of Croquatino and a scoop of Buttermilk Blueberry for $3.75 in a freshly-cooked cone for an additional $.50. The Croquatino is very similar to the popular Butter Pecan with a caramelized hazelnut and caramel sauce. The Buttermilk Blueberry has a nice creamy taste of Buttermilk with fresh blueberries. The freshly-made cone made a \"huge\" difference. Most ingredients are organic and the dairy is made from Straus Creamery. And the place is Eco-friendly too with biodegradable items...a huge plus!

I love Bi-Rite's artisanal creaminess and admire Mr. Slocombe's audacious flavor palette. But Mr. and Mrs. M. feels more life-size in their approach to their homemade, organic ice cream. They've been open for only two months, and I can somehow relate to the owner couple - a smiling Asian woman and a mustachioed tattooed guy in a knit cap - scooping up the samples. It appears that ten flavors are offered daily here (see photo), and unlike Humphry's head-scratching sensory combinations, they all sound pretty darn scrumptious. \n\nJamie W. and I both went for double scoops since that was the only way to try two flavors successively. Both of us were drawn to their obvious signature flavor, Ballpark, which blends Anchor Steam-infused ice cream with peanuts and chocolate pretzel sticks into a sweet-savory frenzy of flavor. For our second scoops, he went for the Pralines & Cream, a can't-miss combination for any caramel lover, while I dove into the Candied Ginger, which really defied my expectations of a spumoni-like confection with its pops of gingery flavor (see photos). \n\nOther sweets abound here from hot fudge and butterscotch sauce to put on your ice cream to the brittle sold by the jar on the counter (see photos) to fudgesicles and floats. All of these goodies are served in a cavernous space, clean and white, with plenty of seating should you want to park it while you lick (see photo). This space strikes me as a lot more kid-friendly than the other fashionable ice cream shops probably because Dogpatch is a relatively more affordable neighborhood. Take advantage and take the trip down here. It's well worth the journey. \n\nICE CREAM - 4 stars...delicious flavor combinations that stay life size \nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...nice, cavernous place to hang for a bit \nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very friendly and low-key \nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely a contender in SF's ice cream wars", "author": "Ed U."}

It's a pretty large space for an ice creamery, with quite a bit of seating, and a very sterile feel to it.\n\nUnfortunately, our negative experience started upon walking in. My girlfriend and I came in, happily anticipating some good ice cream... but it didn't seem like the three ladies there cared that we were customers. We literally stood at the counter, a few feet away from all three ladies, and NO ONE noticed us. They kept talking for a good while, never even looking at their shop or noticing two customers are there. Well, one lady finally made her few steps to the register to ask how we were and to take our order. Problem was, for the beginning of that time, she was still talking to the other two, so my girlfriend and I kind of just stared and waited... and waited...\n\nTheir flavor menu at the time was pretty lackluster. I don't think it was worth ordering the two scoops, nor worth it to make the trek out to their destination. With the way they treated us, I'd pass...", "author": "Kevin J."}

I thought I had tried all the good ice cream places in SF (Bi-Rite, Swensen's, Mitchell's, Humphrey Slocombe, Ice Cream Bar, Smitten, etc.), but I was wrong! This has now become my 2nd favorite ice cream place in SF behind Bi-Rite.\n\nLocated on an unassuming street corner in the Dogpatch (across the street from Serpentine & Hard Knox), Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous is worth a drive or bus ride out to the area. My friends and I got here around 2-3pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there were only a couple people in line. Everything on the menu looked delicious, so I naturally had to sample multiple flavors. Here are the ones we ended up getting and sampling:\n\n*Salted Mango (5 stars - junior cup for $2.75): SO GOOD. This was the flavor I got, and every bite was DELICIOUS. The ice cream was not salty, but the salted nature did a great job of complementing the sweet mango flavor so that every bite had the perfect amount of sweetness.\n\n*Birthday Cake (bf gave this 5 stars): Sweet cream ice cream with chocolate cake and sprinkles? Who can resist! I tried some of this and thought it was super tasty. And the bf was in love with this.\n\n*Bananas Foster (friend had this): My friend really enjoyed this. If you're a banana fan, you'll love this because it's a great banana ice cream with additional butter/brown sugar/cinnamon in it to give it a nice, sweet kick.\n\n*Dark & Stormy (sampled this): Say what?? YES, this is actually ice cream that tastes like the alcoholic dark & stormy. Not sure if I'd order a whole cup of this on my own, but it was quite tasty and it sure tasted like the drink!\n\n*Chocolate Chip Cookie (3 stars): This was an actual cookie, not an ice cream. This was the only thing that I wasn't crazy about. I liked that the chocolate chunks were evenly spread throughout the cookie, but overall the cookie was too buttery for me.\n\nI will definitely be back very soon because I loved the ice cream I ate, and there's so much more to try! The flavors supposedly change daily, and they even change the menu slightly throughout the same day (dark & stormy was not on the menu when I first arrived, but it appeared 15 mins later). To add to that, the staff is nice, they have lots of tables to sit/chat, and I love that they give generous scoops!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Definitely my favorite flavor\n- Burnt Sugar: there's something about burnt sugar I will always love. Reminds me of my childhood when I would burn sugar on a metal spoon. So good.\n\nService:\nI found it oddly funny that both the servers had pony tails or long hair in a bun.

The whole vibe is minimalist, but the ice cream is on point. Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous has homemade flavors that rotate, according to my friend. The day I was there, I tried the honey-roasted peanut, creme fraiche, and cookies and cream.\n\nThe tasting policy is limit 3 per customer which I was slightly disappointed in, but with the limited staff on hand it is easy to see why the policy is in place. Luckily I came at a slower time, so the wait wasn't long, but shortly thereafter, the line extended out the door. Whew! Dodged a bullet on that one.\n\nHoney-roasted peanut definitely gave the impression of really eating those peanuts...I think I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't be able to eat an entire cup. Cookies and cream were on par with many cookies and cream ice creams at similar joints (so it was good, yes). \n\nI ended up getting a small cup of the creme fraiche which was sweet, but not overly so. Being creme fraiche, the flavor was actually kind of...tart? Also buttery. The high fat content was also reflected in the texture of the ice cream, which was very creamy, but with small chunks of fat throughout. The high fat content was off-putting towards the end of the cup, leaving my mouth coated.\n\nIf I was in the area, I would definitely come again. I'm curious what other flavors they have in their rotation. Keep in mind that parking can be difficult, and depending on where you park, kind of sketch. There are a lot of warehouses nearby, and I'm not sure I'd want to be walking alone through that area. On the other hand, in the other direction, there's a cute little residential neighborhood, so YMMV.", "author": "Denise C."}

I've had great luck the last couple of times with no line and flavors that are more suited to my palate. Get thee to MMM right now and order the Sweet Cream. Simple, pure white creaminess that will make you cry and sing praises to Jesus. Also get the Basil Chip--basil ice-cream with tiny crunchy flakes of chocolate. An amazing combination that works brilliantly. Cardamom lovers: The Chai Tea was designed for you.\n\nThat is all.\n\n................................................................\n\n\"Where can I find adventurous ice-cream flavors?\" was one of the first questions I asked when I arrived in SF. I was envisioning bacon, onion and all the \"hippie\" flavors that had grown to become my favorite like saffron, olive oil and basil. Everyone told me to check out Mr. and Mrs. Misc.\n\nOkaaayyyy, so first time was kind of a bust. Lines out the door and my friends not willing to wait that long. I told them they could go on with their day and I'd wait. I waited 5 more minutes before I decided it just wasn't worth it to bake under the hot sun for what looked like completely unexciting flavors.\n\nSecond time, it was decidedly less crowded and I was with a friend who wanted ice-cream too. For some reason, one of the guys at the counter singled me out over all the people in front of me and gestured me over to be served. So yay for not having to wait in line! He let me try the Earl Grey Tea, Bourbon and Peanut Brittle and the Fernet Branca. The latter two were decent, but not something I'd buy an entire scoop of--I'm not fond of anise as a flavoring agent in desserts and I could barely taste the bourbon. So I went with the Earl Grey, another one of those subtly sweet \"herb/spice\" flavors I love so much. It was creamy and refreshing, if not a little too icy.\n\nOverall, I'd give MMM a try if you happen to be in the area, the flavors appeal to you and there isn't a huge wait. Otherwise, my pick will always be Bi-Rite whose flavors like basil, honey lavender and creme fraiche make me giddy.", "author": "Josephine L."}

Not as long as BiRite but it can be a long wait. The boos and I were so eager to eat some ice cream only to find out that there's no chocolate ice cream anywhere on the menu. And they ran out of mint with choc pearls right when we ordered. Seriously? I believe that regardless of how awesome an ice cream place is, if there's no vanilla or chocolate, then that really cuts the population of ice cream goers in half. Vanilla and chocolate are staples! Yes, I really love the creativity and variety of different flavors that are created here but I really wanted something basic and simple, like a scoop of chocolate ice cream on a sugar cone. Disappointed, I opted for the lemon poppy seed and the earl grey. \n\nBoth were really good with quality flavors and the portions were generous so that's a plus. Reasonably priced and staff were helpful, this place really has good tasty ice creams but due to the crowdedness and poor flow of the interior-there seems to be a lot of space but not really when it gets crowded and people have to maneuver through the line just to exit (think fire escape) that puts it in the 3.5 stars range for me.", "author": "Laurel P."}

It's frustrating that they don't have a website that lists the day's flavors.  The only flavors that were at all appealing to me were chocolate and chocolate chip.  I tried both and both were bland and pretty flavorless.  I felt like I had to order something after sampling so I had a kid's scoop of the chocolate with hot fudge. The hot fudge was good, I'll give them that, but it was a fairly stingy portion especially since it was a full $1.  Once the hot fudge was gone, the rest of the ice cream was tasteless and I threw it out.  I also tried a chocolate chip cookie and that was really good (warm, soft, chewy and with lots of high quality chocolate).  I would have given 2 stars if not for the cookie.

At one point I thought I was eating some sort of caramel ice cream.\n\nChicory Coffee -  STRONG! A couple spoonfuls and you'll feel like you've just drank a strong cup of coffee.

The Peanut Brittle & Brown Sugar cookie was amazing! Perfectly chewy & sweet. There should be an ice cream flavor based off that cookie! Do it, MMM! It would be a hit ;)\n\n*Couple of tips:\n-Street parking\n-Fast service (No line!)\n-We observed that as soon as a flavor ran out, they immediately replaced it with an all new one!

With the exception of their eclectically fashion forward staff. They have other tasty decadent alternatives, cookies and chocolate but I'm here for the ice cream. \n\nI got to try the following flavors:\n\nCookies and Cream (no picture just sampled)\nWhite Russian w/ Valrhona Chocolate Crispy Pearls and their Notorious Pink Squirrel: (http://instagram.com/p/Yi3sh0nh4t/)\n\nC and C, was straight forward. Smooth and creamy, not too sweet and the cookie crumble is balanced all in a single spoon serving.\n\nThe White Russian is invariably the tasty but inverted perversion of what an interracial love story would be. Burlesque and milky, topped with a chocolate \"pearl necklace\" and having to discover crispy notes at the very end.\n\nI know, that description is vivid... maybe a bit too vivid for some folks *awkward*.\n\nOverall, for $6.00 I think it was a splendid visit.

It was very good and different than any other ice cream I've probably had. We also got the peanut brittle which had been so talked about and it is really good.  It came in an old school glass bottle too which went with the whole decor of the place. \n\nI look forward to coming back and trying out some new flavors next time.", "author": "Blake B."}

I dared not try yesterday, but was drawn to the unique selection of ice cream flavors.  I sampled the black lychee tea flavor, which definitely tasted heavy with black tea.  I also sampled the bitter lemon flavor and decided to order a children's size scoop on a cone.  The bitter lemon ice cream had bits of lemon peel which added great texture and taste.  The other half got his usual cookies and cream.  Other friends got scoops of black sesame and peppermint.  I'd say that the children scoop ($3.75) is enough to get your fill.

It might sound weird, but on a clear and windy SF day, this really hit the spot for me. The subtlety of the sweetness and brown butter makes it something you can just keep eating and enjoying without even think about it.\n\nCandied Ginger - This one was a bit creamier and sweeter. The ginger flavor is great and comes through at the end. It leaves a slightly tingling aftertaste. My personal favorite of the day and I'm bummed I didn't get a scoop of this for myself.\n\nBrunt Sugar - They aren't joking around when they name their ice creams.

This might just be an indicator of my personality that I can get bored of things quickly, but here me out. I used to love Bi-Rite and their coffee toffee/roasted banana, but now it's just all right. Their menu hardly changes and I guess I just grew tired of it. At Mr. and Mrs. the surprise factor is somewhat exciting. \"What's their gonna be today?\" \n\nHard to have a favorite when I can only get them once, but if I had to pick it'd be the Crema Catalana.

The two workers were pretty casual and kind of just waiting for customers, or something.  \n\nWhen my boyfriend and I arrived, since it was our first time, we took a second to look at the flavor offerings.  The guys did not offer to help make a recommendation or say a thing.  We asked about one particular flavor, asking for some insight/ recommendations, and the guy just said, \"i like it.\"  We took it as that he didn't want to talk.  Other Yelpers mentioned that they were generous with samples, I guess I came on the wrong day.  Oh well, we ordered a single scoop, and a peanut brittle cookie, to go (total $6).\n\nThe ice cream was a bit on the frozen side.  When I told my friend about it, she said that this was very unusual, as she never encountered this before.  In fact, it was so frozen that I broke both of the biodegradeable spoons while trying to eat it.  Now that just seems kind of outrageous.  The flavor and texture of the ice cream, once thawed out a little, was fine.  It's creamy and pretty smooth (but not as smooth as Smitten-that's for sure).\n\nThe cookie was chewy and not brittle, but caramel-y.  It has a unique texture that is unlike any other cookie I've had before.  Both my boyfriend and I appreciated trying it, as it was something new.  But we also agreed that it just wasn't really for us.  It was enjoyable, but I probably wouldn't pick it again.\n\nOverall, it was a fine dessert adventure.

A very nice, industrial look. \n\nMy young daughter steps up to the counter to order from the very nice, tattooed lady behind the register. My daughter recently got hurt and has a little bandaid right next to her left eye. The nice lady exclaims, \"nice face tattoo.\" And all I can do is giggle (in my mind) and think to myself, \"welcome to San Francisco!\"\n\nSo what about the ice cream, you ask? It is delicious. The cookies 'n cream was loved by the little kids. The chocolate malted crunch took me back to my childhood, with reminders of Rite-aid ice cream. The jasmine green tea ice cream was a definite hit - full of flavor and so refreshing. So thanks Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous for starting off our SF trip so well!", "author": "Angela T."}

As someone who doesn't eat much ice cream other than the occasional grocery store tub, this was indeed a real treat.  Prior to stopping in I was asking my friend what all the hype was about. He said that it just tasted fresher, but had difficulty finding the right adjectives to describe it.  Yeah, I can't really describe it either.  It's certainly fluffier, creamier, flakier, smoother and not as dense as regular ice cream.  At the same time it's the exact opposite of all of those adjectives.  Doesn't make sense, but whatever.

Let's listen in!\n\nDevil:  That was an awful lunch.  How sad is it to be us, having to spend 10 hard-earned dollars on mushy Thai?  We so deserve a treat.  The city owes us.\n\nAngel:  It's your fault for going out instead of home for lunch.  You are being punished.

A lot of interesting, quirky flavors that are really creamy and delicious and taste exactly what they are. Not an overwhelming number of flavors, but there's usually a decent number that you'd be able to find SOMETHING that you find appetizing on there. \n\nThere seems to be a constant line that comes out the door, but it never got too long and the wait wasn't too bad. My only problem was all the flavors sounded so good, I really wanted to taste test them all before picking a flavor to buy! It also sounds like they have different flavors available, and some of the ones people mentioned in reviews that sounded amazing weren't offered today. Oh well, that just means I'll have to go back multiple times! Not a problem for this ice cream loving machine. \n\nI also tried the peanut brittle cookie, as it's on the Big Eat 2012 list. I thought it was an okay cookie. It was chewy and soft, and it was good! But not the best cookie I've had .... I thought the ice cream was a better pick over the cookie, and if I go back (I mean to say, when I go back), it will be to gorge myself on ice cream. \n\nThe ambiance is nice - they actually have some tables for people to sit on inside the place, unlike some of the other hip ice cream places in the city. For some reason, the centerpieces to the tables seemed to be squashes of some kind - we were trying to figure out if some day, these would be made into ice cream when they got bored of being centerpieces. \n\nGood customer service too - I asked for a kiddie size, and the guy accidentally gave me the larger size. He just charged me for the kiddie size anyway.\n\nLocation is a little out of the way, but it's right by UCSF Mission Bay so if I ever venture to this side of town, I'll have to stop by for delicious ice cream! Also a plus: it's right across the street from Hard Knox so if you had your fill of heart-stopping yummy greasy soul food - top the meal off with ice cream! You've already screwed over your diet; might as well go all the way!\n\nMinus one star because they have some rather odd hours - there's some days when we come and the place is closed.

The lines are reasonable, the location is so close to my house, and the flavors are out of control. Ice cream line decision-making is one of the most stressful experiences in my first world life, and needless to say, the shockingly short line here compounded my anxiety. After pretty much trying every single flavor and finding them all ridiculously delicious, I eventually settled on the Jasmine Green Tea and Black Sesame. Asian-inspired flavors done right are so rare and this place does them RIGHT. The green tea especially brought me to my knees. I now dream of nothing else. Creamy, so chock full of jasmine-green-tea flavor, and not too sweet! So often, green tea ice cream just tastes like pale green sugar, but I dare say this was the best I've ever had.  Black sesame was rich and toasty and complimented the green tea very well. Not being overly saccharine, I easily could have devoured so so many more scoops.\n\nWill be back again and again - can't wait to try the lauded Pink Squirrel flavor!

This had a great balance though, as in the ginger wasn't overwhelming as I can usually be. They also folded in actual small pieces of candied ginger in the ice cream, which was a plus!\n\nThey had an interesting special ice cream of the day? week? I'm not sure... but it was called Almond Jelly. My friends and I instantly thought of the Almond Jello that you'd get at Asian restaurants... and it was... only in ice cream form! Simply amazing. Nice twist on a popular dessert. \n\nOut of all the flavors though... my absolute favorite has to be the Earl Grey. I TOTALLY REGRET not getting this for myself! I tried a spoon of it from my friend's cup and literally... once it touched my tongue, I was captivated. The Earl Grey flavor was so pronounce, so perfect, SO GOOD!

There were people gathered outside resting and eating some stuff. Since this is one of there only food spots in the area I decided to take a look.\n\nI had no clue that this was an ice cream store! It really looks like a cafe from the outside. I suspect that 'Miscellaneous' is new to the area because their sign is essentially a handwritten piece of paper taped in the window. After seeing customers pass me by with cones in their hand I became excited.\n\nThe interior is like a retrofitted bakery with high ceilings. It's has a classy vibe with stark white walls, dark wood tables, and chalkboard menus. I highly appreciated the big beautiful bouquet of flowers on the table. For a place this big it's surprising to find a restroom - a plus. Handicapped door button - another plus.\n\nThe menu is composed of about a dozen ice creams and I think a couple of sorbets(?). Most of the flavors sound traditional yet there also some curious sounding ones like Choco-Malt Crunch and Ballpark (beer, pretzels). There are optional add ons to your ice cream treat. They also sell some cookies and caramels. I had the \"Mint Cookie\". It's mint ice cream with chocolate cookie chunks. I liked my ice cream. I wish the division of ice cream and cookie was more equally divided. It was like eating a lot of ice cream then having one big cookie chunk. Beside this quibble the mint flavor was good and not overpowering. The cookie was fresh but I just wanted more of it.\n\nPrices are $2.75 for a single and $3.75 for a double. It's a little steep in my opinion. The serving size is about the same as a gelato place but it's not as rich as other gourmet ice cream shops so you're left wanting more. They have their own homemade waffle cones which are fifty cents extra. I asked for a cone but the guy stated that they were all out; however, when I sat down to eat there were like three people right after me walking out with cones. WTF. I guess the cone fairy sprinkled her dust.\n\n_____\n\nI still prefer Humphry Slocombe or Mitchell's or Bi-Rite or even Swenson's. I think Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous need to just \"play\" more with their menu and identity. They are showing the signs of a new business but I think they are off to a great start.

It seems, if you're product is good enough, people in SF will come. I guess that applies to most anything and everything, including drugs right? haha \n\nThe line out the door goes by really quickly. Waiting in lines allows you to ponder or flip flop between ice cream flavors listed on the chalkboard. I like the randomness of the flavors as they run out. During my short time here, they finished three different tubs of ice cream flavors and rather than replenish that flavor with more of the same, they brought out a brand new flavor to the \"oohs and ahhs\" of those in line. So the chalkboard listing flavors is ever changing.\n\n*Pink Squirrel - almond and chocolate liquor? Overall it tasted like cherries and I can't complain\n\n*Jasmine Green Tea - light and refreshing! \n\nWith the weather already feeling like summer, this place is only gonna get more popular.

Recently I'd taken to calling before I went to confirm that they were open because it seems every nice weekend day I've tried, the doors have been shut.  It turns out they sell out of ice-cream quite frequently and will leave a message on the answering machine or on their Facebook page to let people know.  Another time I showed up and got in an epic line and was told ten minutes into my wait that they were running out of ice-cream.  This concept of running out of food when you are a stationary restaurant was foreign to me till this point. \n\nSeems like frequently selling out of your product and having a cult following should indicate that they have good stuff.  My one experience where I managed to get ice-cream was a bit underwhelming though.   It's good, but not that good.  The flavors they had at the time were all simple, mostly one addition to a custard base, and no chocolate.  I felt all the flavors I tried where overly sweetened to the point where they hid other flavors.  The texture also wasn't as creamy as I'd hope for.

It was chewy and soft and not very heavy. I could taste and see the caramelizing on the bottom of the cookie. It was good, but not a WOW for me.\n\nPricing-wise, the cost was $3.50 for single scoop and additional $0.50 for small waffle cone. Cookies were $2.50 each.

Mr. and Mrs. Misc is another one to add to my list. The best flavor I had was earl grey. I've had earl grey before, but this was one spectacular. Really. It has the tea flavor, but more like a milky tea that has a creamy finish. I had the lavender which was comparable to Bi-Rite (my favorite). The only negative is that it is rather expensive. The BF and I each got two scoops (one scoop of each flavor) and the total was $9.00.

Everyone I know has tried it and has had rave reviews.  However, perhaps because it was a cold day and ice cream was not on my immediate wants, I was not blown away.  Don't get me wrong, the ice cream is good and the flavors very creative; however none of them suited my taste. I tried the Basil Chocolate Chip. The quality of the ice cream is great-- creamy and fresh, and the chocolate chips were the perfect size-- small enough to get a good dose every spoonful, and big enough to get the crunch of the very good quality chocolate chips; but just nothing extraordinary.  Perhaps the hype made me more critical. My friend had a different flavor and had it with a cone, and she loved the cone.  Maybe I will have to try it again on another day.\n\n I don't expect exceptional service from an ice cream shop, but I felt that the place was a little too \"cold\" (pun-intended) and pretentious compared to other places like Bi-Rite and Humphrey Slocombe.\n\nIf I was walking around Dogpatch I'd def stop by, but I would not go out of my way for this place.", "author": "Ali C."}

We arrived at 4:57 only to find out they close at 5pm.  We were still waiting for our friend to arrive so we had them hold the door open for her right at 5pm.  I quickly ordered a scoop of the bourbon caramel and pink squirrel.  Luckily we were still able to sit and eat in there, although the seat we were at was right next to the window and quickly melted the ice cream.\n\nThe flavors were good.  Pink Squirrel - A slight almond flavor, although not as strong as I would've liked it.  Normally I would've gotten salted caramel but they were out of it.  For some reason, the bourbon caramel tasted more like almond to me, but maybe the flavors just got mixed together.  The flavors change frequently and are different than other places.  It's a really creamy ice cream if you like that, although mine just melted so fast.  \n\nOverall a nice place to go if you're in the neighborhood but I'm not sure it would be worth a trip if you're too far.  Maybe I will need to try again to taste more flavors.", "author": "Stacey C."}

So outstanding that I don't really want to write this review so I can continue to come here and enjoy their tasty treats on random weekends in relative peace. \n\nAs you approach Mr. and Mrs. the first thing you notice is the sweet vanilla scent of fresh waffle cones on the iron, maybe mixed with a waft of chocolate chip cookie. You will leave the store with this delicious perfume clinging to your clothes, and people will turn their heads as you walk, murmuring \"yuuum.\"  \n\nFrankly, that is probably enough to bring any halfway interested person to visit, but add in low key but enthusiastic staff, a friendly neighborhood vibe, really incredible, creative ice cream flavors, and the hope of street parking (we are in the Dogpatch) - it doesn't get much better than this.\n\nIf you like that very fine balance between sweet and salt, Mr. and Mrs. is your place. The base is creamy and rich, but not cloying, and the flavors are intriguing - always with a bit of savor to offset the sweet.\n\nMy favs; salted mango, the candied violet (just a little lemony too), earl grey, and I am game to try any new flavor these geniuses come up with. Anyone who can make Fernet Branca ice cream taste this good could probably do just about anything.\n\nThe baked goods and candy treats always look incredible here, but I haven't yet tried them - no room. I had one of the raspberry lemon thyme popsicles over the summer and it was divine - refreshing, tangy, herbal and wonderful on a hot day.\n\nHands down better than Bi-rite, and also better than Humphry. \n\nTake your out of town friends and watch them drool as they approach the door.

Although maybe not as well known as the others (amongst my friends at least), what better way to spend part of my day off than to drop in with a few friends to check them out? \n\nWalking in, the place really reminded me of the look and feel of Serpentine...which is not that surprising considering they're right across the street from each other.  With the high ceilings, big windows, and a near-warehouse type of design, it's definitely got that commercial type of feel.  While that might suggest more of a cold type of decor, it's actually quite the opposite.  With all  of the stools and big wooden tables adorned with flower centerpieces, it's quite inviting to take a seat and enjoy your frozen treat.\n\nAfter sampling a couple of their flavors, I decided to go with the Chicory Coffee that I tried, while I took a chance on their Orange Chipotle.  Of the two, I definitely thought that the Chicory Coffee was better.  Good, distinct coffee flavor, not overly sweet...solid.  I still give Humphrey Slocombe the edge with their Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, but the Chicory Coffee definitely ranks as one of the better ones I've had.  As for the Orange Chipotle, there's no question as to the flavor - it literally tastes like chipotle and orange.  Initially, I liked that sweet, orange flavor followed by that spicy kick at the end.  It was unique to get that refreshing hit at the start, followed by the chipotle aftertaste.  However, I have to admit that after a while, it was a bit too much for me.  Sadly enough, I couldn't finish the rest of it (plus, we had plans to hit up Bi-Rite an hour later anyways).\n\nMaybe in part because of my gamble, I think I might give Humphrey a slight edge because of the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee (both are behind Bi-Rite though).

But I have to circle around for parking if there's no spots in the Mitchell's lot. On a sunny day in SF, Mitchell's always has a line out the door.  Bi-Rite's the same problem: no parking!  But MMM has plenty of parking and the Dogpatch is this hidden gem of a neighborhood in SF that when you walk around, there's a lot more than warehouses.\n\n2) Seating\nMMM is probably double the size of Mitchell's and Bi-Rite.  There's plenty of tables and chairs inside for you to enjoy your ice cream.  The place reminds me of Blue Bottle in the Mint Plaza.\n\n3) Simple menu with fresh ingredients!\nChocolate malted was creamy.  The vanilla was probably one of the best vanilla ice creams I've had in my life (and I've always been a vanilla lover over chocolate).  They have a simple menu -- only 8 flavors were on the board when we were there.

Flores previously worked at Wolfgang Puck at Spago in Southern California and Maui and CUT in Beverly Hills. While Topacio  previously worked at Chez Panisse and Brickmaiden Breads. Now they run the light filled black and white decorated shop with vintage flare (sweets sold from large mason jars) is located on the corner of 3rd street and 22nd street.\n\nThey serve a unique range of flavored organic ice cream but they also have delicious  fresh cookies, caramels, toppings, cones and brittles. The toppings, cones and syrups are homemade as well. If you're not a fan of new ice cream flavors they always have some classics (chocolate, vanilla, etc) but if you like to experiment they have two groups of unique flavors. One is child friendly with flavors ranging from White sesame, Candied violet, PB &J. The second is more for adults (+21) with flavors like honey-wine (Ethiopian honey mead), Manhattan (inspired by their namesake cocktails), and ballpark (a mix of anchor steam beer, roasted peanuts, chocolate-covered pretzel). These two are not looking to have a signature flavor rather they want their customers to trust there will always be something you will like. So far they have forced me to try new things because my previous flavors are rare on the chalk board. Below are some of my favorites:\n\nIce Cream:images\n\nEnglish Tea\nExtra Coffee\nOld Fashioned (a mix of Markers Mark and Cherries)\nDark Chocolate Sunday (definitely share with a friend)\nSweets:\n\nChocolate Chip Cookies\nIndividually wrapped Carmel\nPrice: mr-and-mrs-miscellaneous\n\n$1.00 to add a cone\n$3.50 single scoop\n$4.75 double scoop\n$5.75 tripple scoop\n$6.50 sunday\n$14.99 (Quart)\nHours: \n\nTues-Sat 11:30am - 6:00pm\nSunday 11:30 am - 5:00pm\nDefinitely try Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous to compare it to other local ice cream creameries: Mission Hill, Mitchell's, Br-Rite and Humphry Slocombe.I find Mr & Mrs. Miscellaneous near the top of my favorite local creameries.

The ice cream has the perfect balance of creaminess and it's not too sweet.  They have interesting flavors and they change every day.  The staff said that they are just as surprised as the customers about what flavors are available each day.  My favorites are:  almond butter, cookies and cream, jasmine green tea, and chicory coffee.  They also make my favorite chocolate chip cookie.  The chips really big so they are more like chunks.  The cookie is thick, moist, and chewy.\n\nThis place is pretty strict about closing time so don't think that you can sneak in there after they close.\n\nI hear that they serve delicious breakfast pastries in the morning.

The violet flavor isn't overpowering at all, yet its still obviously there.  I never missed the violet, but i also never felt overwhelmed by the taste of perfume as most flower flavored sweets tend to be, and the little bits of the candied flower in the actual ice cream added a nice texture. The servers were all really nice and although I did try a couple of other flavors, none of them really stick out in my mind. \n\nOverall I really enjoyed the ice cream here and will definitely return in the future since their menu is always rotating. i would recommend everyone to come and try their flavors if they have the chance. \n\nPs. their cookies are pretty bad ass too.", "author": "Domingo D."}

I've been to Bi-Rite, Humphrey Slocombe, Mitchell's, Ice Cream Bar, Xanath, and a couple others in this fine city of ours. Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous is BY FAR my favorite.\n\nLike BRC and HS (sorry, I'm a lazy typer), M & MM has some amazingly creative flavors but unlike the former ones, M & MM has a slightly higher proportion of milk to cream. This means that the creamy fattiness doesn't block the punch of flavor. Plus, since there's a slightly lower fat content (I say slightly, because it is still ice cream people) it freezes the slightest bit more solid and therefore melts slower. And when you want to savor every tiny mouthful of ice cream decadence, that melting rate is a divine gift.\n\nMy life-changing ice cream experience was due to their candied violet. It's made with a lemon ice cream base which is flavored with lemon oil/lemon zest so that you get that essence of lemon without the tartness. Then bits of candied violet are mixed in for a pop of crunchy texture, color and a mild floral flavor. It costs an extra fifty cents, but it's totally worth it. Trust me.\n\nI can die happy now.", "author": "Amanda S."}

The ice cream here is unrivaled in San Francisco if it wasn't so far from Russian Hill it'd be my go to ice cream joint. I had the scoops of Ovaltine and cheesecake on a waffle cone.

So coming to any new place always makes me a little skeptical.  Will it live up to its hype?\n\nTurns out trying a new ice cream place like this can still blow my mind.  So my first impression when I walk in, the space is absolutely gorgeous.  Tall floor to ceiling windows, and modern but warm decor.  Just the way I like it.  \n\nI stared at the menu for a few minutes - they definitely have very unique flavors. Many that I haven't seen on other ice cream menus.  Overwhelmed with choice, I decided to ask for whatever their most popular flavor was.  Candied violets?  Umm, ok.  I had no idea what this was going to taste like but one bite and I can't even explain how good it was.  Light and creamy, not too sweet even with those candied violets.\n\nThe boyfriend had the jasmine green tea ice cream which tasted exactly like jasmine and green tea.  It was in no way overpowering like it would be if you sipped jasmine green tea from the pot - it was sweet and refreshing.  It reminded me a little bit of Bombay Ice Cream's rose ice cream.

I was a bit surprised to find that Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous are located directly across the street from my aunt's old cafe that used to be there - back then the place was not as developed as it is now, so that was a pleasant surprise.\n\nOn to the ice cream! I love the setup of the whole store - nice, open space with a lot of tables and chairs for customers to enjoy their frozen treats. The staff is really nice and gladly lets you try whatever flavors you want. Like almost all ice cream places these days, tastings are done with metal spoons - makes me feel important!\n\nI tried many of their flavors, however I really wished I tried their mung bean flavor - sounds interesting. But anyway, I tried their sweet cream (didn't do much for me, just whatever), almond with white choc and dried cranberries, honey graham (just vanilla ice cream with honey graham crackers mixed in) and the citrus flan with salted caramel mixed in. My favorite of those was the citrus flan flavor, so for $3.50, I got a single scoop of that in a cup (I probably should've gotten the cone, but oh well). \n\nThe texture of the Mr. and Mrs.'s ice cream was more on the icy side rather than the smooth, creamy texture I usually like to have with my ice cream. For me, the ice crystals were just too large and took away some of the enjoyable-ness of the ice cream. Luckily when we went, there was no wait time - if I did have to wait a while, I would've been a little upset only because I don't think the ice cream would have been worth a wait. But at least I've now tried it and maybe would only go back if I had to, definitely not a place I would think of going to just out of the blue.\n\nCompared with Bi-Rite, Mitchells and Humphrey, I'd still pick any of those three over the Miscellaneous's.", "author": "Julia K."}

This has to got to be the BEST ice cream joint, ever. I don't usually make blanket statements like that, but in this case, the awesomeness of this shop is so obvious that it's pretty much a fact.\n\nAnd I've gone to all the others (Humphrey's, Bi-Rite's, Mitchell's)...but this place is different. It's safe to say, I'm in love with this shop. In fact, I need to work a \"Mr and Mrs\" line item into my monthly budget because without their ice cream, I would be one sad puppy :(\n\nWhy they're amazing:\n- It's owned by an awesome couple (Mr and Mrs) who makes everything in-house (ice cream, waffle cones, cookies, peanut brittle...you name it). Where else can you eat ice cream that is served to you by the very people who make it? \n- Everything is biodegradable and compostable, so you can feel good about eating there. \n- Their flavors are amazing. I haven't tried a flavor that I haven't loved: Cinnamon Toast, Salted Caramel, Halva, Sweet Corn Caramel, Earl Grey Tea, Burnt Sugar, Rum Raisin. Their flavors are the perfect balance between unique and delicious. I tend to think Humphrey's tries too hard to be unique and some of the flavors don't taste good at all. But this place gets it just right. You could literally pick a flavor blindly and you'd love it. \n- Their 10 flavors change daily so there's always something new and exciting to try. To find out what flavors they're offering today, friend them on Facebook!\n- Even though this couple works their butts off, they are always warm and welcoming to their customers. Even when I ask to sample flavor after flavor, they oblige with kind enthusiasm.\n- The shop is spacious, bright, clean and has plenty of seating and the cleanest bathroom ever. Also, plenty of free parking.\n- Water for customers: They have mason jars with water and biodegradable cups so you can cleanse your palette after devouring your ice cream\n\nIf you are reading this, do yourself a favor.

Makes me just wanna stop writing this review and head over there for some!  It is 5 stars for the chocolate chip cookie alone!  I also tried the peanut brittle & toffee cookie.  Hubby loved this since he is a peanut lover.  I also enjoyed this cookie, but not as much as the chocolate chip!!!\n\nOn to the ice cream...I was hoping to try try the candied violet, earl gray, flan, tres leches, ballpark, peanut brittle and all the other flavors spoken highly of in other reviews the day I came, but being \"Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous\", none of those were being offered the day I came.  I opted for the salted mango & caramel with sea salt.  Salted Mango blew away the caramel with sea salt for me.  Very, very yummy.  The caramel with sea salt had a good balanced flavor...didn't really wow me.  My daughter had the jasmine green tea and caramel with sea salt.  I had a bite of her green tea, and it was pretty yummy as well.  Hubby had the corn & caramel and milk chocolate.  The corn & caramel tasted like fresh corn in ice cream but without the corn chunks in it.  I couldn't really taste too much of the caramel since the corn overpowered it. Milk chocolate was delicious...can't really go wrong with chocolate.  My most favorite was the salted mango.  \n\nThey also make fresh peanut brittle and cones here.  I think the cone is an extra 50 cents.  Jr. Scoop is $2.75, Single scoop is $3.50. Double is $4.75.  The scoops here are very generous!  I believe there is also a $10 minimum for credit cards.\n\nOverall, my family & i enjoyed our experience at Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous.  We enjoyed it more than Humphrey Slocombe.

Yep, my friend and I did get the undivided attention of the Mr. AND the Mrs.  Not bad.\n\nThey told us their whole story: their business plan, their expansion strategy, their babysitter situation and so on.  You'll never meet two nicer, more approachable and friendly people than the owners of this place.  I mean, they were naturally nice and friendly!  If they were only acting, they deserve an Oscar for Best Customer Service Smile.  I didn't have the courage to ask them about the origin of their shop's name, but I'll try to do it next time.\n\nThey had about 10 flavors that day.  $3 for a single scoop in a cup, $3.50 for a single scoop in a waffle cone.  The single scoop is plenty big, so pace yourselves.  My friend had told me all about the ballpark flavor, but Mr. and Mrs. were not featuring it that day.  Hmmm, decisions....  I hate calling an audible, especially when it comes to ordering ice cream.  \n\nI tried the Fernet flavored ice cream first.  We have a couple of friends who love Fernet more than life itself, and it's become an ongoing joke for us.  I cursed the second I decided to sample it, because ... it did taste exactly as I imagined: a Fernet ice cream float.  It was absolutely disgusting!  I'd rather drink a window-washing fluid and transmission fluid cocktail than Fernet.  Of course if you love anise, black licorice and that vile beverage, you'll be in heaven.\n\nInstead, I opted for the Bananas Foster scoop.  The ice cream was creamy, delicious and just sweet enough.  The texture was better than Bi-Rite's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bi-rite-creamery-san-francisco#hrid:gdpKWjOyrG-FCHnPTFqN7Q), and the flavors were stronger than Humphry Slocombe's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/humphry-slocombe-ice-cream-san-francisco#hrid:Y3Fkn6Y0rCwJV_ssl2zhHw).

One of the best ice creams I've ever had.\n\nFighting my cravings tooth and nail, I settled with something ever so slightly healthier, good old vanilla bean. Also excellent.

It was so great, I was perfectly satisfied having 3 scoops of ice cream for my dinner. And they are very generous so the 3 scoops was a mountain-full.\n\nBananas Foster - bananas can be over-powering but this was just the perfect amount that let the other scoops have its own presence. You can't taste the alcohol foster portion which I personally enjoy.\n\nTres Leches - a dream come true! There are actual cake pieces in the ice cream, and you can't see them so it's a nice surprise when you get it. The flavor is right on as a tres leches should be - creamy, milky, condensed milk dominant - and the added texture of the soggy cake is really nice. \n\nPink Squirrel - hands down my absolute favorite. I don't know what comprises of this flavor but I taste a hint of almond and other Yelp reviews say there's black cherry in it. I'd compare this delicate flavor to how beautiful a cherry blossom is. Gay, I know but it really is a nice combination of fragrant flavors and pleasant surprises. \n\nI also enjoyed the location - quiet, easy to find parking. I'm not stressed out from the bustle of the city, and it was easy to get to. But that's just me who didn't need to eat dinner beforehand either - I guess it would be annoying to come out to just for ice cream and nothing else.\n\nIt's a good thing I'm not a local - I would be a fatty mcFat if I was nearby!", "author": "Jenny C."}

The caramelized hazelnuts had the right amount of crunchy texture.  I also tasted the PB&J which I was surprised I enjoyed so much given that it is on the sweeter side.  \n\nThe owners are super nice and avoid putting a pretentious slant on their gourmet ice cream shoppe which is hard to do in SF.

With a name like that who would've guessed it's an ice cream shop.\n\nThis is a relatively new ice cream shop in the Dogpatch owned by a couple.  Cute place and minimally decorated.  Small selections of 10 flavors daily.  The flavors change once or even twice a day according to Mrs. Miscellaneous.  She told me that they make a 3 gallon tank per flavor each time and when that's sold out, they make a new flavor.  So it is constantly changing.  The place has one quirky rule though, there's a limit of 3 tastings per person.  \n\nI sampled the flavor my friend had which was the Orange Blossom Honey.  Texture was creamy but the honey essence was really strong and overpowering.  I love honey but this was too much and it just overshadowed the orange flavor.  So I went with a kid scoop of the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Malt for $2.50.  YUM!!!  Super creamy with a nice balance of subtle taste of peanut butter and chocolate.  Not overpowering at all.  Hard to describe, you'll have to try it for yourself. \n\nI can't say this is my new favorite ice cream place just yet since I've only been here once but it's good enough for me to go back to try out other flavors.  I have my eyes on the Earl Grey flavored.", "author": "Hannah C."}

I know I know, you're probably saying I should hop off my high horse; however I simply have zero damns to spare for you. Anyways Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous deserves my review and a lot more.\n\nLawd have mercy, I love their ice cream so damn much! This is one of those places that you'll remember when you're old with alzhiemers. Your future grandchildren will be eating dip-n-dots, and you'll be like \"I remember when we had real ice cream like from Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous!\" And your grandchildren will just laugh in disregard. \n\nI love the Mom-&-Pop-i-ness vibe i get from this place. The employees are always helpful and always seem to converse with customers with ease. I'm sure the employees know me here because I walk through the door yelling \"TAKE MY MONEY!!!\" They're located right across from Hard Knox. Ice cream after chicken & waffles? Yes please. If you're not lazy, the ballpark is a couple blocks away. Ice cream after a Giants game? Yes please. Parking in the area isn't much of a hassle compared to other hipster ice cream shops *ahem* Bi-Rite *ahem* \n\nEvery flavor always satisfies! The ice cream is a perfect balance of creaminess, sweetness and texture. Some flavors, like Bourbon Caramel and Banana Toffee, have a buttery component which ties the flavors together. Some flavors, like Crema Catalana and Honey Yogurt, have a perfectly light and refreshing quality. Whatever you like, they'll have something for you. My favorite flavors are Pink Squirrel and Candied Violet, but sometimes they don't have them that day. But, you see, that doesn't matter because all their flavors are so good. I'm always discovering random flavors that creep into the top of my ice cream favorites list! Unlike Bi-Rite, I find myself trying new flavors every visit, instead of the usual Salted Caramel or Ricanelas. Also, thanks to the Se\u00f1or Sisig collabo, they have Filipino-related flavors like Macapuno, Almond Jelly and a Turon-inspired flavor (banana + jackfruit), which are also a nice addition. I'm a fatty, so i usually order two scoops because I'm indecisive on which flavor to have. \n\nFor the most part, their extra stuff, like the toppings and baked goods, are made in-house. The waffle cones are made in-house and have the perfect sweetness and thickness. I havent tried any toppings (although the homemade caramel is always tempting), but I have tried some of the their baked good. The cookies with huge chocolate chunks are just as addicting as their ice cream. I compare their cookies to Anthony's Cookies, but a little bigger. Also they have a caramel-marshmallow thingy that is sooo bad for you, but is hella delicious. Im convinced, they can do no wrong if they just add their caramel to anything. The next thing i will have to buy is a jar of their Almond Brittle. If you're ever overwhelmed with the sweetness from anything, they have free water. The bathroom is always clean too. \n\nBascially, Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous is like a crack house, because I fiend for their products and i go there to get my fix. The only downside to everything I just said is that they close at 6pm and are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. I ain't eem mad though, they deserve a break after supplying the ice cream fiends.\n\nlol @ people going to Bi-Rite or Humphreys when Miscellaneous is open. \n\nHave I hyped up Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous enough for you? ...

I am ashamed publicly but proud privately to admit that I've probably tried all the ice cream shops in San Francisco (and even some outside of San Francisco). If you name it, I've probably been there. \n\nBi-Rite: check\nMitchell's: check\nHumphrey Slocomb: check\nThree Twins: check\nFenton's: check\nBen & Jerry's: check\nGhirardelli: check\nSwensen's: check\nMr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous: check\n\nPS: I refuse to list places like Baskin-Robbins because loving ice cream means not compromising my high ice cream standards.\n\nI was disappointed at Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous. I went in with high expectations stemming from Yelp's 4.5 star ratings. I left with a child's scoop of cookies and cream ice cream because that was the only remotely appealing flavor for me. Much like Humphrey Slocomb, I felt the flavors were just too out there. I tried the basil and chocolate chip and it tasted like a mixture of a Thai dish and chocolate. The selections weren't abundant, which wouldn't be an issue if they were as delicious as those of Bi-Rites but alas, they weren't. There weren't many desserts to crave either, which was another minus for the store. I wouldn't drive all the way out here for ice cream but am willing to try one more time if I'm every near the Dogpatch, which means I won't be back for awhile. \n\nParking wasn't the easiest either, and I went at 3 pm on a weekday.", "author": "Gwen L."}

I had just left the Giants game, and in walking to my friend's car, happened to mention the ice cream place which I knew was in the area.  \n\nWe ended up going, and omg, soooo good.  I love unique flavors which is why I like Ben & Jerry's.  But many Ben & Jerry's flavors can be too overwhelming with their mix-ins.  That is not the case at Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous.  The flavor is in the ice cream itself, not the stuff that's mixed in.  \n\nI had \"Pink Squirrel\" which was SO good.  I really like black cherry ice cream but don't prefer to deal with the countless pesky cherries.  Well, Pink Squirrel is black cherry minus the cherries.  It was so perfectly creamy and not too sweet.  I also tried the strawberries and cream, really yummy too!\n\nThe flavors change regularly even within the same day as they run out.

We chatted with the worker and told him about the little adventure it took to reach the shop. He showed some compassion by insisting on giving us our ice cream on the house. SUCH A SWEET GESTURE!

On our second ice cream foodie hit, we went to Mr and Mrs Misc, cause we wanted to try out the Pink Squirrel.\n\nLong lines aren't a deterrent. They have ample places to sit inside, lots of water and cups to drink, and interesting flavors to sample. First off, Pink Squirrel is like a light almond amaretto...it's a combination of 2 creme somethings and it's pink. So that's scoop #1. Scoop #2 was Coconut Creme..which had toasted coconut flakes all around. It was intense and I actually prefer the coconut over the Pink Squirrel...it overpowered the other light flavor. The one we should have went with but we arrived too early for, was the Croquantino (Hazelnut with hazelnut liqueur)...it was vibrantly intense and the ground up bits of hazelnuts was a good texture with all that cream. Ahh...we just couldn't fit anymore, and my tongue was numbed up pretty good. So maybe next time for hazelnuts!\n\nHandmade cones were $.50, 2 scoops were $4.75, but they were big scoops. They also offer other homemade peanut brittle, cookies and baked goods. They also have a bathroom too. They'll only take credit if it's over $5.00.\n\nParking is street with some free hourly parking.", "author": "Pauline L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-11", "description": "Very nice/urbany location, located pretty close to Hard Knox, so if you're fiending for dessert, you have a good default place for dessert. This place is a semi-new ice cream shop that has instantly established itself among the heavy hitters (Bi-Rite, Mitchells, Humprhy, etc). The service is awesome and both owners are very nice and friendly, and I really get the vibe that they love what they're doing, which definitely shows in their ice cream.\n\nChocolate Chip Ice Cream - this is more like vanilla ice cream with tons of dark chocolate shavings... very very good... esp the quality of chocolate they use. Almost milky, and the separation between chocolate and vanilla flavors was very delicate.\n\nPink Squirrel - almost tasted like almond gelato, but with a slightly creamier texture. Extremely delicious, and I could imagine myself going to China town and making and ice cream almond cookie sandwich. \n\nBurnt Sugar - if you like creme brulee or that slightly bitter sweet taste... oh boy you're in for a treat. This was soooo good, and it tastes exactly like the name suggests. I actually went back and ordered a pint of this mixed with vanilla to make a Creme Brulee (guy called me out on it).\n\nVanilla - Another very rich vanilla ice cream. I bought this along with the burnt sugar for my sister after polishing off my 3 scoop ice cream. My sister said this was the best vanilla ice cream she has had. Though not as custardy as other ice cream places, this one has very good quality and the vanilla is rich but not overwhelming. \n\nChicory Coffee - this is like Vietnamese Coffee turned into ice cream. A nice slight taste of chicory root a long with the coffee grounds adding texture created a good ice cream. This has quite a bit of caffeine in it for someone who isn't used to drinking coffee, so I was left with a nice buzz. Initially, I thought this ice cream was maybe 3rd amongst my top 3 coffee ice creams, but I really could not stop thinking of this ice cream, as the vietnamese coffee tones really won me over. This is my favorite coffee ice cream. I'm actually craving this now while I type.\n\nHorchata Ice Cream - this tastes like a less gritty ice cream version of La Santaneca's Tiste... this was amazing... almost like eating cinnamon toast crunch in ice cream form. It was a little bit sweet (the guy mentioned this and I agreed), but it was still so delicious and such a great take on Horchata... I actually would take this melted down over ice over horchata!\n\nyeah, I'm a pig, but I really love the ice cream here... you cant go wrong with anything you order. They also have peanut butter and chocolate malt balls, but I ate too much ice cream. This was basically my lunch. I love this place. Wish they had the Brown Butter ice cream, which is probably the best ice cream I've ever had.

That qualifies for at least three visits!  Ian and Annabelle have created a lovely haven for ice cream on the edge of Dog Patch.  The space is open, airy and simple; creating the perfect backdrop for a multitude of fabulous flavors.  Let's get some technical out of the way:\n\n1.  They now take credit cards.  So you have no excuse why not to take home a couple of pints.\n2.  They are SUPER nice.  Customer service takes you far now a days. Good music, good conversationalist and they didn't rush us into choosing.\n3.  Parking is not a huge problem if you are willing to walk a few blocks.\n4.  The space is super clean.  \n\nNow for the part you have been waiting for...drum roll....flavors du jour:\n\nPint number one:  Earl Grey.  Outfrigginstanding.  Tastes like the fabulous organic bergamot  Earl Grey I get at Rainbow.  Well rounded, not too floral and very sensual.\n\nPint number two: RedRum Raisin.  It just blew Toscannini's rum raisin out of the water.  The right amount of booze mixed with a very smooth vanilla.  I never have to go back to Boston again.  Just kidding dad.\n\nPint number three:  vanilla and blueberry.  Since blueberries are at the height of their season, this was a no brainer.  Super light and fabulous; perfect for after a meal.\n\nIn store I had a cup of candied violet and vanilla. The candied violet was awesome, but a pint of it would have been overwhelming.  Definitely better in small amounts.\n\nThe ice cream was smooth, sweet and not as heavy and dense as Humphry Slocombe.  They have a great selection of unusual flavors  and for a nice change, they also pay homage to the classics.  I hope they have the Cable Car next time I go!\n\nWe also purchased the hybrid cookies: peanut butter/sugar cookies and the chocolate chip/cherry.  Oh and their coconut marshmallows.

There is so much flavor packed in every spoonful of ice cream that i am really having the toughest time to find the words to describe it.  one must experience this for themselves.\n\nit was my second trip there last weekend and they had a flavor called, \"Chocolate Chip Basil.\"  my first thought was, \"wow...what a daring flavor combination.\" and i'd wager to say that it takes a sophisticated (snobby *ss) tongue to appreciate something like that.  if you can get past the fact that your ice cream has basil in it, it actually accentuates the chocolate chips in a minty kind of way.  nonetheless, i have to give them props for their risk taking and forward thinking in their approach to the flavor spectrum on something as classic as ice cream.\n\nwhile that might be a little bit too over the top for you, they have several flavors there (don't be surprised to see completely different flavors every day) and you can sample everything before committing to a scoop.  i've had their Earl Grey Tea, Dirty Chai Tea and several others that i can't seem to remember the name (damn, i really shouldn't have taken 2 weeks to do this review) but extremely, flavorful and delicious!!!  every little spoonful was like a taste of heaven.  i literally had an out of body experience, was sitting up on a cloud just above the building and was looking down at my physical body and...kidding kidding! but you get the jist! :)\n\nnow about the location, depending on what time of day you head out that way, you may have to drive around the block at least once to find parking but trust me, very worth it!!!  the decor and atmosphere inside is very cozy, homey with a nice window view out to let plenty of natural sunlight in.  the staff is very friendly and can get pretty crowded from time to time.\n\nin terms of pricing, if you're from the burbs like me and you're not used to this, just letting you know, it is a tad bit pricey.  $3.50 for a fairly generous scoop and a little extra if you want it on one of their cones.  but you have to remember, the ice cream here isn't massed produced in large quantities like a baskin robbins or a cold stone or any of your typical franchisey ice cream outlets - these are made from scratch (yes made from scratch) and are in extremely limited quantities per day.   \n\nthis has easily become one of my necessary stops whenever i'm in the SF Area vicinity and look forward to my next trip out this way!", "author": "Elvin L."}

I kept digging around in it to find the bits of violet to eat. this one was sweeter than the corn caramel ice cream.\n\nthe cookies:\nchocolate chip with cherry & chocolate chip - unbelievably chewy, even after day 2 of being in a package.  the cookies look very unassuming, but they're packed with chewiness and flavor (\"Chocolate in the classic cookie is Cacao Barry; in Flores' chocolate-dried cherry spinoff, it's 70 percent Valrhona Guanaja. -- to quote a recent sf weekly article)", "author": "Jenny S."}

I can't even say I like bourbon unless you're talking about chicken, but it really does work superbly with ice cream - yummy!\n- BALLPARK: Anchor Steam beer with chocolate pretzels (and maybe nuts?).  It was actually quite good - certainly better than it sounded.\n- CHAI TEA: I often find chai ice cream disappointing, but this one had a good amount of spice to it and was really tasty.\n- LEMON KRUNCH: Limoncello with small crunchy bits.

Tahdah! \n\nI love the dogpatch, not only is Hard Knox is right there, but one of my favorite brunch spots, Just For You Cafe, is right around the corner.  And I can safely say, this is the much nicer part of 3rd Street. Also, it's always sunnier around these parts. And what calls for sunny, warm days in SF? Ice cream, of course! Their shop is set up with huge windows as walls furnished with dark wood tables. \n\nThey have house made peanut and almond brittle, cookies and other goodies such as coconut marshmallows for sale. But of course, it's the ice cream that you're here for! So far the flavors that stood out for me was the Ballpark (Anchor steam beer, pretzels and peanuts), and Old Fashioned (Maker's Mark, cherries and almonds).  Noticed a trend? I do like my alcohol... in ice cream that is ;P You'll also see some traditional flavors such as pralines and cream and oreo cookie- which are also yummy by the way! They also like to add new flavors to the mix such as \"coffee and donuts,\" tres leches with chunks of tres leches cake in it, and \"black forest,\" vanilla ice cream with kirsch-soaked cherries and chunks of black fudge cake.

I liked it a lot when I sampled it, but the flavor somehow got lost as I ate more than one bite.

The day I went there they ran out of the salted caramel so instead I got the brown butter ice cream and my friend got the orange blossom I think that's what it was called. Hers was really good. Nice and light. Mine was good but you have to like sweet. I do but after a while I started to get sick. I think if you can share the brown butter you should. My stomach started to hurt and I could start feeling the butter slime on the top of my mouth. Don't get me wrong it was really good but too much butter for me.

Here you will find seasonal, home-made ice-cream but their specialty is making their own waffle cones. They have some already made earlier in the day or you can ask to get one freshly made for you. Not that many flavors of ice-cream to choose from but they do give free samples so take your time in deciding, but not too long because there is a constant stream of people coming in. \n\nI can't say too much about the ice-cream since they do change the flavors out but you can always find Vanilla on the menu. But I do like the creative flavors but watch out for the Lemon Ginger ice-cream, it can be a bit sour because of those tiny candied pieces. But the coffee ice-cream is great for coffee lovers. Everything is bio-degradable: spoons, napkins, cups, bags, etc... So I find this to be one of the most eco-friendly or GREEN places in SF. \n\nLiving down the street from this place I think this is a nice addition to the neighborhood. We got cafes across the street, Hard Knox too, and a wine bar. The only thing is this place doesn't have good parking so go in there, order your pint, and take off somewhere else to enjoy your ice-cream. This is more of a neighborhood/local ice-cream shop so if you are in the neighborhood take some time to sit and enjoy the simple decor but if not just do the grab n' go. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Nana R."}

I certainly appreciate their creative flavors.  The candied violet was surprisingly good- not too floral, as if you're eating girly body wash.  The crema catalana is actually really tasty, I would order that next time.  The old fashioned is a great idea, but I'd choose Humphrey Slocombe's \"secret breakfast\" over it.  My main issue was that the candied violet and old fashioned weren't homogenous enough - if you got a bite with these flavors swirled in it tasted great, otherwise you simply got a bite of plain, flavorless ice cream.  Moreover, their basic ice cream recipe is not as satisfyingly smooth & creamy as Ben & Jerry's.

I highly suggest the candied violet and butter almond with toffee if they have it. They rotate their flavors every week I believe so everytime you come in you'll probably see a flavor you haven't tried. Usually when I find something good in a restaurant I stick to it. But since they don't usually have the same flavors each week you're forced to experiment. Which is good because every flavor I've had has been just as good or even better. Ice cream is very rich and creamy. Seating is available inside. And parking is usually widely available. If you want good variety and not your everyday type flavors.

I was told those are their two most popular flavors.  It was a tough one and I couldn't go with the double with two flavors because the portion would have been too big. \n\nCroquatino won because it's a unique flavor that I haven't seen offered anywhere else. It was mighty tasty with the creamy ice cream and crunchy texture of the hazelnuts. \n\nI went with a single on one of their house made waffle cones. I like that they put a mini scoop inside the cone to hold the big scoop. It also allows you to get to the bottom of the cone and still have some ice cream left.  The Croquatino had a generous amount of carmelized hazelnut, -which usually I don't complain about - but too much of  the candy coating on the nut itself made the ice cream a little sweeter than I would have liked it.

You change up your flavors every day, so I never know which one I'll stumble upon next, but I'm impressed every single time.  A few of my favorites: \n       + Caramel with sea salt (gives Bi-Rite's salted caramel a run for its money)\n       + Mint chip (the mint tastes freshly picked)\n       + Tres leches (studded with moist chunks of cake)\n       + Earl grey (like Japanese bottled milk tea, only a zillion times yummier)\n       + Chicory coffee (intense and not overly sweet)\n       + Bananas foster (banana, cinnamon, and brown sugar)\n       + Pink squirrel (almond with chocolate)\n       + Chocolate stout (delightfully boozy)\n* Your house-made caramel sauce. Rich and buttery with the perfect level of viscosity; tastes divine with ice cream, cookies, or by itself...yes, if I had no conscience, I'd totes pour the stuff straight into my mouth. I've heard good things about your buttered rum too.\n* You serve warm waffle cones straight off the iron, and they taste just as good as they smell. \n* You bake spectacular cookies. Like your ice cream, the flavors range from the novel to the traditional: dark chocolate with bing cherries, peanut brittle, and chocolate chip. So chewy. So buttery. So delicious.\n* You've kept your interior charming, cozy, and minimalistic, with sweeping white walls and mahogany tables.\n* Every single serving utensil and container in your store is compostable. \n* Your employees are exceedingly earnest and always willing to let me try as many flavors as I want before I order. \n* You are open on Sunday afternoons, when I'm dreading Monday and craving sweets more than at any other time of the week.\n\nMy favorite ice cream parlor in the city, hands down.", "author": "Jen L."}

When I heard it was and my curious friends rushed to stand in line to grab some treats from our find, I declined thinking oh, yet another attempt to create mind challenging ice cream a la Humphrey or bringing in familiar tasty but not commonly ice cream flavors a la Bi-Rite or Mitchell...\nInstead, they came out with the very traditional Prailines and Cream; I had a bite and regretted not getting my own. Fresh spun caramel, a great balance of salt and sweet, such a wonderfully tamed richness...\nI have since been back via bike (wonderful ride always) and have been loving it. They have a few novelty flavors (many seemingly in homage to a mistakenly simple, effortlessly cool and decadent Mad Men era like Old Fashioned and Banana Foster) that are quite good but it's their masterful crafstmanship of the classic old school faves that singles them out as a note worthy mention in the competitive gourmet ice cream business. Packaged together with their ever-so-nice, humble two-man service they're an absolute delight. \nCheers to the Miscellaneouses!", "author": "Jessica L."}

On such strolls, I might cross a person peppered here and there or the occasional dumpster diver, but surely, excluding Farley's, there must be more of my species than this?  Turns out, they are licking ice cream in the Dogpatch.  \n\nIf you'll be disappointed with less than 31 flavors though, keep right on walking.  Mr. and Mrs. isn't the tormenting decision paralysis one gradually feels from being faced with a battery of inconsequential choices.  Not exactly.  I mean, it's not the off the charts blood pressure claustrophobia that is Mitchell's, let's just put it that way.  Sure, you'll wonder how many peanut butter malt balls you could lay away in your cheeks, whether to order a creamy fizzy float or a gourmet fudgesicle, or maybe you'll just build yourself a rogue ice-cream sandwich with  house-made cookies.  But if it's ice-cream you crave, instead, you'll narrow down a dozen artisanal flavors to a few without breaking a sweat.  Somehow being spoon fed delightful samples balanced on long handle stainless steel utensils from tattooed sweethearts all under lofty ceilings and the afternoon sun on my back made it seem like I could afford to lolly gag.  Here, in this chic neo-old fashioned parlor, they've dreamed up flavors like the Old Fashioned (Maker's Mark, cherries and almonds) and the Ballpark (Anchor Steam and pretzels).  It's the quirkiness of Slocombe without the high-sugar eye-squinting tummy ache.  In fact, I'm about to say something that might be considered sacrilegious, blasphemous and downright heretical in this city:  \n\nI THINK BI-RITE CREAMERY JUST GOT ONE-UPPED.  \n\nThe candied violet--having just the perfect floral balance of salt to subtly sweet, cream to ice, nibbling vs. dissolving--is a keeper (please consider offering this daily!) and my new favorite flavor of all time.  Flecks of violet petals carefully prepared on location and layered in a milky scoop make it also aesthetically admirable.\nIan asked if I was partial to a chewy or crispy texture before he hand-selected a peanut brittle cookie from the pedastal; no one cookie is the same and should never be turned down at the register.", "author": "Irene S."}

Now how lucky were we to not have to wait in a long ass line on this amazing beautiful day in San Francisco for some homemade ice cream. Ok, so SF has some amazing/well-known ice cream options already (mitchells,bi-rite) but this place is definitely my favorite when I do go into the city. I like my ice cream to be on the creamier side of the spectrum and not too sweet and this place does it just right! For about three dollars a scoop and 4 something for 2, they definitely do no go cheapo on you. These scoops and ginormous and for an extra 50 cents, you can order it on a sugar cone. Their flavors are unique with numerous options where you just want to try every flavor. As for myself, I've always been a fan of anything tea flavored, cookies and cream or coconut and so I've always opted for the jasmine green tea or earl grey or coconut flavored ones on almost every time I come in for a visit.\n\nSo on that very special occasion, I opted for a coconut single scoop cone and lets just say I went a bit coco-nutz for it. I loved the little coconut pieces you get to chomp on with every bite or lick and the flavor tasted so organic and not too sweet. So not only do the people there make good ice cream but they definitely know how to treat their customers with respect. Everyone there is so nice, conversational and helpful. So for all of my UCSF mission bay housing people, please walk 3 blocks down from your apartment and eat at this place everyday for me. Thanks! - Anna\n\nPros:  I absolutely adore this place. They even have enough space within the place for you and your many friends to all sit down and devour your ice cream. Huge windows for you to enjoy one of SF finest scenery (the muni stop ;D). \nHelpful tips: They have weird hours, so make sure you check to see if they're opened before heading over.

For as long as this place has been around, it's always been closed when I've tried going...until today. The 25 min wait was worth it. I asked if I could get two flavors in a junior scoop cup and the guy was nice enough to okay that with two mini-scoops of Strawberry and Black Sesame. Turned out this nice guy was Mr. Miscellaneous himself! The Black Sesame (which I've only found Asian versions of til today) was the best I've ever had. B-E-S-T BEST. Perfectly nutty, mild (not too rich), and creamy. As I was obviously mesmerized, Mr. Misc asked me how it was. Pretty sure he could tell by the ear-to-ear grin on my face and my spoon which broke from over-aggressively trying to enjoy my scoops. He said he had worked a month on the recipe. No wonder why it was so delicious! Just for Mr. Misc and this flavor, I'd come back again and again. The strawberry was great too. Not to knock on Bi-Rite since it has been my go-to raison d'etre for living in SF, but the strawberry balsamic is hit or miss there and can sometimes be dry. Not here. There wasn't one flavor on the menu I didn't want to try. Great to have such an awesome ice cream joint in the hood! Just make sure you go when they're open and bring cash.

Could life get better?\n\nIt does close early for an ice cream place, so do plan accordingly. It smells delicious as soon as you enter the door - probably from the cookies and other baked goods that they sell in addition to ice cream. There is a line some times when you get there, and if it's busy, you might not get a place to sit right away. \n\nThe scoopers are all very friendly and let me try a few flavors. I can't remember what flavor I had the first time: something orangey and scrumptious. I got it with hot fudge sauce, which got clumpy too fast because of the cold ice cream. My recommendation: don't get the hot fudge sauce - or get it on the side and dip your ice cream in as needed.  I got the Lemongrass flavor most recently and it was super tasty. My husband got Rosemary Olive Oil and he loved it, though I found it a bit too herbal for me.

I got my chance today and sadly I was disappointed. Went in and scanned menu and liked the choices. I ordered a double with a scoop of White Rabbit and Ameretto. I also grabbed 1ea of the fresh licorice . Happy w/ my choices I left to face the warm summer day w/ my ice cream to beat the heat. I dug in and took my 1st bite. Mmmm very good vanilla, creamy and sweet? Wait a minute I didn't order vanilla. I tried I bite of my other scoop and it was the White Rabbit, condensed milk and white chocolate chips. It was ok, tasted of sweet creamy milk I tiny chunks of white chocolate but it didn't knock my socks off. I tried the 1st scoop again and again a nice vanilla ice cream. Thinking the very pleasant girl a the register had mixed up my order I went back and told the young woman that I couldn't taste anything resembling Ameretto or almonds and if by chance had she given me something else by mistake. Now just to clarify, I'm a bartender by trade and I've been behind a bar for 30 years so I know what Ameretto tastes like. The server (   never got her name) took a sample spoon and tasted the ice cream from the freezer and looked at me like was crazy. She didn't say \"sorry you didn't like\" \"would you like to try something else\". She didn't say anything! If I have a customer come to me and says I didn't like my drink I immediately ask if I can fix the one they have or I offer to make them something else completely. Now while some people have now idea what they are talking about and just want a stronger drink I want to give that person the best drink I can make them. I'm sure that these folks are making a lot of very happy with their ice cream which I admit happily is almost as good as Mitchell's their customer service is lacking. Excuse me, not theirs, hers.

I knew that the ice cream was fantastic, yet didn't really have perspective with the two other biggies out there....Bi Rite and Humphrey Slocumb.  Well, when I wanted ice cream, yet could not get it, I needed to travel to the other places.  I went to Humphrey twice, yet did not go in.  The line was so long and I couldn't see the flavors that they posted.  I guess that I cannot really compare M&MM to HS, yet if you are making strange flavors and there is a huge line, don't you owe it to your customers in line to tell them what you are serving????  I know that someone told M&MM that they should put up a great ice cream sign...and they did.\n\nAnyways, went to bi rite.  Ordered the coffee ice cream, chocolate chip and then one other time the mint chip.  Nothing blew me away.  The mint chip tasted like something that I would get from the grocery store.\n\nM&MM mint chip taste like a mojito.  The mint is so fresh...I have had nothing like it.  This weekend, I tried the Caramel and Sea Salt...wow.  I am going to buy a pint for my dad.  I also had the pretzels and beer.  They  basically grind up some of the pretzels and add malt or something to make it taste wonderful.  I suggest going in and trying a few before getting a cone.\n\nI did have the cookies and cream and wasn't wowed.  Yet that is like going to a restaurant and ordering a steak versus the specialties on the menu.  Just go in and try a few then buy a cone.

The flavors change daily, and on the afternoon we visited, we were told Rocky Road, Browned Butter, Candied Violet, and Jasmine Green Tea were the most popular flavors.  I skipped the Rocky Road since that didn't sound as exciting--Blue Bell, after all, makes a Rocky Road.  The Browned Butter was too sweet and rich for me, while the Candied Violet tasted just like Skittles--again, too sweet.  I settled on the Jasmine Green Tea since the flavor was subtle even though it wasn't as creative as some of the other flavors.  They come as a perfectly round scoop the size of a tennis ball on top of a skinny cone; it was so cute, just like a cartoon ice cream cone.

So I got a double scoop in a cup (to transfer into my jar after I'd taken a bite (so good! hazelnuts and orange and frangelico), and paid for the 2x scoop... but as I was leaving he asked me if I was going back to somewhere with a freezer, and I told him about my box of dry ice, and he told me that I could have the rest of the pint if I wanted, as otherwise he was just going to eat it, since there was so little left (but still like two scoops--- P.S. 2 scoops is like half a pint, it's a ton of helado!)--- who would say no to that?

I also thought the cones were delectable---warm and crunchy and something I'd eat even without the ice cream.

However, finally, we have good ice cream outside of the the mission! This place rivals Bi-Rite, kicks Humphrey Slocombe's ass, and presents a closer destination than Mitchell's and Joe's. Easy parking is another plus. Right across the street from Hard Knox and Serpentine, this place is a great addition to the Dogpatch. The ice cream here is tasty and fresh. I tried the Candied Violet, the Ballpark, Burnt Sugar, and Cookies and Cream. The smooth and creamy texture of the Burnt Sugar was better than Bi-Rite's salted caramel although I still prefer the salted caramel flavor. I highly recommend the Burnt Sugar. I thought the waffle cone was the highlight; it tasted better than all the aforementioned ice cream shops. The staff is friendly and the building itself is quite minimalist.", "author": "Annie Y."}

Not the standard overpowering fake mint flavor I'm accustomed to, but actual fresh mint flavor.  The chocolate crunch was great too.  Be sure to try the Ballpark ice cream.  The Anchor Steam really comes through, but it's yeasty/beer-y flavor is nice.  Really great stuff.  Congratulations you guys!", "author": "Chris D."}

Although I was disappointed they were out of the flavor I wanted, I was happy when they let me sample the runner-up. I ended up ordering the Orange Blossom in one of their handmade cones. Overall the experience was great. It's a cool space in the dog patch, and definitely big enough to hold the large crowd it was drawing that day. There were other treats in the shop other than ice cream, and I can't wait to go back and try those out as well.", "author": "William d."}

Flavors change daily and I would love to make it back to try some more. I tried their candied ginger, which i liked a lot- little pieces of candied ginger and a nice, not too strong, not at all lacking flavor. I decided on the burnt sugar with vanilla bean. It was a nice combination, the burnt sugar is really strong, bordering on bitter- but the vanilla bean paired really well with it. I think that an ice cream place's vanilla is a strong indicator of how good their product is and they passed that test with flying colors! The vanilla bean is what they call \"dirty\" meaning that you can really see the pieces of bean in the ice cream. My girlfriend had the buttered rum and chicory coffee. Both of those flavors were great as well, strong but not overpowering. The cone was ok. Handmade, which I really appreciate. \nI think this place would benefit from some art on the walls, but the atmosphere wasn't bad at all. The person who helped us was super friendly.", "author": "Ela F."}

After sampling a few flavors, I bought a cone of peanut butter and jelly and then a couple pints, one of candied violet and one of half mint chocolate chip, half candied ginger.  Incredible stuff.  The waffle cone had just been made in front of me.  I served the ice cream to a foodie friend and my girlfriend the next day and they loved it too. The shop itself is as well thought out as the ice cream.  All the spoons, bowls, cups, etc. are compostable.  And the couple who own it are great people, super friendly, unassuming, and they make everything they sell themselves, except for one thing: the malt balls.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-26", "description": "This is my very first review even though I've signed up for an account long ago because this place is delicious. All their ice cream flavors seem like they've truly put thought into each one because there hasn't been a flavor I've tried that's sup-par.  I really like how all the flavors listed on their menu actually taste like what they say they should be too. Birthday Cake? Yup, vanilla ice cream with bits of white cake and sprinkles. Black Tea? Wow...it really tasted like black tea and even had the dry tannic aftertaste like drinking a cup of good black tea. I think this is the only ice cream shop that actually has a good amount of seating too. Bi-Rite is such a tight squeeze no matter the weather outside. My favorite cookie is the Cherry Chocolate. I'd only say that if you're someone who has to have plain vanilla or plain chocolate, you might be disappointed because they really are creative with their flavors here...bumping up classic chocolate to another exciting level.", "author": "Elizabeth D."}
