Vegetables were still slightly crunchy (which is right). \nVegetable fried rice - I've already commented... but the most flavorful veggie fried rice we've eaten... and did I mention that my 4 children loved it?\n\nWe're passing through San Francisco going back north. So glad we found this place.\n\n5 stars is the best rating we could give. My girls voted and said they'd have given it a 7 Star is that was possible.", "author": "Brandon W."}

Seeing as it's on the narrow and winding Diamond Street, street parking is sparse, but there is a small lot across Chenery St behind it. Bart really puts this little strip of restaurants on the map, as well as a couple Muni lines.\n\nThe interior was quaint like many traditional Chinese restaurants. They have quite a few larger tables; I wouldn't be scared to come here with a group of about 8 or less. We went on a Wednesday evening and I'd say it was about 60% full.\n\nThey have complimentary tea, upon request. We ordered beef chow mein, kung pao chicken (I highly advise), and an eggplant dish. The veggie dish ended up being my favorite. It was pretty oily like most Chinese food, but not overwhelmingly so; and it was very tasty. Our waiter was attentive and did not leave our water glasses empty. Overall very average experience; won't make a point to return.", "author": "Navila H."}

A couple ordered food from here and brought it to the bar we were watching the Warriors game at, and oh man, with that delicious smell of Chinese takeout, I just had to ask where they got it from!  She said it's her favorite Chinese spot in the city and pretty much swears by it, so I gave it a bookmark for future reference.\n\nOne night, my sister and I needed to eat some dinner and most places were either closed or almost closing, so we decided to try Win Garden.  Staff were really chill and got our order in and out quickly.\n\nWe ordered the Korean Fried Chicken and the General Tso's Chicken, and a small box of white rice.  We appreciated that their take out containers have a corner slit open so the food doesn't get soggy or whatever.  Both dishes were really good!  The General Tso's Chicken was flavorful and the Korean Fried Chicken was crispy.  The General Tso's Chicken even came with some broccoli.\n\nThey're great for take-out, and delivery is free with a minimum purchase of $20.  I'm glad that couple recommended this place to me and that it's actually a decent restaurant!", "author": "Stephanie Z."}

I don't think I was looking for anything special when I got off at the Glen Park BART station, just something for dinner on one of my solo nights when Jamie W. was busy being civic minded. Me, I get busy eating something he probably wouldn't want anyway. I was strolling along Diamond eyeing several places crowded with lingering diners and just happened upon this nondescript Chinese restaurant by accident. As far as the customers, there was only one couple in the entire place.\n\nI had a feeling they were related to the owner since they were taking up a large party table all by themselves (photo: http://bit.ly/2nR8JFo). I could tell this was a serious operation by the unsmiling faces of the staff. Their menu was also eight pages long with small print. It was a fakakta novel. Not Kafka, fakakta. It was a lot to study without Cliff Notes, but I decided to start with the $9.95 Garlic Spinach with a big bowl of white rice (photo: http://bit.ly/2njoadl). It was a no-frills treatment that still satisfied, and the portion was more than enough for one.\n\nSpeaking of which, I decided to splurge a bit and ordered the $13.95 Roast Duck Half (photo: http://bit.ly/2nKeDat). I was just having a major hankering for duck, and with the crispy skin and fatty meat were definitely what I was wanting. I ignored the plum sauce on the side and barely nibbled on the oil-drenched bok choy. It was just the duck I needed to gnaw. Fortunately I took half of it home before I made a pure glutton of myself. The service was an exercise in discipline, friendly not so much. So back to my original question...was it Win for the win? It was more like a draw.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...solid dishes, no big whoop\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...spacious, only moderately atmospheric\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...efficient\nTOTAL - 3 stars...no-frills but it satisfies if you are in a Peking kind of mood", "author": "Ed U."}

Even though the menu clearly states that the salad dressing contains peanuts, he brought out her food with a dressed salad.

I always find street parking so that usually isn't a problem but being the nature of the location, you might have to search for one depending when you come.\n\nI would like to say that this is one of the cleaner Chinese restaurants I've been too. No sticky tables, condiments haven't been sitting on the table for years, & they provide you with silverware (knives included) & metal chopsticks. Linen napkins are provided as well, which just shows they really make an effort to go beyond.\n\nService has been great. Mandy, the owner is very helpful, & always checks in with you as well as keeps your water glass full. They will also bring the hot sauce and soy sauce to your table in a saucer & accompanied with tiny spoon for serving. Talk about attention to detail!\n\nFood is always great. I think they have the best sizzling rice soul in SF. Broth is very clean & they give a lot of protein for the price of $5.95 for a cup. And keep in mind I'm a big eater but the cup order is huge! Chow mein is delicious...big portions. Oh and try the Korean Chicken Wings...sticky, salty, spicy, & crispy!\n\nAll in all, I found my go-to restaurant when I have that craving for Chinese food.

You get house egg drop soup (typical specimen) and a small salad on a plate with your rice and your entree. I had the garlic twice-cooked pork and it was fine. You have to ask for hot sauce or soy sauce. Chopsticks are the Korean skinny metal kind which only work for me when copious amounts of beer are on hand; I had to resort to my fork.\n\nIt's a pleasant, clean room and was busy at lunchtime but with good service.

One little tart the size of HALF the palm of your hand at the nearby main market costs nearly $5!!  The great thing is they accept CC. \n \nSo Win Garden's had changed again from serving dim sum at the door to now being only a sit-down restaurant.  Well the ambiance is certainly worth your $10-$15 with the walls and floors and bathroom in decor. It's spacous enough for many tables so groups of 4 or more are certainly ok. The service is punctual and courteous.  \n\nGo for the lunch special mainly under $10 which includes a soup, your choice of rice(brown, fried, white) or chow mein, and a salad.  Personally, I think the salad makes the meal more nutritious and a fuller meal even if you're not getting such a large amount of the main dish.  Dining on the soup beforehand also will make you fuller. They give more than enough rice or chow mein. You could also add an appetizer for another $5-$8.  \n\nObviously if you want deals on chinese food, the combo meal takeout at Sweet Delight Bakery at 4476 Mission or bento special deliveries by Golden Moon at 2511 Geneva Ave  or Kome buffet in Daly City would be your best bet.

As soon as I walked in the restaurant, I had a feeling I'd be disappointed. The menu had no Chinese on it, and some names of the dishes made no sense. It was clearly not an authentic place for Chinese people.\n\nWe've ordered mainly dim sum dishes because that's what our guide initially advertised it as. Some of them are:\n- Avocado spring roll: ...what? Anyway, couldn't taste the avocado at all, don't even know what's in there.\n- Shrimp dumplings: the dough was a lot thicker and harder than I expected.\n- Char siu ribs: some parts of the ribs were ok, most of it was very dry.\n- Beef chow mein: not bad, tastes just like the typical fast food pad Thai.\n- Pot stickers: only thing I'd actually recommend. Generous proportion of meat, thin dough, fried just enough. \n- String bean chicken: beans were not the flat Chinese ones, and were pretty hard and not cooked enough.\n\nWe just came back from a 3 hours hike so I was hungry and was pretty full by the end of it nonetheless. We were a big group and it came out to 16$ per person including tax and tips. Not bad but on the higher end for dim sum. I didn't feel like it was worth the quality of food overall.", "author": "Ivy L."}

I should really minus 2 stars from my review but since I like the food so much, just taking off 1 star. \n\nOverall, solid Americanized Chinese food. Best general tsos I've had in SF.

You can pass on these as they are really bland and not as crispy as I would like.\n   - Crab Rangoons: not bad, but I have definitely had better.....there was minimal crab inside....\n   - General Tsao's Meatless Chicken: the first few bites were pretty good as they are super crispy, but they are definitely on the sweet side so you do get sick of them fast.\n\nThe service was just okay as they were understaffed. I felt ignored, but once they did get to me, they were very accommodating. They pack your to-go stuff for you and they are very nice in bringing out chili and extra sauces. They just did not have enough workers to man the phone calls and order pick-ups, let alone the people eating inside the restaurant.\n\nI might come back here in the future, but I am not in a rush to come back.", "author": "Jennifer T."}

The first time we came here, we asked for hot tea, unknowingly, we were charged for the hot tea. We were also charged more for the dish that was on the menu a lot lower. We then spoke to the employee and they adjusted the price. When you order from here, make sure if you're looking for meat, you let them know, its the meat one. My bf ordered the orange chicken and I think he ordered wrong, but we ended up getting the vegetarian option, which I was very disappointed in. We always like to order the potsticker, the crispiness and the inside tastes amazing. The potsticker also tastes very similar to ling lings potsticker. The sauce is very identical as well, which was great. I suggest ordering a potsticker, orange chicken, and fried rice. They're wonton soup is okay, I wasn't a huge fan of it, but it is very popular. They add in snap peas and chicken pieces into the soup which is very interesting. Service is mediocre, nothing too special.

Do you eat eggs?\" I really appreciated her being so aware of vegan eating that she thought of asking this. When I told her that I don't, even though obviously this was my error for not checking ahead of time, she was so sweet and offered me some veggie spring rolls instead.\n\nTo add to the kindness, I mentioned that I had my dog with me waiting tied up outside, and The woman offered to bring the food to us outside so I could stay with my dog! Really nice. Then when she brought me the food, I offered to give her the turnip cakes back, and she said to keep them, so I'm giving them to my friend who's not vegan.

Unfortunately our organizer and myself, one of us Asian, the other northern European heritage could not get the other 8 Caucasians in our party to order Chinese Family style so we could have had quite the banquet. Oh well, so the 2 of us had our own mini banquet. \n\nBut everyone loved the food, even the 3 vegetarians. \n\nWe had green onion pancakes which were the best I've ever had. As others have said they were not oily at all and a great spicy onion taste. \n\nWe also had the Ma Po Tofu with ground pork which was our favorite. I've never cared for tofu that much but this dish was great. On the spicy side and lots of heat. About at my tolerance level for spicyness and I don't know if you can get it toned down or not. \n\nAnother spicy dish was Kung Pao Calamari but I didn't like the Calamari in it. It was those strange scored things that you get when you order a mixed seafood dish and then wonder what those thingy things are. I don't know if it's a different part of the Calimari or if they score it with a cross hatched tool but I've never liked the taste or texture but at least I know what the critter is in mystery meat Chinese assorted seafood. On the other hand our Meetup group host liked the dish. \n\nOur host said that the Hot and Sour Soup was excellent and trusting him because we seemed to like the same things, I found he was on point. I don't care for most of the give away Hot and Sour Soups but a good one is very good as was this one. \n\nI had a sample of one of the other dinners in our Meetup group's Crab Rangoon, the cream cheese and crab puffs and it was the best I've ever had. \n\nI had a taste of some of the other dishes at our table but can't remember now just that it was all great and large portions like typical Chinese restaurants and not the fru fru gourmet smaller portions. \n\nWin Garden I understand is very new and in the place where 2 other Chinese restaurants have failed so I hope they do well. I know that I'll be back soon. \n\nLovely people who have good service and great food.

Nothing was said back to me, but who ever it was hung up on me again. At this point, I call my bank to make sure this restaurant did not charge my card. No charges. I call Win Garden for the 3rd time and the man who took my order answered. I then told him that I would like to cancel my order because of the awful customer service over phone and his responds was he was busy taking a customers order. Unbelievable!

Prawns with sweet pea was good and again, generous, but again, somewhat bland. Also had the onion pancakes. Win Garden's version of this dish are made thin and crispy...which I like, opposed to the many places that deliver a thick gummy mess. Not much of an onion flavor, but still, I would order it again. My sense is that Win Garden succeeds in using fresh and good quality ingredients, but really needs to bump up the intensity of their flavors. ...That special something that makes a dish zing!", "author": "Robert B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-06-30", "description": "The second- and last time- we ordered from here. Overpriced, poor quality and rude staff. Knowing it was Friday of a holiday weekend, I ordered online an hour in advance; specifying the pickup time as 8:05 PM (the order website has you do this, it's not a special thing). Arrived at just that time and found the food completely stone cold. They'd obviously made it was soon as order came in, disregarding the specified pick up time. The expensive Garlic Broccoli was not as pictured as chinese broccolini-type vegetable, stir fried with a sauce.. It was just plain, virtually raw brocolli, no sauce and only a sprinkling of chopped garlic, not stirfried- maybe steamed for 30 seconds? It was raw! - for $11! The roast duck was advertised as a half duck but obviously wasn't- there was no wing and only half a leg & who knows how much more of the \"half\" was missing.The salt & pepper chicken wings tasted like the meat was going bad & also overpriced at $13.The shrimp dumpling wrapper was really gummy inside, vegetarian potstickers were bland & not tasty at all.. I so regret not going to San Tung for their fabulous dry fried greenbeans ($7.25) and wings ($10); so much better pricing and quality..On top of it, staff was rude. The website doesn't allow you to pay in advance if you pick up, so had to stand there waiting as food got even colder, as gal (30's, with orthodonture) took phone orders . Other staff were milling around, wiping tables & sweeping and standing in doorway of kitchen looking out; so I asked to pick up my order as gal was on phone. Gal got mad and said \"we busy!!\" (apparently I'm not). The name on the receipt on the bag was not mine or anything close to mine (\"Lars\") , but when I questioned if it was the right order, she got mad and tore that corner of the receipt off - weird! Sixty dollars for take-out food for two w/o any drinks or dessert- and she can't even be bothered to say \"thank you\" or  \"enjoy your dinner\" or \"come again\".. she just took my money in a cold, hurried way.", "author": "Sue W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-18", "description": "Since this is the only Chinese restaurant that I know of in Glen Park and is walking distance from my home, I WANTED to love this place . . . .I really WANTED to . . .but I just didn't. \n\nI was pet-sitting for a friend while she was on vacay in Paris and strolled across this place during one of my many doggie walks.  Normally, I only window browse because I can't go inside any shops with the dog but this time, I was so hungry that I came up with the idea of calling in my order from my cell phone and letting them know I was right outside the door.  Searching for my cellphone while balancing an antsy dog, a plastic bag full of dog poop, and another plastic bag full of dog treats proved to be more difficult than I bargained for so I plopped myself down on the sidewalk while I searched.  That's when the waiter popped his head out of the restaurant (probably to see why I was there).  He was very polite and agreed to take my order and bring the food out to me when it was done.  \n\nI ordered the Chinese broccoli with chicken ($9.95) and the jalapeno fried rice ($8.95).  The food was done in 15 minutes and cost $20.95 (or $25 with tip).  I was SO excited about finding the place and couldn't wait to bring it home and try it.  I actually live in the Excelsior/Portola neighborhood but don't enjoy walking down Mission as much as Glen Park (Glen Park is just so charming!).  I have family visiting me soon and was looking for nearby places that they can walk to while I'm at work and, since my dad LOVES Chinese food, I hoped that this could be THE spot.  \n\nBut, unfortunately, despite loving the location of the restaurant, appreciating the staff, and finding the appearance of the restaurant to be nicer than what is available on Mission Street, I just REALLY couldn't get past the food and would probably walk over to Henry Hunan's for Chinese in the future rather than this spot.  The portions were plentiful (my order could have fed 2-4 people) and the prices were reasonable however the Chinese broccoli and chicken dish was actually rabe and chicken.  I know that Chinese broccoli looks a lot like rabe but rabe is distinctively different in taste (much more bitter) and has enough visual differences (leaf edges and size of broccoli florets are different) that the chef should have spotted the mistake.  I find rabe to be too bitter for my palate and can only stand to eat it in small quantities or when it's disguised by other food components. Although the vegetable was cooked beautifully, I couldn't enjoy it. Since the dish was mostly rabe and was the main ingredient, the mistake was just too much to bear.\n\nAnd the jalapeno fried rice was not very good.  It wasn't the worst fried rice I had (that award goes to a restaurant in San Antonio, TX which served inedible fried rice) and it wasn't so disgusting that I COULDN'T eat it but it was bad enough that I didn't want to.  There were no jalapenos in the jalapeno fried rice but there was plenty of stale red hot chili oil (I don't know why a new restaurant would have stale oil either).  There was also some other weird smell/taste to the dish that I know I had before but couldn't quite identify. And, oddly, after sifting through the rice to pick out meat (for the dog) I found a single shrimp in the fried rice.  I don't know if shrimp was supposed to be included or not (I don't remember) but thought it was odd that I would have a quart of fried rice and a single shrimp in it.  Boo!\n\nIn all, I give the food 2 stars & the service 4 for an overall rating of 3.  So sorry Win Garden, but I probably won't be back.", "author": "Linda H."}

It's a shame that the rice bowls are priced separately rather than per guest because that would easily give this place a solid 4 stars.

The BEST garlic eggplant ever. It's not so easy to plate a perfect version of this classic vegetarian dish, yet Win Garden avoids grease and over-cooking of this, as all dishes, to deliver just what we asked for: medium spicy throughout, piping hot, soft-chewy-sweet-spicy goodness.  Calamari Kung Pao delivered just the same perfection. \n\nBrown and white rice, all noodle dishes:\nPerfect! \nRice and rice noodles seem such easy things to cook -and they are! - yet far too few restaurants match Win Garden's attention to detail in buying high quality grains and steaming/wok-saut\u00e9ing them to perfection.  \n\n\n\nOur waiter last night was attentive without being officious. He listened to just what we wanted and made sure the kitchen used no msg, little oil, plenty of spice without going overboard.  Szechuan the way it should be.  \n\nWe've had takeout from here twice before and been delighted with soups, noodles, stir fries.... We enjoyed dining in last night: simple, spotlessly clean decor matched the unpretentious, honest food and efficient, friendly service -- all at reasonable prices. \n\nSo close to BART -- just a 3 minute walk from Glen Park Station -- less than a 10 minute gentle stroll from anywhere in Glen Park and close enough to most other SF neighborhoods to get here fast - or enjoy free home delivery - that I hope the place succeeds wildly but fear it might become so popular we could have trouble finding a seat in future.\n\nHot and sour soup was both hot and sour -- and just a tad overly salted. Still, it had layers of umami and a great mix of spicy, salty, and naturally sweet, to make up for the heavy hand with salt.  \n\nWe will try the free delivery soon. Or just pick it up on the way home again since it's so darn easy. Can't wait to invite friends to meet here.", "author": "Scott C."}

(This is critical because I have had to chase my Pommies down the street when other deliver folks did not close the gate after being asked to make sure it was slammed shut.)\n\nThe food was hot and delicious.  We ordered Beef with Chinese Broccoli, Tofu in Black Bean Sauce, Walnut Prawns, and Singapore Rice Noodles.  \n\nWe have found that a restaurant that does poorly on the Walnut Prawns doesn't do that well with anything.  The Walnut Prawn expert in our group thought the dish was perfect.  Lots of prawns, walnuts, and puffed rice noodles.  It was pretty to view and tasty.\n\nMy dish to order was the Beef with Chinese Broccoli.  I love Chinese Broccoli and Beef.  This dish was full flavored with both the broccoli and beef perfectly cooked.  It was a very colorful dish that was delicious to see and even better to eat.  Excellent.\n\nPerfectly cooked braised tofu in black bean sauce is sometimes hard to get.  This lovely dish was graced with braised tofu, mushrooms and blackbean sauce.  Yummy with great mouth appeal.\n\nThe Rice Noodles, Singapore Style were perfect.  We ordered one order per person because we wanted some for breakfast or lunch tomorrow.  They were delicious.  There were prawns, meats, and veggies that were all perfectly cooked with the light curry flavored noodles.  They were soooooooo yummy.\n\nEverything was fresh and fresh tasting.

Win Garden is really good! The prices are decent and the inside of the restaurant is simple yet clean. Service is quick and friendly. But the best part? Yes, it's definitely the food and no, not msg lol. This place tastes even better than Red Jade!! In my book, if you can make vegetarians dishes taste good, then you definitely know what you're doing. Here, they make the best eggplant lunch special that I've ever tasted hands down. Yes, this establishment is new, but trust me when I tell you that the chef knows what he's doing back there and I'm so happy that I no longer have to travel all the way to church for green beans, sesame chicken or eggplant tofu...when we've got a great little chinese place here in glen park! So happy that we finally have a good chinese place after Hong Sing establishment closed. Give Win Garden a chance- they also have a dim sum menu too! \n\nSidenote:\nI just read some overly harsh reviews that was obviously written by some snobby wannabe critic...anyway, this place is definitely comparable to some of the other restaurants you would find in Chinatown. Maybe it's just me, but it's so annoying to hear ppl bash chinese food ... FYI - PF Chang's is not authentic chinese food in my book...and neither are the other fru fru places that purport to serve it too. The taste here is actually very close to what the food tastes like in China. Obviously, not every dish is palatable to everyone...so use your common sense and order something else because sometimes telling the waiter what you're looking for is smarter than ordering something you hope tastes like Panda Express because this ain't Panda Express and it ain't PF Chang's either. So don't get it twisted. If you're looking for yummy good old fashioned Chinese food - then this is the place to go. Good eats ya'all!!", "author": "Rayne W."}

I told him soy sauce was fine and to tell the chef... so he went back there and returned with the food saying that he was sorry that the food had already been prepared. The guy was nice and considerate, perhaps overly so. But maybe he needs to learn what different types of foods cause allergies, since he works in a restaurant. An allergy to nuts/peanuts doesn't mean an allergy to soy sauce. He gave me two packets of soy sauce and chili oil. I came home with white chow fun and white chicken. It tasted very underwhelming, even after I added a whole packet of soy sauce. Now I have a headache from the MSG in all that soy sauce I added and no satisfied taste buds to show for it.

The food was yummy, good sized portions, fresh and arrived quickly. WIn Garden is several steps up from the quality of the food in the previous two Chinese restaurants that occupied the same space, and beats out other Chinese delivery I've sampled in this area. Glad they are here in GP, hope they stay.", "author": "Lisa M."}

The spring rolls are a must get and same with the crab puff. If you are in the area and like Chinese food should should defiantly eat here.", "author": "Gram N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-24", "description": "I really hope this restaurant makes it.  I was depressed when the previous Chinese restaurant in this spot, China House, closed after only 6 months.  Glen Park needs a decent Chinese restaurant.  I've been to Win Garden twice now, and I ready to say that it has found one.  It is better than China House, and is the kind of good (but not fancy or expensive) Chinese restaurant that every neighborhood should have.  If you live in Glen Park, you should go here.", "author": "Daniel A."}
