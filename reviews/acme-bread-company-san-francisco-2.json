Acme rustic sweet bread goes well with oysters, seafood and their rustic tomato stew. It's like you are in heaven.\nBut anyway back to Acme Bread Company - this bakery has excellent and great bread. I go for the rustic sweet bread, pain de levain, sometimes the sourdough, and their baked treats adds another level of deliciousness.\nI get a loaf of the rustic sweet bread every 2 weeks or if I come by to SF Ferry building for food shopping.\nThis is also the closest location to get my fix of Acme Bread.

Nope. The closest garage is the embarcadero center and baby, it ain't cheap. If you feel lucky you could try for nearby street parking, and there is a smaller not well defined lot in back by the Gandhi statue-but I've haven't figured out yet if that is official non ticketed/towed parking or just people being innovative. The good news is that this is a transportation hub-ferries, the streetcar, bicycle hub and this part of the city is extremely walk able.\n\nThis is a small walk up spot-like a lot of things in the ferry building-and as such does not have dedicated seating. Most folks grab and go, and if they feel like sitting they go out to the ocean facing benches behind the building.\n\nThe focus here is on the bread. They make dozens of rolls and loaves some of which are arguably the best in the city. There are no weaknesses in the lineup-the quality is extraordinarily high, but my regular go-to's are the Italian style country loaf and the sourdough. Hard to go wrong with those. They also have range of pastries (usually but not exclusively french styled) racked up in front in an amazing display case. They also have a limited selection of ready to go sandwich thingys which are what the lines are for mostly. I note that they can run out of some things towards the afternoon. Unless you get there in the first wave of folks, there can be lines which don't move as quick as you'd like, but overall it's well worth your time and money. Pricing may seem high-but not once you consider the location or the sheer goodness of the product. Loaves and sandwiches are priced at six bucks or so and while the pastries are by piece-2-3 dollars starting-it's hard to just buy one. \n\nSo, come for the sandwiches, but stay for the breads.", "author": "Steven W."}

It is located in the Ferry building so at the peak lunch hour like every other place it had a huge line. Acme Bread Company specializes in different kinds of bread so it is not a natural choice for lunch, but due to a late breakfast, I just wanted to do a light sandwich so Acme fitted the bill perfectly. I decided to get the Green Garlic Sandwich ($6.48). I managed to get the last sandwich so it is advisable to come early if you want to get your hands on one.\n\nI would describe the sandwich as minimalistic yet terrific. It is garlic, roasted red peppers, balsamic vinaigrette and black pepper all housed in a baguette. The sandwich has a nice crunch but it is not overly crunchy. It has a nice chew but is not overly chewy. Yes it is pricy but fine for the location. Yes it is a small portion which will do only for a light meal, but it is totally worth it.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

It's a light sweet bread chock full of currants and orange (or is it apricot?).  The olive bun had a more typical bread roll texture with pieces of green olive. The olives are salty but not too salty, and in a great ratio to the bread.  I had bites of both with a cup of coffee.

From baguettes to rolls to batards, Acme Bread has a huge variety of artisan breads that are addictive to any carb lover. All of the breads are made organic flour and baked right at this location inside the Ferry Building. One of the best things about this Acme Bread location is that you can eat right on the waterfront with a beautiful view of the bay. They also offer sandwiches with fresh, local ingredients served on their rustic sweet baguette. The fillings in the sandwiches are not excessive, but instead minimal (or just enough), which allows you to taste more of their fresh bread.\n\nRecently, I tried the Cheese Sandwich, which has Cowgirl Creamery's triple cr\u00e8me cheese, fruit jam, arugula, and black pepper. The sandwich was delicious...especially if you are a quality cheese and bread type of person. The sweet fruit jam and arugula gives the sandwich nice additional flavors. Such simple ingredients, yet so tasty. \n\nI also tried the Roasted Beet Sandwich, which has marinated roasted beets, chevre with horseradish, and watercress. If you love beets, you will love this sandwich. It's very tasty and the horseradish give it a little kick (not overpowering at all). Almost any sandwich made on Acme Bread is guaranteed to be good. In addition to the sandwiches, I've really enjoyed their Pain Epi and Green Onion Slab.\n\nTheir prices are reasonable too. Currently, all sandwiches are $6.17 (I know it's gone up over the years).  \n\nAcme Bread Company is famous in the Bay Area for their organic, fresh, and tasty breads and this location provides access to them all.

My first time was 5 years ago when I tried their herb slab and it was awesome. It tasted so fresh and was perfect with a nice hot cup of coffee for breakfast. This time, I was at the Ferry Building for lunch and decided that I wanted something more than just bread so I decided to get one of their sandwiches. They only have 3 types (all $6.19 each), but by the time I got there, they only had 1 type left, which was the beet sandwich. I have to say as much as I like beets, I didn't really enjoy this sandwich. Its paired with chevre cheese, which I now realize I'm not a big fan of because the flavor is quite strong. The bread was a bit harder than I expected too. What I really wanted to try was their cheese sandwich so make sure to get there early. The sandwiches are probably fresher earlier too. It wasn't even 1pm when I got there.\n\nNext time I'm at the Ferry Building, I'll probably just stick with the bread and grab some cheese next door at Cowgirl Creamery. The sandwiches are a convenient option because they've essentially done that for you, but sometimes being able to choose the type of bread and cheese you want is better.", "author": "Alice L."}

I realized that they did not serve sandwiches past 2:30 pm. I had read some reviews and was aware that paying in cash = discount. These were not at all expensive. Since the sandwiches were not available, I tried to quickly list the breads I wanted. The service was not that great. There was only 1 group behind me but I still felt hurried. I think they are so used to customers who know exactly what they want that they have no time to entertain customers like me who are eager to try different kinds. I finally ordered some rolls and a cross bun. The breads were tasty with a good crusty exterior. Having the bread made me wonder....how old and artificial is the bread in most restaurants all around us where we get our burgers and sandwiches?! This is how bread is supposed to taste all the time...\nThis took me back to the time I used to have \"pav\" freshly baked from bakeries in India. While the breads here were delightful, I feel equally disappointed that a good piece of bread has to be so rare and sought after these days.", "author": "Tejashree M."}

The quality of their bread is definitely good, and I did enjoy using their rustic sweet bread to make sandwiches at home. \n\nOverall, while I can't really bring myself to give a very high rating to a bakery based on bread alone, I do think Acme is quality material and I will be coming back for more in the future, especially since they provide so many choices.", "author": "Mark O."}

I HATE YOU ACME FOR BEING THE DEVIL BUT I LOVE YOU SO DAMN MUCH!\n\n**1/2 off all day old breads - the seran wrapped ones on the side of the wall!**\n\nThis bakery is charmingly located in the center of San Francisco's Ferry Building along the pier at the Embarcadero. Although not its own facility, they bake their breads fresh in the large open kitchen behind the counter.\n\n1. Green onion slab - possibly one of my favorite breads of all time. It's incredibly soft and has a considerate amount of diced fresh scallions scattered throughout the loaf. The name \"slab\" accurately portrays what this bread is -- literally a SLAB of perfectly baked dough embedded with green onions. The inside is chewy and soft and will remain soft even after a while. Great with spreadable cheeses and does not have to be toasted. \n\n2. Sourdough cheese wheel - guilty pleasure. A generous mixture of (?) parmesan, asiago, and romano (?) cheese is melted on top of a large wheel of fresh sourdough. The saltiness of the cheese is not too overpowering. However, be warned that the sourdough is tough and chewy and will leave your jaws sore :( It can also tend to be greasy from the oils on the cheese so take a couple of napkins to go.\n\n3. Sourdough cheese roll - a nice, softer alternative to the sourdough cheese wheel. Good if you want something a little smaller for breakfast.\n\n4. Challah roll - one of my favorites. I believe it comes in plain, poppy, and sesame. I nabbed a sesame one before work and finished the whole thing before I even arrived to my office. It's a spongy, incredibly soft roll with a slightly sweet taste and the sesame seeds are toasted perfectly and compliment the plain tasting bun. \n\nAll in all, this is one of the best bakeries in the city. Everything is affordable and I see MANY people have acme cater their events. Usually there are only one or two guys working the counter so service can seem a little slow (they like to take their times with people picking up large orders) and unpredictable, but it's a small price to pay for the best bread ever.\n\nNote: cash only!", "author": "Shirley N."}

I would give it negative stars if I could.\n\nI went yesterday to pick up an herb loaf. When paying I was given the incorrect change back (I gave a $20 bill and was given back $1 and change instead of $16 and change).  When I corrected the employee, she looked at me and asked me if I was sure multiple times.  Fine, ok to ask once but don't ask me more than once.   \n\nThen she brings back another employee and together they tell me that, according to their company policy they can't give me change because they aren't sure if I'm being honest.  WTF.  In one single conversation they made me feel like a criminal.  There was no apology.  They continued to tell me that people do \"this\" to them all the time and asked me again if I was sure.  I have never felt so accused.  \n\nTheir policy is to count up the register at the end of the day to determine if I was correct or not and then mail me a check if I am right.  Are you kidding? Instead why don't you teach your staff to look at the money properly, repeat the transaction back to the customer so then there are no issues to begin with.  Empower your staff to take care of the customer.  I was so upset I told them I didn't even want the bread anymore.  The other employee told me that they will have the manager call me back right away.  \n\nDoes the manager call that day?  No.  My husband called later on and they told us that the manager will call me first thing in the morning.  Does she call in the morning?  No.  So we call again and turns out they wrote my number down wrong.  (Again, please train your employees better). \n\nFinally we get an apology and a confession I was correct and had gave them a $20 bill.  Honestly I could care less about $20.

Acme Bread Company is one of those things.\n\nSome places in the Ferry building are just little hubs/kiosk-type-things of a much larger location somewhere else in the city. Acme Bread Company actually makes their bread onsite.\n\nIt's perfect for taking home or a little snacky. I've been there about three times in the last week. First to get a cheesy bread roll for breakfast.\n\nThat is a beautiful mystery of a bread. It's bread, but somehow still holds its cheesy consistency. Is it because it's sourdough? Is it because it's probably baked with real love?\n\nThe second bread items I bought were large baguettes. You grab a hold of the bread, and you might even think, \"this is a really hard piece of bread.\" \nDo not bite right into this bread. Go home, cut it up, and use it to wipe up gravy, chili, pasta sauce, dip it in spinach dip, place cheese atop of it, or slather it with butter. The outside will be crunchy, but the inside will be the correct kind of chewy. The sourdough flavor will be mild but definitely there, and authentic.\n\nThe most recent item I purchased was a chocolate croissant. It smells like butter. It's flaky but not like bad dandruff. The consistency of the dark/semisweet chocolate is firm. These are made with real, true ingredients. What would send this treat over the edge would be these two things: a nice cup of coffee from probably Blue Bottle, and if it were a tiny bit warm.\n\nAs far as the lines go for this place, they may look long, but they move pretty fast.

However, we were waiting at the Oyster restaurant and I was really hungry, so I stole a little bit and OHMYGOD.  I should have known not to take a bite when it said \"walnut\" because I'm a huge sucker for bread with nuts!\n\nThe bread is soft on the inside with TONS of walnut, which gives it a nice chew/bite. The outside is crisp, but not firm enough where you have to really work to tear off a piece. The best part? It's just as amazing the next day! I've also had their cranberry walnut bread and I didn't like it as much; I think it's because the cranberry just made it too sweet. In the end, I was purposely looking for parts that didn't have cranberries in it.\n\nNow we get it from our local Whole Foods because San Francisco is way too far away. I honestly have no idea how much it is; I'm too blinded by that walnut-studded beauty to even glance at the price. I know they sell it in the Sunnyvale farmers' market as well, so if you're around Sunnyvale Saturdays 8am-1pm, grab a fresh loaf before they run out! \n*TIP: Whole Foods will slice the loaf if you go up to their bakery department and ask. \n\nSAVE YOURSELF WHILE YOU CAN.

I ended up spending the evening on the floor with a glass of ginger ale and the bread loaf and was constantly thanking my lucky stars for grabbing that bread as it was a total lifesaver that evening. I ate little bits of the round and it so incredibly good but I was afraid to eat too much. Soon after I got off the boat I was feeling better and later that night in the hotel room, I went to town on the bread. It was sooooo good.

But they're so good I completely forget about how dishevelled I look. The flakiness is a blessing and a curse...\n\nOther notable goodies are their flakey CINNAMON SWIRLS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I19ntZQrZxMn9gYOOK1rhg?select=TsQpdWCwSP6eCGXOC4vKsQ), gooey CINNAMON CURRANT LOAF (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I19ntZQrZxMn9gYOOK1rhg?select=5Uc3MyIZ1L3v69utTgtW2Q), and SOURDOUGH CHEESE WHEEL (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/I19ntZQrZxMn9gYOOK1rhg?select=_9_aaKCL5mJiI99yP4Ho3w).

Ever since Yanny S. ordered the cheese sandwich, I've been craving one.\n\nCrunchy fresh bread, mild and creamy cheese from Cowgirl Creamery, a bit of slightly sweet fruit jam, arugula and pepper.  Best sandwich I've had in a really long time, and I rarely like sandwiches (reasoning: I don't like hand-held foods).  This is offically my new favorite sandwich.\n\nService is awesome - the sandwiches are all room-temperature and pre-made, so you step up to the counter, order what you want, pay, and you're good to go.  Their bread is also reasonably-priced and IMO, much better than Boudin.  My favorite is their Pain Epi.  I literally finished a whole thing of it within 24 hours.\n\nCoworker had the salami sandwich, and the salami was majorly delicious as well, even though I didn't have the whole package (I pulled off a bit of the salami to sample).  Next time I'll try that.  The potato pesto one also sounds delicious (talk about carb overload) but since I'm not a fan of pesto, I may skip that one for good.\n\nExcuse me, CCG stomach is not happy with the cheese.", "author": "Tori S."}

Boy was I glad I did, because it had just come fresh out of the oven. \n\nWhile walking around the Ferry Building with a friend, trying to find a place to eat lunch, I was munching on the Pain Epi. When we sat down to start our lunch, I noticed I had eaten half of it in the span of less than 5 minutes. (I probably should have ran an extra 2 miles that day...)\n\nThat evening I shared my goodies with my boyfriend, his mother, and his little nephew from France to eat with cheese and pate. We scarfed it down like no other. \n\nSince then I have learned a little bit of self-discipline, as I have not gone back everyday to pick up a loaf of the Pain Epi. I work right across  from the Ferry Building and, trust me, it takes a lot of self-control to not go over there during my lunch. \n\nA word of advice to any Acme \"newbs\", such as I, make sure you get here early because these breads sell like hotcakes! I came after work one day to pick up a loaf of Pain Epi and they were all long gone. It was a very sad day for me...", "author": "Lisa T."}

My husband and I were here visiting for the weekend, when our friend brought us by and said we have to try the bread here.  To start with in the morning we bought a sourdough cheese roll, a rustic baguette, and a green garlic sandwich.  All were quite tasty as we munched our way through the day. If you want a sandwich, go early, as there is a limited supply and they sell out. Our friend said in the future, he would skip the salami for another type of sandwich, as there wasn't much salami on the sandwich. If you buy the salami sandwich, and enjoy a lot of meat on your sandwich, you'll probably want to get additional salami at the salami shop a few doors down.\n\nAs we went back through the ferry terminal to go home, we had to stop for more bread for breakfast on our drive home.  We got an onion slab, challah roll with poppy seeds, and another rustic roll.  The onion slab and rustic roll were great! Both were crusty on the outside, but soft and chewy inside.  The challah roll wasn't as great.  Our friend had another roll that was similar in texture to the challah roll, and it wasn't that great either.

This is honestly one of the best breads I have ever tasted in my entire life. I bought it from a store in Redwood City and it still tasted freshly baked - out of the oven and cooled style. I bought my loaf to make a GIANT sub sandwich with and while it satisfied every spot as a sandwich I could gorge it all by itself and still be satisfied. It's that good.\n\nThe outside isn't hard. It's perfectly pick-up-able with a slight crunch and a soft center. It reminds me of a rosemary potato bread loaf. It's a complete package as it, no over crisping or reheating. It's good to go. \n\nMy super sub sandwich of shame:\nAcme herb slab, monster meats: turkey bacon, turkey ham, smoked turkey, roast beef, cotti salami... cheese: edam, dill harvarti, provolone... red onion, tomatoes, red leaf lettuce... mayo, olive oil, herb seasonings, garlic powder, garlic salt and black pepper... honey mustard on the roast beef... this beats any deli!!! This is downright insane!!! I can't imagine how yummy it would be if I bought it freshly made and still warm from the shop. I might not be able to contain myself. I may get so weak in the knees that I might just pass out.\n\nThis bread really is pass out worthy. Honest.\n\nHerb slab is my new favorite. I can't wait to try the rest! I am now on a hunt to find out where they sell this bread on the Peninsula. I'm sure many gourmet stores will have it. My loaf was just under 5 bucks and worth every penny.

But regardless, once I tasted their delicious breads I was hooked. While there are so many great breads out there in San Francisco, Acme has a consistency that is full of win, on top of which their bread doesn't go rock hard and become inedible after a day sitting on the kitchen counter (cough cough semifredi). I like to fantasize about working here one day, as a labor of love. But we'll see.\n\nMy favorites here are the pan epis, and their walnut and cranberry bread (sooo perfect with  mild creamy cheese). Not to mention all of their delicious rolls that are perfect to take home, freeze and use for lunch.", "author": "Allyson S."}

Acme has amazing bread, and because of that, I love coming to the Ferry Building specifically for an Acme sandwich. The best plan of attack? Come in groups of three. On my latest visit, I did exactly that so that each of us could order a different sandwich on the Acme baguettes. We each got to sample the salami, the cheese, and the green garlic sandwiches, and they are each Marvelous!! My favorite is the green garlic sandwich because it has the garlic for a little bite, goat cheese for some tartness, and red peppers for a little sweetness.

As I do every weekend, I ended my run at the Acme Bread Company to pick up my favorite Mt. Tam cheese, jam and arugula sandwich for a mid afternoon snack.\n\nAs I was standing in line waiting patiently, I noticed that some fresh baguettes were just coming out of the oven.  I could smell the deliciousness in the air and I could see the heat waves undulating over the freshly baked bread.  I was drooling all over myself.  When my turn came up in line, I ordered my cheese sandwich and then asked the order taker if they would sell any of the fresh baguettes out of the oven (w/ desperate drooly look).  He hesitated, then told me that the current batch may not be for sale in their store, I asked if he could check, and he said, yes, I think I can sell you one.  So he heads back, gets me a fresh, warm baguette.\n\nAs I walked away, I can feel the heat emanating through the bag and I can't resist taking my first bite.  As I peel the paper bag back, I can smell the doughy bready aroma, it smells so good.  I squeeze the baguette ever so slightly in the bag and enjoy the crispy crunchy sound of the bread.  Then I take my first bite...The outside of the baguette is delicately crisp and the inside is warm, doughy, pillowy and ever so slightly chewy.  The taste is totally on point and flavorful, sooo delicious.  THE best bread I've ever had in my whole life!  This is the first time I've ever had a baguette fresh out of the oven and it's sublime.  It doesn't get any better than this.\n\nNote:  The poor order taker, he was a good guy, I think my weirdness threw him off so he gave me the wrong change.  I brought it up and he looked a little flustered.  He immediately remediated the situation and apologized.  I apologized back for causing so much trouble.  I was just grateful that he enabled me to have such a fabulous bread experience this morning.", "author": "Burrito M."}

I love it a lot and, like some relationships, sometimes too much in a not-so-healthy-stalker-kind-of-way.\n\nI've had two bread epiphanies in my life:\n\n1.  When  my older brother told me that I could squeeze an entire loaf of Wonderbread into a ball the size of a regulation baseball.  He described it in such a beautiful way that I immediately went to the kitchen and squeezed two loaves from the pantry into balls EXACTLY THE SIZE OF REGULATION BASEBALLS!!  My little seven year old mind was blown.  Meanwhile, my brother had removed himself far from the scene of the crime and I was left, holding the bread -um- balls.  My mother was not pleased and in no way impressed with the balls o' bread..\n\nThe epiphany (and moral to the story) was that my brother was evil.  Unfortunately, I fell for this kind of thing over and over and over again.\n\n2.  When I was in college, I lived in a dorm my freshman year.  Every Friday was 'steak' night where steak, baked potatoes, salad and sourdough rolls were served.  My friends and I would load up on dozens of these sourdough rolls and they served as Saturday morning breakfast for the regular event we named \"Drugs & Bugs\".  Cartoons were involved as well as other non-sanctioned substances.\n\nAhem.  \n\nHuh?  Oh yeah,  what was the bread epiphany?\n\nThe sourdough rolls were FANTASTIC!!  Probably my first conscious (albeit cosmically and chemically altered) recognition of really good bread.\n\n(Imagine many calendar pages flying and swirling about, the hands of a clock twirling about madly to denote the passage of time).\n\nAcme Bread.\n\nThe only thing better than the olive loaf are the olive rolls.  The olives-to-bread ratio is higher and quite perfect.  \n\nHave I mentioned the walnut bread? No?  Well, it's my 'little bit on the side' when I'm not mooning over the olive rolls.  This makes great toast, too.  \n\nRosemary rolls.... On my Saturday trips to the Ferry Plaza Farmer's Market, breakfast consists of a Blue Bottle quad latte and an Acme rosemary roll.", "author": "Nancy W."}

There are no bells and whistles here. No avocado-mango salsa. No curried shrimp coleslaw. No piled-high mounds of roast beef. There are no powerhouse flavors to bowl you over or extraneous fillings (iceberg lettuce, I'm looking at you) to stretch out bland flavors to fill a stomach. A perfectly-executed Parisian sandiwch (Salame, here) is the elegant pinnacle of sandwichery.\n\nAnd here, we have that near-perfect sandwich. Salami is as good as I've tasted, cut slightly thicker than I'm used to, but with an amazing melting mouth-feel that is never unctuous. Enough cornichon to brighten the flavor without overpowering the meat. Butter bringing the entire enterprise together, and, of course, supreme bread.\n\nIf I have any criticism, it's that the sandwich was maybe a little small for the price, but perhaps that is more to blame on my appetite having been artificially inflated by larger-than-my-head deli subs than any fault of the sandwich here itself. My co-luncher got the green garlic sandwich, which was great in its own way, but I'll stick with the simplicity and grace of this three-note harmony every time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-25", "description": "Acme Bread is an artisan bread bakery located in the Ferry Building Marketplace (merchant #15). Their breads (made with organic flour + hormone-free milk) are baked fresh during the daytime and smell heavenly as you pass by. I highly recommend their Herb Slab, Pain d'Epi, and Olive Bread. So fresh and tasty! The owners are intimately connected with the world famous Chez Panisse restaurant across the Bay since the husband was the restaurant's first in-house baker in the 1970s. I remember a funny scene around Christmas when a Russian tourist family of three visited. A very young boy was very impatient with the wait, to which the mother replied \"honey, we're Russians in a bread line!\" Both she and her husband exchanged knowing looks, but the boy was too young to appreciate her humor. I recommend buying some bread here and dipping it with the Persian Lime Olive Oil from Stonehouse California Olive Oil (merchant #28) located in the same marketplace! SO GOOD! Lastly, this place is CASH ONLY. All in all, this is a must-stop for me whenever I come to the Ferry Building, regardless of the lines!", "author": "Andy C."}

But one thing I miss that I can't find in the US is their amazing fresh bread. \n\nFresh bread is everywhere and cheap in France!  I can slowly stroll two doors down from where I live, and pick up a just-out-the-oven baguette for 4 francs (about 80cents at the time).  It's not uncommon for my roommate and I to finish one long baguette each as an afternoon snack.  It's like Pringles, once you start, you can't stop.  And often we don't even put anything on the baguette, not even butter.  That's how good they were. \n\nACME definitely fills that void for me.  So it's not next door to where I live and it's not like 80 cents a baguette (there IS inflation and the weakening of the dollar).  But the bread is darn good. \n\nI have had the ciabatta many times.  They are great for panini sandwiches.  And they stay good for a few days.  If they do get slightly hard, just pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds and they will get softer and chewy again.   The herb slab is also really tasty and the dough is super chewy which is how I like my bread.  \n\nI like it when I bring the bread back to work and every so often I can smell the lovely bread-y fragrance.

Is the bread pretty decent and better than what you get from a Safeway bakery?  Sure but it is not worthy of the lofty ratings and praise it seems to consistently get.  \n\nAcme makes a really good sourdough bread but in SF that is no big deal.  Like making a decent slice in NYC or a cheesesteak in Philly.  It takes a lot to really stand out since there is a lot of decent competition.  As for the other things I have tried at Acme, the quality has been mixed.  I have gotten a couple of different French loafs and they have varied widely in quality.  One had a nice consistency while another didn't have the nice, light interior a quality French loaf should have.  A few of the specialty loafs have been decent but there hasn't been one that really jumps out at me either.  Guess it depends upon individual preference more though.     \n\nNot exactly sure what it is but the dough is just not quite right most times.  Maybe they aren't kneading the bread enough manually or it just might be the oven.  One thing that I heard from a friend who is a baker is that the quality of the water on the West Coast makes it difficult to make good dough in general.  \n\nAcme still makes a quality loaf of bread most times but it is far from the best bread I have ever tasted.

Our apt was in mission, but we came here one morning for breakfast because it was clear Acme was one of the best bakeries in the bay based on the fact that so many restaurants used them.  Acme breads we had in restaurants were consistently good---crisp crust, chewey crumb.  When we came here, we got the croissant and found it to be excellent---best we've tased in SF (better than Tartine and Thorough).  We also got a ham+cheese turnover, demi-baguette and cranberry-walnut bread.  The turnover was a little disappointing---all the cheese ran out and hardened and the ham was in cubes rather than slices, so it didn't integrate with the dough as well as it could have.  The demi-baguette was on the soft side, both crust and crumb, though it might have been done intentionally since I think it was marketed as a bread for sandwiches.  The cranberry-walnut bread was bad---too hard, under seasoned, heavy, tasted like cardboard.  Might have been better if they had been willing to slice it.  They said \"no we don't slice\" and \"it should be easy to break off pieces\".  It wasn't easy, but we struggled anyway until it was clear the taste wasn't worth struggling for.  So, they're clearly an excellent bakery, but not sufficiently perfect to warrant 5 stars.  Thorough was a better overall experience.", "author": "Jason R."}

The croissants were dry and not very tasty. I thought the almond croissant lacked flavor - there were a couple of clumps of the almond filling. The morning bun was dry. Frankly, they tasted stale even though we were there very early in the morning.", "author": "CC C."}
