I ordered their Tonkotsu Ramen ($12.95) which came with sliced pork as well as pork belly, bamboo, spinach, green onion and a half boiled egg.  So what did I think?\n\nIn terms of customer service, staff didn't disappoint.  Friendly, checking on me, and making my experience a great one.  The food?  Welllllll.....\n\nIf i'm being honest, I thought the ramen was pretty bland.  It likely starts with the broth, which after slurping for a bit seemed like it was lacking in the salt and flavors i'm used to.  The actual ingredients were nothing special and the quantity could have been a bit more for the price.\n\nLocated right at the corner of Kearny Street and Columbus ave, it was easy to see this place with the large \"soft opening\" banner on its store front.  I walked so I can't really speak on the parking situation, though there wasn't a lot that I saw.\n\nWould I go back to Toppu Ramen when i'm back in San Francisco?  If I lived here, maybe i'd give them a second chance, but chances are when i'm back in my ramen mode in the city, i'll be shopping elsewhere.", "author": "Jamarcus T."}

I was really craving ramen and this place stood out to me (maybe it was the big grand opening sign ). I was extremely excited to try it, but was very displeased by all of the food.\n\nWe'll start with the ramen. The noodles were literally the same noodles as top ramen. I won't get into why that bothered my so much, but I didn't like them one bit. The broth was decent, but mostly tasteless, as were the rest of the ingredients in the ramen. It was disgusting, it was just bland. The fact that I was craving ramen, and was starving, should've made that dish taste amazing, but it just wasn't there.\n\nWe got a few appetizers too. Sweet potato fries, short ribs and pork belly sticky buns. I wouldn't say I would order any of those items again, especially the sticky buns. It didn't help that all of their meat was about 90% fat, 10% meat.\n\nThe environment was fine. Our server was nice. But what was really interesting to me was that tip was included on our check. Which is normal for nicer restaurants, but this was an extremely casual place. It didn't bother us too much, but I just thought it was interesting.\n\nSafe to say I likely won't come back here.

The portion size was kind of small. Each bun was approximately $2. \n\nI also ordered Fried Turnip Cake with House Sauce ($7.98) and somehow ended up with Fried Turnip Cake with no House Sauce ($7.98). The turnip cake was good. It reminded me of a mixture of tofu and french fries. It came out really hot (temperature wise). I would probably not get it again though because it was really expensive. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Spicy Miso Pork Belly Ramen ($14.98) and loved it because the pork was so fatty he thought he was gaining a lot of weight... which he liked.

My sister, her boyfriend, and I came upon this place because we were looking for asian food in Chinatown but didn't want anything too oily. It was around 3pm so many place were pretty much closed but we discovered this place on Yelp as a new business so we thought we would give it a try. I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen, my sister ordered the Seafood Ramen, and her boyfriend ordered the Beef and Rice plate. My sister also ordered a side of turnip cake.\n\nThe Tonkotsu ramen was a little overpriced (~$14) for the quality of the ramen. Broth had nothing too special about it and the ingredients were not as generous. My sister through the seafood ramen was bit better though because it did have the seafood taste in the broth. So I'd say for the ramen, it would be a 3.5/5 stars. \n\nThe beef and rice was the biggest mistake of this order. I tried a little bit of my sister's boyfriend's beef and rice plate and the beef was just not quality meat at all. Extremely difficult to chew and swallow and the cuts of beef were not thin enough to taste the quality and tenderness of the beef. Now, this can probably because of many reasons.. the type of cow they buy, the age of the meet, and how they cook it. By far the biggest disappointment. My sister's boyfriend just ate the vegetables and had to pass on the rice and the beef. He even had to spit a piece out on a napkin because it was so difficult to swallow. However, the waitress was very nice about this and decided to now charge us for the dish since we didn't eat it. \n\nOn a more positive note, the turnip cakes were SO DELICIOUS. Very nicely prepared and perfectly fried to have a perfect crisp where it wasn't overwhelming at all. I couldn't even take a picture of it when it first came out because once I ate one, I couldn't stop eating them. \n\nI would definitely come back for the turnip cakes but not for anything else we tried that day. I would highly recommend the restaurant to perfect on just ramen and dim sum (as it states as their restaurant name) rather than add other dishes like the beef and rice.", "author": "Amy L."}

I liked the unagi flavors, made pretty well. I had a taste of the Tonkotsu Ramen and I felt that it lacked pork bone flavor. It was very mild tasting. We got a small order of chicken wings. The wings were pretty good. Very saucy just the way I like it and meat wasn't dry. We also got some egg rolls and they were fried crispy and tasty. We also ordered a dim sum platter for $12 or $14. You get to choose 4 items from #2-8 and you get 2 of each. We had 2 XLBs, 1 shrimp dumpling, and 1 siu mai. Honestly, the dim sum was just average.

The soup was very bland, noodles were average, chashu was super mushy fatty.

I would suggest they bring down the prices for lunch just to attract more customers. They're at the border of Chinatown and North Beach where most patrons can get a full hearty meal for around $10, and need to be more price competitive.\nI may have not realized it back then, but I noticed that in pictures from other customers that the suggested tip amounts are stacked on top of tax.....that's just not right.

Right after ordering, my friend ran up to the server and asked to cancel her two shrimp dumpling orders because she wanted to order vegetarian steamed buns instead. They told her that they could not cancel the order because they had already started cooking it. We had literally just put in the order but she gave up on arguing. Soon after they brought out the shrimp dumpling orders first and we bit into them only to find that the shrimp was ice cold. They were still frozen. We sent them back. Next my spicy miso ramen came out, also rather fast, with half a soft boiled egg on top. I was super excited to start eating so I dunked the egg in the broth, picked up the egg with my chop sticks, and bit into it. ICE COLD. Somehow they had frozen a soft boiled egg earlier and then defrosted it? Disgusting. Never seen something like this before. Toward the end of the meal they brought out two more, this time cooked, orders of shrimp dumplings. You know, the orders we never wanted in the first place that they knew we didn't want and that they had messed up the first time. Sure this time they were cooked but the shrimp was slimey and my friend ate one dumpling and did not touch the rest. \n\nYes we were charged for all of it. Yes we all felt sick after. Yes they just wanted our money for awful, unsafe food. This place has some seriously questionable kitchen practices and their food does not taste good. Stay away.", "author": "Mitra Y."}

The food is great and although it takes a little time to get to your table it is delicious as cooked from scratch. To top it all Toppu Ramen serves all day and is open 7 days a week. A real find and I look forward to eating there often.", "author": "Madeleine T."}

We ordered a hamburger curry rice, Toppu roll, Dim Sum platter and the manager gave my girlfriend a special called \"Toppu Punic Ice Cream Sundae\" made her birthday fulfill a lot of fun and happiness!!!! Food were so delicious and all the staffs were supper friendly.  Definitely will come back.", "author": "Rachel H."}
