To set the scene I had spaced it thinking I was going to Giorgio's so I was kind of thrown at first since I had not eaten here but KNEW I LOVED Giorgio's. However my Cousin whom I was reconnecting with after 30 plus years chose this location and in the tidal wave of emotion was caught off guard and well lets face it they are both on a corner of Clement and something so I got confused. No biggie I am always up for an adventure. Now back to the waitress and why she deserves the 5 stars. From the moment we got there an electric pink smile was planted permanently upon her face but in the most sincerest manners. She spoke in a tone that told us that when she was at our table her attention belonged to us. During our visit she she checked on us just enough  so we did not feel abandoned. However gave us room to talk and share stories of our past. When she was taking our orders she gave suggestions for the menu and descriptions and steered us in understanding directions in that seemed to say, \"Ya you might like this better.\" I had brought my 21 year old son with me who was as picky about his pizza as my Cousin and the waitress was quick with the answer. \n Now the food. We got a large Neapolitan pizza with half pepperoni and half mushroom. We asked for extra mushroom. Good thing we did. I would be scared to think how many mushrooms would have been on there otherwise. The mushrooms tended to be lumped in areas as well. The edged of the crust was ok when it first came out but quickly became very hard and dry. Making it difficult to eat unless you had something to dip it in. We did not. The other two at the table seemed to be enjoying the pizza. I found it to be on the gummy side. \n  I had ordered a side salad that was fabulous! It was fresh and crisp. Their dressing were fantastic. The balsamic and ranch were delightful. It came with a dry little garlic roll which with ok when you ate it with the salad.\n  The dessert was extremely delish! We ordered the cheesecake, flan and  Tiramisu. Light, lovely and oh so sinful! I do not have a negative thing to say. Oh wait yes I do. Shame on them for not having espresso to go with such fab desserts! So we ordered coffee which was AWFUL because I pretty sure had been sitting in the pot since 1982. But the waitress made a fresh pot without and brought two cups and sweet smile that almost put the desserts to shame. \n Oh and I am a FREAK about a clean bathroom and I am almost ALMOST willing to give 5 stars JUST for the clean bathroom ESPECIALLY in SF. That is a FREAKING miracle. But being it is a pizza place. Oh and I forgot about the meatballs I ordered. Two meatballs. Super excited. They come out and are the size of golf balls. Kind of sad. They were ok. The sauce was amazing. The meatballs themselves. Meh. So one plus 12 minus 15 plus green equals three. I give them three stars for this visit.", "author": "Orleana P."}

While ordering, the girl repeats my order, tells me the amount, and the wait time (40-60min). We waited an hour and 20 minutes for the pizzas. After the long wait, we realize they gave us the wrong order. We ordered 1 pep 1 cheese. We got 2 cheese. The kids were starving and in a bad mood. I called them and the girl said that they charged us for 2 cheese and that they can deliver the pep after I pay the difference and it would be another 30min. I tell her she needs to make this right because we've been waiting and it's ridiculous that she still wants to charge me the difference. After 5 min of her trying to fix this, she finally talks to the manager and he was kind enough to send us the pep at no charge. \n\nToday I ordered 2 large pep and 1 medium pep. When I asked the amount, I could've sworn I heard her say it would be $59. This time I personally picked up the pizzas to avoid the long wait and make sure I get the right order. The place was empty. The cashier girl seemed like her mind was elsewhere. When I pay, it turns out that the amount is $69. Whatever, I'll pay it. I ask her for plates and she asks how many. I ask for 10 thinking she'll just grab a nice stack of plates. She literally counted each plate and gave me exactly 10. I wasn't offered any cheese or pepper. I honestly didn't bother asking her for any because she already looked annoyed when I asked for the plates. \n\nNever ordering from here again.

If most pizza seems bland and boring to you, then we are fellow travelers through the ocean of mediocre pizza in the bay area. Village Pizzeria is an island of excellent pizza in that bland ocean. The crust, sauce, and toppings are excellent. I've been going to Village at least once a week for at least a decade. As such, I am a known customer, so I will say that for the average customer service can be unreliable. If the staff is slow to notice you, don't be afraid to give them a holler to get their attention. The only other issue is that the place is a popular destination for children's birthday parties and sports teams. I always bring a pair of earplugs with me, since I like to read when I eat. About one visit in five I need to use those earplugs, because of the screaming kids.

A friend and I were there recently to get some dinner and were instead met with a dining experience which now compels this review.\n\nI ordered two slices of the \"Sicilian-style\" pizza, which is to say, they bore no resemblance to thick crust pizza, but instead came out as blocky squares of what could only be described as quickly-setting plaster of Paris. On this was draped a layer of sauce so thin that it had all but evaporated during its long sojourn in the oven. On top of this dryness was then stacked an inexplicably spartan layer of cheese (a few shreds, to be generous in description), and a disparate array of vegetables, which had no distinctive flavor of their own. After the first bite, I mused to myself that I have found even pre-packaged school pizzas -- with their artificial ingredients -- to be tastier and more thoughtfully prepared than this. Honestly.\n\nFor some strange reason, the owner of this place thought it wise to distinguish his Margherita pizza -- a recipe so divinely and purposefully simple -- with an oily and bland pesto sauce, thereby obliterating not only the point of the original preparation, but taking away from the fresh tomato taste that is unique to this recipe. As I bit into it, the tomatoes that were inartfully thrown on top slid off in various directions, urged forward by the pesto slime, which itself bore no resemblance to its tastier, saltier cousin.\n\nThe bottom of these blocks were burned, which made for a startling revelation, as my teeth were confronted with a hard and bitter ending, equally unforgiving on the gums. I tried softening the whole mess with a habanero hot sauce (requested expressly for this purpose), which was the only redeeming item of the night, and which was a local variety made by a company outside of the establishment. For all of its hardness, the crust could not claim even the slightest bit of airiness or save itself with a simple brush stroke of olive oil. No corn meal crust for all of that unyielding crunch. Just flour dough. Hard, dense, blocky, tasteless dough.\n\nOur waitress refilled my friend's soda order, but, seeing my empty glass of water, didn't come back to fill it up. I didn't bother asking, as the waitstaff's presence was a mixed bag of being present merely to clean up the occasional table or take an order, then disappearing together into the recesses of the kitchen. No one came in the middle to ask if our food had been prepared to our liking.\n\nThis place has no right to serve anything originating from Italy. I should have known what I was getting into when the smell of pizza didn't even waft out of the front door.

It's best sometimes to just shut the fuck up and let the customer tip from their side. You never ask the customer how much do you want back. I work in customer service as well and I will not tolerate this. I will report this to everyone I know not to order from here. The pizza was luke warm and  tasted like cardboard, but honestly I looked passed that, and was more pissed about that delivery driver. \nBe aware of this guy. Again he is (white, dark haired pony tail tied up hair, big nose, tall and skinny, hipster appearance). He's lucky I was patient. He does that to the next person or the wrong person, the outcome could be worse. Village pizza has to fire him, all he cares about is his tip. If they don't get rid of him, they will lose a lot of business.", "author": "Alex C."}

The quality has always been pretty erratic, but about half the time it was reasonably good.  Lately, however, things have gotten seriously worse.  It's hard to be sure whether it's the person who takes the telephone orders (always the same woman, who doesn't listen carefully) or, as seems more likely, that the kitchen just pays no attention to any instructions they are given or follows any consistent cooking standards.  The last time we ordered (after several previous complaints) we eventually got a call from the manager and the owner apologizing, but this time there were similar problems and no apologies.  The phone contact did finally agree to take 10 dollars off the price but by that time the pizza was almost cold and the toppings were still as skimpy as ever.  (Don't be fooled by the pictures shown on the website, by the way; they are nothing remotely like what is delivered to your door.)  I regret that I must now look for a new pizza place, but I have just been poorly served too many times and too often erroneously reassured that the service would soon improve for me to continue dealing with this declining and poorly managed business.", "author": "John R."}

The \"meat lover\" is a tasty pizza, though the cheese can be slippery while being consumed. Prices don't seem unreasonable, at least for SF.\n\nAvoid getting single slices; they arrive as a wide, flat pieces of over-salted dough with a tiny smattering of toppings in the middle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-13", "description": "I have reason to believe that the folks in the neighborhood order from Village Pizzeria only for delivery most of the time because I absolutely agree with the fair number of previous reviewers who have stated that this place seems to always be empty.  \n\nI walk by the corner spot often, and I usually see an empty restaurant.  It was pretty empty on the Friday night that I visited; only three other tables were occupied and this was at the peak of the dinner hour.  I walked in, took my own seat, grabbed a menu and studied it for a good ten minutes before I put in my order.  Sometimes, the great thing about an empty restaurant is fast service.  From the time I ordered my pizza a mere fifteen minutes had passed before I found a hot pizza sitting in front of me (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QAMEktS2QgJ-Yl2ooERmgw?select=yjUYhXkKCnQw7ldrG2NGGw).\n\nI ordered a personal size 9 inch Italian Supreme with the regular thin crust and a fountain drink.  The pizza was cut into six slices.  The Italian Supreme combines a thick layer of cheese, thinly sliced tomatoes, spinach leaves and seasoned cubes of chicken meat over a thick, tangy red sauce.\n\nThe thin crust is crisp and chewy almost crunchy on the edges.  I found fault with this crust however.  First of all it lacked flavor; it didn't even have the flavor of fresh baked bread.  While the bottom crust remained hard and crispy the dough in between the bottom crust and the layer of tomato sauce was actually very moist.  I think another reviewer described it as being soggy.  It's definitely better to eat the pizza while it's hot because the problem occurred after the pizza had sat out for awhile.  It could have been that it just soaked up the moisture from the sauce and the thick layer of toppings, but the first slice of the pizza definitely tasted better than the third, fourth, fifth or sixth slices.  Overall though I'd have to admit that the chicken was seasoned quite well and the toppings were all fresh.  The pizza was actually pretty good.\n\nYou can order canned sodas or fountain sodas for an extra ten cents.  Definitely go for the fountain option if you're dining in because it includes one refill.  An assortment of beer and wine is also available.  If you're eating in check out the big wall full of vintage photos of Sutro Baths and Playland at the Beach.  It's quite interesting.  Good service.

The crust was crispy and light, the sauce was mild (the way we like it), and the toppings were great.  A definite nice change from the usual pizza we've been having, especially from a native San Franciscan like myself.\n\nSince we liked it here we also decided to have our daughter's birthday party here on a Saturday afternoon and they happily reserved enough tables and seats for 36 people.  I additionally requested that extra tables be reserved by the window for all the pizza we ordered for the party (buffet style) plus a table for a 1/2 sheet cake.  For a hungry party that size I ended up ordering about 12 large thin crust pizzas (16\") along with about 5 orders of the garlic pesto & cheese bread.  We especially loved the Bacon pizza.  All I heard from our guests were compliments on how good the pizza was and that it was a great place to have a party.

This was a delivery because I'd spent most of the day having medical test run and I just didn't feel like making food once I got home.  I came home to very  hungry people.  It was also delivery.  On the initial delivery, they didn't bring one of the pizzas we ordered and paid for, I had to call to tell them and they would call me back when they figured out what went wrong.  About 15 mins later I got a call back saying the delivery guy left the pizza outside in front door.  Didn't knock, didn't call to say he was there, just put it down on the ground in front of the building and left.  I mean, is that a good business practice?  Anyone could have walked off with it--they walk off with UPS/FedEx/USPS packages left outside the front door, a pizza is a sure bet.  And you leave clean food on the floor, a public floor???  I should take the other 2 stars away just for that idiocy.   On top of that, they got the order wrong.  We ordered 1 meatball sandwich, 1 eggplant sandwich and 1 sausage sandwich but instead of a meatball sandwich, they sent over an eggplant sandwich, so we have 2 eggplants sammies.  Are these even similar?  Do kids generally like plain eggplant?  Not even breaded eggplant , just sliced eggplant with red sauce and cheese on it in a roll.   Ok, I love eggplant and will eat both eggplant  sandwiches because had to trade my sausage sammie just to make the whining and crying stop.  They really need to instate better quality control practices so when orders go out to the customers everything is as ordered and all items are included.  If it's a problem with the delivery person, talk to him to READ (I'm assuming he can read considering he's driving a car) the receipt to make sure he (1) takes everything on the receipt with him when he leaves the restaurant so nothing gets left behind or missed, and (2) READ THE RECEIPT AGAIN when he takes the stuff out of his car so he has everything on the receipt when he delivers to the door--and for God's sake, spend a minute waiting for the recipient to answer the door, DO NOT LEAVE FOOD OUTSIDE ON THE GROUND and assume it's going to be ok.  This isn't Mayberry USA.

On that day, I had a pizza al tonno. It was a lovely thin, cruncy pie with tuna, onions, and capers. Now I am not a fan of capers, so the latter has been edited from my reminiscing. The pizza was delightful and since my departure nearly 20 years ago from Europe (I lived in Switzerland for about 4 years), I have been on a quest in the  U.S. to find a pizza with tuna.\n\nTonight, I have finally noshed on one that was not made by me. This pizza was quite good but needs some fine tuning (not a pun) on my ordering.\n\nMy order: a 14\" with tuna and red onions with red sauce on Neapolitan crust.\n\nPros: \n- A good balance of onions and tuna. \n- The onions were nicely caramelized. \n- The tuna wasn't nasty vegetable oil/water canned Starkist or Chicken-of-the-Sea... It had the texture of Spanish or Italian tuna canned in olive oil.\n- Crust had a nice crunch and was thin.\n\nCons: \n- Red sauce was a bad match (and a little salty) with the toppings (my fault).\n- Albeit light and crunchy, the crust was a bit chewy. But, I have yet to find a place in the U.S. that makes a true European pizza crust, so I cannot fault Village too much on this. They would get 6 stars if they did.\n- Pizza here ain't cheap. A delivered two topping 14\" was $24 (no additional charge for delivery). However, a lot of GOOD pizza places in the Richmond can be pricey. And, since my hubby will likely not touch this pizza with a 10-foot pole, I do have about 3 meals from this puppy.\n\nSo, I will definitely work on fine-tuning my order and if I find the right match of sauce or additional toppings, Village Pizzeria will get 5 stars.", "author": "Melissa W."}

We were both feeling a bit flu-ish so there was a decided lack of frenetic energy.  In order to make it really easy on ourselves and the BF who was at home watching the kids, we thought that a pizza, for lunch would be a great idea.\n\nI ordered 1/2 margherita, 1/2 veggie.  It was a bit expensive.  About $26 or $28?  The crust was really thin and crispy and it did not take longer than 15 mins to make.  I know this because I had to FEED THE METER ON XMAS EVE.  WHAT THE EFF?  ARE YOU SERIOUS?\n\nWe brought the pizza home, it smelled really nice.  Claire set it up in the living room for the kids to eat while they committed further destruction on the BF's furniture and other nice things he likes.  When I came through from the kitchen, the first thing I hear is Ari, in her near-screaming voice shouting at her mother: \"I TOLD you I wanted pizza with ONLY cheese, I DON'T LIKE this, with all this STUFF on it.  YOU PICK IT OFF.\"  And then she proceeded to cross her arms, flail around, jump up and down on the couches and pout while looking completely entitled and yet dejected as though the pizza was chosen for the purpose of taunting her with it.  \n\nBy the time I ate it, the pizza had been manhandled by the kids who perpetually had their fingers in unspeakable places, even after they were washed with soap.  Somehow, the time between washing up for a meal and eating the food was too long for them to resist touching everything they had just washed off their hands.  I thought the pizza tasted a little bland.  Usually I buy cheese pizzas to get a base reading.  However, that week, I was in no state to make rational decisions nor was I able to make choices that reflect my actual tastes and preferences for food, drink, activities, or lifestyle.  \n\nIt was a bit expensive but it's pizza and I can see myself ordering a plain cheese one some time in the future.

The balognese sauce was weak flavored and the chicken in our fettuccine tasted processed.\n\nWould I give it another shot? Yes. However I'd go for back for the pizza... However, with North Beach pizza AND pizza orgasmica in the same neighborhood, its going to have to be some frickin' SERIOUS pizza to steal me away.

I had eaten a slice from Village Pizzeria before, and evidently forgot how much it sucked. I stepped outside my apartment, walked half a block & ordered a pepperoni calzone to go. \n\nThe counter person was extremely friendly, and mentioned that my order would be ready in 20 minutes. So I wandered my neighborhood for a few & then returned to pick up my grub. \n\nThe calzone was HUGE! I was excited about that. I wanted some extra marinara sauce for dipping, and she informed me it would cost $0.50! This was after I had already paid $12 and tipped her a dollar even though it was a to go order. I can't stand it when restaurants pull the 'we're gonna charge you extra for 2oz of sauce because we don't put enough on our food'. \n\nAnnoyed, I brought the calzone home & started to eat. It was extremely bland, with not nearly enough pepperoni for its size. I was very disappointed in my whole experience, especially the surcharge for their mediocre sauce that should have been free.\n\nOnly reason this place gets 2 stars is because of the friendly employee. At least they can hire halfway decent people.\n\nIf you're hungry, I have leftovers. They will be waiting for you in my trash can.", "author": "matt m."}

Thankfully! \n\nI keep hearing how this or that joint serves \"great NY pizza\". I go, I taste...I'm left wanting. The sauce, people!!! The biggest mistake made by pizza makers is in the sauce. If it's too garlicky (often the case), it dies. Most pizza sauces are too spicy in general. The sauce should be slightly tangy-sweet. The other is cheese. Only the right blend of cheeses works, and too often we get one left out, or something else substituted. Ugh! And even if it's not thin crust, the sauce and cheese has to be correct, or else it just don't work. Thin crust is preferred, though. And a little oil should drip off!\n\nBesides all of that, the place has been recently remodeled, and there's good sandwiches, too. They have a nice selection of beverages, including Dr. Brown's Black Cherry, which I occasionally will slurp down, because it's all natural.\n\nI wish they had a veal parmigiana sandwich on the menu, because then I'd eat there even more often.

Our favorite thing to do is order something like sausage and peppers with anchovies thrown in and then not finish it all, bring the pizza home, let it get cold, then heat it up slice by slice in a nonstick skillet on medium to low heat till the crust gets crispy and the cheese starts oozing. If you're gonna have pizza left overs and then heat it up, Village's pizza is the best because no where else are you gonna find a pizza that's just as good, if not better, the second time around.", "author": "cora j."}

But the public transportation and the pizza, those things I pine for. In any city kissing the Atlantic, this is not a 4-star joint, but out here, Village Pizzeria will at least take the edge of the jones for the real stuff. The crust is a little cardboardy, but still better than much of the competition. The online ordering works like a charm; we always get a follow up call within a very few minutes. And strangely, for someone who's something of a traditionalist when it comes to pizza toppings, I think the Bit of Bacon (with, of all things, ranch dressing, tomatoes, and piles of garlic) is totally yummy. It doesn't make up for the lack of an excellent subway system, but I enjoy it nonetheless.", "author": "Martha S."}

However, the service is what is turning me off.  On busy nights, I expect the service to be slow.  I know it's not an excuse but I can understand it.  When it's empty, I just don't get it.  There have been times when I'm literally the only customer in the place and there's not a waiter to be seen.  It leads to an excruciatingly painful experience, especially if you're parked at the meters and having to watch your car like a hawk to ensure you're not ticketed.  I like most of the food, especially the pizza.  It can be hit or miss and tastes much better by the slice (pie crust is much thicker for some reason, even extra large) but some of the other items are pretty good too (salads, sicilian, heroes).  However, I might give the Pac Heights location a try to see if the food is just as good because the service can't be any worse.", "author": "AZ A."}

The owner treated me like family for the most part as this is a Brazilian owned family pizzeria. I enjoyed my co-workers (though there was a high turn over rate) but didn't enjoy always being called in whenever someone proved to be sick or just plain unreliable. One of the best pizza makers I know, Carlos, was not only my co-worker but a good friend and an loyal and hard worker. Sometimes it gets really slow there but beer nights and weekend we made pretty good tips and the place is usually packed when hockey moms book for award ceremonies after a game. The pizza I felt was tasty, I like their sauce and the salads. Ingredients I can say were always fresh and often times I was the one cutting and preparing the toppings so you can BET it was. I stopped working there at the end of 03', you know how it goes..you get married and you have to move. I did get kind of sick of eating pizza while working for a pizza place but after not having it in a few years, I do still kind of crave it.

I love that they are on the corner of my block, so i don't even have to cross the street.   I've been eating here for over two years now and just decided to write a review. I think that its taken me so long to have an opinion on this place because I have a deep deep love for New York City pizza. Being from New York my standards are high when it comes to places \"claiming\" to have New York style pizza.   \nWell since i've been eating here for over two years, its safe to assume that i like the place a lot.  I can't really say that it tastes like a NYC slice, but its very close.  Over the years the crust has gotten a lot better, and the sauce and cheese ratio are just about right. On certain days they tend to get cheap on the cheese.  I do love the fact that they offer the different shakers oregano, garlic powder, cheese and crushed red pepper! No New York Style pizzeria would ever go without shakers...especially the garlic powder.   \nOne word of advice, take out/ delivery is not the best option.

It was a little slice of heaven!  Crisp crust, lotsa cheese, fresh musrooms.  Delicious. All for six fiddy.  I have also tried the lasagna many a time.  It is pretty darn good.  It's a large portion, and I always have left overs.  The garlic rolls are really good; they are made like cinnamon rolls (rolled up), and according to the menu, made fresh daily.
