The tofu soups (combination and fried ramen) were all very yummy.  The warm soup suits the San Francisco chilly weather.  We also ordered short ribs and they were very yummy.  Not too fatty or over cooked.  This place does the cooking in the kitchen, it's not the bbq at your table type of restaurant. \n\nThe rice came in stone pots at every table.  The servers would scoop the rice for you. Afterwards, our server pour rice tea into the rice stone pot to make rice porridge like they would in Korea.  Very home feel.  \n\nPrices were okay.  I didn't find it over priced.  \n\nCleanliness was good for an older restaurant.  \n\nService was very good.

I've even gotten my boyfriend addicted to this place.\n\nVenue / Service: it's not exactly the nicest place I've been to for Korean restaurants, but it's not a dump either.  It gets a little dark, especially if you sit toward the back away from the windows since the lights are a bit dim, but at least tables and seats are clean.  Service-wise, they are on the quicker side, depending on how busy they are.  Probably the most we've waited was 20 min, but they at least brought out the banchan so we could nibble while waiting and came by to update us on our food.\n\nFoodwise, I've had the non-spicy versions of the Dumpling Sundubu and the Combination Sundubu (both $14.98), since I can't handle spicy, though my boyfriend usually gets the mild version of the Combination.  They also bring you a fried croaker (fish) and a large stonepot of rice from which they serve you rice and then use the leftovers to make nurungji (crispy rice scrapped from sides of the stone pot with barley tea).  Raw eggs are provided that you crack on your own into the soup- I like to break my egg immediately so the soup becomes richer and thicker though some people like to eat the whole cooked egg.  \n\nWhile I can't comment on spice levels (my low-tolerance boyfriend liked his mild versions) I will say that the non-spicy is still quite flavorful with the rich, soybean taste.  I also like how they give you a LOT of stuff in the soup other than the tofu- there's enough tofu but also a decent amount of meat / seafood / veggies / dumplings.  I think I prefer the Combination Sundubu since it had a better flavor profile, mixing seafood with some beef.  \n\nI've tried a few places in the area and so far, this has been one of my favorites.  Even my other Korean friends love this place.  So if you are craving for some good sundubu in SF, this is a spot to try.", "author": "Audrey H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-01", "description": "There is a time and place for everything.  We came to My Tofu House for some hot spicy stew on a cold, rainy day. They offered a limited selection of Korean comfort dishes that we have all come to love  - Tofu Stews, Bibimbab, Korean BBQs and savory Pancakes. The menu is small and these traditional favorites made up the entire menu. We ordered the Seafood Tofu Stew, Bibimbab and Fried Noodles Soft Tofu to share. Some entrees were missing the wow factor. One was particularly hearty and outstanding with a good kick. Prices of some were steep for what you get. I was taken aback by the sky-high price tags on the Pancakes and BBQs. Lightheartedly, we needed to save face and not behave like el cheapos by leaving! So we did the right thing but skipped the pancakes and BBQs!\n \nHowever, where Tofu House surpassed others was in their banchan. Every dish of banchan from the proverbial kimchee to the fish cakes, daikon, cucumbers and bean sprouts were garlicky, deliciously marinated and seasoned with authentic Korean spices. The standout was not kimchee but the small fried yellow croaker fish. They were nicely salted with delicate mild flavors.\n\nThe Seafood Soft Tofu ($14.98) was served in a steaming cauldron of soft tofu stew. The stew was teeming with clams but they skimped on other ingredients. There were a few small shrimps with heads and shells and one piece (yes, one piece) of oyster. Nonetheless, I have to admit the stew tasted phenomenal albeit a little briny, which was expected being a seafood stew. The little clams stole the show! Then, there was this 'crack yourself' raw egg and the servers were funny by displaying their nonchalance towards customers not in the know what to do! The egg added more aesthetics to the cauldron now looking like fiery volcanic lava! This was the best dish for the evening and one of the best renditions in the city. (5/5)\n\nThen came the disappointment mainly on the value department. The Fried Noodle Soft Tofu ($14.98) was priced the same as the Seafood Stew but all you get were tofu, carrots and onions plus a few mouthfuls of ramen. Although the broth tasted the same as the Seafood Stew, it felt like a rip considering the meager ingredients! If you are into ramen, Marufuku Ramen in Japantown gives you a better bang for your buck and a more substantial bowl of ramen. (2/5)\n\nI love my rice bowl be it Chinese or Japanese! Bibimbab is the classic Korean rice bowl with just as much flavor, texture and color. We ordered the no meat version -the Mushroom and Vegetable Babimbab ($17.98). Rice was served in a stoneware, topped with saut\u00e9ed veggies and 'gochujang' sauce on the side, which was a savory, sweet and spicy condiment for flavor enhancement. Again, there was this raw egg smack dab in the center but this time the yolk brought out the sunshine look! It was a pretty presentation, good tasting but certainly not mind blowing.  For a vegetarian bowl, I felt the price was up in the clouds as well! (3/5)\n\nService was efficient as they were staffed with energetic young boys! There wasn't time for friendly banters as the place was jammed a half-hour after they opened! The d\u00e9cor was elegantly appointed Japanese style with an emphasis on wood. It is not trendy but is a quite charming old school design.", "author": "Geoff G."}

Read below for context.\n\nI typically don't leave reviews for restaurants unless they are SPECTACULAR or ABSOLUTELY ABHORRENT. Unfortunately, this review falls under the latter... I visited this place last week, and received terrible service period. It wasn't even a packed house but yet, I did not get any attention from the service staff. I had an empty water glass as early as 10 minute into being seated. It stayed empty until I left 45 minutes later.

With that price you can go to an All you can eat BBQ place and have unlimited Galbi along with 20 other different kinds of meats. Despite the price, i still ordered it partially out of curiosity to see whether it is superior than other places. I also tried the mushroom tofu soup.\n\nMy conclusion is that both dishes were tasty and authentic, but nothing special or memorable. It was the kind of comfort food that I wanted for the moment but I've definitely had better (better variety and value) Korean food elsewhere.

I know that it's very difficult to prepare the Korean food before it's ever cooked up and served so there's a lot of work that goes on before the front doors open. The place is always busy. So you want to plan between meals to drop in and parking in the area is a little challenging. Because it's on Geary Avenue it's very busy in the neighborhood so arrive early to find parking in the area.\n\nIf you arrive between meal Russia's like I always plan to arrive, and are lucky enough to find parking nearby, you walk in and tables become available pretty quickly. By the time you finish your meal though if you're headed toward a busy stretch the lines will be deep. But people are usually satisfied watching the game on the big TV on the wall at the entryway. The TV isn't really there for the entire restaurant to view its more to give people that are waiting for a table with something to do while they wait.\n\nThe staff is in constant motion because of the amount of people that walked through their doors. So though you may not get that warm friendly feeling when you walk in you know that they're there to take care of you and make sure you get seated and fed right away. So I understand how they have to take care of everyone quickly.\n\nWhen the food arrives it starts with hot tea that has the toasted rice in it that gives it that special flavor. And on a cold night the food is especially rewarding. The presentation is an array of color and dishes the little appetizer dishes make sure of that. The entree arrives steaming and bubbling at your table you're very surprised that it almost looks volcanic if you order the soup. All the dishes there including the meat dishes the presentation is stunning. The flavors are just as I would expect, true flavors.\n\nThe food is always plentiful and I understand why it's a little expensive because of the time that it takes to make these specialized dishes. You can order soup meet fish vegetarian or combinations. They are famous for their tofu soups kimchi soups and meat platters.\n\nFirst busy as it is the staff is still able to be fairly friendly even when crunched. Just remember when you go to this little place that you allow time for parking come between the meals so it's not too busy and have an idea of what Korean food you like so you can order without waiting too long.\n\nTHE BUZZ: \n\nParking - It can be tricky, busy neighborhood\nGreeted/Seated - Very busy took a minute\nAtmosphere/D\u00e9cor - Simple pine Asian look\nService - Fast and friendly though hurried\nCleanliness - Constantly clearing tables for the rush\nMenu Selection - Only a couple pictures to show the many Korean delights\nVegan - Several veggie dishes offered\nPresentation/Portion - Love the way it looks on the table great eye appeal\nOutdoor/Patio - None\nTake out - Yes\nUnique Feature - Zagat rated and high marks from many reviewers posted\nKid Friendly - Yes\nPet Friendly - No\nMusic/Live Music - Not that I could hear\nTV - On in table waiting area\nDress -  Casual\nValue - A bit expensive but worth it\nCash/Credit - Yes\nHandicapped Friendly - Yes", "author": "Thomas B."}

The menu is rather limited, in my opinion, but there are the classics that you would expect to be paired with a bowl of hot, sizzling tofu soup.  Do not come here expecting to cook some raw beef on a shared grill.  The routine is rather ritualistic for me (and it seems to be with other tables I usually see around me).  I shall explain further below.\n\nI typically order a bowl of tofu soup and a plate of beef short ribs (kalbi) to be shared with me and another person.  That's it!  And that's all you need because the restaurant will provide you with banchan, which is a variety of small dishes such as kimchi, fish cakes, bean sprouts, and much more.  Moreover, the server will also bring you rice prepared in a stone pot that fills three individual bowls.  The server will empty the pot before you and pour fresh tea into it, which will turn into porridge later!  \n\nThe food all comes out fresh:  the soup is still boiling, and the kalbi is still sizzling on its iron skillet.  I love how they give you a raw egg to crack into your soup.  Do not make the mistake I've once made by asking for an extra egg to add to the soup; two raw eggs in your tofu soup will make your soup tastes like nothing but eggs.  The soup is piping hot, so don't sip on it right away.  I tend to scoop spoonfuls of soup onto my rice as I wait for it to cool down.  The beef is always tender and never overcooked.  \n\nThere can be substantial waits during lunch and dinner times.  But when you order--the food comes extremely fast!

My boyfriend and I came here for a Friday night dinner around 8 PM and were seated in ~15 minutes.\n\nWe both ordered the dumpling soft tofu stew (mild and a non-spicy). We considered ordering a pancake too, just in case we wouldn't be full, but it is $$... all their pancakes cost $23, even the seafood vs vegetable pancake. Luckily our food came with a plethora of side dishes, including a plate of kimchi and two pan fried fish. A large stone bowl of rice is also included. \n\nAs for the dumpling soft tofu stew, it was good but not great. It lacks a heartiness and flavor (in comparison to my favorite soft tofu stew in Berkeley.) There was a good balance of dumplings, rice cake, beef and tofu - though I think there should definitely be more rice cakes (there were only 3!) and beef. Also, as other Yelpers mentioned, the spice levels here are lower - my mild was not even spicy to me, and I have low tolerance for spice. The side dishes also were low on the spice level. \n\nLast thing to note is the rice in the stone bowl. When the server brings it to the table, he/she will scoop out bowls of rice, then fill the stone bowl with the rest of the rice with tea.

It was probably the most expensive item on the menu at $27, but YOLO I guess! The meat was very delicious with a pretty generous portion on short ribs on a bed of cooked onions. I really enjoyed the dish, but sadly when you order this... it's all you get aside from the appetizers and a bowl of rice. It's a meat lovers go-to for sure though.\n\nWe were celebrating my moms birthday and she had the pork bibimbab. My wife went with the beef variation. The dishes were pretty similar and came packed with rice, veggies, and other fixin's. These dishes also had a little bit of heat to them... but not too much. If you like it hot, these wouldn't do it for you, but they were perfect for my mom and wife.\n\nI think to really give this restaurant a fair shake, the next time I come I'll have to go for one of the tofu soups. I mean... why go to tofu house if not to get some tofu?\n\nOverall Tofu House is a solid Korean restaurant that sits a little on the more expensive side of things. The food is very good and the atmosphere is clean and welcoming. This is definitely a worthy choice if you're hankering for some Korean food in the city.", "author": "Luke C."}

I always opt for the dumpling tofu stew in medium spicy. It's not spicy at all but has a great kick to it. Anything less than medium spicy is a little too bland for my taste. The Kalbi here is really tender and the serving size is very generous. You can also get your free refills on the small dishes they provide for you. You usually get cucumbers, fish cakes, bean sprouts, kimchi and their Crocker fish dish. Sadly, tonight, the lady did not give us our Crocker fishes. My boyfriend was pretty upset because that's his favorite side dish. The lady also seemed pretty rude and gave my boyfriend a stank eye. The male server, on the other hand, is very jovial and attentive. If it wasn't for the shady service from the lady, this place would definitely be a solid 4 stars.", "author": "Ada H."}

Kimchi was fresh and delicious too.\n\nThey do soft tofu right! All the soft tofu stews come at the same price so it opens up a world of possibilities for you. I personally love dumplings so I chose the dumpling soft tofu stew which came with dumplings, rice cakes, and beef. All the tofu stews come with a raw egg for you to crack it in yourself. You also get rice and if you are in a large party, they will give you a big stone pot of rice to share instead. You can customize the level of spiciness for your soft tofu. Medium gives it the best spicy kick and is my recommended choice. Mild is actually quite bland and my friend had to flavor hers with some kimchi sauce to give it some spiciness. \n\nThe seafood pancake is huge and definitely meant to be shared amongst your group. Their pancake was almost like a deep dish pizza with how thick it was. Since it wasn't a thin pizza, it wasn't crispy all the way through and had a doughy center with the seafood ingredients. I didn't particularly like it since I like my pancakes thin. \n\nPrice-wise, it's more expensive than average and it can probably end up being $15-20 per person. Although their menu offers bulgogi and bibimbap as well, I would only come here solely just for soft tofu. After all, that's what they are named and known for. They do not take reservations and you can put your name down on the waitlist when you arrive. The place does get packed but the wait isn't too terrible.

I didn't taste any spice when I had the mild for the tofu soup, but medium always has just the right amount of kick for me. The kimchi tofu soup comes with lots of soft tofu, meat of choice (beef or pork- I always choose beef), kimchi and mushrooms. The kalbi is tender and cooked slightly burnt just the way I like it which I can't seem to get at any other korean restaurant in the vicinity. Just make sure you eat the kalbi while it's still hot/warm. I find it isn't as tasty once it cools down. Can't forget all the awesome sides too which also comes with one (sometimes two) delicious croaker fish per person. One of my favorite parts of the meal is drinking the toasted rice tea from the rice clay pot (the waiter scoops the rice out for you then fills the rice pot with slightly leftover rice that's stuck to the pot with tea). The toasted rice tea makes me feel warm and brings me back to my childhood memories. \n\nAll the times I came here they seem to be busy during lunch hour and every night, even during weekdays, but wait times go fairly quickly esp for a small party.

Located just 10 minutes away from the Presidio park, this place has close proximity to Pacifica hiking areas, Sausalito and Point Reyes National Park. So if you are looking for a Korean dinner after a long day of hiking, I recommend My Tofu House. \n\nLocated on the main street of 11th avenue, it is easy to spot, but parking can be challenging, Fortunately, if you go on the weekend, parking is free after 6 pm. Waiting time can be anywhere from 10-15 minutes. The interior design gave us a sense that we were eating in our own home. There is a roof over the top and ledges that separates one table from another to give a sense of privacy. Our table felt homey and cozy. \n\nThe service is swift with refilling your barley tea. If you want water, you have to ask because the barley tea is their default for water. We ordered Korean pancake, soondooboo, and bibimbap. For a college student on budget, this place has a more up-scale price and a little over my budget. But other than that, the portion is filling and the food is a solid five star. The unique thing the server he will add some barley tea to the left over rice in the stone pot. My Korean friend said this is like an after meal dish that is very common in Korea. The taste is bland, but you are supposed to eat it with banchan, korean side dishes. Cool! I learn something new everyday.\n\nOverall, a good pick after a long day of hiking and fulfilling and satisfied meal!", "author": "Kim H."}

There are always tons of Korean families here eating so you know this place is legit!\n\nI've be the first to admit that some of the dishes on the menu come with crazy price tags. Korean pancakes are $23 each, bibimbabs are $17 each, and meat is like $24-$27 each for dinner (lunch is cheaper for meat). I have gotten the pancakes before, which are a splurge, but they the fluffiest and thickest pancakes I've had, full of toppings, so I think you should go for it if you're feeling a pancake! I've also had the meat which is really good, but probably overpriced.\n\nAnd everything you order comes with a large number of delicious side dishes and grilled fish. They also will refill your side dishes as long as you ask nicely!\n\nBut honestly, what you really come here for is the soft tofu soup, which are around $13.99 each. \n\nI love the combination soft tofu soup and the seafood soft tofu soup, and you can choose the level of spiciness.

It starts off with the Banchan, an assortment of small plates of cool refreshing vegetables, which they do well in serving.  Big fan of the assortment and taste of each one.  For the main, I had the vegetable and beef bibimbap, which was all served in a great big sizzling hot stone.  After stirring up the ingredients -- all while everything is still very warm and sizzling inside -- it is so good.  There's a decent amount of spice which I like as well, and some of the rice gets crispy as it sits in the stone; great taste and texture overall.  The portion was pretty sizable as well. I'm convinced bibimbap can only be good in the hot stone.  Also had some of the Dak (chicken) as well, and it was very tasty as well.  \n\nThe waitresses were nice and accommodating, although there were only two of them to handle the lunch crowd.  And while the inside isn't super large, it's definitely comfortable to sit inside.  Price for lunch may have been a little high ($40 for two people), but it was well worth.", "author": "Jarrod Y."}

It comes bubbling hot in an earthenware pot. You can choose your level of spice, which is not as spicy compared to a lot of Korean restaurants. I usually choose mild, because even 'mild' at most Korean restaurants is pretty spicy to me, but here 'medium' is much more suitable for me.\n\nAll the tofu soups are around $12. Not a bad price, but not so cheap anymore. But hey, there's always banchan. Here they serve bean sprouts, seasoned cucumber, kimchi, fried tofu skin, spicy winter melon, fried fish, and raw eggs to crack into your soup. Is it just me or did there use to be more variety with their side dishes?\nThey're all pretty good. The silky tofu falls apart and absorbs the flavors of the soup. \n\nI've tried the...\nOriginal - w/ mushrooms, beef or pork or chicken:\nI'd say choose beef if you're picking a protein, because it gives the soup the most flavor. \n\nSeafood - w/ oyster, shrimp & clam:\nThe seafood is not great. The shrimp are tiny and difficult to eat, and the rest of the shellfish get lost in the soup.\n\nKimchi - w/ kimchi, mushrooms, beef or pork:\nThe kimchi loses its distinguishing kimchi traits as the seasoning washes off the cabbage leaves and seep directly into the soup.\n\nDumpling - w/ dumpling, rice cake, beef\nMy favorite of the bunch, because it's very filling. The dumplings are not bad, pretty meaty and the skin is very soft. Sometimes I dip a spoonful of rice into the soup to give it flavor, but I usually can't finish the rice after I eat all the dumplings.\n\nIf you are interested in trying one of the BBQ dishes, come for lunch, because the dinner price is nearly double the cost, and I don't really think it's worth it.\n\nService is very good. I respect all the servers carrying around piping hot dishes and carrying out all those tiny banchan plates.\n\nSometimes there is a wait for the dinner crowd. I'm a little surprised. It's quite good, but not quite good enough to warrant a line. There is a good amount of seats with a lot of booth-style tables and some sectioned-off cubical-style tables. In the back, there is a separate small dining room with more tables. If you're in the neighborhood, it's a good option to get some food to warm you up.", "author": "Joy W."}

This place had decent reviews, was popular, and seemed pretty legit, but it was a let down :(\n\nThere is a small parking lot by the side of the restaurant, which is useful. I came on a Sunday evening and put my name down on a list inside. \n\nFirst, I was surprised at the prices: \n$14 for soup (this one's fine), $18 for bibimbap, $27 for galbi or bulgogi. And this isn't in fidi. it's in Richmond \n\nMost of us ordered the soup (in varying spicy levels). They brought us tea, and after asking two or three times, they also brought us cold water. The side dishes are mostly very basic: radish kimchi, kimchi, fish cakes, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and (this was nice) fried fish. They served us rice from a large stone pot for the table. Refills for the side dishes had to be requested two or three times each to actually get someone to do it. So, service? not too great, but not rude.\n\nThe tofu soup, which I assume would be their specialty, came in rather small stone bowls and they brought us eggs to crack in to them. A strange ingredient that I found in all of our soups was mushroom. Other than that the ingredients in the tofu soup seemed pretty good and had a good ratio to the soup. But what's tofu soup with out the good rich flavor of the soup??\nTheir soup had nothing. It was red and looked like it should have a lot of flavor, but it wasn't spicy, it didn't taste like any broth, and was very, very bland. \n\nDo I most likely have high standards having grown up in Korea and then near LA Koreatown? maybe.

The restaurant was bustling with families, couples, friends, etc. The guys who ran the place were very efficient and our food arrived on time. \n\nSkip the tofu salad. It's a salad with iceberg lettuce with 4 pieces of uncooked tofu and a tiny amount of corn and carrot on top. The salad was drenched in watery soy sauce dressing. On the other hand, the tofu soup was very spicy and flavorful. I was surprised at how big the shrimps were. Be careful not to burn your tongue...the dish came out steaming and bubbling. Just when we thought we weren't going to get any rice, our waiter came by with a huge bowl of rice and scooped the rice into small bowls for us.\n\nThe banchan was great. Everything tasted authentic and paired well with our food. I tend to judge a Korean restaurant by their kimchi. Their kimchi was extra saucy and tasted great. Our tofu soup came with a fried croaker and an egg.\n\nWhat I don't understand is that they charge $23 for pancakes. At that rate, I'd rather get their BBQ meats.", "author": "Helen C."}

She said it usually takes at least 30-45 mins during weekends so I guess we came at a good time.\n\nBanchan: B.\nFewer selections than a lot of other tofu soup houses I have been to. I guess here serves the fish dish so it's a plus (yes that's pretty good). But other than that, kimchi was so-so; fish egg/bean sprouts etc were all average or below average.\n\nKalbi: B+.\nNot bad, but far from exceptional. Standard marinated short rib. \n\nSeafood Pancake: B.\nBoth my friend and I thought it was too thick - felt like eating a pizza and felt so stuffed afterwards. I think the amount of seafood they put in was decent, but because of the thick pancake I couldn't really enjoy the whole dish too much.\n\nFish Egg Tofu Soup (Medium): B.\nI think medium is the 2nd highest spiciness level but even though for a person who can't eat too spicy food like me, it was not spicy enough. I guess I should have gone all the way up. Not sure whether this restaurant uses MSG but my guess is no or only very little, because the soup only had very little taste... Fish egg portion was small, I think I could only find three chunks.

We ventured out to the Inner Richmond around 8:30 on a Saturday night. The place was completely packed, which is always a good sign, isn't it? We waited for maybe 15 minutes and once we were seated, the servers were quick with water, tea, and sides. Boom- hunger subsided. We decided to over-order because, duh, why not? Korean food is just one of those foods that are sometimes better the next day, isn't it?! I ordered the Original Soft Tofu soup (tofu with beef and mushrooms) and my hubby got the Combination Soft Tofu soup (tofu with beef, shrimp and clams). Just a heads up--the prices of the current day menu are not the same as the ones you'll see here on Yelp ($9.45 on Yelp whereas the real price is $13.38--a really weird number, no?). We shared the Haemul Pajeon (seafood pancake), a small order for fried yellow croaker fish, and an order of kalbi (broiled short ribs)--when I say we over-ordered, we REALLY over-ordered. But it was all so worth it and so delicious! The soup had awesome flavor and came out piping hot. Crack your egg and stir it well and you have yourself the perfect rainy day meal, which cured our rainy day blues last night. I highly suggest ordered the yellow croaker to eat along with the soup. The spice of the soup is balanced really well with the fish's saltiness. We really enjoyed the seafood pancake and kalbi, but barely touched either one because we were so stuffed from all of the food already. And they were even better the next day for lunch, I swear! Particularly the seafood pancake. It's a mix of different seafood (clams, shrimp, squid, etc.) which wasn't fresh, I assume, but tasty nonetheless.

Very easy to bite off the bone. The bulgogi on the other hand was also a bit too sweet for my liking. \n\nNow comes the soft tofu soup. I ordered my usual favorite, the dumpling soft tofu soup. We also ordered a seafood tofu soup for my boyfriends grandma. I asked for medium spice for mine since the mild I had last time was more on the bland side & a mild spice for his granny. The waitress came out with our orders switched resulting in his granny having the medium spice tofu soup where she can't handle.

It has that nice wooden look in it which almost felt like home to me. Me and my friend got there around six pm perfect for dinner time and it was almost already packed in there. We got seated right away and the service was very quick. Gave us our teas and let us look at the menu for a good while before asking if we'd like to order. Their menu is quite small so it's not hard picking what you want to eat. We ordered two items since it comes with side dishes and rice so if we were still hungry after, I could easily order more. We got #5 assorted mushroom tofu soup in mild level and #13 beef and vegetable bibimbap that my friend recommended. The side dishes came first and since we were super hungry, we just started picking at that first. I never had side dishes before so everything was a first timer for me. The fried fish was really good, reminds me of my mom's cooking. The other one I really liked was the fish cake because it was spicy and flavorful. Right after that, our rice came, like a lot of rice that I'm pretty sure we aren't going to finish. The lady poured hot tea into the rice stone pot so all the white rice would come off but I accidentally threw my napkin in there, not sure how but it happened, so we didn't touch that anymore(it's okay we barely finished everything). The beef stone pot came and it was so pretty and colorful, just like how it is in kdramas(anyone watches that here cuz I do!) We started mixing right away because we wanted the egg to cook and it smelled so good that I wanted to eat it right away(careful: burning hot). You really get what you pay for because the stone pot is slightly more expensive than other places(according to my friend) but it was a huge stone pot. The tofu soup came and it looked super good. I never had tofu soup before as well so I was really excited to try it. I quickly took a spoonful in my mouth and it was scorching hot, felt like my insides died a little. I was expecting the soup to be bigger than the bibimbap for some reason but it looked tiny(guess what, it really isn't with all the other food). We barely even finished everything, our bellies were popping when we left. Total came out to be $40.00 with tip, delicious food and amazing service with good proportion sizes. Will definitely come back soon!", "author": "Lisa W."}

I usually get takeout but have dined here once or twice. This review in particular was for my last takeout order a week or so ago. \n\nMy GF loves the fish egg soft tofu soup here and not many places in San Francisco make it better than they do. As mentioned in previous reviews, their highest spicy level wasn't spicy enough for her but for me it was just right. For me, it was that good kick of spicy without having to stop to take a break to eat more. While she chowed down on the fish egg soup, I ordered an order of Kalbi (beef short ribs). It tasted like standard Korean fare which is not a bad thing in my book. It was definitely tender and juicy!\n\nThe employees here aren't the fastest but they are very friendly whether I'm taking out or eating here. This place gets extremely packed from Friday to Sunday so keep that in mind if you're planning on eating here. I think the food is slightly overpriced but I don't mind paying for it as long as the quality is there!", "author": "R C."}

We were promptly seated and ordered the seafood tofu stew and the bulgogi. Be warned that the menu is small, but it still has your typical Korean dishes.  A standout in the meal was the banchan or side dishes. I liked how they gave us a large plate of kimchee, which was quickly devoured. The spicy fish cakes were very good, and they also gave us two whole fried fish which I've never seen before as a side dish. The seafood tofu stew was standard yet tasty. Maybe I've developed more of a tolerance to spicy dishes, but I thought that the mild was too mild. I had to dump some of the kimchee into the stew to get more flavor. I only tried a bit of the bulgogi, but it was also quite delicious.\n\nThere was nothing to complain about with the service. However, the prices are on the slightly higher end. I didn't like how they posted both the lunch and dinner prices on the same menu. For the bulgogi, it was almost a $10 increase for basically the same portion. Why would they want diners to know that?

You can't get great Korean BBQ in SF, but if you want some good comfort food in the form of tofu soup or bibimbab, you'll find it here. You can't go wrong with any of their tofus or bibimbab. Nothing is heavily seasoned with salt, so you don't have to worry about the Korean food salt bloat aftermath. If you're a huge meat fan, I don't really recommend the kalbi or bulgolgi. They're called My Tofu House for a reason. Stick with their specialties, and you also get to alter the spice level. That's pretty awesome. If you're feeling the pancake, you can't go wrong with a massive, fluffy combo pancake, chocked full of seafood and kimchi.\n\nPrices are what they are, so don't expect SoCal-cheap bills.

The ban chans were whatever, the service was okay. They didn't give us our free fish until I had to ask twice - which slightly irked me.

The banchan that comes with the order is really tasty too, my favorite is the sliced fish cake, but the kimchee, radishes, pickles, and sprouts are good too. The banchan comes with a delicious fried fish -- the bones are soft and edible, and are an excellent source of calcium too.\n\nThe tofu is delivered to your table at a raging boil -- be sure to crack the raw egg into it while it's still boiling so that it can cook. \n\nWhen I go to My Tofu House, I almost always get the tofu, since that's obviously their speciality.

We've been coming here for years and they still serve consistently delicious Korean food with mediocre service. They often forget our drinks and have to be reminded at least twice or we have to ask for soup bowls even after we said we were sharing. There's usually a long line at night. Same story this past Friday with the line and service but we didn't mind because we knew it would be worth it. Also, they don't serve or allow alcohol so you don't get the true Korean experience until you hear loud voices slamming down cups of soju but at any rate, they have the best Kimchee Soup and their Pancake is very good. All of the BBQ meats are cooked well, hot and tasty and their Bi Bim Bap are very good. The veggies are fresh and there's enough of everything in the clay pot. For all their dishes, the requested spicy hot level is always perfect. I'm glad they still include the dish of whole fish in their Bon Chon but they never ask if you want anymore of the little dishes. They'll bring more if you ask though so that's fine enough.", "author": "Jen L."}

My favorite Mexican joint led me down an agonizing path that emulated the arc of a long term relationship slowly falling to pieces.  A long-time Thai favorite exhibited a more slippery slope, moving from stratosphere to ho-hum in the course of two visits separated by a long swath of time.  \n\nI have no relationship with My Tofu House but I do have a relationship with a more favored (by me) Korean place where the food is cheaper and, by my estimate, better.  I hesitate to brand that place as a favorite for fear that the minute I do so it'll begin to leave me wanting.  But that place is the one against which I've now begun comparing others and, for better or worse, is likely the reason I wasn't wowed by My Tofu House.  \n\nI ordered up the Kimchi Soft Tofu Soup ($11.99) with beef (pork is also an option).  This item, from this restaurant, made the 2010 Big Eat SF List of \"100 Things to try Before You Die\" and honestly?  It was fine soft tofu soup but I prefer that from the other place.  It might be authentic, but I wasn't overly fond of the flavor imparted by the egg, self-cracked into the soup, where it cooks up in the bubbly broth.  \n\nThe Beef & Vegetable Bibimbab ($16.59) was ordered by my dining partner who liked it, complimented its level of spiciness, then closed the meal by remarking \"the other place does it better\", which pretty much says it all.  \n\nBanchan, including two fresh-fried fish, were good and refills were happily offered.  Tea is poured and refilled by a server into individual cups.  \n\nMy Tofu House closes earlier than many of the nearby Korean joints in this, the area I've dubbed \"the KBBQ District\" and their prices are in line with those nearby places.  That said, dinner here (with tax, but without drinks or tip) came to $31.  The same dinner at the other place, including tax and a beer, ran $25.  Hell, I'm just going to say it:  I do have a favorite Korean restaurant.  Let the heartbreak begin.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Never ordered be short ribs because I feel it is a little pricey for how much you get, but the flavors were spot on.

The rest of their fair was pretty standard: chilli fish cakes, pickled cucumbers, kimchi, bean sprouts, and radishes. These dishes, with exception to the whole fish, are refilled by request.\n\nI had the medium spicy original soft tofu soup. While it was very red in color...it was not spicy...at all. Wish I had known this. It did feature a good amount of tofu and thinly sliced button mushrooms though (enoki would have been better). I ordered mine with pork, but there really wasn't a lot of it...just a few pieces here and there...kind of disappointing.\n\nService-wise, they are kind of odd. They actually let one of my friends who arrived early sit in a booth for over 30 minutes while the rest of us arrived...I mean, it was cool that we had a seat right away, but I can't see this being smart on the business end. And I'm hoping it was an odd coincidence, but they kept refilling one of my friend's and my tea cup, but blatantly skipped over my other friend (not Asian) multiple times...despite his cup being more depleted than ours.\n\nOverall, I found the food to be good, but not amazing. It's price point is San Francisco standard, but I'm not sure I'll be back when I know I can get equal or better quality for $3 less (as far as tofu soups go)...I can't even begin to justify a $23 seafood pancake, so I won't even try.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

The restaurant isn't THAT big, but were they understaffed or does this always happen? My sister and I came here around 1:30pm and there was a 30 min wait, so we came back around 2:45 and got seated 10 minutes later when there were clearly empty tables and NO line except one group of three in front of us. Before we got seated, we took a look at their menu so we could decide what we wanted to save time. Right when we got seated in a booth, our waiter probably took another 10-15 minutes to take our order and give us tea even when I told him immediately we were ready to order.\n\nBy glancing at the menu, I could tell the highlight is their tofu soup (hence their name.) They have a good variety at 11.50 each for lunch and dinner. However, they do have a selection of meat such as bulgogi and kalbi that vary in price depending when you go (lunch is roughly $11-12, dinner is about $21.37 I think? Odd pricing). Lunch prices only go up to 4PM, excluding weekends and holidays I believe so go during a weekday if you can. Each dish comes with a pot of rice and banchan (kimchi, cucumber, sprouts, fish cake). My sister and I shared the original tofu soup with chicken, and one plate of bulgogi. I have to admit, I was REALLY full afterwards. They even gave us a plate of two fried fish.. maybe mackerel? Not too sure. \n\nDefinitely only coming here for their tofu soup in the future.. maybe I'll try the one with ramen noodles in it. Do NOT come here if you're looking for a variety of korean dishes... unless you're craving STRICTLY spicy tofu soup. Go somewhere else instead.\n\nAlso, forgot to add that I wanted the tofu soup medium spicy. Was barely spicy at all (almost felt like there was no spice at all).

The soondooboo is around $10 and pretty good.  I would note that their spice levels are pretty weak, though.  So, even if you think you're a weakling, I'd suggest you go a level up.  For example, I'm weak, so I asked my soup to be \"mild.\"  When it came out, it was pretty much white.  I tried my sister's \"medium\" soondooboo, and I would consider that to be mild.\n\nThe banchan selection is decent, but not amazeballs like some places in, say, the Temescal area of Oakland where they give you like a dozen items.  Here you get a fried fish, kimchi, pickled cucumbers, some bean curd thing, some bean sprouts.  Decent.  \n\nThe meat dishes are pretty overpriced for dinner portions.  It's like $20+ for each BBQ platter, which is really a bit much.  \n\nOverall, the food is good and it'll probably hit the spot if you're craving Korean in San Francisco.", "author": "Vivian C."}

Their tofu always has the perfect soft texture and the soup is super flavorful. However, besides the tofu soup, everything else tastes just mediocre. In addition, this place is way too expensive.

They also brought me an entire pot of rice which was way more than I could have finished but it was delicious with a few green peas and chick peas sprinkled in. The mushroom soup had TONS of mushrooms which was great because sometimes when you order a tofu soup with beef (or another item) it seems as though you only receive a couple pieces. Not here!

Ice never had those before as a side dish and they were delicious!\n\nPrices are reasonable and service was friendly even after we stayed past closing time. It's located next door to one of my favorite Korean BBQ places too so that block has pretty much all the good grub I can handle. While it's no replacement for the cheap Chinese joint I frequent, I will most certainly be back for more tofu soup.\n\nFood: 8/10\n\nService: 7/10\n\nPrice: $$\n\nAtmosphere: 7/10", "author": "Joe M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-18", "description": "My Tofu House is an excellent choice on cold evenings when you need something warming in the belly to get your body temperature back up to 98 degrees.  As we all know, the Richmond tends to be cold and damp at this time of the year.  So the location at Geary and 10th Avenue in the heart of the district is ideal.  As a kind of Asian warming hut, it's top notch.  At $11.50 for a hot bubbling bowl of tofu soup, tea, tons of rice, a fried fish, and a bunch of little appetizer plates typical of Korean cuisine, it's affordability is hard to beat.  It's truly an excellent deal.\n\nIf you're like me and dislike waiting, I advise an earlier 6-6:30pm arrival time.  I arrived at about 6:45pm last night, and I waited about 10 minutes.  There are plenty of tables, but crowds do descend at peak times and a line does form quickly then.   This is not a fast food spot, so expect to wait a bit because they do get busy.  But you won't be waiting forever.  Their menu is relatively simple, and they've thus got the service system down well.  After setting down tea, I ordered the Combo Tofu soup:  tofu with beef, shrimp, and clams. \n\nThe small plates are a treat.  If you're hungry and your chopsticks are poised, you'll tuck into these as soon as they appear.  There are meat strips, cucumber, daikon, sprouts, kim chi (naturally), a raw egg (for the soup), firm tofu, and a small fried fish.  Most of these items come dressed in Korean spices.  You have to like Korean flavoring, in other words, if you want to hang at My Tofu House. It's all Korean, all the time.   It's all good for you, and high in vitamin C.\n\nThe soup arrived boiling in a clay pot.  Take caution, the pot is burning hot and is no joke.  The soup is very hot, too, so save your tongue and let it cool, but not too long.  It's best eaten hot.  You'll find loads of tofu in the soup, with ample pieces of shrimp and clams.  I could have used more beef, so if you want a lot of beef, order the Beef tofu soup.  It felt so good to eat- so warming, so comforting.  I was trying to fend off a cold I felt coming on, so it did me good.  I felt my sinuses clearing any my body warming quickly with each spoonful of piping hot soup.\n\nRice is de rigeur in Asian spots, and they give you a ton at My Tofu House.  The server leaves the hot rice pot at the table for you.  Once all of the rice has been scooped into your silver metal bowl, he slowly pours hot rice broth into the empty rice pot.  The toasted browned rice stuck to the sides of the pot soak into the broth, producing a warm rice soup that is enjoyed at meal's end.  All very good.  \n\nOn the whole, My Tofu House is very representative of affordable Asian fare in SF.  It's affordable, authentic, no nonsense, and efficient.  That is to say, hole in the wall prices but authentic, delicious food.  If you're ever in the Richmond on a cold, foggy evening, My Tofu House is warming hut to try!", "author": "Roland C."}

While I'd like to respond with a resounding \"hells yeah\", My Tofu House, like Jang Su Jang, was not quite as stellar as I was hoping - their dumpling tofu soup (a little over $10) was quite tasty, but their \"spicy\" lacked kick. As a big plus though, despite having a smaller selection of banchan than most places, one of these is a tasty fried fish, something I don't see served very often.\n\nPrices are a tad higher than other Korean restaurants, but not unreasonably so, service is quick and friendly, and the restaurant is kept clean (and looks much nicer inside than one would expect from outside).

Yes, all of that for just me for lunch. \n\nThen they came out with a big pot of rice and proceeded to dole out 1.5 bowls of it. Again just for me for lunch.\n\nThen came my order of kimchi soft tofu soup w/ pork & mushrooms which I spooned over the rice to eat. The tofu was good and had a nice silky texture. However, I expected the dish to be at least slightly spicy since I got medium but it was more like mild. I was hesitant to get the \"spicy\" in case it was too much but I guess I shouldn't have worried because the spice levels have been westernized. Kimchi tofu soup really should be super spicy. Like nose running, head sweating spicy. \n\nDon't be put off by the exterior.

The woman who greeted us was very friendly and we were sat the second we walked through the door which is always appreciated! The menu is small and standard: tofu soup, bibimbap, bbq, and Korean pancakes. I ordered the beef and vegetable bibimbap and my boyfriend ordered the seafood and vegetable bibimbap. Our waitress took our order and brought out the banchan quickly, but that's the last we saw of her until it was time for us to pay (even when we were out of water and/or tea).\n\nThe banchan was also standard: bean sprouts, fishcakes, cucumber, kimchee, and kkakdugi. Notice how I didn't mention the coveted fried fish everyone else is talking about? Yeah that's cause we didn't get any. Though every other table seemed to like theirs so I'm sure it's good!\n\nFood came out promptly and was nice and hot, but I did notice that they added mushrooms even though it wasn't mentioned that they would be adding it. Not a big deal, I just wish I would have known so that I could have asked for it without mushrooms cause it's a bit of a pain to pick it out. Anyways, the bibimbap was good, standard just like everything else. The biggest upside is that they do not skimp out on the meat, so I didn't have to spend time portioning it out so I could get meat in every bite lol. \n\nOverall it was okay, a bit underwhelming. I think what really killed it though is the price. It was $16 for each of our dishes! The most expensive Korean food I have ever eaten! But most everyone else seems to love it so I would say it's worth a try! It's just that my go-to Korean restaurant is nearby, much cheaper, and way better quality (with more banchan too)!

The seafood in mine had the texture of rubber, and was doused in some sort of ketchup like barbecue sauce that overpowered everything. The rice was super greasy and did not crisp up in the hot stone bowl the way it should when bibimbap is properly prepared. \n\nMy mother had better luck with her \"baked\" tofu bibimbap. The tofu had a nice texture and was not drowned in sauce, and her rice crisped up. The portions are generous. Under normal circumstances, we would have been eager to take away what couldn't eat at the time and enjoy it later. However, in this case, we were only too glad to see it taken away, albeit to waste so much food. \n\nEven the side dishes were insipid compared to our previous visits. No spinach or little anchovies. The spread was fairly monochromatic. The only saving grace was the serving of fried little fishes at the beginning which seemed appropriately cooked with a nice texture crispy skin. \n\nThe hot tea is served out of glass pitchers into water glasses, which may be practical, but aesthetically unappealing. It reinforced the generic BLAH feeling of the whole eating experience.  \n\nThe service was decent but the food so insipid that we will not be going back.

I was hoping there'd be some noodle dishes....\n\nOne word to describe this place: pricey. I wanted a korean pancake, but it's almost ~$20 for an order! I got the dumpling soft tofu soup (comes with dumplings, rice cake, and beef) and my boyfriend got galbi. The soup was average in my opinion, nothing special and expensive for what it is ($11.95). Had few bits of beef, but there were about 3-4 dumplings, which were good. The broth thickened pretty quickly so it was not as liquid-y as I would've liked it to be. The galbi was alright as well, but didn't seem anything special. The pieces were a bit more on the fatty side. The side dishes were OK, I was expecting more variety. \n\nIn general, I was expecting more from this place after seeing the ratings and reviews.

The program is somewhat different than the norm. The menu is small, either you get a soft tofu soup, or a barbecue, or a pancake, or a bimbap. Other than the pancake all are equally amazing.\n\nService is desultory. They have hoods over the tables but I don't think they let you cook it for yourself. If you do order an expensive-ish meat dish they cook it for you in the kitchen and bring out no extra service or sides, just a large tower of cooked meat. \n\nOn the other hand MTH is seriously good food. The Banchan (random free dishes that come out with your meal) is limited and spars. When they bring six things out to your table instead of the usual twelve it feels like a ripoff, until you taste it. Each of the six items (deep fried little fish, fish cake, bean sprouts, pickled cucumbers, kimchi, and kimchi daikon) is excellent and ample.", "author": "Gil S."}

Once I walked in, I was stunned by how clean it was. I guess most Korean restaurants I visit are oily, stinky, dirty and looked like they haven't been cleaned in years, but My Tofu House had such a clean feeling!  My friend was craving tofu soup so we decided to go here for lunch.\n\nI got the Mild Pork Original Tofu Soup. My friend said she had been before and wasn't gutsy enough to try mild, but I had to get a little bit!  It was just a hint of spiciness. Barely anything, but enough to taste. Definitely no heart burns after lunch today!  I kinda wished it had a bit more spiciness though. The kim chee was definitely more spicy than the soup. \n\nBack to the soup....I loved the presentation. It came bubbling in a stone pot, and you have the option of cracking your own egg into the hot soup!  WOW. It doesn't cook all the way, but enough for the egg to be warm and runny, just the way I love it!\n\nThe restaurant also served us the typical appetizers one would expect to get at a Korean restaurant, i.e. Kimchee, bean sprouts, cucumber, marinated textured tofu. But they also had the fried anchovies which was surprisingly delicious! Two whole anchovies, about 6 inches long! I was impressed.  Cucumber was delicious too, as well as that cold textured tofu. \n\nService was friendly, they checked in to see how we were enjoying our meal. Also, they let us switch tables after we found out it was too cold sitting next to the door. \n\nCan't wait to return!!!!!!!!

The closest one to me is Manna in inner sunset, so that is what I'm mainly comparing it to.  \n\nThe side dishes were good.  They didn't have my favorite side dish though-this seaweed thing, but it did come with a fried fish.  (I'm not a fan, but I know that's a huge plus for most people).  I also felt the cucumbers were really thick and thus didn't have much flavor.  \n\nThe ambiance was fine.  We came right before they closed so there was no wait whatsoever and we were the last people there.  \n\nThe pork bi bim bop was good.  Very well done in a stone pot with all that nice crispy rice on the sides.  I thought there was too much meat in the dish- generally I like it for the rice and vegetables, but the BF thought there wasn't enough.  Does that mean there was the perfect amount for normal people?  If we had just ordered that, that dish would still be a 4-5.  3-4 for the side dishes.\n\nThe spicy beef tofu soup was good, but not great.  I felt like i was pretty average.  Maybe it was just because I needed it a lot more spicy.  I like it when my mouth feels like its' burning a little bit.

Of course, the portions are also smaller than dinner but it is worth getting. \n\nThe service is good. The servers are friendly and will consistently give you refills on the appetizers whenever you ask.

We stopped by Korean Village a couple of doors down Geary, but we were taken aback by the huge pricetags on their barbecue dishes. We made a hasty retreat into the dark with only this place or Jack-in-the-Box within view. We made the right choice, don't you think?\n\nI had to pull Jamie into this place since tofu is antithetical to the dietary sensibilities of a Detroit-raised, meats-and-potatoes eater.

We got seated in a spacious booth - a nice change from the cramped corner we were relegated to at Boboquivari's the night before. \n\nThe menu is standard Korean fare, but as we were waiting, we noticed the $8.75 Kimchee Tofu Soup (Soon-Dubu Chigae) was listed in 7x7 as a must-have. We ordered a steaming bowl of it with medium-hot kimchee and strips of pork, and it came in a volcanic state that took a good twenty minutes to calm down completely (see photo). I didn't know I was supposed to crack the raw egg into the boiling broth since it came much earlier. I cracked it over my bowl of rice since my Japanese heritage made me think of sukiyaki. It was spicy-tasty once the heat was under control. \n\nOf course, we were already munching on the banchan, which consisted of six plates of goodies - salted sardines, little dried anchovies, pickled cucumbers, bean sprouts, two types of kimchee (see photos). We ate most of it over the rice that was steaming in the big metal crock left on our table. The massive pile that were the $15.25 Broiled Short Ribs (Kal Bi) came soon afterward, and it was savory delicious (see photo).

It was more salty than sweet, and I felt a little bit overwhelmed without a little palette cleanser. The fried fish was actually very good with the tofu stew, and I quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe tofu stew was a little bland. I got the mushroom tofu stew, mild spice. I guess I should have gotten medium, but I still was hoping for a little bit of a kick with mild. There were lots of mushrooms and tofu in the stew, which I appreciate. They also give you a raw egg to crack in your stew, which I love.\n\nOh, and a warning: If you're used to getting a  bibimbap sans spicy sauce, be careful. My friend ordered the bibimbap and it already came with spicy added to it. It ended up being a little too much for him (he usually adds some sauce to his liking when it comes without).\n\nOverall, if I were in the area and was craving Korean, I might give this place another shot. This time I was a little underwhelmed.", "author": "Denise C."}

They did have time to talk about some girl on the other table (yes, I understand Korean). When I did eventually flag them down, they had the nerve to look at the empty dish, and tell me they would refill when we are finished.

Deep fried fish served was cold. Literally, my tea was warmer than the fish. Kimchi was barely descent. Banchan was very limited and extremely basic (fishcakes were hard. Hard to taste the staleness with the chili sauce). No stonebowl rice soup with bori cha (barley tea) included with the meal.

I did check to see how good the $20 pancake looked because the table across from us did order one. Sorry folks, no gold flakes or rubys coming out of that flour.\n\nOverall, as you can probably tell, this place is trash. It is beyond me how this place got 4 stars. Im giving it 2.

There was more seafood than I've seen at other places in my bowl.  The tofu was soft and creamy.   We shared the seafood and vegetable bibimbap and it was good, but would have been better with a bit more seafood and/or vegetables to go with the rice.  The banchan included sprouts, kim chee, cucumbers, daikon radish and fried fish, which was moist and flavorful.  Although I'm used to seeing more variety of banchan, I still appreciated that patrons are allowed to ask for more of each item.\n\nService was friendly and very efficient.  Our food arrived quickly and piping hot.  The rice was a good texture and flavor.\n\nPatrons tend to consist of the younger crowd, but there were a few families as well.  Prices are very reasonable.

My only regret (and tip for new customers) is that I didn't go spicier. You can choose the spice level of your soup and i picked mild, thinking that the spice levels were going by the more intense Korean standards. In case you need a reference: I think Shin ramen spicy is the perfect level of spicy and anything too far beyond that makes me uncomfortable. The medium level spicy at Tofu House is less spicy than a Shin ramen, and the mild level is not spicy AT ALL. Thus, I plan to get medium or hot level spicy next time. Oh, and i thought the *seafood soondubu* was better than the *seafood + beef combination*, so get the former if you're having trouble deciding!!\n\np.s. there is a small Korean grocery store right next door to the restaurant, so you can pick up some essentials on your way home!", "author": "Adrienne C."}

So it has proved to be quite challenging to find any place nearly as good as the restaurants I used to frequent.  \n\nSo I was excited to find My Tofu House, I became very hopeful seeing the whole fried fish banchan-that's one of the sign of serious Korean restaurant to me.  \n\nI would say My Tofu House didn't disappoint me.  My all time favorite Korean dish is  \"Soon Tofu (sundubu jjigae)\" and it's especially difficult to find good place even in L.A. I would say My Tofu House's Soon Tofu got very close to my favorite flavors I used to eat, so I was very happy !! Rice was also good !! Finally.....cooked in stone pot and came right out, served on the table.  Hot, fluffy and yummy.  \n\nBanchan themselves are okay. Whole fried fish I usually love was a bit dry and not as fluffy as I usually like it to be.  Kimchi ?  I tasted so much better ones in the past including the home made one by Korean moms...so it's hard to criticize, however I can say all tasted good and better than any places I have been in Bay Area so far.  \n\nI'll be back for more Soon Tofu !", "author": "Motoko H."}

They gave 2 fried fish in the selection which were super crispy and delicious. \n\nThe prices of the other dishes besides the tofu seemed high to me but looked and smelled amazing as they came out of the kitchen.

Always wanted to try it because I frequent the Korean mart next door for their kimchi (yes, all the way from the Peninsula).  What can I say?  I had the seafood tofu stew.  Taste was pretty nostalgic.  Their ban chan dishes were a good portion size too.  They gave me two cooked fish when most restaurants usually only give one (but maybe because it didn't have much meat on it).  \n\nI hear there's always a line and people have to wait.  It was true because I got there around 11:30 in the AM and there was a line by the time I got out.  I would go early if you plan to have a meal here or else plan on waiting.

Ban chan or side dishes were also really good. There was a spicy fish cake that was the bees knees and a tangy sesame cucumber dish that was good for those who don't like spicy. Other side dishes were just ok. Cabbage and radish Kim Chee was average. Bean sprouts were meh. But we still got a free refill of the side dishes. Don't be afraid to ask!\n\nSeafood pancake was really pricy for how much you got and how good it was. Not bad but 22 bucks? Not worth to me.

The Bulgogi was really flavorful and juicy--as was the Kalbi ribs, too. My only disappointment was that both meat items could have been grilled or broiled a tad longer to get a little crisp char on them.

The wait time was bearable....about 15 minutes for a table for 4 people. They serve free Barley tea (which I am a fan of) and it's pretty good. Has a nutty flavor to it. Water, you will need to request for it. But as long as I can get free Barley tea, I'm all good.\n\nWe ordered the seafood bibimbap and seafood soft tofu and kalbi ribs. The Kalbi ribs, barbecued just right, with all the right seasonings and good marinade. There were a few pieces that had a lot of fat with it, but I didn't care. I love kalbi more than I love bulgogi! \n\nThe seafood soft tofu was ordered mild...actually more like absolutely spicey-free, only because of my father's preference. It was good, but I would've wanted the spiciness added for a kick. The tofu texture and soup were good, though.\n\nThe bibimbap was okay. My mom liked it a whole lot more, but, it was missing something...a little bland and it had a burnt taste to it.  Thank God there was ban chan to complete the entire meal. I may need to try a different type next time.\n\nLast time I was here, the kimchee wasn't good. I still stand by that statement. I don't know what it is.

Was quickly seated at one of the few regular tables (everything else is a booth meant for 4-6 ppl) and ordered the original tofu soup, seafood bibibab, and bulgogi.  Total came out to around $46 pre-tax.  Not bad for a whole lot of food and banchan for 3 people.\n\nSpeaking of banchan, I really, really liked that they had yellow croakers.  Some Krn places don't offer that so whenever I do get it, I'm a happy gal.  Also, their kim chi is really crispy and delicious.  It's not tooooo sour and has a little bit of heat to it.  Not bitter at all!\n\nThe bulgogi was soft and flavorful.  They chopped up the meat into tinier pieces so you won't get caught with a long dangling piece of beef...yeah, that didn't sound too appetizing, huh?\n\nThe bibibab was HUUUGE.  It came in a really hot stone pot that stayed warm the entire hour.  The pot was the size of a large pho bowl!  The food was ok, but I didn't like the texture of the rice so I will pass on ordering this again.\n\nHowever, I would definitely reorder the original tofu soup.  It came with plenty of meat (we got chicken), dried seaweed squares, and soft, soft tofu.  Mmmm, totally hit the spot and warmed me up!  Even though we ordered the \"medium spiciness\", it didn't even taste spicy at all to me.\n\nService was pretty decent, but it took a couple of tries to get the waiter to come and take our order.  We were one of the last people to be seated for the evening and while we were eating, I noticed that the workers were all really diligent about tidying up the restaurant.  Very awesome, but it made it kind of hard to make requests.  At least they came by randomly to add more hot tea to my cup.  Thanks!  :)\n\nOverall, I'd want to visit MTH again.  I just wish SF area had a better parking situation.  Also, I noticed that MTH has mostly booths instead of regular tables.  If a few large groups showed up at the same time, they'd all have to wait or agree to be separated.

Luckily, the restaurant wasn't super crowded like it was when the same group of us ate here at the beginning of the year, so there was room for me to stretch and breathe while eating.\n\nThe banchan showed up first and these were probably my least favorite things. It all looked good, but the taste wasn't there on the kimchee, so I just gave up after one bite. I'm pretty sure the rest of the table felt the same way since the other little pickled dishes kind of sat there through the rest of the meal. This is too bad since banchan can be the best part of the meal at other Korean restaurants (especially Mom's where they serve those tiny little anchovies!). \n\nWe split a vegetable pancake as an appetizer. This was good. Kind of like a Chinese green onion pancake if you've had one, but a little more egg-y and onion-y with a more runny center. I wouldn't advise biting into it right away when it shows up or else you'll get the equivalent of molten lava in your mouth! Once it cooled down, it was pretty damn delicious.\n\nFor my entree I got the beef and vegetable bibimbap. It came in that awesome little superheated stone bowl so that the rice on the sides gets crispy and crunchy. There was a small amount of beef (fine with me since I'm not a huge carnivore), a lot of diced up veggies, and an egg. I mixed the whole thing up and added a ton of hot sauce and dug in. To be honest, I probably didn't need the hot sauce since it was already spicy enough and soon I was mopping my brow to remove a bit of sweat. I almost finished the entire bowl which is a testament to how good it was since I'm not a huge fan of too much rice!\n\nMy Tofu House is clean and tidy and not too congested like Mom's Tofu.

The waiter quickly brought us hot tea and also water, after we asked.    \n\nWe then ordered and were brought out a variety of side dishes: kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumbers, potato, and some small fish dish.  They were all pretty tasty.  Next, the waiter brought each of us a fried fish, extra plates, our bowls of rice, and a raw egg for our tofu soup.\n\nEach of us ordered a tofu soup and one person also ordered a seafood pancake for us to share.  \nI ordered #1 ($10.28): the original tofu soup, medium spice, with beef.  The soup came out bubbling, it was really hot and quickly cooked the raw egg I cracked into it. The medium spice was just the right amount of kick for me. Another person thought the spice was a bit strong. There is an abundance of soft tofu in the soup and a few pieces of beef scattered throughout.  The overall taste of the soup is really good and it goes great with the rice.  \n\nThe seafood pancake, at about $17.50 is a bit pricey for an appetizer/side dish. But it is rather large and it's really tasty. The pancake had very large chunks of calamari dispersed throughout and the dish came with a dipping sauce as well. \n\nOverall, I was impressed by My Tofu House.

It's not extremely fancy -- or fancy at all for that matter. But that's what adds to its charm. The wooden booths, modest dishware, and plain decor makes the meal comfortable throughout. Not to mention if you park far enough away, the freezing walk over makes the hot soup taste even better.\n\nThere is usually a wait, but have never waited over 30 minutes with a party of two. The place is clean, and the service is bearable. Must try the combination tofu soup (seafood + beef) with medium spicy. Make sure the break the egg in as soon as the soup arrives, so it cooks!", "author": "Catherine C."}

But if luck would have it, I was in a very ambitious mood for something new and different.  Why not give this place a try.\n\nWent with a few friends here on a Thursday nite and low and behold the wait wasn't bad at all.  Actually no reservation, no line, no problem.  Now lets eat......\n\nWe were seated in a wooden booth comfortably.  We can chose to have it cook and serve to us rather than doing it ourselves.  We ordered the BBQ chicken, pork and of course the beef spareribs.  Absolutely very tasty and good.  Given that we are in a tofu house we gotta order the spicy tofu soup with mixed seafood.   This soup goes very well with their rice.  Love their sticky rice. That was very yummy.  And of course with any Korean dinner, we had a whole spread of condiments.  \n\nOne in particular that caught my attention is the fried fish.  Never seen that as one of their many condiments but nonetheless, a good one.  Given that this place does lack customer service, I still enjoyed the meal that night.  No ambience just plain good Korean bbq and tofu.\n\nPrices here are very reasonable so I would definitely come back for more.", "author": "Angela L."}

Recently, the bff & I let someone into our very exclusive, very elite (suck on that, yelp) secret society of sorts;  she is a lovely filipina & when we go out for din, she picks Asian. I'm down for whatever, especially to my eyes being opened to something new & potentially delicious. \n\nI've had Korean food before. My family makes crazy-good KBBQ. I've eaten *IN* Korea. Compared to my previous experiences with this cuisine, My Tofu House wasn't *MY* favorite tofu house. \n\nWe ordered:\n-- dumplings soup tofu ($10.28): medium spice. You crack an egg into the boiling soup to cook it. Too many mushy things in one pot. I'm a texture whore. I needed something crispy or crunchy. \n-- baked tofu & veggie bibimbap ($14.62): I only tried the tofu, which was covered in a tangy BBQ sauce. \n-- kalbi/short ribs ($21.69): really great flavor & marinade, but really fatty (sorry, I'm a recovering semi-vegetarian... I will always complain about too much animal fat.)\n-- bulgoki/ sliced rib eye ($19.87): salty marinade. I liked the short ribs better. \n\nPricey, fairly long wait (20 min on a weeknight), so-so service. The bottom line is-- none of the four items we tried were all that appetizing to me, so 2 stars because I most likely will not return.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

I have to have it at least once a wk now at the very least. Tonite was one of those days that is perfect for a nice hot and spicy soon dubu. After hrs of studying with the gf it was time for dinner and Korean food was the first and only thing on my mind. Upon entering My Tofu house, I noticed that it was very busy and probably one of the cleanest Korean restros i have ever seen. I really liked the fact that they had many booth seats, always nice to be closed to love ones or friends while you are eating a family style meal!\n\nFirst came the ban chan, which i thought was lacking. The usual suspects where there: Kimchi, cucumbers, bean sprouts and dried sardines. Compared to many other places it was sparse and non existent. They did however have the deep fried fish. yummy http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/WhbaoCmPOBMTkQ9TV_SUVw/l\n\nNext came the Kimchi Soon Dubu, we ordered it medium spicy with beef. It had very good flavor and warmed us from the inside out. soft tofu, beef, mushrooms in spicy soup. mmmmmhmmm marvelous! http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/oLCn4I8P2gWaKa0E5GexOQ/l\n\nThen came the BBQ Pork & Veggie Bibimbap. Bibimbap is one of the gf's favs, she loves when the rice gets stuck to the bottom of the dolsot. its becomes hard and crunchy. The Bibimbap had amazing flavor http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SyZDMjCa0sFXWzlnqYAfRg/l\n\nAnd Then Dak Bulgogi- A very generous portion of Dak Bulgogi came out  sizzling. The flavor packed quite the punch to your tongue and mouth. Simply irresistible!!! http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/LrEY5r4P9WNLP4YoVCivgQ/l\n\nLast but not least Seafood Pancake. My Tofu House's pancake is a tiny bit thicker than what i was used to it but it still had a crisp exterior and soft and delicious inside. http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/KD7GCjBskgh_PiSOb_IDAg/l\n\nWhen the check came, There was Korean Melon Gum! ^_^ http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Wl_8UObTSSro1pzOxa9zEg/l\n\nMy tofu house a very good soon dubu place!

This definitely filled us up since it came with lots of rice and the side dishes were my mom's favorite. \n\nThe only thing I am a tad thrown off by is the lunch, dinner, and holiday pricing. Something about coming here for dinner and holidays seems not worth it if I can get it for about half off during lunch. \n\nOther than that, a pretty good eat for once in a while.", "author": "Leslie L."}

The place actually looks very nice and clean inside.  It can get confusing from there since there isn't really a stand or a person there waiting to take your name.  Usually there are a bunch of people up against the walls of the entrance waiting to be seated, as you walk further in towards the dining area you'll see a clipboard hung on your right on the wall.  That's the waiting list for a table.\n\nThe tables are very spacious, even the two top booths.  They give a wide variety of side dishes, more then enough to almost make a meal out of.  We've tried a couple of dishes here and have never been disappointed.  We love the bibimbap and spicy pork, but on top of it all we loved their tofu soups.  Let me tell you first off that I really REALLY don't like tofu, like at all.  I hate the texture, the taste, and everything else about it.  I've tried it cooked so many ways and in so many dishes and NOTHING tastes good to me.  So with that being said, this is the ONLY place that I will eat tofu.  Weird, I know ... I thought so to.  It's different here, and I don't know why or what they do, but it is different -- otherwise I would've spit it out like I did all the other dishes I've had elsewhere.\n\nThe service is great and though the price is a little high I feel like the food fits the price.

The banchan was good but I also would have preferred a few more options. The specialty seemed to be soondubu but it was just too warm out, so instead we had: tofu bibimbap, vegetable pancake, spicy pork, and bulgolgi. \n\nThe vegetable pancake tasted great but was on the bland side, so the accompanying sauce was definitely appreciated (although it was mainly just salty). I like the big pieces of vegetables well-distributed through the pancake, and it was cooked well. I thought both the meat dishes were delicious, although other people found the pork to be just a tad too spicy. The onions and mushrooms in the dishes added a lot and were delicious in and of themselves. I was not as impressed with my tofu bibimbap. Maybe I was expecting more out of the tofu, but the whole thing didn't seem to come together, and I'm not sure why. \n\nThe service was friendly but it sometimes took a fair number of attempts to get more water, etc. Like a moron I left my leftovers at the table, and they really nicely held on to them so when I went back five minutes later I could pick them up.

I usually pride myself on having some restraint when it comes to good food but I just couldn't put down my spoon this time. My Tofu House is normally packed at all hours of the night so I try not to waste my time trekking it from the suburbs. I haven't been here one time when the line wasn't at least 30 minutes long. One time I remember getting an order of fries from the Jack in the Box next door just to hold me over till we were sat.  \n\nTonight however, we were sat right away because we arrived at 8:30 and just missed the dinner rush. It wasn't one of the cozy booths flanked by the walls but a seat is a seat and I kind of enjoyed hearing the gossip and chatting flying above our heads so it all evened out. I never noticed till tonight how the menu was only two pages. Open the book and BAM, there it is-the left and right side of the menu and no other options. Not even pot stickers. Hmmm...\n\nWe ordered the combination and dumpling soondubu and anxiously awaited our banchan which consisted of dried yellow croaker and various little plates of cucumbers and kimchi. This is the only tofu house that incorporates fish with banchan so when you say, \"that tofu house with the fish,\" people know what you're talking about. While we were waiting for soup, a server brought the rice over and served the standard 3 bowls out of the stone bowl they serve rice in. How is that not awesome? They cook rice in a stone dish that they normally serve dolsot bibimbop in and they put garbanzo beans and green peas on top. I love the little touches they add to their dishes.\n\nSo the soups arrive sizzling hot in their bowls and yes, the banchan is not the greatest but the spiciest of the stew is what sets it apart. If you've read my reviews, you know I like me some spicy soup and the capsaicin meter in my mouth is actually used when I'm here. The dumplings are delightfully plentiful and a hearty contrast to the mushy tofu. The spiciness of the dish is only accentuated by the temperature kept at a constant because of the stone dish. I hate eating cold stew and maybe it was because I was hungry or maybe it was because it was just that good, but soon I was staring down at the black bottom of the bowl. Always a good sign. \n\nI don't know about you guys but I also miss the days when restaurants gave you Korean gum with the check.

That means you better get going and crack that egg kuz it doesn't leave much time for the egg to cook.  The soondobu was...kinda bland, but it was thick and full of tofu (so that wasn't too bad).  The Pajeon was bland too, you really needed the soy dipping sauce.  I found the pancake to be a bit too doughy.  I've had better where it was just full of seafood and veggies in a light batter.  Not worth $17.  And finally, the Daeji Bulgogi was pretty fatty.  Again, on the bland side.  Asked for spicy but didn't come out as spicy as I hoped.\n\nThe meal came out to be ~$60 including tip for 2 people.  Personally, I would have rather gone to a AYCE Korean BBQ for that price tag.  I did leave stuffed and with some left overs...enjoyable meal with a friend, and the soondobu did warm me up...But I think I'll stick to tofu houses in Santa Clara.", "author": "Thien N."}

The \"medium\" spicy level was also not spicy at all I think, more of a \"mild\" on my scale.\n\nAlso had the kalbi, bulgogi, and chicken. The kalbi was good, but again not a standout compared to other restaurants. The bulgogi however, tasted a lot more of ginger than I've ever had. The meat was also a lot thinner. Enjoyable if you like ginger. The chicken was below average to me. I really like the smokiness of the bbq chicken that most Korean restaurants have, but My Tofu House seemed to be lacking that. A disappointment.\n\nOn the positive side, their beef and vegetable bibimbap was the best I've had. I like that they add the right amount of gochujang for you so that the taste is spot on.

Regardless of what you order, you still get banchan (the traditional small Korean side dishes). I like that you get a sizable whole fried fish as one of them. The others include kimchi, bean sprouts, cucumbers, small dried fish, and pickled radish. They don't have as large of a variety of banchan as other restaurants. For example, they didn't have the fishcake or potato ones I like, but I guess the fried fish made up for that. \n\nFor dinner, we decided to do it family style so we could have a little bit of everything. We got the seafood pancake, the combination soft tofu, kalbi (beef short ribs), and the broiled chicken. The short ribs had a bit more fat than I would have liked but everything was delicious. \n\nThe service was good and our cups of tea were kept hot and full.

Also, we decided not to drive so that we would be forced to walk off all that yummy in our tummies. Although of this sounded delightful while we left ,and while we were on the way there... it was slightly less satisfying at the end of the night.\n\nThe wait was an hour long, even for a party of 2.

Plus there isn't much sitting inside for waiting, so be prepared to stand for your food.\n\nI recommend driving - as daunting as the thought may be if you live in the city. The bus only ran every 30ish mins that night, and there's plenty of parking in the area. Plus, despite all that warm food, we were freezing our butts off on the way home. \n\nThe food is good - like other Korean places they will give you refills on the side dishes if you ask them.

He never came back. We had to go to the back to get someone to take our orders.\n\n2. Ordered seafood pancake and it never came, but luckily we weren't charged for it.\n\n3. The waiter came back with the check while we were still eating. He came back after a few minutes and said he wanted us to pay so they could close the check. The restaurant was only starting to fill up (around 6:15ish), so I'm unclear of the rush to get us out.\n\n4. They informed us they did not accept American Express; however one member had left an AE card and had gone to the bathroom. We waited for her to swap out the card, but within seconds a second and third waiter came by to say \"we don't take American Express\". It was unnecessary to continuously repeat that message. We get it.\n\n5. We noticed the check came out higher than expected, but it wasn't until we asked that they confessed gratuity was included.

Originally she gave me the \"are you damn crazy?!\" kind of response, but being the good friend that she is, she said she was down!\n\nCame here last night (Saturday). Looked for parking and had to circle around for a little while. The entire time my friend was saying how she was nervous about getting spicy which started to make me nervous!\n\nGot here around 7:20pm and there was 1 open table left for the both of us, awesome! Not a lot of banchan options, though that's not we were there for. Ordered a spicy dumpling soft tofu soup along with a dak gui (bbq chicken). \n\nWhen our food came, our eyes widened as to how red our tofu soup was. We even had to eat it together after counting to 3 because it was serious business to us. To our surprise, it wasn't even spicy to us! It just had a hint of spiciness that the medium level lacked. We were still able to taste the flavor of the soup, and never felt the need to drink water or cry for that matter. The dak gui was tasty! Good smokey flavor, and succulent chicken pieces. \n\nThe decor is simple, service is great with a bunch of hip Korean boys to cater to your needs. My friend dropped one of her chopsticks on the floor (FAIL) and one of the servers gladly gave her a new one and always offered to refill our ice waters.\n\nFor all of you that are spicy eaters like us, go for spicy!

Actually, mama always knows best... sorry, dads. She picked this spot for the \"heat\" and knowing parking wouldn't be too bad (as long as you get there before 6:30 pm). One of the most common complaints in eating Korean cuisine is that you go home selling like dinner. Not here, since all of the cooking is done in the kitchen. Here's what we ordered for a party of four: \n\nOriginal Tofu with chicken (not spicy - dad's choice) - Bubbling hot crock filled with soft tofu, chicken chunks, mushrooms, and seaweed... add a raw egg and watch it cook. Think chicken broth soup with the above. \n\nCombination Tofu (mild - didn't want to go overboard) - Bubbling hot crock with soft tofu, two or three prawns, beef, mushrooms, clams, and seaweed... again adding a raw egg. This had a subtle kick and, like the above, is great with rice. \n\nKalbi - Hot platter of marinated short ribs on a bed of onions that grill as it sits on the hot plate. Hearty plate for the meat lover (my brother). Nice flavor and great with rice. \n\nDak Gui - Hot platter of marinated boneless, lean chicken meat on a bed of onions. Nice flavor again and... I'm beginning to see a pattern, great with rice. \n\nBanchan - We were given six different appetizers consisting of Kim Cheer, spicy radish, marinated bean sprouts, marinated cucumbers, marinated little silver fishes (not the bugs), and grilled king fish. I'm not big on the fishy ones, but my parents made up for me. \n\nRice - Served in a black iron pot, topped with peas and ginkgo nuts. After they empty the pot, they add tea into the pot to soften the crusty bottom which are nice for second servings. \n\nTofu Salad - Four firm tofu cakes are served on a bed of iceberg lettuce, julienne carrots, sliced mushrooms, and corn niblets in a tangy vinaigrette dressing. \n\nI like this meal for its variety of flavors, from sour to sweet to savory to spicy. We arrived shortly after 6 pm and were fortunate to be seated in an extra dining area closer to the kitchen, as the line grew. Be sure to put your names and party # on their waiting list. The service is very homey and nice as there are basically three people working the floor (orders, serving, and busing). It was nice that a waiter remembered us and served the tofu salad as a bonus to our meal (we didn't order it). By the time we left at 7:30 pm, the line was out the door.

After a long and cold morning in the streets of Chinatown I'm glad we seeked refuge through the tunnel and ended up at My Tofu House! Usually this place gets really packed around lunch time so my friends and I decided to go ~11:30 while most people were still in church so we'd beat the crowds. When noon came we were happy we did because the line ended up winding around entrance to past our field of vision.\n\nThe moment I walked into to secure a spot for lunch, a waiter quickly found me a booth and before I even got a chance to look through the menu my tea was in front of me! As my friends filtered in each one had their cup of tea within moments of being seated, very attentive if not scary-quick service.\n\nNaturally since we were at a tofu house, I ordered the pork tofu soup, medium, my gf got the kalbi because it seemed like a large portion for ~$12 and our friends shared a bibambap. As we waited of course, we were served side dishes that varied from bean sprouts, daikans, anchovies, fish cakes and each of us got a deep fried mackerel. Each side dish was very refreshing and definitely helped prep us for our lunch. The mackerel also really surprised me! Personally I had always had trouble eating them because I couldn't peel them well. My friends laugh as they explain you can eat the fish with the skin on! It was delicious and made devouring the fish so much easier!\n\nAs our food arrived you could smell each of our respective dishes as they smoked and sizzled on their way to our table. I felt almost bad that the people in line were only feet away from us, but the early bird gets the worm right!? My tofu soup was like most, really flavorful and really warmed my core, but what stood out with this particular restaurants tofu soup was that they had more tofu present that I've ever had in this dish, which was a great surprise for me personally. Since tofu does a really good job absorbing the broth its in, each bite was as incredible as the last. My gf's kalbi was also really well cooked, with slight char on the outside yet still noticeable juicy on the inside. \n\nThe only downfall of our trip here was that we had first thought for lunch the kalbi was $12; however, because it was a Sunday all entree dishes are automatically dinner prices, so we ended up paying $22 for the dish, which after finding that out, didn't make the portion to price ratio that appealing. Perhaps we missed a notice, but we looked at the menu before over many times, so maybe it wasn't posted well enough? Not pointing fingers though, because all our dishes and the service made our experience here very fun and memorable; we're sure going to try this place again, and but we'll definitely be on the look out for edited prices!\nSundays = automatic dinner prices!", "author": "Jon K."}

They're usually packed during dinner time and the wait may take 30 mins+. My tip is to get there before 5:30 to get ahead of the crowd. They have a wait list inside and a small waiting room. This place is a bit different from other Korean BBQ places where they let you BBQ your own meat. My Tofu House cooks it for you.\n\nTheir Kalbi, Bulgoki, and tofu soup are great. Definitely well worth a try. The meat are nicely marinated and they're soft and tender. They have a wide selection of tofu soup so whatever floats your boat.

I ordered the regular seafood version (will have to go back to try the fish eggs).  Piquant in both seafood flavor and spiciness. The banchan assortment here was not bad, albeit pretty pedestrian as far as the Korean food I've had goes. However, I must show love for the fried fish banchan, that's a new one! And the fresh rice w/ chickpeas and peas...I love it!\n\nWe also shared a bowl of steaming hot bibimbop, which was excellent. And I've had some bad bibimbop before. The beef was  well marinated, accented with a refreshing assortment of veggies. \n\nMain quibbles about this place are not food related - first, the wait! I guess that's the price of good food. We also waited way too long for our food. Second, the service! The main waiter we had was just...strange...it was like he was on another planet and took forever to give us our banchan or water. Then the waitress who brought the bibimbop out didn't bring out the red sauce, which is key to the full bibimbop experience. Or maybe it's not. Contrary to my obvious obsession with Korean food, I am not Korean. Anyway, when she did bring it, she took the liberty of doing the mixing for us...except she mascerated it as if it were her mortal enemy!  We must have said, \"Um, that's fine..thank you\" at least 3 times before she stopped. Maybe she had too much kimchee that day.\n\nAnyway, I am sooooo happy that I have found a very local place to get my soondubu fix!", "author": "Steph P."}

For the Fish Egg Tofu Soup, they get 5 stars!\n\nAnother good thing about this place is that they have whole fried fish (one for each person) as part of the appetizers, along with kimchi and all the other good stuff. The bad part is that this place is quite expensive. Daeji Bulgogi, Kalbi, those meat dishes cost about $20 here whereas most every other Korean places will price it at about $12-14. However, they are really good and tasty. \n\nThe only dish I would not recommend here is the Seafood pancake.

So, while in San Francisco, I had to see what I was missing in the world of sundubu. I landed here. Yelp was persuasive, but so was the \"100 Places to Eat in SF Before You Die\" feature.\n\nThe interior is cute in a 70s modern way, and it is clean. The servers were incredibly nice Korean guys who were more than happy to make change for the meters out front, which made parking a breeze too!\n\nThe soft tofu soup, i.e. sundubu, was a tad expensive at $10 and change, but I told my hub, \"Hey, we're in San Francisco,\" and he thought the bowls were bigger than our Vegas haunts. At first taste, the sundubu did not blow me away, so perhaps I should have gone for hot instead of medium. The tofu was crumbly, not chunky, which did not bother me because the taste was good. Where this creation did shine was in vegetable inclusion. There were a variety of green things, including a turnip that was a welcome surprise. Plus, they serve dolsot rice, which I don't think they do anywhere in Vegas, a minor bonus, but I don't have to have the crispy stuff to enjoy my tofu soup.\n\nAnother cool thing was the variety of soup. Some came with dumplings; others with ramen. The variety was notable.\n\nI gobbled up some quality, fresh banchan. The spread was for the most part standard fare, but it included two, little whole fish. I think the waiter said they were croaker. This is a neutral event for me, however, because I do not eat little whole fish. My husband said they were salty. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed My Tofu.

The food comes quick and fresh, the banchan is DELICIOUS (albeit a little basic), and the tofu is incredibly soft and just melts in your mouth.  My only regret tofu-wise is not getting the kimchi soft tofu soup - I went with my standard mushroom tofu.  The kimchi with beef is definitely better.\n\nWhat blew me away the most though was the seafood korean pancake.  It came on a hot plate that crisped the pancake to a perfect crunch, hot until the moment you devour.  The plate is so hot that when I cut into the pancake, a tiny piece of octopus fell off the to side and seconds latter popped from the heat and flew into my cup of water.  Didn't touch that again, but the pancake was amazing.\n\nSlightly on the pricey side and a little out of the way, I probably wouldn't come here every week but would happily come here once every month or two when I'm in the area.", "author": "Judy L."}

I had to write my name down on a wait list for a table and ended up waiting 15-20 minutes. Most of the patrons were Asian, and I only noticed one table of non-Asian customers. This convinced me that this place is the real deal.\n\nI ordered the soft tofu soup with beef (as opposed to pork, because the waitress recommended it), with medium spice. The portion was generous, as I couldn't finish all of it in one sitting because it is accompanied by rice. I'm so glad I ordered the medium spice because, being a spicy food lover, found this dish to have the perfect amount of spice. That to me means it is spicy enough to clear sinuses without leaving you teary-eyed and begging for water.\n\n$11.00, one soft tofu soup and 3 cups of tea later, I was rubbing my belly and showing off my big smile of satisfaction.

But when you come to a place called \"My Tofu House\" - I would safely assume that tofu soup is their specialty.\n\nWe ordered 2 soups: The combination and the original soup (both $10.05). We got one mild and one medium. You also get 2 raw eggs to crack in the soup! You also get rice in a stone bowl that the servers help scoop out for you. They then put hot water so you can have the \"rice soup\" at the end of the meal. The tofu soup was delicious. Lots of tofu and meat and full of flavor. My mild soup had barely any \"spiciness\" to it, but the medium soup looked very red and spicy (I did not try this). Overall, it was a very satisfying soup experience!", "author": "Betty S."}

It can really be good for 2 people. unless you're a really heavy carnivore.\n\nOne tip for Bibimbab orders. Make sure you cool your plate first.... i know i know....seeing it and trying it right away can be really exciting... but it can be too hot that it burns your tongue...and when it does, you miss out on the good flavorful stuff in the plate. So...adore it for maybe at least 5 minutes, mixing everything before taking your first bite.\n\nThe order of Kalbi is droolingly yummy!!! one order is probably enough for 2 people. or could be for 3, if there's another entree.

Whatever you choose to put inside, dumplings, seafood, or beef, there are healthy servings. This makes it a steal of a deal for about $10 a serving.\n\nThe sides that come out are very tasty. They are very fresh and aren't overly seasoned. The cucumber, raddish, bean sprouts, dried fish, fried fish, and kim chi can be a meal in itself. It adds to the overall experience and the cold sides are a good palate cleanser and can help cool down your mouth after taking a big helping of spicy tofu soup.\n\nWhile a little expensive at ($14 or $17, sorry i dont remember) the combination seafood pancake is probably the best i've ever had. Its not flat, doughy, soggy, It has a good amount of seafood in it and the dipping sauce isnt too salty or sweet.

My friend and I wanted to eat at a nice place for dinner, but we were so lazy, we said screw it, and she suggested this joint.\n\nI haven't had Korean in a while, and a nice bowl of shared tofu soup and bulgogi sounded amazing. We ventured out to the Richmond and the place was PACKED. It's perfect for 2 people, as we were seated after only 15 minutes (you write your name on a list). However, we were seated in what my friend calls the \"reject\" section, as there were only 3 tables in the back of the restaurant, which probably used to be the pantry. I didn't care. I was hungry. Plus, there was a button you could press if you needed service when the wait staff forgot about you. We didn't have an issue with service though. \n\n Like typical Korean restaurants, they serve side dishes. Although I am used to having more side dishes, this place only had maybe 6 dishes. There was a plate with 2 little fish. My friend isn't a fan, so I decided to attack it. As I was eating it, she decided to tell me that the last time she was there, her boyfriend ate the fish and one of them was pregnant because there were eggs in there. I almost threw up when she told me that. Again, I was hungry so ignored it and continued eating. I must have punctured something because something from the fish squirted onto my hand. I literally \"yelped,\" dropped my spoon onto the table from shock and shoved it to the corner of the table. GROSS. Nevertheless, the rest of the side dishes were standard\n\nWe ordered a huge plate of bulgogi with onions and mushrooms (beef was cooked perfectly), and a bowl of  tofu soup with spicy broth. I'm a spicy girl--the broth could have been spicier, but it was good regardless. The meal also came with rice served in a stone pot--and a nice surprise of garbanzo beans and peas. I never had rice served that way, and it was really good! Total bill was $30 just for the 2 of us, and I'll probably go back there again if I'm ever in the area/someone suggests it---but I'll definitely skip the fish the next time around.

It's just that there's hardly an ethnic restaurant in the City where I feel more foreign than here, even if I am visiting with a Korean. The waiting staff is somber and strict, and I never know if I can even speak English to them. Or maybe because I am just not a fan of fermented stuff, like all the endless kimchees that I am supposed to eat while waiting endlessly until the tofu soup actually gets to the cool enough temperature.\n\nLet me dwell on this point. The food comes sizzling, in thick clay pots that keep the heat forever. And ever. Basically, if you are hungry, do not come to My Tofu House. Unless your tongue is made of asbestos. Yes, you will inhale all the delicious flavours, completely unable to partake, since the temperature of a soup is close to that of a smelting furnace.\n\nAnd it is a good soup, I must say, once you are able to try it 30-40 minutes later. But the place is also somewhat overpriced - which really applies to every Korean restaurant I've been to. I do like the taste of a Korean BBQ, but paying 20-25 dollars for a few slabs of meat that you even have to cook yourself - sorry, not my idea of a money well-spent.\n\nPerhaps I would have given My Tofu House an extra star, if it hadn't been for the sad fact that the place does not serve alcohol.

I totally could have done without the chicken and mushrooms, because it was THAT good.  It came out bubbling HOT and SPICY!  (Just how I like my....!)  The soup was savory but light..full of flavor.

The beef was shredded or thinly sliced (which I thought was interesting...) along with everything else.  I usually opt for an order of grilled Korean BBQ Beef cut up into an order of Bibimbop.

Hahah, next time.\n\nSo we got our side dishes first: kimchee, cucumbers, radishes, little fishes, two grilled fishes, bean sprouts. Delicious. I really like their kimchee. \n\nNext came our soft tofu soup. Bubbling and steaming, we immediately cracked our egg into it and made \"egg flowers.\" The way they serve our rice is nice. They bring out a whole stonepot of the rice, scoop it for you, and leave the \"burnt rice\" at the bottom for you to eat. But instead of just picking the \"burnt rice\", they pour tea into it (different way of eating it.) My mom was like, \"NOOOOOO!\" Hahahaha\n\nThen we got our seafood bibimbap. Pretty good. Tastes like how a seafood bibimbap should taste.\n\nWe decided to order bbq pork to try and to bring home for my dad, but the waiter forgot to put the order in.. We waited pretty long, but oh well, it's okay. Things happen.\n\nOverall, I will definitely come back for the soft tofu soups. They're around 10 bucks each, and it comes with rice and Korean side dishes. The bibimbaps, however, are way to expensive IMO. It's around $15 for it. Our total was $31 for two dishes after tax and tip.", "author": "Jenny Y."}

The kimchee side dishes came out first and the best part was definitely the Yellow Croaker fish, which the server explained was similar to a kingfish.  SO GOOD.  Lots of little bones, but really well cooked with crispy skin still on.  A first for me, they also brought out raw eggs.  I didn't know it was raw, and thankfully I slowly cracked it. \n\nWhen the soup came out sizzling, I was excited.  I first plopped my raw egg in so that it could cook in the heat from the dish.  Let me tell you, by the time I got to that yolk, it was so perfectly stewed in the soup and the texture so good, that the next time I order it, I'm putting in 3 eggs.  \n\nThe tofu was nice and soft, the spiciness of the soup delicious without being overpowering, and the overall consistency: chunky.  Chock full of so many well-balanced elements that I couldn't finish what seemed like a little bowl at first.\n\nThe next time you feel like you're coming down with something, or your significant other is unavailable and you need a cuddly food to keep  you warm, forget pho and forget hot and sour soup...eat this and savor it.", "author": "Tamar D."}

Took about 30 minutes to be seated.\n\nOnce I sat down, they started bringing out the side dishes - pickled cucumber, radish, bean sprouts and a whole broiled fish. All of it was delicious.  I was by myself and felt like it was an absurd amount of food (absurd in a good way).  I definitely had to put some aside so I'd have room for the bibimbap.\n\nI had the bibimbap with chicken and vegetables.  It was good, though slightly bland, and I was disappointed there wasn't siracha or another chili sauce on the table.  Definitely could have used a little more heat - I am a huge weenie when it comes to spicy foods, so you know it was mild.  Service was a little spotty, so by the time a waiter came by to check if I needed anything, I was already halfway through the meal.  I ended up eating it as is with no additional spicyness.\n\nTotal for bibimbap, a diet coke and tip was $20.  Not the greatest deal, but given the amount of side dishes, I felt it was fairly reasonable. If I had that same meal on a weekday, the cost would have been half that as part of their lunch special, so that might be a better bet.  \n\nOverall, I'd go back if I'm in the nighborhood, but I don't know if I'd need to make a special trip.", "author": "Kent E."}

This is the first place I saw with it.  AND it was WELL WORTH IT!  I ordered mine spicy and it came out in about 10-15 minutes.  The pot was boiling, the way I like it so that the egg can cook properly.  It was the perfect spicy and the tofu tasted great!  I hate places that have tofu that is too old and should have been thrown away but instead they threw it in your pot.  The meat was just alright.  I like that they gave fish for banchan which made the lack of other banchan forgivable.  However, the little banchan they had was good.  Normally, Korean restaurants are hit or miss with banchan but it was a hit here.  They also cook the rice in the hot pot which always tastes a tad bit better than the ones cooked in the large industrial sized rice cookers.  \n\nBeing used to home-made soondubu from my mom or BCD in LA, this is probably the closest to great soondubu you're going to get in San Francisco.

Totally lacking. One of our only shortcomings though, phew.\n\nBut as far as tasty soondubu up here - it doesn't get any better than My Tofu House. When it's cold outside (and it usually is here in San Francisco), what's more ideal than getting into a cozy wooden booth with friends to thaw out with hot, cast iron pots filled with the still bubbling, delicious savory/spicy tofu soup and a heaping bowl of perfectly cooked, short grain rice? Tasty, relatively healthy, and filling. Totally hits the spot. :)\n\nArguably what would be more of a 3 star joint if My Tofu House were transplanted to Southern California, but up here - it's the best you'll find for tofu soup. The tofu soups range from a reasonable 10-12 dollars (with the usual free sides - kimchi, bean sprouts, pickled radish, fried fish, and a huge pot of rice), you pick your meat (pork, chicken or beef, and the spicy level varies from white/non-spicy to extra spicy. Medium spicy is just right for me, but the mild is pretty tasty as well for those of you who want just a liiiiittle bit of a kick. Whatever level you get, though, the broth will be piping hot and delicious. Trust.\n\nEverything else is passable - the meat is expensive, the appetizers are okay but nothing to write home about (plus, back to the expensiveness - the pancake is priced randomly super high at $17.13 - wtf? Is that necessary?! It's just batter, dude). But you should know that already - what with the name of the place being called My Tofu House and all.\n\nThere's always a wait, though it fluctuates randomly.

I should explain that we've been together and in at least half of that time I've LOVED Korean Food; more specifically SoonDobu and he's only started enjoying Bibimbap about a month ago. In fact, I think this was probably his 5'th time eating it. So, our joint exploration of Korean eateries is fairly new and he is still getting his palette acclaimated. I am trying to make sure to keep those experiences positive so that he will continue to want to return. I digress...\n\nWe waited about 30 minutes to be seated and, I was pretty excited that there was a long wait - for me it's an indicator of a great meal ahead if that many people love it.\n\nMy date and I were led  with 2 other groups to the back room (some nether region between the bathroom and the main dining area, just outside the kitchen). No windows and the only way out was the one way in, which was a narrow doorway covered by a curtain leading to a narrow hallway, passing the kitchen on the way to the main eating area. An afterthought of sorts.\n\nMy date orders the Bibimbap and I ordered the mushroom tofu and excitedly said, \"spicy!\" when the server asked me how spicy. Panchan arrived shortly after and it was pretty good (so this, too, was a good sign!).\n\nThey serve us our main dishes, but my date doesn't get his kochujang (the \"Korean Ketchup\" as we call it) and because we're in the back room, it takes a while before the server comes back for us to ask him for it. By this time, we'd already started eating. I tried both dishes and they were equally bland. The beef in the Bibimbap did not have much flavor, and my soondobu was not as thick as I'd heard it reported and not really that spicy. I added the 2 fishheads from the panchan and let it sit in the stew a bit for some added flavor and the flavor improved to the point where I did not even mind the soupiness anymore.\n\nWhen the server finally comes back around I ask him for some kochujang for my date and he apologizes and disappears. He comes back a couple more times without it and I ask him again. Again, he apologizes and finally brings us some - my date is more than halfway through his meal at this point.  His meal improves a bit, too after adding the kochujang, but we've been sitting in a tiny window-less room for a good 30 minutes by then and not really enjoying our experience at that point.\n\nThe server was nice enough when he was around, but I think the back room left us a bit neglected. The flavors of the dishes were good, but only after some doctoring and one of us couldn't even do that until the kochujang arrived.\n\nAfter all the reviews I've read about this place, I just can't imagine that this was a typical experience and I think sitting in that back room contributed to my general unhappiness.\n\nIn short - maybe if I sat in the front area; maybe if my soup were not as watery and it was actually spicy; maybe if the kochujang came with the meal; maybe I would have had a better experience.\n\n2 stars for the 2 servers that were nice when they were around and for actually refilling my water once.", "author": "Kariz M."}

TWO stars because I was really hungry and devoured the bibimbab and tofu soup...and exited feeling bloated..but the other reasons as to why I would not consider coming back here:\n\n1. It is wayyyyyyyy overpriced. the tofu soups all are priced around $10.68, the kimchi or seafood pancakes are priced around $18, the korean bbq bulgogi or galbi dinner plate cost around $20, and the bibimbab (rice mixed with hot paste and vegetables and your choice of either seafood, beef, pork, etc) cost around $15. They do give you a generous portion, but I know I can find better places that are not as costly, especially for their quality of service, which brings me to the next point.\n\n2. Their service SUCKED. We ordered our food and we were given just a few side dishes. I don't know if it's because I'm from Los Angeles and have been to many quality korean restaurants, but this place did not even impress me with their side dishes. They gave a few slices of bland kimchi, some cucumbers, anchovie, radish kimchi, and bean sprouts. Usuallly I'd get about 5-10 more side dishes considering I was with three other people. We also ordered two tofu soups and three bibimbabs, and when our tofu soups were served, they forgot to give us RICE. I had to ask more than once for some rice. And to top it all off I found a piece of hair in my tofu soup!!!!!! BLEKKKKK. I took it out, pretended that I didn't see that because I was so hungry and tried to enjoy my dinnner that i had been looking forward to the whole day. The tofu soup was not too bad, I've definately tried better. They also give you fried fish with the tofu soup. It was a little soggy and almost burnt...............after eating a generous portion of the bibimbab and tofu soup, I needed ice water, so i asked for some ice water, and they forget my request  AGAINN.

And, they give refills! We each got a small fried fish which was so good!

When ordering the dish, you pick the level of heat and what kind of meat you want in it. I chose spicy with beef. The soup contained a few thin slices of beef, soft tofu, kimchi and tons of chili flakes. The sizzling hot soup is served in a clay pot with a raw egg in which you crack open and cook in the broth. They also give you a side of short grain rice to put in your soup. The bowl of soup itself looks small, but once you add in the rice and egg, you'll be loosening your belt.\n\nI thought it was good, but I didn't see why this particular soup was on the 77 list.

Sometimes there's too much tofu and I don't get all the sips of broth that I want. The broth was a deep red color, with good heat for medium, and I noticed it tasted faintly like the style at SGD and Coco Bang. I'm guessing there are different tasting gochucaru flakes? Here, the broth was more balanced though, with enough complexity to satisfy me. \n\nThe quantity of small beef slices was sufficient, a good portion of button mushrooms, and they give you an egg to crack into the soup. My favorite way to eat the egg is to let it poach so I can eat the yolk runny. I also notice that once you mix the egg whites up into the broth, the flavor of the soup tends to diminish dramatically.

Either way, make sure that they make you rice toast soup! They'll pour tea into the hot stone rice pot, which will lift the crusty, toasty rice off of the surface. Let it sit and thicken just a bit and you'll get rice toast soup. One of my favorite things from my childhood and a great way to finish your meal.\n\nOne thing that drives me crazy: twice I've been seated near the entryway and it a little difficult to get tea refills (I said I like spicy, but I didn't mention that I'm weak). They'll start working their way toward you, but that pitcher always seems to run out before they get to my cup. And by the time they try again, everyone else has emptied their cups...so it's the same thing all over again. Grr. So I end up having to ask for a refill a couple of times each visit.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

If you have never had Korean food made in the hot-stone bowl style, you really should try it, especially on a cold day.

It's a monopoly and makes me want to open up my own Tofu House and call it \"My Tofu House Without Crazy Amounts of MSG and Affordable Kalbi.\"", "author": "S K."}

No, it doesn't have a huge screen display playing endless Korean Pop songs, and no its not located inside a garage, and no it doesn't boast a variety of flavoured Soju. So what's so special about this ordinary sit down korean family restaurant? \nTHE FOOD!\nWhen I crave good old Soondobu soup, and Haemul Pajeon (Seafood pancake) this is my go to place. I have tried all the tofu soups on the menu, but personally I enjoy the spicy Kimchi with Beef Tofu soup the most. Some of my friends say Arang has better soup, but I think this place is still the best. I am a bit conflicted to say which has better seafood pancake, this place or Toyose. They're both very delicious, and they don't skimp on the seafood (Yes Coco Bang-- i'm pointing this at you).\nThey're also generous with their Banchan or small dishes. There is this fried fish that they serve as a small dish along with kimchi and namul which I love so much! I swear, I think I can eat only that fish with rice and not eat anything else.\nI would also recommend the Kalbi. Juicy- sweet- tender- Perfection! They got this one right.\n\nI'd give you 5 stars if you had flavored Soju, but I still love you oh- so- much, My Tofu House!\n\nPS: Come during lunch time!

My coworkers and I waited a good 15-20 minutes for a table. Thinking that we were going to get some kind of special seating, the waitress started leading us into a strange hallway near the bathrooms. We were then seated directly next door to the men's bathroom in the weirdest stark white, windowless room. Think of it as a party room, but in a closet. We would have requested another seating arrangement if we weren't so desperately hungry for food. At the time, the menu looked pretty appetizing. Lots of tofu and meaty type things covered in grease and spices. I ordered the tofu soup and my coworkers ordered Korean BBQ. Our food came with a million and one side dishes. Everything was pickled or salted.\n\nI have to admit, it was all pretty tasty. Unfortunately, it's not really the kind of food that you could eat for an entire meal. After about 3 bites, I realized my tofu soup was nothing more than a brick of tofu cooked in spice water. My coworker ordered a red hot meat dish that looked like it had been marinating in chili for days.\n\nThe food was decent but this review is more about the service than food. As if having lunch and conversation in a supply closet wasn't awkward enough, the waitress came over and poured tea into our rice and left 20 glasses of water on our table. I just don't really know what to think about that.", "author": "Michelle N."}

He walked pass out table and a girl took our order instead.  She was very nice. We decided to choose a dish from each category. We got the kimchi soft tofu soup, seafood pancake, kal bi and the beef and veggie bibim bap. \n\nFirst the small dishes came out. We snacked on it as we waited for our meals. The kal bi was cooked perfectly, it was tender and not rubbery and tasted great. I really enjoyed the soup, it felt good to have warm soup on a cold SF day. The bibim bap was perfect, especially because I requested no carrots and they remembered to leave it out. The pancake was so-so, I have had better elsewhere.

It was 7:30 on a Wednesday night, which I assume is a prime dining time for San Franciscans.\n\nSo, my friend and I decided to try being patrons at My Tofu House again this past Wednesday at approximately 6:30, an hour earlier than the previous week. Luckily, this time My Tofu House was \"bare\" (not so many customers), so we were able to sit down and dine here.\n\nI had heard a lot about My Tofu House from Yelp reviews, but was never really drawn into the hype over it. To me, I find that I cannot follow hype over a place since then it'll set my standards too high for any one restaurant, which may ruin my impression of the place if my standards are not met.\n\nUpon first impression: service seemed decent. The servers were pretty persistent in trying to get our order in as soon as possible, which I found irritating since I was having trouble deciding what I wanted to eat. Chige or Bibimpap? Chige or Bibimpap....decisions, decisions. The menu was limited, like Doobu, but I suppose that's why the place is called \"My Tofu House\"; the specialty is...chige really. That's fine.\n\nAh, I was happy when my friend said that we would share our dishes, so I didn't have to make the incredibly difficult decision of chige vs. bibimpap. We ordered one of each....#2 chige and seafood bibimpap. The food came out quickly and both were sizzling (literally) upon receiving the dishes. Taste-wise; good, not great, not bad. My friend was so cute about the bibimpap since he hadn't tried it before....we both agreed it was good, especially with the bits of squid mixed in.\n\nThe atmosphere/ambience of My Tofu House--lighting was a little bright, so I assume they want the customers to enjoy and eat quickly...so they can usher in more customers. Not really a place to stick around and chat awhile unless you want to be a jerk to the people waiting....by the time we left the restaurant (around 7:30/8pm), there was a huge line of people waiting for tables. We made a good decision to go earlier in the evening! \n\n(But, now that I mention this, everyone will want to go eat at My Tofu House at 6/6:30pm from now on and the restaurant will become crowded earlier...)\n\nSummary: The place was okay, not mind-blowing.

They use the same formula that works so well for SGD and they follow it pretty closely.  The menu is pretty simple, just offering soon doobu, good bibim bap and yummy BBQ meats, and you get a number of kimchi dishes as appetizers before the meal.  You can choose original, kimchi, vegetarian, or seafood (be prepared, for better or for worse, for seafood with eyes), and you're given rice out of the stone pot in the standard metallic bowls, and eggs to cook in your soup.  After the meal (which I never finish and stretch into left-overs the next day), you're given the requisite melon gum to cleanse your palate and sent on your merry way.  \n\nIt's a pretty familiar routine to me, and though this place doesn't have the best soon doobu I've ever had, it's certainly the best I've had in San Francisco.  It'll definitely tide me over until unlikely circumstance takes me back down to Santa Clara again, and it's still good enough to get soon doobu newcomers hooked on the stuff.  It's not THAT hard-- the stuff is crack in a crockpot.", "author": "Mike O."}

I first tried the tofu soup while in LA at BCD Tofu House.  I left there not thinking much of it.  I gave it another chance at My Tofu House and was stunned afterwards.  Everything tasted so good and I was so full that I had to take baby steps back to my car.  Ever since then, I crave Korean Tofu.\n\nI'm actually heading down to LA so I'll be trying BCD again.  I hope it doesn't disappoint but I doubt it.  I probably didn't enjoy it the last time because I didn't know how to appreciate the flavors.

The tofu was silky and the broth and pork delicious.\n\nWe also had the seafood bi bim bap which was outstanding.  Served in a larger stone pot with the nicely crusty rice pressed into the base and sides and filled with mussels, squid, etc and topped with an egg poached by the heat of the dish.  Beautiful presentation and really delicious.  It could serve two people for lunch on its own but even with addition of the tofu soup a really interesting and filling lunch only set us back $23.\n\nOur server was very attentive and helpful.  When asked for a refill on one of the free sides it appeared right away.  \n\nThe room is nothing special but is clean and comfortable.  And they didn't hesitate to put the two of us in a private booth for four - some restaurants won't do that even when there's room.\n\nWhile I wish there were a similar Korean tofu restaurant close to where I live and work I'll glady travel out to Geary and 10th Ave again for this tasty and beautifully presented food.", "author": "Jon R."}

It was perfectly spicy and since it was a freezing cold day out it hit the spot.\n\nThey bring out kimchi, fish, and pickled stuff out first which were all good, but I didn't try the little fishes, they reminded me too much of my tetras. They bring out the soup which is literally bubbling hot. And a bowl of white rice that is crispy brown on the edges. Later they pour hot tea in the bowl and the crispy bits can be scraped off. \n\nSo yummy comfort food. On a side note, the tea they pour in the plastic water glasses is scalding hot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-05-16", "description": "This was my first time eating at My Tofu House. A friend had suggested going for dinner after a long day walking around in windy and chilly SF. I was definitely looking forward to wolfing down some sizzling/boiling food to warm myself up. \n\nFirst off, we had a VERY difficult time finding parking. It was a late Saturday evening and we were circling the area for what seemed like an eternity, looking for parking. No dice. Meanwhile, I was impatiently salivating at the promise of being served hot delicious morsels of food. Finally we found a spot a few blocks away a good 20 mins or more later. We ran towards the restaurant to get out of the cold wind.\n\nWhen we got there, the very narrow hallway in front of the door was  jam packed with many bodies waiting to be seated. I pushed through to get to the waiting list only to have this chick rudely swoop in to grab the pen just as I was reaching for it. She pens her name down and I follow suit  - there are at least 8 names on the list before us. I attempted to find a tiny niche to stand and wait, only to be told to move back by an employee, to give patrons more privacy as the waiting area immediately spilled into the diner's booths/tables. I will count their concern for diners as a plus. An hour later we are finally called to be seated and I immediately inform the server that we had already decided our order.\n\nHot tea is brought out in \"clear\" plastic short tumblers that looks suspiciously too light to be tea. I take and sip and yes, it tastes like hot water, not tea. But hey, at least it was free. Our order is taken and my friend and I order the same thing - the #3 seafood tofu, mine mild and hers spicy (fyi, there are 4 levels: not spicy, mild, medium, spicy). I can't tolerate spice well and since I was at what appeared to be an authentic Korean restaurant I decided to play it safe. The side dishes come out soon after we order and I have to admit that they were the highlight of the meal. The kimchi was perfect, quite spicy but in a deliciously tolerable way. I love anything pickled and salted so the anchovies, bean sprouts, cucumbers, radish and salted/fried fish were all good. Our tofu dishes come out still sizzling hot and I'm staring in anticipation as they're put down. I crack the egg over and start looking for the oysters only to realize they put in the wrong order because there's beef in it. Ugh. Disappointing. But I decided to keep eating anyway. I dig in and the tofu soup is NOT spicy at ALL, neither is it as flavorful as I had expected. I try my friend's spicy dish to compare and found barely any heat to it. Disappointing again. There was barely any meat, mostly tofu and I had expected more for the price of $10.05, but then again I guess it's SF. Meanwhile, rice topped with green peas and chick peas is brought out in a stone pot and scooped out for us. Hot water was then poured over the rice stuck to the bottom so we could enjoy the slightly burned rice. \n\nTo sum up, service was prompt but they messed up on our 2 simple orders. I can let that slide since it was obviously a busy night, but then again, I figure it's not the first busy night they've had. Food was way overpriced and I saw that the meat dishes were priced in the almost $20 zone which deterred me, but thankfully I just wanted something soupy. Maybe the restaurant had an off night, because I really can't see why this is the top rated Korean restaurant on Yelp, and in San Francisco no less. This can't be the best it has to offer. I'm no Korean food expert and I can't comment on the other dishes, but the tofu should be the easiest thing to get right and be cooked well. The 2 other Korean tofu places I've been to - Lee's Tofu in Fremont and BCD Tofu House in LA were far better IMO as far as flavor/taste.

Brother's (I was too drunk to remember)\n3.  OZ \n\nMy strumpet and I have a very complex system for picking out restaurants.  To be broken down from its science, it is basically I pick one, she picks the next and this goes back n forth.  Now this is just the layman's terms for it...it is quite more complicated than it sounds.  So we went to Tofu House , which was her pick and we went to also celebrate a fellow strumpet's new job.  Up to this point, all I knew of Korean food was kimchee and those cute little ribs b/c of an old roommate.  I ordered the Tofu Soup and because my buds cannot handle spiciness, I ordered the lowest level of hotness, much to the dismay of our waiter and friend.  The waiter exclaimed that the soup would literally be clear and like water...I told him my order was not a flub..I meant exactly what I said.  We also ordered some kalbi and my friend had a bibimbap bowl.  To highlight my ignorance, my girlfriend told me to drop my egg in the boiling mini cauldron.  I simply picked up the whole egg and dropped it in.  Everybody's jaws dropped, inches away from their own bubbling hot soup.  It had to be rescued and cracked in.  While I played it off to the best of my ability, I was quite ashamed.\n\nThe tofu soup was nothing spectacular.  It is similar to a tofu soup my mother makes except with more condiments.  The rice came in a cool clay pot, but tasted like.......normal rice.  The kalbi meat was pretty good but those damn rib like things are so small.  I hate sucking meat off bones.  The art of sucking is one I have not mastered and have no intention of.  The tofu house is not a place I'll go again.  It was not worthy of the heaps of phrase dropped upon it.

For the most part it can be super good, but there were occasions when it was just mediocre. \n\nI went there just a couple of days ago and noticed that they raised their prices. Ten bucks for tofu soup is definitely a bit pricier than the regular tofu joints. Heads up: the wait staff gets easily overwhelmed by the crowd.

Fresh, crisp, good, and free \"refills\" - yay!\n\nThe boyfriend always gets Tofu soup with Dumplings, spicy since he's Thai and that's what Thai people do, and I always get spicy chicken. It isn't on the menu but the chef is always nice enough to make it for us (: I'm not a BIG fan of pork and I'm grateful that they'll make something special! Of course, the waiters always try to tell me that they don't make spicy chicken but the line \"Really? The cook made it for us last time and it was so good!\" always seems to work. They know me by now, though, so I don't have to use that line too often.\n\nMy only complaint is that my little Latina/Japanese tongue can't handle all that damn spice so my nose is constantly running. I eat the chicken which is spicy, then try to cool it down with the cucumbers and rice but then my hashii (chopsticks) are spiced up which makes everything I poke spicy too...Boo! Here come the sniffles...\n\nThe help is quick to refill tea but it can take an eternity to get a cold glass of h2o. I always bring a bottled water in my purse and pour when they're not looking. If they leave the pitcher out, I usually walk up and pour water myself. Problem solved. I think they hate it when I do that but damnit, what the hell does a girl gotta do to get some freaking water!?

Plus they give you a fried fish, possibly mackerel of some sort?, as one of the panchan dishes. Yum!

The soon dubu (tofu stews) are so incredibly good here. The broth is rich and flavorful, and the silken tofu is the perfect consistency. And I LOVE the stone pot rice. The rice that gets crisp on the bottom of the stone pot really makes me reminisce on my childhood. If you want, you can also ask your server to put hot water in the pot so you can stir it up and eat the remaining rice that way, too. It's pretty good. \n\nI remember last summer, I took a road trip with a bunch of friends down to LA and couldn't wait to try the soon dubu in Koreatown. My friend's Korean friend recommended a place there, which I believe was a mini-chain, and the tofu really didn't seem soft and silky. The broth also wasn't as good as My Tofu House's. Needless to say, I was really sad and was crying inside for My Tofu House in SF. :( \n\nI'm not really sure why some Yelpers are complaining that the portions here are small - I think that the servings for bulgogi and soon dubu are pretty normal for a Korean restaurant. I always leave full and have leftover soon dubu, which is sad because it's never as good at home as it is in that stone pot in the restaurant.. I like the way the restaurant and the tables are set up. It's very clean and modern-ish. \n\nAlthough this restaurant looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, it's actually quite deep when you walk in, and if you come on almost any night around peak dining hours, there will be a bit of a wait.

At BCD, there's a tofu/kalbi combo for less than $20.00 but My Tofu House doesn't offer a combo so it nears the $30.00 for both.\n\nI always leave this place STUFFED...I'm craving it now.

The food itself was okay for me. and i've been to this place many times before. but the service i received from that male server was terribly bad. First of all, I've have to order my coke twice to quench my thirst while they were not even busy, and it took them 20 mins to finally got my soft drink!!! Secondly, i was asked to shut off my iphone volume while i was playing after-meal game while there were no people were sitting around my table, so i saw no point to ridicule me on that. i am not sure if that is their korean culture that your not supposed to have any noises at all, that is like asking me not to talk and keep quiet like i was in a freaking library!!! This is America, man!!! i am a paying customer and i am not doing any thing obsenced!!!  i've felt greatly humiliated by that stupid male server for doing that to me. Because i didn't feel like i was treating right as a paying customer, so i've decided to not give them any tip for the service. The worst thing, is that they charged me a tip by overriding my signature on my credit card receipt. Now i have to call my bank to deny that falsifying charge.......stupid and illegal move!!! if u want a tip, treat your customers right.....What i want to say to u, Owners of tofu house, u underestimate what i can do as a customer to hurt your \nbusiness such as writing tons of bad reviews on here and many more!!!  now u piss me off totally!!! watch out!! It is definitely not worth it to mess with me over a few dollars of tip that u eagerly falsified on my bill.  people, if u want to have korean food, go to Japan town. they have better service and honesty there.

Mainly because it's right across the street from my house.\n\nI am half-Korean, so Kfood is like comfort food for me. The good thing about it is is it's a pretty consistant, usually the only quality variation is price. Lots of the main meat dishes are served family-style, so the portions can be both HUGE and expensive. MTH has half orders of all their meats, which we were delighted to see because it was both cheaper and we would have room to order some delicious hot tofu soup we love as well.\n\nWe got the Kalbi, or marinated grilled short ribs, and the spicy warming kim-chee soft tofu soup. The smells reminded me of my mother's kitchen when I was growing up. Mmmm... We devoured it all with perfect hot sticky rice, cold kim-chee and pickled seasame cucumbers and bean sprouts done perfectly. I was sososo satisfied by the meal, and so was my boyfriend, who is completely new to Korean cuisine but is starting to love it.\n\nAlso, my dachshund puppy is thrilled with us because we saved all the little marrow-rich short rib bones for him to knaw on. Happy puppy!\n\nI think it would be beneficial to all 3 of us if we went there again! This is the type of place I'd bring my mom to.", "author": "Rosie B."}

I would highly suggest getting there before 7 pm dinner rush on fri and wkends, and albeit, I did wait as long as about 40 min before, it was definitely worth it! \nThe tofu soup is one of the best that I've ever tried. I always go for spicy, since it adds a kick, and the bowl they serve you is more than enough. Especially with the little side dishes and the bowl or two of rice to go with it. The staff serves you in a very team dedicated and efficient effort. I've never gone and received bad or poor service, even at their busiest times and that wins me over, hands down. I think my longest run going there was 7 wkends in a row. Only con is that the prices are a bit steep, especially for the meats when it is super thinly sliced. Oh, and I noticed that a lot of Asian restaurants, including this, serve ice water in little juice sized cups. I wish they'd upgrade to a regular 8oz glass soon.

I had lunch here a couple of days ago and wasn't hungry again until the next morning. \n\nFirst came an array of appetizers: spicy cabbage kim chee, some kind of pickled turnip-like vegetable in a hot tomato sauce, pickled bean sprouts, cucumbers in rice vinegar, something else I couldn't identify, a little dish of tiny salty dried fish in oil, and a small metal bowl of chicken broth with bits of meat and cubes of soft tofu bobbing in it. I could make a meal out of this stuff alone. \n\nAnd then came the bibimbap, spicy and sizzling and served up in a hot stone bowl like it should be. The rice at the bottom turned into a crispy crust just the way it oughtta. I couldn't finish the whole order, and believe me, I tried.\n\nI haven't tried the tofu stew yet, but if the bowls I saw being served up at other tables were any indication, that won't leave me hungry either. Need to go back and test this theory.\n\n\nUpdated 3/18 to note two things:\n1. I have now tried the soondubu and DAMN, it's amazing. The ultimate spicy comfort food. I could eat it twice a week. In fact, this week I just might.\n2. The menu changed in the last month or two. Boo: prices went up a little bit. YAY: more varieties of soondubu!", "author": "Fawn F."}

Sometimes, part of the wait for a table is the fact that the guy just hasn't found the time to clear the dirty tables or bring people their checks/change.\n\nAdditionally, the last time I was there, the health inspection form was posted, 100/100, not too shabby. Although, I did see some grossness that night, however this was from another customer. This woman pulled a Walgreens bag from her purse and packed her leftovers in it. No box or container for the food, just dropped it in the shopping bag.

But they give plates of broiled yellow croaker and that's always a winner.\n\nSoon dubu was solid. My socks were not knocked off, but they are in general on pretty tight. I got the seafood one and unfortunately they overcooked the oysters. Shrimp was pretty close too. But the broth was fairly rich and had decent body. I got the spicy but it barely stung the tongue.

Not at all what you would expect when someone says tofu soup (I don't even really care for tofu). It has the consistency of a soft boiled egg (ironic because you also crack a raw one directly into the soup), swimming in a hot, spicy broth. Yum! The banchan served before the meal is pretty standard, but good. And the entrees themselves are equally tasty.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nothing special. Which is inconsequential when your face is buried in the food. \n\nOh, and maybe most telling, I was the only white boy in the joint. Take that for what it's worth.", "author": "Billy L."}

I hadn't been for a while, and when I finally made it a point to go back last month it was a pretty disappointing dinner.  \n\nIt was a Friday night so the wait was about 45 mins.  The food smelled pretty good while we were waiting...just as I remembered.  I was pretty excited.  But when it came time to eat, the soondobu and bibimbap weren't that good.  \n\nThe soondobu wasn't spicy at all (and we asked for very spicy), and the bibimbap just tasted like sesame oil.  It was weirdly bland food.  Maybe it was an off night.  I'll have to come back here another time to give them another shot....but probably not anytime soon =(", "author": "chewy c."}

The other times, it was boring and okay. The waitstaff scanned the table every time they came to check on us and quickly refilled the empty banchan plates after asking us so perfunctorily that they really only asked as an informative courtesy, because it seems to be this restaurant 's policy to never let the customers go without a full assortment of banchan on the table. Some might think that this service is spookily attentive, but I am impressed.\n\nThe stews come out piping hot, and surprisingly quickly too.

I can still taste the food because some of the essence is slightly regurgitated back the cardiac sphincter of my overly stuffed stomach.  The tofu soup with eggs and clam (\"number seven\" on the menu) is served hella hot in a hella hot stone/clay bowl.  You can opt to have it white (not sah-pye-cee), yellow (mild), orange-red (medium), and red (hella sah-pye-cee).  \n\nI went here with Cindy and Bernadette tonight because we miss each other so much and we needed to catch up on boys and life.  The place was packed but we were seated within 15 minutes, so I was very pleased.  Granted this was the place which Cindy lost her Chinky card, Berna and I gave her a little shit for it... so she ordered her combo tofu soup yellow to appease us a little bit.  Bernadette got the OG tofu soup red.\n\nThere was a couple sitting across from me who kept smiling at me.  WOW!  This is probably what Ed feels like whenever his fans recognize him in public.  Could this girl possibly recognize me from my pictures on Yelp?  So I waved a little bit and smiled back...  But she didn't acknowledge me.... but kept smiling... and then laughing.   oh.  \nTIP:  do not sit directly underneath the plasma tv while America's Funniest Videos are on.  \nblah... I am feeling crunchy for waving and smiling back at a person who did not reciprocate the same feelings.  watch me retreat back to my shell of eternal despair....\n\n(It's okay, grace, it's okay.... you are about to experience some bombass food.)  \n\nThe waiters performed efficiently and quickly... First they laid out the different pickled munchies--the cucumber, bean sprouts, kimchee, some other cubed stuff, the small anchovies, and broiled fish--then gave us some of that bombass tea that tastes like boiled corn water.  That held us over for a little while waiting for our soups and spicy marinated pork.  When our server came back with our rice, Cindy straight up busted \"you're cute\" while giving him a dreamy look.\n\ndreamy look... meaning she was ripping his white shirt off with her eyes to expose his skinny Korean boh-day!!!\n\nBerna and I were a bit shocked at this ballsy performance, so we were just quiet and at the edge of our seats.  The server blushed and said something... I forget, but Cindy tried to play that shit off by saying \"Oh I didn't realize you actually spoke English\".  He maintained his professionalism as he evenly portioned our steamed rice, which is also cooked in a stone clay pot and topped with garbanzo and green beans, in our individual metal bowls.  He promptly refilled our tea as well.\n\nWe broke raw eggs in our soup, which added more thickness and body to our soups, which were EXCELLENT.  \n\nOur daeji bulgogi finally arrived in a sizzling plate, on top of onions.  Mmmm caramelized onions soaked in bulgogi marinade!   The pork was not drenched in sauce and grease (unlike the ones at Sorabol), which I really appreciated.\n\nOur bill came out to be about $54, including tip... so not bad, right!?\n($54 divided by 3 equals $18 each!)\n\nThe menu is straightforward:  various tofu soups, bulgogi, bibimbap, and drinks.  I heard the wait here is usually long so get here early and put your name on the list to secure seating.  If the wait is that long, try to ward off temptation from buying curly fries from Jack In The Box next door...

They turned their storage/break room into more seating for customers.  It's plain as hell in that back room and not as pleasant as the booths, but shorter waits for impatient people like me.  Be prepared to wait if you come at peak times, however the line moves quickly.\n\nI went with a friend of mine, and we ended up sharing my personal favorite, the boiling original spicy soft tofu soup with chicken, and some steaming hot bibimbop.  Bibimbop is basically hot rice mixed with vegetables and meat of your choice; we got it with beef.  With all this we were also given sides including cucumbers, bean sprouts, a fish, baby sardines, and of course kimchi.  The soup is super hot and will burn your tongue.  Munch on the sides and let your soup cool down.  The rice at the bottom of the Bibimbop is slightly burnt for that crispy taste.    They bring out the food super fast.  And they check up quite often making sure you have enough water, tea, kimchi, sardines and anything else you might need.  The tofu soup was excellent; the bibimbop and ribs are good but not spectacular.  Also when they say spicy, they mean business.  The sides are better than most other Korean places.  All this for two people for 30 bucks including tip.  And bring a jacket because its freezing cold when you walk out.  If you're still hungry or seeking dessert, there is a jack in the box next door.", "author": "Summit S."}

SO GOOD. The side dishes are great, love the fried fish and cucumbers. The kimchi sidedish is not that great, usually bitter and probably not riped enough. Other than that, the soup is good for cold, and rainy days. Almost everytime I come here, I have to wait, haha. Which means its a busy place, and great business. The servers are very attentive to customers' needs. They also accept credit card, which is a plus. I know probably most think its a little over priced, but you pay for what you eat. If you want cheap food, go somewhere else. I think its pretty reasonable. Plus korean food is pricey in general, and its because the dishes require a lot of ingredients and time.

Moreover, the ratio of soup to tofu and other solids was perfect for someone who likes soup but doesn't want the soup to be barren.  The tofu itself was very silky and fresh.

This is by no means a knock on their food, just an overall viewpoint. \n\nFirst off the food. There are numerous Korean restaurants in San Fran, but this is my favorite. With \"Tofu\" in it's name, this place sure knows how to make their signature item perfect. The tofu is so silky smooth, and the ingrediants compliments it to the tee. The soup is served on a boiling iron bowl, so it stays nice and warm throughout the dinner. The BBQ items are great too, you must try the ribs.\n\nThe Korean numerous side dishes \"were\" awesome, they have now reduced the number of side items for each table. BOO! It used to be 10+ items on the table, now it's half that. \n\nThe price is decent. The soup was $8.45 and ribs were $15(or so). But now the prices have gone up. Another Boo! It's inflation I suppose.\n\nOverall I still recommend this joint. It's by no means romantic, so it's more of a casual place to bring a date.", "author": "George H."}

I think that when you go to a tofu soup place the palate is easily pleased with the appearance of the stone pot and scalding, pipping hot red soup.  Yes, this is what you get here, and if this is all you want, this is what you'll get.  \n\nThat being said, I feel that despite the reataurant's name sake, the soup should be better than it is.  I mean, yes, it is tofu soup, and yes it tastes fine and pretty OK.  But it doesn't really make me pause and say, \"yeah, this is great tofu soup.\"\n\nThe OTHER FOOD - This is where I was more disappointed.  The other dishes are very lackluster and just seem to be something to be ordered for the sake of ordering, especially the grilled items (but why would I come here for these, right?).  The kimchee here is not very good either.\n\nAmbiance is pretty good, and is kept reasonably clean.  Service is fine also, nothing special here.  In closing, I think this place is a bit overrated.  You will get tofu soup that is a notch above decent.  I would go here only if you have a serious hankering for tofu soup.\n\nFood: 2\nValue: 2\nService: 3\nAmbience: 3\n\nOverall: 2.5", "author": "Michael L."}

We had the combination soondubu and the medium spiciness was just great - not too much, not too little, but as expected, medium. You'd be surprised how often you ask for medium and its too mild, or even hot, and its as if they just dumped in a bunch of sauce with no consideration for balance. The spicy bbq park was really good too - the meat was tender and spiciness was just right. This is a great place for lunch, as they have special prices for the bbq; dinner looked quite a bit more expensive. I would definitely come back because the quality is good, service is fast, and prices are very reasonable.", "author": "David C."}

If anything, the kimchi should be good, but it was meh.\n2) Seasoning -- I totally had a MSG reaction to the soup!!  It tasted fine going down, but it left me with a bad headache and thirst that only monosodium glutamate can.

The tofu salad wasn't too good. The tofu was firm and tasted a little strange, and the salad under it was any regular old salad. \nWhen the bi bim bop came along, I had the honor of mixing the oozing yolk with the steamy rice and veggies, which was pretty much pure joy. The bi bim bop was sizzling and mildly spicy, which is perfect for my taste buds (: Later I enjoyed the crispy rice that formed at the bottom of the bi bim bop bowl.\nI always enjoy the condiments/side dishes(?) that are served at Korean restaurants (: Neither of us had ever been served a whole fried fish before though (not to say that was bad. the fish tasted fine). We were also served strangely delicious hot tea. I wonder what it was. Friendly waiters frequently came by to refill our cups.\nFor two small girls, the salad and bi bim bop were perfectly filling and not too harsh on our wallets (keep in mind we're students).

It doesn't really compare to my favorite Korean tofu house in LA, but it's always satisfying.  I've been coming here on and off for almost 5 years or so, and have seen the slow uptick in prices and waiting time as it got more popular (from what I remember).  But the tofu soup, which you can order in mild, medium, or spicy, is solid.  Even ordering the mild for the first time (I usually go for the medium or spicy), I realized that the soup is still tasty when not covered up or overpowered by all the chili powder.  Bibimbap, kalbi, and bulgogi are great too.  The banchan is ok, and I like that it comes with the salty fish.  But I love the tofu soup the best!", "author": "Allison M."}

Soon enough, I realized that this really didn't matter: you can't make a mistake here and you'll have fun getting the flavors just right for your palette. The food was on fire-- in all senses of the word! The temperature was scorching, the spices were tongue shredding (even at medium heat), and the red colors in my soft-tofu ramen bowl were eye-popping. Everything stayed warm in the stone pots-- which is a huge factor considering you want to take your time and smell the kimchee here! If I lived in the city, they'd be seeing a lot of me. Since I'm just getting familiar with SF and didn't have a clue about the Inner Richmond neighborhood, I'm so very glad for Yelp!\n\nLucky for us, there wasn't a line until after we were already eating. I was also very pleased with the service and the fact that my vegan partner could enjoy a massive bowl of food here without feeling like a burden. They didn't seem affected by her request to eliminate the eggs in her bibimbap and quickly pointed out all of her options. Considering the short menu, four options was quite impressive. I must add that the portions were \"odd\" and the price tag threw me off a bit. The lunch to dinner price difference was staggering (upwards of 5-9 dollars).

This was good news for us because after we were seated, the restaurant quickly filled up. \nI got the tofu combo soup medium hot and my friend got the (classic?) plain tofu mild. The service is pretty spotty and we had to practice the stare-and-hold method on the waiters for our orders to be taken. The table next to us were more passive and they received their appetizers and placed their order 20 min after our dishes arrived - and they were seated pretty much the same time!\nThe appetizers were really fresh and good - crisp on items that should be (cucumbers, turnips, bean sprouts, etc.) and crunchy yet soft enough on the fried fishy. Our soups arrived hot and boiling in their respective clay pots. It was so fragrant I almost passed out from happiness - a perfect blend of kimchee spice and seafood saltiness. I've ordered tofu/seafood soups from other places where it was downright fishy (not good). I guess there's a fine line separating fragrant and pungent! \nAll in all I would love to come back to this restaurant! There are some large booths which appear to fit around 6 ppl just fine.

If you're going for a BBQ dish, I prefer the chicken over the beef (chicken is grilled with a lot of onions, but it's tasty; beef tends to be on the ever-so-slightly mushy side).  I tried one of those rice dishes (cooked in the stoneware) with seafood...I wasn't too impressed.  Service can be a little rough around the edges, but it's only because they're busy and short-staffed.  The servers are actually quite nice.

The latter dish being a rice-based concoction topped with meat, vegetables and bound together by a chili paste. Nice.\nBig picture, MTF moves to the top of my list for two reasons, its clean (God-forbid, there actually IS a clean Korean restaurant!) and the quality and quantity of the Panchan, or side dishes.

My girlfriend and I came here on a Saturday night, when it wasn't overly busy; however, despite the fact that there were open tables and no line at the time, it felt like the place was heavily understaffed, as it took us several minutes to be seated.  Overall, delays in service were particularly off-putting, as it took us ten minutes to get the side dishes and close to a full half-hour to get our food (nevermind that some people that arrived later were served before us).  This basically meant a lot of sitting around at a small table watching the line lengthen - the waiter barely even came around to add more tea (in about an hour and a half of eating, I believe our tea was refilled about...once).\n\nThat being said, the tofu was good; I got the medium Kimchi Tofu Soup, and my girlfriend got the mild Original Tofu Soup.  My medium was actually spicier than expected, which is exactly what I've been looking for at a Korean restaurant; as well, the quantity provided for the price was also quite good.  The side dishes, on the other hand, were not quite as good, with several being significantly more sour than we tend to prefer.\n\nOverall, based on the food alone, My Tofu House would get four stars; however, given the long wait we had (including five minutes for the waiter to come over and take our order) after we were seated and the overall neglect by waiters, I can't justify a score over three stars.", "author": "Benjamin L."}

Lastly, they also gave us a side of two fried fish, each one about the length and half the width of your hand. This was super tasty! Lightly salty, went great with the white rice.

Almost every time I've been here it's been packed, but there is a tiny room in the back for overflow.  Minus one star for a long wait because they don't take reservations.", "author": "Allison Y."}

The portions may be a little skimpy, but the quality of it compensates for it.  You also get a wide variety of side-dishes and rice, which comes in stone pots.\n\nWhether you are feeling under the weather, or just craving Tofu soup, this is the place to go.", "author": "Edward L."}

Then there's mild, medium, and spicy. What they don't show you on the menu is that you can take that spiciness even further, with 5 additional levels of spiciness after spicy. I started out at level 2 and it wasn't all that spicy. I did 4 and I was sweating. The last time I went, I asked for level 3 and I learned that the 5 additional levels of spiciness ARE NOT very consistent because the level 3 I got that night was much much hotter than the level 4 I had previously! It was a thick bubbling red paste that can only be described as lava-like, and it was *almost* painful to eat it.

I would seriously get a Korean soup here with tofu in it next time, because the tofu was seriously good. The bimbimbap is stellar also and one of the best ones I've ever had.  Portions are HUGE here (by the way)! But, a warning, most Korean food really breaks the budget in terms of price. It tends towards the pricey side for dishes, but the portions are a good size and you get little dishes of fermented and pickled goodness, like 2-3 different types of kimchi, picked bean sprouts, marinated tofu, etc. The beef dishes look and sound especially good but bring plenty of friends to share to split the cost!", "author": "Gina R."}
