I'll be honest, I walked into a trendy neon-signed omakase spot and couldn't imagine it would have the same authenticity of some of the other omakase places I've been to. The staff was so welcoming...shoutout to Erik and Joe for making me feel so warm as a solo attendee at the sushi bar. I think sitting at the sushi bar is an incredible experience because you really get to interact with the chefs and see them make your food.\n\nTheir nigiri was fresh and wonderful, but the flavor profiles and unique toppings and additions were a welcome treat. Definitely not your traditional omakase experience, but that's what I loved so much about it. \n\nIt's buzzy, the company is warm, hip hop music is lightly bumping, and it's just an overall great time. I got the $89 omakase and it came with about 13 pieces of nigiri plus 5 small plates and dessert. Definitely enough food for me, and an incredible value.", "author": "Rachel S."}

The interior is super modern and the music is bumpin' with hip hop tracks. The servers are decked out in their fancy hipster uniforms as well. They have a good selection of Sake to start. How it works is you tell the sushi chef how much you are willing to spend for your Omakase, which is a little weird. I would have preferred to have a set price as it makes it a little awkward when the chef ask you the range you want to spend. My friend and I opted for a $150 range. The more expensive of a range you choose, the more premium pieces you get. \n\nI was so happy that they included Uni in 3 of the pieces of the Omakase. Some standouts were the Aged Wagyu beef with shaved foie, Uni Spoons, and of course the o-toro! \n\nGreat place for date night if you are craving some non traditional sushi!", "author": "Daniel S."}

It's more modernized and mixes various flavors. They use a lot of uni and caviar so be ready for that. \n\nI personally like both traditional and more modern fusion flavored omakase, but this one is quite saucy and intense in flavor. Maybe because they use uni, caviar and truffle too much. They can use less of those and have more variety. By the end of the meal I was so ready to be done. There were a few pieces that really stood out, mostly in the beginning of the meal though. \n\nMy friend who recommended this place really really enjoyed it which is why I think totally depends on what type of sushi you prefer.", "author": "Rohenne L."}

All of the fish are premium stuff, come from different coasts everywhere, from Santa Barbara to Hokkaido, Japan.\n\nIt's fun to sit at the sushi bar, watching the sushi chefs slicing and torching - Robin's sushi bar is unlike most sushi bars of its kind especially because it's run by white guys.\nJoe, our sushi chef is very friendly and chatty and generous as well to add more of the shaved foie gras to the wagyu beef.\n\nIn my opinion, Robin is definitely one of the best omakase in the city.

Special shout out for a great omakase experience to Chef Joe!\n\nWe made reservations a week in advance, got seats at the sushi bar and the rest was magic. We probably spent 2 hours there, and left with a full stomach of food. I don't think I've ever done omakase and left feeling stuffed. Also, the customer service was great. My water glass was always full and someone came by to check on us.\n\nThe experience we had was about 21 courses, each plate decorated beautiful and delicated. I would have to say the fish was also really fresh! Just naming a few of my favorites:\n\nDiced asian pear with A5 Wyagu and Uni - hmm this was so good! The wyagu tasted like butter, just melts in your mouth goodness.\n\nLocal anchovy with charred Anaheim peppers - I would say of all the coarses, this might have been my favorite. Chef Joe said the anchovy is local from the Bay Area and just caught that morning. I usually don't like anchovy but his dish really shocked me!\n\nTruffle noodle salad - noodles made just perfect, al dente, topped with TONS of truffle\n\nStriped Jack with aged ponzu - first fish of the night, really fresh fish and a great way to start the dinner\n\nBaby yellowtail with a watermelon togarashi salsa - Another one of my favorites, the watermelon adds a great touch to the dish.\n\nI would say this sushi place is a must visit. A little steep on prices, but we were celebrating our anniversary, so it was ok.

I am well aware of it, but a part of me still believes that it's perfectly okay to have a $5.00 balance in my bank account. \nRobin is definitely different from any other sushi restaurants I've been to. They have hip hop music playing in the background, super chill and creative sushi chefs, and their bathroom floor is made out of pennies! \nDaniel took care of us that night at the sushi bar, and I really appreciate how he remembers all the names of the people he serves. He was knowledgeable, engaged, and conversational the whole time.\n\nHe asked me and my friend what our budget was for the night, and we said... LOL WHAT BUDGET? We did inform him that we wanted certain items in specific for our omakase and he was very accommodating. \n(Sushi bar = omakase.

This was a great combo, although I do feel like beef fat goes with everything lol\n-Tuna Tartare: the herb oil mixed into this was so delicious! Really aromatic but does not overpower the flavors of the fish.\n-Uni and salmon roe with uni whipped cream: LET ME TELL YOU. THAT UNI WHIPPED CREAM...hold on, let me calm myself. It was literally the best thing I've tasted all night. \n-Uni with sous vide egg yolk: the egg yolk made the uni SUPER creamy. The combo coated every spec of rice when it was in my mouth... omg...I just came a little. lol jk am I allowed to say this on yelp?\n-Aged wagyu with foie gras snow: I thought the shaved foie gras was just going to bring a hint of flavor, but I was wrong. It's packed with foie gras goodness and made me want to lick the plate clean.\n\nOverall, a great dinner! If you want to splurge a little, I recommend Robin :) They also have a wide variety of drinks, but ya girl lightweight so I had hot tea. Also, I left HELLA full, not sure if its because I ate 2 beard papa cream puffs and an egg tart before dinner or not....but you get it. It was a good amount of food.", "author": "Jackie T."}

We finally had to ask her to kindly leave and give us a minute because it was so awkward. She also didn't let us finish our food which was annoying considering the cost of the meal. A couple dishes still had fresh fish and she just came by and swooped it off the table before we could say stop. What kind of waitress doesn't ask first if you're done??

He did rave a lot about the sake more than he did the food and I should've paid closer attention!  I did go through two orders of sake myself and requested for premium sushi for my omakase tasting.\n\nThis weekend allowed me to score a lot of quick seating on the whim at many high end restaurants and I was able to get in on the omakase action!  I spent close to the max with drinks included because I was looking for that one heavenly bite.  They came close with the uni wagyu tartar but everything else was okay in my personal opinion.  The sushi bites were really small and I wish there was more fish to be devoured in each bite.  Like another reviewer stated, they drench their rice in the custom house ponzu sauce and I thought the extra acidity wasn't needed.\n\nDefinitely expect an expensive tab here.

We made reservations for dinner ahead which is necessary here as it is currently one of the hot spots of San Francisco.\n\nWe walked by as we didn't see it first. Thanks to google maps we finally found it. We walked In and what is very interesting: the place is surrounded by all windows and you see everything going on outside, yet it is private with the tinted windows (and that's why we first missed it!).\n\nWe got seated immediately even we were 15 min early. Chef Joe greeted us and we were immediately welcomed by several staff members and served with water and a warm hand towel. \n\nWe ordered a beer and a glass of rose. (Prices are in the menu photo I uploaded on yelp). \n\nThe omakase options are from $79 and up. We did not feel like ramen so requested to do only fish courses. The chef was asking several questions about preferences. \nChef joe served besides us also 2 other duos.\n\nThe food was excellent. Every single piece that was served was a foodgasm. Fresh. Light. Ecstatic. \n\nPrices are comparable for high quality sushi in NYC. \n\nPace of the courses was a little too slow. We were full at the end and got really tired  often from waiting a little too long.\nand even the food was so delicious, after 20 courses we had to ask chef Joe to end it for us soon. We did 3 more and I ate the dessert which was decent but did not meet the standards of every other course that we were served (that was perfection).\nSometimes the wait was too long and other times we got 2 courses almost same time.\n\nI read people did not feel full with the $79 option but we certainly were. I do understand you get that idea in the beginning as the pace was too slow, I was hungry too and certainly the first hour wanted the courses to be at faster pace:)\n\nBut this spot gets a 5 star either way. It's quality and high end, yet the ambiance is casual and fun. It is interesting the staff has all ethnicities. The overall vibe is amazing. And I love the old school hip hop music in the background, something you wouldn't expect in a place like this. \n\nThere is one unisex bathroom with nice napkins to dry your hands (yes I remember these lol). And there's a personalized note that was framed: so even the bathroom has character:)\n\nPeople were friendly, having a good time. Chefs talk with the guests and have a good time while they perform.

I made reservations 2 months ahead for 8:00 PM, but arrived a little early.  Thankfully, there was a table for 2 available, so we were seated right away.  We perused the drink list and ordered a ale on draft (for me) and a ginger beer (for her).  One of the servers informed us the price range for the omakase dinner.  As this was a special occasion (celebrating our wedding anniversary) and the fact we were extremely hungry, we went for the high end.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after we placed our order, the food started coming.  And coming... and coming... and coming.  One of the servers would bring a plate (as well as give a very detailed description of the dish, as well as from where the fish was sourced), we would devour the food, and then another dish would follow a couple of minutes later.  The dining room is small; maybe seating for 30 max, so we were in full view of the chefs preparing the various dishes; they could tell when we were ready for the next delicacy.  To be honest, we lost count of how many dishes they served us; it was a least 10.  The highlights included:\n\n5+ different servings of sushi, 2 or 3 different nigiri each time,\n4 separate dishes with uni\n2 different dishes with caviar\n\nThe final dish was the piece de resistance:  A5 wagyu beef with shaved frozen foie gras over sushi rice.  The foie just melted at the touch of the tongue and was the epitome of luxury.  This was the ultimate culinary mic drop... if it weren't for dessert, I would have just walked out of the dining room.\n\nBut before that, we needed something sweet to counteract all the savoriness of this meal.  Dessert was a small cup of white sesame soft serve ice cream with a black sesame sauce.  Not too sweet, but very rich and deep in flavor.\n\nOverall, we had the best experience at Robin.  All the staff were very friendly, answering all our random questions about the food.  While we did choose the priciest option, we felt we received our money's worth.  And though we had so many different dishes, all of them were on point... no duds in the group.  This is, by far, the best sushi experience in the Bay Area.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

They have a solid omakase that is super unique... think totally modern and a departure from traditional sushi. Sure, they have some more traditional pieces but they also serve sushi on a potato chip and sushi with tomato and basil.... what??!?? If you are into a more fusion and hip style of omakase, you would love Robin. In addition, Robin is semi affordable since they do their omakase on a sliding scale basis. You can get a meal for under $100 if you want. One great thing is that they also will tailor your omakase course to your preferences. So my boyfriend who isn't a fan of \"river\" fish got a lot of less fishy pieces.\n\nThat being said, I don't think there is as much food if you are on the low end of the sliding scale... and I don't think you would be very full. If I remember correctly, their pieces are fairly small... even smaller than a lot of other omakase places (also less rice.) In that way, I don't know that Robin's value is that great compared to sushi hon. In addition, I don't think the fish quality is as good as let's say wako or Ju-ni.

At the end of the day, Robin is a sushi restaurant. Even with all the other special ingredients, not having good quality fish undermines the overall menu.  \n\n[Dinner]\nI brought my mom and sister to the restaurant and we did not sit at the bar, which was full. It seems like you only really need a reservation to sit at the bar since the tables were pretty open. The really strange thing about the restaurant was the music choice. I wasn't expecting to be eating with my conservative Asian mother to \"Just a lil bit\" by 50 cent in the background...\n\nYou have the option of choosing a range for how much you want to spend between $75-120. We opted for the $120 each, to get the full taste of the ingredients. They served us three nigiri pieces at a time on the plate. You'll notice that many of the fish selections are locally sourced, and not flown in from Japan. Personally, I am more of a fan of traditional omakase, where the fish is the star of the show. I enjoyed trying different flavors here, and appreciate the inclusion of a noodle dish and foie gras as I was more full than any other omakase I've had. However, the fish just didn't taste fresh and was slightly chewy. For desert, there was a very yummy ice cream that I would definitely eat again. \n\n[Service]\nI really like that you can text the restaurant about your reservation. They are very accommodating and respond very fast. Also, they do a great job of explaining the menu. \n\nRobin is definitely the new hyped up Omakase joint in SF. I would say it's worth a try as clearly the team has put a lot of effort into opening the restaurant. However, if I had to spend 100+ on an expensive Omakase place, I probably wouldn't return here for second meal and would go back to Omakase, Akiko's or Ju-ni.", "author": "Alice Z."}

Maybe I've been spoiled by the quality of sushi available in Hawaii, but I really thought the price-quality ratio here was pretty bad. That being said, I have to give props to the joint for having rather unique presentations for the Omakase.\n\nOkay, so the star of the show is definitely not the quality of the fish itself (in my opinion). Lots of different sauces and similar jazz were used to create some great tasting and visually appealing stuff, but I never felt the fish was the main focus. It's definitely not your traditional-feeling omakase joint, as the chef's preparation area is set right in front of you with no barriers, allowing for a more interactive experience. If you are looking for a place that imports all their products from Japan, this is not the place for you. The portion sizes aren't very generous (again, perhaps Hawaii has spoiled me a bit too much), and left me desiring more (which is always an option, but might hurt your wallet a bit). \n\nIt's hard to justify sub $200 for omakase when it pales in comparison to omakase I've had for nearly half the price in Hawaii, but again that might be an unfair comparison. I haven't had the opportunity to try any other joints in the Bay for omakase, so I'll have to see how this place stacks up to them over time.", "author": "Brian L."}

The signature pieces are great but the more traditional pieces are not as good as comparable restaurants at this level (e.g., Wako, Kusakabe).  \n\nNigiri on the small side but they give you enough pieces to be full at the end of the meal. Good value for money and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a modern (non-traditional) take on Japanese fine dining. \n\nLONG VERSION:\nThe competition among SF's top Japanese restaurants is fierce - there are a lot of great traditional kaiseki and/or edomae sushi dining in the city but Robin offers a really nice and modern twist to this familiar experience.  You need to have an open mind to really enjoy what this restaurant offers and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the boldness of some of the flavors and the uniqueness of some of the bites in their tasting menu. \n\nThe evening started a bit slow for me (after ordering my ginger beer, I waited a good 25-30 minutes for my first bite and the manager offered to give me a complementary drink to apologize for the delay).  The pieces came as follows:\n\n(1).  Shima Aji (2/5) - This is sub-par in terms of the Shima aji I've had in SF.  I didn't think the marinade and preparation worked well here (I think too much yuzu). \n(2).  Yellowtail tataki with nori (3/5) - This was solid. \n(3).  Lean tuna with A5 fat (5/5) - A very interesting and unexpected bite. \n(4).  Nori chip with beef tataki and uni (5/5) - it's a very decadent bite and it's memorable.  They used uni from Maine which I didn't think worked well here (maybe I'm biased in favor of Mendocino or Santa Barbara or Hokkaido uni for such a bite).  \n(5).  Medium fatty toro with garlic pur\u00e9e (4/5) - really good. \n(6).  Kinmedai (2/5) - this is subpar relative to other kinmedai in the area. Maybe it's out of season. I think this could have used a little more sear. \n(7).  Baby trout (3/5) - nice piece of fish.\n(8).  Scallop tataki (3/5) - it's a nice dish to break up the nigiri pieces but the scallop got lost there. \n(9).  Sea bream (4/5) - nice preparation on this piece. \n(10).  Toro tartare (5/5) - this is another signature piece. The sauce at the bottom that just brings this all together for me. \n(11). Anchovy (4/5) - not commonly served as nigiri so I really appreciated it.  It may be too fishy for a lot of people. \n(12).  Uni nigiri (2/5) - Maine uni again and I'm not a fan of it. \n(13).  Albacore tataki (3/5) - solid dish. It seems they are using these as dividers between the nigiri sections. \n(14).  Caviar nigiri (3/5) - not a big caviar fan so this was meh. \n(15).  Spanish mackerel (3/5) - it's ok. \n(16).  King salmon (4/5) - I'm a fan of this.\n(17).  Cold ramen noodle with shaved black truffle and sesame (5/5) - great dish.  I wish they had used foie instead of sesame but it's still fantastic. \n(18).  Black cod (2/5) - this is not competitive with the miso black cod dishes in the area. \n(19).  Soy-marinated tuna (4/5) - this is a good piece. \n(20).  Amber jack (4/5) - above average \n(21).  Otoro with caviar (5/5) - another momerable bite though other restaurants serve this piece as well. \n(22).  Hokkaido uni (5/5) - just perfect. \n(23).  Miso soup (2/5) - this was meh, nothing special. \n(24).  Shaved foie over A5 wagyu (2/5) - this should have been the perfect piece but the foie completely overpowered the wagyu.  I don't think this is the best use of either ingredient. \n(25).  Shaved foie nigiri (1/5) - I wish they put shaved foie over some ikura (Ju-Ni's signature piece is shaved ankimo over ikura).  \n(26).  Black sesame soft serve (5/5) - I'm a big fan of black sesame and soft serve ice cream so this was the perfect dessert for me. \n\nService was solid and the ambiance is very Hayes Valley.  The chef customizes your omakase experience based on your budget.  I went with $140, which after ginger beer, tax, tip, etc. ends up being $200.  Given the number of dishes I got, I still think it's a good value. The nigiri pieces are on the small size but they clearly make it up in volume. I'll be back for sure.", "author": "Andrew S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-30", "description": "On a quiet Sunday night, we stopped by to Robin, one of SF's newest Omakase spots emphasizing locally sourced fish, new twists on Japanese classics, and a variable menu that goes from $79 to $179. \n\nOur group of 4 sat at a table and service was both friendly and accommodating, checking on us several times throughout the meal and wanting to make sure we got fish we liked (fatty vs. lean), dish styles we preferred (Nigiri vs sashimi) and got enough. \n\nThe decor inside is modern and sleek with a good energy and crowd though the music was heavy into hip-hop and rap. \n\nWe were told that we'd be full whether we chose the $79 or $179 option and that what varied was mostly fish type.  As we'd never been, our server suggested we go with the $79 base menu and add-on as we progressed.  All very reasonable and appreciated.  \n\nThe base menu consists of about 15 pieces served in about 8 courses. A few cooked items including a dashi onsen egg and sesame scallion noodles are also amongst them.  Signature dishes such as the Uni/potato chip/Nigiri and the A5 Wagyu/foie gras are also included. \n\nAs the courses came, it was clear we would need more food than the base menu and added a Uni course as well as a fatty fish course.  All told, we ended up at the higher price point of $140/pp.  \n\nSo how was the meal?  I think it's best to characterize as an up and down journey with several lows that I didn't expect at the price point and with the early positive reviews from Yelpers I trust.  A few big issues:\n\n- barely any reviews I follow mention the Nigiri size but I'll venture to guess that this may be a more recent trend. Judging by photos, the majority of the Nigiri we were served were half the size in terms of fish and rice (proportionally sized) than any Japanese restaurant I've been to.  Think of sushi at most places to be the size of your thumb.  The nigiri at Robin were the size of a pinkie.  On a few of the more premium items (Uni), the Uni Piece was extremely small and I've seen all the Instagram photos of their signature dishes to know what the full piece of uni looks like.\n\nOur fatty fish selection add-on was better with more uniform and better proportioned nigiri.  My guess is that our latter fish were prepared by the main chef and our initial Nigiri were not and I know hard core sushi aficionados swear by sitting at the bar and only being served by a certain chef, but I don't always have time for that nor do I think there should be that large a discrepancy. \n\n- the sushi rice left a lot to be desired. Initial pieces were under seasoned and kept falling apart. I've been spoiled by Sushi Yoshizumi's nigiri rice, but rice is important. Again, later pieces were slightly better but the first several rounds were such I asked the waittress to avoid nigiri and choose sashimi. \n\n- Sushi is typically room temp rice and cold fish.  On too many pieces, the temp of the fish was warm, which either means pieces sitting out after being made or are just a downside to table side dining (though I often sit table side).  Not a big deal at your local sushi place.  At this price point, yes. \n\n- prep consistency. Ordering for 4, you can see individual pieces and compare not just to people's prior visit but among ourselves. Two onsen eggs with trout roe and mushroom seemed to be completely missing the roe and mushrooms as it fell off the egg. Some pieces were seared halfway next to one seared nicely and some prep were similarly missing in side by side pieces.  \n\n- several items were just clear misses. The caviar (oh caviar!) on a potato chip with mayo (no, just no!) nigiri and the too strong sake tofu dessert were just not good flavor matches. The signature seaweed chip/A5 Wagyu/Uni also tastes great if proportioned right, but skim on the Uni size as in ours and you have a salty chip that overwhelms all the other ingredients. \n\nOverall, I wanted to like Robin.  I enjoyed the coverage on Eater.  I love sushi and locally sourced fish. I also like the high-end but reasonable $79 price point compared to all the $200 and up Omakase places popping up in SF now.  But I'll be honest, Robin seems to struggle to hit that $79 price point now in terms of our fish size, prep, and consistency.  If it's a Sous chef issue, than I hope they can clean house because what started out as a strong trajectory is already challenged 4 months in with more recent reviews being very mixed.  Count me in among that group.  \n\nRobin accepts credit cards including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

We went with the ~$120 omakase option, and I loved every bite I tried--even when they consisted of ingredients I don't typically love (e.g., while I typically avoid uni, Robin's was delicious, fresh, and creamy; the foie gras topped wagyu was not decadent for the sake of decadence but honestly very delicious). Finally, in lieu of a more traditional Japanese dessert, we wrapped up the meal with a savory white truffle soft serve.\n\nI went to Robin the very same week I went to the famous Wako, and I thought Robin was just as delicious in its own right. While it may not be the best place to take your parents when they're in town (mine would hate not being able to hear each other over the music, hah), it's great for anyone who can appreciate a more contemporary twist.\n\nHighly recommended for a special sushi experience in San Francisco!", "author": "Kelly R."}

At first, I was skeptical of the brown rice, the omakase menu, vinegar marinated veggie and fresh fruit bits...  and in general yet another new comer in the busy SF sushi scene. Definitely creative, uniquely American, there are some serious highlights: foie gras snow wagyu, exceptional service and friendly staff, \"cherry\" and \"gem\" like sushi nigiri pieces with colors that scream fresh. It's definitely refreshing to try.\n\nThe only minuses, perhaps still more sushi rice and less fruit bits. The wagyu and toro could be a bit richer.", "author": "Dilys S."}

They started off with asking for our budget. We ended up getting around $150 each and a bottle of sake. That's over 20 courses! Each course was delicious. The uni was fresh. I watched them take out several different kinds of uni from various places. This isn't your typical Japanese restaurant. Their food is Japanese with a slight twist. One of the nigiri came with a potato chip and caviar. Seriously, it felt like each piece of fish melted in your mouth. It's like heaven. \n\nIf you plan on going, I highly suggest sitting at the bar, being open with whatever you eat, and enjoy it.", "author": "Jackie D."}

Therefore my visit wasn't with high expectations. My overall experience was a 3.5 but rounding it to a 4 star because service was really good. \n\nWhat drew me to Robin was their \"signature\" piece and instagram worthy indeed. Who doesn't love Wagyu Beef and Uni? Should have been the perfect bite but it wasn't. The fillers inside the beef took over the taste of the beef and uni. I did feel disappointed because it was that piece I was most excited about. My favorite piece was their toro, melted in my mouth, with great flavor. More please! Also, they might need help with the rice because it doesn't hold up too well. My rice didn't break but I had to be slightly more careful when picking up my nigiri. In Japan, sushi chef takes up to 10 years to learn how to make rice. \n\nI started with $79 option because I wasn't sure how I would like my experience. My friend and I added two additional pieces to our meal. Totaling around $100 dollars for our omakase meal but without alcohol. My meal was good but isn't a place I'm dying to come back. Prices are reasonable because you can pick your price. \n\nI want to send a shout out to CHEF ERIC. He did a great job and a total sweetheart.

(Most parts are dirty/smelly and rent is expensive af -- what's not to dislike?)\n\nBut then, I took a short stroll in Hayes Valley before arriving at Robin for my 7:30pm reservation. And I thought, \"THIS IS THE CITY I KNOW AND LOVE!\" aka Hayes Valley and the areas far, far away from Market St/FiDi/SoMA. And THEN, as I walked through the doors of the restaurant, I noticed they were playing \"All Eyez\" by The Game and Jeremih. MY MOST FAVORITE JAM OF 2016... and in an instant, I caught feels again. Damn.\n\nOnto the actual meal! Laverne N. and I have been treating ourselves to monthly omakases, and Robin's was exceptional. We decided to go with the $125 tier (omakases start at $79 and go up to $179) per chef Daniel's recommendation, and we requested fatty fish and uni; we ended up consuming a satisfying amount of each!\n\nMy favorites were the...\n+ Seared golden eye snapper\n+ Sesame noodles with black truffle\n+ Otoro (duh, always)\n+ A5 wagyu with foie gras snow (inspired by j\u016b-ni?)\n+ Uni served 2 ways (Hokkaido and Santa Barbara, I believe)\n+ Toro topped with seared salmon, uni, and ikura (\u00e0 la carte item by chef Daniel that he had never served before!)\n+ Sake-infused soft serve (this is THE BEST POST-OMAKASE DESSERT EVER, IN LIFE)\n\nPortions were admittedly on the smaller side, but each bite was packed with flavor and the quality of the fish was phenomenal. The rice did feel a little crumbly at times, but thankfully didn't fall apart (phew).\n\nService from the chefs (Daniel and Joe) was A+. Service from our waitress was a C+, at best.

With these types of places opening up left and right, it's no wonder why Chef Adam opened up Robin. I understand what he's trying to do and the \"twist\" he puts on this cuisine to make things new and fresh. Innovative? Yes. Good? No.\n\nWe had 5:30 reservations on Friday and arrived at 5:20. The door was locked, which was fine since they seemed to be getting ready for the night. At 5:30 I was expecting for the servers standing around to open the doors, but that didn't happen until 5:37. I mean, you open at 5:30 so open the damn door by then. There were 4 other parties waiting at the door in the freezing cold. When they FINALLY opened the door we were greeted by less than friendly staff members (not all, but most). No apologies and no warm welcome. Strike 1.\n\nWe were finally seated at the bar and opted for an omakase experience in the range of $125 - $150. Our Chef Daniel was super friendly and incredible all night. He alone deserves 5 stars, but unfortunately, the fish and the rest of his peers made this a 2 star experience. We ordered a couple beers bottles which the servers poured, but these were the WORST pours I've EVER seen in my life. Remember those first-timer-drinker days when you pour the bottle in the cup with no angle? 90% foam, 10% beer (see below of picture). Yes, they did that. Rookie mistake? Intentional? I don't know, but this was strike 2. I'd expect a restaurant that has michelin rated pricing to know how to pour a beer. \n\nStrike 3 came around when a different server walked by my seat and knocked down my purse with her arm to the ground. She saw, she knew, but she did not apologize or even attempt to pick up my purse... instead she just walked away. W T F? Are you kidding me? Strike 3. At that point I was appalled by what was going on at this restaurant. Horrible service would be an understatement. Our water cups were not refilled and when our beer was empty for awhile, Chef Daniel was the one to ask if we wanted another one and waved down a server. Ugh. Does he need to do everything?\n\nOn to the sushi...\n\nSome of the fishes tasted fishy and the rice KEPT breaking apart... It was hard to even pick up a piece of sushi without having to scoop the rest of the rice with my hands. For a place that charges this much, I'd expect my freakin' nigiri to be intact until I break it up with my teeth!!!! The sesame noodles were super dry and bland. I could not taste the shaved \"truffles\" on anything. The soup we got at the end was also bland and I just did not understand the point of the poached egg. It made it even more flavorless. The uni spoons and uni/tori bowl were very good. The snapper was actually fresh and tasted delicious, but the rice still fell apart. Overall, the food tasted just \"OK\". Not horrible. Not great. But for the price? Less than average. \n\nI really did come here with an open mind, but left disappointed beyond words. You can't open up an omakase restaurant and charge the same as all the other establishments when you have way less quality and skill....AND HORRIBLE SERVICE! This place is sushi artwork gone wrong. I'd understand if the skill level and quality of fish was good, but it's JUST NOT. I like the idea of Robin and what Chef Adam attempted to do, but it's been poorly executed. You can pay half the price and get WAYYY better quality and exotic fish at Tsubasa across the street.\n\nI do love the interior and ambiance of this place, though.

Ok, so this is how the menu works.  Omakase or a la carte?  Omakase all the way...it ranges between $79 and $179 depending on how premium you want to get.  They'll also take requests and would love to know what your faves are.  We went with the $179 and asked for uni, wagyu, and fatty items such as toro.  \n\nNo joke.  We received 22 nigiri each, 2 different types of sashimi, soup, sesame noodles, and supposedly a dessert but their soft serve machine was down.  Instead, we were given shots of sake.  Don't be fooled by the size of the nigiri.  It's a ton of food and we left bursting at the seams. \n\nFavorite items of the night?  Nori chip with a5 wagyu, uni, and Asian pear.  It was unlike anything I've ever had before.  The combination of flavors just exploded in my mouth and I was in a sushi trance.  Amazing.  \n\nMy next fave was the a5 wagyu with foie gras snow and sea salt.  The a5 was definitely beautiful hear.

I wasn't aware of the sushi bar seating when making the reservation and assumed that sitting at a table meant losing out on the omakase experience. I showed up a little salty about the situation, but was pleasantly surprised that my assumption was wrong!\n\nEverything starts off with about how much you'd like to spend. My husband and I decided that spending about $100 per person was in line with what we were looking for. That came with a smattering of different types of fish and experiences.  From the beautiful salmon with a tomato on top to zuke toro to the truffle noodles, everything we had here was delicious. And beautiful! The photos I have from our dinner show that everything was presented beautifully! While service was a little slow to start off with, things picked up later on. I would say that for the amount of food we ate, neither of us were bursting from food. Being comfortably satiated is severely understated these days.

They won't take you without one. When making the reservation, they ask you to pick between bar and table. My boyfriend and I did a table, which was great and intimate, but we didn't get to talk to our chef and get direct feedback on what we were eating. I would recommend the bar if you're going with a serious partner and want the full experience.\n\nYou start the meal by telling your waiter/waitress how much you're willing to pay per person so they can put together your unique meal. Afterward, they just send you different dishes. I can honestly say that I don't remember the names of most of them, but they were very delicious and well flavored. I am not a big fan of sashimi; I prefer rolls but they don't do rolls at Robin. However, I still enjoyed it! They do a great job seasoning their dishes.\n\nI also really enjoyed how they cleaned the tables between each dish. It helped cleanse between each dish.\n\nSome minor negatives:\n-The red wine selection for 1 glass is very minimal. There was only one option that didn't require buying a whole bottle, and it was on the sweeter side, so I didn't enjoy it much.\n-It was hard to know when our meal was coming to a close. They only told us before our last dish in order to ask us if we wanted more. I would recommend they keep us updated throughout the whole meal so we know what to expect.", "author": "Remy B."}

Another SF expensive meal that was ...you know... pretty good? Happy to report that Robin exceed my expectations by far. \n\nThere's no sign out front, and I almost walked past the entrance. Restaurant is small (maybe 10 or so tables + sushi bar), and there's no place to sit and wait. Your full party must be there before they seat you.\n\nI've had omakase before, and I like that here the $$ is a scale, so you can tell the server how much you want to spend, what kind of fish you'd like, and whether or not you want certain foods. Aka, we started at their minimum ($79), asked for no uni, and come time for the meal to end, were so sad that it was over that we requested 3 more pieces of fatty fish to round out the bill to an easy $100/person. \n\nI forget how good high quality sushi is. It's. Really. Good. \n\nReally. Really Good.\n\n3 days later I'm still thinking about the meal good.\n\nI also like the small dishes that came in between nigiri.

I can't say it's entirely unique since I feel like SF is good at manufacturing cool, quality omakase spots, but their lax and adventurous approach to sushi made it really memorable. \n\nIf you're coming for an experience - sit at the bar. Chat with your sushi chef. If it's not to busy, learn something about omakase and the beautiful ingredients used. Our chef was sweet, funny and customized the meal to our tastes (we were pretty much open to anything but I chose to swap out the wagyu for toro) and price point. \n\nAnd let me tell you. We got SO MUCH MORE SUSHI than we expected at the price we chose (I think $120?). It was delightful. \n\nI never recommend sushi for a first date but the interior was beautiful, even sexy. \n\nOverall: I plan to go again soon and show up very hungry.

They prepare all the sushi in front of you and it is nice just learning about what you are eating. This restaurant seems to be marketed as an American-Japanese fusion restaurant rather than purely a Japanese one, which means that their toppings are catered toward an American consumer (e.g. sometimes they use cheese/dairy). \n\nIt was a very nice experience sitting by the bar. You start off by giving the sushi chef the price range you'd like to pay ($79-179) and they provide you fish within that range. The sushi was placed nicely on boards (but I don't know why they use the same cloth to wipe everything down...). I was definitely full by the end of it - at least 9 sushi pieces (I lost count...) for the $79 omakase. However, I have previously paid less for an omakase experience similar to this one. It could possibly be that my palate is not sensitive to the different sushi grades, but I guess I'm more of a \"bang for the buck\" kind of girl. \n\nGreat experience overall, no complaints with service either, but thought I could have spent my money elsewhere for a comparable experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-10", "description": "4.5 STARS\n\nAs we were enjoying dinner at the sushi bar, Chef/Owner Adam Tortosa was telling us about Robin's restroom. His friend said, he better make the restroom \"memorable\" but to not have a Japanese toilet because people would spend too much time in there. \n\n*Raises hand*\n\nThat would be me. \n\nI love Japanese toilets - they are the Bentleys of porcelain thrones. I know there's nothing sexy about toilets but sitting on a Japanese toilet and playing around with the buttons...keeping it PG: it's butt bootygasmic. \n\nNo butt bootygasms here but there were foodgasms!\n\nLast year, when I first read about Robin (FKA The Starling), I knew I had to visit. Adam is an alum of Akiko and 1760 both of which I loved so Robin was very promising. \n\nRobin serves progressive sushi so it may not be everyone. I love (and miss) the infamous Nobu K. on yelp but I can see him shaking his fists at the potato chip nigiri. \n\nThere's two menus at Robin: Omakase (Chef's choice available at the bar only) or A la carte (tables). Allot about 2-2.5 hours for the omakase. \n\nWe went with the Omakase which starts at $79 and goes all the way to $179 (for more premium ingredients). Tell the sushi chef your preferences. Our section preferred fatty fishes and the couple next to us came for the uni so we got tons of indulgent pieces with 4 of them being uni from different regions. \n\nFor the OMAKASE, we received a sashimi course, ~15 nigiri, owan, noodle dish, and temaki for $160 pp: http://bit.ly/2u5awge. No McD run afterwards so we left full. \n\n*SASHIMI: \n-Bincho Maguro (Albacore shoulder) w/ ponzu, radish, kaffir lime: http://bit.ly/2u56V1I\n\n*NIGIRI: http://bit.ly/2u5dQYI & http://bit.ly/2t5Fh0e\n-Salmon Toro w/ peach \n-Potato Chip, kyabia caviar, ramp aioli \n-Nori Chip w/ a5 wagyu, uni, pickled shallots, togarashi\n-Shima Aji, yuzu citrus\n-Okoge (?) and its liver\n-Akami (Bluefin tuna shoulder, HI) w/ 2 year aged soy sauce \n-Akami (Bluefin tuna shoulder, Japan)\n-Chu-toro \n-King Sake Toro w/ confit tomato, basil, whipped tofu \n-Uni (Chile) \n-Amaebi w/ its brain and caviar\n-Uni (Fort Bragg) w/ egg yolk shiro dashi emulsion\n-Otoro (Japan)\n-Tai w/ finger lime \n-Seared A5 Wagyu w/ foie snow, lemon soy, HMB wasabi\n\n*OWAN\n-Onsen jidori egg, shiitake soy sauce, ikura, HMB wasabi: http://bit.ly/2sHNZSS \n\n*NOODLES\n-Sesame Noodles w/ black truffle, Japanese chimichurri: http://bit.ly/2v43IMW\n\n*TEMAKI\n-Toro & uni: http://bit.ly/2ua9dNY\n\nThe chefs use a blend of traditional Japanese methods and modern techniques/touches. Each nigiri had a good shari (sushi rice) to neta (fish) ratio and was the perfect one bite. The shari was nicely seasoned with akazu (Japanese red vinegar). The temperature and chewy texture was on point, and maintained its structural integrity when picked up. \n\nThe fish and seafood were pristine, uber fresh, and top-notch quality. The fatty pieces melted like buttah. \n\nThe contemporary accoutrements: confit tomatoes, basil, pickled cherries, yellow peaches, granny smith apples, whipped tofu, egg yolk emulsion, etc. may sound odd but the flavors and textures worked, and it made for a balanced bite. \n\nThey also let nothing go to waste using the [prawn] brain and [fish] liver as toppings - fatty and minerally (in a good way).  \n\nFAVS: \nThe most outstanding bite was the Nori Chip w/ a5 wagyu, uni, pickled shallots, togarashi: http://bit.ly/2tGtWpa The combo of uni + a5 wagyu was unreal - sweet, briny, luxurious richness. But, almost everything was a favorite, particularly the uni, toro, and a5 wagyu pieces.\n\nThe egg yolk shiro dashi emulsion crowning the uni is liquid gold: http://bit.ly/2tGhWUN! Ahhhmazing.\n\nThe FOIE SNOW atop the a5 is like Christmas in July except it doesn't snow in SF - it's ridiculously delicious: http://bit.ly/2t5v8kk!\n\nOK:\nI would have preferred the potato chip without the sushi rice. The sesame noodles didn't have much sesame flavor and lacked a chewy bite. \n\nLEAST FAV:\nThe Okoje was our least favorite because it was chewy (minimal fat).\n\nSince there's no tamago, all that was missing was something sweet to complete the omakase - fruit, ice cream, mochi, or jelly. \n\nRobin has a good curated list of sake. My friend who's well-versed with sake choose the Watanabe Yukimizake Niigata Tokubetsu Honjozo (glass - $12): http://bit.ly/2uIJBEJ and Sasa Iwai Niigata Junmai Ginjo (bottle - $88): http://bit.ly/2sI6jvk. Both were good but I really liked the Sasa Iwai for its smoothness. \n\nI thought Robin's urban vibe was cool especially with the hip hop music playing. Again, this may not be for everyone but the restaurant was comfortable and unlike so many new places, it's easy to maintain a conversation. There's 12 sushi bar seats (comfy stools) and about 10 tables. \n\nSuggestions: Add coat/purse hooks under the sushi bar, provide finger wipe (aside from oshiburi), and offer pickled ginger.\n\nOverall, great grand opening. Come with an open mind and you may enjoy yourself more than anticipated - even without that Japanese toilet!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

If what you're looking for is a traditional and authentic omakase experience/restaurant, this is not. In fact, my chef for our Wed night dinner admittedly said that he'd never been to Japan, and was only trained by someone who was trained by someone from Japan. Interesting. \n\nAnywho, this review is not saying they don't have good stuff. Hence, the four stars. In fact, their marketing and word of mouth game is real strong! Restaurant was packed w ppl waiting by the time I was heading out at 8pm. Made ressies to this spot on their opening day 7/6, for a ressie on 7/12 at 5:45pm. There's two bar seating times (that I saw) - 5:45pm and 8pm (you should always sit at the bar, esp when going omakase style). The ressies were super easy to make! \n\nAs for the food, there was an interesting mix of flavors (i.e. trout piece topped w basil and tomato, creating an Italian flavored nigiri...didn't love, but there were other mixes I did). I kind of liked that it wasn't necessarily a traditional experience, and Robin is basically serving an omakase remix haha. Their omakase dinner starts at $79, and go up and up, depending on how much you want to eat! \n\nChef Joe explained to us that the rice (which looks brown) isn't brown rice, but rather, made with red vinegar, and not the traditional white vinegar. I was surprisingly delighted by the change. Honestly, I've tried other spots who've done the same and haven't executed on this as well as they have here. It gave a great balance to the fish. \n\nAlso, no surprise, my favorite nigiris were obv the toro, hamachi and uni! Solid flavors. Inquired about their shipments, and they come in twice a week (typical). Chef Joe, again, did a great job of explaining each ingredient, whether it be locally or internationally sourced - seemed to be a good mix of local vs. international. The uni, which everyone has posted a pic of has an amazing egg salve looking topper, is prob the fan fav. Ending w a beautiful piece of toro from Japan is never a bad thing either. \n\nOne complaint I have is that there wasn't any reception (Verizon) for me to post my IG story or Snaps! First world problem, I know. How am I supposed to share?! Saw there was a Robin Guest wifi, and asked the host for it. He said he doesn't know the pw...okayyyy. Asked the waitress and she said it's not for public use...okayyyy, that's misleading. BUT she redeemed herself and came by a few mins later and said it is for public use and gave me the pw. PHEW crisis averted. But not before my phones battery was almost entirely drained frm trying to get some reception. So, FYI for my fellow Verizon users. \n\nAll in all, good experience. We went slightly over the $79 base and added two more pieces of nigiri to a total of $90pp. Not bad. I'd def return.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

People were pretty specific with their complaints, but I think a lot were in the early months after opening. By now they've clearly worked out any kinks in my opinion and I found the experience delightful. Food wise I'd say it was a 4 to 4.5, but overall it was a hands down 5 star experience.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1) Fresh fish baby! Every bite of Omakase was delicious, except for one - which I can't remember, so couldn't have been that bad. They do their best to serve local, but some of the pieces from Japan were out of this world. \n\n2) It's democratic...what's your price range for the night? Min $75-ish or max over $200-ish. This allows you to portion control too. We went for $100 each per chef's suggestion, and then ended up bumping to maybe $130 with a couple more pieces, but we were stuff\n\n3) Mix of traditional and newer takes on sashimi. Yes, the nori chip with uni whipped cream, the wagyu with shaved foie gras was unreal tasty, and not over the top, and again, the fish was just really, really good.\n\n4) The vibe - it's not stuffy, sure it's hipstery, but it was just a good time in there. The music was good, the chef and waitress were funny, nice and responsive. \n\n5) Epic Japanese beer selection and of course a healthy sake list. \n\nThere's so much sushi in the city that is so good, but you have to give it up for Robin for taking a unique approach, doing it well, authentically, and serving up great food and service while they're at it.

The night was looking up!!!!\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our night saddled up at the sushi bar, getting to watch the talented chef Daniel prepare our amazingly flavorful nigiri sushi. Each morsel was packed with so much flavor. The chef used all different types of sauces and marinades, from a tomatillo salsa to a black garlic paste, to excite our taste buds, while still keeping the simplicity and freshness of the fish front and center. \n\nAlso unlike lots of high-end Japanese restaurants, the ambiance/vibe was anything but traditional Japanese. Instead I felt like I was at an \"in\" spot, with some good jams kicking in the background and a clubby vibe all the way around.\n\nMy only gripe, the pieces of sushi were small.

My friend made a reservation for a Wednesday night at 5:30pm, and they couldn't find our reservation- that set the tone for the rest of our dinner. We were sat at a table initially, then moved to the sushi bar since the other party didn't show up for their reservation (we speculated later on that was probably our actual reservation that they weren't able to find). At the bar, our sushi chef went over the omakase menu with us: it starts at $79/person for 11 pieces of nigiri + 4 non-nigiri items. We asked him to let us know when we were about to hit $100/person. We tried:\n\n-Sequoia Junmai Nama Sake (325ml/$44, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-gQ_yUDjKKHc6nvZtKih2A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Very smooth, and the finish wasn't dry. I liked the fruity notes, and would get this again.\n-Local Long Cod Sashimi (w/Pistachios & Pomegranates, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=rRet15pPRFXQbROERsVUAg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Very fresh and the pistachios gave it a nice texture.\n-Lean Blue Fin Tuna w/Soy (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=H2bj86WEvFbUBxkapdz3RQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not good- even with the soy it was bland.\n-Japanese Sea Bream w/Ancho Chili Miso (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HFJhISyYAGQMbPr1V7TBzg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yuck- the ancho chili miso flavor was overpowering, and not good.\n-Crispy Nori Chip w/Japanese Beef & Asian Pear (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=bsjj9vh4dXgV0tX1qdoLkw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- the crispy nori chip was delicious and the beef nice and fatty.\n-Farm Raised Steelhead Trout (w/Peach & Soy, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=mHmiPLjMAzlcYPQxzlR15g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yuck- the peach and soy flavors didn't work together, and overpowered the trout.\n-Shima Aji (Striped Jack w/Soy & Horseradish, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SbPvvhj4yE2wlaGvBA8ORg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good- the kick from the horseradish was nice, and the aji wasn't fishy.\n-Golden Eye Snapper (w/Granny Smith Apple): Just ok, but the apple added a nice freshness.\n-West Coast Albacore Sashimi (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Lldqvg-M9FiizGl5Cy9lVg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Fresh tasting, and the soy gave it good flavor.\n-Hokkaido Scallop & Hokkaido Uni (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=IxzIpTz1VHav8v7LE7Zd-Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): One of our favorites from the night- both were super fresh.\n-Hamachi (w/Cara Cara Oranges & Serrano, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xni_SUTKZKr1OBHt3AinYw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good, but nothing special.\n-Soft Boiled Egg (w/Chanterelle Mushroom, in Dashi): Just ok- the dashi had good depth of flavor, but it was very salty. \n-Albacore Tuna Belly (w/Crushed Sesame Seeds & Chives, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1jYA6Um7nl-NFNICguxkxQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum, nice and buttery.\n-Chu Toro (Medium Fatty Tuna w/Black Garlic & Chives, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=xXNhldDBnyvo-CL7aCZSgw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yuck- the chu toro was totally ruined by the black garlic!\n-New Zealand King Salmon w/Confit Tomato & Whipped Tofu (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=zFSgZi1ErjuRzrscb1BQAg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This combination was too weird, since it tasted like a margherita pizza but with salmon.\n-Sesame Noodles w/Shaved Truffle (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iyfCq9IgwXKsnaXnUXcAfw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The flavor of the noodle was good, but reminiscent of Ling Ling potsticker sauce with sesame paste, and there needed to be more noodles.\n-Potato Chip w/Ramp Aioli & Smoked Caviar (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=AbLm3qDQu6Sqx_Fegxzv9A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Interesting concept, but there was too much rice for the super thin potato chip. I also couldn't taste the caviar.\n-Japanese A5 Wagyu (w/Shaved Foie Gras, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1wwEJgz3GNKs6wLf5FOz5A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Good, but the wagyu was a bit chewy and not as fatty as other versions I've had. I also wish that the foie was cold to give the flavor more contrast.\n-Sake Custard (w/Pistachio & Pomegranate): Gross. The texture of the custard was good, but it tasted like thick sake paste, and there was no sweetness. I also thought it was lazy to re-use the pistachio/pomegranate from the first dish.\n\nThe music was way too loud here, and it was hard to have a conversation. I'm not opposed to modern Japanese, but the combinations here didn't work for my palate. I also thought the pieces of fish were too thin. With all the other omakase restaurant options available in San Francisco, I won't be back here. Parking can be very difficult in this area, but there street parking options.", "author": "Amy D."}

You can appreciate it all, but got to say, I could have gone with a bit less sauce on some of the pieces. There was a few I thought where the fish was overpowered. Note, the rice is flavored as well. Something I am not used to but can see why it is pleasing to others. But the ones they did right, really surprised us and we really enjoyed.\n\nExpect the pieces to be smaller but flavorful.

I was nervous when I heard that there was going to be a more forward/creative omakase opening in the city. There are tons of omakases opening left and right and at this point, it's unclear which ones are actually worth going to. \n\nWhat I really appreciate about Robin is that the price point is something that the diner can adjust and it's a restaurant that has some extremely thoughtful flavor combinations and is serving up an omakase that's different than others. Just to be clear, Robin is an omakase, but it's not at all like your traditional Japanese omakases. The setting, the music, everything about it feels a lot more modern and young, yet the sushi served I thought was actually pretty decent. \n\nThis omakase is fairly customizable but after scanning a few reviews, I'm seeing generally the same menu, so it probably doesn't seasonally vary too much. We went with fatty fish and uni since that's what our group was most keen on. The omakase had a great mixture of traditional pieces, creative/progressive pieces, and owan (soup), and really creative non sushi pieces, and a noodle dish. I'm normally not keen on superfluous nonsushi pieces in meals but I thought the extra pure sashimi and the noodle tasted decent so I didn't mind. \n\nI generally don't believe going into the details of every piece especially when it's a changing omakase, so here are highlights for me:\n1. Salmon with peach - such a simple combination yet one that works really well and one that I've never had before\n2. A few of the white fish were topped with cooked liver that melted really perfectly onto the fish and added a really unique flavor profile that was also spectacular\n3. I really appreciated that despite the progressive flavors, chef paid homage to some more traditional pieces that I think just aren't meant to be messed up - eg a clean chutoro and akami or a clean spanish mackeral and otoro. Some things really should just be brushed with some soy and kept simple as to appreciate the natural flavor of the fish\n4. The rice here is an interesting mixture of both white and red vinegar which is unique relative to other places in the city. The rice complemented the fish really well. \n\nThere were a few misses in the omakase - but primarily in the form of one flavor being too dominant so whatever was the star might have been more hidden. Pretty minor misses holistically given how many unique flavor combinations the meal offered. \n\nOverall, a lovely new addition to the omakase scene in SF. I appreciate that diners can adjust the price and the contents of the omakase to their preferences and also how unique the pieces were. Definitely a gem and excited to give this a place another visit in the future.", "author": "Jasmine X."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-05", "description": "Very unique take on sushi -- not the typical Japanese flavor of omakase that you'd get at other restaurants like Kusakabe.\n\nThey play around with flavors like adding potato chips or raw egg to your dish. Chef was extremely friendly, told us what was in each dish and where it came from, and made small talk but in a welcoming way and not in a way that felt distracting or annoying.\n\nWhen you sit at the counter, they'll ask you how much you'd like to spend per person. Then, they craft the menu they give you from that spend. I believe the upper bound is $180, but you'll get most of the higher quality stuff they offer for ~120 anyway, so I would suggest not going higher than that.\n\nThe main reason I'm giving this a 3 star is because while the flavors were really unique, I didn't feel like it was mindblowingly unique. It was just different from what I was used to. I also didn't feel like the quality of the fish was as high as other restaurants I could go to for the same price. Overall, I'm glad I went to at least try their take on sushi, and I like the hip, SF atmosphere of the place, but I'll probably go back to Tsubasa or Kusakabe if I want omakase again.", "author": "Theodora C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-27", "description": "Out of all the omakase experiences we've had in SF (Kusakabe, Wako, and ju-ni), Robin was by far the most disappointing. \n\nWe came with 2 friends for dinner on a Saturday night. The first thing that threw me off was the smell - the second we walked in, I was overwhelmed by the fishy smell. Strike one.\n\nWe sat down to order sake - they have a decent selection, and we were happy with our choice. Now onto the menu; there is no menu. Our server said we just give him a price point between $79 and $179, and the chef decides what to serve. Ok, kind of weird. The only other detail we got was that they had 4 kinds of uni that night. We should have figured that getting the $179 omakase would mean we would get all the uni. That's how they get you with the price point. I get that uni is expensive, but even my girlfriend who loves uni said it was way too much. Not only did we get all 4 uni dishes, only 1 of which was really good, they served uni bits of top of 3 other pieces of nigiri. We get it; you think uni is the answer, but let me tell you: uni. overload. Strike two. \n\nThere were a few bright spots during the meal: the hamachi, barracuda, dashi soup, and salmon with confit tomato and Thai basil were really good. I really can't get over the uni, though. And uni with raw yolk emulsion is not good. Bleh. The pieces were teeny tiny, the rice was pre-dipped in something, and the knife cuts weren't very good. \n\nSo with sake and a few beers, our pre-tip bill was close to $1000 for 4. For that kind of money, you are way, WAY better off going to ju-ni. Lightyears better. Robin is overhyped and overpriced.", "author": "Anna M."}

Meaning, apart from having fresh, delicious fish, each piece was uniquely and subtly enhanced with ingredients like granny smith apple and spices. I'm not sure about the complaints i read from other about the pricing, because to me it seemed obvious that we were going to spend the amount we did, but maybe other ppl arent so great at mental math :)\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is modern but comfortable, our waiters were nerdy and informative but still cool.

Our waitress was extremely pushy about increasing our bill - in a way that was over the top and not transparent. My friend does not drink alcohol and said no to offers to purchase wine multiple times. The waitress would come back and yet again offer a different option to try to convince us to buy a bottle, which we politely declined each time. We then told her that we had a show reservation at 7 pm that was very close by, and that we needed to leave by 6:55. I have been to Robin before - it did not take longer than 1.5 hours, so I did not think it would be a huge burden to notify her at the beginning of the meal of our time constraint (we made our reservation at 5:30 and showed up right when the doors opened). Well, our waitress was clearly disappointed, and scolded us for not marking this in the notes when I made the reservation. So then we felt quite bad the entire meal and told her that we were ok with cutting it short if needed. When we discussed pricing of the menu, she told us she would let us know when we hit the $135 mark officially, but that we were free to tell her when we were full and did not want to order any more. We never received this warning, and at 6:50, I asked for the check, which I assumed was the signal that we were done eating. She said yes, she would bring it, then proceeded to bring us 3 dishes after that. She brought a soup, which we rushed to finish, and I thought was the last dish. But then she brought another piece of sushi (the wagyu) and at this point it was 6:55 (the time we told her we needed to leave by). We rushed that dish down. Still no check. She then brought a dessert and no check. By this point both my friend and I were pretty disappointed because we were being shoved additional food in front of us that we didn't even have time to eat, and my friend had requested a dessert ahead of time because we were celebrating my birthday. I asked the waitress what kind of milk was in the ice-cream because my friend is lactose intolerant, which she clearly mentioned at the beginning of the meal. The waitress was clearly annoyed with me at this point and hastily answered \"Its ice-cream, so yes it has milk in it\". I blew out the candle and left without finishing it.

It wasn't until the day before our reservation that I started reading the mixed Yelp reviews and got a little apprehensive. We are diehard omakase enthusiasts (not professionals) and it was hard to imagine a negative omakase experience, especially when we had loved Akiko's, Kusakabe, Hinata and Ju-Ni.\n\nI would say the best way to describe our experience at Robin is \"undisciplined omakase.\" There are both positive and negative takeaways from this. Positive: you end up with more interesting pieces that you haven't tried before, the chefs are super fun to talk to and vibe with, the decor is interesting and the music upbeat. Negative: you end up having to wait for a table even if you have reservations and there is no bar area, the pieces you try don't seem to be to the caliber of more established omakase areas in the area. Another negative is that they ask you how much you want to spend between $79 and $179 and although you will be full, what they give you for the amount you say seems very arbitrary. The items are not listed out on the bill so you really have no idea if the food you received corresponds with its correct value. Additionally you are generally served at the same time with the same items as the people next to you which initiates a very awkward \"well how much are you spending?\" conversation.\n\nWe elected to spend $120 and ended up with:\n-Lingcod with strawberry\n-Nori chip cactus and uni\n-Lean tuna\n-Sea bream\n-Shima Aji\n-Steelhead with peach\n-Scallop with liem and salt\n-Mackeral\n-Yellowtail belly\n-Yellowtail sashimi\n-Barracuda\n-Japanese sardine\n-Sesame noodles with shaved Italian truffles\n-Salmon with basil buds\n-Potato chip\n-Toro\n-Sea urchin\n-Wagyu\n\nAll in all I'm glad I tried Robin but I don't think it is to the level of other omakase restaurants in SF.

I arrived a bit earlier than le bf and was promptly seated, which was nice. We were told to throw out a price point per person (between $79 and $179). We said $125. We were then asked what some of our favorite fish were, and we told Chef Daniel what we liked and didn't like. We said we like fatty fishes, bonito and beef. We didn't get bonito which is understandable because of the season. We did get some fattier fish and beef.\n\nLe bf started with some sake which he liked, and I started with a glass of the sparkling rose. \n\nFor $125/per person, we got:\n1. Ling cod sashimi\n2.

The ling code sashimi for me didn't have much flavor at all, and as the first course we received, let me down on the inside. For the uni dish, there was just way too much stuff going on, and the uni seemed to overpower everything else making it not a very tasty bite. As somebody who LOVES LOVES LOVES her A5 wagyu, this was the biggest letdown of the night. I liked the shaved foie that added a lot of buttery goodness, but the texture of the meat was just off. Either the meat was bad or it was under cooked because when I bit into the wagyu, it was extremely chewy, like a cheap cut of meat (think flank). It took me about 2 minutes of intense chewing to be able to swallow my bite, and my teeth still didn't make it all the way through the meat. This is NOT what you want with A5 wagyu. \n\nSomething else that I also didn't really like was the pricing aspect. What really is the difference between $79 and $179? We basically got the same bites as the party next to us (except that we got 1-2 more additional pieces), but we don't know how much they paid. If we would have known what would have been served at the $179 mark, we may have decided to go for more, who knows. I guess I wish there was more transparency there. Also, having tried so many other omakase places around the same price point as the $125 that we chose, we didn't feel like we got the same value as other omakase places like Kingza or Hinata (although I didn't love Hinata). We left somewhat full, but I could have definitely gone for some Mickey D's afterwards (no shame).\n\nAlso, usually, when we do omakase, we are served a small dessert at the end, or get offered a dessert menu. We didn't get any dessert. Yet, in other Yelp reviews, I read that some people got  soft serve or sake instead of dessert. There is definitely some inconsistency with this. I was left craving some kind of dessert with not many dessert options near the restaurant.\n\nChef Daniel was an awesome person to have a conversation with. He was super nice and super willing to engage with you. He was more than happy to answer our questions about the decor, food, favorite restaurant, etc. You could tell how passionate he was about the food and his craft.\n\nWhen you come here, don't expect the traditional omakase experience. The food that you will taste here is more inventive which is good. Some bites were hits with us, and others, which let us down, had so much potential, but little things messed them up. They'll probably improve with time. Overall, I think we would come back at a later date.\n\nFun Fact: If you look in the bathroom, the floor is covered in pennies. I asked Chef Daniel how many pennies were embedded into the ground. He said $120 worth. Might be a good way to pay for your omakase.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

Like all the other reviews have reported, this is Omakase and thus you're kind of at the discretion of the chef.  First thing they ask is what kind of dishes/fish you like, then how much are you planning to spend.  I went with $99 and received roughly 15 dishes.  Oh man, the sushi was exquisite and had amazing quality!  The uni nigiri was perfect for me.  Even the dessert of vanilla sake ice cream was tasty.  Omakase may not be for everyone and was certainly pricey; however, I definitely enjoyed it but can understand that it's not for everyone.\n\nOverall:  Great dining experience with Omakase at Robin", "author": "Joe G."}

And it was amazing. The whole meal was a revelation of sorts because it made me remember the SF sushi bubble we're lucky enough to be in. In the past 2-3 years, upwards of 15 omakase restaurants have opened in San Francisco alone (not counting other parts of the Bay Area). And while all gourmet and exquisite in their own rights, none have stood out to me the way that Robin did. \n\nWe went last Saturday when Robin had only been open for about a week. We were seated at the sushi bar with Chef Adam, who told us about the omakase which cost $79-179 depending on our tastes and budget. I said I wanted \"All the types of uni,\" which happened to be 4 types that day, so ha. We ended up having 16 pieces of nigiri and 2 sashimi plates, along with other small plates and delightfully light soft serve ice cream for dessert. We generally had the same pieces of sushi as the people sitting around us (note that there is no set menu for omakase but it's probably easier to time meals together), save for a temaki at the end because we were stuffed.\n\nChef Adam's appreciation for and knowledge of sushi really showed in his preparations and introductions of each piece. It was interesting to learn about the sustainably farmed tuna from Japan that they import, and how each part of it is used. I think because Robin and its sushi chefs do not fit the mould or expectations of an \"authentic\" sushi restaurant from the get-go, they've decided to run with it and are thus granted the freedom more \"traditional\" places don't have. And as a result, they're able to come up with truly creative dishes that you won't see anywhere else. The decor of the restaurant, which is very artsy and tongue in cheek, reflects this as well.\n\nI don't usually do repeat visits (exceptions are ICHI, Omakase, and ju-ni), but I'm already looking forward to my next visit! \n\nAlso: Shout out to Michael for being an excellent ma\u00eetre d' :*)", "author": "Katie M."}

I felt like this place was so hyped it would get booked up super quickly. I also equally was very skeptical when I walked in because modern or fusion sushi isn't usually a thing I enjoy. \n\nHowever, I was EXTREMELY surprised and very impressed by the creativity, quality and price at Robin. The omakase starts from $79 but expect to spend somewhere around $110-$130 even if you're not going to add 'that many' additions. The omakase goes up to $179 which I think is actually pretty reasonable considering how many pieces you get. I think its something like 16 for the basic one which is really generous.\n\nI enjoyed many of the pairings although there were a few fish here and there where I didn't understand the fruit. I get that they paired each fish with something but in particular the cherry did nothing for the mackerel. \n\nThe atmosphere is very hip, and the service is good, I would recommend going to the sushi bar. It is a bit interesting to me that there was maybe one Asian person working in this whole place, but I am not here to say whether you can or cannot learn the craft and art of sushi  by being a particular ethnicity so props to Robin! I would definitely recommend going if you can. It isn't all omakase, you can also have an a la carte experience as well.", "author": "Lorrie M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-30", "description": "Truly impressed with my omakase experience at Robin!\n\nBut let's get this straight. Robin is not your typical, traditional omakase place. The decor, the food, and even the hip-hop music playing don't convey the sense that you're dining at a zen-like cathedral dedicated to the sushi arts. And that's what intrigued and motivated me to make a reservation to dine here. Those traditional omakase places are ubiquitous in the Bay Area. You can go to Wako, Kasukube, or even, you know, Omakase. I craved a place that colored outside the lines and challenged my palate with new flavor combinations. Also, reading the Eater SF article (https://sf.eater.com/2017/6/27/15733554/cost-open-restaurant-robin-adam-tortosa-san-francisco) about the struggles, stress, and hard work of opening Robin gave me newfound perspective of what it takes to build a restaurant.\n\nNow onto the meal. I got seated right in front of Chef Eric, which was a seat created for me because I was the first one to sit there since the restaurant opened a week and a half earlier. The sushi bar is where it's always at. You get to converse with the chef and see your food being created. Chef Eric admittedly said he'd be expediting the other guests orders while also serving my omakase meal at the same time. Usually, you'd want a chef's undivided attention but I understood and it was still good to relax, chat with other diners, and observe the environment. \n\nEven though Chef Eric was balancing other duties, he totally delivered with my omakase menu (and he makes some fantastic cherry kombucha). For $120 before tax and tip, I got 20 different nigiri/dishes (22 total, I repeated the king salmon with whipped tofu and confit tomato nigiri and the sea robin with mandarin orange and basil buds nigiri) and each were unique and pleasing to the eyes as well as to the stomach. Great value for sure! Keep in mind they DON'T use brown rice even though it may look like it. It's a rice that they incorporate Japanese red vinegar into which gives it that deceiving color.\n\nI loved the uni and A5 wagyu on top of the nori chip. 2 of the most luxurious and unctuous items piled on a thin nori chip! The A5 wagyu nigiri covered with shaved foie gras was amazing. The uni nigiri with egg yolk emulsion was a delight. The only \"meh\" one was the aka mutsu or Japanese sea perch, which I thought was a bit chewier in texture than I expected. To end the meal the sake-flavored soft serve with basil buds, pistachios, and blackberries was a refreshing and palate-cleansing finale. \n\nChef Tortosa has a fun space and a fantastic crew working there. Service was great as they refilled my water glass before it was empty and cleared any empty dishes promptly. I enjoyed the food and the overall vibe. There are going to be some people that don't understand what Robin is doing with their omakase, but I think most people will. Perhaps one of those will be the Michelin guide.

Inside is a youthful take on a California-style sushi bar with an elaborate patterning of rose and fuchsia ceramic tiles patterning the backdrop. \n\nRobin's omakase ranges from $79 to $179 depending on how much you fancy eating and the quality & rarity of ingredients you request.

They use ingredients such as Thai basil, preserved grapefruit, whipped tofu, potato chips, and incorporated them into their sushi dishes without overpowering the fish. The sashimi were fresh, and the sushi rice was cooked nicely. The sushi rice was already seasoned so there was no need for dipping the nigiri in soy sauce anymore. I like this method because often time you could dip too much and all u taste is the soy sauce or the wasabi. We didn't have the omakase, which started at $79 per person, but we ended up spending more than $100 per person for ordering a la carte, and we were not even that full. Eating sushi is definitely not cheap especially at this new trendy place but I think it's worth to try.", "author": "Sam M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-03", "description": "Food was a hit or miss:  The omakase started off really bad -- all of the white fish sushi was outrageously bland and unexciting. The worst dish was the ling cod sashimi -- ling cod is already a horrible fish to use as sashimi, but the fact that it was bland made it even worse. I've never been to an omakase where they don't serve fresh ginger either, so that palate cleanser was missing as well. \n\nJust when I was ready to write off Robin as another hipster, inauthentic, overpriced sushi place, my three favorite bites of the night came out: (1) the nori chip with wagyu + uni, (2) the hon hokkaido uni, and (3) the wagyu with shaved foie gras. Whether or not the wagyu was actually A5 Miyazaki was up for debate at our table (it definitely didn't have the texture of A5), but the flavor combination of the shaved foie gras and salt crystals was perfect. \n\nAll in all, if I had come in just to eat those 3 dishes (and maybe the blue fin tuna, as well), I would have been incredibly happy. No matter how delicious the second half of the omakase was, the beginning white fish dishes, however, were subpar at best and the memory was difficult to repress.", "author": "Roy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-31", "description": "I was super excited when I first heard of Robin and immediately made a reservation (was about three weeks out from when I set it) for a Saturday, 8pm bar seating for two. \n\nMy husband and I arrived at 7:45pm because we are prompt people and were told our seats aren't quite ready yet but will be shortly. They asked if we wanted any drinks while we waited but there aren't any seats for waiting. So they asked that we return in 20 minutes which would put it at 8:05pm after my reservation but fine. We return at 8:05 just to be told the seats still aren't ready yet and they apologized and asked that we come back in 10-15 mins. I leave for 15 minutes and return at 8:25pm and we're told our seats STILL aren't available! They assured that the diners they are waiting for will be paying soon.   Close to giving up on them but we drove all the way up from the South Bay so I persist but tell them to text me when our seats are ready. 8:47...they texted me at 8:47. Our seats were not ready until 47 minutes after our reservation. So I can preface that the waiting experience caused me to begin my one star yelp review.\n\nBut then I decided to wait it out and try the place and am now conflicted because we did have a great meal.\n\nWe were lucky to be seated by Chef Adam Tortosa who immediately apologize for the wait we had to endure.\n\nUpon sitting down, I overheard the two guys next to us talk to the couple next to them bragging about how they've been dining at the restaurant since 5:30pm.  The couple they talked to started dining at 6:00pm.  Well, if you're stuck with these type of loitering customers, I guess you have no control over when the seat becomes available.  So a part of me sympathizes with the restaurant because you have to be gracious to your customers and not rush them. Goddamn can some folks be more courteous as diners?   Our own meal which began close to 9pm had us leaving the restaurant past 11pm (so a little over two hours).  I guess now that they are at week three and see how long their meals may take in the bar seating, they need to be more cognizant on what times to have available for reservations to not cause this type of unfavorable mix up in the future.  A 47 minute lagoff is a bit unacceptable.\n\nAs for the meal itself, we felt we had a pretty above average/good dining experience.  Chef Adam asked us if we had any allergies or hated any type of fish (nope and nope. We eat everything).  Then explained that the omakase prices range from $79 to $179.  We advised that we would like to pay about $100pp (Side note, the same two guys that warmed those seats for over 3 hours overheard us then scoffed and made  remarks about dining here on a $100 budget.  Can some people not be condescending dbags please? Luckily they were finally done by the time we were seated to start.) \n\nChef Adam asked us what we liked (fatty fish and uni) and he was excited to say they have six different types of uni (and later revealed Uni is his personal favorite to consume as well).  He also assured that we would not leave the place hungry.\n\nThe next two hours involved us tasting some out of the box nigiri and sashimi combinations (salsa, apples, thai basil, etc.)  Nothing was offputting, and some were standouts.  His combos were complex, but meshed well.  We tried at least three different pieces with uni!  The A5 wagyu with frozen foie gras shavings to be saved for the last piece was certainly delicious.  We ended the night with their own made soft served sake ice cream.  It was refreshing and delicious.  Chef Adam frequently asked us how everything tasted and our hunger level.  We left feeling satisfied.  Not overstuffed full, but not starving.  I didn't go searching for any after dinner tacos like I feared I would have to. \n\nI also appreciated how Adam is very conscious of the fish population and serves farmed raised on certain fish and explains why and where his fish is from and for what reason.\n\nSome observation my husband had was that not each piece of nigiri were that uniform in size.  Chef Adam does a single finger press method instead of two so we suspect it may cause the rice to have a higher chance of falling apart.  I didn't really notice but a point my husband made I'll just add.\n\nSitting at the bar is omakase only (no ala carte) but it the best as you get to see your fish each made and explained by the chef.  Keep in mind, you're kind of at mercy of who you're nearby.  We sat most of our meal by the most humble brag, loud couple that could not stop talking about their jobs and connections, and was constantly name dropping to anyone nearby.  Made the dining experience diminished (but this is of no fault of the restaurant).\n\nIn the end (after the rough start) we did have a great meal and Chef Adam obviously shows he's trying to build something creative and conscious here.  I would return here in the future; though, I would hope the next time they have their reservation timing done better.", "author": "Kim D."}

It started to accept reservation last week and it's already became one of the hot spot in Hayes Valley. \nThis definitely is not the traditional sushi/omakase restaurant that you would encounter like Kusakabe, Sushi Yoshizumi, etc. The decor, the seating, the glassware, the utensils, are all very simple/rough contemporary yet very cozy feeling. Even the music is very hip, which definitely ties into the Hayes Valley vibe. \nThe omakase of the day was $89 for us, but in their menu show it could varies from $79 to $179. The course consisted of 8 dishes and they are all sashimi (felt more like carpaccio) and sushi courses, unlike other omakase restaurant which has some hot course and finish in soup.\nThere is no wrong or right in omakase, it's whatever the chef felt it's the best of the season that they want to offer. All the courses definitely felt fusion, the chef combined american/french style cuisine into traditional nigiri.\nNotable dishes that I recall were:\n1) Sculpin (white fish) with grapefruit and basil flower\n2) Roasted nori with wagyu tartar and uni from Fort Bragg\n3) a few fishes from hawaii (tuna, zuke-chutoro, and moonfish )\n4) torched wagyu nigiri with shaved frozen foie gras\n5) seabass with cilantro flower\n\nI liked all of them, it was an interested take on fusion sushi and I believe the chef did nail it.\nI wish there would be more bar seating but it is what it is. The dining room consist of mostly table for 2. 2 tables for 4 and some bar seating.\nI think they max people you can reserve at a time is a table for 4, and part of 3 or more must be seated at the table. Only part of 3 or less can request the bar seating.\n\nTheir alcohol menu is very vast too. We had a bottle of sake from Shizuoka prefecture. Which matched their sushi pretty well.\n\nLast but not least, do not come in here expecting the traditional, Edo-mai style sushi. But be open minded and see what the chef can offer.

We ended the meal at $132 not including tax and tip. The price point to me was incredibly high, because at $120 I should be really full.

I ALSO agree that pieces lacked consistency, some were small and lopsided, in others sauce to fish ratio was varying. The weirdest piece was a trout with this candied thing on top, way too overpowering and took away from the trout's flavor. In addition, my friend had some bone and cartilage in one of his pieces-- the waiter was apologetic and brought out a new piece for him. Unfortunately, the new piece ALSO had another piece of cartilage! A last mention is that they didn't serve ginger, so we were unable to cleanse our palate in between bites. \n\nThe space was really beautiful, albeit we had a bit of a fly problem in our corner table. Overall I loved the creative direction and risks that Chef Adam was going with, and I think the few hiccups we had hindered the experience a bit. I would love to come again in a few months to see how things have progressed.", "author": "Emily C."}

I wanted to believe that Adam Tortosa, the young chef with a vision could pull off a true omakase experience that went beyond the stringent traditions of Japan.\nRobin did not deliver. \n\nNgiri size is about half that of the traditional japanese size, where the fish drapes over the rice and rests on the plate. More 'grammable, I guess, but at this price point it starts feeling a little unfair.\n\"Innovations\" like foie gras \"snow\" on top of A5 wagyu are at best showy, and at worst, like the granny smith apple, just seem to be bucking convention for the hell of it. There's a reason that edomae sushi purists are, well, purists. I'm not going to begrudge anyone the right to use more than shoyu and ponzu, but course after course just started feeling like the dishes were designed first for unconventionality and appearance, with little attention being paid to the flavour profiles.\n\nRice.. oh, the sushi rice. It was passable, but for someone who pays so much lip service to the importance of getting the basics right and building on top of it, the sushi rice was very poor.\nThe ambience and vibe of the restaurant were quite interesting, and possibly the greatest success, but it's never a good sign if more people are talking about the decor than the food.\n\nThe best course was the caviar on top of a house potato chip -- something any line cook in any midrange restaurant in SF could deliver on, half-drunk and asleep. Course after course came out with the natural flavours of the fish being stepped on, possibly because the size ratio is so out of wack with the toppings.\n\nSave your pennies and go to Kusakabe instead, until Robin sorts out the kind of place they want to be. Until then, it's just artfully presented sushi for instagram posts, not people.", "author": "Israel S."}

Boy was that flipped entirely. I walked in and saw a familiar omakase chef standing behind the bar as ratchet music came blasting from the speakers. As always, he's super dope and down to interact with you. He genuinely tries to understand your palette and prepares what he thinks will amaze your taste buds. The other chefs were very welcoming as well and were really excited in sharing their experiences with you.\n\nRobin isn't exactly traditional when it comes to omakase. The menu explores many different flavors and creative combinations that leave you thinking, \"Wow! I would've never guessed these would taste great together!\" For example, we were served sesame noodles with shaved black truffle, wagyu with shaved foie gras, and salmon with whipped tofu. Despite the oddities, the courses never failed to impress. \n\nI can see how some people may be thrown off if they're expecting another Kusakabe or Ju-Ni, but I'd recommend all to come in with an open mind and be ready for an awesome meal. After all, omakase is about trusting that you're in good hands with your chef.

We are huge Omakase fans so we sat at the sushi bar. \n\nThe first sign that this was going to be a terrible dinner was when the sushi chef asked each person individually how much they wanted to spend. There was no menu and he just asked each person at the bar. Not only did this make everyone uncomfortable, but why is price more important than quality? My boyfriend and we're flabbergasted that this was how ordering was done at Robin. Don't  publicly embarrass your customers by asking about money! \n\nOur sushi chef had BLACK fingernails and cuts all over his hands. The same hands he was preparing our sushi with. We had to sit and watch his touch our food over and over again with cuts and disgusting fingernails. We were so grossed out we could barely eat. \n\nOn top of that, the chef kept talking the entire dinner, this was entirely unprofessional  and probably explained why he had so many cuts on his hands, because he was not paying attention. \n\nMost of the fish and ingredients were local, which for the price was very disappointing. We had assumed all fish came from Japan like most Omakase in the city with this high price point. Additionally, every single course of Omakase had a blob of citrus or tomato on top to mask the taste of the fish, which is the entire point of eating Omakase. \n\nThe portions were tiny and cut sizes varied from person to person, which is another sign the sushi chef was terrible. A solid Omakase has every piece of fish the same size!!! \n\nOverall this place was unhygienic, had an unprofessional/inexperienced sushi chef, and tiny portions that came with a huge price tag.  $270 for 2 people, not including tip or tax, for low quality fish and low quality chef. \n\nDo not eat here if you like Omakase.

Our server, who tried to help us, said that all the sake, for example, has the same amount of dryness. Maybe that was true, but it seems odd. Usually a sake program consists of sake with varying degrees of dry/sweet.

Not a huge hinderance but also not what I wished for. \n\nAs for the food, on the plus side, there were lots of innovative and highly pleasant new tastes that the chefs developed. On the down side, I think the execution was just sub-par. It was lacking the sophistication and precision and refinement I expect from Omakase at such a price point. \n\nAlso the fish generally seemed to be dry and worn out, not glistening and fresh as I'd expect from such a price point. \n\nThe dessert was really disappointing. \n\nThe ramen noodle dish with truffles was incredible. \n\nWe had lots of fish, and it was really up and down.

Prices are outrageous given that the nigiri is literally the size of your fingernail. We travel to Japan every year and know a bit about sushi. Over there the chefs actually instruct you to eat your nigiri in one bite, which can sometimes be a challenge due to the size of the rice and fish, but at Robin you can easily fit 3 items into one bite. You choose one of 3 prices and have no idea what is coming but can share your preferences with the waiter. Omakase, I get it. But when 75% of your items are uni and one of the two diners stated that they don't like uni that much, then it's fair to say the wait staff did not exactly take note and taylor their menu. Since I'm the uni lover I was looking forward to the unique variety that is being featured on the website. The waiter informs me that the special uni of the night consists of Santa Barbara uni (which is the absolute most common variety in CA) and one Japanese variety. Not very impressive.\n\nThe staff was awkward and dressed extremely casually, moreover, we were essentially waited on by 4 separate staff members.

I was used to traditional quiet omakase, where you trust your sushi chef and it's so quiet sometimes you hear a pin drop. However, I'm used to this calmness in these omakase because you are there for the food and to respect the omakase. When you stepped into Robin, you will hear hip hop/pop music and you will see the chefs are non-japanese. DO NOT let this impact your decision. Chef Adam knows what he's doing. Those who are curious can google on his sushi experience, but he really does know how to honor the fish, while bringing a new twist to traditional omakase. \n\nI love that there's a range of prices and you can truly interact with the chefs, letting them know your favorites and dislikes and they will cater your course to your liking, from $79 to $180 I believe. I told them there's no limit, because I really wanted to see all their top sushi! Frankly, at first the initial pieces had me doubtful of how the whole course was gonna go. My friend even wanted to bail. No, Chef Adam checked in with us and turned the whole experience around. He asked me questions, and I told him I love fatty fish and uni/toro (duh). I was really skeptical of the first few pieces because it had a lot of different toppings that I'm not used to on nigri sushi, some had fig and some had salsa/tapatio. I'm used to nigri that just has the fish and rice. But like I said, Adam listened to my feedback and when he gave me a scallop with uni at top, I was at a loss for words. It kept going uphill and he kept giving me fatty sushi AND everything had uni on top.\n\nI was in heaven. I might've shed a tear. \n\nDo not compare this place to your traditional omakase place. Robin fits perfectly in the SF scene and has innovated a new omakase modern experience. \n\nI can't wait to return to see Adam, as my near 20 something courses was only $130.

Perhaps I went on an off night but Robin failed to meet my expectations. I sat at the sushi bar and had the premium omakase and was almost turned off by the way the sushi chef sold it. \"Omakase ranges from $79 to $179 with $179 having more 'luxurious' ingredients.\" What a horrible sales pitch with the word \"luxurious\" enunciated in such a way that was just down right annoying.\n\nFirst course usually sets the stage for the rest of the meal. When the rock fish with kelp and ponzu arrived, my husband and I stared at each other. The dish was fishy. We begrudgingly lifted our chopsticks and as we ate a slice of the fish, we both scrunched up our faces. It tasted like it smelled...fishy. \n\nLuckily, the rest of the dishes helped to slightly offset the first blunder. The rest of the sushi was fresh and used traditional Japanese technique with a twist such as sushi topped with fig, grapefruit, tomato and basil or olive oil), which was unique and refreshing.\n\nService was mediocre for the prices they charge. My water glass was often empty, servers didn't come by to pick up empty dishes, my glass of beer was empty for 20 minutes before anyone noticed, and it even took them 10 minutes to get our first drink order! I understand they just opened but this isn't Chef Adam's first rodeo in opening a restaurant. Sitting at the sushi bar made me realize how chaotic their process was. Sometimes we waited ten minutes between dishes because our sushi chef was busy making sushi for those sitting at the tables, which made our dinner 3.5 hours long!!! That's like eating at The French Laundry!\n\nAdditionally, while most of the fish was fresh, knife skills and sushi making were definitely subpar. I had a few pieces of fatty fish that looked mangled and I cringed with the way the sushi chef just jabbed his finger into uni to make the sushi stable so it wouldn't fall over (it fell over anyway as the server brought it to the table). The same sushi chef forgot to put caviar on our spoonful of uni placed on top of shaved ice. Yep - we noticed!\n\nOverall, it just seems like a lot of money (I spent +$500 for manhandled food done with low skill). Maybe it would have been better had we had Chef Adam as our sushi chef but I won't be spending another +$500 to find out.", "author": "Remus L."}

It forces you to think about and agree with the table how much you want to spend for something you know nothing about. Dumb. Just optimize the menu for me and give me the choice to have a 10 course, 12 course or 15 course or whatever. We chose $79 with the option to add on later. We added on two pieces each which took the cost up to $104 pp!! Expensive as hell when you add a drink each @ 15/pp and San Francisco's ridiculous taxes and health fees. Ughhhh \n\nSecond, the fish was fresh and yummy but the nigiri were TINY. Rather than nice pieces of fresh fish over perfectly sticky rice, we got petite, stingy cuts of fresh fish over rice that wouldn't stay together and kept falling out in clumps. Not even Whole Foods pre made sushi has that problem. One of the courses was an egg in broth that was just ok and also hard to eat. The foie-Kobe role which is their signature was delicious. The fatty tuna add on was delightful too. But again, small stingy portions! The dessert at the end of sake custard was nice and light. \n\nThe atmosphere is great and the service was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-21", "description": "I would give this restaurant an excellent for food, but instead decided on a very good because the service and atmosphere were more very good, rather than the best experience I have ever had. I also read the other reviewer's review and we didn't have G's experience at all, the fish was beautiful and perfectly prepared.  So, I came here to celebrate a special occasion and we wanted to have sushi, omakase style, where the chef can choose the dishes; but they do have a menu and you can order off of it. Also, a few more tips to start off.  Yes, you should make reservations and if you want to eat at the bar, you have to specifically request that, but we didn't know that until we arrived so we were a bit disappointed when we were seated at a table.  Also, the omakase ranges from $79-179 and I wanted to know what the difference was as we went up in price - more dishes, more specialty ingredients, etc?  Apparently, $79 includes all of the best dishes but as you go up higher in price the chef includes more uni (sea urchin). I don't like sea urchin, so this was a no brainer, $79.  Then there is the sake, an entire menu of it, which is a bit overwhelming so just ask the waiter to explain the flavors to you and choose a price range and go from there.  We had a bottle of Izumofuji which was delicious.  So, the best dishes - the striped jack with aged ponzu (I've never had this fish before and it was sublime), the yellowtail with cara cara orange, and the wagyu beef with foie gras snow.  I didn't care for the fishiness of the fluke with granny smith apple, the potato chip with caviar has great flavor but my chip was soggy so that was a disappointment, and the egg broth soup with caviar was lukewarm and I would have preferred it hot.  All in all a very good meal and I would return.", "author": "Virginia T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-29", "description": "One of the best meals I've ever had.  The meal is omakase style, so there's no menu. You just tell the server any preferences, and the price range you're looking for.  And then the food starts coming.  Quickly. We were surprised at how fast it came --it might have been offputting to people who wanted a leisurely meal, but I don't especially like to sit around, so it worked for me.  The fish is fantastic, and the rice is beautifully made, but what set it apart was the way they composed the sushi--each piece was fish + rice + some sorts of seasonings or added tastes (like truffles or miso or apples--really!).  The pieces are small enough that we were able to have a wide variety of sushi, and we loved it.  Numerous bites were so tasty that we had to close our eyes to take it all in.  It doesn't feel like a fancy restaurant in many ways, but the service was friendly and knowledgable and unobtrusive, and the food was outrageously delicious.", "author": "H A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-26", "description": "I think it's telling when the most memorable dish I had during my omakase experience wasn't even sushi. It was the sesame noodle with chimichurri and shaved Italian truffle (delicious, btw.)\nHowever, when I go to an omakase restaurant, I expect the fish to stand out. I get that the chef here is trying to do something \"special\" and unique with his flavorings, but a lot of them fall flat. (Chives were in at least 3 different preparations. Yes, THREE.) \n\nThe service was pretty atrocious for a restaurant where you're spending over $100 per person. I never once had a server refill my beverage without being prompted or ask me if I wanted another. The chef did ask how much we wanted to spend for omakase - I don't inherently mind it, especially since I understand that the prices of certain products makes it much harder to standardize a price. But when the guy sitting next to you opts to get the baseline $79 omakase and you do a mental comparison, and you realize he's getting all the pieces you thought stood out, then yeah, you wonder why you're paying $50 more. In addition, the chef was also unprofessional. He liked one of my friends and kept giving her the big pieces (he even said, \"I gave you the most xxx!\") and extra fancy toppings (extra foie gras shavings). Seriously, at least be subtle about it. (Although I guess then she couldn't be impressed that you're trying to cater to her.) And for one of the nigiri, he made a point to say, \"this is the most expensive fish on the menu.\" So tacky. \n\nFor dessert, you get \"soft serve\" which is really just ice cream they made but didn't bother setting in the freezer. It's much more melted than what you'd expect from a soft serve. \n\nSpeaking of the dude sitting next to me, he kept getting up to take pictures of the bar (he was dining alone and would get up to stand in the middle of the restaurant to take pictures). However, my friends and I were obviously in the pictures. He never once asked us if he could take our pictures, and the waitstaff never once asked him to stay seated or be more respectful. It just confirmed the total unprofessional nature of the place. \n\nI liked the modern ambiance, though. If you're thinking of going, my advice is to get the lowest level of omakase, take your Instagram shots, and don't look back.", "author": "Ingrid C."}

It's my first and might be the only time I visited Robin. I gave 7/10 for food, and 1/10 for experience. I fell in love with sushi about 2 months ago, when my frd told me the newly opened omakase place, I booked sushi bar seat right away. I was super excited about this visit. \n\nWe chose 120/per omakase course. It had 11 courses of sushi, which was pretty amazing. However each sushi was super tiny; most of fish were from local. However, for this price range, I would expect at least the rice should not fall apart. And when they do, I would expect sushi chef to clean it prior they serve next course. None of above happened. \n\nIf that's that my whole experience at robin, I'll give 4-star rating on yelp. However, what happened during dinner lower the rating to 1-star.\n\nWhen we seated, there was a couple sat to the left of me. They opened a bottle already, and later on opened another one. They were pretty loud when they talked. During conversation with chef, he asked, where else had you got sushi? I mentioned the last sushi place I visited was Sushi Ran. The lady, sitting to the left to me, laughed out, very loud, for around 1 min. (this couple did not have an active conversation going on, and were listening to our discussion). For next one minute, it was awkward silence. Yes sushi ran may be at a different level compared to Robin, but what's so funny about eating at Sushi Ran?? I felt very uncomfortable. I could barely finish my sentence after her laugh. And chef acted as everything was fine. At this point, I felt humiliated and became low in energy. \n\nThe nightmare began when another couple walked in, seated to the right to me and my friend. They were surprise to see couple on my left, who were apparently a long time friend. They were so excited  -- I understand people get excited when they run into pleasant surprise -- but they were so loud, as loud as greeting friends in a crazy nightclub. They started to talk over me for about a hour, till I left Robin. This was absolutely a torture. They were really loud and talked about why they didn't know each other went to\u00a0Robin\u00a0on the same day, plans about wedding, plans about honeymoon. I understand they were good friends, but in a relative high end place like\u00a0Robin (we spend 185 per person), I would expect we could have some privacy and space. I'm not interested in their private discussion at all, however my friend and I were sitting in the middle of them. Sushi chefs, waiter/waitress behaved like it's common.\u00a0No one ever came to us or offer us to seat some where else. \n\u00a0\nHey Robin, do you care about customer experience? Does ~200 bucks per meal suppose to have environment and experience as I described? Why does no one ever intervene? Truth to be told, in my opinion omakase at Robin is already overpriced -- I'm willing to pay for the premium b/c I expect this to have a good environment. But I didn't get one --I guess I'll never go back to Robin again.", "author": "Iris W."}

They are new here so maybe they can work on a few things but not sure if their pricing is forgivable for such a lack of finesse.  You can't just open up a sushi restaurant with some fresh fish and throw random ingredients on the fish and charge patrons $200 calling it omakase.  $200 can get you to Quince without wine pairings, a seating for 3 at Nico, an experience at Lazy Bear, sushi binge at Saru for 2-3 people, 11 bowls of ramen at Ramen Bar, a one way flight to Hawaii, a seating at our favorite michelin caliber pop up Correctly Seasoned with wine pairing... you get my point.  For 200 bucks you can get absolute quality and a full on memorable experience.  Their price point is ridiculous for what they actually represent and the chefs are not knowledgeable.  Couldn't even tell us what prefecture their A5 Wagyu came from.  If you are charging 200 a person you should at least know your ingredients.  Furthermore, you should not be serving sushi with the same hand you just wiped your sweat with... Thank God that was the chef next to ours... \n\nSushi is a combination of fine details, freshness, and delicate balance of all ingredients coming together.  You can't just put a bunch of stuff together with fresh fish and just call it sushi.  And yes... we are in a new food era and fusion is to be expected but even fusion... good tasty fusion requires a finesse n balance of quality ingredients.  It is a reflection of the person who serves it to us.  \n\nIf you want to charge Michelin prices then get a worthy Michelin star before you do so... and I say worthy is because I still don't understand how some of these restaurants get their stars during this whole michelin spawn the past couple of years.  \n\nTaste your own products before you serve it.  The uni was not good with that foul after taste... we had three different uni with them and seems they didn't taste their own stuff.  A cook or chef should at least know the profiles of their flavors.  Shouldn't be serving some of that stuff.  \n\nAlso need to do something about those flies.\n\nOh and it's probably a good idea to not have the sun blaring on the fish for a whole hour during sunset time.  \n\nThere was also a mishap with our reservation which they dealt with poorly.  Only when we were about to leave to go elsewhere was when they offered us the seating we originally reserved.  I don't know why they kept arguing with us but admitted they messed up and still didn't give us our seating when there was plenty seating available until we decided to go elsewhere.  Just handle it and solve it and tell us what you can do instead of what you can't do.  Especially when you admitted it was a screw up on your part.  Come on guys get it together seriously.\n\nYou don't always get what you pay for.  This is one of those places. \n\nLike I said though maybe they're just new and need time to figure things out and if they don't it probably wouldn't last long.  For me and my friends we all agree we're not coming back.", "author": "Colin M."}

The restaurant is really pretty but the smell that hits you when you first come in is almost nauseating, it smelled like some kind of antiseptic cleaning product. \nMe and my friends opted for the $145 option but it was honestly worth much less. All the fish were so under-seasoned that I had to order extra soy sauce to dip in. However, that's where the next problem comes in. THE RICE KEPT FALLING APART. It felt like they didn't use Japanese rice bc it was much dryer and thats one of the reason the rice doesn't stick together and fall apart. They seem to season their rice because it has a brown-ish color but that doesn't do much bc the nigiri in general is still bland. There was literally only 1 dish that was good. \nThe dessert was some kind of sesame soft serve which would've taste nice but they add some coarse chunk of salt throughout the ice cream so every time you bite into the salt it's just saltiness taking over.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-09", "description": "As other reviewers have stated, I wanted to love this restaurant but it's trying too hard to be something it isn't...yet.\n\nFirst, the positives:\n-The ambience was great...very hip and modern setting with great chairs.  It's a small space but doesn't feel crowded.\n-The wait staff was friendly...I appreciated how they offered to serve us drinks while we waited for our table to be prepared.\n-The fish and associated ingredients seemed to be quite fresh...my personal favorites were Ft. Bragg uni, scallop, mackarel and wagyu.\n-The sesame noodles and wagyu tartare were very good.\n\nAreas for improvement (for a restaurant that has such high price points):\n-Timing: The sesame noodles and tartare arrived within 10-15 minutes but the first set of nigiri took 20-30 minutes to come out and any nigiri we added on throughout the dinner took an additional 20-30 minutes or so to arrive.\n-Portions: The servings of fish were the smallest I've ever seen at a fancy omakase (versus Zushi Puzzle (SF), Ijji (SF), Kusakabe (SF), Azabu (NYC), Nakazawa (NYC), Kura (NYC), Uchi/Uchiko (Austin) and more).\n-Service: We ordered the mackarel nigiri in our first round of ordering...the server forgot about it (without admitting that she did) so that set came out closer to 45 minutes after ordering.\n-Consistency: We ordered a second helping of the mackarel, scallop and uni (4 pieces)...this set not only took at least 20 minutes to come out but the uni was obviously much smaller than our first set and the egg yolk was barely there and had clearly been cooked a bit....this was almost insulting considering the fact they're charging $9 per piece.\n-Point of Sale (POS) system: The pricing on our itemized receipt was different from the pricing on the menu...this is a HUGE issue but I didn't complain because the net amount was about the same.  It took us awhile to figure out that the \"Open Food\" items were actually our scallop nigiri that were definitely on the menu...not specials.  Finally, the words \"Service Fee\" on our credit card receipt were scratched out, replaced with a hand written \"SF Mandate\".\n\nSmaller areas for improvement:\n-While we waited for our table, we were served beer (good) that was served on the hostess station (bad)...I would suggest sourcing a small cocktail table or even a ledge to set drinks on.\n-Once seated, the server took our drink order and explained the omakase concept but left us without a la carte menus.  We had to notify her that we were not opting for omakase and requested the a la carte menu...she gave us one menu to share between the two of us. (?)\n-Music was a bit loud for such a small space...the acoustics weren't great so it was a bit challenging to have a private conversation.\n\nOverall, in addition to the fact that the restaurant opening was delayed because of some circumstances out of their control, they definitely rushed to open it.  The attention to detail isn't on par with other restaurants that similarly represent a high level of quality and dining experience...and because of that, the value just isn't there.  Our bill was $230 before tip for 11 small bites (tartare and 10 nigiri) plus the sesame noodles.  Completion of the meal took about 2.5 hours, of which probably 15-20 minutes was spent actually eating...we proceeded to eat dessert at Barcino afterward and were still hungry enough to make a Taco Bell run.  You can decide whether there is a value proposition here for you.\n\nHopefully, in a month or two they can work out the kinks and finally present a meal and experience worth the price they demand.", "author": "Marc A."}

They did creative things with some nigiris such as adding a thin peach slice over it - which ended up being good! We let our waitress know we liked Uni a lot and received an uni trio at the end which was delicious (3 diff types of uni). I really enjoyed the wagyu beef uni nori chip. Also, the rice they use is different - it's \"golden rice\" as it's marinated in some type of vinegar mix. I was skeptical at first but am a fan of this rice w/ nigiri.

We ordered a bottle, we were not in a hurry...so. no big deal.\nWhen it came to ordering, we were a bit confused because our server made it sound like we HAD to do the Omakase because there was 3 of us...Whatever, at this point we were hungry and didn't argue. Service was great. Very nice attentive staff.  Food wise? It was okay. Was it life shattering good? Meh!  Maybe sitting by the bar would've been a better experience.  For the amount of $$$ we spent, was it worth it?  I say this not because of the food, but the over all experience.  It was just so-so.", "author": "Gia C."}

This place would have me broke. Like, I'd live in my car rather than pay the mortgage just so I can go once a week. I LOVE the small little twists they put in their delicious morsels of love. Omakase is definitely the way to go. They even gave my 6 year old a mini version of omakase. She loved it. My wife and I got to partake in the $79 omakase which is very reasonable. I've been at other omakase restaurants in the city and you get a better bang for your buck at Robin. Thanks for the great experience Robin! Support this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-23", "description": "I had high expectations for Robin, based on the press and the reviews, but ultimately left quite disappointed.  The dinner started poorly by the host seating us over 30 minutes after our reservation, with scarcely an apology or a free drink offered.  Everyone was being seated late as the kitchen was clearly running behind.\n\nThe format is messy -- you are asked to choose omakase between $79 and $179/person but it is unclear the higher price gets you.  The assumption is that you just \"trust the restaurant\" but this was clearly confusing diners all around us and contributing to the slow service,  It is hard to name a price when you don't know whether that translates into higher end fish, or more courses, or what.  They should define three tiers and then clearly outline what each one includes.  The current format may work at the sushi bar but definitely not at the tables. \n\nThe biggest disappointment was the food.  At this price range, you expect impeccable sushi with tight rice and pristine fish.  Very little of our food fell into that category.  The rice kept falling apart and only a couple pieces of uni and one piece of toro, I would describe as superb.  The flavors also often clashed or were underwhelming.  It was very clear that you didn't have truly master sushi chefs at the counter.\n\nI know the restaurant tries to be a modern interpretation of sushi, but you can't just wing it at the high end it tries to serve.  We left underwhelmed and felt that the $450 we paid for two people (including one bottle of sake) was not well spent.  I'd rather go to Kusakabe or Kenzon in Napa -- for the same money you will get a truly spectacular sushi experience by highly trained chefs.", "author": "Alex S."}

First, they only have beers that are trendy (I guess)--no ordinary Japanese beer, draft or bottle.  Second, they use some kind of red-brown rice.  Third, they put all sorts of different flavors on each piece.  But gradually we realized that this is San Francisco sushi, a riff on Japanese (real?) sushi, and accepting that we liked Robin a lot.  The fish is very fresh and they certainly have a wide selection.  The wine was ok.  They use very little rice and it seemed to taste ok.  The stuff they put on is interesting and in many cases probably does augment the flavor.  Our chef was very nice, quiet compared to the chatty one next to him, and he seemed to know what he was doing.  The place is very noisy, a minus for us and we sometimes could not hear our chef's description of each piece.  I'd say the $79 omakase should be fine for anybody; lots of variety, everything tasted good, and they do give you a couple of choices even of expensive stuff.  With a glass of wine each plus taxes and tip well north of $250.", "author": "John C."}

My husband and I went for my bday, sat at the bar, and were wowed from beginning to end. Robin offers perfectly proportioned, thoughtful and tastebud pleasing combinations and a broad range of fish from all over the world, wagyu just how you want it, and fresh noodles to boot. With some guidance, we picked the $130 price range and loved every single bite they put down. We learned a lot too, thanks to our friendly sushi chef, Joe, who told us all about our dishes and patiently answered our questions. The servers were very warm, and the music (hip-hop) and decor are just my style and help make the experience more upbeat and casual than some of the stuffier sushi joints in town. Last -but definitely not least- the beverage menu is spot on. We split a sake pairing, which expertly mirrored the flow of our dishes.

Firstly, they blast (unnecessarily loudly) rap. It's aggressive, loud, and fatiguing. It's incredibly loud, and just.. out of place. Conversation is difficult and we just wanted to leave.  The place tries to hard to be a hip (club)? If instead it just focused on the culinary arts and cultural heritage it's menu nods to, this would be a pleasant experiment.

He was very intrigued by ingredients you wouldn't normally find on the traditional sushi. I would agree with him there but only one or two items really stood out. Mainly the wagyu and foie snow were the standout items. Everything else was fresh fish on rice. When we were trying to feel out whether it was worth it or what else would we get for the higher price tag, the waitress hinted some things but then we felt like it's still a secret. We ended up going for 130/pp and wasn't impressed so we stopped. This dinner was so expensive and although good (not amazing), I wouldn't go back. It was a great birthday but if you are considering trying this place, go in pairs and sit at the bar. It seemed like being in front of the chef was the only thing that would improve the experience.

Disclosure 1: I had the highest priced omakase and was served at the sushi bar (tip: always eat at the bar when eating sushi). Disclosure 2: While many of the nigiri is served traditionally, they do take some creative liberties with a few of them. Onto the review, Don't let the negative reviews fool you, Robin serves up some of the tastiest fish anywhere at a more that reasonable price. I had no expectation that this was a fine dining restaurant where they fold your napkins into elaborate origami when you leave the table, nor that they will offer a water menu that rivals their wine menu, nor a place where they offer you complementary champagne and coat check service...no, Robin has a minimal (but not sparse) drink menu, hip-hop/trip-hop music, clean aesthetic, and a neighborhood vibe. Oh yeah, did I mention the fish?!? Sure it could be cut more evenly and nigiri formed with more or less presses, but for me it all comes down to taste. All dishes tasted exceptional and to be honest, it's one of the few, if not the only place in San Francisco where you can try 5 different types of uni. I've had sushi from coast to coast, from Masa in NYC to all the places in SF (too many to name, but believe me all), and I can honestly say this will be my regular sushi fix.

This review is mainly for the owners in hopes they fix their issues as the restaurant grows. \n\nFirst off, the concept of the food is refreshing and by no means, \"traditional sushi\" as most reviewers have stated.  I agree.  But, if you are going to serve any variation of nigiri, please make sure the fish is cleaned properly before serving them.  I found a few hard fish scales on my last nigiri.  The nori on my albacore tuna handroll was chewy when it arrived, I assume it was not stored properly for freshness.  The A5 wagyu I was served was full of silver skin and it was hard to chew (I had to spit it out in the end).  Our order was taken at 8 p.m., I ordered 5 pieces of nigiri, the food did not arrive for 40 mins.  Many other tables were also sitting there stagnant without food.  If you know your kitchen is running behind, a heads up would have been nice in the beginning, not 35 mins after taking my order.  Perhaps something to tie folks over like edamame, or something easy and inexpensive that could be thrown together by the staff would be ideal. I also understand the kitchen could have fallen behind due omakase orders, but don't leave your other patrons hanging.", "author": "Tina T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-26", "description": "I was really excited for our reservation at Robin, after all it is an indubitably gorgeous restaurant. Unfortunately, the facade did sort of peel away quite quickly. Every dish looked great enough photograph, but lacked the finesse to actually taste as good as it looked. Each slice of sashimi was cut to a seemingly random width, with some pieces having sheets of fascia to chew through. The use of wasabi was inconsistent and confusing, sometimes overpowering and sometimes barely there. The rice was overdressed-- resulting in a mealiness that threatened to fall apart at the touch of the chopsticks. Things like the celery topping consistent of tough skin devalued the experience for me. That is not to say that each course was not at least palatable. The flavor combinations were interesting and the palate being sold to me is one I would definitely eat. However, sometimes I felt like all the pomp & circumstance (uni and A5 wagyu on everything) was covering up for just okay sushi. For the price that Robin is charging, I expected more of an omakase experience, rather than drifting in a sea of interesting, yet ultimately pointless nigiri.", "author": "Gordon C."}

Even though we were not able to get sushi bar seats and were disappointed, chef Adam personally came to our table to explain the selections. He made us the omakase with more fatty fish as we requested and it was out of this world. Initially, our waitress seem annoyed as we were asking a lot of questions about the omakase and she basically just wanted to give us the standard fair. Her annoyance was written all over her face even though I thanked her for checking with the chef. It was very awkward but chef Adam made it all better. We had fish from Japan, from California and truffles from Australia. The fish were perfectly selected, the creativity was through the roof. The value you get is also amazing. It came to about $120 a person only. We have had sushi all over the world including Tokyo, Kyoto and even close to Tsukijji market.
