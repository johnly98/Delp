So I first trip back in a while was not disappointing. \n\nTheir newer store allows them to offer many things including a couple of items that are vegan focused. We got a wrap and a plate that will both vegan and we're not disappointed. Their hummus and tabouli etc. are all top-notch. And despite the fact that many other well regarded Middle Eastern places cannot give you decent pita bread, these guys do a good job of me giving you soft pita which goes really well with the plate I had. \n\nAnd when I asked for extra they have no problem giving me another serving which gives them an extra star in my book!\n\nSo overall good pricing, great food, vegan friendly, and great people working there. An excellent option for a quick healthy satisfying food, especially when you're on the run.", "author": "Chris G."}

Sometimes they tell me their is double meat but I know it's not because the size of the wrap is the same as the Regular one. Also for being a chicken AVOCADO DELUXE wrap...I rarely taste avocado except for in 3 bites usually at the end. For spending $20 on a wrap with extra chicken, it just wasn't worth it.

I have been to pizza places that makes an entire pizza in front of you faster. \n\nThe wrap itself was insanely bad, I am not a snob by any means, but after 30min of wait time I expected it to be hot, it was cold in the centre, no not luke warm, cold. It lacked any quality that makes it a Shawarma, there was no taste of spice, doesn't taste of any camelization, the whole thing seemed like it came from a freezer, then microwave, then my plate. Forgot to mention, that there were about 4-5 people working behind the counter, there was no line, except people waiting for their food.\n\nCherry on top was that when I checked Yelp after, it had a warning pop up saying that this place was below the standards of cleanliness, horrendous experience, avoid at all means, I honestly wished I had just skipped lunch at that point, because I would only be hungry and not pissed off at such a sad excuse of a restaurant.", "author": "Eric W."}

It's definitely tasty and fresh, service has been friendly. Their hummus could stand to be a little more garlic & lemony but overall very good. I'm originally from Detroit where middle eastern places are everywhere. I wouldn't say Oasis is best ever, but it's definitely an oasis in the Bay Area which is pretty much a middle eastern food desert. Only knock is it's a bit pricey but so is everything in this part of the city.", "author": "Bob M."}

I read some  reviews from other Yelpers and agree with them that the service here is terrible. \n\nI came here for lunch. There was only 1 couple in front of me, but I waited at least 15mins. I almost turned around and walked out. But I didn't want to be rude. The cashier was rude. He didn't even smile. I thought it was me; but someone said he Never cracks a smile. Ever. So I won't take that too personal. \nThe other workers behind the grill smiled at me. I think the cashier Should be friendly if he is working the front. And also, they play their music\ntoo loud here. I like hip-hop music, but I don't think Everyone wants to hear that on blast. I feel like there are a lot of kids working here. \n\nI ordered the Veggie Mediterranean Melt. It was just ok. Nothing great about it. It was hard to eat because the sauce was very drippy. They didn't even give me any napkins. They keep the napkins behind the counter. I noticed other people where asking for napkins too. If you are going to serve Mediterranean wraps and gyros with the sauce, you really shouldn't be chintzy with the napkins. Just saying. \n\nI will not be coming back to this location.

But something happened to the mom-and-pop shop run by Mohammad Zughaiyir and his wife Muna Azzghayer. Success. They multiplied in a manner much like La Boulange, which started as a lovely little French bakery on Pine near Fillmore and turned into a very packaged chain. I had a dismal experience at the Oasis on Fourth and Mission because it appeared to be run by kids who really weren't paying attention to the customers since it took them away from their mobile devices. This location is more visible to passing pedestrian traffic since it's on one of the busier commercial stretches of Market, so they are much better behaved here.\n\nThe only challenge is that the server never cracks a smile. Ever. It's a bit distressful because I wouldn't mind a warm smile to go with my pita bread. But no, not gonna happen so time to move on. The familiar menu is on the side wall - mostly wraps, some signature plates, a couple of salads and some house specials that they state vary with the location (photo: http://bit.ly/1cKaPkb). On our initial visit, Jamie W. tried the $7.85 Falafel Wrap which was good-size and hearty eating with the falafel particularly flavorful with the right consistency (photo: http://bit.ly/1Kfpt1a). I ordered the $12.99 Kefta Kabab Plate which looked like an airplane meal from the 70's, a plastic tray with individual compartments that made me feel like I was in a prison cafeteria (photo: http://bit.ly/1L0CIzB).\n\nTheir version of kefta combines both ground lamb and beef and mixes it with grilled vegetables and places all of it over white rice. The other compartments contained a diced cucumber and tomato salad with yogurt sauce on top and a seasoned yogurt dressing bu itself. Isn't that redundant? Completing the tray was some hummus and some watered-down harissa. They give you a rolled up piece of finger-burning pita in foil to sop up all the sauce in that tray. It was all reasonably good but a far cry from the euphoria I used to have at their Drumm Street location. However, the new location offers surprisingly spacious seating and a clean restroom in the back. I've been back a couple of times by myself when I wanted a quick, non-controversial dinner before heading home. Still no smile though.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...wraps beat the plates but sometimes you want the whole meal\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...you can always find a table here\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...such a stern look\nTOTAL - 3 stars...as they multiply, Oasis Grill seems to lose a little bit more of its soul", "author": "Ed U."}

I've been to the Drumm St location but enjoyed lunch at the Market St location yesterday afternoon. As always, Oasis Grill did not disappoint. \n\nI went for my usual Spicy Chicken Shawarma, my cousin went for the Chicken Shawarma, and our friend chose the Shish Taouk Plate. I enjoyed my shawarma to the fullest extent - the chicken was tender and flavorful (and hey, it's halal!), the veggies were fresh, and the entire combo was well-wrapped up in lavash. Although this shawarma does not taste identical to the shawarma I've had in the Middle East, it is most certainly reminiscent of the real deal. And trust me, you'll be craving more Oasis Grill shawarma the second you're hungry again. \n\nAfter lunch, I enjoyed a slice of their baklava for the first time and it was SO good. Just enough flakiness, not too much syrup, and pistachios on top.\n\nI didn't get to order any falafel during my latest visit. However, I've had it enough to tell you that it is by far the best falafel that I have tried in the United States. I've spent a great deal of time in Dearborn, Michigan where the Middle Eastern food is supposed to be top of the line. However, none of the falafel there has even come close to Oasis'. It's definitely freshly made, not the falafel that comes out of a box mix. \n\nUltimately, this restaurant is a quick, delicious lunch/dinner spot and it's just walking distance from Union Square which is a huge bonus. Especially when you don't want to get back into your car and drive around to find another lunch spot. \n\nOverall, this is a solid Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant worth visiting and trying.", "author": "Sarah S."}

The flavor is there from the toppings but this lunch was not worth $15 (although you can't go wrong with an Izze).\n\nCustomer service was okay, the cashier I had seemed new so can't really judge; not fair to her.  What was really nice though, was that this place was super fast and I was in and out in less than 10mins for lunch.  So it's SUPER convenient, since it's right next to my workplace. They had plenty of seating and it seemed clean & open in there, they also had patio space to eat.

It's a great place for some good quality Mediterranean, especially falafel. \n\nFood:\nThe falafel wrap tastes fresh and delicious. So does eggplant pomegranate and vegan deluxe (which is eggplant pomegranate + falafel). Unfortunately, it doesn't have other great Mediterranean items on the menu like spinach pie and dolma while baba ghanoush is in the sides. Baklava is good and very close to the original one I ate in Dubai. Rest is all meat. But with limited options, the food is nice overall. \n\nAmbiance:\nLot of whiteness!! It's quite spacious as well. The arrangement is good but just that you need to go searching for forks, spoons, tissue etc as they are located in a secret area, not supposed to be found easily - unless you are purchasing something to drink. \n\nService: \nPretty okay overall. Easy and fast. They can be a little polite, if they try hard. In their Menu they mention the price of 1 Baklava piece but they usually sell it in a piece of two. When I asked for one, the lady mentioned that I need to purchase two since it comes that way. So, I asked why do they print the price of one when they can't sell it. It went on for about a minute until finally she gave up and sold me one, reluctantly. \n\nOverall, a nice place to have good food but try not to make the trip much interactive.", "author": "Jay M."}

I felt played, I really didn't want to return it because I no longer had any time, but I was hungry and I had tipped them. So, I call and try and be polite, and they said to come back and I'll get a refund, even though he seemed hardly apologetic over the phone. \n\nSo, I go in and make him search for my receipt that I left the tip on, which by the way was SIGNED BY THEM since I had forgot to, THEY SIGNED FOR MY SIGNATURE, pretty sure that's against the law.

I bite into the new wrap, and I BITE INTO CHICKEN.

I immediately spit it out and head back over to the restaurant, ready to throw it in his face, but as soon as I come in, he's explaining that there was a mix up, still he didn't seem too apologetic. He finally gives me a third wrap, which he cuts in half in front of me so that it has the right stuff in it, and I finally eat that for lunch, even though my lunch is far gone at this point.\n\n\nThe final/correct wrap I received was very bland and boring, super small and mostly bread.

The food is also pretty delicious, aside from one slight quirk:\n\nI ordered a spicy chicken schwarma wrap, which was tasty and seemed really fresh. But there was one issue: the spiciness was really uneven. I ate the wrap like a burrito, and the level of spiciness was a gradient: no spice at all at the top then gradually increasing to nearly unbearably spicy by the time I reached the bottom. The ideal level of spice was around the halfway point of my wrap. Either Oasis Grill should work on evening out the spiciness, or they should warn us to \"shake before consuming\" to spread out the flavor.\n\nI also ordered fries which were, surprisingly, really good. I would have given this place 3 stars but the fries bumped it up a star. Just the right amount of crispy and just the right amount of salty, these fries were fantastic. \n\nIf you get a spicy wrap, give it a few shakes first, and definitely order a side of fries.", "author": "Brittany C."}

We almost went to Super Duper Burgers next door, but I didn't really want a burger. My dad ordered a beef shawarma plate and a bottle of diet coke for himself, I got the chicken shawarma plate and a bottled water. The total came to about $33. \n\nSeating: Seating was good especially since we arrived at about noon. The place filled up pretty quickly after we ordered and sat down. \n\nFood: Our shawarma plates were delicious! I didn't really care for the yogurt dip or the cucumber salad or the red spicy sauce. The hummus was fine, but I expected the bread to be better, like Indian naan or something (shouldn't have expected that). The rice at the bottom of our shawarmas was great! I wish there were a way to order just the shawarma part of the plate and not the rest of the stuff. \n\nAtmosphere: The music soundtrack for the first 15 minutes we were there was the new Taylor Swift album 1989. I am not a huge fan of this album, nor do I hate it, so I really could've listened to something else, like Jackson 5 or Earth Wind and Fire (I'm a big soul music fan). Towards the end of our meal, a homeless lady came in asking some patrons near the door for money. The cashier had to come to tell her to leave if she wasn't going to buy anything. The homeless lady was compliant, although stepped out of the place and briefly stepped back in before leaving. The cashier who told the homeless lady to leave also apologized to the rest of the patrons for the disturbance.\n\nP.S. My dad was sitting faced away from the door, so he didn't see most of the incident, but after lunch, we went to Marshalls where I bought a four-pack of black socks for $8 to give to the homeless people in downtown SF. They appreciated the socks so much! I wish I could've given a pair of socks to the homeless lady who came into Oasis Grill, but I couldn't find her after Marshalls.", "author": "Di W."}

Finally gave this place a try with my friends one night after shopping in downtown. \n\nYou go to the cashier and order your food, then you get a number and you can choose your own table to sit at. I thought the prices were a bit on the pricey side (around $9-10) for shawarmas, but its downtown SF so not too surprising. I got the beef shawarma which was delicious- meat was flavorful, the hummus and the vegetables went really well with the beef. It was really spicy though (I believe the cashier asked me if I wanted it spicy and I said yes), and it made my tongue irritated because it was so spicy- but I powered through because it was so good. \nMy friend got the chicken shawarma which was even better than my beef one, and $1 cheaper, so I'd recommend that one! I tried hers and had entree envy, lol. The chicken was not dry at all (which is what I feared) and the tahini sauce was delicious (it tasted peanut buttery). I wonder if I could get that sauce on the side because it would've made my beef shawarma 10x better.

From the Shawarma to the Gyro to the Hummus and from FiDi to SOMA, I have always been pleasantly satisfied with all aspects of your service and cuisine.\n\nHowever, today marks the day of an all-around undesirable experience. With my busy work schedule, I ordered the Mezza Plate to save time. My coworkers ordered the Chicken Shawarma wraps after me, and to my surprise, they received their food first. No problem...frying a falafel can take time, right?\n\nMinutes and customers pass by and I watched two other Mezza Plate orders go out, with nothing left on their assembly line resembling my order. I glanced at the tickets on your window, and my ticket was gone. I approached the female cashier, who seems to always look annoyed and never smiles. I asked about my order, and she said that they were making it. My eyes spot falafels sitting on the fryer basket, so I inquire once more looping in the manager(?) this time.\n\nThey explain that the Mezza Plates are all pre-made, so all they need to do is put the falafel on before giving it to the customer. My puzzled look was met with assurance that it just finished cooking as they scrambled to produce my order. The lavash was quickly and half-heartedly heated on the grill, and they sent me on my way.\n\nI left feeling disappointed and lied to, staring down at my Mezza Plate decorated with stingy portions and excess condensation. Why did I spend 30min and $12 on a cold vegetarian dish? Maybe they could tell I need to shed some Thanksgiving weight. \n\nI won't be back for awhile likely due to the fact that my coworkers regretted letting me choose today's lunch spot.

I love all of these mediterranean wraps and it's great there is a place so close to work that does them so well. \n\nFirst, the Kefta Kebab. A lot of people look at the meat on the skewer and assume that's where all the quality comes from. \"No!\" I say. A very underrated component is the sauces and fixings. The combination of Tzatziki and whatever their spicy sauce really compliments the meat. It doesn't overwhelm, but it adds that zing that I've never been able to replicate when cooking on my own at home. I like a bit more of a kick, but just a warning that some people sensitive to spice might want to mention it before you sandwich is made. \n\nBeyond that, the prices are good. $8-10 for most wraps, which I think is incredibly reasonable. You get more than enough food, and the platters look like they have enough food for a left over snack later. Otherwise, this place is noticeably cleaner than you'd expect. I'd hit it up again for lunch in the future.", "author": "Jake B."}

I wish they advertised photos outside of the restaurant so I would find it sooner. Subsequently, the food is a 10/10, however, the cleanliness is a problem. There were 5 employees/workers, and not one cleaned off the tables for us. There is no trash near the exit, and that posed as a slight inconvenience. With that said, astonishingly delicious place, and I HIGHLY recommend it. I will change 4 out of 5 stars to a full 5  if the tables are clean for me to eat the amazing food on. :)", "author": "Vadim F."}

This place was almost empty at the time, so I went in after seeing the reasonably priced food on the menu. I ordered a falafel wrap and wasn't expecting much. However, this reminded me of the ones I'd get while I was studying abroad in Spain, but better since the spicy sauce was actually spicy!", "author": "Gloria A."}

His wrap was a faucet of runny yogurt sauce, splattering on the sidewalk and ruining his black trousers. He had to hold the wrap over a trash can to finish it while we tried to wipe his black trousers clean with diaper wipes. It didn't work. We didn't attempt to wipe the trail of yogurt sauce behind us. \n\nThe kebab itself tasted terrible. Low-grade meat. Nice and soggy thanks to the yogurt bath.", "author": "Zara Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-06", "description": "Extremely mediocre and overpriced food. I came in craving a light lunch and just ordered a Shish Taouk plate. The amount of shishtaouk I got is comical considering I just paid around $14 and some change for this. The portion size for the rice is equally hysterical, not that it matter because the rice is bland and does not have any traditional middle eastern spices to it (in fact, there is corn and carrots of all things, in it.)\n\nNow legitimately more half of this so-called platter is a giant ass helping of tzaziki sauce, hot sauce and a truly subpar attempt at Shepard salad ( the finely diced cucumber and tiny-barely-there-tomato pieces taste so bland and not fresh like someone did not even bother to try). I can't stand when I pay for something and not get what I paid for and mind you, I do not even eat big proportions and wasn't even hungry when I came in here. That salad could've at least used some dill and olives -- jeez how can anyone label their cooking mediteranean and sell it like that.\n\nTo seal the deal, the hummus is equally bland in both flavor and texture which made munching on the generic pita they served seem like the way to go.", "author": "Mia F."}

I was sad it replaced Del Taco but I love Mediterranean food and was eager to check out the new kid on the block. The salads looked really good so I decided to get the Mezza platter with chicken on the side. The falafel and dolmas were solid, but the rest of the options were just whatever. Three of the salads were underdressed/not dressed at all and the tzatziki was also missing something (flavor). The biggest disappointment was the chicken. It looked tasty and well seasoned, but when I tried it, it was dry and bland. Definitely not worth the extra $6. If I go back, I'd stick to the vegetarian options.", "author": "Christy K."}
