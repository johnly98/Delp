{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-11", "description": "Marina Pizza and Caffe:  a small little cafe on one of the major highways through The City where you're likely to get satisfying comfort food.\n\nNote to all you suburbanites:  This is a typical San Francisco experience.  Park far, far away, walk through a loud and busy neighborhood, and enter the small door on 6-lane US 101.  Don't even think about pulling into a parking place in the private lot and strolling in.\n\nThankfully, our party of four found a place only 1-1/2 blocks away.  I was surprised to walk by a country-western bar on Fillmore.  When we walked in, we were faced with a little dining room that seats 12, a menu that had everything handwritten, and a smiling cashier ready to take our order.\n\nWe had just watched \"Lady and the Tramp\" at the Disney museum, so what was on everyone's mind?  Spaghetti!  Three plates of spaghetti, one with meatballs, garlic bread added, and I had to be different and order an Italian Sausage sandwich.  You can also order pizza and calzones, and a large selection of sandwiches for around $10 each.  We all ate as much as we could;  only my wife and I finished our food.  Our family friend said at her first bite, \"Ooohhh, this is SO good!!!\"\n\nIt's the little things that count.  The little things at Marina Pizza & Caffe:  A spotless eating room.  Comfortable seats.  The spaghetti came on a fancy white plate.  The cashier brought out the food, and was making sure that we had a good experience.  Our friend couldn't finish her food, so asked for a to-go box, and got a high-quality container that's microwave safe;  you don't even get that from Tony's Pizza Napoletana in North Beach.\n\nMarina Pizza & Caffe does not have the best Italian food in The City.  But it does have very good food at a very good price.  It's a good place for a romantic night out, a comfortable lunch, or a good pizza for a small group on the way to a night on the town.  Have fun finding parking.", "author": "Ron L."}

Maybe other spots were open, but we didn't feel like walking far in the torrential downpour and we decided on Marina Pizza & Caffe over KFC/Taco Bell because I didn't feel like having diarrhea during a blackout.\n\nThis was LITRALLY (said like Chris Traeger from Parks & Rec) *the most* uncomfortable eating experience I've EVER had to endure. The long line of people ahead of us was totally understandable, but the fact that three groups of people who ordered after us received their orders before us...UNFORGIVABLE. All we ordered was two slices of pizza and a sandwich. The groups of people all ordered at least one box of pizza. What????? We got our food a whole hour after we ordered and the sandwich was cold ... My pizza wasn't piping hot or anything so it's not like they waited for everything to be done before serving it. The veggie pizza was yummy and fresh, while the cheese pizza was like cardboard. I can't comment on the chicken parm because my boyf scarfed it down from ravishing hunger from waiting so long before I got a chance to have a taste (hehe, jk?).\n\nAnyway, the worst part of it all? We had to sit through two customers and the lady running the place argue about money. The two guys were super patient & polite and just wanted a refund for not receiving the food they ordered last night. The lady would not budge and kept saying there was nothing she could do; they had to take it up with her manager. I even overheard her telling her manager on the phone that the guys wanted their money back \"after falling asleep.\" Liar! Really? They paid for something they didn't receive and wasted their time driving to your restaurant and waiting around. She could've easily offered them a comped meal and assured them that their money would be refunded to their credit card. Instead, she ended up threatening to call the police... Are you kidding me?\n\nTo be fair, she was clearly stressed out from the neverending line of hungry customers and relentless ringing of the phone.

Pizza is one of those things where with the right toppings you don't need cheese.\n\nAny chance to build a slice from scratch means going without. From the looks of the menu that seemed to be the case here. Eggplant, tomatoes, lots of sauce, no cheese. \n\nNo sooner had the order been placed that the extremely friendly and accommodating staff member informed me there is a cheese base. Then he offered to take it off.\n\nSlice was delicious and $3.50 with those two toppings is a deal. As was a very good and filling $6.50 grilled chicken sandwich. House red sauce added at no charge.\n\nVery strong four stars for the food. Final star earned by the attentive and generous staff.

I found myself in a quandary last night, it was 11pm on a Tuesday and I wanted to order delivery. Of course, almost nowhere was still open that would deliver late-night on a Tuesday besides pizza. Marina Pizza & Caffe seemed the best of the 10 or so pizza places that would deliver to me. The order took about an hour to get to me. Because I ordered from eat24 it came with a free cesar salad, which was o.k.  \n\nAs for the pizza itself... Well, the crust was thin and had the flavor and consistency of cardboard. The sauce was spread very thin and was relatively flavorless, making it a real non-factor in the taste of the pizza. The cheese was rubbery and very greasy, falling off the pizza in large topping laden globs when I attempted to lift up a piece. The cheese sliding off revealed a bare and nearly sauceless slice. The pepperoni, salame, and mushroom toppings were o.k but nothing special. The pizza did not seem worth the price at all. Ended up paying around $28.00 including tax and tip for one poor quality large pizza and a few sodas. Considering I could have had Pizza Orgasmica or Giorgio's for around that price it seemed like quite a rip off. I would not recommend ordering from here unless you do not have any other choices.", "author": "Tomas K."}

Salty, full enough of cheese and meats, and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette that greatly added to the flavors. The tiramisu was frozen almost but really quite decadent and light; a perfect dessert to our starving stomachs.\n\nBecause this is not Dominos, no Papa Johns, no fast-food delivery pizza - prices are going to be a bit pricier and the cooking time is going to take a little longer.

Well, those stories come from places like this.  Let me tell you a tale...\n\nMy friend was in line ahead of me.  He ordered a slice of pepperoni.  I heard the man say it cost $3.50, which sounded expensive.  I checked the board and saw that it was $3, before tax.  Fifty cents tax on $3 sounded high to me, but I thought I may have misheard.  I paid attention when I ordered a slice of cheese, which the board said was $2.50.  I paid and he rang me up for $3.  When I asked him how he got from $2.50 to $3, which would have been a 20% sales tax, his excuse was that \"they have higher prices at night but that they haven't repainted the board to reflect that yet\".  Logic prevaled within seconds and he paid me back the 25 cents he had overcharged me.\n\nDo I care about losing a quarter here and there? No.  Do I care when a business systematically rips off its customers? Yes.  He did it to me, right after he did it to my friend, just as I am sure he did it to every single customer that came before me that night, and probably the ones after me.

They offer great deals (Marina Deal x-large 2 topping pizza/2liter soda) for under 20 bucks. Pizza is tasty, but I have to say the best thing about them is their prompt delivery and the fact that they deliver until 3am. They are so fast, and always arrive earlier than stated time!", "author": "Camille B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-01-09", "description": "This is the only place I know of that really comes close to an east coast pizzeria.  The pizza here is great.  Nothing fancy, just basic, tasty, this pizza.  I often get the chicken parm sandwich, but it's only average.  The ham and cheese is rather tasty, but not nearly as substantial.  The wings taste fantastic.  Sometimes they come overcooked, but such is life.  This place is open late so you can hit up the late night eats after the bars close.", "author": "Nate B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-23", "description": "The pizza is good, not going to lie. And it is open late. The prices are reasonable. The big, big, big negative which is the only reason I would stay away is the service and the owner/cashier. The cooks are quick, but this one guy is rude, nickle-and-dimes his customers, and is not respectful. You want a to-go box or a glass of water from their sink? Good luck. You have to convince him for that, because he says that he does not want to give it to you. Truly a disgusting way to treat your customers. It is sad.", "author": "Andrew K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-31", "description": "As far as late night delivery goes, i'd recommend this marina pizza & cafe over any other place.  They have THE best chicken wings you can get at 3am. The ravioli is great, chicken parm sandwich is solid.  Pizza is ok but I'm a new york pizza snob so nothing really gets me excited outside of arinelle's.  Food arrives hot and close to the time they quote.", "author": "michael r."}

I ordered once and the guy on the phone messed up the order even after I had him repeat the order back to me. I got a broccoli and green olive pizza delivered to me instead of a ricotta and green olive that I had orderd and I have to say that was a NASTY mix of toppings. The second time I called I made sure he had it right but after an HOUR AND A HALF of waiting for the delivery I finally called only to find out that they had attempted to deliver but called the wrong phone number when they got to my house. I even used the correct number so they could access my account for the order. When I called about this they didnt apologize and said they would redeliver and they brought me a wilted salad and cold pizza. They should have atleast given me a fresh salad for their mistake. However,  its truly tasty pizza and affordable with late night delivery so after a 2 month boycott I gave it another chance and have been happy ever since making sure I speak clearly and loudly and check that they have the correct #. I DO RECCOMMEND this place sometimes you have to forgive and forget.", "author": "M K."}

Thin crust medium veggie pizza and two sodas for $21.  We ordered around 8:30p and it only took about 15 minutes.  Lots of veggies, light cheese, light on the tomato sauce.  If you are starving, get the large.", "author": "Brian L."}

Be it 2 in the morning after a drunken night out......or even at a reasonable dinner time. Prices are pretty inexpensive but delivery sometimes takes a while. I wouldn't know how to comment about the next day leftovers - because it usually all gets gobbled up right away.", "author": "Aline W."}
