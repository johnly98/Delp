The dishes are so reasonably priced, you can get an entree under $10 which is so rare in San Francisco.

When you eat in, they serve the rice in the shape of a heart, which is such a sweet food display in my opinion. \n\nI like their curries the most, both the red and yellow & gaang dang curries are delicious.

Other favorites include their Tom Yum soup, green curry, and fish cakes.

I asked him if the paper bag have chili sauce in it. He said no. I asked him if I can get some. Without saying anything the guy went, came back with two chili sauce containers and slammed it on the table. And I was looking at him like what is going on. The place is not even busy. I wonder how do they treat their customers. \n\nLet's talk about food now. I ordered pad Thai. It was not good at all. Very dry noodles, it was only 4 small shrimps in it and wasn't good at all. I love any type of Thai food but it was the worst pad Thai I have ever had.

We opted for the vegetarian versions of the Pad See Ew and Kao Pad. The Kao Pad was delicious and was my personal favorite, though I found that the vegetables could've been cooked a little longer. The Pad Thai and Tom Kha Gai were good as well. Unfortunately, the Pad See Ew was a bit too oily.\n\nWhen I asked for a substitution that I thought was reasonable (cashews in lieu of egg in a vegetarian dish), the waiter agreed to it but didn't tell me that he'd charge $1 extra.

I belabored over 3 or 4 stars but went with the higher number because of a few things: menu with lots of interesting items you can't find in many other SF Thai restaurants, including the wonderful, but hard-to-find, Southern Thai dish Mussamun (or Massaman) Curry, and their prices for SF are pretty amazing for a place as this (being almost at the end of Church may be partially why; on the other hand, there are now several high-priced places in this area, so I give Regent full kudos for keeping things low), and a few more things I'll detail below.\n\nThe main problem here is that the flavors are not bold enough -- the food preparation is somewhat lacking in passion & soul, so to speak.\n\nThe Tom Kha Khai (chicken coconut soup) was just \"ok.\"\n\nChicken Satay, although nicely presented, was otherwise uninspiring, with slightly greasy chicken and a fairly flavorless peanut sauce.\n\nThe Massaman Curry, one of my all-time favorite dishes, Thai or otherwise, was truly lacking in flavor, the beef was a little tough, and it was missing the traditional burnt peanuts within.  But, again, I appreciate that they had it at all.\n\nGood things about this place, besides the aforementioned low prices, is a pleasant interior, very nice staff, albeit a bit harried, extremely quick order-to-arrival -- it's rare I've gotten my food so fast (eating in the restaurant) -- comfortable seating, and they serve rice chips with a sweet sauce as a free meal-starter, extremely rare for a Thai restaurant.\n\nBut, unfortunately, this is not a \"destination\" Thai restaurant, really only good for the folks who live in the neighborhood because it's so convenient.  I much prefer Chili Cha Cha 2 on 24th in the Mission (located not all that far from this one).", "author": "Merrick W."}

However, I am disappointed to leave a three-star review for many different reasons. The biggest factor has to be the quality of the food. I cannot underscore how mediocre and bland the taste of the two dishes that I tried. The Boneless trout is overwhelming with monotonous sweetness. And the curried pumpkin with vegetables lacks dimensions. I could hardly taste any spices. The service staff was courteous, but they were rushing me at around 9:19 p.m. The restaurant was supposed to be close at 10. The dining room space is not adequately heated. I looked around and most of the customers were still wearing the jackets. I asked one of the wait staff and she explained that one time they forgot to turn off the heater when they closed down the restaurant. The next thing they knew the manager threatened to fire them. So as a result, they turned off the heater early. Overall, it was rather a disappointing experience. No way I am recommending this place to friends and family.", "author": "Thuy V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-22", "description": "Another visit, this time for dinner. Feeling like embracing MY vision of the arch-typical Thai meal: \n\nTHE FOOD:\n\nTOM YUM GUNG - Spicy and sour prawns soup with mushrooms, tomatoes and lemon grass\n\nThe soup was unbearably salty. The mushrooms were the (American) white cap cut in half and floating in the brine - come on Regent at least use brown crimini's to avoid that American Midwest sheen. Dinner companion suggested we send it back. Knowing the likely outcome of \"we have never had this complaint\" or taking it back to the kitchen and pouring more water into the bowl, we ate some of the floating mushrooms & shrimp, which made a  -salty- appetizer.\n\nSOM TUM - Shredded green papaya w/ dried shrimp, carrots, tomatoes, ground peanuts/lime juice dressing\n\nOdd. With the papaya salad within the bounds of a proper rendition, it was on top of a nest of plain lettuce. The \"salad on a salad\" redundancy was an affront to the papaya salad. Peanuts were not ground, they were peanut halves, which oddly I am really happy with since I can grab them with my chopsticks. \n\nPAD THAI - Rice stick noodles with egg, tofu, ground peanuts, bean sprouts with shrimp (thatle be a $1 uplift)\n\nItsan ok rendition. Tofu fried a few days before serving (not fresh). It struck me that even the mall joint Coriander Thai (IN THE METREON COMPLEX) serves up a better version. \n\nTHE SERVICE:\n\nAt most, 1/3 of the tables were occupied. The server ladies dressed in embroidered Thai looking dresses seemed to be plentiful. Getting their attention required a large gesture of a long duration. They were having fun, joking with each other while standing near the kitchen. Felt like we were messing up their evening of cavorting. We are not demanding diners, but events like getting the \"check\" shouldn't take the exertion of over 100 calories. \n\nUNRELATED DRIVEL - Observing fellow diners:\n\nObserving fellow diners which are in close proximity is sometimes interesting, and usually unavoidable. A middle aged man with a late teen boy a couple of tables away. The boy with a -fashion- baseball cap, and the man with his smart phone. Didn't seem like much discussion was taking place -silence-. Boy leaves, goes toward the back where the restrooms are. Man pays the bill. A few minutes go by. Man is wondering where boy is, and goes back to the restroom, pounds on the door and audibly \"what are you doing? sleeping?\". They leave in silence. So, we are left to wonder was this a father and rebellious son? or, a May-December relationship heading the way of the dinosaur (extinct)?. We will never know, but did provide a live, high drama show which was worth the price of admission at a mediocre restaurant.", "author": "Matsuo U."}

An experience to be had. \n\nHe ordered the basil beef, and I ordered the red curry with chicken(not as spicy for me, I have stomach issues). I wanted beef, but I got up to use the restroom and had my boyfriend order for me and he mixed them up. We also got a side of rice to share. \nWhen our dishes came out, I was impressed. The food had great flavor and was VERY satisfying!\n\nWe skipped out on dessert because I wanted to find another place with a wider range.

Of course my fat ass would take a full dinner over a glass of wine any day. \n\nIt took us forever to get seated. We seriously stood there for ages eating their candy before they noticed us and finally sat us down. They brought us shrimp chips and put the empty order sheet on our table but never gave us menus wtf! So there goes another 10 minutes when they come back and ask what we want to order and we let them know we weren't given menus and she gave us the most passive apology ever. I also didn't have all the flatware at my table. The water was always refilled though so that is a plus. \n\nWe ordered pumpkin curry with prawns (didn't see it on the menu so just ask), brown rice, vegetarian tom kha, and their scallop and shrimp w/ eggplant dish (#57). Everything was really good! Especially the seafood dish and the pumpkin curry is packed with pumpkin! Omnomnom. One thing I did not like is their tofu. I only like soft tofu without that fried skin and their tofu is fried. \n\nTheir stuffed pumpkin dessert looked really good but I was so full we just went to bi-rite after and grabbed some honey lavender ice cream and cookies to eat back home.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

The Gung Pad Kee Mao had some flavour of garlic and don't remember any bamboo shoots in there. But the portion size was smaller than a side order.

Regent Thai is located in a nice, quiet neighbouhood in Noe Valley. Parking was pretty hard only because it was very residential. As you enter the restaurant, you notice the beautiful ambienace of the place. So simple, bright, and cheerful. The restaurant honestly has a great vibe to it in general.\n\nI ordered a Thai Iced Tea, and the Green Bean Chicken. My friends ordered the Vegetable Curry and Pad Thai. The Vegetable Curry came out first. We each tried a small sample of it, and I absolutely loved it. I could never be a vegetarian just because meat tastes too good to give up, but boy, were these vegetables good! Best Vegetable Curry I have had in a LONG time. The Pad Thai came out next, and it was mediocre. Tasted like any other Pad Thai. Then, my Green Bean Chicken finally came out of the kitchen. Warm, steamy, and fresh, I took a bite. AMAZING! Had just the right amount of spice and went very well with the steamed rice and Thai Iced Tea. \n\nSo to sum it all up, the food was well priced and the quantity of it was enough to be full. Regent Thai gets my award for the most flavorful Thai food. The quality was fresh and the ambiance was nice.\n\nI will be back!", "author": "Emmanuella Z."}

Hubster and I discovered this place a few months ago and since then, I've gotten take out from here to take back down the Peninsula when I have after work events up in SF.\n\nThe service we've gotten has consistently been really good and the food has been delicious.\n\nGolden bags - everyone on Yelp recommended it. The filling was strangely sweet. The wonton wrapper was crispy and I liked the side of cucumbers. I couldn't get over the cloying sweetness. Not a fan.\n\nDuck curry - OMG... SOOOO good. A lot of Thai places offer duck curry but the duck is bland and mediocre. It tastes like the duck was seasoned in peking duck seasoning before being turned into red curry. Best part is that the dish is studded generously with pineapples. Coconut. Pineapples. Duck. I'm in heaven.\n\nPed gra prow - Stir fried boneless duck with basil, bell peppers, and chili. MMMMmmm... Delicious! Again.. the duck was superb... *drool* This dish plus the duck curry = heaven times two.\n\nPad Thai - Pad thai here was done really well. The portions were a bit on the small side when I eat with Hubster but when I shared with Jenn W. it was perfect. They have little chunks of tofu in there that she loved. Flavors were balanced perfectly with the savory, sweet, slight tang and topped with the crunch of bean sprouts and peanuts.\n\nPad Kee Mao - Pad thai won over Pad Kee Mao. I wasn't severely impressed since it didn't blow the Pad Kee Mao from Shana Thai out of the water. It was still delicious but wasn't outstanding.\n\nMMM... I just need to get another excuse to come up here to pig out. The prices are extremely generous for the quality and food you get. The portions aren't HUGE but are reasonable. Service is great, we walked in two seconds before they were about the close and still served us... after I pleaded and begged and promised that we would scarf our food down really fast.", "author": "Vicky L."}

I am Thai myself and come from a very judgmental family of Thai food and nothing has ever been good enough in this city when they come to visit, particularly my dad who has only ever liked one other pad thai dish (which is in Texas!).\nI highly recommend the following dishes:\n1) Pad Thai - amazing! The perfect amount of flavors and sweetness.\n2) Golden Bags - What are these creations? They taste like heaven.. wonderful crisp heaven.\n3) Stuffed Chicken Wings - simply delicious, the flavors are so yummy.\n4) Deep Fried Spring Rolls - great crispy rolls\n5) Miang Kham - Requires specific taste buds, but if you already have had this dish and like it, this is the best place to get it at.\n6) Fried Rice - Yum! It's good for fried rice, not as good as the Pad Thai, but yummy all the same.\n7) Shrimp crackers - sounds kind of gross to someone who has never had it, but they are good crunchy light crackers. They serve it as an appetizer in the restaurant and you can also order some with takeaway, even though it is not on the menu.\n\nThis place is just great. I have eaten in the restaurant and more often order takeaway because of the amazing prices. The service is great and the waiters are nice and friendly. \nYou just cannot beat this place -- good food + good prices + they are so FAST.\nMy boyfriend and I order from them almost every week!\n\nAnd yes, their rice is super cute.", "author": "Lia V."}

We both love spicy food but decided to settle on medium heat for the evening to include my girlfriend. They serve a very modest American Medium Spicy here, not a Thai Medium, which is good to know if you are sensitive to spicy food.\n\nI loved the way that the food was paced out into courses. A lot of places try to get all of the food ready at the same time and then just dump it on the table when it's ready and leave you to it. Not so here. We were served tasty shrimp crackers with a sweet and spicy sauce before we had even looked at the menu and when our Tom Yum Kai soup arrived the waitress portioned out each bowl and placed one in the middle of each of our plates! The soup was good but I could have dealt with a little more spice even with our Medium spice setting.\n\nNext came the Twice Roasted Duck which was to die for. It was definitely the favorite dish of each of us. We also had the Pad Thai and a Shrimp dish which the waitress recommended and both were delicious as well.

I love how it can be so tender and tasty, but hate when it drips with obscene amounts of oil. Thus I am very cautious about where I order it and how it is prepared. \n\nSimilarly, I am just as cautious and picky about Thai food. I have had some great Thai dishes, and others that have made me sick and nauseous. \n\nEnter in Regent Thai. Not only does this restaurant serve up some of the tastiest duck but their yellow curry comes with tender morsels of duck and delicious chunks of fresh pineapple in a lightly sweetened coco-nutty curry. Their chicken pad thai is equally as good with tender chicken and great bits of tofu in it. \n\nService is phenomenal.

They must, because they never seem to want to be open when I have family and friends from hundreds of miles away who finally come to try this Thai place that I have been raving about.  It's like that one cool thing that you did that one time when nobody was around and now you can't make it happen again for anybody to believe you.  Anyways, even if I can't prove it, I know the truth of Regent Thai's awesomeness.\n\nRegent Thai is very charming.  It sits in the middle of a peaceful neighborhood, right along my favorite Muni Metro line (The J).  The waitresses are always fancified with curled hair and traditional-looking dresses.  When they serve rice from the exotic aluminum rice dishes they always ask \"Rice please?\", rather than \"Would you like some rice?\"  But who was ever offended by servers being over-courteous?  Not I, in fact, I think it's kinda cute.\n\nYou'll notice that most of their appetizers are fried goodies, except the Miang Kham.  The Miang Kham is a very interesting, but very tasty, dish.  I think it is toasted almonds, ginger, lime, cocnut, and dried shrimp on top of single spinach leaves and served with a sweet sauce.\n\nIf I took the time to discuss every dish here, this would turn out to be an even lengthier review, so I will just hit a few more points.\n\n- If you ask for something \"extra hot\", you gon' get it!\n\n- The ratio of fresh vegetables to other ingredients in the dishes makes for a happy digestive system.\n\n- Strange Thai chips \"chicharones\" are served when you arrive.\n\n- Prices are LOW and food is served FAST!\n\n- Overall, my favorite Thai food experience so far (and I've even eaten Thai food in Thailand)", "author": "Jesse M."}

The yellow curry was more like a red curry and the scallops were a kinda over done. The portion sizes were also kinda small relative to what I'm used to at Thai Noodle, but the Pad see ew was done well and the veggies were fresh and crisp.\n\nMy issue however was with the service.  My wife & I were having a good time so the slow service didn't bother us too much, but never have I been challenged to stand my ground so resolutely by a server.  Maybe she's taking a negotiating class and trying to practice her new skills.  After ordering a house wine for $3.50 I was charged $6.

I live right up the street so I called in my order for pick-up and when i got there they were about to close.  I don't know if this is the reason for my food being absolutely dreadful or if it is they have started skimping due to the economy?   Anyway I ordered the \"Vegetarian Lovers\"  a favorite of mine and once I opened the box I was extremely disappointed.  Once lovingly fried large portions were 3 green beans, 3 small pieces of sweet potato, and 3 slim over-cooked triangles of tofu.  My roommate got the SALAD KHAEK and had to ask for extra tofu (which they charge a dollar for) when really the amount of tofu in the salad after you ask for EXTRA is about the amount you would expect without asking (and paying) for extra.  Basically this place nickle and dimes you for EVERYTHING while skimping on EVERYTHING in the first place, not the kind of thing you'd expect from a thai place with all ready high prices.  \n\nBasically I say if you want to try this place SKIP IT!  you can find other places that give you more food for the money and whose employees don't convey an overly saccharin sweet disposition that makes you feel less violated for being nickle and dimed for everything in the first place.  Save your money and go else where....and may I just mention my roommate got a sweet case of food poisoning from the salad...yes I said SALAD, can we say cross-contamination?", "author": "Morgan B."}

Not quite as potent as I would have preferred, but good.  What allowed them to earn a fourth star was the selection of peppers that they will bring to your table upon request and which allowed me to kick the curry up a notch or two.  I had ordered Panang Neua (beef), which is my baseline Thai curry, and it was little watery compared to what I would normally enjoy, but it included a tasty assortment of fresh-cooked vegetables, so I was willing to be forgiving.  In addition, the appetizer we ordered, the stuffed fried chicken wings, was simply outstanding, and the service was good.

My wife and I had some of our earliest dates at Regent, and my daughter counts it as one of her favorite restaurants anywhere.  So a review of Regent feels more like reviewing a family member, and that can be a little tricky.  But putting aside the personal warmth I feel towards this restaurant, I will don my hat of objectivity and assert Regent is a consistently excellent dining experience.\n\nThe Regent menu is comprehensive, but not excessive, and the result is a reasonable variety of dishes that are consistently well-executed.  My family tends to veer towards seafood and veggie dishes, and Regent excels at these.  Miang Kham is a great starter, with coconut, dried shrimp, lime and nuts wrapped together in lettuce leaves and served with a delicious savory-sweet sauce (my daughter also loves the Golden Bags).  Golden Salmon is a favorite entree, a mild yellow curry sauce and vegetables together with a perfectly cooked salmon fillet (the Ginger Salmon is also quite good).  Another standout and perfect pairing for the Golden Salmon is Tofu Gra Prow, with sauteed tofu with green beans, red pepper, and basil in a medium spicy sauce.  There are numerous beef, chicken, and duck entrees, and they are particularly adept at preparing duck, which is always tender and juicy.\n\nService is gracious, efficient, and very friendly.  The place is often busy, but it's the rare occasion when the kitchen takes more than a few minutes to turn around an order.  Even rarer is the case when they make a mistake, although there have been times when they replaced an unwanted dish for an error *I* made.\n\nPrices are extremely reasonable, with higher end dishes topping out around $10, and many veggie selections in the $6-8 range.  The dining room is somewhat loud, but very pleasant and comfortable, with warm wood floors and an open, airy feel to the place.\n\nI dined at Regent last night with on old friend and two new acquaintances, none of whom had ever been there.

The dining area seems to always have 'just enough' diners to not feel 'empty,' but it's never too noisy.  Mostly frequented by locals.\n\nTheir prices are incredibly decent and the place is impeccably clean.  Presentation of their dishes are simple, but you can't help but feel like great care was taken in ensuring a clean, simply elegant display.\n\nThe staff are super-friendly - and my water glass never ran empty.  None of the dishes we ordered were heavy in oils or texture.  The portions are a bit minimal, but it just forced us to order more different dishes to satisfy our appetite.  Plus, with their prices, you can have a budget-savvy meal w/dessert.", "author": "Olma M."}

Totally reminds me of a dish I had on the street outside the royal palace in Bangkok - make sure to ask for it \"really spicy\" to get the true feel for this wonderful dish.  Everything else I've had from here has been above par takes on Thai standards familiar to most of us Americans.  I can definitely recommend pretty much any of their seafood dishes and they do my favorite rendition of spicy eggplant with chicken and basil.

I might just have bad luck, but unlike a lot of other Thai places they actually cut the stems off the mushrooms! Imagine that. Yellow Prawns are the next best thing at Regent. Now I've had better Pad Thai, but I've also had worse. It's a draw on that one. The Butterfly Prawns are very misleading, they sound wonderful and taste awful. I want to like them so much that I've actually tried them three times!

I crave their \"Tofu Choo Roos\" (I'm sure I've mangled the name there, but it's in the Chef's specials). Great selection for vegetarians and meat-lovers, great portions at excellent prices. No complaints (ok, well - parking sucks but whatever) - I go here for dinner at least once a week :-)", "author": "What's in a nam e."}

Every first of the month, I get a craving for their delicious Pad Thai (w/ shrimp). Other notable items are the Duck with Red Curry and the spring rolls. Yum yum. The have a great variety, so I find myself getting a different 2nd entree with my Pad Thai. Also good for takeout since I am a Noe Valley local. It's a nice walk down Church Street or hop on the J if you'd like. Delicious and accessible!", "author": "Ang F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-30", "description": "Everybody has their favorite Thai restaurant, but this is the best one close to my place.  They have excellent, and I mean outstanding, green curry at lunch for only $5.25 including rice (available for dinner too for a bit more).  This is one of the best, if not the best, green curries I've had outside of Thailand.  The red curry and pad thai are pretty good as well, but not quite as amazing, and the panang curry is only OK -- go elsewhere for better panang.  For dinner, the duck curry is really fantastic, up there on par with the green curry, and it's only $7.95.  Too bad it's not available for lunch.  The decor is quite nice, with a magnificent woodcarving.  Minus one star because not all the dishes are excellent (I'm still exploring), but if you stick to the green and duck curries, we're talking five star food at a great price!", "author": "Bill P."}

My girlfriend and I ordered the chicken pad thai and the duck curry.  The duck curry was fairly tasty (and there was a good amount of duck) but the pad thai was less than inspired.  The pad thai was dry and seemed almost too sweet.  The service was fairly good, but then again the place was pretty empty.  We don't live in the neighborhood so we probably won't go back anytime soon.  But I could see how it could be decent takeout food if you lived close by.", "author": "Aaron D."}

There are really only two or three Thai places that I swear by, and this is one of them. I enjoy the neighborhood, parking is adequate, and the service is PERFECT. While this isn't my favorite place for noodles, the appetizers and other entrees are satisfying and colorful. I absolutely adore the double-cooked duck (a la carte). The sliced duck rests on perfectly cooked spinach - never stringy (you know where the stem is still in your mouth and the leaf is dangling somewhere in your throat - NOT COOL), and is topped with crispy basil. The accompanying sauce is wonderful over your choice of rice - yet another reason to love this place - brown or white rice? I choose brown 'cuz mom did a great job at drilling the whole grain thing into my head and their rice is never overly chewy. Also good - golden money bags app., fresh spring rolls, pad Thai (though I like SF Thai BBQ's better), and the eggplant and pork dish. Like i said before, the service is rather astonishing - your water glass is never half-empty (or half-full for all you optimists out there) and your food comes before you start saying \"Lord, I am  sooooooo huuuunnggry (like Lydia Bennett in A&E's Pride and Prejudice - if you know what I am talking about, I may be madly in love with you...). I could eat there once a week with ease.", "author": "Jessa B."}

It's also very close to Mitchell's ice cream which puts it high on my list. After being seated we were served some deep fried rice cakes with a fishy tasting sauce. I wasn't a fan of the sauce, but it was nice to have something to munch on as we waited for the incredibly slow waitress to take our order. Apparently they thought that we had an additional person in our party so they didn't come by to take the order for about 30 mines despite our pleading. Once we finally convinced them that indeed, no one else was due to arrive, the service was fine. For appetizers we had spicy chicken wings with garlic, chili, and basil as well as deep fried yams with green beans and tofu served with a sweet peanut sauce and diced cucumbers. The wings were not bad, but not on par with those at Marnee Thai or Bui. The fried yams were very tasty. For our main courses we had pad si ew with chicken, sliced beef with chili, onions, and green peppers as well as a panang curry with shrimp. The beef dish was probably my favorite, the meat was tender and the sauce was delicious. The pad si ew was pretty good but the noodles could have been thicker. The curry flavor was allright but as I don't like shrimp, I couldn't eat that much of it. Overall I would give this place 3.5 starts. Not as good as Marnee or as innovative as Koh Samui and the Monkey but good nonetheless, and if you are in the area or making a trip to Mitchells, it's worth a try.", "author": "Kate A."}

The dishes are reasonably priced and the lunch menu is a steal. In a town where Thai ice tea flows freely, I think Regent Thai's is the best. You can never go wrong with their yellow curry or beef panang curry and their tom ga kai is rich and chock full of chicken. My kids could live on that soup. I can't remember the Thai name for it, but their yellow herbed rice dish with chicken, almonds and raisins is also very good. You don't find that dish at most Thai restaurants. I like that they serve pickled cucumbers, carrots and onions on the side. It adds to the presentation of the dishes as well as enhances the flavor of the meal. I should add that they are very kid friendly and most nights you will find neighborhood families dining here. If you go often enough and become a regular, they give you free dessert! Bring a kid and you'll always walk out with candy of some kind.", "author": "Kara P."}

I had a great dinner last night there with two friends who had never been and because AGAIN friends loved it so much, I decided to finally write them a review.  It's also very affordable.  We had the Golden Bags (fried lil' curry potato dumplings w/cucumber salad) and Chicken Satay for appetizers. We also had a large bowl of the Tom Kai Soup (chicken and coconut) and my friend said it was the best she's ever had.  Then we had like 3 or 4 dishes and 3 thai iced teas and then two cokes and the bill came out to $63 bucks.  I was again happily suprised at how reasonable the bill was for such a good and plentiful dinner.
