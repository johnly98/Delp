We tried about 3 weeks out and it was all booked up, so I'd recommend planning far ahead! They do 3 seatings: 6, 7:45 and 9:30. My friend asked about the 7:45 and owner told her that he'd follow up if there were any cancellations and actually did let us know of one (I love when people actually follow up on stuff like this), so we were able to go on the initial day we requested - yay!\n\nFrom the outside it looks like a little chicken joint that fits right in near the 24th St. BART. Once you get inside, though, it's a modern little space that seats 12, with an open kitchen where you can see the chef at work. It's a super intimate experience!\n\nThey do a 4 course tasting menu each day and it varies based on the day. On the day we went, we had an heirloom tomato salad that was fresh and delicious, a chicken arepa (which omg was so good and a giant portion - I think this was my favorite thing), cod served over a grain (farro? Something like that) with broth that was delicious, and homemade ice cream for dessert that was also excellent. The portioning was perfect so that I left full and satisfied, but not stuffed. Couldn't believe this whole experience was $30, when you're lucky to get an entree alone for that price at a \"foodie\" type spot in SF. \n\nWe shared a bottle of wine that was reasonably priced and our server (the other owner, who wasn't cooking) helped recommend what would pair well with the food. For all this, plus tip, we spent a total of $60 each! So much fun.", "author": "Christine G."}

Ok make that sign me up after texting the chef 20 times to coordinate for a table for 4 on a weekend. Anyways, worth it! \n\nThe space has a total of maybe 12 seats? It's dark, cramped, a little dingy and awesome. The chef/owner makes what he wants. When we were there in early Oct, the menu consisted of \n- plum/pluot salad - loved the sweet start with fresh fruit but we longed for a bit of burrata? But then it wouldn't have been $30 a person \n- half of a giant arepa with a ton of chicken and some avocado sauce. This was a meal by itself. I wished the chicken were a little hotter in temperature but that said, this was really tasty \n- scallops with fennel and bacon jam and butternut squash pur\u00e9e. Delicious! So this is how you do bacon-scallops without over-cooking the scallops :). \n- dessert: giant scoop of Concord grape sorbet. I don't really like grape juice but if you do, you would've liked this. \n\nI would totally go back.. hopefully they'll consider a more convenient way of getting reservations set ups. :)", "author": "Jean L."}

Blacked out windows, tiny seating area for 12 only, and a chef who vapes in between serving meals... How much edgier can you get? \n\nThe food was good, but the jury is still out on whether this is truly worth it for the price you pay. Maybe back when it was $15 for the prix fixe, but now it just feels like you get what you pay for. The courses were the following: \n\nPeaches with yogurt and wild honey: Sweet and creamy because of the yogurt. The herbs sprinkled on top added a bitter aftertaste.\n\nChicken arepa: There is no more beautiful sight than 6 steaming arepas sliced open on a counter top. I loved how the texture of the outer shell was kind of chewy and stuck to your teeth, almost like rice flour, but I felt like the sauces were not strong enough to flavor the chicken. \n\nWagyu with gochujang butter: The wagyu didn't have much flavor, and the gochujang butter was pretty muted too. My favorite was the dumpling squash that came on the side, drizzled in sesame dressing. It was so deliciously sweet and complemented well by the nuttiness of the sesame. \n\nBerry sorbet: Was a bit disappointed with this. I expected them to try a bit harder with the dessert, but this was literally just scoops of sorbet out of a giant tub, plopped in a bowl. \n\nService was nice enough. They were literally clearing plates to be washed and rinsed in a sink towards the back, which I thought was great. No industrial dishwasher here! The chef threw some shade at this one lady who was eating her arepa with a fork and knife. Don't be that person.", "author": "Sophie W."}

This place is the definition of a hole-in-the-wall great find. \n\nExterior - looks like a small store undergoing reconstruction, with no real window. I was almost certain we had gone to the wrong place. But thats what makes it a hole in the wall\n\nInterior: seats maybe 10-12 people, so a reservation, which is done over text, is essential. Very interesting decor. The bathroom is lit by a red light, with marbles in the sink.\n\nFood: 4 courses for 30. The food is left to the decision of the single chef. We got seated at the chefs counter/bar, so we got to watch the master at work. Standouts included the lamb, which was melt-in-your-mouth fatty and the rose-flavored ice cream. As we were eating, he provided us with good conversation and remarked that the food was inspired by his recent travels.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to foodies looking for affordable gustatory entertainment", "author": "Jenny C."}

For $30 a person you get 4 courses, all chef's choice, there are no menus here. They change their menu about every week and a half or so according to our waiter who was awesome. \n\nYou walk in and it's a tiny room with 3 tables for 2, 1 table for 4 and a tiny breakfast bar that seats 2 and overlooks the small kitchen that produces large flavors. This is an extremely intimate spot, we loved it.\n\nOur first course was a carrot and cardamom soup topped with pepitas (pumpkin seeds) and hazelnut oil. These are all flavors I am not usually a fan of, as they typically overpower anything they are mixed with, but to my surprise we're very subtle. It was delicious and silky with a perfect bit of crunch. \n\nOur second course was their famous chicken arepa. They really stuff it with chicken and cheese and a mixture of two sauces that balanced each other out so well. The chicken was super flavorful and tender, definitely dark meat and shredded. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside. \n\nOur third course was Waygu beef topped with a fermented chili butter with a side of roasted broccolini. This was hands down the best meal of the night! We were super sad at how fast we ate this delicious beef as that was all you got! Everyone was literally licking their plates clean.\n\nOur final course was a scratch made blood orange and basil sorbet. It was super delicious and again not overpowered by the basil. Another subtle kiss of flavor that just really worked.\n\nThe waiter always made sure my wine glass was never empty as we purchased a bottle and my husband always had a fresh beer. He was personable and was excited to give recommendations as we were new to the area. Really great guy!\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of five is really just because we tried to compliment the chef a few times, but he was too busy flirting with the two young girls at the bar seats, vaping and showing off (rightfully so, but still). I am also a chef and just wanted to let the guy know what a great job he was doing, but he didn't seem to care.\n\nAll in all this was a great experience and if I ever return to the area again, I will definitely be sure to return and see what else this place has to offer! Delicious food at a reasonable price, you can't go wrong!", "author": "Kiera L."}

The idea of texting to make a reservation and intimate dining experience lead to a truly enjoyable meal all around! \n\nAttentive service (only two tables after all); fresh delicious food, and a true \"foodie\" feel. For Mr. Pollo, you need to text to make a reservation, and they're generally booked up to two weeks in advance. Their time slots are 6, 7:45, and potentially 9:30 depending on the day. Two men run it (one serves the other cooks) and they have a wonderful gig going here in the Mission. Overall, it's about $30 for 4 dishes including dessert, which when factoring quality and caliber, really puts Mr. Pollo ahead of the competition. \n\nI will say however, that we all left still kind of hungry as our main, the scallops, while delicious, were not as \"hefty\" as a main dish could be. However taste wise, the starter of heirloom tomato + burrata and second of an arepa were both delicious dishes. I could have done without the watermelon sorbet at the end. Felt a little less creative and unique than other courses.  \n\nWould come back for a fun dining experience, just a slight bummer we all left a little hungry.", "author": "Kyle S."}

I had wanted to come here since I heard about the amazing fixed menus at reasonable prices and as soon as we had an available weekend, I made sure to text ahead and make a reservation. We came for the 7:45pm seating and were the first ones in the restaurant as we were 10ish minutes early. We got our pick of seats and picked the table for two farthest from the door. This place is TINY, hence the need for a reservation. I don't think there were more than 12 seats. Our seat was warmer than being by the door but next time, I think I would choose to sit at the bar looking over the counter.\n\nAnyways, Mr. Pollo does have a selection of Wine and Beer and you can also BYOB for a small corkage fee (I think $15). The waiter recommended a red wine due to what was being served that night and I was more than happy to indulge in a nice glass of Pinot Noir. A was STOKED since they had the high alcohol Not Your Father's Root Beer which we had trudged through Chicago winter for last year since, apparently, you could only get it on tap in IL. He was thrilled to learn they now had limited distribution in large format bottles so he HAD to order it. I think we would probably JUST come back for this root beer, it was THAT GOOD and so much better than the more common Not Your Father's Root Beer.\n\nAnyways, as everyone came in and sat, the food began to be served. The menu is set before you get there so you're eating whatever the chef feels like cooking that night. Luckily, everything we had was AWESOME so seriously, just trust you will enjoy it. Maybe don't bring a picky eater or a vegetarian. The four courses we had:\n\n-Pate: Probably my least favorite course but I also don't like Pate and this was fine. It was light and fruitier. It may have been mixed with beet but I am not sure. The portion was great for an appetizer.\n\n-Arepa: OMG I STILL TASTE THIS IN MY DREAMS. So good. I would pay for just 4 courses of these Arepas. I think it was chicken on the inside. This was really big but also, I just couldn't stop eating it. Seriously, so yummy.\n\n-Steak with Sweet Potato and Brussels Sprouts: Really good and well cooked. Not a small portion either and I really liked the more \"fall\" entree. This seems so simple but I WISH I could come close to cooking this meal at home.\n\n-Ice Cream with Granola and Compote: I completely forget what kind of ice cream this was (note to self: write reviews as close to dining as possible) but it was GREAT. I really liked the toppings and it was the perfect, light end to a meal.\n\nWe paid ~$50 each with tax, tip, drinks and the meal which for a meal of this caliber is a STEAL.

Our four courses were a plum and burrata salad, chicken arepa, striped bass with pur\u00e9ed cauliflower and artichoke tapenade, and pistachio gelato. Everything was fresh and delicious. I don't love fish but the skin on the bass was so crispy and the potatoes, cauliflower and tapenade balances it nicely.", "author": "KimnCris K."}

They have an easy reservation system, where my friend just texted one of the only two guys who work at the restaurant. When two people tried to walk in, I overheard him saying he was fully booked for the Friday night we were there, but he had spots for the next night and to just text him or go to the website to make reservations. \n\nFor four courses for about $35 (including beer/wine), this was a great deal. It's a small, sort of dark space with lots of personality packed into it - including a Donald Trump pinata hanging from the ceiling.\n\ntomato thyme soup - delightfully peppery and a flavorful. Great start to the meal.\n\nchicken arepa - Mr. Pollo was originally an arepa joint, and from what I understand, their tasting menu usually has one arepa course. This was probably my first arepa ever, crispy on the outside with moist chicken drizzled with red and green sauces on the inside.\n\nsteak with bourbon brown sugar sauce, mini roasted red potatoes and carrots - the bourbon brown sugar sauce was to die for. I wanted to lick it off the plate! It was like a pot roast but elevated.\n\npeach sorbet with lavender sea salt and olive oil - a bit on the sweeter and creamier side for a sorbe, but great peach flavor.", "author": "Christina G."}

Since I don't eat any red meat I asked if they would accommodate and they said it wasn't a problem. \n\nThe courses were all well put together. One I still am drooling over was a chestnut soup with vanilla date (or something like that) so so good. The chicken Arepa was of course fabulous. I look forward to having it again soon.

It's less than $40 for a 4 course meal which is a great deal in SF! The place is pretty small - seats about 10 people. I believe they do 3 seatings per night.The staff is also very friendly.\n\nFor the first course, we had a tomato cucumber salad with pickled red onions and anchovies (http://bit.ly/2b4Vue8). I'm not a huge fan of anchovies because they're very fishy but everything else in this dish was delicious.\n\nFor the second course we had a chicken arepa (http://bit.ly/2boQ8uR). It's definitely the best arepa i've ever had. The meat was juicy and flavorful. The dough was crispy enough on the outside and just the right thickness. \n\nFor the third course we had steak with pureed cauliflower, summer squash, carrot, and chimichurri sauce. The steak was medium and pretty good but my favorite on this dish was the pureed cauliflower. It was seasoned perfectly.\n\nFor the fourth and final course, we had a lavender sorbet with a drizzle of blueberry syrup (http://bit.ly/2aQ9FCB). The dish was served in a gorgeous coconut bowl. This was my least favorite dish because it didn't really stand out and unfortunately lavender sorbet always reminds me of soap...\n\nOverall I loved the dinning experience at Mr. Pollo and would definitely come back just for the chicken arepa!", "author": "Lily L."}

Each person paid $60 for the 4 courses and about two glasses of wine which is an absolute steal for SF fine dining. The guys were very nice and accommodating.

Oh wait yes, Mr Pollo. I tried this place for the first time by reserving the whole restaurant. We had 13 people and it was a tight fit, but doable. The first course was a chilled fish dish with bread, it was light, refreshing, and paired perfect with the champagne they kept pouring us. Up next was the Arepa that is always served. If you read reviews for this place I have to echo what everyone else says you could come here for just this and be satisfied end of story! Up next pork tenderloin, red potatoes, green beans, and a sweet Dijon sauce. This is a very familiar dish for this native Midwesterner, all I can say here is every person acclaimed about how their pork was cooked perfectly! And last course a lemon curd pana cotta with black sesame seeds, perfection. This place is where you take friends who have been in the city for awhile and are looking for a whole new experience. Lastly the guys here are just plane cool. We did the 9:30 seating and honesty I think we might do it again and just ask to hang out all night there with them. \nThe space itself is small, and has a art studio/ garage space feel to it with older chairs, it's not fancy by any means.

It's rare I come across restaurants (even very fancy ones) where I really enjoy every dish in a multi-course meal.\n\nWhat's more is that Will and Johnny (chef) were awesome hosts and like everyone has said, the dining experience here is intimate. We sat at the counter and chatted with them as they made the food fresh in front of us - it was all very casual and different from other restaurant experiences I've had. It was like sitting with friends that were cooking a nice meal for us.\n\nThe overall atmosphere is hard to describe - this place is like a dive restaurant with the decor and attitude, but they serve up food with an upscale touch. They don't have menus and it's a set menu - not sure if they allow substitutions or how well they can cater to dietary restrictions. Make reservations, come in with an open mind, chat with the Johnny and Will, and sit back enjoy a great laid back dinner.\n\nThey also apparently also allow you to rent out the place for a small group if you buy all the seats for the last seating of the night - without any crazy upcharge.

It is now run by Chef Jonny and his partner Will with the same concept of shopping at the local farmers market for his ingredients and just cooking up what he feels like making that day so there is no menu to speak of with the exception of the a la carte Colombian arepas that you can add for $8.  \n\nWith 3 seatings (6PM, 7:45PM, and 9:30PM) on Th-Sa (not sure if there are 2 or 3 for the others), it is not uncommon to be fully booked at this super small 12 seat eatery.

That aside the food was great.  The three of us ended up having the tasting menu along with sharing one of the arepas.\n\nThe first course was this super light salad.  Arugula tomatoes and a little bit of bacon for salt factor. the dressing was incredible and brought everything together.  It was one of the best salads I've had as even though I'm not a huge tomato fan, these tomatoes were very ripe and slightly sweet.\n\nThe second course was a chilled carrot soup.  I wasn't looking forward to trying it because when you mention it it is something that I would probably never order because it just sounds so boring and uninteresting.  That was until drug my spoon through this slightly thick puree and had the the bright and slightly spicy (I mean in more of a bit of coriander and curry spicy and not a heat spicy) soup awaken my tastebuds.  It was a perfect transition the  the arepa.  Growing up in Miami, I ate a lot of arepas  coming up but they were usually a rather boring corn pancake griddled with cheese between the two cakes.  This arepa, the Venezuelan version was unlike anything I've  ever had before.  The corn cake was very crispy and up against the the tender chicken.  The only problem I had with this dish is that I wanted the entire arepa to myself.\n\nThe third course was grilled shrimp with a bit of pesto and lardon (just to keep things appropriately especially not kosher).  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and you had that slight salt from the lardon, that was sliced so nicely that I initially thought it was cheese.\n\nThe last course was this delightful cream rounded out with some sweet figs and tart blackberries.  I'm not a big dessert guy but this one was a great and was just as I liked to have a dessert, sweet but not to sweet with a fruit element and a crunchy element.\n\nAll in all for what it's worth it is the perfect little quiet romantic spot that also as amazing prices.", "author": "Zorin D."}

I won't spend much time here, but it was a throwaway.  However, kudos to anyone, ever for serving me anchovies on a dish and making me NOT run for the hills.  Two stars.\n\nSecond course was my personal favorite, the arepa.  The sandwich (Colombian?  South American generally?  I'll admit, I don't know the history here, but I thought this address used to be another restaurant that served arepas regularly) was very tasty, on perfectly-cooked bread with fillings that warmed the heart and the soul.  Four stars.  At this point, I started to get excited...\n\nThird course:  steak, over a bed of corn.  Of the roughly four-ounce piece of steak served to me, two ounces was a wad of fat that I pushed off to the side.  The other half was tasty and the corn was just fine.  Three stars, but given that this was to be the money shot portion of the meal (at a place called, yes, \"Mr. Pollo\"), I was surprised that it wasn't chicken and that it was only okay.\n\nFourth course:  a block of blue cheese with a couple of pieces of stale sourdough bread.  While the cheese was fine, I took one bite of the cheese with the bread and gave the rest to my wife, who happily obliged eating the rest because she loves cheese with damn near anything.  Two stars.\n\nLoved the guy who was our server, one half of the owner combo who runs Mr. Pollo.

I didn't know what I was getting myself into. \n\nI'll let you know, if you are a picky eater (like myself) you are taking a risk by coming here. I got lucky and the fixed menu contained mostly edible dishes for my liking but the anchovies on our first course had me a little nervous.\n\nThe rest of our courses were small, but tasty. Nothing that blew my socks off, but all impressed on their own levels. The main course we got a rib eye with brussel sprouts and some red beet puree. It was cooked perfectly but only consisted of a couple bites of meat and a lot of gristle. Our dessert was a cheese plate with hot soft cheese, syrup, and walnuts to spread on sliced bread. We left full and satisfied, but it wasn't a place I would seek out again.\n\nIf you don't know already from exploring this page, this place is small! 12 seats, 3 sittings, reservations made via text message.

The sign outside reads \"Mr. Pollo 100% Savor Latino.\"  It's a lie, but in a good way.  \n\nThe place is intimate. 12 seats and a kitchen, no room for anything else. We sat at the counter for the dining with the Chef experience, and boy was it an experience.  Chef Johnny did give us fair warning that he liked to talk \"sh*t.\"  In between the stories of a chef's life and Eskimo Brothers T-shirts, he did reveal his passion for cooking and his approach.  The food did a lot of the speaking for him.\n\nDidn't really catch all the details on the food...\n\nCourse 1:  Salmon fishball soup\n\nThis was our getting to know each other phase and I wasn't quiet sure what to make of it yet.  It was a good soup a bit on the salty side, but it had depth.  There were little strands of cellaphane noodles inside that were invisible to the eye at first, but it gave the soup a good texture.  \n\nCourse 2:  Rice flour battered Calamari over a bed of Cucumber and Radish salad. \n\nThis dish was quite delicious.  The rice flour added flavor and texture to what normally would have just been a crispy batter. Instead it was thick and crunchy, yet light.  The cucumber and radish continued on with the crispy motif, and the sweet and spicy chili sauce was the perfect compliment to the saltiness of the calamari.  Satisfying and refreshing!\n\nArepa Intermission: \n\nThe Arepa is the one thing in this restaurant that lives up to its name and sign description.  There is no messing with a classic here.  The corn flatbread was cooked perfectly so that it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Once cut in half and fill with chicken and salad, it made for a heavenly delicious combination of flatbread, filling and sauce.  So good.  You can come in and request Arepas to go if its not too busy!\n\nCourse 3:  Louisiana style Shrimp and Grits\n\nThe heartiest dish of the night.  The grilled shrimp look so good as they were on top of the griddle, but when placed on the bed of grits (which were cooked perfectly) it became a culinary reality.  The gravy over the combination helped pull everything together in a dance of savory flavors.\n\nCourse 4: A coconut pudding dessert.\n\nIt came out green with lychee, coconut flesh and mango to top it off with a bit of red powder.  Chef Johnny explained why he made the dish green.  \"Sometimes people take things too seriously with all the natural crap.  I just wanted to make it green with food coloring because I like colorful desserts! (beep) all that healthy bs.\"\n\nThat was the end of the food.  $20 for 4 courses, and $8 for an Arepa to split.  It was one of the most entertaining food places I've been to in a while.  Sit at the counter if you can, you won't be disappointed.  \n\nCall to make reservations as their space is limited. 12 seats/3 seatings.\n\n What fronts its self as a place where the chicken man serves up 100% Latino flavors, reveals itself as a refined and purposeful dinning experience that not only gives you a glimpse of sf food, but also the people and culture!", "author": "Veasna H."}

I can't say anything he said to us publicly online.. but just talk to him. He has great stories and is pretty much an open book.\n\nBeen trying to go here forever - damn them for having such a tiny place! - and we finally lucked out on a Saturday night at 6:30pm when two others had just cancelled. Otherwise it's about an hour wait.\n\nEverything was really good but it didn't quite live up to the incredible hype. Some dishes were great, some were a bit off for me.\n\nCost: $80 total for two ($20 tasting menu, 1 arepa to share, 2 drinks), including tax & a generous tip. So pricier than you'd think for the $20 prix fixe, when you really make a meal out of it (they strongly suggest you get the arepa with the meal).\n\nTasting menu 1st course:\n* sweet & sour salmon soup - 2.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mr-pollo-san-francisco?select=cAjrKAGR9yLnY4Ha1pbqcA#cAjrKAGR9yLnY4Ha1pbqcA\nI'm just not a big fan of sweet & sour in general, and I found this to be a weird mix of flavors - there was macaroni and salmon and I didn't think it worked that great.

This was one of the most fun dining experiences I've had, period.\n\nFor my birthday yesterday, and my dinner date surprised me by taking me to this place. I had heard about one of their special menus from a friend a while ago, so I knew of the place, but didn't know what to expect in terms of greatness. I was overwhelmed.\n\nWalk in and I'm wearing a dress, and everyone else is wearing jeans and casual clothing, so I felt a little out of place. The restaurant is very unassuming, and pretty cramped, so these things combined made me feel like maybe my friend hadn't picked the right place for my 25th birthday dinner. But I was so, so wrong.\n\nStarted out with a bottle of prosecco and some conversation with the owner. The first course was a softboiled egg over a sweet potato puree with some kind of chorizo-like crumble and charred brussels sprouts. This was the highlight of the meal - the perfect oozing/runny yolk with the bitterness of the brussels sprouts and sweetness of the puree and greasy, umami flavor of the meat was incredible. One of my favorite dishes ever.\n\nSecond was a creamy broccoli soup with very small amount of blue cheese sauce drizzled on top, and this was fantastic as well. Even though there was very little sauce, the flavor of it came through perfectly with the blue cheese's strong tang. It didn't stand out in terms of creativity, but that didn't matter - it was a perfectly executed comfort dish. I also liked that they served it not piping hot, so you could focus on the flavors instead of the temperature.\n\nThird dish was also outstanding - the chicken arepa. I don't seek out chicken in my meals, but this blew me away. Some kind of quesadilla with toasted cheesy homemade tortilla, and some kind of sour creamy slaw mixed in with the shredded chicken. This also wasn't particularly hot, but I didn't mind, I liked the cold sour cream cutting through the other flavors. More wine, a Syrah, as recommended by owner.\n\nFourth course was good, but probably my least favorite of the savory. Two small pieces of pork served with guacamole and corn relish. Yummy, but preferred the others.\n\nDessert was a rose cheesecake. I was stuffed by this point but really enjoyed the flavor of the cheesecake.\n\nI should also mention by now that the owner has provided us with many shots. The 1st, for rescheduling our reservation (which wasn't an inconvenience to us). The 2nd, for it being my actual birthday. The third... heck I don't know. And the drinks after that and the whole place singing me happy birthday and hugging a lot of people... I was overwhelmed with fun and joy. It was a fantastic evening that I won't forget despite the drinking and... the other fun. I want to become a regular at this place and go every week when the menu changes. Thank you so much Mr. Pollo, and see you again soon! Can I bring you shots?", "author": "Sarah B."}

The starter was just okay, peaches are always good, but the quinoa was...just quinoa I guess, nothing special. The arepa was delicious, but you only get a half of one, which for around $40 a person once all is said and done is a little scant. The tilapia had ramen noodles, corn, and what I can only assume was the chicken flavored cup'o'noodle powder on it, because that is exactly what it tasted like. The watermelon sorbet was watermelon sorbet, no surprises. \n\nIt seems like these dudes charge a premium for something that isn't all that special, they seemed rad so I hope they continue making money.

Boy am I glad I returned because I'm updating a 1-star review (which in retrospect is blasphemy) to a 5-star! \n\nAs you may know, the menu has upped the price to $20 (previously $15) for a 4-course prix-fixe menu, which rotates based on whatever fresh ingredients are available to the chef. It's still an amazing value for this meal. The ingredients were obviously fresh, the flavors were sophisticated and a delicious take on Latin fusion, which is something I don't see often in the Mission. I was satisfied but not overly full after this meal, I don't think you should come starving but if you do, you can always head over to Mission Pie like I did and have a slice :) Note: They serve wine and beer now.\n\n* Course 1: Arugula Salad w/Balsamic Reduction [5 STARS]: The arugula was fresh and definitely not something off the racks of the Mexican grocer down the street. The combination of sweet balsamic reduction, ripe melons, and chunky sea salt and pepper (not sure what else was in there) made this dish smart and delicious. It was a refreshing way to start a meal.\n\n* Course 2: Fatty Salmon Belly w/Ginger Sauce [5 STARS]: Fatty salmon belly - where have you been all my life?? The combination of flavors was amazing, even the zucchini was perfect.\n\n* Chicken Arepa ($8) [5 STARS]: This famed dish is everything that people said it would be. I don't even like corn tortillas or corn anything, but this crunchy concoction of chicken cheese and who knows what else was rich but scrumptious. \n\n* Course 3: Beef Tenderloin w/Wasabi over Coconut Basil Noodles [4 STARS] - Wow, the beef was ridiculously tender and the sauces were made with love. I'm not a big wasabi fan and this flavor profile was not really for me. \n\n* Course 4: Grilled peaches topped w/granola and honey [4 STARS] - Such a simple but smart concept, and each element was top-notch so the execution was perfect. It was a light and refreshing way to end a meal. \n\nThe service was stellar and unpretentious, it was amazing how humble and friendly such a popular restaurant remains unlike certain other places (AHEM Monk's Kettle).

I really have to thank Chris Cosentino for putting this hidden gem in the Mission on the map.  If I hadn't seen it on TV, I probably would have never considered going here.\n\nSo what makes this place unique is how the Chef and owner Manny Torres Gimenez goes out shopping every morning at the local farmers markets for his ingredients and then whatever he finds, he cooks for his tasting menu.  This is really cool because this means that the tasting menu will almost always be different every day.  And he cooks it right in front of you!  Mr. Pollo is really a two man operation with the Chef and the Server for a spot that seats only 12 customers.  It makes for a really intimate dining experience.\n\nUnfortunately, Chef Manny wasn't in the night I went, but his substitute (Chef Jonny) cranked out some really amazing dishes.  I opted for the 4 course tasting menu (only $20) and also had a bonus 5th course since I had a deal on Blackboard Eats.  And of course, I had to try the Arepa ($5) which everyone's been raving about.\n\nAs for what I had from the tasting menu, I can't go and list every ingredient because each course had a complex set of ingredients based on what the server said.  Basically I suck at listening and couldn't make out everything he said.  So I'll just give a general description.\n\nFirst course: Arugala Salad with fresh fruit and some bacon\n(http://bit.ly/V4wJTP)\n\nSecond course:  Green Beans and Roasted Purple Potatoes\n(http://bit.ly/TYU6z2)\n\nChicken Arepa\n(http://bit.ly/Oyw1g8)\n\nThird course:  Seared Lamb with Squash Salad\n(http://bit.ly/PQS1zX)\n\n4th course:  Duck Breast Risotto\n(http://bit.ly/R6h4hE)\n\nBonus course:  Grilled Prawn w/ Roasted Peppers\n(http://bit.ly/PQS6nd)\n\nAll in all.  Everything was good!  I was really surprised by the Lamb because I'm not really fond of lamb, yet this preparation tasted really good to me.  If i have to pick out my favs out of the bunch it'd have to be the Duck Breast Risotto and the Chicken Arepa.  OMG you have to try the Chicken Arepa!  The chicken had a lot of flavor with the cheese and the ground corn bread had a nice crunch to it.  It's like a crunchy pupusa!   If you're in the area, I would get an Arepa for lunch, and then come back for the tasting menu for dinner.\n\nWhether it be for a quick lunch or an awesome dinner, I highly recommend you go and try Mr. Pollo.

The place is tiny, it's literally a hole in the wall that probably seats less than 10 people. The menu is constantly changing and Jonny will make whatever he finds fresh at the market. The highlight of the night was definitely the Chicken Arepa. The chicken had tons of flavor and the flatbread was nice and crispy. I could have ordered more of that. My friend and I ended up having a couple beers after our meal and shooting the shit with Jonny.

It's like having dinner in their dining room.  I ate there this past Friday and as I was dining alone got to sit at the counter and talk to the chef as he was cooking.  The owner and chef do this as a passion, certainly not for fame or fortune.  For a total of $50, I got four courses and two glasses of wine.  Tomato basil soup, chicken arepa, lamb loin with celery root puree and kale and dulce de leche ice cream with pomegranate whipped cream!  Everything was delicious and an whole different experience than going to one of the hundreds of trendy, expensive restaurants in the city.  Thank you both for the fantastic experience!\n\nSaw another review that dissed the ska playing during their visit.

Mr. Pollo is a small 12-seat restaurant right across the street from the 24th Street Bart station, where I had to text in order to make a reservation - super easy and convenient. My husband and I had dinner with our friends (another couple), and we were handed a drink menu. The server suggested a glass of red, but didn't disclose much about our dinner tasting menu to keep the surprise factor. We opened with a bowl of chestnut soup - delectable and festive. Next, we had the traditional chicken arepa - probably the best arepa we've ever had. Our main was perfectly tender and cooked steak with green beans and sweet potato pur\u00e9e - filling and perfectly paired. Lastly, we closed with lemon sorbet topped with candied ginger - large scoop and palate cleansing. The restaurant is cash only, so be sure to bring enough. But, it ended up being no more than $40/person including a drink (excluding tax & tip). We highly recommend this dining experience!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-23", "description": "Mr. Pollo is the epitome of what I would call \"Gourmet Ghetto\", locally sourced ingredients artfully turned into elegant fare served in a cramped, divey space with Tupac, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and Warren G softly bellowing in the background. \n\nAfter seeing Chef Chris Cosentino devouring a 4-Course Chef's Tasting Menu on Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate  - Bang for your Buck\", it further reinforced WHY I should I come to Mr. Pollo.  For $15, I had nothing to lose especially when it's just a fraction of the amount I usually spend when dining out with friends.\n\nWhen the clock striked 5 PM on Tuesday, I scurried out of the office and headed to Mr. Pollo so my friend and I could secure a seat for the 6 PM seating. We arrived a little before 5:30 PM and we were first in line. Mr. Pollo is a tiny with a maximum capacity for 12 people; four tables and counter seating for two. There are two seatings a night; 6 PM and 8 PM. And, as many other Yelpers have stated, you should come 30 minutes before opening if you want to secure a seating for the first dinner session at 6 PM. At 5:59 PM, Manny, Chef & Owner and his Sous Chef arrived to open up shop but had some bad news; because of the hot weather, the restaurant wasn't going to open until 7 PM so we grabbed a drink at Quickly several doors down and returned a little before then.\n\nMr. Pollo is where all the hipster foodies flock to. And with the Food Network putting Mr. Pollo on the map, it drew people from all over the Bay Area; among the diners were a family from Fresno and a Napa Valley Chef and his GF. With all the rave reviews and media publications about Mr. Pollo, we were anticipating a 5 STAR foodie experience; however, the dishes were a hit or miss.\n\nMy friend and I both got the 4-Course Chef's Tasting Menu ($15) which changes daily based on what Manny gets at the Farmer's Market. If you're starving and/or have a moderate to big appetite, the Chef's Tasting Menu will not suffice, so it's best to get an Arepa or an Empanada as well. We opted for the Emapanada ($1.50).\n\nCHEF'S TASTING MENU - 6.21.11 (Prepared by Manny's Sous Chef)\n1) GRILLED TROUT w/ Creme Fraiche, Cavier & Sugar Snapped Peas - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s_ni_uFL3rczrNiGQmyXHw?select=7dz590mbrSrS340jnv8BZg\nPerfectly grilled, the skin was crispy and the trout was flakey and moist. The cr\u00e8me friache gave it a creamy acidic tang while the cavier gave it a burst of saltiness. The crisp sugar snapped peas brightened the dish adding a fresh sweetness. \n\n2) CACHAPAS w/ Cheese & Summer Squash Topped w/ Smoked Applewood Salt! - 5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s_ni_uFL3rczrNiGQmyXHw?select=tb06X3kwytkFPxaAyuYx8g\nDefinitely, the STAR of the night, the chachapas (yellow corn pancake) had a crunchy surface with a soft, fluffy center. The sweetness of the yellow corn melded perfectly with the savory and salty cheese. The thin slices of squash was super fresh and had a tender crisp to them. The sprinkle of smoked applewood salt was the icing on the cake giving it a subtle smoky flavor.\n\n3) GRILLED BEEF w/ House Smoked Beans & Avocado Foam - 3.5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s_ni_uFL3rczrNiGQmyXHw?select=sOIpyZQbzmJ96tDTqXkigA\nAlthough well-seasoned with a garlic spice mix, the beef was overcooked to a tough, chewy doneness. The house-smoked beans didn't fair so well either as they were a little undercooked. However, the avocado foam was genius adding an airy richness to the dish. \n\n4) BRAISED DUCK LEG w/ Cilantro Rice & Pickled Carrot - 2.5 STARS!\n(As much as food porn photographers we are, my friend and I were too caught up chatting with the couple next to us and forgot to take a pic.)\nThe piece of the duck leg was braised to a fall-of-the-bone tenderness but was very bland. The cilantro rice had the consistency of an al-dente risotto which I wasn't keen on. The dish in its entirety was missing a depth of flavor.  \n\n*BEEF & POTATO EMPANADA w/ Cilantro Cream Sauce - 3 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s_ni_uFL3rczrNiGQmyXHw?select=xNj3wo7iA7AFM4FyGYSMmQ\nI prefer my empanada with a flakey pastry crust and Mr. Pollo's empanada is made with a thick wonton-like wrapper. When deep fried, it had a stiff hearty crunch. The ground beef and potato mixture fell flat as it was underseasoned but the cilantro cream sauce did save it adding a creamy tanginess. \n\n*COMPLIMENTARY HOUSEMADE BLUEBERRY ICE CREAM - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s_ni_uFL3rczrNiGQmyXHw?select=TSSE4hBagAkJfKSTqZ66qA\nThe ice cream was like eating a frozen mousse; it was super creamy and airy. Full of berry flavor with a subtle tartness, it was perfect on this warm summer day. \n\nYou can tell Manny has an immense passion for what he does; offering a taste of Latin America with a gourmet twist in a casual, non-pretentious environment for those trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents. But, I can't help but wonder how MUCH better the food would have been if Manny himself cooked that night...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Then the legendary chicken arepa, seemed so simple to make with few ingredients, but tasted good with all the right textures. I mean, what did they put in that dough?

Mr. Pollo is really one of those rare finds, a gem we could easily miss because the place presents itself  so poorly and is situated in a part of town ruled by giant burritos and ice cream, not prix fixe gourmet.  Take it from Chef Cosentino of Incanto fame, who summed up the experience on the Food Network.\n\nIn a food loving town like San Francisco, most of us have been pleasantly surprised by good food from a hole in the wall.  But Chef Manny Torres Gimenez takes it a step further.  He is offering seriously  good cooked to order gourmet meals, including -- get this -- a four course tasting menu for $15.  Nope, not a typo.\n\nThe restaurant, if you can call it that, is not much bigger than a walk-in closet.  If you have a party of five, forgetaboutit.  Even for a party of two, you'd have to bump elbows with your neighbors.  None of that mattered when I tried the Meat Arepa.  Absolutely fantastic.  The arepa had perfect texture, wonderful aroma, and lively flavors.  The meat was very juicy and tender and it blended perfectly with all the other roasted stuff in it that I can't describe.  I felt guilty paying just $6.50 for it.  The yuca was perfectly fried and served so hot, I couldn't even eat it for three minutes.  Honestly, I would have preferred a thinner cut so the insides have slightly more flavor.  Nonetheless, very good stuff.\n\nI can't complete a review without a sentence or two about Chef Manny.  Once you walk past those ugly thick black curtains, he'll greet you with a smile...you know, not the kind of smile one would politely give a  customer, but the kind you just feel comes from a genuinely nice man.  The man exudes so much positive energy that you immediately fall at ease knowing that you're in good hands.  We call him Chef Manny, but he's also the busboy, dishwasher, waiter, and cashier.  This guy not only knows what he's doing, he's quite passionate about it.  You can tell from the look on his face and in the way his dishes look, feel, and taste.\n\nFair warning though.  If you're really hungry, do not go for the tasting menu.  The portions, while delicious, are small, especially the first few items, then you'll have to wait another 15-20 minutes for the next one (depending on how busy he is).  It is, after all, a \"tasting\" menu.  For $15, you should have enough to grab a taco from El Farolito next door before heading in.  Go for the dinner plate instead.  But apart from the tasting menu, you will get a healthy sized meal for under $9.  Also, Chef Manny really takes his time cooking the meals.  He has one sidekick sous chef, so a long wait time is inevitable.  \n\nI am 100% certain that I will be back.", "author": "Angel S."}

The leg and thigh piece was fried up with a twist of Latin American spice and style. \n\nThe chicken was incredibly moist and tasty. The sides were fresh and very powerful with taste. \n\n\nMy meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s_ni_uFL3rczrNiGQmyXHw?select=SuhgLDJ8p8uw3QaVmqj90A\n\nAlong with my meal, I also added a $3.50 glass of freshly squeezed Maracuya juice. The Brazilian Passionfruit drink was made fresh with the loud blender. And that drink tasted very refreshing combine with my outstanding meal.\n\nMy drink:   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/s_ni_uFL3rczrNiGQmyXHw?select=eWn61nf0gy_0Xg40jvesNw\n\nMy meal was prepared by, executive chef and owner Manuel Torres Jimenez, who does all the cooking and buying. The very nice man allows me to watch him in his small kitchen and cook and perform my meal. A job well done, Mr. Jimenez!\n\nMany of you who have been following my reviews know that I infrequently go to finer restaurants to eat. I did and I deserved it.

So if you get here when they open and the cut off is before you, then you'll have to come back in about 2 hours because most people will be coming here for the tasting menu. Plan accordingly! \n\nThey try really hard at the decor even though it is really hard to spice up a small hole in the wall. A nice mirror, clock, etc really does help to make the place match the fancy food you're eating. One bathroom. Spacious and I love the sea shells at the bottom of the sink. \n\nNow to the fun part, the food\n\nThe food was amazing! I loved each dish immensely. I felt like I was in a fancy restaurant. I love how much thought he placed into each dish. The flavors went well together. Fresh produce. If I had 5 hours of free time a night and more money I wouldn't mind coming back here all time. \n\nThe dessert is a souffle is well worth it so when the waiter ask you about it get it!

I have walked by Mr. Pollo a million times and never thought twice about going inside. The windows are covered by black curtains and the sign makes it look like every other burrito shack on the block. But it is oh so much more than that.\n\nThe concept is great - two guys run the entire place. The Chef (Jonny) and the server/bartender/reservation man (Will). They are only open for dinner, and if you want to make a reservation (which you should because it seats maybe 12 people) you just send a text to Will. The food is high end - but the ambiance is so laid back. They played reggae music the entire time and you'll find decor like a Mona Lisa painting in an astronaut suit. Not to mention the prices are super affordable! I didn't take any pictures on purpose because it's the type of thing you need to experience first hand!\n\nWe split a bottle of Syrah suggested by Will, which was delicious. There is a 4 course tasting menu that varies by the week and it's always a surprise. Since the place is so intimate, you get to watch Jonny cook and plate everything - which is done beautifully! They always have chicken arepas which you can order in addition to the tasting menu, and definitely do! They are so delicious... it was my favorite dish.\n\n1st course - slow cooked egg with grilled veggies, sunflower seeds, truffle sauce\n2nd course - nettle soup with sesame seeds and a creme fraiche\n3rd course - chicken arepa\n4th course - celery root puree (who knew how delicious that'd be), green beans and a juicy med-rare steak\n5th course - most amazing Lavender cheesecake in the world with a side of brownie\n\nI'm seriously blown away.

Jamie W. and I were looking to change our game up and not go to our perennial favorite, El Zocalo, this past week. We wondered if we could honestly trade pupusas for arepas in our palates as our stomachs produced grumbling sounds that had a distinct mariachi beat. Alas, we landed at Mr. Pollo when I noticed it as we passed by on the scarifying MUNI-14.\n\nWe noticed the rosy Yelp ratings, so we decided to try it. First of all, I was taken aback by the fact that it's a lot smaller than Mariah Carey's walk-in lingerie closet. I saw it on Oprah once and was perplexed why she couldn't just label her panties with the days of the week in order to avoid buying piles of lingerie. Back to Mr. Pollo. Three little tables for two, a party table for four, and two stools at the counter. That's it. Barely enough room to squeeze into the restroom.\n\nHowever, this is not the shocker, the red herring I've been hinting at. That comes with the unexpected gourmet dinners offered by the young chef behind the counter, Manny Torres Gimenez, a chipper guy whom you could well imagine appearing on a competitive reality show very soon on the Food Network. For a mind-bending ten bucks, you can get a meat entree and three sides. Choices include beef, pork, lamb and even goat. Both of us ordered the Lamb Shank with Yuca, Plantains and Organic Salad.\n\nDelicious. Surprisingly well turned for what I thought was going to be just a standard Mission hole-in-the-wall. It's obvious that Manny takes great pride and care in his preparation of each meal. It does take a while since he is the only one in the place and creates every dish from scratch. Luckily, we had recently experienced the \"War and Peace\"-level marathon wait at the Russian Family Bistro in San Bruno, so it didn't feel that long at all. In fact, the wait is well worth what you get (see photo). Coming back very soon.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...Manny is an artist in a very small space\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...well, I imagine you can always get it to go if the tables are packed which I assume is often on the weekends\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...Manny does it all\nTOTAL - 5 stars...oops, I forgot about the arepa...oh well, maybe some other time", "author": "Ed U."}

Out came the tasting menu, but as dishes started coming out, I was surprised that there only ended up being one chicken dish (and the only dish that we actually ordered that wasn't part of the tasting menu).

This was my favorite of the bunch.\n\nDish four, and the main entree was a lamb dish with baby bok choy served over a bed of rice in broth.

The menu for the day is whatever he feels like making from whatever he picked up at the market.\n\nMy friend and I were fortunate enough to be the only customers here during lunch in the afternoon, so we got to talking with him. He is very passionate about his cooking, and likes to try out different cuisine fusion combinations, especially since he is open to many foods. The majority of his combinations work very well.\n\nAmong my favorite dishes was his polenta, lamb, and tomato-based vegetable medley. The polenta was creamy and tasty (although I wished it had a bit more corn taste), and the mixture of spices in the vegetables were spot on. I also liked the cornmeal arepa, which was perfectly seared on the outside, making the bites melty and crispy at the same time, like well-done tempura. I wasn't so impressed with his dessert, which was Greek yogurt with rose-citrus-infused rice noodles, and fruit on top. It was a bit too sweet for me (I'm not famous here for my sweet tooth) and wasn't a fan of the texture of the noodles.\n\nOtherwise, great meal.

Based on the quality to value quotient, this place gets 5 stars. Based on the level of dishes and service that hit the level of five stars, regardless of the cost, I would give this place a two. So I went with 4 stars. \n\nLet's be honest, there's a lot of cheap ass people out there. Just go to Chapeau during their first turn of the night and you'll catch my drift. There is nothing wrong with value, but when it comes in the guise that Mr. Pollo represents, the saying \"you get what you pay for\" may or may not ring true based on your expectations. \n\nThe Arepas are always incredible. The Latin centric offerings are delish, but the more modern takes on their price fixed meal are shall I say, chintzy. Not to say I've ever had anything that was bad here, just not life affirmingly delicious (other then the aforementioned Arepas). Portions too small, flavors that don't truly pop, and suspect ingredients. \n\nAgain I am not wearing my quality to value hat. I'm coming from the world of gastronomy, which when faced with a chef's tasting menu, regardless of the cost, must ask the question, \"is this the best that chef can execute for me?\"  In this case yes, and if you aren't happy with it then the saying goes, \"you get what you paid for.\"", "author": "Chris K."}

Smoky and a little bit of spice. The clams were cooked well, not chewy. Flavorful and hearty. \nCourse 2: Roasted mushroom and tomato bruschetta with arugula and balsamic vinaigrette. \nNice umami transition!  I love mushrooms so this was definitely for me.

It's not a typical hole in the wall Mexican/Salvadorean joint. It's not a cheesy El Pollo Loco-type restaurant with rotisserie chicken and tex-mex cuisine. \n\nMr. Pollo is like going over to a friend's restaurant for dinner: a friend that has dope taste in music and has that effortless talent of throwing together unique ingredients to make interesting dishes. And because the restaurant only sits about 12 people, you almost feel like you're in someone's home with your own personal chef. The close quarters and the open kitchen definitely create a very casual, yet intimate atmosphere. \n\nFirst, the price is really unbeatable. $20 for a 4 course meal!!!!! In SF! (mind explodes). And these are much bigger portions than you think you're going to get for that price! Of course, don't expect Michelin quality food. The style of cooking is simple and unpretentious.\n\nSecond, I really enjoyed the chef's tasting menu. Each course combined interesting ingredients in a unique way... playing with texture and familiar flavors from across the spectrum of cuisines. Here's what I had (although I'm told the menu changes weekly):\n\n1. Salad greens in a mustard vinaigrette, topped with satsuma tangerines, pears, goat cheese, and sunflower seeds. (\"Californian\")\n2. Soup with red snapper, jicama, hominy, corn, sesame seeds, and sesame oil (\"Mexican\")\n3. Pork loin, plantains, kale, and rainbow beets (\"Puerto Rican\")\n4. Vanilla pudding with rosewater syrup, pistachios, and figs (\"Middle Eastern\")\n\nThird, THAT AREPA DOE... mmmm, definitely the highlight of our meal. The arepa was HUGE for $8 and so good. The closest thing I've ever had to this was probably a Mexican torta. Juicy, flavorful chunks of chicken, salsa, and veggies topped with a tasty aioli sauce and sandwiched between some kind of flat bread/corn cake/crack concoction. I could come back here just for this alone. \n\nMy husband and I cannot get over how much we enjoyed the meal, the service... really the entire experience. 2 hours after getting home, I already texted a girlfriend to return next week!", "author": "Monelle A."}

He works with simple ingredients but cooks and arranges everything beautifully to highlight the components in every dish. I was slightly disappointed when the main entree came out - polenta and fried egg, I guess I expected something more substantial - but was still delicious for what it was. It's really like going over to a friend's for a casual/romantic dinner, just don't expect anything way over the top.\n\nI would highly recommend the arepa. It would be a good idea to split one with one other person, since it comes loaded with chicken, cheese, and cilantro sauce.\n\nIt's a small restaurant (seats 12), so be sure to make a reservation if you plan to come here for dinner. There were two seating times for Friday evening, one at 6:00pm and 7:45pm.\n\nVery friendly service when I went. The menu changes often, so for the bargain price of a well-crafted dinner, I'll definitely be coming back soon.", "author": "Peter V."}

We took seats at the bar, and I didn't feel like I was dining at a restaurant at all. Instead I felt more like I was in a friend's kitchen, keeping him company as he cooked for a dinner party!\n\nJust like dinner at a friend's house, Mr. Pollo fits about 15 people total and is BYOB. We brought a 6-pack, and they let us keep the unopened bottles in their fridge. When we were ready for another, they would beer us!\n\nJust like dinner at a friend's house, you can watch Manny and Chris passionately prepare, cook, plate, describe, and serve the dishes. (Yes, I'm on a first name basis with the chef & host... just like I would be at a friend's house.) The 4-course tasting menu (now $20 instead of $15) is still BEYOND a great bang for your buck. I asked Manny how often the menu changes and he said TWICE a day, so unlike the food, my description of the dishes won't be much of a value. However, I will say that every course was fresh, vibrant, creative, beautifully presented, and perfectly cooked. Be sure to get the bonus arepa at the end!\n\nJust like dinner at a friend's house, Manny and Chris will join in on your conversation. They were shy at first and apologized for interrupting, but soon they were comfortable and extremely easy going and easy to speak to. When the course of fish was being served, I noticed there were portions with and without fins. I received a plate without fins, but I casually mentioned that I loved the fins. Manny overhead me and gave me and my date extra full portions with fins! I totally did not expect him to do that, but just like dinner at a friend's house, you will be well fed. \n\nLastly, just like dinner at a friend's house, Mr. Pollo will turn up the tunes-- and they are straight up Top 40s dance mix JAMS. I may or may not have been 2-stepping in my seat inbetween bites with a fork and knife in my hands...\n\nAt the end of our dinner, one of the tables started to applaud the chef, and without thinking twice, we all chimed in. You know you're doing something right when your entire restaurant cheers for you at the end of a meal. Next time I'm in San Francisco, you can bet I'll be back to Mr. Pollo for a dinner party with friends!", "author": "Nicole C."}

Came back at 9:15pm and lucked out that there was space for the two of us.  The four course tasting menu was fabulous.  For dinner for two, we each had a tasting menu and split the Chicken Arepa sandwich.  It's a perfect amount of food -- all of which was delicious.\n\nWe started with an excellent fall salad with persimmons, pomegranates, and smoked salt.  We had butternut squash soup for our second course.  Everyone makes this soup in the fall, but it's for a good reason.  This soup had great flavor and was hearty without actually being heavy.  \n\nWe had a fried frog's leg for the fourth course.  My first frog leg!  I had avoided them historically, not because I was scared to try them but because I always found something else that looked good to eat.  With no alternative, I dove in.  The taste is similar to chicken and this preparation left it extremely moist.  The sauces were fabulous and the meat allowed them to shine, if only I could remember what they were!\n\nWe took a plate break to eat our Chicken Arepa sandwich.  This was heavenly.  It's so simple, but the flavors are balanced and bright.  The cherry tomatoes in it really brighten the sandwich.  It's light enough that I might consider ordering two for lunch...\n\nFourth course was gigantes beans with ribeye.  This was the best course of the night.  The beans were hearty and the meat was deliciously tender.  I could have eaten this as a meal on it's own, except then I would have missed out on all the other treats.\n\nAll in all, this place rocks.  I'll definitely be back -- soon!", "author": "Polly M."}

How excited was I when I was temporarily transferred to the area! I visited this location several years ago (yes, I know a bit late. I'm trying to catch up!) and had the pleasure of having Chef John prepare me something from what they gathered from the farmer's market that morning for lunch. That's the best thing about this place. They create whatever they feel like from whatever fresh ingredients they gathered that day (or weekend). The location is tiny (maybe 4 tables inside and two outside) and you get to watch the chef prepare your dishes pretty much right next to you. Me and other diners just chatted away with Chef John as he prepped and made it a very cool and intimate experience. How often do you get to do that while you dine? I had only been able to write a brief memo while I ate, so I do apologize that it's not more in depth. Chef John whipped up the following for me:\n\nSalad: red lettuce and buds topped with Venezuelan cheese and grapes\nChicken arepa (Venezuelan corn cakes): had crunchy masa with tender chicken (which they're famous for as well as their empanadas)\nBay Scallops: lightly seared scallops with cilantro, garlic puree, onion sprouts, tobiko, and purple cauliflower\n\nEverything was so fresh and nicely prepared. Unfortunately, my lunch time was up and I had to leave early and was unable to try the last course (I felt horrible and definitely wanted to enjoy the entire meal =( ). I hope to go back to be able to experience the whole thing again.\n\nI do suggest calling in as I've been told they can get a long line (especially on the weekends).", "author": "Kitty K."}

I am shocked that anyone would give this place less that 5 stars. I would give it ten if it let me. First of all, it's $25 for dinner. A steal when you leave incredibly full. I'm almost never able to finish dessert, though it is always inspired and beautiful. The place looks kind of dumpy from the outside (it's in the heart of the Mission---enough said). But, if you end up scoring a seat inside, what unfolds is nothing short of wonderful. \nSeatings are done three times per night and the place only holds about twelve people at a time which means that you're a total dick if you cancel last minute or are late showing up. Especially since everything is done via text. \nThe two guys who run the place, Johhny and Will are seriously cool. Go twice and they will genuinely treat you like a regular. \nAs for the quality of the food, I've had everything from shark to lamb to rabbit. All perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned.

Who knew there was such a gourmet spot disguised in a chicken suit?? I came with 5 friends for dinner and we all opted for the 4-course dinner for $20. The guys that run this place are incredibly chill and made sure we went across the street to get our own bottles of alcohol while we waited for our first course. Apparently there are only a couple of seatings per night, with the first one starting at 6pm. If they fill up (and the place is really small, seating only 10-12 people at once), then you have to wait for the 2nd seating which starts around 7:30pm. So you definitely want to get there a bit early. \n\nWe all got the following: sweet potato and leek soup, fried salmon with brocollli and salsa, new york steak strips with cauliflower puree, and a thing with pork and seasoned rice that I can't really remember. All portion sizes are more like tastings - don't expect to come here and leave absolutely busting from the gut. What you will get is a decent sized tasting for the price. Yes, you probably would be more full if you spent $20 at a Mr. Pollo that was actually a KFC in disguise.

Great value, tasty and high quality foods, unique environment, intimate service, up-close-and-personal experience! \n\nThe place opens at 6pm, but show up early if you want to make the first shift at 6pm.  Once the place fills up (the little hole in the wall seats about 13-15 people I think), you'll probably have to wait at least an hour and a half for the next shift because it takes that long for you to eat a meal here.  So if you miss the 6pm shift, come back around 7:30pm at the earliest.  \n\nNext, the two men who run this place (Manny and the chef, Chris*) are amazing.  Great hosts, excellent chefs.  We went on a Thursday, and Chris did all the cooking.  Chris, you are efficient, awesome, an amazing cook, and I think I have a little crush on you now!  I LOVE YOUR FOOD, I LOVE YOUR STYLE. \n\nAnyway, onto the foods!\n\nWhich are so completely fantabulous!\n\nWe each started with an appetizer.  I got the empanada, my foodmate ordered a cheese arepa.  Each item was $1.50.  I dig that.  The empanada was delicious!  Crispy, hot, yumminess outside, and some sort of light white sauce.  A perfect little starter.  The cheese arepa was a good combination of savory cheesiness with a sweeter dough.  It's like a pupusa, but smaller.  I'd recommend both, but the empanada was best.\n\nWe each decided on the $15 tasting menu (what a STEAL!), which has four courses.  I asked Chris what was on the menu tonight, and he said \"Whatever I wanna cook.\"  Talk about freshness!  Different menu items every night!\n\nCourse 1 was a Maine lobster broth, with slices of summer squash and veggies.  Flavorful, light, vegetably, strong lobster flavors, and a great start to the meal.  Course 2 was a beef salad, on grilled asparagus, with a small slice of potato, and some nectarines.  Wow, what a yummy course! The grilled beef was delicious! Lots of different flavors and textures, and the nectarines were a nice touch. Course 3 was a slice of duck breast, on a crisp piece of sweet potatoes, with some parsnip sauce and a sliced cherry.  The duck was fatty and cooked well.  The cherries added a nice tartness.  Overall, I approve!  Finally, course 4 was a deep-fried piece of pork on a bed of veggies and some beans (forgot what the bean's called - it looks like a fava bean but it's beige).  The sauce was superb for this course.\n\nOverall, an awesome meal, well worth the $15.  What I really loved was that there were so many different flavors and colors and tastes; each course was unique and beautiful too.  \n\nI also enjoyed the experience of just sitting in the tiny space and watching Chris cook the meal from behind the glass.  It's always fun watching good chefs cook, I only wish I could sit at the bar and get a front seat.  \n\nFor about $20, this was such a solid, tasty, all-around GOOD meal.  There will most definitely be a next time!  And maybe next time we WILL get a front seat!\n\n*Actually, I'm not sure if the chef's name is Chris. I just assumed it was Chris from all the reviews.

We added an arepa that had a garlic cilantro chicken mixture, would recommend adding it and splitting between two people given the amount of food. \n\nThe intimate set-up of the restaurant with only a few tables and a couple of stools for bar seating is what makes this place special - diners can watch the food being prepared and discuss with the owners and chefs easily. Each person has a remarkable amount of attention during the experience which ensures the food (and great wine) is served promptly and to their liking, and there is absolutely nothing snobby about it despite the popularity and scarcity of seating.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, the music and art adds to the quirky but relaxed ambiance and really enjoyed having conversations with the owners/chefs.

Additionally, Mr. Pollo refuses to market AT ALL--no business cards, local ads, paper menus, signs in the window, nothing, because he says he doesn't want \"the wrong people\" to come (only true foodies who have found him legitimately! Or...anyone who uses Yelp...), yet he was featured on the Food Network's \"The Best Thing I Ever Ate.\" \n\nAnyway, all that means is Mr. Pollo is worth checking out.

Then we wait.\n\nThe third table was given to two enthusiastic ladies who's as excited as we are to see what's showing up on our table.  We chatted a bit and the atmosphere is relaxing and eclectic.  We got a large table of 5 Asian customer, an older gentleman at the bar, a couple (us) and two girlfriends catching up with each other on a Monday night.\n\nFirst plate is up, it's a good portion appetizer with roasted red potato, grilled asparagus with purple yam paste and a creamy light pesto like sauce.  I gobbled it up in 5 min.  The second course to my sup rise is a  foie gras dish. Combine with shitaki mushroom, more asparagus and parsnip mash, this is a winner dish.  Although the fie Grass piece was tiny, it was perfectly matched.  A slice of pickled kumquat also add a very nice touch to this dish.  As I looked around and see the waiter collecting plate, there are no leftover for sure, everyone cleaned their plate up.\n\nIn between the third course, we got our are pa!  It's a huge piece and Manny cut it in half for us.  It's a heaven combination of fresh farmer market veggie with cheese in between two interesting texture corn pancake.  \n\nThen we got the 1/2 shrimp:)  I see other reviews about this dish.  I personally love it.  I don't really care about the portion myself but freshness is important to me.  I can taste this seafood is not in the frozen section and the fact that the head is attached to the body, this half a shrimp taste much better than some of the garlic shrimp that I have in many tequrilla in Mission district.  Not to mention it comes with insanely great fried combo - Brussels sprouts and eggplant!  SO YUMMY.  My bf's vegetarian version is with cauliflower, equally as good.\n\nLast course was a piece of chicken with Latin risotto:)  I love the fried parsley garnish.  \n\nWaiter is friendly, good is really good.  Manny is a quiet chef who doesn't talk much.  As soon as he finished the last course, he head out for a break.  We didn't have dessert and I was full after my 'tasting' meal.  \n\nOverall a great experience.  I recommend all my friends to try this out.  If you can be adventurous and not having many restriction on your diet, this is a spot to visit!", "author": "Alice L."}

People told me what to expect, but you don't quite understand until you get there.\n\nMr. Pollo is a tiny closet of a restaurant that seats around 10 people. My cousin Griselda D and I arrived just after the 6pm opening time. \n\nWe asked Chris (executive chef Manny's business partner) to surprise us, as we didn't want to order off a menu. Their menu rotates daily, so if you want to be adventurous and sample a variety of Manny's culinary work, you should opt for the $15 tasting menu. You won't know what's coming until it hits your table - a little mystery makes the meal more exciting :) \n\n\nManny made us:\n- Seared goat loin w/ seared carrots and zucchini\n- Monterey Bay squid arepa: The arepa is similar to a pupusa. It's a masa shell w/ squid, red onion and red peppers in a creamy pesto-like sauce. The arepa was, without question, the star of the tasting menu.\n- Giant fresh water blue prawn served over a bed of white rice w/ walnut and wild arugula sauce\n- Organic beef & broccoli with seared eggplant\n\nFor dessert we opted for a fontina and creme brulee souffle w/ maracuya ice cream. It was pure DECADENCE! It tasted like creme brulee bread pudding (if such a thing existed) w/ maracuya (Brazilian passionfruit) ice cream. This dish takes 25 minutes to bake, so let them know ahead of time so they can pop it in the oven for you.\n\nWe washed it all down with a bottle of Petit Sirah that I brought from home. Currently, Mr. Pollo allows BYOB with no corkage fee because they are awaiting their liquor license :)\n\nBecause Manny makes each dish himself, you should be prepared to stay for 2-3 hours. It's definitely an experience. I advise that you go with someone you can hold a conversation with because there will be some downtime. \n\nBy the time we left, the house was packed. Word travels quickly, and this place is getting alot of buzz, so I suggest checking them out before they get even more crowded.\n\nYou will NOT be disappointed!", "author": "Mariela D."}

The frog legs were super tiny and stringy. The chicken heart was okay and served on top of grits.

Sign me up!\n\nWe dropped by for lunch on Saturday afternoon. It's a very small place -- maybe 10 seats, including two stools right next to the tiny kitchen where you can chat with Mr. Pollo himself, chef Manny Torres Jiminez. I've heard that this place can be incredibly busy, but we lucked out and found a table for two waiting for us. \n\nDon't let the no-frills atmosphere fool you -- Chef Jiminez served us incredible, delicious food using fresh and local ingredients. The menu changes daily. Our four-course tasting menu included:\n\n- Arepa, a bread made out of corn somewhat similar to a tortilla or papusa. It was filled with house-made goat chorizo, cheese and heirloom tomato.\n- Trout cooked simply with rapini, matchsticks of turnip, a bit of eggplant, and fresh sauce of onion and parsley.\n- Tri-tip served on a bed of pinto beans and topped with a roasted zucchini sauce\n- A final (and favorite) course of scrumptious pork served with garlic rice and a little bit of sorrel and purple mizuna. \n\nWith such fresh ingredients, the flavors were amazing -- starting with subtle sweetness of the corn in the arepa to the mind-blowing succulent meatiness of the pork and garlic in our final dish. All for $15. Amazing!\n\nBecause Chef Jiminez is working the magic by himself in the kitchen, this isn't an experience that can be rushed. Take some time to chill out, have a conversation with the chef, and have a fabulous leisurely meal at Mr. Pollo.\n\n(One note...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-24", "description": "It's a little hard to write a review for this place, because it's such a different experience.  The conceit is that the key is the ingredients and preparation, not the environment, and thus is it stuck in a minimally sized and minimally refurbished little storefront in the mission where people keep wandering in off the street asking for pupusas, because every other store on the street sells them.  There's also some sort of rock music blasting out of a set of speakers that's seen better days, competing with the musicians outside on the corner.\n\nTwelve seats, about half of them accessible without moving the other half, one chef, and ingredients from the local farmer's market.  The menu is stunningly cheap for the quality, marginally Argentinian, and varies by the day.  And it's good - ingredient rather than process-driven ( you won't find the delicacy and complexity of preparation here that you get at, say, Saison, though they are using the same ingredients ).\n\nWe found the chef to be engaging and friendly - it's a very foodie-friendly place - quite willing to talk at length about the preparations as well as the restaurant scene and star chefs and so on.  We were also subjected, on a Saturday afternoon, to some sort of foodie tour that stopped by and briefly filled the entire restaurant, interrupting service.\n\nIt's not-fancy in the way that a little hole in the wall in a country where you don't quite speak the language can be - you just have to go with the flow.\n\nThere's no phone ( the guy claimed he had no idea where the number that's listed here connects ), no menu and no reservations.  And a meal can take a couple hours, especially with interruptions.  We had no trouble at all arriving near opening time on a Saturday.\n\nSo - an experience, to be sure.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-29", "description": "i had been wanting to come here for a long time after seeing it featured on the Food Network's \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and reading the raving reviews here on Yelp. When my foodie friend wanted to meet up and catch up on life, I thought this would be the perfect opportunity! \n\nFor someone who works in SSF and lives in the East Bay, this place is located in the perfect spot! It's right across the street from the 24th Street/Mission BART station. We walked in at around 6:45pm only to find all the tables and the seating at the counter full. I stood there for a couple minutes, unsure of what to do (the place is so small, there's no standing room or anything at the front of the restaurant!). As I was about to walk out, the chef finally acknowledged me and asked how many people were in my party. There were only two of us, so he gave us an estimated time of 20-25 minutes. We were okay with waiting, so he took down my name and phone number and suggested we go get a drink.\n\nWe killed some time grabbing a cup of coffee from Philz Coffee a few blocks down the road and  returned to stand outside of Mr Pollo. After about an hour, we decided to pop in and check on what was going on. When I inquired about our table to the chef, he said they tried calling twice, but my phone never showed any missed calls! I knew he wrote down my number correctly because I watched him write it down, so I don't know what happened...\n\nLuckily, the next table, originally a table for 7 was turned into a table for 5. They were able to accommodate us, but we had to share our table. In one sense, it was kind of fun and makes for part of the experience, but it also was kind of disappointing. \n\nWe were given menus and the manager suggested the tasting menu (four courses for $15). This was the selection I had seen on TV and what other Yelp reviewers had raved about, so my friend and I both settled on the tasting menu. The tasting menu changes from day to day and just depends on what the chef decides to cook!\n\nI can't remember exactly what each of our dishes consisted of, but the first had a couple little squid complemented by a nice light sauce and a starchy root. The second dish was a small one ounce piece of fish atop a large bed of rice and drizzled with a green creamy, yet light sauce. Nothing really popped out at me, but the sauce and the rice were quite delicious together. The third course was another small piece of fish with a few green beans and carrots that looked like they were picked fresh from someone's backyard garden. Again, there wasn't anything that I was wanting more of, but I was entertained by the visual daintiness of it all. The fourth and final dish was goat formed into a meatball and dressed with halved cherry tomatoes and quartered brussel sprouts. The meat was definitely flavorful and moist! It was the first time I ever had goat, so that was kind of fun.\n\nBetween our third and fourth course, the manager (who also served as the waiter), offered us a three plate dessert sampler that required about 20 minutes of preparation. We declined because were were good with our tasting menu, though. \n\nOverall, aside from the whole reservation fiasco, the service here was top-notch and very personable. I loved the fact that you get to talk to the chef and when each dish came out, the manager explained to us exactly what we were eating. Our water glasses were also constantly being refilled. The party we shared our table with had brought their own bottle of wine and they had no problem serving it up for them.\n\nThe food was pretty good, although, nothing was so amazing that I would have to come back. If someone else wanted me to come along so they could experience Mr Pollo, I would probably go again and maybe try the other things on their menu. \n\nIf you want somewhere nice and cozy to have good conversation, this is the place. Even though it gets kind of loud because there's about 18 people squeezed into such a tiny place, the pacing of the meal (for the tasting menu, at least), is perfect!\n\n$15 for four courses of well-prepared food is definitely quite a deal!\n\nOn our way out, we were thanked by the manager and after we stepped out the door, we were thanked by the chef himself and shook hands with him! This is why I love tiny hole-in-the-wall places! Good food and excellent service!\n\nNOTE: Cash only!", "author": "Leana L."}

The first time I ordered from the \"choose a meat and 3 sides\" @ $10 and the second time from the $20 4 course  chefs' choice. Both those times were quite good and while I didn't leave stuffed, I most certainly didn't leave hungry..\n\nThe most recent time I ate here was last week. I probably should have reconsidered eating there when my friend and I noticed the \"pop up dinner, $60 for 7 courses\". While I appreciate good food and am willing to pay for a good meal, I most certainly can't really afford a meal like this. We were told we could do the 4 course tasting for $30... Since I did enjoy it last time, and it was only $10 more..my friend and I decided we'd fork out the extra money..\n\nOur tasting menu consisted of a single oyster, a single beet, a small bowl of turnip soup, and one grilled shrimp. Thats it. We were a bit dumfounded and I felt like some one was playing a mean joke on me. I will say the guest chef for the night did bring us a few extra things we weren't charged for..(a cherry with a dollop of goat cheese and some small crumbles of cake apparently made with boar fat.) . Sadly, It didn't even seem like the chef was that excited to tell us about what made these dishes special\n\nNone of these dishes were mind blowing or that unique.

It seems that after they appeared on the show their prices increased from 15 to 20 dollars a person.  \n\nIts a 4 course meal, where you pay a flat rate of 20 for a menu that is prepared and served as you eat. Great because everything is fresh and made to order, but there was additional 4 dollars for a add-on, which was ok, but for 20 dollars it should have been included due to the small portions.  And when I say small, I mean SMALL!  Our bill ended up being over 50.00 and when we left, when had to go somewhere else to eat due to the fact that we was still hungry.", "author": "Reggie S."}

But the menu was worth exactly the $20.  I wouldn't mind a little less art and a little more substance.  I would be fine with veggies procured from the bodega next door if it meant that I didn't have to go home hungry.    \n\nTo top things off, we were also freezing cold.  The door doesn't close properly and there's a large window above the door being held by a string.  Despite the best efforts of the chef in the kitchen, having one guy plating every dish for the 14 people that fit in the restaurant means that the food will arrive cold.  When I asked if it were possible to turn on the heat, I was schooled by our server for being so spoiled - \"this is why your meal is only $20\".   \n\nIncidentally, $20 is also the copay when I go see the doctor about my worsening cold.", "author": "Maiya S."}

We ordered the chef's $15 4-course tasting menu and each dish just got better and better.  Our appetizer started with an empanada and that's when the party in my mouth started.  Perfectly cooked with a nice sauce on top made to eat slowly to savor the taste of the meat and veggies enclosed in the crispy pastry.  Next came the first course with a light potato potato corn pancake that was to die for.  The other courses consisted of squid plate with a colorful side dish of purple, yellow, and orange colored calliflower, skirt steak so juicy it made your mouth water, and to top off the amazing meal was a pork dish over cilantro rice and fresh veggies.  \n\nUgh...I need to go back already.  So here are a few things you need to know about this place.  \n1. It's super small.  Get here as soon as it opens (6pm) because there are 2 tables for a party of 4, 2 tables for a party of 2, and 3 seats at the bar.  Therefore, if you like to have your personal space, you'll prob want to go somewhere else.\n2.  BYOB --- SCORE!!!  Bring a bottle with you or run to the liquor store down the street and enjoy!\n3.

I just wanted to dance during my meal.\n\nThe portions are REALLLY small. You definitely will not get full just from the 4-course meal. You'd probably have to order a Venezuelan arriba (which is really good!!) plus a tropical juice. I definitely recommend the soursop juice - it tasted like white guava but with a weird aftertaste. \n\nFor some reason, all of our courses came out lukewarm, but pretty sure it's just because there is only one chef and he doesn't have the time to serve everything hot off the grill because he's too busy preparing the next dish.

Met my friends there and thankfully they got there early and saved a spot! We had the 4-course tasting menu, the fried yukka, and a meat filled arepa.\n\nThe tasting menu was pretty good. The veggies were very fresh and the flavors were very Latin inspired. It was my first time having frog legs - the meat was a chewier version of a fried chicken leg. My favorite was the sliced steak with greens and an anchovy-garlic sauce.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the arepa - maybe because I lean towards a fluffier cake. It was filled with shredded beef which was just OK.  I should have specified to make the fried yukka extra crispy - just because it's my preference - but all in all it was good.\n\nLoved the beats the Mr. Pollo played - added such a playful atmosphere!

It was incredible. unique beet soup to start, tender juicy chicken main course, some crispy plantain thing that blew our minds. Everyone in the party was stunned.  AND this was all for 20$ !\n\nWhen I came back recently  the food was so so disappointing.  I had been raving about the place and brought a visiting friend there.  We got a soup that was like water with hot peppers in it.  A delicious arepa.  An overcooked piece of unidentifiable red meat atop plain mash of some veggie, and a dessert that CLEARLY no one who worked there had tried or they would have realized that it tasted like mush with a few berries on top--like the health mush I make myself for breakfast every morning but less good.

There is only one thing they serve;  a four-course tasting menu (the last course is dessert).  The only option is whether to add an arepa, which is a generally flavorful meet and vegetables bookended by crispy corn, which often ends up being one of the best dishes in the lineup.  \n\nThe other dishes change frequently based on availability, but if you go back twice within two weeks you will notice one or two dishes of overlap.  Everything is excellently cooked with very fresh ingredients.  The food is truly fusion, with some dishes drawing from Southeast Asian soup flavors, and others incorporating Louisiana style grits.  And of course, with a healthy dose of Latin American spices.  Because the dishes challenge your pallet, you may not like every one, but unlike some other places that are similarly experimental Manny pulls it off much more often than not, and for 1/5 the price.\n\nThere are only three tables and a counter, so I recommend either showing up for the first sitting, or getting there and being prepared to wait for at least half an hour on a weekend.

I just know that the pork loin on the third dish was the most flavorful, tender, complex, and just plain yummy piece of pork I've had in a while. \n\nThere are some points to consider. The four plates are pretty small, so I would suggest adding a delicious meat arepa of the day. We also added an empanada which was mediocre and the only low point of the meal.

WTF?\n\nI was so hunger AFTER the meal that I had to go to El Farolito to order a couple of tacos just to feel satiated.\n\nIf you're thinking this is just because I'm a big eater, I assure you that is not the case. My girlfriend is 4'11\" and weighs a little over 90lbs and even she was hungry after the meal.\n\nI would not wish this place on my worst enemy. They are ripping people off.

The food is so impressive given the price ($20 prix fixe) and that there is one person doing all the cooking. The ingredients are fresh and the portions are size-able.

To get in, it's like the dinner equivalent of popular brunch spots.  First, you have to get there 30 minutes before it opens and freeze your butt off.  But oh, is it sooo worth the wait.  The place is teeny tiny, so if you're not one of the first 10 people in line good luck.  You'll probably end up waiting at least another hour.  There is an a la carte menu, although at $20, the four course tasting menu is a steal!  I highly recommend this.  The tasting menu changes and is made with ingredients that the chef procures himself from the farmer's market earlier that day.  You will have no idea what you're getting for every course ... but that's the fun in it!\n\nOur four courses consisted of a soup, a shrimp (just one shrimp), some steak, and a pork dish with seasonal veggies sprinkled onto each dish.  Other than the steak, which was a little on the bland side for me, all the other dishes excelled equally.  The flavors were sometimes experimental (I've never had some of the food combinations presented together before) but overall nicely done.  This place isn't \"Latin American\" completely like stated in the Yelp description.  Although they have arepas you can order here, their fixed price menu is a little more California style (a la Alice Waters) cuisine if you ask me.  I definitely wouldn't come here starving.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-09-17", "description": "Dear Mr. Pollo,\n\nI owe you an apology. No, it's not for what you might be thinking - I've never written unsavory remarks about you or slandered you to my friends. In fact I only had positive things to say in my previous write-up of your business. But I did make one mistake in that first review - one big mistake. I underestimated you.\n\nSee, even after publically endorsing your Pork and Cheese Arepa as one of the best I've ever tasted, I still wrote you off in my mind as a simple specialty shop. But then I finally opened my mind up enough to look past your arepas and venture into tasting menu territory. Now, after countless return visits, it's obvious that my initial perception of you was wrong. Completely, embarrassingly wrong, and for that, I'm sorry.\n\nI've eaten some of the year's most memorable dishes while crunched into one of your 12, tightly-packed seats. First of all, every SOUP you serve is incredible. I mean, screw Campbell's, the next time I'm sick I'm heading straight to your door and begging you for any soup that comes from your stoves. Your LOBSTER BROTH and SEARED SCALLOP SOUP is the first that comes to mind, as it has your signature mark of being simple in its appearance, but complex in its execution. A homemade lobster broth filled with seared bay scallop, squid a la plancha, yucca, cucumber radish, fennel frond, potato, English peas, mushroom, carrot, red onion, and fava bean is far from your average, brothy soup and overflows with flavor.\n\n Another stand out from the dozens of dishes I've tried is your CONFIT of BABY OCTOPUS. That night it was served with shaved fennel salad, fish eggs, parsley, burnt spring onion, garlic oil, and papitas, making an amazing balance of toasty, bitter, smoky, and salty flavors. Not to mention the protein was beautifully executed, making it one of the most tender versions of octopus I've tried.\n\nAnd it's worth repeating that, in my eyes, your AREPAS are still the best in town. While the crispy pork and cheese is consistently one of my favorites, the one time when you unexpectedly swapped fried pork for insanely moist pork loin was the pinnacle of your arepa prowess. I may have initially questioned why you'd change a good thing, but after one bite there was no question that pork loin was king and I had a new menu favorite.\n\nManny, you once said that your goal in opening a restaurant in that location and charging pennies for the food was to be able to feed any and every person, rich or poor, in the Mission. So finally, I want to say thank you for only charging $20 for your tasting menu. Seriously, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for serving me so much delicious food for so little money. Because of your beyond-reasonable pricing, I've been able to recommend Mr. Pollo to pretty much anyone looking for a good SF restaurant, and I've been able to make weekly trips without worrying about my bank account. In short, you've made your restaurant accessible for almost any occasion, and that makes you a rare gem in a city overflowing with dining options.\n\nThanks for everything! Your biggest fan,\nKelsey", "author": "Kelsey E."}

I figured that whatever Chris Consentino likes, I must like too! Well, this gem really did rank up there as one of my top meals in a new city not in Texas.\n\nWe walked up at 5:50PM to see that BYOB was no longer an option. Discouraged, we kept our beers in our bags. On a different note, I do like that they really keep the \"Mexican\" feel, with the Mr. Pollo sign really providing that unique character. The food is far from Mexican.\n\nManny, the dude running the joint, prepares each dish with care, poise, and efficiency. It is just him working the \"close quarters\" kitchen, and he really knows what he is doing. Additionally, the one guy working the tables is awesome. He only has about 10 seats, so he is maximizing his potential as a customer-first server!\n\nAs everyone knows, the $20 four-course is outstanding. Other than that, there are only a few meat plates offered. Arepas, to boot. The menu is constantly rotating, and Mr. Pollo, himself, goes to the Farmer's Market on the reg.\n\nOur communal items at dinner: amazing chicken, lamb, and goat arepas with crispy shells and an outstanding green salsa and melty cheese. Now the dishes: a room temperature potato salad with green (herb?) cream sauce and fried green beans--the purple sweet potato jam was killer; a nickel size piece of griddled (he really knows how to work that flat top!) foie gras with asparagus and perfect mushrooms touched with parsley cream; a grilled langoustine (unfortunately, a tad dry) with fried eggplant, fried brussels, and braised beet greens; and last, but not least, a herb risotto with fried nettles. Good God, an amazing meal for $20.\n\nNot much else I can say about this hole in the wall, fine dining establishment. The price is way too low, the food is way too good, and the service is just as attentive as you can ask for. If you happen to have 5:50PM to 7:30PM off for a drawn-out, quaint, slightly rustic meal, Mr. Pollo is the die-hard go-to in the entire city of Saint Francis.

I would let you in a on a dirty little secret, but in San Francisco, nothing stays a secret very long.  Welcome to Mr. Pollo, a revamped tiny enclave of a restaurant located in a former rotisserie chicken building where the smart order is the 4-course tasting menu for the moderately absurd price of $20.  \n\nWhat kind of ingredients can you expect to find at the chef's disposal?  Think tasty gourds, premium cuts of meat, edible flowers, artisan cheeses, and fancy finishing salts.  If the cuisine was not enough to bring you here, then maybe the seemingly paradoxical balance of an intimate dive or the fantastic covers from Mr. Pollo's house musician du jour would capture your passion.  \n\nWhile it is my general practice to write lengthy reviews, it should be noted that Mr. Pollo does not advertise.

There is even a 5 course farmer's market inspired chef tasting menu for $15!!!  I was in a rush so got the faster options, but I'm definitely coming back to try it.  What I spied at other people's tables looked amazing and, if my take away is any indicator of the quality, it will be quite the deal!!!\n\nPork Arepa: Such a made to order act of love!  Hand pressed masa griddled to order then cut in half with the outer edges perfectly crunchy.  Pork sliced off a raw slab seasoned and deep fried.  Avocado sliced fresh, tangerine sections sliced fresh and both placed on top.  The creamy garlic and cilantro pur\u00e9e really helped contrast the fried aspect of the pork and the arepa.\n\nChicken Arepa: All the dressings were just as nice as the pork.  Stewed chicken, fresh onions and fresh peppers were griddled for the filling.  The chicken had the nice char of grilled chicken, but the tenderness of stewed... what a great piece of meat!\n\nChorizo: Apparently made in house daily.  Not as spicy and rigid as the Mexican chorizos we know.  More like the texture of an Italian sausage but with subtle Colombian spices.  Some rice with a heavy garlic sauce came along.  I liked the taste, but the felt the rice was too soggy.

And maybe just maybe you would have enjoyed it even more if it wasn't for the unreasonably high expectations from all they hype?\n\nWell, some jackass and some high Yelp reviews just did that to Mr Pollo for me.\n\nThe Jackass of course would be me.  I went to Mr Pollo once last summer on a trip out here, before I actually moved to San Francisco.  It was great.  I mean GREAT.  Best restaurant ever man.  You have to try it.  I ran around telling every soul I knew out here and a few pan handlers asking for change how effing awesome the place and my lunch was and all for $10.\n\nAdd a years worth of rose tinted memory laced fondness and that brings us to today.\n\nI am writing this a couple hours later and my mouth still feels aSALTed.  But I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nOne of the things I thought was great last time was Chef Manny explaining how he buys everything fresh every morning and that's what he has for the day's menu.  Cool, I like that.  Toss in a few reviews that mention things like regretting not ordering the dessert ahead of time because they ran out.  And well, I thought I'd get there early to not have that problem.\n\nGreat, get there at 11:30 (they open at 11) for lunch and my first let down no Manny.  Some other chef behind the counter.  Fine that happens when a place is successful, good for him I think.  I then try to order the chicken.  They are out.  How?  No one is here, you just opened.  And its 11:30am, presumably there has been enough time to have done your mornings shopping?\n\nOk, well I tell myself  its that kind of restaurant.  Remember, it's cool that the menu changes with what is available just take what they have.  It's cool.\n\nI get the lunch plate and empanada(same exact thing I ordered last summer, keep that in mind)  the meat was beef as they were out of my first choice as you may have heard.\n\nThe empanada comes out.  It is really freaking good.  I'm thinking happy delicious thoughts at this point.  Manny trained the new guy well, the chicken thing is well just how the place runs what they have changes, that is COOL.\n\nThe lunch plate comes out and apparently one thing they had on hand this afternoon that they needed to get rid of before it went bad was salt.  Lots and lots and lots of salt.  No hyperbole I think I hit my weekly recommended allowance of sodium for the week in the one meal.  Thank god I don't have hypertension(thats a thing that reacts to sodium right?) or something.\n\nI suspect from the presentation and what little other non-salted flavors that leaked through and the general freshness of everything that the rest of the lunch was fucking deliciousness hiding behind a wall of salt.  But I couldn't confirm that.\n\nBringing us to the second to last disappointment.  I thought I could use something to cut some of this SALT.  I tried to order a coke.  Nope sorry we are don't have soda.  Not coke, SODA.  I ended up getting a glass of water.\n\nLast disappointment also comes from success I guess.  what was a $10 lunch last summer was now $19.

Course 3 was a grilled squid dish - very good. Course 4 was a pork sausage dish - wonderful. We also had a yummy smoothie - I think it was blackberry or something. We decided to skip dessert as the options didn't sound too interesting.\n\nIt all came out to about $55 before tip.

But, for the ambiance, three stars it shall be.\n\nConceptually, I was very excited by the idea of being able to buy out the whole restaurant for a group of 12-15 people at the very reasonable price of about $25 a person (including tax and tip.)\n\nBut, there are some definite speed bumps that the restaurant needs to work out if it's allowing you to do a full buyout. Our large group promptly arrived for our reservation, and not one, but two tables of people were still eating dinner. We waited, and we waited some more. It was particularly rainy and cold that evening, and for a few unlucky members of our group, they got stuck waiting outside since the restaurant is so small. Eventually, the chef had to politely ask the lingering group to leave, as apparently our greedily hovering over their table wasn't hint enough. But, that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place, as I feel the restaurant should have timed the seating better so there was no overlap.\n\nWhile I certainly enjoyed each course that I ate, I felt like it was lacking as an overall dining experience. Since no alcohol is allowed period, there wasn't the communal feeling of sharing bottles of wine. Instead, we simply had water, as no one asked if we wanted to order other non-alcoholic beverages. (I knew alcohol wasn't allowed going into the meal, but having sparkling water or some sort of juice would have been nice.) Also, there was no dessert, and without that, the meal just kind of ended abruptly.\n\nBased on this experience, I definitely wouldn't come back for a large group scenario. But, I probably would return with one or two folks because the four-course chef's menu at such cheap prices is too good to pass up...as long as I don't have to wait too long.", "author": "Rachel G."}

It's hard to believe they serve decent food when you look at the place. It's really small restaurant, the maximum capacity is 12. I was glad that I made a reservation. \nThe atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of a cafeteria. Their silverwares and plates are not fancy at all. Everyone gets same food about the same time.

I had two sliced tomatoes with burrata, polenta with mushroom sauce, fresh pasta(i saw the chef rolling the fresh pasta, fun!) with pork and ice cream with rum raison sauce and a kind of biscotti.

This was understandable - I never checked their hours so that was my own fault. What I didn't appreciate was the somewhat rude and dismissive manner in which we were informed of this. \n\nOur server was a bit... standoffish? He seemed to want to divulge the least amount of information possible about everything.

The chicken was tender and well seasoned, and the sauce - YUM.\n\nSo no complaints on the food. My only other gripe was the price. $8 per arepa seems a taaaad much, but again, it seems like the tasting menu is really where it's at.

We ordered two arepas: one filled with chicken and one with steak. I told my girlfriend how I could easily eat half a dozen of these.

On top of the impecable presentation, every single item was cooked to perfection...but you don't have to take my non-professional opinion, go try it out if you get the chance!\n\nI really enjoyed it and imagine that this is what being a panelist for Iron Chef would feel like.

Or at a place with an ugly yellow sign bearing the odd name- but in Spanish only. It is a hole in the wall to redefine the meaning of \"hole in the wall\". If there are more than five people in your party- go else where- they only seat @ 12. Also I would recommend going in a small group- all the better to marvel at the food.\n\nThe best way I can explain Mr Pollo is to say Manny is an artist who has yet to make the money finer digs would require- but an artist nonetheless. He is a true chef. And cooking is obviously his one true love.\n\nI have been there three times now. Each time weeks apart. After the first visit I wanted to make sure it wasn't a fluke that I loved it so much. All three times I ordered the $15 sampler and the beef arepa. Othere than the beef arepa my order each time was a completely new culinary masterpiece. There was lamb, there was lobster, there was deserts that you had to- just had to- order a second serving of.\n\nTo tell you more about the food would be to do a major injustice. Truly my words can not capture how amazing each dish was- nor do I have the proper vocabulary to try. We let Manny know that we wanted whatever he wanted to make us that night. We were his guests (as we were recommended to do- everyone we knew who loved Mr Pollo knows that if you want to have a 5 star experience leave the menu choices up to Manny. He won't disappoint. And no matter what you won't pay more than $30 a person.\n\nIf you want alcohol, bring your own. He doesn't sell beer or wine but will be happy to serve you yours with no corkage costs!\n\nAlso don't go to Mr Polloo if you're in a hurry. Manny's food is his art- and no artist likes to be rushed. This is an experience not just a meal. And Mr Pollo isn't for you if you intend to be picky \"no butter- easy oil- not too much blah blah blah\".

You can pretend it's an \"aperitif\"...and you can always make it better by pairing it up with an empanada. \n\nFrom a very simple dish of mackerel over a bed of white rice (p-e-r-f-e-c-t-l-y cooked) topped with a tomato, avocado and onion vinaigrette to a fantastic, crunchy tostada (a larger, thinner version of our Venezuelan arepas) filled with trout, greens, home-pickled baby carrots and a fabulous creamy cilantro sauce, everything I had at Mr. Pollo utterly pleased my palate.\n \nIt also made me very happy to see how well Manny is bringing Venezuelan food to people's attention and to a whole new level!\n\nThe use of fresh, locally sourced and unique ingredients blends like zucchini, radicchio and parsnips--to go with squid--seems to be crucial in Manny's offers. Beautiful, simple dishes were carefully prepared by this tie-wearing chef. Each one was perfectly salted by his skilled hands and seasoned with some of the most fun and laugh-filled conversation I've had with a fellow Venezuelan in a long time. \n\nThis combination of great food and good times makes this place is an \"experience\" restaurant. Think \"Slow Food\" at its best. If you are in a rush, wait until you have more time to truly enjoy your long-lunch break or dinner plans.  \n\nDon't miss dessert, prepared fresh on site. We wrapped up our night with a sample dish of all three that were offered that day: Dulce de Leche Souffle, Mango Upside Down Cake and Blackberry ice cream. \u00a1Ay, Dios mio!

The food is great, and an amazing deal, but the tasting menu should be supplemented for those who wish for more than a graze--just make sure to take your own alcohol.\n2. If you expect fresh, carefully made food to take time, you will have no problems with service.\n\nPre-dining Assumptions\n1. The space will be small\n2. The servings will be small\n3. The check will be small\n4. The food will come out slowly\n\nAnalysis of Experience\n\nFood--My date and I each got the four course tasting menu (\"tm\"), a meat arepa to share, and dessert.  The tm items were a pleasure but were not substantial enough to satiate.  Two of the items were very salt heavy, but still enjoyable because they were cooked to perfection.  As warning, the last course was a beef dish that I believe is meant to be served cold.  The meat arepa was an absolute delight: basically a crispy corn pita stuffed with a fresh made goat-chorizo (not gamey at all), sauces, avocado, and other veggies; it was large and heavy enough to be a meal on its own.  I found myself salivating at the thought of another as I woke up this morning--a sure sign of pure awesomeness.  We got two separate desserts: mine, a whole vanilla bean upside-down cake with a saffron-cardamom whipped cream; and hers, a dulce de leche souffl\u00e9.  A solid culinary experience overall.\n\nService--some of the reviews below state that service was slow.  In reality, the singular chef is cooking everything by hand, with care, and it comes to your table immediately upon completion.  Good food takes time.  If you go in expecting this, there should be no temporal qualms.  Our server was super friendly as well.\n\nValue--Totally bill: $50 for two to dine.  No, this place isn't Absinthe, 1300, or Kokkari.  But for the cost of one entree at these places, I got six courses.  Having done the tasting menu, next time I can get my whole dinner here for the price of Absinthe's pretzel bites (but really, I'll probably get 6 courses again).\n\n\nConclusion\n\nPlease don't go here.  I want to get a table the next time I go, and I want to make sure Manny is cooking my food.  The only way these can be guaranteed is if you go somewhere else.", "author": "Deepu G."}

We walked in and saw like 4 mini tables and luckily there was one vacant. The waiter said we just made it to the 8pm dinner slot which we were very happy to hear. Not much on the small menu but one thing stood out, the chefs tasting menu. It was an unknown always changing 4 course dish consisting of fresh ingredients that the chef picked up in the morning. We both ordered that and were waiting patiently for our first course to come out, which was not long at all, about 5 minutes. \n\nIt was an artichoke soup with fried plantains. It was amazingly smooth and creamy, and not over watery or too thick, it was just right. Had a nice salty sweet and savory flavor to it. I could see myself ordering this next time if it was permanently on the menu.\n\nSecond course dish was called the perfect egg sitting on a salad. The waiter explained that the egg was cooked for 2 hours at a temperature of 62 degrees that gets the egg poached perfectly with the egg whites all soft and cooked and the yolk half cooked and half runny. I was quite impressed, it was delicious. \n\nThird and fourth dish were just alright. They were a fried fish and a half quail. They were nothing special and really not that memorable. Even though they were not that great I am excited to see what else they come up with for other nights. \n\nThe experience was great, very fun, creative and inexpensive.

BRACE YOURSELF. You will drool just reading this: \n\nHeirloom tomato salad with marigold flowers, cucumber topped with a vinaigrette. - So refreshing. Any of the ingredients you mixed was always a perfect bite. YUM! \n\nFried jumbo shrimp on a bed of puree, summer peas and baby corn. I cleaned this plate. Enough said. \n\nSummer trout with fried eggplant and summer squash topped with an avocado tomato salsa and caviar. Ooh La La! \n\nNew York steak on a bed of potatoes and brussel sprouts with guasacaca sauce topped with Hawaiian lava salt and garlic flowers. Who knew garlic flowers would taste Oh so delicious with this dish. Love it. \n\nAre you full yet? Cause I was, BUT there's always room for dessert, Right? \n\nWe finished this amazing meal with a house made caramel souffle topped with smoked salmon vanilla bean ice cream. YES. I couldn't find the words to describe this one cause it was so good. You just have to hope you get this one when you go! \n\nYou could bring your own beer or wine. I recommend a red and white wine or if you're not a wine drinker then a light and dark beer. It will compliment all the dishes that come out! They normally have two seatings so I suggest you get there early if you have a huge party!", "author": "Tiffany B."}

We sat at the bar as it was the only seats when we arrived and right away like a strong wind took in the atmosphere of the restaurant. Decor, food and staff. It was grunge in a very good way, the guys were cool, atmosphere was warm and had a great time rapping with Johnny as he cooked. Good guy who cares about his food. Food was very good and as he mentioned, \"you'll eat what I give you\" in so many words. It was just right. I was impressed with the delivery, taste and flavor of what he put together. 4 courses and each had a different flair. Well done. We walked away feeling great about dinner, the place and the night in general. Highly recommend Mr Pollo if you are looking for a great dinner, good vibe, at a not so fancy establishment.", "author": "Armen K."}

The atmosphere is fun-super tiny with only 10 people max inside, and because we arrived early, we were seated at the \"bar\" which is really two bar stools directly in front of the chef.  \n\nIt was a two-man operation, and it was great to watch them seamlessly choreograph running a restaurant in such small square footage.  \n\nWe had the four-course tasting menu for $20, and the food: Fantastico!  Spicy Arugula with petals, Beef Empanadas, Langoustines with Sunchoke and Anchovy Puree, Crispy Purple Potatoes, Potato and Leek Vichyssoise, Foi Gras, Black Truffles, Creamy Coconut Rice with Seared Steak and Pickled Red Cabbage and Carrots...the list goes on and on.  When my husband asked how he planned his menu, his reply was: \"Right now.\"!\n\nBe forewarned, the plates are small, which is why it's a four course \"tasting\" menu.  But don't let that deter you, the flavors, concept, and experience are not to be missed!  We also added a Beef and Crispy Pork Arepa to share-and we highly recommend you do this too.  It not only rounds out your meal nicely (especially if your feeling shorted on the overall size of your meal), but is a treat not to be missed in and of itself!  \n\nThe reason for four, not five stars: The music.  Some of the songs played were riddled with, what we consider, offensive language.  Something to note if you're bothered by things like that too.\n\nDon't forget: Get there early to ensure you get a seat.  On this particular day they opened for lunch at 1 PM and closed at 2:30 PM.  After the initial seating of guests, they began turning folks away until dinner service.", "author": "Olivia E."}

I've never said/thought this before about any other place, but 4 stars is seriously under-rated for this place.\n\nThree of us had the 4-course tasting ($15!!!), which in short was dripping in quality, but slightly lacking in quantity (emphasis on slightly.  A medium appetite would be satisfied).  We had no idea what we were getting, and got whatever the chef felt like making.  To the best of my awful memory, the dishes were...\n\n1) Scallops with brussel sprouts and pea shoots.  I was already happy with the restaurant on the first bite.  Seriously.\n2) Baby octopus served on a bed of rice with some sort of vegetable\n3) Goat leg served on yam/sweet potato.  The yam/sweet potato was slightly crispy on the outside and exploded with gooey awesomeness as soon as you bit into it.  YUM.\n4) Pork something served with pinto and fava beans.  The funny part about this dish was the waiter dude said it was chicken breast.  No f***ing way was it chicken breast, unless that chicken was force-fed bacon for months.  Hmm...business idea?\n\nAfter the tasting, we still had hunger, and shared three arepas (beef, chicken and cheese).  The meat arepas were both outrageously good for only $6.50.  The cheese arepa was fine, but at $1.50, well worth the price as an appetizer (next time).\n\nAll-in-all, it was a great experience.  The wacked-out Alicia Keyes/Duffy/Adele music selection and incredibly crammed/casual atmosphere just made for an even better night.\n\nA caveat I guess, the meal was really meat-heavy (albeit locally sourced).  Not the best choice for the veggie-oriented.", "author": "Jay W."}

There is no way a party of more than 4 could be put up, and the seating is pretty crammed but the food...the FOOD...was amazing. \n\nI had the taster menu and the plates were all brought out by the chef himself, explaining exactly what was being put in front of you, sometimes even mentioning which market the produce came from. \n\nMake sure you take the time to enjoy the food, I recommend trying the juices (really surprised by the unique tastes) and please make sure you push past the chef to go to the toilet, this place has snails in the sink!

I love that this little gem is steps away from 24th Street Bart and - from the exterior - looks like any old janky Mexican taco joint.  But once you get inside, you're whisked away to another place, where food is local and the menu changes daily based on what's fresh.\n\nThe $15 tasting menu is the hot ticket here.  You don't get huge portions of food, but you are in safe hands with Chris, the very friendly man who opened the joint with his partner.  He took great care of us and even customized the sampling menu to accommodate our vegetarian friend.\n\nEvery single dish we consumed was exquisite.  Because its a 2 man show in a VERY tiny place (like, 15 people max), Mr. Pollo has a very intimate, slow food feel to it.  It's great for dates or gatherings in which you'd like to sit and chat while food is brought out piece by piece.  So if you're in a rush, or can't maintain colorful conversation with your date, don't order the tasting menu.\n\nIt was also apparently BYOB, although we were asked to keep it on the DL.

This time around I had squid, frog leg, pork shoulder, and goat.\n\nHowever, when reading all the yelp reviews, a huge highlight was that the juices (with names I can't pronounce) came with the tasting menu.  I've eaten here twice, once where it was included in the total (for two people, $32) and then the next time where it wasn't (also for two people, $50).  Where did the discrepancy come from?  Ordered the same things.  Two tasting menus, two juices.  The first time, a scoop of ice cream came with our cheque.  Was expecting the same thing the second time when our waiter asked if we would like something sweet to end off our meal.  This time, the dessert came with three scoops of ice cream and some doughy-apple fritters.  But you aren't honestly trying to tell me that the dessert cost as much as one four course dinner?\n\nCheery staff, fun chefs, and sure, it's not that much money in the long run, but on principle, that's pretty darn annoying.", "author": "Carolyn L."}

The sever didn't even know how to respond to this because he was clearly high.  We had to ask him for new cutlery and drinks because he didn't even realize they were all on the floor. He brought free drinks over to the table beside us even though their table had not had a guy fall over on top of them and apologized which of neither we got! Our bill came down and the drinks that we had to replace and the first course were charged for and nothing was taken off our bill for the terrible night we had here.

I suggested Mr. Pollo based on Chris Cosentino's description of the place on TBTIEA on Food Network.\n\nWe each ordered the tasting menu and a side of fried yucca. We had told the waiter we wanted either yucca or plantains, and he said he could pretty much guarantee we'd get plaintains in the tasting menu, so side of yucca it was. We also got each of the jugos, which were all refreshing and delicious.  I highly recommend these.\n\nThe yucca was the highlight of my day.  The yucca itself was nicely fried and the accompanying sauce was to die for! I think  I could drink that sauce out of a jar. \n\nOur tasting menu consisted of:\n1) Empanada w/ buffalo meat\n2) (smallish) cheese arepa topped w/ tomatoes\n3) fried yucca w/ a small piece of foie gras\n4) Seared beef slices over fragrant rice\n\nEverything was prepared well but I think it was overall a tad bit underwhelming.  The final course was a small plate of rice w/ a few thin slices of beef?  I was hoping for something a bit more inventive, perhaps.\n\nI saw a couple of the other parties get large plates of food though, so I think perhaps it's better to get entrees here (in terms of quantity of food).  I think you get more food paying less for an entree than for the tasting menu.\n\nIt also took us about 1.5-2 hours to get all four courses.  This is not a complaint, just an observation.  I completely understand that Manny is cooking everything for everyone by himself, so I see why it takes a bit longer.  My advice is to not try and squeeze in dinner here before another engagement if you plan on making that engagement on time.\n\nI anticipate coming back for a large plate, and definitely for the fried yucca and the jugos.", "author": "Naoko M."}

Not only did we make it, but we're rather lucky to have gotten there so late after lunch. Two of the four tables were already taken; a couple on what appears to be a first date had to slide over to another table to accommodate us. This place is tiny. The draw of a four-course tasting menu for $15 seemed worth a try, though. And chef Manny Torres Gimenez didn't disappoint. Even considering how veggie-heavy the menu ended up being, it was high entertainment watching him through the lexan screen as he prepared labor-intensive food for six people simultaneously. All of the dishes were very much hands on. The couple next to us were also eating the chef's menu, and they didn't appear to get the same dishes, so I'm under the impression that Manny might just have been making this all up as he went.\n\nEvery dish was absolutely delicious. And, while there is only a touch of animal protein here and there, it's clear that ingredients are important to the chef. I think in the dish descriptions we hear the phrase \"farmers market\" paired with \"this morning\" at least five times.

Luckily, Chris and Manny recognized a member of our party and insisted that we stay. \n\nI didn't even have to try the food, I knew I loved this place based purely on the collective charisma of Manny and Chris -- that being said -- the food was ridiculous. I mean, I was drunk, I could have easily settled for bacon-wrapped hotdog (no offense intended, those things are amazing), but this food was fan-fuckin'-tastic. \n\nEmpanadas, plantains, and several other dishes I was unfamiliar with, were quickly rushed to our table, all cooked to perfection. We spent the rest of our time in this tiny-little-hole-in-the-wall stuffing our faces, and exchanging friendly banter with Chris and Manny. At one point Chris offered to give us all free dessert if we managed to guess the name of the artist he was playing for us -- although we never ended up getting it right, it was a great touch to have such an intimate connection with the owners. And Chris didn't disappoint. We ended up getting that free dessert, despite our failed attempt at guessing correctly. \n\nI'm a big proponent of the experiences I have when I'm out dining.

Inside the meat was delicious and tender, and there's a little cream-based sauce on the inside as well. Highly Recommend!!\n\nCachapas - This was a different kind of Arepa, with a much softer corn meal flatbread, almost like a corn pancake. It was also a tad sweet like one. This was filled with cheese, and had some type of aioli-type sauce on top. My companion thought it was a bit too much on the sweet side, but I enjoyed it.\n\nThey have an interesting selection of unusual juices (delicious and fresh):\n\nMaracuya - Passion fruit. Guava-like, and very refreshing.\n\nMora - a dark berry that has a cranberry type tart taste. \n\nHighly recommend either of them depending on your mood.\n\nThere is a daily \"Chef's Tasting Menu\" which changes. That day, I saw him preparing baby octopus and grilled jumbo prawns. It's only 15 dollars, and had I known, I probably would have chosen that as well.\n\nI had a bit of disorientation when I went in since I wasn't sure if I was supposed to sit down, or order at the counter. Basically, sit down, and either Manny or someone will come take your order and answer questions. Given the lack of descriptions on the menu prepare to ask questions.\n\nThe prices are VERY reasonable, but be sure to bring cash, since that is all they take. Also, don't go if you are in a rush. Everything is prepared to order.\n\nI'll be back for more.", "author": "Boris C."}

It's highly recommended! It's low key! It's different.\"  Nope.\nFor the 7 of us, we ordered 7 tasting menus, 3 arepas (not told that they were $8 each), and ultimately, 3 bottles of wine.\nThe smoked Miso egg drop soup was tasty, though very salty, and my straw mushroom had grit in it. No big deal.\nThe mussels were broiled on the half shell, with marinara, grated parmesan cheese, and a much-too-hot sliver of jalapeno.  Without the jalapeno, it tasted like, well, mussels with marinara and parmesan cheese (from a bottle and green-topped canister, respectively), and with the jalapeno, it was intolerably spicy.\nThe greasy Arepas were stuffed with chicken salad.  I mean it.  A very wet, slightly oniony chicken salad dripping with white sauce (mayo?).  It was fine; let me rephrase that: it tasted like chicken salad.\nThe main was quite good--seared red snapper over super creamy polenta, topped with pesto and a balsamic flourish.  It was well done, impressed-at-a-dinner-party well done, but boring. \nDessert was passionfruit black tea (boba style) with pineapple, duk (mochi balls) instead of boba, and bits of a fruit that none of us could pronounce that was similar to lychee.  Everything was exactly as described--perhaps an unusual pairing, perhaps a different setting, but nothing, especially the meal as a whole, was greater than the sum of it's parts.\nExcept the bill.  A $20 prix fixe sounds cheap, even in the land of $7 burritos the size of your colon.  Yet we ended up spending $50 each.  Yes, someone should have done the math before the 3rd bottle of $36 table wine.  Yes, 4 courses is a lot of food.  Oh wait, no it isn't.  Miso soup and bubble tea, 3 mussels, and 3 oz of snapper?

I have been so curious about this place since it started being highlighted by Yelp and was very happy to finally have a chance to give it a try.  When we arrived at around 2pm, all the tables inside were taken so we took the lone table outside that appeared  to have been only recently vacated, lucky us :-) \n\nManny, aka Mr. Pollo, apparently runs the restaurant all by himself at this hour (guess he has help during the evening hour, judging from what other Yelpers have said) and had his hands full with bussing tables, taking orders, cooking and who knows what else, but he never seemed frazzled, which was quite admirable!  We ordered the tasting menu, 4 distinctly different dishes that switched between traditional gourmet and high end street food.  The highlight for us is the 1st course, squid with cauliflower and wild mushrooms.  The dish we liked the least was the very next course, the cheese arepa dusted with sugar.   Why put sugar?!  The dishes' portions were so small that, after receiving our 4th course, we started talking about where we can go to next to fully satiate our hunger, a subject that has never come up with us in the past after just having a meal.\n\nThe meal started with us enjoying the pleasantly balmy weather.  But by the end of our meal, we were bundled back up from the wind that have been slowly picking up over the course of almost 2 hours and more than ready to move on.", "author": "Yvette F."}

The guy tells us that he doesn't know because he hasn't come up with it yet. Suspect. Begs the question - welllll why not? But fine, this place is supposed to be good, maybe the guy is some kind of magician.\n\nWait a sec.\n\nOnce the (tiny) main course had arrived, after the 2 (things I'd rather not eat like octopus and goat) appetizers were unsatisfying and bland, I realized the concept makes no sense. Even if the guy is a great chef, even if they have great ingredients, are we really to believe that EVERYTHING that leaves his hands is just going to be awesome? Like he is just going to FEEL his way to the perfect creation every time? I don't think so, and in fact, I now know so. \n\nI know your response could be \"well it's only $15 - what do you expect?\" First of all, my friend and I both agreed we would have gladly paid more than $15 to actually be full at the end of the meal, and second of all this place is getting enough hype to rival more upscale places in the area. I think it got a little ahead of itself.\n\nSidenote - the cheese arepa we got on the side to help fill up was VERY tasty. This is on the menu every day.

The space itself is a bit funky though. I tiny little storefront with about seating for about 8-10 inside, you get a pretty good view of the chef at work from any seat which is fun, and the quality of the food, especially for the price is AMAZING. The tasting menu is definitely something to try if you are going there for the first time, and Chef Manny is a one man workhorse, doing triple duty as waiter, table buster and chef. Because of this though, it isn't for everyone since the meal did drag on for much longer than we were expecting or hoped it would be. \n\nOn the food, to give you an idea of what I had for my four courses, which he changes up on a daily basis, he opened with an oyster, then fried frog leg over a carrot salad, then my favorite dish, grilled squid with 4 types of mushrooms and first of the season asparagus, and ending with a thin marinated flank steak over rice. \n\nThis is probably one of the best deals in the city. That being said, next time I go back, I'm getting either the meat arepa or the combo plate, which I saw another table order and despite the late hour and full stomach had me drooling for more. \n\nWhile the food is classy, this is not high end dining. The space is cramped and you are almost on top of your neighbors, so I hope you enjoy eavesdropping and having your conversations heard. The tables themselves look like they are from a diner and there was a very cold draft from the door the entire time I was there.

Served with very salty purple potatoes that I thought made a great pair.\n\nSecond course: mackerel with Jerusalem artichokes, roasted brussel sprouts, and a house-pickled baby carrot.  I am not a fan of fish (I know, I know).  But I ate this right up, it was so fulfilling and savory!  The Jerusalem artichokes were excellent and set it off in just the right way.\n\nThird course: crispy pork arepa.  Highlight of the meal!  I want one in every flavor!  Wow, really delicious.  Cheesy but not JUST cheesy: flavorful as well!  And the crispy pork!  \n\nFourth course: lavender lamb over garlic rice with zucchini.  Lamb is not my favorite either, but this was great.  The lavender did not overpower the dish at all, just added a little something interesting for the taste buds.  The garlic rice (green garlicky sauce poured over), was a highlight.

It really does feel like you're a regular the first time you walk in.\n\nWe had a couple of cheese arepas with our meal, they are smaller than the palm of your hand, slightly sweet, made to order, and the cheese is melted perfectly.

We have been doing this every Thursday afternoon since April 2009.  \n\nToday he picked Mr Pollo.  A truly remarkable experience.  Very small, three small tables and two stools.  That is it.  Our expectations were typical of inexpensive in the Mission.  We thought Mr. Pollo would be a first class Taqueria with a Columbian focus.  He followed the Yelp trail here.\n\nWe are rarely surprised and generally underwhelmed.  Mr Pollo did both:  surprise and overwhelming.  We chose the 4 course tasting menu and trusted ourselves to the Manny the Chef.  \n\nEach course was better than the previous one.    I have no idea how he does what he does.  \n\nThis is not a place to look for atmosphere or comfort.  Just set down and start to enjoy each of the four tasting courses.   Let Manny do h is thing including the fresh fruit beverage.  You will be amazed.  This is not typical anything.  This is culinary magic at its best.\n\nToday was scallops, blue potatoes and kohlrabi.  Unbelievable.  Be critical if you like, we were amazed.  What a killer triple pairing of texture, hot and cold and just remarkable.\n\nNext came mackerel, Jerusalem artichokes, roasted brussel sprouts and a baby carrot pickel.  There was nothing about this I would choose and I would be wrong.  Way wrong.  I loved it.  \n\nNext came lavender port over garlic rice.  The lavender was on the counter and you cannot imagine the how awesome this was.  Oh my.\n\nAnd then came the crispy pork arepa.  If anyone every figures out how to do this on a large scale, this will be the fast food of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe various fresh fruit mixed drinks, non-alcoholic perfectly complimented the meal.  \n\nThe food is up at the top of the food spectrum.  Fresh, sustainable, natural and perfect.  Minuses, well if you are looking for roomm white tab le cloths, waiters, bread and a bar this is not your place.

I suggest you make reservations before coming in because the cute little place only sits about 14 people and only at certain seating times. The staff was very helpful and nice to me and my friends. The menu is simple because there are no menus the chef prepares a five course meal of what he has planed for the night. Along with my glass of white wine the first course came out which was a mixed green salad with orange segments blue cheese and roasted pumpkin seeds. Second course was a coconut curry soup with enoki mushrooms crisp snap peas. Third course was my favorite which was the chicken arepa!!!! Mmm ill go back just for that alone! It was mouth watering. Fourth course was creamy palenta with a friend egg, dried sardine and sea weed. And finally came dessert which was my second favorite creamy orange yogurt with red grapes a molasses drizzle and powered topping.

He put together a unique menu with ingredients that I would have never associated with Latin American flavor. Some of my favorite dishes included a trout arepa, grilled whole squid marinated in adobo, and grilled pumpkin with purple potato and foie gras foam. I was impressed most by the fact that all the food was cooked on a flat top and all the proteins were perfectly cooked.

This review is going to sound negative but I'll try to add perspective. First of all, it's very small. I think 10 people could (maybe) comfortably sit inside. 10 people is a stretch on comfort but the seats are there. The restaurant is B.Y.O.B. (license revoked, I assume), the \"wine glasses\" had lip marks on them (I use quotes because the glasses were gaudy, heavy, and shaped in a way that reminds me of a Halloween party). We went for the four-course meal ($20/each) but our waiter told us that we should order and share a sandwich to compliment the meal (which basically says that the four course meal will not fill us up... not really appropriate). Instead of replacing the butter knives, the restaurant has them sharpened (which means they're not serrated at all and, ultimately, ineffective... could not cut through my asparagus). We ordered and shared a dessert to finish because we were still hungry.\n\nSo where are the good parts? If you're on a budget, this place is not for you. It is severely overpriced. The two of us had a $75 bill and that was before the cost of the wine. Until the bill arrived, I loved the dingy and dirty atmosphere because they pull it off well. Everyone is incredibly friendly and our waiter was really hot (I'd go back for that reason alone) but the price of the food should reflect the restaurant's shortcuts and the food should fill us up. Each course was faux-fancy (in a cute - almost comical - way). Instead of pretending to be bougie, the restaurant seems to own the juxtaposition of fancy plates with an atmosphere that reminds me of buying $1.00 tacos. It's comfortable, incredibly friendly, and a place where I'd go regularly if the prices better reflected the restaurant's position.

South American food is my favorite thing to recommend to someone who can not eat wheat or gluten.\n \nThe owner is an angel and reminds me of my Ecuadorian father. \nThey even look alike. Neither your tummy or your wallet will regret giving this place a shot friends.\n\nManny, who is the chef, waiter and bus boy is a talented chef from Venezuela who will prove his labor of love with the dishes that he provides you. There are 12-13 seats in this tiny place where all can see each other and the chef in action. \n\nDon't miss the arepas. Arepas are fresh corn patties, very different from anything else and a great treat for gluten-free folks. Manny's are soft, sweet and overflowing with white melting cheese. Que rico!\n\nOn my last visit I had chuleta (grilled pork), rice verde (green rice), whole stewed beans, yucca, arepas and Mora (raspberry juice) but I was very envious of the tasting menu (15) which was served on smart little plates, the highlight appeared to be scallops over zucchini. -yum. \n\n\nI asked Manny, in Spanish of course, how he does it? Why does he work so hard? He says that he loves to work and he loves to cook. We already knew that :-) \n\nI'll be back again and again for the bargain and the fantastic food.

We added fried yucca and arepa. For a table of five, it's great to eat a variety of eats with about $20 a person.

Now it's one of my all time top favs. When you first look at the place, it feels like a hole in the wall-small, literally maximum seating of 15. Don't let the name of the place nor decor fool you. \n\nManny: chef/mastermind is the only person there (which explains why his previous reviews say that the food takes too long). Sometimes he has apprentices (aspiring cooking students) volunteer there as cooking assistants. Manny loves what he does and it shows brightly on his food and presentation. Sit at the booth and you'll find yourself have a conversation and learn about what you're about to eat. \n\nWhat's interesting is that he doesn't have a typical menu where you look at what there is and order. He ASKS YOU what you want. Once you give him a sense what you like and don't like (there's a list of different types of meats and veggies), he will create something suitable for you. His source is the farmer's market and what he comes up with depends on what he gets that day! \n\nThe best part is that the prices are incredibly affordable! $20 for a four course chef's tasting!!!\n\nEach and every time I go, I get the chef's tasting menu and yes, it is wonderful and different every time! You get the same quality and style of a fancy pretentious restaurant you would normally pay for $60 plus, but instead you pay $20. \nMust I say more?\n\nQuick Tip: Don't forget to try their cheese arepas and order a tropical juice! Go there if you don't have prior engagements so you don't feel rushed and pressured.\n\n**It's also been featured on the Food Network, The best thing I ever ate- Best bang for your buck episode.

We went for the $25 four course meal and one sandwich shared for $8.50, one the waiter's recommendation.  Each dish was individually prepared with expertise and an amazing mix of flavors.  The starter fruit  salad featured figs and greens tossed in a light vinegarette.  Soon followed by smashed garbanzo beans  and chorizo on toasted bread that melted in your mouth.  Next came an amazing sandwich with chicken and cheese between cornmeal bread fried to a delicate crispness. The fish entree was served with cucumbers, rice and a seaweed fungus. My one piece of fish was slightly dry but the other was incredibly moist.  Dessert was tapioca with mangoes.

It would be so easy to miss the magic within. Manny, the chef, prepares amazing Venezuelan dishes for you with the freshest ingredients. The \"Chef's taster menu\" is out of this world - four incredible dishes in sequence, each one about a half-size of a full meal, including home-made chorizo, and expertly prepared arepas. Manny's pride and expertise are quite apparent. And he wears an awesome bow tie, while he cooks. Washed it all down with a Moro - a blended drink made from Colombian blackberries, delicious and frothy and cool and sweet. This is a gourmet meal for under twenty bucks.

My boyfriend and I went with two of our friends (neither the person who recommended the joint), and we were immediately happy at the intimate setting and the dinner-party style theme. We felt like extremely awesome hipsters eating at this place. \n\nThe first two dishes were pretty great. The salad had a lot of great fruit and a fantastic blue cheese, and the soup was a coconut shrimp suit with a curry (a little spicy, which I love).\n\nThen we ordered the arepas (we knew that they cost more, but only because of Yelp - not because our waiter volunteered this information), and they were fantastic. We devoured them. The corn cake is incredibly flavorful and perfectly crunchy.\n\nSo imagine the deep, inexplicable sadness I felt when the \"main\" course arrives - basically, an over-easy egg over porridge-y polenta with the smallest piece of sardine skin I've ever seen, and some decent roasted garbanzo beans. Like...come on. I know the dinner is $20. Raise the price and give me something substantial to eat as a main course. The flavors on the plate just didn't mesh well, and it was in such incredible opposition to the earlier, tasty part of the meal. \n\nThen the dessert came and I am almost cried, since I am the one who encouraged everyone to go here. It was HORRIBLE. It was an orange-blossom yogurt that legitimately tasted chemical-y, like perfume, with grapes that were way too strong, with some sort of powder crumble that was extra, extra sweet, and a pomegranate syrup. It was like drinking a bottle of some shitty Dolce & Gabanna perfume. I could barely choke down two bites. My friend, who literally will eat ANYTHING, and I mean that, couldn't finish and said \"Do you think they've actually tried this??\"\n\nWe spent $176 for four people - $20 menu each, two bottles of wine (about $36 a piece), and 2 arepas ($16).\n\nI've heard that the original chef left. I can't help but wonder if this four star rating is going to start steadily going down. \n\nNeedless to say, though we weren't starving, we were so unsatisfied, we went to a pizza joint around the corner and had beer and pepperoni.

He tries to change the menu up everyday, and always has something good marinating. Everything he makes has great, authentic, Venezuelan flavor. \n\nYes he does take a while, so if you are starving and can't wait, I suggest you try the taqueria or mcdonals next door.

We decided to go try this place out since the concept sounded so interesting with absolutely no idea what we were walking into.  We got there around 8PM on a Saturday night and were surprised at how tiny this place was - I think at full capacity, this place seats around 12 people.  We were told that it would be an hour wait, so we left our phone number and went to a bar near the restaurant to wait.\n\nWell, it turns out the wait wasn't an hour - we ended up waiting 2 hours to eat, and by then we were ravenous and had HIGH expectations due to the long wait.\n\nI am happy to say Chef Manny delivered.  We tried the Chef's Tasting Menu and had 4 courses of pure bliss.  On this particular day, Manny cooked chicken empanadas, goat leg arepas, smoked salmon on a bed of rice, and lamb chops.  Manny delivered each course to us personally and gave us an explanation of the ingredients - that was a nice personal touch.  The quality of the food at this tiny hole-in-the-wall restaurant actually topped many five star (and highly expensive) restaurants that I have been to.\n\nA word of warning, this place is not for someone with a picky palate or is in a rush.  The 2 hour wait was worth it for me, and this is a must try for anyone in the Bay Area...

Definitely a must try. \n\nempanada: the beef an potato empanada was good, but not amazing...the green sauce (same stuff on in the arepa) was definately the highlight tho...that stuff is mighty tasty. \n\n4 course tasting menu: for the first course we had grilled squid with brussel sprouts....it was good, but not great. For the second course we had some sort of green rice with mackerel. I love rice and i love mackerel so i loved this course. Each course to this point was definitely sort of a tease, since the portions were a bit small, but so far, so good. Third course was half a freshwater prawn with some veggies and little purple potato thingies. small portion, big flavor...For the last course, we had a single bone chop of goat with some chimichurri-ish type of sauce..This was my first time trying goat and i must say, it was great! i think this was my favorite dish of the 4...it was nice and salty (in a good way) and the bone wasn't frenched so i got some nice crispy bits of meat on the bone. \n\n\n\nAll in all, i would definitely recommend Mr. Pollo...Although the portions are small and service takes a long time, you have to know what you're in for. You're in for a unique culinary experience from a fun chef who enjoys working on the fly. I'm assuming he was just winging it and that was part of the fun and what made the wait totally understandable. It was neat to sit there for 2 hours and watch Chef Manny work his magic...Seriously, even though the portions are on the small side, i have no idea how he can make enough ends to keep this going. Get in there while it's still 15 bucks because i can imagine prices going up at some point. \n\n4 stars for great food from Chef Manny, and some funky 70's dance music...", "author": "matt h."}

The arepas are amazing. The Chef's tasting menu is great (especially when you consider you're getting fine dining for $15 aka food of this quality costs a LOT more elsewhere). Plus Manny is pretty good about substiuting stuff in the menu that you may not like (i.e. frog legs)\n\nHowever, if you're getting the tasting menu, I recommend getting something else - like an arepa or a taco/ burrito down the street at La Tacqueria- because the tasting menu is not very filling. The restaurant itself is TINY. He's tried to put as many tables in there as he could but there usually isn't enough seating at nights and it is cramped.\n\nHowever, once again, the food will blow your mind.", "author": "RAHUL D."}

I wish it came with more than 1 prawn\n5: Handmade chorizo meatball with grilled brussel sprouts - very juicy meat\n\nThe portions are really small and I left still a bit hungry.  I guess that's what you can expect for $15.  It was a nice variety of plates and I would go back again to see what else the chef has in store.\n\nThe place is super small.

UNREAL. \n\nTo boot, this chef LOVES cooking and loves food, as evidenced by his ear-to-ear grin when serving, the giant stalk of fresh brussel sprout he had on display from that morning's market, and his diligence behind the counter when whipping up your next course to order. \n\nThe best and most original meal I've had in San Francisco in ages.

But if you are a foodie and can ignore ambience and focus on the meal, (5-star presentation on old diner plates) and on the real culinary genius happening in this little place, you are gonna love it. \n\nAlso, I've only yelped maybe one other place in my life.

(odd response...) and haven't seen much of the food. He then called some people to let them know a table was ready, who so happened to walk by at the same time. They said, we gave up and ate down the street... so lucky for us, we were next on his list of calls. \n\nWe love the tasting menu. But at this point, we were both too hungry for the nice long meal we normally enjoy so we ordered two of the dinner plates. Have to say it was one of the worst meals I've had in a long time. Everything on our plates were fried, except for the rice and beans. (The rice was undercooked so it was still chewy and crunchy...) For the pork plate, I had little bits of fried pork that was overcooked and chewy. The chicken plate turned out to be a fried chicken leg. (Last time the meat was braised and grilled.) The plantains were also overcooked and was hard as a rock. Our meats were then topped with the same green sauce that's used as the dipping sauce for the empanadas. It was obvious, his help was not helping, and Manny was just trying to get food out. \n\nI love the place, but definitely one of the most disappointing meals I've had in a long time. For a one man show, Manny needs better help. We can put up with slow service but after all that waiting and have overcooked fried food that's worst than something I can get at a taqueria next door is not ok. Better luck next time.", "author": "Tammy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-12", "description": "I'm torn writing this review.  Mr. Pollo and Chef Manny are one of those incredibly special finds.  So much so I want to hold this place close to my heart and away from the thronging hoards. This was quite possibly the single finest meal I've eaten in all my years in SF.  Chef Manny is a very handsome, affable, gregarious, meticulous magician.  Every dish  was a work of art from inception to execution. \n\nThe Place:  Mr. Pollo is a teeny- tiny, eency-weency, itty-bitty, teeny-tiny  little hole in the wall.  My walk in closet is only slightly smaller.  Not kidding here this place couldn't hold my shoes.  Were it not for a bright yellow, giant relic \"Mr. Pollo\" sign above the door one could sneeze and easily miss it walking by.  There are twelve seats.  For the hordes who will no doubt begin flocking after this 143 review, there are twelve seats.  That's it.  No mas!  There are no reservations and here is how you should behave at the door.  Do not, I repeat do not barge into the restaurant impatiently when it's full.  There simply is not room and is obnoxiously mannerless.  Stand politely at the door and wait until either Chris the host or Manny himself have the moment to greet you.   You will be greeted warmly, your name and cell # taken.  If you're not already waiting out front around the time given, you will receive a call.  Run, do not walk to get your table once this happens.  Your taste buds will be so glad you did.\n\nThe Seating:  Accommodations are cramped.  Sometimes the table next to you will have to rise and move their chair for you to run to the bathroom.  Go before you come, nuff said.  Seriously.  Tables are tiny and you will bang elbows with your neighbors.  For me the best seats in the house are the two counter stools.  The opportunity to interact with Manny and watch his loving preparations are worth the discomfort of the stools and sloping counter.  That said do not for any reason let the cramped accommodations deter you from this experience. \n\nThe Chef:   Manny is adorable, bright eyed, friendly and obviously utterly in love with what he does.  He and his assistant converse constantly about each table.  Watching intently to see how quickly they are eating, if they are enjoying the dish and to regulate their activities to ensure every dish is finished and delivered at exactly the right moment.  Manny sees to every table personally.  Thanking each guest and receiving their compliments and critiques with an open, sincere heart.  His hospitality deserves five stars by itself.\n\nThe FOOD:  Luscious, vibrant, surprising, enticing, beautiful, incredibly delicious food.  The smart money is on Manny's tasting menu.  Four courses of love on a plate at a price that defies explanation.   Our four course tasting experience for two was $32.95 with tax. I felt almost criminally dirty paying such a small price for such a stupendous meal and consequently left a 50% tip. \n\nOur first course was fresh Monterrey Bay squid.  Sitting at the counter we watched while Manny hand selected each one seasoning them with the utmost care while his assistant chef (to whom I apologize for spacing his name) prepared the plates.  They are both artists.  Carefully placing every component assuring the perfect layering of taste and presentation.  The squid itself was fantastic.  Perfectly seasoned and tender, laid over a surprisingly light aioli scented with garlic upon bed of roasted golden turnip all sprinkled lightly with fresh dill.  Superb!\n\nThe second was a frog leg served with purple potato and a rutabaga salad.  I'm not a huge fan of frog leg but I could have eaten a bucket of these.  We watched Manny carefully bread the legs soon after we were seated.  The result were perfectly fried deliciousness in a crisp, yummy crust amazingly light and un-greasy dressed in a wonderful sauce.\n\nOur third was a slice of perfectly roasted pork roast slice served over perfectly roasted spaghetti squash dressed with creamy cilantro sauce and luscious strands of broccoli-rabe lightly dressed in a citrus dressing which transported the pork to a higher level.  A bit of each together was a bite made in heaven.  \n\nOur final course was goat.  That's right.  You heard it.  Billy (or maybe Betty) the goat.  Viva la Birra!!  Braised for god only knows how many hours we watched with great anticipation as the giant roasting pan emerged from the oven heretofore unseen.  Foil was removed and an aroma blessed I'm sure by Julia Child from beyond wafted to our noses.  Hubby who had crinkled his nose about the possibility of goat earlier now grinned like a schoolboy.  (He's SO cute when he does that.)  Served over rice with the most delicious roast tomato ever to cross my lips and pan drippings it was once again joy on a plate.\n\nDo not let a long wait or the small space deter you.  Mr. Pollo is an experience not to be missed.  Thank you Manny!!  I'd be watching over my shoulder Tyler Florence.", "author": "Russell D."}

I was very excited to go because I love these hole in the wall places that serves yummy food at decent prices.  When you go, you have to get their tasting menu ($15), which they will expect you to get when you go there.  Its a four course meal, small plates that the chef will make and you won't know what you will get until they serve you.  This place is very small and intimate.  You could fit about 12 people at a time.  They serve for lunch and close, then they open again at 6pm for dinner.  I recommend coming between 5-5:30 because you will have to wait until the next service if it fills up.  The second service starts around 7:30 to 8.   Their service is so great, because they will serve everyone at the same time during each course.  They will also recommend you to bring your own alcohol, and send you across the street to buy it if you want to.  During your dinner, there is live entertainment.  When people in the streets hear the music, they can't help it but stop to peek in.  The next time I visit SF again, I will for sure come back, because you will never know what kind of meal you will get next time.", "author": "Mary T."}

Me and two of my hungry hungry friends went to try this place last night. Hungry friend #1 had two coworkers recommend it to her so she took us both out to dinner. The tasting menu was delicious! Portions are on the smaller side but you are left feeling happy with your purchase. Chef Shawn (he's a real cutie) had us help him with prepping peas. Our dishes involved things like from seared steak, salsa with a little soy sauce, coconut cream, a little caviar, farm fresh strawberries and nectarines tossed in a light vinaigrette, and a fried corn cake. It was tasty, innovative, and surprising! Chef Shawn (I like the phonetic alliteration) asked if we wanted to go to the liquor store and pick up some beer. Sure thing, boss! It was a great night.

At least 4 parties came by while we waited and asked if we were the line to enter. None of the 4 parties who asked us actually waited with us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-10-09", "description": "I eat out in the city a lot. A very good friend of mine saw an expos\u00e9 on the food network introducing Mr. Pollo as an up and coming, must experience eatery in the heart of the Mission. Myself, my wife and our two friends decided to go check it out on a Friday evening about seven pm. We were lucky enough to find great parking half a block away. When we get to the restaurant, we discover it's a little tiny hole in the wall. In fact, it used to be a pizza by the slice place. When I say tiny, I'm talking you have to go outside to change your mind. Here's the layout: There are two 4 tops to the left of the door but they encroach into the path of travel thus making them really only three tops and they are so close that if one of the three tops actually had three at it then the other could really only fit two. On the other side of the door are two two tops. These are pretty standard and should fit two comfortably or could be pushed together for the only real four top in the house. There is one two top out side and a small counter bar that might seat four or five. In total, 14 or 15 spots max at one time inside. As for staffing, the cook behind the counter who I assume is Manny and one gentleman that seems to do everything else, we'll call him Dr. Delicious because he seems to think quite a bit of himself with his canary yellow skinny jeans, short sleeve white button up shirt and a turquoise blue tie tucked in at the second button sort like an ascot. When we arrive, there is only the one two top closest to the door and the two top outside available. There are twos at both three tops that had just started their meals and an older couple that was working on finishing up at the two top next to the wall. Dr. D, trying to accommodate us pulled in the two from outside to make a four top. However, by doing so it puts two ppl literally in the door, meaning the person with their back to the door would be sitting in the threshold of the door, preventing anyone from leaving unless the person at that seat got up. On e I figured out what Dr. D was up to, I said that we didn't want to sit there and would wait for the one two to open up so we could make a proper four top. Dr. D agreed though seeming somewhat put out. He took my number and suggested a few bars close by saying he would call when the table was ready, about fifteen minutes. An hour later give or take ten minutes, the phone rings. We head back to Mr. Pollo's to find two different ppl in the two top next to the wall and the same exact table configuration setup for us that we declined an hour earlier. I walked up to Dr. D and simply stated the obvious which was, \"We said we didn't want to sit in the door and agreed to wait for the couple to leave. That is obviously not the same couple so, we won't be eating here. Thank you\" and cut (movie lingo).\n\nThe one star that I gave Mr. Pollo might not be reasonable considering we never actually got to taste Manny's cooking but the incompetency displayed by Dr. D was so horrific that I won't bother to try again. One other thing worth noting when it comes to dining in the city. For some reason it has become acceptable to receive mediocre service in the city particularly if the food is good and we tip generously for this half assed service. I say, screw that! We go out to eat well and be served, otherwise we would get take-out or stay at home! Demand excellent service and tip accordingly. If the service is crappy, then tell them with your tip. Gratuity is for service that is over and above and should not be expected without effort. I'm tired of being treated like crap and then feel like I have to leave a 20% tip. I know that some ppl are just straight up assholes and I feel badly for the servers that have to deal with them. I am not an asshole when it comes to dining out and I should not have to suffer because someone else was. I am a generous tipper. If your a server, be a generous one and the effort will come back to you more often than not.", "author": "Tracy B."}

The chicken arepa could have used a little more cooking time, or something - it didn't quite gel, though was still tasty.\n\nThe Place: definite proud hole in the wall aesthetic (an old fridge wrestles for floor space with the 4 or 5 tables), mixed with some attempts to satiate the hip crowd (dark flowing curtains at the door).\n\nThe Service: It took quite a while to get my food (20+ minutes, and I was the only person there), but perhaps this was due to their just opening up.

(And the tables on the left half don't have it that much better, over in economy plus or whatever.)\n\nThis particular flight sits on the tarmac for a good forty minutes to an hour as you are waiting to order and in between courses. It lurches into the air abortively when dishes come, and then thuds down after you finish in a few bites. Most of them are competently done: we enjoyed the scallops well enough, the lamb and octopus were also solid. But then there's the suddenly large and incongruous arepa, whose cornmeal crust was rock hard, and inexpertly cooked skirt steak graced by an odd hidden fragment of...shell? Chalky rock? Whatever the case, it nearly took out a tooth, but with the waiter occupied enough tending to the other tables and doing prep work and dishes in the kitchen, and we being jammed awkwardly between a wall and another table of diners, I decided not to make any inquiries. Oh, desert? That's alright, I think our brains are hurting too much from the monumentally inefficient design of this restaurant, with only one cook lackadaisically making each tiny dish separately, also occupied with prep at the same time.\n\nDespite my agenda against 'fine dining,' I can appreciate that there are technical strengths here. I must also admit that the prices are, when taken in a 'fine dining' context, very low. But if I'm going to spend two hours at dinner, even though I'm accompanied by a beloved friend and the time is well spent regardless, I'd prefer the food and experience be truly excellent.

Picture this: a tiny room big enough to only fit 15 people at most (unless you were interested in sitting in someone else's lap).  The first thought that ran through my mind was, \"This is DEFINITELY going to be an interesting experience.  Let's hope that the food can catch my attention this quick.\"  And low and behold, I was NOT disssappointed.  My friends and I chose to order the chef's tasting menu which includes a small four course meal for only $15, and also decided to order an empanada as well.  The food was AMAZING.  I didn't think that it was possible, but each dish tasted better than the last.  They made it a point to explain the ingredients of every course, always emphasizing the farmer's market products used.  Since the restaurant is so small, I also couldn't help but notice the fact that people kept coming in asking to be put on the waiting list.  I would often hear the owner explain that it would be an hour wait, sometimes longer.  This place is defnitely in demand.  Since the menu changes often, I can't wait to come here again.  I still can't believe that I am bothering to YELP this place because I would rather it remain a hidden gem so that I don't have to wait in line in the future to eat here, but that's just selfish of me.  ;)     \n\nP.S.

Chris told us they just applied for a liquor license a few weeks ago so they don't allow BYOB anymore.\nMr. Pollo is definitely worth it a very unique spot in the Mission with very reasonable prices and well worth the wait (if you have to).", "author": "Alison B."}

I don't know where to begin with this place. It's actually called La Arepera, but they've kept the sign of the previous establishment for some reason. \n\nEvery new guest is treated like a regular in this tiny hole-in-the-wall that was founded chef Manny as an unadulterated venue for his blend of pan-american homestyle gourmet soul food.  Every item on the deceivingly small menu will satisfy and dazzle you and your friends.  Three basic options for a meal:  Dinner plate, sandwich, or chef's tasting menu. Very lean cuts of meat are often garnished with delicious salsa de ajo (garlic sauce).  I found the pork a bit tough for my tastes, but the lamb and chicken are excellent.  Manny seasons each slice of meat perfectly and lays out everything on the plate (garnish and all) to appear just as delicious as it is.  Everything is cooked to perfection, never overdone or soggy.  The seasonal array of vegetables are always excellent.  He prepares asparagus by peeling the stalk so that it will be just as thoroughly steamed as the tips.  For those on a tight budget, try a meat arepa.  Its a bit like a kabob pita sandwich.\nTo top it off, there are fresh squeezed columbian juices- and the new host and manager, Chris, makes these fruit juices into handmade ice cream. Try the tangy lulo or chocolate-walnut- it tastes like icing.", "author": "Peter B."}

Don't be fooled by the name, Mr. Pollo. I have gone to Mr. Pollo on two occasions and have been greeted by owner, Manny Torres Gimenez in this incredibly unassuming enclaved restaurant in the Mission. The food was exquisitely detailed, down to the fried mint accompaniment on my first entree. The meal started with a pumpkin consume with mint garnishings. The flavor and aroma wet my palette and appeased my soul on course for the second entree of the most delicate grilled octopus and fingered buttery red potato garnishing. Being that I mentioned that I cannot eat pork, Chef Naputi served up a delicious fried plantain dish for me that was dabbled in dill and made me \"ooh\" and \"ahh\". The fourth entree was a shredded beef and baby carrot with a rosemary sauce that amazed me and my guests on the journey. I tried one of their signature cheese arepas, which melted smooth with a pairing of white wine. Co-owner and server, Chris Cook brought over homemade cinnamon ice cream with chocolate sauce to our table that was the most amazing end to a lovely evening and five-course experience.

The couple who own the place talked to us about the food options and the husband was very excited to tell us how much he loves garlic and what we should try when we come back.  \nDespite all the yummy options, we had to go with the arepas.  We decided on the stuffed ones, with chicken, potato salad, and avocado.  In my ridiculous view that I am a bottomless pit, I did not heed the cook's warning that one would be enough and insisted on having 2 of them.  Of course, as soon as the first arepa arrived, I knew I was a fool.  It was huge.  I ate the first one with reckless abandon--the flavors were deep and tasty and an amazing mix.  The arepa was a bit greasy and, after getting to the bottom, was a bit turned off by the pool of oil.

Saw it a year or so ago on \"Best Foods I Ever Ate\" and have been meaning to try it out since it is relatively close to my workplace.  Read all of the reviews here as well, so came prepared for a wait (at lunch there was none) and prepared for small portions.   No wait...in fact, on a Tuesday we were practically the only ones in the restaurant from 11:30 to 1:00.  The positives of this place are everything the reviews say it is.  Food is exceptional.  Fine dining at an amazingly low price.  We had the 4-course tasting menu and it was really a great experience to be surprised at every turn.  Beautiful plates, inventive and such a variety of flavors.  Every bite was delicious and my guest and I cleaned all 4 of our tasting plates.  Prepared for the \"small portions\", as others have stated, we also ordered the arepas.  Wonderful arepas, but big mistake in that it would have been a meal in itself.  Advice:  If you're a hearty eater and concerned about not getting enough food with the tasting menu, then order arepas as well, but SHARE one!!  I'm a stout guy and the tasting menu alone would have been sufficient.  One final note:  BYOB means BEVERAGE not booze.  If you want something other than water, bring it.

Next came an array of crunchy veggies with a little piece of foie gras that I cut into even tinier pieces to savor each succulent bite. Goat empanada was to follow that did not disappoint.....and was very, very filling! Langoustine, so tender and moist, with hand foraged mushrooms and fruit/veggies on the side made me realize how awful all previous versions of langoustine were that I've eaten. Just when you think it can't get any better, the final dish of roast pork with brussel sprouts & greens made sure that we got all food groups possible throughout the evening.

The rest of the meal was pretty uneventful though. The juices were amazing, since this is the first time that I've been able to taste fresh maracuya and LULO (my favorite fruit in the world) for years.

With only 12 seats available I figured this place would be a madhouse of a wait, but we were seated right away (granted it was a Wednesday, but at 7:30 you still expect a dinner rush).  Mr. Pollo is legit; his concept of a daily tasting menu for $20 with whatever he finds fresh at the market is awesome, pair that with his precise technique and what you get is a magical four course meal.  First course was a chilled beet soup (basically borscht), with some veggies and grapes.  Never had borscht before but I loved it, and the grapes were a nice touch.  Second was scallops with more fresh veggies served with a blend of reduction sauces, this was probably my favorite dish.  Third was pork chops that were perfectly cooked, and fourth course was a lamb stew served over rice.  We also ordered the arepas, which I believe are always on the menu, and they are damn good!  Always order them.  We were so impressed with the meal that we couldn't leave without dessert, which also changes daily.  The three items were a tres leches cake, a chocolate mousse and flan.  Never been a big flan person and, as expected, was my least favorite dessert, but it wasn't bad.  The tres leches was very moist and flavorful, but that mousse stole the show for me.

Totally yummy.\n\nThe guy serving it picked it up from the steam table with his fingers to put it in the basket which put me off, but if you think about it, sandwiches are made by hand so, guess it won't kill me but still slight ewww factor.\n\nAnyway, a bargain at $1.50 each.\n\nThe curuba  (banana passionfruit, according to Wikipedia) smoothie was tasty as well, and at the going rate of $3.50 a fair price. (I had to back calculate it as the prices for drinks are not posted.)\n\nI'll be back to try more of the tasty food, slight ick factor notwithstanding. Sometimes the imperfect place has the best food.", "author": "Charles B."}

We went right at six when it opens, and were lucky to get the last, of three tables. Lots of people came in after us, left their cell numbers with the single waiter. We had the tasting menue: at 15$, this has to be the best deal in CA.", "author": "Bob B."}

Now that I'm pregnant, I got a craving for an arepa. After searching on the net I finally rediscovered Mr. Pollo. Now I can't get enough.\n\nIt's a tiny restaurant (\"hole in the wall\") with about three or four small tables. When I go, which is during the week, it's not crowded though.  The food is great and tastes like it's homemade. Aside from the arepas, so far I've had the chicken with rice and the chicken soup. Both were excellent. I'd highly recommend having the chicken soup on a cold and rainy day, like I did. The prices are cheap too. I usually spend $5-6 on my lunch. Oh, and the woman who works there is super nice too.  I always walk out satisfied.\n\nBy the way, one reviewer said they only have arepas w/cheese. Not true. They also make a cheese and chicken arepa. \n\nGo to Mr. Pollo! It's goooood!", "author": "Aim S."}

If you aren't a picky eater, and enjoy delicious food being prepared in an intimate setting where you can shoot the shit with the guy preparing the food for you, then this is the place for you.  I saw a segment on the food Network featuring Chef Manny's four course tasting menu for $15, and I was like...say what? Fifteen dollars for a four course tasting menu is unheard of, especially one that includes two fresh seafood courses, and on the day I had lunch with a friend, a steak for the fourth course.  Manny is very personable, and he needs to be to make it work. The place is tiny, so get there early, or at the very least be patient and go grab a beer across the street at Rosamunde. It's a one man operation, He cooks, he cleans, he entertains, and that in and of itself is a sight to see.", "author": "Russell M."}

So, I went back well in fact I've been back 4 times and each meal was better that the one before.  I must admit I wouldn't know a great Arepa if it bit me.  I had some and they were fine by my uneducated view.  The full course meals were as good as I have ever had and I might add I have eaten in fine restaurants in France, Japan, New York etc.  Manny creates an exceptional experience.  In short this is just great dining.  I kept waiting for the film crew to emerge from the back and say, \"You have just experienced the work some world famous chef\".  Well there were no film crews but there was a world class chef Manny.  Don't trust me go there and tell Manny how hungry you are and sit back.  I am certain, after 5 \"times at bat\" your dining experience will be more than noteworthy.  Manny loves food and says \"let me be your personal chef\".  Open from 12 to 12.  Don't miss it for less than $20 how can you miss.", "author": "George L."}

The host Chris and chef Manny are friendly and chatty. We were a group of 4 and all had the tasting menu which was delicious and the fact that we didn't know what to expect added to the anticipation. Yes the service was a little slow  but each dish was well worth waiting for. Definitely coming back :)", "author": "Jason W."}

Just don't be discouraged with the area and the small size of Mr. Pollo but admire the quality and absolute delicious taste and flavors of the food served!  A 5***** Gourmet Delight in the heart of the Mission! It is one of the stops in City Life Food Tours. Introduced by one of my friends and we reserved the place for the course of the meal. Every single dish was presented elegantly, tastes were phenomenal and prices were well within reason. I would expect these dishes in the Marina but from what I here the Chef has ventured off on his own from the Glamorous stuffy areas to a much more reserved setting where people such as myself just enjoy and can admire great food.........Sounds like the Rattatouile movie! Oh yea, its so casual the allow you to feel at home and bring beverages of your choice! Loss of 1 star only due to the size but i'll take a wild guess this is'nt the the owners first walk in the park so hopefully he gets into a bigger place! Thanks Mr. Pollo!!!!!!", "author": "Edward B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-07-02", "description": "The rating would have been higher as my meal was decent though overly salted.  No, we didnt have the 4 course meal. But seeing how long the people next to us had to wait in between courses, were still hungry at the end and said they would order what we had next time, I felt lucky in my choice.  No, the poor rating is for the curtain constantly billowing  over my shoulder (freezing as they wouldn't close the door) and the dismal dark environment in this hole in the wall . Also, the horrible service.  The waiter brought room temp water, never asked if we wanted anything else to drink and then never came back to our table until he asked us after we were 3/4 way through our meal to change tables because he wanted to seat some people that were waiting.  Seriously?   We were there a total of 1 hour 15 minutes, most of that time spent waiting for our food only to get rushed.  Almost felt like we were in some surreal art house movie. Not going back.", "author": "L A."}

But I was so surprised. If you go order the Chef's special. He will surprise you with gourmet fair. The trout with kiwi sauce was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. The empanadas and yuca frita were also amazing. I especially like the arepas because the masa was moist and you could really taste the sweetness of the corn. The wait staff and chef are extremely nice and accommodating. This restaurant offers a blend of Colombian, Ecuadorian and Venezuela delights but with a real gourmet flair that is unexpected for the area.", "author": "Sarah S."}

My first visit to Mr. Pollo was my first time trying Colombian food--I'd seen the place off of BART and decided to give it a try for lunch.  The guy working there was really friendly, and since I was the only patron, we ended up having lunch together.  I really enjoyed the lulo juice I had, and thought the stuffed chicken arepa was good but not excellent.  I came back another time, and got arepas with juice, and they were good.  Unfortunately, on my most recent visit to Mr. Pollo, the juice tasted much more watered-down, and the arepas a little squished and not as fluffy.  It would be sad to see Mr. Pollo's staple items decline.  I think I'll give Mr. Pollo another chance, and hopefully the juice and the arepas and whatever else I decide to eat will be better.", "author": "Reed A."}

I had the banda paisa, which is beans, rice, 2 kinds of fried plantains (maduros), fried chorizo, thin steak, and a small piece of fried pork belly. No arepa though. I drank a jugo de lulo in milk and it was great! I ordered a tamal santandereano and arepa rellena to go, both of which were very good. I probably would not come back to eat here, because I like Nicaragua restaurant  more and I am not often in the area.", "author": "kirin r."}

Despite living right down the street for the last 3 years I never actually ventured into Mr. Pollo until about 4 and a half months ago. Since then I have been back at least a few times a week. Chef Manny consistently hooks it up with great food at great prices. For me, I usually just order a dinner and let Manny decide what he wants to do. It varies every time and I have never been disappointed. If you haven't had the chance check this place out you really should. The food is always top quality and you would be hard pressed to find a meal like that for the price. The chef's tasting menu is great if you're hungry. Finally, the hours are ideal (10am to midnight with a short break in the afternoon) and it is always Manny behind the counter so you know you will be in good hands. Honestly I would give this place 6 stars if I could. At the very least grab a cheese arepa for a dollar fifty.", "author": "Will M."}
