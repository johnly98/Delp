That's a definite plus considering we passed up 20+ bars on Polk that were packed to the gills.\n\nThe wine selection was good considering the size of the place; it's not a huge selection like some other wine bars in SF have, but it's a good number for a neighborhood wine bar.\n\nAmbiance is an important factor in wine bars, so allow me a small section to talk about that. The room was nicely lit; dark enough that it felt intimate and not so dark that you can't see the expressions of the person in front of you.

And they were both clearly on dates. \n\nWith a 2 for 1 deal, however, it's a wonder that more guys don't skeeve around looking for drunken women. My group of nine was literally fall down drunk by the end of our evening: thank goodness for the soft cushions or one of the girls would have a nasty bump on her forehead.\n\nOver the course of a couple of hours, we all made great use of the 2 for 1 deal, and I enjoyed a riesling, cabernet, sauvignon blanc, and a rose for about $20. I can't remember the winery labels but I do recall them all tasting delicious in filled-to-the-brim pours. We were impressed with our waitress; doubly so when we asked for information about a particular wine and she responded \"I'm not exactly sure, this is my first day.\" If this is how the service is with someone who just started, I gleefully look forward to what someone with a little more experience can do. \n\nAll in all, a great spot that resulted in me writing a very drunken email to my now-abroad boy about how he had nothing to worry about with ladies night at Cafe Meuse. And that if nothing else, I'm scared to death of syphillis anyway.", "author": "Devon S."}

The place has that off the beaten path, neighberhood feel which feels like an intimate secret spot that will make your date dripping wet that you really know what you are doing as a man. Another major bonus is the outdoor cafe style seating and the fact that the Hyde street trolley passes by - it's like getting drunk in an 80s rice-a-roni commercial, and you can people watch tourists from Ohio with really bad shirts.\n\nFor beer drinkers they offer a variety of nice ales, which is good for those that discriminate against the vines.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-01-08", "description": "This is a revised review.\n\nGenerally I find the list to be average and somewhat overpriced. This is a place for people who don't know much about wine. In other words, I think that for each category of wine offered, there's probably a lot of wine out there that's significantly better than what's on the menu. But the average customer won't notice. \n\nSome of the things on the list just don't indicate to me that good choices are being made when it comes to selection. Paul Autard is a bad sign in any establishment- especially when there is so much good, cheap wine coming out of the Southern Rhone. That there's a ruby port on the dessert list is another bad sign. Ruby port belongs in the same category as cheap asti, lambrusco, and liebfraumilch.\n\nWe ordered a beef carpaccio for $9 that had about $0.20 worth of arugula and maybe a dollar's worth of thinly sliced beef. It was pretty flavorless.\n\nI think there's probably potential for improvement here, but I wasn't happy with my first experience.", "author": "Max B."}

Lets check Yelp, they will surely have a suggestion\"\n\nAnd thus began the journey for dinner in Nob Hill. After calling a few 4-5 star places, at 9 PM (those Europeans eat late you know), the group settled on Cafe Meuse because it was close, looked nice and they could take the party of 6, according to the girl on the phone, in 40 minutes. \n\nSo they waited and had some wine and eventually began their stroll to dinner. Upon arrival the group was pleasantly surprised at the nice warm dark decor but shocked to find that the \"table\" for six was actually the bar that comfortably seats 5. They were hungry so they decided cozy was okay. \n\nOne person in the group was a wine rep, and seemed to find their list acceptable for a wine bar. This same wine rep was afflicted with a very severe shellfish allergy and when she asked the waitress to verify that shellfish would not be touching the other 15 small plates the group had ordered the waitress replied, quite rudely \"I have no idea, I don't work in the kitchen\". \n\nStill trying to make the most of the evening, and show the visiting parents a nice time, another person asked if the waitress could ask the chef about this matter, since she had made it very clear to the group that she was not the kitchen staff. The waitress apparently wasn't speaking to the chef because she told the group \"I can't ask and can't guarantee this, the kitchen is small.\"\n\nOne person in the group, at this point, went to the kitchen herself to ask, all the while being yelled at by the waitress. Once the waitress realized she would actually have to go into the kitchen and  get an answer gave up her verbal pursuit. At this point she turned back to the rest of the group to let them know when she took the reservation she had no idea they would be ordering so much food at the RESTAURANT and that she was going to put the order in before the kitchen closed, even though the group had asked she please wait until it was determined if there was even going to be an order. The conclusion was that, though they discovered they could have eaten the food, the beyond rude service dissuaded them from even bothering. \n\nThe group was perplexed, insulted, hungry and fed up so they left to a very half hearted apology from the person who originally told them it would be no problem to take them after a 40 minute wait. They ate elsewhere and would never return. They would also never recommend this place to anyone else who wanted to spend several hundred dollars on wine and small plates, unless, of course, they wanted to spend that sort of money to be treated horribly. \n\nThe end.", "author": "Drue C."}

I'll have to go back to redeem myself.\n\nThe wine we fabulous though and the place is pretty small but also very shiek, good place to catch up with a friend.\n\nEDIT:\nI came here a second time with another friend but my star rating still stands.  The wine is tasty and we ordered a cheese plate as well.  But its just so pricey.  I don't think I'd ever go on any nigh but Wed.

Now we go every Wednesday when they have a 2-for-1 Ladies Night special on wine.  Rebecca, the kind and funny woman behind the bar, remembers our names and chats with us every time we come in.  She also hand makes the desserts every day, which are always delicious.  We also always order the $13 cheese platter, which features Manchego, Cotswald Cheddar, Brie, and Blue cheeses, along with dried and fresh fruit, nuts, and crackers.  Best deal in cheese plates in the city.\nThis is my go-to place for a lovely, homey evening where I always know I will feel welcome and have a good time.", "author": "Dana B."}

It's the only night I go, but I visit fairly often since it's in my hood. There are some hits and misses on the wine list in my opinion: the Cabernet  is a winner but skip the Zin (too fruity). \n\nAs for apps, the olives with feta are great. Bummer about the skimpy salad, though. Saucer size = too small. The cheese plate is solid but unremarkable.

There are plenty of reasons why I might have felt like this - but I think mainly it is that while its a small space with only about 7 or 8 tiny tables and the bar - the servers were insanely busy and made me nervous.  Of course they were both sweet and friendly but why did it take 20 minutes to get some bread with my glass of wine?  \n\nThe cheese plate was pretty, i admit - but so dull.  Cheese plates should be exciting and should include weird random cheeses you haven't had before.  Otherwise I can buy them in bulk from Safeway - like these cheeses: goat cheese, gouda, bleu and  brie.  BORING!! and for $14 not so much of a deal.\n\nMeuse is a nice to place to sit in the corner and have a wine.   Don't sit at the bar, it will make you anxious.  Oh!

I'm intrigued enough that I'll return.", "author": "Elizabeth D."}

I've found the wines by the glass selection is a little conventional, though they did have an interesting sparkling red Shiraz from Australia the last time I went in. The water is great. I know that sounds random but it really is a highlight. They infuse cucumber in their water, which gives it a great flavor. Single guys might want to check out Wednesdays-- ladies night seems to be popular ;)", "author": "Andrew M."}

As far as 'Ladies Night' goes, guys, that's what it is. Don't be fooled by some reviews that say, 'you should go to meet attractive women here'. They are attractive but they're there for 'ladies' night, meaning no dudes are wanted. Unless you're willing to fork a few hundred dollars worth of food and drinks towards them. And what the hell is up with the chicken skewers with peanut butter on them as sauce? It's seriously JIF peanut butter. Very creative!", "author": "Javan E."}

Women are complicated).  How was the wine?  I vaguely recall it being pretty good; well, I had enough to not remember exactly, so it must have been pretty good, huh.\n\nThe ambiance is memorable, though: cute and romantic, a perfect fit for the vibe I was looking for that evening.\n\nThe staff was friendly and unobtrusive.  And the staff is nice and (for us anyways) flexible on closing time (which I think someone else mentioned in a prior review).  My date and I started making out a bit and we didn't realize it was getting late until we looked up and saw we were the only ones left at a table :)\n\nSo, mad props to Cafe Meuse!!!", "author": "T L."}

So with the suggestion of one of our friends we decided to indulge in the two for one \"Ladies Night\" at Cafe Meuse. When we arrived our two friends already had a table. Our watress was very attentive and brought us our wine promptly. We also ordered the Cheese platter and the Spinach Artichtoke dip, both very delish! I ordered the Sangeiovese and the Syrah, both pretty decent and not too pricey like some other Wine bars in SF. We all had our fill of wine and food and we were amazed when paying the bill how inexpensive it was. I'll definately be back here, great spot to grab a glass of wine and catch up with friends.", "author": "Sarah R."}

Not super trendy or 'cool' but it hits the spot for a girls night of wine, small bites and gossip to catch up on the week's up and downs of love, work and life. We were on our way to Amelie but didn't feel like walking all the way and saw a sign for 'ladies night' so we decided we'd make  detour which ended up taking all night. We started with a cheese plate and I had a pinot grigio - my favorite so i stuck with it for the rest of the night. The date tried a few others all of which she was happy with. The cheese plate was impressive, several cheese, fruits, bread and honey in the middle which was the perfect compliment. We each had a salad, both of which hit the spot. We stayed for at least 2 hours and were very comfortable in what felt like a dark living room/dining room with friendly patient service. Definitely a good place to come with a buddy, not really the best date place. This will be a regular of mine since it's only a block from my house and their thursday special is quite tempting.", "author": "Audrey V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-01", "description": "We had a reservation for a party of eleven people and it's a very small place. They basically stuck a bunch of table that were designed for two together to make one big table.  We were a little cramped. However the service was very good. There was one waitress servicing the whole place and she never stopped moving. The menu is limited but we tried lots of items and everything was good, especially the tomato soup and chicken satay. I tried several wines and nothing blew me away, but all were fairly decent.", "author": "Paul S."}

But every single time I've been there (each time convinced I would have a better experience), service has been horrendous - downright rude, in fact. Look, there's no need for attitude - you work at the bar, I'm here to partake in drinks, no need for you to be snobby. Really. I've come here at all different times - late afternoon, late evening - regardless of how many customers there are, it's so hard to get served. Peace out.", "author": "Lemon S."}

I had the same thing at Rouge et Blanc earlier this week, for the same price and it was cowgirl creamery cheeses, excellent meats, olives, fun condiments that truly compliment the cheeses (mustard should not have been the only condiment on that plate at cafe meuse).\n\nthe chevre & crostini and beef carpaccio plates were good, but not at all exciting.\n\nwith 8 glasses of wine (a couple of which were free for me) and a few plates it was over $100. say what??!!!?? normally it would seem fair...but...\n\nwe felt like it was pricey for the such poor quality. the gal serving was super sweet, but scattered towards the end of the night and it took a while to get out of there.\n\nthe ladies night deal is great, but the quality of the wines, getting info about them and the food is not very good. go for 2, get one free, then definitely eat somewhere else. \n\ni don't think we'll ever go back, which sucks since we're long time local residents in that neighborhood.", "author": "Lady L."}
