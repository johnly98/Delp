Dada art, sangria to split, and and an all-ages hang all make this place exceptional, like a post-card from another era of San Francisco that we might be able to hold on to if we actually push back on gentrification. \n\nThe average group here is a couple or two friends, splitting sangria and likely a bite to eat. The food isn't the star here, the ambiance is. We got the flan, which was fabulous, and the maker of said-flan was onsite drinking at the small bar. There is table service if you get food, or bar service if you don't. \n\nHighly recommend for anyone looking for a long night of conversation, art, and friends in a small space free from the SF tech-bro scene.", "author": "Molly H."}

It's kind of cool to see all of the stuff on the walls but at the same time it's pretty creepy when you look closely. It reminded me a lot of the creations Sid from Toy Story would create. Also it smelled like dirty cats, but don't worry you get used to that after a few minutes... ew. \n\nI was honestly shocked to see there was a food menu. Just judging on the smell of the place I would never even consider ordering food here. Not to mention when looking around it is difficult to find a kitchen... and after reading through previous Yelp reviews it sounds like most of it is canned and microwaved. We sat in the back and had two glasses (more like goblets) of sangria. The sangria is definitely good and the portion size is good, but you can get good sangria at a lot of places.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-23", "description": "At first glance, you might think Radio Habana Social Club is intimidating. To be fair, from the outside, it looks more like a crazy person's apartment than an actual restaurant. I don't think anyone would fault you for completely missing this gem in the Mission, but if you've got a somewhat adventurous spirit, I suggest you open that door on Valencia and let yourself escape to Cuba. You will not regret it.\n\nJust to give this review a little context- Cuba is, in many ways, like a real-life time machine. Because of Cuba's history and the US embargo, Cuba is saturated with old cars and buildings, and has the same aesthetic it did in the 1950's. \n\nMuch like Cuba itself, Radio Habana Social Club is kept at a balmy 75-80 degrees (F), and is adorned with colorful relics of the past;  It really conveys the feeling that you've stepped out of reality and into someplace special- possibly the island of Cuba. The artist (and owner) has taken items we would normally discard as 'junk', and turned them into evocative pieces of art. I've noticed a general trend of babies portrayed in interesting ways, exploration of anatomical forms, as well as some distinctly ironic pieces and tributes to historical figures and celebrities from the past. One of my favorite pieces is hanging on the right-hand wall when you're facing in from the door, and features an angry male doll with the bottom half replaced by an electric drill- to me this seems like a literal representation of the saying, \"i'm going to drill that girl\". Fascinating. \n\nYou can (and should) easily spend hours here exploring the resident artwork, as well as the photo collections on the back wall that change every month. And to assist you in that task, I recommend you enjoy a large princess cup (copa de reina) of their fantastic sangria. It is delicious, refreshing, and cheap, without being cloyingly sweet. I'm no aficionado, but its the best I've had.\n\nThe food, on the other hand, is only ok. The plantains are standard, but the empanada and ropa vieja were both disappointing. The empanada felt stale, and the ropa vieja lacked flavor and seasoning. I don't mind though, because the food was reasonably cheap, and I was more than content enjoying my sangria and admiring the amazing atmosphere of this place.", "author": "Zameer A."}

Well, imagine that sort of device, along with every nic-nac from every swap meet you've ever attended in your entire life, all adorned to the interior walls of a 20x20 foot room, and you've got Radio Habana.\n\nEverything from Matchbox cars to a John Lennon action figure with a gun next to his head rests on the walls inside this place, which clearly evokes all kinds of different reactions. Not sure what to think about the Lennon display, but the coo-coo-clock with a hand drill sticking out is pretty great.\n\nThey have a really small bar, and I'm willing to bet 25 people could comfortably fit inside this space before it becomes asses to elbows.

And hot.  Why on Earth is it so hot in there?  And its so tiny that apparently they only reheat food they purchased elsewhere because they are not whipping up gourmet meals in that kitchen.  I didn't order anything, but my friend got a mocha.  When he finally got the attention of the woman working at the bar she acted like he was inconveniencing her.  The way she leaned over and placed her hand on her temples, it was like my friend was asking her to solve world hunger.  \n\nHe paid $3.75 for some Ghiradelli mix that you can pick up at Safeway.  It was served scalding hot.  By the time he gets his drink my friend is in a hurry to get out of the restaurant before the waitress looks at us and sighs again.  But he can't hurry because the drink is too hot.  \n\nWe witnessed the waitress be really nice to someone who spoke Spanish to her, so maybe not speaking English is the key, I don't know.

However, I had to write a review so people will know what to expect. At first, I wanted to give this place 2 stars because despite the decor and food, I had a good time. There was a local guitarist and singer that came by this tiny, hole in the wall place to perform, and I was really entertained. But I can't say that I'll be back. I'll just watch them perform somewhere else. The decor is enough to keep me away despite the good service and good time that I had here. Therefore, this place gets 1 star for 'eek! methinks not'.\n\nDECOR: The decor here gives me that sick-to-the-stomach, nervous, uncomfortable feeling (that feeling you get, when something that you're absolutely dreading starts approaching). My friend said that this means that it's 'art', but can everything that evokes strong emotion out of you be considered art? Honestly, the 'art' sucks. If you've seen Toy Story, it's like Sid grew up decided to open up a tiny place to eat and glued all his distorted dolls on the walls (Oh, and he's all grown up so he has some 'mature' messed-up dolls). You have to see for yourself, (look at the attached pictures) but the wall is COMPLETELY covered with straight up weird stuff. I never say that things are 'weird' because I really believe that things that are different gives a place character. I actually enjoy places that are unique. But if 'unique-ness' was a scale, this place wouldn't even be on it. It's just creepy and pervy. The person who came up with this has a pretty sick and twisted mind.\n\nSERVICE: I think our servers were the owners. I felt at home here. By the end of the night, this place was really crowded/cramped, and everyone was talking to everyone even though they came with different groups of people. This was pretty fun.\n\nFOOD: I shared a tamale with a friend. I don't know why people love the food so much; it was okay and overpriced. Haven't they had more delicious ones in socal? Even though it edible I only had like one or two bites. I couldn't eat because i felt so uncomfortable from the decor. I felt like a zillion eyes (dolls) were looking at me, and actually kind of wanted to throw up. In addition, the kitchen is exposed to the customers. It is big enough for you to walk in and turn around 360 degrees; it's that tiny. I was able to see them make the food. It looked pretty unsanitary. I was not happy. I don't know if all restaurants are like this (because I usually can't see), but I didn't appreciate how the 'cook' who's also the waiter touched the lettuce with his bare, unwashed hands. \n\nDRINKS: Our party got pitchers of Sangria. It was pretty deliciously authentic. If I could just give a rating for the drinks without thinking about the decor, I'd give it 4 stars!\n\nSo in conclusion, unless I have a strong desire to feel nauseous and throw-up and have nightmares, I'll probably never ever be back.", "author": "Eunice R."}

It is now the scene of my favorite birthday moment: The bartender/server/social diva, Shawn, had her friend over at Garcon (yum) get me a desert. They lit a candle, turned off all the lights, and everyone (all 15 patrons that could fit in there) sang the worst rendition of happy birthday I ever heard. It was the perfect birthday dinner.\n\nPS- I am vegetarian and love the food there, the sangria is authentic, and the owner's wife creates all the art and painstakingly makes it look random. There's actually method to the madness.", "author": "Regina S."}

I have some food restrictions and she was not only unable, but unwilling to check the ingredients. Apparently, they do not make any of their own food. They buy it elsewhere and then just heat it up!\n\nThe only thing really going for this place, to me anyway, is the little man in the hat who serves up sangria.

The RHSC has good, simple, well-priced food in a small (tiny) venue - so homely, you could be in someone's kitchen. \n\nSo I imagine it is in Cuba - you feel like you are in some subversive Cuban cafe, drinking large glasses of sangria, speaking in hushed tones, and passing notes to the waitress. And, as with all fine repressive regimes, the people find solace in art and religion, making a message out of whatever they can find, completely covering the walls with skulls and posters and artifacts and black magic.\n\nGo here with a good conversationalist and speak of all the rights and wrongs of the world and plot how you will fix them.

Big groups should stay clear as there are only a few tiny tables in the cramped restaurant.  I also recommend that you come for the sangria and not the food.  The food wasn't bad, but the menu tiny.  Each dish involved a mound of rice, black beans, salad and something like an empanada or samosas.

The decor is like every shrine to John Lennon, sexual pun art poster, paint-solidified clothing article, antique framed poster of leftist hero, and hanging plastic mannequin part you've ever seen, glued, stapled, and nailed like a barnacle colony to every available square inch of surface.\n\nThe food is pretty to look at but bland as a TV dinner, I guess that's the price of admission.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-30", "description": "My boyfriend and I went there for my birthday and it was just the two of us. We had been desperately in search for some authentic (or at least close to it) Cuban food since our recent trip to Miami. In our search we stumbled upon this little whole in the wall gem of San Francisco. \n\nLocation: Walking up to the restaurant, we were at first deceived as its appearance from the outside seemed like that of a small convenience store struggling to attract customers as it was tucked ever so far away from the hustle and bustle of endless rows of restaurants a few blocks down. However, once we walked in, San Francisco, the Mission, and almost the entire state of California disappeared! Radio Habana Social Club whisked us away to Little Cuba (Miami) and good old Habana with its quirky, abstractly, zany, and creatively decorated walls.  A plethora of memorabilia dating back from the late 1920s (possibly older) all the way up to the present was like a blitz of art one would find in Dali's Figueres museum, even Van Gouh's ear was artfully arranged above dining tables!  And nevermind the tight quarters, this place almost commanded your attention to the walls as no corner, table, or plate was left untouched by the magic this place visually created.\n\nFood: Unlike its atmosphere, a complicated and unimaginable compilation of old and new Habana-esque memorabilia, the menu was simple and to the point. It had 5-6 main dishes and possibly 3 appetizers, all of which were close if not original cuban recipes. It was a month or so ago since we were last there, so I the name of our dishes escape me at the moment. What I can tell you is that the actual meal was delicious. The recipes were simple, as they should be, and left us feeling contentedly full. \n\nPrice: Excellent. It was perfectly reasonable for what we ordered.\nService: Hospitable and kind. In fact, my boyfriend (a native Cubano) over heard the cook (Husband) arguing with the waitress/ host (his wife) in Spanish (cuban style). For him and for me, this made us feel more and more as though we were taking part in something authentic, real, and totally untouched. And though they squabbled, their kindness to us and their hospitality did not falter.\n\nOverall: If you want to allow not only your taste buds, but also your mind a little escape to Habana, this place is just for you. I will say this, be prepared to wait if you venture into this place on a weekend!", "author": "Michele H."}

I had the empanada (Lean Pockets are better!), and my friend had the tamal (just okay but the lady at the 24th st.

At first we were the only people there and once we ordered our food one of two people in the restaurant went into a room that we had a clear view of and started prepping our meals. Its super cozy and funky. It seems like all the people who eat there are locals. We had sangria and we both decided to order the ropa vieja plus an order of fried plantains. I've had a lot of Cuban food before and this was actually almost like a healthier version. It seemed less heavy and greasy and seemed more fresh while still maintaining the typical zesty flavoring. The sangria was delicious and they gave us huge glasses. I'll have to admit I got a bit tipsy from that one glass. Overall the food was great and the ambience was cozy but lively.

The food was suitable but not outstanding, but the d\u00e9cor and vibe made up for it.  \n\nAs for the food, my biggest beef was the lack of choices and the too small portion sizes.  In terms of main courses, you can choose between five or six \"entrees\" each of which come with a salad and rice/beans.  The problem is that none of the entrees are truly entrees.  I'm sorry but an empanada or a few smallish meatballs is not an entr\u00e9e in my book.  The portions are too little to feed the truly hungry, but might be perfect if you don't like feeling absolutely stuffed after dinner.  That said, the food itself was tasty.  My meatballs were juicy and smothered in a tangy tomato sauce, part Italian part Latin.  The black beans were very flavorful.    \n\nThe d\u00e9cor and vibe did make up for the empty spot in my stomach.  The place is cozy and the walls are covered with plenty of conversation pieces.

Rule of thumb: if I can't down three glasses of it because it contains too much sugar, it's not for me.\n\nWARNING: Bold statement ahead:\n\nThis is the best sangria I've had in the city. No lie. I had, um, three (plus one) glasses and while I did walk away a bit tipsy, it was worth every minute of the hangover the next day. The maestros at this small, kitschy restaurant somehow created a concoction that blends the perfect amount of sugar, fruit, and alcohol that renders it phenomenally drinkable. Maybe too-much so...my friend had to convince me NOT to have another glass. Thanks, buddy.\n\nThe menu is very sparse, but tasty. We ate the vegetarian samosas (yum) and quiche; they come with rice and beans and a side salad. Served in over-sized olive dishes, it doesn't look like a ton of food, but alas, is the perfect helping. The best part? It's CHEAP!\n\nThe restaurant itself is quirky, fun, and SMALL, so expect a wait. It's also unmarked (or at least subtly so) but keep looking around on the corner...it's there.

(Delicious meaning it gets my vote for best sangria in the city, with a close runner-up of the Mission's Picaro tapas restaurant.) Although the few times I've been the staff hasn't been too keen on speaking English, they are still always very friendly and willing to make room for you in the cramped, zany dining room (I use the term loosely). Very San Francisco. I'd suggest if for any small group of friends that wants to get wonderfully inebriated and talk for hours, or -- even better -- for a new couple who just can't seem to get enough of one another's conversation. It's crampedness can be either romantic or intimate, provided the company is in good spirits. DON'T go here with a large group, or with anyone boring. \nI always get the sangria and the samosa dinner. It's satisfying.

Yes, and less than a week after my last visit I must revise my review in order to warn you of the fantastic danger that is the RHSC cheesecake.\n\nNicole + Miss P + Munchies = dangerous combination already, but little did we know what we were up against when we ordered this dessert.  First we started with a huge goblet of sangria and the delicious meatball dinner which comes with their awesome rice and beans and salad.  Well, the first sangria went down so well that we decided to share another...um, and another.  And when asked if we wanted dessert, we had no choice but to partake.  We shared a slice of the cheesecake. However, this is no ordinary cheesecake.  The cake is served on top of coconut syrup and heated ever so slightly.  This seemingly simple twist on the standard is actually absolutely mind-blowing!!  Warming the cake makes the cheese somewhat velvety which then oozes over the graham cracker crust that has absorbed the coconut syrup.  Collectively these elements produce a taste and texture that I've never experienced before.  It's just such a beautiful creation!  So wonderful in fact, that we had another slice!  Miss P and I definitely had an indulgent evening but I urge you to do the same and experience this cheesecake that will undoubtedly change and expand the flavors in life as you know it!\n\n*************************************************\n\n\"Work like you don't need money,\n\nLove like you've never been hurt,\n\nDance like no one's watching.\"\n\nAnd Decorate like you just don't care!\n\nYou will never run out of things to look at while you sip your Sangria, grub on your meatballs, and bop to a variety of live music that comes through this tiny hole in the wall.  Every inch of wall space and most of the ceiling space is covered with the most random of random things that will make you go \"Hmm\" and \"Ugh\" and \"Eew\" and \"Oh\" and \"OH MY!\"  \n\nVisit this inexpensive treasure trunk packed full of friendly hosts, comforting delicious food, fun sangria, exciting tunes, and a lively atmosphere!

I can see where you white people would be convinced that it is that good, but in all honesty, it really is A-Ok. \n\nAlso a lot of the reviews seem to be on the decor and the sangria with very little mention of the food. I have had cuban food, this wasn't very cuban... It had a cuban flare to it I guess, but didn't remind me of cuba. They were small portions, which is fine... they weren't really small portions so much as real portions... I think a lot of people are too used to the giant chain restaurant portions that Cheese Cake Factory and Chilies provides. \n\nThe menu, like the restaurant, is small and a bit of a mix-mash of flavors. The tamale, well, I don't know, it just looked out of place, maybe it needed the corn husk around it when served, which is a Cuban dish, tamales were brought over in the 1920-1950's, before the revolution. I am sure it was a mexican inspired dish, probably brought over when Cuba was a huge entertainment destination. \n\nA Samosa plate? Really? REALLY? I have never seen samosas on a cuban menu before. Maybe they really are on one, and I just have never seen it, maybe it is hidden in the whose who of cuban menus. No idea, but it just didn't seem very cuban to me. \n\nBoth plates mentioned above were enjoyed by my friends who had ordered them. I ordered the empanada plate. I was very excited to see the empanadas on the menu. I had just seen the Hipster Olympics youtube video ( very funny http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kAO4EVMlpwM) They said that empanadas are the new cup cake towards the end of the video, and I had a hankerin for empanadas for the rest of the day.... so yes, I was very excited to see empanadas on the menu. That was until the plate came out.  This wasn't an empanada.. Not any one i have seen before. This was a puff pastry of sorts... layers of dough wrapped into a neat little package... and the worst thing of this... IT WASN'T FRIED!!! So admittedly i was a little upset with Radio Haban Social Club for this. It also seems a bit stale. Looking in to the kitchen I see every thing being cooked in a toaster oven, the place is tiny, so I get it, but they sell small deep fat fryers. I have seen them on America's test kitchen, Christopher Kimball has done a review on them. They make small enough ones to fit inside the kitchen. The over all flavor wasn't too bad, like I mentioned the puff pasty it's self was a bit stale, but the green sauce on top made up for that. The plate has nice presentation. Pyramid of rice in a moat of black beans... The beans of some jalapenos cut into them which give it a nice spice. \n\nHere is the overall thing.. I didn't love my plate, but I didn't hate it. This is a good place to come and explore. Like mentioned in every other damn review, the walls are magically adorned with creepy barbie dolls and other junk. The sangria was sweet, I had a bit of a cold, so that is really all that came through on the sangria side. I would come back for the experience with new people. It is a fun place, but the food is eh. Leaving here I wanted real empanada's and I guess... a better take on cuban food. Maybe if they changed their name to Mission Social Club & Cafe I would be less disappointing by the not so cuban food they have, and take it as a little latin american cafe... I would probably give it 3 stars still, but then I wouldn't be a such a little bitch about it not being traditional cuban food. I'll be back. It was fun.", "author": "danny e."}

Pretty much everything I could say has been said in reviews before. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the food was only mediocre. Then again, if you want a 5 star meal you probably shouldn't be eating at Radio Habana.  Still, the food was decent (and cheap).  One negative to my experience: my friend and I got to listen some dumb frat boy talk about puking the night before. Oh well, it's not RH's fault. Stick to the drinks & gazing at the decor & this place will be more than satisfying.", "author": "SL N."}

Good place to grab a beer (no frills, just order Negra Modelo) and take in the packrat decor.  The food is cheap and quiet good (had samosas and frittata). The staff is really friendly, attentive and warm.", "author": "Celeste A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-11-16", "description": "Aka, Radio Habana Social Club, this spot is a terrific little hole in the wall.  Take your time when you're there, order an empanada or samosa, have a glass of sangria, and ponder the wonderous walls ornementation.  This is the kind of place that feels like Latin America - the pace is slow and the people are friendly.  While the name is Cuban, the food is an interesting mix (small menu, but good and with geometric presentation!).  If you order Sangria, two of the beret-wearing waiters that I've had actually slowly write out the full word on their pad of paper.  You have to ask for the bill, they don't bring it.  Word.", "author": "Mission D."}

On most nights you will find folks willing to debate politics and music. Being of a younger generation than most of its patrons my friends and I lovingly refer to it at times as \"old man bar\". However you don't let that scare you off...but also don't plan to meet your future husband here unless you are into older Latin Americans.", "author": "Emily C."}

Though the kitchen was closed, I stayed as the waitress/hostess and a patron join the guitarist for an impromptu flamenco jam. A cup of toothpicks were her maracas, while the gentleman grabbed a stool to use as a drum. This place is almost magical in its romantic spontaneity.", "author": "Joshua D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-21", "description": "It's good to note that the name of this place includes the words \"social club\" rather than restaurant. It's perfectly fine and atmospheric for socializing. The art is the main attraction- it's absolutely bursting with it, and worth the trip alone. The food is limited and only ok. I'm pretty sure most of it is made in a toaster oven or microwave. The cheesecake was horrible- it had definitely been frozen and (mostly)thawed, but tasted worse than store-bought. If it's possible to get cheesecake from a vending machine, I think that's where they got theirs. We ate 2 bites of it and gave up. The waitress looked confused by that, but surely she's seen it before? The sangria was drinkable, but very sweet. I could barely taste the alcohol. I didn't try any of their other drinks- so maybe that's where they excel. The service was- well, I like to think they were trying to provide the type of service I've often seen in foreign countries where establishments sincerely want you to sit and drink and socialize and wouldn't dare bother you with a bill for fear of making you feel unwelcome. So, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt there. In summary- go once, for the experience, but once is probably all you really need.", "author": "Bonnie C."}

I could just sit and stare at all the stuff in here all day.  Jambalaya and plantains were delicious but a bit overpriced, and the portions were small.  The decor makes the prices worth it though.  It's an overall EXPERIENCE (not just food) that you're paying for with this place.  I will definitely come back here many times and recommend it to people - just for the wild decor!  Very limited hours.  I love that it's so small and cozy - only about 5 tables.  Oooh, and I love how it was all warm inside on a chilly night.  Quirky.  Memorable experience.", "author": "Tuesday J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-29", "description": "This place is a unique find among the many bars in the Mission. I like the intimate feel (small) and the informal hospitality (maybe only one or two people on staff). Unfortunately the things that I like about Radio Habana, also make it a bit of a tight squeeze for a party of over 2 or 3, and it can take a while to get your food/drink. The wall decor is outrageously weird, borderline frightening, so maybe keep young kids away (seriously- I mean dismembered dolls, etc). Still its a cute place, has a very cool vibe, almost a step into another country/time. I definitely recommend a visit, try the sangria!", "author": "Kika S."}

You can spend hours looking at the walls and still find new things. The outside is so covered with tchachkis that I didn't even know what the name of this place was for the longest time. They sell beer and wine from the bottle, and yummy cuban food. The tall waitress there is cool, and looks like a pirate.", "author": "Jenny Q."}
