The view was amazing and the swing was super fun! The hike was really just a short climb up a small hill. There was a very short line when we got there, and people were very kind about taking pictures for us. At one point, these little girls would not get off the swings but I could see why they wouldn't want to get off haha. It's such a fun spot if you love viewpoints and are able to find some fun in the simplest things like a good ole' swing. Super recommended if you're ever in SF!! \n\nps. If you happen to have a hard time finding this spot like we did, it's just at the top of the hill facing the bay side, not land. And make sure to bring a jacket!

It's even better in the sense that you are much closer to the fresh air of the Bay and you don't get a million tourists because most of them have never heard of Bernal Heights.\n\nThe views are spectacular on a clear day and a lot of people just hang out and picnic looking out over the views of the city, bay, and beyond.  Many people come here with their dog.\n\nFor hiking there are a few different trails that go up and around the hill but there isn't a definite path so there are a few different options to explore. The incline isn't too strenuous so if you are doing this as a hike and want a better/longer workout I'd suggest incorporating  some of the numerous staircases located in Bernal Heights.  The Esmeralda stairs located on the Western side of the hill is probably the most popular one.  It has a path directly to the trails as well as an amazing long slide.", "author": "Joan W."}

Even the parking's nearby area is a great photography spot.\n\nThe hike is easy uphill. I took a shortcut downhill (walking on the hilly dirt path instead of the flat main path), but find the dirt very dry & slippery.  There were many rocks that would roll once stepped on. I was wearing decent walking shoes but not particularly with strong gripping soles. I personally think the shortcut paths can be better laid out/ maintained so it's safer and easier to walk on, especially for kids.\n\nWhen I visited on a weekday evening, this place had more dogs than humans. Not a bad thing, but gets a bit uncomfortable if you are slightly allergic! Some dogs are unleashed, which made it a bit challenging to stay completely dog-touch-free (?) throughout the walk. \n\nAlso couldn't find the swing!!

It's dog friendly, has a tire swing and a tree swing at the top, and has a 270 degree breathtaking view of the city. The view alone sold it for me. You don't realize how high you're going up until you start seeing the top of roofs. It's a short hike that anyone  and any dog can easily do. There is a short cut too, but just be careful since it's steeper and there are rocks that can make you slip, but very doable! I took the short cut with my dog and got to the top within 20? 30? minutes. I was just taken away by the view. I kept taking photos after photos haha. \n\nOnce you get to the top you will find a tree swing and a tire swing that a lot of people come there to take photos of. \n\nYou can continue hiking down to the other side to get down from the hill. Parking is limited on one side, but if you go through to the other side there is more parking in the residential area.

We primarily came to this park to visit the swing at the top of the hill, but it's also a popular hiking spot for locals as well as a dog park. There's apparently a teal colored rock somewhere and a labyrinth formed by stones at the bottom of the hill (in some odd design it seemed like). We parked on Bernal Heights and ended up making a big loop and climbing over several hills before we reached the swing. There's an easier way to get to the top if you start by the labyrinth I think. \n\nBut anyway you hike, you're going to get a good view when you reach the top. If it's not too hot or too cold and you're there on a good day, you'll oversee SF.\n\nWe got to the top of the mountain where the swing was. Apparently somebody had just replaced the swing during Christmas and secured some new rope onto the tree, so it was much safer than the prior swing that was there. If you're afraid of heights, it's definitely a little scary pushing off of the ground and swinging into the air. The swing goes out pretty far! My sister and I came primarily to take pictures, but there were several kids who were captivated by the swing and sat there swinging for quite awhile. \n\nWith the green grassy hills, clear cut roads and the blue sky as the backdrop of San Francisco, you'll definitely want to check out Bernal Heights if you're in the area!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Some girl was swinging for a full 30 minutes and a line started to form. \n\nIf you want more of a strenuous walk, you should start at the foot of the hill and walk up. It goes up in circles, as it is a hill. For a more nice, relaxing walk, I just recommend getting dropped off at the top and even then, you'll still have to walk up a steep part.

The fresh air brushing against your face as you take in the 360 degree, sweepingly stunning views of San Francisco is unparalleled. I love that they have benches to plop my hiney on and get lost in the views so I can forget about the BS that life brings.\n\nIn the last 3 months, we've visited Bernal Heights Hill close to 30 times and I have encountered nothing but awesome people here. People smile and actually say, \"hi\". I've even exchanged numbers with a girl so we can meet up for walks. \n\nThe trail from start to end takes about 15 minutes and another 15 minutes back but it takes us 45 minutes...one way because Tater Tot has a Napoleon complex. He feels the need to mark every corner of the 8+ bench posts, not to mention every corner of the 20+ posts in the surrounding area. Argh. \n\nUnlike some dog parks I've been to, furparents here are responsible and clean up after their furbaby drops a deuce or two. No poopy bags though so kindly make sure to bring your own. At the end of the trail, there's a water fountain for human and furbaby. I'm iffy about communal water bowls, so we always bring our own water. \n\nMost furbabies are off leash but I always keep Tater Tot on a leash for safety purposes. I was talking to another furparent and she told me some f*cktard set off fireworks on top of the hill one day, and several dogs took off running and got lost so please be careful!\n\nTater Tot was scared at first but after a few visits, he's now a champion butt sniffer at Bernal Heights Hill: http://bit.ly/1DHoxKe. There's always plenty of furbabies for him to see, smell, and play with. His favs are yorkie sisters: Mochi and Pepper. They always get him feeling some type of way, if you know what I mean. *wink wink*\n\nIf life has you feeling in the dumps, I highly recommend paying a visit to Bernal Heights Hill. It's the best therapeutic medicine you'll find in San Francisco...that's costs nothing at all! Free of debt, free of calories, free of hangovers, and most importantly, free of STDs. Because we all know people make the best decisions after 2 am right?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

This is a great little hike for walking your dog or just to get great views from the top. The hike has a slight incline and it's fairly easy. There's a large paved road that I believe most people take. There's also a little shortcut up some stairs and it's a much steeper climb. I was able to do it while wearing flats. It was super windy at the top, but it was worth it. We went on a clear day and caught 360 views of the city. We could see downtown, the bay bridge, and even the San Mateo bridge! There are also two tree swings at the top of the hill! Parking can be difficult, we parked in a tiny parking lot with only about 5 spots. Otherwise, you'd have to look for street parking.", "author": "Emily L."}

The Muni 311 helpline suggested I get off at Cortland /Bocana but a kindly gentleman residing in the neighborhood was about to get off at the following bus stop and suggested I follow him off. He pointed to Andover, said to take the stairs up to the top, and I will be at Bernal Heights Park. Sounded simple enough and away I went. Ten minutes later, after zig-zagging my way up alongside many pretty residential gardens, I literally arrived at Bernal Heights Park. The sign told me so.\n\nThe time was nearing 5:00pm, on a Sunday. There was a drinking fountain nearby and a sign with the name of the park inscribed on it. Wildflowers were blooming on the hill. Lots of poochies and their humans were coming and going. It looked like I still needed to climb up an incline for views so I went up to as close to the top as I legally could. \n\nThere, I found jaw dropping views of San Francisco! Photos do not quite do the scenery justice. See yelp buddy Edwin R's review for a local's perspective of this \"magical place.\" I was very moved and felt I wasn't ready to head home yet, despite the fact that I would  be leaving the next morning. Despite the many number of two and four legged creatures, the shade of the trees, the gentle breeze, the peacefulness, the beautiful sight of San Francisco below,  made me want to keep lingering. A place of rejuvenation in the middle of a great city.\n\nBut, evening called, and I still had to get down to Mission Street to catch the Muni (bus). Almost a tear and no happy smiles as I slowly found my way down the north side of Bernal Hill.", "author": "Shal W."}

That being said, it does offer absolutely breathtaking views of SF from the South. Twin Peaks is great and all but that's so cliche and hackneyed. Why not go for a real night adventure by driving up to the base of this peak and then taking the 5 minute ascent up? Be careful though since there are a lot of loose rocks and also one of those life-size stone mazes up here. The view of FiDi and Mission/SOMA area are wonderful--when you look at SF like this at night you begin to realize how grid-like the place actually is despite Market just cutting down the diagonal. It's crazy how when you're standing at the top of the mountain you can actually hear almost everything that's going on in SOMA... \n\ntldr; awesome place to go for a light hike to get some beautiful views of SF from a different perspective", "author": "Jasmine X."}

So many great views in every direction, plus it even gave me a chance to see towards the area where Candlestick Park stood(demolition begun on that as I heard back in early 2015, and my visit was spring 2014). You can see miles around, north to downtown, and also east towards the Port of Oakland and across the bay. Also a little artwork and graffiti, when you get to the top and are finished admiring the views all around.\n\nCan't remember how my brother heard about this place, but however he found it, it's just as well he picked it over Twin Peaks.

No no not really poopy, but I mean like....yeah, poopy! *Refer to photos! I ventured on up to Bernal Heights in search for the painted rock. Apparently this rock gets painted every so often (not sure if this is an official thing or if it's random people painting it) but from people walking by it seems like it's been painted a number of times. From christmas trees to other things, and now the swirly smiling poop emoji! Anyway, I was very confused when I tried to climb the rock because it was extremely slippery yet I've seem so many people with their photos on top of this dang thing. I fell off. Completely just slipped right off, rolled into dirt, with everyone watching. WELP what can I say. Fortunately a random stranger stacked some rocks and whatnot and helped me up (TY STRANGER).

Literally and figuratively.\n\nLiterally because of the hike it takes to get to the peak of the hill.  An easy hike There are several ways to get to the top.  I often start on the corner of Precita Ave and Alabama St (Precita Park Cafe) and take Alabama all the way up to enter on the east side.  If you want to enter through the north side of the hill, start at Precita Ave and Folsom St (Hillside Supper Club) and take Folsom top the top.  I recently discovered entering through the west side of the hill via the Esmeralda St. stairs.  From each location it should take about 10 min to get to the bottom of the hill and another 10 min to get to the top.  There are benches on the way to the top if you wish to take a break and soak in the beauty of the city.    \n\nFiguratively becuase the views from the top are absolutely amazing.  You get a 360 degree view of the city which includes most of the landmarks (Bay Bridge, downtown, Coit Tower, TransAmerica Building, Golden Gate Bridge, and Twin Peaks to name a few.  Along with all of the neighborhoods in between).  I must say this is my favorite hill in the entire city.  Not because I live in this neighborhood, but you get a great views of the city without the cold, wind, and crowds you would get from Twin Peaks.  This hill is also easier to get to than having to drive up the windy roads Twin Peaks.  There's plenty of street parking and a small parking lot on the north side of the hill.  I've hiked up the hill during sunrise, sunset, and throughout all of the seasons and each time has been wonderful.  There's also a lot of cute dogs running around which is a big bonus for me.  Near the north east side of the hill you could see a small labyrinth made out of rocks simiilar to the one at the Lands End trail.  The biggest reward is the swing at the top of the hill.  \n\nFind me hiking up this hill at least once a week.  The view from here never gets old.", "author": "Janice C."}

This is the quintessential San Francisco spot to bring family and friends who are visiting. The view here beats Twin Peaks' by a landslide. Why isn't this place more well-known than Twin Peaks?! I guess it's unpopularity keeps the tourists away, which is fine by me. \n\nFrom afar, the summit looks a bit bleak and bland. Due to the drought, the grass hasn't been as green and healthy. However, up close, the hill is quite charming. It's in the perfect location to give you a 360 view of the entire city. You feel closer to the city up here. There isn't really a paved pathway to get up the hill (at least, I didn't see one), so you should wear good shoes when you visit. It's a great spot to take in the scenery, drink some wine and relax.\n\nI have to admit, my initial reason for visiting this summit was for the instagram worthy swing on top of the hill. We had initially visited Billy Goat Hill and the swing there was cut off! I was ecstatic to see that the one here is still in tact. I think the ideal time to visit is during sunset or sunrise, since there isn't much protection from the sun up here. Overall, I freaking love this hill so you should visit!", "author": "Joyce S."}

I almost don't wanna write a review so I can keep it my little secret BUT this kind of beauty needs to be shared! If I ever needed to be reminded of how beautiful SF is, I'll always come here, Twin Peaks, or Battery Spencer. \n\nThis location is fairly easy to navigate to, with pretty easy parking. I can't speak on the other side because I always enter on the same side, but to my knowledge, the parking is just street (read: parallel) parking. I've come here early in the morning and also at night, and I've never had issues finding parking. \n\nThere's a brief walk to get to the top from the parking area. It's really up to you whether or not to go all the way to the top, but after walking ~5 minutes you're more or less surrounded by a 360 view of SF already. There's a single bench if you wanna sit, but I've found crossing over the barrier and sitting on the rocks on the hill work just as well. On a more recent visit, I was surprised to see that there's a swing at the top now! Fair warning, the swing is kiiiiinda high so if you're on the smaller side (5'3\" and below), you might have some trouble getting up on the swing. Not that I tried to get on, fell off, and bled..or anything....but seriously, be careful please lol. Also, not sure if it's seasonal but when I went there were a ton of mosquitoes, so to all my fellow sweet blood homies: PROTECT YA NECK...and arms, and legs too! Just be liberal with that bug spray and I think you'll be okay.  \n\nOverall, it's a pretty solid place to take your dog, get your cardio on, catch the sunrise, or to just take in the beautiful view of SF when Karl the Fog isn't around.

There's a lot of nearby hills/heights/peaks, but I think this one takes the cake. You get a very wide/panoramic view of the city and a great view of downtown and the bay too. With other peaks/hills, there's usually something in the way. Or sometimes, the hill itself is already too near the center of the city, so you miss out of views of the entire city. With Bernal Hill, you can see downtown really well and all the neighborhoods leading up to it (mission, soma, dog patch, etc). \n\nI don't know how many other ways I can say this, but it's just THE BEST VIEW.\n\nOther things to note: This is a dog park, so many people come and bring ALL their dogs. So if you love corgis, goldens, pugs, or any other kind of dog, you'll love this place.\n\nThere's a water fountain near the south entrance of the park. If you're thirsty, or if you have a friend who happens to have her contact fall out of here eye and you need to wash it out so she isn't blind in one eye.\n\nIf you want to actually walk up to the top/summit, there are actual walking trails that aren't super steep that lead you up there. So you don't have to take the makeshift/super steep trails, unless you want to.\n\nTo get to the actual hill can sometimes be tricky, as the roads wind around. But google maps usually helps me. If you're walking, I'd just put it into google maps. If you're driving, I'd just park wherever you feel comfortable (since most spots are parallel parking on a steep incline) and there's no actual parking lot.\n\nPeople are super friendly here and in my experience more than happy to take pictures of you/for you/of themselves.\n\nAlso, it can be windy up here near sunset, so wear extra layers!", "author": "Julie L."}

There are other ways to get up to the base of the park (via Bernal Heights, for example, where about 3 other main roads converge), but Folsom is the most direct from the Mission.\n\nOn a clear day, you can see: Downtown SF, Bay Bridge, the East Bay, Candlestick Point, the planes flying into and out of SFO, parts of the South Bay, Sutro Tower/Twin Peaks, all the nearby local neighborhoods, and the Marin Headlands/Golden Gate bridge. \n\nOn a foggy day it's pretty windy, and on a clear day it can also get windy.

Bernal Park isn't as big as some urban parks I've been accustomed to in Los Angeles but it perfect for San Francisco. From the top you'll get a 360 degree of this world renowned city. The views are spectacular especially on a clear night. It's my go to place to seek serenity and clarity of my mind. The park is frequent by many locals but isn't crowded even during peak hours. Its a great place for a picnic for couples or just to clear your head and enjoy the beauty of this dense city. Parking isn't bad at all and there aren't any steep inclines so its a great place for beginners although its about the size of Will Smith's estate (big but not huge).

The view of the city is truly spectacular! We went when it was dark and I was mesmerized by the glistening building, street, and bridge lights.\n\nGetting to the view was fun, if not a bit treacherous. It seemed as if we took a route through somebody's side yard (my friend insisted that it was part of the park). The path up the hill was steep and laden with loose stones that slipped beneath our feet. It was especially dangerous since nothing in the park was lit and our footing was uncertain.\n\nI was surprised that at the top of the hill was a fenced off area. My friend explained that it was a cell phone tower. How unfortunate that we couldn't summit because of the fence, but could navigate the circumference of the tower.\n\nI noticed a few couples sitting on the incline of the hill along the path. Although I fancy the notion, I also am skeptical considering the vast amount of loose stones. I would worry that at any moment my romantic picnic could transform into a deathly slide.

We used to call it Fog City Mountain, because, well we didn't know it had any other name and our name fit.\n\nEvery summer, before we started heading over to the Boys Club (now the Girls and Boys Club) we would go on these \"Great Expeditions\". Sometimes we would ride our bikes through the hallways of the spooky San Francisco General Hospital, sometimes we would have picnics at Raza Park (Potrero del Sol), other times we would swing on the swings for hours at 24th Mini, but when we wanted to get away from it all and really go on a TRIP - we packed our bags and headed for the HILL!\n\nWith PB&J and our juice boxes in tow we headed across the treacherous Army Street(now Cesar Chavez) overpass and then proceeded to climb the over 100 steps up to Bernal Heights.  From there we ended up taking different routes to get to the base of Bernal Hill.  We would actually hike up the side (we had no clue there was an access road back then).\n\nOnce we reached the top we would sit on the grass and look over our neighborhood and point out our school, our church, our parks, the hospital and we would talk about how many times we would go downtown (we could count them on two hands) on \"Special Occasions\".  It was a truly magical time, when the city felt bigger than it actually was.

I recently went on this hike with my family after looking up the yelp reviews and I was so pleased. It wasn't too long and it wasn't too short, just the perfect length for a nice relaxing hike. We parked our car right on Bernal Heights Blvd after we turned from Bradford St. It was pretty good parking - the only thing was that the entrance to get onto the short hill was a little muddy and slippery because it just rained. We later learned that there was a gravel parking lot a little farther down the road, but that also leads you down the hill a little and I really enjoyed walking up the hill, instead of on a road path. I guess it's upto you, whatever you prefer, but there are multiple options for how you want to hike it up.

A pleasant/easy walk from the Mission, and then a number of ways to get to the park.  I like to walk straight up Folsom from Caesar Chavez to get the ultimate butt blast workout.  You shoot straight up Folsom to the very top, and you'll see the park.  Continuing walking up - definitely not a hike but also not a leisurely walk.  Some loose gravel, dirt....eh, it's not so bad.  Just make sure to wear sneakers (although I will admit I did this once in flipflops and I survived).  There's a cellphone tower up top that's fenced off, but you can see the view from outside the perimeter of the tower.  There's really no need to go to the very top where the tower is.  On the weekends and on nice days, you are guaranteed to find families/couples/friends enjoying the grassy mountain side and lots of DOGS!  My dog loves this park simply because he can go off-leash, play fetch, and make some new doggie friends.  \n\nThe best part is the way down - you can stop at the Bernal Heights Mini Slide Park and then go to Mitchell's after.  \n\nNighttime provides gorgeous views of the city (think Twin Peaks minus all of the cars/tourists).

He is a bit of a nervous dog, and lately has been a tad constipated. We've added olive oil to his food and made sure that he drinks lots of water. And we let him out into our backyard to do his business, but he just can't seem to drop the kids off at the pool, if you know what I mean. So, we brought him up to the hill. Within minutes, Rufus took his first dump in days. I don't know what it is. Maybe the great view of the city relaxed him. Or maybe being around other dogs reminded him that he too could take a dump in the grass. Whatever the reason,  thank you Bernal Heights Hill for being the laxative that Rufus needed. \n\nWarmly, \nCaroline C. and Bill", "author": "Caroline C."}

And it is perched atop one of the best neighborhoods to make it even more of a brilliant force.  Officially this is a dog park and I believe it is one of if not the only park in SF where dogs are allowed off leash.\n\nThere are many angles to come at the hill from to get to the top.  One of the routes leading up from Mission Street takes you up several public staircases that are built into the steep neighborhood streets.  You'll pass by gardens and slides.  \n\nAnother way of reaching the top is to follow Folsom Street up to the base of the hill and then spiral around the mountain until you can't go anymore. \n\nAnd there are a number of paths to the hill cutting over from Cortland Avenue. Some of these routes involve a tiny amount of climbing and evading barking guard dogs.  But all of these roads will bring you to a magnificent view of SF that is usually sitting above the fog even when other parts of the city find themselves covered.\n\nTwo dear friends of mine were just married on Bernal Hill a few weeks ago on a perfectly warm Saturday afternoon.

You see views of other districts that may be neglected by tourists, which include the Mission, Potrero Hill, Noe Valley, and the Bayview. \n\nAside from the views, you will see fabulous looking dogs and their owners. Most of them are on leash and super friendly. You will also see bike riders huffing and puffing but ultimately making it to the top to enjoy the view as well.

It's one of the few off-leash areas left in San Francisco, where dogs can run without having to worry about crashing into a fence or a wall, like in the pitifully small and urine-soaked \"dog runs\" that some other S.F. parks have.  Basically, for dogs, it's pretty close to being heaven on earth -- a mix of paved roads, dirt trails the higher up on the hill you get, and plenty of green for you and your pooch to hang out on, chill, and watch the rest of the world go by.\n\nOn a clear day, you can see Mount Diablo and the Marin Headlands.  There are few things better than being on the hill on a sunny and brisk morning or afternoon, looking at the deep blue of the bay, or watching the fog roll in over Twin Peaks like a blanket, totally above the noise of the city.

I had to stop and walk a bit half way up Folsom Street because that freakin' hill doesn't quit! \n\nI made my way up and up, stopping to look down at the city lights. Once I finally got to the tippy top I was amazed. The city is so beautiful from up here. I sat down next to my bike on the dirt and saw the cargo ships in the bay. They were glowing, their lights reflecting in the water. I thought about when I use to walk the dogs over there by the water. There was this random sitting area all the way down 24th I think. You just go all the way down until you hit the water. You can see a bunch of warehouses that have been decorated with colorful graffiti. I always liked going there even if it is all industrial.\n\nThe moon is full, or almost. I think it's full because my friend KaLai told me that the Moon Cake Festival was today. She says they celebrate it in Hong Kong. Anyways, I sat down and ate some of my ginger candies and stared at the Bay Bridge, downtown, and The Mission. I can see my house! I look back and I can even see the towers in Brisbane. I look to my left and see Twin Peaks. My eye follows the Bay Bridge again and Oakland is twinkling in the distance. The light that the city is giving off is so powerful.....I can see in the dark because of it.\n\nI look up at the sky and I see a shooting star over Pacific Heights. I immediately make a wish......but I think real hard......we'll see if it comes true. My eyes are closed and I can hear the hushed rumbling of the city. That noise never quits....you can always count on that. I open my eyes and count the planes in the sky.....1, 2, 3.......4,5...........6. I know they are planes because I see their lights flying across the bay. I can even hear one of the jet engines.\n\nI'm so happy that I came up here! The temp is perfect......and it's fairly clear out. I walk around to the different hills to get new vantage points. I'm thinking that it would have been nice to share tonight with someone, but I didn't, just me and my city. Things sure have changed a lot ever since I moved up here from SC over 2 1/2 years ago. \n\nI grab my bike and head downward to ride on the access road. I check the message boards for anything interesting. I found a flyer for a \"free market\" in Dolores Park on Saturday @ 1pm. I guess everyone brings something to give away and then you can take whatever you want. Maybe I'll go check it out, it sounds interesting. www.reallyreallyfree.org \n\nRidding downhill in the dark is kinda cool and terrifying all at the same time. This is when I'm thankful that I have brakes on my bike. I'd like to see you fixed gear kids come up here with me and ride downhill. It's a fucking challenge, believe me. Basically I zip down Folsom and take 24th to my flat. \n\nI just got home and wanted to share this with you guys. Let me know if anyone ever wants to come back up here, especially at night.

Interesting vibe with plenty of yuppie couples jogging and doing sit-ups around the top of the hill, with their requisite doodle doggies wagging and sniffing nearby. Not so much a running/frolicking/grassy kind of dog place (so probably would not be our regular dog park), but good for a relatively short, steep, ambling hiking outing together. This is loose red rock on an exposed trail, so it is for somewhat fit people with good knees and shoes with a grip would be helpful. I would not try this on a wet day; it could be muddy and slippery. On the day we went, it was a tad warm and sunny at the top of the hill but there is a cooler area at the base where there is a water fountain with bowls and happy dog socializing. The natural barrier of the hill/trails keeps the dogs safely away from the streets which makes this a 4++ park. Not to mention the exceedingly cutesy Cortland Avenue a few blocks away which has to be the single most dog-friendly village in the U.S.A. There are more dogs than people and the shops (gym, cafes, boutiques) advertise the services they offer for the DOGS. There are poop bag dispensers at the street corners. The dogs actually do outnumber the people. It is like the community exists to entertain and pamper the dogs.
