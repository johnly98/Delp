Since we were looking for a place to sit down and drink some coffee, we decided to try here. \n\nI was first surprised and confused at the four different coffee dispensers at the area, where there are sugar and creams, and I later realized why. I ordered the cafe au lait and when the received my order, it was a cup filled with foamy milk. I probably looked dumbfounded because the cashier gestured and told me to pour coffee from the coffee dispensers. \n\nThere were four different types (one being decaf), and I selected the darkest roast. \n\nThe coffee was SO GOOD! My favorite type of coffee is the taste where it has no sour and bitter notes. The french roast didn't include any of these, and after I took a sip, it left a lingering toasty aftertaste. Even my relative, who can't drink coffee because they don't like the bitter taste, was able to drink a share. \nI was even tempted to purchase a bag of coffee beans, but that will be for the next visit.", "author": "Mito I."}

There's not as much seating in the morning, but after around 12pm there are more open tables. Good coffee, they have a lot of different roasts you can buy. The drinks also seem a little bit cheaper (cold brew was only $2.50). They have a ton of tea options too. Service is SUPER quick, i always get my drinks immediately. The space inside is a little cramped, the tables are kind of close to each other. The only downside is that there are no outlets to plug in anything, but there's free wifi!

And any time you see people working and enjoying at the same time you got to take that as a sign of a well-run place. \n\nStar # 5- Coffee; what really matters.

They have the only honey jars I've ever seen someone use without making a mess, coffee screens that go under your lid to prevent spills (they work so well), long spoons for mixing, and a few spices among other things.

Let me tell YOU why!\n\nThere coffee doesn't taste generic or stale or processed. It just tastes damn good! Like it should. I'm not a drip coffee guy I like my espresso. I need my caffeine early to even function. Its tasty, never burned. Just right! and ZING! I'm ready to go!\n\nThe fellas who usually hold down the AM shift are quick! After a few visits they knew my order. The speed is very important for me in the morning. I never waited more then 3 or 4 minutes for my espresso. WAY faster then the chain near by. Or any chain for that matter. They rock that am shift better then most places I have gone.\n\nThe ladies who hold it down in the afternoon and evening are a treat! They are funny, raw, \"tell you how it is\" people. The world needs more of that. I almost feel as thought they are like many bartenders I know and like. Strong opinions, like it or not attitude about life, not their service. They care about the coffee they make and have re-made mine when it didn't come out to their liking. I was cool with it, they weren't. There is also a few more people who staff the afternoons who are just as fabulous! Easy to talk to and make great drinks!\n\nThey get complaints on the norm about no wifi and no pedicure service. They are happy to remind you, this is a coffee shop, not a hang out and study for the day shop. Buy coffee sit if you want, but then go. No plush seats or free wifi. Simple coffee service. I feel for them as I get ridiculous requests all the time. \n\nBut they are super nice. great hospitality. Always smiling even on bad days. leave you with a smile and a light laugh. I enjoy getting a latte or mocha at the end of my work day to carry me through the night to be productive rather then pass out exhausted. They are open til 7 and that makes this caffeine junkie happy.\n\nFor a no thrills, great tasting, local coffee joint come here. They make good coffee and get you on your way. What else do you want? Oh more? go to the chains then. This place isn't for you. Besides the last thing I want when enjoying my coffee is to watch you play farmville, facebook and hear your annoying music from your over played ipod headphones. \n\nThere are many places, but a block or so away, that charge DOUBLE what they charge. Ridiculous!", "author": "Benjamin W."}

The beautiful Sunday weather reinforced our good moods, and we were all smiles as we entered. However, when my friend cheerfully inquired at the counter about outlets for our laptops, the girl behind the counter killed the mood and actually sneered \"um, no, we're not *that* kind of place.\" Understandably, many businesses will subtly discourage workforce and student camping at their establishments by simply not providing outlets or wifi, but never in my life has anyone outwardly attempted to make me feel less-than for being one of *those* people until now.\n\nDear Beanery Barista,\n\nA simple \"sorry guys, no outlets!\" would have sufficed, but your rude, dismissive commentary was extra special. It's not often I have my parade shat upon by a stranger, but you nailed it. I left feeling rejected and angry, and ultimately undeserving of good customer service. \n\nThe only plus side of this experience was a big one: The discovery of the bright, sunny, and EXTREMELY CHEERY Dash Cafe around the corner. They proudly and CHEERFULLY serve Blue Bottle coffee, and the service, environment, and camp-out-ability are impeccable. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone, and will absolutely come here again.\n\nThe Beanery, however, can suck it.", "author": "bex m."}

I go here because it's a neighborhood place, but if you're looking for 3rd/4th wave coffee, you'll be disappointed.\n\nI think Dash around the corner has better coffee and is a bit more cozy.\n\nFor what it's worth, I own a roasting company and a few cafes in Oregon.

I travel five days a week to the Inner Sunset from the Mission, and as soon as I step off the train, I breathe a sigh of relief and my heart just sings - it's like going back 20 years to the San Francisco I once loved so well - a neighborhood full of wonderful, unique, affordable mom-and-pop businesses! This coffee spot is definitely one of those - it has quickly become a favorite habit. There's absolutely nothing that the expensive, trendy Mission coffee places have that this place doesn't have (yes, they even roast their own beans). The biggest difference is, Beanery doesn't have a need to make a big production about what they do - they just do it humbly and simply without any Internet infomercials - they roast their beans and they do it well but they don't need to tweet about it, post it to the latest site or what-have-you. Their focus is on real life - knowing all their customers by name, saying hello to the neighborhood folk. The coffee is delicious too, by the way - and they have a wonderful assortment of treats, even healthy ones, to go along with it. When you're done with your coffee, you should wander half a block down the street to some of the other treasured destinations the Inner Sunset has to offer - Le Video, Green Apple Books - and one of the last 'professional' magic shops left in the world. I'm having a ball in this charming neighborhood and it's because it puts people first, not fame and profit. Thank you, Beanery, for being so kind.", "author": "Heidi-Jane S."}

Sometimes I feel like having a cup of hot tea. In that case, there are many varieties of tea bags to choose from. Pastries and bagels are definitely fresh and super yummy from Semifreddi's and House of Bagels.They either sell them at a discounted price ($1/pastry) towards the end of the day or give them out to homeless (that was what I was told).\n\nWhat I am always amaze is how they manage to remember the drinks the customers order especially when there are 3 to 4 cups lined up to be filled. Either way, they've only messed up my drinks about twice since I did not clarify whether I wanted a mocha or a latte. But so far, no mistakes! Just recently as a suggestion from a previous yelper, I decided to try a caramel soy latte and let me tell you this: \n\n\"OMG...so smooth with the right amount of caramel.

You could buy prepackaged bagels, sandwiches, cartons of milk, cookies, etc.\n\nThe food was horrible. It was the beanery or the cafeteria - and the cafeteria was worse than prison food.\n\nThe beanery was disgusto. Dirrrty like when Xtina Aguilera did her music video. High school kids went there, pushed each other around - they'd make fun of the special ed kids. Some couples would be making out in the corner and doing godknowswhat.  Some kids genuinely wanted to get some food and would have their money in hand - only to have some gangster wannabe snatch it out of their hands and bolt out of the beanery.  It was chaotic.  It was sad. Yes, I am one of the many deformed and dysfunctional products of a public school system. \n\nSo when I saw the Beanery on Irving this past Saturday, my heart skipped several beats. Memories of the beanery in high school started to flood my mind. I did not want to go in. However, I really needed that coffee and I knew Starbucks was not going to do it.

I tried to use my Spanish and they laughed and talked to me in English. I ordered a single latte ($2.60) which came out strong. Just the way I like it. I will definitely come back here again.

We talked for about two hours and I left feeling like I could definitely share the space with her. Well, she called the next day and told me she had decided to keep the place to herself for now but she really liked me and would like to hang out sometime.\nSo we made a date to rendezvous at The Beanery for coffee this morning at 10. I got here 20 minutes early and decided to get a house coffee. I began with the Organic French Roast. Exquisite in its rich, full-bodied darkness. I nursed my cup for about 30 minutes, looking up often to see if E. had come in. I then bought the Sumatran blend and was equally impressed but getting jittery now. Had I ben stood up? Was she okay? I had her number and called, leaving a message and she called me back. She was at THE Beanery and I was merely at  \nBeanery..two blocks apart. So I gulped the rest of my coffee and trotted down to the other cafe where we finally met up. Interesting about this Beanery, they roast their coffee once a week here and the other roasting is done in their Oakland shop. Prices are good and coffee strong!", "author": "michael s."}

I remembered this place and always see loads of people getting coffee here. \n\nI plopped myself on the 71 and took the bus over to the Inner Sunset.  I had my book in hand as I walked in and saw maybe 8 tables or so all filled, except 2.  Grrr.  Plus there was a line of people to get their fix.\n\nI'm poor till payday on Friday, so I decided to just get a tea as I had like 4 bucks on me and figured I might want a snack.  Seriously, I had 2 dollars and 2 dollars in change.  It's sad.\n\nAnyway, I got up to the counter and ordered my tea.  The woman gave me a cup of hot water and I saw they had a fairly large selection of teas to choose from.  Nice!!  And to my luck, a couple had left a table just for me to grab in time before anyone else.  \n\nI sat and read for a bit while my hot tea cooled down.  I started to eye a bagel with jam (mmm) and went to order.  I sat back down and got back to my reading when I realized after maybe 5-7 minutes that I didn't have my bagel.  Does it take that long to toast and slap jam on it??  I went to the counter and it was a bit awkward as the 2 people who might be the owners (??) seemed to be having a bit of a dispute.  The woman signaled to the guy that I was standing at the counter.  I told the guy I ordered a bagel with jam and he immediately apologized for not getting it to me sooner.  I was glad though my bagel was still warm with that yummy strawberry jam on it.\n\nI read for another hour or so.  People seemed to arrive in waves.  The seating was pretty full until around 5ish as I'm sure people were heading home or out to have dinner.  The guy who was there behind the counter seemed friendlier than the woman.  She did pick up my plate from my table which was nice, I thought.  Two other guys took over after a while and they seemed super friendly to one customer who I imagine is a regular.\n\nIt's a nice place to hang out and read or work for a while.

I like having it on my doorstep because there's never anywhere to sit. \n\nThe place is jammed with addicted regulars until well past noon, so when I don't feel like elbowing myself a space in the middle of the klatsch of gabby gray-haired bear/queens that rules the roost in the mid-morning, I can just slip back to my own couch and nurse my buzz in private. Visitors from other parts of the city may find the logistics of the place more of an obstacle, but when that French Roast hits your pleasure centers, trust me, it'll feel worth it.\n\nI stick with the drip coffee, and when it's as fresh and rich as this, it's as good as any espresso. The cafe's roaster takes up much of the space that might otherwise be devoted to seating, and most days you can watch the hot Persian roast and grind what you'll be drinking later.\n\nPastries are decent, but you can get better round the corner at Tart to Tart or up the block at Arizmendi. I love the baristas for the long-simmering dramas I've watched mature among them over the years, and as they do nothing more for me than hand me a cup, I am untroubled by any efficiency problems they may have.

The guy at the counter was very nice in telling me this, however, and a five spot in my pocket saved the day. My latte was very rich, and the chocolate croissant had a high chocolate-to-pastry ratio (a rare occurrence), usually I have to eat the croissant carefully so that I don't finish the chocolate and end up with half of the pastry left and no desire to eat it.

This is the only place I can drink black coffee\n\nb) The employees are super nice and they recognize me.  When the line is long and I'm at the rear (I know that sounds dirty but I swear it's not) they hand me my large coffee and I hand them direct change.  This really helps save time when I'm trying to catch the next train\n\n3) ICED CAFE MOCHA!!! Holy crap!  This is a piece of art.  I'm not sure if its the coffee or the chocolate that makes this do damn delicious,  but I'm in love with this drink. \n\n4) Outdoor Seating, they've got it.  When I wake up on a sunny morning, I love to sit outside, drink my coffee, read and people watch.  It's right across the street from the N-Judah, so there are some (interesting) people walking around. The only minus is the outdoor chairs.  These things are so damn uncomfortable. Perhaps that's their way of getting people to rotate through the 6 chairs.\n\nThe coffee here is delicious, but not necessarily consistent.

It took me a long time, but I've finally done it and I mean to stick with it. \nSo yesterday, when I was at the corner of 9th and Irving and deliberately ignoring the starbucks over there, I sauntered up to Beanery. I ordered an iced decaf soy mocha (iced because it was hot outside, decaf because I'm breasfeeding and soy because I hate cows). The place smelled amazing and when I mentioned that to the woman behind the counter, she didn't say ANYTHING. In fact, I don't think she said anything to me period. The customer service (if it could be called that) was a big turn-off.\nBut...I can't help but give the place four stars anyway because it was definitely one of the best iced mochas I've ever tasted (seriously only one mocha was better - at a place in Mill Valley). I could taste how fresh the espresso was and for my taste it was the perfect blend of chocolate sweetness and espresso. It was also frothy and didn't contain 90% ice - unlike starbucks. When I pay $4 for a drink, I want it to be mostly drink, not mostly ice. Incidentally - even with soy, the price for a 20oz iced mocha was less than what I'd pay for a grande mocha at Starbucks and Beanery sells my favorite vegan cookies from Alternative Baking Co. (YAY Lemon Poppyseed!)\nYou can definitely tell the difference between a cup of coffee made with beans roasted on site. It's hard to go back once you've tasted it. \n\nI'll be coming back to this place every time I'm in the area but I'm sad that the people behind the counter aren't more friendly.\n\n***edit****I forgot to mention one huge bonus about this place. Unlike the Sbux on 19th and Irving (closest to my home) and less frequently, the one at 9th and Irving, my 14 month old daughter (in her stroller, with me) was not accosted by putrid smelling individuals trying to talk to her, get her to smile, give five, wave hello, etc. Somehow people have lost the ability to discern when it is definitely NOT ok to touch somebody else's baby. When you smell like urine and there are giant hairs growing out of the giant moles on your chin and your teeth look like they haven't seen a toothbrush in 2 years, this is NOT the right time to (even try to) touch random stranger's offspring. \nTranslation: Beanery has more polite and clean patrons. For that alone, I'll keep coming back. Hopefully without a stroller soon.", "author": "Laura G."}

He has to deal with a Starbucks within view, but he has loyal customers like me that swear six ways from Sunday that his goods are far superior.", "author": "Patrick L."}

I always have my single lattes with a bit of honey and some cocoa powder and I'm good to go. And if you get there at the right time, you'll catch the owner roasting the coffee beans with that beautiful antique roaster on site.", "author": "Jen L."}

The people are friendly, the coffee rocks, and the cafe is small and cozy.  The only downside is that it's often hard to find an empty seat.", "author": "Stefani D."}

There is usually this guy who sits outside for hours with a parrot or something on his shoulder. So strange. Lots of bearded, philosophy major clientele, it appears.

You can almost always get a table, and the people seem good natured and friendly. I got a carrot muffin this morning that was good, the french roast coffee was most excellent, and the fact that a refill was just 50 cents was totally tubular. Better than the 'bucks, people.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

Super good lattes with very friendly service and the prices are reasonable especially for the quality of the coffees you are drinking. The staff are owner with offer you a warm smile. It's a place you can feel relaxed and comfortable in. And I don't think they mind you sneaking in pastries from Arizmendi Bakery right up the street. Just order a large coffee and be kind with a tip.\n\nUntil they prove otherwise they get five stars.", "author": "Steven P."}

The staff are always really friendly and have gotten used to my orders and usually finish my sentences. The only minor thing that would make this place better is big comfy sofas/chairs inside... but otherwise usually a lot of seating inside and outside. Great place to people watch right at the heart of the inner sunset.", "author": "Billie S."}

I usually go for the Soy Latte.  The beans are fresh and roasty, and they even finish off the foam on top with an artistic touch.  You can feel the love compared to the baristas at Sbux who tend to move like molasses and pour watered down beverages.", "author": "Brandon C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-29", "description": "This is a really good place to get a good cup of coffee and they know how to make a great latte.  I buy my beans here, I love the Columbian and the Viennese, and you can get organic fair trade beans as well.  They also roast their beans in the shop, very cool roasting machine. You can get a card for frequent buyers and after you buy 10 lbs., you get one free. Great deal if you can keep track of your card.  The employees are great, but the owner can be a bit uptight. I think he drinks too much coffee. I definitely recommend for the coffee, but go up the street to Arizmendi for a treat.", "author": "Sabrina L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-03", "description": "This is my first review, so bear with me.\n\nThe first star is because the lattes here are great, the milk is smooth and creamy, naturally sweet. Which is how a latte is supposed to be, not an overly bubbly mess of hot milk.\n\nThe second star is because it is a locally owned business, though the guy that seems to be in charge gets a little tense. But again, it is a locally owned business, and they roast their own beans!\n\nThe third star is because the prices are so reasonable. Many other places charge more for a lesser quality cup 'o joe, and about three bucks for a double latte is more than fair!\n\nThe fourth star is because the people that work here seem to really know and care about coffee. or at least know what makes each drink what it is, and do it correctly. \n\nThey WOULD get a fifth star for their female barista, because she's hot and funny, and I like her tattoos. But that has nothing to do with coffee.", "author": "Mitsy P."}

Not only is the coffee delicious (I especially recommend the iced coffee), but the staff is friendly and extremely attentive.  After frequenting the shop only a few times, I was already seen as a regular, with my order ready by the time I get up to the counter.  The prices are also extremely reasonable, with a large iced ringing up at a respectable $1.85.  Some slight downsides include cash only and some cramped seating, but neither of these are able to outweigh the great cup 'o joe!", "author": "Liz Y."}
