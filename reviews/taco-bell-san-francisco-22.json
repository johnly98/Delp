I have still yet to take advantage of the alcoholic beverages on the menu, but my friends have ordered beer and thought it was a good value. The food was good too! I always order the same 3 things, but I liked that they had unique menu items here, and shareable platters. Even when the restaurant is busy your food comes out pretty quickly and you can watch them make it if you'd like as there is a glass window in front of their stations.\n\nThe restaurant is located near AT&T Park, so it's downtown and on your way to the Pier (if that's where you're heading). I was disappointed that it wasn't larger - taking advantage of its location and potentially being 'a place to go' before a baseball game or event. I really think they could be bigger if they themselves were bigger spatially. They have a few bathrooms that require a code and they were clean enough.", "author": "Bri T."}

This is one of the busiest taco bells I've ever visited. It's one of those \"Taco Bell Cantinas\" so the interior is a bit more upscale than a typical Taco Bell. \n\nHowever, it gets super crowded during lunch from all the customers who work nearby. As a result, the inside is really messy and unkempt. The kitchen area where they assemble the food is a complete mess with lettuce and taco seasoning everywhere. The sauce packet area is usually empty and the floors are littered with food/trash.\n\nTry to avoid, or at least don't come during lunch.", "author": "Michelle T."}

I've been eating it religiously since I was a kid, so this was super exciting: my first time at a Taco Bell Cantina! It felt like Christmas had come early, but sadly, it was underwhelming. Maybe that's why they serve alcohol... to make you think otherwise.\n\nNot many tables and decently crowded at 9 pm. The kitchen is on display behind glass (Idk how much an open kitchen is really doing for this place). There's a screen showing who's waiting/completed orders; I noticed a lot of Postmates. It did feel a little grimey, combined with some sketchy characters. \n\nReally, the only issue is just that THIS TACO BELL IS SO SLOW. There's a Taco Bell right next to my house I frequently go to. The max amount of time I usually wait for my order is like five minutes. Now, I realize that this location may be more high traffic, but it's still crazy to wait 20 minutes for my single order of nachos to come out (this is fast food, y'all). They also messed up my friend's order (two mini chicken quesadillas) -- gave her beef instead of chicken. So she had to wait another crazy period of time for them to fix it. Other friend's spicy tostada looked like someone chewed it up first, so presentation wasn't great.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, I enjoyed how my nachos tasted: up to par with typical Taco Bell quality. I'd probably only come back to try the experience of having alcohol at a Taco Bell. Oh, and they offer free WiFi, so it's definitely a great study spot ;)", "author": "Anthony T."}

Except for maybe the guy who does the final wrapping and calls up our order number. But there was a middle line guy and he just moved things from one side to the other. He took his sweet time putting lettuce in the taco. Then cheese.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-07-01", "description": "This Taco Bell Cantina location is extremely inconsistent, which is why I am giving 2 stars. Ever since it opened, I visit this location at least 3 times a month for my almost weekly fix. \n\nBecause le bf and I live so close, we normally order via the app and as soon as we place our order, le bf charges out the door so that he can ensure he gets me my tacos before the shell of my crunchy tacos gets all soft and gross. That normally ensures that we don't have to wait in line for our order. And I can attest to some of the reviews where they say the cashier is slow or the line is super long. By ordering via the app, you can skip all of that.\n\nWe get our orders usually to go. But if you dine in, be warned. Because of the location and the high foot traffic, you might sit next to some pretty shady characters and/or sit at tables that are still left dirty from the previous occupant. And because this Taco Bell seems to always be short staffed, you will have to bust your own table, if there are napkins in the dispensers. If there aren't any napkins/plastic utensils/straws/lids, good luck getting the attention of the staff behind the counter. \n\nWhen you get your order, you will want to double check that you have everything that you ordered. There are many times when they forgot to put in the chips and cheese that I ordered. And the portions can also vary widely visit to visit. For example, something I get a mini bag of chips and cheese. Other times, I get like a paper bag that is half filled with chips and then a container of cheese. \n\nBeing a Taco Bell Cantina location, and I guess being in SF in general, this location is definitely pricer than other Taco Bell locations. So if something you order normally costs $2.50. Expect it to cost $3+ at this location. \n\nIn general, there are a lot of things that can be improved about this location (food, customer service, consistency, cleanliness). I think that staffing this Taco Bell with more people will go a long way in improving the customer experience at this location. Sadly, I will have to put up with everything at this location because it is just so close to my place and I love getting my almost weekly fix of Taco Bell. However, after lots of trial and error, I have learned how to work around most problems at this location.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

Taco bell here release the nacho fries a few months back and then took it away but right now it's back for limited time only again. I really hope they decide to keep it. It's seasoned well and the nacho sauce is yummy to dunk in. Besides the food, this location is near the AT&T Ball park so on game days you can be in a long line to order.

While the majority of the staff is friendly, there is a real lack of professionalism going on here. One young lady was walking behind the counter and flipping off one of her coworkers. Both middle fingers held high. Guess she needed the extra emphasis.\n\n2.) No napkins. I asked. Not a single napkin in the entire restaurant. Seriously? Who's in charge of asset management? Better question, especially after the double finger flip, _IS_ there an actual management staff at this location?\n\n3.) No change. Yeah,change was due but the register was out. No problem. Run to the back and get what you need. When I asked about my change, I was told, \"I owe you about a dollar.\" About a dollar? Math skills not required to work here I guess. I was given a dollar. I didn't check. Didn't care at this point.\n\n4.) There is trash everywhere. I know it's Taco Bell, but come on, bust some tables and empty the overflowing trash bins.\n\n5.) Napkins aren't the only thing not fully stocked. Forks and knives, etc. \n\n6.) I've been to this location several times.

Not a huge deal, but the staff definitely did not handle with tact. \n\nI believe I came in as soon as this happened. (There was already a hand-written sign stating most of the produce was out of stock). I did not overhear the full conversation between the person ahead of me in line..just the employee saying something along the lines of: 'I'm going on my break, sorry'. That cashier then proceeded to make their own food and go elsewhere. So did another employee.  The counter was left unattended for about 5mins while the staff making existing orders kept at it (good on them for not leaving other customers SOL). \n\nSomeone eventually came around to tell us 'our computers aren't working and we can't make food'. No ETA on a fix or further explanation. The person at the front of the line asked for drinks on the house (good call--and that said, why were you out of freezes [again] and s/m sized cups? What's up with the inventory at this heavy-traffic area next to the stadium?). Really disappointing, even if it's silly to say for fast food. \n\nI had cash, and the food on the line was only going to get old as time went on. Sure, business wasn't crazy at the moment... But imagine if it had been. Folks might have caused a big scene, especially for those of us who often think outside the bun. (Represent). \n\nThis experience was a let down. No cervesa...

Nothing will replace the 20 piece McNugget hole in my heart, but the naked chicken chalupa comes close. \n\nI have many fond memories of eating baja steak and chicken chalupas during lunch in high school. Taco Bell has upped the ante with the naked chicken chalupa and replaced the entire tortilla shell with a flattened piece of fried chicken at the same price point as a normal chalupa. Wow! Get them while they're still available. Taco Bell is also offering a drink, chips, taco, Doritos taco, and naked chicken chalupa meal for around $6. \n\nOverall, prices are reasonable and the food tastes like what you expect. Salty, savory goodness. Drizzle some diablo hot sauce on top and you're good to go. As far as I can tell, the menu is exactly the same as a normal Taco Bell. The decor brings the venue up to the feel of a trendier SF restaurant and I have to say it's not bad. Better than the vibe at the Carl's Jr. / Green Burrito on Market for example. \n\nMy most recent trip was for lunch on Sunday, no line at all.

This is not a place you'd want to go if you're pressed for time.  I ordered my food online and arrived 15 minutes later.  I walked in and the line was nearly out the door because the cashier had to help make the food. I waited an additional 10 minutes for my food and not one person had ordered at the register.

I returned and was ecstatic to see 4 people behind the counter, which leads me to this updated review. I ordered and checked in online.  I figured they'd be busy so I showed up nearly 30 minutes after I ordered.  I arrive there and they told me that I now had to check in at the register.

No, instead you ignore the line and don't say one word. 2 people leave during the almost 10 minutes I patiently stood in line. At one point I walk over to the glass and ask the girl if anyone was going to take our orders. Instead of the typical customer service response, I get a glare. I brush it off because this girl usually has an attitude, but still, what I asked wasn't some ridiculous request.\n\nAfter waiting for a few more minutes, the same girl finally comes over to the register and I think i'm going to finally be able to order and rush back to the office. NAWL. Instead with the thickest attitude she was able to muster and says \"I'm not taking any orders for 15-20 minutes. You're gonna have to come back later!!\".\n\nUhhh..ok. I'm not going to argue with her about what she is and isn't going to do. Though telling people you won't be taking orders for 15-20 mins when the lunch rush is about to start is RIDICULOUS. What I take issue with most out of this whole situation is that no one even acknowledged the line for 10 whole minutes and when they did, it was slathered in attitude. If you indeed won't be performing a basic function of your job, communicate that to the customers in line w/o a verbalized eye roll ASAP.

I had to try it, so I went in at 8pm in the middle of a baseball game, a few days after opening.  Kind of like the eye of the hurricane for a restaurant a block from AT&T Park.\n\nOverall impression: nice environment.  Normal to slightly-improved Taco Bell food, at least right now (a regular Taco Bell near my house was great for a month after re-opening, too, but then backslid.).  Nothing really unexpected (apparently a liquor license is coming, with bottled beer at least), but pretty good.\n\nI got take-out chicken tenders (same as anywhere), steak soft taco supreme (the tortillas tasted a bit different ... maybe more dry?  fresher?  and the steak was particularly good looking), and a steak quesadilla (also fine).  The store itself is nice -- wood, brick, etc.  Take-out, though, because in SF and especially SoMA, even nice places end up filled with homeless people.  (Was fun seeing 6 Yum! execs standing in the doorway after what appeared to be a homeless person was kicked out.  Check out the McDonald's across the street for what this place will be like in a month or two...)\n\nI'd still prefer a Chipotle based on menu (burrito bowl...), but otherwise, this was fine.

Cantina is none of these compared to other Taco Bells.\n\n1. Slow: It takes a long time to get a small order, even with no other customers around. I do not understand how a staff of three can take 6-8 min for a small two-item order, when other Taco Bells with two sleepy workers can have 3 meals ready for you at 2AM in the same amount of time via drive-thru window. If freshly prepared ingredients made a difference, I'd understand. But the taste and diarrhea is just the same as any other Taco Bell.\n\n2. Overpriced. I get it, Cantina is in a prime location, wages are high, etc...\n\nBut $16.00 for a 12-Pack of tacos? $18.00 with tax? with a 10 min wait on top of that?\n\n That's a hell of a markup! I'd understand if I at least get the same kind of tacos as I do at other franchises, but I don't, which leads to my last point...\n\n3. Skimpy. Normally, 3-4 Soft Tacos would get me full. Not from here. It takes me about 5-6 Soft Tacos from here to get full. It does not make sense to me how I can go to Chipotle and feel full of meat, rice, and salsa for a slightly less cost than it does to buy food here to feel full of starches. \n\nI want to give this place more stars, I really do...and I know rent and labor is expensive in the city, particularly near AT&T Park...\n\n But if you can't be a cheap Taco Bell, the workers should at least hustle up instead of taking their sweet time, and give the same proportions as the other franchises...not less...\n\nAll in all, a general disappointment, but nothing that cannot be improved on.

Besides the regular menu options, they also have \"shareable\" items which really intrigued my friend and I when we stopped by on our trip to SF. We ended up sharing the quesadilla nachos (I think that's the name... in the shareable section) and it came out beautifully.

Simple: Much more care is being put into all aspects of the experience, from the food and atmosphere to the service (not a word typically associated with fast food locations).\n\nThe food is prepared much more carefully. Every menu item is pretty much hitting its Platonic ideal. For example, the shell part of a Mexican Pizza has a crunchy, flaky texture. Everything is heated evenly. The service is great, with smiling staff that will offer to clear your table.\n\nThere's really not much more you can ask for from a Taco Bell.\n\nThat being said, there are a few ways it could be improved:\n* Seating seems too limited for peak hours. I haven't seen them set up the outdoor seating recently; this might be the infamous Beacon HOA causing trouble.\n* The packaging used in this restaurant is non-standard. They use these compostable-looking bowls, but the shapes seem kind of wrong. Anything that's roughly square or circular (Mexican Pizzas, Crunchwraps) doesn't really fit right.\n* The differences in food preparation aren't always perfect. The shell of the Doritos Locos Tacos are perhaps *too* crunchy--every single one I've eaten has fallen to pieces halfway through.\n* The tabletops could be better. They're going for an industrial look with brick and timber, but they're using plywood tables where you would typically see walnut or steel.", "author": "Michael C."}

It looks like a hip, fancy taqueria, but the menu is really just like a regular Taco Bell. I had a $2 burrito and enjoyed the NBA game showing on the flat screen TVs. This is a hidden gem in a neighborhood where $10 sandwiches is the norm.", "author": "Fai C."}

Slushy drinks are available now but they are still working on their liquor license. Employees say it'll be about another month. Can't wait! There's also a mobile ordering window that will come in handy later. Nice, more affordable addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "Nina L."}

Looks very nice inside, and the staff was all very friendly, however it's only day two, so hopefully it can stay that way.", "author": "Andy H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-07", "description": "Don't be fooled - this is just a regular Taco Bell with the same old menu, but enhanced with a big screen TV and some other minor upgrades that purportedly make it a \"cantina.\"  Want to have delusions of grandeur while eating unhealthy food?  Then come to this place!\n\nIt gets 3 stars instead of 2 only because I happen to like Taco Bell generally.  The people who have given it 5 stars are either ringers or need to do a serious examination of their lives.  Some of their comments are embarrassing.  Have you never seen a Taco Bell before?\n\n(One good thing to come out of this charade is that it might force the McDonald's across the street, which is among the dingiest in the country, to clean up its act.)", "author": "Bret L."}
