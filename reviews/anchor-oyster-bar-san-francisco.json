Still amazing combination salad, still oysters that taste like the ocean, and still comforting chowder. I particularly liked the thick gigantic steamboat oysters. \n\nI think the closest thing (as to how the seafood is prepared) is Swan Depot but they aren't as cute/romantic as Anchor - and they don't take cards. \n\nWill be back again but hopefully at a less busy time ;)", "author": "Iris H."}

Boston clam chowder had NO CLAMS in it. \n\n2. Bread they served was not that good. The butter was a brick of ICE. \n\n3. Scallops were served with TONS of aioli. That's it. It didn't complement the scallops and was a poorly executed dish. Scallops do not need aioli. \n\n4. Waitress presented the oysters without any explanation of where they were from. This is the FIRST time I've ever been served oysters without explanation. \n\n5. Sake Oyster shooters were not good.

As a long-time San Franciscan, I've always been on the hunt for the best bowl of Cioppino and I think I've finally found it.  \n\nI was going to be in the area anyway and had some time to kill around lunch time.  This place is on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list so I decided to put my name on the waitlist and was promptly seated at the counter.  I ordered the \"smaller\" cioppino (it's enough for two) and was quickly intimidated by the massive mound of shellfish in a huge bowl. I was just blown away by the depth of flavor and all the fresh seafood in this dish (crab, shrimp, fish, mussels and clams).  I thought about eating half and taking half home but once I started eating, I couldn't stop myself. IT WAS THAT GOOD!!!  The garlic bread was great too. I will definitely be coming here again with some friends so we can try the other items on the menu. \n\nQuick notes - pack your patience because there's a wait to be seated and the Cioppino looks like it's made to order (about 30 minute wait). Say no to the bread and yes to the bib.  Also, bring a friend so you can enjoy the oyster plates (comes out a lot faster) while waiting for the Cioppino.  Including tax and tip, the \"Smaller\" Cioppino comes out to be around $50 but it's easily enough for two people.", "author": "Andrew S."}

Walking into the restaurant has always felt like I was returning home. So when I came back to San Francisco after being out of town for three months, I stepped in to say, \"Hi\" and check bar availability. I was a party of one and it looked like a spot might be open at the end of the bar. A new waitperson, \"greeted\" me by angrily shouting at me to \"Go back outside and sign in! There are other people in front of you!\"\n\nI had checked the board for parties of one, and checked with each of the  four people waiting outside before I had entered the restaurant. Even so, that is not how a customer should be greeted.

The food, however, is really delicious and impressed my boyfriend and me a lot.\n\nSo for the whole waiting thing... you're supposed to write your name, party size, and time on their whiteboard that's hanging outside by the front day, and apparently you do NOT need to be present when they call your name. Your name will not be erased, and will be called again when a table is available. However, they have a sign that says that you need to be present, so many customers would actually wait instead of running off to somewhere else and coming back later. My boyfriend and I thought that if we went off and were not there when his name was called, they would erase our names and obviously give the table to someone else. Anyway, turns out they do not erase your name and they keep calling you when a table is cleared. This is so annoying, and frankly, quite unfair. What makes it worse is that the place itself is TINY. There's only 5-6 tables maximum, with only 1 seated for 2 people. The rest are all for 4-5 people. Yes, there is bar seating too, but it only seats approximately 6 people, and they actually took away 2 seats from the bar to accommodate a larger party. Frustrating, much?\n\nThe food, however, is REALLY good. I was getting so cranky from waiting for 1.2 hours outside that I almost didn't want to eat there anymore. We had 3 kinds of oysters, the risotto cake with roasted shrimp, and the cioppino. \nOysters: all were chucked nicely, tasted fresh, and all had great flavors and textures. (5/5)\nRisotto cake with roasted shrimp special: all the ingredients complimented each other beautifully. Shrimp were plump and roasted nicely (4.8/5)\nCioppino: comes with bibs! Lots of seafood yummies-- 3 big crab legs and lots of clams and mussels! Flavorful broth too. (5/5)\n\nOverall, this place is really good food-wise, but gosh, this place is just way too small for how busy it is, and the wait time is so annoying. I suppose they do not really have to care about that, since they're successful already as they are. I'm hesitant about coming back, but maybe once in a while.", "author": "Christina W."}

There's a whiteboard waitlist outside and a small bench to wait at. They don't have a text/calling system but seem to be pretty accommodating if you missed your name. We were told our wait was over an hour so my friend and I went to a nearby tea shop to kill some time.\n\nWe were eventually seated at the bar right by the kitchen. It was cool seeing all the food come and go but the space was definitely very cramped and I had to move to get out of the way several times. Otherwise service was awesome!\n\nFor our meal my friend and I ordered the Anchor Special for $50 which included 12 oysters, 4 chilled prawns, & a bowl of steamed clams.\n1) Oysters: We got 4 of each. Ichibans from Washington (mild, salty, and the meatiest, Chatham from Cape Cod (bright & plump), & Sweetwater  from Tomales Bay (sweet/mild brightness, less meaty)\n2) Steamed clams: Tender clams in a light broth. Took the broth home and made some awesome pasta too!\n3) Chilled prawns: Average prawns. Large and big but bordering on tough.\n\nWe ended our meal w/ their Cioppino and damn if it isn't the sexiest cioppino I've ever laid my eyes on. The size is definitely huge. If you're hungry this can be split between 2 people and still leave you full. This dish is just packed the brim with seafood from fish to mussels to crab. Every piece of meat was extremely tender and flavorful. The base was acidic and rich with a bit of spice and fresh seafood flavors seeping through every bite.\n\nThe garlic bread it came with was average. A bit overtoasted and tough. Looked like it would be extremely garlic-y but honestly a bit bland compared to the flavorful cioppino. In the end it's did it's job which is to get as much of the cioppino broth into my mouth as possible.\n\nOverall, this place is definitely worth the wait if you're a cioppino fan. Since it is fresh seafood the pricetag is slightly high but it's worth the quality and even the quantity. Would definitely come again.", "author": "Vivian C."}

It's a cozy restaurant that doesn't take reservations, so be prepared for a little wait. We waited for about 45 minutes, but it was well worth it. The owner came out with some cups of clam chowder for the people who were waiting, which was a nice touch. The service is very attentive and prompt even if the place is always busy. \nThe atmosphere is of an old school and no-nonsense San Francisco seafood joint, the kind that never goes out of style. We ordered a bunch of oysters; an even mix of the three kinds that had that day. The best were the oysters from Cape Cod with a clean, sweet, flavor of the sea. Followed by the oysters from New Brunswick, and last but not least, the oysters from Washington, which had a super clean but less dynamic flavor. They were all super fresh and worth visiting for. The crab cocktail was delicious as to be expected as was the clam chowder. They have a nice selection of drinks; wines, draft beer, bottled beer, and things that aren't wine or beer that I didn't pay attention to and can't remember. \nAnyway, this is a nice seafood experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-26", "description": "On a Sunday night, we waited about an hour and a half for a table of three. Maybe it was on us for not realizing how hoppin' this place is, combined with just showing up at a bad time (6:30?), but in my opinion, there's pretty much no restaurant in the world waiting that long for in the blustery San Francisco cold. \n\nThe way the tables worked was, in short, infuriating. You go to the whiteboard next to the front door, and write down your name, the number of people in your party, and the time at which you arrived. Bonus: there is a board of shame where they write your name if your party wasn't there when they called you. It is a teeny tiny place, like many excellent San Francisco establishments are, but the turnover was shockingly slow for a place that got food out fairly quickly. It seemed like we were the \"next table of three\" for about 50 minutes. Granted, this was due in part to a table that finished eating, then dawdled for about half an hour (immune to my glares from outside). I'm an asshole, I know, but it's just common courtesy not to hang around forever when you're done eating and you know people are waiting on your asses. We initially got skipped over, not because we weren't there, but due to the lightning speed with which the hostess was reading off names. I maintain that she at no point said our party's name, but that could be because my ears fell off in the cold. Luckily, one of my dining companions has the \"scorned, indignant, stay-at-home mom with plenty of time to speak to your manager\" aesthetic down pat. After a brief and tense stand-off, we were seated. \n\nImmediately upon sitting down, we were brought waters and a half-order of garlic bread as an apology for the miscommunication. I will say that after the initial tension, the service here was excellent; I'm not sure how much of that was due to the seating fiasco/the level of fear the waitstaff has for my friend. We were regularly checked on throughout our meal, our questions answered thoroughly, and our waters refilled often. Everyone was incredibly friendly, after we got into the restaurant. \n\nThe garlic bread was stellar. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside; topped generously with garlic and almost as importantly, mountains of Parmesan. Despite the cut I was nursing on the roof of my mouth, I barreled through the garlic bread because it was just that damn good, and well worth the pain. \n\nWe also ordered the crab cake entree, which cake with 3 good-sized crab cakes, roasted potatoes, a small salad (kind of?), tartar sauce, and a cup of clam chowder. The clam chowder was interesting, unlike other clam chowders I've had in the past. I'll preface by saying that if it were feasible and not horrendous, I would bathe in Boudin's clam chowder; we have a sordid love affair that stretches back decades. While not quite as flavorful, this chowder was incredibly smooth, with a good amount of clams and potatoes in each spoonful. I chose not to eat the salad or potatoes, as I was preparing my belly for the cioppino to come, but heard good things from my fellow diners. The crab cakes were fine. I was expecting more complexity in the flavors, and greater chunks of that Dungeness crab deliciousness; it was a little on the mushy side, save for the well-crisped exterior. Realistically, these seem like the quality of crab cakes I could make for myself, not something I'd pay a restaurant $27 for. The saving grace of this dish, hands down, was the tartar sauce. I'm not even a huge tartar sauce gal, but I would happily eat this by the spoonful. It was flavorful, smooth, and exquisite. \n\nOnto the main event: the cioppino. After seeing the cauldron that is the large cioppino, we opted for the smaller, and it was definitely a good call. Still a ridiculous amount of seafood, we could barely even get our bibs on straight before diving right in. The sauce of the cioppino is excellent, truly spectacular. The creatures it contained were: crab legs, sole, mussels, clams, and a couple of shrimp. I enjoyed most of it just fine, but the crab legs were excellent. This might be because I'm a crazy person who loves to use seafood crackers. Overall though, I was let down by the cioppino, because it was talked up so much and because when it comes down to it, I don't think I'll ever love another cioppino the way I love the one at Soto Mare in North Beach. Is that unfair to Anchor? Maybe, but the heart wants what the heart wants. \n\nIt seems unlikely that I'll return; it's not like there are no other seafood restaurants in the bay. The food was perfectly fine and the service was ultimately great, but the environment so small and crowded. Honestly, it's just not quite worth it to me for the price tag.", "author": "Justie L."}

I tried it again and I enjoyed every part of it, except the wait. The menu is pretty limited. We went with the anchor special (12 oysters, 6 shrimp and clams) and the large Cioppino. Neither were dissapointing, except I wish you got to choose the oysters instead of the spread (4 of each type they had on the menu). Had I known, I would have elected to just get a dozen oysters of my choosing and skip the clams and prawns. 1/3 of the choices were dime size oysters and quite buttery for my taste. The Cioppino was HUGE and delicious (keep in mind you have to crack your own crab). The garlic bread was honestly gross, cold and didn't have much of a flavor. The seafood was fresh and filling. It was too much food for the two of us, but we were happy to take the remainder home. The 4 stars is for service, as I explain in other reviews... if I'm going to wait an HOUR to pay over a hundred dollars for a meal I expect that our water glasses should stay filled, friendly servers and a check delivered in a timely manner. Secondly, the wait. I went expecting a wait, but the order in which they call the people was frustrating. There were people not present when their names were called, who showed up late and STILL got seated before us. They lucked out and literally came back 3 minutes before the guy walked out and jumped ahead of us even though they had missed their \"chance\" twice before. It was frustrating, but I can appreciate that it maybe the nature of the beast. \n\nPros: the Cioppino, Oysters (make sure you choose wisely!) \nCons: Wait, garlic bread\nOverall: I'll brave the wait and a hole in my wallet; the food is really good if you know what to order.", "author": "Whitney B."}

For only $10 bucks we were treated to some of the best mussels that I have ever eaten in my life. The sauce was easily one of the best things I have tasted in my life!

I could not help but soak up every last bit of sauce with the free bread!\n\nI followed up the mussels with the pasta special, Clam Linguini, and was equally impressed. I quickly devoured a huge bowl, stuffed with perfectly cooked, tender clams, and al dente noodles.

Small clams and steamed in an salty olive oil base. Good flavor, but felt weird that you couldn't drink or do anything else with the \"soup\". Too salty.\n\nThe cioppino was my favorite (no surprise). It had a variety of seafood, fish, crab, clam, shrimp. I personally would've gotten the large for two people and cut out the steamed clams.

In my book, this is up there with Swan Oyster Depot. Swan focuses more on the raw seafood (cherry clams and fish sashimi are my favorite) whereas Anchor has amazing cooked dishes (cioppino, seared scallops, steamed shellfish). \n\nEverything we had was so so good. The raw oysters were delicious but I don't remember choosing the kinds... it was just a general batch. From then on, the food just got better and better. The steamed clams was a massive dish. Unless you are a clam-fanatic, I would get the steamed shellfish combination so you get mussels and other things too.\n\nSeared scallops usually really turn me off because of the strange smell they emit after being cooked. But this one, when paired with the housemade tartar sauce, was on another level. It's the first time I didn't mind seared scallops at all. The dish came with vegetables (squash, potatoes, broccolini) that just make you want to smother them in the sauce too. \n\nLast but not least, the cioppino. I've had this dish many times at pretty reputable establishments so I contemplated skipping out. But holy moly. The broth was so good; I was satisfied just guzzling that down rather than eating the actual seafood. The small is a hefty portion to share even among four people but the large is truly a centerpiece that would dazzle any out-of-towners you bring here. There were shrimp, fish, mussels, clams and crab with two pieces of garlic bread topping it. A little bit of everything.

Other people were very pleasant though but because of how she treated us in the beginning I am giving 4 stars.

They seem to be changed daily based on what they have that's fresh. \n\nThey had 3 different types of oysters and when I asked questions about them, our waiter (not the rude lady) brought me and showed me how they looked and explained me the flavors. I took his recommendation and tried all 3 different kinds they had and it was the freshest and most delicious oysters I've ever had. I probably could've ordered another dozen but we wanted to try other stuff as well so we stopped. \n\nSince it was just two of us we ordered small cioppino. And let me tell ya it wasn't small. Enough for two people for sure and it paired very well with the wine they had. Best cioppino I had yet. Not too salty and perfectly seasoned.

We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted with water and a menu.  It was during the lunch rush so we were lucky.  The place is cozy and tight, don't expect any frills.  We ordered the half anchor special (6 oysters, 2 prawns, and what we thought were going to be 4 clams...We got about 8). We are huge oyster fans so where excited to try out 3 new oysters we don't get back home on the east coast.  They were salty, refreshing, and the delicious.  The prawns were a bit too salty for my taste, but my wife liked hers and the clams were delicious.  Made us wish we had saved our bread from earlier to dip into.  \n\nLike I said, we sat at the bar.  A gentleman was next to us and was picking at his food.  When he said he was done, he made some comment about how he doesn't like cornmeal and the woman behind the counter immediately said, why didn't tell us we would have made you something else.  He clearly has been here before, was extremely polite about it and said no worries.  He ordered another glass of wine and was content to sip that.  The next thing we see, the chef, another wonderful older woman, walks out and speaks to him, said I hear you don't like cornmeal.  I'm going to refire up your meal.  Would you like it now, or to go?  Now that is customer service.  This man clearly has been and will continue to be coming back to Anchor Oyster Bar, and with service like that who wouldn't go back?  \n\nI know I would go back just to try the Cioppini if I didn't live on the east coast.", "author": "Elyse L."}

Had I known about the feast that was about to ensue, I probably would have held off on the chowder. But since it was so good, I will hold off any regrets. The dozen oysters came with three different types. They were all amazingly fresh and had their own unique flavors. I enjoyed being able to taste a few varieties. I highly recommend. My wife and I decided to split the small Cioppino. The only thing this dish wasn't, was small. Everything else about it was amazing. This was my first time to eat Cioppino, so I don't have anything to compare it to. But if the rest of the places that serve this San Francisco past-time are this good, you should order it wherever you see it on the menu. The broth was so hearty and flavorful, I could have eaten just that by itself. But throw in a bevy of tasty seafood options and you have nothing short of 5 stars. About halfway through eating this, we quickly realized that we needed to turn our focus on the vast amounts of seafood so it won't go to waste. Because that bowl was not dwindling as our full factor was increasing.\n\nBecause of so many options of places to eat in the bay area, I'm not sure when my next trip to AOB with be.

We ordered the clam chowder, half anchor special and crab cakes and everything was to die for as its all fresh and done in house! One great thing about the chowder is you get those buttery oyster crackers which makes it phenomenal!\n\nIts a small shop but the staff there takes care of you like family.

I've had this location bookmarked for the longest time and finally had the chance to give it a try. Dropped by and was able to find parking less than a block away on the streets and maneuvered quickly through the pouring rain to sign up on the wait list. The restaurant is literally 5 tables big and only has one bar length table to hold 6-8 people. I'd say 25 people max in the restaurant so the wait was pretty long. The host told us it was going to be one hour + of a wait.... and he was RIGHT. We tried to find shelter from the rain close by at Philz Coffee while there was a bench stationed outside the restaurant but it was packed and wet from the rain. \n\nAfter a loooong wait, we were finally seated and on our way to dive in on the food. \nWe ordered:\n\nSmall Clam chowder - very flavorful and delicious, perfect sizing appetizer for one person \n\nOyster shooter - bigger than most places, very flavorful sauce with a big oyster piece at the bottom of it... Celery included to kill the strong taste in your mouth afterwards\n\nMussels in white wine sauce- this has got to be the hugest mussels I've eaten... It was literally so meaty and served in a huge dish plate. I think it's a great proportion to split it between two people. The sauce was filled with herbs and garlic pieces... I just felt like drinking the broth at one point. 5 star dish!!!\n\n\nJumbo prawn pasta - This was our carbs of the dinner supported once again HUGE prawns. Delicious flavoring for the pasta and once again great proportion to split! \n\nDespite the long long wait in a tiny local restaurant I think the food here is AMAZING and along with great professional customer service...

We signed ourselves in on the whiteboard where you put your name, party size, and arrival time. I like how they ask you for your arrival time so you actually know how long you've been waiting. We were told the wait would possibly be over an hour, but that didn't stop us! I'm always willing to wait for my first time at any restaurant if it's supposed to be really good. There's plenty of shops around the area to explore while waiting for your party to be called so the wait doesn't seem too long! \n\nThe restaurant is small - it only fits 25 people at most. Most of the parties before and after us were parties of two. I think they could've seated more people at a time if they had split their square tables into two smaller tables. Just throwing out a suggestion to help accommodate more customers at once, y'know? \n\nWe waited a little over an hour to get seated at the bar. We ordered a cup of clam chowder, a oyster shooter for him, green lip mussels, and some sort of shrimp pasta that was not on the menu (I saw pictures on yelp and asked for it!) The clam chowder was creamy and was just the perfect size for sharing.. I really liked the little potato bits in the soup. The oyster shooter.. I didn't try because I'm not too big of a fan. He said it had lots of flavor. His eye was literally twitching every gulp he took! The green lip mussels were HUUUUUUUUGE. They were the biggest mussels I have ever eaten in my life! The flavor of the broth was delicious. The shrimp pasta was yummy too. The shrimp were HUGE too, wowza. We didn't think we were gonna get full off of anything before we got any of our dishes, but what we ordered was more than enough. The portion sizes were definitely worth the price! \n\nStaff constantly checked up on us which was great. Offered to put our broths in smaller bowls just in case we wanted to keep them to dip our bread in. Thanks for asking! \n\nSatisfied my mussels craving... it's been a while since I've had mussels in a different broth/sauce.

I was afraid that I would hype it up too much in my head, but thankfully, I was not let down at all.\n\nMy friends and I managed to avoid long lines by going at around 4pm on a Monday, snagging a few seats at the bar. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful with their recommendations, and explained the specials quite nicely. We went with the half-order of the Anchor special: 6 oysters, 2 prawns, and steamed clams, as well as the greenlip mussels. The oysters were really tasty, and they gave us a variety of the Island Creek oysters that they \"import.\" The prawns were enormous and perfect with a little bit of lemon and cocktail sauce. Hoo-wee. However, the clams were really what blew me away. The steamed clams were tender and flavorful, and that broth! THAT BROTH. It was rich, savory, and just something I could drink and sop up with bread over and over. It had a bit of a sour profile, and the seafood flavors really enhanced everything. \n\nAs for the greenlip mussels, the broth that they came was just as delicious, with an amped up spiciness and acidity, as there was some tomato strewn throughout. The mussels themselves were also HUGE. I had never had these New Zealand mussels before, and they were really nice and tender. The shells were pretty aesthetically pleasing too, although we didn't really spend too much time with the shells, haha. Easily a must-order if you like a spicier broth and the meatiness of mussels.\n\nAs mentioned before, the staff was very friendly and chatty, in addition to being very efficient and helpful. While it's reasonably priced for seafood, it's definitely pricey if you're eating solo, so bring a date or a few friends so you can share a bunch of things. Make sure to come on an off-peak time to avoid lines. Also, note that they open late in the afternoon on Sundays, so sadly, there's no hope of a Sunday oyster brunch.\n\nThe menu may not be as diverse as that of Swan Oyster Depot, but it is straightforward, and the flavors are immense and delicious. Anchor will likely be one of my first return stops on my future trips to SF. I still have yet to try their famous cioppino, so that'll have to be a priority next time.", "author": "Eric J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-03", "description": "Is anything worth a 2 hour wait?? Hard to say for sure but the cioppino at Anchor Oyster Bar is the best I've had. I see why people wait and wait for a chance to be seated at the bar or at a table to sample the oh so good San Francisco creation. Anchor is located on very busy Castro Street next to the original location of Harvey Milk HQ/camera shop. Read the plaques.\n\nWe arrived around 8pm. There was a good amount of people waiting already. We put our name on the board and one of the staff members said it would be about 45min to an hour wait. I wish that was the case. We didn't get seated until around 10pm. They are supposed to close at 10pm but they assured everyone waiting that they go through the whole list. They want to make sure people that have been waiting get to eat. It was a cool city night and around 9pm one of the staff came outside to give everyone cups of steaming hot clam chowder. It was really good clam chowder and it hit the spot. That was nice on their part because the restaurant space is small and people that are waiting can be out in the cold for a long time.\n\nWe were seated at the bar. The bar seats about 8 people and there are a handful of tables around it. We started off with the half order of the Anchor Special: 6 oysters, 4 steamed clams and 2 chilled prawns ($22.95). It was delicious. The oysters were tasty, they gave us many more clams than we expected as it had been served in this garlicky goodness of a broth that made for good buttered bread dipping. The chilled prawns were SO DAMN GOOD. The prawns were so sweet and and tasty. Tasted like the ocean. Pure goodness. Gimme 6 of those next time. The Anchor Special was great with the bread that was served as a starter. Really good and thick cut. \n\nNext up was the cioppino. The oh so glorious cioppino we got was the full order. It is huge. Feeds 3 easily but since we waited so long and were so hungry, we figure why not go all in? So we did. Priced at $59.95 so its not cheap but it is well worth it. You get everything and more in this massive stew of the ocean's greatest hits. You get white fish, clams, mussels, crab, prawns, baby clams, shrimp and that broth... You just wanna swim in it. Like a hot spring but better. Ha! It really was good. The cioppino was excellent. You have to get it. I warn you... It is HUGE and the servers will even show you the bowl sizes to illustrate just how big. Excellent for garlic bread dipping. It came with some REALLY good, thick garlic bread. So good. You might be offered a bib to wear. It can get awesomely messy.\n\nService was excellent. The staff had a great attitude as I'm sure it was a long day for them but  true to their word, they accommodated everyone on the list. They do periodically come outside to see any updates or drop outs on the sign in list. So they definitely stay on top of things. They even gave us a glass of a red that one of the staff brought as they were having a Hungarian dinner after hours prepared by the chef who is of Hungarian descent. That was nice of them. I look forward to returning and having more of that cioppino, more shellfish and some of that clam chowder. We'll be sure to get there earlier next time. Way earlier.

Gone are the days I'll happily wait in line for food (IN THE COLD, MIND YOU), but for this place I make an exception. The ambience is nothing to write home about, but the seafood here is INCREDIBLE.\n\nOur first time here we had a starter of clams and we knew we were in for a treat. They were perfectly done, with a generous portion in a delicious herbed wine garlic sauce. Next, we ordered the cioppino- a large (which scared the waiter) but we let him know we'd handle it ;].\n\nThe cioppino was just PERFECTION. The large was huge - definitely big enough for 3-4 but since the dude and I don't really eat bread, it was the perfect amount. All the seafood was perfectly cooked, and the prawns were the size of my hand! The soup was also just out of this world too, I wish we had saved it for reuse at home. It was hot, garlicky and had just enough heat to give it great depth. We also had a nibble of the infamous garlic bread and immediately pushed it away- only because it was way too good to stop eating. It was soft inside and crispy on top, layered with tons of yummy parmesan and garlic. People ordered extra sides of JUST the bread, and I can see why. All the food we had that day was literally lick-your-plate good food.\n\nWe sat at the bar which we were originally bummed about, but the bartender was so funny and nice that he made it a real joy. This really is the best cioppino I've had in my life- and well worth the wait!

There was a true assortment of seafood:  fish (possibly sea bass - awesome texture), clams, Dungeness crab, 2 HUGE shrimp, and two types of mussels.  Along with my cioppino, I had a glass of Russian River Chardonnay and an assortment of 3 different oysters.  Altogether, my bill for 1 came to $75.  \n\nThe place is cozy but truly a gem on Castro.

It's a small and cute restaurant but much like many oyster bars I've been to, seating is limited and comes on a first come, first serve basis. At the very least, they're nice enough to call your name a few times and try to accommodate if you don't hear your name.  \n\nNow, let's say you finally get into the restaurant. It's bustling; it's busy with waiters all around. The restroom requires you to go past the kitchen so you get to see a bit of the workshop and that's small too!  \n\nFinally seated - what do you see? You get a two-page spread menu filled with seafood goodies. Now, it could have been my hungry stomach from the wait or the actual food itself but everything we had was very solid. We had the following interesting delicacies: \n\nDungeness crab: Coming in 1/2 and full orders, the full order for two was more than enough. Lots of crab pieces (and yes, you'll have to dig in with your hands...wish they gave towel wipes). The crab was cooked well; the garlic sauce delicious (wipe that bread in there!) and all the sauces/condiments you need were at your side. \nGarlic bread: All the Yelpers recommend it and yea...you do get a complimentary loaf of bread but the garlic bread is just buttery, garlic goodness that fits perfectly with the rest of the seafood. Well worth it (also comes in 1/2 and full varieties - the 1/2 was more than enough for a party of 2)\nClam chowder: Only got a cup but it was solid - nothing more, nothing less (and a cup came with the crab entree!)  \n\nPricing-wise, for two, it ended up being around $60ish which wasn't too shabby.

While waiting, a staff came outside to pass out samplers of their clam chowder and thank us all for waiting - wow who does that anymore?! \n\nThe clam chowder was delicious - not too thick/heavy but full of flavor.\nI got both the steamed shellfish combo ($29) and the small cioppino ($37). If you're a party of 2 - probably shouldn't get both because the portion size will shock you - trust me - my jaw dropped as they placed the food on my table. I've never been to a seafood joint where they're that generous with their portions - please never change :)\n\nThe steamed shellfish combo itself would have probably been enough for 2 with some additional apps. The small cioppino was slightly smaller but still enough for 2. Out of the both - my favorite was the steamed shellfish - one of the most amazing lemon, garlic, butter, herb broths I've had in a seafood dish. The mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp were all fresh, cooked perfectly, and seeped in that wonderful sauce. \n\nThe cioppino was delicious as well - light and thin tomato broth but packed full of seafood and flavor. I liked this dish but just thought the steamed shellfish packed more of a punch on the sauce - can't go wrong with butter and garlic. \n\nSpeaking of garlic - order the garlic bread basket! Amazing, toasted, crisp bread with garlic, butter, and cheese shavings. You'll want this to dip into the shellfish sauce.", "author": "Brenda L."}

Even before the restaurant opened, there was a list of names waiting to get in already.  The place is small, so definitely go early.\n\nWe went with the specials menu, and I had the Open faced sandwich.  At $16.95 it's a bit pricey for lunch, but it was so filling and delicious.  Heaping amounts of crab/shrimp covered with cheese on a crunchy piece of toast, it was decadent.\n\nThe service was a bit lacking, and it took half an hour for the food to come out.  So come here if you have plenty of time and don't need to hurry back to the office.", "author": "Karen L."}

Must try for everyone who loves fresh seafood!\n\nGot 1/2 anchor special: fresh oysters, steamed clams and shrimp. The oysters were super fresh and delicious but nothing TOO special compared to other places like Hog Island, same goes for shrimp. The steamed clams though were ON POINT. The broth it came with was super flavorful and the clams tasted very fresh and were cooked perfectly.\n\nThe **CIOPPINO****: AMAZING. MUST ORDER. We got the small and it was huge. Tomato base broth flavored with tons of herbs and spices. Explosion of flavor in your mouth - absolutely delicious and incredible! Loads of fresh seafood in it too (mussels, shrimp, crab). \n\nGarlic Bread was soooo good too! Especially paired with the cioppino. \n\nThe service was so great too! They were very attentive and my bf and I were in a rush so our waiter rushed our order for us and delivered our food super fast. He was very considerate! \n\nThe prices do run a bit high; we paid about $90 for the meal but we were so full and the seafood was so fresh. The wait is also definitely worth it!

First of all several reviews claim that the large portion is enough for 4-5 adults which is false. My husband and I were able to complete the whole bowl with nothing left but extra broth. The broth was good but lacked appropriate flavoring. Regarding the contents of the soup, I was taken back by the fact that the large portion only had TWO large shrimp for $60!! Not only that, our soup did not have any scallops and most cioppino dishes I have had from other restaurants have definitely had scallops. It comes with garlic bread which was just ok. We ordered an extra order of bread however it had a bitter taste and it was baked too hard. Forgot to mention that the clam chowder here was also very lack luster.

The pictures of giant bowls of seafood with a good amount of broth had me sold.\n\nWe came here and ordered half an order of garlic bread and a steamed bowl of clams.\n\nI think the food we got could have fed 3-4 people. I meannn... We still ate the majority of the garlic bread and ate all the clams. Two very determined adults can put that stuff away for sure but we were stuffed and ready for a nap after.\n\nThe clams came in a giant bowl where you could probably bathe a newborn. But you wouldn't want to do that... because that, folks, would be a waste of broth! The broth was damn sexy. It's a white wine based broth with the right amount of olive oil/butter. It was flavored with lots of garlic, a happy amount of chopped parsley and fresh thyme. The squeeze of lemon lifted up the beautiful flavors of the clams. I just sighed dreamily typing that up.\n\nThe garlic bread was amazing. The bread had a nice texture to it so that you could actually lift the piece of bread up without it completely falling apart just because it had been doused in butter. And don't get me wrong, this isn't some diet bread crap. It IS doused in butter. Garlicky butter. And shavings of sharp parmesan. But the nice thing is, they used some really good, crusty bread with a good foundation. It even held up to being dipped in the clam broth.\n\nService was a little slow in the beginning but it picked up eventually and all went well.

I usually I get started with a cup of clam chowder; indeed, I can't recall eating at The Anchor Oyster Bar and not having this soup. It's full of flavor and seasoned so well that it leaves you craving for more -- the only addictive soup I have ever had. Other great finds here are the oysters on a half shelf, which are always fresh and those oh so yummy crab cakes. It's easy to do crab cakes bad, but at this place, they are just different from the classic crab cakes most of restaurants have on their menu. The Anchor Oyster Bar is a bit pricey but you won't regret paying for this quality of food. I have been trying to try the entire menu and I still have about 40% to go (I won't give up until I taste everything). So far I have liked every dish I have been able to try, however, I really think the Ciopinno and the Dugeness Crab are the finest.

We only had one table ahead of us. This is a tiny little restaurant in the middle of the Castro area of San Francisco. Parking is hard to find. While my hubby and I waited for a table we saw the parking maids in full force. Check for parking and make sure your meter is full or you will be given a ticket. \n\nThe weather on this day was a down pour. It was nice that they have an outdoor seating area that is has a covered and has 2 padded bench seats, if it weren't for that we probably would of left. As we waited they gave us a sample of clam chowder. It was a nice touch and warmed us up before heading inside for our lunch date. \n\nThe restaurant has a small bar and about 6 tables. I loved that it was so intimate and that you could have a conversation without being to loud or stuffy.  \n\nWe tried several items off the menu and all of them were great. We started with the Anchor Special  1/2 order it came with 6 oysters on a half shell, 2 large shrimp and steamed clams.  The oysters were fresh and the shrimp was large. \n\nCrab cakes appetizer:  It was full of crab and came with a nice sauce\n\nHalf order of garlic bread: Nice and warm when it was served it us. \n\nCioppino smaller: You must get this! Don't even think about not getting this. Tomato base, crab, shrimp, clams, fish, and so on. It is so tasty and it even comes with a slice or two of garlic bread. Use that to soak the sauce. The dish was so big that I was laughing and we wound up taking home with us. \n\nOur server was friendly and nice.", "author": "Kathryn W."}

Even though they don't take OpenTable reservations, they do in fact take out OpenTable vouchers. So boyfriend and I decided to have a casual lunch here to celebrate our anniversary. \n\nI did some research before heading here (naturally) and decided that we'd definitely order the cioppino and clam chowder. It was pretty early when we arrived (1130am) so we didn't go too crazy on the raw stuff, which I'll be sure to try next time.\n\nFor the two of us we ordered the small cioppino, garlic butter crab (half order) that also comes with a cup of chowder (additional $1 for a bowl instead) and garlic bread. \n\nWe came to the conclusion that we are not cioppino fans. Granted, it was our first time having this dish, and we both were not over the moon about it. It's definitely an acquired taste and could cause some pretty intense heartburn with all that tomato. The chowder however was delicious and so far the best I've had in SF - not at all too salty, with plentiful chunks of clams and potatoes. The garlic bread was delicious and boyfriend was a little upset that we only ordered the half order and demanded that we order a larger size (*fatty alert*). As for the garlic butter crab, this was probably the winner between the two entrees. The sauce was delicious and the crab was not too hard to crack. I mean, we were given all the tools we needed to do so successfully: tiny forks and crab crackers. \n\nOur bill came out to about $80. OpenTable lets you know to give your server a heads up before using the check so when I whipped out my phone (OT says its okay to have it on mobile or print out) our server was a little thrown off by it and initially wasn't sure if they took it, even after I confirmed the name of the restaurant and address. Anyway, after a quick call to her boss, she said it was allowed and took down the information.\n\nAll in all, our experience was good - solid 3.5 - 4 stars. The food was good, service was okay, only thing however is that it may have been a better idea to have dinner here instead of lunch - we just didn't want to wait in a crazy line, so we made sure to visit when they first opened. I'd love to try their raw stuff next time.", "author": "Kathleene E."}

A  must order. \n\nSteamed Black Mussels: Mussels were steamed perfectly. Portion was pretty generous as well. The broth has a kick to it but it worked.

Technically I would give it 4.5 stars and not 5 only because they don't have the greatest variety of oysters when I have gone, but I am happy to round it up to 5!\n\nSmall place that provides the chance to quaff fresh oysters in very welcoming surroundings. Service is quietly efficient (quick drink order, fresh bread and butter put out quickly) and just friendly enough to keep you engaged.  If oysters are not enough, make sure to check out the daily specials.  I have had a Welsh fish stew here recently that would make a Welshman go \"ffantastig\" as they ploughed through the bowl of fragrantly flavorful broth teeming with fish, mussels and perfectly cooked shrimp.  Gauche as it may seem, I always seem to lift up the bowl and slurp down the broth (danger alert : do not attempt this with the Cioppino....I unfortunately found that the slurpage resulted in micro red dots all over my shirt !!) so as to not lose any bit of it.\n\nA recent trip results in the consumption of flounder wrapped around a crab filling which was seasoned enough to keep it interesting, yet with enough care so the sweetness of the crab showed through and was a perfect accompaniment to the flounder.  The accompaniments of mashers tasted like they were treated with a splash of seafood broth and the perfectly cooked broccoli added a pleasant vegetal bite to the dish.\n\nA must stop if you are in the neighborhood and if you are not, its a cheap Uber ride from major metros!!", "author": "Sunay P."}

Recommended by Erika C., I came here last night to celebrate Dono's birthday. At first, I was dreading the wait and really reconsidered choosing another place after reading the reviews on how long the wait is typically. However, on this Friday night around 7p, it wasn't too crowded yet. It only took around 30 mins until we were seated. A waiter kindly offered samples of clam chowder and blankets while we all waited outside for our tables. \n\nOnce seated, we ordered garlic bread, dozen oysters, crab cake platter w/ side of clam chowder and roasted potatoes, and a small cioppino. We definitely bit off more than we could chew. Dono loved the oysters. They had three different varieties that night. Clam chowder, although not the best after visiting Seattle, is great, not too salty with clam taste. The crab cakes I could have done without. I couldn't taste the crab flavor as the breading was quite overpowering. \n\nI do highly suggest ordering the garlic bread with the cioppino. They are great complements! For two people, the small cioppino is more than enough! Sadly, because the cioppino came last, we were both too full to eat much of it that we had to pack two tubs of it back home! But the soup was just amazing! Great consistency and depth of flavors, the blend of seafood and tomato flavors... Yum! And don't forget to dip that garlic bread into the soup!", "author": "Henry P."}

And that is a good thing. I walked by it for years, thinking it was cute (only 5 tables and bar seating), but never ventured in. But once I did, I was hooked.\n\nAgain, it's cozy and only seats a few, and most always for dinner - and ALWAYS during the weekend for both lunch and dinner - there is a wait. They do not accept reservations. There is a white board outside where you leave your name on the list. And sorry if it's cold - this place is too small for you to wait inside. Often though, they'll bring out cups of chowder for its enduring patrons. \n\nAfter 10 years, I have had most everything on the fixed menu. And they have a daily changing menu, so you can always try something new. \n\nThe fixed menu has a selection of fresh shellfish, salads, chowder, crab cakes, a cracked Dungeness crab (seasonally), and an (expensive) cioppino. You cannot lose with anything on this menu! If it's your first visit and you're with friends, I recommend the Anchor Special (12 oysters, 8 steamed clams, 4 chilled prawns) or the truly stellar (SF's own!) cioppino. Both are great for sharing. In fact, you kind of *have* to share the cioppino, it's huge!\n\nI am also a recent convert to the salads, which never seemed that interesting 'on paper, but they really highlight the freshness and quality of the seafood. The shrimp salad (with lots of blue cheese dressing) is my go-to. \n\nThey keep it simple on the daily changing menu - generally the day's selection of oysters and wines, a simple fish dish (usually a baked fillet), a shellfish pasta, maybe a special cioppino or stew, maybe the crab burger, maybe the crab-shrimp-cheese open faced sandwich. I won't call anything out, because I have had them all, and they're all great.\n\nThe success of this place is SIMPLICITY and FRESHNESS. The food is quality and fresh, the preparations are simple, everything is well presented. This place is probably in my TOP FIVE of SF haunts I could not do without.\n\nIf you have to use the bathroom, you're in luck (I guess) - you have to go through the tiny kitchen to get to the tiny bathroom, so you get to see the cooking in action. Really, the kitchen is small enough where you could get burnt. Be careful!", "author": "Corey M."}

Still they close at 10:00 p.m., at least according to Yelp & I walked in a few minutes before 10 thinking I may be out of luck but Robin said no problem so I sat at the counter, ordering great a cup of delicious chowder & small Cioppino that I'm capitalizing (C) it was so full of seafood, most in the shell from crab, clams, two kinds of mussels & giant prawns plus lots of fish. The broth was too good!  Also must mention the regular bread & garlic bread that later topped the Cioppino. So much fresh-tasting seafood I couldn't finish!  When I arrived home & unpacked my 'to go' I was pleasanly surprised by a couple of extras that are delicious. Guess it sometimes pays to be the last customer out, LOL.

We had enjoyed my kind of food earlier (Asian) and now it was time for his kind of food (American). I'm not from San Francisco so I do not know where the best clam chowder is - I just know where the most famous is. \n\nI really wanted to make sure he got his wish fulfilled!\n\nI'm sure you know what comes next. Yes! I checked Yelp. I looked for the best clam chowder nearest to the Castro and Anchor Oyster Bar came up. It is nothing short of amazing that such a great restaurant is in this neighborhood since the Castro is plagued with mediocre restaurants - most of them on Castro are 3.5 stars or less. Anchor truly stands out!\n\nWhen we got there we saw there were people waiting outside of the restaurant. It's that good! We didn't feel like waiting regardless of what Yelp said about how good the restaurant was so we walked up and down Castro looking for restaurants that were not empty or that were not 3.5 and less according to Yelp. We found nothing else! We were about to get pizza when I decided to remind my BF he was craving clam chowder - so we walked up to the Anchor again and found out they had called our name already. No problem - one of the Anchor guys told us we would not wait much more than 15 minutes to be called again so we waited and chatted with some cool chicks from Toronto. They called our name in maybe 20 minutes.\n\nAnchor is small. It's kind of a tight squeeze. Let's just say it's a place to get cozy with your neighbor. There's a bar and tables. The decor is not remarkable. That is, unless you find a simple real looking mackerel and that sort of thing on the wall to be a work of art.\n\nFirst off, they brought us bread and butter. The bread was nothing to write home about. As an appetizer we ordered the combination cocktail which includes shrimp, prawns and crab. They are served with a side of red sauce and horseradish. The guy that took our order explained to us that the cocktail was a 40's (or 30's) style dish. It was quite fresh, tasty and not fishy at all! We both ordered the crabcakes which came with a cup of clam chowder (about $25). Both these items were fabulously delicious! Everything was so fresh! We also had some great local white wine.\n\nOur server was really nice and attentive. She made sure we had water often. We even got a show from the dishwasher who was playing wine glasses full of water like as if they were musical instruments. He looked to see if anyone noticed and smiled when he saw we were watching.\n\nParking is a real problem here but we took the BART so we had no problem getting here. \n\nI'm glad I insisted that we come here even after my BF had given up on this place because he was so hungry and didn't want to wait!

My personal favorite is the chioppino. We've had it at some pretty amazing Italian restaurants in SF but I prefer it from AOB. It's brothy & flavorful & oh so delicious. There's no pasta in it to fill you up because there's so much seafood, pasta is unnecessary. They top it off with their delightful cheesy roasted garlic bread. There are two sizes now, reg $35 & large $55. I could probably eat the smaller one by myself if I were really really hungry & wore stretchy pants. Most girls would probably be better off sharing it. The larger one is definitely big enough for three people. The oyster platter is also amazing, as is the steamed clams. \n\n\n    Do not be put off by how small this place is. What they lack in space, they make up for in customer service & quality. Which means that you should expect to pay a bit more for phenomenal seafood and you may have to wait also. Do yourself a favor and wait. They often bring out samples to those waiting, so it's definitely worth your time.\n\n    Came back to AOB with family from Chicago who had never even heard of chioppino & it blew their minds. They were amazed by the phenomenal customer service & the food. We ordered a small AND a large chioppino & the steamed shellfish platter so we had leftovers. I took them home to my parents AND they were amazed at how delicious it was the next day. Don't forget to order some garlic bread too.", "author": "Patricia J."}

One of your friend is a hungry whiner and your other friend ALWAYS know of a good place nearby. It takes a real standup guy to hold down the fort and wait. \n\nAnchor Oyster will reward you handsomely for your patience. Like literally. They pass out free clam chowder for those who are waiting. It's good chowder too, and at the very least, your friends will ease the bickering. \n\nBut the real reward is inside, for when you are finally seated. Anchor has fresh seafood that can rival the mightiness of the Chinese Steamed Fish. They really focus on the natural tastes of their dishes. Order the oysters and the clams and they'll bring your taste buds Under the Sea to meet Ariel the Little Mermaid. \n\nThe dish that really brings it home is of course the Cioppino. Never mind pronouncing the word, just enjoy the food. It's a seafood broth with a slightly spicy tomato base. I don't enjoy cracking crab shells, so I just contented myself with the crabjuice infused broth.\n\nGreat things come to those who wait.

I figure hey, oysters are pretty good and light right?  Let's come to Anchor, which I know is excellent.  Except it's on Castro Street...on the weekend after the Supreme Court decided (mostly) in favor of gay marriage.  Yeah, let's just say getting here was a pain in the ass and then some.  But after being stuck on Church Street for two hours and waiting in line for one hour, is it still worth it? HELL YES IT IS.\n\nAnd yeah, so much for just oysters.  Don't get me wrong, the oysters were exquisite.  Had the Hog Island Kumamotos, Washington Tottens, and New Brunswick French Kisses (these were the best of the bunch IMO).  But if I took THAT damn long to get here, we gotta go deep.  My friend got the cioppino, small variety.  Yeah, if that's small, then I don't want to know what large is (actually I did see someone order the large size, let's just say it's about the size of a tank).  I'm a sucker for cod, and one of the specials of the day was cod with the most awesome tomato basil butter sauce.  Seriously, I could eat anything with that sauce: fish, beef, burritos, maybe even fruit.\n\nLast note: their service is BEYOND FANTASTIC.  While we were waiting in line, I can understand why they were initially hesitant to give us some ice water.  There's like 10,000 people outside celebrating, I don't blame them at all.  But once they figured that out, they were super cool.  Plus I was talking to the chefs who made the tomato basil butter sauce, asked them what it was made of.  Not only did they tell me, they actually offered some sauce for me to take home.  And it wasn't a small cup or anything, they gave me enough to last for a good 2-3 meals.  MUCH APPRECIATION!  Seriously, you can't buy that level of service anywhere.\n\nLove love love this place, I just wish it weren't so small so that the wait doesn't take forever.", "author": "Alexander Y."}

Visiting Anchor Oyster Bar was very obviously the highlight of my trip to SF. \n\nThe restaurant is adorable (sailor themed), and very very small. I would recommend getting there ASAP if you don't want to eat your arm in anticipation. The three of us wrote our names down about 5:20pm on a Saturday night, ran across the street for a quick cocktail and came back. We were seated by about 6:30pm - not bad! Totally worth the wait. Hell I would have easily waited two hours for this meal.\n\nWe ate like little piggies. Everything was so GD delicious: oyster shots (non-alcoholic, the best bloody mary I've ever had and I hate bloody mary's), fresh oysters (Cape Cod, Seattle, and some local ones), crab (cooked to perfection and served simply with butter and lemon), clam chowder (pretty decent but soon forgotten due to everything else being so good), and...the Cioppino. The Cioppino was simply divine. Mussels, clams, crab, fish, shrimp in a perfect garlicky-tomato-y broth. The garlic bread that came with it was sinfully delicious. I'm salivating all over my keyboard just thinking about it. And the small portion was definitely enough for 2-3 people. \n\nOur server was super friendly, funny, and attentive. He threw in an extra bowl of chowder when he saw my friend and I splitting one and said, \"no one should share a bowl of chowder!\" What a sweetie.", "author": "Nivedita B."}

Anchor provided quality seafood, quantity, AND value - it was amazing! There was a line and we waited about 45 minutes at 6:30pm which isn't too bad. But you could get lucky, the line fluctuates and alot of times people don't show up when their name is called.\n\nI shared one Mussels Entree ($18.24) - 5 STARS: I would recommend ordering it half Greenlip (large mussels) and half black mussels (small, sweet mussels). Both were super fresh but I recommend doing half-half because I thought I would love the smaller mussels since I like small oysters, but the larger oysters were more palatable to me. There was something that almost reminded me of liver with the smaller ones, hard to describe, but I think the larger ones are more mild in flavor. It is simmered in a deliciously fragrant broth, probably made mostly of butter and fresh Italian herbs. I believe there was also some crack laced in there. Amazing.\n\nClam Chowder Bowl ($6.50) - 4.5 STARS: This was delicious, fresh, and perfectly creamy. I have to give 4.5 stars just because my favorite clam chowder in SF goes to Hog Island, which is New England style but still alot lighter. I would recommend getting the bowl over the cup because it's so much better value for an extra $2 or so.\n\nCioppino - 4 stars: Great tomato based broth, but prefer the taste and freshness of the mussels. \n\nLinguini and Shrimp - 3 stars: standard. Shrimp were large but tasted a bit bleachy. \n\nCrab Cake Entree w/Clam Chowder Cup ($25.95) - 3 STARS: I really don't like crab cakes, but I tried some of a friends and it was good ... I guess? Really rich if you're into that kind of thing. Also, wasn't a fan of the side salad and potatoes.\n\nGarlic Bread ($5.95) - 5 STARS: You could tell they didn't use stale bread, it was super fresh, toasted, and baked with a generous amount of butter and garlic.

Thanks to yelp, I found Anchor Oyster Bar! It was Sunday afternoon and the stars must have been aligned bc it was 3:55 when we got to AOB. They were about to open at 4pm so we just sat outside on the cushioned bench to wait. Soon after, more people started to line up. At 4 we were inside and chose seats at the bar. This place filled up fast bc half an hour later, there were a bunch of ppl outside waiting for tables. \n\nWe started off with 2 soju oyster shooters. Yum! Then we ordered the Anchor Special: 12 oysters on the half shell, 8 steamed clams and 4 chilled prawns. The oysters were so fresh and sweet. The prawns were huge and yummy. The steamed clams were cooked in this amazing herb, butter, white wine broth. Too good! I wanted to eat more oysters but I'm slightly allergic, so I had to exercise some self control.", "author": "Liv A."}

Intimate, comfortable, rich with seafood and filled with local charm. \n\nAnchor Oyster Bar embodies, what I like to call, San Francisco's local charm- unpretentious, casual and delicious dining, with a really long wait. If you can't tell already, San Franciscans love to wait (because almost all good restaurant have more than 30 minute wait-time with some requiring you to stay around so that you can't just leave your number and venture elsewhere).  Anchor Oyster Bar is the same way, with it sometimes taking as long as 1.5hr to get a seat (even at the bar)! Long wait aside, you'll be very happy and bubbly by the time you get seated, either at the bar or a table, probably because by then, you've already filled up on a few glasses of wine. Also take note that they do not accept call-in reservations and require you to be present when they call your name. So...don't venture too far, unless you're 15 lines down the list. \n\nOnce you step in, you'll be welcomed by a gusto of delicious garlic seafood aroma, warming your soul, body and senses. It's a beautiful refuge from the perpetual San Francisco fog. Sit down and start looking at the menu. Know to order the cioppino (even though it is not listed on the menu), and some drinks even if you haven't had a chance to look at the menu because, trust the Yelper's, it is really THAT good. There's no room for second guessing when it comes to the cioppino. If you're a party of 2 or 3, one cioppino and a few oysters/clams/steamed bivalves should be more than enough food to share. I say this because the cioppino is big enough. My boyfriend and I made the mistake of over-ordering cioppino, shucked oysters, clam chowder, steamed mussels AND clams. In the end, we left with very happy stomachs but also very bloated stomachs, even though we are both known for being able to eat a lot. \n\nHowever, you MUST order the cioppino! It's the best in SF Bay Area and the seafood in it is phenomenal, filled with dungness crab, fish, mussels, herbs, garlic and fresh tomato sauce.  I can't rave enough about it and sometimes salivate to the thought of it. \n\nEXCELLENT. I can't wait to come back :)", "author": "Jenny Z."}

We got there alil after opening and the first wave of people were seated so we had to wait. Waited for about and hr before someone finally left. Which brings me to point out pet peeve number 1: \n      If youre eating at a oviously small establishment such as this with a large following... dont loiter. Eat your food pay your bill and get out. You dont need to spend an extra 2 hrs chit chatting and taking up space when there r a million people waiting to eat. Thats just rude. People are trying to run a business. Its not starbucks people.\n\nNow that i got that off my chest. Once we were seated, service was polite and efficient. The kids ordered a big bowl of clams each and literally inhaled it.

Wasn't the most comfy or ideal seating situation but they threw in some complimentary mussels in a yummy tomato broth and distracted by all the yummy food- so we were happy.\n\nPARKING\nParking is not so great, like anywhere in SF.

I was pretty excited about the sound of a hyped up crab caesar salad, a combination of two of my favorite things.\n\nI started with the chowder based on a lot of reviews saying how good it was. That turned out to be totally misleading. It was plain old average clam chowder. Oh well, that's not why I was there.\n\nI have to admit I was really skeptical about the idea of a $26 salad so to be on the safe side I asked for a half order. I'm glad I did because what came was a giant plate of greens and meat. I can't imagine putting down an entire full size order. I thought the dressing itself was good, but not much better than average. It got the job done. What I was really happy with were the giant delicious garlic bread croutons and the heaping pile of crab on top. Together these made this salad a definite winner.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this 7x7 dish and I do think it deserves its spot on the 2015 list. I'm not quite sure that this is the best salad in the city but I will say that \"I'm a fan.\"", "author": "Mark O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-08", "description": "Taking the crown as one of my tastiest SF seafood meals thus far, my meal at the small, locally owned Anchor Oyster Bar was one for the crab books. Our Saturday evening started out with an hour-long wait; the wait is understandably long as the tiny restaurant boasts no more than 5 tables and a few bar seats. I was particularly lucky this evening and ended up with one of the best tables in the house - I would not have been happy if I had waited as long as we did to get seated at the bar. Take caution and either plan to go with 4 people so you're guaranteed a table, or be mentally ready to sit at the bar.*\nWe started off our meal with a selection of oysters - they were offering 3 selections today and we tried one of each. As an oyster newbie, these were about as tasty as you can get. Our waiter was extremely friendly and helpful with good suggestions of what to get. Although the cioppino looked and smelled absolutely delicious, my hankering for crab got the best of me, and my friend and I split the whole cracked Dungeness crab (available seasonally) in the garlic, lemon sauce (although plain is offered as well). The sauce was perfection - slightly spicy, warm, lemony and garlicy, this dipping sauce was all I could ask for as a perfect complementary base for the crab. It was perfect for bread dipping in between crab bites as well. The crab itself was moist, and juicy, and knowing it was sustainably caught made it even better! The crab comes with choice of clam chowder and salad before, so we got one of both for the table. Although a little on the 'crab overload' with the chowder, the soup was one of the most delicious chowders I've tasted and the salad was a great addition to the meal to help fill that vegetable gap. All in all this meal gave the quintessential setting to a fun, seafood meal. Perhaps the best part? The price tag was very reasonable for the quality of the seafood (it's sustainably fished!), and amount of food. Point of this review? If you feel like crab, go here", "author": "Nicole W."}

Insanely delicious, the porcelain bowl was piled high with tiger prawns, manila mussels, clams, halibut filets, and crab swimming in a rich tomato broth. \n\nForget about piecing together Saturday night, my friend and I went to town with that bowl of cioppino devouring every succulently tender crustacean and slurping EVERY last drop of the tomato broth divinely rich with deep complex flavors with a garlicky herbaceousness from the fresh garlic and thyme. \n\nDO NOT FORGET to save some of the garlic bread for sopping up the broth. Pure sensational bliss. Orgasms are overrated. It's all about the FOODGASMS. ;) \n\nS E R V I C E\nAttentive but only slightly friendly; I asked for change for a dollar so I can feed the meter and one of the wait staff was very hesitant (I had to ask twice) about giving me four quarters.

I think a lot of people waited over two hours for this place and that two hour wait was so worth it!\n\nThe BF and I came here on our day trip to SF.  We arrived there was a bunch of people waiting outside since the restaurant is so small and there's no wait room inside. I put my name on the board (the board is located by the door) along with the time we arrived. The worker told us it would be about an hour and a half wait for a party of two so we walked around and checked out bars/shops around the vicinity.\n\nTwo hours later we were finally seated! We sat at the bar and the seating was very tight. To my right (literally we were touching elbows) was another customer and behind me was another customer sitting at a table.  I had to make sure I didn't move otherwise I would hit all those around me, including my BF! We ordered a dozen of oysters and the cioppino bowl to share. The oysters were super fresh and melted in my mouth. Get these if you like oysters! The cioppino was so flavorful and loaded with fresh and yummy seafood. The broth and garlic bread was legit. Man, I wanted to eat more of that garlic bread. SUPER LEGIT! The bowl was larger than my head! Thank goodness we shared. Even then, we took a lot home because we were unable to finish the meal. \n\nThe service was excellent! The workers were friendly and chatted with us freely. The restaurant is super small and crammed but that's what makes this place special. It was clean, the staff was amazing, and the food was even more amazing. I walked out and told everyone who was outside waiting outside it's worth the two hour wait. The hungry people outside looked relieved :)", "author": "Latda V."}

It was served with two pieces of garlic bread. I ordered half of the soup to go after stuffing myself in the restaurant.

We decided to take a peek in some of thr nearby shops and after about 30 minutes we came back to check our name on the list. We did this 3 times. The last time we came back, our names had been erased and moved to another board. That was fine, except they had written \"gayle\" instead of Genie. So we mentioned this to a waitstaff who then immediately accused us of lying. That there was NEVER a Genie on the board. We insisted that it was, in fact, us. There was no party for \"Gayle\" anywhere around. She reluctantly sat us and then spent the entire meal being rude, short, and unpleasant at about 7. As others were sat around us they were served immediately. We ordered a decent amount of food for the people we had, and yes it was super delicious, but served with that sour attitude spoiled it all.

It wouldn't be the same without it.  \n\nI'm shocked it took me so long to make my way over to Anchor Oyster Bar.  Especially being that clams, oysters, crab, and actually all seafood is one of my favorite things to eat.  It was Valentine's day so they were serving a lot of specials like Lobster Tails, Trout, Sea Bass, along with the regular menu.  But I ordered:\n\nSteamed Shellfish Combination:  it's just a combination of Clams and Mussels in an amazing Garlic Wine Broth.  It's totally worthy of drinking.  Or at least dipping some French bread in.  I felt like the portion could be bigger.  Might have been because it was Valentines day.  Or maybe I'm just a glutton.  But 5 star worthy taste-wise.\n\nService was slow and kind of neglectful.  It is a real bustling little eatery and I recognize that there were a lot of people so I won't  be too hard on them.

I opted for a simple green salad, and he got a bowl of the clam chowder. Though it was sweltering hot (at least for SF standards), we had to have an order of the cioppino. At about $40, the bowl is massive, (I mean, look at the comparison to the fork on the right: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=2TkeL3gvavW5zXxzBuGoDQ#2TkeL3gvavW5zXxzBuGoDQ), so we split it. \n\nIt was deeeelicious! (Thanks for the awesome recommendation, Cherylynn N.!) Though lacking lobster, it was PACKED with mussels, oysters, crab, two jumbo prawns, and poached seabass; the soup also came with pizza slices of garlic bread. When we finally got through the seafood, the broth was tomato-garlic-goodness, which we promptly sopped up with the garlic bread. Note: this is very dangerous because it's SO delicious, you can't stop eating. (Maybe that's just me, though.)\n\nLoved the service, the cozy feel, and the incredibly fair prices.", "author": "Adena B."}

Find parking on the street.  They have bar seats and tables and chairs.  Enough for about 30.  \n\nFor starters, we had a dozen fresh oysters.  There were 3 types that day, but kinda pricey: $2.50 a piece.  I guess I'm used to happy hour prices on oysters!  They don't have a huge selection of raw stuff like Swan Oyster Depot so if you're into fresh raw seafood, you'd probably be more interested in Swan.  But this place is good if you're in the mood for some fresh seafood and sandwiches in a calm environment.\n\nI decided to have the Steamed Clams while husband and friends had that day's special, Crab Burger, which was a fresh cold dungeness crab sandwich with spring mix salad and a cup of clam chowder.  I had my friend's chowder and happily enjoyed it for him.  It was a very good chowder and the texture was just right for me; not too thick, not too watery.

I enjoyed it, but didn't care very much for the broth as all I kept tasting was the herbs since the broth was filled with various types.  I wished it was a white wine broth instead.  Then I would have loved to soak the bread in it,  The crab burger was filled with luscious fresh Dungeness crabmeat.  I love cold crab sandwiches, but I wished they used a better tasting bun.

Definitely come for an early dinner to avoid the line. They are open all day through dinner, with dinner service being switched a little after 5PM. There's a small white board waiting list on the side wall by the door. Make that your first stop before grabbing a seat on the bench (if there are any open). We got there at 4:45PM and there was only one couple that arrived a minute before us, and we still waited 20-30 minutes before a seat opened up for us. \n\nThis place is SMALL. Too small. There's a counter/bar with a handful of seats, and about 6 tables total. I counted only ~23 diners with a crazy line out the door. It isn't particularly fast food or service either, so the turnaround rate for a table is slow.\n\nI had only two things I knew I was going to order for sure: the cioppino and the garlic bread. Surprisingly, the cioppino's not on the menu. It also took a while for our waiter to tend to us and answer some questions. They were switching between lunch and dinner services, and the waiters didn't know what the dinner specials were until the chef posted them on the board.\n\nWe entertained the idea of getting the large bowl of the cioppino, and our server said it was probably doable, but we wouldn't have room for any other food. We wanted the garlic bread for sure, and couldn't decide between the shellfish selection. Good thing we held off, too, bc the small cioppino and the garlic bread were more than enough. The basket of garlic bread was massive. It's practically a whole loaf of cheesy bread. It was addicting and was like a pizza. The cioppino came with four small slices of garlic bread, too, but with less cheese. The soup was thicker than I expected, and there was so much seafood! This place is not shy with their garlic either. There was probably a whole cup of garlic slivers in the soup. Every spoonful there were at least 2-3 slices. They were awesome and not garlicky at all. But don't be surprised if you're burping up garlic hours later.\n \nThe small bowl of cioppino was $30 and the large was $50 I think?

It was a Sunday and we didn't have to wait too long at 2pm if you are open to sitting at the bar.  There were folks who had to wait a lot longer for a table.  The bathroom is tucked away in the back and have to walk through the kitchen and I'm glad of that because I realize how passionate their cooks are.  You can tell they cook each dish with care and made fresh to order!\n\nThey had one dedicated wait staff who took care of drinks and busing tables and one who took orders and serving.  They were both pretty good - well deserved of a tip past the 15%.  \n\nMy friend and I ordered the half order of the Anchor special which comes with 6 oysters (2 of three types) and a pair of shrimps.  Very fresh and delicious!   They do serve sourdough bread and butter.  They have a specials menu and I ordered the Manhattan Seafood Chowder.  It has a mix of fish, mussels, clams, etc. in a nice hot tomato broth.  Very tasty!  Seasoned perfectly.    I also like that their sodas are served with a slushy type ice vs. the cubes.  \n\nGreat place and I would come back with family or friends.", "author": "Neville B."}

It's just up castro from Castro and Market street. Anchor is a very small spot with exquisite seafood, so there is frequently a wait. They have a dry erase board, you walk up, write your name, then have a seat on the couch lit by a blue light. On the few occasions i had a longer than 30 minute wait, they brought out small samples of clam chowder or shrimp cocktail, which was super nice. \nOnce you get inside, you are welcomed by fantastic service and clean, sea side themed decor. I really love the way this place feels, very casual yet very refined. My favorite things to get here: Anchor has, in my opinion, the best clam chowder in SF. Of course you must get oysters, which i love getting with a glass of sparkling laurent perrier to wash them down. They also offer a changing menu of seasonal seafood dishes.\nThe bar seating is comfortable, and even the fact that you must walk through the kitchen (look out for flaming pans!) to get to the tiny bathroom, is rather charming. It's an opportunity to see how impeccably tidy the kitchen is.\nI bring all my new friends here, and i recommend Anchor to anyone visiting SF who wants to try seafood done the way that most pleases locals like me.", "author": "Iliea S."}

Went there for dinner and ordered the anchor special, garlic bread, clam chowder, and cioppino. \n\nGarlic bread: crusty and crunchy, soft in the middle with lots of butter and cheese. I dipped it in EVERYTHING!  (Clam sauce, chowder, cioppino). \n\nAnchor special: came with 3 different oysters, we really liked 1 type, ate all of them and forgot which ones were which. Our waitresses went thru all the shells to help us figure out our fave so we could order more! It said 8 clams... We got wayyy more than that, and they came in a white wine sauce which was my #1 dipping sauce choice! I took the left over sauce home, yummy.\n\nClam chowder: not the best, especially compared to everything else I was eating.\n\nCioppino: Omggggg... Really?!? I hate tomato sauce but this shit was bombbbbbb! Fresh lump crab, white fish... Ughhh I was so stuffed by the time this came around I couldn't eat very much. Dip your bread in here, it's like a pizza!

I still don't understand how one person can consume the whole portion of Cioppino.. service was super, they always put customers first and make sure we're taken care of at all times.\n\nAll in all, Anchor Oyster Bar is a great place to take anyone for any occasion if you're looking for affordable seafood with high quality in an unpretentious environment.

We picked a table at the middle of the restaurant and were asked for our drink orders 4 times by 3 people in a span of a couple minutes. Nothing wrong with attentive service, but our server comes back and tells us he needs to wipe down the table (to remove visible sauce spills) Strange since they had just opened; wouldn't you expect everything to be clean and in order? Quickly skimming yelp, we ordered a feast for two. \n\n* Garlic Bread - pizza pringles, cheesy bread and garlic all in one. This was delicious and you were given alot. \n* Oysters - The Cape Cod Oysters were a bit bland, but get the Hog Islands. $2.50 a piece for yumminess. \n* Clam Chowder - Not too creamy with just the right amount of seasoning and ingredients. I do wish there were more clam chunks but still tasty. \n* Crab Cakes - We were skeptical because you only got 2 pieces for about $13 but went for it anyways. Huge disappointment. Maybe the kitchen wasn't on par but these crab cakes were tiny and completely burnt on one side. I tasted more burnt crust than crab. Don't waste your money ordering this. \n\nAnchor Oyster Bar is a pretty small restaurant so if you have come with a group of 4+ you'll have to sit at the bar. Our total came out to around $50, which isn't bad; just the crab cakes really weren't worth it and we left a bit disappointed and feeling ripped off. I'll be back again for the cheesy bread and oysters once I'm over this first time.\n\n- jenn", "author": "Jenn Y."}

I was supper excited to come in but left irritated and disappointed. I started with  two each of the oysters . Two of them had a decent amount of chipped shell. One in which had 1/3 of the shell missing... still ate it... wish me luck. Once the sever was finally done catching up with some regulars I ordered the board special. As the sever rang it in I could over hear kitchen staff cheer that they are 86'd Sole and they can finally can take it off the board. How long has it been in house? The sole took 20-30 mins and they were not busy. I am a patient person but that got me irritated. For a lunch I was about ready to walk out and pay the bill but I was so committed to eating there. Asked the support staff two time and said it was coming... finally a 3 burnt pieces of breaded sole. It was so thin I was like how can you mess that up. 30 seconds in the frier and it would have been perfect but left it in to long. I accepted the dish and moved on to the vegetables. The broccoli taste like it just came out of the Napa fire. It wasn't a nice smoky or charred flavor. It was unbearable! Luckily, I had a lagunitas to slam it back. Never finished the plate. Paid the bill and left. I left so disappointed living. 50 bucks later I found myself eating sushi across the way at Osaka. The sushi was platted two minutes after I order which had the same amount of covers. I'm not Writing this place off but stick to the classics and I won't be back for awhile.", "author": "Adam L."}

We got out of the cab and were greeted by rainbow flags, I already knew it was a cool neighborhood from there.  \n\nWe walked a block or so to the restaurant.  And by the grace of all things culinarily awesome, we were swept inside for seats at the cozy bar, without the lengthy weight bestowed upon larger parties.  The inside is cozy, that is the only way to describe it - why is it that some of the best restaurants can only serve a small finite number of folks at a time?  I don't judge, but just wonder.  \n\nThe couple we sat next to were super nice to us, and by the time I got my bubbly and my Boston clam chowder, I was already swimming amongst good feelings.  The chowder was the perfect consistency, the right amount of sea, perfect flavor profile - and they have fresh ground pepper and a basket of oyster crackers (instead of giving me a measly bag of 5).  I had Kumamoto oysters as my entree, that was all I needed.  Sea briny deliciousness with a lovely mignette.  My husband had the shrimp cocktail dinner salad and was thoroughly satisfied.

Arrived here on a Thursday night at 7:30pm, and the place was packed. Not difficult to do, considering how tiny this place is. We settled in for the wait and after 45 minutes, the uncontrollable HANGRY-ness in me started to come out. Luckily, the attentive staff & kitchen noticed the antsyness outside, and offered all of us waiting a shrimp cocktail sample. Free food = I'LL STAY. \n\nNow for the fooood:\nOysters on the half shell - good variety. Boyfriend loved the Flapjacks from Washington. I don't usually like the oceany taste of oysters, but these were so fresh, I couldn't stop eating them. \nCrab cakes - that dipping/tartar sauce is straight crack. I'd eat it by itself. \nGarlic bread - good bang for your buck! One order is enough for 3-4 people. Probably didn't need to order this since the cioppino came with 2 pieces.\nCioppino - the 1 person serving was enough for two. Best part was the chunks of crab. YUMMM!  \n\nGreat staff & service.

The clam chowder taste way better than anything pier 39 can offer. The Cioppino is probably the best I had compared to many other places I tried.

You will wait to be seated. The place is small and does not take reservations.\n2. It is worth the wait! Your experience is about food here and it will quickly become a favorite.\n3. Service can be a bit slow. Not because they aren't paying attention, again the place is small with a tiny kitchen and they can only have a few staff members working at a time so it might not be as rapid as you hope but the service is outstanding and the people are kind and working very hard.\n4. Order the Cioppino! It isn't on the menu but I will say it is the best you will ever have.\n5. The line out front is long....again....worth the wait!\n6. Feel free to speak to the chef in back. they are all very nice and occasionally you will get to meet the owner who is warm, gracious and (of course) an amazing chef!\n7. don't rush your meal. Enjoy the time you are there and your meal. it is a cozy and intimate place perfect for a date or an evening with mom and dad. My mom and dad insist on going to visit the owner and take home food.\n8. the take out is just as good as the dine in. We often opt. to take a meal home.\n9. Be patient and polite. Again...small place and staff is doing everything they can.\n10. Last and far from least, look at the specials menu, it changes everyday and offers unique selections daily. If you don't see it....ask. They are always willing to make you something if they have it in the kitchen.\nI hope these simple details will help you to enjoy one of our favorite places in San Francisco.", "author": "Tyler S."}

In my opinion, it's what makes a bowl of steamed clams amazing. The broth here was not as flavorful as I would've liked but still above average.\n-Clam chowder - Based on Yelp reviews, I expected this to blow my mind but it didn't as it needed a bit more flavor. It was pretty good though. Creamy, rich, salty, clammy.\n\nService: It's not a fancy place so the service is casual, friendly, efficient. \n\nWait: Expect it. It's a pretty small cozy place.

Start with the clam chowder. Don't doubt me. Don't think. Get it. Eat it. Slurp it. Savor it. Ask for oyster crackers. Take a second to breathe. Get back in there and finish the soup. It's *that* good. Now, for your main, don't do what I did. I ordered the crab burger. It was on special and it made me think of SpongeBob SquarePants. So, I was in. Don't get me wrong, it was a tasty burger; simple, but tasty. Dungeness crab, lettuce, tomato, and tartar sauce (to bind) on a sesame bun. That's it. No sides. Simple. But I should have aimed higher. At my table, my friends lost their minds with the pasta, the crab cakes and the fresh fish. Stealing a bite here and there, I agreed.

GARLIC BREAD.\n\nIf you were looking for what to order, now you know. \n\nIf you want to hear a little more, read on.\n\nFirst of all, this place is SMALL. So if you're going at peak dining times, don't. Unless you're willing to wait an hour or more. Go an hour before the rush if possible. Also, I noticed that the demographic of diners eating here was generally 50+. These people like to eat early so be sure to take that into account. We came around 5pm and didn't have to wait, but apparently they were short-handed or something that night because we still had to wait 30 minutes AFTER we were seated before they took our order. It then took another half hour for our food to come out. And the order in which it came out was odd...\n\nThe entrees came out first and so we ended up cancelling the clam chowders and garlic bread that we had ordered as appetizers. Luckily, the head waiter (perhaps the owner?) came to our table and apologized for the unusual wait and promptly comped our chowders and garlic bread. It was a nice gesture to be sure, one that probably bumped this review up to a 4.\n\nAnyway, about the food. I consider myself an amateur cioppino aficionado. It's basically a medley of seafood (fresh fish, shrimp, mussels, calimari, and scallops) served in a hot tomato-y broth. It's delicious. The BEST cioppino I ever had was at delmonico's on fisherman's wharf in monterey...but this dish can definitely hold its ground. The fish was very fresh and the seafood was good. The broth was a bit too strong for my taste...more of a tomato bisque than a broth, but it was good nonetheless.\n\nThe clam chowder was good too. Not too strong and not fishy at all. Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan, but my fiancee and my other friend (both girls) LOVED it. So maybe girls should get it?\n\nOysters were surprisingly good as well. I don't consider myself an oysterman by any stretch of the imagination, but these were...tolerable.\n\nAnd finally the garlic bread...or should I say garlic manna from heaven. It was...the bomb. Possibly the best garlic bread I've ever had. You HAVE to get it if you come here.\n\nAll in all, this place would have been borderline 5 stars had the service been timelier, but because they did their genuine best to make up for it, I'll settle for a 4.", "author": "Jon K."}

After an hour drive on a Sunday night, I scored VIP parking right in front of the restaurant!  I walked in and there was an empty table calling my name.  Scored... no wait.\n\nI started with the soju oyster shooters.  It was delicious!  There was just enough alcohol for me to feel a little tingly.  By the way, I'm a lightweight.\n\nThe clam chowder was good, not too rich and creamy and definitely made fresh with just enough potatoes and clams.  Don't forget to add the oyster crackers for an extra crunch.\n\nThis time around, I decided to get the steamed seafood combo.  It was good, but not as good as the steamed clams by itself.  The combo consisted of clams, mussels, green lip mussels, and shrimp.   I'm not a big fan of mussels but I thought I would give it a try.  The broth was nice and light with aromatics such as thyme, basil, lemon, and garlic.  The toasted garlic bread was definitely a good way to sop up the natural sweetness of the shellfish broth.  After I finished the bread, I just got a spoon and dug right into the bowl.  \n\nThe Mexican Corvina sea bass was another hit.  After the oyster shooters, clam chowder, steamed shellfish, and garlic bread, I was concerned that I had ordered too much food.  Thankfully, the sea bass was a very light dish.  It was more like a salad.  The sea bass was lightly fried with a nice crispy edge on a bed of lightly dressed spinach.  There were roasted carrots and fingerling potatoes. What tied the whole dish together was the fried garlic bits.  I love texture in my food, so the crispy garlic was a nice bonus.\n\nAnchor Oyster Bar is a great place for fresh seafood.  It's a small, quaint place with eight seats at the bar, three tables that seat four, and two tables that seat three.  Come here and enjoy some seafood with a glass of wine for a relaxing meal.

We got 43 clams! \n\nYou  might be wondering why I didn't get the cioppino, that's because I don't eat oysters or mussels. So yeah, I probably missed out. \n\nI recommend you bring your young children, especially those who think throwing rocks at their parents is okay and opening and closing the door on a cold San Francisco night because people definitely can use a big fat gush of fresh cold air during their meal.\n\nI highly recommend you and your friends to come here (not in a large group of course).", "author": "Jess W."}

All seafood (no potato or pasta filler like some area restaurants) with a delicate yet complex tomato broth and amazing hearty garlic bread for savoring.

Needless to say, I'm a repeat offender. I repeat offend seafood restaurants that I know and have grown to love. Enter...Anchor Oyster Bar. I don't live in the neighborhood but I will gladly get out of bed, get in my car, roam around for parking, just to have a meal here. I've been here many times (no idea how I even forgot to review the place) and I've never been disappointed with my meal. \n\nLast weekend my coworkers and I decided to come for dinner. We were greeted and seated immediately. The waitstaff are always so friendly and personable. I'm pretty sure they think I'm this weird crazy stalker lady since I'm there all the time. I just love me some oysters. There is bar seating with ample tables. It is VERY popular so come early if you want to avoid any waiting. The decor is simple, not overdone or tacky. It has always looked clean every time I have visited. \n\nAnyway, we enjoyed the clam chowder (so good on a chilly day), shrimp salad and the half order of the Anchor special (oysters, steamed clams, and chilled prawns). Yum. It is by far my favorite plate on the menu. We also shared some of the crab, which was surprisingly very tasty. I hardly ever get crab outside of Asian restaurants (its just the Asian in me) but I really liked Anchor's crab. My coworker has the crab cakes as an entree and she mentioned that she loved it. It was cooked to perfection, not soggy or mealy. She described it as \"just like how they make them on the Food Network.\" Whatever that means. \n\nI'm always here. So there is no point in telling you that I will come back. But I highly suggest checking them out. Great food, awesome service, clean and inviting atmosphere.

Huge portions. \n\nThis was actually our second trip to Anchor, as I had visited here previously a few years ago. Imagine the wife and I's surprise when friends recommended we all go to this place! As the name of the restaurant suggests, it was mostly the thought of fresh pacific oysters that drew us back. Of the various places that have very good oysters we know of in SF, this was the one that was open in the evening.\n\nAnd indeed, the oysters were beautiful, local fresh and paired with great delicate mignonette sauce as well as the traditional horseradish (both of which we used sparingly so as not to cover the taste of the mollusk). We ordered two varieties from different areas, and they were indeed distinct from one another in taste and brine and the waiter had represented each perfectly when we asked prior to ordering.\n\nDid I mention that the service is very friendly and attentive -- despite the fact that the restaurant was packed with customers. This brings me to a word of warning: Anchor is TINY, so get here right as they open (about 5:30) if you don't want a crazy wait.\n\nInside, the decor is intimate and charming, and features an open kitchen which inspires confidence in the cooks handling your fish. On our prior visit, the chef owner was there and quite friendly.\n\nI had a seafood pasta in a garlic cream sauce and it was great; I was asked if I wanted a variety of seafood or prawns, and I chose the prawns. When it arrived it was generous within the dish, and the portion was monstrously large. My wife had the river trout special, and the fish was fresh and perfectly prepared.

Don't even think about going in there with a party of 20 because you'll have to book the entire restaurant. haha.\n\nHeres a helpful tip:\nThe host tends to come outside and do a \"check\" on who is waiting. Don't let this deter you from leaving. We literally stood outside for the full 1.75hrs waiting for our table...and others who left and came back before they were called got to get seated before us because they \"checked-in\" before us.\nTHEREFORE......go ahead and write your name...walk across the street to the wine bar...and have a good time there for an hour or so, then come back. What you can also do is tell the host that you'll be going across the street for some wine and desert. I literally watched him run across the street to the other bar to tell someone that their table is read (Maybe they're regulars? not sure...)\n\nAnyway...the food was amazing. Don't know if i'll ever be down to wait for 2 hours again....\n\nWe got the cippino (sp?). It seems to be the most highly recommended dish. It comes packed with fish, crab, huge mussels, clam, prawns, and the soup that its cooked in is  mouth watering.\n\nWe also got the \"anchor special\", which is a dozen raw oysters, fat prawns, and some garlic butter clams. This is definitely worth it too. \n\nWARNING: DONT FILL YOURSELF UP WITH THE FREE BREAD!!! ORDER THE GARLIC BREAD. *droooools*\n\nAnyhoo....the service was outstanding.

(You don't really see that these days). We decided to order a bowl of clam chowder for my friend, half order of the seafood combination, and a full order of the Cioppino. When the clam chowder came out, instead of giving us 1 bowl, the server/manager decided to give us 3 small bowls, one for each of us! SO SWEET! The clam chowder was a great way to start our meal bc it was soo warm and filled with yummy clams and potatoes. It was one of the best clam chowders I've had in the city.\n\nWhen the seafood combination came out (6 oysters, 2 prawns and a bowl of clams in a garlic/wine/rosemary/butter broth) the server/manager gave us an extra prawn so that each one of us had one to ourselves. HOW SWEET IS THAT?? I've never experienced such great and considerate service as I have with the staff at Anchor Oyster Bar. The clams in the garlic/wine/rosemary/butter broth was AMAZING!!!! I've never tasted a broth SO DELICIOUS!

The only negative thing I could say is I wish there were more clams in it.  I don't like to have to \"fish\" for clams in my chowder.  But other than that, it was a really tasty chowder.

I'd give it a 3.5 stars, and bump up cause there was no glaring bad stuff. \n\nCame here on a weekday, and waited a mere hour to get in. We failed because we were the 4th large group to wait - there's only 3 tables for groups of 4. We were a group of 5 and there's really only one table for that size. Umm..I'd suggest coming as a group of 2. The waiters were nice and tried to serve as quickly as possible. It was a little strange though, that we were waiting and the guy came out to tell a group of 4 white chicks that if we weren't here waiting they were next. Umm...if you look around, you can clearly see we were a group of 5 people who were waiting. Oh, well. At least we were seated before them.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nPasta of the day (Panchetta seafood penne): It was good! The panchetta wasn't very evenly spaced, but you had light hints of it. There was probably a slab of panchetta in each of the dishes. There was a crispy garlic thing on it which was yummy.\n\nClams in sauce: Either we were hungry, or this is delicious. The sauce was decent (not the BEST, but it's yummy).\n\nClam Chowder: I have learned a cup of clam chowder is never enough. Always go for a bowl. The chowder was decent, but there was nothing very unique about it. There was a fair amount of clam chunks in there, which I appreciated.\n\nGreen Mussels: Also yummy - similar sauce to the clams, but with some tomatoes. Yummy...\n\nGarlic Prawns with roasted veg: This was probably my least favorite dish. I like my veg, and speared a broccoli for myself...which was kind of burnt. I tasted a carrot later, which was still burnt. We probably should have requested a change in it, but the shrimp was fine...so I guess when they roasted the veg, they over roasted?\n\nService was pretty good. They had about 3-4 servers for a restaurant fit for about 30 people max, so the servers were really attentive. Pretty nice, actually!", "author": "Lily W."}

I wondered what it was like to be inside rather than on the outside peering in, rubbing my empty stomach and hoping someone would throw a half-eaten crab leg my way. Oh who am I kidding? I just don't like crowds. But last Monday, I saw my opening. I was in a good mood because I bought a nice Briggs & Riley bag at Michael Bruno and entered the place with my head held high.\n\nMan, it's small in there. Tables are not an option for singularly-minded diners. I went straight for the counter where I saw three stools empty. I naturally sat in the middle hoping another couple would not come in. I don't mind voluntarily sliding to the next stool if I see it would accommodate a happy couple. I just hate it when they automatically say - \"Well, if Fatso would move, we could all be happy.\" That's a true story that happened in a New York luncheonette. But no such invectives came my way this evening, and the serving staff was nice as can be in accommodating my first-time visit there.\n\nI took a quick look at the menu and a much longer one at the handwritten menu overhead. It took me a while to read not because I am dyslexic but because the penmanship was marginal. They need Mr. Chalkboard Guy or whoever does the perfectly lined Squat & Gobble-Crepevine-SoMa Inn chalkboard menus. I went for a $4.25 cup of Clam Chowder, a house specialty (see my photo). Probably because I'm the type who would think nothing of putting heavy cream into a saucepan of Progresso's New England-Style Clam Chowder, I just thought it was on the watery side. True, the clams were fresh, but the consistency brought out my tendency to splash the soup onto my shirt.\n\nBetter was the $22.95 San Pedro California Striped Bass - pan-seared and served with a risotto mixed with some toasted pinenuts and thyme (see my photo). They served grilled asparagus, a perfect complement to a well-done, hearty slab of fish - though I still think there was a tad too much cornstarch in the risotto (you could almost stand a fork in it). The meal was quite satisfying, just not quite the wowee-wow I was led to believe it would be. And I never did have to move my seat. I'd come back since the mystery is gone, as I really want to try the cioppino next time. Maybe I can even sit at a table, too.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good fish, watery chowder, all fresh\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...very white and very compact...kinda like Dakota Fanning\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...yes, stellar...both the young guy with the nice smile and the guy who's been there for centuries\nTOTAL - 4 stars...neither up to the hype or down with the bottom-feeders...even if the Castro is the land of the bottom-feeders (ba-bump-bump)", "author": "Ed U."}

Under regular circumstances I would give this place a 3*, but if I do just that, I won't be able to make a statement. \n\nI rate restaurants based on the entire experience from food, ambiance all the way to its service quality. \n\nIf we're talking about just food, like all other reviewers, I agree they have probably one of the best and most addicting seafood soup I ever had in my life. Everyone gets it who go there. Just ask for their signature seafood soup. \n\nSo you're probably asking why the 1 star?\n\nTheir service quality is simply awful to the 1 millionth power. If it wasn't for chef patty, who was probably the only nice person there, it would be awful to the 2 millionth power. \n\nThey probably have one of THE SLOWEST service speed I have ever experienced in my life. To set up one table with 5 sets of service plates and utensils, it took them 20 minutes. That is ridiculous considering they only have 10 tables total in the entire restaurant. Once we sat down, we were hoping things would be better. The next thing we knew, we were greeted poorly by a grumpy server. The entire meal probably took 1.5 hour, when we only ordered 2 or 3 dishes. I won't lie, we enjoyed the food. But when we were done, we wanted to get out of there ASAP. But guess what!, they wouldn't even let us do that.... We called for the check...30 minutes later, we were still staring at each other twiddling our thumbs. I mean seriously, does it take 30 minutes for us to get a simple check????\n\nOn top of that, when we asked for to-go on our seafood SOUP, they packed everything EXCEPT the SOUP. Are you kidding me? I asked you to get my soup togo, but you didn't give me any soup...Seriously???\n\nThis restaurant seriously needs some help with staffing and service training.

I asked my brother to look up a place (since i still do not own a smart phone) and he redirected us here. \n\nFor starters we had the house special FRIED OYSTERS which is what everybody raves about. They. Were. Amazing. I recently became a fan of charboiled oysters (I HATE the texture and taste of regular raw oysters), and these fried oysters were GREAT!! Then for entrees we ordered the special for the day which is a DUNGEONNESS CRAB stuffed with SOLE FISH and mashed potatoes. I've been wanting to try the dungeonness crab for forever, as it is not an east coast delicacy so I was incredibly excited to try it!! and just let me tell you, it lived up to my expectations and more!

It's a soupy seafood extravanganza. \n\nOk. To be honest, the first bite of the garlic bread is very par.

You put your name, party quantity, and time of arrival at this white board outside, and you can wait in the seats for them to come get you when there's a space available. The area is super COZY and quaint with cute decorations. The bathroom is super cute, organized, and pretty! It's tucked back into a little corner behind the kitchen.\nThe kitchen is kind of in an open space behind  a circular open window thing in the back, but you can definitely see them preparing your food.

MMmmmm, I'm an oyster fanatic so I know and have tried majority of the oysters. Comming from OC, whenever I think of the bay area, I think of seafood! So we got the sampler, it was mmmm good! I'm a year behind on this review so I can't recall the five oysters included in our sampler but, I do rememeber the Kushi! That one is the best one : ) It's small and slightly sweet. The garlic bread was also reallly goood.\n\nI took off a star because they don't have the bombay Gold Band oysters from the Gulf of Mexico. It's probably a seasonal reason but anyways, OMG, I hope they supply them so you guys can try and enjoy it too! They are round, plumpy, sweet and a little chewy....sooo bombbb! When it comes to oysters, usually the small ones are the good ones but, that sucks because that's a terrible teaser but, with the Gold Band, you're in luck! They're not the biggest but, bigger than average. They're called Gold Band and are unique because they remain fresh throughout the patented High Pressure Processing (HPP) system which shucks the oysters (non-hand) without removing the nutrients. So look out for them! They are super special little guys. \n\nFor reference: I'm from way out of town so my perspective might be different than yours, if you're a local. Shop is extremely small but, cozy restaurant. It's perfect for a little date. It's a popular little place so the line was pretty long. But, other than that, the service was great. I had a good time, I enjoyed it though it was cold and we waited an hour in line and half was outside, in the cold so you might want to bring a jacket.

But there was one flaw: it was flavored with an off-tasting oil that I did NOT like at all. My dinner companion didn't have the same reaction, so it might be just the way I taste things.\n\nI like the flavor of extra-virgin olive oil when it tastes like olives; \"earthy\" tasting or infused olive oils with some herbs can ruin a good thing. I asked what the oil on the main course was and was told it was lemon, but it tasted more like cilantro (which I dislike) or some other herb. In any case, I think my dinner would have been nearly perfect if the oil drizzled thereon had been good olive oil without any cloying infusions that nearly wrecked the excellent fresh veggies under the tuna.\n\nService was very friendly and efficient, and aside from being jammed into a small space, it was generally comfortable.

We pretty much beat the rush, because when we looked outside during our meal, there was a huge line outside! Score!\n\nWe went with the off-the-menu ciopinno, a dozen oysters, a bowl of clam chowder, a combo seafood cocktail, a garlic roasted crab, and a crab caesar salad. Everything is prepared fresh and they have a pretty teenie-tiny kitchen, so the food takes some time to come out. Be patient though, because it's all worth it!\n\nThe ciopinno (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=lLfbLtUo6anjlZA0T3-LBg#lLfbLtUo6anjlZA0T3-LBg) was a tomato-based soup/stew that was pretty good and hearty. It came with a variety of seafood, that included fish, mussels, clams, and crab. It also came with some mighty cheesy garlic bread. I'm typically not a fan of tomato-based dishes, but this one was not too bad. Dipping the garlic bread into the soup/stew was the best part! The raw oysters (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=NDrVOKHe7AQR-YCQ603oIw#NDrVOKHe7AQR-YCQ603oIw) for the day included Washington Chelseas and Pacifics. Both were very fresh and came with a cocktail sauce and a vinegar based wash. They even gave us an extra oyster so that each of us would be able to have five! The clam chowder was delicious--not too chunky, not too watery, and had good flavor. Our waiter was aware that we were sharing everything, so without us even having to ask, he split up the bowl into five smaller bowls for us to share! That's what you call diligent customer service! \n\nThe combo seafood cocktail (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=60hxPakGzuwCvAUffzondw#60hxPakGzuwCvAUffzondw) included tons of crab meat and shrimp. It was a simple cocktail, but great since it was so fresh. My favorites from our meal were the garlic roasted crab (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=0J6aG8CJDkAIKs7KxxhbGQ#0J6aG8CJDkAIKs7KxxhbGQ) and the crab caesar salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/anchor-oyster-bar-san-francisco?select=kerBcpAuJuTFguvYUU2_dw#kerBcpAuJuTFguvYUU2_dw). The garlic roasted crab was prepared in a delicious buttery garlicky sauce that didn't overwhelm the natural sweetness of the crab. The crab caesar salad was absolutely delicious. I've never had seafood with a caesar salad before, and surprisingly the crab meat went perfectly with the peppery caesar dressing. I enjoyed the caesar salad a lot; so much that I was pretty sad that I had to share with my friends. Ha!", "author": "Lien T."}

The waiter was very nice though and came to update us every so often on how long the wait was going to be. We were probably the second to last table being seated.\n\nWe finally get seated and we order garlic bread and I get the crab cake entree (I love crab cakes) while my friend orders something off the special menu and I can't recall what it was. The garlic bread was pretty damn amazing; a generous coating of garlic butter and cheese. The only downside was that some of the pieces were overly charred, almost burnt but there were so many, I just ate around it and it's just worth it LOL.\n\nThe clam chowder that came as an option with my crab cake entree was pretty darn good. Throughout the eating it, I was expecting to bite into sand but that didn't happen which was very surprising to me. I know, it's not supposed to be there but it's kind of one of those things that I just come to expect when it comes to clam chowder. The crab cake, unfortunately, was a tad underwhelming after eating both the chowder and garlic bread (but they were pretty hard to beat). I felt like that the crab cakes had a bit too much filler and not enough crab and just texturally, felt very one dimensional. It wasn't bad by any means, I was just expecting them to really nail it on the head and make it better than anywhere else but I suppose my expectations were also a tad high. Regardless though, the crab cakes were still delicious.\n\nOver all, I definitely see myself coming back.

The restaurant was thoughtfully decorated and even the small bathroom was super cute!!! (note the light switch with the little fish on the side... )\n\n- Mini bottles of Laurent Perrier champagne comes in their own little ice buckets ($14).. sooo cute and such at such a good deal*\n\n- Oysters are highly recommended. Really some of the BEST in the Bay.\n\n- Bay Shrimp Louis salad. YUM!\n\n- Seasonal Dungeness crab: Both chilled (with butter sauce) &* roasted garlic were amazing.\n\n- Cioppino * .. Trust me. this is the BEST I've had so far in the city.. must dip the freshly baked garlic bread in it and pair it with a glass of Malbec or Cabernet savignon.. (A meal on its own!)\n\n\n3) Super friendly and efficient service: 5 star*s to Chef Patty and our server Mike - Both AMAZING people!\n\n4) Good crowd: Love how Anchor Oyster doesn't over pack the restaurant like a sardine can.

Granted there are only about 6 tables and about 8 bar seats, so it doesn't take much for that place to get packed.  It was raining and cold, and our return on our time invested waiting in line there wasn't looking good even though there were only four groups before us.  Some mysterious people showed up and got to skip the sign in and the line and everything, which upset a lot of us--so much so that one of the guys actually went in there and confronted the people to let them know everyone was displeased.  I'm not sure if that's just the policy of the owner to do that, but we weren't too excited about the other people's preferential treatment...hence the minus one star.\n\nOnce we finally got into the place about 8:30pm (the people eating there didn't seem to want to leave even when they had no food in front of them after their meal), we ordered the half appetizer platter (6 oysters, 2 jumbo shrimp, and half order of clams), the artichoke appetizer, the pumpkin ravioli with dungeness crab, and the alaskan true cod.\n\nAppetizer Platter:  The oysters (two of each type of oyster they had) were fabulous...not too big, but bursting with flavor and very fresh.  The shrimp were huge and fresh.  The clams were delicious and we needed to ask for more bread to soak up the incredible chili garlic \"soup\" they were prepared in.\n\nArtichoke:  It was well prepared and very tasty, but was really overshadowed by all the rest of the food.  If i had to choose, i'd probably have skimped on this appetizer to enjoy the rest of the stuff more.\n\nAlaskan True Cod:  Lightly breaded, perfectly cooked and just slightly on the meaty side as far as texture...yum!  The only downside was that i felt there was a little too much rosemary on the fish that kind of made it a little too herbally for me.  The potatoes were delicious as  well and it came with some grilled veggies to compliment the dish.\n\nPumpkin Ravioli with Dungeness Crab:  Truly the highlight of the evening.  I was a little skeptical at first when we ordered it, but the ravioli was so fresh (hand made that day), the pumpkin was incredibly flavorful, and the huge mound of dungeness crab didn't hamper the dish either!\n\nIn the end, we left very satisfied and stuffed to the brim with one of the best seafood meals i've had in a LONG time...don't take my word for it...try it out =)\n\nHappy Eating!", "author": "Bradley H."}

After more than one foiled attempts to try this place (came once to find the entire joint closed for a week for cleaning), a couple weeks ago I finally made it into the promised land, but not after waiting over an hour in the freezing cold.  No really.  We arrived at about 4:45, figuring the wait couldn't be that bad, given the place opens at 4:00, and who eats dinner at 4:00 aside from really old people?  We were wrong.  I guess you have to get here before opening and then rush to get a spot.  There was a group that got here at 4:00 and must have missed the first cattle/seating call.  And they were pissed and getting testy (see most recent one star review) and swearing at the hostess and in general disbelief that they could be waiting for more than an hour and a half and still not be entitled to a table (as though the restaurant was being totally unreasonable for having a first come first seated policy, which is how most restaurants work).  Anyway.  The wait was made somewhat more tolerable by the free chowder cups they brought out (saw them bringing out garlic bread later in the night when we were already seated).  When we were finally let in the pearly gates, we were shown to a neatly set table with a plate of bread ready and waiting (which we promptly devoured).  When inside, I could see how truly tiny this place is.  I counted 26 seats.  8 stools at the bar, three 4 tops, and 2 two tops that had an extra chair added for a third person.  But who cares?  Let's eat.  The menu is pretty simple.  They had some specials on the white board behind the counter.  They looked good, but I already knew what I wanted, considering I had been scrutinizing the menu the whole time I had been outside.  We ordered a salad with shrimp, clam chowder, mixed shellfish, and black mussels.  FYI, portions here are pretty big.  I really enjoyed the shrimp salad, which was quite generous with the shrimp.  The chowder was good, not the best I've had, but very inviting after a long wait in the cold.  Finally, both shellfish platters seemed to have enough seafood to feed an army.  They had different broths, which was nice, or we would have had two plates of mostly the same thing.  Of the two, I preferred the mixed shellfish, which had both black and green mussels, clams, and shrimp.  I preferred the taste of the broth also, which was like a classic meuniere while the other broth had more tomato flavor.  They were also very generous in bringing out extra bread for soaking up the broth.  Also, the nice lady gave us some free garlic bread to try.  Gotta say, it was melt in your mouth delicious and I wish I'd gotten a whole order. Overall, the food was highly satisfying, the service was warm and friendly, and the place had a great cozy vibe.

We ordered a half dozen and our server described where each oyster was from. I wish we were given the choice, because I think we all preferred the oysters from Canada, as opposed to the locally grown (the locally grown were large, but we preferred the sweetness of the other oysters). \n\nBuckets of oyster crackers lined the side of the restaurant, and there was another heaping basket of crackers on each table. This is a hint to order the clam chowder. Clam chowder was delicious, and was hearty, but could have used more clams.\n\nWe ordered clams and mussels for the table. The clams were delicious! And the broth was heavenly. We must have asked for extra bread 4 or 5 times to dip into the garlic/wine broth that the clams were bathing in. However, the mussels.... ick. I love mussels, but these tasted weird, and I had a sick feeling in my stomach after eating a couple. \n\nI ordered the pasta special. YUM!!!! The tomatoes and pasta absorbed the seafood flavors beautifully. Though it was a very large portion, I did not feel overstuffed after eating a majority of it. Such a satisfying feeling :)\n\nOthers at the table had the Petrole (YUM!), crabcakes (flaky and not dry), and mussels. The portions were large for all of the servings.\n\nOverall a good meal, and great service. However, the mussels really soured the experience for me.

The wait list was 2 hours long, but I slid in at the bar after 30 minutes - perks of dining solo! Discovered it was well worth the wait. Friendly service was the first thing I noticed. The oysters were the freshest I have tasted in recent memory. I especially loved their shallot-vinegar sauce that complimented the flavor of the wellfleets. I read such great things in the yelp reviews that I took the liberty of ordering everything that looked interesting. Clam chowder = phenomenal. Steamed shellfish combo = delicious, savory broth and a huge portion of fish!  I was craving garlic crab ( which was the reason for going) and it was also great, but I liked all the other \"appetizer-entrees\" more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-03", "description": "Some friends and I headed off to spend the evening in SF, with the intention of finally trying out Ike's Place.  Unfortunately due to traffic and some not-so-thorough planning, by the time we actually arrived in SF it was past closing time and a back up had to be found!\n\nSo I jumped on my handy dandy smart phone and immediately turned to Yelp for an answer.  Anchor Oyster Bar popped up as being one of the most highly rated restaurants in Castro.  We reprogrammed Suzy (my most beloved GPS) and headed off.  \n\nThe restaurant is very small and cozy.  My group actually walked right past it while we were looking for it because it was so small, and had to ask for directions from a shop owner.  There were probably about 8 tables or so, with only 3 tables being devoted to larger groups.  The smaller tables seated 2 or 3 people, and my party of 4 had to wait for one of the large tables.   We put our names down at 8:30, and didn't get seated till nearly an hour later. \n\n It was a chilly, rainy night, and we were all very pleasantly surprised when one of the servers brought out a tray of individual clam chowder bowls, complete with bags of oyster crackers and \"silver\" plastic forks.  He topped it off by grating fresh pepper into our bowls for us too. These were definitely NOT little itty bitty sample portions either...after I finished mine I probably didn't need to eat anymore.  The chowder was  delicious.  I usually like my chowder to be very hearty and thick, and even though this was a thinner version, it was most definitely not lacking in flavor.  \n\nAfter the chowder, we knew we were staying for the long haul, however long they were going to make us wait.  While sitting outside occasionally patrons would finish and come out, giving us thumbs up and telling us the food was definitely worth the wait.  \n\nAt long last, we were seated.  A plate with a small loaf of  sliced bread and butter was brought out for us to nibble on.  We ordered garlic bread and crab cakes for our appetizers, and then sea bass and steamed mussels in broth for our entrees. The garlic bread was $5 but easily fed all 4 of us.  The portion was huge, and generously sprinkled with cheese, garlic, and herbs. The crab cakes came out and were perfection.  Slightly crisp on the outside, moist on the inside, and served with a tangy tartar sauce that my friend couldn't stop eating (no seriously...after the crab cakes were gone he proceeded to scoop out the sauce and eat it alone).\n\nEntrees were no less spectacular.  The sea bass was mildly seasoned, and cooked just right.  It was served with fingerling potatoes and a vegetable medley.  I think where Anchor Oyster Bar really got this dish right was just in the way they cooked everything.  The flavors were so simple, but they were done just right.  The bass also came with a garlic aioli sauce that again, my friend could not stop eating.  The steamed mussels came with a white wine and garlic broth that was great just to dip the bread into.  \n\nThe service was excellent.  Again, since the restaurant is small, our server was very attentive.  My glass was never more than half empty, and our bread was refilled the second we finished it.  I asked for my sea bass to-go, and he boxed it up, asking if I cared to have some of the sauce on the side (he'd noticed with some amusement how mesmerized we were by the addicting sauces).  When I opened my take-out box the next day, I found two FULL containers of both the sauces, the garlic aioli AND the tartar (that hadn't even accompanied my dish). Between that and the free chowder in the rain, Anchor has some of the best service I've ever gotten.\n\nThis IS seafood in San Francisco, so I feel the pricing is very reasonable.  Garlic bread $5, crab cakes $12, sea bass $23, and steamed mussels $29.  Well worth it, and I can't wait for my next visit!", "author": "Vi N."}

First, there are only about 6 tables inside so go early. Their wait system is a little hilarious, you write your name on a dry erase board and wait outside. Luckily we were there on the early side and were sat after about 10 minutes. I could see a huge wait building up here as the seating inside was limited. \n\nOnce seated, we all had a difficult time deciding what to order. So many items looked delicious, particularly the specials. Our waiter was incredibly helpful in ordering the oysters. We had a sample of all their offerings and they were all fantastic. I ended up ordering the cioppino, which is always an option at Anchor Oyster Bar, but not listed on the menu. This was a large bowl containing a plethora of seafood in a flavorful tomato broth, delicious. It also came with a very tasty garlic bread meant for dipping. I highly recommend this dish to anyone stopping by! My colleagues had tuna tartar and mussels, they were all pleased with their choices.

The restaurant is super small - has a bar that can accommodate 8 -10 people and 5 smaller tables that can accommodate 5 max per table. We ended up waiting for about 1.5 hours for 6 seats at the bar cause otherwise, we would have to be split up into two separate tables. However, it was very nice of them to bring us clam chowder while we were waiting in the cold! \n\nThe food was pretty awesome, but after a while, everything will start to taste the same as it's all shellfish, with the only difference in the broth it's in. Overall, I really enjoyed my time there since I love seafood. Everything was super flavorful and cooked to perfection!\n\n1. Garlic Bread\nCheesy, not too garlicky, and just enough crunch! I mean, the garlic bread was good, but I don't think it's out-of-the-world good as some reviews have described them to be. \n\n2. Kumamoto Oysters\nSome of the best oysters my bf has had.\n\n3. Clam Chowder\nLoaded with potatoes, just the way I like it! It's creamy and flavorful. Not overpoweringly rich. I wish the bread it's served with was more hearty and dense so that it can really soak up the chowder. The bread kind of just shrivels up and dissolves when it's dipped in the chowder. But I wouldn't mind having this chowder everyday :)\n\n3.Steamed Clams \nOoops.. my party ate all the clams they had! Clams were fresh, and I really enjoyed the sweetness and freshness of the broth. \n\n4. Combination Steamed Shellfish \nLoaded with seafood - prawns, clams, and mussels! This broth was more tangy, not as good as the steamed clams broth, but I still enjoyed it! \n\n5. Cioppino\nNoms! Again, loaded with seafood in a tomato based soup. Seafood was very fresh and the soup was very flavorful. Generous portions! \n\nWould definitely come again, but either at 6pm or after 9pm, and with a party of 4 or less!

The restaurant's interior is charming, very New England. \n\nMy friend and I shared a bowl of clam chowder and garlic bread. The clam chowder was lighter and less creamy than other versions I've had, but quite good. The garlic bread is BOMB. Crunchy, garlic-y, faintly cheesy. Usually I dislike garlic bread with cheese on it, but Anchor pulled it off. I could have eaten a whole basket myself. \n\nI really didn't like my entree, though. I had some sort of caper sole, and it was just...absurdly caper-y. The thin, small filets were totally overpowered by the caper.  Even if I'd liked the fish, there wasn't that much of it.

I love the nautical decor, simple white walls & a basket of oyster crackers sitting on aluminum tables.

(I am not a fan of clams--no dirty jokes--but they were good here especially with the sauce. I could not stop dipping my bread into it.)\n* [appetizer order of crab cakes for me, $13]: dungeness crab, perfectly brown on the outside, mild tasting & accompanied by a chunky dill tarter sauce. Not the best crab cakes I've had but easily one of the better ones out there. \n* [Italian Fishstew special for my friend, $25]: basically cioppino minus the crab, which isn't in season. Light tomato broth, huge portion. My friend walked away feeling \"full & insulated,\" as he put it! \n* I had the house chardonnay ($5) & my friend also had a glass of white.\n\nService was pretty much perfection. Our waitress & the guy helping her (wasn't sure if he was a busser or another server) were SO nice.

We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table and passed the time by visiting Philz Coffee just down the street. They have a whiteboard outside the restaurant where you can put your name down to be seated. In anticipation of a day full of eating, we only ordered a dozen oysters (3 of each kind they had) and a caesar salad. I'm not the best person to judge oysters as I can only tell a bad one from a good one, but one of my friends knows oysters really well and said that the oysters were good. We were a little disappointed because they didn't have that many types to choose from; only four total, I think. The caesar salad was excellent and comes with huge chunks of garlic bread mixed in. Value-wise, I think Anchor is a good deal and a far better value compared to Hog Island.

Every morsel of food I put into my mouth that night was simply divine, and until last night, I was unsure if my meal was really that delicious, or because of my mental capacity at the time, would I have found a roof shingle to be just as appealing? Well, without a doubt, I can strike the latter from the list of options, as last night's meal was just as good, if not better, than the inaugural visit.\n\nI'm not breaking ground with my assessment of Anchor Oyster Depot or anything, but they deserve all the props they can get. They've been slinging amazing grit from their tiny kitchen for over 30 years (or, as their shirts say, 30 \"shucking\" years!), and I have no reason to believe they won't be around for another 30. \n\nEverything on their menu I've tried has been outstanding, but an immediate favorite of mine is the shrimp cocktail. Yeah, you can buy it by the ton at Costco and it's relatively tasteless... but whatever they do to the bay shrimp and cocktail sauce here will make you forget all of the other times you ate crappy shrimp cocktail at some lame after-work employee mixer in the break room of your office.\n\nAlso, the serve up a mean bowl of Cioppino. I thought that nobody could touch Sotto Mare in that department, but they just might be right up there. It's a bit on the pricey side ($28), but what you get for it simply cannot be beat. Savory tomato broth, upwards of 5 or 6 different sea creatures with toasted bread to dip into the sauce.

I've never been to an oyster bar so this was my first time experiencing one in the Bay Area.   \n\nWe were originally going to Swan Oyster Depot that was on the San Francisco 7x7 100 things to try list, but it was open only until 5pm.  No bueno. So I yelped oyster bar that was currently open and Anchor popped up.  \n\nMatt T. and I headed to Castro and parking may be a bit more difficult to find but I found a PRIME free parking spot right outside of the restaurant.  Sweet.  The place was a bit small and cozy so there was a bit of a wait.  We put our name on the board outside and the waiter came outside to serve little clam chowder samples to keep people warm waiting in the cold!  He was heading towards us but gave it to the other customers and ran out.  I'm sure I slipped an evil eye look somewhere in there that said I want me some CHOWDA!  Soon enough, he quickly said he will come back with more clam chowder soon. Brownie points! \n\nAfter waiting about 20 minutes, we sat at the oyster bar and could see everything that was going on in the kitchen.  I felt like I was watching a mini iron chef show as they prepped the different dishes and cracked fresh oysters open.\n\nWe ordered\n- Shrimp cocktail - $8.95\n- Bowl of Chowder - $6.25\n- Half order of the Anchor Special - $19.95 (comes with six oysters three types, steamed clams and two chilled prawns).\n- Crabcake Appetizer (comes in two) - $11.95\n\nThe waiter was very nice and suggested he will serve the food from cold to hot.  The shrimp cocktail and Anchor Special came out together and I was a bit hesitant at first with the oysters.  Soon enough, we squeezed some lemon onto the oysters and slurpity slurp!  Those are some fresh oysters full of love...yummy. \n\nThe steamed clams were served in a bowl with this delicious and tasty soup that I couldn't get enough of.  The waiter would leave that bowl there so we could dip our bread into it.  Double yum. \n\nThe shrimp cocktail totally beats Costco or Vegas buffet cocktails I've had in the past.  They were little pieces of shrimp and tasted very fresh with the red sauce.  Tip: Don't be shy in squeezing lemon into your sauce and oysters, it adds a zesty oomph!\n\nThe crab cakes and the bowl of clam chowder came next.  The crab cakes, were by far the best crab cakes I ever had.  You could see and taste real crab pieces inside the cakes and it was crunchy on the outside. Yum. Squeeze some lemon on it and dip it into the sauce and you are in crab cake heaven.\n\nThe Clam chowder was served right in front of us so it came steaming hot which is what I like with my food...(and men)  It was thick, creamy, and had the right amount of potatoes inside although it could use more clams in the soup.\n\nAfterwards, I may have had some reaction to eating oysters since my face was feeling hot.  It's a mystery, but it was well worth it.  Overall, it was a great first time experience at an oyster bar and can't wait to go back to slurp some more.\n\n\"Eat oysters, love longer.\"", "author": "Cam C."}

Order it.  I hate over cooked rubbery oysters and shy away from anything baked/grilled/fried.  I don't find it very rewarding to shell out some serious money for overcooked oysters.  I had a pleasure of trying fried oysters this weekend here, and wow. Its lightly coated with panko just to add texture, and its literally thrown into the fryer just to add color to the panko and heat to the oyster.  The result is something so luscious and tasty.  Its cooked enough that it cant be called raw, but its tender & flavorful without the overcooked iron-y, mineral-y, grimy taste.  Ok I'm salivating now.   Six pieces, complimented with their homemade tar tar sauce. Which I ate till my cioppino arrived.   \n\nAlthough its not on the menu, everyone that checks yelp know that they have cioppino.  Its good. Check others for their reviews.  This weekend, I sat on the edge of the bar next to the kitchen.  I watched intently and noticed the chef throwing a bounty of crab meat, topped with a heaping amount of butter, and into the broiler.  I furiously looked for a baked crab appetizer on the menu but was dumbfounded.  Minutes later it landed on my half order (its for people who wait in line for over an hour in the cold, and want to try as many dishes as you can...even if you are only a party of two) of cioppino.\n\nIf, you order the cioppino, locate the buttery crab and place it on your garlic cheesy bread FIRST.  Don't lose out on that opportunity.  After you touch the plump mussels those suckers will sink to the bottom and you'll never find yourself eating a mouthful of buttery crab.  That buttery crab meat is pure gold.

My husband and I got a small Coppino and Cesar salad both of us felt it was the best we had ever had.  The customer service was amazing, while we were waiting outside the waitstaff brought out warm slices of the most amazing garlic bread we had ever had. That was a nice touch and since the bread was so  good it kept us motivated to wait around for a main dish. Tips.. this isn't a restaurant for children!  or large groups! there are tables for 1 (bar) 2 and up to 4 people. it's really,really small and more than likely you are going to be waiting a while to eat. Tip number 2. Get there an hour before you think you want to eat put you name on the list and walk around the Castro. We love this place and go about three times a year.

Not only am I constantly blown away by Chef Taylor's new and amazing dishes, but I constantly feel welcomed and truly loved. Let me give you the breakdown of this awesomeness.\n\n1) Since there is always a rather extensive wait, Phil, the Texan sweet-heart host/drink server/busser always suggest we hop across the street for some wine. Like a true gent, he will come get the group when our table is about to be ready. Love.\n\n2) Once inside, make sure you check out the oyster selection. There are new selections on a daily basis and it's always nice to get a mix of each kind.\n\n3) ORDER THE GARLIC BREAD. This stuff will change. your. life. If you're into clam chowder, theirs is definitely worth a look as well.\n\n4) The dinner specials are constantly changing as well, but I can say I've tried the scallops, cioppino, halibut, sole, pasta dishes, and the crab caesar salad (can you tell I love everything about this place yet?). You really cannot go wrong, so just mix it up and make sure everyone at your table has a different plate.\n\n5) As I mentioned above, the service here is unmatched. Most of the servers have been with this place 15+ years, so they know what they are doing and you can absolutely trust their recommendations. \n\nOverall, Anchor is a place that you just cannot miss. Look past the long wait time and really prepare yourself for an amazing meal.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Sean R."}

Clam chowder was excellent very flavorful not as much \"filling stuff\" which is a personal preference I think. But the base/broth must be homemade stock. Really great deep flavor. Oyster shooter excellent. I don't like tomato juice at all but theirs is more like a sauce you can taste the spices it's rich and delicious. Oysters were fresh my fave of the night was the island creek.  Hubby had fettuccine with clams and loved it. I tried the fettuccine and it was very good. The sauce had a depth of flavor. This is the kind of food that takes time. Can't wait to come back and try the cioppino and crab cakes.

This place seats no more than 25 people at a time, you have to get here early and put your name down on a white board.  The wait is so bad that, by the time we were actually eating, the people waiting outside would start cheering whenever a party was vacating their table or bar stools.  But then again, the food here is so good...\n\nWe started with the clam chowder, which is creamy and seasoned maybe a little light compared to true New England clam chowder (maybe not enough celery and onions in the base), I couldn't really complain.  From the raw bar, we had the full size sampler with a bonus dozen oysters.  I've discovered that I love rich creamy Kusshi oysters as much as Kumamotos, while the Miyagi and Wellfleet were salty/minerally and very fresh.  Their garlic bread could've been more garlicky, but otherwise offered great buttery crisp on the top of a fluffy base.  The steamed mussels come in a delicious garlic lemon tomato broth that screamed for more bread.  The pasta of the day was a delicious conchella cooked al dente in a tomato garlic base with huge prawns.\n\nNext time, I'm definitely ordering the cioppino and whatever amazing pasta they are serving that day, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge and taste for oysters one cold dozen at a time.", "author": "Gene C."}

And not all places serve clams, so if you love clams, you can bookmark this place.\n* Cup chowder $4.25 (3.5 of 5) Creamy and robust. Pretty taste, but not a must get.\n* Oyster shooter $7.00 Each with Soju (3 of 5) - It is a really big shot of soju with a fat raw oyster. Reminds me of bloody mary with an oyster. It was ok, but I really liked that they used soju, instead of vodka. Soju seems to contain the alcohol, but smoothier to drink when trying to gulp the oyster at the bottom of the shot. \n* Caesar with Prawn $21.95 (3.5 of 5) Refreshing.

They definitely give you a HUGH portion which I appreciated alot. But as far as happiness in taste, I wouldn't go back for it. Not bad, but not greatly pleasing. Taste buds are different so definitely give it a try yourself.\n\n-OYSTERS\nI literally am a oyster fein. If I could inject this stuff into my veins I probably would. Anchor Oyster Bar DEFINITELY did not disappoint. Very derrricious, and the set up was right. As simple as it should be, not all oyster places give you all the right sauces. This place was perfect.

There are 3 large tables that can feasibly fit 6 people, but it is a squishy fit for the people that sit back to back. There were also 2 small tables that could fit about 2 people and of course there was the bar seating. \n\nAs for wait time, if you get there early, it isn't too bad. They have a dry erase board on the outside and you write your name, the number of people in your party, and the time that you arrived there. My friend and I didn't know that and we were standing inside for like two minutes before one of the patrons was nice enough to inform us (after seeing at least my confusion) that the board was on the side wall outside. We got there a little after 6 and we were seated in under 30 minutes. \n\nLuckily for me and my friend, we got the large table so it was nice and spacious. The server we had was really nice and I didn't feel rushed to order, eat, and leave. We ordered the full order Anchor Special which came with 12 oysters on a half shell, 8 steamed clams, and 4 chilled prawns for $35.95 (it struck me funny that the half order was $20.95, which is not half the full price). The oysters that day were the Cap Cod Wellingtons, Marin Miyagis, and the Oregon Hoods, all really fresh and delicious. The clams were cooked in this delicious white wine, butter, and thyme broth and the waiter gave us extra bread to sop up all that delicious \"broth.\" \n\nThe other dish we ordered was the New Zealand Bluenose sea bass baked with lemon and thyme, served over frugula sarda with tomato basil sauce. I was a tad bit disappointed with this dish because, i guess unlike Chilean sea bass, this sea bass was lean and not buttery/flakey. Texture wise it was really similar to that of cod fish. The tomato sauce was really strong and over powered the frugula sarda, which reminded me of HUGE Israeli cous cous but a bit more texture. Other than that, I thought the meal was pretty enjoyable. \n\nDefinitely not a place for people who do not like seafood.", "author": "vanessa t."}

Three 4-tops, One 3-top, and One 2-top, plus the bar that seats about 6.  So get there when it opens (learned that trick last night) or be prepared to wait.\n\nOur first visit we arrived there was about 3 names ahead of us it took about an hour to seat us, which was fine.  While waiting the manager greeted all of us waiting with small cups of the Clam Chowder.  Now, I normally don't like Clam Chowder, but OMFGG, this stuff was amazing.  So creamy, hot, delicious.  Filled with good veggies, clams, and seafood wonderfulness. I had already made up my mind on what I was going to have, so I knew next time I would order it.\n\nOur first visit we shared the steamed artichoke appetizer.  Well cooked, great house made aioli, perfect for two to share.  My only complaint is that is was a special and not always available.  We also shared a half carafe of the house chardonnay.  Now normally I don't like box wine, but this was really nice, and well priced.   We also got the house garlic bread.  Its awesome (not my husbands fav, but I liked it)\n\nI got the dayboat scallops special for my entree... WOW! My husband got the 1/2 seafood platter.  His was awesome, 6 oysters, 2 chilled prawns, and about 8 steamed clams.  The white wine sauce that the clams were steamed in was the best part.  Well the clams were good, but that sauce.  I could just drink it!! YUMMMM-O!  Great to use the bread and garlic bread to mop up the sauce. \n\nOur second visit we got 8 oysters to start.  We ordered Kumamotos, but we got the last 6, so the other 2 sweet waters that were served were on the house.  The oysters are so fresh, awesome cocktail sauce, and the best mignonette.  We each got a cup of the amazing Clam Chowder as well.  Just as good as I remembered from that sample the manager passed out.\n\nFor entrees I got the Caesar with crab, my husband got the crab cake entree.  The Caesar was awesome, great dressing, crunchy Romaine, and MOUNDS of fresh crab meat that was so perfect with the Caesar dressing.  The croutons were made from their house garlic bread and really a great match.  The crab cake are awesome.  I don't even know what was holding these together, there was minimal breadcrumbs or other filler. Perfectly cooked and paired with a great house tartar sauce.  My husband said the tartar sauce almost upstaged the crab cakes.\n\nBut overall, awesome food, great service and perfect location.", "author": "David P."}

We waited nearly an hour for a table and I am giving an happy, happy 5 stars. That should say more than any words I can possibly write. \n\nThe space is small, but in an intimate-not-super-cramped way. The decor is borderline kitschy nautical, but the black and white tile is a smart touch that keeps it cool. But honestly, I didn't spend a lot of time looking at the walls because the food took all my attention.\n\nOur party of 3 started with oyster shooters, a bottle of Napa Sauvignon Blanc, and a full order of the Anchor special, a delicious combo of oysters, prawns and steamed clams. They really got something going on here with the stock they're using, because the clam broth was amazing. First you wonder why the server keeps bringing you more and more bread. Then you understand. You need to dip the bread in the broth. And dip. And dip. Till the bread is gone. More on broth later.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the combination salad, topped with a heap of fresh crab meat, prawns and shrimp. It was a $24 salad, but they were generous with the seafood.\n\nHusband ordered the Ciopinno. The CIOPINNO. The server will explain that it comes in two sizes, small and large. But the small is actually quite, quite large and the large is...really large. Yummy seafood dunked in a tasty, buttery broth, topped with two pieces of the best garlic bread you've ever eaten. I realize the words \"garlic bread\" conjure up the stale grocery store bread that you bake in foil in the oven and the butter never quite melts and tastes like chemicals - but this is not that bread. The bread was legit. \n\nI nearly cried when I realized that I couldn't take the Cioppino broth home because we were staying in a hotel and flying the next morning. \n\nSo, in brief, you should eat here. Don't be swayed by the wait time or the fact that visiting the restroom means ever so carefully walking past the flaming gas stove. It will be worth it.", "author": "Lauren V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-08", "description": "This place is great. Great seafood, very fresh, nice variety, but a few problems force me to dock one star. We got a nice seafood feast of crab cakes ($12ish for two-appetizer), the anchor platter ($36 for 12 oysters, 4 shrimp, and a bowl of clams), and the Cioppino ($28ish I think?). \n\nThe crab cakes were really amazing! They were cooked perfectly, my fork cut through them like warm butter. They melted in my mouth, mmmm. The sauce that they brought out was amazing too. It was not tartar, but similar. Maybe with more mayo? IDK, but it was fantastic. \n\nThe oysters were also very good. We had three different types. I think one was local, one was from Cape Cod (one of my fave places on Earth!), and I'm not sure of the other. 2/3 of us preferred the Cape Cod ones (no bias, I swear), while the other 1/3 preferred the local as they were a little saltier. My only problem with these is that 3 or 4/12 of them were very small in comparison to the others. I mean like thumbnail size. That was pretty disappointing considering the prices. The shrimp were good, but not amazing. Just steamed, chilled prawns. \n\nThe clams were anything but ordinary. They were in a delicious garlicky, buttery, wine-based? sauce. There were lots of them, more than I expected. Our waiter intuitively offered more bread to sop up more of the sauce; genius suggestion. \n\nSimilarly, the Cioppino was very good. the \"broth\" was a little less brothy than I am used to and more thick and chunky like a tomato sauce. Otherwise though, great flavor. I would order it as the Fisherman's stew (only difference is with or without crab) because, as much as I love crab, trying to get into one of those things after it has soaked in tomato sauce is imminent disaster for your wardrobe. There was some fish in there that was delish, the mussels were amazing, and the garlic bread that came with it was fantastic. I will definitely be ordering the mussels if I am able to return. \n\nSo here are my beefs. First, the wait was about 45 minutes on a Sunday night after they told us it would not be long. Then, once the three of us were seated at a 2-person table, the service was pretty slow. don't get me wrong, our waiter was great, but it just took a really long time to get our food and things. Also, it was a bit pricey. I know fresh seafood is costly, but I just wish that I could afford to come back more regularly. The food was excellent though for the most part, so I highly recommend.", "author": "Miguel V."}

We ordered the cioppino (for two), Dungeness crab, steamed clams, crab cakes, clam chowder, and garlic bread.  We actually had two orders of garlic bread because it was THAT delicious. The cioppino was lovely, just enough tomatoey goodness that didn't overpower the seafood. The steamed clams were cooked in a broth that tasted as if it had a little wine, thyme, oregano, garlic and red pepper flakes.  The clam chowder was thick and creamy. The crab cakes were good, but we'd probably pass the next time. The star of the meal was the Dungeness crab. It was cooked perfectly and rolled around in butter and garlic that we sopped up with our garlic bread. \n\nWe got served by the tall, thin, gentleman with the salt and pepper hair.  He couldn't have been nicer.  Very sweet and very attentive.  Even though only one of us ordered a cup of clam chowder, he brought out a small cup for the rest of us so we wouldn't be left out.\n\nAfter reading the Yelp reviews, we got there at 5:20pm on a Saturday and was seated within 10 minutes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-09-01", "description": "Definitely a 5/5 and worth the 45 minute wait in line (which is pretty short considering more and more people showed up after we were seated). \n\nMy party of four came around 6:45 pm on a beautiful sunday night and there were only a couple of parties before us. It was not too bad of a wait BUT remember to bring a jacket as SF does get cold at night! (This is a note for those who are not familiar with the area). \n\nAMBIANCE (4/5): This small,5-6 tables restaurant is situated near the heart of Castro district between 18th and 18th street. This restaurant is so small that the washing dishes was done right in front of the customers. The tables and chairs were silver and weren't fancy, and some may know for sure that they serve seafood from the quality of the tables and chairs. Despite the lack of space and the furniture, this place left me speechless with their awesome service and their unforgettable Cioppino and fresh $2.50 oysters. \n\nSERVICE (5/5): At first some may think that the service is very slow and the employees will ignore their customers Even though the service is slow, they are very patient and careful with their customers. There are only a couple of waiters and they are always moving so it may be hard to flag them down BUT they do notice you and they will ask you if you are doing okay and if you need anything. They work slowly but carefully and precisely. I was particularly impressed on how attentive they are and how professional about their service. I want to mention about the chefs in the kitchen, they are very passionate in what they do and will make sure that they bring the best quality of food out to their customers.\n\nQUALITY OF FOOD (5/5): This place is definitely going to land in one of the best restaurants to go eat in the bay area. Their Cioppino, or a big bowl of seafood covered in a nice homemade marina sauce, is the fresh, flavorful and has the perfect amount of spice to make a person wanting for more. I was in love with their mussels; they were so fresh and sweet. I've never had such fresh mussels. Aside from the Cioppino, their oysters were definitely a must-try. The oysters were $2.50 and came from three different regions so you could decide which type of oysters you wanted. We tried all three and we enjoyed all of them. The oysters were so fresh and slimy that made us order more and more. We also ordered clam chowder and garlic bread; they were decent but I could get better ones in other places. The clam chowder wasn't as creamy as i expected and i couldn't get the clam flavor from the chowder. The garlic bread was definitely homemade with nice cheese but the bread as a whole didn't really stand out to me. \n\nPRICE (5/5): We ordered so much food and we finished all of them with ease because it was that delicious. We ordered two orders of Cioppino and clam chowder and the bill came out to be 159 including tax and tip. The price is definitely reasonable for the quality of the food and service. \n\nThis restaurant definitely gave us a memorable experience and we will definitely return for more Cioppino.", "author": "Jacky C."}

It was interesting that when I asked about the cioppino, they said they had crab today, so they can serve cioppino.  I guess if they don't always have crab, the Welsh Fish stew will provide the same dish just without the crab.\n\nThis place is tiny. I think it only seats around 20. I can see how lines form outside. I didn't see a bathroom.  Dishes are washed in front of the counter.\n\nWent around 12:30 on a Saturday. no wait. I sat at the counter.

The sourdough bread dipped in the remaining huge bowl of garlic butter sauce the clams came in is a great way to top off the meal. And, I always must have my Anchor Steam as a chaser. \n\nThe service is polite, friendly, and as efficient as they can be considering they are always packed. If you're coming here for dinner hour (6pm or later), be prepared to wait outside, because there is no room in the restaurant. (So, choose a night it's not too cold). Otherwise- I strongly recommend this as a weekday lunch place- because on the evenings and weekends you can easily wait 20 minutes to a half hour. \n\nThe decor is really casual- metal tables are packed in tight along with an eating bar- so no need to dress fancy for this quality seafood.", "author": "Nick M."}

I walked past every day on the way to the station. \n\nThe queues are epic, but even as tourists we figured out the best thing to do is jot your phone number on the white board and duck across the street to drink wine in the cute little bottle shop/bar across the road. Brilliant way to kill time. \n\nOnce inside the service is quick and snappy. Food is amazing, beer is cold. Between 3 of us we tried the oysters (not the usual selection available as it was Labour Day Holiday weekend), the mussels, the crab cakes, the bread (OMG even the bread was amazing), and the scallops. \n\nCheck this place out!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-20", "description": "While tucked away from the bustling side of Castro Street, Anchor Oyster Bar is definitely no hidden gem. I immediately made that observation on that cold windy evening as I glanced at the menacing wait list. Despite the coveted four and a half stars... regardless of the woman in waiting reassuring us that \"it's worth the wait\"... I was still a bit skeptical. Primarily because none of the Yelp highlights were personally compelling. \"They rave about the clam chowder, garlic bread, and crab cakes,\" I told my sister in dismay. \"Nothing I'd go out of my way for...\" or so I thought...\n\nOnce seated, I get down to business -- peruse the drink menu. A decent variety of four (mostly local microbrews) on tap along with the usual suspects in bottle form. I always appreciate a place with a good offering of quality brew, so kudos to Anchor for striving to provide some sort of offering given it's tiny space. \n\nWhile the space is tiny, only probably being able to accommodate twenty something patrons, it never felt cramped. Despite the fake swordfish and other swashbuckler paraphernalia adorning the walls, the ambiance was romantic -- in a cute, \"I'm not trying that hard to impress you, but after you're done, I will have\" kind of way. \"Good place to bring a date,\" I mentally noted as I looked disappointedly at my sister (I'm just kidding. I love my sis! *duck*). I assume the other parties around us were in agreement. The couple across from us were deep in conversation as the man caressed his girlfriend's arm. The couple whose table we were waiting for seemed to be lingering for an eternity even after their check arrived. I only know because I was intently staring at them, sending them telepathic messages, \"Pay your damn bill and get the hell out!! I'm freezing my ass off out here!!\" \n\nThe food was excellent. We ordered two bowls of clam chowder, the Anchor Special (dozen oysters, steamed mussels, four jumbo shrimp), garlic bread, and crab cakes. My only tiny issue about the clam chowder was that I wished it was hotter. The oysters were fresh -- however, our server didn't tell us which oysters were what until I asked (I'm just nitpicking here -- service was, in fact, very attentive and friendly, so I only have the silliest things to gripe about.) The broth for the steamed mussels was fantastic -- on the menu, it's just listed as \"steamed mussels\" -- but believe me, it's MUCH more exciting than just \"steamed mussels\". \n\nThe garlic bread was the highlight of the night. I'm far from being some sort of die hard carbivore -- in fact, the only reason why I ordered it was because it was a yelp highlight -- but oh god... this was something else. In fact, the garlic bread alone made the wait worthwhile. I loved it so much, it gets its own dedicated paragraph in this review. \n\nAnd so I have a feeling that I'll be waiting out in the cold once again. However, this time, I'll be the one telling the naive skeptic, \"It's worth the wait.\"", "author": "Edward Y."}

We put our name on the board and headed across the street to buy some wine to bring with us for our meal (a great little wine store, btw). We ended up waiting 1.5 hours and then only managed to sit in 4 seats at the bar, my seat on the end and arguably  the worst seat in the place. But none of this mattered because this place is magic. Our servers made great suggestions and we ordered exactly as they suggested and ate family style; the Anchor Special starter (oysters, prawns and the best steamed clams I've ever had), the Caesar salad with crab, and their incredible  Cioppono.

This is a special place to me, kind of a neighborhood Taddich Grill or Sam's Grill, both 100 plus year old downtown legends.  It's small, intimate I guess without any implied romance or hanky panky.  I tell friends Anchor is who would cater my last meal before the executioner had his way with me.  Several very close friends, thank you Jamison, Jimmy and Matt, took me here for a birthday dinner that still ranks among my favorites dinners.  I can enjoy a perfect lunch here with a bowl of their yummy to my tummy clam chowder, a shrimp, crab and/or prawn salad and some of their GREAT garlic bread.  They also prepare several versions of a variety of truly fresh fish fresh from the sea.\n\nIt's a rainy day counter and half a dozen or so tables and it is crowded and waiting diner's can stare at you through the plate glass window to guilt you into not savoring a 6th cup of coffee.  Actually people who dally too long at a super crowded restaurant should face a meal with Osama and the recently deposed maniac leader of Libya with dirty weapons and a price on the too long at the party bastards heads.  I've had some really good crab cakes, grilled salmon, fish fried platters, oysters and just about everything else that lives in water.

We got there at 615 on a Saturday and waited no more than 20 minutes, which isn't bad. \n\nWe ordered the steamed shellfish combo and a bowl of clam chowder. The chowder is really good, it isn't thick like chowder from other places and it's sweet with load of clam taste. For $6.50, it's a bit on the pricy side, but I think it's worth every penny of it. The steam shellfish is super bomb!! I'm not a mussels kinda girl, but I loved the mussels here. All the clams and mussels soaked up the soup they were cooked in so it marinated them and is very sweet and tasty. You can truly taste the freshness of the seafood. I will most definitely order the combo again! \n\nThe service here is good, but we were waiting to have our order taken for at least 10 minutes. They only have 1 guy who takes orders.. Other than that, the ambulance is great. You see the open kitchen where food is being cooked, and i loved cute boats decoration around the restaurant. They're restroom is a bit awkward to get to--you need to walk through the kitchen...\n\nI'll be back to dine again. Just wish parking isn't so hard.", "author": "Jenny G."}

However, if you can snag a seat, you're in for a treat!\n\nWe three ended up at the bar, and between the service and the food, I've rarely enjoyed a culinary experience so much.  Soju oyster shooters gave us a start - a tasty twist on the vodka norm.  We then split the Anchor Standard - oysters from all over, and shrimp and clams in a broth that had us fighting over the bowl.  There was clam chowder, and crab cakes with a seriously impressive crab to breading ratio, as well as an artichoke that almost looked too pretty to eat.  Almost.  I glance at the cioppino served down the bar made me wish that I had that hollow leg I was accused of possessing as a child.\n\nThe service was wonderful - our waiter was friendly, patient, and made some excellent suggestions.  It's possible we changed our order three times, and he not only put up with us, but ensured we were well cared for throughout our meal.

If you love seafood then you have to make your way here. The restaurant is a little cozy and seats less than approximately 30 but that's all part of that warm family feel you get when you dine here. The seating area is split between tables and a bar area where you can belly up and talk to the servers during your meal. \n\nWe started with a couple oysters on the half shell for appetizers. Then we ordered the Welsh Fish Stew (not always on the menu) and the Cioppino (a staple at Anchor). The Welsh Fish Stew is cream-based and the Cioppino is tomato-based but besides that they're pretty similar. I'd say the Cioppino is hands down the better of the two and I'd recommend that to anyone that's trying Anchor for the first time. It's got cod, muscles, clams, dungenous crab and a couple pieces of grilled bread. It's amazing and very filling. Apparently there's a regular and a large size. I got the regular size and barely finished it. I had a lot of the broth left so I asked to have it to go. I'd imagine a lot of cooks out there could make use of that broth in a different dish but I'm not as saavy so I'll finish it off with some delicious bread. \n\nI thought our meal was reasonable priced at approximately $30/entree given the quantity and quality of the dinner. You'll find plenty of street parking a block or two south of the restaurant. I guarantee if you like seafood, in a casual setting, that you will love this place.", "author": "Ken C."}

I love SF and use to come up often to eat at the Crab House, until they were sold.  They've never been the same so we would go up to Seattle for great seafood instead.  \n\nRecently, we were in SF for a meeting, so I Yelped around and came on this place.  Wow!  Its such a cool little place where the diners have been eating here for decades.  I chatted with people outside waiting for our table and with folks sitting next to me at the bar.  Clearly - they all said we have to try the cioppino. So, we ordered a dozen oysters, half of the garlic roasted crab, and, of course, the cioppino.  Well, the oysters were superb.  Fresh, crisp, briny, sweet, paired with a wonderful chardonnay.  The roast crab was amazing.  It was not smothered in olive oil and was perfectly roasted with just a enough garlic for garlic lovers.  The shells were well cracked making the sweet morsels of flesh easy to get to.  Finally, the cioppino was a masterpiece.  It was perfectly proportioned with clams, mussels, crab legs, and halibut; then topped with a garlic bread so good, it would have made a perfect meal by itself.  You won't be able to quit the sauce - you will want to ask for more bread to soak up every drop.  \n\nWe sat at the bar where you can make eye contact with your chefs, who were two lovely ladies passionately working to keep up with all the orders.  They were cheerful and clearly loved their work, occasionally, looking up to see that we were enjoying the fruit of their labor.  The service was great as we felt very well attended to.

I ordered the Anchor Special; of the 12 oysters shucked one had slipped off its shell and hung like a salvador dali clock.  The \"chilled prawns\" were no better and no worse than peeled and boiled frozen jumbo shrimp from the supermarket.  The clams were, I am still shocked to write, cooked with chicken broth.\n\nI see a lot of good reviews of their clam chowder.  This too is cooked with chicken broth.

Yes, I was disappointed, though the draft Trumer was a consolation.\n\nAttention to detail or lack thereof reveals boatloads.

We got to Anchor at 8pm and promptly placed our names on the waiting list. Sat around. Sat around. Waited.\n\n....Waited.\n\nAnd then a server comes out and counts how many of us were outside. I was thinking this was a bad sign. Was he counting to figure out when to stop letting people sign up? Was he counting because he was overwhelmed by the number of people outside and the lack of seats inside? And then a minute later, he walked out with 8 bowls of clam chowder. Not just that! He sprinkled ground pepper into each bowl & accompanied each bowl with sufficient oyster crackers. First of all, I LOVED the clam chowder. It wasn't too thick like chowder usually is. And it was perfect for the cold, rainy weather outside. And second of all, how freakin' sweet of them to send us clam chowder.\n\nOkay, so I might have exaggerated out waiting time. But we did wait about 40 minutes before we decided to walk to the local bar and have a quick drink. We stayed about 15 minutes at the bar and went back only to find our names were skipped. Talk about bad luck. The nice thing about Anchor is that they don't just erase your name if you're not there. We were still kept on the waiting list, and we were still able to get our table after a little more waiting.\n\nYes, the wait is long, but it's SO worth it! It's a small place with limited seating and they really don't try to rush you. It's just that kind of atmosphere where you can have a nice meal and not feel like they're trying to get rid of you quickly.\n\nThe garlic bread was indeed amazing. I ate like 6 pieces from the basket! It cost $5 for a fairly big basket of garlic bread, sufficient to share amongst 4 or 5 people.\n\nThe sea bass with aioli was really a delight. The sea bass was moist & seasoned lightly with pepper and salt (I'm not sure if anything else was on it). The aioli complimented the fish well, being light with a little bit of a tang. My friends got a dish with various shell fish. They loved the mussels. While I'm not a shell fish eater myself, I tried the butter, white wine, herbed broth that the shell fish came in and it was absolutely delicious.

Good selection, slightly expensive, but really served right.  Some crusty bread, a selection of wines and beers oriented to work with oysters, and a really nice setup that lets you decide how much horseradish to mix into your cocktail sauce.

Once you get that coveted table, expectations are sky high.\n\nThe food here is pretty good.   But does it justify the intimacy and social cost of eating here?  Maybe.\n\nClam chowder is proper.  It tastes like a real Boston clam chowder, if a bit light on the clams.  Potatoes are al dente, a nice touch.\n\nThe fruits de mer platter with oysters, shrimp and clams is satisfying.  The oysters are all from the east coast, an oddity in San Francisco, but quite nice.  The clams taste heavily of raw garlic.  The chilled shrimp are slightly overcooked.\n\nBay scallops are breaded and baked, which leaves them cooked evenly and lightly, a nice touch.  There's a huge pile of mashed potatoes that taste mostly of salt, but lacking creaminess.  Steamed vegetables are a bit sloppy:  undercooked carrots, red peppers with the skin and bitter membrane left on.  Asparagus at varying levels of doneness from al dente to limp.  I love the house-made tartar sauce; it's like a lighter sauce gribiche.\n\nMexican halibut is an oddity.  Why?  Surely there are fresher, more local fish to try.  It's cooked with herbs such as fresh thyme, but the salt is sorely lacking and the cut leaves the edges bone dry with a juicy middle comprising about 50% of the total dish.\n\nAnchor is a breath of fresh air in the Castro with really fresh seafood, and a homey exclusivity that defies the come-one, come-all mentality of the rest of the street,  But at its price point, it needs more precision to justify itself.  Nevertheless I appreciate what they are trying to accomplish.", "author": "J W."}

They cut up toasted garlic bread to make the croutons and toss it with a health slathering of dressing. We always split the salad and an entree and usually have food left over. Their prices are a little on the high-side, but the portions are big so sharing is satisfying and economical. \n\nThe staff is friendly, they pour wine generously, and their bread and butter is yummy. The space is small but adds to the experience with a heavy marble bar, tiled floor, and aluminum furniture - it feels the part of an oyster bar while remaining cozy. \n\nThe wait can be a bit long, but you can put your name on the list and walk around the Castro if there's time to kill.

Often time with clams, if they aren't prepared well, you might get some bits of sand within the clams.  Fortunately, we didn't find any of the sands that might have distracted us from savoring the flavor of their claims.  We really liked their clams.\n\nThe Dungeness crab was ~$30.9x for the entire crab (comes with clam chowder).  They pre-cracked most of them, making it fairly easy to access the sweet and plump meat.  The garlicky broth complements the sweetness of the meat.\n\nI forgot the name of the beer that we had, might be Big Daddy IPA.  I wanted something hoppy to go with the crab.  The server's recommendation was right on.\n\nTheir service was friendly and attentive.  None of their patrons were ever rushed.  However, since we waited for 1 hour and 45 min, we were famished, and polished off the bowl of clam chowder (came with the Dungeness crab), the huge bowl of clams, and even larger servings of the crab in no time.\n\nDuring the 1 hour 45 min wait, the server/host came and gave people waiting outside some free shrimp appetizer of some sort.  It made the wait enjoyable. \n\nMy only question is to the two male patrons that sat at the table next to the window for over 1 hour 45 minute chatting over coffee while others waited patiently for their table, \"seriously? It is obvious you both like each other, get a room already, and let me have my table.\"\n\nAll joking aside, the food and service were excellent.  We look forward to our next visit.\n\nTIPS:  When signing up your name on the board, make sure to write in your time of arrival.  Their sign up board can only accommodate a small list.  They use your time stamp to make sure that you are called within the right sequence.  I wish the operator will change the board to something else.  Also, a note to the host, please be aware of people that take short cuts.   One couple cut in line in front of about 12 people waiting outside after we waited for about 1 hour.

I went on Saturday night and the line was about 40 minutes. Even though it was cold outside, the wait wasn't bad at all, given that the host was super nice and even gave everyone a free cup of chowder for having to wait. Once we got seated, we were waited on immediately and all of the servers were very personable and attentive. We ordered the cioppino and the raw bar combo and both items were out of this world. It was the best cioppino I've ever had at a restaurant, and the seafood was super fresh. The oysters were delicious and everything was well presented. The atmosphere is really chill and welcoming. It's not pretentious like other high end seafood places are in the city. I would highly recommend this place, although if you have a party bigger than 2 or 3, expect a pretty long wait seeing as the restaurant is pretty small.", "author": "Regina L."}

What I expected was a crab cake on a burger bun. What I received (and happily devoured) was hand-picked Dungeness crab on a burger bun with a house tartar sauce that should really rename itself to something better like \"XYZ aioli\". I don't like tartar sauce; I really enjoyed this sandwich.\n\nAlso Delicious (and why you come here!): The oysters. We had a half dozen to get a fair sampling of the 3 types on the daily menu. They were all fresh and delicious, and the local ones were very different than the East Coast oysters I'm accustomed to. Creamy, briny, and just about the cleanest taste you can imagine.\n\nDelicious, but not nearly as much as everyone seems to think: The Clam Chowder. And this is more of a personal preference. I like a creamier, thicker clam chowder, and this one is a bit more soupy. That said, the flavors are delicious, and it's a great side to whatever else you're getting to eat. This is pretty much the only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars here.\n\nIt's places like this that have me asking why I live so far away from SF.", "author": "Gina E."}

The wait wasn't terrible on a Friday night, as long as you're not dining with a part of 4 or more. The restaurant has a quaint setting in the sense that there's only one person assigned to each specific restaurant position. \n\nThe dining menu was fairly simple; one page, double sided, with food on the front side and drinks on the backside. The highlight of the place is of course its fresh oysters. Surprisingly, the price for a single serving of oysters were not listed on the menu because the restaurant has a variety of oysters from all over the country. The only way to find out about them is to talk to your waiter. the waiter introduced to us to their current seasonal oysters which came from Massachusetts, Washington, and Northern California. From this, we opted to try two of each as a sampler. In addition to the oysters. we ordered one of the night's fish special, the mahi mahi, along with some house garlic bread.\n\nOverall, the food was exceptional but the service was okay. I say this because it took the the waiter 15 or more minutes to come to our table an take our order and it wasn't as if the restaurant was all that busy.", "author": "Ben W."}

The crab was pretty good, but I bet it is better straight from the shell. Lesson learned. I really liked the cocktail sauce, which was topped with a hefty dose of horseradish. \n\nNext up was the caesar salad, which was maybe the best one I have had in SF. I tasted the anchovies in in the dressing, which was delicious but not overwhelmingly fishy. The croutons were amazing: chunks of bread toasted to perfection to be crunchy on he outside, and moist inside...perfect dressing reservoirs! \n\nMy wife and I split the pasta with clams as a main course. It was buttery garlicky goodness that did not skimp on the bivalves, and the pasta was cooked just right.

We waited over an hour and a half last night-Saturday-for a table. By the time we got in, we were too cold and weary to find the enjoyment for which we hoped. So, the food is great. Because they don't take reservations, they provide a white-board out front for diners to write their names. As the waiter calls the names on the board, if they aren't there, he passed on to the next name. Even after a name was called several times, the names remain on the board and the name keeps getting called when space inside becomes available. People were showing up an hour or more later after their names had been called repeatedly, and they still got table. Sort of like being punished for waiting.

Remembering a local friend had recommended AOB several times for some of the best seafood in the city, my stomach went into full revolt as in STOP NOW idiot.  My friend had warned me about the usual waits but since it was about 14:00, there was no line and a open spot at the bar so I thought - destiny of both time and place!  \n\nI walked in and was seated at the end of the bar where I had unobstructed view of many dishes being expertly assembled with great care in the kitchen not more than 5 feet away - talk about torture.  After about 10 minutes of watching various mouthwatering seafood being whisked out the main portal and reviewing the simple menu and specials, I decided upon a board special of a lite and cool dish of Seafood Gazpacho with Prawns, Bay Shrimp, Dungeness Crab, Avocado and Sour Cream (held).  While I waited anxiously, I devoured the excellent sourdough bread and many glasses of ice cold water.  The waiter expertly maintained my glass at full though at times I'm sure he thought I was performing some sort of torture test of his attentiveness with me downing all that water after that hike.   Once the Gazpacho arrived, I was even more impressed with the meal and the taste - oh my it was just want I needed after that hike.  The dungeness crab was a wonderful addition to what I am sure is an already spectacular dish!  \n\nOverall, if you do not mind a wait during peak times, as they can only seat about 25 seats (I counted), AOB is a nice place to get some really good and assuredly fresh seafood prepared by a master.

It's usually a carrot and green bean mix and they're always cooked perfectly! (with just the right amount of crunch).

The sauce they toss that pasta in is AMAZING.  \n\nThe only negatives that I have are:  First of all, I have had two specials that were just ok.. don't get me wrong, they weren't bad or disappointing at all, but they just didn't thrill me.

Everything about this small Castro seafood establishment wowed me. My boyfriend and I wrote our party info on the outside dry erase board, gazing up and down the vibrant street while waiting a short while for a space at the bar. Fragrances of fresh, high-quality seafood wafted around the room, rounded out by the warm lighting and hot male chef and waiter. I appreciated the hook beneath the granite bar top--a place to safely secure my shopping bag and purse. \n\nI asked for a Hogue Late Harvest Riesling, since I noticed they carried the Cab. Because the Riesling wasn't available, our waiter disappeared in an effort to find something similarly light and crisp: the Bonheur Convivial. \n\nThe bar overlooks the dish washing area, above which the daily specials are hyped on a dry erase board. Along the mirrored back wall, menu staples are written in white. Plus, an arched opening reveals the kitchen. \n\nSince I couldn't decide between the Crab Caesar and the Pasta with Hog Island Clams special, the waiter suggested I order half of each. The crab Caesar salad, brimming with fresh generous crab meat, contained bright green roughage; soft, melting, house-made croutons; tart cheese; and cracked pepper. Although I was relatively full after attacking my mind-blowing salad, I shoveled a hearty amount of my pasta as well. The penne pasta, tossed with clams still in the shell, contained spinach and garlic, gaining a subtle, pleasant flavor from lemon and white wine. \n\nMy boyfriend, who usually doesn't eat much, finished his Half Moon Bay Cod, poached in a lemon-thyme broth. Fresh thyme sprigs, roasted potatoes and string beans added depth to the light, flaking fish. \n\nIn addition to the wonderful meal and comfortable atmosphere, I appreciated the classy service. I had been trekking through the city all day, dressed casually and sweating like a tourist.

Anchor Oyster Bar was just a few blocks away so we decided to check it out. We ordered and shared:\n - Half order of the Anchor Special (comes with six oysters, steamed clams and four chilled prawns).\n - Open face crab sandwich with a small salad\n\nAccording to my friend, the oysters were AMAZING! We both loved the steamed clams and the yummy sauce they were swimming in. We kept dipping our bread in the sauce. It was goood! The shrimp was just right with a little bit of sweetness.\n\nThe open face crab sandwich was amazing as well. We were glad we shared it since it was pretty heavy with gooey cheese and mayo. We called it the crab dip sandwich as we were eating it.\n\nWhile eating the owner and our server kept talking to us and making sure we were taken care of. They were fascinated that my friend is from Hawaii. A fellow diner sitting behind us was listening and joined our conversation as well. \n\nI'm glad to have discovered Anchor Oyster Bar.

My last showing was in the Castro.\n\nAll the double entendre offerings at the cutesy eateries on Castro weren't doing it for me, so I said fuck it, and had oysters at Anchor Oyster Bar. The line to eat there is always endless, and it was just me, and it was a cold and rainy Thursday, so I went for it.\n\nI sat at the bar and got cheap wine and expensive seafood. (Not really, it's fresh seafood. That shit costs.) The service was comfortable and unassuming and nice. I fell in love with oysters a while back, but rarely indulge due to they can really ratchet up the dinner tab. Tonight I had six, two Sweetwaters from the local waters here, two gems from Cape Cod, and my favorites, the twin beauties from British Columbia. Just lemon, and swallow. So perfect. I never knew. \n\nI also had clams and soup some, but they oysters were the main event.\n\nOne of the servers behind the bar caught my ear as he chatted up a regular, and I settled up my bill. It was distinctly Southern; it was unmistakable. Even underneath all his otherwise effeminate voice, I could hear it in his \"well, welcome back\" to the gentleman beside me.\n\n\"Where are you from?,\" I asked him as I handed over my card. It's a standard opening line in these parts. He grinned as he said, \"Texas.\"\n\nNot quite Southern, but oh so close when you are this far away.\n\nI told him I was from Tennessee, and that his drawl is unmistakable. And nice to hear. You rarely hear the Southern accent that unbridled here, and his was certainly thick.\n\n\"Have fun during your stay,\" he told me warmly as he returned my card with a pen and requisite receipts. I nodded, and headed for the door. I tucked the rental application papers further down in my purse as misty rain greeted me at the exit.\n\nI crossed at the crosswalk, and saw the lights of the 24 approaching the stop down the street. I hustled, oysters jostling, and easily made it.", "author": "Brittney G."}

We tried this place OPTIMISTICALLY, and were in a good mood and happy to wait, but were disappointed.\n\nThe positives:  The Castro is a nice area, the restaurant has sort-of a nice genuine seafoodey atmosphere, the staff cared about the fact you are waiting outside in the cold, and the clam chowder was tasty (we got some while outside free since we had to wait a long time).  \n\nThe negatives:  For starters: the wait was too long on a Tuesday though regulars waiting said it was worse than usual.  \n\nThe shrimps were large buy WAY WAY WAY overcooked, as if they had been prepared the day before rubbery.   \n\nThe oysters were fresh enough but were pretty microscopic and poorly shucked.  A few of them were still attached to the shell - which I guess is OK - but every last one of them had serious chunks.  They could do better if you are paying a lot for each oyster.  At least, consuming \"shell\" is something that may be good for you in small doses and may explain Okinawan longevity.  I'd rather do dark chocolate.\n\nThe Caesar salad was just OK, but I'd say not up to Bay Area standards.  Buy hey- I am not impressed with oversalted, overdressed salads...    If Caesar salad is going to be one of the 3 things on your menu, it should be outstanding.\n\nAlso, beware:  steamed clams means they are steamed in a bunch of ingredients, not just steamed on their own like the East Coast.  EVEN the oyster crackers were stale.\n\nSo, in short, maybe we had a bad experience... but if you go stick to the clam chowder and the salmon of the day - what we probably should have gotten.", "author": "Lujinski M."}

UNSANITARY FOOD PREPARATION TECHNIQUES.\n\nthis is one restaurant where i almost walked out when i saw how the food was being prepared.  but i decided to stay, primarily so i could continue to observe the atrocity of it all and report back to fellow yelpers.\n\n1. the same rag is used to: hold the oysters while shucking, wipe down the food preparation area, take pans out of the oven, and clean off your plate to make it presentable before it is served to you. \n2. cook had two friends visiting him on the night i patronized this place.  one was his girlfriend, the other a male friend.  both were drinking wine and eating food in the kitchen.  where did the food come from? let me elaborate a little further. cook prepares customer's food in oven or stove. when ready, dishes some on friends' plates and then dishes the rest on the customer's plate.\n3. cook takes baked scallops out of the oven, gives a couple to his friends, gives the rest to the customer's plate. realizes he gave too many to his friends and goes back to their plate, removes some and puts on customer's plate.  Wipes around the edge of the customer's plate with rag mentioned in #1 to clean it off & make it presentable.  Dish served to customer.\n5. cook went into the bathroom with his girlfriend. 5 minutes later, comes out & wipes mouth on the back of his hand and resumes preparing food for customers.\n6. cook's girlfriend, who is probably tipsy at this point, comes to food preparation area with food in one hand, glass of wine in other. Talks & laughs with mouth full over food that is being prepared.\n7. cook's girlfriend eats & talks over a pan sitting on top the oven.  When she leans over, the pan is less than 5 inches away from her mouth.  Pan is used later on in the night to prepare food for a customer.\n8. not inappropriate for food preparation rather a demonstration of how unprofessional the wait staff is. I was with my parents, it was around 8pm, rainy & cold and the only space available was 3 seats at the bar.  I ordered a beer, my parents did not order drinks.  After taking our order, the waitress at the bar says to a coworker in a voice loud enough so we can hear her say \"I don't know why you would take up space at the bar if you're not ordering drinks.\" Mind you, we just ordered raw oysters, clam chowder, two appetizers, and three entrees.  The name of the establishment is \"Anchor Oyster Bar.\"  Not \"Anchor Bar.\"\n\nI had a difficult time swallowing the 6 oysters I ordered (oh normally yummy kunamotos).  The rest of the food was hard to enjoy after watching how other patrons' food was being prepared.  I'm sure stuff like this happens in other kitchens.  But those kitchens don't happen to have a large window into their kitchen.  The owner / host did try to move me and my parents to another table once he noticed we were watching the food preparation.  He also went to talk to the cook, who was then EXTRA careful when preparing the remainder of our food.\n\nI am going to lodge a complaint with the SF Department of Public Health.\n\nOn another note, I waited two weeks to write this review so emotions from the unprofessional waitress comment would not influence my review.  I have only documented only what I observed.  SF DPH does keep a public record of their inspections.  Anchor Oyster Bar has had multiple violations over the past couple of years with regards to food storage / preparation and cleanliness.\n\nzero stars if i could.", "author": "Catherine A."}

The servers seem to do all the seating which is fine for such a small place. \n\nHad the special cioppino with fresh crab legs, mussels, shrimp, clams, ad big hunks of fish. It was amazing. I felt like I was in Lisbon again eating away along the waterside in summer. (Yeah I know cioppino is Italian, but the Portuguese make some tasty seafood stews too).  The garlic bread was the good kind of greasy garlicky that made me want to eat more and more and not put it aside for the dog.\n\nI noticed people who didn't finish everything got to take home doggie bags.  The portion was a little on the large side but I wasn't complaining! The complimentary sourdough bread reminded us we were in the city. \n\nThe place is small but seems larger then it appears because of all the stainless steel and glass on the walls.  Open shelves seemed nice and clean. I bet the fresh shucked oysters are terrific! \n\nThe menu was just enough variety that we debated between a few dishes, but didn't agonize and take forever because of too many choices. \n\nGO - you won't be disappointed!", "author": "Tina P."}

I've seen the episodes with the apple festival in WA (I'm from Seattle and I've never been to it), the garlic festival in Gilroy, CA (that's 1.5 hours from where I live now and I've never been), and many others.  I guess I like the show because it gives me something to want to go to even if I never make it.\n\nFrom the show, I've become fascinated with the seafood festivals in New England.  Lobster, crab, chowder, you name it.  I'm always nagging my bf that we should take a vacation to these random towns just so I can attend one of them!  \n\nAlas, I've never made it beyond NYC, but I'm content eating seafood at Anchor Oyster Bar in SF.  The seafood there is the best!  I haven't eaten there in about 4 years, and I finally made it back for lunch because, frankly, I was having a crappy-ass morning and I knew that Anchor would cheer met up.  And that it did!\n\nThere's a small standard menu at Anchor, but you really need to order from the specials menu above the counter.  The restaurant is tiny with only three stainless steel 4-top tables, two 2-tops, and a marble counter.  Therefore, don't expect to get seated right away during the dinner rush.  It's worth the wait though!\n\nToday I had the crab burger with a cup of chowder.  The burger came with a large pile of fresh, juicy, chunky crab meat on a warm toasted sesame bun.  It also had mixed greens, tomato, and their house tartar sauce.  Simple, yet, oh so delicious!  The crab there is amazing, and although I did encounter a few inner shells, the extraordinary taste of the crab eased my annoyance.  The tartar isn't very strong and actually helps to enhance the crab flavor.  Don't get me wrong, I love fatty, thick tartar sauces as much as the next person, but you can walk away from eating this burger without feeling bloated and vomit-y sick.  Same goes for the chowder!\n\nIn the past, I've had their addictive salads topped with crab and shrimp, and I recommend those whole-heartedly.  Actually, everything I've ever had at Anchor was delicious.  That's because everything is so freakin' fresh!  Try their oysters, the varieties change depending on what's in season.\n\nThe service is always friendly and attentive.  One customer came in and sat one seat away from me at the counter.  He had his salad up in the window within 2 minutes without even ordering from the waiter.  If only I could afford being a regular at Anchor!  \n\n(I guess that's why I only give Anchor 4/5 stars.  It's great, but it can get pricey!)", "author": "Vicente G."}

Super high pressure dinner, so needed a great place. AOB DELIVERED! Everyone loved it.\n\nClam Chowder was creamy, fresh but not too heavy. We order one bowl to try and the wait staff split it in four cups. Now that's service!\n\nThe steam clams were out of this world! I normally swear that West Coast manila clams are much better than East Coast ones. They somehow made these Massachusetts clams taste like heaven in a white wine, garlic, thyme, and red chili flake broth. This is despite numerous New England visits to my boyfriend's parents and sampling the clams there. The clams came with the AOB Special seafood platter (prawns and sampling of oysters). Great bargain!\n\nEveryone loved the Cioppino. Every SF restaurant makes it slightly different. AOB's is super fresh (made to order, as I had views of the kitchen), with no fishy taste so you know the seafood was fresh, and lots of herbs. They didn't skimp on the seafood i can tell you that! Fantastic cheesy bread too.  They brought out so many utensils and bowls/plates that made it easy to eat.  My stain-prone boyfriend kept his French-cuffed white dress shirt spotless.  Amazing!  This was everyone's favorite dish.\n\nThe surprise of the night for me was wild King salmon with thyme(?) garlic sauce. I ordered it mostly for the side of veggies and rice to share.  And the basmati rice and carrots/broccoli/cauliflower were all done right.  With the right technique, simple things can taste amazing.  But the sauce, OMG! The wait staff automatically brought out extra sauce for me, obviously seeing how much I loved it. I want to bottle that sh*t up and sell it all over town I Love Lucy style. So delicious and addictive!!! And the salmon was perfectly cooked, tasting light, fluffy and fresh. None of that overpowering salmon taste that normally turns me off except with overpowering teriyaki sauce.\n\nThe wait staff apologized for our wait despite us getting the table within 30 minutes on a Saturday night (a fluke for sure as we see the lines here every night on the way home, that being the reason we haven't been here in many years). And really our wait was because the previous diners just sat there for a long time after finishing their dinner and made my poor mother wait in the cold. Thanks guys, though I am sure they were just rehashing their own fantastic dinner. Anyways it was worth it. My sister loved it despite constantly being taken out on corporate expense account dinners at far fancier places. She even texted her boss to try this restaurant during dinner. Yeah she's got a smart phone addiction. Looks like I have a new obsession too: AOB!\n\nPS, I think my Mom really liked my boyfriend.  She especially liked that he served cioppino to everyone else before serving himself.  My evangelical mother liking my gay boyfriend.  Maybe there is a god after all!", "author": "Jason J."}

It is small and intimate and doesn't take reservations but worth the wait.\nThe staff is very accommodating and constantly in motion to provide an incredible array of seafood.\nThere are handwritten menus above the bar that are spectacular. Fresh Sweetwater Oysters on the half shell. Mexican prawns served in a sauce you will not taste anywhere else. And the presentation of each is as good as it gets.\nFirst of all the garlic bread they bring to the table may be the best you could ever hope to eat. Then the clam chowder is creamy and tasty. The Cioppino is so good you dream somehow you could actually make it at home. A large special order of crab legs was served with bibs to help you enjoy them all the more.\nOur first time there but certainly not our last.

We arrived early (about 4:30 PM) because this place can and will fill up quickly. I highly advise a game plan of some sorts and/or dine alone for a better chance at success. You can easily wait a good 45 minutes for a chance to eat. But once your in, it's definitely worth the wait. Why, last night Chef's Rose & Taylor had a wonderful Seafood Chowder on the menu that was simply amazing. First of all, it was huge! You could very easily share this with another person and walk away satisfied. It had all the fixings of their Cioppino, except it was in this creamy, white sauce that went straight to the soul. \nI highly recommend ordering oysters when you dine here. They tend to have a small selection of premium oysters. Which, to me is a good thing. Three or four of the highest quality oysters should be enough for any discerning gourmand or glutton. We did a sample of each variety and needless to say, every single one of them were as fantastic as they were different. Great Selection! \nAnother reason that I love this little restaurant is that they let you bring your own wine, beer etc. NO CORKAGE FEE! That is really cool. And when you finish what you brought in, order wine from the menu. They have a decent selection of beers and wines to choose from. \nI really do love this place.

Normally I would not review a place like this after one visit but this was exceptional.\n\nWe ordered a bowl of clam chowder and some muscles.  The clam chowder was fine, but the muscles were clearly not fresh.  They just tasted off.  They were soft, stale and fishy.  We politely sent them back.  \n\nThe first server didn't seem surprised but was polite and apologetic.  The second servier went back and told the kitchen.  Unfortunately for them, there are no walls between the kitchen and the counter where we heard the \"chef\" say \"yea, they aren't fresh.  I don't have any fresh ones\". \n\nEveryone was apologetic but no one was surprised.  To think the that they knew how bad that food was (shell fish no less) and sent it out anyway.  Clearly, this was more the norm than the exception.  \n \nAgain, I rarely would give an institution like this a bad review when it could have been an off night but clearly they knew exactly what they were doing and have done it frequently.

Heirloom tomato salad was nice appetizer to share.\n     No verbal pressure to leave, but did notice some stern glances from staff and people waiting while our group was chatting for a bit after the bill and the table was bussed, but left a decent tip so I guess they didn't mind.\n    Mike was friendly and great.

From the show, I thought the place was bigger. Anyway, when we walked by while looking for a place to eat - I remembered and knew we had to go inside.  More importantly, it was near empty!  We had our choice of seats at the counter or table - how can we turn that down?  \n\nThe place is quite small - about 8 stools at the counter and probably 6 tables of 4? That will explain the long waits.  Actually, we got in at the right time (about 3ish-4pm) because the crowds grew and there was a wait by the time we left.  \n\nWe weren't super hungry and we still want to save our stomach to snack at other places.  So we ordered a cup of chowder ($4.95) and one of the day's special - fish stew ($18.95).  \n\nThe cup of chowder was tasty and not very thick.  The bags of oyster crackers they have were great, not salty like others.  You can eat them alone - we did!  The fish stew was very generous with 2 prawns, clams, mussels and many pieces of cod.  The sauce was a mixture of tomato sauce w/ chicken broth - tasty but a little on the salty side.  It came with 2 large thick pieces of garlic bread - it was so good that I stuffed myself with it even though I was full.  \n\nThey still wash their dishes, pots, pans...etc. the old fashioned way - by hands!  If you sit at the counter, you'll see the busy man cleaning away.  \n\nIf in the area, we will definitely visit this joint again.", "author": "Gloria H."}

Well, after sampling the oysters at each of these establishments I must say that Anchor is worthy of competing with the big boys. The oysters were fresh, delectable, and  priced accordingly. I very much enjoyed their unique seafood salad, these guys went out on a limb and steered clear of the traditional iceberg and mayo situation and presented me with a mixed petite greens salad with bits of carrot and celery and topped it off with their own creamy garlic salad dressing, which was am-ahhhh-zing!

The seafood was fresh and plentiful. The garlic bread was toasted just right. The man who served us ( think he was the owner) brought us more regular bread to scoop up any remaining juices. We ate it up and enjoyed every bite. The restaurant is small, about 6 tables and 5 bar stools, so get there early. We thought the service was good. Please be aware that this gentlemen not only took orders, but cleaned tables, and rung up our bills, so service might not be super fast. He was very friendly to us - we told him we were 1st timers.

They were not overdone and came in a wonderful seafood broth that had a hint of tomato and a mild kick to it.  The broth was so good that I decided to take the leftover broth home and use it as a base to make cioppino.\n   The bay shrimp-stuffed artichoke served as a large appetizer for multiple people, and was wonderfully cooked.\n   We had a special bottle of Chateau de Sancerre that really complimented the seafood well.\n\nFood Cons- \n   My wife's mahi-mahi was a tad overcooked, although the green salsa verde that it came with was intensely flavorful and we both ate it with the roast potatoes and bread.\n\nOther notes- \n   The chowder was tasty, although it did not really stand out.\n   They do not take reservations, and there will be a wait, even at 9pm on a Wednesday night.

Thankfully, my experience at Anchor Oyster Bar was not one of those moments.\n\nOn our first visit we were seated at the bar and had the clam chowder, the half Anchor Special, and the crab cake appetizer.  The chowder was nice and thick - creamy and buttery, oysters super fresh and cold, clam broth buttery as well, and chilled prawns huge and meaty.  The crab cakes aren't really worth mentioning, but I'm not a huge fan of crab cakes in the first place.\n\nOn our second visit we had a party of six and were seated at the bar again.  The server was apologetic about the hour wait and gave us a few orders of garlic bread on the house.  We split two full Anchor Specials among us for appetizers and each of us got an entree as well.  I went with one of the specials, a wild coho salmon which was served in a creamed vegetable stock with baby carrots and fingerling potatoes.  It ended up being more of a pot pie filling than a simple sauce, which was unexpected, but rather welcoming.  Another special was breaded scallops served on top of a bed of mashed potatoes - the scallops were really fresh.\n\nIf you go with the steamed clams or mussels, butter up some bread, break it up, and throw it in the broth to soak up while you eat the shellfish.  The Caesar salad looked really good, so the next time I go for lunch, I'll give that a shot.  I'm glad they don't serve dessert as it gave us an excuse to take a 10 minute stroll down to Bi-Rite for some ice cream :)\n\nService was spectacular both times - our water glasses were always full and the servers were really attentive without being overbearing.\n\nIt's nice having an oyster bar nearby instead of having to make the trek over to Swan or Hog Island.", "author": "Allen L."}

The only drawback is the service is a little slow and if the place is packed you may wait awhile for a table but if you like seafood this is the place to be.", "author": "Jason C."}

The oysters arrived artfully arranged on a bed of ice with cocktail sauce and fresh horseradish. Even the garnish of seaweed was beautiful. The horseradish raised the cocktail sauce to new heights. I prefer it to the vinegar stuff served at other oyster places. The oysters were sweet and delicate. The clam chowder was good and wasn't that thick gloppy stuff. Oyster crackers were readily available. The crab cakes were chock full of crab - not too much bread crumbs. All that and a glass of white wine was the perfect amount.

There were also some people trying to cheat and move their names up ahead of others and the other (there are 2) waiter was on it! Re-wrote everyones name in the right order and went back into the bustling restaurant to bring out food to patrons. I was fairly impressed as it's often hard for me to speak on the phone and tie my shoes at the same time.\n\nThe only drawback was the wait and the fact that there are no reservations accepted  for this place.

I didn't tell him that I don't like mollusks/bivalves/whatever you want to call them - I didn't want to break his heart because he seemed excited to go to Anchor Oyster Bar!

I got the \"crab burger\" with a side of clam chowder soup (salad what?).  The waiter nicely explained all of the daily specials in detail, so I knew what to expect with the crab burger...which is that it's actually more like lump crab meat mixed together in a tartar sauce on a bun - not a crab cake on a bun (which he made sure to mention since I'm sure many people expect that).  The crab burger was so good - a nice, light (just the right amount of tartar sauce - not like a McDonald's Filet o' Fish) lunch.  The clam chowder was also tasty.  Other things on the menu of daily specials included a fish stew (which another friend devoured) and a stuffed sole (which Tom K seemed to enjoy also).  Daily specials ranged from ~$14 to ~$18 (most included a choice of soup or salad).  The standard menu is a bit spartan, but definitely enough for anybody who enjoys seafood - I'll have to go back for the crabcakes.  \n\nThe kitchen is tiny, and they do a great job making fabulous food in a tiny space.

They grab them out of a vat of ice, shuck'em, and serve them with a wedge of lemon. All in under 30 seconds. Best oysters I've ever had and that is not the afterglow of a drunken haze.

As someone who is a chef themselves, I go out of my way to visit anchor oyster because they manage to do the elusive:  serve simple dishes so fucking tasty that it is impossible to recreate.  I know food, and I know how to cook and I cannot replicate the dishes they serve.  You will wait.  You will stand in a line.  Go when they first open at 3 for easy service.  Order the special.  If not that, order the cioppino.  It is not on the menu, but the serve it on request.  It's about $30, but is the best god-damned seafood dish you will ever eat.  It's so good, it's unholy", "author": "christine h."}

We sampled all of the daily specials, though I have a special place in my heart for kumamotos - which were huge! (They are small oysters, but Anchor had ones that were bigger than usual.) They offer a variety of seafood options from clam chowder to seafood salad to seafood platters. They have a variety of beers and wines to complement each dish, though let's be honest, nothing beats oysters and champagne. \n\nThe server was super helpful and offered oyster combos not on the menu.

I noticed a lot of people wrote their name down and then went walking around for an hour and made it back in time for their turn. This place has only 6 tables and about 6 seats at the bar. Another thing I noticed was that the people who came between 9-9:30pm were seated faster because the crowd was less and by that time most people finished their meal. While we were waiting outside one of the servers brought everyone some clam chowder. That was so nice and yum! Also, because we waited about two hours to be seated the chef came out and brought us delicious garlic bread on the house and told us thank you. All the employees here were very friendly.\n\nNow my thoughts on the food- my husband and I had eyes bigger than our stomaches but we couldn't resist. We came all the way from San Diego and this was our first time. We ordered fried oysters, crab cakes, anchor special and 1/2 dungennes crab. I was seriously in a food coma after eating all this food. Fried oysters was the special for the night so if it's there when u go I highly recommend it. The tartar sauce went perfectly with it. Crab cakes were OK but it isn't a must have. I would pass on these next time. They were small and I tasted more of the fried batter than the crab. The anchor special was yummylicious! It came with three types of oysters, clams, muscles and shrimp. Everything was so flavorful and fresh. The oysters and shrimp were served cold and the clams and muscles came in this delicious sauce. The sauce was flavored with garlic, tomatoes, and a whole bunch of wonderful secret seasonings. The dungennes crab is not always in season but if it's there when you go you just have to try it. We ordered it hot and it was sooo good! The crab was cooked in garlic, butter, pepper and other seasonings that just made it sooo tasty. The crab was soft and almost melted in your mouth. There were nice chunky pieces too. \n\nNext time, I want to order the Cioppino. It's not on the menu so you just have to ask for it. I didn't find out about it until the end when I saw other locals ordering it. Apparently it's a very popular dish and it looked really delicious too!\n\nWe chatted with one of the employees and he said that the owner does the cooking on Friday and Saturday nights. It's great to go to restaurants where the owners do the cooking and are managing their restaurant. You know you are going to a good place when the owner does the cooking. It definitely showed in the dishes we ate.", "author": "akemi a."}

And because God likes gay people and, particularly, black-latina lesbians who are hunting for ciopinno, this place, which was already on my list, was a front seat to the gay bachanal on Castro street.  It's kind of a seafood diner: metal tables, counter service with rotating stools.  We signed up on the waitlist outside the door and then sat for a bit on the bench in front the place.  The restaurant is too small to wait inside. (Which was okay by me because it gave me a chance to take some pics of Harvey Milk's camera shop which is next door) But once inside, service was completely on point.  The ciopinno which I sought, is not on the menu. You must ask them to make it for you, which they will. Our table was right by the open kitchen so I could see the chef preparing the food. And then it came, loaded with mussels and clams and crab, a lemony tomatoey herbey base which was fantastic with the garlic bread that was served with the dish.  Certainly big enough for two.  Both my friend and I wanted to pay with credit cards.  The manager was kind enough to allocate the correct amounts to our separate credit cards. Nice. I will definitely be back.", "author": "Gail D."}

My own fault?\n- Jumbo prawn: love that cocktail sauce with hot mustard\n\nAll in all, I think the service was great but the food was just on par. Oh, about that glass of wine that I had.

I was seated on the oyster bar, and lucky to next to two super cute guys who are obviously so in love with each other. They strongly recommend the pan roasted crab with garlic, so added the crab to Anchor Special (6 oysters+cocktail prawns+steamed mussels). And the food was so so good that I wanna thank them for forcing me to order this. After they left, another couple sit down next to me, and the woman ordered scallops that look so divine. She spooned her scallops into my plate and urge me to try. Heavenly delicious!! People eating at this place are just so passion about their food.

I usually eat my food in less than three seconds, but I was slow and savored each and every bite. So damn good.\n\nAnd what's more, my friend that I went with is a regular there and knows the owner, and she brought us out a tray of their garlic bread. \n\nThat was the moment when I drooled and instantly became a fan of this place.

He kept bringing out food that we hadn't ordered insisting that we must try they're signature items.

Is that the norm? To me it's like a bartender leaving lemon seeds in your martini or your margarita....it just SHOULDN'T be done! Take the time to pick out most of them and you'll have happy customers. MAYBE ORDER AGAIN.\nClam Chowder: I heard all the hype and decided to try a cup. I would have to say that I was going to say it was okay but my honey and I saw the waiter pour a container of regular cream into it when it was running low and we decided then and there that it was not great at all. Like many would agree, I'm sure, more goes into clam chowder than just more cream. WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN.\nMy honey's salmon was cooked to perfection with sprigs of rosemary that actually burst in your mouth. The dish also came topped with pancetta slivers, rice and sauteed vegetables. The food, in its entirety, was mouth-watering perfection. What does that mean you ask? Try a whiff of rosemary  bursting on your taste buds only to be thinly coated with the taste of juicy, sweet, meaty salmon as it wars (lovingly) with the taste of pancetta. Next take a little salmon and couple it with a scoop of fresh tasty seasonal vegetables and a fluffy flavorful Basmati rice ending. \n     -JUDGEMENT:\nWould definitely come back again. My honey will be ordering the salmon again (if available), not too sure about oysters as 20 shells is a little too many, clam chowder is out for us.

I'll start with the bad, because the good nearly outweighs it.  The service is slow and often inattentive.  Usually, there is one waiter for the entire joint, which is OK because there are only 5 tables and a 7- or 8-seat oyster bar.  The waiters are particularly bad at keeping an eye on you to see if you're ready for your check, which is incredibly frustrating.\n\nOverall, the food is good.  Not much variety in the menu, but Anchor's philosophy seems to be if it ain't broke, don't fix it.  During oyster season (November through February), their oysters are superb and they routinely rotate through about 4 different types from day to day.  The Boston Clam Chowder is always good, as is their open-face crab and cheese sandwich.  While salads are generally bland, adding fish of some sort to the mix improves them.  And their crab cakes, which can vary wildly in quality (density, moisture, and toasted-ness) are usually a safe bet and well worth it when they  are made well.  Don't bother with the prawn or miniature shrimp cocktails -- incredibly overpriced and the mini prawns taste like they came out of a can.\n\nIf you can stand slow, inattentive service, it's a fine place to have lunch.", "author": "Andrew L."}

Or, different menu items but really just compositions of stuff in different orders....eg: on round 2, i'll take the caesar salad sans crab but can i have a crab cocktail please (as opposed to the casesar with crab, you know).\n\nHighlights:\n\nWARM CROUTONS.  so simple.  soooo good.  excellent caesar dressing.  they are not familiar with the term \"lightly dressed\".  not super surprising.\n\nA lotta crab and good (even if this is out of season and hell, maybe it's canned - it did make me buy a can today to test it out), even for a very reasonable price.\n\nGood horseradish plopped in the cocktail sauce; you can ignore the blob or mix it in.\n\nSinful garlic bread.  Enough has been written about this but in short, i concur.  The bread tastes SO much better as a crouton or as the garlic stuff vs. cold 'n raw.  \n\nClam chowder with oyster crackers in an abalone shell.  Keeping it real\n\nCrab cakes - mostly crab - what a surprise!  they don't seem to run out\n\nAnd last but NOT least, the ONLY regulation \"3 sink\" clean up kitchen I've seen in a SF restaurant!  Yeah!  You can feel good about eating here, even if you DO have to interrupt the cook in order to get to the bathroom.", "author": "Laurie A."}

I took my parents here for the first time earlier this year (living around the corner after four-years, I finally had a reason to take someone there)...and we all fell in love with this place immediately.  It was a busy night, so we kept getting served free garlic bread you'll never want to turn down...its probably the most amazing carbohydrate one's palette will ever come across.  I had the opportunity to dip my garlic bread in the broth from my mothers mixed-shellfish plate, and it was to DIE.  My kale/yam stuffed ravioli topped with crab was seriously the best thing on a menu found in the Castro.  You can tell it was freshly made that day and the sauce was as equally as divine as the broth from my mother's Cippiono-style dish.  I seriously could have drank it like it water, its just THAT good. This truly is a gem that surprisingly finds itself situated in the Castro, where most food establishments are less than mediocre.  But once you put any food in your mouth, it's no wonder they've been around for decades.  Their specials vary daily, so I truly enjoy a place who can mix up their fare on the daily (you know they pride themselves on their food), and you'll always be stuck on which one you should order.  Don't worry, either choice will leave you thinking you made the best decision.\nThe most amazing part about this restaurant is that it also doubles as a fish market!  Yes, you can buy their daily fresh catches and take them home to prepare yourself a meal.  Isn't that grand or what!?  If you find yourself wandering in the Castro one night, thinking seafood is the way you want to go come here to enjoy.  But try to come early as the wait can get a bit long for dinner (the place is tiny, yet the nautical atmosphere is what keeps you in here).  Its definitely worthwhile!  The service is efficient, one waiter, yet backed up with individuals cleaning and bringing you items.  That truly makes a place shine in my eyes.", "author": "Boho H."}

Here's the deal...it is a small place - and I do mean small...however, that is part of it's charm. Plan on waiting...there is not a place to wait inside...so plan on waiting outside...and there are no street heaters, so it can get cold.  If that is a problem for you, then try it on a warm night...but the wait, the cold - it is all worth it.\n\nThe food is amazing and the waitstaff are completely friendly.  What to try?  First, check out the specials board hanging above the bar.  That will be what is fresh, in season and unique.  If you want to order off the traditional menu, try the shrimp or crab salad or the steamed combo.  One thing that is a must try is the cioppino.  It is not on the menu...any of the...but it is over the top!  If crab is not in season...ask for the fisherman's stew...is the cioppino without the crab, but just as amazing!  Both come with this out of this world garlic bread (and ask for a bib...you will need it).\n\nThe prices aren't cheap, but with the quality of the food and the huge portions the value more than makes up for it.

This place deserves no stars. Food took about and hour or so to come out and everything was cold. Clam chowder PLAIN oyster dirty full of dirt and shell, garlic bread 2/10. Clams HORRIFIC. No flavor nothing tasted like a catch from the ocean and straight to our plate. Would not recommend this place.

Now onto the cracked crab.  This was the whole reason the husband and I decided to have an mid-afternoon seafood extravaganza!  We wanted to taste local SF crab in the peak of crab season.  The options were $22 for half a cracked crab or $29 for a whole cracked crab.  Ummmm, really?!?!  Of course we're getting the whole crab!  It also comes with a cup of their clam chowder which the waiter was sweet enough to upgrade to a bowl for us.  Also, unfortunately, by the time we got there, the chef had already cleaned the crabs for all the gooey good ness under the shell which I personally love (crab butter) but I guess my cholesterol level will have to thank him for that.  The garlic butter that the crab came in was delish.  I had to put salt in it since I'm a salt fiend but it was great with the crab.  But there was a ton of crab!  Great value.  The only thing was that the crab didn't have that somewhat sweet taste that you get when you're really lucky.  Apparently the crab this season was not at it's peak but still pretty darn good.  We'll be back before the next year to see how next season is!\n\nThe one issue is that parking in the area is a bummer.  Also the wait can get kind of long as it got much more crowded by the time we left so just make sure to go early!", "author": "Susan L."}

I'm going to keep this as simple as the food and surroundings of this restaurant. \n\nPros: \n- Service has been all over the place from outstanding to nearly perfect. OK. It has been perfect each time I've gone. The entire staff is attentive and smooth.  \n- The crab cakes are light and do nothing to mask the flavor - the light breading, lemon wedge and dill dressing on the side enhance the sweet but firm pieces of crab meat. Do not threaten the crab cakes with physical violence like I did on Sunday. \n- The bread is not for everyone - don't order it unless you're a fan of all things having to do with garlic, butter and (just a touch of) melted cheese. \n- The clam chowder is delicate while but holding together - many clam chowders tend to break up as you eat them. Not here. The last bite was as good as he first. The clams melted in my mouth.\n- Caesar salad - not a meek salad. Strong hints of citrus and crisp romaine are balanced with fresh home made croutons.\n- Crab/ Shrimp cocktails - Both were simple and outstanding - although the crab meat has been a notch above the shrimp.\n- Black and green mussels - if you have ordered anything else above besides the bread, don't even try it. These dishes managed to have a huge taste of butter, wine and garlic going perfectly hand in hand with the tender and flavorful mussels. It seemed like the bowl was filled with more mussels than seemed appropriate. These dishes paired with the garlic bread will keep True Bleeders and Twilighters away. Ordered together, the bread and mussels inspired awe and self loathing when I realized that it was difficult to finish and more difficult to send back the unfinished portion. \n- Oh yeah - the oysters. We have had oysters there for desert. Simply perfect.\n\nCons:\n- The Anchor Stem has malfunctioned every time we've gone - I had to find something that wasn't completely perfect.\n- There are too many people who like this place. Wait- is that even a con? Maybe everyone can come here during the week and leave it to us for the weekends? Any takers?\n\nI recommend you stay away. On the weekends. Or if you see my GF and I walking in, would you at least hurry up and get on out as quickly as possible? We are there for a beautiful meal, thanks.", "author": "Jason S."}

I even got rave reviews from some friends on their seafood.  Finally I cleared my bank account on my day off, went into Anchor and ordered myself a fresh dungeness crab meat sandwich with a cup of clam chowder.  The chowder came and it was hot which is a good sign.  A couple spoonful confirmed that either the chef had a cold or he forgot his salt and pepper.  It was a creamy concoction of diced vegetable and chopped clams.  Then the long awaited \"fresh\" crab meat sandwich arrived.  The crab meat was moist but lack of the sweetness of fresh crab meat (like the one I had at Swan).  In between the buns, there was a piece of lettuce and a slice of tomato.  No cocktail sauce, tartar sauce or even salt and pepper.  Again, with my high blood pressure and high cholesterol, I probably should appreciate that the sandwich did NOT come with any condiment.

Although you will not be disappointed by the freshness of the seafood and near perfect preparation, the wait is long and brutal to get inside this once clothing boutique now turned restaurant if you are not equipped to endure the chilly SF winds.\nExpect to feel like a whale if you are not less than 180lbs in  this restaurant that only seats 30,  expect to overpay, and expect a constantly changing menu in this cramped seafood cove. While certainly enjoyable, the food is definitely not extraordinary nor unique to the point that it should preclude anyone from indulging in SF seafood in a more convenient and comfortable venue.\nThe Food: The Paella ($27) was barely on par with my previous paella experiences, lacking the distinctive saffron fragrance of the dish. While I acknowledge that there is no one recipe for this Spanish classic, Anchor oyster bar is a bit limited in their preparation including only 2 prawns, 5 clams, 10 mussels, 3 crawfish, and sausage- leaving out the peas, tomatoes, chicken and squid you often get at other Spanish restaurants. The halibut ($24) was significantly much more noteworthy. We found it to be tender, flaky, and seasoned with just the right amount of fresh herbs to subtly compliment he natural flavors of the perfectly cooked fish. \nThere is nothing exceptional about their signature chowder which is on the runnier side and lackluster when it comes to flavor. The sourdough is a bit tough, but perfect for sopping up the sauces/broth if you're a carbotarian.", "author": "Vicky V."}

So let me recap: horrendous service, mediocre food, downtown prices.  Absolutely avoid this place.  The staff is unfriendly, incompetent, and has attitude to spare.", "author": "Roger S."}

I had the excellent fortune of walking by here on one of the first warm weekends of 2006, so my wife and I dropped in and ordered a $25!!! salad. It was worth it though. Loaded with fresh crab meat and shrimp, it was just perfect for two people on a warm day in the Castro. And the waiter, I think maybe owner? really made us feel welcome. Clean and classy; everything about this place is just very well balanced. It could become a regular for us. Highly recommended!", "author": "Johnny O."}

I was recommended this place by a few trusted san francisco foodies for a trip that I just took there. We were told to order their daily specials off the chalk board that change constantly. When we got there we discovered that they apparently have free corkage, so we went in a desperately quick search for a bottle of wine, but to no avail. Although neither me nor my partner like oysters  very much, but we decided to order a half order of the anchor special- 6 different types of oysters- from BC, oregon, and somewhere else, clams in a delicious garlicy broth, and 2 huge prawns. I may be missing some of it... Anywho, We decided to order off the chalk board. I got spinach and ricotta ravioli w/ dungeness crab meat, and my partner got some of the best scallops ive ever had. Perfectly cooked, seasoned, and served with delightful mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. This place is small, but if you can make it here, I recommend it!

I went there last Saturday and they were obviously having an off night. Usually the service is great, not tonight. It was extremely slow, our waiter seemed irritable and our food showed up in a strange order, oysters came after dinner and the salad came last? Anyway, the oysters were fresh as usual, but they were almost inedible because of the amount of shell in them. The garlic bread was burnt and the bread and butter I ordered never showed up at all. I do have to say their seafood specials off the board are outstanding, and the clam chowder is great too. Don't miss the oyster shooters either.

There is a bar/counter, which is great for singles as well as couples, 2 small tables and 3 larger tables for groups. You can choose whatever makes you more comfy but would just recommend avoiding peak hours during week-end because this place is very popular and doesn't need advertisements.\n\nFood: Don't hesitate to express what you like / would like to try because the servers would have the perfect food and wine pairing recommendations for you (as long as you don't expect the wine to be super fine/sophisticated)...I tried the oysters (and was not even found of oysters to begin with), the mussels as well as different fishes. Each time, it savored my shellfish/fish until the last bite. Portions are generous so I always order a 1/2 portion of mussels or oysters to start with\n\nService: Fun, friendly, knowledgeable, prompt (without being too fast either), attentive to details and to you!

We sat at the bar and I already knew what I wanted...Oysters. So I ordered three shooters. The waitress suggested I try a shooter with soju, so I said what the heck I am daring and love alcohol. Oh man what a bad idea. I first of all must of ordered it wrong because I just wanted a plain oyster with lemon, but I figured why not continue on with the adventure. I ate the first oyster with a bloody Mary kind of liquid and it was good. Then I decided I was going to try the bloody Mary soju one. It went down horrible and there was some shell in it, which ruined it even more. I almost threw up, but I decided I would be polite and swallow it. The bill for the three oysters came out to $13.

I also liked the steamed clam, it came in this very tasty broth, awesome for dipping the bread in. The clam chowder wasn't sandy and tasted pretty good. We also ordered the baked red snapper which was baked with a dijon mustard with some broiled veggies. I would have liked the red snapper more if it didn't have the dijon mustard but that's just because I like my fresh fish with as little sauce on it. It was still very good.

So I would presume it to be 5 stars. My wife and I went there about 6 months ago, which left us with the impression that S.F. is a culinary city with the best quality seafood, hand-picked by the chefs, rather than a bulk buying chain restaurant. I had the special Rosemary Wild Alaskan Salmon and Pancetta. Outstanding taste, texture, and flavor. I have had rosemary on a salmon dish before, but the initial experience left me with the impression that rosemary was just too strong. This time, the rosemary was roasted just so that it popped with the perfect essence, but not too overpowering. Salmon was just barely crusted and medium in the center with no fishy taste whatsoever. Pancetta was the perfect compliment to the texture and flavor of the salmon. The atmosphere is a little cramped with a feeling of being \"right in the kitchen\" while your food is being prepared. Lots of white tile. Also, I know how New-England clam chowder should be, because my grandfather made it in R.I. This place uses WAY too much cream and potatoes. If any of you working there reads this, you need more clam broth, the soup tastes too milky. However, the salmon was the dish. My wife had the mahi-mahi with mango salsa. That was light and fluffy. Very pleasing to the palette. A great place to go with your special someone, or with a couple of friends that want great food to go with that conversation.", "author": "Edward B."}

Too many bodies behind the counter, not enough service to the customers.\n\n We ordered all that was recommended: \n\n1. 2 Oyster shooters - very good! I've never had oyster shooters before and the spiciness was just right.  \n2. i bowl of Clam Chowder - heavenly.  Fresh ingredients and just the right creaminess.  We should have ordered one bowl each.\n3. 1 order of Crab cakes appetizers (2)- The BEST crab cakes I've ever eaten- EVER.  We should have ordered more!\n4. 6 oysters on a half shell- good, but SMALL.  I suppose since the types of oysters available are typically small, they were good, but I prefer the meatier ones.  About $2.50ea is a little pricey for oysters that are the size of a quarter.\n5. Garlic bread- average.

I have yet to find fresher fish, oysters or crab in the city, and I love their clam chowder - pasta's are always changing and delicious.  Not cheap, but you can't get better quality food.  Fun, friendly and efficient servers add to the experience.  This place rocks!", "author": "Mike P."}

Since it is my review, I would say 3.5. The wait for this place was pretty short considering they have around a 25-30 person capacity, and there were 10 people waiting outside. The servers seated us quickly, but then abandoned us. They brought us the beginning bread and waters, and then we chatted for about 10 mins until we noticed that no one was coming to take our order. Two or three servers kept coming to our table to take or present things, so I never knew who to flag down for an order. Our crab cake appetizer was pretty good, but the wait between dishes was lonngggg. My shrimp and mussel dish was very good and hence the reason for my 4 stars, but my gf's fish was very heavy and the mashed potatoes were too buttery....She's not a heavy food kind of person. The whole meal contained enough starch and lipids that we decided to forgo the dessert(almost never happens). \n\nPros: Awesome shrimp and mussel, good crab cakes, Fast Seating. \n\nCons: Lonnnng server wait, pretty pricey, and mediocre fish with mashed potatoes. Over hyped.", "author": "Chris D."}

Recently I have had occasion to go there twice and had a great time on both occasions.  The first time two friends and I had some oysters, beer and grilled fish.  The service is attentive but rather casual and the food was nicely prepared.  On the second visit -- during our recent heat wave - a friend and I had to wait outside while a table opened up.  A server brought us a couple of frosty Anchor Steams as we waited.  Once inside we made the wise decision to select the cold mixed fish salad -- an excellent mix of very fresh salmon, clams, muscles, lobster, calamari, crayfish and more.  The fish is fresh and creatively prepared.  I will be back soon!", "author": "J. O."}

I go for the oysters, obviously and what ever special they have to offer. It's small but I seem to fit with another guest. The manager is always present, which is a good sign and they have someone at the front HAND washing dishes which is a rare sight. I mean I am so anal and type A it's not even funny so when I see this I am confident that I am not eating or drinking......well you know. I appreciate that. I mention it for obvious reasons, but not only that, whomever is there doing the dish washing at the time looks like they are peaceful and serene in their own world. If that makes any sense. It's at their own pace and it gives me something to focus my eyes on while indulging in some damn good seafood. It's not a hustle an bustle sweat shop line. Everything flows here  and the staff work nicely together and even the customers are all good with one another. I like it a lot! PS: Don't cheat yourself and order at least 18 oysters per person,  if you don't you will be annoyed and feel cheated even though it's no one's fault but your own.", "author": "S. L."}

They gave me a variety of six different oysters from around the world, each with different texture and taste.  They flowed into my mouth like velvty, melted butter.  The prawns were amazing in the spicy cocktail sauce.  The clams in garlic base were out of this world.  I asked for more bread to soak up the goodness.  The bread was a meal in itself.  I combined that with a small salad, which was fresh and crispy.  The staff really were responsive to our every need and advised about what to select.  As we were finishing, the place started to get full with patrons and the ambiance of the restaurant got really too crowded and noisy.  Getting to the restroom is a bit tricky, especially when you have to dodge quick turning waiters, fast moving chefs and a bunches of patrons looking for a seat.  The bathroom was stupendously clean.  I'd definitely go back to try some of their specials, but I'd make sure to go early for dinner.  The place get uncomfortably crowded after about 7:30pm.", "author": "Neil F."}

The clam chowder is wonderful, and the array of oysters was very good.  A bit pricey, but worth it if you're fussy about your bivalves.  The only criticism with the place is they don't keep enough oysters on hand.  We arrived at 7pm, and they were already sold out of the big ones!! Drat.  Nice choice of a French Sancerre wine to accompany was very tasty, but a bit pricey too at $40.", "author": "Susan B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-25", "description": "Just went to this place for the second time - one of my favorite seafood places in SF.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that you have to be willing to wait a while (20-30 min cause the place is tiny), but it's totally worth waiting.  They also brought out some clam chowder for those of us waiting outside in the cold, so the wait wasn't that bad at all.  The seafood is super fresh and deliciously prepared - simple and bold flavors.  The restaurant is also very flexible if you have any dietary restrictions (i.e. if you're pregnant and can't eat certain seafood) - they made me a delicious pasta dish that was totally tailored just for me.  The hubby had some cioppino (tomato broth with lots of seafood) with crazy amounts of mussels, clams, fish, crab - it's definitely enough for 2 people, so I would recommend sharing as we took a lot of leftovers home (which were delicious on day 2).  The service is also great - super fast and very pleasant.  If you like a place with character & delicious seafood, this is definitely a place to checkout.", "author": "squirrel l."}

We got the Anchor Special with a dozen oysters (4 different kinds), steamed clams and chilled prawns.  The oysters were so fresh and delicious!  The texture, temperature, taste - ALL to my liking.  I know some places, their oysters are a little salty for some reason, but here, it was as if they had just picked them out of the ocean, shucked them and served them.  The steamed clams were also very good.  I think just steamed with a little pit of garlic and some other seasonings.  Not too overpowering - you could still taste the actual clam.  The chilled prawns weren't bad either.  We got crabcakes as well, which were also very good.  All in all, highly recommended.", "author": "Sam C."}
