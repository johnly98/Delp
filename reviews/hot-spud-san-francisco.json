Baked potatoes are my #1 underrated food, and a restaurant dedicated to them sounded excellent! Unfortunately, the reality wasn't as good as the idea.\n\nThe restaurant seemed run-down, first of all. The fake wood paneling was super dated, and the table my friend and I sat on wobbled like crazy every time we took a bite. I suppose that fits the touristy vibe of Fisherman's Wharf pretty well, but it's not what I was looking for.\n\nI got a sausage spud because sausage is the best meat and was super underwhelmed. The potato was tasteless (even as potatoes go) and the veggies, while fine on their own, really didn't go with it. The sausage was sort of cold and not very tasty either, and there weren't nearly enough green onions for a potato of this size (though I'm the sort of guy who orders extra extra green onions on his ramen, so take that how you will).\n\nIt also seemed mostly if not entirely unseasoned. Baked potatoes need a healthy dose of salt and pepper at the very least, and I expected a potato specialty shop like this to innovate on top of that.\n\nIt gets a second star solely for potential. Hot Spud is an excellent idea, but the execution was far, far off-base.", "author": "Shawn W."}

Sure it may be a small chain, but the pre-set options combined with the \"make it your own\" bar make it an excellent alternative from the food traps in the Wharf. \n\nThe restaurant also boats a large cooler of drinks, including wine and beer.

I passed by this place on New Year's Day; this time, I came in here to buy a one big jacket potato, just like a baked potato I used to have in Sizzler's, but even bigger for lunchtime.  My stuffed jacket potato I quickly ordered was the Veggie Spud.  I liked to assume my choice of having greens in my spud relate to what's uncontrollably growing out of the big potato in a make up sci-fi movie, a perfect creation for my taste spud.  I chose Alfredo sauce, but that's fine if I end up with a scoop of sour cream unto my Veggie Spud; as long as everything is delicious.

I live in Hayes Valley and will make the trek to touristy wharf just for this! For me it's worth it.

Even better.. the basics are included (butter, salt, cheese, etc.). \n\nI typically reserve 5 stars for extraordinary experiences. I would like to give this place 4.5 stars but since I can't and it's been such a favorite spot for years it deserves a stellar review. \n\nI usually get butter, salt and pepper, cheese, scallions, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, bacon, sour cream, and occasionally will add either peas, corn, steak, shrimp, or Alfredo sauce.

The competitive dining environment as well as the enormous food choices in the city, mean that if an establishment is not delivering a high quality product, it will not be long before the word gets out, and the eatery will either improve or fold. Hot Spud gets that all to well. A cozy location blocks from the pier means it sees a lot of foot traffic, but being just off the pier, it can be missed.

They have about 5 or 6 baked potato combos or you can customize your own. If you create your own, it will start at about $7.50.

After a little searching, I found Hot Spud. \n\nThe good: Hot Spud is super cheap, has tons of toppings, and the food is great. If you ever find yourself dining with a vegetarian or gluten-free person, it's a great place to go because there are tons of options that suit those diets. They're also very generous with toppings, and portions are large enough for all but the biggest gluttons.\n\nThe bad: Since it's right by the Embarcadero, you can be super close and still need 20 minutes to navigate around all the tourists and get into a parking spot. I got lucky once and found a metered spot, but on my second trip we ended up using a paid lot. It was $5 for every 30 minutes, and it took us about 20-25 minutes to eat and get back to the car.\n\nThe restaurant was also really dirty both times we went. Tables and counters just didn't seem to get wiped down quickly after people used them, and there was a garbage smell wafting in the door that was a little gross. If you're concerned about dirty tables, bring a wet wipe or dampen a napkin. \n\nThe desserts were also not terribly appetizing, maybe because it's harder to bake good gluten-free desserts. They just looked dried out. On the other hand, if you're gluten-free and used to not having many dessert options, you might think they're great.\n\nIt might sound like I have way more negatives than positives, but I do feel like the food and insanely cheap prices outweigh the bad stuff.

I had bacon in mine which I'm not sure if they added in on accident but it was a nice addition. My bf had the steak spud and he loved it. I wish this place wasn't so far so I could frequent it more often.

Now that I am gluten free, this concept is the best idea since sliced bread (all puns intended).\n\nHot spud serves 100% gluten free baked potatoes in a variety of styles to match your craving. Chicken, steak, or veggie style they have multiple ways to satisfy your hunger. You can also make your potato to order interactively picking and choosing your toppings from the several meats and vegetables they have for toppings.\n\nThe staff here was very efficient and quickly assembled my order of 3 potatoes. \n\nI recommend the chicken.  It had a touch of spicy buffalo sauce that added the perfect kick.\n\nI'm very happy I stopped in for dinner and can't wait until they start opening some of these locations on the east coast.

Someone cooks a rather large potato, splits it open lengthwise, adds cheese, veggies, meat, and some type of sauce. A gourmet baked potato. Sounds good, right? So then why was this place such a disappointment?

I've been a loyal customer from the day they first opened their doors. I've probably consumed about 200 spuds since then. I'm an addict. They are my spud dealer. I've managed to cut my spud consumption down to about one a week, but the temptation is always there. I never thought I could love potatoes as much as I do. These are NOT your ordinary baked potatoes though.... \n\nMy favorite spud is the shrimp spud. It has Cheese, butter olives, corn, and onions. I add warm saut\u00e9ed Mushrooms. It is topped with perfectly grilled shrimp. The key ingredient is the Chipotle sauce. I've tried to make this sauce at home and I just can't. It's the most creamy blend of deliciousness. There is a mixture of spicy, little sweet and a dash of lemon. I've reached the point where I request an extra cup on the side. I scrape that spud clean and basically drink the remaining sauce. Like I've said, I am an addict.  \n\nI also like the ambiance. It's perfect for eating alone or eating with a group. The music playing is always a good beat and the colors are cheerful. The staff is awesome. I just feel good going there and it's an overall great experience. \n\nSo if you're wondering whether or not you should check out Hot Spud, I urge you to do so. Just not between 11:30 and 12:00 on the weekdays because that's when I get my fix and I don't want to wait on a long line. ;) ENJOY!\n\nP.S. You get a discount as a local.", "author": "Daisy F."}

It wasn't packed, but there were people dining which made it a little difficult to find a seat. \n\nFirst off, there are SO many options to choose from, so you will definitely not be disappointed. I opted to make my own potatoes with bacon, cheese, sour cream, chives, corn and a side of alfredo sauce. My boyfriend got the cheese, steak, and sour cream potato with a side of chipotle sauce. The lady who took our orders was super sweet and she even suggested what sauces we should get with our potatoes since all of them were made in house. The wait time was about 10 minutes for a potatoes which wasn't bad.\n\nThe potato was baked to perfection! Earlier, I saw one of the employees mashing/mixing the potato which I found odd, but I soon realized that he was mixing the cheese into the potato instead of piling it on. The bacon wasn't the best since it was pre made, but it was alright. The alfredo sauce, which I HIGHLY recommend, really took the potato to another level! So perfectly creamy, mm! My boyfriend's steak was so juicy! I found myself scraping the sides of the potato to get the leftovers.. something I rarely do lol.\n\nLove this place! Remember, get the alfredo sauce and the steak!", "author": "Joyce E."}

In general, Hot Spud has a nice concept that's not there yet - if they can retool their recipes a bit, they could be churning out some seriously good-enough-to-create-a-line-on-weds-night comfort food.  \n\nWhile some of the toppings are good, you quickly work your way down to a potato with nothing but a huge dollop of butter - basically an unflavored starch-and-fat overload.  It's kind of like eating a cupcake with good frosting but flavorless but fattening cake\n\nI think tweaking the recipe of their \"naked\" potato to have some basics (e.g. Ikes's \"dirty sauce\" or In N Out's \"animal style\" sauce) would help a lot.  The same is true for the veggies which steamed and flavorless - sauteing the veggies and/or adding some seasoning/sauce would make it a much better meal overall.  We all like frosting but it would be nice to eat the whole cupcake.  \n\nOn a positive note, I did like the shrimps, basically a quick saute with salt/pepper garlic - unfortunately they count out exactly 5 smallish shrimp per potato, so the party ends pretty quick.  \n\nAll in all a star for a nice concept and another for friendly staff but minus three for the food - especially since this is likely forming many tourist's impressions of food in SF.

For me a good baked potato is something that is comforting to eat and makes me feel right at home.  The big, fully loaded baked potato I had last night at Hot Spud was delicious and filling.  I ordered the Steak Spud (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JcyoZPdWdhlsrIVEMdLQ2A?select=sFjzFIWKmHn2sD9yoMfuag) which consisted of grilled steak, alfredo sauce, sauteed mushrooms, black olives, peas, corn and green onion.  They started with a big baked Russet, scored it and broke up the inside of the potato with a small metal spatula.  The alfredo sauce was actually created within the hot potato by adding a little salt, some butter then a mound of freshly grated cheese that was carefully mixed into the entire potato using just the spatula.  The hot potato meat cooked the raw ingredients into a nice thickened sauce.  The other ingredients, all pre-cooked, were piled on top and spread throughout.  My potato preparer even threw in a little bit of sour cream.\n\nI ordered my potato with a cup of the daily soup.  For Monday the soup was Shrimp Vegetable (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/JcyoZPdWdhlsrIVEMdLQ2A?select=fyigjwFwcbsTuvV9wy7-cQ).  They have a refrigerator unit full of cold beverages.  Everything from juice drinks to soda or beer and wine is available.  I opted for a complimentary cup of cold H2O stored in the pitchers at the napkin and utensils station.  They even offer discounts if you work in the Fisherman's Wharf area.  I told the gentleman that I didn't qualify because I was actually working out of a North Beach office for the day, and he told me that was close enough and he still gave me the 10 percent off!  I took my food to the big communal table to enjoy.\n\nThe hot soup was delicious.  The clear broth was slightly peppery in flavor and loaded with an assortment of fresh vegetables and lots of baby shrimp.  My potato was outstanding.  I'm pretty certain the potatoes are scrubbed so if you feel like being hearty you can eat these with the skin and all.  The skins were rubbed with some salt though so I just stuck to eating the potato without the skin.  The very generous portion of grilled steak in my potato was lean and tender and all of the flavors just worked very well together.\n\nWhy the half star deduction?  When I finished my meal and went to discard the paper tray, the potato skin, my napkin and the compostable utensils I was shocked not to find a compost bin anywhere.  They only had an area for trash and an area for recycling.  I can't imagine this place generates much trash considering what they serve and the products they serve their food in.  It just bothered me a little to have to toss compostable stuff into the trash bin.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I was a little skeptical, but his surprises are usually lovely, so I figured it'd be alright no matter where we went.\n\nHe took me to Hot Spud. And he was dead on. Because, you see, I have this strange love affair with baked potatoes.\n\nI was introduced to this phenomenon a little late (being Chinese and all, baked potatoes aren't exactly a common choice on the menu), but after I had my first baked potato in high school, I was hooked. Which made Hot Spud an especially wondrous place in my eyes.\n\nThey're this little diner-esque place near the Wharf, but far enough away from the main area that it's not consistently bombarded by tourists. The people there make your food to order and are super nice and informative if you've never been there before. I ordered myself the Sausage Spud and Boyfriend got himself The Wharf (I think). Yummmmmm :9 The potatoes are huge and they literally stuff it gratuitously with the items that you order. I was in spud heaven. I think I only managed to consume about 3/4 of my potato before I had to call it quits or explode from tater-stuffed goodness.\n\nI would, hands down, go back again if I were in the area. I only wish they would branch out from San Francisco and come to the east bay so I could consume them more often :(", "author": "Anna W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-23", "description": "A gluten-free meal! At a real restaurant! Well, it's counter service, but everyone was friendly, and the whole concept of a baked potato shop just makes me gleeful. Since going gluten-free, potatoes have become a staple, and this whole place is pretty safe for even a super-sensitive special snowflake like me. The only things on the menu that aren't GF are the croutons and wonton pieces (although I have to ask, couldn't they get some GF croutons in there instead?), and possibly the Bleu cheese, but I don't care about croutons and I'm vegan & allergic, so I don't care about cheese either.\n\nThey were really cool about the dairy allergy, using separate utensils for my potato. Potatoes start with base toppings of butter, cheese, and salt, and it was easy to get a dairy-free version. I'd called beforehand to ask about dairy-free alternatives to butter and cheese, and was told they weren't selling well enough so they don't serve them any more. Since Earth Balance (vegan butter) and Daiya cheese can both be frozen, I wish they'd change their mind about this. I actually brought my own tiny containers of both with me and they made my potato infinitely better. (Technically I'd call this a 3-star joint, but since I saved my own potato with my own toppings, the experience was one star better.) \n\nBonus points for the black beans offered, because it's hard to get a vegan protein option at most omnivorous restaurants, and nearly all the vegan faux meats are not gluten-free (and never soy-free). Beans are healthy and awesome. Bonus points for corn as a topping, because my partner's favorite (baked or mashed) potato topping is corn. Minus points because my vegetable toppings weren't actually warm. The peas were super cold, and it made most of my potato room temperature. My potato had broccoli (cooked, but not hot), carrots (cooked, room temp), peas, and black beans-- and I apparently got bonus corn, which was also pretty good, just not hot. I'm not sure if that's normal to put cold toppings on a hot potato, but I wish mine had been hot all the way through. It was a chilly foggy day and a warm tater woulda really been a 5 star meal.\n\nThe place wasn't very busy on a Sunday evening, and we didn't have any trouble seating our group of 6. It was a really nice experience. It also wasn't very loud, and it was very clean. There are so few places I can eat without getting sick from gluten contamination that I rarely venture out any more. I can't thank them enough for my safe and tasty experience.\n\nI'll definitely go back (and I don't even mind braving the tourists to go there-- we even got a local discount!), but for this place to really shine, they should consider offering Daiya vegan cheese (cheddar, please!), and soy-free Earth Balance margarine. The cheese can be used straight out of the freezer, and the margarine keeps a very long time in the fridge. The desserts were gluten-free but not vegan. One of the desserts was hazelnut rice pudding, which I'm certain could be made vegan easily. (If you're reading this, Hot Spud, I'd be happy to offer substitution suggestions!) If I could have had a dessert after my potato, that would have seriously rocked my world.", "author": "Jennifer A."}

This place is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! How does this place survive in this area? *easy* its far enough that the tourists go to some crappy highpriced pub instead, but close enough that everyone else knows about it. I could say that this is the Chipoltle of potatoes, but it POWNS Chipoltle.\n\nI'm the type of girl that asks for her indian food spicy. The guy told me that the sauce that comes with the shrimp spud *what i ordered* was alittle on the spicy side and asked me if it was ok- which made it even more ok in my book. The blueberry Izze soda i got to drink overflowed when the guy opened it for me so he got me another 1 even though i told him it was fine. I was about to get up to get my shrimpy potatoe but the guy said kindly he would bring it to me AND whilst eating he asked me if it was ok and if i wanted anymore sauce or anything free of charge. SO...NICE when does this happen anywhere??\n\nThe atmosphere is nice. The guys are even nicer. It reminds me alot of Chipoltles on the inside except without the business-chain awfulness feel. They played alternative and indie music which made things even that much better and calming. \n\nThe shrimp spud was the best potatoe i have ever had! I did not expect much from a potatoe place, this is not like eating a potatoe, i don't know how else to describe it, but its awesome. I hadn't even realized how full i was until i was walking back. For under $8 i was more stuffed than i have ever been on that little in SF probably ever. Idk how they do it- but its SO GOOD. And glutenfree *gluten sensitivities r common* the sauce did have a kick but a delightful 1. I wouldn't say it was spicy persay, i'd say itz exactly how it should be. This place is so amazing and i am even happier i have class down here on Wednesdays, i will so be back!\n\nI was the last person there and i ate extra fast *i typically eat slow* because i didn't want them to wait for me after closing- even though they never pressured me or closed their doors.

Had seen this place in passing before but assume the \"Spud\" in \"Hot Spud\" meant potatoes and not much else.  So when I found the menu on their website included salads, I decided to give it a try, and called in my order for pick-up in a few minutes.  I chose the Thai Crunch Signature Salad with added chicken and it was ready when I walked in.  Told them that I'd liked the fact that it was listed as gluten-free and I love a good salad.  \n\nEmphasis on GOOD salad.  Unfortunately, this one kind of missed the mark a bit.  \n\nWhat missed was flavor in the peanut dressing.  Just wasn't very zippy and seemed tired.  Not enough dressing, either... seems like it was watered down so that the salad ingredients were covered with SOMETHING, but that something seemed very thin and bland.  A dressing should glisten and have real pep.  This wasn't it.  \n\nAlso, the mandarin orange slices were limp and looked like they were old and falling apart.  Too long in the can, perhaps?  I like canned mandarins in my salads at home, but they usually come out of the can firm and plump and flavorful.  These were mushy... not good at all.  \n\nOverall, I give them a 3 (1 for the salad, 1 for the service and 1 for the neighbor discount)... decent service to have it ready in the 5 minutes from the time I called to walk over and pick it up, and overall fresh ingredients in the mix... and plenty of them.  \n\nBut the peanut dressing needs to get REAL and spice it up to a real Thai experience.  If you guys really make your dressings from scratch, try this recipe I use:\n\nhttp://allrecipes.com/recipe/thai-peanut-dressing/\n\nAnd the mandarins should always be checked for firm plumpness when they're taken from the can to the set-up bin.  You'd think those food service supply companies would make sure their #10 cans have fresh product in them.  \n\nOne extra thumbs-up for a 10% \"neighbor discount\" because I work around the corner.  But only a better dressing and fresher mandarins will bring me back for another salad.  Tell me you've done better and I'll definitely be back.  \n\nPotatoes aren't my thing but salads are.", "author": "K.C. F."}

Giant taters with every type of topping, sweet tater pie? Sadly, I was disappointed. Yes, you can have your ginormous spud but seriously the place is an overgrown airport takeaway joint. No ambience at all for the $7 minimum potatoes. You feel like shoving it down as fast as possible and running out along the scenery-less street.  Portions are okay, but I mean a potato costs like $.50c so to say it is cheap is totally going overboard.  The staff is okay, they don't bring things to you, as mentioned it's a takeaway place.", "author": "Colleen H."}

Due to this aversion, I've also been a little skeptical and put off by places that offer \"dressed up\" potatoes. Yes, I'm going to blame THAT on my childhood...because I can....and Yelp therapy is free.\nThat all being said, when you're in cold-ass Fisherman's Wharf with a 3 year old and a fellow Kauaian on a budget; you want something cheap, hot, close to the hotel, close to your parking space, and low-key. This place is AWESOME. I should have also mentioned that all 3 of us are gluten free (okay, so my friend is only SOMETIMES gluten free but still). \nAlana and I each got the chicken spud...it kind of reads like a hot wing...and I LOVE me some hot wings! Cheese, chicken, hot wing sauce, sour cream, olives, corn all atop a generous potato. It was perfect! We also got the sweet potato brownies which Alana dubbed \"the best gluten free ANYTHING I've ever had!\"...they were moist, flavorful, chocolatey....nom nom nom nom. Alana literally asked them what time they opened the next day (she was staying across the street LOL) and when they would have more (we bought the last two). We each had a glass of wine and the staff was so amazing that they let us stay almost 2 HOURS after they closed (we thought they closed at 9 but they closed at 7)...seriously...WHO does that?! It was awesome and I think it's probably the best food and value (certainly for gluten free) in the area.

This was definitely a good decision!\n\nFirst of all I love potatoes! So this is the place for me. Hot Spud is a nice and clean fast food type of place. They have a choice of differently filled baked potatoes, salads, soups and desserts. I chose the shrimp filled potato and it was simply delicious. The shrimp were grilled and really really good. I loved the whole arrangement. I added a cesar  salad which had freshly shaved parmesan on top and a very tasty dressing. My husband had the same potato but added crabmeat which tasted very fresh. I ordered the sweet potato cheesecake to go so I could enjoy it later. Everything was wonderful. Including the staff. Very nice and friendly people!\n\nAs someone sensitive to gluten it is a real challenge to find a place to eat out. At Hot Spud one does not have to worry about cross contamination because everything (besides croutons which can be added to your salad) is gluten free!\n\nI will definitely be back!", "author": "Daniela Y."}

The guys who work here are really nice and it was empty, since it was 5 pm so I got lucky and missed the dinner rush.  I ordered a custom potato with black beans, sauteed mushrooms, black olives and feta cheese (on the side).  Just a tip, they mix cheese (cheddar jack) and butter INTO the potato before they put the toppings on so if you would like a healthier option, get that stuff on the side.  I opted for butter, buffalo wings sauce and feta - on side.  The potatoes are on the large side so I wouldn't recommend this for a snack.

On top of that they used  almost a whole can. BUNK. My boyfriend got the steak potato. Everything hot except the canned corn and canned peas WTF are you kidding me. hot mushrooms hot steak cold peas and corn. I don't get it. The steak was so chewy. This place could be so much better. Ok so the food BLOWS. And I was going to give this maybe 3 stars and I really tried to like it but then all the workers were talking about drugs, loud, rude, in public.....its like cool dude you smoke pot bruh. yeah. Don't really care. Quit swearing. The decor looks like a baked potato without any toppings bland. Im actually pretty mad I wasted $26.00 here and even the brownie sucked and its a brownie. This place was empty so I say some of these reviews were faked....cold canned corn on a hot baked potato with cooked steak....NO just no. You can make a better baked potato in your kitchen for less money!", "author": "Nykky D."}

I have walked by many times and have never been convinced of the concept and it also took over the space that had the best breakfast burritos down here, so maybe I was a little bitter. So I trusted yelp on this one and it didn't disappoint. I had the shrimp potato with tasty sauce butter cheese and green onion. Sauce great, shrimp and potato cooked perfect. It was fantastic and satisfying the only way a lump of potato in your stomach could be. The owner and staff are super friendly and were really attentive and helpful to the customers.

They even build your spuds the right way, buy melting in the butter and cheese while they fluff the spud. \n\nIf you're a tourist visiting Fisherman's Wharf, it's worth getting off the beaten path for some good quality, non-commercial, healthy food. And, if stuffed spuds aren't your thing... then try their Crispy Thai Salad!\n\nA while ago I would have given this place a lower rating because one of the workers prepped my spud until it was cold then he added in the rest of the chilled ingredients, but instead i mentioned my concern to another employee, who turned out to be the owner. \n\nEver since that day, every\n time I go in he makes special efforts to ensure that my baked potato concoction is hot and to my liking.\n\nThey even have a chart on display for people with food allergies. Granted, if you have a food allergy you should educate your self and know what to stay away from... But the people at Hot Spud have made it a priority to list out their ingredients on the chart to guide the customer with their choices. To me that just shows that they care for and know their customers.\n\nNow, my only complaint is they need more locations in the city. :D", "author": "J R."}

I was not disappointed, as I often am when going out for lunch in the area. \n\nNow, if you have the misfortune of working in the Fisherman's Wharf area, you know how challenging it is to find a decent lunch place. For the past six years (yes, I've worked in the area for six years) I've pretty much relegated myself to three places, only one of which I actually like. So I'm thrilled Hot Spud is around the corner. \n\nI went over with low expectations. However, I was extremely impressed by how spacious, clean and tastefully decorated this place is. I was actually expecting a crappy, cramped fast food-type stand. Also, all of the potato toppings are visible, so you can easily personalize your own potato. Always one to be overwhelmed by too many yummy choices, I opted for one of their specialized potatoes--the grilled shrimp. The workers were extremely friendly and enthusiastic, and politely asked if I was okay with waiting 5 to 7 minutes because they grill the shrimp to order. Hell yes!! \n\nBecause I didn't think a potato would be enough for lunch, I also ordered a sweet potato brownie. Well, it was more than enough for lunch. Two hours later and I'm still stuffed. And not only was it filling, everything was perfectly cooked and delicious. I can't comment on the brownie yet, because I'm still too full to indulge in dessert. \n\nBonus points for discounts for people who work in the area!", "author": "Michelle L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-22", "description": "I work near the Wharf and have really been looking forward to the opening of Hot Spud. I guess so have a lot of other people- they ran out of potatoes the first time I tried to eat there. \n\nI probably don't need to tell you that  there isn't much at the Wharf in the way of healthy and affordable food so this fills a huge gap.\n\nThe food: I got a bulid your own potato and added grilled chicken. Everything was fresh and well prepared, the chicken was tender and moist. The potato is not as big as you'd expect for the prices. Mine had a big black spot, not really their fault but a bummer. You can choose up to 4 vegetables to add in BUT they are not listed on the menu board so that would be helpful.  I guess they don't come with sour cream? or maybe I didn't see it, or they didn't ask -- seems like an obvious one to me. They didn't ask if I wanted a sauce. The stuffed potatoes have a lot of hidden fat -- a huge scoop of butter, cheese, the sauces are all mayo based. So calorie wise don't be fooled. I think they need to come up with a skinny potato, and offer reduced fat sour crean, low-fat sauce, maybe some salsas or something else to add flavor but reduce fat content.\n\nMost people who work in the area grab a salad at Trader Joe or a sandwhich at Safeway. Picewise, a potato with fixin's and grilled chicken will run you about $8.50 so Hot Spud is a little north of my daily lunch budget. The owner did mention they will launch a discount program for people in the neighborhood and I was very pleased by that! I think they will do well!", "author": "Des R."}

Even if you're not a potato head, there are so many great things about these potatoes that might make you switch. When you order you can watch them mix the butter and cheese with such fervor that the insides convert to a sort of mashed potato mixture. Top that creamy potato filling with grilled meats, vibrant sauces, fresh veggies, and you have one amazing baked potato.\nThe place is clean with a great design. The principals are all on site, ensuring that your experience is good enough for a return visit. If I lived closer I'm afraid I would be there all the time.

I was going to a comedy show in the area so I thought why not. the pictures on yelp looked good and the reviews were alright. When our group of 4 got there, we waited 10 minutes for the person behind the counter to finish the 2 potatoes they were working on for the people ahead of us. When we ordered, the food took about 15 minutes to make and the cashier took 10 minutes to slice a piece of cheesecake and ring up our order (for 2). This all appeared to be because they were understaffed or just new to being in business. I'll cut them slack for that. When the food came it was underwhelming. We ordered the wharf stud with crab and there was barely any crab, probably only one of the ounce measuring cups worth. Most of the stud was corn and there was almost no cheese what-so-ever. We ate our food and didn't make a fuss because more people came in and the staff struggled again with more than 1 order AND we needed to go to our show. All in all the food tasted like the baked potatoes we get at Mills College in the cafeteria, not worth $11.

I was barely able to finish my Chicken spud, which had a really nice blend of ingredients and flavors.  These are not simple, plane-jane baked potatoes.  The chef obviously took some time to craft the ingredient list for the signature spuds and my lunch mates all found something appealing on the menu.  \nAll of the vegetables were fresh and crisp.  The chicken was tender and complimented with the perfect amount of buffalo sauce.  I was definitely in heaven.  \nOne of the owners offered us free samples of their desserts (brownie and sweet potato pie), both of which were great homemade treats.

The concept is you get a baked potato with butter, cheese and salt and then add whatever toppings you want plus a sauce if you so desire. All the toppings are fresh and yummy and they give you plenty of everything. Almost everything is naturally gluten free plus they have gluten free desserts. A great find and a nice break from all the pricier joints in the area.", "author": "Miles U."}

The only other cuisine that I find at a walkable distance is a less than ok Thai place and a great Argentinean food truck. Happened to walk past HotSpud a few times. Tried the chicken one it for lunch today...actually took it to go. It was so delicious! Different flavors and textures just burst in my mouth. A little pricey in my opinion but great taste! Also get 10% off for locals. I'm going back for more :-)", "author": "MrsNIFTY G."}

I don't regret trying the place because if I didn't then I wouldn't be able to yelp it.  My friends and I were all about to eat here, but they said they only had 6 potatoes left, and the next batch would come out in 20 minutes.  Most of my friends decided to eat at Fisherman's Wharf instead.  I ordered the shrimp spud.  My baked potato was loaded with olives, green onions, corn, cheese, chipotle sauce, and 5 pieces of grilled shrimp.  The first bite tasted pretty good with everything layered.  However, the rest of the potato became less enjoyable because the proportion of grilled shrimp didn't balance with the proportion of the potato.  At the end, everything just because a mixture of chipotle mush.  My friend ordered The Wharf Spud, which was loaded with red onions, green onions, and crab meat.  The crab complimented the potato pretty well because all the flavors were very settled.  I think it would have tasted better without the raw onions.", "author": "Cindy H."}
