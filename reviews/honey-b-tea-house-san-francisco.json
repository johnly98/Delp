I was yelping as we were driving along and decided to go with this one out of alllll the wayyy tooo many options. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised! The first thing I saw on their wall outside was the strawberry milk which looked yummy and refreshing. Luckily when I asked about caffeine, it didn't have any. YAHHOO! (No caffeine for me after a certain time). Then a quick browse showed Yes! They do have cheese foam which my husband loves.\n\nTwo drinks for 10.81 with tax! WHOA! definitely on the pricier side. The guy who took the order was fast, no frills, but after ordering I worried about the sweetness/ice/toppings etc because he didn't ask if I wanted anything! But luckily my strawberry milk DID come with the boba and pudding like the pictures and it was exactly what I wanted! He also enjoyed his sea salt cheese foam!\n\nSo for the two that we had, we definitely enjoyed it, although a little pricier than other places. We might be back!", "author": "Christine M."}

I was once a fan of the wide cups (actually I think that's why I came here at first!), but they become quite a hassle to bring into any car... I have yet to see a huge cup holder!\n\nI most recently ordered the taro milk tea, but could not taste the taro at all. I actually thought I may have been given someone else's drink (a regular milk tea perhaps?) but was personally handed the drink so I don't think that was it... was just lacking in flavor. \n\n$10 card minimum is kind of annoying!

This place had a wide selection of drinks and it was difficult for me to decide what to get. But luckily they had a top drinks section, which helped a lot. \n\nI ordered the hot grass jelly, and you have the choice of choosing two toppings from the list (honey boba, red bean, mung bean, and taro). I ended up choosing honey boba and red bean. I actually really enjoyed the drink. However, they used a long cup for the drink so all the toppings actually got stuck on the bottom, which made it a bit difficult to drink/eat it evenly. Since all the toppings got stuck on the bottom, the red bean plus honey boba actually made it way too sweet towards the end. \n\nI'm not sure if this place is under staffed, but the service was a bit on the slower end compared to other boba places. Even when I was trying to order, the staff was too busy preparing drinks that it took him a while before he took my order. Once I ordered, it also took a while before my drink came. \n\nOverall it's still a decent place but not anything special compared to a lot of other boba shops.", "author": "Nina W."}

Garlic fries was freshly made, hot and crispy. It was sprinkled with some garlic dices and finely chopped green herbs (possibly basil) However, the whole tray of garlic fries was drenched with salt. It is probably sea salt since there are a lot of big white salt crystal in the fries. Way too salty. \n\nClean interior and reasonable parking around this area.

I tried a tiramisu form of this drink back in Rowland Heights (Tancca) and was craving this form of boba, so you can only imagine my excitement when I saw this option here.

The layer of cheese was thin, but the overall amount of it was a good balance. The tea itself was nicely flavorful in a bitter way, so the sea salt cheese was the perfect compliment.\n- milk tea with boba - The boba was really hard, but the tea was good! Just what you'd expect a good milk tea to taste like.\n- popcorn chicken - Really plain and not as crispy as i would have liked, but acceptable. I wish there was basil as well. There was no seasoning on it or sauce (e.g. sweet and sour) for it originally. If you're taking it to go, there is either salt & pepper seasoning or the red pepper powder. I covered it up in the latter - spicy is the way to go! \n- garlic fries - More like salt with a side of fries... There was no garlic taste, just a super salty flavor to this order.\n\nThe parking at around 5pm on a weekday wasn't bad. I would come here again to try other food and drinks!", "author": "Joan Y."}

I was intrigued by their sea salt cheese tea cream since I remembered regretting not ever ordering this mango cheese shaved ice in Korea and so I wanted to know what was the fascination with cheese in desserts. It was also their top 10 item so couldn't be that too weird of a choice.\n\nI did enjoy it. To me it tasted just like a green tea crema drink. There was probably a slight cheesy taste in the crema but it wasn't overpowering since the sea salt really balanced it out. Overall, it was mostly just a green tea crema with sea salt. Still, I like it. I can't vouch for their other drinks but they did come in those big round jumbo cups. My crema came in a regular sized tall cup and they only have one size for the drinks so no debating over small or large.\n\nSpacious place so good for groups wanting to come and sit at a table with friends.

I swear, my list of boba/drink places to try is about as long as my \"been there, now it's time to review them\" list.  And believe me, that is a LOOOOOOOOOONG, long list.\n\nAlthough TPumps has tickled my interest more so than Honey B, my friend and I ended up come here instead since A) we were already in the area, and B) the line was short.  Considering how bad the wait can be at places like TPumps and Purple Kow, I cannot stress how important B) is these days.\n\nSince it was my first time here, I kept it simple with one of my usual orders - Milk Tea with Boba and Lychee Jelly.  While it was a good sized drink for the money (comes in chubby cups), I didn't think it was that impressive.  The tea flavor was okay, but, like the consistency, it felt really thin and light...and not in a good way.  Sadly, the tapioca balls weren't much better either - just way too mushy and soft for my liking.  But hey...at least the lychee jelly was good?\n\nWhile they've managed to squeeze in a handful of tables and chairs, the \"sitting area\" actually isn't all that large.  Unless you happen to luck into some seats, it's really more of a grab-and-go kind of spot (like most boba places...).  However, considering how hard parking around here can be at times, you're probably best off just dropping someone off and getting the drinks than circling around endlessly.\n\nIn any case, Honey B is really more of a TWO AND A HALF stars type of place for me, but rounding it down for now since it really didn't leave much of an impression.  I'll be back at some point to see how they do with a couple of my other favorites though, so this could very well change soon enough.  Still better than Tea Way for me, but I'd rather go to Purple Kow or Wonderful Foods (my favorite!).", "author": "Mike L."}

Their menu is kind of similar too. I ended up ordering red bean milk tea with pudding. I know it sounds like an odd combo, but I was hooked on the one at Cafe Lattea in Cupertino so I was hoping that this one was just as good.\n\nI was a little disappointed. The milk tea tasted a little watered down, but I think it might have been that the ice melted, diluting the drink. When I first picked up the drink, the cup felt a little warm, so that might have caused the ice to melt, making my drink taste watered down. They do have a good amount of red bean, which I liked. The pudding was very soft, so it was actually hard for me to taste the pudding. \n\nThe drink was okay, overall. I wouldn't mind going back to try another drink. I heard that their boba is very good so I'll have to go back and try it.\n\nThe store is a little small so there is limited seating. But it has a good ambiance and the decor is nice.

Every sip was an explosion of honey, sweet chewy boba, and egg pudding (they are very generous with everything!), and they didn't go overboard with the ice so the drink was milky until the very end. The sweetness took me off guard at first, but luckily I was in the mood for SWEET so it was pretty wonderful. I wasn't asked what sweetness level I preferred but I heard the girl asking other customers...so yes apparently you can ask for less/more (I recommend less sweet, unless you have a powerful sweet tooth). The texture/chewiness and sweetness of the boba was perfect, and they even have small boba as well. \n\nThe menu isn't ridiculously long and they don't sell snacks here except for egg puffs, but all the drinks sounds really appealing (matcha and taro drinks!). I also asked the girl if they use real taro, and she said yes (!!) you have no idea how exciting that is...I rarely come across boba shops that use real taro.\n\n\nI also tried the egg puffs because I didn't have CASH and there is $10 minimum if you want to use a card (strictly enforced)...and they were aiite (freshly made though), but then again I'm not a fan of egg puffs.

Ahhh San Francisco night life for A$Ns is grand.\n\nSrsly, how can someone who is smitten by cuteness to the extreme, say no to a pair of little babies equipped with bumblebee wings and antennae, whose cartoony mugs are plastered over the store's logo?\n\nThe \"goo dzau wei hung tsa\" (old school flavor black tea) seemed like an interesting choice to me, and so I ordered one and requested honey only as the sweetener. Bottom line, it was ok, but not my cuppa. It tasted very earthy, like a cross between roasted barley and roasted oolong, which is not quite the right kind to use for plain black tea (particularly old school flavor). For those who don't know their boba history, a while ways back in Taiwan, some entrepreneur around Taichung figured out a way to brew black tea properly as well as create a classic iced version, and sold it off a cart. Some sugar/sweetener, ice, and black tea. That was how iced tea started in TW. Years later this would be dubbed old school flavor, as part of marketing/labeling.\n\nThen someone stole the idea and innovated on it further, and thus added the right kind of milk, and added fun yuan which was then tapioca (and fresh I might add, not the rehydrated kind), and thus tapioca milk tea was born. This was in the early 1980s...so it took almost 30 years for this export to explode worldwide and become...diluted. Apparently some HK film starlet in the 80s was known for her uhm...chesty assets, and some TW entrepreneur made bigger tapiocas, and called them boba (bor ba = spheres galore), in \"honor\" of the chesty queen's assets....who interestingly went on to become Jet Li's wife. Yes THAT Jet Li. Even the kung fu man likes his giant spheres! So for those making jokes about ball sucking through a straw, are in theory misplaced about the reference to the anatomy :-o.\n\nBut going back.... this style of tea is not for me, not even if it were made into tapioca milk tea.

It took 20 minutes for me to finally get my food. The problem with Honey Bee was that they didn't know how to prioritize the orders or what to do when the orders were ready. \n\nInside the kitchen, there is a \"ready\" station where completed food items are placed on a tray. When the entire order is complete, an employee would take the tray of food and take it to the counter and hand the food to the customer. The ready station is visible to the public. So, I could see that my slush drink was completed first, then the pudding drinks, and then the popcorn chicken. That took about 15 minutes. For the rest of the 5 minutes, the food was just sitting at the ready station. No one bothered to check whether or not the order had been completed already. The front counter person and the cook both were just working away in the back while I was trying to get their attention. I didn't see why they couldn't just spend 5 seconds to check the completed orders. Plus, it was not busy at all. There was just another customer in the shop waiting for his order. \n\nBecause the slush drink was made first, it was just sitting at the station for at least 15 minutes, the slush almost turned into liquid. When I spoke to the employee, all she could do was apologize. How about making me a new one? \n\nIn terms of the quality of the food, the drinks were too sweet. Both of my friends and I threw away the drinks without finishing them. All we could taste was sugar and not much of anything else. \n\nTo the Honey Bee owner, taste your own creations and pay attention to customer service. Tell your employees to prioritize. There are so many boba/drink places in the neighborhood. Competition is high, and we could walk away anytime.", "author": "GR Z."}

Weird, that all of a sudden new boba places are popping up around this 'hood (2 other similar new businesses are to open soon - Bambu on Geary by 25th, and Infini Tea on Geary by 20th).\n\nI was pretty excited to try this and cam here with my bf while we walked our doggies one lazy afternoon.\n\nWe tried the regular boba milk tea and grass herb fresh milk tea (something new and adventurous sounding) and overall, the teas do their job, but nothing too extra special. The tapioca balls have a good texture and consistency. milk tea and grass herb tea taste good, perhaps a little on the sweet side. I do recall the gal at the counter ask you what level of 'sweet' you'd like, so I'd be sure to downgrade a bit next time. \n\nWith 2 more neighborhood boba places opening soon within a 7 block radius, it'll be interesting to see how each fare!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-15", "description": "I like Honey B Tea House because it's definitely a few steps up from powder-based boba drinks, and their drinks come in chubby cups. I came in unsure of what to order (usually I just get a milk tea at boba places) and I asked the cashier what the difference was between the regular milk tea and royal milk tea. She said the royal milk tea had a bit of lychee flavor. Sold! Keep in mind, you can order your drink not sweet, or regular sweet. I ordered a royal milk tea with honey boba (regular sweet). The royal milk tea didn't have a bit of lychee flavor, it had a lot of lychee flavor. It didn't taste highly artificial but it was just too much for me. If you get this drink, you definitely shouldn't add lychee jelly unless you love lychee. The boba had a nice chewy texture. My bf got the iced milk drink with caramel, coffee jelly and honey boba (regular sweet) but with the caramel, you should probably just opt for not sweet. Usually when I have iced milk drinks, I feel like I'm eating melted ice cream with condensed milk but Honey B's version wasn't as intense which I appreciated.\n\nThere was no line when we went on a weekday in the late afternoon.

Probably took less than 5 minutes. As for the taste, you won't be tasting the artificial flavors like the one you get at Quickly's; you can actually taste the tea. I would have preferred mine to be a bit more sweeter/milkier tasting, but after a few sips, I got used to it and it tasted fine to me. Overall, the drink was alright; still doesn't beat places outside of SF; however, I'd choose this place over Purple Kow because of 1) the line/waiting time 2) better staple drinks (like regular milk tea/green milk tea). Unlike here, I could never get used to my drink from Purple Kow, no matter how many times I sip it.\n\nAs for the service, the girl working when I was there on Friday night was a dear! When my friends and I were chilling at one of the tables, the worker came out and basically asked the table next to us how their drinks were and if they had any questions about them. Besides Tpumps, who else asks about how your drink is? Definitely something rare in boba places around here. And then when my friends and I left, all the workers greeted us with a smile and a goodbye. Very, very sweet people! Because of their service, one more star is added and I'd love to come back and try another drink from them. Gah, I'm really a sucker for great customer service.", "author": "Kirsten H."}

I'm a huge fan of boba drinks (heck, I work at one) and have never had a crema before. First time I came here was on a Sunday before my birthday after dim sum with my family. I was having a boba crave and this was the nearest place for boba. After looking through the menu, WHAT A SURPRISE! I spot \"Milk Tea Cream\". So i ordered the largest one possible to see if it lives up to what I've been hearing. They even have instructions on the wall to tell people how to enjoy it to the fullest. And boy, it did not disappoint. Came back again two days later on my birthday and got the same thing. I'm in love. Their cream on top is so fragrant and has a bit of a salty and tart flavor (I'm guessing the saltiness is from sea salt?). A huge plus, their milk tea is absolutely delicious too!\n\nSide note: I tried my brother's mango yogurt. It was good too. Very mango-y and nothing artificial-like to the taste. Also recommended a friend to try their milk tea cream and she fell in love with it too :)\n\nMinus one star for the poor unsmiling employee behind the counter. Good service = more tips.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-01", "description": "Few reasons I am giving it 3 stars. \n\n1) The milk teas are okay. I've had better. I like my milk teas stronger in tea flavor and this one doesn't cut it for me. But then again not a lot of places can meet up to my taste in milk tea. My favorite milk tea is the one you get from Chinese restaurants. There is just something about their milk tea that's so tasty. But this one does not cut it. It's one of ones that are close to my least favorite. There is one that I do like which is their HONEY milk tea. IT taste like the chinese iced honey lemon tea that you get from restaurants, and I really love that tea w/o the lemon :P So if I were to get a milk tea that would be one of them. \n  They also have a choice for red beans, green beans, or taro. I'm not a big fan of any of those, but everytime I Come with my sister or friends they usually get a drink with that stuff in it. I feel it caters to a more asian population, because not a lot of places have milk teas with red bean or green bean. And milk drinks too. When do you see a milk drink with red bean?\n\n2) I love yogurt drinks. You don't find many places with yogurt drinks and I was happy that this place had it. The Fresh Orange Yogurt is good it has a bit of a tea flavor or herb flavor I can't really put my tongue on it, but it's good. I like it my sister doesn't like it, but meh she's not doing the review I am :). Their peach yogurt is so good. I love good peach drinks and the yogurt one is really really good. Their slushies look really good. I've never really gotten it, because i'm so hooked on their yogurt and milk drinks :P\n\n3) Milk. I hate milk. If I eat cereal and there is milk left over I pour it into the sink. I DO NOT DRINK IT. IT IS GROSS. I HATE MILK. But their number 52, it's chocolate pudding, and tapioca milk drink. I love it. it's delicious it's not too sweet and not too not sweet(Does that make sense? :P) It is very hard for me to drink milk and want it again. And this place makes me want that drink AGAIN. Surprising I know! :P When you go to purplekow and you get their milk drink it taste like ice cream. Super sweet \"super delicious\" Well I only got it once and once was enough. A few sips of purplekow's milk drink and I get headaches and I never want to touch it again. But the one at Honey B makes me wnat to go back and I have a hard time trying to try new things at honey b, because I want that milk drink so bad! When I finish their drink and the choco pudding is left at the bottom i do'nt bother eating that up. The choco pudding w/o the drink is eh.. It doesn't really taste like anything except coco power. Little weird to me. \n\nTheir tapioca IS DELICIOUS. I like my tapioca chewy and sweet. Some people might like it mushy or no tapioca at all. I'm a tapioca girl. I like tapioca. This tapioca is one of the best tapiocas i've had. They make it chewy but not too chewy and not too sweet. Ugh DELICIOUS. \n\nTheir grass jelly is okay not a big fan. Doesn't have much flavor. Their litchi jelly is good. I don't usually get stuff other than tapioca so... I can't really say much about the other stuff.\n\nBe careful with their sweetness. For me it has not been constant. Sometimes it's sweeter and sometimes it's not. I always get normal sweet I don't bother going less sweet or w/e. So just a warning if you do get regular sweet and come back another day it may or may not be exactly the same. But we're all humans we all do things a little different. It can't be the same all the time. \n\nTL:DR if you don't like milk teas but like yogurt drinks and milk drinks this is the place for you. AND it has more Asian flavors. So those of you who look red bean or green bean, or even taro this is the place for you.", "author": "Emily L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-19", "description": "$10 min on credit cards, FYI\n\nAfter reading some of the reviews prior to coming here I was somewhat iffy about the whole situation because a friend of mine posted some pics and what-not when they first opened and I'm really happy they finally turned what used to be Quicklys into another tapioca shop. I had lunch in the neighborhood and thought I should come by and check it out.\n\nThis store is kind of small or a little tight, perhaps, despite being on a corner. I came in and thought there was a line but there was actually only 1 other in front of me and about 5 or so other customers already waiting for their drinks. The customer in front of me took a while to order but no biggie I suppose and when I went up to order, it took no more than 1 minute to make my order: two matcha green milk tea (jasmine milk tea/green milk tea) and one honey green tea all with tapioca. When I got my order number, apparently there was about 8 other customers ahead of me so the store was probably crowded a bit from all the people waiting. Oh boy, was this really going to be happening again like Purple Kow? OH YES IT WAS~!\n\nI think it took about 15-20 minutes before I finally got my drinks and I was watching just about all 8 customers or so that were before me leaving out the door slowly. There was about 2 workers in the back making the drinks and 1 cashier who eventually went to the back to help out since no more customers were arriving but it was still slow...so what exactly was going on? I was able to see that they were actually making each drink individually upon ordering, which probably was the cause of why they were so slow. They had the blenders working in the back and had to rewash them each time they made a new drink so things were just going by kind of slow. I didn't see the whole \"half a cup of ice\" going on, they had about a third or less cup of the ice and blended it down to make it crushed ice (I like crushed ice way better than whole ice personally). Their tapioca is chewy and good; not hard in the center and they give a decent amount of it. Their cup sizes are basically the same as Purple Kow, except on their cup, they have a sticker on it rather than a print.\n\nWhen I finally got my drink I can tell by taste it wasn't the premade stuff but I can't say it's the freshest milk tea I've had because I've had others that were a lot more fragrant and distinctly clear tasting. For green milk tea, this was on the sweeter side and reviews from the honey green tea was that it wasn't sweet enough (even thought I didn't try it myself). Although I didn't have to wait as long as I did at Purple Kow (with its excruciating line), this was still a pretty long wait for a place that had less customers than there so I'm not going to super bash them about the wait time. The store is kind of stuffy but I think since they're new they're still trying to work out the quirks and what-not I bet. Their tea isn't cruddy like the chain stores like Quicklys but I can't say it's fantastic so it's a 3-star for now. If they can somehow speed things up (maybe like Tpumps, for a tiny shop they also have large cup sizes but come out really fast), I'd raise the score if I come back.

Now it's officially off my list of return spots. \n\nPros:\n-No crowd at the time\n-Enough seats for the 8 of us to sit together (This place isn't that big so I am sure it is a hit or miss with seating)\n\nCons\n- Boba (the main component of Milk Tea!) was more durable than one would like. Most of my friends didn't even finish their boba as it sat at the bottom of their cups. \n\n-Taro drink = red bean drink with taro? My friend who recommend this place was with me and her drink was confusing to herself. It tasted like a mix of red bean and taro, which is not what she asked for. \n\n-Matcha Green Milk Tea = a completely different order! My drink ended up being a Milk tea with caramel and I think taro. While that drink was fine, it was obviously not what I ordered. I didn't make them change it as they got really busy and didn't want to make a scene over milk tea. (It's not the end of the world)\n\n-Communication - most Milk Tea places write something on the cup. A name, the actual drink order (how crazy!) but not here. They need to invest in a sharpie to avoid confusion on orders. What if I was allergic to caramel?!?\n\nOverall this was an alternative to the always busy Purple Kow, however it's not worth the detour there unless you're in the area. \n\nGood try Honey B.....", "author": "Andrew B."}

Little annoyed they charge 50 cents for hot drinks but that is the same at purple kow too. Oolong milk tea was nice and fresh tasting. I actually could have used a touch more sugar but probably better I don't. My wife liked her barley milk tea, especially the real pieces of barley in the tea. It didn't taste artificial like other places. The prices are reasonable 2.98 for each drink and they give you a good sized cup. I think they learned and put less ice in my drink as I didn't feel half of it had ice. This is a very good alternative to purple kow as it is cheaper, no long wait and the tea is fresh tasting.

I thought that was a simple staple at tea houses, but I guess not. It also looked like they had three or four rinsed blenders, for those who had concerns about the lack of materials. Service was fast, but there was also no one in line. The cups are awkwardly shaped: short and fat, reminiscent of a noodle bowl rather than a tea bowl. It's weird to carry it in one hand and I felt like I was going to drop it because I don't have massive hands.
