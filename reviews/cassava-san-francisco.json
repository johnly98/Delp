{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-24", "description": "This review is for their DINNER only.\n\nProbably the most under-rated neighborhood restaurant in the Bay Area; my date and I had absolutely no complaints after our 8pm Saturday evening dinner.  One of few examples of Californian-American food done right!\n\nVenue: not too many seats inside, given the small space, but you definitely don't feel cramped, even if you are sitting near the kitchen.  Maybe it's because the interior is a light grey / white color to brighten up the space and tan drapery on the ceiling vs. the dark wooden tables and black seats.  We sat inside in the corner of the restaurant but still didn't feel stuffed.  It looks like a typical neighborhood restaurant, but service and food are something else.  \n\nService: from when we entered to when we left, the staff were very friendly and approachable.  Our waitress was particularly helpful in picking out dishes for us (trying to go with variety and telling us which ones were seasonal).  They didn't come by the tables too often, but when they did they were always approachable.  Pace-wise, I would call it \"brisk\"; timing between dishes was something you might find during a lunch rush without feeling too rushed.  \n\nFood: considering how much we ordered between two people, it was quite something when we finished everything and didn't feel like we were gonna explode; everything was relatively light to the stomach.\n-- Summer Peaches & Melon Salad (sunflower sprouts, verjus, sheep ricotta salata, fennel fronds, rye crumble)($13) - I don't like peaches too much but I would have been perfectly happy eating 2 plates of these!  The peaches come from a farmer's market and even my boyfriend, who loves peaches, said these were some of the best he's ever tasted.  The fruit wasn't too sweet either and, with the cheese, crumble, and sunflower sprouts, didn't feel too much like eating a dessert fruit plate.  Awesome start to the meal!\n\n-- Cassava's Fried Chicken (thigh meat, buttermilk marinated, chive aioli, mint cilantro coleslaw)($14) - it kinda reminds me of the karaage at Nomica, except juicier and with a lot more flavor (probably b/c Cassava uses the thigh meat).  Even after eating this and my entree, didn't have any regrets on ordering this.\n\n-- Duck Leg Confit (heirloom beans, roasted beets, herb-spiced breadcrumb)($25) - I was hesitant about ordering this one since I normally don't go for duck, but the waitress didn't disappoint when she said I should go for it.  The duck was very tender and while savory, the beets and vegetables helped to add some lightness and counter the duck.  Highly recommend, even if you aren't too much of a duck eater.\n\n-- Sonoma Coast King Salmon (Brentwood corn, Jimmy Nardello peppers, polenta)($27) - one of few times we found a place that could perfectly cook medium rare salmon.  The sear on the skin was also pretty amazing- nice and crunchy.  The polenta was probably less successful than it could have been, but the salmon makes up for it.\n\n-- Hibiscus - Orange Blossom Panna Cotta (berries, figs , hibiscus syrup)($8) - great balance between the sweet syrup and the slightly sour panna cotta.  The panna cotta was a bit creamier in texture than normal, but the syrup and fruit balanced it out; n fact, the creamy texture saved the dish as a counterbalance to the sweet syrup.  My date doesn't like sweets, but he raved about this one for days after.\n\nAll in all, you get a neighborhood-feel vibe with a high quality, fresh, and just plain delicious meal that surpasses the neighborhood feel.  A must try in the Richmond area!", "author": "Audrey H."}

The kale kimchi was unique, the yellow beans in sesame oil were tasty, and the white fish was perfectly buttery. The daikon broth with thin daikon slices was yum. The rice was cooked well but not overly so. It felt extremely healthy while still being tasty. 4/5, especially given the $13 price tag!\n\nI also had a bite of the liege waffle with bacon and soft scrambled eggs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-23", "description": "Confused Menu and Poor Service\n\nWhen I noticed that Cassava had recently hit Eater's list of August's top restaurants, my interest was immediately piqued. Ever since I was fortunate enough to have an incredible meal at Trestle, I've become more and more enamored with simple tasting menus that are reasonably priced. Both Trestle ($38 for 3 courses, $48 for 4) and Cassava ($42 for 4 courses) reflect a unique trend of restaurants foraying into the pre-fixe structure that's normally reserved for fine dining. \n\nHowever, my experience at Cassava was ultimately incredibly disappointing. One of the dangers of pre-fixes is that you limit the diner's ability to structure meals that are best suited for them, so in exchange you really have to structure courses in a way that not only make logical sense, but hopefully have some sort of synergy that ties them together. \n\nCassava's dishes had none of that. While one of the four dishes was great (Sonoma Coast Salmon), one was acceptable (Hibiscus Orange Panna Cotta), and two were confused (Pork Ribs and Sunflower Sprouts), none of them fit together in a way that really made any sense. The menu felt more like an attempt for the restaurant to just frontload a couple interesting dishes without actually trying to understand how the dishes fit together.\n\nThe Salmon was fantastic, it had an absolutely wonderful texture and the blend of corn and chili was delightful. The rest of the meal was poor though. For the pork ribs, one scallop was well seared while the other looked practically boiled. Worse, the zucchini puree wasn't properly parboiled to remove whatever acrid flavors are left in the zucchini, so it tasted absolutely disgusting. The sunflower sprouts had an intersting texture, but throwing together some ricotta salata and some random edgy flower sprouts together does not a good salad make. Finally, while I appreciated the panna cotta I'm not entirely certain how long it had been sitting (the hostess grabbed the panna cotta straight out of a fridge when we asked for it a bit early since we had a flight to catch), and was fairly watery.\n\nThe worst experience though was when we requested the hostess to please speed up the rate of our meals if she could. We were polite and cordial. She was too when she responded that our pork ribs were being plated currently. However, when we asked if we could have our dessert sent out early too, and that we would happily accept it while we were eating our ribs, she must has misinterpreted us as asking about the pork ribs again. While I get that this misunderstanding can be slightly annoying, (ie. a customer haranguing you about something you answered) I literally witnesses our hostess roll her eyes and treat us like idiots for the remainder of the meal even when we clarified about the dessert. This is unacceptable, it is the job of the hostess to treat guests properly and not make a hostile environment because her diners asked one dumb (to her) question. \n\nOverall, the food was below average, but it simultaneously managed to miss my culinary expectations while being poor enough service-wise to warrant the only service complaint I've had in 35+ reviews I've written on this site.", "author": "Samuel W."}

I don't know whether I like it or hate it. I like it because the aesthetic is BEAUTIFUL. Everything from their ultra soft paper towels to their sophisticated mugs makes the enviornment very relaxing. They even have nice heaters outside so that you can eat in the warmth on a winter day (though your bums will be cold from the metal chairs... which is weird because the rest of your body is warm). They're dishes are plated BEAUTIFULLY too.\n\nThe food itself was pretty mediocre. I thought the open faced pork loin sandwich was excellent. But the meatball curry was basically really wet meatballs drenches in sauce served with rice... Nothing about it made it compelling or super flavourful. The Japanese breakfast was also underwhelming. Condiments, miso soup, rice, and a very salty chunk of fish was definitely not what I was expecting for a place that was so beautifully decorated and a dish that was so elegantly plated.\n\nThe worst part of my experience here was the hidden charges. They charged $2 for Hot WATER. I thought hot water would be free since cold water was free, and no where on the menu did they state that there was a cost to having hot water... but guess not. Also, they charge a 5% service fee that is explicitly noted as \"not tip.\" I don't even know what this means.

So happpy we found this place.\n\nWanted to grab something to eat in an outdoor area before a hike with our pup on this gorgeous and sunny Saturday. Browsed through yelp and called a few places to realize that a lot of their outdoor seatings had a long wait. Was literally just about to grab a sandwich to eat in the car when we found Cassava and called them. They had a 30+ minute wait also but we were able to put our name and number down without having to be present. I really liked that they notify you by text that your table was ready and that they would hold it for 5 minutes- gave us enough time to start walking to the restaurant. \n\nRight upon arrival, we were led to a 5 seater table joining another couple. The table was rectangular and spacious so it gave us enough room in-between so it didn't feel like we were right next to each other. \n\nThe menu was simple but enough to entice your taste buds. They offered 2 starters, 7 entrees, and 2 desserts as well as a back page of drinks: sangria by the pitcher, tea, coffee, house cocktails, beer, and wine (sparkling, white, rose, and red).\n\nWhile still browsing through the food menu, I couldn't help but keep overhearing the guy next to us praising how great and delicious his Garlic Lamb sausage hash bowl was- he was having a mouthgasm, eyes closing, eyebrows raising, and fist clenching-his-silverware-tight kinda moment with each bite into his lamb sausage that he verbalized it three times! LOL. Sold my bf on it.\n\nFENNEL- GARLIC LAMB SAUSAGE HASH BOWL ($17): \nmade with roasted marble potatoes, fresh peas, fried egg, and chipotle aioli. One sausage wasn't enough that my bf ordered another for $7. I'm not a fan of lamb at all- the taste and smell throws me off every single time and I can smell lamb a mile away (my most disliked meat of all....) But my bf was so persistent and persuading with how delicious the sausage was that he got me to try a bite with a piece of potato. AND to my surprise, it was actually not that bad. Still got that lamb taste that I really can't tolerate, but overall was not bad. The texture was tender and soft and the taste was still gamey but bearable. We were really surprised to find purple yam mixed with the potatoes (yumm! one of my all time favs). Fresh peas were fresh indeed; bright green, firm, and sweet. The bf doesn't like soft cooked peas lets alone fresh hard ones so I scooped them over to my plate and ate it with my salad. :)\n\nCORNISH GAME HEN & CORNBREAD ($18):\noven roasted half hen, sweet potato cornbread, market salad, and fried egg. The sweet potato cornbread was what really sold me, tbh. But it was also the one thing I didn't like as much in my entree. Texture was soft and moist, almost like a muffin, but a tad bit too sweet for my liking. Besides that, I loved everything else especially the oven roasted hen. The meat was super moist and delicious. Seasoned lightly but very appetizing and literally got me digging into the hen and wanting more after I finished it. Wished there was moree! The hen is easily one of the best poultry dishes I've had in a long time. The tangerine slices in the salad were sweet and citrusy; a nice bold taste to my salad with peas. lol\n\nDRINKS:\n- Sangria ($8): red and white wine, port, southern fruit tea. Very generous glass of sangria but it was watered down and did not have much of a wine or fruit taste. :(\n- Pomegranate Margarita ($11): sabe blanco tequila sake, house-made pomegranate liqueur agave, lime, and sea salt. Decent and standard margarita but didn't have much of the pomegranate taste. Too much ice in the drink. \n\nReally enjoyed our meal here at Cassava that I already recommended this place to a few friends, especially our pup-owning ones! Food was great but the drinks were a total miss :\\ Loved the outdoor seating- although windy, the heat lamps above our heads kept us warm and toasty. Servers were efficient and cordial. Bathroom lock was a bit weird, no matter which way I turned to lock it, I was still able to open the door which made it hard to know when it was locked!", "author": "Anissa D."}

My friend and I were able to be seated immediately because we were okay with sharing a table outside. Outdoor seating conveniently has heat lamps! This place has a modern feel that was noticeable even sitting outside without the decor. It might've been because of the furniture and plates, but I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place. Definitely a cute brunch date location.\n\nThe category for this place is American (new). So I was pleasantly surprised by the fusion meal options that were available. The prices were on the higher end for these items. We decided to share the Japanese Breakfast and the Korean Chorizo Hash Bowl. In hindsight, I do not recommend sharing the Japanese Breakfast. This is not the best shareable meal option because there are many components/side dishes to the plate.\n\nJapanese Breakfast. This was a standard asian breakfast (ie multiple side dishes that accompany the rice) that I'm used to eating daily. The key difference here was the natto that I ordered as an extra. I've always wanted to try natto! I wasn't sure how to eat it and the servers were helpful in explaining. I can say that I am not particularly a fan though. It has somewhat sour taste. My friend said that they seasoned it with something because it tasted different. Be warned it is very 'slimey/sticky' and stretches like a spider web. The fish and soup that they provided was the best part of this meal. The fish was cooked and seasoned well so that it wasn't dry or salty. \n\nKorean Chorizo Hash Bowl (9/2017 menu). I was a little confused as to where the Korean was taking place in this meal... possibly in the chorizo? There was a lot of chorizo pieces, but unfortunately, the chorizo was really dry and didn't have enough flavor. I wouldn't have recommended this, but it looks like it's already not part of their weekend brunch menu anymore.\n\nThis is a very cute date brunch spot with great service. Menu options were unique.

We had 4 large plates on a small table for two. By the time we finished the appetizers and started on the main courses, they were COLD. As we ate our main courses, our 3rd appetizer (The burrata) came out. As a result of the strange service, the main courses were awful. The crispy salmon skin was no longer crispy, it was bland, and the texture in general was off. The pork cheeks were lightly battered (I think) and lost its crispiness. The sauteed squash was begun to let water out, which diluted all of the flavor in the dish, leaving everything extremely bland. It was such a shame since the pork cheeks were so tender. IT would have been a beautiful dish.\n\nI really wanted to like this place and put it in my rotation, but the extremely poor timing of the dishes severely impacted the taste and texture of the dishes.

Even the food's presentation was so picturesque. I ordered the Korean Chorizo Hash Bowl ($17) while he ordered the Liege Waffle with Scrambled Eggs and Bacon ($15).

The pop of colors in the dish made it all the more appealing.\n\nAs for the waffle, it was definitely more on the dry side.

I think I just found my new favorite brunch place in Richmond District! \n\nCame here for Sunday brunch around 10am and there was little to no wait for a table. I was genuinely surprised and quickly got seated outside with the heat lamps turned on. Staff was friendly and very welcoming. I would say cassava doesn't have the biggest place so be prepared to wait sometimes! \n\nMy friends and I ordered the pork shoulder open sandwich ($15) , the baked Burrata ($13), and the meatball and eggs ($13). The pork shoulder sandwich was probably my favorite dish out of everything we ordered. The bread had this garlic spread on it and the pork shoulder was absolutely delicious. Fatty and warm with a nice egg on top! I also love arugula and enjoyed every bite of this :) The baked Burrata was definitely a bit smaller than what I imagined but it also tasted great. Plenty of bread to go around the table and to dip! I didn't try the meat balls and eggs, but my friend told me it was satisfying, but nothing out of the ordinary. \n\nPrices here are pretty typical of other SF brunch places.

Loved their brunch offerings but dinner was just not a 5-star experience.\n\nFirst of all, they require a credit card to make reservations which I found a bit odd. Not sure why any place would need to do that unless they only have a tasting menu. \n\nWine selections by the glass were a bit limited and although the Rose I had was tasty, the pour was stingy for a $12 glass of wine. \n\nOn to the food!\nStarters: Burrata salad and carrot salad. Burrata was good, came with bread and some simple greens. Nothing special though and pretty simple dish. Carrot salad was delicious and loved the accompaniments.\n\nEntrees: Limited menu. My dad got the octopus and sea bass (was supposed to come with fish collar but bass was a substitute). He wished the octopus had not been in the dish--said it was odd to mix two fish like that. Loved the bass and would pass on the octopus next time. Broth it came in was flavorful.\n\nBeau got the Mary's chicken. It's basically a very delicious half chicken on a plate. He liked it but it was literally just chicken on a plate with little else (some wilted greens?). \n\nI got the salmon and it was probably the best dish on the table. Perfectly cooked with accompaniments that made sense (pur\u00e9e, rice). I ate every bite!\n\nNo complaints about service at all-kind and attentive. Space is also simple and modern.

It's a great spot for a slower, quieter type of meal. The space is rather small so expect a little bit of a wait during peak brunch hours, or make a reservation beforehand. My group of 3 waited maybe 15 minutes for a table around 1:15PM on a Sunday. There's an open kitchen as well and since it's a small space, it smelled strongly of oil, and that grease smell stuck to my hair afterwards.\n\nThe menu is small, which is good if you are easily overwhelmed by too many choices. Reasonably priced (for SF anyway) with some Asian/Japanese inspiration. I found the food to be just okay overall and mostly lacking in flavor. Nothing wow-ed me and since the menu is short here, there's not much else on the menu that would bring me back for a second visit.\n\nWe ordered 3 dishes to share:\n\n* DUCK LEG CONFIT SALAD ($16) - 4/5\n[citrus vinaigrette, shaved grana padano, romaine, arugula, soft shell-poached egg]\nFirst things first.. my salad was missing the egg promised on the menu. I didn't notice it until halfway through because the duck was so good, and I felt like it was too late to point it out to the waiter so I decided not to bother. But speaking of the duck, it was a decently sized portion, kind of fatty and melt-off-the-bone tender soft. Tasty, but the rest of the salad was just plain salad. Maybe it would've been better had the egg been there.\n\n* POMEGRANATE GLAZED BARBEQUE PORK RIBS \"HASH\" ($17) - 3/5\n[roasted farm potatoes, quinoa, soft shell-poached egg, romaine lettuce, arugula, cherry tomatoes]\nSadly disappointing. Pom glazed BBQ sounded delicious but the ribs were really underwhelming in flavor. I could barely taste any BBQ. The ribs were also a little on the dry side despite the fattiness. The quinoa, on the other hand, stood out a little more. Slightly acidic from the pickled onions.\n\n* JAPANESE BREAKFAST ($13) - 3/5\n[koshihikari rice, our miso soup, pickled vegetables, wakame with mushroom, oven roasted market fish, soft shell-poached egg in broth]\nRather plain and boring overall. The salmon was moist but not quite as soft and buttery as other salmon I've had. The portion of fish was also tiny, as was the breakfast plate portion as a whole.", "author": "Jessie L."}

The Rose was nice. My husband said the margarita was wonderful. \n\nI left off a 2 stars because our lovely server disappeared. I waived down a tall, white, male server after waiting quite a while with empty plates and glasses (we both wanted 1 more drink). I ordered another rose and then the server quickly walked away before my spouse could order his drink. Then when the server returns he pours 1/5 of the tiny glass with rose. I thought he wanted me to 'taste' it first before pouring, but then I looked up and he was gone. That .05 oz pour was my drink? For $14 a glass? I wouldn't care if  a) our first server didn't pour my first glass it to the top (which is 3oz pour if to the top), b) I looked around the place and everyone with wine had their tiny glass filled to the top and c) it was $14 glass of rose. So I paid $14 for .05 oz of wine. (This is NOT an expensive rose by any means). We tried to say something in addition to ordering my husband's drink a second time when the server came back to drop off the bill, but he immediately dropped off check and quickly disappeared without giving us a chance to order my hubs drink and address the small rose pour. \n\nThat last server created such an awful experience to what was initially a lovely Memorial Day brunch at our first time to cassava that I doubt we will return.

My mom had the Japanese breakfast which she said was good, and she said the salmon that came with it was delicious. I had the waffle with eggs and bacon, and they were accommodating enough to give me avocado instead of the bacon which was a big plus. The waffle was good but the scrambled eggs were some of the worst scrambled eggs I've ever had which put a real damper on the meal. Seriously, the eggs were so over cooked that they had significant brown bits throughout. Also, they poach eggs super super lightly (like almost raw), and if you don't want your egg that lightly poached, the only other option is scrambled eggs. So in a way I felt like the burnt scrambled eggs were a punishment for not being cultured enough to like barely cooked eggs?

But, if you've got some cash to spend and are craving something different, try this place out! I've been here two times now and I have luckily ordered their best dishes: BAKED BURATTA, and their JAPANESE STYLE BREAKFAST. \n\nThe buratta is creamy and delicious with the greens and toast! The real winner here is the Japanese Style Breakfast with its miso soup, warm Japanese style rice, healthy steamed fish, (extra side of natto = fermented soy beans), kimchi, and pickled veg. DEFINITELY A BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IN TERMS OF PORTION, PRICE, and FOOD. Would go back again for this.\n\nMy friends have gotten the continental and I wouldnt recommend this since it goes for more than 11$ for a croissant, small serving of eggs, some fruit and yogurt.\n\nAnother tip is to try their GREEN JUICE! I liked it!", "author": "Margaret G."}

Got my coffee pretty fast and it was delicious however the cup was very very small, I was expecting something more than \"half a cup\" of coffee for my $6. Even though there was only 3 other tables(total of 8 people) in the restaurant, I had to wait for 40 minutes for a simple sandwich to arrive. I wasn't offered even water in the mean while, no one checked with me to see how I am doing... nothing. I had go get bottle of water and silverware myself. If your prices are upscale(spent $24 for small cup of coffee and a sandwich) your service should be upscale too.\n\nAnyway, food was good(except side salad. It wasn't chopped at all, they just put it as they bought it from store) but any other breakfast place on the block has delicious, way cheaper food and better customer service.

I made a reservation for us on Resy and the table was set up when we got there! \n\nWe had several different servers throughout our meal, but all were extremely nice and answered all our questions regarding the menu and my colleague's food allergies. In addition, they were able to substitute the cornbread for avocado at no upcharge!! \n\nI ordered the cornish hen with a fried egg. The egg was delicious, however I was not a huge fan of butter/oil mixture on the cornish hen. In addition, it came with a nicely portioned side salad with a light dressing and plums. The pumpkin cornbread was decent, however it wasn't great. The piece I got was extremely dry, I'm not sure if it was old because usually I find pumpkin dishes to be extremely moist. \n\nThe best part of my meal was the sangria. WOW! It was a large glass of red sangria with ample fruit for $8.00. I would definitely order it again and suggest you do too! \n\nWe took a look at the weekday lunch menu and it seemed to be almost the same dishes as the brunch menu.

My criteria were: good food, alcohol and affordable. It took her only a minute to text me back and recommend Cassava. And knowing that I can trust her taste, I didn't hesitate a minute and right away called to make a reservation for four that very same evening. \n\nTwo of us four were early and so we sat outside drinking sangria: I like that they make sangria out of the wines that they don't finish at a given night.

They offer dinner as well, but I feel they're more popular for brunch/lunch.\n\nUnless I've been eating too much junk food lately, my #1 rule when dining out is never order a salad as a main. As a side, sure, but never a main. However, Cassava's duck leg confit salad was simply delicious. The main reason for my ordering of this salad? The duck leg, and yes it was worth it.\n\nBeautifully plated with bright green arugula and romaine lettuce, crisp radishes, pickled red onions of magenta hue, shaved grana padano, and crunchy fried quinoa, the salad was light, refreshing, and flavorful. Topped with a custardy soft shell poached egg and a tender and moist smokey duck leg, the flavors paired well together making a healthy weekend brunch meal.\n\nI had the spiced honey latte alongside my salad, which was warming, mildly sweet, and delicious.\n\nThe brunch menu has a limited selection, relatively speaking compared to a typical brunch restaurant.

The soup was great for warming me up on a nippy San Francisco morning and the sides of various pickled vegetables, natto, and seaweed/lotus chips was really good with the Japanese rice (very glad it was not just regular white rice). We also went with a more traditional Croissant sandwich. It was a bit oily, but still very good.\n\nI ordered a spice honey latte to go with my meal. It was definitely sweeter than how I typically take my caffeine, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Dad and I also shared a panna cotta (cause why not). Again, on the sweet side, wish it was delivered with fruits that were a little more tart rather than sugared strawberries. But the texture was just right as far as panna cotta goes.\n\nThey really should check who is allowed into the restaurant though. We had a vagabond wander in openly asking sitting patrons and the employees for free food and drinks. He also called out patrons like myself for \"giving him paranoid looks\".

If you are dining with indecisive people, this place is a blessing. Between the 4 of us, we ordered the Japanese breakfast ($13), Cornish game hen ($18), and pork shoulder sandwich ($15) x2.

I understand that this is SF, but we've eaten brunch in SF plenty of times and this was probably the most expensive meal for the amount of food served. On the other hand, this most definitely isn't your typical diner breakfast food, so while on the more expensive side, I do appreciate the flavor and presentation of the dishes.\n\nParking is not too terrible - there's a school a block north from the restaurant, and there's usually ample street parking by there on the weekends.

They're very good about actually taking your phone number and then just texting you when they have the table ready so you can walk around to kill time!\n\nIt's a pretty small place, but has a chill hipster vibe with nice decor. The one qualm I did have with the space is that it's an open kitchen so it's literally right next to all the seats and as a result, the place smelled very kitcheny... so oil smells etc which is not so great. \n\nThey have a pretty simple menu but everything on there is good. We got the smoked salmon appetizer, the SO got duck salad, and I had the traditional Japanese breakfast. Portion sizes are pretty large and filling -- the appetizer was basically the same size as the entree so you could have gotten two apps and probably been fine. Smoked salmon was good, it came with an arugula salad. The SO thought the duck was decent, and the Japanese breakfast was decent -- simple, albacore was pretty delicious, the side dishes were yummy, but it wasn't quite AMAZING. I've had better Japanese breakfasts at other places. \n\nOverall, it was a decent experience, but none of the food was that mindblowing. Good place for a one time brunch, but not quite outstanding enough that I'd want to come back.

The granola and sweet honey were great complements to the yogurt and fruit. The croissant was great: crisp and fluffy. The poached egg was cooked perfectly. As much as I enjoyed the food, I hated the latte I ordered. It was an abomination. I took two sips and put it on the table next to me. It was very disappointing since the pictures on Yelp looked great. I can only assume that the barista has not been trained up to speed yet, which happens and I could understand.

It's like Alice Water revolution has come and gone and everywhere else has grab hold of the torch and ran to the finish line, leaving Californians behind. Northern Californian cuisine has been rest on its laurels for too long.\n\nCassava, is a rare exception. Its seasonality of ingredients is the keystone to a well planned and executed meal, its originality makes the place a stand out from all other places I've been to that serve New American food in the last few years in the city. \n\nThere are also a few secrets that few knew. \n\n1. It offers Japanese breakfast, one of the few, if not the only place that offers such delectable outside of Japan or New York. Go on week days. But that's not all. \n\n2. It is dog friendly. I repeat, dog friendly. How many Richmond restaurants offer such an experience? Not many. \n\n3. It's known as a brunch place but really, the dinner is where it shines. Main dishes are incredibly well prepared with a lot of unusual yet local vegetables. Uni appetizer is a Americanized version of chawamushi, but it is a lot denser and more approachable (for Americans). No it does not use Hokkaido uni it uses Californian uni which goes back to its localvore concept. The Japanese influence in its cooking is unmistakable. But like most Japanese French masters, the restaurant's chef, which as I read, hails from Luce, one of my favorite brunch places, has acquired western techniques and ingredients. Thus, the Japanese influence is a hint, a light touch, a barely noticeable something something, but it enhanced the experience in ways you wish that you could see in more restaurants. Okay who am I kidding? Just about any Michelin restaurants you go to these days have Japanese cuisine influence in their dishes. this one may not come with a star (yet), it has mastered the technique. It's a real and rare bargain for this city.\n\nMenu changes with the season. Its 4 course tasting menu is far approachable than most Michelin star restaurants in the bay area. The quality of food is also comparable with any number of Michelin star restaurant in and outside of the bay area. \n\nGo at 5 PM after a day at the GGP. Grab an outdoor patio seating with the heat lamp on so the sun is still shining and the fog has not come through the O.B. My favorite mains are the fish of the day / month / season and pork loins. Bring your fur baby.\n\nIn my opinion, it's only a matter of time before someone decides a place like this should be given at least one Michelin star, then you'd be fighting with everyone else to get a table reserved.", "author": "Victoria E."}

We snatched their last Saturday night reservation on Open Table! When we walked in 30 min early,  we immediately felt a great vibe: we were welcomed warmly by the host and the Co owner/beverage manager who accommodated a request to sit earlier. They smiled and didn't make us feel like a nuisance for asking. We both had the 4 course tasting menu, including a few extras to complete our meal. They worked as a team, providing wonderful and colorful plates that would satisfy any palate.\n\nPros:  excellent salmon dish...that black rice with the squash puree was amaze balls! EXCELLENT table service by all that approached our table. The beverage manager Co owner was extremely warm and friendly...so down to earth; everyone who served knew the dish they were bringing out. The plating was phenomenal and just put together well... aesthetically pleasing to the eye because the moment you see the dish in front of you,  you have to stop yourself from going animalistic by using hands and teeth to feed your stomach (had a white jacket on, I needed to take it easy and use the knife and fork). Ceramic plates are the way to go. They make an EXCELLENT cappuccino and even asked what kind of milk I'd like to take it with (whaaaaat? First time a restaurant has ever asked me! Ritual Coffee too!) Have I said EXCELLENT too many times? !? Well,  just handle it. \n\nCon: Maybe it isn't such a con but the apple crumble was a tad too sweet for my taste. The apple slices themselves were sweet enough coupled with the singular baby scoop of ice cream/whipped cream (couldn't tell because it was so hot), so I felt the chocolate crumbles on top pushed it over the edge for me.  If you end up choosing this dessert,  make sure to tell them ahead of time because it will take 15 min to make ( says so in the menu). \n\nThe place only seats 40 max but I did enjoy the intimate seating. Make a reservation! Cassava has given me more reason to drive the 40 miles north into Outer Richmond. I'll be back for brunch and bringing friends!", "author": "Liz Z."}

I will say that it's on the pricy side- about 20 bucks a person- but so worth it.\n\nThe waffles were made to perfection and were crisp. The fruits that came with them were fresh and as tasty as you could ever imagine. I never felt like I needed syrup for the waffles- fruits did the trick alone. Do not even get me starred on the bacon- it was probably the best I've ever tasted.\n\nThe ambiance is also awesome here. The place itself was casual, yet the experience is not- the menu has great variety and the people who work here love their jobs. The casual feeling turns to one that makes you feel like you're at a fancier place, because the people here really take care of you to make sure you're enjoying you time.\n\nOverall, I can see this become a monthly spot for me.

With poor service comes a poor dining experience and in return poor food. At cassava, the service was unfortunately below average for me. We ordered a Mr. And Mrs. Croque (along with other items I will not be mentioning here) and were fooled by the pics on yelp. We anticipated it to come on a crossaint sandwich, but instead it came on two grilled slices of white bread. My mother is extremely picky with her food and specifically came here for the crossaint sandwich so we asked if we could get a crossaint in the side. The lady behind the counter was quick to answer that there was an extra charge for the crossaint. We answered with a \"no problem.\" What is a couple extra dollars if it makes your overall experience a better one? When the crossaint came we asked if there was any way they could transfer the contents of the original sandwich to the crossaint and the lady said that it would take about 10 minutes. We already waited about 25 minutes for our food and our tummies didn't want to permit us another 10 minutes so we picked up the knife and went at it ourselves. The lady then went onto comment why we didn't want to try the original slices of white bread with the sandwich because it tasted really good. She said this in a rude, condescending manner as if we didn't know how we liked our sandwich to be. If we didn't know how we liked our sandwich to be, we wouldn't have ordered a crossaint on the side to begin with. This was a small problem that could've easily been fixed by spending a couple extra dollars, but because the lady had to throw in her rude comments after her inability to help us, this review had to be written.\n18% gratuity is included in the bill. Were they deserving of this 18%? Probably not. I just hope it goes more to the cook, hostess, and waiter that all played a team effort in this restaurant. There are better places in the city that will serve brunch, so go do yourself a favor and skip this spot. You'll have more pleasant experiences and food elsewhere.", "author": "Amy T."}

The place is on the pricey side for brunch. I got the potato hash. First of all, this wasn't a hash since the potato was basically baked potatoes in chunks. Then the pork was extremely dry. Everything on the plate was under seasoned. My girlfriend got the waffle plate. The waffle was really thick and super bready/doughy.

Natto available by request - which I did but would caution against it unless you're an adventurous eater. It was all very nice and I enjoyed having a Japanese breakfast in SF but wish there were more small dishes and less rice. Though the rice was good it's pretty much the mainstay of the breakfast dish. Something like fried/tinned fish would have been nice - something other than the $3 smoked trout chunks.

The other items were all pretty good and refreshing for a light lunch. I wanted to note that all of the items (excluding the seared albacore) would probably be offered for free at hotels in Japan.

It seemed like they were slow to get to everyone, so *shrug* But other than that, great and friendly service!\n\nPrice-wise, I think it's pretty reasonable for brunch...if you just order entrees. Our tab came out to be $50 for 3 items O= Drinks are a bit pricey; I think one of the juices (might be their signature one) is $4. \n\nNOTE: Come early to find parking!! \n\nBaked Burrata with Summer Corn - SO GOOD. I love burrata and I love corn, so when I saw this I HAD to order it. I didn't care much for the poached egg that came with it, but everything else was delicious! The burrata, corn, basil pesto and arugula were just perfection. The dish also comes with bread. What more can you ask for?! The only thing is that there's quite a bit of oil at the bottom of the bowl =/ \nJapanese Breakfast - The smoked trout was so yummy! A tinyyyyy bit dry, but such a nice smokiness to it. I loved the pickled bean sprouts -- it was also a bit spicy (I think it was chili oil), and so good. The poached egg was good, but very simple and plain in flavor. The miso soup was very interesting; kale, daikon slices, corn and mushroom. It's not as salty as the miso soup you typically get at Japanese restaurants, which was nice.\nLiege Waffles with Scrambled Eggs, Bacon - The bf got this and enjoyed it. I think he didn't enjoy it as much because he's not used to waffles without syrup.\nSide of potatoes - The bf asked the server if they had anything off-menu for potatoes, and he said he could get something for us. We got a nice plateful of fried/roasted rainbow potatoes. They were amazing crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

With just the service and ambiance alone, you can't help but feel happy when you're in Cassava.\n\nI find the food to be delicious, fresh, and unique. The first time I went, I had the liege waffle, which came with scrambled eggs and bacon. It was so hearty and satisfying. Most recently, I had the pork \"hash\" that blew my mind. I definitely didn't expect my hash to come out the way it did (eggs/ribs/quinoa), but the moment I tasted it, I had no complaints whatsoever. The pork was so tender and the combination of flavors was something I didn't expect - so delicious!\n\nIf I had one critique, it might be that the service is a little slower than other places, but it's not something I minded.

I ordered the Japanese breakfast which seemed interesting and unique to me I thought I would try it. My friend ordered the same thing and she had recommended it. We sat outside and there were heaters which definitely made it a little more enjoyable since it was chilly. Service was prompt and friendly. The Japanese breakfast consists of a couple little items combined on one plate. One includes their version of a miso soup that's kind of nontraditional (well, I've never been to Japan so perhaps this is real miso), a piece of cooked fish over some pickles, a side of rice, a poached egg and I think vinegar, and what appeared to be kimchi beans sprouts. People might have some qualms about eating fish for breakfast, but I don't mind and I thought the fish was cooked well but I didn't necessarily like it with the pickles, although I liked them separately. I didn't really care for the miso soup or their version of it  and I wished it was more savory and flavorful. But mixing the eggs, rice, and fish was excellent. They also have a really interesting menagerie of items on their menu that would be worth trying and going back for. Went on a Sunday morning around 1130 and it wasn't too crowded  but I hear it can get really crazy in the wait very long.

The menu is a bit small and they try reasonably hard to sell you wine at 50% off on Wednesdays. The service is reasonably good, and they take care of you pretty well. They go for a high-end stuck-up vibe which doesn't really match the open-kitchen cheap-chair ambience. I say this because they have to make it clear that they are providing an exception for you when their menu says that the entire table must order the 4 course meal, or none. On the good side of the high-end service, is that they do clean the table after courses, and help you pour water when needed.\n\nFor food, we got the 4 course meal + a main course of chicken. I found the portions a bit smaller for the 4 course meal. The chicken was a full entree and was cooked well - not dry meat in the middle and good flavour for the (not-crispy) skin. The bacon it came with was only ok, but the veggies were good. The appetizer for the 4 course meal was asparagus and well made. My only concern here was that some parts of the asparagus were too hard (and probably should not have been served). The arctic char and the lamb cheek were both good, small portions but an excellent combination of ingredients. Finally the dessert was excellent - it was a panna cotta with berries.

It was a lagunitas beer and tomato juice. Didn't taste anything else in there.  The menu says they make it with la tapatia sauce...maybe they forgot to put it in.  Also shared several pitchers of sangria.  It was not bad, but also not great.\n\nFood:  had the bbq rib hash.  3 tiny ribs.  Dry and bland.  By definition, a hash is supposed to have potatoes.   This thing had 5 small pieces of potato.  It was mostly quinoa and uncooked spinach.  Accurately, they need to call it a bbq rib salad.  Very disappointing. $17\n\nService.  Not knocking our waiter because he was very nice and attentive.  However, a minute after we ordered our food and drinks, the angry owner woman rushed over to tell us they have a $25 per seat minimum in the most condescending tone.  We were a party of 9, with 2 babies and 7 adults.  We ordered 9 entrees because we were going to share some dishes.  We also ordered lots of drinks.  I have no idea why she felt like she needed to treat us as if we weren't ordering enough for her to turn a profit on our table.   F#ck lady, we ordered 9 entrees for 7 people. Was that not enough?  Anyway, back to the story.  We question her policy, noting that this $25 per seat minimum is not indicated anywhere on the menu, on their website, on yelp, nor on opentable.  Her response was, \"I assume you would know that\", and walked away.  Well, we all know what assuming makes you, don't we.  At the end of our short meal, because we couldn't wait to leave this place after being treated like sh!t, she came over again and said we were $1 short of the minimum charge.  Could we have just added $1 to the bill and call it a day?  Nope, you have to order something.   Fine.  Dessert.  Happy?  With tax, automatic 19% gratuity, SF mandate, our tab came out to $300.  Did we meet our minimum?  Bye.  You suck.  Never coming back.", "author": "Peter M."}

However, as a SoMa-ite, it was on the edge of the world as far as I was concerned. The outer Outer Richmond since you can feel sea spray over there. Or at least I thought it was sea spray. Funny thing is that I've been to the bakery that previously inhabited that space, Le Bread, and judging from my long-forgotten Yelp review from back then, it was not a happy experience. But alas, just two words were able to bring Cassava and me together.\n\nNo, not \"Japanese breakfast\" - the words were \"dead jellyfish\". Thousands of them washed ashore at Ocean Beach. Had to see their glistening royal blue carcasses for the inevitable photo opportunity. So since I was in the vicinity, I thought I'd give Cassava a try. It looks like they've expanded the space since the Le Bread days into a light, airy cafe with white subway tiles, heather blue walls, artistically drawn chalkboards and patio seating (photo: http://bit.ly/1uUH5b1). All of it was quite inviting though I had to wait about five minutes for a table for one. Once seated, the service was cordial with staff dressed nattily in pinstripe aprons.\n\nI have to admit the weekend brunch menu was full of temptations, half with an Asian twist and the other half more new jack American (photo: http://bit.ly/VEhi7A). I was seriously eyeing the $17 72-hr Braised Short Ribs \"Hash\" Bowl with Poached Egg, but the hostess Yuka went down on her knee and broke the news to me that they were out of it. I managed to avoid a heavy sigh and ordered the $12 Meatball + Curry & Fried Egg, an Indian-derived treat that takes as its base the tomato cream curry sauce found in butter chicken dishes, adds several meatballs made of tofu and beef, and then places a fried egg sunny side up on top.\n\nIt came with a scoop of rice with paneer cheese and a bit of lettuce lightly doused in some dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1pZlr0O). Mild subcontinental peasant fare is how I would describe it, and it was delicious in the morning. Yuka came back and lured me with their $5 Madagascar Vanilla Panna Cotta, which they describe accurately as a \"super creamy Italian Milk flan\" surrounded by macerated berries and orange chunks (photo: http://bit.ly/VElR1B). Speckled with real vanilla bean, it was ridiculously good. The two Asian girls at the next table were gawking at me and obviously exhibited more willpower than I did in not ordering it. But what the hell? I was somewhere near Timbuktu, right?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...clean, creative executions on Asian-accented dishes\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...an open, inviting space \nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive and special props to Yuka\nTOTAL - 4 stars...perhaps the Outer Richmond doesn't require a passport and shots", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-11", "description": "Went for dinner on Saturday, January 28th 2017.  Found Cassava through the Restaurant Week event. It took us almost 2 hours to get there from Livermore (heavy traffic on the 580 & going across the bay bridge), couldn't find parking (eventually found a spot a couple blocks away), and we seriously needed to pee by the time we got there! (I know - TMI.)  After taking care of necessities, we needed wine, and needed it fast! The staff was friendly and professional (a good balance is critical to me), we were seated right away and, working with the waiter, we found a nice glass of Pierce Ranch Tempranillo to unwind with while we reviewed the menu.\n\nWe did the pre fix menu.  Here's what we had:\nBurrata Salad  - not part of the pre fix but we just had to try it - delicious! This comes with toast so you can scoop up the gooey burrata and the apple chutney. All the flavors meld nicely - you could make a meal of this salad.  Good thing we shared it because we had a lot more food coming.\n\nNantes carrot \"salad\" - best damn carrot I've ever had - seriously!  You look at the plate and there's this whole carrot lying there amid an artful array of beets, purees, and micro-greens.  You're thinking to yourself, uh, this is just a carrot on a plate. lol I'll probably never have a carrot like that again. It had the most interesting, and yummy, infusion of spices and perfectly tender crisp.  Mmmm.  Oh, and the beets were good too.  :-) Alain Passard would be proud!!\n\nChinook Salmon - beautiful piece of fish cooked perfectly. Crispy blackened skin was so good and the flesh melted in your mouth it was so tender.  This little beauty comes on a bed of black rice with bacon tidbits - a totally scrumptious, hearty divine mesh of goodness.  \n\nBeek Cheeks - hmmm, was getting full by the time this arrived so this entre was not the star of the night for me.  It reminded me of slow cooker pot roast. (I love a good pot roast so not saying this dish was sub par - just wasn't in the mood for it.) The accompanying roasted cauliflower was excellent though (they do something with vegetables here that defies reasoning).  If you're a person who doesn't like fish, this entre is totally in your wheelhouse. \n\nPanna Cotta - I loved this dessert.  I love panna cotta in general and this didn't disappoint.  The flavors imparted to the custard were subtle and wonderful on the palate.  Very refreshing end to the meal with the mint infusion and fresh berries.  As part of the pre fix, this came with a glass of cream sherry. They went very well together but I think a nice mint tea would have been sublime for me.\n\nTip: Since we had a glass of wine before dinner, one with each entr\u00e9e, and the sherry with the dessert, we walked down to the look at the ocean at the end of the street and then back up to the La Promenade Caf\u00e9 (closes at 10PM) for lattes before we got on the road back to Livermore.  This is a charming neighborhood area and things are very quiet here in the evening hours.\n.", "author": "Nancy A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-05", "description": "[BACKGROUND]\n\nWith a place named Cassava, I half-expected boba :P  (FYI cassava is the plant that boba pearls are made from... thus justifying my postulate that boba is legitimately a food staple). \n\nWe came here for a weekend brunch and made a reservation just in case, but it would have been a minimal wait, unlike the places with a mob of laissez-faire hipsters with nothing better than to do than to spend an hour waiting for brunch.  Parking is also reasonable (unimpossible meter street parking).  Service is not super speedy, so expect to pay for about an hour of parking, even if you made a reservation.\n\n[FOODIE MEETS HIPSTER]\n\nAnyways, Cassava turned out to be quite lovely, with unique cuisine and a modern ambiance.  It's kinda-sorta-not really fusion, bordering geographically the American and Asian areas of the Richmond and serving the curious Japanese breakfast.\n\nI love how the menu has none of that over-priced boring eggs/bacon/toast, but is solely (soully? :P) restricted to the experimental foodie goodies.  I believe it changes, probably according to seasonal local availability blah blah blah.  On the downside, it is fairly limited--half a page of appetizers, half a page of entrees, a back side of dranks.  However, only having ~5 entree options is a blessing for indecisive people.  \n\nAs for the hipster elements, you would've guessed, water served in mason jars.  The tables are pretty, with the rustic wood and real flowers.  There's a nice outdoor seating area as well, for the rare days of good weather in the Outer Richmond.  The check is brought to you in a whimsical wooden clip, along with a recipe that I think is ours to keep.  Servers are in colorful suits with ties (props to them for dressing up the ladies so fashionably in such a risque outfit).  I was surprised when the server taking my plate exclaimed \"You finished!!!\", but the owner of the restaurant read my Yelp review and kindly messaged me to clarify that they were happy I finished the food, not that I was being a fatty P:\n\n[NOMS, TAKE 1]\n\nI originally intended to get the MEATBALLS WITH FRIED EGG, self-proclaimed on the menu to be a favorite.  The actual menu didn't mention the fried egg though, so I changed my mind as 1) there is no such thing as brunch without eggs 2) without the fried egg it would have just looked like tikka masala i.e. PG-13 food porn.\n\n[NOMS, TAKE 2]\n\nI splurged for the 72 HR BRAISED SHORT RIBS \"HASH\" with roasted potatoes, quinoa, poached quail egg, romaine lettuce, shaved fennel, kumquats ($17).  Quotes on a menu item usually signify a big risk (for example, never get \"pizza\").  As expected, it was not what I expected at all, but thankfully, in a good way.  Instead of a greasy fried dehydrated mess of beef and hash browns, it was... a salad.  There was arugula instead of plain old romaine lettuce, and orange instead of kumquats (or maybe I just can't tell the difference).  \n\nI don't know whether there is some culinary rule about how long hash has to be cooked for; Griddle Fresh boasts of a similar 72h hash.  Economically, I guess you are getting more bang for your buck if you are eating something it took them 72h to make.  I don't know whether my palate can detect how long it's been cooked for, but I can attest to the fact that it was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  \n\nSome people may dislike the fact that there isn't really a sauce for the \"salad\"/\"hash\", but I found all the ingredients to complement the nutty arugula extremely well: the fatty beef, grainy quinoa, and hearty roasted potatoes.  Admittedly, I am not the hugest fan of quail eggs because I never know how to eat them--pop the small egg into your mouth and pop the soft-boiled-ness whole, or break it like a Benedict and mix it into the salad a la bibimbap?  Overall though, the hash was delicious, satisfying, and relatively healthy.  \n\n[NOMS, TAKE 3]\n\nMy friend got the JAPANESE BREAKFAST of Koshihikari rice, ichiban dashi miso soup, sous vide \"onsen tamago\" poached egg, Meyer lemon \"kosho\" natto, daikon wakame salad, market pickles, salt Pepper Crusted Albacore Tataki ($13).  The small portions of everything and monk-like simplicity appeared Japanese indeed.  We were pretty happy with everything except the fermented beans seemed a bit funky to us.  It's a rather healthy option, until you get hungry afterwards and grab Purple Kow down the street.", "author": "Edna C."}

What you should take away from the size is that the restaurant is making small, delicious batches of its menu items, and is not churning out monster quantities of food meant to feed massive crowds.  Instead, you get really fresh tasting and flavorful plates assembled in detail by the chef and his team.\n\nWe tried their pork ribs appetizer, grilled brussell sprouts, seared albacore over lentils, and ribeye w/ potatoes, and each plate was chocked full of flavor and simply wonderful.  The ribs dropped off the bone, the albacore was unique and tender, and the ribeye was executed to perfection. We weren't able to stay for dessert, but will come back sometime for that for sure.  \n\nCassava is a brilliant star of a restaurant in an emerging neighborhood business district.  I'm thrilled to be your neighbor and will be back regularly for your delicious concoctions for any and all mealtime cravings!", "author": "Andy S."}

It's just not right to feel that way at a restaurant, you know? \n\nAnd three, YOUR STAFF TOOK LIKE 3 PICTURES OF US IN TOTAL, one of them offered to take the picture...we didnt even ask her, but she was nice enough to offer!

There's an extremely comfortable vibe coming from Yuka that is extremely rare to find in a person.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nStarters\n\nHot Links - made with cherry tomatoes, onions, mushrooms with a side of Kewpie mayo.  Nothing unique.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow - came with four pieces of brioche.  As I don't eat beef, I'm not sure if the dish was good.  Hubby and friends seemed to enjoy it.  It had a buttery fatty taste as I was told.\n\nEntrees:\n\nA & A both ordered the meatballs in curry & fried egg dish, which came with a side of rice.  The dish was beautifully plated.  Unfortunately, they said the dish lacked curry flavor and the meatballs were bland.  The rice was hard as it probably didn't have enough water.  They said it almost tasted a day old.\n\nI ordered the porchetta, which is pork belly rolled with basil and walnut pesto.  The pork belly was very tender and melted in your mouth.  I couldn't taste the basil and walnut pesto.  There was also a side of butternut squash pur\u00e9e, which gave the dish more color.  \n\nMy friend ordered the autumn polenta cake, which came with brussel sprouts, butternut squash, kale, and heirloom cherry tomatoes.  I thought her dish was beautifully plated from the vibrant colors of the vegetables and polenta.  The polenta was yummy and I tasted a bit of truffle.  It was probably my favorite dish of the night.\n\nDessert:\n\nSweet Pastry Bread Pudding - a mixture if croissants and pastries from the morning.  I'm normally not a fan of bread pudding, but this was yummy. It had a strong citrus flavor and wasn't too soggy.\n\nMadagascar Vanilla Panna Cotta -  it was plated beautifully, but too sweet for my liking.\n\nAlthough some of the dishes were hit or miss, I do think they offer excellent service.  You can't always please everyone's taste buds, right?  I plan to return and try their tasting menu.\n\nThanks again Yuka for your hospitality! =)", "author": "Candice H."}

So on one random Saturday morning, that's exactly what I did!\n\nI came in to try their brunch menu and tried to go early enough to make sure that I would get a seat.  But even getting there at around 10:30am the place was packed!  Luckily, there was one seat left in there for me right after I ordered my food.\n\n**Note:  this visit was before they had expanded and the food items that I ordered may or may not be on their current menu because it is seasonal.\n\nSo there were two things that I ordered.  The first item was their Quiche because it made 7x7's 100 Things to Try Before You Die list.  And the other item was their Shrimp and Avocado Sliders which was really the main reason that made me bookmark Cassava in the first place. \n\nQuiche -- http://bit.ly/XLlhvw\nYeah.  This sucker was good and I've had a nice fair share of quiche at other places.  The egg filling writh the veggies (looked like mushrooms and zucchini) was nice and fluffy while the crust had a lite crunch to it.  It totally deserves to be on the 7x7 list.\n\nShrimp & Avocado Sliders --  http://bit.ly/X3d6ME\nIf the quiche was good, these were EPIC!  Huge pieces of shrimp and a nice amount of avocado in these brioche buns.  I definitely took my time with these because every bite was full of awesomeness!\n\nSpiced Honey Latte --  http://bit.ly/15bkI1v\nThis drink sounded so interesting and since it was on top of their drink menu, I had to try it.  I don't necessarily remember what was in it, but I really enjoyed this too!  Had a very light sweetness to it while having some kick to it.  Almost like chai in a way.\n\nThat was a nice trifecta of good stuff that I ordered and it's too bad that I couldn't try everything that day because I was stuffed after my meal.  I would definitely come back and dedicate another Saturday morning for another brunch session and also to try their dinner pre-fixe menus because they sound really good!\n\nSince that last visit, I'm really glad to see that they've expanded the cafe and I'm really looking forward to my next meal over there!", "author": "Rodney H."}

Cassava is tucked away from bustle that normally crowds the Richmond and Inner Sunset neighborhoods but it is a really great find. The atmosphere is really laid back and I love the decor inside, especially the fun urban themed damask wallpaper! We came here for lunch after trying to go to Outerlands and finding it would be an hour wait. On a Monday. I was really glad coming here to find that there were plenty of tables open. You might think that because there isn't a huge line of people waiting outside, that Cassava must not be that great, but I think it might speak more to how out of the way the location is because the food was great! Boyfriend and I had the honey spiced latte with whole milk, the randwich, and the meatballs in curry with rice. \n\nThe tomato curry tasted as you would probably expect it to. It wasn't anything spectacular but I think it tasted like a fun and interesting take on spaghetti and meatballs. The randwich was incredibly tasty though. The side salad was citrusy and light, and the soft boiled egg inside the sandwich took it from tasty to incredible... yummm. I'm a total sucker for runny egg yolks though! And of course, as many have said before, the honey spiced latte was delicious! I'm not even much of a coffee lover/drinker. (: \n\nI wish Cassava was a little easier to get to because I want to try more things here, but I think if it was, it would be just as annoyingly crazy busy as all the other popular brunch places.

We had to get to a fundraiser after dinner, so we opted for just a salad and our entrees.\n\nWe started with a shared salad of mustard greens, pomegranate seeds, and Asian pears.  It was the perfect starter to get our taste buds tantalized!  I was well balanced over baby kale with a sweet molasses vinegar/beetroot yogurt dressing.  Yum!\n\nMy gal opted for the pan-seared salmon and it was perfectly cooked (and she's a fantastic cook in her own right)!  Accompanied by black rice, bacon, mustard greens, and a winter squash puree, I just had to have a taste for myself--and yes, it 's flavors were spot on.\n\nI, on the other hand, chose the oven roasted Mary's chicken.  Folks, this is half a chicken, so there's plenty to share of the juiciest, most flavorful roasted chicken ever!  To quote my lady: \"it's the most delicious roast chicken I have ever eaten!\". Combine that with kale, honey nut squash, Nepalese barley, and broccoli sprouts, and the meal was complete and ever so filling.  \n\nThe perfect accompaniment to our meals were the glasses of Coppola Pinot Noir--WOW!

My friends got different dishes that I thought were unique.  It's not your typical brunch menu.  I was bummed out though that they didn't have decaf coffee.", "author": "Claire J."}

This place is close to my heart and home and I haven't written them a review for many years, but they deserve it. Most people come for brunch or lunch, but what most people fail to realize is that their dinner is even more scrumptious than the daytime meals. Most small restaurants can't boast having a drink menu that can stand up to the food pairings, but sometimes I'll just come for that sweet honey-spiced latte that only they concoct. They change their menu all the time because they use fresh, in-season, and local ingredients. You can't go wrong with any dish you order here. Try their dinner before it gets packed and there's a line out the door!\n\nAnd to the people complaining about the service they're getting, maybe you're just assholes who have no idea what it's like to work in the grueling service industry, because I have been coming here since they opened, and not once have I ever felt rushed or slighted or forgotten by their staff. The owners are incredibly generous, warm, and hard-working, and I've seen them bend over backwards trying to please their often uppity and whiny customers. Trust me, I work in the industry and hearing the way some of you entitled brats talk about stuff you know nothing about is simultaneously hilarious and infuriating.", "author": "Heather U."}

I have a lot of respect for a biz owner who wants to go above and beyond to make a bad situation better.  Thanks, Yuka.\n------------------\nTerrible. Had on my list to try and finally did, wish I hadn't. With so many wonderful choices in SF don't waste your time with this place. \n\nService - uneven at best. We arrived on time for our reservation and our table wasn't quite ready. No big deal, we didn't wait very long to be seated (maybe 10 mins.), but that was the last time we didn't wait long. Once seated we waited 35 mins for someone to take our dinner order and no one came; I eventually I got up to find someone to help us. While apologetic, which we appreciated, you would have thought that this type of situation would have highlighted our table, but it happened time and time again throughout the meal. Odd things like my husband and I both wanted wine with dinner so I ordered a bottle, but our waitress misunderstood and brought both of us a by the glass pour. Our server made good by eventually bringing us the bottle but by the time she did so we were mostly done with our meal.\n\nAnd the food...our apps were fine. Salad and burrata were both fresh, but nothing spectacular, but the chicken rillettes was bland and forgettable. And our entrees...we were a 4-top, 2 people chose the steak (which contained \"silver skin\" throughout) it was tough and mostly inedible (note, one of our dinner companions mentioned his dissatisfaction to one of the waiters who picked up his mostly uneaten plate and he just sort of shrugged and smiled as if to say oh well); I had the squab which was overcooked and dry (and my sides were cold and odd tasting) and a fish dish which was ok. \n\nWe all had high hopes going in, but left sorely disappointed and somewhat embarrassed as I had chosen our destination. My advice, don't waste your time or money on this restaurant there are many, many better choices in SF.", "author": "jennifer s."}

They're known for their Japanese breakfast, which is unique, fresh and worth trying.  This is one of the hottest sellers on their menu.  You get a great variety of items to taste on the tray, which one of their staff will need to explain how to enjoy.  It's worth noting that the ingredients used for their Japanese breakfast, in particular, are incredibly fresh.  You probably will not taste anything like their ichiban dashi miso soup anywhere else!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-04", "description": "Cassava, similar to its likely competitor, Marla Bakery down the block, makes you forget you are in the Richmond district of SF. If you grew up as a native around these parts of the city like I have, you'll know that New American eateries were unheard of. It wasn't until recent years that this Russian and Chinese populated area gave us something other than old and boring to be excited about.\n\nParking can be a pain if you go on certain times of the day.  Makes you wonder if it's worth eating up 2 gallons of gas before you even get to eat what's on the menu.  Well, if you happen to be stuck in that most unfavorable scenario, just let me clear your frustration and road rage now by telling you it is soooooooo worth it. If you happen to catch me leaving there, I'll gladly give up my space for a bribe that will conveniently cover the cost of gas I used up to find my space... and then some.  Haha... Cruel.  Hey pay it forward... that's a great idea if you ask me.\n\nWhen the parking ordeal is over, walking into Cassava is a breath of fresh air and maybe even a breath of pollen as your road rage and anger is subdued by the clean quaint setting that resembles something like that of a summer cottage brunch with white plates atop wood grain tables smiling with a touch of fresh lovely seasonal flowers.\n\nThis cottage charm gives way to a small unique menu of Japanese/American fare that highlights fresh tasty ingredients. Although not made in house, they offer delightful pastries from the famous Semifreddi's bakery. On a cold windy autumn's day, a cup of their house made hot cocoa, Bourbon mocha, or mint honey rose tea reminds us how nice it is to be indoors sipping from a hot steamy mug with an elegant date. \n\nAs we waited for our orders of Tuna Melt and the Randwich, we enjoyed some laughs and selfies over steamy hot sips and a sweet light fluffy morning bun.  A great start to such a relaxing early afternoon before each of us had to head to work. Our eyes glistened with utter delight as our sandwiches made it to our table. The ever lovely Gigi M. has a habit of pressing her hands against her cheeks while her eyes light up as her jaw drops when she sees or tastes something that excites her... You know it's nothing short of amazing when she makes that face. Within seconds, she snaps away, easily capturing the most IG perfect square to enlighten her friends of her proud new find.  I knew how she must've felt... Everything was indeed picture perfect.\n\nI quickly found myself mesmerized by the luscious green of the pesto and the waterfall of a bright sunny yellow yolk flowing from my 'Randwich'; A seductive combination of roasted turkey, avocado, tomato, spinach, pesto, and poached egg in between warm toasted foccacia bread.  It was one of those moments where you reluctantly take a bite into a sandwich because it was that much of an eye candy. I mean, could you imagine the fight I had within myself?  If I eat it all, I won't be able to see it again!  To eat or not to eat? That is the question Prince Hamlet would have asked if faced with a Randwich. To eat... The unequivocal answer when it comes to this kind of Hunger Games. Like the \"house\", Morning famine always wins. The Randwich... Yums.\n\nThe tuna melt didn't disappoint either. A crispy bite of grill pressed white bread enticingly introduced us to a warm gooey creamy layer of good ole American cheese, fresh cool tomato, and a light creamy tuna brightened with lemon and little sweet crunchy crystals of shallots. A childhood favorite that never seems to get old no matter how many times or how many ways you've had it very much like watching a sunset or playtime in bed with your lover. *Wink*\n\nWe rested our bellies as she enjoyed the earthy roast of their Bourbon Mocha while I, the fragrant Rose tea enliven with mint sweetened with honey. Warm and cozy indoors, we each tapered off our breakfast/lunch date with a few pages of good read we had brought with us.\n\nThe bottom of our cups didn't fail to remind us that it was 20 minutes before work on another manic Monday. We unwillingly left the comfort of our afternoon sanctuary and back into the brisk autumn SF air. I would have loved to take a bribe from someone in dire need of parking, but it seems Mondays are a good day to be here... no mental torture finding parking, save a couple gallons of gas to pay meter instead, no wasted money on bribe, and a wonderful breakfast/brunch.\n\nNote: Although the hostess at the register comes off as standoffish, the overall experience was, is, and will be a fond first here at Cassava. There will surely be many more. Friendlier vibes and house made pastries would definitely put them up at a 5 for me. I was slightly on the fence between 4 and 5.  As my emotional high settled, a 4 seemed much more fitting. Enjoy!\n\nEdit: Host maybe owner reached out for genuine feedback! Love Cassava even more that they care. See compliment from Cassava B. n my response. Looking forward to giving 5 next time!", "author": "Colin M."}

Sometimes it takes us forever to decide what to order if there are too many options. I started with a spiced honey latte, which is right up my alley. I love anything chai/spicy and honey flavored.

They use real honey so it was overly sweet but it definitely had that nice after taste to it. \n\nI went with the smoked trout hash which was basically a quinoa salad with roasted potatoes topped with smoked fish, grape tomatoes, some citrus fruits, and a soft poached egg. It was definitely a very light and refreshing meal compared to my usual heavy brunch orders.

When my foodie gals proposed a dinner here I immediately jumped on the chance. My review is strictly for f dinner and coffee. \n\nCassava just recently started doing pop up dinners. They are by reservation only, so get on it!\n\nWe were a few minutes late for our reservation (curse you Outside Landers!) but we were warmly greeted Yuka. She understood that our beloved city was in a state of chaos (Outside Lands, Giants AND 49er game) and was way cool about our girlfriend being late as well. But!!! Please try to be on time.. Very small kitchen so meals need to be timed properly. \n\nThe inside of Cassava is very cozy and inviting. Tiffany blue walls and inspirational messages all over. In the display window sits branches with ecosphere globes! Such a cute decoration! \n\nOkay but on to the food.\n\nAmuse bouche: Burrata, Maldon sea salt, basil oil and sunflower seeds.  - I actually hate Burrata but ate most of this because it was GOOD. That basil oil was very refreshing.\n\nEnglish pea \"salad\" English pea \"panna cotta\" , fried chickpeas , nasturtium leaves, edamame, shiso flowers. - Sweet and delicately minty from the shiso flowers.\n\nMinestrone. Clarified tomato & fennel broth, marinated pearl onions, tomato jam, cranberry beans - Uhmmmm LOVE. Lightest minestrone I've ever had and the beans were delicious. I don't know why I kept calling them garbanzo beans when it said CRANBERRY BEANS on the menu smack dab in front of me but  I want more. I found myself craving it last night.\n\nKurobuta porchetta. Berkshire pork belly 2 ways. L: sous-vide. R: w/ caramelized onion jam, jalape\u00f1o, \"sunny side\" quail egg, stewed apples and cauliflower pur\u00e9e - the sous-vide pork belly was mostly fat, not enough meat but the other one was perfect! Even ratio of meat and fat.\n\nIntermezzo: Orange Lemon Granita. Orange lemon flavored ice. Sweet, light and refreshing. Reminded me of Japanese sodas. Delicious.\n\nBranzino en papillote. Branzino, kale, oven dried tomato, wood ear mushrooms, olives and tomato beurre blanc. I found the olives to be a tad too salty for my liking but I loved the wood ear and kale. This sat underneath the branzino and sopped up all the lovely flavors of the fish. Doesn't look like much, but it was umami\n\nDessert: Nutella lemon curd pot de creme. Pate sucree cinnamon cookies, rosemary apricot preserve.  LOVELY!.\n\n\nAfter all this, I could barely keep my eyes open. Had a soy honey latte which was really good but food coma won.

If you cannot decide what to order she patiently explains the choices and offers recommendations without being pushy.\n\nAt Cassava I have tried: \n\nPeanut Butter Cornflake Cookie\nQuiche Today\nCaffe Latte\nRandwich!\nShrimp + Avocado Sliders\nMeat Balls + Curry\nPatisserie Philippe Macaron\nDiamant Cookie\nMarch \"Spring is Near!\" Tasting Menu\n\nThe lunch items were delicious but a little pricy. The macarons were different from what I tired before. The center had a cream-like consistency sandwich between two super light and delicate cookies. I am a fan of macarons with more of a bite but these have a great flavor.\n\nAnd for dinner I really enjoyed the tasting menu, which I had before the remodel. Seven courses for $52/person was very affordable. The portions were perfect - I left satisfied but not overstuffed. I am excited to return to see how it has expanded and changed after the remodel. \n\nWhat I recommend:\n-- dinner tasting menu", "author": "Andrew W."}

I had looked at the online menu and knew right away that I wanted to get the braised short rib hash.  I'm a big fan of corned beef hash, so this dish sounded perfect.\n\nWe had a reservations, so we were seated on time.  The restaurant was busy, so we patiently waited for a server to come by and take our order.  We ended up having to flag someone down.  We ordered the crab salad to share, I got the braised short rib hash and my friend got the Japanese breakfast.\n\nThe crab salad was basically crab meat sprinkled on top of a salad with blue cheese.  I generally love blue cheese on a salad, but it was a bit overpowering and it took away from the crab flavor.  My has looked really good when I got it.  But as I dug into it, there was way too much quinoa and not enough of the short ribs.  It was quite tasty, but just lacking in the meat department.  My friend liked her Japanese breakfast, but didn't care for the natto.  I had tried natto a while back, and warned her of the interesting taste and texture it had.  She was not a fan, but did like the rest of her meal.\n\nThis first visit wasn't a hit with me, but they do have other items on their brunch and dinner menu that look tempting.

I love that they take care of their customers, provide quality food with creativity and attention to detail with reasonable prices.  \n\nI still remember my very first experience here shortly after they opened- I ordered a morning bun and Yuka asked if I wanted it warmed up.  I was thinking, oooh warm would be nice, so I answered yet.  However, when she brought over the morning bun, it was not warmed.  I was actually fine with it, but then Yuka realized and was immediately so sincerely apologetic, she brought out another morning bun that is warmed for me.  WOW, that is service right there.  After that incident and having had their delicious curry meatball dish, I wanted to go back to try other foods.  Went back within the same week with a friend, and Yuka was again super nice to us.  There were no more seats inside, so she seated us outside with a special tiny folding table.  Made us feel special :)  Another time I came with my fiance on a gloomy windy day, Yuka provided us blankets to wrap ourselves with when we sat and ate outside!  \n\nSince then, I've been back many times and had the greatest pleasure with their dinner pop up tasting menu (before they expanded), which was soooo amazzing.  I was really blown away by the food that was put out without a real kitchen at the time.  I really miss that!  Now since they expanded and have outdoor heaters, I've been here for brunch/lunch and dinner altogether many times.  Never a time being disappointed!\n\nFor brunch, my favorite for a long time is their Mr. and Mrs. Croquette sandwich and curry meatballs.  Favorite drink is their honey spiced latte, so delicious!  Their new brunch menu item duck confit with salad is probably my new favorite because the duck was cooked so moist and tender, it just fell off the bone.  Hmmmm.  Fiance always orders their fresh juice and though we've tried everything on their menu, we always end up going back.  \nFavorite dinner items is their pop up dinner menu ( boo no more ) brined chicken, short ribs, and panna cotta!\n\nWait time is not as long as other brunch places in the city and you can make reservations in advance.

It was not a bad meal, it just wasn't the meal for me. I would say the only negative thing I could truly say about the meal is that there may be too much rice served with it for a breakfast. I think a smaller portion of rice is a better balance.  The parts of the Japanese Breakfast that I definitely did enjoy were the poached egg, the miso soup (full of good bits and bites), and the additional seared albacore. My least favorite part was the Meyer lemon \"kosho\" natto. I have no doubt it's very much an acquired taste and texture. The friend who recommended this place to me loves the Japanese Breakfast. It seems to be a popular item, so obviously it's well-enjoyed. Just not by me.\n\nThe Maple Liege Waffle Plate, on the other hand, might have been one of the best breakfasts I had during my little vacation. Everything presented on this plate was perfect. The perfectly textured scrambled egg with a little bit of runny egg in it resulting in some of the most tender and tasty scrambled egg I've put in my mouth. The not sweet but not too savory waffle. The thick and crisp and chewy bacon.  The combination of ricotta and rhubarb compote and the fruit. Even the little addition of salad was welcome. It was just a balanced breakfast of flavor, texture, presentation, and deliciousness.\n\nWith either orange juice or a green tea, I felt pretty satisfied. I love the look of the place and the look of my more traditional area breakfast choice, and I love the way they execute and present their meals. Definitely an enjoyable breakfast spot in the Outer Richmond.", "author": "Cate T."}

As soon as I saw the deal, the smiling Joe Cool (me) showed the deal from my phone to the cute lady behind the counter. \"Man, don't you love technology and Yelp?\"\n\nThen she gave the bag of brownie bites to start my breakfast.

No time to sit and eat but let's just run in grab a menu and drink to check it out. \n\nLike other yelpers commented on the configuration seemed feng shui wrong-ordering /seating /two different condiment tables. One which stood right by the door. \n\nAnyway do not despair.... Let's order!  The small menu board behind the cashier in tiny writing included food options and inspirational quotes like being nice and kind. \n\nOrdered Hibiscus Rosewater Spritzer -$3.50 sounds fancy and refreshing.... Light on ice please. I almost always ask for this as \n1- ice dilutes my drinks 2- we live in freakin outer Richmond !  It's cold out here \n\nAs I wait for my drink I flip through their cafe book. Oh cool I thought. Maybe it's a recipe book. Nope it was filled with pictures of the staff and close up of pantry items... Strange. What's that about?  Why would I want a book with your face making coffee. \n\nAsian lady hands drink to me (I think others may have called her dragon lady. ) As I head out I noticed my drink looks half empty ?  I turn around she thinks I'm looking for lid. I say \"um don't you guys fill it up? \" This is a 16 oz cup folks for $3.50 mind you. Let me ask you fair minded yelpers-as a person with common customer service sense would you reply:\n\nA) oh I can fill it up for you with a smile \nB) make up some BS like the recipe calls for the portion with less ice \nC) offer to give money back with attitude \n\nAnswer: B &C. \n\nI could not believe it. Cassava. Why are you so cheap ? What recipe do you have for this glorious special drink that you can't just proportionately fill up drink in place of ice. I mean aesthetically it's just wrong. It's like ordering a burger and some one takes a bite and hands it to you. I was so shocked at her answer and the offer to give me my $ if I wasn't happy. Yes I wasn't happy. Use your common sense.

There are fancier places, there are cheaper places, there are closer places... but Cassava is exactly what I want in a neighborhood restaurant - comfortably casual, but with an elevated menu and overall experience. I wish I lived close enough to be a regular!\n\nThe service is always super friendly, and (thanks to an over-indulgent birthday meal with friends) have now enjoyed everything on the menu. The duck liver mousse and pork never disappoint, and the seafood, salads, and starters all hit the mark as well. Keep an eye out for the tongue-in-cheek wallpaper, as well as other small details sprinkled throughout the cozy space that give it a warmly welcoming, lived-in feel.\n\nDefinitely one of my go-to spots for out of town guests, especially after an afternoon at Ocean Beach or Lands End.", "author": "Daron H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-02", "description": "When my previous brunch plans fell through at the last minute, Cassava saved my Sunday.  After searching through pages and pages of San Franciscan brunch oases, they were able to take a reservation at a reasonable hour, and they offered up an interesting menu to boot.\n\nThe restaurant is adorable. There's lots of decorative charm, from the giant chalkboard mural along the back wall (which, according to its signature, has survived an impressive amount of time) to the baby-blue paint job to the table markers that ingeniously use playing cards instead of numbers.  I'm a huge fan of the list of specials next to the bar, which rewards patrons for dressing like cats and drinking wine on a weeknight.\n\nThe brunch menu has a fairly small number of options, but each of them sounded delicious.  The standout is the full Japanese breakfast, which serves hearty portions of rice, seaweed, and other East Asian staples.  I opted for the short rib \"hash\" while my sister ordered the waffle plate.\n\nThe waitress was very friendly, offering to swap out the bacon on the waffle plate for a more vegetarian-friendly avocado serving.  And by \"serving,\" I mean an entire scooped-and-sliced avocado that looked like it must have weighed ten pounds.  In fact, the entire plate was a sight - and a bite - to behold.  These are not the tasteless waffles you get for free when you stay at a Holiday Inn.  They're hearty, sweet, and decadent.\n\nAt first glance, I was disappointed by my hash.  The quinoa looked out of place, the poached egg was a tad overcooked, and the two short ribs were just thrown on top whole, bone and all.  I was about to raise an eyebrow, but such skepticism was unnecessary.  These ribs redefined \"fall off the bone\" tender.  The bones were so clean afterwards, I could have used them to perform surgery.  The hash ended up being just as delicious as it was unique; a far cry from the greasy, sloppy mess many similar dishes can become.\n\nA ridiculously-decadent chocolate mousse and a trio of delicious outsourced macarons ended a great meal.  I would have preferred if my hash was a bit warmer, and some acid treatment on the avocados might have helped their plate appearance; the side facing me was an unappetizing shade of gray-brown by the time it was served.  These are just minor issues, though, and I can't wait to try this place again.  Maybe for dinner and weeknight wine...", "author": "Eric W."}

The food had nice presentation. I loved the rib starter. The meat is so soft and juicy. I ordered the seared albacore and my friends ordered the scallop and pork. The overall experience in the restaurant was ok, beside it was kind of a long wait for the food to come. \n\nWhen I first had a bite, I felt some tingly sensation under my tongue, but I ignored. I only had 3 pieces then I didn't feel like having anymore. \n\nThe nightmare came after I got home. It was about 1-2 hours later when I started to feel headache and burning aches over my body. I thought I was just tired and needed to rest. But soon, my husband noticed my face was red and swollen like a balloon and my eyes were so red too. My heartbeat started to rise. I was scared. I have only had 2 slices of the albacore, the rest I took home for my husband. I don't have any kind of allergies in my life. And I eat everything. Nothing like this ever happened. Soon, my body was covered with big red patches along my arm and belly. My hands were shaking, my heartbeat continued to get faster, my breathing was more difficult. I almost passed out. My husband had to rush to the pharmacy to get Benadryl. In the meanwhile, I tried to throw up and drank a ton of water, the symptoms lasted for about 45min. I thought it was just me, but my husband ate the rest of the fish after I got home. After I finally got better, his face started to swollen like mine.....then I was certain it was the fish. \n\nI have had albacore numerous times in my life, both raw and cooked. I never had any reaction. This was like a life threatening experience to me. Maybe I was unlucky, or maybe their seafood was just not fresh...but WATCH OUT!! Do not order the fish...

A clear, sunny SF day, the doors and windows were open, which created a very welcoming and light atmosphere. There were also small vases of cute flowers at every table. I also loved seeing the different ties the waitresses had -- it was so hip and cute at the same time! They also serve you your beverage in jars / water in wine bottles -- a nice touch to the whole \"hip and cute\" theme. :)\n\nI ordered the Mr and Mrs Croque sandwich, which came with a fresh side of salad. The salad was very well dressed and just the right amount. The sandwich itself was generous with its portions of turkey and roast beef, and the egg was cooked perfectly. The bread was also very thick and toasted well, which held everything together nicely. I also added the avocado for an extra $1, and it really was the cherry on top! I was very full after my meal -- though I really wanted to try their desserts.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-05-08", "description": "Bottomline: HORRIBLY unprofessional service, BUGS IN FOOD, and BEWARE, the restaurant owner may violate your privacy and leave a Yelp comment with your FULL NAME if you leave an undesirable review (which violates Yelp's Content Guidelines)\n\nIssue 1: Two of us went for brunch on Mother's Day. The restaurant was only 70-75% full yet we were seated ~15 minutes past our reservation time with no explanation or apology \n\nIssue 2: Salad was nothing special except, wait for it, BUGS! My friend had a particularly enthusiastic FLY buzzing around under the leaves of lettuce and I discovered a oddly energetic WORM squirming in a pool of dressing. We didn't want to make a scene and politely flagged down the waiter to have him remove the insect-infested salads. The waiter half-heartedly apologized and joked, \"the chef says 'at least you know it's fresh'\". No one from the staff even offered to provide us with the alternate appetizer to compensate for the bug-salad. After we raised this concern, that was the last we saw of our waiter or any wait staff for that matter. They seemed to have just given up on us assuming we wouldn't tip well due to the fact that our salads already had bugs in them (heck, right?)\n\nIssue 3: The restaurant owners and staff are incredibly UNACCOMMODATING and downright RUDE to handicapped/disabled people. I have a broken ankle (we're talking BROKEN, like screws, metal plate, wrapped in a bright red cast) and went in with my crutches. 1) No one from the restaurant offered me a seat to sit while waiting for our table (past our reservation time). Instead, a kind customer waiting to be seated saw me and pulled out a seat for me to sit so I wouldn't have to balance on one leg the entire time. 2) My ankle needs to be elevated so my friend and I asked to use a chair for a neighboring table since they were a party of 3 with 4 chairs. The neighboring table didn't mind at all and willingly let us have the chair to rest my ankle on. Once the party of 3 left the restaurant, the hostess literally, I kid you not, removed the chair from beneath my ankle, placed it back at the empty 4-person table, and walked away without even offering another chair to prop my ankle on. The restaurant was NOT full so there were empty chairs that weren't being used. My friend had to flag someone down to ask for another chair since the one I was using was literally taken from under me. This treatment was just appalling as I've been out to dine at restaurants many times while I've been injured and restaurant staff have always been very accommodating. However, the people at Cassava weren't just unaccommodating, they were aggressively rude and alienating about my injury. I can't imagine going back with an elderly person with a cane or a someone in a wheelchair. Who knows what mistreatment the rude people at Cassava will subject them to?\n\nIssue 4: To make matters worse, my friend who I was dining with left a review about the restaurant documenting our extremely horrific experience. Immediately thereafter, the owner of Cassava left a passive aggressive comment on my friend's review and DISCLOSED MY FRIEND'S FULL NAME. This is a huge violation of not only my friend's privacy, but also Yelp's Content Guidelines as business owners are not allowed to publicize private information, especially full names. Makes me wonder what else this business owner is capable of doing with customer's private information. It's also just pathetic to publicize confidential information like a customer's full name in a sad attempt to get back at the customer and taint his/her reputation.

The soup came with some pea shoots and toasted quinoa, and had a great crunchy yet fine texture to the thick soup, very satisfying. My friend got the japanese breakfast, which had the sexiest poached egg I'd ever seen. When cut, the yolk oozed out, but more viscous than a runny sunny side up. Awesome. Turns out they sous vide the suckers, and one of the owners was happy to share their settings to create their \"onsen\" tamago, but also suggested how I could approximate it just by boiling (thanks for the tip!). She later asked us politely after clearing our dishes if we would be willing move in order to seat a family of 7 waiting to dine before they close. Of course that was no problem; we still wanted to check out the dessert menu. There was some intriguing stuffs listed there, but I didn't wanna over stuff myself, so opted to save it for another day.

I will share some of my favorite dishes I've tried.\n\nJapanese Breakfast: $10 \nThis dish is truly unique to Cassava. My only complaint would be the fermented beans, one of the side dishes of this plate. The taste is overwhelming and slightly bitter and sour. The first time tasting this, I almost spit it out. However, my second time getting this dish I requested to not have the beans. I liked the concept of the poached egg on the side and ended up pouring it onto my rice, giving the rice a more creamy and satisfying texture and taste. The miso soup is not the usual soup one may order at a typical Japanese restaurant, this one tasted heartier and had  slices of some vegetable. This is a blend of Japanese fusion incorporated into a single dish of heaven and is able to intertwine different flavors complementing each other.\n\nSlow Roasted Pork Shoulder Sliders: $12\nThis would have to be my ultimate favorite dish here. Tender and juicy slices of pork resting on toasted warm buns. The meat is so yummy (fat included) but since I like my meat without too much fat, I had to remove the excess fat from the shoulder. This dish is served with a side salad, although it was nothing special to me. This is a must get.\n\nOverall, I've enjoyed my different experiences at Cassava.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-21", "description": "Cassava is a very cute little restaurant in the Outer Richmond. One pro is that you can make a reservation beforehand so that you're not waiting an hour for brunch like most other places in San Francisco!\n\nI highly recommend the coffee drinks. My sister got the bourbon mocha and I got the spiced honey latte. Both are delicious and made with Ritual Coffee. If you can't drink milk, you can choose to have soy or almond milk substituted for 50 cents extra.\n\nI also highly recommend the smoked trout shared plate. I never thought that smoked trout, ricotta, arugula, and a bit of orange would be such a great combo. It is really delicious! It was definitely my favorite thing that we ate.\n\nThe main plates are okay. There is an interesting mix of Japanese and American comfort food cuisine to choose from. I got the Mr. and Mrs. Croque (fried egg, avocado, turkey, ham, tomato), which was tasty, but not anything too special. My mom got the Japanese breakfast (rice, miso soup, pickled vegetables, two poached eggs), which was cute, but very spare and simple. My sister got the curry with meatballs. I tried a meatball and thought it was a bit rubbery.\n\nOverall, I would recommend it if you're craving brunch and don't want to wait forever to get seated!", "author": "Wendy S."}

I haven't been able to try its breakfast or lunch menu yet, so this review is solely about its pop-up dinners on Fridays. From beginning to end, the dinner was an incredibly fun, surprising experience, and I'm glad I was I introduced to it right when it reopened. \n\nEnvironment: The first thing you notice when you walk into Cassava is its homey environment. With recent renovations, it has doubled in size, allowing for four-or-five tables to be set up for dinner. The atmosphere is cozy, and one of my favorite visuals is its wall-paper. Look closely and you'll see the French detailing is actually made up of fire hydrants, rats and pigeons. \n\nService: Kris and Yuka are incredibly warm and inviting. You can tell they love what they do. Yuka is a great hostess and was very attentive to our needs. Kris is a great cook specializing in fine dining cuisine. It may seem odd at first for a cafe/bakery place, but the husband-wife duo make a great combination. \n\nDinner: First of all, the tasting menu features a quote from Rajesh Koothrapali of Big Bang Theory fame - \"This, is the difference between eating and dining.\" The dishes were delicious from beginning to end. Some of the highlights for me was an onion consomme with onion jam, crispy braised oxtail, and cucumber/cumin gelee (which melted when the consomme was poured on top and created a really fresh taste); herlook tomato terrine with sturgeon caviar and queso Oaxaquena (suuuuuper creamy and went great with the saltiness of the caviar); the Brentwood corn pudding; and the burnt caramel lemon flan with pistachio nougatine. \n\nI'm no foodie so I couldn't pronounce half the words on the menu, but I can describe how it tasted with one sound : \"yummmmmmmmmmm!\"\n\nI ended the night with a to-die-for bourbon honey mocha. Although the meal was light enough to keep me from feeling sluggish, I needed an extra pick-me-up before hititng up the city's nightlife. \n\nThe whole experience ended up costing around $75, and it was money well-spent! I definitely recommend it for a date night or when you're feeling like going fancy with your friends.", "author": "Dyanna Q."}

Since I follow a vegan lifestyle, she made sure that there was something that I could eat here that was more substantial than, say, a salad.  She told me about a quinoa dish that sounded yum, that I was looking forward to trying.  \n\nWhen we got to Cassava the hostess spoke to my girlfriend while I read the menu on the outside window.  The place was crowded, so it couldn't be that bad, right?  And then something caught my eye.  Duck liver was listed as an ingredient in one of the entrees and I couldn't help but wonder....so I asked the hostess \"Do you serve foie gras here?\"  She kind of blushed and said \"Those items don't contain foie gras, but our valentines menu does.  We're thinking about discontinuing it...\" And she kind of trailed off.  I don't know about you, but I would rather not support a restaurant that supports cruelty to animals.  I mean, cmon there is plenty of delicious food to eat without supporting the slow death of hapless ducks.

The decor in the restaurant is very cute, with a damask print wall with little fire hydrants and city oriented details.  I had the Peaches & Pimm's (pictured) which was delicious!  I also ordered Cassava's \"Continental Breakfast\" for a lighter brunch.  Buttery croissant did not disappoint and the poached egg was perfect.  I also can't complain about the fresh fruit and greek yogurt! Granola seemed very fresh.  My favorite part about Cassava though was the portion sizes of plates.  The portion sizes were AMAZING! I hate going to restaurants where I either get too little food, or TOO MUCH.  My continental breakfast is pictured below, and I finished it all and was full at the end.  My friends ordered the Japanese Breakfast and the Meatballs in Curry with Rice + Fried Egg, and we were all very satisfied with our meals, and kept repeating \"I could have this every day for breakfast.\"  I'd also like to mention that the staff at Cassava is phenomenal - between food recommendations and casual conversation, they were very warm and welcoming!

Let me tell you why.\n\nTheir menu doesn't make sense. They somehow seem to pride themselves of their artisan food. But what is their theme? It looks as if someone put together a random combination of plates such as hibiscus glazed pork ribs, Japanese breakfast, and meatballs and curry. They don't seem to have a specialty. Honestly hearing them all in the same sentence makes me throw up a little bit. \n\nI had the Japanese breakfast. I'm Japanese, and I thought it was bad. Such little portions, and the rice was mushy. It's probably because they use brown rice and was afraid to cook dry because they tend to.  Japanese food, let me tell you, has a taste that flows, one small plate to another. They should compliment each other (as most dishes do). But this breakfast doesn't. They added some lemon flavor to the natto, the pickles were wayyy too salty and the only thing that complimented the huge mound of mushy rice was the miso soup. They also had an onsen tamago (egg) on the side which looked way out of place. \n\nIt takes them SO DAMN LONG for their food to come out. Simple is best. Their stuff is over complicated and you really taste the mediocrity in their food. The table next to us got their food after almost an hour, and the waitress offered to buy their lattes for them. What kind of service is that? There was another waitress that was literally doing nothing. She was just pacing around the whole time we were eating. Maybe she should be helping out in the kitchen since they're struggling to get orders out here.\n\nIt almost seems like the makers couldn't decide on what to focus on, so just put a bunch of random things together, added fancy names and called it a day. \n\nSorry for the novel but this place makes me angry.", "author": "Momoe K."}

I was super lucky that they still had ONE quiche left at 3pm (snuck in right before closing), and I was able to take it to go. I also ordered a couple of extra goodies:\n -Mushroom Quiche (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cassava-bakery-cafe-san-francisco?select=xFYZ79UuM6spb8mEAB3tvw#xFYZ79UuM6spb8mEAB3tvw): Delicious! The crust was buttery and flaky, and the mushroom filling had great flavor. However, the quiche was on the small side, so not sure if I would be full just eating this for breakfast or brunch. However, this is still a great add to the 7x7 list.\n -Passion Fruit Poppy Seed Macaron (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cassava-bakery-cafe-san-francisco?select=xFYZ79UuM6spb8mEAB3tvw#CyUpV0rSbX55huVPjHfewQ): YUM! The poppy seeds added an interesting texture, but they could be omitted since the passion fruit taste was wonderful, and I didn't want anything to detract from it. The texture of their macarons are a little grainier (which I like since it usually means it tastes more almond flavor and is chewier) so they're not super authentic Parisian macaron. I still loved it and would highly recommend it.\n -Green Tea Yuzu Macaron (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cassava-bakery-cafe-san-francisco?select=xFYZ79UuM6spb8mEAB3tvw#e9b-KBV_pZotkwZ77NrZLA): This flavor was just ok. I would've preferred the green tea flavor on its own and no yuzu marmalade, since the yuzu peel left a bitter aftertaste on your tongue.

The coffee also looked really good (they use Ritual Coffee beans), so I'll have to come back and try that out along with their other food items. They also sell items from Patisserie Philippe, and I purchased a bag of the Diamant Cookies (there were also bags of mini Palmiers).

I also bought a morning bun to share with my friends and it was sweet and delicious all heated up. \n\nMy only reservation from giving it a full five stars is that it's really not a practical place to have weekend brunch simply because it's so tiny with just a few small tables inside.

It's like they are complicating what should be an already good dish by trying to throw more into the mix. Trying to have unique food is great, but not when it comes at the expense of the overall flavor. We tried the Saturday brunch and has the grazed beef hash and the Mr and Mrs Monsieur. Both had great potential but were overwhelmed by the myriad flavors competing in the dishes.\n\nI'd like to come back and try some additional dishes to see if this is true of the entire menu or just limited to the recent Saturday brunch.", "author": "Shamim I."}

You should not have tables sitting un-set for that long while people are waiting.  The hostess told me that they did not have enough people to take care of the tables. WTF??!!  There are 9 of them working!  They all just move around very slowly. My 80-something grandmother moves faster than any of them, and she has problems with her knees! Seriously, they need to get their act together.  So far they get a minus 2 stars.\n\nSo the food came pretty quickly, which is great. We got the pork ribs appetizer.

I can go through, rating everything that I've tried on every occasion I've been here since they were a little shop with 6 seats but I would like to provide you with a larger sense of what Cassava is.\n\nCassava pays attention to the details and adds a tad bit of finesse to everything they do; their Japanese Breakfast is an excellent example. The onsen egg is cooked via sous vide (how many other cafe's can you name with an immersion circulator?) Their rice is cooked perfectly with proper attention paid to its texture. And there is natto. Oh that funky, snot-textured, fermented soy bean. I usually see about 80% of the natto return to the kitchen untouched but Cassava presses on and keeps it as part of the breakfast. Its an uncanny adherence again to the details. \n\nTheir macarons are very good, sourced by Patisserie Philippe. Of special note, they offer green tea (not matcha, using tea leaves in the shell) + Yuzu jelly which is my favorite macaron in the city just by the over all flavor combination. Their cocktails are excellent, again with attention to detail: its not just vermouth in that Spiced Honey Red Sangria - its Dolin Rouge, some of the best damn sweet vermouth around. \n\nAnd at the end of the day, Chris and Yuka are wonderful owners who you can sense have a sincere passion for what they do and who they serve. Yes the service can be slow sometimes, try to visit at a time besides late saturday/sunday morning; if you ever take a look at size of the kitchen, you'll understand- theyre doing the best they can with the size they have.

This is exactly how I discovered Cassava!\n\nI was on my way to dinner one night and saw a private dinner tasting at Cassava.  Intrigued, I pulled out my trusty iPhone and bookmarked the place on Yelp.\n\nA month later I decided to give Cassava a try after browsing through my bookmarks for a brunch spot.\n\nMy friend and I both gave the Japanese breakfast a try, per all your helpful Yelp suggestions. When the tray of assorted breakfast goodies came out, I wasn't sure to make of it: poached egg in broth? Marinated beans? Vegetable assortment? We weren't exactly sure how to eat the dish so we just mixed the different dishes together (including the poached egg) with the rice, and it turned out really delicious!  A great combination of flavors and textures. \n\nI also tried the cinnamon spiced latte. The coffee was slightly sweet, but not overly sweet. It was the perfect weekend treat.\n\nMy only complaint is that there isn't much indoor seating and we played a little musical-tables: we sat outside then moved inside to a small coffee table and finally to a larger dining table. With that said, the staff was supper friendly and accommodating in helping us get a table to eat comfortably at. The atmosphere is bright and cheerful. \n\nSuper friendly staff. Bright atmosphere. \n\nCinnamon coffee is delicious!\n\nI'm looking forward to trying other items on the menu and hopefully the dinner seating in the future.  Folks, Cassava is neighborhood cafe dining at its best!", "author": "Matt S."}

My favorites were the Japanese New Years small dishes with pickled vegetables, sweet soybeans, fish - yum!  And I loved the soup with clams and shrimp (mmm so comforting), spiced sake and the strawberry panna cotta (best I ever had! So creamy and dreamy and I am not even a big dessert person in general!

I usually have lunch at Cassava once a week. Secondly, they have the BEST selection of vegan plates in the Richmond (not a vegan, but I do enjoy vegan plates once in a while)! \n\nMy 2 favorite LUNCH items: \nVeggie panini - a panini filled with various veggies, olive oil, and pesto. The outside is lightly salted with what tastes like salt, kelp, and other spices! The veggies are not always constant (e.g. enoki mushrooms vs white mushrooms) but no matter what, it is always filling and worth your $8. Comes with a rather small side salad (pretty much arugula with tiny slices of carrot).\n\nTuna melt - $7 and like the above, very delicious. The name says it but this is not your typical tuna melt; a pretty generous amount of tuna with a thick layer of cheese on white bread. Also comes with a rather small side salad.\n\nTwo of my friends have spoken highly of the tasting menu (a set menu on Fridays for DINNER). Very intimate and includes a number of illustrative courses. You must make reservations prior to Friday. I believe both were about $40-50 per person and you can call to inquire on the upcoming tasting menu. \n\nCassava, I cannot wait for renovations to be done!

No high chairs (sad face). Service was friendly and prompt. The place is a little cramped so we had to park the stroller outside, and it was unfortunate that we happened to be there during unusually hot weather, because it was uncomfortably stuffy having to carry the baby on my lap while attempting to eat. The food was kinda meehh--mediocre. I got the croque and while I knew it wouldn't come with bechamel, I mistakenly thought the pesto would fill the void. The whites of the egg were still snotty, and a good portion of the sandwich was filled with HALF an avocado, so I ended up having to use a knife and fork. I did enjoy the ham and turkey but I don't think it was worth forking out $13 for a so-called croque.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-05-08", "description": "Update: I spoke with Yuka over the phone and it turns out she is very rude, unprofessional, and childish as other reviewers have claimed. I called very calmly to attempt to discuss my experience and all she wanted to do was verbally attack me and call me a coward. She called my piece slander despite it being completely factual, called me a coward for writing a Yelp review, never let me speak because she kept interrupting me with how she thinks I'm such a bad person, then finished off with saying she didn't have time to talk to me or deal with me, and then hung up. She and her staff didn't even remotely try to help us have a good experience while we were at the restaurant and she didn't make any effort to remedy the situation after I called reaching out. She claims she did, but all she did was attack me.\n\nTLDR: Awful service and multiple bugs in food. $30 per person meal and I'm STILL HUNGRY. \n\nWe went on Mother's Day so it was a set, prix-fixe $30 menu: 2 available appetizers to choose from, 3 entrees to choose from, 1 dessert. It wasn't as busy as you'd think so they can't use that as an excuse for the poor experience. We had a 12pm reservation and the restaurant was only about 70-75% full when we sat down with 1 other party waiting to be seated. \n\nMy friend and I both got the salad, mine had a live fly buzzing around. Waiter took it back and gave me a new one. After I take a few bites of my salad, my friend discovers there's a live worm squirming around in hers. I lose my appetite for this bug infested salad which apparently normally costs $16 (just dried berries and almonds and several pieces of radish. It wasn't anything more than a basic salad). I didn't have the patience or will to dig through my salad for worms as well. The waiter comes by to take my friend's worm infested salad and asks if I've lost my appetite for the salad and I said yes. I didn't have more than a few bites of it so I basically didn't even get to eat an appetizer despite paying for it. He didn't even offer me the bug-free liver mousse appetizer option or anything to make up for the disgusting experience of our first course.\n\nWe were extremely polite about the whole bugs in salad thing and didn't make a huge scene about it (since I don't want them to spit in the rest of my food), but it was clear after the 1st course, the waiter gave up on us and didn't bother to serve us anymore. The table of 2 next to us received their appetizers 1-2 minutes before we got our appetizers, yet they received their entrees and completely finished their entrees before we even received ours. They were enjoying alcohol as well so it's not like they just scarfed it down in a few minutes. It took forever to get our entrees. The waiter never once bothered to check on us and our water jug was empty and I had to flag down a different server to ask him to fill up our water. Dessert similarly took just as long. The table beside us (who started at the same time as us) got and finished their dessert, had more alcohol, paid, and left and finally ~20 minutes after they left we finally we received our dessert. \n\nAt the end, it turns out they took 20% off the tab which explains, but does NOT excuse them giving up and stopping service to us after the 1st course. The least they could've done was tell us they were doing that at the beginning so I didn't have to spend 2 hours being pissed at them and holding in my anger. A tiny discount that barely covers anything doesn't make up for the horrible service throughout the entire almost 2 hour ordeal (again, it wasn't even a crazy busy day). \n\nNow I am sitting at home eating yogurt and granola because after a 3 course $30 meal I'm still hungry since I didn't even get more than a few bites of the bug infested appetizer. \n\nSide Note: I noticed they were very unfriendly and unaccommodating towards handicapped/disabled people. My friend has a broken leg and came in with her crutches and cast and while waiting for our table, no one from the restaurant even offered her a chair to sit on. A very nice customer waiting to be seated saw my friend and pulled out one of the chairs from an empty table outside and told her she should sit, but no one from the restaurant even cared. Secondly, her leg NEEDS to be elevated so we asked to use a chair from the table besides us since they were a party of 3 with 4 chairs. The party next to us had no problem with it and after they were done a party of 4 came so they needed the chair. That was fine, but the hostess removed the chair from my friends leg, walked away, and didn't even offer her another chair to prop her leg on. The restaurant wasn't even full still so there were at least 7 chairs that weren't being used. I had to flag someone down and ask for another chair. We eat out every weekend so we've been to many restaurants together while she's been injured and people are always very accommodating and attentive about her injury, but these people couldn't be bothered at all.", "author": "M K."}

We just stumbled on this place and decided to try it, plus i wasn't paying.\n\nWhat I had:\nI had Kris's Meal Salad ($8): Mixed young lettuce, arugula, boiled egg, avocado, \nfennel, basil walnut pesto, sunflower seeds, apples, citrus vinaigrette. I really enjoyed this salad, and surprisingly felt satiated after my meal.I normally don't like large slices of avocado in general, but it was good.\n\nBoss had the Shrimp & Avocado Sliders ($10): Poached shrimps, avocado, shredded lettuce, tomato-red onion salsa on challa buns. Can't really say much as I didn't try it, but he did eat everything.\n\nWe shared Noel's Panna Cotta ($4.5): Super creamy Italian milk flan with macerated berries for dessert. [Okay, he had two bites and I devoured the rest BUT in my defense HE was the one who ordered it. He claimed he just \"wanted to try it\" I can't waste a delicious dessert so I manned up and took one for the team] It was good, but a bit overpriced for such a small cup.\n\nWhy only 3 stars? Service left some to be desired. They didn't deliver our dessert until waaay after we finished the meal, and it seemed like they flat out forgot. We had to go up to the cashier and remind them we were waiting for it. We overheard the cashier (who was also serving as a barista) tell a cook, and then proceed to finish a drink order AFTER we told her we were waiting for our dessert. Um..it's Panna Cotta. It was sitting in their display unit, and all it required was a little mashed up fruit on top. She could have did it in less than a minute herself. But no, instead she continued to make a drink and then take two orders. Okay...so maybe a chef had to do something special that the cashier couldn't do? NOPE. The cashier brought it out almost 7 minutes later. We were a bit puzzled at what the wait was about, considering it was sitting in the case already made.\n\nIt was good, but nothing special that I'll be returning to anytime soon.", "author": "Jenna H."}

This place is for foodies who want a casual neighborhood place to dine that feels \"special\" every time you go. The cafe has quirk and style, and you always get service with a smile. And oh, the food.  They put love and care into everything they do, and it really shows in the quality of their offerings. Sometimes it can take longer to get your order but that's because this is not an \"assembly line\" type of place -- Kris is a talented chef who serves *cuisine*, not mere food. True art takes time! \n\nI've been there for breafast, lunch, and dinner and have left satiated and happy every time. I adore their Randwich, Kris' Meal Salad, and Meat Balls and Curry. My kids love their grilled cheese and tuna melt sandwiches, which sound ordinary but are somehow elevated here to SF foodie quality. They also have THE BEST macarons.

I always bring my dog and they offer her water and have a heater overhead.\n\nTheir spiced honey latte is absolutely amazing, I can't go there and not order it. The food is very yummy, healthy, and reasonably priced, used with what seems to be organic and local ingredients. I think their lunch offers the best deals: especially their grilled cheese with arugula and tomato.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-28", "description": "My review hasn't really changed. This is still a wonderful place which just keeps better as the owners continue to perfect their craft. \n\nThe reason for this update is that I have a beef with some of the foodie reviewers who don't seem to really know Japanese food. First, 'ichiban dashi'--no idea what is so special about that. One should ALWAYS use ichiban dashi for dishes where the broth takes center stage such as soups. Niban dashi is saved to use in dishes where you need that bit of dashi flavor, but other elements are also important (maybe use niban dashi in the hijiki side dish?). This distinction of ichiban vs niban is a nod to the resourcefulness of Japanese culture, and less of an artisanal element. The real point is that they MAKE THEIR OWN DASHI PEOPLE!!!! No dashi granules or dashi tea bags here.\n\nOnsen eggs?? I think it is a marketing strategy, but they are basically poached eggs which Kris does with care and skill.  What is really special about their Japanese breakfast is how they make it special in their own way. The natto is cut with lemon and chili to make it a bit more palatable to non-Japanese, but it is also a wonderful version of natto itself. The yuzu kosho on the rice is also a lovely touch, neither of which you will find in a typical Japanese breakfast.\n\nWith regards to calling the rice 'sushi rice', I agree that it is not sumeshi, or the vinegared rice to use for sushi. Rather, it is high quality short grain Japanese rice. In local parlance, it seems to be used to distinguish it from other types of rice such as long grain used in many Chinese and Indian dishes. I think the staff are just trying to explain Japanese foods to non-Japanese?\n\nI am glad this place is doing so well. I just wish foodie critics would stop focusing on the bathwater (ichiban dashi?) and discover the baby (meyer lemon natto? now that is news)!!", "author": "\u548c\u5b50"}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-05", "description": "In brief -- scant staff and cozy fit result in long lines that are only worth the wait if you're ready to spend $43 on brunch that is the size of your fist. Don't be legitimately hungry and don't get legitimately hungry over your wait time. Don't park at the meters if you can help it.\n\nScant staff - food orders seem to only be taken by the owner.  Everyone else are food runners or kitchen staff.  Be prepared to wait 15 min. at least to be (i) noticed and (ii) approached again if you weren't 100% decided.  Ex. My bf and I stared at the tiny menu outside as much as we could without crowding the doorway and outside tables. We thought at least 1 dish sounded good but were ambiguous as to the other dishes. Sign says \"Ask Cassava and not Yelp\" so we thought we'd respect that and ask the owner that took food orders once we got seated. \"We're trying to decide between the curry and meatballs versus the Japanese breakfast,\" I say. \"Everything's good here,\" she answers. So enlightening. No conflict of interest at all. Yelpers had preferred curry, but I didn't want curry for breakfast so I went with Japanese. SO MISERABLE THAT I DID. (Food reviews below.)\n\nCozy fit - not a bad thing nec. because the restaurant is arranged adorably and you kind of get the benefit of an open kitchen. Benefit being that you can tell they're working back there. (Somehow working.) However, having that the open kitchen steams up the restaurant a bit, so you'll feel warm in your Outer Richmond clothes.\n\nLong lines - lemme just advise that you ask what the wait is and then assess how much you want to pay on top of food cost and tips just to sit out the wait time plus lunch time plus bill waiting time.\n\n$43 on brunch - managed this bill with only 2 breakfast orders and 2 coffees. NEVER ORDER COFFEE HERE. You will be served drip coffee in an espresso cup without any offer for refills YET CHARGED $4!  It's not great coffee either. I felt the need to polish off all the cream and sugar just to avoid continuously gaping. Food here appears to be health-conscious, which is good, but lacks salt and seasoning, which is too basic to be acceptable. \n\nFood review:\n\n- Braised shortribs were tasty but the meat comprises 10% of your $17 bowl. That is, I got about 5 pieces of shortrib bites in my bowl. Savor those bites. The rest of the bowl is cold salad and quinoa and egg. Warm shortrib and over easy egg are served on top of a cold salad, so you end up with cold items getting heat in this bowl. Food Network judges would NOT approve. Cassava could have served the hot and cold items separately in this case or by employing the compartmentalized tray used in Japanese breakfast. Duh? Overall, this breakfast item scores 3 / 5.\n\n- Japanese breakfast is THE WORST. You'll get rice, cold miso soup, sour/bitter canned fermented soybeans, and pinches of pickle and wakame (seaweed). The rice was the best part. Everything else was bland and cold... BUT WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO ARRIVE?!?? Except for the soybeans, which I described above as not bland but regrettably potent... but still cold...and slimy. WHY. My bf and I were bitterly waiting to move on to a real breakfast and had eaten everything served to us but the soybeans because we just couldn't. The owner commented on how neatly we picked up every grain of rice (durr, that's all we got for food!) and how we apparently didn't take to the soybeans. \"My sister can't handle the natto either,\" she says over-graciously. Uhh, maybe when someone is asking about the menu items prior to ordering, you should mention that 20% of your breakfast tray is notorious for acquired taste! A simple translation \"Natto = fermented soybean\" would have been nice from the menu instead of requiring your customers to Google Translate, ergo waive ordering the 1st time that they win the lottery of being noticed. Overall, this breakfast item scores 0 / 5 because it does not cost $10 to serve 1/3 cup of rice, canned soybeans, pickles, and miso soup mix in children's portions.  \n\n- Free dessert for Yelp check-in?  Sorry, only on Saturdays!  (a.k.a. \"Caturday\")\n\n\nJust 1 star?\nSure, we ordered something that we regretted. HOWEVER, we got no advice or translation or notice. Sure, we decided to spring for modern Japanese and fusion food after seeing the prices. HOWEVER, no food was available on other tables to even realize what portions we could expect for the $$. (Blame that on the long wait and demands on the kitchen? Not that they had big portions to cook or much attention to detail tho since everything was served cold and incongruous.) Normally, you'll feel comfortably fed on $15 even at a modern chic restaurant for breakfast. NOT here. Cassava upholds the Japanese small portions but the service and products here just don't deliver.", "author": "S J."}

I had the \"Mr & Mrs Croque\" Sandwich which was pretty large and filling, but it was light enough that I didn't feel overly stuffed. It was very tasty, but I still wish I had gotten the Waffle, which is what my boyfriend ordered. Personally, I HATE when waffles are too soft and squishy; I feel like I'm eating a sugar soaked sponge. But this waffle was nothing like that. \"Crisp\" or \"crunch\" may not be quite the right words to describe it, but those are the words I'm going to use. It was a crisp waffle that had a nice crunch to it. It wasn't overly sweet either, which waffles tend to be and what usually contributes to my feeling like a pregnant elephant after brunch. And the bacon was great, which is always a huge plus for me.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really cute, with indoor and outdoor seating.

Sure, there are probably places up and down Clement and Balboa. However, those places aren't serving Ritual's smooth coffee and they sure as heck aren't serving you a flaky, buttery pastry wrapped around silky curry filling with even 1/4 of the warm welcome you receive from the very cute and endearing Yuka. \n\nThe BF and I jaywalked over here upon the recommendation of my optometrist located directly across the street. Since Dr. Cheng has never steered me wrong and my -10 blind eyes see damn close to 20/20 because of her, I listened to her again and obediently went across the street for a very late lunch. I need to buy Dr. Cheng a present for this kind referral because I now have a place to brunch on the weekends and in my very own neighborhood, thankyouverymuch!\n\nBF and I decided to share the Meatballs in Curry and the Shrimp and Avocado Sliders. The tender, juicy meatballs are made of tofu and beef, come with super sticky Japanese rice made just the way I love it and a lightly dressed salad. Sandwiched between a toasted challah bun and consisting of way more fresh, crisp shrimps than I expected, the sliders are an A+ in my culinary adventure book. I've had many a mediocre shrimp and avocado sandwich in my day, but these were exceptional due mostly to the skill of the chef and the fact that he took the time to sprinkle salt on the avocado - such attention to detail! Salt + avocado = super happy Veronica. P.s. I ABHOR onions, but  I happily ate delicious mouthful after mouthful of the tomato and red onion salsa in that slider.  Remember how I said we'd decided to share? Sharing happened like this - BF ate 3/4 of one slider. In return, I was allowed one tablespoon of rice, one tablespoon of sauce and 1/2 of one meatball. Someone needs to learn how to share his food, wahhhhhh. \n\nTheir monthly pop-up dinner menus sound amazing; bone marrow and/or beef cheeks anyone? There's already a waiting list for the month of July, but as soon as August opens up, you can bet your tush my fine food-worshipping girlfriends and I will be there complete with salivating mouths, waiting tummies and open wallets. $45 for a tasting menu by a Le Cordon Bleu trained chef who has worked at not just one, but two Michelin starred restos, hello? Run, don't walk!\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how high quality their food is and how reasonable the prices are, so I'm combining clich\u00e9d phrases and I'm gushing so much it's embarrassing, but this is THE neighborhood gem find of the year.  \n\nWe've only just had our first date, Cassava, and perhaps I'm jumping the gun a bit, but I think this is the beginning of a long and grand relationship.", "author": "Veronica C."}

I just loved the simple and fresh decor. The service was excellent and the food was yummy. I had the meatball curry while my friend had a ham and cheese sandwich. The food was great but i feel the prices did not match up with the quantity/quality of the food. My small meal was about 10 dollars ( basically a cup of rice and about a few meatballs and curry.) While my friends sandwich came out to be about 9 dollars with a very small side salad. I know 20 dollars for a meal for two isn't much but there are plenty of cafes in SF that can keep your tummy full and is equal in quality for less. \n\nSumming things up: \n\nPrices: 7-10 dollars\nfood: pretty good\nservice: great\natmosphere: great\ncoming back? yes!\n\nO the macaroons made my eyes widen when i shoved it in my mouth ( shits good)", "author": "Reiko n."}

The perfect alternative...private party at Cassava Bakery + Cafe!! Arranging this was super easy with Yuka who seem more like a close friend than an owner of a restaurant. \n\nFirst off, the space at Cassava provided an intimate and homely feeling that provided the prefect setting where people could chat amongst each other in normal tones. We had 12 ppl at dinner and we all fitted comfortably in the restaurant. It was neither stuffy or pretentious. Just casual, warm and welcoming...check out the various paintings on the walls. They are pretty inspirational.\n\nSecond, the food that Kris prepared for us was awesome and mouth-watering delicious. At certain times during the family style dinner, not a word was spoken and all that was heard were the utensils making contact with the dinnerware. Words alone would not do Kris's food justice. Food perfectly seasoned and expertly prepared by a chef that know how to use fresh and seasonal ingredients.

One thing that will forever stay with me was that one of the guest didn't eat beef, which escaped me, but Yuka and Kris were about to come up with a separate main dish for that guest...i will be forever grateful to them.\n\nTying all three together provided my girlfriend and our friends a night to remember at Cassava Bakery+Cafe...", "author": "Alex P."}

I came by to pick up a couple of treats before my drive back to Sacramento.  It's in what seems to be a pretty quiet area, but inside, there were a few customers.  It kind of has a shabby chic type feel to it and I was quickly greeted by the staff.\n\nI tried:\n-Peanut butter cookie: a bite sized cookie.  It's not too sweet and a has an interesting texture to it (not like other cookies).  It is somewhat flakey, yet somewhat melts in your mouth.  I thought it was okay.  I can see why others may like it, but it wasn't for me.\n\n-Curry puff: I didn't eat this in the store, and the lady told me that I needed to heat it up before eating it.  I toasted it in the toaster oven when I got home and it had a nice flaky-ness to it.  The pastry is not very thick, it's pretty light.  The curry filling is also not as heavy as I was expecting.  I think I was looking for a denser curry, but it's just lightly curry flavored, which works fine, too.\n\n-Morning buns ($2 each): this was probably my favorite of the things I ordered.  The morning buns were simple, yet tasty.  They have a nice buttery, richness to them and the chewiness of the bread is just right.  The coating of sugar on top is nice too.\n\nOverall, this place is a bit out of the way for me to make a trip back just for the morning bun.  But I would maybe stop by if I were in the area.  The staff was friendly and the shop was cute.  \n\nNotes:\n-Metered parking in front; free street parking on side streets.\n-They brew ritual coffee.", "author": "Samantha L."}

Anyways, here is my review:\n\ncoffee ($2.50): the coffee that I ordered was a large, though definitely a small by peet's/starbucks standards. The coffee's flavor was more hot water than coffee, but still decent. 3 stars.\n\nQuiche ($4.00): the quiche was interesting. It's not very often that I find myself ordering a quiche, but i had to try it upon reading yelp reviews. It was.. not bad. The quiche is a combination of cottage cheese, creme spinach, and mushrooms on a buttered cookie crust. They will also warm it up for you in the oven, and lightly flame it with a torch after it's warmed up. Though $4 is reasonable for a unique taste, I feel that it's an item that's good only once in a while. overall, it was decent. 3 1/2 stars\n\nSecret Tip: now, although both the coffee and quiche are only slightly above average, if you take a bite of the quiche, and follow it with a small sip of coffee, the entire world will change within that very moment. THE FLAVORS truly come out when the two are combined, and then you can easily taste why this is a 4 star cafe.\n\n-wifive-", "author": "simon k."}

It is original - I am always going to give points for thinking outside of the standard breakfast box (or bowl in this case).   \n2. It has all of the great chorizo flavor without any of the \"what the hell just happened, I suddenly need to take a nap\"  aftermath that most chorizo breakfast plates will award you. \n3. It is sufficiently fulling, but not overly so (see point 2).\n\nHowever, there are a couple downsides. Granted I have only been on weekends, it is often hard to find seating inside. You may find yourself awkwardly standing in the middle of a crowded room, scanning for near finished customers, while dodging busy servers. This place has a nice ambiance, but I think it is a little pricey for a seat yourself cafe.

Also, the place is freakin' adorable.

We are new to the area and Cassava was the perfect spot for us on a cold and rainy evening. We were greeted cordially by Yuka (I hope I spelled that correctly) and were led to a nice comfy spot by the window. I was a little under the weather so I decided to get some hot tea. The tea was absolutely sublime (honey rose mint tea) and I even got a second cup! We ordered the quinoa salad as a starter and was perfect! Just the right amount of everything in every bite! Including tomatoes, citrus fruit, quinoa, and greens. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better, we got our entr\u00e9es. Albacore tuna seared to perfection a top a bed of white beans, citrus, tomatoes, and a few greens for garnish. The dish was absolutely exquisite! The tuna just melted away in our mouths. Every bite was a creation of delectable flavor! The only regret was not getting the three course meal!! So when you want a cozy gourmet experience, head on over to Cassava and get ready to be amazed! :D", "author": "Maynor S."}

After grabbing a table and one of their cookbooks off the shelf to peruse, I got myself the poached chicken panini, since they were out of the curry puffs. \n\nThis turned out to be a FANTASTIC DECISION. They use Semifreddi's foccacia bread for this sandwich, which took it up a few notches to begin with. The chicken was really tender and tasty, complemented by the bit of fried egg white and carmelized fennel, which gave it a subtle herb-y flavor. It tasted like a bit of curry was spread on one of the slices, which gave it a really nice kick. Totally delicious. \n\nThey make really smooth lattes, too. I'm not much of a Ritual person as it's a little too strong for me, but the way they blended it together mellowed out the taste just right. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and sweet. I definitely recommend it as a place to get a quick bite or a quiet spot to get work done.", "author": "Rachel F."}

First, you have to line up for 300 years and order your food at the counter. The people then take another 200 years to get your food. In fact, I have been regularly and I still have never had prompt service. Ordering a quiche is an ordeal. They take FOREVER. And you want a tip for this????!!! A latte here is $4 for the Outer Richmond.\n\nThe lady, Yuka, who owns this place is a dragon woman. She's rude, abrupt and into herself. When you try to engage her, it's ice ice, baby. You cannot ask her for anything. God forbid when this place screws up your order, customers are afraid to let her know because she's the rudest person alive.  Perhaps a career at the DMV is more suitable place for someone with her oh so sunny dispoisiton.. Learn some manners, lady. Eating your food is like swallowing broken glass after interacting with you.\n\nThe food like other reviews is cold. It goes back to my original point-they take forever. By the time that they get your food, it's cold as hell. (this is generally done after waiting 15 minutes to get them warm up a pastry) My coffee was iced by the Richmond District wind from the Pacific.\n\nThey charge a lot of money for OK food. It's slim pickings in the Outer Richmond. However,  I might even take my chances with the cockroaches at the Americana Grill than deal with her attitude. It's so San Francisco hipster-I am just too cool to provide you decent customer service.\n\nBy the way, this places doesn't use the best quality, organic products. Their stuff is Trader Joe's. Look at the boxes behind the display. I did. It made me wonder how they charge as much as they do...", "author": "Peggy B."}

First off, the decor is very cozy yet modern, minimalistic and simply darling. The space is a bit small so you'll find yourself wiggling about if you take seats inside the cafe; that's probably why more people find themselves at their outdoor seating on the sidewalk, even if it's in the chilly, breezy Richmond fog. Tip* - if you prefer the warmth, come early. \n\nEveryone there were so friendly. The lady at the counter (I assume is the owner) found out we were first-timers and briskly walked us through the menu - coffees and tea, japanese breakfast, brunch food, pastries. \n\nWe ended up getting honey lattes, a danish, a curry puff, herbal iced tea and chatted until they started serving brunch. Then we ordered the Meatballs in Curry and Rice, Shrimp & Avocado Sliders, and Japanese Breakfast to try. \n\nThe Meatballs in Curry and Rice is awesome! Delicious and flavorful meatballs in tantalizing curry sauce, pipping hot with rice. The Shrimp and Avocado Sliders were equally tasty. I'm a sucker for avocados, and the flavor blended amazingly with the succulent large shrimps tomato, lettuce, red onion salsa, harrisa sauce on challa buns. YUM.\n\nNow, the Japanese Breakfast was \"interesting\" - Koshihikari rice, ichiban dashi miso soup, sous vide \"onsen tamago\" poached egg, Meyer lemon kosho natto, wakame salad, simmered mushroom and tofu. I was very intrigued with the dishes initially, and when the tray arrived, the presentation was impressive. However, maybe I'm just not used to the textures and flavors of Japanese breakfasts, but I found the cold rice, slimy natto combo a bit hard to swallow. The miso soup was good, and the onsen tamago poached egg was smooth, light, and 'harmonious' to the palate. It was definitely worth trying once. I just didn't find it to be my liking, as I did the meatball and slider dishes.\n\nThe overall experience was pretty awesome though, so I'll definitely go back! I want my own Meatball dish next time. All mine!", "author": "Jing D."}

The Japanese breakfast consisted of \"Koshihikari plum rice, ichiban dashi miso soup, sous vide \"onsen tamago\" poached egg, Meyer lemon kosho natto, wakame salad, and simmered hijik.\"  It definitely wasn't your typical breakfast, but was delicious nonetheless.  The poached egg was delicious, and they also added this tiny flower freshly picked from the garden right outside of their cafe!\n\nKris and Yuka are extremely cute and welcoming.

Stopped by late Saturday morning for brunch and found the place to be surprisingly busy.  There are only 3 tables inside which seats only 7 people total and a table outside.  BF had the chicken pressed panini ($7) and I had the poached egg with toast and quince jam ($5).  Both dishes came with a small side of lettuce with thinly sliced cucumbers and radishes; lightly dressed.  They gave out 2 complimentary peanut butter shortbread cookies with corn flake bits for yelp checking in. They were intereresting; BF liked them more than I did.\n\nThe food was tasty and reasonably priced. I enjoyed the foccacia of the panini and my pieces of toast the best.  The poached egg was slightly undercooked.  Water comes in tiny pastic dixie cups, so if you're a thirsty drinker like me, you might have to make multiple trips to the water carafe.\n\nService was friendly, if a bit green. Another couple who came in and ordered after us seemingly got their food prior to us, so the wait for our food was kind of long.  Workers were running the cash register, taking orders, waiting tables, and busing the plates; so everyone looked a little frazzled.

The pairing of caramelized onions, gruyere, and bitter greens are a good standard, and you can expect tons of slightly sweet flavors with a hint of bitterness to really tingle the taste buds. The sweet roll/brioche bun brings it together and is seriously perfect, as it absorbed all the juiciness of the meat, keeping all the flavors together instead of spilling onto the plate. The side salad that comes with the two sliders was very refreshing, especially for a post work out meal. \n\nMeat balls with curry sauce. Apparently there is tofu mixed in with the meat in the meatballs, which is damn smart. Tofu absorbs a lot of flavor, and aside from absorbing the flavors of the beef, the flavor of the curry was further infused into the meatball because of the tofu. The curry sauce was very different... almost sweet like a marinara, but still had the subtle spices of a mild curry. \n\nMocha - oh man, I really like their mochas here. If I had to rank my favorite mochas, this is a triple tie between Philz (SF) and Pannakin (San Deigo). This drink was brewed so perfectly, and had just the right amount of chocolate. You could appreciate the roasty taste of the espresso, as well as the smoothness of the chocolate without having it muted by sugar. \n\nThe friendliest staff you'll meet. Yuka  and Kris are awesome!

I love their breakfast sandwich, scrambled eggs, and turkey sandwich. We've also been to one of their pop up dinners, and it was a lovely experience with amazing food with a variety of influences. The only thing I don't love is their coffee - they serve Ritual, which I typically like, but for some reason it always tastes bitter here. Overall, I recommend highly!", "author": "sarah s."}

(i know, i know, you probably cringed at the latter)  I'm guessing their menu varies daily.\nSurprisingly, they've managed to incorporate these featured items into each dish perfectly. My favorites so far have been the squash soup, squash quiche, and the veggie panini with grilled portobello mushroom. All the dishes were so flavorful! Portions are perfect for individuals to enjoy.\nThe quiche is a MUST TRY, it's served with a small silver spoon and it's toasted to perfection, not too thick but still decadent and creamy. I also noticed that a lot of people dropped in to pick up coffee and pastries to go, so I'm guessing their special drinks must be more than decent. \nThe staff is super friendly and the service is quick. There's about 8 seats in the shop for customers to sit and dine, so I highly suggest to dress warm if you're going to decide to dine outdoors, especially when it's a typical cold and foggy SF kind of day.", "author": "Ada C."}

I took off two stars here only because there is one staff here does not have good attitude to customers. No smile and no welcome feelings when we sitted  even no thank you when we walk out from the restaurant. I am not sure if she is the owner here or manager here. I will come back for the food and hoping to see better service next time.

I will say - there was a bit of \"art\" on the wall that annoyed me.  It was a reworking of an Oscar Wild quote on consistency or routine, done in the style of Jenny Holzer.

An intimate breakfast/lunch spot with a daily changing menu of sandwiches, salads, soups, home made pastries and such. Cassava features high standards, high quality ingredients, a creative menu, a super accommodating staff, and a tastefully adorned interior. I'm so tired of walking down this stretch of Balboa and finding the usual run-down, dumpy looking restaurants offering the same boring food. Now there's an alternative. Cassava is bringing classy back.\n\nBut on to the important part: the eats. So far everything I've tried has been excellent. The Poached Chicken Panini was tremendous, especially loved the combination of carmelized fennel and harrisa sauce. The Turkey Grilled Cheese was fantastic, mouthwatering. The Curry Puffs are a delicious little snack. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu. \n\nCustomer service is important to me, and they do a great job of it. The staff, as I mentioned, is really friendly and happy to serve you. The interior, though small, is really charming and tasteful.

C'mon - seriously? I can list a handful of other restaurants that will serve the same exact sandwich with a little bit of a heartier side. Service was ok, although it took about 25 minutes for my sandwich and glass of Sangria (no fruit in it - wtf?) to come out. I can tell the vibe that they're trying to set, but it just doesn't work in this space, in this neighborhood. Since I live somewhat nearby I might bring my mom or something, but this is not the place to brunch with friends, or really take any kind of group larger than maybe 2 or 3 people.

I wanted to make a review when I got home, but I was so angry that I needed to give it a little time and space to reflect on what happened before posting. \n\nIn a nutshell, my husband and I were chastised by server because she thought my husband and I took too many napkins (honest mistake, hubby grabbed some on his way back from the restroom not knowing that I already had grabbed some...honestly, we are not wasteful people). In lieu of greeting us, the server stood at our table and stared really hard at the stack of napkins, and then at us,  then offered to take some napkins back (was she going to reuse them?). Hubby and I just stared at her incredulously. Huh? She was obviously seething. At the conclusion of my meal (food was decent), to make a point to the manager about the napkin debacle, I made my way to the cashier to return the unused napkins. I was intercepted by the seething server as I approached the cashier, only to find out the she is the OWNER of the restaurant. I told her I didn't appreciate how rude and accusatory she was over such a small thing, and I suggested that if cost was an issue, that she may want to keep napkins behind the counter. Her reaction was UNBELIEVABLE. She heard nothing that I said, and continued to yell at me. She is an  outwardly extremely hostile individual who should not be working with the public.

I tasted no curry, and it felt like the same kind of tomato sauce you'd find in pasta.\n\nFriend ordered the Pork Belly which I thought was ok, but a bit plain.\n\nI would definitely stop by again to try the breakfast/brunch.", "author": "Mary L."}

So luckily, since I was off, I got to choose this place for my birthday breakfast. :D\n\nUpon first entering I immediately fell in love with the place. The decor from the wood floors to the chalk wall were so charming that I could tell the owners took care into making sure every detail of their restaurant was exactly how they wanted it. The woman who I'm sure is the owner took the bf and my order was very friendly. We had no trouble ordering since the menu was simple although everything looked tasty. Knowing that they were brewing Ritual coffee, I quickly ordered a latte with the scrambled eggs + toast + jam + bacon breakfast. \n\nSeating was nice in that it was friendly for both couples and groups and there was even option of outdoor seating. There was hardly a wait for both receiving the drinks and the food. All the staff who had helped us were extremely friendly. The latte I had was perfect, I feel like anyone who doesn't order whole milk for their latte is missing out. The Bf and I had ended up ordering the same meal which was great, because I really didn't feel like sharing. The bacon was UHmazing, think of the perfect holiday ham that's sliced on Christmas type of good. The toast was perfectly seasoned with pepper and butter. The salad nicely dressed and ended up paring really well with everything. The homemade strawberry jam was definitely not to be missed. But the eggs, OH mylanta the eggs, I am a bit of a scrambled eggs connoisseur so once I noticed that they were not only perfectly cooked so that each bite was moist and fluffy, but was ALSO seasoned with fresh black peppercorn... we'll just say my mouth was in breakfast heaven. \n\nI will definitely return!", "author": "Darline D."}

They take online reservations through yelp  for dinners and brunch which is always a plus. The menu wasn't super impressive but when we ordered and ate the food; mind blown. We ordered the lamb chops and one of their daily specials which was the scallop risotto.  Everything was made to perfection. It was very homey and simple. The restaurant is small so it definitely added to the ambience. We also ordered drinks and dessert. I highly recommend the bread pudding!  After getting appetizers, drinks, and entrees it was all very affordable. Yuka even gave us some macaroons to take home. We definitely love Yuka and everything about Casava.

Not the case with Cassava Bakery + Cafe!! \n\nThe atmosphere is simply lovely! Clean, modern and really inviting, I wish there was more seating so I could just camp out here all day! I've been about 4 times, but each time I go I find something else to love. I've tried their sandwiches (lovely and LARGE PORTIONS), and their quiche, which was one of the best quiches I've ever had (this counts when I went to France! Ok, disclaimer, I might not have went to the best places for quiche, but you get my drift) and it came with a excellent light salad. YUM.  The newest addition is the pop-up dinner. The price tag might seem high ($~50 with ice tea and hot tea) but with 7 courses perfectly sized and each crafted with a great amount of care, it was totally worth it! Next thing on my list is the Japanese breakfast (only served on the weekends). \n\nAs many other reviews have pointed out the service is first rate. Whenever I go, I always feel welcomed and that my business is appreciated. Some reviews have pointed out that the prices are a tad higher than some places, but I'm willing to pay a little more for great food and great service, it deserves to be rewarded in my book! \n\nRun, don't walk, to Cassava to see for yourself!

Kris and Yuka go out of their way to make sure that every guest has nice experience at their restaurant. It is a labor of love for them and they have worked tirelessly to make Cassava the amazing gem that it is today.\n\nI've tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. My favorites include the Japanese breakfast, Kris' Meal Salad, the Randwich, and Grilled Cheese with turkey or ham (my kids' favorite). My husband loves the Truffle Chorizo Hash Bowl and the Meatballs. The soups and quiches are amazing and the Patisserie Phillipe Macarons (try the seasonal pumpkin ones too) are incredible. We've also eaten at Cassava's tasting dinners many many times and are always blown away by Kris' skills as a chef. In short, this place rocks. \n\nFor those of us living in the neighborhood, it's become a community mecca. We've lived in the Outer Richmond for almost nine years and until Cassava opened, never really spent a lot of time on our main drag -- Balboa St. Now we're always there -- seeing our neighbors and meeting new friends. \n\nWe are pretty down to earth people who love good food and Cassava has become one of our favorite places to eat in the city.

Went on Yelp and found this restaurant listed as \"American\", I was starving and wanted breakfast.  It was Sunday lunch/brunch, call it was you will.  I really don't think it is \"American\" at all, which is fine, but don't be mislead,  it has a lot of Japanese influences, so perhaps Asian Fusion would be more accurate.  I asked to sit outside, because I had my dog with me, and they said the empty table was reserved.  Fine, understandable and reasonable, so I sat inside.  Ordered the ribs and a glass of rose.  Honestly, the menu was a little odd, and not very \"American\" at all, so I wasn't sure what to order.  In hind sight, I think I should have ordered the Japanese breakfast. I was there for maybe 45 minutes to an hour, and they never sat said table outside.  When I left, they finally sat one guy (it was a three top, which I could understand why they would want to sit three people there instead of one and he didn't even have a dog!  Poor service.  \nRegarding the ribs, they were very well cooked and falling off the bone, but I couldn't eat them.  It's probably a matter of personal preference, but there was an overwhelming spice that took over all flavors and I just didn't like them.  Cinnamon perhaps?\nPlace is cute and well appointed.

They definitely needed more space and it looked pretty good! The food here is fresh and innovative and they use quality ingredients. My boyfriend got the chorizo hash bowl which came with a side of rice. It was good, but the portion was small. His mom got the croque monsieur breakfast sandwich. That was great, the cheese was a standout. I got the Japanese breakfast. For the most part, it is delicious but the miso is very bland and I ordered the tuna as an extra, but one piece of the two small pieces they served was pure bone and therefore inedible. \n\nThe one thing that really disappointed me was when we were paying. We originally ordered a breakfast croissant (7$), and then the server (who spoke so softly we could barely carry on a conversation with her) asked if we wanted to try the croque monsieur instead (12$). Well, no, we didn't, but then she said sorry but they are out of the crossiant. So we said sure replace it with the other sandwich, and without even saying anything about how it will cost almost twice as much- rang it up! If you are wondering what the difference is between these two sandwiches- it is that the croque monsieur has turkey on it.  If that isn't a bait and switch.....I don't know what is. Lastly, I don't drink coffee but my dining mates did and they don't do refills. Honestly, we spent 50$ on breakfast for three people, and not offering coffee refills is pretty stingy. So, I will probably be back for dinner since the food is good, but these few negatives result in Cassava most likely not being my regular go-to breakfast/lunch/whenever spot.\n\nIn the end- portions are tiny and it is expensive, even by San Francisco standards.

First off, the tables are far too cramped together and this may fly in the Mission, but out here in the Richmond, this does not constitute as cozy -- it's just downright ridiculous.  Why don't you also hire a cashier girl who remembers that she had told your patron that the drip coffee will be ready in 10 minutes, only to go up to the the same person again (to the baby faced Asian girl who wears her hair in Pippi Longstocking braids -- your customer service sucks!!)  and either she has early on-set Alzheimers or she just does not give a shit (I'm pretty sure its the latter), to be told - \"oh, you wanted what again?\" (snarky attitude included free of charge).  I know your busy because its a Sunday brunch but seriously, get your orders right.  \n\nTrust me, the ONLY reason why this place stays open because they currently have no competition.

I made the reservation through Yelp and everything was very smooth from beginning to end. The moment we walked in, we were greeted by the hostess and they seat us right away. After we sat down, 2 glasses of French sparkling wine was brought to us without me asking. They knew that we were celebrating a special occasion. The service was amazing. Yuka was very kind and attentive while Kris, her husband, was busy working his magic in the kitchen. We started out with the lettuce & Dungeness crab salad and the smoked trout which I understand they smoked themselves. For the main course, I had the roasted Pintade while my wife had the lamb loin. For dessert, Yuka recommended her favorite the Vanilla Panna Cotta and it was absolutely amazing!  Everything we had was excellent, but what I love most about this place is the quaintness and the owner's attention to details from the food to the service to the decor.  This may be a small place but they have a big heart. Thanks to Yuka & Kris and their staff for making this a great experience for us.  Dinner was a success!

The second time I came for brunch, I already had something small to eat earlier and didn't want a full meal.  I know on their menu they don't offer pastries or side dishes for brunch.  They do offer desserts but I wasn't feeling like getting something sweet for brunch.  I asked who I believe was the owner if they had anything small like pastries.  She mentioned they don't have any side dishes or small pastries but can make one waffle with some fruit on it for me.  I said great!  I thought I was pretty clear on wanting waffle with fruit on the top but the owner kept pushing me to get the full waffle meal with scrambled eggs.  I told her I wanted the single waffle as I already had something small to eat earlier and I wasn't extremely hungry.  I don't know what happened, but somewhere in our communication she didn't get that I didn't want a full complete meal!  After I insisted on getting the single waffle, I noticed her demeanor and body language changed.  She made this subtle unpleasant facial expression to indicate she thought it was weird I just wanted something small to eat and walked away. I literally had something to eat earlier and I had room in my tummy for a waffle but not a full meal!  It just left me feeling uneasy when all she had to do was say no problem!  If you want a single waffle with a few pieces of fruit on the top for $7, no problem!  We ill get it for you.  I'm not sure why that was so hard to do.  I think I'm going to stay away from Cassava for a little while.", "author": "Chloe A."}

There were about 4-5 tables in a small space but everyone had enough privacy to have a good conversation, but we were glad we could eavesdrop on some of the regulars special requests (like the bourbon mocha - so yummy) so that we could copy cat. We had an excellent meal. Everything on the menu was thoughtful and prepared with such care. My husband and I savored every bite. The chef showed his culinary skills in every dish. Everything was cooked perfectly and presented so beautifully. My favorite dish was the short ribs! The dish as so flavorful and it was paired with savory bread pudding. To die for!
