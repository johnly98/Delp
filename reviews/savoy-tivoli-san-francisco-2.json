You can also tell it's a kitty bar because all the young un's in this bar are having quite coherent conversations despite the unnecessarily loud level of noise from the music the play.  Way too loud.  Why does the volume have to be on 10?    Still, there is one part of the bar where you can breathe the rushing outside, foggy San Franciscan air off of Grant Avenue.\n\nThe bartendress was fairly friendly by San Franciscan standards.   The beers weren't too over priced and they had a decent selection.  I had a couple of Coronas and she even remembered to include a lime.\n\nNot bad.  The crowd here are ironically very innocent looking.  At my age, I felt as if I walked into a G-rated movie with a bunch of little children, wearing make up pretending to act like adults.\n\nI swear to you, the people here are too young.  I think the City of San Francisco should change the drinking age to 40 and over.", "author": "Tony U."}

The place had a great vibe with a mix of regulars and non-regulars, the drinks were cheap and they stayed open late.  I lived closer to Union Square but had no problems making my way (even walking) to North Beach for this S.F. drinking mainstay.  It was one of those places that was popular but not trendy.  I remember my friends and I lamenting about the changing demographic in SF during the Dot-Com boom of the nineties.  We were glad to see that The Savoy and not been completely invaded by the techy horde.  There were some, but thankfully most stayed away (no disrespect intended to those in tech).  \n\nIt's funny how history repeats itself.  With the current tech-boom changing the SF landscape once again, I was surprised to see how quiet the bar was on a Saturday night.  A friend and I arrived right when they opened and stayed there for a few hours.  I told that the place would probably get going after 10:00 pm.  By the time we left after 11:00 it was only half full.  It could have filled up later, but it didn't seem like it would.  One of those party busses that looked like a cable car stopped right in front.  About thirty drunk and loud, but happy folks stepped out and entered the bar.  \n\nI read some reviews that The Savoy had closed down for a while and then reopened.  I'm not sure if this was why they weren't busy on warm Saturday night, but it did feel different.  I loved that place and wanted to take my friend there.  Alas it was not like it was, even though it looked the same.  But it was quiet enough so that we could talk and have a few drinks.  I'd go back if I was in the area.  \n\nOne small thing, as another reviewer mentioned, they do need to clean their beer taps.  My pint of Stella was sour/stale and I switched to mixed drinks.  Not sure of the joint is under new ownership/management but that should never happen.  My advice to them is get that handled.

Enough space to avoid sharing oxygen with the riff raff and yuppies, but compact enough to where you still feel like you're with the *it* crowd. There's 2 separate bars, tables to bring your own food and eat at, pool tables and enough eclectic decor to play a different game of eye spy every time you come visit. You can get no-frills cocktails and take them over to San Francisco's hidden gem of a dance floor, complete with disco lights and lasers. -1 Star because they recently revoked their policy of play your own music on the bar speakers, and Javier, the neighborhood friendly bartender, no longer works there.

After expressing my displeasure with a specific bartender not honoring a happy hour deal, the owner was quick to resolve the situation and was quick to re-educate his staff on the importance of quality customer service.\n\nWhile at the bar on a Saturday night (around 10:30pm), me and a group of friends were sitting at a table and I offered to go buy some drinks. A friend had asked for a glass of white wine so I went up and purchased two glasses of wine. The total was $16 and I tipped $3, all cash. When I came back to the table, we were just chatting and my friend asked if I got the deal on the wine. What deal? My friend pointed out the main reason she got a glass of wine was because it was supposed to be $5. Looking around, there was a promotion being promoted on pretty much every table in the bar. \"All glass of wine - $5, 8pm-12am.\"\n\nSeeing as the bar wasn't too busy, I went up and told the bartender who served me that I hadn't received the deal. He said the promotion was not going tonight and that it shouldn't be on the table. I asked for a refund of the difference and was denied. I then asked if a discount or small pour of another drink could be given instead to make up for the difference. The bartender said he could not provide anything cause \"the boss is watching on the security cameras.\" The bartender at the Patio bar who said his name was Javier would not admit a mistake on behalf of the bar and would not apologize for the false advertising. I asked to speak with a manager and was refused by Javier because the boss was \"on the roof\" and would not come down.\n\nI asked if he would at least take the other deal placards off the tables so as to not mislead other customers and he said he was too busy (there was nobody waiting to be helped during our conversation, but there were people sitting/standing at the bar with drinks). I asked if this is really how little they care about customer service, and at that point, he may have apologized saying there was nothing he could do.\n\nBy going around Javier, I was finally able to get in touch with the manager/owner. He was very receptive and offered my refund and a much more personal and friendly experience on my next return.\n\nAside from this one bartender, Savoy Tivoli is a very special place for San Francisco. For those of you looking for a unique atmosphere, this is the place. The open patio in the front is a pretty cool space. It's like an indoor patio with large, open windows that is amazing on a nice night like when I was there. It reminds me of sitting at a cafe patio in Italy or Spain and is great for a relaxing drink after work or before going out to dinner in North Beach.\n\nI will be back.", "author": "Danny P."}

The first run was here, before they got the Club Fugazi space a couple of blocks away.  \n\nAnd despite being predisposed to being overrun w tourists, euro trash, & people that could not hold their alcohol, The Savoy was still an institution.  It was still a place I was sure to bring my girlfriends when they came to visit from out of town.  That was the thing w this place; we avoided it, but we still respected it.\n\nThere was a big problem w noise a few years back.  Apparently, several neighborhood residents complained & complained.  I never understood this.  If you want peace & quiet, then you shouldn't move near a bar.  Common sense, right?  They were temporarily shut down.  So, consequently, today they're only allowed to have live music for a very limited amount of hours a month.  Sad.\n\nIt's all about that front patio.  Totally romantic, sexy, & european.  It's still to this day a chronic movie scene to be sitting on this patio, wearing a slinky dress, sipping a cocktail.  Preferably while smoking a cigarette.  Think \"A Streetcar Named Desire.\"\n\nThe mystique is still here.  It has that cafe swank & dive bar thing down.  The patio for the former, the second barroom for the latter.  \n\nIt would be great if the Savoy could pick itself up & be a player in the hood again.

I was thinking of asking the bartender to fill one with water and pour it into a pint glass, when my friend found the \"14 ounces\" printed on the bottom. We pointed it out to the bartender and he said, \"They must have changed it.\" I don't think the International Bureau of Weights and Measures has changed the measurement for a pint.\n\nOh, and the bartender tried to grab $3 from under my forearm when I wasn't looking, but I'm going to chalk that up to inexperience.

I've only been here on a Saturday afternoon between 4-8pm but that experience easily earned the 5 stars! \n\nWe had wandered over to North Beach and were looking for a place to grab a drink or dinner.  As we walked down the street we heard this incredibly jazz trumpet playing somewhere up the block.  As someone who grew up around jazz musicians, it sounded too good to be live so I just assumed it was a bar that had their doors and windows open.  As we approached Savoy Tivoli it was this AMAZING and LIVE jazz band playing right inside the restaurant with all the windows open and a lively (and very diverse) crowd of people enjoying the music.\n\nThis band consisted of between 5-7 older men (like 70+) who seemed to have played together for years.  These guys were UNREAL. Not only were they totally entertaining the crowd with their funny stories from playing in Boston jazz clubs in the  50s and 60s but these guys possessed a raw talent that I have not seen in a long, long time. I was sitting there in awe thinking how lucky I felt to have stumbled into this bizarrely wonderful scene in the middle of North Beach on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  \n\nSo moral of that story - GO ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON and pray to god that you see this wonderful group of men perform.  \n\nAs for the venue - weird place.  Looking at other reviews it sounds like it's a pretty happening bar later in the night?  I did see the sign advertising $2 shots... \n\nIt's a pretty large space - includes pool tables, two LARGE bars and plenty of tables.  The bartender (bald guy....forget his name) was fantastic.  We gave him barely anything to work with (except for a \"something less sweet than a Manhattan\") and he made our cocktail dreams come true.  Not to mention this guy was being incredibly friendly to some tipsy older women (looked like the jazz band groupies) and manning the bar himself effortlessly.  We were almost tempted to ask him to sit down with us just cause he looked like a cool guy. \n\nAll in all, this is one of the best SF experiences I've had.... the live jazz was just a scene on its own and something I'll definitely try to revisit again soon.", "author": "Elizabeth B."}

There are a lot of places in San Francisco where the homeless set up their \"quarters\" to settle in for the night, and I felt like the fact that we were merely a couple stopping by to say hello to friends and then asked by security AND management to leave, in comparison to how many places have the homeless sleep in their stoops each night, we were such a minuscule issue that we really didn't need to be asked to leave. Especially at 5pm. Super disappointing. I'll suggest my friends go elsewhere from now on. We stopped by Tupoli just a block away after we left and were greeted with loads of friendly service.", "author": "Sarah S."}

Obviously I went in - a chance to have the place to myself! The bartender and door man explained the trouble they've had in the past with a neighbor's complaint about live music. So, while the situation has been solved by not having live music, the place is still wonderful and needs people to enjoy it. Check it out!

Some of the ingredients and syrups were actually made by Kyle, on his own dime and in his own time. For someone who's only been bartending for a year, this guy makes getting a drink an experience. Really worth sitting at the bar and hearing his stories, infused with passion for mixology and history.\n\nIf he weren't bartending, the place would probably be a solid three stars.", "author": "Mez L."}

It has two rooms and two bars connected by an open doorway. There is ample seating and three pools tables that you can generally commandeer if you're feeling a little patient. The main bar has an open front that is great during those rare warm nights and plenty of heaters on the more common cold ones. \nThe bartenders are a little forgetful and when it is crowded there are not even close to enough of them. This seems crazy because they probably have more actual bar square footage than 95% of other bars in the city and should be able to handle crowds pretty well.\nGreat for a chill Thursday night, but not the best on a sloppy Saturday.", "author": "Kenzie P."}

I mean...I know he's not a hot girl, but I will tip you if you get me a drink, and I was in line for a huge order.  \n\nThe bar is crowded as hell, and, because male bartenders hate me (see my gbar review), he passed me by not one, not twice, but thrice (the third time he skipped from the guy next to me on the left, to the hot blonde directly on my right).  \n\nSo I speak up...hey buddy, wtf, you skipped me again.\nBartender:  hey, don't you dare talk to me like that.  I'm the bartender, how dare you swear at me\nMe:  you skipped me...three times.\nDoucheface: as he pours the girl next to me her drinks: you don't talk to your bartender like that, how do you expect to get served?\nMe:  You skipped me, I'm not getting served anyway \nDoucheface:  Does anybody here think I skipped him??? (outloud to everyone in the general vicinity)\n\nMy buddy, the guy behind me, and the two girls to my right all raise their hands.

At first my friends and I thought that she was taking a really long dump, but after an hour and half, we were worried so we just started going to check up on the mysterious left staller... after no movement for several minutes, the feet shifted!! Scared of course (because it very well likely may well have been a REALLY long dump), we decide to venture out into the wild as honestly, that's just weird. \n\nAnyway, moral of the story is that if there is someone in one stall for hours on end doing god knows what, you only have one stall left in the ladies room and that kind of sucks.", "author": "Annie T."}

My friend bought the first round ($65 for 4 beers and 4 shots of tequila!).  I completely forgot what a ripoff this place is when I went to the beer for a corona and change for foosball.  $6.20 for a Corona!  I asked the guy next to me if we were in the bahama's or something.  \nThis is not NYC, it is an old bar with a little charm that makes you wanna piss your pants to avoid the stomach curdling stench of an extremely backed up septic system.

I really liked the set up of the bar and during the summer its great, it's very open. 2nd time we went with a group and we had a booth so that was fun.", "author": "Danielle K."}

Its pretty funny actually.  One time we played a couple random guys that were either shitcanned or were just of the super-douche breed.  They were probably around 25-27 years old, but had the mentality of a 12 year old.  First off, these guys looked like they were dressed to be in some club in LA,  were cheering for every missed shot we had, (I was pretty drunk so had a few of those), and looked at us like we were speaking a different language when we tried to just start up friendly conversation.  What made it worse was we actually lost to them because my friend and I were way too drunk to be making any shots.  I'm still pissed about it to this day.  But I digress...Overall, I still love this place because it close to home, has plenty of room, good company for the most part, and has pool tables.
