Give yourself extra time as I added myself to the waitlist at 8:00pm on a Saturday and didn't sat until 9:30 but the best part is we didn't have to wait at the restaurant. You can check for your place in line on Yelp. \n\nI've been here 3 times in the last month and have to say it's pretty good. Who ever decided  to call the meatball here \"fluffy\" was a genius. This chicken meatballs are pretty darn good. I've had the Chicken Paitan ramen and I really like how the broth has a thick soupy mouth feel. I asked if this was dairy based since it was so creamy but the staff assured me it wasn't. How they did get it so thick? potato. The ingredients here are really fresh and organic including the onsen (poached) egg. I'm usually whatever about bamboo but the bamboo at this place is amazing. It is actual pieces and it just has this smokey flavor and a nice crunch to it, don't skip this. The chicken paitan soup itself is like a good chicken soup and brightened with a yuzu (citrus). This is by far my favorite ramen here. \n\nThe Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce has a chicken leg in it. Don't be intimidated by this as the chicken falls apart easily with your chopstick. It was the perfect combination of savory and salty. \n\nI got the chicken bun appetizer and it does not compare to good Peking duck in white bun. The mayo and lettuce was very underwhelming, some green onion might have saved this but I would say skip this. The miso cucumbers were only ok too. \n\nI would say this is my second favorite ramen place with Mensho being my first. But this place is pretty admirable and I've been back 3 times in the last month.", "author": "Lindsay C."}

The fries, imagine fries drizzled with soy sauce and mayo sauce. It was good to start but got salty towards the end. It was $11, a bit overpriced. The ramen came with one big chicken leg that was tender but flavorless. The broth was flavorful, not too oily. The ramen al dente just how I like it. They do not offer extra ramen on the side.

Nojo delivered on the atmosphere and taste of food, but for whatever reason the richness didn't quite sit well with us post-meal - leaving us really bloated and lethargic unlike any other ramen place we've eaten at before. \n\nWe showed up on a Wednesday night at 6pm and the restaurant was already full. They have an iPad where you can add yourself to the waitlist. We waited just a couple of minutes. By the time we left at 7.30pm, the line was a half hour long at least.\n\nThe atmosphere was lively - a good place to get some drinks and ramen but not for an involved conversation. \n\nService was efficient and we took their recommendation for the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce. I was a little apprehensive about the whole chicken leg in the ramen, but it turned out to be really tender so it was falling off the bone. Points off for it being such a different temperature - lukewarm - than the steaming hot ramen that they dropped the pre-prepared chicken into. Also, for the too fatty skin that was inedible. \n\nThe noodles had a great texture, nice and springy, and held on to the broth and garlic oil well. The broth had a real richness to it, possibly overly so. \n\nWhen we left, I thought the food was on the rich side and maybe I'd try something else next time. However, just a little while later and we were both struggling with the effects of that overly rich and fatty broth. \n\nNow don't get me wrong, I like flavor as much as the next person and ramen by its definition needs to have a rich fattiness. But it shouldn't ever leave you feeling bloated and just generally unwell. \n\nFor that reason, I'm going to pass on this one", "author": "Jeremy G."}

I think the restaurant is best suited for 2 people. \n\nFor appetizers, the Takoyaki Fries are great to share among friends.

Now let me say that everything in this dish was incredible. It was well balanced. Great proportions. It wasn't salty like a salty ex, which is rare with most ramen. My keyboard is literally looking like an olympic diving pool covered with my drool just thinking about it. \n\nThe ramen is good, the chicken is good but this was my very first time trying out fried gobo. I was literally saving it for later because I didn't eat too much of it at once because I wanted to get bits of it in every bite. Not sure if I ate it the right way but it was absolutely delicious.\n\nMy green tea was ok. And the macha creme brulee wasn't my most favorite but it tasted exactly like macha.

She asked if I liked spicy food or not, she wanted to make sure I enjoyed my food. \n\nIt's new still, so there aren't layers of grease build up, that being said the place is really clean. It's well lit so if it was dirty you would notice right away. \n\nWe started with the tofu and avocado salad, it also had okra, tomatoes and cucumbers. It was refreshing and tasty. I got Nikumaki rice ball, it's basically pork belly with teriyaki rice. It was really salty but really good. We got a teriyaki chicken bowl for the kid and I had the ten ten spicy miso Ramen. I was sweating just the right amount when I was done. One consideration is that all of the Ramen here is chicken except for the vegetarian, the vegetarian is also a vegan option. \n\nWe ended with the green tea ice cream, they make desert extra fun. \n\nAll the ramen places in San Francisco today, I'm glad I tried this place but I've got others that I like more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-20", "description": "I looove Ramen, but sometimes it can be a challenge to find a vegan-friendly bowl of ramen that has a developed broth that compares to its meat-based counterparts.\n\nI've tried the Vegan ramen at Mensho Tokyo, which deserves its shiny 5 stars from me for its rich creamy broth.\nI noticed that Nojo had a veggie ramen, and wanted to compare the two.\n\nThe Veggie Miso Ramen is vegetarian by default but can be made vegan by omitting the butter. IMO, the butter is not missed at all because this bowl hit my taste buds out of the ballpark.\n\nIt is rich, creamy, dense, and savory. It is topped with corn, scallions, this veggie 'meat' (mushroom?), okra, and beet chips.\nThe veggie meat provided an additional fatty element as well as texture. I loved the addition of the okra & beet chips and wished they put in more than just 2 pieces of each. I thought the noodles were cooked well.\n\nI ordered it as-is, but if I were to come back, I'll probably add their belovedly-called 'spice bomb.' \nSpeaking of their toppings, I think the pricing to add items is a little insane. $2 to make it spicy? $2 to add a few leaves of cilantro or dashes of oil?? Come on...I find that ridiculous especially since the bowls of ramen already start around $17+.\n\nOverall, if we're comparing this one to Mensho, Mensho wins. It has way more toppings included, which makes the meal feel more filling and complete. Plus, I think Mensho's ramen flavor just has that extra element of depth to it. (They finish it off with a chili oil and a few other ingredients)\n\nI also tried the Oze no Yukidoke Sake, which is a filtered dry Sake. Really smooth and delicious, pairing well with the meal.\n\nWe came here at 6:30pm and the restaurant was only half full. By 7pm, there was a wait and a crowd forming outside. There are a few 2-top booths, with the rest being communal or bar seating.\n\nHowever, I definitely want to come back because it is still a damn good bowl of ramen.

In what world can you resist such a good looking chicken leg?!\n\nSo of course, I got the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce - their classic ramen dish with slow braised whole chicken leg, blackened garlic oil, nira, dashi egg, red onion, scallion, fish powder, fried gobo (burdock root - it's yummy don't worry). At $18.50, I was definitely paying above market for this ramen. Though the portion size was average, I was very happy with the flavor and fattiness of the broth, tenderness of the chicken, and texture of the noodles. The broth did get progressively saltier, but it was tasty nonetheless. \n\nIt's really hard to describe ramen to the T and I feel that everyone has different preferences.

I would consider the ramen here more fusion than traditional.\n\nHaving lived in Japan, Tonkotsu style ramen is MY LIFE. I have traveled near and far to try anything that has that creamy oily pork bone broth. They don't have a pork option here. No biggie. Most of their menu is either veggie or chicken. \n\nWe ordered the chicken paitan and the chicken paitan tan-tan spicy miso. The presentation for both was a 10, but other than that, I was not a fan. The chicken meatballs in mine were light, but flavorless and only came with 3 pieces (that's all the toppings besides bamboo). I liked that they used fresh bamboo shoots, but once again it was 2 small pieces.  The noodles were okay. Not chewy. Not soft. The broth was rich without being overly salty, but the flavor reminded me of Chinese herbal medicine that my mom used to brew. Also the yuzu they grated into the broth was over-powering. Towards the end of my bowl, every bite of noodle was covered in yuzu shavings. \n\nThe tan-tan spicy chicken was not spicy at all and the broth was oily and bland. It also didn't have much chicken. The ground chicken sort of disappears into the broth as you start eating.  \n\nWe also ordered a soft boiled egg as a side, gyoza, ice cream sandwich, and some sake. Don't order the egg. It lacks any sort of flavor/taste. Literally just an egg. I can do that at home. The gyoza was deep fried and covered in a curry like powder. Pretty tasty. Ice cream sandwich was good. We got the sesame flavor. It comes in a sugar cone shaped like a Daruma doll. The sake was alright. Nothing special. We got a small carfe and that ran $25.\n\nWe came here mainly bc it's located near the Nourse Theatre (across the side street). Come early (we got here at 5:30ish) or else the wait is long.

At first, I was a little skeptical because I'm such a fan of traditional tonkotsu ramen and tonkotsu is my go to order at any new ramen place. But I was really pleasantly surprised by the ramen - the broth was flavorful without being too salty, the noodles were perfectly chewy and the braised chicken leg was fall-off-the-bone tender. One slight pet peeve: my egg was way over cooked to the point of being just a hard boiled egg. One of my favorite parts of ramen is eating that gooey creamy soft boiled egg so I was a little disappointed by that, considering how good the other elements of the dish were.", "author": "Amanda O."}

While they fell in love with Nojo Ramen, I hated my experience here. Yes \"hate\" is a strong word, but I mean it. \n\nWe put our names down and were told to wait for 1.5 hours. Instead of sticking around like we should have, we went for a drink and came back 50 minutes later. There was a hostess with bangs (wish I got her name) who was so incredibly rude. It makes me angry to think about it. She was super condescending at our request to get back on the list, and while I understand the frustration, there are nicer ways to handle the situation.\n\nAnyways, we were seated at the bar. The stool was wobbly, but it was cool to see all the cooks do their thing. I was sitting close to the end of the bar. I suspect the last seat is reserved for VIP food critics or something because all the waitress treated anyone in that seat like a god, including that hostess. Why don't you do your job instead of flirting with customers?\n\nWe ordered Takoyaki Fries and a Rice Ball to share as an appetizer. They were pretty good! I'd recommend both of them. For my entr\u00e9e, I had the vegetarian ramen which was okay. I wouldn't order it again. I would, however, get the black sesame ice cream sandwich again.\n\nIf you're on a similar journey to find good ramen in SF, I'd say to try Nojo once. I just wouldn't come here again because of the negative customer service vibe. It seems that not eveyone likes working here, and a select few have attitude issues. I just don't want to be around that. Anyways, even the ramen alone wasn't enough to come back, but it's important to experience the whole spectrum of restaurants.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-19", "description": "The best part of 2017's J-Pop Summit occurred before walking through the doors at Fort Mason: a ramen showdown just out front featured an army of ramen purveyors, each offering only one specialty.  The lines for every vendor were off-putting and I opted for the single vendor with a very short line, Nojo, despite being certain that the ramen they were offering was the one I wanted least of all.\n\nThen something happened.  \n\nI sat down with my Chicken Paitan Ramen and it utterly wowed me.  The flavors were soothing and delicious and I finally almost understood the appeal of comfort food.  This was it.  \n\nA meal at the restaurant itself proved somewhat less satisfying owing largely to the value proposition (there's no value to be found in ramen that costs $18.50 before any add-ons) and a perceived lack of complex flavors.  \n\nNojo Ramen Tavern is perpetually crowded with virtually no time when there's not a wait for a table.  By the time I was seated - around 10 p.m. on a weeknight - they'd run out of their Vegetable Miso Ramen and because I wanted to try something new and something different than my dining partner my options were limited.  At the recommendation of my server, I opted for the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ($18.50) and sampled the Chicken Paitan Tan-Tan Spicy Miso ($17.50) of my table-mate.  \n\nThough other reviewers have remarked on small portion size I found the portion size adequate and filling.  For that price though, it should've been about 30% larger.  And, at that price, I was loathe to request any of the add-ons which could easily have brought the bowlful to nearly $25.  \n\nSo I sampled what Nojo offers, straight up, no add-ons.  \n\nOf the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce I'll say this:  for chicken fans, possibly chicken fanatics.  I left almost squawking, sated with rich chicken flavors and not much else.\n\nA conversation ensued and my dining partner remarked similarly.  He wasn't stuffed with chicken but he understood my comment that the whole dish felt sort of one-note.  His had too.  One-note is fine if you really love chicken but the complexity of flavors wasn't there for me.  In no way was this as delightful an experience as I'd had at Oakland's Ramen Shop. \n\nPre-tip and with a $7 IPA, 2 bowls of satisfying if not particularly inspiring ramen ran just under $48.  Oddly, I found the ramen I'd expected to like least (that Chicken Paitan Ramen) to be the most satisfying version I sampled.  Was it because I'd paid less at J-Pop?  Was it because I had higher expectations for the restaurant?  Probably a bit of both.  \n\nNojo is a fine if overpriced ramen purveyor with a  lot of fans.  I'll keep searching because, though it was satisfying, at those prices it should be mind-blowing.", "author": "Tracey A."}

(Lightning fast service was the name of the game at Nojo.) I was surprised and a bit disappointed by how few ramens are on the menu (five, to be exact), but it's better to do a few things extremely well than a few more things just ok.\n\nI went with the chicken paitan tan-tan spicy miso, which has ground chicken, toasted sesame, scallion, cilantro, fried gobo, and a spice bomb. I wasn't sure what to expect from gobo because I'd never had it before, but it was delicious and one of my favorite parts of the dish. It had an earthy taste that worked very well as a fried component sprinkled over the ramen. There was way too much cilantro, all of which I carefully removed from the bowl, but once that was out of the way I was able to appreciate how rich, spicy, and fantastic the flavor of the broth was.\n\nWhile not the most generous amount of noodles for $17 a bowl, the meal was incredibly good nonetheless. I probably wouldn't make a trip so out of the way again - there are many other ramen options in the East Bay - but if I was in the area I'd be happy to return for another bowl of that tan-tan.", "author": "Angela M."}

Despite the cozy atmosphere, Nojo makes do wit what they have. I like the attention to detail -- The bowls are specific to each type of ramen you order; you can tell what someone ordered by looking at their bowl. The chopsticks are smooth and delicately made, but the tips are textured, so your ramen wouldn't slip everywhere even if you're not the most skilled wielder. \n\nWe grabbed literally the last couple orders of their famous Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ramen. I appreciate the waitress going around and telling people they're about to run out, even as we were waiting to be seated. It allows those who came for the specific item to reconsider eating here, or have time to decide on ordering something else. \n\nThe ramen was excellent. The noodles themselves are a bit thicker than normal ramen, and were of perfect doneness. Very chewy without being tough or undercooked, and remained that way even towards the end of the meal. The broth was very rich, especially considering it's not the conventional pork-based broth. The chicken... the chicken!! It was so flavorful, so juicy, so tender. Removing the bone took absolutely no effort; a flick of the chopstick and the whole bone slid out. You look at the menu and think the price is a bit high, but considering the quality, the flavor, and the fact that it's in SF (I'm from LA, where food's just cheaper in general), and the price is more than justified.\n\nThe wait is long and it's not cheap, but if you ever get the chance, Nojo is a great ramen place.", "author": "Vincent L."}

It was around 9:30PM so not many places were open much longer but luckily Nojo was open until 10:30PM. \n\nThis place is located near Civic Center so parking can be a pain around here, but if you're lucky you can find some street parking. We came around 9:45PM so it wasn't packed as I would normally think it is. It took about 10 mins for our group of 6 to be seated. \n\nWhat's interesting about this ramen joint is that it's mainly a chicken ramen type of place so don't expect to get some chasu with your ramen. When looking at Yelp reviews it seems like this place is known for their Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce (limited amount). We came pretty late so by the time we ordered they were already sold out. :(  Instead we got the: \n\n- Nojo Takoyaki Fries - Yum! If you're a fan of takoyaki this is a great alternative. It has all the flavors of what you would expect minus the octopus. It's a great dish to share with a group. \n\n- Chicken Paitan Spicy Miso - Definitely spicier than what I expected & filled with WAY more cilantro too. The broth in this dish was creamy but not too creamy that you couldn't finish you dish. The spice was there and left an afterburn on your lips. I thoroughly enjoyed it but others thought it was too spicy for their liking. I do wish that they had a paste on the side where you can add more depending on your liking. The noodles however were perfect! I love mine a little harder than most so it was cooked just right in my opinion. I did feel like there was WAY more cilantro than needed, if you're not a fan of it I would ask them to remove it like someone else at my table did. As for the chicken, it was tasty but it was sparse in my dish.\n\n- Soboro Noodles (no broth ramen)- If you've been wondering how broth-less ramen tastes then this is your chance! We opted for a poached egg for this dish and I think it was the right choice. It's very similar to the chicken paitan spicy miso but without the spice that the broth entails. The noddles in this dish are a little thicker & flatter as well so it's similar to a fried noodle dish without all the oil. \n\nOverall, the place is in a great location & is clean.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-29", "description": "Having lived in the ramen capital of the world (Japan), I've had my share of the different qualities of ramen. Some are borderline fair to googly-anime-eyes-explosive. Nojo falls in the latter category. I haven't had as many chicken-based ramen in the past, so this assessment may be based on a limited sample size. I don't tend to write long reviews about anything, so to me, it speaks to how much of a lasting impression this one dining experience was. The three biggest factors in my subjective, personal dining experience tend to relate to seating, service, and quality of the food itself, so here they are.\n\nGetting seated: \nTable wait times are extensive. Expect a 1-2 hour wait time. You can set your name on the wait list and walk around the block, grab a drink from a bar, or enjoy a conversation with your buddies. We did all of the above. The table itself is 'Nihon-poi', or Japanese-like. Meaning, if you are a taller, larger, American, you may need to limit how much you man-spread lest you bump knees with other diners.\n\nService: \nWe had great service despite how packed the place was. I think that Californians tend to be harsher on this factor in reviews, and I'm a Portlander, so take that with a grain of salt. Our waitress was pleasant, did not seem burnt out, and engaged in some back-and-forth when we made empathetic comments. Our food did not take very long to come out, which is saying something, especially if they are able to keep up with orders and maintain the quality of their product.\n\nFood: \nI had the chickan paitan, and my partner had the tonkotsu. In both dishes, the broth was rich and flavorful. Serving sizes were large-American-worthy. There was a complex (i.e., umami) flavor that distinguished them from each other and from other places where I've dined before. My standards for comparison for this is based on well-known places in Japan that I tend to frequent in various provinces while living there; Ippudo, Gogyo, Tsuta, and Ichiran being amongst the more well-known ones. \n\nNow, compared with the ramen from Tsuta (a one-Michelin place that also features some dishes with a chicken-based broth), the focus is on enriching the flavor profile of commonly-found ingredients. If you're looking for fancy foie gras quality from a chicken egg, you're shooting too high. What you'll get as you enjoy a bowl, instead, is a deep, rich feeling of almost... nostalgia. I was reminded of a couple of things. First, how unique the experience of enjoying a bowl was in this small-ish restaurant in San Francisco. And second, how the persnicketiness and almost obsessively perfectionistic nature of Japan can often lead to their products having a one-of-a-kind quality. \n\nWill I return and wait in line for over an hour again?

I've been there twice, but the first time they ran out of the miso ramen, so I knew I had to come back to try it.\n\nThis place is amazing for people like myself who don't eat pork but love noodles. They specialize in chicken based ramen, and I want to come back to try every kind. They also have a vegetarian miso based ramen, which was absolutely amazing. Each bowl is around $16, but they're so large that it definitely feels worth it. The only thing to watch out for is that they sometimes run out of certain kinds of ramen, so if you're eyeing the miso ramen, come early!

Avocado with seaweed was pretty unique though. The broth for Chicken Paitan is very rich in flavor and unique with a a little bit of Yuzu taste to it, nothing like I've had before. You can add toppings like fried Gobo and soft-boiled Dashi egg to add more flavors to it. I ordered spice bomb for the table and it was good addition if you want to add some chilly oil to the broth. The meatballs in the ramen were delicious, bamboo shoots are not cut in an ordinary way but cut in bigger chunks and add more texture to it. Ramen was very satisfying and made me full. This restaurant is popular and always crowded. I recommend putting your name down on the waitlist through Yelp before walking over, especially at peak lunch/dinner hours.", "author": "Adel A."}

There was a mix of garlic and even cheese, which made for an interesting fusion not usually seen in normal ramen. The chicken was also very tender, although there were only a few pieces because the bowl was filled with a mish-mash of items.\n\nI also tried a bite of rice ball, which had a delicious soy sauce but was sadly lacking in the amount of pork belly.

There were about twelve parties ahead of us but it went by quickly because many of the parties were no longer there or their whole party wasn't present. The four of us were seated at the bar after about 40 minutes. The worst part about our experience would probably be the parking so be prepared for a walk!\n\nIt was our first time here and my boyfriend and I tried out their most known ramen dish, the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ($18.50). I love spicy so I added the spice bomb($1.50) to mine which I really enjoyed. The spice ball wasn't too spicy at all either for those that like spicy! The chicken literally fell off the bone and it was delicious! The broth was super creamy and yummy. Usually the soft boiled egg is my favorite part of the ramen but nothing stood out to me about it. Also they only give you half a soft boiled egg versus a whole soft boiled egg. There was plenty of green onions in the ramen as well which is my favvv!! My boyfriend also added tsukune meatballs($3) and an extra piece of chicken($7) to his ramen. He said he could've managed without the tsukune meatballs. \n\nOur server was quick and nice. She was good on refilling our drinks and making sure we had all our food! We waited a fairly short amount of time for our food to come out as well. It was about less than 10 minutes or so!\n\nOverall definitely give this place a try if you have the time and don't mind spending a little extra for some bomb ramen!", "author": "Ha T."}

My friend and I came on a Friday night, expecting long lines, but we were luckily able to get a seat without waiting. We came in at around 5:00pm when it opened, and there wasn't a line. We put our names down and told the hostesses to save us a spot for around 6pm. We ended up walking back at around 6:20, and a line was definitely forming. However, we were luckily able to grab a seat at the counter, which I personally prefer since you get a chance to watch the cooks make the ramen. \n\nOnce seated, we looked at a pretty simple menu with just a few options, and we had to go for the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce Ramen, which apparently is limited each night to a certain number of orders. Our orders came out pretty quickly and we were surprised by the huge bowls it came in, as well as the full roasted chicken leg that came with it. \n\nI took a first bite, and the meaty, rich yet somewhat light flavors of the broth hit my instantly. The broth wasn't too greasy, despite the rich appeal of the broth, and the green onions added a lot of flavor. I really liked the onion chips, which tasted like a crunchy snack on the ramen. The noodles were also cooked to al dente, and they used a thicker, bubbly type of noodles. The chicken leg was also to die for: super flavorful, fall of the bone with crispy baked chicken skin, and well seasoned. The soft boiled egg, however, was pretty disappointing and the yolk wasn't too runny. The only major concern I had with the ramen was that it could have a been a tad bit less salty; otherwise, the food was great.\n\nAlso, the servers were very nice and they constantly attended to our empty water glasses.

In this case though, I have to admit it took me A LOT longer than it should have.  Not that I regret it though...it just meant having more excuses/time to come back to try more on their menu!\n\nIn nearly every way, Nojo Ramen Tavern (not to be confused with their previous iteration, Nojo) is pretty damn awesome (okay, except for the general lack of parking in Hayes Valley).  Stepping inside, the restaurant has a dim yet lively vibe, counter seating to watch the kitchen work (creeping on your food!), and a legit menu filled with a wealth of tasty options.  Especially their ramen - a half dozen or so varieties that all sound terrific!\n\n-- CHICKEN PAITAN TAN TAN SPICY MISO - Spicy Ground Chicken, Toasted Sesame, Cilantro, Scallions, Fried Gobo, and Spice Bomb...$17\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nojo-ramen-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=EGFh6Ra5JpxdWh1I_0JNgw)\nIf a bowl of ramen could give you a hug with how delicious it is, this would be of the bear-sized variety.  Just about everything was perfect (if only I had asked them to leave out the cilantro...) - the noodles were cooked well, the ground chicken was awesome, and I liked the fried gobo.   .  The broth was the best part though - flavorful, deep, and not super heavy.\n\n-- SPICY CHICKEN SOBORO TOSSED NOODLES - Flat Noodles Topped With Seasoned Ground Chicken, Nira Chives, Cilantro, Fried Onion, Red Onion, Shredded Nori, Bonito Flakes, Toasted Sesame, and Raw Egg Yolk...$16\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nojo-ramen-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=d9KI3irXiaG-jKl6U4CHxA)\nIf this really has fallen off the menu, it's a real shame.  Other than being a little heavy on the chives, this was TERRIFIC!  The noodles had the perfect bite, the ground chicken was very well seasoned, and the mix of ingredients made for a tasty combination.  What's more, the egg (which you can get soft poached instead of raw) added a nice umami-ness to the dish.\n\nGiven how increasingly popular Nojo Ramen Tavern has become, expect a line regardless of when you plan on coming here.  However, it's actually not too bad if you arrive early; both times I've been here, we arrived around 6:00-6:30 on weeknights and only had to wait about 10-15 minutes, if that.   Beyond the wait, the only real knock on Nojo is their prices.  At the same time, considering how it's comparable with the likes of Marufuku (my other favorite spot) and Mensho, it's actually not that pricey.  Plus, the food is more than worth the money!

I originally ordered the regular chicken paitan but after looking at the picture, I was like eff it, I'm about to order the soy sauce one instead. It was definitely a good choice. The pork broth and the soy sauce combo was delicious. The soup was super filling but a little bit saltier so I had to keep drinking water. There was a chicken leg in the ramen was SO DAMN GOOD. The meat just fell right off the bone and gave lots of flavor from the soup. \nThe chicken teriyaki bun was also very good. It had lots of flavor and I'll just say, I can probably eat like 5 of them if I wasn't eat the ramen. It was that good.\n\nThe prices were a bit higher than other ramen places but I would pay for the price.

I expected the broth to be bland since the menu only has chicken. What I got instead was a bold flavored broth that wants to remind you that there's a way to have pasta with tomato sauce that isn't your regular spaghetti. The noodles were the perfect texture and the broth was bold without being heavy. I added part of the spice bomb to the broth to add an extra spice to it. I personally think there was a bit too much cilantro, but that was such an easy fix that they still get five stars. \n\nSpicy Chicken Soboro Tossed Noodle was suggested from our waiter. I usually ask what their favorite dish is. I didn't get it myself because I wanted broth, but my date did and we were not disappointed. She warned me it was spicy, and she didn't mean American spicy. If you can't do hot sauce without sweating, stay away from this dish. After a few bites I was sweating. But the kicker is that it's seasoned so well! It wasn't spicy for the sake of being spicy, it was flavorful, and happened to be spicy. It was perfect. I actually couldn't decide which I liked more so we kept switching back and forth when the Soboro noodles got too spicy. \n\nI will definitely be back for more!!!

We waited for a short while (we got there a few minutes before 6:30, waited for about 15-20 mins) and then asked to be seated at the bar - it was just two of us. After sitting down, we were given menus immediately. The menus featured one specialty ramen dish - a vegan one - but it was crossed out. I didn't see any pork or beef ramen dishes - only one vegetarian one and 4-5 chicken options. The add-on prices vary - but they're fairly cheap. I chose the ground chicken ramen and added a soft boiled egg. We ordered sake. My friend got the veggie ramen. We ordered edamame to share (so good!). The ramen was good - spicy, lots of flavor, good noodle to broth ratio. We also received a dessert for my birthday - matcha ice cream in a wafer sandwich.

I was by myself, and when I arrived around 6 pm, the place was already packed. It has a nice vibe - modern, lots of wood. I sat at a high communal table - that seems to  be first come, first serve.  Nojo prides themselves on a different type of Ramen - Chicken Paitan, made with chicken broth (not the very popular Tonkatsu). The other thing about Paitan apparently is that it is creamy - often including soy milk. This gives it a rather sweet taste compared to Ramen. \n\nI've heard Paitan has become very popular in Japan and my Ramen was certainly good. Their noodles, which they refer to as artisanal, are beautifully chewy and flavorful - exactly what you want. My Paitan had little chicken meatballs.  They were tender and tasty, but frankly a bit under-cooked. The center was still slightly pink. So far, no \"distress\", but the kitchen should cook the meatballs at least another minute.  The Chicken Paitan had daikon sprouts (yum), bamboo shoots (real ones), and yuzu, which gives it a lovely citrus under-note. I also ordered a soft-boiled egg, presumably poached in dashi. It was a very nice softness - not runny, and made a good addition to my Ramen. However, I give Nojo three stars due to the undercooked chicken meatballs. Otherwise, I'd give it a 4. Also I found it a little too noisy. Not a deal breaker, but...\n\nI also ordered a Cucumber salad w/ Miso. Delicious. Even though they were busy and full (with a line of people waiting), I was out of there in about 45 minutes, leaving me ample time to get to my movie.  The restaurant is on Franklin, near City Hall, so it's very convenient.  Service was polite and efficient - no complaints. I'll be back.", "author": "Carol M."}

We put our name down around 5:15 but didn't get seated until almost 6:30. \n\nWe would have gotten seated a little bit sooner, but Nojo has a policy that all members of a group have to be present before they can be seated. Another group of 5 that came way after us had told them first that all members of their party were present, so they got seated before us. This seemed kind of weird to me, but the restaurant comped us for dessert at the end so at least they tried to make up for it.\n\nI would recommend to the restaurant to add a note to let them know when all members are present, if that's the system they are going by. I'm not used to doing this at other restaurants and thus failed to notify them when our last person arrived.\n\nThe rest of the meal passed without a glitch. We had already perused the menu while we were waiting so ordering was a quick affair. My friend and I split a Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce, which comes at a whopping $18.50 per bowl. Yes it does come with a whole braised chicken leg, but I'm not sure if that warrants the high price tag.\n\nFood came out within 10 minutes of ordering. I snapped some pictures (it was so photogenic) before eagerly digging into the ramen. I love chicken-broths and my favorite ramen in the city is the Tori Paitan from Mensho, so I was very excited to try the Chicken Paitan here. The broth had a rich chicken flavor but was a little bit too salty for my tastes. The braised chicken leg was tasty but slightly dry. I loved the soft boiled egg, though! And the use of chives was an interesting touch; this is the first time I've seen it used as a ramen topping. \n\nAt the end of the meal, our server apologized for the confusion at the beginning and said we could each order a dessert on the house. I wasn't expecting it and was very pleasantly surprised and grateful to the restaurant for recognizing our annoyance and doing their best to handle the situation. \n\nI ordered the matchadoodle ice cream sandwich, which came a the Chinese lion (or dragon?) face on the cracker.

There is also a veggie option, which I appreciated as someone who often prefers meatless options. \n\nIt's not cheap for ramen, but, a filling meal (including a glass of wine) for ~$30 in SF is not something I'm complaining about!

If no we it's located on the corner of linden and franklin. Expect to find street parking here in San Francisco. \n\nInterior::\nBeautiful interior with tons of seats. Compared to mensho, this place lets you sit on a table where you don't have to share it (community table). The chopsticks have a cool unique look to it too. The whole interior of the place though is beautiful. \n\nService:: \nOur waitress was really nice and patient with us. She was happy to answer any questions we had such as what exactly is a chicken fritter. \n\nFood::\n-Chicken fritters: the chickens were moist and the sauce that was put on it tasted delicious. I want to say it tasted like tar tar sauce or aioli sauce. Overall very tasty and delicious.  \n-Chicken pai tan soy sauce: they seriously give you a whole chicken leg! Delicious with the broth tasting to perfection. \n-Spicy miso: so this is supposed to be spicy, but to me it wasn't at all spicy. If I had to give it a spice level I would give it a 1/5 but hey maybe I'm used to heat. The broth tasted really good along with the soft boiled egg that I added on. The pieces of chicken was hard to eat, but they give you a spoon that separates the broth from the meat. This makes eating easier.", "author": "Nadine Y."}

I arrived around 7:45 and there was a 30 minute wait and people lined up around the corner, and that line only grew over the next hour or so. A lot of them also kind of hover where you're seated so made for a somewhat awkward experience. The menu is limited, and as a diehard tonkatsu lover I was slightly disappointed and intrigued at the same time. I wasn't sure how I felt about having a whole chicken leg floating in my soup, but after a long wait I probably would have eaten anything. I ordered the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ramen (at $18 a bowl my eyes bulged a little bit, even in LA you don't see those prices) and we waited. and then waited even some more. \n\nI will say the noodles were some of the best I've ever had. They were thick and chewy and perfect, and the broth was good but verrryyy thick. A little too gelatinous for me and I would have liked a little more of it. The chicken was tender and fell off of the bone, but there was a little too much work involved trying to get the skin and meat off the bone inside of a bowl of soup. \n\nIt's kind of cramped and loud, and you'll be so happy just to sit down when your name is called that you'll take the barstools if offered, so I wouldn't recommend it for a date unless it's your 30th+. Overall it hit the spot at the time and I'm glad I tried it. I'd go back, but only after I hunt down all the other ramen in the city first.", "author": "Lauren M."}

Wait, why don't they have tonkotsu...?\"\n\nLike everyone else who realized it was more than instant noodle, I have become a huge ramen fan and love the plethora in the City (though South Bay also has an excellent selection). When my friend said we were getting ramen while drinking in Toronado, I thought we were going to Iza  (which is also excellent). He corrected me by saying we were going to Nojo. Saw the high reviews from my Yelp friends (oddly save Cherylynn), but I was a bit shocked when I realized this was the chicken ramen place. If you weren't aware most of the ramen places in the city are pork based, and reading a Thrillist article about the best ramen in SF, sure enough the description for Nojo mentions tonkotsu purists may scoff - I did.\n\nWhen we arrived the waiting area inside was packed, but we decided to wait outside. It wasn't too cold, it had more space, and gave us time to talk to some other patrons who mentioned this was their favorite ramen spot. Okay Nojo, you got me. 3 of us arrived early and soon our 2 other guests joined and the wait fortunately didn't seem too long. As we were more attentive, the waitress called for a table of 6 above us, waited a second for no response and then took us in.\n\nThe interior has bar seating, a couple 2 person booths, and a bunch of tables in the middle that can be combined for larger groups. Expect to be sitting close to another group regardless of where you are. Our server quickly came over (all the staff work their asses off here) and we quickly put in an order for appetizers and booze, which included:\n\n-Yuzu Miso Cucumber - I'm glad these were ordered by the group as I've been on a miso kick at Japanese restaurants. Just cucumber in a miso glaze. Yay greens in our diet!\n-Nojo \"Takoyaki\" Fries - I was about to mention ordering these but Charlie beat me to it. When they arrived everyone else was freaking out over the bonito flakes that make it look like it's alive. But so good! These went real fast.\n-Chicken Nanban - Basically chicken tenders but a tad bit different than karaage. The two dipping sauces were great.\n\nOn to the soups: they all sounded good and we were all having difficulty deciding. I was on the fence between paitan soy and tan-tan because I love me some dan-dan noodles. The server mentioned the paitan soy and tan-tan were the favorites but if we wanted the paitan spicy we could just order some spice bombs for the table, which we did. In the end, all 5 of us got the paitan soy.\n\nThe ramen itself was really good - I'm a huge fan of blackened garlic oil in ramen and this added a lot to the flavor. It was smoky, hearty, and creamy with the first few bites definitely had that umami pow that left us all impressed. The whole chicken leg, while intimidating at first, literally falls to pieces so make sure you have a small plate to collect the bones. The chicken itself had solid flavor. I also really enjoyed the fried gobo which gave each spoonful some crunch. The weakest part is the noodles - I thought they could have been more tender, but it didn't ruin the overall experience.\n\nI'm still a tonkotsu fan, and would prefer char siu over chicken most times, but I'm glad I got to try Nojo and do recommend it.", "author": "Michael C."}

We ventured here after having a hugely positive experience trying Tori Paitan ramen for the first time at Mensho and had high expectations for this place given the hype and long lines. \n\nStarting dinner on a chuckle-worthy note, the chicken wing appetizer came with three puny little wings. Probably as thin and long as your pinky finger. We decided against ordering a second plate because the wings were quite dry too. \n\nThe Soy Sauce Chicken Paitan Ramen was really just too, too salty for me. The broth is dark brown with a clearly visible and thick layer of soy sauce (I was expecting a more subtle and integrated flavor) on top. We both left the meal feeling over-sodiumed. I prefer a more smooth and silky tori paitain, which perhaps the other ramen dishes on the menu MIGHT offer. If that is the case, I would possibly come back. Otherwise, definitely prefer the creamier version at Mensho. \n\nTL;DR: 3/5. Long line, steep prices, trendy ambience. Moist chicken but way too much soy sauce.", "author": "Arushi S."}

I asked him what they serve, and he replied ramen. The ramen addict in me perked up and got excited. Then he said, but it's chicken ramen. The ramen addict in me deflated a bit. I was looking forward to some thick, artery-clogging, intensely flavored tonkotsu broth to warm me up. He insisted that we should still give Nojo a shot since people seem to rave about it, so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nIf you're like me, you probably think that chicken ramen will be a bit bland with a much lighter broth than traditional ramen. Fortunately, Nojo's chicken paitan ramen pretty much takes everything we love about tonkotsu -- the intensity of flavors, the thickness -- but makes you feel sliiiightly healthier because it's chicken.\n\nThe wait time for us wasn't too bad, but then again, we walked in at about 9PM on a weeknight. We were seated after about 10 minutes. The place itself isn't huge, so I could see it getting super packed during peak meal times.\n\nI went classic and got the chicken paitan ramen with an onsen poached egg, and the boyfriend ordered the chicken paitan soy sauce ramen. The chicken paitan came with a few super tender chicken meatballs and the typical bamboo shoots, daikon sprouts, and green onions. It definitely had flavor, but it seemed to be lacking a bit of something, in my opinion. The onsen poached egg is a Japanese-style poached egg served cold. (Traditionally, these eggs would be cooked in the onsen -- Japanese hot springs -- and then chilled until ready to serve.) It was definitely a more unique topping than I've seen in other ramen places.\n\nThe soy sauce ramen, though. I stared at my boyfriend devouring that bowl of deliciousness. Thick soy sauce broth, a slow-braised whole chicken leg, blackened garlic oil... dang. I knew I made the wrong choice.\n\nAt a minimum of $15/bowl (the soy sauce is $18/bowl), prices are a bit steep. If you're willing to splurge, go all out and get the chicken paitan soy sauce. You won't regret it.", "author": "Yvonne K."}

Since it's quite popular, plan to either make a reservation, have your meals at odd times, or request your date to stand in line ahead of time. The first thing that arrived to the table were the Nojo \"Takoyaki\" Fries. The fries were nice and starchy, and served as a nice base for takoyaki sauce and fishy tako placed on top. Then came the ramen of my dreams. When I first read the name of the dish on the menu, I was intrigued. As soon as I tasted the first ramen noodle, I was transported to both Italy and Japan simultaneously. The flavors were in opposition yet in harmony all at once.

After a full day of packing, ramen sounded scrumptious. After searching on yelp for the closest ramen place, Nojo was the one. However, looking at the menu, I was thinking 'hmmm where is my pork or lobster broth?? Where is my my slice of pork!?' All the ramen options were chicken only which we thought was strange but we figured we'd give it a go because the pictures looked really good.  And we're glad we did!\n\nCome to find out, the owners of Nojo own their own organic chicken farm (makes sense, right?). Anyway, we both got their standard chicken paitan which is way different than typical ramen you'd expect but it doesn't leave you feeling unsatisfactory. The one server we had wasn't great but as being a former server, I was observing the other servers. I think we just got our guy on a bad night. \n\nWe've been multiples after that and that server is no longer there and the food is always stellar no matter what you get.

If I have one complaint it would be it left me wanting more but I didn't want to embarrass myself and order another chicken tan tan!! Also the Unami wings are out of this world!! There is not substitute for great Ramen once you have tried it and I also love the chicken options as I am not a pork Ramen fan! 4 thumbs up!", "author": "Keyana H."}

It was located in a quieter part of town, and we even found parking right in front. I didn't even know that was possible in SF! \n\nThis is definitely a more modern take on ramen - not your average hole in the wall spot. Everything from the menu to the decor to the bowls were unique but modern. Nice enough for a date night but casual enough for a quick bite. There were lots of tables and even bar and counter space, and the place filled up quickly as it became closer to dinner time. \n\nI ordered the chicken paitan ramen. It's plain, but still had flavor. There were \"fluffy chicken meatballs\" as indicated on the menu - I didn't know meatballs could be fluffy until I tried them. They were light and flavorful.

It's not the largest place so the wait time was expected. They had heaters outside which made the wait a little more pleasant. However, since they were sitting other groups before us who came after, we just requested to be split up because it was nearly impossible to have a table of 7 sit all together there. Now on to the food, \n\nChicken Paitan Soy Sauce Ramen: 5/5\nYes just yes. Those are the only words I could say after eating my $18.50 bowl of ramen. And that chicken leg doe! The meat was so tender and falling off the bone. I really was impressed by the broth. It was just right & not too salty. What really made the bowl of ramen was how fresh the noodles were. In each bite you can notice the quality of it. If you like an extra kick, get the spicy bomb and put it in your ramen. To be honest though, it was alot for me, you could probably get away with sharing a bowl and an appetizer if you wanted too. \n \nWings: 2.5/5\nAn order comes with 3 wings. It was alright, I think I expected alot more from what I read. We asked for the dipping sauce which went well with the wings. I would not recommend them, try the other options lol. \n\nChicken Paitan Tan Tan Spicy Miso: 4/5 \nNot the spiciest but has a tiny kick. The bowl of ramen comes with grounded chicken, toasted sesame, cilantro, scallion, fried gobo, and spice bomb. As expected, the broth was a lot thicker compared to the soy sauce ramen. I only had a couple of bites but the flavor was very strong. A little on the oiler side for the broth but still worth trying if you like a spicy miso based broth. \n\nSide note: They give you a big spoon and the chopsticks are unique which make enjoying your ramen that much easier. I'm not sure why I remember this small detail but I thought it was worth mentioning. \n\nNojo is definitely worth the visit and will warm you up on those chilly San Francisco days. The noodle quality is A+ if you are in the area I would recommend.", "author": "Asia P."}

Not as thick as Mensho, but thicker than Ramen Parlor in San Mateo. I would prefer a lighter broth, but this was still very flavorful and delicious. I was surprised it was chicken broth, because it tasted just like tonkatsu\n- NOODLES: Noodles were good! Very firm, just the way I like them. \n- EGG: half soft boiled egg was cooked just right\n- CHICKEN LEG: OMG. This chicken leg was fall-off-the-bone tender!! I was able to use my chopsticks to take the meat off. Very impressed. Great job Nojo!\n\nThe wait was about 40 minutes which we went over next door to grab a drink while waiting. \n\nOVERALL: This was a satisfying bowl of ramen.

Last Saturday, I was craving for more creamier and richer broth so I got their Chicken tsukune meatballs ramen (chicken Paitan). I was really nervous to try this since it's so hard to please me to like a certain flavored ramen, I always compare it to Japan's and they rarely have chicken flavor too.

The chicken was tender but the sauce really makes the dish. The tartar sauce was homemade and had bits of eggs in it so it was like a hybrid version of a tartar egg salad sauce.

This probably doesn't matter to most people since ramen broth is always pork-based, but I don't eat pork so hearing about Nojo's chicken-based ramen was music to my ears. I stopped by with the intention of getting the Soy Sauce Chicken Paitan, only to find out that I couldn't have it. Instead, I opted for the vegetarian ramen... Womp womp womp :(\n\nFor appetizers, I had the crab and avocado salad ($12). Essentially just avocado and crab tossed in a creamy dressing with two tiny crostinis on the side. \n\nThe vegetarian ramen was $16.50 and included \"soy meat,\" corn, okra, and some greens. The broth was pretty flavorful considering it was vegetarian and the noodles had a chewy texture to them. However for a meatless ramen, I did find the portion to be a bit small. I usually get stuffed pretty easily but I still found myself a bit hungry after I finished my bowl.\n\nMy bf had the Soy Sauce Chicken Paitan ($18.50) and he seemed to enjoy it. He did mention that the chicken fell right off the bone so I sort of just watched him eat it and imagined it in my mouth. lol. *cries*\n\nI just wished the menu had specified about the use of pork broth in the chicken ramen, even if it is an extremely minimal amount.

It tastes like they somehow figured out how to take just the juiciest, most tender (and I'll admit, fatty) parts of the chicken and form them into the most perfect, non-overcooked balls ever.   They are so magically moist and rich that the (completely non-dry, broth soaked, perfectly cooked) chicken piece ramen seemed dry in contrast.  While I think there's no comparison when it comes to the meats, there is comparison when it comes to the broth.  Both are excellent even if the light colored one pairs with the chicken meatballs better.\n\nAlso, I kind of suck at reviewing because I haven't called any of these things what they're called on the menu.

It's conveniently located, delicious, and efficient. We were in and out in under an hour!\n\nIt's also $18.50+, and the restaurant gets full quickly. We walked in at 5:01 (after forgetting to eat lunch prior to our matinee ballet performance) and were seated immediately. Worth noting 4 other tables were already seated, so eager beavers might get in earlier than 5pm opening if they're ready. By 5:30pm, tables were full and people were waiting outside.\n\nWe ordered wings ($4.50 for 3) and two bowls of ramen. The total was ~$55 after tip. We left _very_ full; probably could have skipped the wings. We wanted to try the sake but it was pricier than wine, which we thought was too expensive considering the excellent sake we've had elsewhere for much less. \n\nI'd describe the entire experience as an occasional treat; not a regular stop. Between the richness of the food, the cost, and having to get there early to get a seat... I can't see myself visiting here often, and probably never if the wait is longer than 10 minutes. \n\nI have two warnings: \n-if you pull your chair in, beware that the crossbars are made of thin metal that will dig into bare ankles if they're caught under. Some of the bar stools also appeared unsteady with the adjustable feet falling out.\n-either tuck your napkin into the collar of your shirt, bend over into your bowl, or expect occasional splashes to stain delicate fabrics. My shirt now has a permanent spot on the chest which has demoted it to around-the-house only :(", "author": "Krista L."}

I ordered the chicken paitan and tried the chicken soy paitan, and I was honestly surprised by the richness of the broth while still having a strong punch of flavor. Every time I took a slurp of broth I felt a blast of flavor flow through my whole body. The regular chicken paitan came with chicken meatballs, and I was really expecting dry and flavorless experience, but as soon as I cut through with my chopstick I knew I had something special on my hands. The chopsticks sliced through the tender meat ball like butter, and when I took a bite I was just blown away. The sharp yet rich flavor of the chicken meatball felt like an explosion in my mouth with each bite, and I was overwhelmed by the chicken flavor. Each bite made me feel like I was standing in a chicken broth tsunami, and the meatballs were a true pleasure that knocked the experience to a 5 Star review.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Being non-pork eaters, we were super disappointed when we walked into the store and read that they were out of the vegetarian broth. We were just deciding if we should walk out, when LO and BEHOLD!, we realized that their ramen has chicken broth.\n\nSitting in a quasi-mordern setting by a window, we shared a 3 course meal picking a Teriyaki Chicken Bun, the Tan-Tan spicy Miso Ramen and finishing it off with the green tea creme brulee for dessert. We added a soft-boiled egg to our Ramen. Everything was just so so good; I was so sad when the meal got over. Easily one of the best meals of my life.\n\nWill go back, several times!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-12", "description": "Photogenic ramen and photogenic ambiance, like real-life Pinterest. Sounds about right for SF. \n\nNojo specializes in tori paitan, a hearty chicken-based ramen broth that's the new trend most well-known at the legendary Mensho and now also served at Hinodeya in Japantown. There was some disapproval over Nojo being brought by a Japanese restaurant group, but their ramen is SO GOOD. Especially in SF which is perpetual ramen weather.\n\nWe all got the signature CHICKEN PAITAN SOY SAUCE. $18.5 is a hefty price tag, but it was heavenly.\n- The TORI PAITAN was rich and creamy, full-bodied yet not as heavy as tonkotsu. The combination of chicken and soy sauce created a distinct umami taste infused with subtle smokiness from the black garlic oil, in addition to a layer of dashi-like overtones from the fish powder. The ample scallion toppings added a floral and nutty dimension. I was also impressed by how they got the temperature just right, with a comforting degree of warmth, neither scalding hot nor a lackluster lukewarm. \n- The BRAISED WHOLE CHICKEN LEG is hearty, meaty, and a luscious fall-off-the-bone; the avian counterpart of badass slow-braised pork belly (minus the fat!) Besides the melty texture, the thorough soy marinade imparted great flavor. I would have liked more of a crisp on the skin, like the fried chicken leg at Hanabi on the Peninsula. At the end of the day, I still can't get over how much meat you get with this walloping chicken leg, when the rest of the ramen world pretentiously doles out paper-thin slices of chashu (or the baby chicken wing at Hinodeya)\n- Expect no less than perfectly soft-boiled yolk for the DASHI EGG. Although I cannot claim to detect the nuanced dashi, it was delicious and even more spectacular when devoured with a spoonful of the savory tori paitan.\n- The flair of FRIED GOBO fostered the excitement you get from fried toppings (like fried onion), except the slightly chewy texture was interestingly reminiscent of vegetable root chips. Delicious and unique.\n- I think the NOODLES were the only component in my ramen without a wow factor, but that could just be my personal noodle preferences because my friends liked it. In my opinion, the noodles were not al dente enough, and they used thick egg noodles that tasted a bit too much like chow mein.\n\nWe also shared the GREEN TEA CREME BRULEE ($7). It was like a soft panna cotta with a crispy caramelized coating, with very good green tea flavor. It's a bit pricey given the portion size, but a memorable and excellent ending to the meal.\n\nThe space is predominantly wood, in a corner surrounded by large windows. The metal stools and chairs have these weird suction things on the legs that make it difficult to lift, but I guess it's a safety measure? \n\nWhile the wait isn't as crazy as Mensho and the place isn't tiny, I suggest getting here before 6pm because it fills up quickly.\n\nOverall, Nojo was outstanding in its mastery of chicken-based ramen. You feel slightly healthier compared to fatty tonkotsu and fatty pork belly. \n\nI'm also enticed by the chicken paitan ft. meatballs and soboro tossed noodles ft. a raw egg, but mainly only because it looks so beautiful. I'm too satisfied with my chicken leg ramen.", "author": "Edna C."}

The Chicken Paitan soup tasted delicious and so did the one with soy sauce (it was on the saltier side probably because of the soy sauce). Chicken Paitain Soy Sauce also came with a lot of chopped green onions and dashi egg (my fav. kind of boiled egg in ramen!). \n\nNojo also has a really modern and hipster style environment that we really enjoyed.

Seeing as how I'm the first one here who didn't care for the ramen at Nojo Ramen Tavern. \n\nAs I feared, my experienced at Nojo Ramen Tavern mirrored my experience when they were previously an izakaya restaurant - mediocre and unjustifiably expensive. An extra $1.50 to add cilantro to your ramen?! WTF, that's like a pizzeria charging customers for red pepper flakes. But, I digress. \n\nMy friend and I went to Nojo on a Sunday which has a limited menu: Small Bites ($4-$12) - Edamame, Yuzu Cucumbers, Takoyaki Fries, Tuna Tartare, and Crab & Avocado Salad, Specialties ($4.50 - $12) - Chicken Nanban, Nikumaki Rice Ball, Teriyaki Bun + Rice Bowl, and Ramen ($15-$18.50) - Chicken Paitan, Paitan Soy Sauce, Paitan Tomato, Paitan Spicy Miso, and Soboro Tossed Noodles. Additional toppings for ramen ($1.50-$7) include a chicken leg, tsukune, cheese, soft boiled egg, onsen egg and can't forget about that $1.50 cilantro. Prices are high and portions are small. Beer, wine, shochu, and sake only. Their beer selection was disappointing - just one Japanese beer available (but a handful of local ones) and it was the standard Sapporo. \n\nWe started with the Nikumaki Rice Ball which was underwhelming and not worth the $4.50 price tag: http://bit.ly/1Lx90Ci. A 2-inch rice cylinder wrapped with a paper thin slice of pork belly and brushed with a sweet soy ginger sauce. It would of tasted much better if the pork belly actually had some texture. \n\nThe next shared app was that Nanban Chicken ($9.50) which was deliciously addicting: http://bit.ly/1QqqmBW! The fried nuggets of chicken (5 pieces) were very moist and flavorful. It was dipped in a soy vinaigrette that lightly softened the crisp exterior while adding a layer of savoryness. Loved the tartare sauce, similar to thousand island dressing with diced eggs. Gimme a bowl of steamed rice and I would have been a happy camper! \n\nSo...Nojo's specialty is ramen, Tori Paitan to be exact which is like the chicken version of tonkotsu. Nojo and Mensho are the only ones in SF (that I know of) that serve Tori Paitan Ramen at $15-$18 a bowl. The difference is Mensho is infinitely superior. Maybe if I hadn't gone to Mensho two days prior, I would have liked Nojo's ramen better?\n\nI wanted to taste the Chicken Paitan ($15) in its unadulterated form so I ordered the plain version without soy sauce, spicy miso or tomato: http://bit.ly/1KuWUih. It was boring and unsatisfying; like something I would eat if I had a cold or recovering from the Hershey squirts. The broth lacked depth and was one-dimensional. The tsukune was fine, fluffy as stated and gingery. Noodles were al-dente and springy. I added a soft-boiled dashi egg (+$1.50) but it was just a plain boiled egg. I prefer a more runny, molten center. \n\nMy friend ordered the Spicy Chicken Soboro Tossed Noodles ($16): http://bit.ly/1Ww65Q7. Upon arrival, the soboro looked fantastic with all the vibrant colors and that raw yolk! However, it was basically Sichuan Tan Tan Mein except at twice the price (didn't see organic or free-range ingredients listed on the menu). My friend ate several bites before giving up. She said, \"the spice isn't addicting so you don't want to eat more and more\". I took a bite and the spice was so overpowering (I love spicy) that you couldn't taste the different components. \n\nService was polite and the staff was friendly. However, some training is needed as one staff took away our share plates while we were still working on one of our apps. \n\nThe minimalist and hip ambiance hasn't changed much from when I went to the former Nojo five years ago. Good for a casual date, solo dining at the counter, or for larger groups (two communal tables). Most of the diners seem to be pre-show goers and those who didn't want to wait 3+ hours at Menso (there's no wait at Nojo when we went). \n\nStreet parking is relatively easy especially on a non-performance night. \n\nOverall, the food was 3 stars but the prices are just too high. I have no qualms about paying $16-$18 for a bowl of ramen but it has to be worth it; it's not at Nojo. Plus, visiting Mensho beforehand totally ruined it for me as they're just on a w-h-o-l-e other level.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-02", "description": "Oh, I tried this spot for Sunday brunch about 3-1/2 years ago when Nojo was a more modestly priced izakaya. Coincidentally, I had a $12 bowl of ramen with a thinnish broth and two thick roulade slices of Grilled Confit Chicken but came away somewhat unimpressed. Still with the same name and the same chef, Greg Dunmore, but under different ownership, evidently a Japanese conglomerate,  Nojo is now calling itself a \"ramen tavern\" (seriously) serving an \"artisanal noodle and mall plate concept from Japan\". Uh OK. Well, on a Thursday evening around 6PM. it was bustling mostly with young, hip Asians slurping with abandon.\n\nEven though groups were waiting for tables, I got lucky and scored a counter seat. The menu does indeed focus on ramen but also offers some salads, seafood and sides including small plates that focus on umami flavors. I decided first to try the $5 Teriyaki Chicken Bun because frankly it was the cheapest food item on the menu. It was pretty good with plenty of poultry albeit a tad overcooked nestled on lettuce in a steamed bun. It was drizzled liberally with a house tartar sauce that reminded me more of Long John Silver's Fish & Chips (photo: http://bit.ly/20oZi0X). It was a tasty enough bar bite, but it won't keep David Chang up at night.\n\nMuch more satisfying was the $8 Soy Milk Cream Cheese Crostini. The faux-cream cheese was whipped into a light frenzy of flavor seasoned with Maddon salt. Dollops of this concoction were placed on four toasted mini-baguette slices, drizzled with maple syrup, and sprinkled with pumpkin seeds and almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/1o53GRx). Those were genuinely heavenly bites, so much so I couldn't believe it was soy based. I think I should have ordered more. The main event came next, the $18.50 bowl of Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce Ramen. The paitan broth was an intentional substitute for my favorite, pork tonkotsu, and I liked it. The richness was definitely there as it was blended with blackened garlic oil and obviously soy sauce.\n\nA slow-braised chicken leg was the centerpiece instead of my usual pork belly, and it was accessorized with thick al dente noodles (they had excellent consistency, not chewy), a dashi egg, red onion, scallions, fish powder, nira (garlic chives) and fried gobo (burdock roots) (photo: http://bit.ly/1TCvZCK).

The decor of the place is great, wooden tables, interesting forks/spoons, fancy lightbulbs & nice ambient lighting. \n\nHere is where it went wrong. We went on a strangely hot Wednesday evening (75 degrees at 7pm), so not supposed to be super busy right? Well, the line in front seemed shorter than usual. After seeing 10 people leave, I put my name down for a party of 2 around 7:30, with 5 parties of 2 in front of me. We stood outside waiting, and 3 parties of 4 who all arrived half an hour after us were seated before us. You're telling me you prioritize walk-ins groups of 4's more than smaller parties?! what... Even with communal seating??\n\nSo from the time I put my name down to sitting down to even get a glass of water, about a whole hour has passed. Waitress who seated us didn't say \"thanks for waiting\" just assumed they're so popular people would just wait hours. After we were seated, nobody paid attention to us (no water no nothing) for another 10 minutes. \n\nWe won't be back. This is just so typical SF, in the worst way possible.", "author": "Mingmei N."}

Alas, I only managed to make it through three of my list, missing Mensho and Nojo. But, having finally tried Mensho several weeks back, I knew I had to try Nojo soon after, to properly compare their toripaitan ramen dishes. Coming along with another ramen-loving friend, we ate:\n\n* Chicken Paitan Tan-Tan Spicy Miso - With a rich broth that wasn't too salty, and had good flavor and springy noodles, their spicy miso ramen was a pretty solid choice. While not at the level of Mensho's dazzling flavors, still quite enjoyable.\n\n* Chicken Paitan - The more direct comparison to Mensho's toripaitan, this also came with a rich, creamy broth, albeit one that's much lighter than that of Mensho's, for better or worse. I myself prefer the richer one at Mensho, while my friend found Nojo's to be more easily drinkable.\n\n* Pork Onigiri - I've found onigiri to be pretty disappointing up here in SF, and while Nojo's version of it is simultaneously fancier and simpler than onigiri I've had before, it was the best I've had up this way, with great flavor and satisfying crunchiness.\n\n* Chicken Bun - Not bad, but by far the least noteworthy item among everything we had, mostly because it was sweeter than I expected or enjoyed.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Another large venue with plenty of seating, many accessible, and some less so.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

I know the reviews are everywhere, but since I love ramen, I thought it was worth giving a try if there was a good chance it was going to be delicious! \n\nAnd I'm glad I did!\n\nThe girlfriend and I came here, so it was just a party of two on a weekday night at around 9 PM. The wait wasn't too long for us -- about 10 minutes. This place isn't massive, so I can imagine the wait being long if you're with a large group or if it's prime lunch or dinner time.\n\nThere are a lot of things on their menu, but we weren't terribly hungry, so we went straight for what we came in for: the ramen. \n\nWhat I like about this place is that they want to take the allure and the flavors of pork-based ramen (i.e. tonkotsu broth), but make that happen with chicken-based ramen. At first, I was a little skeptical. I was thinking it would taste more like chicken soup and be very light. \n\nI was so wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend got the Chicken Paitan ramen, which is pretty light, and I ended up getting the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ramen (which was also the priciest ramen on the menu at around $18).\n\nI wasn't a huge fan of the regular Chicken Paitan ramen, which did have good flavors, but seemed like it was missing some extra toppings to be worth coming back for. (If you don't eat pork but always wanted to have ramen, I'm sure any of these would be delicious.) \n\nThe Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ramen though. Let's talk about that.\n\nImagine your traditional ramen noodles and instead of thick pork-based tonkotsu broth, you have equally thick chicken broth (it's almost half gravy to be honest). Then topped on top of the noodles and the broth is a slow braised whole chicken leg, blackened garlic oil, nira chives, red and green onions, dashi egg, fish powder, and fried gobo. Are you drooling yet?\n\nIf not, I've attached a photo to help your salivation get going. \n\nHaving tried both the regular Chicken Paitan and the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce, I will hands-down recommend the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce if you are a fan of flavorful dishes. \n\nQuestions?\n\nWould I recommend this place to friends (who likes ramen)? Yes.\nWould I come back for this ramen? Yes. \nWas the 1 ramen alone worth the $19+tax+fee+gratituity? No.\nWould I drive 20+ miles for this ramen again? No, not unless I was with someone who didn't eat pork. (I love pork too much.)\n\nFor chicken ramen in San Francisco (one of the most expensive cities for cost of living), I'm going to say this is probably about as good as it gets!\n\nNow..back to my other favorite ramen places, where I can order tonkotsu flavored ramen topped with pork belly upon pork belly...", "author": "Mitty C."}

The portion size is great, so you don't even need to order any of their appetizers and you will be in food coma after. Trust me! Save your tummy for the delicious ramen and broth! I have been to many many ramen places in the Bay Area (i.e., Orenchi, Dojo, Parlor, etc.) and Nojo is now one of my new favorites! Even better that it's in SF, more close to home.\n\nMy friends and I all ordered their Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ramen. It comes with a whole leg of slow braised chicken.. a WHOLE leg! The chicken leg is so tender that the meat falls off the bone. They char the chicken skin so it's nice and crispy while the meat is super soft. When you taste your first sip of the paitan soup, the deep, densely-packed chicken flavor will hit your taste buds almost immediately. It was more like BAM! Have you ever had that moment where the food is so good, you uncontrollably say \"Wow it's sooo good\" multiple times? Well that happened to us while we were savoring our first bites. The soup is very rich and thick, almost like chicken gravy, while not being overly salty (in the beginning). The soft-boiled egg is perfectly cooked, but the chicken broth and the perfectly cooked thick al dente ramen noodles are the highlights of this perfect bowl of ramen. However, the soup does get a little too salty once you hit the half-way mark of the bowl, so ask for more water. \n\nWhile the price tag of this delicious ramen is a bit steep at $18.50, I definitely think it's well worth the price and the wait. This place is packed even on a Wednesday/Thursday night, so do come ahead of time and put your name onto the list!

I was expecting the taste of chicken soup to come on strong, but it was rich and flavorful without being too chickeny. The chicken bones literally come right out when you pull on them. The skin has an amazing rich flavor. The fried burdock chips were crunchy and amazing at first, but much more underwhelming once it got soaked and soggy in the noodle.

I haven't been since they re-branded and turned this former izakaya location into a ramen parlor. I'm told by a waitress it's part of a huge Japanese restaurant group, but this kitchen is a side project.\n\nModern decor, very clean with an open kitchen design where you can see the chefs busy about cooking ramen noodles. Friendly staff, running around constantly.\n\nTried the following:\nCorn on the Cob, their Japanese take on the Mexican elote, with cotija cheese. Nothing noteworthy if you're familiar with elote and cotija cheese, it's probably best to slice the kernels down with a sharp knife for serve. \n\nNojo \"Takoyaki\" Fries ($8) - Basically shoestring fries with takoyaki dressing over it and bonito flakes. I was expecting at least a bit of octopus as tradition demands. Quite the disappointment and my fries weren't even piping hot from the fryer. Inner sadness.\n\nChicken Nanban ($9), for around eight bite sized pieces. Really soggy due to the tartar sauce dressing. Literally a delicious \"bite.\" \n\nChicken Paitan Tan-Tan Spicy Miso ramen ($17) - Not a fan of the ground up chicken that almost resembled pork. The tan tan style is there, with the broth being a lot thicker than what I was expecting from a chicken base. Definitely spicy, it had a nice pleasant kick throughout and the noodles had the familiar ramen noodle firmness to them.\n\nChicken Paitan Soy Sauce ramen ($18.5) - Their signature dish, with a whole chicken leg in your soup begging you to devour it, I thought the broth was just right, not too rich. A good take on chicken based ramen broth.\n\nOverall, not too impressed. NYC ramen prices and okay dishes. Rounding in around $34 per bowl of ramen with the additional appetizers, after splitting. \n\nI didn't have to wait (thanks friends!) but judging by the really long line well into Friday evening, I think I'd be a lot less enthusiastic.", "author": "Steven C."}

We started out with a regular rice ball and their made to order gyoza. The gyoza was good, especially with their coconut dipping sauce. That was a good added touch but it was $10 for 4 pieces. Might be the most expensive gyozas I ever had. The rice ball was small but it was tasty.\n\nAs for Ramen, I got the spicy tan tan noodles. The broth was amazing, so much flavor. Not too spicy. But I feel like the ramen is missing some important ingredients. Doesn't feel like a complete bowl of ramen. I did add a soft boil egg which makes my ramen $17.5. My friend got the soy sauce ramen. It comes with a big chicken leg and that was really good. Very soft and tender. I normally don't like soy sauce ramen but their broth I actually like, a little heavier than other places. Very tasty. But his was 18.5 and with the add of an whole egg, his was $20. I think its pretty steep for a bowl of ramen.

At $15 for the least expensive bowl of ramen (egg is extra charge) this format probably won't fly in Japan. But it's working really well in SF where people don't mind paying more for decent ramen in a proper restaurant. \n\nI got the $15 paitan ramen with tsukune (chicken meatballs). The soup was earthy, rich, velvety and has just enough yuzu peel to give some contrast. The tsukune had ginger in them and tasted moist and fluffy as advertised. So I got an extra side of tsukune for $3, which is a good deal. The thick noodles were perfectly al dente. I also ordered the egg, which was underwhelming for two reasons. It was way too cold (fridge cold), lacked flavor and is of a lower quality than is served in Nojo's jidori restaurants in Japan. This is the only reason I don't give the place five stars.

We got the chicken nanban which came doused in tartar sauce and a small salad. The chicken nanban tasted a bit soggy. When the ramen arrived, it looked delicious.

The most popular is definitely the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce. It's the only ramen entree that has a slow braised chicken leg by default.  It was AMAZING.  Because chicken isn't as common of a protein for Japanese ramen, I was expecting a less savory broth.  This, however, was quite opposite.  The broth was thick, rich, and packed with flavors. It literally punched me in the face.  The chicken leg itself was perfectly seasoned. Although, it IS important to note that their ramen heavily leans on the salty side. I was chugging water nonstop after.

All it is: okonomiyaki sauce, Japanese mayo, and bonito flakes on fries. You can make it yourself. \n\n-Tofu&Advo Salad $12: (1/5) not worth $12 bucks. \n\n-Niku Maki (Rice balls) $4.5: (4/5) better than ramen in my opinion, but too costly. \n\nSERVICE: 1/5\nEverything was alright up until after our meal ended. We came with a group of 8. We let Friend (A) in our group calculate the overall cost and tip into the bill, and we all paid based on what Friend (A) calculated. After 80% of our party leaves the restaurant, one server (Asian guy, black straight hair, with eye glasses) who wasn't even our main server accuses me and Friend (B) that our table didn't tip ENOUGH. Ummmm awkward? Why didn't he confront us while our whole party was there? Lol.... \n\n1) Tips are so often expected now a days with shitty service. It seriously boggles me. I don't think Employees realize that they are OPTIONAL. Your tip amount is based on your exceptional or unexceptional service. \n\n2) It is rude and uncomfortable as a customer to even experience this. It is NOT in your place (employee) to even talk down to your customer and demand for more money.\n\nAdvice: if you want a big tip from a big group. Rather than complaining about it. Why not charge automatic gratuity to parties 6+ like other restaurants normally would? \n\nQUALITY: 2/5\nYou're better off visiting HANABI RAMEN in San Mateo.

There were three groups of 2s that were not crossed out in front of us when we arrived.  We were referred to ask the hostess (an asian girl with long hair tied back wearing glasses, no make up - natalie?) for wait time.  I approached her when she was busy stocking glasses and she had told me not too long for a wait.  Ok, she seemed busy so we went outside to wait, it was too hot inside!  Within 15 minutes the three parties ahead of us were sat but we continued to wait another 15 minutes.  Ive been here a handful of times and waiting 30 minutes is very normal if not little compared to their busy times.   However, there were no other names on the list and the shared table in the front and most of the bar were wide open.  When we approached the same girl (who we were told to be the hostess) she appeared to STILL be stocking but she interrupted me while I was asking about the wait time and telling her we were happy to sit anywhere and her response was \"yeah, yeah.  I know, i know\"   then she took off pushing the glass cart into the backroom without further explanation of when we would be seated.  Feeling brushed off, we went back outside to wait.  Shortly after there was a small rush of people.  Some reason we were overlooked and when the hostess came back to seat, she skipped us!!  The parties that arrived after us got sat immediately and we were there waiting half an hour!!\n\nI used to be a waitress too.  I understand when its slow and employees want to catch up on what they need to but when a customer tries to ask to be seated when there are plenty of available seats and you are rudely interrupted so they can rushes off to finish a side task and then forget to follow up.  AND THEN skips you to seat other parties???  What happens?  you lose customers.  We left and we wont be back unfortunately.

Nojo specializes in chicken base ramen, and they do a great job at that.\n\nThis is my second time eating here and although the food is good, the service was poor both times.\n\nWe arrived at 8:00 pm on a Tuesday night and waited 1 hour for our table. The seating process is not efficient because they won't hold an adjacent table at all- not even 5 minutes- to allow smaller tables to be combined. I wouldn't recommend going here if it's not a date night for 2, or you don't mind sitting at the bar. They unapologetically seated many parties who arrived after us, and also turned over two halves of one single table that would have accommodated my party exactly. When I asked if they could put a chair on the end of a table to fit my group, they said they couldn't (which I could completely understand, except see #4 below). \n\nWhen were finally seated, they made us order by raising our hand for who wanted what ramen.  This made it complex for each person to order the toppings they wanted.\n\nThird, they won't sell you extra noodles. \n\nFourth, remember that chair they wouldn't put on the end of a table for us?

It's a pretty big piece too, so meat eaters rejoice. \n\nThis is most likely the best chicken ramen I've ever had. Service was friendly but a bit slow.

Although it's not as good as the ramen in Japan, I would say this is the best ramen place in San Francisco among the ones I have tried so far. I personally did not like Mensho ramen that much because the broth was toooooo thick and they probably used chicken liver or something similar that made the broth really heavy and tasted a bit weird. Besides the soy sauce taipan ramen, the appetizers are also good. I tried the nanban (similar to karaage) and the pork belly rice ball (bacon-wrapped rice ball) and they were both tasty!

Chicken that falls right off the bone and that fried gobo! I'd never even heard of gobo, but now it might be my favorite thing - a salty, crunchy touch to add some texture.

I wanted their Daishi egg instead but they apparently \"ran out.\" I swear I heard and saw the table after me order it... $17 + $1.50. \n\nFirst off, the broth was wayyyyyy too thick and oily. I thought Dojo's broth was pretty thick but this was even more. The taste was alright, but my mouth was just not loving it. The noodles were just alright. I could still taste the flour which meant they probably needed to blanch it more. I think my favorite part of the bowl was the fried gobo... sadly...

The braised chicken leg floated in a bowl of ramen is the star here. Unfortunately it doesn't make up for the broth, which although hearty and not watery, still lacks a certain depth and developed flavor profile that I've experienced with other ramen. The noodles are a pleasant surprise, one the thicker side, somewhat chewy, and good noodle flavor with a hint of extra sweetness. \n\nThe chicken is fall off the bone, braised. The skin has a great golden brown color and still a bit crispy with great flavor. The dark tender meat of the leg pairs really well with the rest of the dish. Marrow lovers rejoice, due to the long braise of the chicken the marrow is extremely soft and so are the bones, making getting the marrow out with a few soft bites an easy task.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is 3.5-4 stars and the this Ramen was a 4-5 star bowl of $12 ramen but 3 at best for $18.50. I expected a lot more out of the broth and flavors there. The bowl is also a pretty standard size as well, not huge, so sharing doesn't really help with the value and would only work if you were both looking for a snack. And with only one leg, you may find yourself fighting over the best parts.\n\nAlthough a different neighborhood- for something objectively tastier and a better value- check out Izakaya Sozai.", "author": "Adam D."}

They're focused on paitan (I'm a big chicken fan). \n\nThe wait was close to 90 min around 5:15pm on a Saturday.  This was my biggest complaint.  The hostess maintains the sign up list, and i think she could have handled the situation much differently. We had a big group and told her we were happy splitting up as 4 and 4 rather than waiting for a table of 8, but she kept insisting this one group was leaving.  We kept inquiring and saying we would just take tables for 4, but she kept saying they were \"almost done.\"  I know she had good intentions, but this went on for over 30 min, and everyone else kept getting seated before us in groups of 2 or 4. Even though there were still maybe 30-40 people waiting outside, she didn't seem willing to tell the table they needed to clear it for the huge crowd outside, so I ended up doing it myself.  The party had finished their meal for a long time (at least 30 min)?and seemed to be just lingering at the table and looking at their phones - either not noticing or not caring how many people were waiting for the spot. \n\nOk so the wait was pretty frustrating, but the actual food wasn't bad, per se (but also wasn't worth $17-20 a bowl in my opinion). \n- Nanban chicken: fried chicken pieces with sauce, just ok. Not very much chicken for $9\n- Nikumaku rice ball: a thin piece of pork belly wrapped around a ball of rice \n- Cilantro, bamboo shoots, and ryu: mostly cilantro\n- Chicken paitan soy sauce: the broth was smoky and had good flavor; it comes with a chicken leg, which is interesting \n- Chicken paitan tan tan spicy miso: I think there was much more cilantro than there was ground chicken. The broth flavor was good, but I think it was too heavy and thick (yes, I know pork broth is rich, but this wasn't just straight rich...)\n- The add on dashi egg for the ramen was nicely cooked \n- Soboro dry tossed noodles: flat noodles with ground chicken, raw egg, cilantro, etc. Interesting concept, but the flavor was a lot less interesting / intense than the ramen bowls \n- Ice cream sandwich: with Humphrey slocombe ice cream. This was pretty good \n\nThey do have a vegetarian option for ramen, which is nice.  Our actual server was also friendly and checked in to make sure we were doing ok. \n\nOverall, not worth the wait, price, and frustration of how the waitlist is handled (I saw other people in similar situations complaining).  Also, they only have one unisex bathroom, which constantly had a line of 3-4 people outside, and when I got inside, there was definitely a lot of urine all around the floor by the toilet, and it smelled like it had been there for a while: \n\nMy advice is not to go with more than two people, but I think parties of two were waiting up to an hour as well.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

The broth was both creamy and flavorful as it should have been and the noodles were soft yet chewy.  My friend ordered the chicken paitan while I ordered the paitan soy sauce.  I loved both broths, but if you are looking for something lighter and less salty, I'd go for the regular paitan.  The chicken leg in the paitan soy sauce was absolutely succulent with the meat just gliding off the bone.  While I'm generally a fan of pork belly with my ramen, the chicken was a perfect pairing with my bowl of ramen and was cooked to absolute perfection.  We ordered the chicken nanban as well which was a great start to our meal.  Hope to visit again and maybe try out some of their other selections.", "author": "Connie Y."}

Chicken paitan-only ramen so no tonkotsu porky pig broth here. I had the regular chicken paitan ramen with the chicken meatballs. The meatballs were juicy and flavorful and the noodles were perfectly springy. The chicken paitan ramen had a creamy, rich, white color and rather full-bodied. Two pieces of fresh bamboo were included in the soup. Bits of citrus (yuzu?) brightened up the whole bowl.\n\nWhat works:\n* Clean atmosphere\n* Clean bathrooms\n* Love the springy, thicker, curly ramen noodles. Perfectly cooked.\n* Loved the fresh bamboo.\n* The chicken meatballs had some grill marks but remained super juicy.\n* Nice service\n\nWhat I wasn't keen on:\n* Price. $15 is rather spendy for the regular chicken paitan ramen.\n* Broth. While it looked unctuous, it was super bland. Super duper bland. It was off-putting to see and feel such a rich-looking broth with no flavor or salt. I couldn't tell this was made from chicken...it just wasn't chicken-y. It wasn't salty. It was disappointing.

(Dinged a star)\n\nThere are no reservations here, so you have to come at 5pm to stand in line to get a table. We were lucky to get a long table for our group.\n\nWe ordered a few small plates to share -- rice ball with pork belly inside, takoyaki fries, avocado tofu salad. The rice ball was so good, but it it was SO small for the price. The takoyaki fries were quite satisfying with the sauce and shaved bonito on top...pricey for what they were though, but I like fries. The salad wasn't worth it -- it was a tiny salad with avocado, tofu, okra pieces; I did like the sesame dressing, which is standard at most Japanese places.\n\nI went with the chicken paitan tan tan spicy miso. My friends got the chicken paitan ramen that comes with the chicken leg. They were raving about their bowls. I liked mine; I should have asked them to make it less spicy because beyond a certain point, the spice covers the flavor of the broth. Still, really good -- thick broth with ground chicken bits and some greens (no egg in this one).\n\nSo, what happened? Instead of splitting the check with different cards, I collected money from my group and I put my card down. I signed the check and included a tip. Service was average, so I tipped the norm. My friends and I wanted to go to another event, so half of us left to go stand in line while a couple stayed behind to use the restroom. \n\nAt the event, one of the girls told us that she was confronted by one of the guys who bussed our table (East Asian male with glasses) saying something to the effect of, \"You know that gratuity wasn't included right?\" She said yes, we had included a tip. The guy goes, \"If that's what you think.\" EXCUSE ME(/US)? First, she wasn't even the one who signed the check; I wish I had stayed behind because I would have given him a piece of my mind about how rude and inappropriate the conversation was and asked for the check back to cross out the tip. I have NEVER been confronted by a member of the wait staff to imply that a tip wasn't left or it wasn't enough. What did you want her to do, pull out cash for you? You weren't even our main waiter; you filled our glasses with water. A Causacian male and female (slightly darker skin, had her hair in a braid) took our orders and came out with our dishes. A tip is earned and I tip based on quality. I get it, being paid hourly in SF isn't fun and you rely on tips to supplement your wage, but hey, it's not like we jipped you. I left close to 15% (I might have been shy a couple bucks due to splitting the bill multiple ways), which is the norm; I only go higher if the service is above and beyond (like making accommodations for a special celebration). What is your problem and why is the sort of behavior even occurring? Come on Nojo. I mean, Nojo can institute a gratuity for parties of 8, but they didn't, so tip is at our discretion, and we tipped what was fair. It's not like we only ordered two bowls of ramen and split everything. We each ordered our own ramen and we had several small plates to share. We spent over $30 per person.

The broth was thick and creamy without being oily. The tomato paitan was really garlicky and tasty. I'm used to traditional Tonkotsu or Miso ramen broths and these were both exciting and unique and still tasted super authentic. I loved everything. \n\nThe only drawback is that you end up paying about $17 for a bowl of noodles. Pretty steep, but understandably so considering the area this place is in.

Two things about this: 1) for an American's palate, it is comforting, a crazy gourmet chicken noodle soup on crack; and 2) while there's lots of hubbub about tonkotsu broths, in Tokyo if you're good, you're good, regardless of the broth base. And this broth is frigging outstanding. I also thought it would be awkward to eat a whole chicken leg with chopsticks, but oh baby how that meat falls right off the bone. We also got the Chicken Nanban, which I would recommend without hesitation. I will be back to try their other ramen for sure, as well as the rest of the varied menu.\n\nEverything else:\nIt was a short wait for the 2 of us during dinner rush on a Saturday night, less than 15 minutes. We sat at the bar and our server was kind, bubbly, and helpful. Formidable alcohol options. Great location for extending the evening in Hayes Valley or on Polk after dinner.

A+ for the thick delicious real Japanese style noodles. I could have a couple pounds of it alone!\n\nAt one point, I went here 3x in one week. I guess you can call me the noodle fanatic or just a fatty :) With that said, I've tried everything on the menu and the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce ramen is a MUST.

This is some of the most flavorful and thickest soup you'll get outside of Japan. If you've been to Kahoo down in San Jose, the thickness is similar, but the taste is out of this world. I had the fall-off-the-bone chicken leg ramen and wifey had the tan tan ramen. The tan tan wasn't bad... Not the best and not too unique, but pricier by a few dollars than the competition. \n\nMy paitan soy sauce ramen was amazing. Justified $18.50 amazing. Thick, flavorful broth (without being too salty), perfect chewy noodles, and a chicken leg that I can pick apart with chopsticks. I haven't been blown away by a ramen bowl since Japan and Tsujita down in LA. \n\nWe also had cucumbers that we hoped were Ippudo-esque but we're disappointed both by flavor and price. The rice balls were good, but again, overpriced at $5ish per ball. On a side note, there was a cook individually wrapping made from scratch pot stickers that I'd like to try in the future. \n\nI'll come back over and over just for the ramen and nothing else, as it could be a $20 1 bowl restaurant and still be successful.", "author": "Jeff N."}

Tasty, but a rather light pour.\n\nWe ordered the edamame hummus to start which was a nice filler and had an interesting flavor. However, I will pass on it when I revisit Nojo simply because I want to leave as much room as possible for the ramen. \n\nWe both ordered the Soy Sauce Ramen and were really impressed. The broth was creamy and flavorful (enhanced by the black garlic oil floating over the top), the egg was cooked to a perfect soft-boil consistency, and the mix of shallots and other toppings worked very well. The star of the show was definitely the falling-off-the-bone chicken leg and thigh. The meat was tender and flavorful and the browned skin was delicious. It added a rich fattiness and mouthfeel to the dish without being a rubbery blob of fat. \n\nWe agreed it was the best ramen we've had in the area and we both typically prefer a pork based ramen as opposed to the chicken one that Nojo exclusively offers. We couldn't stop commenting how much we were enjoying it during and after the meal. I'll definitely be recommending Nojo to all ramen enthusiasts. \n\nService was fine, nothing to write home about.

We all ordered a variety of their ramen, both dry and with broth. I had their chicken paitan tan-tan spicy miso and I quite enjoyed it! It's definitely got a great spicy kick to it, and the flavors are great! But the broth was a little too rich and salty, and it had me gulping down water through the whole meal. The noodles are also a lot harder than expected. I know most authentic ramen restaurants have tougher egg noodles than what you would get at other places, but I was a little thrown off by it! \n\nI'm the end i'd give them an overall 3.5 stars because while I enjoyed the meal, it was still a little disappointing given the price.

We drank water and still ended up paying around $70 for a casual Friday night dinner when all was said and done.\n\n* The ramens (I ordered the spicy miso ramen and my husband ordered the paitan ramen) were both richly flavored and very substantial. Neither of us actually ended up finishing our dish. Maybe it was a little too salty? Still, were they worth $15-17 each. Umm, no.\n\n* The gyoza were delicious, but I may not be the best judge of this because I've never met a panfried dumpling I didn't like. $10 for four seemed a bit steep. Squishing another onto the plate would have felt like a better value.\n\n* The tofu and avocado salad was also quite tasty. The bonito on top gave it a little extra something something.\n\n* As other people have mentioned, charging an additional $1.50 for (presumably artisanal) cilantro to go with your ramen is crazy talk. Seriously, people? How much cilantro are we talking about here?\n\n* This place was surprisingly NOT vegetarian friendly. Every single ramen is chicken-based.

The waitress also forgot our appetizer and it came out after we reminded her, after we had almost finished our meal.\n\nOn Friday night last week, I tried to come here with a group of four and had a horrible experience. Two people had to make a show nearby, so we decided to arrive two hours early at the restaurant to have plenty of time. It was pretty busy, but the man taking names told us there was only one group of four ahead and it shouldn't be too long so we decided to wait. The group ahead of us sat down and the man came back and said that since we were \"such a large party\" of four people (???) and that other group just sat down it could be a little while. We waited for an hour, and while we waited many parties of two came in and were seated immediately off the street. Obviously this was very frustrating. Is 4 a huge and unexpected number to sit at a restaurant? Why not push together two empty two person tables or add some chairs instead of making four people wait an hour? We were watching the group ahead of us at the four person table and after an hour they had barely ordered. We politely asked the person seating us how long he thought it would be and he replied in a mean tone \"I have no idea.\" After ignoring and seating everyone ahead of us for an hour, maybe he could try to be nice? Since there were so many people already waiting forever for food, I guess he could afford to be rude to customers. Anyway, at that point we left and got pizza down the street.

If you're not into the thicker and richer broths, I would not recommend going to this restaurant.  The tenacity of the noodles is fine, but they are missing that delicious yellow ramen flavor.

I have been here twice and the first time they had gyoza and this most recent time, they were no where to be found.  I guess they took them off, which is okay with me, as they took 20 minutes to hand make and prepare.  For side dishes, the chicken nanban is basically chicken karaage.  It's what you would expect from karaage.  Please note that it's $.50 extra to make this dish spicy (say, what?).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-30", "description": "The ramen noodles are fresh and I love that the broths are chicken based, not pork. The flavors are very good and the ingredients are quality. I would give this a 3.5 stars if I could because service isn't great. It's moderately friendly but food just comes out when it comes out so you can get a cluster of several dishes at once and also have a large gap between dishes. They also forgot one of our dishes and did the same to the people next to us. Also on the second seating next to us, they brought the ramen out nearly immediately after the small plates so by the time they had finished eating the small plates the ramen had been sitting for quite some time- not ideal. They didn't apologize for these things when brought to their attention, just said yes it comes out when it comes out and for the forgotten items just asked if we still wanted them (we cancelled ours because the ramen had already come out) and the people next to use were done with their entire meal already.", "author": "Piper W."}

The inside of the restaurant is not too big so the volume of sound was pretty loud. I had the Chicken Paitan Soy Sauce and it did not disappoint! The chicken was soft and tender and fell right off the bone. The broth was simple and packed with flavor. The staff was very friendly and attentive.

I love the atmosphere. I got the Spicy Chicken Soboro Tossed Noodle. It was good but it was a bit spicy and had a kick to it. But overall it was yummy. I didn't really want to sit at the bar tables but we were hungry, so that was ok, I guess. \n\nBecause the bar tables were crowded and everyone was sitting at the table, I accidentally bumped my elbow onto this short asian waitress as I was trying to reach for my phone in my pocket. And you wouldn't believe how she reacted to me even after I said sorry like twice and I really meant it. I wouldn't do it that on purpose! Anyways that look she gave me the creep and makes me very hesitant to come back to this place. She gave me the eery murder look like she wanted to freaking kill me! I wanted to get out of the restaurant seriously! I was like ummm.... ok?? Kinda like don't know what to say except \"please don't hurt me?\" I looked up down the room and there she was giving me the murder death look again. After that I did not want to look at her in eye at all, but I had to when I got my check. She was fairly nice until my friend wanted separate tabs, and so I asked if we can do that. She gave me the annoyed look. She said next time please let us know.\" I was like ok??? hmmm do I even want to come back to this restaurant again? Idk. I;m not going to say she's a b*tch, but I did imagine her as being one only because of how murderish she looked like she wanted to b*tch at someone. \n\nBut anyways that was really poor customer service. I never had someone tell me that I needed to tell them ahead of time about keeping the tabs separate and give attitude like that. \n\nThis restaurant gets 2 star for the food and one star to the guy who gave me water and to the girl who brought me the correct spoon and was nice to it. The overall customer experience was meh.... I really hope the owners keep their waitress/waiters in check and to be nicer.

I had the poke salad and the notorious chicken paitan soy sauce. The broth was seriously something special. I'd take that over traditional pork based ramen broth any day of the week. The chicken leg was equally incredible, flaking off the bone in perfectly sized chunks. A little salty, but hey, it's ramen. My only complaint is the service. By no means did we have a 2-3 hour meal, but we waited 30 minutes to get in, so we did want to enjoy ourselves. At multiple points throughout the evening, we were pressured to hurry the heck up. Literally 2 minutes after signing the bill, the waitress comes over and asks if we're waiting for something. I get it, but this isn't $8 ramen you pickup at a window.

We had four items on the menu: tofu and avocado salad, fried rice ball, chicken nanban, and chicken Saipan ramen (regular). The ramen was by far the best, with the other items needing a bit of work. I incorrectly expected more traditional izakaya style items, but they were more exploratory. The salad was nothing special and had a bit too much dressing. I also thought it was slightly pricey for what it was. The fried rice ball was actually wrapped in pork belly which should have been am improvement, but it didn't add much. Flavor was good but it was lacking in texture. The chicken nanban waa definitely not my favorite. The best thing about it is it came with greens. However, I was impressed by the clean, light, and tasty flavor of the chicken ramen. The meatballs were fluffy as advertised and made a great addition to the ramen. It came with bamboo shoots and freshly grated ginger which enhanced the flavor. The noodles were fresh and perfectly al dente, making this one of my favorite ramens in the bay area.

As for ramen, I ordered the Chicken Paitan Tomato, I absolutely loved this! It's different from traditional ramen with the tomatoes adding a somewhat pasta type taste. I thought it was true to what is exactly in the ingredients, I was definitely not surprised and just how I thought it would taste and more! I also ordered a Ice Green Tea, which was not sweetened however it complimented my dinner very well. The Monaka Ice Cream Sandwhich - Matchadoodle, is tiny, the ice cream is green tea and snickerdoodle and the waffle type thing holding it is sesame type flavored.
