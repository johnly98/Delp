I don't eat Taiwanese food that often so it was good to go with someone who can order for the both of us!\n\nWe were hungry so we ordered lots of snacks to eat:\n\nCold salted soy bean milk - this went well with the dishes - sometimes when things come out piping hot, you need something to cool it down. \n\nPopcorn chicken - a delightful snack food of perfectly fried pieces of chicken that was crunchy on the outside and yummy on the inside. \n\nMarinated cucumber - crunchy cucumber, pickled with chili sauce to add a kick. \n\nBraised Beef With Noodle Soup  - tender braised beef with spicy noodles, this is one of my favorite dishes. This is comfort food to me. \n\nStinky tofu - I used to be afraid of stinky tofu but I've grown to love it. And I love the stinky tofu at Taste of Formosa. Perfectly fried - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\nSteamed sticky rice with pork - steamed in banana leaf with bits of pork.

Came here on advice of my date's friend, since he liked the \"authenticity\" of this spot.\n\nVenue / Service: small and dimly lit, but not too crowded.  We sat on the first floor but there seems to be more spacious second floor, based on the large groups of families that were coming down after their meal.  The servers don't speak the best English but are able to understand it.  They were also quick in the kitchen since food came out quite quickly but perhaps it was because we came at an unusual time (late lunch on Sunday).  \n\nFood: we ended up preferring our small dishes vs. their specialty, the noodles.  \n-- Preserved Egg and Tofu ($6.95) - for those who are unaware, preserved egg is an acquired taste to some, though luckily my date and I are HUGE fans of the funky smelling and tasting egg.  Tofu was firm enough to pick up without completely falling apart.  The sweet sauce should help counteract the strong flavors of the egg, but again, the egg is an acquired taste and may not be great for some peeps.  \n\n-- Salt & Pepper Chicken Tender ($7.50) - almost reminds me of popcorn chicken with some added spices to it, and this was one dish that we quickly finished.  The chicken was surprisingly still moist after being fried and they are served in great bite-sizes for easy eating.  Would highly recommend!\n\n-- Squid with Vegetable Soup (with Noodles)($7.95) - since this place is famous for its noodle dishes, I ordered this one.  Unfortunately a miss for me- the noodles were overcooked to the point that they would break apart when I tried to pick it up.  Didn't help that they were in a somewhat goupy soup (guess I was looking for something less... viscous?).  Lots of vegetables but I had a hard time telling what was a veggie and what was a slice of squid- not that it matters but I couldn't tell how much squid there actually was in the dish.\n\nAll in all, perhaps I'd choose a different noodle dish, but the appetizers we got were good!", "author": "Audrey H."}

It might be a little overwhelming as you step into the restaurant. For those who love it, you will be thrilled. To those who hate it, be warned that the smell of stinky tofu is strong.\n\nI happen to fall in the former camp. In fact, I had ventured all the way to this cafe to try out their Taiwanese street snacks. My bf and I got the oyster pancake, curry chicken and rice, intestines noodle soup, and of course the infamous stinky tofu. The soup was our favorite. The stinky tofu is not as good as I had remembered it to be. It used to be one of my favorite snacks growing up.\n\nThe portions of all the dishes were a little small, but the taste was on point and very hearty and delicious!\n\nAll the dishes were around $6-$10, so it's pretty cheap. It's definitely not anything fancy, but a great place to get your Taiwanese snack fix. There are quite a couple dishes I don't find normally elsewhere such as the Taiwanese meat dumpling.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-23", "description": "I've always thought I was fairly well-versed in Taiwanese food because I knew more than the common knowledge of  beef noodle soup and boba--I was acquainted with 3 cup chicken, beef wraps, pickled veggies, and tea eggs. However when I came here with a Taiwanese friend, I realized that was the tip of the iceberg (or tip of the island, since TW has no icebergs...?)\n\nTL;DR: Flavor and texture explosion!\n\nSituated in the Richmond i.e. culinary Chinatown, Taste of Formosa is a 2-story restaurant with a family-owned vibe. The decor is nice: traditional and zen-like, in fact so traditional that you are greeted by a waft of burning incense when you walk in.\n\nThe menu is one of those wonderful yet overwhelming colorful glossy booklets you find at many Chinese cafes--wonderful because there are plenty of pictures, but overwhelming because there are endless pages and everything looks good. \n\n(++) Oyster noodle soup: The thin rice noodles are tasty in the flavorful broth and cilantro topping. It was quite strong in vinegar, so if you are not a fan of acetic acid I may suggest that you try another noodle soup. Also, I was expecting the ginormous oysters you get in tofu clay pot, so I was surprised when the oysters turned out so tiny. Overall though, I really liked it because it was delicious, simple and, perfect for SF weather.\n\n(++) Oyster crepe: FYI I've also seen this called pancake (or, as my relatives call it, Chinese pizza). It has a good proportion of Chinese vegetables, egg, oyster, and batter, drizzled with this tasty sauce that's something between honey and sweet and sour, only it's too good to be compared to the artificial sauce of Panda Express sweet and sour chicken. It looks a bit odd with the puddle of thick bright orange sauce, but it's better than American pizza.\n\n(+) Taiwan dumpling: This seemed like an interesting variation of lotus wrapped sticky rice, except that the sticky rice was formulated into a jelly-like wrapping around the chicken and mushroom filling. I think it could have used more filling relative to the rice wrapping, but it had a nice, complex blend of savory sauces and seasonings.\n\nIt came out to a little over $20 before tip, not bad! At first we were skeptical when we heard the servers chatting in Canto, but we also heard them talking in Mandarin later... maybe they were practicing their Canto? In any case, TW food is surprisingly difficult to find in SF, and my TW friend thought this was pretty authentic and also nostalgic (which is the restaurant name in Chinese).", "author": "Edna C."}

We ordered the following:\n* fan tuan- not bad, probably the best thing we ordered.  Just wished it was more tightly  packed since it was falling apart to easily\n* braised beef noodle soup - The noodles were not bad, and the broth was almost there.  However the broth very clearly has chinese XO sauce added in.  I've never had this in any beef noodle soup anywhere.  XO sauce has a very strong taste and distracts from the usual beef noodle soup flavor.\n* Chinese doughnut- Good but somewhat small portion\n* Sweet, hot soy milk- Really how can you get this wrong?  I have no idea what happened here, but for some reason it has a fermented aftertaste.  It's almost like it's spoiled or something.  \n* scallion pancake with egg added - Okay but not a huge fan.\n\nOverall this prices are a bit high for what you get.  Sadly I have yet to find a great Taiwanese restaurant in the city.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

The stinky tofu wasn't stinky enough for my taste, but it does the trick, especially considering how rare the, uh, delicacy is.\n\nThe service is both very good and could use improvement.  On the one hand, they refilled my cup of tea with ridiculous dedication, never letting me dip below the halfway mark.  On the other, I had to ask for a check multiple times, which could be a problem if your car is running low on the meter.\n\nThe prices are kinda all over the place.  I'm not sure why the scallion pancake was $7, since there was only one.  It was good, as it is incredibly difficult to get that wrong, but it was strange to me.

There are certainly other places that are more filling for the same price you pay here, but Taste of Formosa is one of the few Taiwanese restaurants around the city. They often only have one person running both the register and waiting the tables, so service can sometimes be spotty, though the food (usually) makes up for it.\n\nI almost always spring for the potstickers (a bit overpriced IMO, but still delicious) and fried pork chop rice (batter for the pork chop could be better but the crisp goes well with the rice).

I guess they're all down in San Jose)  First impressions - it's very nice inside, but the downstairs eating area is small.  If you are wondering where everyone is, they're probably upstairs.\n\nFriendly and fast service.  Both the marinated beef tendon and the scallion pancake arrived quickly.  The beef tendon was wonderfully seasoned and spicy - thin shaved and excellent.  The scallion pancake, on the other hand, was not.  It turned out doughy.  Most places tend to do pancakes dense and crisp, so if the goal at Taste of Formosa is for a fluffier pancake, it would be a great differentiator but in our case, didn't work.  The pancake ended up just being greasy and unpleasant to eat.\n\nOnto the main course, I had to go with the Braised Beef Noodle Soup.  The broth was a richer broth and the cuts of beef were more simply prepared - very clearly not cooked down with the stock - so they held up their own flavor and texture more than most others.  A serving of baby bok choy and napa cabbage.  Noodles were fresh, cooked al dente, but otherwise not that impressive.  Portion size was decided average.  Prices are a very fair.\n\nDon't take the three star review as a huge negative - Taste of Formosa is the best Taiwanese restaurant I've found in the City.  But somewhat surprisingly, compared to what's available elsewhere in the area, best for San Francisco is only decidedly average for the rest of the Bay.", "author": "Jason H."}

Having been lucky enough to have lived in Taiwan for a short spell a couple of years ago, it's hard finding good Taiwanese food here, and this is normally our go-to for Taiwanese food. \n\nHowever, tonight I had the salt and pepper chicken tender appetizer, which came with a bee fried and breaded in one of the bits. Oddly enough, fried bees are in fact something you can get in a little village called Wulai in Taiwan (check out http://www.travelchannel.com/TV_Shows/Bizarre_Foods/Episodes_Travel_Guides/ci.Taiwan_Episode.map), and they're actually pretty good once you get over what you're eating. But I really like to know when I'm going to be eating a bee or a bug or any kind of animal that I didn't order. \n\nAs an aside, we eat out regularly, so maybe statistically speaking it's about time I found something in my food that wasn't supposed to be there. A bee's definitely the oddest thing to find and still better than a cockroach or anything like that. \n\nDear Taste of Formosa, pleeeease take more care next time.

I'm always overjoyed when I go to any Taiwanese restaurant since they seem harder to find than some other cuisines, but I will try to evaluate this place without the bias of being a total Taiwanophile. \n\nThe first thing I noticed is that the prices are really steep. Granted, all the stuff I ordered here is stuff I miss from Taiwan, and as such, the last time I had any of these food items, they each cost me less than a dollar off the street. But even without that, I don't think the portion sizes nor the quality merit the average of 7 or 8 dollars a dish. Taiwanese food is snack-y and tapas-style mostly  so this turns into a bit of splurge if you want to order multiple things. \n\nThe beef noodle soup is so-so, the flavor is overwhelming of Taiwanese bbq sauce (sha cha sauce) and doesn't have the rich spicy aroma of properly braised beef. The noodles aren't as chewy as I would have liked either and the soup was on the salty side. We also ordered the duck tongues, which were pretty good, the Taiwanese rou yuan (glutinous meat dumpling thing), which was somewhat decent (not chewy enough, not enough filling, but the sauce was good), chilled cucumbers (a little too sweet), and the Taiwanese chicken pork sausage (probably the highlight of the meal). I really wanted to get the oyster omelette, cause that's my go-to at Taiwanese places but the Yelp reviews said to skip it. Another bummer.\n\nAll in all, not the best Taiwanese food I've had but definitely will be a go-to place to sate those T-food cravings now and then.

It looks like a teahouse too.  The downstairs area is small but there is an upstairs area that we didn't see.\n\n* Scallion pancake ($5.95): excellent, features crispy thin layers of golden pan-fried dough, plenty of scallions, crispier and more layered than usual\n* Dry fried sauteed green beans ($7.95): oily but good, liked the texture, slightly crispy but still soft, doused with many sesame seeds, a little salty\n* Lion's head casserole: good but not great, didn't have bean threads, probably the weakest dish \n* Spicy fish filet ($11.95?): delicious, mild, tender white fish, bathed in hot chili oil, topped with chiles, green onions\n* Stinky tofu: fried crispy cubes with a mildly spicy dipping sauce.  I liked the crispy refreshing cucumber salad on the side - a nice contrast.  It wasn't that stinky.\n\nThe menu is filled with Taiwanese street snacks.  You'll also find noodles, porridge, soups, rice plates, saut\u00e9ed dishes, etc...and red bean desserts.", "author": "Lolia S."}

Sat down for awhile and finally decided on a few plates. Right after we ordered was when they started eating, opening at 11:30pm. They were more focused on lunch than us. \n\nWe had the Mao Po Tofu. The amount that was in that big bowl was equal to 2 rice bowls. The flavor was nothing special. No spices but salt and chili pepper oil.    \n\nOur Sticky Rice Roll was next. The rice was fully cooked, a challenge for this stuff so that was good. Had a crispy piece of Chinese donut in the center, but the lack of dried pork made the dish almost flavorless. \n\nOur Deep Fried Intestines was the best. It is very hard to screw this up other than them not cleaning it properly. Since we didn't get sick, I guess they did.\n\nThe last plate to come was the Stinky Tofu.

Although I ordered Taiwanese-specific fare because I hadn't seen these dishes in a while, I was disappointed because of the portioning and taste. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the sauce for the fried chitterlings: absolutely delicious and perfect in terms of sweetness, spiciness, and flavor. The chitterlings themselves were a bit disappointing; no Taiwanese sausage inside the rice part, the outer skin was not crispy enough and just stuck to my teeth.\n\nThe oyster pancake also had pretty bomb sauce, but the pancake itself was not crispy enough on the outside and basically, was a small limp mess of pancake and a limited amount of oyster. It was also unexpectedly tiny for its $6.95 price-tag ( about 6 inches in diameter).\n\nMy friend and boyfriend both ordered the pork chop dish, which basically had pork chops that tasted like popcorn chicken with limp breading. The soy sauce eggs were so overboiled that they became small, hard, salty eggs.\n\nThe pork and preserved egg congee was also lacking; the pork just tasted like chicken strips, and the preserved eggs were difficult to spot.\n\nOverall, the sauces here were great; the other food not so much. Also, although the waitress diligently refilled our tea, she was also the quietest person I've ever met. She basically whispered to us when she took our order and whenever we asked her about anything.\n\nI've definitely experienced better, especially if I pay $20+ for a small meal.", "author": "Crystal W."}

So when we found Taste of Formosa, we went there immediately. \n\nThey have a good menu with lots of authentic dishes. My happiness just by reading this menu was so high. Everything we ordered was authentic Taiwanese food, by name. When we tasted the food, my happiness decreased less by less. They were not bad, but not good either. I wouldn't blame them. They want to include too much in one restaurant. Every of these dishes missed something, yes, I'm saying they're not authentic enough. In Taiwan these authentic dishes each had its unique flavor. Many even is the only food sold  by the owner. So I can understand it's too difficult to make every dish taste as good as they're in Taiwan. \n\nBut I would say the flavors taste good if I don't consider the 'not authentic enough' part. \n\nI read some review talk about the portion are small and price kinda expensive. Well, the small portion is collect. Many of them are sold in night markets where you eat many authentic small dishes from different venders. But the price in Taste of Formosa is indeed expensive, you cannot eat these small dishes the way you do in Taiwan or you'll have a small hole in your wallet.", "author": "V L."}

Right, just in case you wanted to down a couple of shots of Grey Goose with your stinky tofu (it would probably take me to do that just to go near that stuff).\n\nThe oyster pancake and various rice dishes are the most common items on my order and are usually satisfying.

Here is my critique:\n\nFood - 3 stars\nService - 2 stars\nAmbience - 4 stars\n\nAppetizers:\n\n1. Scallion pancakes - I would recommend this appetizer.  It was very good.\n2. Stinky Tofu - soooooo disappointed.  First of all, it wasn't stinky.  I was expecting to smell it as they were bringing it up the stairs.  The weird part is that it was hard to smell the stinkiness, then the tofu tasted like *ss.  I heard it is supposed to smell like *ss, but taste delicious.  Either different chef than the other reviewers, or they are making it wrong.  I heard it is supposed to be really stinky.\n3. Fried oysters - delicious, but where did they get the oysters?  Where I'm from, oysters are 3-4 inches long.  These were the size of razor clams.\n4. Combo Appetizer - pickled pig ears, tea eggs, black fungus, and marinated cold tofu cake.  Pig ears were good, but didn't care for the rest.  The tofu was like eating a wet sponge.  The fungus had the consistency of kelp.  Tea eggs were like normal chicken eggs.\n5. Fried pork intestines - weird taste where it was not prepared right. It crunchy on the outside, but super chewy on the inside.  I have had better.\n\nEntrees:\n1. Pineapple shrimp - not bad flavor, but wished they used a lighter batter.\n2. Braised eggplant with garlic sauce - it was pretty good.  Nothing too special.  They cooked the eggplant OK.\n3. Mango Beef - beef, mango, and pineapple with some sauce.  It was OK.\n4. Bacon with napa cabbage \"salad\" - let's sprinkle bacon bits on a couple of leaves of cabbage.  What an insult!\n5. Watermelon drink - OK....people said I have to get this.  It literally was blended watermelon.  I was expecting something mindblowing.\n6. Rice - since the meal didn't come with rice, then we had to pay for rice by the bowl.  I think they should have a big side order of rice instead.\n\nDessert:\n\nAll their desserts contained red beans.  Nothing seemed appetizing.  I guess desserts wasn't meant to be the highlight of the menu.\n\nService:\n\nOur server wasn't as attentive as I hope she would be.  Also, I'm surprised we didn't get any water.  We just got hot tea.  The biggest disappointment was that we ordered a fish fillet dish, but never got it.  I'm not sure if she didn't enter it, or the cooks overlooked it in our order.\n\nAmbience:\n\nWe were upstairs, which was a larger and more pleasant experience than downstairs.  It was an open area.  We were next to the bar, which had a large TV playing Chinese music.   The lighting was adequate.\n\nSummary:\n\nOverall, I'm not sure what the hype is about this place.  Either I'm ordering the wrong dishes, went at the wrong time when they changed chefs, or my palette is so different than everyone elses.  I just wasn't sold on this place.

I enjoyed the ketchup sauce on top of this crepe, so I think next time I'm going to get the Shrimp Crepe.\n\nGot another dish that was beef and veggies in a bowl of spicy sauce.

I came here a few times knowing their cooking is not consistent. \n\nMy boyfriend and I usually order a oyster pancake (o wah jin), fried intestine, intestine stuffed with sticky rice, stinky tofu, and braised beef and soy suace egg with rice. \n\nThe oyster pancake is  a wet pancake with a chewy mochi like substance. The veggies they use are quite fresh. \n\nThe fried intestine and intestine stuffed with sticky rice are the two dishes that are not consistent. Sometimes, the fried intestines are over cooked making it hard to chew. This dish normally comes with a red vinergarette sauce. \n\nOften, the stuffing does not carry enough taste making the whole dish quite bland. Even the sauce accompanying the meal does not help, as the taste of the sauce will only dominate the original taste. \n\nMy favorite is the braised beef and soy sauce egg with rice. The meat is nice and tender filling your mouth with joy in every bite. Many places have a problem with over cooking the braised beef, but this place is the exception. You could add a soy sauce egg to your meal, but there is nothing special about the egg. Just an extra.  \n\nStinky Tofu!

Oh, and the egg with the rice is $1 more and dry. DRYDRYDRY.\n\nOnto the tofu. Mmmm, fried crisp to the taste, but sadly it lacked the stinkyness. I mean, it's still stinky for sure but it wasn't stinky enough. Not sure how to explain. Definitely had better in San Gabriel and so-cal, but I can't complain.

The oyster rice noodles were decent, but the broth was thin and not the right thick, viscous consistency. The beef noodle soup was flavorful, but the beef was tough and not quite melt-in-your-mouth tender. Oyster pancake and scallion pancake were both just okay. The stir-fired kidneys were bland and under seasoned.\n\nThe stand-out dishes were sour mustard greens soup with intestines, pork belly with garlic sauce, and fried pork chitterlings. If you can't make it to Spices I or Grand Harbor in Fremont, Taste of Formosa is a decent substitution. Just don't expect it to satisfy all your Taiwanese food cravings.\n\nBy the way, parking in this area is a pain in the behind.

There aren't that many Taiwanese restaurants in SF.  I used to have to drive to Cupertino, Santa Clara, or LA to find good Taiwanese food.  The food in this place is decent but pricier than other places I'd been to outside of SF.  This is probably due to lack of competition in Taiwanese food in SF.  \n\nI order the following dish and here are my thoughts about the food:\n\n5 stars:  Braised pork over rice (Ru Rou Fan). It's very authentic and tastes great.  It's my favorite dish when I was growing up in Taiwan.  This is the dish that got me hooked to this place.  I love this dish so much that I look for recipes online and make it at home.  \n\n5 stars: Green onion pancake.  It's so crispy and slightly buttery.  It's on the oily and greasy side, so it's not a good dish to order if you are trying to loose weight.\n\n3 stars: Smelly tofu.  I had better ones from Taiwan.  \n\n3.5 stars: Taiwanese fried rice noodles.  It tastes good except they put too much MSG.\n\n5 stars: ice cold soy milk.  It's tastes very refreshing and similar to the hand made soy milk.  It's not too sweet either. \n\n2 stars: Taiwanese sausage fried rice.  Don't bother with this dish at all!  The sausage was good, but they added only peas, carrot cubes, soy sauce and MSG over rice.  The rice tastes kind of plain and generic.\n\nOverall, I think this place is a good place to go if I only order dishes that have good reviews on Yelp.  I do save time and money on gas, so I can go on a real trip to Taiwan to have all the good food out there.  \n\nFYI:  They provide free deliveries to Richmond District SF (minimum $20 or more) and to Sunset District SF (minimum $30 or more).  They also provide free parking on 23rd Avenue if your dining bill is more than $35.", "author": "YH B."}

We order duck tongue, pork belly, fish ball soup, veggie dumplings, tofu and one other dishes.\n\nwhile there are vegetarian dishes here most notably the stinky tofu, this is a place that that's about animal parts, pig's ear, duck tongue, blood soups etc. If you realize that it's stupid to eat one part of an animal but then turn your nose up at other parts this is a great place to try all the parts you have ignored. Of course if you are Taiwanese you'll be familiar with most of the dishes.\n\nthe duck tongue is served cold are many of the small snack dishes and a good portion but the best thing was the pork belly.

We ordered an order of the Chinese donut, fried minced pork noodles (me), and fried chicken bento (him).  Chinese donut...can't really mess it up; it was fine..greasy fried goodness!  The noodles were reminsicent of the minced pork and cucumber noodles that I get at Shanghai restaurants like Shanghai Dumpling in Millbrae, but it's better there.  At Formosa there was some unidentifiable object that looked like tofu..or..kinda like pig's blood that I would see at Dim Sum restaurants...eww yeah I hope it was tofu.  My bf didn't really like his fried chicken, as it wasn't very crispy, the portion was kind of small, and some pieces were tough.  He also didn't care for the bento tea egg or veggies.

The stinky tofu was about as legitimate as I've ever found in the States, about as good as the best Taiwanese restaurants in Southern California. The Taiwanese pan-fried rice noodles, marinated meat over rice, and beef noodle soup are all very homey and tasty. I've only tried the more traditional, home-style Taiwanese dishes, but they're all highly recommended!\n\nThe only problem we encountered with the food was when we asked for the classic oyster omelette -- they didn't have any oysters and instead suggested a shrimp omelette. Um, WHAT? What kind of Taiwanese oyster omelette doesn't have oyster in it?! \n\nAlso, I do wish the staff was less awkward about all the staring they do.

Can you believe that?\n\nSo I got to the festival about an hour before it ended, and all of the concession stands were pretty much out of food.  Luckily, I had my friend Queena H. with me, so aside from being local to San Francisco, she is also a foodie, and wanted to try out a Taiwanese restaurant that she knew about in the Richmond district.\n\nReading through the reviews on Yelp, we both thought it would be pretty decent, and ventured forth.  Maybe it was a lot better because I still had the awful taste of Sunrise Restaurant in Sunnyvale in mind from the day before... \n\nSo some of the reviews in Yelp said that they had tiny dishes, so we decided to order 5 dishes.  Maybe they listen to the complaints on Yelp because these dishes were definitely not small, and ordering 5 dishes for 2 people was way too much.  Our first indication of this was when they moved another small table next to ours in order to accommodate all the dishes.\n\nSo upon reading the reviews, I went in with the mindset that the food would be pretty similar to what I would expect from Taiwan, and they did not fail to disappoint.\n\nThe Taiwan Mi-fen (thin rice noodles) was definitely flavorful and very similar to what I remember having when I was in Taipei.  It was flavorful enough that I didn't have to add any white pepper into it.\n\nThe Tsong You Bing (onion pancake) was a bit different from what I am used to, but still pretty good.  It was sweeter than what I am accustomed to (it's usually salty, and more reminiscent of the Korean pajun) since it was a golden-brown crust versus the whitish color I am used to. \n\nWe also got a dish with green beans and ground beef in it (sorry, forgot the name), that was really good.  The string beans were definitely crunchy, and the ground beef and tiny shrimp in it definitely added to the flavor.\n\nThe mapo tofu was just like any other mabo tofu I have had.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything special to me either.\n\nFinally, there was the Yen Su Ji (fried chicken nuggets).  This was really good too.  Of course, you can also get some pretty good ones at places like Tapioca Express or other Pearl tea establishments, and it is more of a snack item than it is a dish for dinner, we just had to try it, and it was definitely a very good choice.\n\nWe washed everything down with some Taiwan Beer, and it still has this fruity aftertaste that I am used to now.  \n\n-1 star for service.  Our waitress didn't seem to like us being there, and didn't seem to be comfortable speaking in English, so we had to switch to Chinese.  She was not very friendly, and everything seemed to be thrown onto the table, and then she left.  Well... at least that part was an authentic Taiwanese experience.\n\nAs for the ambiance of the place, it was well decorated, and very pleasant.  It had more of a modern flair to it, and was nicely done.  It did feel a bit like Q-cup or Tapioca Express with the LCD TV playing Chinese karaoke videos, but it was still very nicely done.\n\nSo were there any funny or interesting stories while there? Nothing really, but I did find it odd that my friend, who is a \"wai shen ren\" (Taiwanese, but came from China after the KMT), didn't realize that Tsingtao is a Chinese beer, and NOT a Taiwanese beer, and also didn't realize that Tsingtao beer refers to Tsingtao, China, of where it is brewed.", "author": "Michael C."}

I went to the Yelp Prom (http://www.yelp.com/events/oakland-enchantment-by-the-sea-prom-to-benefit-hands-on-bay-area) with Kerrie and her 1HMF and I was being a complete darling by taking lots of pictures of them together, urging them to dance, and most importantly, leaving them alone when they wanted to make out. I'm good at picking out cues they gave out when they're trying to tell me to get lost.\n\nI'm kidding. They're nice people. 1HMF was so nice that when we went to Taste of Formosa for dinner before the prom, he paid for everything.\n\nTaste of Formosa is a Taiwanese restaurant that's apparently a rarity in SF. I don't know if it's authentic or not because I've only been to Taiwan once and the last Taiwanese restaurant I went to was in Singapore.\n\nSo we just picked some snack items that sounded good. 1HMF recommended the green onion pancake because according to him, Ed to the M swears by it. And who am I to question the great Ed to the M, the ultimate chink? So we got that, chive pocket, sticky rice with pork, crepe with oyster, and deep fried squid.\n\nThe green onion pancake was pretty good. Not something I'd swear by though *ducks rocks thrown by Ed's fans*. The crepe was a little weird. It looked like egg foo yung and tasted like gluten. I think I like the sticky rice and the calamari the best. The chive pocket was okay. I think it gave me bad breath for the rest of the night. Those of you who talked to me at the prom, I'm sorry if my breath offended you.\n\nFive snack plates were actually pretty fulfilling. No need to get full plates, and you get to taste a variety of dishes for reasonable price. I think the bill came to about $30 for everything. Service was fine, a little slow in the beginning, but nothing majorly irritating. \n\nOverall, that dinner was a nice opening for the prom night. Thanks, Kerrie and 1HMF, you guys are awesome.

Taste of Formosa is one of the better ones, and more authentic in taste compare to some in the Bay Area.  I'd give it 3.5 stars but they deliver and the restaurant is very clean so I decide to round up the stars.\n\nDishes that always bring us back:\nScallion pancake is definitely outstanding, here they make it close to the style of hand-grab pancake (soh-juah bin).  As is Taiwanese Style Dumpling (ba-wan), very yummy.  Not sure why it's translated as dumpling, it is more of a giant meat pocket.  \nWe always get Pork with Vegetable soup with added rice noodle, not too greasy and it tastes better than the Southland Taste in Cupertino.\nClams with basils reminds me of little seafood restaurants along the coast of Taiwan and it is tasty.  Braised brown pork over rice, boy do I feel like I was back in Taiwan eating those tasty boxed lunch they serve on the train or in fast food restaurant.  Quite authentic.\n\nDishes that are not too bad, but you could definitely find at other restaurants that do it much better within 50 miles radius are:\nTaste of Formosa's Spicy Wonton is good but I like the sauce from Joy in Foster City.\nI also love pork kidney and am grateful they actually have it on the menu, but the slices are few and it should be considered an appetizer rather than charging the price of a main dish.  So far, only Happy Cafe, Little Shanghai in San Mateo and Hong Fu in Cupertino have better and more delectable pork kidneys.\nBraised Beef noodle soup is good with a solid soup base and the noodles are ok.  I like the one at Grace Garden in Burlingame.\nThe cold dishes overall not bad, but nothing too unique.\n\nI love the taste of these dishes but unfortunately these were the lower ranked dishes:\nThe oyster pancake and the oyster vermicelli are very tasty, especially the pancake where they use Taiwanese bak-choy and they are not too heavy on the sauce.  Unfortunately the key ingredient (oysters) didn't taste fresh.  I think they use frozen oyster which is too bad as we live in the bay area, and have access to fresh oysters.\n\nWish list: stinking tofu, savory stuffed rice ball soup, grilled corn.\n\nOverall, it's a delight to find this place that can somewhat satisfy a craving for Taiwanese night market food, and obviously we've been back several times.", "author": "MooMoo L."}

We topped it off with turnip & ribs soup, a big pot of fried rice, and shredded pork and tofu.  The dishes were all very strong.

They also brought us the pork dumplings, but we didn't get twisted up about it because we would have been just as willing to order that.  \n\nThe soup as especially good -- just the right amount of white pepper, and the broth was not at all oily.  The soup even had some fish balls thrown in as a bonus.  \n\nBy far the best dish was the pork in hot oil.

Kind of like what you might find at a Crate & Barrel or possibly on sale at Ross. We ordered mei fun, won ton soup, tsong yo bing, gwoh tieh and ja jang mien. Hope you can figure out what that was. I thought all the food was good and was surprised. Usually, only good food comes from places where you sit on stools, the chopsticks are bleached, and the tables are plastic. This place provided a nice atmosphere. Nice, but confusing if you're Taiwanese and from Taiwan like me, and are used to the night markets or cockroaches crawling around on the walls. I'm still trying to figure out if it's a good thing or not. Also, the waitresses spoke Mandarin, but really need to learn more English.

For the 4 dishes we ended up ordering, it was about $33.  The Tainam bowl cake was good, although a little fatty in taste for me.  The mapo tofu was the best I've personally had, and had the right amount of spice.  The stir-fried udon was good, but nothing too special.  The garlic basil eggplant was good, and had a nice presentation as it came out in a large wonton bowl of sorts.  \n\nAll-in-all, the food was good, but not the best I've had.  If I were to drive to the city for Taiwanese, I think I'd still go over to Spices! a few blocks up the street from here.\n\nThe staff was also very friendly about constantly refilling my tea cup, as I apparently was dehydrated.  The one major upside for this establishment is that they accept credit cards (including AMEX).  \n\nAlso, the bathroom here is nice; a lot nicer than I was expecting.  :-)\n\nIf you're in the area, I would check this place out.

When you go the next time, try the Mushroom Soup w/ Pork Dumpling (hsiang gu rou geng), or the Taiwanese Bamboo Wrap (rou tsong), or the udong noodle, or the soymilk, which is absolutely delicious & housemade/homemade.

The waitress, who has been the same person both times, is really sweet and attentive. Maybe it helps that I can speak Mandarin, but my brother (who doesn't speak that dialect of Chinese) can speak with her just fine in English. This waitress knew Taiwanese, so I don't know what some people are saying about the staff not being true Taiwanese. \n\nI think my two favorite things here are the niu rou mian (the beef noodle soup) and the cong you bing (scallion pancake). The scallion pancake is quite different from any other one that I've ever had, and I can't really vouch for \"authenticity\" since I've never been to Taiwan. The beef noodle soup that I had shared twice was super yummy -- a semi-spicy,  beefy broth with al dente noodles and a generous portion of beef. I also liked the pork chop over rice here. \n\nFor things I didn't like so much, the ou ah jian (oyster omelette) was pretty bad, almost scary, so I wouldn't recommend that. My party also had the chicken wings the second time we came here, and they're pretty underwhelming. \n\nA lot of people complain here that the food is pricier than what Taiwanese food \"should be sold at.\" Frankly, we're not in Taiwan, so you shouldn't expect to find this type of food or any type of food as cheap as it is back there. The cost of living isn't the same. \n\n I'm definitely coming back here when I come home. Yum, beef noodle soup and pork chop!", "author": "Yvonne W."}

For a moment I thought I had ordered a soup, but based on context clues (the patrons who had, in fact, ordered soup had the trademark soup spoons while I did not) I realized that this was not true.

I have been looking all over the city for Taiwanese potstickers and this place has them!  Ok this place isn't the easiest to find.  The only reason I lucked out in finding this place was because AK Subs was a block away!  The parking situation is hellish day and night... the best time to come for dinner is around 7:45pm to snag at the VIP Bus Stop parking spaces.  Ok enough with the foreplay..\n\nI walked in with a party of 4 and was greated nicely by the hostess.  We were seated in the spacious 2nd floor almost immediately after we passed the doors.  We were seated near the windows, which have a nice view of Clement and our cars.  We were offered water and tea and also a menu each.  As we sat down, I noticed the seats were very nice and the table was very sturdy.. not like the ones you find at other Chinese restaurants that seem like motorized bulls.

I started with the Honey Green Tea drink(mmMm)  The scallion pancakes(OMG GOOD), the legendary Taiwanese potstickers, the crispy fried TOFU!, and the Savory Rice Roll! just blew me away!!  I mean everything I had on that day was super delicious!  And I was for sure that I wasn't being lulled away by Jay Chou singing on the flat panel TV screen.  The food was really really good.  The only thing to remember is although the price range is moderate $11-30... its very easy to fall within the high $20s/per person on this bill.  Everyone working here was very friendly, the owner even came up to serve us Taiwanese Pork Ball Soup!  She chatted with us about how the service was and how the food was.

I'm not sure of any other joints that serve this product, except for the late and great \"Star Lunch\" which shut down.  There are also a handful of dishes that stand out.

Most of the stuff was good at best, and there wasn't anything exceptional.\n\nService lacks here, and prices you pay will dent your wallet.  This is overly priced Chinese food.  With the price you pay, you'd expect better service and bigger portions of food.  It's sad that you pay 7 bucks for 4 small chicken wings.  The accompanying dip is good, but hey, its just 4 dinky wings.  On top of that, the chicken isn't like organic or steroid free.  So what justifies the high price dishes? The service isn't high-end or professional, and the seating experience isn't armed tablecloth.   You can get the same quality tasting food in just about 3 other handfuls Chinese restaurants in the city. The Potsticker in Chinatown is one to name.\n\nI know, Taiwanese, and Pekingese dishes are different.  But really, its all identical dishes but finished differently with each Chef's style and touch.

Way, way, way too sweet, we hardly touched this dish.\nLove that they have stinky tofu, especially the fried kind; not too stinky, it's pretty good but a tad dry, and lacked the creaminess I usually associate with fried stinky tofu. Still, if hankering for a little bit of that smelly-first-date-dispelling tofu, Taste of Formosa has a decent example.\nAll together, for lunch for two our bill came out to $34 and included two cold plates (cucumber and pickled pig ears; pig ears I would def get again!), two starters (the green onion pancake and stinky tofu), and one entree (the beef noodle soup, actually really good, but totally different from my connotation with traditional Taiwanese beef noodle soup... I detected satay, and some other more savory flavors, yumm).\nAll in all, would come again, especially to try their hot pot, but at $34 for two it is a little bit pricey for my expectations. I guess they make it up with very fancy (in comparison to most local Taiwanese eateries) presentation, but still. As such, there's room to explore and definite negatives to check off, so Taste of Formosa is currently a humble \"A-OK\" 3.", "author": "Jessica L."}

I travelled to Taiwan for the first time last New Year's and I fell in love with the cuisine.  The aromas and freshness of the food mixed with the excitement of the night markets was a truly unforgettable experience.  I've been longing for grilled cuttlefish and stinky tofu ever since my trip.  I'm so glad I discovered this place.  I came here for a bday dinner last week and my party ordered numerous small plates to share.  The braised meats were tender and delicious and seasoned just the way I remember it.  The stinky tofu was dynamite.  The salt and pepper whole prawns were humongous and amazingly tasty.

Since I already committed to Indian food, I couldn't change my mind. But if I had the chance to go back, I'd definitely go to Taste of Formosa instead. I came back two days later with my gf. We ordered the oyster vermicelli noodles and the braised beef noodle soup. I thought the oyster vermicelli noodle was done very well, very authentic whereas I've had better braised beef noodle soups at other Taiwanese restuarants in the South Bay. Don't get me wrong, the beef was tender but the broth was a bit too sweet and oily for my liking. The oyster noodle soup was the star of the meal (which was why my gf ate 3/4 of it and left me with the braised beef soup).\nThe decor was modern and chic but definitely doesn't reflect the streets of Taiwan- which is a good thing. We definitely will be going back in the near future...(this coming Friday).", "author": "Brian H."}

The beef noodle soup had a taste of tsa cha in it I think, which kind of makes it seem like they cut corners on the true taste of the beef broth to me.  The beef was just okay, and the noodles were a bit thicker than I usually like for beef noodle soup.  But the ambiance is really nice, and it almost feels out of place to eat Taiwanese food in a cute place like that.  Most of the good places I went to in Houston weren't so nicely decorated and cute.  But the green onion pie was delicious! It had a more buttery/pastry taste than I'm used to, but I love the layers and texture of the way it turned out.  I'd definitely go back for it.  The oyster pancake was probably the best I've had in a while, and it's been a couple of years since I've gone back to Taiwan so I can't quite pin point the taste of it there.  But the oysters were a lot smaller than ones used in places in Houston, which is truer to Taiwanese style, and the sauce was more similar as well. I'd like to go back and try more dishes too.", "author": "Jen T."}

There was a man eating solo at one table and someone from the kitchen making wontons at another table, I figured I could watch and learn. Tea was plentiful, food came out steadily, we were pretty satisfied. Food wasn't the best we've ever tasted but definitely was hitting the taiwanese craving I had... then it went downhill from there. I saw who I believe to be the owner sit down at the table with the wonton maker and start chit chatting. She then stuck her finger into her shoe to scratch an itch at the bottom of her foot, she dug around for a few more seconds and that was that. The thought that IMMEDIATELY pops into my head is I hope she doesn't start making wontons.... AND SHE DOES!!! Right then, right there my appetite is lost. Everything that has just been consumed starts to rumble in my stomach and I feel sick. That is just beyond not okay. I get that restaurant staff don't do these things intentionally or maliciously but really though! I will not be coming back here to eat, I suggest people that still insist on eating here, stay away from the wontons!", "author": "G Y."}

The menu is overwhelming, too many things and not described very well either. We had the pig ears and I thought they were cut a little too thick for my taste. not much flavor to it either. My bf ordered several types of dumplings, but they all tasted the same. We actually wanted shainghai dumplings and asked if they had any on the menu, the waitress pointed to something she thought was similar, but they were not even close. I thought the waitress could of mentioned that the dumplings we ordered were similar and that we should order something else. Potstickers were nothing to brag about. I thought that most of the little dishes that we ordered were rather greasy, not sure if that is how Taiwanese food is. The service is slow, the waitress is too soft spoken, I could barely hear her and she just wasn't up on it. Took her time bringing the dishes and it wasn't even busy. Not sure if I would come here again.... if I do maybe I need to bring a someone that knows how to order Taiwanese food.", "author": "carebear l."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-03-10", "description": "Being Taiwanese, this place doesn't really compare to my mom's home cooking at all. The staff doesn't speak Taiwanese or know the Taiwanese names to the dishes. They only speak Mandarin which makes me feel like the place isn't authentic. They put too much care into the presentation of the food (which is not a very taiwanese thing to do) and not enough into the actual dishes. The noodles were bland, the service was terrible, and my favorite Taiwanese dish - the staple of groud pork over rice was just okay. Would not come back.", "author": "foodbot c."}

I know most dim sum is with meat, however i knocked off a star because I wish they had vegetarian congee or vegetarian turnip cake!

If it wasn't for being dragged along by two eager friends, I probably would've opted for something in Chinatown.  But I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because of the quality of the food.  All the dishes we had especially the oyster omelet were amazing and comparable to the cuisine in Taipei.  Although it was barely populated, I didn't get that weird \"We're the only customers here\" feeling.  I recommend getting the oyster omelet.", "author": "R C."}

My roommate and I (both Taiwanese) come here sooooo often because it is so close and tasty. Have Taiwanese family/friends visiting SF? TAKE THEM HERE! They have all the classic dishes; 3 cup chicken, beef noodle soup, green onion pancake, and much more (which I can't remember because I'm an ABC). Prices are pretty cheap too. They have a huge clean nicely decorated dining area upstairs. You can't go wrong with this place!", "author": "M. W."}
