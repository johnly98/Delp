I don't normally order grilled chicken but I decided to order it here since they actually have a real grill. It was amazing! The outside was nice and crispy and the inside of the chicken was juicy and tender. They have an amazing salsa bar that is kept sanitary and filled with delicious homemade salsa. \nMy husband ordered the super Al Pastor nachos and I was drooling over those.

My favorites so far have definitely been the grilled chicken and carnitas. The carne asada was also good, but just didn't stand out relative to all the other Mexican restaurants. The grilled chicken had a great flavor and a great grilled texture on the outside. The carnitas were also a bit crispy, and not just soft and soggy, which I prefer. Having crispy carnitas can often leave them tasting dry, but that wasn't the case at all here. \n\nThe burritos are huge! The prices are a bit higher than what I'm used to for a burrito, but the size and amount of meat comes close to justifying the price. I also liked the use of avocado slices in the burritos, as opposed to guacamole. \n\nThe service is very quick and it doesn't take long to get your food, even when busy. The horchata here is also good, although a bit sweeter than I'd personally like, but most of them are.\n\nI will say I was a bit disappointed with the salsa bar. I'm not sure if it was just a fluke when I went, but there were really only three options when I went: red (tomato), green (tomatillo) and habanero. The red and green salsas were not spicy at all, but the habanero salsa was quite spicy, and I have a very high tolerance. I would have liked to see more variety of salsas.", "author": "Eric U."}

El Faros at 24th and Mission will always be my #1 for carne asada super quesadilla but I have to say Guads holds a close second for their carne asada and shrimp super quesadilla. Included inside are grilled onions and green bell peppers that give it that extra punch of flavors. \n\nAnother amazing feature of Guads is the Habanero salsa. It is quite spicy for a person who doesn't eat spicy food but just right for a regular salsa eater. The sourness gives it a great taste and creates a new addiction. \n\nGuads is a great option if you're in the area for late night eats, especially, after a night of good drinking. Be prepared for a line but the wait is not very long at all. Fast and efficient service but don't EVER bring outside drinks especially alcoholic drinks. Your ass will get kicked tfo, especially, if the security guard is present. He got eagle eyes!\n\nAnd for all you people who are looking to feel healthier, there is a spinach tortilla option.

They were $3.25 each, which is a bit overpriced since the tacos weren't even that good. The tortilla was dry and their salsa bar lacks variety. Being a taco enthusiast, I've had tacos elsewhere for less but wayyyy better. They don't give you chips, you have to ask for them. Their customer service is pretty much nonexistent, instead, they'll call you out for things like getting \"too much\" at the salsa bar, or bringing in your own drink. My boyfriend and I brought one coconut water inside to share and the lady at the register called us out for \"using their cups\".

To be honest, I usually go across the street to El Farolito. So finally I got to try it on a recent trip back home to San Francisco. I'm not leaving town without having a burrito from the Mission before I leave. That's just a fact... We found parking on the street. It was late Sunday night but Taqueria Guadalajara was jammin. There was a short line to order but there were many people waiting for their take-out orders and the dining room was pretty busy as well. I was surprised at such a late hour (after 10pm) on a Sunday that it would be that busy still. \n\nI went with a carne asada super burrito ($9.60) and as per my usual, no cilantro. The burrito was huge and expertly wrapped as I expect of all Mission burritos. The meat was tasty, the rice was good, the beans, sour cream, cheese, onions and avocados all combine to make a tasty burrito only San Franciscans can claim. It was very good. My only complaint would be that I need more cheese and sour cream. Mine didn't have enough. Other than that. I was full from the burrito and forced myself to finish it. I also split an al pastor super taco and that was very tasty. It was packed with meat, sour cream, onions and avocado. You can hardly fold it over. There was so much meat inside this one taco. I could do without the extra fatty cuts but I just didnt eat those pieces. \n\nTaqueria Gudalajara came highly recommended and didnt disappoint. Enjoyed my super taco and super burrito very much.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-15", "description": "If you are in San Francisco and craving Mexican food (particularly tacos, burritos, or quesadillas), you are truly, truly blessed. Because the city, specifically San Francisco's Mission Street, is a gold mine for one of the best Taquerias in the Bay Area. On many people's lists, you will find three different places that sell \"life-changing\" food: El Farolito, La Taqueria, and Taqueria Guadalajara. \n\nDue to all the hype, I've actually had El Farolito more times than I can remember; I can honestly say that their Super Quesadilla (Suiza), in combination with their green sauce, is one of the most amazing things you will ever have in your life. To this day, I haven't found a place that does it better. And La Taqueria, has there ever been a place that's attracted SO MANY PEOPLE? According to like everyone, including myself, this place truly does have THE best, if not one of the best carne asada burritos (https://fivethirtyeight.com/burrito/#brackets-view).\n\nBut Taqueria Guadalajara, the third of the trio, I haven't had the chance you eat you up yet...until recently when my girlfriend totally read my mind and decided that we were going to come here! In San Francisco, there are at least two Taqueria Guadalajaras, both ironically on Mission Street. We ended up going to the more popular one in Excelsior as it was closer to us.\n\nThis Taqueria Guadalajara is located right in between Russia and France Avenue on 4798 Mission Street. If you think the names of the streets are awesome, check out what's right across from Guadalajara: El Farolito! That's definitely bold on either end to have your main competitor RIGHT next to you. For parking, traffic may be so-so depending on when you come. We drove in around 12pm on a Sunday and we were able to find a spot on the street after circling once. Unfortunately, you probably will have to pay for parking, but it shouldn't be more than $2 for an hour. I do recommend coming earlier because the place does get packed. We had to wait when we got in, BUT there's plenty of tables so MAJOR PLUS compared to El Farolito at certain times (especially the 16th and Mission one).\n\nIn terms of the menu, Taqueria Guadalajara is your standard Mexican restaurant. This place will have several different options for burritos, tacos, and your favorite quesadillas. Their meats are also standard, with your steak, tripe, etc. They also have horchata too if you are into that. Their pricing is pretty competitive with others. For example, it's like about $10 for a super burrito/quesadilla which is probably what I remembered paying at La Taqueria/El Farolito. My girlfriend and I ended up getting a medium horchata, a super quesadilla, and a super burrito (both with steak). Food came out pretty fast, and here's what we thought...\n\n-Super Quesadilla (8/10). When eating the Super Suiza, I unfortunately already had a preconceived idea that El Farolito's version would be unmatched. However, I actually thought that Gaudalajara's was REALLY GOOD. The steak was cooked extremely well, the quality of the other ingredients were great, and I loved that you do get a large amount of cream cheese. The only real downsides (compared to El Farolito) was that the quesadilla could have had a bit more crunch + this place really needed better side-sauces to boost the appeal of the Suiza. For example, the basic tomato salsa was pretty poor quality (I wouldn't touch this), and they didn't have the green tomatillo sauce!!! However, I would never mind getting this again. In regards to the Super Burrito, my girlfriend loved it as well.\n\n-Horchata (7/10). This place serves your standard horchata. There's nothing really special about it, but it did the trick. It was sweet and served cold!\n\nOverall, would I say that Taqueria Guadalajara reins supreme? Nope, I'm slightly (over) loyal to El Farolito. However, I really enjoyed my experience here. The service was GREAT, there's lots of room to eat even though the place is small/there's a steady line of people, and the food was pretty delicious. I have to give this place an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating. Next step, Taqueria Cancun! \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

I've had a slight craving for nachos every day since the fateful night that my stomach met their al pastor super nachos.\n\n$10 can get you far here, such as to this delicious plate. You should know that their chips are standard, but the interplay of cheese, pineapple-infused al pastor, avocado, sour cream, and pico de gallo is absolutely phenomenal. The cheese and al pastor get a double thumbs-up from me, actually. Since everything is served at the temperature of lava, the cheese remains gooey throughout, even after it's cooled down substantially. Guadalajara makes their al pastor fresh, and serve it to you with diced pineapple. The pineapple cuts nicely into the savory and spicy (if you opt for their habanero salsa). Unfortunately, the chips are a little too weak to hold up every time. I had a few instances where the contents piled on the chip made their way to the table instead of my mouth.\n\nI took a bite of a friend's gloppy al pastor quesadilla and wow. I'm coming straight back to try this next time. I'm not sure if I could let go of the nachos, but the quesadilla proved to be a serious contender.\n\nService is curt, so don't come here expecting the best. There's signs to remind you that the credit card minimum is $10, which explains why they'll be pissed if you whip out your AmEx for a bottle of Jarritos.\n\nCheck out the art while you're waiting!

What started out as a quick fix to a food craving turned in to more of a memorable experience. With a branch of El Farolito across the street I was torn. Upon entry the restaurant was full of people and the gold cup was being televised a couple of different TVs. \n\nOrdered a super burrito, taco, and horchata. Prices were average and a side of chips was automatically included (Was not expecting this). What caught me off guard was the salsa bar. It was full of a variety of different salads, ecabeche's and salsas. There was also a habanero salsa near the register. No surprise it was separate from the rest. Be careful! That salsa is spicy! The horchata was delicious. Tons of taqueria's easily screw up the horchata with to much milk or sugar. Not the case here. It was perfect.\n\nOverall, burrito was on point.

It is because Guadalajara is not known for its tacos.  The tacos are best where the meat is best, and the best meat comes from cows in Sonora or Chihuahua.  Anyhow...\n\nEnvironment:  Not too clean.  Salsa bar.  Table dirty and needed to be cleaned.  Water self serve.  Order at bar.  There can be a long line during lunch time.  Pretty standard Mexican place except I do not like dirty tables.  3 stars.  \n\nFood:  Guadalajara and its state of Jalisco is more known for its seafood (with Puerto Vallarta in the same state), tortas ahogadas (not present), and a type of stew called \"carne en su jugo.\"  So I tried the camarones (al diablo y planchados) - grilled and spice.  Served with typical beans, rice, and corn tortillas with sliced avocado.  Wonderful.  I normally do not like shrimp so this was very good.  4.5 stars.\n\nService:  See environment.  Basically self serve so no worries about attendants.  Food came out fast.  5 stars.  \n\nOverall:  Get the seafood since we are in San Francisco.  I recommend for a lunch with a friend or three in a very casual place.  4 stars.", "author": "Eddie N."}

He proclaimed it was the only burrito in the city he couldn't finish in one sitting and to get the verde.\n\nNow I was aware of the place as I have to go to the Post Office on Onondaga twice a month. Wait... *runs down to get the mail and sees another missed you slip* Make that three times a month! The place is at the corner of one of the most delicious intersections on Mission, across the street an El Farrolito, a Hawaiian Drive Inn, and TY Sandwiches. Easily one of the hardest decisions to make. But my roommate got me hyped.\n\nYou walk into a place that looks like it could be at a Disney knockoff, with an interior that makes it look like you are actually in an exterior Mexican neighborhood with windows, lights, and paintings. I LOVE restaurants like this, or bars like Smuggler's Cove. That alone gives this place 3 stars. \n\nNow if picking this place out of the corner wasn't difficult, now comes the next hard part - figuring what to eat. Between giant burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and nachos, it's a difficult decision. This was my first time, and while a complete sucker for a super shrimp quesadilla, and my roommate raving about the burrito, I didn't know how their meat was. So I went for the easier option of 3 tacos - one cabeza, one carnitas, and one pastor.\n\nI got a basket of chips while I waited, and as others have mentioned these chips alone are some of the best. Thick and crispy, these aren't the thin greasy things you get at other taquerias. I should have gotten more. They also have a sauce and salsa bar. The verde is solid, the orange will kick your ass, and I think there was a red.\n\nOf the meats, the cabeza was the weakest. And I love cabeza. The carnitas was excellent, perfectly fried and tasty. But the pastor stole the show. Full of flavor, made with bits of pineapple, I have no problem knowing I'm getting a pastor burrito next time I come. I even tried to scoop as much sauce with my chips as possible. I am glad I saved this taco for last. I also had a tamarind jarritos to wash it all down. Que Delicioso!\n\nAffordable, quick, great interior, nice staff, and delicious food. I know I'm walking to the post office tomorrow, but I have no idea what to eat.", "author": "Michael C."}

This salsa has a slurpy viscosity, neither too diluted with onion/vegetable juices nor too chunked with avocado bits. The salsa harmonizes the wonderful taste of tangy lime with undertones of spice. \n\nTIP: One thing to note is that shrimp is priced higher than other meats. The description for a  burrito/quesadilla reads  \"choice meat\" or \"choice of meat\", and since shrimp falls underneath the choice of meats, by the substitution principle, shrimp items should cost the same as their meaty cousins.

I found it quite ordinary, with my meal lacking in the revelation of flavor and goodness that other esteemed reviewers report. The cashier was impatient with the steely stare of a Coyote (maybe .... since I asked a question ?). While maybe efficient for the quick production and sale of Taqueria fare, it was a \"hurry up and cross the border\" moment. I understand that the cashier is legendary having put the Burrrr in Burrito, yes, Martha the look was frosty. Seems that the namesake city of Guadalajara has no representations among their offerings.  For example not present are Birria or my personal favorite Tortas ahogadas of this capital of Jalisco. Maybe a dart was thrown at a map of Mexico to determine the joints name. \n\nThe taco's were disappointing, especially considering that  Taqueria is a derivative of Mexico's national foodstuff. My dining mate had a burrito, which was reported as ho-hum, and sub par. There are many dedicated fans of this joint 4 & 5 Star glowing, some with an evangelical testament to the mysteries and divine stature of their fare. There are also a number of folks that report much less than burrito enlightenment. \n\nGiving 2 STARS, I feel guilt pangs to offer a \"maybe it was an off day\" or \"maybe our bad meal was an unfortunate exception\", I am less inclined to offer this polite and apologetic allowance and justification since there are too many places in SF to choose from and who consistently deliver great taqueria goods. This joint mainly offer's the opportunity and necessity for the lowering of expectations such that hopes for a tasty meal and nice service can be met. \n\nGuadalajara is a great/large/fascinating Mexican city with a deep and varied Mexican cuisine, with some dishes specific to Guadalajara.

I used to order the carne asada tacos every time, which are simple but awesome because their salsa and cilantro are fresh and the meat is cooked perfectly, but now I switch off between both the carne asada and grilled chicken super burritos. If I had it my way I'd order the carne asada burrito every.single.time, but me and my other half usually split them so I'm nice and trade off ;-).  And yes, we split them, which means the super burritos are huge!!! What I love about this place is that they use straight avocado instead of guacamole and the rice is awesome. I also feel like all of the ingredients are perfectly balanced and I never get stuck with a mouthful of just one thing, except maybe the meat which is fine with me.\n\nThe service is always fast even when they are super busy, which is awesome. Of all the times I've been here I think they've messed up my order once, and all they did was accidentally give me regular chicken instead of grilled. NBD. And the burrito was a little sloppy, which is unusual for them, so maybe they were training a new cook or something.\n\nAnyway, the lady who usually takes orders is a little cold, but I think it's just because she suffers from resting bitch face. She's not actually mean or anything. I suffer from this condition as well, but don't be put off by it. Our faces just look bitchy when we don't smile; it's not our fault!!!! :-) Haha!\nSo if you're looking for an awesome burrito just come here. You won't regret it!", "author": "Steph L."}

The entrance, shared by tables and the customer line, is narrow, leaving scarce room for staff to get to the condiments area to clean or to monitor, and it's ALWAYS busy.\n\nBut, like I said the food's usually bangin' so I'll be back. \n\nAlso I've heard the decor, a painted 3D-ish \"Mexican villa,\" replete with balconies, is an actual place in Mexico, done by an artisan who lives/lived there. Take a photo.\n\nParking's bad. Don't even think about stopping for a sec in front of the ATT employee gate on Onondaga (our bag dropped on the floor of the car when we were enroute) or you'll get screamed at. I guess if I had to work for ATT I might be as rude. On second thought, if it's legal, DO park there. And if you see that screaming ATT lady tell her you got a memo from Robert F, saying it was ok! \n\nMy vote: 3-1/2 stars, entered as a \"3,\" based largely on the deteriorating inspection score.", "author": "Robert F."}

Just kidding, I devoured the entire thing in one sitting because I'm a man. \n\nBiting in, I noticed the tortilla was chewy and had good texture. I hate the ones that are too crisp'd up and charred or ones where they're so light it's like eating a spring roll. Not this one though, this was right on. Inside of it, you'll get a wonderful blend of beans, rice, avocado, and your choice of meat. I went with classic carne asada and was thoroughly happy with my decision.  Steak was good, they slice it up in bite size pieces instead of the cubed ones I've had before. This made a difference in soaking up the other flavors IMO. \n\nGuess what else? They give you chips and salsa! Chips were probably some of the best I've had. I believe they make it in house but don't quote me on it.

First of all, the ladies up front are friendly and know great customer service (high five to Fernanda!), so it's always a pleasure to walk in the door.  The food?  Awesome!  Really great, fresh, quality meats  -- and shrimp! -- REALLY good shrimp (and, as you may well know, not all shrimp that places serve is good).  This may not matter to a number of people reading this, but it will resonate with some when I say that I do not like dark chicken meat and it seems, of the majority of taquerias in town, that is all they serve OR they do serve white meat (i.e., chicken breast), but it is the grilled kind and frequently all dried out.  At Guadalajara, yes, you can get dark chicken meat, which is their Pollo Asado -- but they also have something called Pollo Cocido, which is huge chunks of fresh chicken breast stewed in a delicious sauce, and it is awesome!   To top it off, every single day they make fresh aguas frescas -- always horchata and cantaloupe -- and I mean from really fresh melons! -- and massive selection of beers, Mexican soft drinks, and regular sodas, and they also offer fresh-squeezed orange juice!  So, ok, if there is one thing I'm not in love with it's their chips -- too thick and greasy for me.   Instead of using the same corn tortillas they use for their tacos, I wish they could source another tortilla supplier who can make them really thin or, at least, thinner.  But their salsas are terrific.  Oh, one other wonderful thing:  they are open to 4am -- yes, 4AM -- on Fri/Sat, and 1am on other days, except I think Midnight on Sundays.   The times listed above, which all end at 1am, are not correct (owners: please correct!).  They also have a location on 24th Street near Mission or South Van Ness, just as good, just as friendly staff, so they definitely got a good thing going.

Like, they've been sitting there a few hours soggy. Like they've returned to their original state and are useless for transporting toppings to your mouth. The distribution was sloppy; some nachos had all avocado, some all meat. It was sloppy and poorly done. Meager amounts of everything except chicken. They didn't care. \n\nFor the burrito, I asked for no salsa or pica de gallo or onion cilantro mix, and there was some in there anyway.

Due to the river of juices flowing incessantly from the bottom of the tortilla, I was unable to salvage any sort of cylindrical shape. Not a problem. I demolished the burrito, butt end smashed into the table, both hands and a tiny strip of foil wrapped around the blob, which was now soaked through in creamy sauce. \n\nAfter i'd finished-- maybe 3 whole minutes and 36 napkins later-- I realized I'd just experienced something magical and now it was over. I sat back in my giant leather chair and sucked my teeth (a bad habit passed down from my father).

Its a great local Mexican restaurant to go to get burritos, tacos, quesadillas and other food that they offer. \n\nI had the regular burrito with grilled chicken. Even though regular burrito has fewer ingredients than the super burrito, it can still get you full since this place give you a lot of meat, rice, and other ingredients in regular burrito. They usually give you chips whenever you order any kind of burritos.\n\nI also had the super quesadilla suizo with chicken. It's quite big. It has big as the super burrito but more flatter. When you take it to go, you a get a quesadilla that has been cut in half. The super quesadilla can get you really full as well since they put a lot of meat, rices, avocado, and other ingredients. I like that they actually use fresh pieces of avocado rather than the guacamole style. This doesn't come with burrito.\n\nYou can pick your own salsas, since there's more than one, that you want to go with your burritos, quesadillas, and tacos. There's also a mango yellow sauce you can get also but this sauce is quite spiy but still good.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable as well. The workers here are friendly. \n\nOnly problem i have is just the parking especially if you come around lunch time since it can be hard to find parking during the afternoon and there's mostly parking meters", "author": "Julie N."}

As for your scaling for delicious burritos in SF, that might depend on your level of sobriety.... meheh! \n\nMy usual go-to is the EL PASTOR super burrito/quesadilla! It comes with a heaping scoop of sour cream, sliced avocados, rice & beans (optional). My favorite thing about ordering el pastor is that occasionally, you'll get pieces of diced pineapples with it, and that's quite a pleasant surprise. You also get the all the juices that drip from the el pastor, so there is a lot happening in your burrito. \n\nThe salsa bar is pretty on point too, as they have a pretty good selection of sauces to choose from. But, they have the BEST green sauce I've ever had. It's a great level of spiciness, with a balance creaminess to it as well. You can literally put that ish on everything!\n\nIt's a great place to grab a quick bite, but it tends to get packed during dinner times, and after club hours. Their staff is really nice, and they're trying as hard as they can to accommodate everyone at a fast pace. Just be respectful of how hard they're working, and don't complain if your burrito takes 5 extra minutes.", "author": "Krystal O."}

This honestly didn't give me an opinion on which is better. So without trying either before, I went into El Farolitos bought 1 carnitas super burrito with everything and 1 ceviche. Then walked to Guadalajara and bought the same thing except with a steak burrito instead. I also got nachos from Guadalajara because there was consensus that the nachos here were better. \n\nWhen I got home I put the burritos next to each other to see which was bigger. El Farolitos is about an inch longer and both were about the width (insert penis joke here). \n\nI cut both in half and El Farolitos burrito was definitely more juicy because I think they add more cheese or something. However, Guadalajara's burrito had large chunks of   avocado and the steak was really flavorful and delicious. If I had to choose which was better, I have to choose El Farolitos however but Guadalajara is definitely a very very close second. \n\nNext is the ceviche. I have to say that Guadalajara absolutely destroys El Farolitos. Guadalajara's was really fresh and the shrimp and fish were crunchy and not fishy tasting at all. The El Farolitos was soft and tasted old and fishy. \n\nThe Nacho's at Guadalahara was also really good. I got chicken on it just so I could have all three types of meat. Guadalahara really knows how to cook their chicken and steak. Super delicious. I kind of wish they offered the crappy nacho cheese however because it makes the chips a lot easier to eat but i guess that doesn't make the nachos authentic then. \n\nFinally, a review of the salsa bar. Both salsa's were delicious but Guadalajara had much more variety. They also had this orange habanero salsa that was ridiculously spicy. My sister loved it but I just dipped the corner of a chip into the salsa and started coughing. \n\nOverall, you can't go wrong with either taqueria. Both are high quality and you would never regret going to one over the other. Both burritos were one of the top I've ever had. It all depends which type you like. More avocados and guacamole = guadalajara and more sauce and more cheese = El Farolitos. Ceviche, is clearly won by guadalajara. Finally service at both was really good. The guy at El Farolitos didn't talk to me as much but the lady at Guadalajara was really nice and tried to explain what certain things on the menu was. Two great Taquerias, can't miss out on either.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

If you've managed to get my order WRONG 3 times in a row, you don't deserve my business. \n\nThe first two times, my friends and I came to Taqueria Guadalajara inebriated after a night of clubbing. I ordered a Super Lengua Burrito w/ NO Sour Cream. Both times, when I bit into it, I was welcomed with a mouthful of sour cream. It looked like someone creamed in my mouth. Gross. Umm, that didn't come out right. :X Aside from that, the meat to rice was off with a majority being rice. The lengua was tender but a little chewy (properly cooked lengua should be soft). In short, it was like eating a sour cream, avocado cream, and rice burrito. At the time, I was drunk, hungry, and obviously didn't care.\n\nLet's just say, the after effects was like a scene out of  \"Along Came Polly\" when Ben Stiller ate Moroccan food. NO BEUNO. I thought maybe I didn't make myself clear when ordering so I decided to give Taqueria Guadalajara another chance.\n\nThis time, I came after work (sober of course) and ordered a Regular Tripas & Lengua Burrito w/ Avocado. Though the regular burrito comes with no sour cream, I told the cashier no sour cream just in case. I repeated my order again to ensure the cashier noted no sour cream. \n\nWhen I got home and cut into the burrito, what do ya know, there was...SOUR CREAM AGAIN! Oh yah and instead of tripas, they gave me carnitas which had burnt-to-a-char edges. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1dwJK21zm7cuhUKdROWJXQ?select=VUtcUqCk46qTndset4XnWQ At least my dog had a tasty dinner that night.\n\nI'm lactose intolerant and have to avoid certain dairy items with sour cream being one of them.

This is  my go-to spot, conveniently located at Mission and Onondaga in the excelsior/outer mission area. I love their hours of operation. I can go before I go to work, or after some late night drinking- they are open! The food and decor in there has changed a bit over the years, but I always love their salsas. Mmmm. Soo good.  Some people like the spot across the street, but 9/10 times, I end up in Guadalajara.\n\n......\nUpdate:\nMore recently I've noticed the quality of food and service go down. They messed up on my order and gave me regular burritos instead of the super burritos I paid for. A couple of the ladies that work there are really nice, but one of them really would rather watch her novellas on the tv behind my head at the register than to look at me or communicate what's happening with my order...awkward.", "author": "Michelle V."}

Now I only come to this taqueria when I am in the neighborhood. I LOVE THAT THEIR SUPER BURRITOS COME WITH AVOCADO!! Normally when I get a burrito, I always ask for avo instead of guac. The burritos here are so good! They toast the tortilla a bit so it adds a nice little crisp to it and the avo adds a little extra texture to the burrito. The pollo asado is juicy. I haven't tried any of their dishes but they always look and smell good. Also, the salsas they have are a really good addition to the burrito. I get the red and habanero sauces which are bomb as hell (to me at least). I do recommend trying the habanero if you are not afraid of the heat.

The burrito was a little too heavy on sour cream so definitely ask for little to no on your order if you like sour cream too much. Also love the salsa bar!

I can't eat a burrito in another city and think it's decent. Maybe if I try Mexico. That said, this is the best of the best, imho. I ate a vegetarian burrito (which had about an entire avocado inside!!!) and enjoyed it so much I couldn't stop eating it. I ate the whole gigantic thing. It was probably 3 days worth of calories but it was so worth it. They grilled the veggies inside and grilled the burrito shell. Also there is a hot habanero-lime salsa that they have which is addictive. Screw the 5 stars, this place gets 6. Maybe 7. Or 8....", "author": "Jon O."}

It hits before the weekends but only after hungover Mondays, yep, I'm taking about the long held traditions of Taco Tuesdays! \n\nThere's just something about devouring a taco on Tuesday that makes it more satisfying and delicious. Maybe because after all the binge consumption of alcohol over Saturday and even Sundays (for you alcoholics out there), Pho is best preferred on Mondays (it is the perfect hangover cure after all), so Taco Monday is a no-go. And Wednesday is obviously Hump Day. Who wants to hump with tacos in their belly? Your just asking for trouble. Thursdays.. yeah well, your prepin' for Friday, homie, and you ain't fitting in no skinny jeans or cocktail dress with all that sour cream in ya, grrrrl (best to bust out them spandex). Anyways, where was I? So, in my conclusion.. this taqueria has too many A's in their name!\n\nYour regular tacos at TG (not even going to attempt typing Guada--) go for $2.40, which includes your choice of meat, onions, cilantro, and hot sauce. You can also opt for the super if you feel like putting on some calories for $3.25, which is additionally topped off with cheese, avocado, and sour cream. \n\nChorizo Steak - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1dwJK21zm7cuhUKdROWJXQ?select=VvKMZRd4awYl-u3MZdYabA\n\nGrilled Chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1dwJK21zm7cuhUKdROWJXQ?userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\n\nRegular Chicken - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1dwJK21zm7cuhUKdROWJXQ?select=bWJDvPtNUK3LG5iLIw0hUw\n\nBeef Tripe - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1dwJK21zm7cuhUKdROWJXQ?select=EqDUelzCMwKRbTagoKL51A\n\nCarnitas and Shrimp are also available.\n\nThe Tacos at TG are legit.\nAll the meats are cooked-to-order (you won't see none of that pre-cooked stuff that's been laying about like some low grade buffet) *cough-Gordo's-cough* and they're not skimpy with the meats either. Each tortilla is slightly toasted and warm, and if you opt for the super, they go HEAVY on the avocado and cream! (you've been warned). TG also has an impressive salsa bar, with three different kinds of salsas, pickled jalapenos, pico ge gio, etc to go with the complimentary chips too. \n\nAll-in-all, one successful Taco Tuesday! but now I gotta pay for opting for the super tacos at the gym.. \"it's [almost] Friday, Friday --\"", "author": "Albert L."}

First of all what makes this place amazing is the awesome salsa bar. the green sauce is BOMB.COM, the pickled carrots & red onions have the right amount of spice to it that tastes good with either the burrito or nachos, the salsa is of course also good AND last but not least they have the most spiciest habanero sauce which I cannot find anywhere else except here. Now onto the food. \n\nBurrito: I really like the burritos here because the flavor is is just amazing and when you bite into the burrito you actually get the right amount of juice in your mouth from the meat. Another thing is that you won't find huge amounts of oil in your mouth or dripping out of your burrito which is a plus, that just makes you lose your appetite. \n\nNachos: I don't know what it is about their nachos but it is sooooo addictive. I love how they are super generous with their meat. The plate is LITERALLY covered with meat, when you're done with your plate you'll run out of chips but you'll still have more meat!!! you literally get more than what you pay for. Plus, it's great drunk food also. \n\nTotally great spot for drunk food and food for when you're sober. Make sure to try the food with the pickled carrots & red onions. If you're feeling adventurous and spicy you should definitely try the habanero sauce. You'll definitely be sweating but it is soooooo good.", "author": "Kimberly D."}

I took to my Yelp app and looked what was highly rated and still open, as it was getting near 1am. My friend suggested a nearby taqueria that is open to 3am, but we decided we'd try something new.\n\nTaqueria Guadalajara is conveniently located on a corner of Mission Street between Leo Street and Russia Ave. The taqeria has a bright and over-sized neon sign proudly displaying its name. The taqueria has a small dining area and displays its menu right behind the register and kitchen area.\n\nThe menu has all your standard Mexican fare, including: dinner plates, burriots, tortas, and tacos. As a Mexican-American, I have authentic Mexican at home on a daily basis, so I'm a tough critic at taquerias. My usual taste test consists of trying a variety of tacos or a taco-dinner plate. I went with three regular tacos: a carne asada, a pollo asado, and al pastor. The total came to less than $9 with my diet coke. I forked over the cash and was given chips and directed to the salsa bar.\n\nThe salsa bar has a bit of selection with four or five fresh salsas, as well as fresh cilantro, limes, jalapenos, etc. I tried a few of the salsas, but fell in love with one in particular. Moments later my tacos were brought to my table and they looked great, as they didn't appear greasy and the meat looked of high-quality while portion size was just right.\n\nI took my first few bites and the food was delicious and rivaled that of a Mexican backyard party. The carne was tender, juicy, and flavorful, most notably the carne asada and al pastor. Each tacos was topped with cilantro and their house salsa, whch added flavor but didn't overpower the taco overall. If I had to choose which was best of the three, I'd have to say the carne asada was my favorite, but you can't go wrong with any of the three.\n\nAlthough the taqueria is rather small, it does boasts a lively dining area with murals, making it a \"romatic\" eatery as per the SF State paper. You can't go wrong with the authentic Mission Mexican food of Taqueria Guadalajara, whether taking out or dining in and enjoying a Spanish novela on their 25\" tube tv.\n\nAmbiance: 3 Stars (out of 5)\nFood: 4 Stars (out of 5)\nService: 4 Stars (out of 5)\nPrice: $\nOverall: 4 Stars (out of 5)", "author": "Alexander E."}

My first impression was that it was a little pricy for the burritos, but when I saw the actual portion sizes, WOW! The burritos were really big and stuffed full of goodness. I ordered the super langua burrito as well as the shrimp burrito and carne asada super quesadila. Out of the three, my favorite was the langua, tender beef tongue encased within a soft spinach tortilla. The rogue melted in my mouth and had a great flavor and texture. I would definitely come back just of tongue. On the other hand the shrimp and carne asada were both good, but not as impressive. If you come here, supersize your order because its not the same without all the stuffings. It was a pretty fast take out  especially with the long lines. The free chips and salsa bar are also a definite plus!", "author": "Jessica E."}

I also ordered chips, these were fantastic and the best part of my meal by far. The green salsa is great, chunky prices of avocado with a nice little spice kick to it. Now for the burrito. The size and price were good, same as most of my go to spots in the mission, I tend to avoid the carne asada and I have usually had very fatty meats the couple times I have tried it but all my buddies said the carne asada was the best so I went with it and what do you know, tons of fat, I had to pick out a decent amount of the meat and that already threw off my appetite. The ratio for rice compared to everything else was also not good, definitely over did it to make it larger. On top of that there was a huge bug on the wall right in front of where I was eating that I noticed halfway through my meal, it just didn't help out my experience.

I really enjoy the quality of the food. The employees are nice the prices are resonable. They are fast and efficient!\n\nWhen ordering nachos or burritos I recommend getting the pollo cocido (boiled chicken). It's truly the best of their chicken selection. Carne asada comes in second. \n\nThe decor is kinda cool. (Its been remodeled within the past 3 or 4 years) Makes you feel like you're in old Mexico. \n\nThe only complaint I have is that it is always crowded when I go regardless of the time.

They are generous with avocado and sour cream portions on all the super tacos, which I appreciate. \n\nMy qualm is with the quality of the meat and the salsa. The al pastor was virtually unchewable rubber when I recently got it. I had it a couple months ago in a burrito and it was softer but very fatty, so also a turn off. The pico de gallo is very watery and flavorless, and the other salsas taste like they are from a can. \n\nAlso, the service is very slow and sometimes rude. So be prepared to sit after you order. The decor is really cute and they usually have telemundo or telenovelas on if you want some melodramatic entertainment while you wait.", "author": "Katie D."}

Don Chuy's doesn't even come close, and, I ain't eating a goddamn Salvadorean burrito again, unless it has some STROOOONG recommendations to back it up. Fact is, this burrito is perfectly seasoned, is filling, has terrific salsa, and does their meat right, slightly seared and tender as fuck. If you are in the Excelsior and you are eating a non-Guadalajara burrito, you're wrong. Their quesadillas suiza are on point as well, and are far superior to that of Farolito's.

The quality of the salsa/condiment bar unparalleled for a taqueria in SF. $2.55 for one of these tacos is a screaming deal. \nNot a fancy restaurant but not dirty like many in the inner mission - the kitchen, prep area, and dining area are clean. The restroom was better than expected. These people care about the quality of their food. Think Tacolicious but at a quarter the price. Three tacos (Tripas, Pollo Asada, Lengua) were all the bomb with the Tripas being the best I've ever had - crunchy on the outside, tender in the middle, smoky from being quickly fried. Not at all greasy, not at all chewy. Highly recommended. If you like spicy, try a little of the habanero sauce next to the cash register, it will get your attention. The woman behind the counter was very pleasant and efficient. Because of the proximity to CCSF, I bet there are times when there are lines out the door but - that was not my experience today. This is my new favorite taco place. Taste, value, quantity all exceptional. The only improvement they could make would be the atmosphere/setting/design but hey, it's a taqueria not Gary Danko.

I can only speak for being served a Carne Asada Super Burrito 2345334 times, but here's the rundown: \n\n-a considerate amount of avocado\n-the meat is chopped well and not too oily/salty. I can't stand oily burritos.\n-well-cooked rice (Asian credibility) - if you're lucky, the cheese will do wonders with it\n-welcoming dining area and service\n-the line is generally mild\n-sometimes the salsa bar can be a war zone, but it's also a sign of a high turnover rate in a half-glass-full world\n\nFor something lighter, go Pollo Asado; it makes a big difference. Also the Super Quesadilla is very good, but other places like Farolito might be a better joint for that -- I haven't had it enough to be a fair judge.", "author": "Tam N."}

Aw man, I don't know how they do it, but their food is always so fresh and tasty. Finally bought my dad for a lunch date here and he was astounded by this place. He thought I was gonna take him to somewhere like Taco Bell. Really daddy? There's no comparison. \n\nI usually get the tacos de lengua. Super, of course. It's always so tender and delicious. Once in a while, I'll get the carne asada which has a nice smokey flavor to it. \n\nDad got the grilled chicken and carne asada and man was he impressed. It was also my first time getting the horchata cause I kept forgetting before. It was not too sweet and it was really good. \n\nI can't get over their salsa bar. I love their pico de gallo so much. I got my dad into it as well. He was basically sprinting back and forth between the tables and salsa bar. \n\nService isn't as bad as everyone says it is. Yes, the lady may look a little mean, but just speak clearly and maybe throw in a few Spanish words and she looks content. I asked her for a few refills of the chips because I love the salsa so much and she did it without glaring at me! To me, that is enough to say good service. \n\nAlso, I was worried about her scooping the chips and getting my cash, but I leaned over and saw that she had a napkin or something to grab the chips. That put me at ease. Ain't nobody tryna eat money tasting chips.", "author": "Jasmine W."}

Heck there's not much better on a cold, foggy day either!\n\nLike most restaurant on Mission, TG is small and has about 8 or 9 tables but it's clean and the ladies at the counter taking your order are always friendly. One of my fav things here is the cart where you can help yourself to various salsas, some of which are pretty spicy...yum!\n\nMost recently, we ordered their Super Nachos w/ carne asada. I like that their meats are lean and their food isn't dripping in oil. We've tried their burritos and quesadillas in the past and are all really good! \n\nThe only negative is the restaurant being on Mission, parking can be difficult to find.

I was introduced to this place by somebody I knew and after my first taste of this place and Mexican food in general,  I became deeply in love.  It's love,  I know it.  Mama, I'm in love with a criminal and his crime is being SO DAMN GOOD TO EAT (take that any way you want.. but just know I'm talking about food here).\n\nI first tried their Super Nachos with regular chicken.  FIRST OFF, HOLEEHAIL their portions are HUGE.  Second,  how can chicken be that tasty?!  And THIRD,  how can food be THAT GOOD?!?!\n\nI was on a Super Nacho high/dependency for quite a long time before I moved on to their Super Burrito.\n\nThe Super Burrito..  is like crack.  It's so good.  I don't know what else to say about it!  I eat it almost every week now because I'm just too ADDICTED.  I'm just so lucky that this place is 15 minutes walking distance away from my house so it's easily accessible for me to go.  But it can also be a bad thing because I always go because it's so close..  ANYWAYS,  the super burrito is HHUUGGEE.  Actually, that's an understatement.  It's HHHHUUUUGGGGEEEE!!  If you eat the entire thing in one sitting,  you will bloat up and constrict your lung's airways.  That's why you have to do what I do and split it into 2!  Half a super burrito is already a huge burrito that can last you a day so HEY you have the other half for the next day or maybe to share with somebody else..  ehh, do what you want with your burrito but I'm just saying..  IT'S HUGE.  AND DELICIOUS.  Incredibly delicious.\n\nMy father and I constantly go to this place now ever since we both found out that their super burrito is super GREAT.  It's like our bonding food outside of the food in our house.  I even talk to my dad all the time about being on a super burrito diet until I get completely sick and tired of it because I'm pretty sure I'm now an official addict.

Not saying El Faro is bad but Guadalajara has these small but distinct features that make me say I like them more than El Farolito. \n\nMy Tip: When you order your burrito, ask them to grill the tortilla.

It's bit of a drive from where I live (Sunset) but it's definitely worth it, especially if you want to fulfill your burrito needs.\n\nEveryone has already mentioned about the flavor of the meat and it's true, the meat is very flavorful.  I frequently come here to order carne asada or chicken super burrito, tacos and shrimp quesadilla.  You really can't go wrong with what's on the menu and the ladies who works here are super nice as well. \n\nThere's definitely some competitions out there in terms of best burrito in SF.  However Guadalajara is right up there with the best of them and I would definitely put them in the top 3 within the Excelsior area.  \n\nLast but definitely not the least... I would skip going to El Farlito, which is located across the street from Guadalajara.", "author": "yusai g."}

I took a chance on this place because the reviews were glowing. It's right across the street from another taqueria, and I almost wish I could reverse time and choose the other burrito place. However, if I could actually turn back time, I'd choose a more significant event to reverse. I mean, it's just a burrito, right? Back to the topic at hand: burritos. I chose a regular carnitas burrito and from the first bite, I was turned off. A big, quivering chunk of fat is not what I deem satisfying. When I did get a piece of meat, its texture was more boiled than anything--definitely not the typical way carnitas is prepared. In assembly, the creator of my burrito was also skimpy on the rice and beans. The salsa had no flavor at all. In fact, the entire burrito lacked any flavor other than that of boiled meat. Another bite yielded a large hunk of gristle. Needless to say, I did not finish eating this burrito. With disappointment and disgust, I deposited the partially-eaten burrito in its bag, which soon found a place of dishonor in a nearby dumpster. I would like to say that at least the staff was friendly, but I cannot afford this establishment even that endorsement. The one who took my order was about as warm and welcoming as a sidewalk--the very pavement I found myself pounding as I walked away from a most unfortunate burrito.", "author": "Shadi G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-17", "description": "3.5 stars. I would give it a 4 but let me explain. \n\nFirst off - the food is delicious. I usually get a super burrito with steak and \"everything.\" I've also tried the super quesadilla and nachos. The burrito is always juicy, seasoned well and the pieces of avocado (present in a lot of their dishes) is a nice touch. The portions are big. If you include the free tortilla chips, you can feed a small village. The salsa bar is loaded with choices and the fresh tomato salsa is DELICIOUS. \n\nSo why the relatively low rating for great food? Because there's always something happening that prevents a smooth experience here for me. This is a burrito joint, establishments that I associate with - get in, order what I want, get out, quickly drive 3 minutes home, hide in my man cave and devour everything. \n\n 1. They will only cook you the full menu IF they're in the mood. I have different cravings at times. When I'm fully shitfaced after a good drinking sesh, I really crave a breakfast burrito (chorizo + eggs). However, they'll serve it to you sometimes and not others. I've tried ordering it in the morning - \"no chorizo.\" I've successfully ordered at night but one instance particularly stood out. I ordered a breakfast burrito, the tall head waitress lady turns to the cook, asked if he's willing to make it, he shook his head and the lady denied my order. Probably \"no chorizo\" is a better response. Oh, you'll also hear \"no tripe\" from time to time too. \n\n2. Ohhhhh the tall head waitress lady who works the afternoon/night/grave shift. She's really ok, she really is. She'll be friendly at times and not others. When it gets busy, she does the thing where she starts taking orders from the person after you while STILL tending to you. One particular instance: she started tending to the next customer while refusing to give me change until I asked 1min later, then which she promptly put me in my place with some sharp words. I've come here enough times and she's consistently friendly with me now, no biggie. The morning and afternoon waitress is such a dear though. \n\n3. Some more random thoughts: I've come here around 5:30 and I've stood in front of the counter for a full ten minutes while the waitresses were counting all the money in the register without saying ANYTHING to me (no hi, sorry, nothing). Probably tallying the early shift's transactions. Also, during the non-busy hours, don't be surprised to come to an empty counter and wait a few minutes before a waitress shows up to take your order while she's tending to other stuff in the back (slightly understaffed?). \n\nAll these issues are minor and will probably be encountered by someone who come here pretty often. But if it happens enough times when I'm just expecting a smooth \"take out and pig out,\" gets a bit annoying. \n\nLast note: this place is packed with drunk people on Fri and Sat after midnight.", "author": "Gary L."}

The habanero sauce immediately caused my face to feel a wave of warmth, and soon after, produced a healthy amount of sweat.

The burrito hits the \"spot\" with a nice taste and balanced filling.  I like the facts that they include a good amount of cheese, and the steak was great and tasted fresh. Rice was good, the beans were standard but not great. I especially like the fact that they include sliced chunks of ripe avocado in their burritos. \n\nI also experienced an excellent super chicken taco, priced right at $3.25. The chicken was very tasty and I again applaud them for including sliced avocado and fresh cream on top with the onion and cilantro. \n\nTried their natural melon juice and it was refreshing, not loaded with ice as they take care in serving it (small $1.75). I like the fact that they actually give you a good quantity of juice instead of loading your cup with ice. At lunchtime this placed was packed for a Sunday afternoon (lineup).

This is authentic Latin taqueria food and not fusion or fake like Pancho Villa. I do recommend this place but it's not a hearty and heavy filled one though.

First time we tried this place my husband and i enjoyed it a lot. The super burrito is good and also their melon fresa. If i were to rate them according to our first time, i would give this place 4 stars. But..............Tonight was our second time cuz husband wanted a burrito. I ordered their super burrito with regular chicken as on their menu there is a choice of grilled or regular chicken( i assume regular chicken is their boiled shredded chicken). Husband gets his usual carne asada super burrito. When we come home and i take a bite into my burrito, i realized i got a regular grilled chicken burrito. I called them because it was not what i had ordered. The lady who picked up checks my order and says she misunderstood me for a regular grilled chicken burrito instead of the super burrito with regular chicken and that she charged me for a regular burrito. She also says that it was my fault for not saying \"boiled chicken\" and saying \"regular chicken\". I told her no where on the menu under the meat choice category says boiled chicken. It was either grilled or regular. She was basically arguing with me on the phone saying it was my fault  and at the end she apologizes and hangs up. I called so they can re-make my burrito but instead i was argued with and hunged up on.

My friend was attempting to order food before me, but the cashier was having a side conversation with one of her friends and asked him to wait.  Then, when she decided she was ready, he attempted to order, only to be interrupted by her side conversation again.  After sitting down to eat our food, my friend asked for more of their chips, and they gladly gave them to us.  I came back the next night, and this time ordered a burrito, which I thought would be $6.50, but came out to be $8.25, so expected a damn good burrito.  Instead, I got a loose, watery one, and it had no flavour.  I got a sample cup of salsa to give it some flavour, and it did improve a bit.  However, when I went up to get another sample cup of salsa, the same cashier from the previous night blocked my hand and told me I wasn't allowed to get any more! So I payed $8 for a shitty burrito and less than an ounce of salsa.  On top of that, I asked for more chips, but somehow over the course of twenty four hours the chips had been given a price of an extra dollar! I'm not accusing anyone of being racist, but I am an Asian woman, and when the friend who got the chips for free happened to be Mexican... That's all I have to say for now, I'm just very disappointed in this restaurant that had the potential to be a regular place for me to eat.

I had one taco de lengua, then decided to get two more, they were so good!  The green salsa there was pretty good as well, with the chips and on my taco.  I was pretty satisfied with the food that night, so I thought it kind of made up for the customer service.\n\nI came back the next night with a different friend, but this time the experience was worse.  For starters, the burrito I ordered was a bit expensive, the menu said it was about $6.50, but it came out to about $8, so I was expecting a hella good burrito!  Instead, what I got was a soppy, wet, flavourless burrito...  For real, it was like they poured a glass of water in it.  I don't know what the hell a wet burrito is, or why anyone would want to eat that???  But I sure as hell did NOT order that, so they either got my order wrong, or they just gave me a nasty burrito.  I really enjoyed their chips and salsa, so I asked for more chips, thinking they would be free like last time, but this time it was a dollar extra??  I mean, it's not that expensive but I didn't really understand their sudden change in price (then again, I did ask another worker).  I thought I could just give the burrito the flavour it needed by adding more of their green salsa, but when I went to get another of those little clear cups of salsa, to add to the one measly cup that I had already got, the same cashier from last time snapped at me and told me to stop getting salsa!  Although I wanted to reply with \"Stop serving me shitty food???\" I didn't, as I didn't want to cause an unnecessary argument... As I turned to leave, I heard the cashier say something to her coworker about me, and I happened to hear her use the word \"joto\" which translates into \"faggot\"...

The ladies there were also kind of rude; I was at the salsa bar and I didn't spill until the employee wanted me to move with a curt \"Excuse me!\"--at which point I spilled and she looked pissed while she toweled down the area.  But yeah the food was really good and I would definitely go here again for the super burrito.", "author": "Be K."}

He was right, and I have never set my foot into the other Mexican restaurant again. I usually order the Super Quesadilla with steak. The first bite is the best, as you the burst of Cheese, sour cream, avocado, the pico de gio attack your taste buds. The Pico de gio tastes very fresh and tangy. The cheese is perfectly melted, and the steak is cooked well-done. The Quesailla is presented in two halves. Almost as big as two regular burritos.

First, Guadalajara is the BEST Taqueria EVER to have been implanted on the surface of the planet!! This place totally made me love, and even obsess about burritos. I still remember the first time I got a super burrito there and I was not able to finish it. No a days, I just dominate their super burritos in no time! \n\nSome of the best features of this place is that i live and go to school pretty close so I can get me a burrito  anytime! Seriously, I think I've spent over 500 dollars in my life time, and Im only 18, on this taqueria. And, i got my friends car freakin towed (really not my faullt but she blames me for it) because I wanted damn burrito! jeez! i hate that burger king for life! \n\nOh!!! and they take debit cards now! yeah boi!! That really was their only flaw. But problem solved! And they also have this one fine waitress that will soon be my wife  though she doesnt know it yet. She's gonna be making my burritos for the rest of our lives for free! LOL jk. \n\nLove the design of the interior of their restaurant. They have these miniature house designs popping of their walls and latino people painted on the side. its pretty kewl. \n\nIf you ever get the munchies... do not hesitate to take the journey to this taqueria wherever you are in the city. This place is open till like 3:00 in the morning!  It will definitely be worth your time and your hunger will surely be pleasurized. Guadalajara greater than El Farralito .", "author": "josh m."}

Let me get into it real quickly but if you dont want to read jump to the third paragraph.\n\nAt El Farolito - Make things short I bought three orders of food but he only gave me two bags of chips. I asked for one more bag and he was going to charge me. I tried reasoning with him that I bought 3 orders and should get three servings of chips. Instead this stubborn fool tells me only 1 bag per customer and he was doing me a favor by giving me 2. -hold up- I dont even care about the chips, but his attitude and reasoning was beyond stupid. I just spent over 20 dollars ordering food from him and he has the nerve to pinch 60 more cents from me? Its basic business to know that you want your customers happy. So what if you lose 60 cents (I doubt it) because you made freakin over $20 dollars on your damn burrito. I know he doesnt have to give me chips because its not part of the meal but thats not the point. The point is hes costing his boss business in the long run. \n\nBack at Guadalajara. Their burrito is tasty. I can taste the heat of the meat and it was well blended with the rice, beans, guac, sour cream etc. Their Salsa bar was impressive and I can never say no to Pico de Galla and that watery/guac/salsa concoction.

After a couple of places that seemed like they were good, we would scroll down only to find out it was \"Cash Only\" darn it, back to the searching.  Then all of the sudden it was like the heaven's opened up because there stood a great place. Open late (check), Accepted Credit Cards and Cash (check), Good reviews by fellow elites and non elites (check).  So we got up and off we were to the Taqueria which was just a hop,skip and a jump down the freeway from our hotel.\nNow here is the funny part: While parking is easy (mainly street parking), we walked into Taqueria Guadalajara and not the one we were ment to go to (which was directly across the street from this one).  After looking over the menu which included not only tacos but also had: Quesadilla,Burritos, and various combo plates. Prices and service are not half bad either. \nAfter fighting with myself (as i always do in this case) i went with:\n\nCheese Enchiladas-Rolled corn tortillas topped with red sauce and melted cheese; served with rice, refried beans and sour cream, avocado, lettuce, tomato.  \n\nFound a seat next to the window and out of the way of the small line that was starting to form with other hungry late nighters just waiting to get their grub on.\n\nMade our way over to the salsa bar to load up on salsa. By the way the Avocado Salsa verde was the bees knees,  i couldnt stop eating it, along with the free basket of chips (that were not oily or overcooked) that was delivered to out table shortly after we came back. \n\nOur food was brought out to us by a nice server. And OMG WOW.. My plate was huge!!! I didnt expect it to be this big for the price that we paid!  There sitting in front of me was 3 prefect Enchiladas staring back at me saying \"Eat me, im yummy and delish\". Okay i said as i took my first bite.  \nIt was hot, gooey and tasted almost as good as my homemade cheese Enchiladas!! Which i suddenly knew i had to make soon!! About 20 minutes later there was hardly anything left on the large plate.

They do a burrito right.Nice tight wrap and great texture.  I recommend the carnitas.  Lip smacking.  The Super Nachos are enough for two  people.  The horchata is not as creamy as other places which I personally like.  The Super Quesadilla is just as large and filling.  Well priced between $5.95 and $8.00 for most things.  The green chile is darn good and if you like hot try the habanero on the counter.  I prefer them over El Farolito across the street.

The one across the street from this place has always been hit or miss. \n\nUpon entering this place, I realized how much smaller it was compared to El Farolito across the street, and how emptier it was. I was kind of worried from the get-go. \n\nI ordered the usual: Super burrito with carne asada, and the gf had her usual, super quesadilla suiza with carne asada as well. \n\nWe pillaged their salsa bar while the cook was making our stuff. \n\nWhen we got in the car, there wasn't that customary waft of suffocating goodness that we get from EF, but nonetheless I drove home eager to rip off that foil shell and into the goodies. \n\nThe first bite, I kind of just sat there with the food lingering in my mouth, trying to absorb and recognize all the flavors. I couldn't taste the rice, but I did pick up a good taste of the steak. It wasn't too bad. Now the thing with this place is that they have the steak all precooked and ready to go, and then they throw it back on the griddle to reheat. I know this because I witnessed from behind the counter. At EF, they're constantly grilling meats, so the meat in your meal is freshly grilled, not reheated. \n\nOverall, the taste was pretty satisfying as I had been craving a REAL burrito for some time now. Quesadillas are definitely better at EF, and the burrito is decent. Not the best, but I think I can say it's as good as the EF across the street on a good day. \n\nPrices are a bit more than EF too, a good 50-75 cents more. But if you want to avoid the line and just grab and go, Guadalajara is a good choice. Watch out for that habanero sauce though, that stuff is definitely what hell tastes like.

I checked out El Farolito and decided to give this one a try next.\n\nThe interior isn't exactly the most exciting.  It was around 9pm and the place was a little dead but that's not the reason I'm here.  It's for the burrito.\n\nI took it to go and realized when I got home that I forgot to get salsa.  Oh well, I'm sure the burrito will be good nonetheless.  It started out great - everything was nice and tasty.  Too bad it didn't end well.  Some of the meat was rough and fatty which is a big no no.  I'm supposed be able to eat the whole thing without having to spit some of the meat out.  I also had a bad stomach ache afterward, which I don't think ever happened from a taqueria.\n\nI'm thinking it may be an off night because of the glorious reviews the place has.

I shared it and had about less than a third, and that was more than enough. It was NOT GOOD. Although it was SUPER and supposedly contained a lot more than the regular burrito, it sure didn't taste like it! The pork wasn't very tasty, and they needed more sour cream and perhaps guacamole instead of avocado. I could not taste the salsa at all.

I went to this place with my girlfriend earlier this week in an attempt at finding a good taqueria somewhere close to Mission and Geneva.  Rather than going to to El Faro across the street, we picked Guadalajara by a basic coin toss: I wish we had tried the other place!   \n\nWe both ordered the Super Burrito with steak.  Definitely not the cheapest taqueria around: it came to like 18$ for the two burritos and two sodas.  Not terribly expensive but a bit more than I would like to pay for what we got.  They gave free chips and salsa was pretty cool, but they tasted like the chips from the super large bag you buy at Costco - nothing special.  When we got our burritos we were totally starving, but to my dismay there was little to no taste throughout the whole thing.  It was huge, which was nice since we were hungry, but by the last 1/4th of it we both felt a bit nauseous and didn't want to keep going.   It was basically just plain beans, rice, sour cream, and what seemed to be cut up meat with absolutely no seasoning.  The one nice part was that they included whole avocados rather than guacamole, but it didn't make up for the lack of flavor.\n\nI give it a two because it was still a pretty enjoyable time, but had it been a less sunny day I would lean towards a 1-star for pure food critique's sake.

Finally got to this fine restaurant today.  Went at 11:30am and it was pretty empty.  A very friendly counter lady took my order for 2 super tacos(1 carne asada, 1 lengua).  Both tacos came with avocado and sour cream. The beef taco was good but the tongue taco was great! They were very good size portion too.  Saw someone ordered something that was interesting and it was the \"steak plate\".  I debated for about a second on whether to order that too.  What the heck, might as well order that too.  Just skip dinner:-) The steak plate came with 2 thin(not too thin) slices of beef steak.  The interesting thing is that it also comes with 3 Thick (diameter of my thumb) MUTANT sized grilled green scallions(at least 8 inches each) on top of the meat.  I guess you are supposed to somehow eat the scallions with the steak.  I experimented with wrapping a tortilla with the monster scallion and a slice of the steak with avocado and green salsa.  Not too bad, it tasted similar to the Yakitori style skewered chicken with scallion in Japan. Next tried cutting the steak with the plastic knife they have, the results were good since the steaks are kind of thin.  The mutant scallions, however were impossible to cut with the plastic utensil.  The taste is also good eating it individually, however I think wrapping it all in a tortilla tasted better somehow.  \n\nI thought this place is very nice, the service is friendlier than the mission district I think.  The food is excellent, especially the lengua taco.", "author": "Jim J."}

The burrito I got was massive, easily 50% bigger than any other burrito I have ever gotten, but still only $6.50.  My big rub was that it was a bit soggy and the chicken was a might bland.

I usually get carne asada, yett their chorizo is good on the suiza but gets extremely greasy and sells out if you order it after 6pm. If you order chicken you have to tell them grilled chicken, if not they give you like a baked whole chicken and they pull the meat and wrap it in the burrito. It tasted nasty! and I tossed it. I tried their carne asada plate, it was huge, but I just didn't like it. \n\nOnce I ordered a chorizo suiza once. When it came it was shrimp, I said this isn't what I ordered, but they wouldn't take it back, guessing because they charge like $2 more for shrimp, but I paid for the price for chorizo. So I tried it anyways and it was good, but nothing compared to chorizo. Bad for someone who is allergic to seafood.\n\nI've noticed that every time they remodel the place they raise the prices.  I remember when a super burrito was like $4.50, remodeled, $5.00, remodeled, now it's like $6. But still cheaper than any other place I've been to in the city. \n\nI'm not sure of their hours.

I prefer this place more than el farlito which is across the street. It gets kind of messy when eating but thats cause its overflowed with meat so you know its worth it. It has so much flavor and each bite makes you happy. I love their sauces for their chips I always make sure I have a large amount of salsa and guac to go with it. Their tacos are not that bad either its cheap and you get more than what you pay for.  I think this place is great after all your activites at night cause its opened til like 3 am!

The menu is full of great dishes.  Their carne asada is always tasty and they've got great pastor as well.  If your stomach is strong, you've gotta try a carne asada super burrito with chorizo.  It's not really on the menu, but just ask them to chop up some chorizo and add it in there and you'll experience something close to a religious experience.  You might shit your insides out the next day, but that won't stop you from going back for more.  \nAnd their salsa is the shit.  The red salsa that's usually on the left side of the salsa bar is my joint.  I can (and do) sit and eat just those chips and salsa indefinitely.  \n\nBest of all...it's open until 2am!  \n\n------------------------------------------------\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nBeen there twice, both times had the same thing (carne asada super burrito), both times more than satisfied.  What made me fall in love with this place is simply that it's a perfect fit.  All I have to do is walk up and order a carne asada super burrito and I get exactly what I want every time.  I don't have to tell them to add guacamole, it's already there.  I don't have to tell them to fumble around and change anything because it comes exactly the way I want it to come and it tastes great.  \nI used to rave about La Taqueria, but after having Guadalajara, I don't think I'll go back.  I'd much rather come here and spend $5 to get a burrito loaded with delicious ingredients than spend $8 there to get delicious meat and salsa, but nothing else.", "author": "c o."}

I normal go to El Farolito, but today my roommates and I went to Guadalajara.\n\nIt was very tasty.  The al Pastor I had was not too greasy, but still really flavorful.  The agua fresca pina was also really tasty, not too sweet, but still tasting of pineapple.  It was refreshing.  The burrito was the perfect thing for the hangover, and they have a nice array of tasty salsas at the salsa bar, that go well with your free basket of chips.  I prefer the green, because it has more lemon than the others.  Plus, I was hung over, I'm not going to mess around with my stomach too much.\n\nAll in all, the place has a good atmosphere, ample seating, and a tasty burrito.  I think the best burritos are south of 24th st. anyway, and this place  is no exception.\n\nThe one drawback was that somehow, my hangover seemed to return after I finished the burrito.  The marinated goodness that is al pastor became a traitorous woman, inciting rebellion on my insides, incapacitating my for further action until after I had taken a shower.  I have to take away one star for that, but it's probably my own fault for drinking robotussin anyway.  Cheers.", "author": "Ricky R."}

I used to be a fan of El Farolito across the street, but once i got introduced to this place by a friend, i never went back. Why? Well what i noticed about El Farolito is that their burritos got smaller and they give you too much sour cream every time. I don't like to bite into a burrito with a mouth full of sour cream in each bite. Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but I prefer Gaudalajara from now on. One of the main reasons i keep coming back to this place is because it is 5 minutes away from my house and the food is just awesome. I usually get the Super Steak (carne asada) burrito, but a few weeks ago i tried the grilled chicken and that changed everything. I usually don't order chicken in a burrito in any taqueria because i'm afraid it would be flavorless, dry, and just would not be a good combination in a burrito. But man, the grilled chicken here is pure awesomeness. They give you a pretty good portion of meat and the chicken is marinated with great flavor. i don't know what they put in it, but its good. From now on, i think i will be choosing the chicken unless i have a craving for beef.\n\nThe workers are always happy when taking your order and bring a very welcoming feeling. The salsa bar is filled with fresh ingredients. And one thing that this place has that other places don't is this habenero sauce (or salsa?). It seems like they don't have it every day because i don't see it every time i come, but when they do i always get some of it. This sauce is SPICY! But man is it good and gives a great kick in your burrito. If you love spicy, you gotta try this.\n\nOverall you can never go wrong coming to Taqueria Guadalajara.

Their selection is supreme, with their super quesadilla's the best. Portions are ridiculously large, offering most people 2 separate meals (or for those with a more veracious appetite a filling one), they have a great selection of salsas to choose from whilst gorging on their nachos, and their service is a great. My girlfriend and I who wish to practice our Spanish speak it to them as much as possible, and they will respond in the same while able to at the same time speak in English to clarify. They are open until 2:00 almost every day making this spot one of the best late-night munchies delicatessens to enjoy in the city. My personal favorite selection to get their is their super shrimp quesadilla ($9) on sun dried tomato tortilla (free of charge), nachos and a Mexican bottled coke or if the time permits a nice cold Corona. \nIf you are not a fan of Mexican cuisine, I recommend trying out this place at least once.", "author": "Alexander F."}

The pork here is fried, crispy on the outside, juicy inside. And likewise, the flour tortillas they use for burritos get the same treatment - a quick shot on the griddle so it's slightly crispy. They have the self serve salsa station with the fresh variety - diced tomatoes, cilantro, etc - in addition to the runny kind. Amazingly less and less taquerias are doing this.

This is my favorite burrito place in San Francisco, and trust me, I've tried burritos at many different places before. Its great tasting! I love the way they marinade your meat and use real avocados. I can't seem to point out the true reason why I love the taste so much. The size of the burritos are worth your pay. I have a hard time finishing a super  burrito from here by myself ... thats a good thing to me. A $5-6 burrito stuffs me up.  El Farrolito across the street isn't that bad either, but I prefer Guadalajara any day.", "author": "Ann C."}

Upon arrival of the place, we decided to look at the menu.  When ready, we approached the register area, stood right in front of the cashier, and waited, and waited, and waited for the cashier to finish her conversation with another worker.  She didn't even acknowledge that we were there- how rude!  No apologies whatsoever.  We had the super nachos and super burrito.  Poor service, we could look pass.  However, upon eating our food, we found not one, but TWO, count them TWO strands of hair!  DISGUSTING!  That is the worst experience at a Mexican restaurant I have ever had!", "author": "Restaurant C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-29", "description": "This place is absolutely amazing. Everything is super fresh- soft tortillas, fresh, flavorful meats, huge pots of beans cooking and lots and lots of fresh avocado- no guac in sight. My favorite is their grilled chicken wet burrito, which is basically a regular burrito smothered in red sauce, cheese, lettuce, sour cream and tomato. However, I have NEVER had anything bad from this place. It's true that the atmosphere is incredibly casual but if you want fresh, cheap, AMAZING Latin food this is the place to go. My fiancee and I use to live down the block and ate there at least once a week, and now, even though we live across the city, we still brave traffic at all hours of the day and night (they're open till 1 or 2 am on the weekends) just to get our fix.", "author": "Tora E."}
