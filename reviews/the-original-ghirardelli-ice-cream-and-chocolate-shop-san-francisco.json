Last year, I remember that the lines were long. This most recent visit, I had the Painted Ladies Expresso Escape. I love a coffee flavored ice cream. To make it into a sundae, even better. The ice cream is always so good here and the prices, I guess I could say is reasonable.\n\nThere's a large variety of retail merchandise there too. A wide variety of of chocolate squares that will drive you crazy, trying to figure out what you should buy or if you should just buy one of everything so you can try everything.\n\nMy last visit was in earlier this month, so there was a great number of halloween merch. Prices for merch I think are a little high, but that's what anyone should expect of this touristy spot. Although I thought I would have visited this place more than once to tame down my ice cream fix while I was in town, I sadly didn't. There's actually a great variety of ice cream shops in the city.

But this place is a gem! It is located in a very cute plaza with lots of shops and dinning. Don't bother looking for parking on the streets because it has a parking structure that makes it very convenient but that comes along a price tag. The parking was about $8 for 2hs. Nonetheless, the ice cream and Ghirardelli is well worth it! Very Instagram worthy, if your into that! \nOver all, this place is a must if you are in the area, skip Pier 39 and come grab a nice dinner and dessert in the Ghirardelli Plaza! \nQuick note, the portions are huge so you might want to share!!\nHighly recommend the chocolate brownie fudge sundae!

The one on the left and closer to the street seems smaller in size, although here, you can view some aspects of the chocolate-making process while enjoying your sundae. For instance, it was neat to see the conching process - the final stage where the chocolate is smoothed and aerated.  Upstairs is a continuation of the shop, where there's a separate sundae station for to-go orders. \n\nWalking further into Ghirardelli Square there is another store that appears much more spacious.  We came here for dessert one night since there was plenty of indoor seating. They offer such a large ice cream and sundae menu, so it was tough to choose just one. I ordered the Treasure Island brownie sundae ($12) which I split between two of us. Served in a goblet, it contained a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream, layers of hot fudge, a chewy brownie half and was topped with whipped cream chopped almonds and a cherry. The sundae was decadent and the hot fudge was pretty rich. It was a definite splurge, but we couldn't hold back. \n\nThe Ghirardelli shops offer several types of chocolate that are rare sights in typical grocery stores. I spotted both bourbon and blueberry flavors, and we actually bought one dark chocolate bar that contained dehydrated raspberry bits.... after tasting it, I wished we had bought a few more. \nOnce you walk in the doors, see the walls all lined with colorful wrappers and are greeted with a welcoming chocolate square, you are guaranteed to be in a cheerful mood. Make sure to include this attraction on your itinerary to SF!", "author": "Courtney L."}

It's honestly on my top 5 list of things to do in SF while you're there! \n\nNow what I can share is that if you go in the evening, this place is PACKED! There will be a line (it always moves relatively quickly) and you will have a difficult time finding a table to sit at (more than likely, you'll end up stalking tables to see who looks almost finished and then kind of hover there.) This is what gets them 4 stars for me instead of 5. It's just always packed in there. What's unfortunate is that I don't think people know that there's another scoop shop just up the steps as part of Ghirardelli Square that has more seating and outdoor options as well. I've never been to that one in evening....so it may be equally packed. \n\nI have been here 3 times. Two were in the evening and I eentually found a spot prior to my ice cream coming out. The other time was just to buy gifts and get a hot cocoa in the morning and I was one of the only people in here. So if you're trying to beat the crowds, go in the morning or early afternoon. \n\nAlso, I recommend the hot cocoa (the Bay Area can get pretty cold regardless on time of year!) and the classic hot fudge sundae (no nuts for me!). You just can't beat it! \n\nAlso a great place to buy gifts for friends/fam back home. They have a lot of assortments of chocolate, many with SF themed boxes, etc. I also like to just walk around the square and go into the various shops.\n\nDefinitely head here when in SF.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-05", "description": "Even though I find Ghirardelli chocolate to be far too mass-market and conventional compared to local artisan names like TCHO and Dandelion, this particular outlet is worth visiting even if you're a local, not just because of the touristy and historic factors, but because of its gigantic, overloaded sundaes.\n\nDon't be turned off by the super-sized prices; they're super-sized to match and are easily shareable by 2 people, if not a family of 3 or 4. They come in all sorts of combinations and it makes for a great way to reconnect with friends, particularly folks visiting from out of town. \n\nAlthough my 3-star rating indicates that it's not the best in the area, neither for its chocolate (see the aforementioned names) nor for its ice cream (try Bi-Rite or Humphry Slocombe), it's still worth a visit - at least once.", "author": "Vincent L."}

You can even make your own bag. Also when you walk in there is usually a sales person that greets you with a free chocolate sample of the current promoted flavor.\n\nDepending on the time of year or day of the week Ghirardelli can get crowded quick because it is an hour with high traffic especially from tourist. I been here on busier and quiet times but do not let the line discourage you because they are efficient and the wait time for the order wont be too long.\n\nAt the Ice Cream shop there is plenty of dessert options between ice cream and drink variations. Inside of the Ice Cream shop there is plenty of tables and a restroom located in the back. After you place your order take your order tag and find a seat. The wait isn't that long to find a table or receive your order since people are usually rotating in and out of the shop.\n\nI had the Treasure Island - Warm Brownie Sundae that comes with vanilla ice cream, a warmed Ghirardelli Chocolate Brownie half, handmade hot fudge topped with whipped cream, diced almonds and a cherry. I modified my order without almonds due to allergies. \n\nThis is my favorite sundae and what I usually order whenever I come by. The portion size is pretty big and more than enough to share with others. They are very generous with the toppings which can get a little messy once you dig in but the sundae is served with a small plate to help manage any type of mess. The flavors of the toppings compliment each other well which nothing overpowers each other. \n\nIf you're in the area looking for chocolate, ice cream or drinks then come by and give Ghirardelli a try.

I've had Ghirardelli through the years and I thought it would be really sweet (both literally and figuratively) to check out where it all started.\n\nLocated at Ghirardelli Square at Pier 39, this place was not hard to miss. There's a big arch right at the front with the name. (It's perfect for photo ops by the way). The place is split into two sections- the chocolate shop where you can get chocolates to go and the restaurant itself.\n\nAt the chocolate shop, every one gets a free sample! They also have a variety of deals.\n\nThe restaurant is cool! They take your orders up front and then you can sit where you want. What I really enjoyed was they had a live display showing how their chocolate is made from start to finish. Along with the machines making the chocolate, they had signs showing the process. It's like having a lesson in chocolate making. \n\nFor my visit to the restaurant I got their Golden Gate Ghiradelli Banana Split. Now the Golden Gate bridge is phenomenal and this banana split named after the famous red bridge is as well. It had vanilla, strawberry, Ghiradelli chocolate ice cream topped with crushed pineapple, strawberry topping and handmade hot fudge served with a banana, whipped cream, diced almonds and a cherry!

A brownie sundae and a 2 scoops dish totaled about $21.00. There was nothing spectacular about the flavors, and the choices were limited. Most brownies are served with vanilla ice cream, cuz you know ... no imagination. \n\nTo make me feel just a tad bit more like a desperate tourist looking or life experiences to post online ... it took a long time for our order to come out. I mean, they weren't cooking anything, right? You scoop the already frozen ice cream, top it with can whip cream, toss on some sprinkles and viola! \nAnd when the order finally came, part of the ice cream had already melted. Perhaps they should've stored the goblets and serving dishes in freezers. \n\nThis experience had led me to actually feel sorry for real tourists who probably flew in to SF, got a hotel, rented a car, overpaid for parking, stood in line just to try and enjoy this overpriced, semi melted ice liquid. \n\nNot worth the time or money, unless you truly believe in supporting the local economy ... then hey, thanks a bunch!", "author": "James L."}

The hot fudge is amazing against the cold ice cream. Good size for two people, or one really hungry person ;) \n\nEarthquake: 8 scoops of ice cream with a plethora of toppings on top including nuts, mini chocolate chips, bananas, and more. This was $40, and with tax around $45. It claims to feed 4, but our group of 6 struggled to finish it. A good choice if you have a really big party, I'd say at LEAST 6 people.

Yes, it is one of the tourist attraction staples, but that's part of the experience to say you've been here and tried the World Famous Chocolate. So many will say they've seen and walking around Ghirardelli Square, but not eaten inside to try the goodies. The big deterrent is the price. $13 for a sundae and brownie is not the most appealing thing. These are tourist attraction prices, which come with the territory. Sharing the dessert is the way to go. My favorites since I have been going here are the Treasure Island, Nob Hill Chill, or hot fudge sundae. Anything with a brownie has me lured in already. \n\nEven on a cold night, you will see people enjoying ice cream, but it is warmed up inside. They are open late, perfect for a after dinner dessert.

We were not expecting that when you get to the front of the line you immediately have to make your choice and pay the cashier.

I was reminiscing of when my older brother used to surprise me with ice cream when he would get out of work. He used to get me vanilla ice cream with black cherries, and that is what I got here. Two scoops of vanilla ice cream with black cherries in a cone with chocolate and almonds on top. Sooo freaking good! My sweetie got the Nob Hill Chill shake. He loved it as well.\nThe shop was super busy. You stand in line while looking at the menu and go through a register prior to getting to the seating area. It has a diner feel, your order is created behind a counter and then your number is called to pick it up. There is a chocolate making machine in the back that was cool. I always imagined myself bathing in chocolate... Don't worry I restrained myself from climbing in :)\nThe order came out fairly fast but there was a hiccup with my order, I asked for a cone and got a waffle cup. My order was fixed right away and the wrong order was given back to us as extra. I had the intention of eating both of my icecreams but the scoops are so generous, the first one put me in a sugar coma.

Absolutely!\n\nWe made the wise choice of visiting here on a weekday.  I've been past here during weekends and the line goes way out the door, both to get into the shop and into the ice cream parlor.  There's actually a second Ghirardelli store and ice cream parlor just across the square which we didn't discover until after we were finished, but the one we chose has the working machines that's a treat for the kids.\n\nAnyways, we got two ice cream creations and one salted caramel hot chocolate.  The total bill came to about $35.  Currently there's a sale on Breyer's ice cream at a local grocery store - 2 packages for $5.

Add in ice cream sundaes and you have the perfect recipe for an unforgettable dessert experience. My only disclaimer to this flagship location is that it is an absolute tourist spot. Pack your patience, prepare to line up, and search determinedly for seating. We have visited this location multiple times and found the popularity still grows regardless of varying times of the day and outside temperature. The ordering process is easy and there are multiple cashiers ready to assist. Making a selection proved to be the toughest part as the menu does a wonderful job of describing the decadent toppings included in each sundae. I have tried a couple scoops of the chocolate ice cream, Ocean Beach, and The Painted Ladies Mint Bliss. \n\nThe chocolate ice cream, without any toppings, is a nice and simple dessert. Decadent flavor of rich chocolate guaranteed to satisfy sweet cravings. The Ocean Beach Sundae (Sea Salt Caramel Sundae) is my absolute favorite. Vanilla ice cream with generous amounts of caramel and layered with hot fudge. This is then topped with whipped cream, more caramel, sea salt, and a Ghirardelli Square Milk Chocolate. The Painted Ladies Mint Bliss is my second favorite. Mint chocolate chip and Ghirardelli chocolate ice cream layered with dark chocolate hot fudge and topped with whipped cream and intense dark twilight delight chocolate. Each sundae has its own unique twist and satisfies sweet cravings.\n\nI recommend stopping by the chocolate shop for a souvenir tin or even a bag of mini squares.

I've been here a total of about 3 times, every single time I've been at Fisherman's Wharf, and it's the best. There is inevitably always a line, but the line is worth it. Also, the line moves faster than you think. If you're in a party of 2 or more, I would recommend one person staying in line to order and the other person looking for a table to sit as there aren't too many seats and it might be difficult to find a table sometimes. Lastly, they have a parking lot available where they validate.\n\nTheir Presidio Passion (strawberry hot fudge sundae) is AMAZING. I normally don't like fruity flavors with chocolate because I'm a huge chocolate person, but man, the presidio passion is just so good. Their whipped cream on top just makes everything even more perfect. The mixture of strawberry and hot fudge is unlike anything I've ever tasted; highly highly recommend! Also, it's big enough that 2 people can easily share.\n\nTheir classic Ghirardelli hot cocoa is great. My mom, who's not a huge chocolate person or a sweets person, absolutely loved the classic Ghirardelli hot cocoa. She said it wasn't too sweet and the taste was perfect. If you're looking for a warm drink, I would recommend this.\n\nThe Crissy Field (cookie bits sundae) is up there with the Presidio Passion. It comes with ice cream, whipped cream, cookie bits, chocolate, and caramel drizzles, and it literally melts in your mouth. If you're looking for something a bit more sweet, I would recommend the Crissy Field over Presidio Passion. The Crissy Field definitely has a lot more sugar as it's packed with so many things. The taste is absolutely delicious. Whenever I go to Ghirardelli now, I always get the Crissy Field.

I think I've finally realized that what I like about The Original Ghiradelli Ice Cream & Chocolate Shop is the 1862 era building in which it is located and the dazzling white marquee lights on top of the roof. The 150 year old large brick building was originally built as Pioneer Woolen Mills and then Ghiradelli moved in around turn of the century and continued their chocolate making operation there until the 1960s. In 1960s they moved to their current day location in San Leandro but they, with some hard work, retained a presence in the area which eventually became known as Ghirardelli Square. \n\nAs far as the ice cream eating experience goes,  you order just inside the door and then find a table and a server will bring your sweet treats to you.  They have about 12 flavors of ice cream and you can keep it simple and just get a scoop for about $4.  For more decadence, a fancy sundae runs about $12.  In my opinion, that is some pricey ice cream.  The decor is nostalgic and perfectly suiting for an ice cream parlor, which I really appreciate.  Although Ghirardelli Ice Cream & Chocolate Shop has been on all of my itineraries to date, I think I can leave it for the true ice cream connoisseurs.", "author": "Courtney K."}

Unfortunately, during my visit to not just one, but TWO of the Ghirardelli stores at the square - the service I received was less than palatable. I would even say disappointing. My family and I entered both stores and bought a sundae from one, and chocolates from another. We lingered around browsing for quite a while making our choices in both stores as well.\n\nWhilst there, there were workers standing and greeting every single customer and handing out free chocolate samples for the season (peppermint bark). Since we were in the store(s) for quite some time, we realized that said workers did not fail to offer every single customer/family that walked in the chocolate along with a Christmas wish... except us. We started to feel uncomfortable about it as it seemed to become (at least to us) exceedingly clear that there was some differential treatment going on. I am hesitant to call out on it as racism but that's how it felt to us (we're Asian and every other customer was White). \n\nIt was especially clear when at the counter the customer before us was offered the samples but when it came to our turn we didn't even get a smile. We started to feel dissatisfied about this treatment and pointedly asked if we were allowed to have some as well (and we don't even like peppermint bark!), only then did the workers begrudgingly hand us one each. \n\nI hate to accuse any person(s) or any establishment of discrimination / racism, but that's how it felt/ was perceived as by me and my family of five.

We came on our very first day in the city, but since it was a little later in the evening and quite chilly out, so we opted out of getting a sundae, and chose to have their signature hot cocoa instead. We ordered the original and the sea salt ones, which were absolutely delicious and decadent and everything you hope for in a hot chocolate! The only thing that was a little disappointing was that the hot chocolate was lukewarm by the time it got to us, but I forgive them because it is always crazy busy in there! \n\nWe came back a few days later on the last day of our trip so we can try their sundaes and ohmygod,  I'm still not over it. Pretty sure I'll be having dreams about Ghirardelli ice cream sundaes for weeks! We had the Golden Gate banana split and the Lands End salted brownie sundae! We shared both sundaes among 5 people, and although we all agreed we could have gotten away with ordering just one, we definitely didn't regret ordering two! \n\nThe banana split was everything I love in a sundae and more. The classic Neapolitan flavors were creamy, rich and absolutely amazing covered in whipped cream and chocolate sauce, and the bananas were fresh and sweet. The salted brownie sundae was just devine. Words cannot describe the types of feelings I was having while eating it. It was an experience all on its own. I wish I had another stomach just so I could have fit more ice cream into my belly! \n\nI can't wait to come back!

The actual ice cream did not present itself the way it was pictured. I was missing two layers of fudge! The chocolate covered strawberry was a huge disappointment and you can immediately tell it was already going bad as if it were a few days old.\n\nThe place was extremely crowded and if you decide to dine in on a Saturday, you may not find a seat. People were hovering over others that were nearly done and about to leave just to grab their seats. We were able to find seating by the booth but the table was a mess and it took some time before someone finally cleared it out. We immediately regretted not taking it to go.\n\nThe good news is that they've decided to open another ice cream bar at the Ghiradelli Chocolate Shop that we walked by earlier and had practically no line! I'd recommend visiting this location if you don't mind that it is not the \"original\". Overall I would give this place a 2.5 stars since the ice cream was satisfactory although not pleasing to the eyes.", "author": "Frank T."}

If you're simply craving something sweet and desert, then there's a couple of factors you have to consider... parking (in the heart of SF!) and prices (avg $10 per person for a decadent yet not super sized, 'tho good satisfying portion, not sharing sized).\n\nParking has gotten easier if you know SF and the way to have forced karma through knowledge and education of how to work the meters and zones as well as the surrounding nooks and crannies of the area, especially right now when it's in the fall/winter when it's darker faster and colder outside of tourist season.\n\nPricing, as mentioned is on the above average higher end, yet the quality is good not necessarily uniquely great, but good, and A-OKAY.

My boyfriend and I love taking our friends here!\n\nHere's the low-down:\n\nFirst off, parking off of Jefferson street is sometimes easy to get. That's where I normally park and it's only about a 2 minute walk away. Be ready to be searching around and bring quarters if necessary. \n\nThis Ice cream shop is at the lower part of Ghiradelli Square not to be confused with the other shop. This one has a cute little entrance with a bunch of gift baskets with chocolate. You walk around the corner and you enter the dining room with tables, a food prep area, and A CHOCOLATE MACHINE IN THE BACK!!!!\n\nI am writing my review based on my visit from last Saturday the 12th. I came with my boyfriend and two friends a little after 11:00 pm. They're open till 12 which I love! We weren't sure about what to get so we ended up getting a chocolate-covered strawberry, some fudge cubes, and a chocolate chip cookie. Our friend ordered a cookie as well and our other friend ordered a sundae, I believe it was called Lands End. \n\nThe chocolate-covered strawberry was tasty. It was huge and costed like $5.00. A little high for me. The fudge was very rich and just the right texture, however it didn't blow me away. The price for 5 cubes was like $11.00. I wasn't sure how much the cookies were but they were very moist and warm. Very tasty! \n\nThe sundae was about $17.00. I thought if it was that expensive, it better blow me away. It didn't but it was still good. It came with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, two brownies, hot fudge, chocolate sauce, and a cherry. It was a decent size and the 4 of us enjoyed it. But to be honest, I felt like I could make it myself at home if I had all the time and ingredients. \n\nI like the dining area. They have a decent amount of seating but I can see it being overcrowded. I feel like they could have more seating. \n\nWhat blew me away was the happy and great customer service!! My friends and I were helped out by Monique and Kenyatta. They were so happy to serve us and answer all of our questions about the food. We were pretty indecisive so they had good patience. They gave us good recommendations on heating up the cookies and what they thought about the sundae. We were able to joke around with them and they had positive attitudes with us. They made our experience quite fun! \n\nOverall:\n\nGhiradelli Square is definitely a tourist attraction. It's a good place to come by for the experience, sweets and great customer service. The prices may be steep but I feel that it;s definitely worth to try out. i'll see you again Ghiradelli Square!", "author": "Robby T."}

During my visit, we'd always stop by Ghirardelli Square to see that wonderful Christmas tree. I haven't been here in over 15 years, but I really wanted my son to get some yummy chocolate at the Original Ghirardelli Ice Cream & Chocolate Shop during our recent vacation.\n\nWe were so surprised by how long the lines were here. After waiting an hour in line, we decided that we just couldn't wait any longer. When we mentioned to an employee that we just wanted to buy some chocolate (the line was apparently just for ordering sundaes), she mentioned that the other door led directly to the store.\n\nThis was very, very crowded as well, but it was nice to pick up some items and go directly to cashier. They also gave samples of chocolate as we walked in the door. The customer service was good, but not necessarily great. Because it was so crowded, the staff seemed completely overwhelmed. It was impossible to move through the crowds of people in the store without bumping into everyone in sight.\n\nAlthough we're not sure if they still put up a Christmas tree in Ghirardelli Square around the holidays, we'd love to come back to get some of their delicious ice cream and see the lights at Christmas.

My favorite Ghirardelli chocolate is the milk chocolate caramel. I thought it was pretty legit that the day I came here, they were giving out these flavored sample chocolates.

I would definitely suggest trying to get something here no matter how large or small. What's not to like? It's both chocolate and ice cream! Be sure to have patience and make time during your visit here because it's always super busy and filled with people here.

Just yesterday I made a trip to SF just to buy an ice cream sundae at Ghirardelli (and I live about an hour and a half drive away). \nIn total I've been to this Ghirardelli location three times in the past year, at least that I can remember. I'm a big fan of the making your own sundae (it's a better deal), and I think it's nice that they now offer some complementary toppings. One thing though, I'm not sure if it's true, but I feel that the SF location has higher prices on the same items offered in other Ghirardelli locations.\nIt is very crowded, especially on weekends. On a weekday or during the slow part of a weekend the line can be bearable, but during the busy time it can easily stretch past the next building of the square. The line does move relatively quickly though.\nOne of my favorite things to get is the raspberry sorbet. I'm somewhat lactose intolerant (totally great idea for someone like this to go to an ice cream place huh), but I get the sorbet because I really think it tastes good! Also because the menu does display calorie information and I feel so much less guilty getting the raspberry than my second choice, which would would be the black cherry vanilla ice cream. This time I got three scoops of raspberry sorbet, Ghirardelli dark hot fudge, toasted almonds, Ghirardelli dark chocolate chips, and a maraschino cherry. I forgot to ask for diced strawberries, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I paid a total of $9.96. \nThey made my order really quickly; I waited for five minutes if not less. Since I got it to-go, I ate it all up while walking along the beach nearby. It was definitely a worthwhile trip.\nI knocked off a star because the cashiers are kinda rude. All three times I remember going the cashiers were very matter-of-fact-ly, looked annoyed, and were quick to input my order and move on. Yesterday was better, the lady who took my order clearly had other places to be but she spelled my name right and got my order in without mistake. The first two times (I believe I got the same cashier those two times, how unlucky) I went with my mom (who has a bit of difficulty speaking English), and let's just say it ended with her snatching the receipt from the cashier and fuming about how rude the cashier was the entire time we were waiting for our ice cream. The second time really ticked me off too, I asked how she was doing and she just ignored me and nonchalantly greeted me back, to which I frowned, confused, but brushed off. She continued to mess up our order two times, which I didn't brush off so easily.\nAnyways, for any hard feelings the cashiers may cause, it'll all be cured when you get your ice cream :).", "author": "Jackie Q."}

There's tons of whipped cream on the 2 sides, which is fine, but the cookie is a bit dry :-/ Def. mix with the ice cream (eh)\n\nEspresso Escape- Had one bite but had tons of hot fudge in it haha. It was dark chocolate but insanely sweet. :)\n\nThe service is nice, as the first Crissy Field started to melt, and the server brought it back to remake because \"she didn't want to give us a melted ice cream\". which is really really nice. :3\n\nOH and there's no signal in here so check in BEFORE you get in and show them the coupon! I didn't do it cuz i was stupid and checked in into the square first- which screwed me over.

I don't know how they do it. The ice cream is cold but the chocolate is warm. The chocolate is very thick. I am guessing when they make it, they don't dilute it with too much milk. I love that thick gooey texture and best of all the sweetness goes perfect with the vanilla ice cream. I wish they have more peanuts sprinkles on the top. I love nut sprinkles. They also add in a cherry to make it look nice. \n\nThe portion is huge. Its actually enough to share for 2 or even 3 people.

We decided ice cream would be great after our lunch.  The line was fairly short, maybe a two minute wait.  I went to a register and ordered an Ocean Beach and a chocolate cone.  I then proceeded to a table.  Once at the table I looked at my receipt and noticed it said Ocean Beach and chocolate.  I went to the counter and asked a server what it mean and they said that it mean I wanted the Ocean Beach with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla.  I then told them what I'd wanted and offered to pay the difference.  The server said no, that was fine and went to tell the other employees what my order really should have been.  A few minutes later my order arrived perfectly.  The taste was wonderful.  The chocolate was rich and the salted caramel was amazing.  I thoroughly enjoyed my sundae. My son's cone was huge and he was in heaven.  My sister also ordered a sundae, black cheery, it looked wonderful as well.  I would definitely return on a future trip to enjoy some more delicious ice cream.", "author": "Ashley E."}

Maybe I would faint and reach God momentarily before coming back to life because it was just that good. Disappointed to say that didn't happen today unfortunately. \n\nThe line isn't so bad, it goes by pretty fast. Once you get inside though...that's where Table Games begin. May the odds be ever in your favor! Seriously, you'll need it. You place your order at the door and they give you a number stand, and then you're on your own to find a table. Not sure why they structured it to be this way, it'd probably be less like an apocalypse if they sat people down when tables become available, or maybe make use of technology to help you mark which tables are available. Come on Ghirardelli.  \n\nI know a lot of people say that coming to Ghirardelli's is a must-do if you come to SF. I'm a SF native and have passed by the square on so many occasions, but have actually never tried the sundaes here LOL until today. I think this place is more so for you chocolate aficionados and chocolate lovers. The sundaes are nothing grand, but insanely sweet. Makes you THIRSTY! Not sure what you're paying for because you're definitely not paying for $12 worth of ice cream. Experience? Forget it. \n\nConclusion: This is SF, there are so many amazing and delicious ice cream shops in the city, in my opinion you'd be better off going to those. My reasoning 1) taste, 2) price (cheaper), 3) shorter lines and no table war. \n\nPARKING: street, insane. You'll be lucky to find one. Fort Mason is nearby and have more parking spaces, unmetered, I believe it's 2 hours (No Parking 4-6pm). There's also garages of course. \n\nPRICE: expensive for some basic ice cream. \n\nSERVICE: table situation terrible, but the workers there definitely deserve recognition, having to deal with the mass amount of people that come by everyday.", "author": "Vivian S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-03", "description": "How can you not go to San Francisco without hitting up the \"Original\" Ghirrdelli Ice Cream Shop. Make no bones about it, this is a tourist trap. No matter, we could not wait and made it one of our very first stops.\n\nLocation is superb at the wharf, but technically called Ghirardelli Square. Easy access to get to the area on public transportation via cable car, or bus. Don't waste your money on a taxi its too easy, scenic and reasonable to not go public. The benefit of this is also no issue with parking which is a challenge. Off street parking is around, but close to impossible to come by. If there is a garage nearby I did not see it. There are parking garages on down the wharf on Jefferson.\n\nI could have easily hit this review with a 3 based on how much trash is around. I tried my best to not get too excited because the whole area has debris to some extent and this is better than some. But you will find all type of trash almost every where in the square. But in front of the door it was clear.\n\nGhirardelli has been around a long time and has a great established name for quality products. We have been fans for years and there is no local shop in our area of Virginia so we made two stops in our week by the bay. This is the \"Original\" shop not to be confused with others in the city...it's the best in my opinion. It has some nice extras and can accommodate a lot of customers.\n\nService when ordering is immediately upon walking in the door and was excellent both times. When you do a yelp check-in an offer comes up for $1 off for sundae. Also if you get a MUNI pass they have a 10% discount, so even a better deal because it's not limited to a sundae. You will want a deal believe me, a two scoop sundae is $11 +tax. Smiling faces from staff help the sting of the cost and you will absolutely love the product.\n\nSeating is downstairs and upstairs both. They will find you by the number given after paying. I never had any issues locating a table for two even though it may look impossible. Make your way to the back and see some cool chocolate machines, then chocolate fountain on steroids. They also dip the waffle cones in this area which is fun to watch. I found the dining room to be tidy, any empty tables were cleared and clean from what I saw. \n\nThere are no restrooms located in the shop which is a downside. You must go to the public restrooms in the square that is not too far, but used by homeless. I've seen worse, so I am not hitting them hard. However, they have been well used. Everything worked with supplies present.\n\nThe delivery of the sundaes on both visits was within 10-15 minutes and comes with extra napkins and spoons in case there is sharing. Believe me, the deal is to share because even a two scoop sundae is crazy huge. If you split it also makes it much more affordable. I had a hot fudge with vanilla and chocolate sundae with was scrumptious. On another visit a chocolate shake that was good, but too rich and chocolaty if that is possible. My wife got the Mint Brownie both times and said it was awesome. You could call her a SUPER FAN! When finished there are tons of staff that work cooperatively on clearing the table. On both occasions they swooped in and grabbed dirty dishes. \n\nThere is a gift shop that is connected to the shop. It has the large bags of square chocolates variety packages. We bought two bags on sale for a 4th of July deal that was pretty good to take home. Its not huge, but displays are attractive. We ended up going back here at the end of the trip for a few more gifts.\n\nSo to recap it's a must stop and hit the \"Original\" one in the square at the wharf. Use any and all discounts it's expensive. They are huge, so if you don't mind share and save a lot. Finally take public transportation due to issues with parking congestion. You will love whatever they make you.", "author": "J David H."}

But this is my first time ever purchasing something from here! \n\nI came here on the Friday before 7/4 and holy moly...claustrophobic overload! There are two lines going on here: one is into the actual shop to order your dessert delectables and the other was the to-go line. There was no line going into the chocolate shop, so we went there first to get our free mini salted caramel samples! \n\nWe waited in the never ending line for about 20 minutes before we got the register. I love that they give you the menu when you are waiting in line to speed up the process!\n\nAfter much contemplating, I ordered:\n-Crissy Field aka Cookie Bits Sundae: Vanilla Ice Cream nestled between two cookies and cream ice cream scoops, smothered with homemade hot fudge. Topped with whipped cream, Colossal Ghirardelli chocolate chip cookie crumbles and two Ghirardelli chocolate squares\n\nLOOK AT THAT DESCRIPTION. They say it's bad to have dessert before dinner...but you don't get Ghirardelli ice cream everyday! \n\nWe ordered around 3 PM and the cashier told us they had ran out of waffle cones! (Sure. I saw you making more back there...) But either way, you can choose to dine in or to-go. Dine in, you hunt for a spot. To-go, you wait in line for them to call our your name. \n\nWe chose to dine-in and the wait was about 40 minutes. The hard part was finding a table, because most people were already saving spots, so we had to hover over others and swoop in when they left. \n\nWe got our ice cream delivered to us, with two spoons. (I wonder how they know how many spoons to bring?) TIME TO DIG IN! \n\nPros:\n-DELICIOUS COOKIES. I love their cookies! Now let me go get a mix of this stuff!\n-Good portion size! All portion sizes are huge, and this was definitely a good \"appetizer\" before dinner! \n-Great service! No matter how crazy it got, the cashiers and waiters were still super helpful and knew how to calm the crowd. \n\nCons:\n-Uh...where is my hot fudge? I was literally only slurping down melted ice cream and lots of whipped cream. Where is my fudge?! \n-In the process of waiting for the waiters to hunt me down in the midst of people, my ice cream had melted quite a bit. SUCH SADNESS. Even if they announced numbers over a microphone and made me get it myself, I would be totally fine.\n\nTips/Observations:\n-There is seating upstairs for the coffee/hot chocolate \"bar\"! But I would recommend staying downstairs if you choose to dine-in or else your ice cream will become a hot mess. \n-CHECK IN on Yelp and get $1 off your sundae! Tmobile literally has no service upon entrance of the front door. Get checked-in BEFORE you enter the room to show you did it!\n\nOverall, I will definitely come here to try their other sundaes!

Being from Denver, I've been told to check-out the Ghiradelli Ice Cream Shop when traveling to San Francisco. Having been there now, I can say that it's a nice little shop. But, it's a little bit expensive. And there doesn't seem to be anything spectacularly special about it. Maybe I'm just one of those girls who likes a little bit of uniqueness in the touristy places I go, but I didn't find this shop to be too exciting. \n\nWhen we walked past this shop on my first trip to the piers, I saw that it was super crowded. Both at the downstairs and upstairs location. Although I don't mind crowds, I do mind rude people. And tourists tend to be rude in general. But, I thought I'd brave the hordes and venture in to get the ice cream I was craving. Right before the doors to the upstairs entrance, there was a basic menu. And OMG, the prices were a little steep. Not wanting anything fancy anyway, I opted for just a sugar cone and a scoop of ice cream. \n\nUpon entrance, we were greeted by some employees. They offered a free sample for one of their limited edition chocolates. It was a dark chocolate with some blueberry filling inside. While it tasted fine, it wasn't my cup of tea. So, I ate a bite and gave the rest to my friend. While waiting in line, I had already chosen the ice cream scoop I wanted, the black cherry vanilla. When I got to the register, I was super disheartened to hear that they had run out of that for the day. While this does happen to every busy business, I was still a little bit disappointed. In the end, I just opted to get a cookie dough scoop. \n\nAs it came time for my ice cream to be put out, I watched in amusement as the servers were scooping my ice cream onto the cone. The guy literally broke 3 cones trying to put a massive scoop on the cone. This was pretty pleasing because I knew that I was at least getting a giant scoop. I felt at least a little bit relieved that my money went a little further than usual on this scoop. \n\nWhile the scoop tasted fine and like a usual scoop of cookie dough, it wasn't that exciting. The ice cream tastes like any other ice cream. Their flavors weren't spectacular in the least (in general). And this place is pretty average. If you do go, I recommend going through the service at the top floor. The downstairs is really busy compared to the upper floor. And be expected to pay high prices for ice cream you could literally get anywhere else, in my opinion.", "author": "Stephanie N."}

When I saw them making it I thought, oh that is just way too lusciously decadent to eat! It will be too sweet! And then I promptly scarfed it. The hot fudge is insane with the mint chip ice cream, so creamy and rich, you could eat one of these things for lunch. Definitely called \"Mint Bliss\" for good reason!

There's often a line out the door just to order one of the infamous hot fudge ice cream sundae or hot chocolates. Not to mention, exploring their gift shop to sample some free chocolates is a plus too.\n\nThe only reason why I like this place is because of their hot fudge sundaes. Despite the sundae price being on top of the roof, the warm hot fudge with vanilla ice cream, nuts, and a cherry on top is a way to end the night at San Francisco. On the other hand, Yelpers get a dollar off the sundaes which is a plus! \n\nThe only downfall about this place is the amount of tourists checking this place out. The indoor seating just to enjoy the hot fudge sundae can make one feel extremely overwhelmed or claustrophobic. If I were you, I would enjoy my sundae outside of the shop by sitting on one of those resting benches or perhaps indulge your sundae in the comfort of your own car.\n\nAs for buying Ghiradelli novelties, I suggest stopping by your local Safeway or some grocery store that has the chocolate squares in stock. The price they sell just for those chocolate squares are ridiculous!", "author": "Aubrey D."}

A fan of sweets of any kind... I was looking for something to mark the occasion.  And boy!  Did the original Ghirardelli Ice Cream & Chocolate Shop fit that bill!\n\nLet me start off by saying... I LOVE ice cream.  I also LOVE chocolate.  So how can you really go wrong with this place.  If this was a review of just the consumables... this place would be hands-down, five stars.  I ordered a 2 scoop cup of ice cream (1 scoop of Ghirardelli chocolate and another of cookies & cream) topped with caramel and whipped cream.  The dark chocolate fudge topping was calling to me but... I decided to draw the line just before going there.  There is nothing bad I can say about my dessert, it was fantastic.\n\nAs an obvious tourist attraction, this place does really well to keep the long lines moving.  Paper menus are passed out to those waiting in line so you can order right away when you approach one of the several cashiers inside.  You can either get it to eat there or to go.  I opted to take it with me as it was clear there were already a number of people crammed into the small seating section found inside.  I was directed where to pick up my order then tried desperately to find a place to stand to wait.  Each time I found somewhere to stand that was out of the way of the hustle and bustle of the staff moving around inside, I was told that I couldn't be there and had to move again.  There is just really no space for those to wait who are taking their orders to go.  \n\nThere is an interesting moving display inside that walks you through the chocolate making process.  It was pretty neat to check that out.  Try to take your time soaking in the interior of this place with its original tile floors, etc.  With the craziness of the atmosphere inside, it is easy to lose touch with the history its walls exude.\n\nIn my opinion... a must stop if visiting San Francisco.", "author": "Ashley P."}

Each sundae costs $10--which is pretty ridiculous--but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try what they advertise as world famous ice cream. I ordered the Mint Bliss sundae and the boyfriend ordered a Golden Gate Banana Split.  The ordering process was really smooth, and you get $1 off per sundae if you check in to Yelp! Then we went to hunt for a table, which took a while. I'd recommend to order to-go and sit outside if the weather is nice since it's so crowded inside. \n\nMy mint bliss sundae was hella good. It came with a huge scoop of chocolate ice cream, a huge scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream, hot chocolate fudge, whipped cream, and a dark chocolate Ghirardelli square on top. I dug in right away. The ice cream was rich and delicious, and the chocolate fudge was divine. It was so rich and smooth that it pretty much tasted like chocolate ganache.

I've loved chocolate and have been eating chocolate as my dessert of choice since I was...really young or something.  Basically, I have eaten a lot of chocolate in my day.  Ghirardelli's signature sundae did not disappoint.  Side note:  check-in ahead of time for the $1 off Yelp coupon.  I did not do this.  Amateur mistake, and I had to ugh...save my coupon for later.  The worst.  \n\nAnyway, of course I switched my sundae from vanilla to chocolate.  No brainer.  Almonds on the side because they remind me of healthiness.   Then I dove into two scoops of excellent milk chocolate with lakes of hot chocolate on the sides which kind of morphed into the melted ice cream for extreme bites of pure sugar.  The whipped cream was of sufficient substance so held firm deep into the sundae.  As opposed to cheap whipped cream which falls apart and then leaves behind that trail of melted white stuff.  \n\nIt was the stuff dreams are made of.  And when I had eaten almost every bite my greedy spoon could reach, I drank the dregs like a champ. It was wonderful.  \n\nOther noteworthy things about the shop.  Nice atmosphere with a high-end old time feel.  They have a few stools at their sundae bar where you can watch these baristas at work.

And it all looks Gooooood.\n\nThe chocolate at this point, is on its last leg as it continues to melt in your mouth.

I'm biased since I'm not a big ice cream fan, but people love this place. Know what you want when you get to the cashier - she means business and she is not there for recommendations, she's there to take your cash. There are a million menus posted, look around and be prepared. I went with the Treasure Island. It's all a variation on the following: ice cream and chocolate, it's not rocket science. It's a jovial place but it's hard to find a spot to sit. People love to spread out. You may have to bus your own table since there aren't a lot of servers or bussers. The whole thing was super tasty but about 4 bites in, I was pretty done. They are big enough to share. \nWe had a good time taking in the SF nightlife and the good time vibe there. The square is pretty, but there are a lot of tourists. We were right by a cable car stop (speaking of tourists), so we took it. The lines are long, so get ready. Have cash in hand. \nAnother fun \"must do\" in San Francisco.", "author": "Janet C."}

I have been visiting Ghirardelli since I was little and when they only had 1 location. Now, you can find 4 locations in Ghirardelli square. The original location which is easier to find and see from the main road is usually busy with tourists so expect long lines and unavailable tables. I would definitely recommend walking inside ghirardelli square towards the back to their other location which is a lot bigger and offers more selections of chocolate and gift baskets. \n\nIf it is your first time here, I would definitely recommend the original hot fudge sundae. What makes Ghirardelli so good is the combination of the not too sweet vanilla ice cream with their rich dark hot chocolate fudge. Best thing ever.", "author": "Arda S."}

It was super delicious!\n- You order whatever food you want at the cashier and then they bring it out to you which I like! I hate having to wait for someone to take your order, especially at a populated area so ordering at the front was great.\n- I'm not sure what day I went here, but I came during night time (maybe 9-10pm) and it was surprisingly not crowded and felt more \"romantic\" if you're going on a date or something. The other shop was very crowded.\n- Got our hot salted caramel chocolate (or whatever it was) pretty quick\n\nCons:\n- Kind of weird to list it as a con, but the hot chocolate we got was WAY too rich for my taste. It was really thick and sweet and it literally made my throat itchy as heck (because it was so rich with chocolate and heavy milk or something) It really felt like you're drinking melted chocolate like the person melted pure chocolate and gave it to you lol\n\nOverall:\nGreat place to visit when you're visiting SF and around the area.

There is the big one up the stairs with the view of the Bay. There is the shop near Union Square.\n\nHowever, if you are a tourist pressed for time trying to see all of SF in a day and you already walked by the Marina to enjoy that view... then come immediately to this one. While they no longer hold tours of the Ghirardelli Factory, they still have displays here of the chocolate making equipment (as shown in my photos). Might not be as big as seeing the actual factory, but it's actually really neat to see the process of making the chocolate... and who doesn't like watching pure chocolate get mixed in a giant vat? It's literally food porn for chocolate lovers.\n\nWhile you're admiring chocolate being stirred, I would highly suggest ordering something from their dessert menu! Don't think \"Oh I could just buy this from a Baskin Robbins for cheaper\" - DO IT FOR THE EXPERIENCE! I haven't tried their sundaes, but their chocolate drinks are amazing. They literally take their chocolate, melt it down, and use it in your drink.\n\nI've had the chocolate milkshake and hot chocolates, which is great for walking around SF. It's thick, creamy and chocolate-y. If the sweetness of milk chocolate bothers you after awhile, I would highly suggest asking for dark chocolate - they have ability to accommodate such requests at this shop. Dark chocolate won't have that sickening sweetness, and you'll appreciate more of the natural chocolate flavor.\n\nAs for buying chocolate... if you're an out-of-towner, it's worth coming here because you can individually select flavors of the chocolate squares for gifts. There are some unique ones that you don't see out in the stores. Also check out the bars, since there are some I don't normally see in stores like Mango.\n\nBut for those of us local to the Bay Area, there are Ghirardelli outlets that have the same selection of chocolate for 65% off (the Great Mall in Milpitas has a location). However, I gave this location 5 stars for the shop itself - the equipment, desserts, and things to see are what make this location a great tourist stop.\n\nSo if you're a chocolate lover, worth checking this shop out.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

Some very cool, old fashioned contraptions, and all the history to boot.  Definitely a FUN TIME for a kid - or the 'inner child' in all of us.  They have chocolates galore. And yes, I do enjoy some great chocolates from time to time.  Did I feel like an Oompa Loompa in Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory?  Nope, but that doesn't mean you wont!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-07", "description": "Although it says \"1 check-in here\" in this review I've been to the original Ghirardelli location in Ghirardelli Square a handful of times over the course of me being in SF for whatever reason. It's one of my favorite places to go to if I'm ever playing tourist in SF and even with the discovery of Smitten/Bi-Rite/Humphrey Slocombe they serve pretty decent ice cream in the form of sundaes. \n\n-This ice cream shop is a MUST on any itinerary that involves the Fisherman's Wharf or traveling in a cable car (or MUNI bus in place of a cable car). It's closer to the seafood restaurants of Fisherman's Wharf if you want a sweet treat after you've tried clam chowders/seafood and you don't want to walk too far in the opposite direction towards Humphrey Slocombe in the Ferry Building. If you're in the Powell/Hyde cable car route the route ends near the border of the wharf/Ghirardelli square. The treat is even better if you decide to stop at Lombard Street prior and decide to walk several blocks down the steep incline.\n\n-There's actually *two* stores on the square. The other location is further down closer to the harbor. There's also less seating.\n\n-Separate lines to buy chocolate and the ice cream sundaes, but this is true for all Ghirardelli locations. If you stop by the store you can get a sample of one of their squares, which is usually their caramel flavor but can change depending on the season (peppermint squares are sampled upon Christmas).\n\n-You can never go wrong with any of the sundaes, which is $1 off with your check-in (also true of all the Ghirardelli locations). Their most famous is their world famous sundae, which is just a simple sundae with their world-famous fudge (which is what I enjoy the most about their ice cream. Their chocolate ice cream includes this fudge.) \n\n-Hot chocolate is very good. Their drinking chocolate is decent, it is *quite* rich.\n\n-Good place to people-watch if you choose outdoor seating. Especially good if you are sitting in their other location closer to the wharf.\n\n-Line can vary depending on what time you go. This has historically been the case as I've seen longer lines towards the evening, but I didn't see much of a line on my last visit when the 2nd store opened up.", "author": "Isabella B."}

If you want ice cream, it is one entrance, if you want to eat-in, there is another entrance, and if you want to shop chocolates (and get your free sample), there is a 3rd entrance. Because of the lines and tourists (including you) Ghirardelli is really more of a tourist attraction than anything at this point. There are better ice cream or chocolate shops around the Bay and in the city; however, none of them are the original Ghirardelli.\n\nGo to Ghirardelli because it is Ghirardelli ... and that's about it.

The servers were slow in clearing tables so we ended up sitting at a table smeared with ice cream for quite a while. We finally had to get the attention of a server to get the table cleaned. We also had to cobble together various chairs and tables to seat our party. Some of this is understandable on a busy night but it was a bit ridiculous.\n\nThough the ice cream and toppings were good I found it to be overly sweet. The richness literally made me sick because it was just crammed with sugar and not many other delicate or complementary flavors.

I waited in line to order a mint bliss. I had read reviews that service was quite quick, unless you are forgotten like me. I waited 50 minutes after ordering while watching waves of people get their ice cream. Even the family that was ahead of me finished theirs before I got mine. Finally, the waiter brings out a half melted cone of chocolate in a pan. Not a mint bliss. I then wait again to get my sundae. The piece of chocolate on top was fantastic but the rest left me dissatisfied. The whipped cream left a weird taste in my mouth and the mint chocolate chip ice cream (which is my favorite flavor) tasted so awful that I only could eat a few bites. It had the leftover film a java chip frappucino from Starbucks has. I was quite disappointed in service and product and will not be returning in the future.", "author": "Jenna D."}

We decided to hit Fisherman's Wharf for the day, get some clam chowder, check out Ripley's--the whole shebang. My family lives in the East Bay so we never really do the tourist thang in the city unless friends or family are visiting from out of town. Of course, our plans were to end the night with some dessert at The Original Ghirardelli so we could use the coupon.\n\nWe perused the menu while freezing our butts off in line and ordered a couple of sundaes and a cup of decadent hot chocolate with marshmallows once we approached the register. But alas, we found out my dad had left the coupon at home. \n\nIt was to expire the next day. \n\nWell, we still went ahead with our orders, we still finished everything, and we went home very full and very, very happy.\n\nSince then, I have been here many times: on dates, with friends, as a host for out-of-towners, etc. Not once did I leave here without a smile. I guess my point is...despite the tourist-y factor, despite the crowds, despite the nongourmet ice cream, despite the bathroom being outside and far away, and despite the unrelenting cold (there's basically a 90% chance it'll be cold if you come here, regardless of the month)...you'll leave Ghirardelli's happy and with good memories.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

I also often get a sundae. (Hint: If you go after 1pm, the upstairs cashier is open. There are shorter lines at that entrance as well as another employee giving out chocolate samples!). \n\nYou're probably thinking, \"But Howard, my arteries!! Chocolate and ice cream with toffee, butterscotch, and caramel? How will I survive?!\" Hey, you're life may have been cut a little bit shorter by a visit to this place, but it definitely got a lot tastier! \n\nJust a quick price note: Sundaes are about $10 each and the chocolate isn't cheap either. There are many SF guides out there that have a 10% off coupon for purchases at Ghirardelli.

We all didn't want to overindulge so we all got a single scoop. Some of us also had the waffle cone too but it wasn't the best that day. Slightly undercooked so it wasn't very crunchy. I had the chocolate chip ice cream with the regular milk chocolate fudge. Gotto have the Ghiradelli chocolate fudge on top. It was great. A perfect amount for me to go with my scoop. But some complained it wasn't enough or it was too much. The line seemed way shorter at the ground level shop versus the one upstairs. Didn't see the set up upstairs but the downstairs one had a few tables outside. And inside was just meant for ordering (ie no place to sit). It was great.

The warm brownie sundae was big enough to share yet not too big where we couldn't finish it. Everything about the sundae was exemplary.

We decided to take our ice cream to go (FYI: even though you want to take your ice cream to go you still have to stand in the same line as the in-house diners)\n\nMy favorite to order is the domingo - its basically the basic ice cream sundae with vanilla ice cream, loads of hot fudge, bananas, fresh whipped cream, and a cherry on top - if you check in on yelp you do get $1 or 10% off your bill! \n\nLastly, there is a fire pit and outdoor heating when you go up towards the other Ghiradelli shop - not too many people know about this so it's kind of a secret ;)", "author": "Kathleene E."}

There's a top and bottom floor. It was confusing trying to figure out where to place your order, so that you can sit and eat and where the to-go-order line was. Instead, we happen to see a sign just outside the super long line for placing orders that read that there's a second ice cream shop just 1 minute walk away in Ghiradelli square. So b/c we're highly efficient and smart people, we decided to get ice cream there. \n\nThe second shop was much less congested but just as nice! We placed our order immediately (very short line) and there was AMPLE seating outside in their patio. If you're going with a large group/family, I'd highly recommend going to the second shop b/c it's less congested and tons of seating!\n\nI wanted to try both their cookies n' cream ice cream and their mango sherbet, so I asked if I can have 1 scoop of each in different goblets (who wants to mix ice cream w/ sherbet?!). When I requested 2 separate goblets, the cashier told me no, and that it's not possible. Regardless, I proceeded with the order and I was shocked when he told me that my total was $9.50!! for 2 scoops of ice cream?! wth! I gave in b/c I wanted to try both, was on vacay and just didn't feel like making a fuss of things! He handed me a place holder with a number, so that our waiter can bring us our ice cream.\n\nIt took nearly 15 minutes for our server to bring our ice cream to us (we were sitting outside on the patio and we made sure our place holder number was visible). When it finally came:\n1. the serving size is HUGE! no wonder my total for 2 scoops of ice cream was $9! Each scoop could have clearly been 2 scoops each! So definitely just get one scoop for 2 people.\n2. they did bring my sherbet and cookies n' cream in 2 separate goblets, which made me happy =)\n3. most of our ice cream was 60% melted by the time we got it!! HUGE CON! We also ordered a chocolate fudge sundae, which wasn't fun to eat b/c it was pretty much watery! my sherbet turned into a smoothie with a ping-pong size of actual sherbet visible in the middle. My cookies n' cream was milk-shake status. Huge let down!!! We were so pissed that we waited this long for melted ice cream!\n\nDon't come to ghiradelli thinking you're going to get amazing ice cream like Haagan Daaz or other mom/pop ice cream shops. The ice cream tastes mediocre at best...similar to ice cream you get at any grocery store. \n\nIf I had to do it over again, I would go to the second shop (1 min away from the original shop), but place my order to-go so that I don't get partially melted ice cream. And I'd only order 1 scoop! I would not come back b/c the ice cream wasn't anything special. Definitely over-priced tourist crap that we all fall for.\n\nLastly, the free samples of packaged ghiradelli squares tastes EXACTLY like the ones you get at your grocery store. There is no discernible difference b/w chocolate from \"the original ghiradelli shop\" and the ghiradelli packaged chocolate at walmart or at your mall.

Well, I'm a huge fan even though I try to eat \"healthy\"... or so I like to think.\n\nThis place has it all! Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, and did I mention chocolate?! You can find whatever you need here, but if you're hungry, they definitely will fill your stomach with some Ghirardelli goodness! Not to mention they have every flavor imaginable of their chocolates. If you're looking for chocolate for baking purposes, you'll find it here!\n\nFOOD - 5 Stars: We had a couple of desserts and I was pleasantly surprised because we ordered two kinds of ice cream:\n\n- Black Cherry Vanilla Ice Cream in a Waffle Bowl - This was really rich and the black cherry flavor shined through. Also, you can never go wrong with a waffle bowl! I think sometimes I just order ice cream for the waffle cone or bowl. Ain't nothin wrong with that!\n\n- Lemon Sorbet with Pineapple, Almonds, and Candied Ginger - I remember going to the San Diego location and was slightly disappointed when I didn't see any lactose free options. So, the moment I saw this, I knew I had to try it! The lemon sorbet was full of flavor with every bite. The pieces of sweet pineapple and the crunch of almonds gave it some awesome texture and added sweetness to counter balance the sourness of the lemon. To top it off, the candied ginger, which I was hesitant to eat, was really delicious. I wanted to order another dessert!\n\nSERVICE - 3 Stars: The service is friendly, but I don't know if they were understaffed that day, but it took at least 15-20 minutes to get our order. There were so many people waiting around and only 1 or 2 people manning the area to take orders and make them.\n\nATMOSPHERE - 5 Stars: This is a pretty busy spot especially with tourist, but it's a nice break from your day outside especially when it's hot. The moment you walk-in, they're basically throwing samples of chocolate at you! So, that can only brighten your day! It was really nice to relax, talk, and eat in here. We even made some friends with the next table... that's how cool the atmosphere was here.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I'm huge fan of Ghirardelli chocolate and I really wish they had more locations like this open everyday. I'm in LA and there isn't one that's conveniently close by, but you know when I do see one, I will definitely stop in and get my fill!", "author": "Hugh H."}

I was here when I was but a lad,. I came here as young man. And now as father, I still have a gleam in my eye when I see this place If you are doing a tour of the wharf, the pier or even the cruise ships to Alcatraz, this is a must stop visit to one of the all time shrines of sweets across the world.\n\nLast time there, we hit the ice cream first. The place is self-seating so if you have an extra person, send them to find a table while you wait order in that often well populated line. Make sure you get in the correct line and both are usually lengthy. One will be for the ice cream shop and the other for the chocolate shop. Remember: this is a tourist attraction of great notoriety but don't be dismayed. The lines will move quickly. The atmosphere is bustling and a bit tight in some floor places but always comfortable and clean. If you dig watching the process, they will run the equipment in the ice cream section and show how it's done. Young and old, it's always cool to check it out.\n\nWe ordered sundaes. Our boy had a his version of a chocolate sundae and I shared a Crissy Field. The prices are steep for sure but you come here expecting that because you're at Ghirardelli Square for the experience. The Crissy Field is an amazing sundae with three scoops of premium ice cream topped with cookie crumbles, whip cream and their famous milk chocolate squares. The presentation is beautiful and the taste will blow you away.\n\nIf you are visiting, the chocolate shop must be visited especially since it is right next door and connected to the ice cream shop. Their entire selection can be had at various quantities. The packaging and display is confectionery perfect. And because you're visiting, get flavors and treats that are not available in your neighborhood. You'll be glad you did.\n\nWhat's my bottom line? Good? Better than good!

So my BF and I stood in the line for maybe about five mins. Looking over the menu, since I notice they always change it, I saw something new, the Crissy Field. It's cookies and cream ice cream and vanilla ice cream with hot fudge, whipped cream, their chocolate chip cookie crumbles, and two mini dark chocolate pieces. \nWe got that. And TBH, it was good, however it's something you could just make @ home. Instead of vanilla we got rocky road. There was too much whipped cream, as my pic shows, and I was kinda disappointed.

I have had ice cream from this spot since I was a tiny tot and honestly, at this point coming here for a sundae is essentially grabbing some ice cream with family present and departed.  If you have that kind of attachment, this is still a great place to go!\n\nAs for the food, the ice cream is good, but not phenomenal. Definitely have had better, and it isn't worth going out of the way for it.  The toppings do help out quite a bit...especially the hot fudge.  That is some premo stuff :)\n\nIt is a pricey spot, so be prepared for that. I don't think I really got $13 worth of sundae, but it is certainly a tourist spot which explains the price.  That brings me to service and atmosphere...\n\nThe line is almost always out the door, down the sidewalk, across the little fountain plaza, and sometimes wrapped back on itself....seriously.  Plan on waiting at least an hour for this experience.  The process is fairly straightforward - wait in line, order when you get inside the doors. If you are dining in - try to find a table (good luck). If you are doing takeout, send the rest of your group outside and try to distract yourself from the crowd by looking at replicas of original chocolate making equipment while you wait another 20 or so minutes.\n\nThe whole process is like a sausage factory of tourists, but it is still a little slice of history...and you end up with ice cream, so it could be worse :)", "author": "Bob F."}

The cashier was rude and rolled his eyes when we said he had paid extra for the waffle and he demanded to know which cashier helped us. He couldn't find her and so he asked someone else but he wasn't getting the answer he was looking for and he was very obviously annoyed and not bothering to hide it. Then, he finally just went to grab a waffle and stormed back to our table after having dumped the ice cream in it and pretty much threw our ice cream dish on the table, practically spilling it and stormed away.

Both sounded delicious.  Strawberry with hot fudge.  Banana with hot fudge.  How's a girl to decide?\n\nThankfully, I had my friend with me.  It became a no brainer.  We ordered both.\n\nThe sundaes were good.  Chocolate melted upon our sweet ice cream to provide sweet, savory cream in every bite.

I feel like they could have handled it so much better.  With so many people, the wait between ordering my sundae and actually receiving my sundae seemed like forever.  They have separate people taking the orders and making the orders, great idea there.  However, there were only three people actually making it.  I think I waited 15-20 minutes for my sundaes.

It would always be a cold wintry day in SF with great company around the holidays. We had dessert cravings that could only be resolved one way: we looked at each other and said with lit-up eyes and great excitement, \"Ghirardelli's.\" \n\nIt didn't matter how cold it was. It was time for ice cream, and LOTS of it! The hot fudge oozed over the ice cream, slightly solidifying before dribbling down the sides of the cup, which struggled to contain my enormous masterpiece. And don't forget that hot chocolate! Intensely satisfying. How have I not died of a sugar overdose??\n\nI don't have quite the stamina I used to, but I can't resist the attempt, even with my dairy allergy. Hey, if I'm going to avoid dairy a major percentage of the time, I see no better way to celebrate than by having just ONE TINY sundae. (Okay, so it's not very tiny. Of course it had to be the hugest sundae I could possibly find... but let's just not talk about that for now.) Still delicious, still amazing. \n\nGhirardelli's will always bring fond memories of the holiday season. Just thinking about this place, I can practically TASTE that hot fudge sundae right now! It's that good.\n\nTIP: Picturesque setting by the bay + amazing chocolate + ice cream = DATE WIN. Extra bonus is that it is typically cold there, and you and your date will be colder after sharing a sundae, therefore requiring that you snuggle up together over some hot chocolate. ;)", "author": "Denise L."}

It was quite a bummer because of the long drive for nothing. This time, we planned it better. I called the shop first to find out if there was any private function going on and luckily they didn't have any. It was open to the public and so off we went. There were tons of people buying ice cream on a hot sunny San Francisco day. It was also Father's Day. Busy busy busy! \n\nI ordered an all Rocky Road Banana Split with all its toppings while my fianc\u00e9 ordered their Mint Bliss Sundae. We got a table and waited. The place was bustling! Both locals and tourists mingled inside their dine-in area and it was just loud, well, not concert loud. It was just above than normal loud. \n\nOur orders arrived and I was quite disappointed with it. They served my ice cream dripping on the sides because it was melting real fast. I started eating it and didn't really get in the mood of being happy about it. How can you be happy with melted ice cream? I was more busy fumbling for napkins because the table flooded with my ice cream drippings. \n\nI honestly couldn't stop myself from comparing Ghirardelli ice cream to Cold Stone ice cream: at least Cold Stone's ice cream is served as \"frozen ice cream\" and not as chocolate milk with mixed nuts and marshmallows in it. I had no qualms about the taste. Ghirardelli's chocolate ice cream was rich and thick with flavor, but it wouldn't do anything for me if it was melted. I stopped eating when I had like a bowl of chocolate milk with floating nuts and marshmallows in it. I wasted more than a scoop of ice cream because it was not ice cream, it was chocolate milk. \n\nI wouldn't travel all the way to San Francisco just to visit Ghirardelli for ice cream.

Should be shared between at least 2-3 people (unless you come here for a meal).", "author": "Ananta S."}

Ordering is the simple part as it's quick with many lines to jump on. The wait begins once you start hawking for a table (even if it's just a small table for 3) and then waiting for your sundae. No seriously, it's so crowded, you literally will feel like you're on edge scouting for tables as people tend to stay awhile. All in all, we waited a little over an hour for our Ghirardelli Square - World Famous Hot Fudge Sundae, which is vanilla ice cream overflowing with handmade hot fudge, whipped cream, chopped almonds, and a cherry. One bite into this dessert and you'll instantly forget about the table troubles and how you waited over an hour for it. It was THAT good.

I had the treasure island, which is vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, a few nuts, and a warm brownie. It was amazing. I worried before we went that we wouldn't have a place to sit, but that ended up being no problem as there was no wait at all. The shop was clean and the service was great. The only thing that I thought was weird was that our sundae came out before we could even get seated, they must have making them down to a science or so many of a certain thing is ordered that they just make them anyway.

Of course you're going to eat the sundae with a rootbeer float on the side despite your fasting glucose level of 250 and Hgb A1c at 11.5%. I will let you guys read all the other awesome reviews below to get the skinny on all the great desserts here. When you walk in, you just live and breath chocolate. Here are some tips that you may not know about but will keep you from destroying your experience here:\n\nFor parties greater than 4, you are much better off getting your ice cream to go and eating it outside. You are not going to find 2 tables close enough together to enjoy your sweet delights and it's so beautiful outside! Grab it to go and eat it on the pier. \n\nBathroom? Why the hell would I be talking about the bathroom at Ghirardelli's? Inevitably, you will be looking for one when you come because chances are you drove for 30 -45 min at least to get here and then you walked up this ginormous hill to get in. The bathroom, ladies and gentlemen, is on the OUTSIDE. Yes, there is most likely going to be a line too.\n\nWhile you're waiting in the 1000 person line to order your food, send one person to the front of the line to grab a menu and decide before you get to the counter... it'll do us all a favor.\n\nHave a designated stander in line (DSL) who will hold your spot while the rest of your party goes into the gift store to buy your san francisco treats (not rice-aroni). \n\nHope this is helpful! If you don't get the brownie hot fudge sundae, you're crazy.", "author": "Eric C."}

The manager offered to send me a Ghirardelli gift basket to make up for it, which I refused. It was however a nice touch to see that the management did care about their guests' experiences, so I returned.\n\nI ate here once last week and am pleased to say the experience was much, much better. While the value is a bit iffy ... nothing in Fisherman's Wharf costs what it would in 'real life'. The portions here aren't amazingly huge, but the ice cream and chocolate is great quality, so it makes up for it.\n\nI had the brownie sunday in a waffle bowl. (You pay the extra for the waffle cone/bowl ... but it totally makes the sunday better!)\n\nThe servers were polite and attentive and the process was fairly speedy from ordering to getting the sunday. There were no mistakes made this time, which was nice. It was the off-season, so not as busy but there did seem to be some staff retraining that occurred since the last time I was there.\n\nOverall, this is a fun place to stop for an ice cream while you are doing the tourist thing. Ghirardelli might be sold across the country everywhere from Walmart to CVS but there's something about eating it in its hometown that makes it taste better.\n\nDespite a few rocky visits, they seem to have shaped up their service so I'd bring people who were visiting San Francisco for the first time here.", "author": "E T."}

Here's another one, the Ghirardelli Chocolate Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop, which makes it sound like they only serve chocolate ice cream and chocolate, don't you think? \n\nI'm not sure what motivated Jamie W. and me to come here except there aren't any old-fashioned ice cream parlors anymore - especially in a city as culinarily chic as San Francisco. Sometimes fro-yo just doesn't cut it. Who wants tart when you need artery-clogging creamy? Besides, I don't want to be responsible for the downfall of the maraschino cherry industry. This stuck-in-the-1970's place is abuzz with enthusiastic suburbanites and rude foreign tourists enjoying a favorable currency exchange rate. We elbowed our way to a table where there were remnants of the $29.95 Earthquake, which apparently was eight scoops of ice cream with eight toppings served on a faux-silver platter. Belch. \n\nWe went for the relatively modest $7.95 Hot Fudge Sundae and then splurged the extra dollar for a chocolate-dipped waffle bowl (see photo). Sure, it was good. What else could it be with nuts, whipped cream, chopped almonds, globs of hot fudge and the maraschino cherry which Jamie promptly pilfered? The noise level was darn near unbearable, so we tried to focus on the big paddle in the chocolate-making machine (see photo). Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth. Anyhow, we finished the sundae much to our dismay since it spoiled our dinner. Guess mom was right. \n\nHOT FUDGE SUNDAE - 3.5 stars...classic but nothing that exceptional \nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...clean but needs an image update \nSERVICE - 3 stars...buzzed by but the cherry was intact \nTOTAL - 3 stars...classic San Francisco experience if that's what you go for", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-09", "description": "This is about the Ghirardelli Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop in Ghirardelli Square.  Why in the world would I give this shop only ONE STAR?    This ice cream shop is such a beloved and popular institution in the City of San Francisco, that my ONE STAR rating makes it seem that I am a traitor, or a Communist, or something even worse!!!  I have lived in the San Francisco Bay area since 1965, and attended middle school, high school, college (UCB), and graduate school (also UCB), in the San Francisco Bay area.  As such, I've toured San Francisco many times, and have enjoyed the the Ghirardelli Ice Cream shop on a half-dozen occasions.  At least, I have enjoyed it until last night, when I finally realized that I was being tricked.\n\nOn the plus side, the Ice Cream shop is very clean.  There will often be a line outside, but the line is fast moving, and the wait for a table will usually be under ten minutes.  Any person spending a half hour in this Ice Cream shop will enjoy the air, which is \"perfumed\" with the enticing fragrance of freshly roasted chocolate, and will enjoy being in happy crowd that typically includes international visitors.  When in line, it is typical to hear German, French, Farsi, Hindi, and other languages.   The menu of ice creams is lengthy and enticing.  Also, the chocolate shop off to the side, and in a different room than the dining room, has an attractive and varied display of many kinds of wrapped chocolates, suitable for home use or as gifts.  The types of chocolates vary from year to year, due to the innovating mind of the food scientists who work for Ghirardelli.  For example, an innovation that appears to have materialized in the past ten years is chocolate lightly flavored with salt.  I am glad for the variety and innovation of the chocolates in the gift shop.\n\nNow for the bad news.  For most, or perhaps nearly all of the ice cream \"meals,\" it is the case that about fifty percent of the volume is taken up by WHIPPED CREAM. WHIPPED CREAM!?!?!  The result is that your ice cream meal will taste like a slap of hog lard.  I do not particularly care for the flavor and texture of hog lard, and I do not particularly care for such a dominating presence of WHIPPED CREAM.  Apparently, one of the goals of management, is to save money, by scrimping on ice cream, and by giving you instead PLENTY OF WHIPPED CREAM.  For my recent visit (August 8, 2015), I finally came to my senses, and I ambled over to the trash can near my table, and scooped out half of my phony ice cream meal, which consisted totally of WHIPPED CREAM, and dumped the WHIPPED CREAM into the trash can.  The Ghirardelli ice cream meals are already expensive enough.  Management's behavior at giving you a meal that is 50% WHIPPED CREAM, results in an ice cream product that is in effect twice as expensive as with no whipped cream.  Another complaint is that some of the ice cream meals are given to you in an elegant, heavy-weight glass goblet, but other ice cream meals come in a plastic cup, just like at McDonald's. \n\n I noticed that at least a dozen other reviewers complained about the fact that these phony \"ice cream\" meals consist of 50% WHIPPED CREAM.  As such, one has to be impressed by the phenomenal markup of your meal.   It seems that a typical customer is paying eight dollars for twentyfive cents worth of ice cream.  Wow, I wish that I could start a business where customers are willing to buy a product with such a steep markup!!!", "author": "Tom B."}

Because there's a gift shop that you can walk through where they give you a free square of their famous chocolate. Also, the chocolate making display is interesting and entertaining. I would check it out if you can manage squeezing through the crowded restaurant.  If you've been here before, I think once is enough, because this place can get ally crowded and packed. I'd rather not wait 15 minutes in line and another 15 minutes to get your order for icecream.\n\nFoodwise, they serve icecream and coffee.  The icecream is genuinely tasty, but definitely a bit sweet for my taste.  I've tried the banana split which is easily shareable amongst four people, but my crowning achievement at this place is ordering the earthquake.  It is basically a scoop of every single type of ice cream that they have topped with chocolate syrup and fruit sauces.  I would only order it if you have at least six people to share it with.  It's definitely worth the price considering you get to try a little bit of all their icecream.\n\nIn terms of service, order at the front counter. It should be easily be identifiable with the long line stretching out of it.  Once you make it to the front (usually about 15 minutes), place your order and pay.  They will give you a number so that you can find a seat.  Once you find a seat, they'll bring your order out to you.  This usually takes another 15 minutes.\n\nLike I said, this place is worth a try if it's your first time, but if you've already experienced it once, then there really isn't much enjoyment in mingling with tourists and long lines, especially for just icecream.", "author": "Howard H."}

Heck, when I was a kid, I LOVED it.  \n\nBut then it became a pure tourist trap, which has realized things like \"customer service,\" \"selling you what you bought in a timely manner,\" \"selling good ice cream,\" \"have reasonable prices\" are unimportant, as they don't expect any repeat business from anyone!\n\nLast time I was there, a couple at the table next to the uncleaned table we snagged said \"Good luck!  it took us an hour to get our ice cream!\".  I presumed they were just griping, that they were crazy, whatever.  Nope!  After 20 minutes, I flagged down someone and got them to clear our table.  After 30 minutes, I flagged down someone and said \"where's our ice cream?\".  After 45 minutes, I went inside to the \"kitchen\" where they make the ice cream, found a supervisor, and said \"where's our ice cream\".  He said \"we're a bit backed up, it'll be here soon.\"  I continued to stand there for another five minutes (these times are all pretty precise; the time we ordered was on the receipt and I wear a watch), until he got someone to put our order ahead of others in the line.  \n\nIt wasn't just a one-time mistake; they're actually running a system where it regularly takes 45-60 minutes to make and serve a basic ice cream sundae.  How is that even possible?  \n\nThe sundae was fine, but relatively small, with ice cream that wasn't great.  \n\nThe time before, I came here was it was maybe 50 degrees out, late at night on a weekday; we got hot chocolate.  It wasn't slow, because there was no one in the shop, but it tasted watered down.\n\nAvoid.  Find some actual high quality local chocolate or ice cream store on your trip to San Francisco, and skip Ghirardelli's, which isn't even manufactured locally anymore anyhow.", "author": "Zachary R."}

You'll be surrounded by chocolate instead of other tourists. \n\nOn a cold windy day (like most days in SF), A sea salt caramel hot chocolate is the perfect drink to warm you up.

The store itself consists of a cafe in which you could order all kinds of chocolate treats and a chocolate shop with their signature squares and bars. It is a bit pricey, as SF typically can be. I got a mixed bag of 50 Luxe chocolate squares for $20 as I had never seen this product line locally.\n\nFor a better deal on the same Ghiradelli chocolate, a visit to the San Leandro factory outlet is suggested.

It's in a beautiful area, near Pier 39, but close enough to be away from *most* of the tourists(except the ones in the know). \n\nI always love the free chocolate I get. And picking out some chocolate to take home. On my most recent I discovered their new toffee, caramel chocolate bars. They are HEAVENLY. Definitely my new favorite. My boyfriend is very lucky I didn't just eat the whole thing when he stupidly left me home alone with the chocolate. I also love to get some ice cream. The most recent time we got a sundae, covered in delicious ghiradelli chocolate sauce, with a warm chocolate-chip cookie. It was fantastic. I am also a huge fan of their milkshakes. \n\nIt's a great spot to relax while being a tourist in SF, and to get some chocolate to take home(or send to relatives if you are being really nice). \n\nI think there are like 3 Ghiradelli shops just in Ghiradelli Square, but this, the original, is the best.", "author": "Kristin C."}

They gave us extra spoons I guess so we could try each other's dessert.  That wasn't going to happen though.

You will be staring into one another's eyes not aware of the surrounding chaos associated with eating at this establishment.\n\nFor everyone else, in my opinion, 1 star is more appropriate.  I LOVE Ghiradelli Chocolates and Ice Cream. I've been to their San Diego, Monterey, San Leandro and San Francisco locations multiple times and have and will continue to buy their chocolates but I regrettably say that after bringing locals and out-of-towners to this location for the past 15 years each ensuing visit feels more chaotic than the previous. I also say this after our group just finished eating at perhaps equally crowded Boudins. Our experience at Boudins was much better in terms of service, food quality, seating, etc.\n\nPros:\n- Great Chocolates including the free sample that you get upon entering store side\n- Great Ice Cream (when frozen)\n- Cool working Chocolate Rolling Machine in Back of Store\n\nCons\n- Bad place for any party larger then 2 or 4. We had 9 adults and 5 children. \n(Trying to find seats on an actual subway platform during rush hour would be a good way of describing the chaos and conditions that we encountered. After looking for 5 minutes for ANY table adjoining or not, we thought it appropriate to ask for assistance from the staff. This was met with a what-are-you-kidding-me-look along with a flustered response that we were on our own to arrange for seating. I've had more assistance getting group seating when I've gone with friends and family to a HomeTown Buffet.)\n\n- 20 Minute wait for Food to be served (Quality of course takes time right? Please keep reading)\n\n- Ice Cream Soup was served to us\n(No, not just the sundaes we ordered but even the Ice Creams Scoops in a Bowl. Why make us wait 20 minutes to get our Ice Cream if they will be melted upon arrival? If the premium in price we are paying is NOT for service as shown above, then it must be for the quality of the food. Alas, that was not the case.)\n\n- No Bathrooms in or near store\n(The lovely folks that manage the whole Ghirardelli square thought it appropriate to share bathrooms with the 1-2 dozen other shops in the square. The ladies standing 10 deep in line outside while it was raining to use these bathrooms did not seem too pleased with this particular use of efficiency.)\n\n- Broken Exit Door with No Sign\n(We pushed then pounded on an exit door 3-4 times before turning around wondering what was happening. The cashier annoyingly looked at us and told us that this particular door was broken. As some would say: Whats it take to put up a sign, a cone, caution tape, a handwritten napkin?)\n\nAll the staff was busy, busy, busy, like bees buzzing within a hive.

Vanilla ice cream with melted peanut butter, hot fudge, caramel, whipped cream, and a Maraschino cherry on top - how do you not feel guilty about that? However, the melted peanut butter was just a brilliant idea because it really mellowed out the entire dessert.

I didn't know this place existed until my friend told me where we were going in San Francisco.  \n\nWhen we arrived, there was no line and we looked at the menu on what to order.  Everything looked good and sounded good on the menu.  I ordered a Large Butterscotch Fudge Sundae ($8.71 with tax) and my friends ordered a Large Hot Fudge Sundae and a Hot Fudge Peanut Butter Sundae (both the same price as mine).\n\nWe sat down and waited for our order to come.  It wasn't too long of a wait.  I didn't try my friends' sundaes but I'm sure they tasted good.  My Large Butterscotch Fudge Sundae was pretty good.  As I was reaching the bottom of the cup, there was A LOT of butterscotch sitting at the bottom.  That mixed with the melted vanilla ice cream and it was pretty sweet.  The fudge was good and pretty much up to par of what I thought of Ghirardelli chocolate.  The best fudge I ever had!\n\nThe store had a wide selection of Ghirardelli chocolate and I saw an umbrella they sold there which I thought was made of chocolate because of the handle.

They go out the door and around the corner -- so you can go upstairs to the \"express\" line which only go half a mile long, and out the door...  Expect to wait 30-60 minutes to get some scoops of ice cream...\n\n2) The prices are insane. $10+ for a sundae!  (and you thought Frappaccinos were expensive!)  The size is no longer as massive as I remember it.  A brownie sundae is 2 average-sized scoops of ice cream in what appears to be a 16 ounce cup, and they don't even give you a FULL brownie with it (same for the cookie sundae) -- they give you HALF of one.  For $10?!?  Weak, weak, weak, weak, weak.\n\nThe ice cream is fairly good and the fudge sauce is delicious, but serve that up with a side of boredom and impatience from standing in line, smothered in empty-wallet-syndrome, and with a dollop of bad attitude from the servers (they seem to hate working there, but quite frankly I can't say I blame them), and that is one bitter sundae you end up having to swallow", "author": "Matthew G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-08", "description": "Every time I'm in San Francisco, I make a point of stopping by for an ice cream sundae and some chocolates to bring back home. As mentioned ad nauseum by other Yelpers, the place is full of tourists like me (but I'm a considerate tourist :) ) during the summer, so don't come here expecting a quiet, relaxed atmosphere. And don't be surprised if there is a long line at the ice cream shoppe, though the line moves relatively quickly. Once you place your order, you are given a number placard that you place on your table which is used by the servers when they bring you your ice cream. Service is friendly and fairly efficient, though if you come at a busy time, your ice cream might be half-melted by the time the server tracks you down, especially since you probably ordered a hot fudge sundae (which is what I'd recommend you order, but more on that next).\n\nI went to SF twice last summer, and both times, I dropped by for a sundae. The first time, I ordered the Mint Bliss Sundae (Chocolate and Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Creams, Hot Fudge, Whipped Cream, and a Mint Bliss Square), and the second time, I got the Gold Rush Sundae (Vanilla Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, Peanut Butter Sauce, Whipped Cream, Cherry, and a Peanut Butter-Filled Milk Chocolate Square). Both were delicious, and in both sundaes, Ghirardelli's hot fudge was the star. It is exceptionally smooth, dark, and rich, and it is the highlight of the sundae. The hot fudge really makes you want to lick your bowl clean. Alas, I care enough about my public image to exercise the tremendous amount of restraint necessary to not lick every last drop of hot fudge out of the bowl. I'm a sucker for anything that has peanut butter in it, so the Gold Rush Sundae was particularly satisfying.\n\nBe warned, though,  that the sundaes are very sweet, perhaps borderline excessively sweet, so if you are not a fan of having your teeth nearly get to the point of hurting from the sweetness, these sundaes may not be for you. You should probably take advantage of the water that is available for free inside of the cafe.\n\nWhile, for the most part, I am a fan of the ice cream sundaes here, my biggest gripe is the price. Plain and simple, I think that these sundaes are a bit overpriced. $8.95 for two scoops of ice cream, some hot fudge, and toppings? Really??? I mean, I get that this is a tourist attraction, but there is no way the sundae should cost so much when you can get sundaes from a Dairy Queen or Friendly's for $4-6.\n\nIn summary, I'd definitely recommend stopping by Ghirardelli Square for chocolates, and if you have no fear of sweetness, check out the ice cream shoppe while you're at it. While the price:value ratio isn't great, the sundaes taste good enough that you (momentarily) forget that you just got hosed.", "author": "Kevin C."}

The square does however have two Ghirardelli chocolate shops offering all of their chocolates as well as ice cream. Many people come here for the ice cream, which is very good and the portions are generous but is only available in a handful of  common flavors and is pretty expensive for non homemade ice cream. The square was originally home to the Ghirardelli chocolate factory but is now home to a number of stores and eateries. The area surrounding the square is one of the most beautiful and best maintained parks in the city. It features the beginning of the world famous Hyde St cable car line, views of the Golden Gate Bridge, a large lawn, a small beach area, and is blocks from the Fisherman's Wharf area.\n \nHere is some more information on Ghirardelli:\n \nDomenico Ghirardelli was born in Italy in 1817 and worked under a confectioner in Genoa when he was very young. In his 20s he left for South America and became a coffee and chocolate merchant. Lured by the gold rushes, Ghirardelli moved to California in 1849 and opened up a general store (which of course included chocolate). By 1852 Ghirardelli opened his first chocolate factory which changed spots a number of times before ending up at the factory at North Point St in San Francisco in 1895. The Ghirardelli company was sold in the 1960s and was moved to San Leandro, CA. The factory building was then sold and opened up in 1964 as a square featuring the format you see today with a number of shops and restaurants.", "author": "Matt E."}

Every time my family comes to visit me in Northern California, we never fail to visit Ghirardelli at least once. Yes, the lines are long, and yes, at $8-10 a sundae, the prices are quite ridiculous, but a trip to SF just isn't complete without a visit to Ghirardelli Square.\n\nMy family usually gets the World Famous Hot Fudge Sundae, but I'm more of a mint chocolate chip and dark chocolate type of girl so my go-to is the Mint Bliss. They tend to switch up their other sundaes with the seasons, but those two are some of the few sundaes that they serve year-round.\n\nThey've opened up a few other locations within the square, as their main one tends to get very crowded during the weekends and late evenings, but my family still likes visiting the original location, regardless of the crowd. During their busiest days, they usually open up the counter upstairs, so those days, we just take our sundaes to-go and eat them outside their shop. We've noticed that the employees tend to be more generous with the serving sizes for to-go orders too, so we never mind taking our sundaes to-go. They also tend to give larger scoops to those who order non-vanilla ice cream sundaes (like any of their Intense Dark Sundaes that use mint chocolate chip or espresso chip ice cream). I've noticed that my Mint Bliss Sundae always ends up towering over everyone else's World Famous because the employees aren't as afraid of running out of their other flavors as they are with the vanilla ice cream.", "author": "Gaby W."}

This iconic brand has a rich history and has been making chocolate since 1852.  With 160 years of experience one would expect their chocolate to be amazing and It certainly was. \n\nAfter a long day biking around San Francisco my buddies and I were craving an ice cream. When we arrived the line was out the door but moving quickly. We all ordered the World Famous Hot Fudge Sunday in a Chocolate Waffle Bowl.  Once you order at the counter it's a free for all to find a table to sit. We got lucky and found one easily. We placed our placard on the table and got a few glasses of water from  the self service bubbler while we waited.\n\nA very nice waitress came to our table but unfortunately the order was wrong. Somehow the order went in incorrectly and was served in a glass bowl rather than the chocolate waffle bowl. Wanting what everyone else had we send them back. As the waitress turned she got bumped by another employee and two of the three sundae's hit the floor in a spectacular crash. Of course I felt terrible not only for her but for the wasted ice cream.\n\nShe returned a few minutes later with new sundae's as we had ordered. She did show us that the person at the counter had clearly put them in the computer incorrectly but she gave us what we wanted without any other mention of it.\n\nThe sundae's were huge and we could easily have shared one but how often do you get to have a sundae in the original factory in San Francisco. The ice cream was rich and creamy and the hot fudge was smooth and silky. I managed to finish off the ice cream and hot fudge but when it came to eating the chocolate waffle bowl I wasn't able to finish.

I asked several waiters and they all told me that that section closed at a certAin fixed time even though many of us were waiting for tables.  I asked for the manager and he gave me the line--I suggested that making people wait so long was not very good customer service.  I finally did get a table but was disappointed with my hot fudge since it had a dribble of hot fudge and the ice cream didn't taste like I had remembered.  I also felt uncomfortably rushed as people hovered over my table waiting for me to finish. \n\nI have returned to California after many years on Cape Cod.  I think the folks at Ghiardelli should check out the hot fudge sundaes at The Sundae School in Dennis, MA, on Cape Cod.  There you will find the actual best hot fudge sundae in the world, for less than half the price!!\n\nUnfortunately I feel that Ghiardelli's has turned into a proverbial tourist trap.", "author": "Kenneth S."}

Back when I was 7 my parents would drive 50 miles just to have a large cable car sundae. I remember the pile of ice cream adorned with heaps of almonds and fudge with a little whip cream. \n\nI'm not sure if it's because I'm a decade older now that the sundae seemed to shrink 1/3 of it's original size of ice cream per scoop and was covered with whipped cream to cover up the cost savings. In fact there was almost more whipped cream than ice cream, which is pretty disappointing for a $10 sundae. There was barely any almonds and no fudge was present. I was so disappointed by the lack of fudge because that's what makes their sundae special. The ice cream is from Dryers and you can get the other toppings from anywhere else. \n\nWe wandered over to the new location and the scoops were almost 2x larger! We also found a family that recommended asking for fudge on the side. It was clear that there were two sizes of plates for the sundaes and they were moving towards downsizing. I think we'll be heading over to the new location next time.", "author": "Diana L."}

To me, the Ghirardelli ice cream shop is such a place. I can always overlook the herds of tourists, whipped cream from a can and other imperfections of the shop simply because I had wonderful memories there.  \n\nMy first visit was after a high school homecoming dance. Being much younger and impressionable back then, I was thoroughly impressed by how romantic the ambiance was (back then it seemed much cleaner... and on the night that I visited it was drizzling outside, with very few customers). Nowadays, it's hard to be pleased even by a diamond ring, so it's not fair to judge the shop by my current standards as a jaded old fart. I will say though that to this day, I love coming here in the evenings, sitting in my corner seat, and stare out into the street, like I am \"underneath\" a bridge (you will see what I am talking about once you visit). \n\nI've tried their banana split, mint ice cream sundae, family style \"earthquake\"... and pretty much most things off of the menu, but my favorite, after all these years, is still the original Dark Chocolate Fudge Sundae. It is decadent, not overwhelmingly sweet, and a perfect size for someone who enjoys dessert but doesn't want to feel too guilty afterwards. I was tempted to try it in their waffle once, but that waffle was not impressive. It was stale as hell and I thought docked points off of the sundae itself. \n\nWhenever we have visitors, I always bring them to Ghirardelli Square.

But let's focus on the goodies.\n\nI got to Ghiradelli about an hour before closing time.  This place must be super popular at peak hours because they won't let you in beyond the front souvenir area.  To gain access, you browse the menu while in the foyer, place your order, pay ahead of time and then you're allowed in and shown your seat.  Kind of a roundabout way of doing things, but I'm guessing it makes it more efficient to keep the crowds moving.\n\nI got a hot chocolate, which was topped with a heaping pile of whipped cream and a mini chocolate bar for stirring.  For my main course I got a peanut butter and chocolate concoction mixed with vanilla iced cream served up in an old fashioned sundae/shake cup.  Surprisingly, I wasn't totally sold on the dessert.  The taste wasn't quite as sweet as expected.  However the hot chocolate was delightful.\n\nFeel guilty after gorging yourself, walk some of the streets that give Russian Hill its name afterward.

Their hot fudge is what they are known for, make sure you get a sundae with it included.\n\nParking can be tough, it is pier 39 area so be patient.  And seating can be rough inside but most people finish their ice cream and leave so it's not too bad.  If it's a nice day, you can sit outside and have their ice cream.  \n\nOn a side note, they hire a very international staff, with people from all over the world, that might be to help the tourists who eventually find their way here but I think it's a nice thing to do.", "author": "Brian C."}

Funny how I never got to try that ice cream shop until now. My friend and I decided to share the banana split, considering how each dish costed $10+. \n\n  As our banana split came it was a little bigger than we thought it would be. It was PERFECT to eat on a hot day. The ice cream was soo creamy and cold down our throats which cooled us in a flash. There was one scoop of vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, and some sort of sweet jam with it.  The temperature in the restaurant was a little warm and didn't have a/c, hence why some our ice cream melted a little. However, I am SOOO coming back here next time.", "author": "Aja S."}

Being a SF native, it is kind of sad that I've never had an ice cream sundae from Ghirardelli Square. Well, bum bum bum... I finally had one last month! Ahh, sweet indulgence.\n\nI ordered the warm brownie sundae ($8.95). It comes with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, a square of warm brownie, hot \"homemade\" fudge, whipped cream, chopped almonds, and a cherry on top. The brownie was my favorite part of the concoction because it was soft and fudgey!

I think the sundaes are the best, the milkshakes are really good but I prefer slightly lighter milkshakes than they serve here. Its very touristy here and theres a line to order, and then you have to go find a table. The downstairs lobby is really full but theres an upstairs seating area if you can't find a spot. Luckily we found a spot. \n\nThe seating area is a little less than charming and I wish they could do something to spruce it up. But if you come here just for the ice cream you'll be fine. We ordered some sort of mint chocolate sundae, I believe it was called Mint Bliss, and it ran somewhere around 10 dollars. Definitely pricey. It was a huge sundae though and my friend and I both split it without wishing we had more. \n\nThey give you a number to place on your table, and then you get to wait a while and they bring out your ice cream. My other friend accidently said he wanted his to go, so he got to wait at the to go bar for his. He got his ice cream and found our table about 10 minutes before we got ours. We watched a waiter walk by with a mint bliss ice cream, look straight at our number, and keep walking. At this point we had already been waiting over 10 minutes but we just guessed they were really behind and it must have been someone elses. Well we waited, and waited and waited and still no ice cream. Finally THE SAME WAITER who had passed us by already shows up and drops our ice cream off. I'm guessing for some reason maybe our number didn't register to him when he looked at it, and he continued to search around and go upstairs and then finally back downstairs to give us the ice cream. We waited around 20 minutes for our ice cream and by the time we got ours, our friend was basically finished with his. To top it off our ice cream was MELTED due to the fact our waiter was a space cadet. If it wasn't so stinking slow I would have gone back and requested another one but we didn't have time to wait. Glad we paid over 10 dollars for melted ice cream. Granted it was delicious, but still.\n\nI have been here a few times previously and always loved it and got my ice cream in a timely manner, and it was never melted. I'm going to contribute this flop to the waiter - which is unfortunate that one persons error can really dampen my experience so much. But the ice cream would have been good otherwise.\n\nYou do get a free chocolate sample if you walk through the store so thats a bonus. They have a few specials on chocolate too, and a very comprehensive selection of the chocolate flavors, variety packs, and different sizes. So thats worth checking out before you grab your ice cream.\n\nOverally I'm still giving this place 4 stars because I've really enjoyed it on all of my other visits, and I'm not going to completely knock it because this one waiter couldn't get us our ice cream in a timely manner. 2 stars for my last visit, but 4 stars overall.", "author": "Kerri J."}

I wanted fresh blueberries instead since I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but it was a no-can-do since the blueberries have already been covered.

Sundaes are incomplete for me without peanuts.\nBest dessert I have ever eaten, since it has both cheesecake and strawberries ... my favorites. The layer of whipped cream is pretty thick, but once you get past it, there's vanilla ice-cream and strawberries. So good! Then ... and here's my favorite part ... at the bottom there's cheesecake.

Top that with nuts, whipped cream and a cherry. You simply can't ask for anything more. \n\nThere's a choice between milk or dark hot fudge.

Maybe he's still making the second one and forgot the cap? So we waited and waited and they were finally putting drinks on the counter but they called them out for her brother. He skipped my drink and her cousins order and went straight to the last one? He then deleted our order off of their order screen and that was when we got frustrated.. We complained and told the worker that he hasn't given us our pumpkin latte yet and that he deleted our order without finishing it. He told us, \"yeah I did, I called it out for Ricky\" Ricky is her brother, and we were like \"uh yeah that was for Ricky not us\" and he goes \"well that one was supposed to be for you\" whaaat? No it wasn't.. He finally made my pumpkin latte and surprisingly enough, it didn't even taste like pumpkin! It just tasted like a regular latte.. Whatever..

It's a great place to make some great memories with your children.  We recently went to the Chocolate Festival.  Tremendous fun.  However, there are weirdoes all over SF.  We are from the 'burbs, and over there, we are more relaxed.  I had my purse with me at all times, but at one point, an off leash dog was running amok near my child.  I instinctively stood up and ran to my child leaving a chocolate treat on top of my Choco Festival brochure/ticket and my child's shoes.  I was away from my little pile on the grass for not longer than 10 seconds and someone stole the Chocolate Festival ticket/brochure.  Shame on them.  They just took the brochure, and let my choco treat drop to the grass, and left my child's shoes behind too.  I was about to call the police, who were there for the event, but mainly just chatted with one another.\n\nI went back to the ticket booth to report the crime and hoped to get another ticket as replacement with the number of treats I have redeemed marked off.  By that time, we consumed 3 out of 15 samples.  The girl there didn't want to give me another ticket even though I identify the original volunteer who helped with my ticket purchase.  She was nice but wouldn't budge.  Neither would I.  I just said to call the police over and I will do my report on the spot...in front of everyone, then buy another ticket.  \n\nThen, she relented and gave me another ticket with my three samples marked off.  \n\nBut overall, she was very nice, and I was honest, so all was well.

Also, I find that my visitors often seem to be more impressed by Kara's Cupcakes nearby. \n\nI would suggest that if you or someone you have with you appreciates dark chocolate, head for TCHO.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

We were eating at Off the Grid in Fort Mason, but were craving some dessert. I automatically thought of Ghirardelli, since it's always been one of my favorite spots to go to in the city - the area is beautiful and has such a rich history behind it.\n\nWe fortunately came at a time before the dinner rush and ordered a Cookie Bottom Sundae ($8.95), which is a cookie topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. I asked the lady to knock off the nuts, and she asked us if it was \"preference or allergy\". This kind of surprised us, and i didn't really see the point in that, but we answered her and found a seat. When the sundae came, the nuts were still on top, but fortunately it was pretty easy to scoop them all off. The ice cream was delicious, and the cookie and hot fudge were to die for. The taste contrast between hot and cold (hot fudge, hot cookie, cold ice cream) was soooo goood.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty nice, the colors and decor remind me of a classic 50s style place to eat. There's an upstairs area too with another chocolate shop. The only bad thing is that there's no bathroom inside, so in order to do your business, you have to walk out and across the plaza to a public restroom. Which is not too shabby, but for lazy people like me it can be a trek.\n\nI've been here a good amount of times, but I never noticed that there was a little display in the way back of the dining area where they describe the chocolate making process. It's a display with real machines from the original factory, as well as just vats of liquid chocolate. Just looking at this display made my mouth water, so make sure that you stop by the back and check it out while you're there!", "author": "Caitlin C."}

Also, the restaurant always smells like wet mop and quite honestly, I am not a fan of that.\n\nI am am fan, however, of everything I have eaten here.

I went on one of these each of the years I was in high school. The first year, I established a bit of a tradition upon arriving in the wharf area: I would go to the Ghirardelli shop for a deep, rich chocolate shake, then go upstairs to the Boudin shop and get a bay shrimp sandwich. That combination, despite many lovely meals in SF, came to sum up what I figured the city should taste like.\n\nSadly, both the Boudin shop at Ghirardelli Square and the sandwich are gone. We stopped by several of the Boudin Cafes - now ubiquitous in the city - and ended up eating at none of them. I guess the lack of my favorite dish soured me.\n\nBut, I couldn't pass up the shake.\n\nSince my time in high school, I've become much more selective about the chocolate I eat. This is due mostly to the excellent chocolate tasting class taught by Matt Caputo at Tony Caputo's Market and Deli as well as a lot of tasting and reading of my own. I expected going in, therefore, that the weight of my current snobbery would overcome any fondness from my formative years. Wrong.\n\nIs the chocolate flavor a one-note samba? Yes. It didn't matter. The thick, rich shake reminded me of all of the reasons that I prefer dark chocolate to other kinds. We shared the shake, but even as stuffed as I was, I could have eaten a second on my own happily.", "author": "Ryan C."}

Thus, I definitely recommend AGAINST coming here if you're looking for a place to grab a relaxing cup of coffee or sit down for some ice cream with friends. It's so loud that you wouldn't be able to carry a conversation at a reasonable decibel. Venue: 2/5\n\nHowever, IF you're a tourist, you should at least come and explore. They have a cute little display showing how chocolate is made. AND I DEFINITELY recommend their Caramel Latte! I almost NEVER drink coffee, and I never developed a liking for it. It was my brother who got the Caramel latte, but it tasted so good that I practically stole the drink from him. I felt as if I was ingesting only the aroma of coffee without all the bitterness. With every gulp, you MUST sip in a bit of that caramel whipped cream to get a perfect blend of that creamy, caramel, coffee goodness. Caramel latte: 5/5!\n\nThe sea salt hot chocolate is pretty good too! However, it's quite sweet, so getting a small size might be a good idea. And DO NOT, I repeat, do NOT drinking the bottom. Once you hit the bottom of the drink, all you have left is a bit of hot chocolate saturated with sea salt. Gross... Sea salt hot chocolate: 3.5/5.\n\nLastly, the ice cream isn't bad either.

You have your choice of of picking up some some sweets from the large variety they offer from their shop, or sit down next door in the Fountain In for a rich and creamy ice cream treat. Why let the tourist enjoy all the free samples, and rich delicacies?\n\n     It's almost Halloween and they are handing out free pumpkin spice caramel squares as you walk in. Why not indulge your senses with the sweet velvety goodness of premium milk chocolate embracing the rich luxurious flavor of exquisite caramel, inspired with pumpkin spices. They also have a lot of the usual varieties, as well as gift options available for sale.\n\n     The choices of ice cream concoctions were a bit limited, but I was a bit disappointed when my sundae finally made it's grand appearance. It was lacking in both grandeur and richness. It was good, just not $9 good. More like $5-6 dollars good. I guess they must add a few bucks due to the tourist trap factor. It did not portray the picture on the menu any justice.\n\n     The Chocolates and its' respective store deserves a a full five stars for the service, quality, variety, and over all goodness.

However, because this place is such a tourist destination, I feel like it's not quite as nice an experience as other Ghirardelli chocolate shops.   They have a few scattered around the country and I've been to the ones in Vegas & Miami Beach and maybe one other city.  At those stores you have a nice experience - you walk in, walk right up to the counter & place your order, sit down, and your sundae is brought out to you.   \n\nHere the experience is a little different.  You walk in, wait on a long line to order, pay your $10 for your sundae, and then realize there are no tables to sit at.  The whole place is incredibly crowded and loud, and you normally have to stalk tables for 5-10 minutes before finding a place to sit.  Tables are dirty, and even once people have left them, it takes awhile for the staff to come clean them up.  \n\nThe sundaes are of course the big draw, and I feel like the last couple times I've come here they've been sub-par.   One time, they screwed up and added nuts when I said I didn't want them.  This most recent time, the order was correct but the sundae was so badly mixed that by the time I got down to the hot fudge there was no ice cream left.\n\nIf I were being brutally honest I'd probably give it 2 stars, just because the other Ghirardelli shops are so much better.

I sat on a bench to eat my ice cream, and I saw maybe ten people the whole time.  For once, I wished that there were more people present, even (gasp) other tourists, to make it more interesting.

This is not an ideal setup.  I really don't like having to fight for seating.  I actually would have preferred to wait in a line to be seated.  That would have been the less frustrating and fair way to obtain a table.

Maybe call ahead to see how crowded they are.\n2.  If there is a long line, leave one person in line to order, and send scouts in ahead to look for seating.  I was unable to do this, because my BF was stuck in another long line for the restroom.  :(\n3.  If it's a cold night, and you absolutely have to have an ice cream fix, then bring layers.

Our visitors from Georgia had this place on their \"must experience\" list, so we fought the crowds at Ghiradelli Square to stand in a line about 30 - 40 people long to order ice cream sundaes (starting at $9) and hot chocolate.  We were given our number in a little stand to put on our table and released to find a table.  Complete chaos.  \n\nThe three rooms of dining area inside (two downstairs and one upstairs) were packed with people - people sitting at tables and layers of people standing over them clenching their little numbers waiting for them to leave.  After several laps of all rooms and squeezing through crowds, we finally found a table with one chair to share between 7 of us outside in the cold.  \n\nServers walk around with trays of ice cream looking for the corresponding order numbers in all indoor and outdoor dining areas.  They seem frazzled, overwhelmed, overworked.  \n\nThe sundaes we ordered arrived melted (the hot fudge and hot caramel no longer hot, and the ice cream quickly turning liquid) and the hot cocoas were lukewarm.  \n\nI understand this spot is catering to tourists who long for the Ghiradelli experience, but changing to this method of service (I'm pretty sure it used to operate like a restaurant where you were seated and served a decade or two ago) smacks of pure greed.\n\nThe chocolate shop, however, seems well stocked and organized.

The door that I went through had 3 cashiers all taking orders so the lines were minimal and the order process was efficient. Although there were 3 of us, I still only ordered a single hot fudge sundae made from their dark chocolate - $8,.50.  Then I waited for the sundae inside where they called my name when it was ready after about 15 minutes. \n\nThe sundae was in a 6\" high clear plastic cup with two huge scoops of rich vanilla ice cream intermingled with hot dark chocolate fudge sauce and topped with whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry. True to Daughter's word, it was good. When I first got the sundae, I contemplated ordering another one, but really the size was perfect for the three of us adults. I probably would have been able to almost finish one on my own, but would have regretted it later. \n\nWe enjoyed sharing it outdoors in their patio area where there were plenty of tables as well as steps where you can sit and people watch.

Although it is a haven for tourists, locals can appreciate the history of Ghirardelli Square and can't help but stop by and order a sundae with friends or some hot cocoa on a cold night after visiting the Wharf or Pier 39. Since it is a tourist destination, be prepared for long lines during good weather or during the holiday season. The lines tend to go out the door on some days, which is why a couple steps out the door you've got a menu to read from so you know what to order once you get inside. If you do manage to go inside and order up, make sure you have someone to save you a seat because those are snatched up within milliseconds. Just a warning.\n\nAlthough it is pricey, you get a huge serving that you can share with another or if you're that hungry and greedy, you can finish it all yourself.

Ghirardelli is a definitely an item to checkoff the list while in SF, but what I am confused about is why on earth Ghirardelli wouldn't take better advantage of this tourist attraction and expand their chocolate and ice cream shop in order to accommodate those massive crowds, especially during the summer.\n\nBOTH times I have been here the lines has been ridiculous, and not the \"you gotta have this\" type-of-ridiculous, but more of the \"this is insane, a fire hazard, why isn't this place setup better, it's a cluster, expand the restaurant to accommodate the crowds, have a flow to the restaurant, what are the managers doing, did you get your order yet because I've been waiting for 45 minutes, the servers just dumped out ANOTHER order of hot chocolate that was sent back for being \"cold\" hot chocolate, woah a table just opened so an elephant stampede of strollers, purses, bags with souvenirs, keys, flip flops (for those tourists that thought SF is a tropical location) and all sorts of items going flying towards the table to claim it\" type-of-ridiculous.\n\nDuring my second visit, I observed this place for AN HOUR while I waited for my one sundae and hot chocolate order that NEVER came.  The servers are wonderful and I can tell they work hard, but someone needs to let them know that a hot chocolate should not be made and sit out for 20 minutes until the sundaes are complete.  Nobody wants \"luke warm chocolate\" with their hot fudge sundaes.. it ruins the magic of the whole thing that you just paid top dollar for.\n\nWith that being said, who is responsible for directing the servers?  The management.  During my hour observation, I noticed that a girl manager was wandering around just filling napkin dispensers and trying to avoid the angry mob of customers waiting for their treats.  As a manager myself, you have staff that can do those mediocre tasks; YOU are responsible for the entire function of the restaurant, including your customers' experiences, your staff's tasks, the quality of the food, the safety of your guests and staff, creating a fun environment where people want to continually spend money and tell their friends, family and coworkers in order for your business to be successful and grow even more.  The younger guy manager did end up refunding me my money after he looked at his watch and the time stamp on my bill, but he barely took the time to listen to a word I said.  It wasn't worth a fight... I was tired, hungry and disappointed in the whole experience... WHICH IS THE WORST THING YOU COULD HEAR AS A MANAGER.\n\nI guess Ghirardelli just expects that their brand name is a good enough and it probably does make them a lot of money... but there are ways to make MORE $$ with some changes to one of the biggest attractions in SF.  I'll fix it.. hire me as your senior manager. ;)", "author": "Baylee P."}

What a waste. Knowing that it's a popular destination, I didn't mind waiting in line for about 10 minutes. However, I did mind waiting for 10 minutes only to find out the item I wanted to get (one of the Painted Ladies) was sold out, and they couldn't be bothered to mark it on the \"menu\" out front. Fine. I quickly looked over the menu as the cashier rolled his eyes at me (because I was supposed to intuitively know they were out of what I wanted) and placed my order. We managed to luck out and get a table outside which seemed like a great way to pass the time. Unfortunately, I instead passed the time waiting in line again because the cashier forgot to ring up one of our coffees. Thank goodness I was able to go to the other cashier who not only walked back and got the coffee herself but didn't charge me for it either. However, even that didn't make up for what we received.\n\nWhen our Painted Lady came out, we excitedly dug in, only to find that more than half of the tall sundae glass was filled with whipped cream that tasted off. Two small dollops of ice cream and two small layers of chocolate fudge are not worth the $10. Splitting this was almost a joke, but we tried to make the best of it because neither of us wanted to wait in line again. I alternated it with my luke-warm cappuccino (which is the temp it came out as) just to give it some flavor (not that it tasted much better).\n\nOverall, I didn't have incredibly high expectations for this place going into it since it is a giant tourist destination. The wait and crowds were understandable. However, the attitude of the first cashier, the joke of a towering whipped cream sundae, and the forgotten/room temp coffees were way below what I had expected. It became the running joke of the rest of our trip. Hopefully they can up their game for the other tourists who get suckered into this place.", "author": "k a."}

I was tempted by various other shops like Ben and Jerry's, ColdStone, and dare I say Godiva, but I knew what was in store for me if only I walked just a little bit further and low and behold there it was. My little Chocolate Heaven - Ghiradellis Chocolate and Ice Cream Shop. \n\nWhen I walked in I was overwhelmed on what I should have. Everything looked and smelled soooo delicious. I decided to take baby steps into this decision. First I had to choose either an ice cream sundae or a shake. It was a nice day out and I wanted to continue to walk around, so I decided to go for the shake. Then it was what kind of shake. I opted for the Nob Hill Chill - Vanilla ice cream, with dark chocolate syrup and chocolate chips on top. Man was I not disappointed. It was outrageous!!!

Out of town guest or a group of suburban kids -- it has always been a memorable way to finish our day of showing off SF.\n\nWe made it to the Original Ghirardelli's after a crowded day touring the city.  The amazing thing is that there wasn't the standard long line out the door into the courtyard.  I thought we were lucky to hit it right, but it was actually a shame.\n\nThe reason we had no line is that Ghirardelli must have changed it's operation.  The cashiers who took our orders zipped us through - rudely.  We ordered with a sense of panic.  Our guests didn't even have time to look at the menu - we just pointed to pictures and said that one.  We had barely paid, when the casher yelled, \"Next ready customer.\"  People were jumping line to get in front of others who had no idea how to order without a menu.\n\nThen we entered the table area with our order number.  All the tables were taken, which is normal, but there were 2 or 3 groups standing with their order number for every table.  The line that used to stretch outside, now fills up the aisles inside -- both upstairs and downstairs!  To get a table you need to become slightly aggressive and hover over other tables that appear to be leaving soon.  \n\nThe best strategy became to ask a table that was eating if you could put your order number on the table while they were eating. Honestly, it took that long to get the order that the previous patrons would be gone by the time your order arrived.  \n\nI can't believe that they are allowed to operate this way.  it was so crowded  that the staff couldn't navigate around.  \n\nAs for the Sundaes, I've always found them overpriced for what you get.

Grab a menu & know what you want before getting to the cashier.\n\nThe last time the bf & i went here, we shared \"the cable car\" (rocky road/chocolate chip/chocolate ice cream covered in hot fudge/marshmallow cream/whipped cream.) We sat by the machines that churn (is that the right word?!) gallons of chocolate. You give yourself a self guided tour, which explains how they make chocolate, sit down with your number and a few minutes later, one of their staff in the striped apron finds you and delivers your huge ice cream order.\n\nThis is a great place to bring out of towners; I always bring my LA based friends here and they love it. The parlor is always bustling with excited tourists and children on a sugar high. It's a fun place to consume really quality ice cream and shakes.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

While trying to find a table my friends and I were yelled at by other customers who said they got to our table first!  Luckily we found one and were able to enjoy our treats. \n\nTheir menu has a wide variety of shakes and sundaes. I got the hot fudge sundae in a waffle bowl, one of my friends got the banana split sundae, and another got a brownie sundae.  While reviewing the menu before ordering, we had really wanted to get the enormous $30 sundae with multiple ice cream flavors to share but decided no because of the cost. Well, each of our own sundaes cost $10 so if you are going with a group you may just want to get the enormous one! We were sad we didn't.\n\nThe sundae was awesome, but if you are a normal person you may want to get the kids size.

Simple as that.  The place can get pretty packed and seating can be hard to find but they have a second floor which accommodates the overflow from the main restaurant.

Chocolate and sugar don't have to go hand-in-hand, but Ghirardelli obviously doesn't see it that way.  Instead of maybe pairing a bit of salt with the chocolate (a wonderful combination), or maybe just toning down the sugar a bit and letting the flavor of their chocolate work itself to the surface, everything is just absolutely overwhelmed by sugar.\n\nI went here with two friends, and we ordered the Cable Car (rocky road ice cream covered in chocolate and whipped cream), a brownie, a drinking chocolate (they ran out of their biscotti that's supposed to go with it, but still charged us full-price), a sea salt caramel hot cocoa, and a mocha.\n\nThe drinking chocolate was actually good, I'll give this place that much credit.  It wasn't too sweet, it was nice and strong, a perfect sipping dessert.  The brownie was decent, but wasn't anything special like you'd expect from a chocolate maker.  Things really went bad after that, though.  The mocha was overly sweet, like someone accidentally dumped a few heaping tablespoons of sugar in there - my friend couldn't finish it.  My sea salt caramel hot cocoa, which I ordered because I absolutely adore pairing salt with chocolate, was horrendous.  I couldn't taste caramel, I couldn't taste salt.  All I could taste was frothy milk, chocolate, and - you guessed it - a ton of sugar.  After a few sips (less than 1/5th of my drink), I gave up and stopped drinking, opting for water.\n\nFinally, the biggest disappointment was the Cable Car.  Being a big fan of ice cream, I figured three of us splitting this one small dish would be pretty easy.  It was so overly sweet, so ridiculously rich, that the three of us didn't even get half of it done.  So for a grand total, three adults split one brownie and less than half a sundae, and the only decent drink was the drinking chocolate.  And even then, split between the three of us, I felt physically sick afterwords from the sugar high.\n\nI couldn't help but imagine a group of people coming here, each getting their own drinks and desserts, and each actually finishing them.  So much sugar just disgusted me to the point that I couldn't give this place a positive review - again, chocolate does NOT equal sugar.  When I go to a chocolate maker, I want to taste the chocolate, I want to experience the raw and dark flavors, not the sugar and high fructose corn syrup poured on top to satisfy the masses.\n\nAll this, after waiting for over a half an hour in line, guaranteed Ghirardelli got the bottom-rung on my reviews.  This is absolutely a tourist trap, and unless you're a hummingbird low on sugar, I'd suggest you steer clear.", "author": "Garrett P."}

If they sold the recipe I would be making a batch every week. \n\nNow let me just warn those of you who consider yourselves self proclaimed \"cookie monsters\"- this is not your average chocolate chip cookie. It is not moist and gooey, so if that is what you judge a cookie by, you should go for their intensely chocolate brownie instead (its very good). But if you want to gnaw on your cookie and enjoy a crunchy outside and incredibly dense chewy inside, GET THIS COOKIE, you're in for a treat. Also get a glass of milk cause you're gonna need it. I take days to eat it. Yes, its that big.\n\nThe rest of the place I'd give 2 stars, because it is touristy as hell, you can buy their chocolate squares anywhere, and not only is the ice cream shop service slow as hell, what comes out to you is not very good either.

First, I will add the caveat that I am pretty sensitive to processed food. After about five bites of my sundae, my stomach started to revolt, and I had to stop eating. As for the taste/etc. of the sundae (before I stopped), the whipped cream tasted like sweet cardboard, there was too little ice cream (and it was not good quality ice cream), and the chocolate sauce in my sundae was congealed and overpowering.\n\nGive me homemade ice cream at a local shop any day.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

I love sugary anything and I'm the type of person who could eat dessert before a meal or replace my actual meal with dessert, but this sundae was too much even for me. Also overpriced as well. As soon as I ate half of it, I couldn't go any further anymore because I felt so nauseous. I couldn't even move. This dessert is not worth the calories or the sad feeling of guilt the morning after. After consuming this last night, I am riding out a chocolate chocolate hangover because of this sugar bomb from last night. Save your money unless you like ice-cream soup and aching arteries!

In this time I have never been to Alcatraz, Angel Island, the TransAmerica Building or Ghiradelli Chocolate. I've been to Ghiradelli Square (Buena Vista for Irish Coffee of course) so I'm not like a total complete anti-tourist trap freak. Just pretty much so. I talk to people I don't know for a living, so no need for me to be tourist friendly as well, that's how I see it. However, my aversion of all things tourist has apparently precluded me from Ghiradelli ice cream sundaes so now I'm a little pissed. I guess I could write a letter to someone in the mayor's office requesting a special \"No Tourists Allowed Day\" at Ghiradelli but since Gavin has recently forced his whole administration to resign I suppose that is a moot point.\n\nI'm off subject, sorry. Brain Freeze.\n\nAnyway, remember when you were a little kid and your mom did something totally off the wall like serving you waffles for dinner? And you thought \"wow, this is just about as good as it gets.\" Well, on the dinner menu tonight at our house was hot fudge sundaes. This was the request. It wasn't even  my idea, but I thought it was a good one.\n\nSo, not wanting to actually \"cook\" the hot fudge sundaes, we thought long and hard as to where to go and ended up at Ghiradelli.\n\nGreat choice, super good and kind of a fun dinner date (assuming you aren't actually expecting diner). I had the Very Berry Sundae and the boy had the Hot Fudge Sundae. The store was actually almost empty - I guess the tourist only come on the weekends. Everyone that works there is really friendly and overly nice.

It's ice cream, so yeah it'll melt if left out too long. I would think most of us would like to eat our ice cream BEFORE it melts into some watery mess. So this place being crowded, the staff takes awhile before they can find you and by the time you get your ice cream everything has melted away. You wonder if you've ordered ice cream or a smoothie.

I understand that the glasses are warm because they just came out of the dishwasher, but can't they get more glasses and put the warm ones in the fridge? I don't want to drink the ice cream.\n\n2) After you order, you put the metal like hanger thing with your number on the table, and the busboys look for the number to bring you your order. Bad, bad idea! The place gets pretty crowded and the busboys have a difficult time finding the number in the ENTIRE Ghirardelli's. I am an observer, as any psychology student, and I saw the worried and troubled looks on some of the busboys faces when they just couldn't find the customers.\n\nI remember seeing a busboy tell the guy behind the counter that he couldn't bring the ice cream to the person because it melted to a great extent (he couldn't find where the customers were sitting), but the guy who made the ice cream responded with something like \"I already made it twice, I can't make it again, find them!\"\n\nAdvice for the staff/manager: First, find out where the customers are sitting, and THEN make the ice cream (hopefully the people won't switch seats. haha). OR, seat customers yourself. You'll save yourself the trouble of walking around the whole place for 10 min or more while the vanilla-chocolate-caramel goodness melts away on your tray. In other words, this place might need waiter service.\n\n3) Advice for the customer: After making an order (especially if you and your friends ordered together), make sure that all of the orders are on the receipt. Tonight, one of the cashiers forgot to enter my order. After we realized this and approached her, she didn't even apologize and just took the order as though she didn't do anything wrong.

Now it is just the basic descriptions that match your sundaes:  raspberries and hot fudge sundae, for example.\n\nThe set-up is a little different now and actually is not as well-designed as it used to be.  The way the counter is set up totally breaks the single-file line apart and of course, all hell breaks loose as you try to approach the counter.  After that, it is the same mad dash to the first available table where you can victoriously plant your order number.  They still have the waiters and waitresses wandering around with deer-in-headlights expressions as they try to hunt down your number.\n\nThe old-fashioned hot fudge sundae is my favorite.  And the fact that it can now be ordered with DARK CHOCOLATE FUDGE makes it even better.  I usually substitute chocolate chip ice-cream for the plain vanilla scoop.  There is something so amazing about the whipped cream and the sprinkled nuts on top.

Here, the tourists are fleeced for the \"famous SF chocolate\" & ice cream. You're better off going to Mitchell's Ice Cream or the St. Francis Ice Cream Fountain (both in the Mission). \n\nUsed to be you could get table service. For a while now, you stand in line outside (mooo! ), then grab a menu and order and pay just inside the door. They give you a number, which you then take into the dining room, where you scan for an empty table.  Next, you hope to catch the eye of a waitron, and beg them to clean your table.  After a while, your melted ice cream sundae will be brought to you. Our waitron dropped plastic spoons onto the table (yech!), and walked off, even though they have long-handled metal spoons designed to reach into sundae glasses. We had to walk up to the counter to get them. We saw the great service was extended to others there, for example, the elderly guy w/ the \"Retired US Air Force\" ballcap who asked a 20ish waitron dude if he could use his rag to wash off his family's table.  The waitron grunted assent, and the USAF dude washed down the table while the waitron stood there watching him in amazement, something like 'huh, so that's how you clean a table' flashing across his face. You'd think this place would train their workers, or keep on only those who know how to treat paying customers. This is pathetic.  \n\nOh, yeah.  The ice cream?  Only so-so.

They were handing out their new Peanut Butter Squares to try and they were fabulous! If you love peanut butter like I do, this will become one of your favorites! Now that I think about it again, I want more! ^_^ It's even better than Reese's Peanut Butter Cup because of the real nuts inside and rich filling that's enveloped in rich Ghiradelli chocolate. **drool drool**\n\nThere were very few people around in Ghiradelli Square because it's a week day. The only place that had any signs of life was Ghiradelli. Once you enter you will see a bunch of people enjoying cold desserts. The service was friendly and quick. Ms. Lin and I shared a Caramel Sundae, but we changed the Vanilla ice cream to Kona Coffee ice cream. The ice cream was flavorful, although the whole thing was melting when it came to us. I didn't like the caramel because it was way too sweet for my palette. If it were up to me, I would have gotten the mint or peanut butter sundae.\n\nAll in all it was good and an experience that one must do when they are at Ghiradelli Square. I have to say the price is definitely not worth it, but the experience is why you go. Now I want to go back to get Kara's cupcakes and buy more of the yummy peanut butter chocolate they gave away.

There was an insane line everywhere - a line to buy a sundae, a line to get into the store, a line to find seating, a long line at the bathroom...you get my point. It is not worth your time if you're only in SF for a short vacation. It's pandamonium. The store doesn't mark down its ghiradelli at all - in fact we found the same prices for the chocolate at the SF airport. The building is standard, nothing special to look at. So don't bother spending time on this if you have other things you want to see on your visit.

Granted the selection is limited, but you're so confused you can't luxuriate in the ice cream possibilities. \"Um... hot fudge?\" you stammer, not knowing what else to say. You're given a number on a big metal stand. You don't get instructions, just the number and the stand. Now you can wander around and try to find a table. Only there are no tables available, and there are about 25 other people wandering around looking for tables. It's like the mall parking lot at noon on December 24th.

The gigantic Ghirardelli sign in bright lights is like our Hollywood sign, calling out to tourists, we welcome you! And to natives, we're always here for you!\r\n\r\nYeah, yeah, it's a big tourist draw, but that shouldn't keep you from indulging in their sweet treats. It's like if you've never walked across the Golden Gate Bridge - you're missing out on one of our city's treasures. \r\n\r\nThe first time I took my fiancee to the ice cream shop three years ago on one of our first dates, was his very first time there. When he asked me what Ghirardelli was, I was like, \"Are you serious? You've NEVER heard of Ghirardelli and you grew up in the bay area? You're WEIRD!\" That of course caused a bit of tension, but a huge brownie sundae made everything better. \r\n\r\nLast night, we decided to head into touristville and had dinner at Fisherman's Wharf and dessert at Ghiradelli. There was a short line out the door, but the wait was not long. When we got up to order, free chocolate squares awaited us. We got one $7 brownie sundae, took our number, and found a table in the corner by the window. The sundae was brought out to us and we dove right in. You really have to hurry and eat because the ice cream has a layer of chocolate fudge in the middle and everything quickly becomes melted and gooey, which is the only problem. It's so good though, and the fudge is surprisingly not as rich as I remembered it to be. The chunck of brownie, which is more like fudge, is also not that rich either - it's actually perfectly sweet and won't make your tooth ache. Be prepared to walk out of there with a bloated tummy though. (Kristina, I know you are laughing in your devilish way right now... muahahahaha EAT MORE GHIRARDELLI SUNDAES!!)\r\n\r\nThe annual Ghiradelli chocolate festival, usually in September, is a fun event to go to.

It was a scoop vanilla ice cream, a small piece cheese cake, some blue berry shaped candy, some mixed berry jam and lots of whip cream. I could taste just sugar and heavy cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-09-27", "description": "The Ghiradelli Ice Cream store has always been a favorite place for myself and my family to visit whenever we felt like having delicious sundaes- growing up, I remember getting the 'Cable Car' sundae on numerous occasions after going through the store so I could get my free sample of chocolate.  So, when a good friend came to visit and expressed interest in visiting this location, I was raring to go and have some ice cream and hot fudge as well.\n\nLuckily, we went on a weekday afternoon and the place was relatively free of the hordes that I usually see when I visit at night.  We decided on splitting the hot fudge banana sundae- a classic that should have sated both the ice cream and chocolate cravings.  Unfortunately, I experienced BIG disappointment when it came to the vanilla ice cream, because it was full of ice crystals.  Not that it prevented me from eating the sundae, but it deflated my enthusiasm for it and made me kinda embarrassed that my friend was eating icy ice cream in this famous SF place.  I would have thought that with as much business as they do here that vanilla ice cream (the basis for the vast majority of their sundaes) would never sit around long enough to have accumulated ice crystals.  The hot fudge was still as good as ever, but I think they have reduced how much they put on the sundae.  I remember it dripping all over the place but now it stays very neatly contained inside the glass.  \n\nIn any case, 5 stars for the memories of previous visits and 2 stars for this last visit- $8+ for this sundae was an atrocity when I could have gone over to Ben and Jerry's for a sundae with better ice cream.  I'm sure that I'd still be back though, just because I do have fond memories of the place, so hopefully, my next sundae here will restore my faith in Ghiradelli.", "author": "Angela H."}

I've never wandered in here without guests from out-of-town in tow, probably because this is an area of town I generally avoid unless, of course, I have out-of-town guests in tow. No matter who's manufacturing it these days, the ice cream is still a terrific base for hot fudge, whipped cream, and a sprinkling of nuts, or all by itself in a sturdy waffle cone.

Once I got there, I had decided to get something hot (like hot chocolate or cocoa) because it was absolutely freezing. Hiep went into the ice cream shop and I decided to get a banana chocolate sundae along with a small hot cocoa. It was expensive, but worth it, I think. Ghiradelli is always rather reliable with great chocolate. The sundae glasses looked intimidating, but it really isn't much in terms of ice cream and other dessert. The main problem was overflow, which meant that whenever I pushed down on the ice cream, the cream at the bottom would rise up and overflow out of the glass. Hiep had the brilliant idea to eat from the bottom up, which would then reduce the overflow. Great stuff.

Personally, I like the \"milk chocolate\" hot fudge (which used to be the only hot fudge option).  It's warm, sweet (but not too sweet), and creamy.  Pour that hot fudge on top of a few simple scoops of vanilla ice cream, top it all off with whipped cream, nuts, and a cherry, and you're in dessert heaven!  Sure, tourists flock here; but even if you're a local, I recommend satisfying your ice cream fix here every now and then.  (I do.)", "author": "Sophrosyne Y."}

Winner.\n\nMy strongest memories are as follows\n1. Visiting from out of town when I was about 8 and egging our driver to drive fast over the hills to get to my awaiting sundae terrifying the adults of our over packed car.  MAKE IT FLY!\n\n2. Many a visit at night perched on some overlooking, probably not legal or safe to be around area of the square enjoying my sundae, listing to my ipod and checking out the view.\n\nBecause walking from Union Street to Ghirardelli Square justifies having one of the spectacular, never skimping on the hot fudge sundaes, as dinner, at 10pm.  I'm sure it becomes crazy 'amusement park long lines' tourist central during daylight hours, but I usually stick to later hours\n\nThere was a time I could eat whole pizzas in one sitting but alas I have satiety now.  I always get my sundae to go, eat half in the outdoor square area and half at 3am.\n\nFun for all ages!", "author": "Lisa E."}

The sundaes just don't have the same taste when I first came to one of the ghirardelli cafes for dessert in southern california.  First the ice cream isn't that great.  It lacks substance.  Second, the desserts seem to be made then left to sit and melt for awhile before being served.  Third, the waffle cone was not crisp and crunchy as it should have been.  It felt soft and stale.  I will say that the place is a great way to buy up on the ghirardelli chocolates and baking essentials, but I think you could find better desserts in the area if you're more of the discerning type when it comes to higher quality.", "author": "Thomas C."}

I really like this place. Their ice cream is delicious and the price is pretty much what you would expect. We ordered the earthquake for 8 people because it comes with 8 scoops for only 24.95, which includes bananas and other toppings. The line looks long, but it's pretty efficient because you order it and then take your number to your table. The only downside is the that the staff is all international, therefore when we asked for bowls, we got plates after some work at explanations.
