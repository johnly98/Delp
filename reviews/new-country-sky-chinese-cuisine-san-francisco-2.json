Also really hits the spot when you're in the mood for unhealthy comfort food. Their pork dumplings are a good substitute for peking ravioli - an appetizer unique to Boston (if you're really interested in food look up the NPR story about Boston Chinese food- I promise I'm not totally crazy). I also like their crab rangoon, chow mein, and general tso's. I've only had delivery from here so I can't speak to the experience of a sit down meal. \n\nThat being said if you grew up with authentic Chinese food you are unlikely to agree with me and would probably rate it 3/5 stars.", "author": "Emma B."}

Turns out this is a super popular dish with an interesting story even though the documentary was more about the general history of Chinese food in the USA. I would recommend checking it out.\n\nBack to New Country Sky, after watching the documentary I had a craving to try General Tso's Chicken and so got on to Yelp to find my local place. The chicken was delicious and a complete comfort food, I can imagine myself growing old and fat just living on the deep fried saucy goodness. Although this is the first time I have tried it so maybe there is better stuff out there. I am now on a mission to try it everywhere.\n\nThe other food was average, fried rice was good, house special fried rice not as good, dumplings okay, egg rolls were suspiciously spring roll looking (have a feeling the order got mixed up), chow mein noodles were greasy but lacking flavor to justify the greasiness and I have a feeling my fortune cookie won't come true!\n\nAlso delivery took less than 15 minutes when it was quoted as 45-60 min!", "author": "Tristan L."}

Food is hot when it arrives. There's the occasional mix up here and there with drink items, however, I always have my food. I am a little bummed out they don't deliver through Eat24/GrubHub anymore, but the website is just fine for ordering, I've never had problems with it.\n\nI'm just now reading about this new ownership/name controversy... and I noticed a review about Tai Chi having some health inspection issues. I did some surface level digging (Checking out Tai Chi on Yelp) and checked out their Health Scores. It seems like the health scores have been consistently on the up with past violations corrected, so I'm not sure I'm worried too much about that... especially if they are the same owners from New Country Sky's previous location.

The restaurant did not reach out to contact me beforehand, so if it was such an inconvenience, either let me know and do not deliver or do not be rude when you show up. Their website states they deliver within a 2 mile radius of the restaurant: on Google Maps, we are apparently 2.4 miles away (though again, customers shouldn't have to do this legwork), but never fear--given the 2 mile radius you SHOULD be able to get food delivered off the coast of the Marina and in the Bay. \n\nWe will follow this restaurant's instructions and will not order from them again for delivery.

The Sesame Chicken had a good sweet and sour sticky spicy sauce to it\nbut it was deep fried and for that reason, I was not happy with it.

Cleanliness is one of the most important things to me when it comes to chinese places in the city. \n\nWe ordered sesame chicken, hot and sour soup and chow mein.

I just know that if something taste like a bite outta my childhood, I consider it good & when it's fishy or I see skin/fat or the won ton soup taste like dishwater, I call that bad. \n\nCountry Sky is very, very, very good. Exceeded all my expectations (admittedly, low ones) & didn't make me regret trying a new joint, hence 'very' repeated thrice!\n\nCS is different from other Chinese restaurants I've been to; The space is clean & well maintained and the waitresses are pleasant instead of eternally angry (don't even get me started on *other* recently visited joints.) I think they were amused at how much we ordered, necessitating them to push over a vacant table to accommodate our dish overload. I initially thought, I'm only coming here once so I'm trying everything! Had I known the food would be so on-point, I wouldn't saved trying some dishes for next time. \n\nWe ordered: \n- 3 kinds of dim sum (3 pieces each) for $11.95: shrimp dumpling was not very flavorful (I was hoping it would be, given that everything else was), chive & shrimp dumpling was fantastic & bf enjoyed the steam BBQ pork buns. \n- half orders of fried wonton, pork potstickers & eggrolls--all winners.\n- pork fried rice for bf--it got his approval & so did the sweet & sour pork \n- general tsao's chicken- fried, breaded, sauced. What made it better than other restaurants was the white meat chicken! Hallelujah for that!\nTotal before tip: $ 47\n\nAnyone with a more sophisticated palate than mine (isn't hard to find!) would call this Americanized Chinese food but the flavors & textures are familiar to me.

Their menu is extensive and spans many regions and countries and everything is not covered in the same sauces. i.e. brown sauce, lemon sauce, sweet and sour sauce, etc. They definitely use those sauces but only when appropriate.  The noodle selection is fantastic.  I LOVE Singapore style noodles and they have the best I have had in the City.  The curry flavor is subtle yet a bit spicy.  I `hold' the chicken and they never forget.  The meat they use is not random chunks of weird textured fried unidentifiable nuggets.  The vegetarian food is amazing.  Garlic Eggplant on the appetizer menu is very tasty and the garlic is actually cooked instead of thrown in raw as an afterthought. Speedy and friendly delivery.  The one time they were running behind they actually called me and let me know they were behind but it would be there soon and hot!  Their minimum is $10 and they don't push or try to guilt you into ordering more.  Their website is strong.

My mind just couldn't wrap itself around the concept.  Imagine how pleasantly surprised/addicted I was to discover that their dim sum was in fact, quite good.  My favorite pieces are probably the Siu Mai, the Shanghai pork bun, the shrimp dumplings (which use amazingly good and fresh tasting shrimp - something you don't always get at good dim sum restaurants), and the chicken bun, which reminds me of a dim sum version of Jimmy Dean's sausage biscuit.  I realize this may not be a winning description for some of you, but a) Jimmy Dean's sausage biscuits are delicious, and b) I am a classy lady with sophisticated tastes.\n\nTheir menu has a large selection of vegetarian choices, even in the dim sum section (although be aware - the fried chive dumpling contains shrimp).  Delivery can take a little long (~30-45 minutes), but this is due to the dim sum being steamed immediately before delivery, and the piping hot pieces make the wait very worthwhile.", "author": "Tanya N."}

Not everything that we ordered was \"authentic\" (I have very high standards when it comes to authenticity of chinese food) but in terms of taste, I thought the food was great.  \n\nWhat I love about this place is the dim sum menu, which has about 15 standard items.  The pan-fried turnip cake was maybe one of the best I've ever had -- it had the crispy outer layer that so many sub-par turnip cakes are missing.  We also had the chive and shrimp dumplings, which were tasty but had a bit too much cilantro. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the General Cho's meatless chicken, which I had mixed feelings about.  First, General Cho's chicken is the equivalent of Panda Express chinese food or chop suey.  It's not real chinese food.  Second, meatless chicken?  Even after reading all the reviews on yelp about the sesame meatless chicken, I had some reservations.  However, one bite in and I was sold.  It's almost like eating meat -- the texture of the meatless nuggets (a mixture of soy and egg white, battered and deep-fried, per the owner) was almost like chicken (or rather, chicken nuggets)...and the sauce was pretty tasty, however inauthentic the dish actually is.    \n\nThe one little thing I was disappointed by is what they call the \"steamed won ton\" -- when I asked the owner what this was, he said it was \"hong yo chao tso\" (aka wontons in hot chili oil, a standard taiwanese dish).  What appeared before me was not what I was expecting -- it really was just won tons with a hot sauce/soy sauce mixture.  Sigh.   Also, they did not have white pepper for the hot and sour soup, a requirement for any chinese restaurant.  My hot and sour soup is just not complete without that little kick of spice.\n\nOther high points -- good service; clean, well-decorated space; reasonable prices; and a take-out menu!", "author": "Mitzi C."}

They were both to die for, but we both picked around the gross meat (no joke it was rubbery in texture and ground up) and left hungry. \n\nIf they ever decide to pony up and pay for some decent quality protein, I would eat there every day!

The quality of Country Sky's food is excellent. The vegetables are always fresh and plentiful. Chinese food has a bad reputation for being greasy and unhealthy; however, the reality is that Chinese food has a huge potential for being healthy and Country Sky embraces this. The people that work there are also very helpful. Even the dim sum is good and I doubt they make it there...but who knows, they might. The only downer about the place is that the menu doesn't come with descriptions; therefore, they have to put up with all of my questions regarding the contents of their many dishes.", "author": "Emily G."}

Though Tai Chi might beat it out in some regards. If you're looking for good Chinese delivery I'd say give this place a try. We liked it slightly better than Tai Chi (which is excellent). Ho's and Andy's tend to be rather greasy. The fact that they do dim sum is an added bonus :-). \n\nOh yeah, portions are not as large as other places too.

It's a hundred steps above \"House of Nan King's\" dirty floors, musty air and rude staff. \n\nThere aren't staff members making egg rolls on the tables next to you. There isn't a weird sense of potentially getting overcharged for add-ons with illegible checks that you can't dispute.\n\nThis place is Top Notch.  The food is extremely flavorful and not greasy like most other places. The service alone makes this incredible find even more amazing. \n\nI haven't even mentioned the hook of the best Dim Sum I've ever had and the Hot Tea selection that the owner personally goes over with you. Try the BLUE tea and ask him to explain why it's so good. \n\nI had a selection of Dim Sum and my favorite \"Shrimp Chow Mein\" last time I went, and again, not greasy, incredible flavor, and VERY economical.

Monday, after a long weekend, I was thinking about Chinese food for dinner all day.  Barely in the door 2 minutes, I picked up the phone and placed my order. No problems ordering. I waited with great anticipation.  The food was at my door within 20 minutes (I live close by). I grabbed it, ran to the kitchen (not very far from the front door) and dug into the packaging.  My anticipation ended like the first glimpse of a bad blind date.  The food looked weird. I ordered General's Chicken (listed as a Chef's Specialty), bbq pork appetizer, hot and sour soup, and fried rice (anticipating leftovers for Tuesday).  The General's Chicken smelled burnt and was covered in a shiny sauce type thing. The bbq pork seemed to have the same sauce.  I decided to only eat the soup and pork and save the rest for the next day.  The soup was good, but no meat of any kind (isn't hot and sour soup supposed to have meat?).  The bbq pork was so salty, and covered with a horrible sauce that I could not eat it (I really am not that picky either.)  \n\nThe next day, I had a feeling I would be tossing the General's Chicken.  The rice was good, but as much as I tried to eat the chicken, I could manage only one bite.  It was as burnt as it looked, the sauce tasted like vinegar, and the chicken just seemed weird. Too gross to eat.\n\nOh well, I will continue to look for good Chinese delivery.", "author": "Brad Z."}

And lucky for me I live in Inner Richmond, where Chinese restaurants, authentic or not, are abundant.  So naturally I was very excited when my boyfriend told me about this Chinese restaurant he'd found in the Marina and how good their dimsum was.  \"Good Chinese food in the Marina?  Are you kidding me?\"  But the way he raved about the place made me decide to give it a try(let me also add that my boyfriend isn't usually crazy about dimsum - so this was huge)\nWe got to the place and I immediately gave him my first nod of approval when I saw the decor: tasteful, cozy, and very clean.  We started off by ordering a pot of tea(Ging sen oolong, which was VERY good), then looked over the menu: standard Chinese dishes, with a section dedicated to dimsum.  The dimsum menu isn't super extensive, although it does include all the standard items, such as shrimp & chive dumpling, BBQ pork bun, pork suimai, fried turnip cake...  The owner, who was waiting on us, and who was by the way very friendly, told us our dimsum would take sometime to prepare, as they're all fresh-steamed or fried.  No problem.  The fresher the better.  \nWe ended up ordering six dishes(I was really hungry, and plus I am extremely greedy when it comes to trying out new restaurants):\n- shrimp & chive dumplings\n- chicken suimai\n- steamed BBQ pork buns\n- fried turnip cake\n- sweet rice tamale(which is often called \"sticky rice with pork wrapped in lotus leaves\" at other restaurants)\n- pan fried chive dumplings\n\nWe got the shrimp & chive dumplings first, and one bite into the juicy and decadent shrimp & chive dumpling I was sold.  It was delicious and I swear I could TASTE the freshness of the food.  We polished off our plates quicky, eagerly waiting for more.  I was just as impressed with our other dishes, especially the turnip cakes.  There's something about the way these cakes are prepared here that really sets them apart from the turnip cakes we've had at other dimsum places.  \nThe owner kept our teapot full the whole time, and really chatted up with us when he found out I'm from Taiwan(that alone should be indication of the authenticity of the food!)  It was overall an extremely pleasant dining experience.  And we left with our stomaches full and feeling content.  \nI strongly recommend this place for dimsum(as since I haven't tried their regular main dishes I can't really vouch for those), and you should definitely have the dimsum there(as opposed to getting it to-go or having it delivered).  I'm planning on spreading the word to my dimsum-loving friends, and I can't wait to go back, only with a bigger group next time!", "author": "kristina h."}

I ordered dim sum for delivery and the food was terrible, so bad that I threw it out.  The delivery guy was very nice however.   Don't fall for the other reviews like I did and go elsewhere for you dim sum fix!", "author": "Pam F."}

The boyfriend was sick all weekend and I was searching for some good hot n' sour soup to clear his sinuses and calm my nerves. We ventured into the Marina, finally found a parking space (fuck, I hate parking in this town) and went into Country Sky. Weird name for a Chinese restaurant and the music was odd (piano instrumental of Amazing Grace), but the place was clean and comfy and the food was fantastic! I had one of their hot teas, of which there was a nice selection to choose from, hot n' sour soup, pot stickers and orange chicken. The soup was spicy and freakin' hot, just the way I like it! The pot stickers were doughy and soft with an incredible dipping sauce and the orange chicken was not greasy at all. I must say that this is the very best Chinese food I have had since I moved to SF. Try it and I promise you won't be let down.", "author": "And e."}

I am often too lazy to cook and as a result have a manila folder two inches thick filled with delivery menus.  I love that this place delivers dim sum.  I mean pretty decent dim sum.  And they deliver it promptly enough that it does not get soggy.  Everything from the siu mai to the pork buns to the shrimp dumplings are awesome.  Their regular entrees are excellent as well.  The pork pot stickers are very good.  I have a thing for Hong Kong style noodles made with chasu and bok choi.  Crispy noodles with a delicious gravy.  The string bean pork is one of my favorites too.  While I try to stay away from too much deep fried food, the sesame chicken is too hard to resist sometimes.  I like it because the sauce is not too sweet like others I have had.  The mongolian beef is pretty marginal.  Not much flavor.  One of the cool things is if you order two entrees, you get a free chow mein or fried rice.  Get the BBQ pork fried rice.  It is delicious.  They are always very good about telling you if you expect a delay with delivery because they are busy.  Really good value and delicious food.", "author": "David S."}

They made sure we enjoyed every course we ordered and refilled our beverages constantly. We had a couple main entree's (mushu pork, sesame chicken) and hot and sour soup, it was really good. We also had a few dim sum items, those were average. I guess overall we enjoyed the atmosphere, friendly service, good food and reasonable prices. We will definitely come back!", "author": "D B."}

Both the beef and chicken were questionable at best.  Both tasted like the grinded remains that aren't suitable for eating.  Disgusting!", "author": "Jacob S."}

We decided to give it a try and we're glad that we did.  We really enjoyed the food and the excellent service.  This is the best chinese restaurant (definitely way better than Dragon Wells on Chestnut St.) in the Marina area.  We have actually gone back to this restaurant the 2nd time and once again we enjoyed it very much.", "author": "Bella L."}
