I thought the drinks were good but seemed short on alcohol.\nThe main things I felt was the kitchen had issues with portion control, presentation and lack of distinctive flavors. The appetizers we ordered where huge, they could be mains. The kale and beet salad was very off putting. There was too much kale and not enough beets. There is only two thin slices of a beat. The kale was not crispy and had some kind or old rosemary oil flavor. Very disappointing. Heather appetizer we had was a cod fish in the fish was to dry and over-salted but the coleslaw that it set on was very good. The main course of their signature Piri Piri chicken was a Slab of a half a chicken on my plate with some over cooked greasy potatoes. The flavor of the chicken was very good just the presentation was very poor. The Jerk chicken salad was very good but not very interesting, seemed like the vegetables were not super fresh nor unique.  Service was laid back and boring. \nNot a fan.", "author": "Garden Lover S."}

Bright but dingy red green yellow panted shacks. No windows some no doors. There are as many stray dogs as people hanging out wit a red stripe puffing on ganja. Dogs waiting with practiced pathetic doe eyed melancholy hoping for any charitable scraps to come their way. \n\nSo when you enter this place, Jamaica is only hinted at through thumping bass playing a mix of reggae, old school R&B and video of random stuff on a far wall that featured Black Moses in full gold \nchains at a keyboard upon entering. It's modern it's open it's two stories of shelved bottled liquor of various types. On the other huge colorful canvases of a local artist. \n\nThe bar is swanky upscale befitting Wall Street lights, glass, bottles, libations abound. \n\nSo the abrupt juxtaposition of hipster modern and clean was a jolt to my sensibilities. Even Kingston 11  across the bay in Oakland, is funky, colorful and rough cut, more akin to to it heritage. \n\nFortunately the food delivered the proper heat flavor and spice. The jerk chicken I ordered was packed with flavor. Unfortunately, the portion was paltry. It looked deceivingly ample because a small portion of breast a wing and a drumstick were artistically arranged on a bed of brown rice with a few black beans sprinkled in. I assume to claim it was beans and rice... more like bean and rice. And the six slices of plantain (not plantains) also circled the artistic mound of rice. \n\nIt was certainly fancy and elevated cuisine. Fresh ingredients prepared with skill (I know cause we sat near the kitchen). \n\nBut here is the thing... the soul of Jamaican cooking is about filling your belly, your heart and soul while creating the heat needed to help you sweat and keep yourself cool in the tropical heat. \n\nThe translation here was like a well crafted snapshot on high gloss photographic paper frames in lucite of a scene in Jamaica, sanitized and airbrushed for the folks who think Jamaica is like one of those private all inclusive resorts Chris Rock alluded to-in his special. Glossy with added scratch n sniff. Yes it smelled great sitting there by the kitchen and authentic hot sauces?  You bet. I watched with envy as peri peri chicken was being distributed, ample falling off the plate. Damn!

The bat? It was even in their extensive rum menu. Wazzup wit dat? \n\nThe coffee however delivered in a hand crafted French press from Jerod the pottery artist based in Emeryville was awesome. Accompanied by shared black rum cake which was ok not great capped of the meal.\n\nWould I come back... sure good place for a couple or a small group.

Day O!\nDaylight come and me wanna go home...\n\nI'm no expert at Caribbean cuisine, but I have watched \"Taste of the Islands\" on Create TV. There were lots of plantains and papaya in those dishes, and fruit-and-meat combos can be a dicey proposition if executed poorly. However, this place boasts a true expert, chef Nigel James of Oakland's Kingston 11, in partnership with Daniel Patterson whose restaurant Alta was the previous occupant. I was underwhelmed with the overzealous California cuisine of that operation (review: http://bit.ly/2pMFjun), so I tried to keep an open mind about Kaya. You know how hard that was for me to do since the vibe was virtually identical to Alta.\n\nI came here after working out at the gym, so I was already self-conscious about how casual I looked. I slithered up to the bar and decided to start things off with an $8 Spicy Ginger Beer since I wanted something tropical and non-alcoholic (photo: http://bit.ly/2E11x0O). It was pretty refreshing but a tad too sweetly fermented for my taste. For my starter, I ordered the $11 Papaya + Greens, which mixed pickled papaya slices, Granny Smith apple slices, caramelized plaintains, and greens with their house vinaigrette in a good-size bowl (photo: http://bit.ly/2pNdBxs). I thought it was pretty good but again probably a little too sweet for what I was hoping from a salad.\n\nMy entree was the $19 Curried Vegetables, a rather hefty if somewhat pricey bowl of broccoli, green beans, carrots, chayote (cho cho), sweet and Irish potatoes, peas, and more of the caramelized plantains covered in a thick Jamaican curry (photo: http://bit.ly/2uqfq9r). The ingredients were fine, but the result was a little too heavy and unfortunately a bit bland. I was really hoping Kaya would be better than my previous dining experience at Alta, but I felt somehow it was another near-miss for Patterson. I'm not averse to unique cuisines, but I think I may need to do a restart when I try Caribbean food again. After all, the oxtail stew and goat curry sound calorifically good.\n\nDay me say day me say day me say day o\nDaylight come and me wanna go home\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...the ingredients seemed tight but the flavors were on the sweet side and often bland\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...still the same dark, trendy space that Alta was\nSERVICE - 4 stars...the bartenders were most attentive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...my check done come and me wanna go home", "author": "Ed U."}

Just looking at their health score gave me the hershey squirts but you couldn't beat their $6.50 Salt and Pepper Pork Chop over rice that fed two and then some. They were a staple of cheap eats for those who worked in the area.\n\nThen, gentrification happened and Iron Wok was replaced with Alta CA which well, wasn't my favorite so I was super excited to hear that a Caribbean restaurant was taking over.\n\nYAS - infuse some fiery spices onto this stinky stretch of Market street!\n\nI absolutely hate to be the first person not to give a glowing review for Kaya but my friend and I found the food and drinks to be underwhelming (for the prices) at this new Jamaican restaurant from Coi's Daniel Patterson and Kingston 11's Nigel Jones.\n\nEvery weekend dinner calls for some cocktails. Unfortunately, Kaya's cocktails were not even close to being on par with SF caliber craft cocktails. We couldn't wait to hit up another cocktail bar afterwards.\n\nI ordered the Rude Boi: White rum w/ cucumber, soursop, midori ($13): http://bit.ly/2DW2g4V which was overly sweet and artificial tasting. It reminded me of a not so good watered down midori sour without the sour. \n\nMy friend ordered the Montego Slang: Blended rum, mango, cilantro, cherry heering, benedictine, jerk ($13): http://bit.ly/2n1VSRx and said it tasted like cough syrup. Our initial server never checked on us and never came back to take our entree order, otherwise we would have told her.\n\nSkip the cocktails and just go with a bottle of Red Stripe.\n\nThe small food menu has about 15 items of small plates and entrees. There's a good amount of options for vegetarians and vegans. Prices are higher than any Jamaican restaurant I've been to (i.e. $24 jerk chicken) but I don't mind if the food is bomb. There's an 18% auto-gratituty/service charge which is fair. \n\nThe Salt Fish Fritters ($13): http://bit.ly/2BjYu2i were surprisingly bland and sadly, the chimichurri didn't do much to enhance the flavor, as it was also bland (lacked acidity). Thankfully, the trio of hot sauces on the table helped.\n\nI love tamarind and eat it fresh, dried, and in candy form so I was excited for the Grilled Wild Gulf Shrimp w/ tamarind sauce ($17): http://bit.ly/2G1FEAB. While the shrimp was cooked well, that pungent sweet and sour tartness was just not there. The tamarind flavor was too mellow but perhaps that was their intention since it may be too potent for some.\n\nAs a litmus test of solid Caribbean restaurant, we ultimately decided to go with the Jerk Chicken ($24) for our shared entr\u00e9e: http://bit.ly/2DrbW6k. Our second server was kind enough to allow us to order dark meat only (thanks to my yelp friend, Adrienne H. on the heads up of the dry white meat).\n\nI like it HAWT and baby, this jerk chicken was fiyaaah - my mouth turned into a burning furnace on this chilly night. BUT, it didn't taste like jerk chicken. While it had great heat, it was missing the robust, complex spices one would associate from a good jerk chicken. My friend said, it tasted like a spicy blackened chicken and I agree. The chicken was tender but not fall off the bone tender. The accompanying fluffy rice and nicely caramelized plantains were our favorite items on the plate.\n\nService was a bit spotty but it's barely week two so it's understandable. After taking our drink and appetizer order, our server never came back to check on us or to take the remainder of our order...but she did check in with tables next to us. \n\nWhen we were looking for our server, the young server with the beard stepped right in. He was great, he took our entree order and checked in with us several times - thank you! The host was nice too and jumped in to clear our empty plates.\n\nThe dining room is still hip and dark (from the Alta CA days) with the addition of cool art from Caribbean artists and a Jamacian movie streaming on the projector screen. Not much sound dampening so it can get loud if it's a full house. \n\nWhile there's not a strong presence of Jamaican food in SF, it's hard to justify paying these prices again at Kaya since the food and drinks were very disappointing. The bold, Caribbean flavors just weren't there for us at Kaya or maybe this is Caribbean food for techbros?\n\nYou can find much better Jamaican food elsewhere and for a fraction of the cost (~40% less) at Flavas (SSF), Coconuts (PA), Back A Yard (MP & SJ), or even Cha Cha Cha (SF).", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Our server came from Nigel Jones' restaurant in Oakland (Kingston 11), and he seemed very familiar with Kaya's menu already.\n\nOur table sampled a good amount of the menu. The Black Pepper Crab was the runaway favorite. The spicy sweet sauce was so addicting that we ordered a second plate! I just wish the sauce were a tad less sweet.\n\nThe Oxtail Stew was also great - rich, hearty flavor and nicely tender. The plantains were good too. I liked the Piri Piri Chicken, which was actually not that spicy but had awesome, bold flavor from the chili sauce.\n\nThe Jerk Chicken was on the dry side, though it had good heat. They didn't have a side of jerk sauce when we asked, but they did bring out some of the oxtail stew broth for us to dunk. For jerk chicken, I do prefer Back A Yard's blend of spices (Menlo Park, San Jose).\n\nFor sides, I tried the String Beans - with Thai Chili sauce and ginger, and the Papaya Salad - nice brightness, but had barely any papaya.\n\nI only tried one cocktail, Rude Boi, which was fine, but nothing standout. They did have large punch bowls to share, which looked perfect for happy hour.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant still felt very similar to Alta, but with new paintings and brighter colors.

I've been missing good Caribbean food since moving away from my friends over in Crown Heights/Brooklyn, where amazing jerk chicken and plantains were around nearly every corner, and always at great value.\n\nThe ambiance of this place prepares you for what to expect value wise - this is more like the kind of place to spend some quality time with a date, rather than a place to pick up a hearty meal to-go.  Nevertheless, on price, the food delivers on flavor and fillingness.  By the end of the meal we were still talking about the amazing salt fish fritters.  The entrees were solid in every respect.  The jerk chicken was moist, with a rub packed with spice and held no punches with its heat, paired with plantains and rice and peas cooked to the perfect texture.  You'll be glad the oxtail stew comes with double scoops of rice to soak up every last bit of its rich gravy.  Can't wait to stop by again!", "author": "Neal B."}

I used the hot sauce to add flavor to it.\n\nAs for jerk chicken, we both thought the chicken needed more flavor. I was expecting it to have a nice heat kick, but it didn't.   The size of the sandwich though was a good brunch size that I was satisfied after eating it. I hate small sandwich portions.\n\nAs for the service, our server was very friendly and attentive.

Granted we came for happy hour, we will be back for even more of the full menu. Great happy hour with tasty food and drink. The staff were amazing and super friendly...by staff I'm speaking specifically about Shani and Langstyn. They were phenomenal. So there's not much we didn't eat off the menu...friend plantains, jerk chicken wings with fried dumplings, shrimp, salty fish fritters, Jamaican beef patties, chocolate habanero and spiced vanilla swirl soft serve, and some drinks. Seriously this place is  fantastic! I also knew it would be legit because early in the summer I saw the Jamaican Rugby 7s team in there eating. I loved how spacious it seemed even though it wasn't a huge area. They really used the space wisely. The bar area and seating was well done and I didn't feel crammed in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-31", "description": "We started off with appetizers/ happy hour. We ordered jerk wings (only on happy hour menu), beef patty, salted fish fritters. The jerk wings were good but you only get three wings, that's the only disappointing thing. It is the full wing not just flat or drumstick. The beef patty was good too but it looks like a pop tart, this item is only on the happy hour menu. The salted fish fritters were ok and only came with two! I think too few for the price. \nFor dinner we all ordered different dishes, jerk chicken, piri piri chicken, oxtail stew, and salmon. The jerk chicken was exactly same as the appetizer but I felt for the price they should give you more chicken. The reason I say that is cause the piri piri chicken was a half of a chicken and just look and seemed so much bigger. The piri piri chicken was very moist! The salmon was good too and veggies that came with it as well. Oxtail was really tasty.\nOverall this place is ok but for the price of the dishes they don't give a lot of food. Even just a few extra pieces of chicken for the jerk chicken I would be more satisfied because looking at the jerk chicken plate versus the piri piri chicken makes it seem so not worth it. Also their menu doesn't have a lot of choices.", "author": "Shauna f."}

I have a group of friends who try to get together for a brunch every month or so. It started as a Ladies Who Brunch type of thing and expanded to include a few guys. I made a reservation through OpenTable for a party of eight about two weeks prior for Saturday, March 31st at 12:30pm.\n\n*SALT FISH FRITTERS: chimichurri ($13)\n*FRIED PLANTAINS: black bean sauce + sour cream ($7)\n*JAMAICAN PATTY: beef ($5)\n*JERK CHICKEN WING: fried dumplings ($11)\n*PAPAYA + GREENS: pickled papaya. house vinaigrette ($11)\n*FRUIT SALAD: ask your server about today's market fruits ($9)\n*JAMAICAN BREAKFAST: salt fish, ackee, fried dumplings, bammy ($18)\n*CINNAMON FRENCH TOAST: coconut battered challah, seasonal fruit, blackstrap maple syrup; choice of taylor's spicy chicken sausage or turkey bacon ($15)\n*BLACK PEPPER TOFU WITYH FRIED EGG: ginger + soy caramelized tofu, jasmine rice ($14)\n*KAYA SCRAMBLE: two eggs w/spinach, onion, tomato, wheat toast + cassava home fries ($14)\n*HOUSE SMOKED SALMON: papaya salad + greens, sweet corn bread ($20)\n*JERK CHICKEN SANDWICH: coleslaw; choice of russet + yam fries or papaya + greens ($19)\n*SWEET CORN BREAD ($6)\n*FRESH-CUT FRIES: russet + red yams, thyme salt ($7)\n*TAYLOR'S SPICY CHICKEN SAUSAGE OR TURKEY BACON ($5)\n\nWe basically ordered the entire menu minus a dish of two. My group does love trying everything. I adored the salmon and the jamaican breakfast. The salmon was cooked perfectly. Still silky and moist. The salt fish in the jamaican breakfast added a nice savoriness to the scramble. I wasn't eating deep fried foods at the time, so I couldn't try the fritters, but I really liked the chimichurri. Was great as a sauce with other dishes. Make sure to also try their hot sauces if you'd like a little kick to your dishes. The french toast syrup was delicious! I don't know what alcohol was in it (probably rum?), but boy, did it pack a punch. We just kept dipping everything in it: the fruit, the cornbread, just whatever went with syrup. Yum!\n\n*MIMOSA: make it a pitcher ($25 each); blood orange x1, mango x1, passion fruit x1\n*NEGRIL-ONI: smith + cross, campari, sweet vermouth ($12)\n*RUM PUNCH: wray + nephew, lime, strawberry, pineapple, orange, coconut ($50 punch bowl)\n*FRENCH PRESS COFFEE ($10) x2\n\nSince it was brunch, we decided to try all three mimosas. I thought they were juice heavy as I really only like a splash for color. Out of the three, I liked the tartness of the passionfruit. I found the blood orange too sweet. Though some in our party mixed the two together and found a good balance. I don't know how the rum punch bowl serves four as it's huge! It drank our party of eight with quite a few extra glasses left. I'm not a huge fan of coconut, but I didn't mind it here. The punch was pretty stiff at first sip, but seemed to mellow out with drinking. If you're a big coffee drinker, they only do french presses here, so I'd suggest getting your caffeine fix elsewhere. The pots didn't yield many coffee cups.\n\nA fun new brunch spot. Definitely worth checking out if you like jamaican food (albeit with a modern twist) and rum punch.", "author": "Elena N."}

I had a reservation but arrived 15 minutes earlier; the host let me know that while tables were still unavailable, there were still some bar seats left. OK, I thought, this isn't too bad as I was by myself, ready to rock out to QOTSA later that night. Ordered 2 dishes, 3 cocktails, and a Red Stripe. Here's the lowdown on this place:\n\nService: For bar seating, not too bad. Place was pretty loud but the bartenders & servers do a great job shuffling the food & drinks to you. Kitchen was open & people can walk through to get to the restrooms, which I think is pretty cool as long as us eaters aren't too nasty around it...\n\nFood: Had the Salt Fish Fritters and the Oxtail Stew. The fritters were nicely done in 3 well-sized balls of deliciousness, not even overly salty when eaten w/ some of the collard greens & the chimichurri next to it. The oxtail stew, WOW this dish is excellent. Could not get over the fat-laden & cooked-just-right oxtail w/ the dripped sauce right next to some butterbeans, 2 heaps of rice, and a few perfecto plantains. This was the best part of the meal, by far. Great to have tried such a wonderful centerpiece for the dinner.\n\nDrinks: Rum Punch + Rude Boi + Rum-Filled Coconut. The Rum Punch started out bitter, but gradually it delivered some really great citrus kicks. Wish I could have a bowl of this, but I'll have to bring some friends next time! The Rum-Filled Coconut, paired w/ a closing coup de gr\u00e2ce pairing of Red Stripe, was refreshing w/ the extracted coconut water and the effervescent rum. The biggest disappointment was the Rude Boi: the consistency was decent only for 1/5th of the cocktail, then it devolved into something of a \"sparkling Midori\" that was watered-down & left a terrible aside for my last few oxtail bites. Would've just gone for another Rum Punch instead, but oh well that's why I'm experimenting for you Yelpers!\n\nOverall, the meal was a pricey one, a few buckaroos over $100, for everything above (18% service charge included). Was it worth it? Just for the cocktails & fritters, probably not. The Oxtail Stew did its job to elevate the whole experience to above-average, while I would be amiss to remind that this place is still in its opening weeks. Consistency is what matters in the end, and I hope that Kaya's expectations of consistency elevate it to something much better for Caribbean cuisine in the City.", "author": "Eric L."}

The interior of the restaurant didn't change much from its previous establishment Alta, which was already very rustic cute. They did add different Jamaican inspired artworks, which are neat and special. \n\nWe got the jerk chicken (lots of spices, slightly spicy), Jamaican breakfast that came with savory fried bread, fried plantain, sauteed salt fish w/ ackee. Thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Love a place that's down to earth and serves fresh quality food. Staff was very helpful and friendly.

I wasn't sure about Caribbean cuisine but a buddy and I decided to check it out. Having a lot to catch up on we ordered a bunch of plates to share and dug in. \n\nStarting with a cocktail (yes, full bar) we talked as dishes started to arrive. Saut\u00e9ed green beans with fresh ginger and thai chili pepper sauce had just a little kick and were delicious. The Black Pepper Crab with sweet + spicy black pepper sauce came next and didn't disappoint. Not a whole lot of meat but very flavorful. Next came the Carmelized Carrots and Beet Salad. I think this was the least successful dish. It had no strong flavor to stand up to everything else on the table. I think there might be something here but it needs a rethink. Next came the final two dishes...Oxtail Stew with jasmine rice and plantains followed by the Goat Curry. Both were very good. Perhaps the oxtail might have increased the meat to bone ratio but it was very good. I think the goat was the highlight. Tender without a trace of gaminess. \n\nSo, five dishes and four successes. Not bad, particularly for a place just recently opened. The service was very good. The room was a tad too dark. Sound level was fine. Don't count on street parking.\n\n4 stars.", "author": "Gary C."}

The yellow yams with the fried lemon arrived undercooked and the fried lemons were just a bad idea. Salmon for $29 should be served with more vegetables.

We'd planned on going elsewhere for dinner, but the vibe and service were great, the wine list was savvy and the menu looked tasty, so we cancelled our reservation elsewhere and got a table. It was a great move. Despite the fact that it was only their 4th day of being open, the food and service were spot-on. \n\nLoved our charming, friendly, super on-it server, Langston, who made our meal smooth and fun, too. The kale and beet salad was simple but somehow amazing (I think the kale had been marinated, and the dressing was magic). The tender jerk chicken had just the right kiss of spice and heat. I ended up eating it with my hands, and I'm not ashamed to say that yes, I licked my fingers clean. Plantains are too often greasy, but these were perfectly fried. Loved the rice and beans, too.\n\nThe chef came out to talk to us at the end, and he was really cool. Just a nice guy with a calm, kind and friendly vibe. Maybe that's why this place had such a good vibe going-- not just because of his talent, but because of his spirit.

When I lived in Palo Alto, I would always run to Coconuts and Back-a-Yard but other than the super trendy Caribbean-fusion Palm House, I couldn't find any options in SF.  \n\nAs fate would have it, Kaya moved right across the street from me into the old ALTA spot.  The decor is virtually identical to ALTA with the same set-up, just with some Caribbean art and a projector showing old Caribbean movies on the wall a la Foreign Cinema or Noir.\n\nWe were told the wait for a table without a reservation would be an hour and a half, although there were tables open (this was true of our experience at ALTA as well, weird).  There were two spots at the bar though, and we gladly took them.  We ordered the oxtail and the jerk chicken.  I really, really enjoyed both.  The plantains were great, the oxtail was super tender/fatty/fall off the bone awesome, the jerk chicken was a solid take on the Jamaican staple.  Just FYI the entree portions are huge.  We could have easily split just one between the two of us, and had to (gladly!) take the rest to go.  We were so full that we couldn't force ourselves to try their ice cream desserts, which looked awesome so that's good enough reason as any to come back soon.\n\nLimited but great beer/wine selection.  I eschewed the traditional Red Stripe in favor of a Pine IPA, and my wife had the house Sauvignon Blanc.  Both were solid!\n\nThe ONLY thing keeping me from throwing five stars at this bad boy is the price.  Just like ALTA was, it's really high for what it is.  Two entrees and two drinks cost us close to $90 with tip.  It's great food but personally, when I'm craving Jamaican it's always as a fun casual date night or guys night (think $30ish per person, $60ish per couple), not necessarily veering toward the $100+ club.\n\nWill I be back?  Definitely, probably many, many times given our location, but due to said price points probably more for splitting an entree and/or grabbing small plates at the bar with some good drinks.  For what it's worth, lots of people seemed to be doing it this way, the bar was buzzing with friendly groups and couples, many of them talking to each other and the bartenders and getting everything from full meals to shared punch bowls.

Kaya definitely hits my mark. I was skeptical that the food would be made for an American palate, but everything was beyond on point. \n\nMy girlfriend and I went for dinner this past weekend, and I was excited to see the extensive rum listing (I haven't been able to find Brugal out here). We both got the Zap Pow and it was wild delicious! I was able to taste the rum in it (if was Wray & Nephew, I understand since that stuff is  just wild strong) and the drink was great. The burning plantain was a dope touch.\n\nWe ordered Fried Plantains as the appetizer and they were prepared perfectly! Not slimy, not crispy; just the right amount of sweetness, thickness of the cut, and the black beans and sour cream that came with it sent it over the edge. My girlfriend ordered the Oxtail which was so succulent and flavorful. I ordered the Curry Goat (don't knock it until you try it) which had the perfect amount of flavor and spice. Both didn't have an excess of bones so the plus side is that you get so much out of your plate. \n\nI'm definitely coming back to Kaya.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-19", "description": "I love Caribbean food. I have found some great hole-in-the-wall places with cheap eats packed with flavor. If you're a fan of Caribbean food too, you'll understand why this is important: This review was written without having tasted the Beef Patties.\n\nThat's right, the beef patties are NOT available for dinner. You can always tell a good Caribbean place by their patties so, without this taste, I can't give a full assessment, but I'll go ahead and talk about the non-patty experience I had.\n\nAMBIANCE:\n\nKaya is super hip. They have gorgeous wooden tables accented with colored chairs and a fun bar in the middle of the restaurant. A projector casts films on one of the walls as the packed restaurant fills with a social buzz. The restaurant is not in the greatest location, but it's gentrifying quickly so it's not too bad. You can see the kitchen in the back and if you're lucky enough to get a seat by it, it smells SOOOO GOOOD. \n\nFOOD:\n\nI'll quickly cover the drinks first:\n\nI started off with the Rum Punch - wray + nephew, lime, strawberry, pineapple, orange, coconut. It definitely tasted like rum with food coloring and I just couldn't down it. I kept trying through my appetizers but it honestly tasted like they forgot some of the ingredients. Like, I actually think the drink was just a mistake. In any case, they didn't charge me for it which was really nice.\n\nI swapped it out for a Deep Dub which was AMAZING. It was sweet and tasted like a pina colada. I would definitely get it again. Pretty sure I could feel the island breeze as I drank it.\n\nApps:\nI got the plantains of course, which were cooked SO well. Lovely flavor, lovely caramelized crunch with a warm, soft inside. Heaven.\n\nI also got the Gulf Shrimp which were okay. They are super sweet and could use a kick. I thought there might be some spice in it but it was pure sweet and it just threw me off. The shrimp themselves were big and juicy. Mmmm.\n\nFinally, I got the string beans which were salty but somehow, everything I needed. I would order them again in an instant!\n\nThe apps were the best part of the meal, as the main course floundered. \n\nI got the black pepper crab. We have a black pepper crab where I'm from so I thought it would be similar -- it's not. The crab is in the shell but easy to crack open, and there's a lot of meat. However, the sauce isn't really able to make it into the meat so it just sits on the shell and you can dip your meat into the sauce, but a good crab is infused with flavor, and this crab just didn't have it. The sauce is sweet, not spicy (it says sweet and spicy) and very sticky, but they'll give you a hot towel, so don't worry about that. The sweet sauce again was just okay... needed way more spice!\n\nMy friend got the Oxtail. It was good, cooked so well. Tender, amazing... It was just a small portion (mostly bone) so for the price, it was questionable. That being said, it was good. 7.5/10 and would maybe order it again. \n\nI wouldn't order the crab again. \n\n\nSERVICE:\n\nService was fine. People were nice. They didn't charge me for my botched drink. I felt like the staff was attentive but didn't pressure me to pay the bill even though it was packed.\n\nPRICES: \n\nPrices are expensive for the flavor, but normal for the city. If I wanted to pay $180 I would probably go elsewhere, but I get that SF prices are just sky high. Not ideal but I'm on board if everyone else is. Would prefer a $5 patty and $8 jerk chicken from a hole-in-the-wall place though.\n\nTL;DR\n\nNot the best Caribbean place and there are better ones at cheaper prices, but I'll probably be back. It has potential and is worth another shot.", "author": "Maya G."}

We ordered suggested items including the salt fish fritters, gulf shrimp, jerk chicken, and oxtails. Honestly the food was just mediocre with the same unexciting, under seasoned sides across all the dishes (steamed rice, rice and beans, plantains). I've liked jerk chicken every other time I've had it (including the islands), but it was just not very exciting. Somehow they managed to overcook the oxtails as well. I know this restaurants is across from Uber HQ, but seriously this is very overpriced for what it is, and I happily pay for $30+ entrees if the food is worthwhile. Our waiter was obviously stoned, which I don't mind if he actually remembers things, but he forgot numerous requests and even brought us plates after we asked for our check.

The crowd is young, energetic, fun. And the service is great, we loved our server.\n\nThe food though is pretty mediocre. I had a ginger rum drink that was kinda tasteless, served in a small metal cup with lots of ice... there couldn't have been more than half a shot of rum in the drink. A small piece of grilled salmon (the fish was fresh, but there was nothing special about the flavor) with a very small quantity of slightly-burned roasted cauliflower and brussel sprouts was $29, which is in my book pretty ridiculous. The jerk chicken was very impressive-looking and had good flavor, but it was overcooked and dry. We passed on the dessert.\n\nThe restaurant's location puts it close to Twitter & Uber headquarters and, as I said, it's a handsome place so I suspect there will be plenty of customers who won't mind the prices, it'll probably do well.

The design of the restaurant, however, is inviting and very chic, with a tall wall of liquors providing the backdrop. Now to the food: all of us agreed that it was tasty! The portion sizes vary, however. My wife's piri-piri chicken was a half bird with plenty of meat and accompaniments. My goat curry was bony, as goat tends to be, so there really was very little meat; I would have been hungry if I were not able to finish off the chicken that my wife couldn't eat. The curried vegetables ordered by one friend was ample enough that he took some home. The grilled wild gulf shrimp ordered by the other friend was billed as a small eat, but she had trouble consuming it because it was so spicy. We all  sampled the salt fish fritters, which some of us really liked and others not so much. Likewise, we shared a slice of Jamaican black cake, which was very dense with hints of rum that reminded us of a Christmas cake. Two of us consumed most of it, with the others satisfied by a small bite. My wife really enjoyed her pomegranate mint soda, but my spicy ginger beer really didn't taste very gingery or spicy at all. I'd opt for the mint soda. All in all, it wasn't a bad experience, but considering the prices of the big plates, we felt that the value wasn't there. There are lots of restaurants in San Francisco and this one deserves a try, but like us, you may find that a single visit is just fine.", "author": "William L."}

Just needed a bigger portion for the sides to match the entree. \n\nAmbiance is fun and nice. Dimmed lighting and nice decor. I'll be back!

There were four of us for dinner. We ordered 2 cocktails and one rum punch at happy hour price plus two starters, two entrees and the three desserts and it came out close to $100/person. The food was flavorful, but not very substantial. The entrees had way more rice/rice and beans than meat, so it was not really good for sharing. I thought the menu was pretty overpriced for what we got.", "author": "La Tache T."}

We had originally called around 5pm to check if we could make a RSVP and they stated the earliest would be 9:30pm. We decided not to rsvp since we weren't sure if we could wait that long. The person on the phone did add that the bar was available if there was any seats available when we got there. We ended up getting there after 9 and we ended up getting a table right away. Enjoyed the music and atmosphere. I love plantains and had to order more. Customer service from everyone we talked to was friendly. Definitely a place I'd go again!

I recommend the saltfish fritters, caramelized carrots and squash, plantains, goat curry, jerk chicken salad, oxtails, Jamaican black cake, and spiced vanilla soft serve, which was our entire order. I will definitely be back. My suggestion is to make reservations as this place is popular. My other suggestion is to treat yourself to the wide assortment of rum they have.", "author": "Lemuel Y."}

Our waiter helped us select the right mix and amount of food.  We also got to try several cocktails - and the pitcher of mimosa is a total value play.  Passion fruit mimosas were delightful.

The service was fantastic! Our waiter was extremely kind and did not push us at all. He checked in appropriately to make sure things were going well and the flow of food coming out of the kitchen was at the right pace. \n\nHowever, we were unfortunately very disappointed with the food. The black pepper tofu was very dry and sweet and the jasmine rice was mushy. The grilled wild gulf shrimp tasted like the shrimp was frozen and had a mealy texture. The fried plantains were flavorful. I think they dehydrated the roasted kale and beet salad. I would have preferred thick chunks of beets. It was bad, but it also didn't hit the spot for me. The Mary's organic jerk chicken (big eats) was dry. I coated the chicken in their hot sauces so I can't speak to the jerk flavoring, but the meat itself was too dry. The rice and peas were enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I have to say I would much prefer going to Cha Cha Cha for Jamaican food. I am grateful for the kind service, but the food was underwhelming. I expected more and left disappointed. I wish them the best and hope they continue to improve.", "author": "Emma L."}

We tried a few of the cocktails - they were all good but I wouldn't call out any of them as a favorite.\nThe service was perfect - I felt like they had the right balance of checking in frequently enough to make sure you didn't need anything but not so often that your dinner conversation was interrupted.", "author": "Danielle T."}

My first visit I had the Patties and Jerk Chicken Salad. Everything was so yummy! \n\nThe second time, I ordered the Jerk Chicken salad again. Two issues that will not deter me from stepping into the restaurant ever again: \n\n1. Instead of a proper piece of chicken, the salad had no proper pieces of chicken and instead was full of very small chicken scraps that included bones. Very disappointing for a $19 salad.\n\n2. The salad was too spicy! I can take spice; but, it would be more palatable if Kaya considered adding a cooling element, even if it's just on the side.", "author": "Charlie D."}

Our server seemed ok at first, but when the food arrived, he handed me the wrong order and just walked away. I waved three times to get his attention and for a restaurant not that big, anyone would have noticed me waving. My boyfriend got up and told him he brought me the wrong order and all he said back to him was \"ok\". Being a server for almost five years while I was in undergrad, the first thing I would've have done was apologize and assure the correct order will come out shortly. I don't mind the mistake at all, everyone makes a mistake, it is how he handled it. We were ignored pretty much the whole night until I he sensed how I upset I was from the whole situation. To my surprise, he also automatically charged us 20% tip. From my understanding, that is only automatically applied with a big group of more than 5 or 6, but not two. I was so excited to try this place, but after tonight, I will certainly not go back to this place again. What a disappointment.", "author": "Ingrid C."}

She liked it and said the salt fish tasted Filipino.  The cassava home fries were good, but the fried dumplings were plain and nothing to write home about.  Fried plantains are always good (hard to mess up).  I got the jerk chicken sandwich.  It was also good but there was very little meat in it, about 3 chicken nuggets worth.  The rest was slaw or fried plantains.  Now I like slaw and plantains so it tasted fine, but for $19 I expect more meat.  Also, the papaya salad was mostly greens and 3 tiny pieces of papaya, so I thought that was a little misleading.  So decent not amazing food, but overpriced.", "author": "John K."}

Never had such small portions of Jamaican food not traditional at all and catering to the millennial techs who probably have never been outside the USA. Got the fried plantain, oxtail stew.
