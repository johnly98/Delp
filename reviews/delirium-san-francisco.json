Perhaps I have really grimy hipster friends, but I have no qualms about that. \n\nIt's a classic example of a dive bar. The interior is really dark, so it might be a good place to bring a casual first date (unless you're going for something more romantic). The music wasn't too loud, so it was easy to carry on a conversation without screaming at each other. \n\nDrinks are cheap, but poorly executed. We ordered whiskey gingers, and the consensus was that they do not use ginger ale, but a mix of Coke and Sprite. It was more obvious with my friend who ordered a ginger back for her shot of whiskey.

Classic dive. Graffiti all over the bathrooms. I used to make it a point of of getting drunk with my old roommate here and then writing inappropriate things about ourselves on the bathroom walls. I have gotta several random text messages from friends that say something like, \"Do you know it says you give ball-cuzzis on the bathroom wall in Delirium!!!?\" --- yes, yes I do know that.\n\n2. GENEA! The greatest bartender ever. She's an angel from heaven, and as long as you don't act like a twat, she's a peach.\n\n3. Cheap, cheap, cheap.... I get drunk for less than $30 here. That's a beautiful thing. I work at a bar where a shot of Jameson will run you $9, so the $5 over sized shots of J-MO I get here are certainly a blessing.\n\n4. Entertainment everywhere. Walk in the back, the front, the bathroom, the alley (Albion) right outside. Solid gold Mission entertainment.\n\n5. John Waters hangs out here. Seriously. Pink Flamingos John Waters. I met him here once.\n\n6. Regardless of how many hundreds of times I've been here, one of the door guys, Mike, will never remember me.

I could see that, I guess.\n\nBut for me I love this little bar.  There is a pool table that is used just infrequently enough that it doesn't seem like there's any line or anything.  Everyone I played was good, the pool table and cues are all in good shape.  Little details, I guess - they even have a mini cue stick because the table's close to a wall.  I actually guess this could be common but I actually hadn't seen one like it before, I thought it was cool.\n\nThey have a dance floor, although that isn't my thing unless I'm at a show.  But it's big enough, two levels, and it seems there's usually a few people in there.  There's a Pac Man and pinball machine for nerds like me.\n\nTo reiterate if you haven't got the message: $2 Tecate and if I remember correctly I think it may be $2 Tecate / $2 Tequila all day, I can't remember, which is a good sign for a bar.  Happy hour is $2 PBR and cheap shots as well.

Bloody Sundays. They have incredible bloody mary's for $5 on Sundays as well as a few other scrumptious specialty drinks. But, there's something about their Bloody's that keep me going back.

Straight out of SJ, I felt so out of place but I liked it......the first 15 minutes! Made me feel like a rockstar with funny looks by random strangers and a bartender who was a complete douche-bag d*** (I'll just say PRICK). I came in out of curiosity after hearing about the random rants of good music, cheap drinks, and happy hour. Let me tell you, NOT worth it at all!!!\n\nThe place is clean, great jukebox selection, easy to enjoy video games, tv screens, and a free pool table. I like these perks. Especially with a cheap drink in hand. The problem...bartender. Yeah, cheap thrills for nothing! I kindly asked for a Steam Anchor hoping to get the $2-3 happy hour deal. Nope. I didn't get it at all. I was ripped off from the get-go. With the sign \"service for the sick\", I was literally sick of this place the minute he gave attitude, threw my coaster and pounded my beer down the table. What is your problem?!\n\nThey have their so-called daily happy hour until 7pm for their $2 Tecate, PBR Pints and their other beer for $3 excludes Chimay. If you come in for their happy hour deal on their food, be aware it's only for their already placed paper plate of 5 BBQ wings, one small plate of wilted lettuce and carrots, and hot dogs split s*** in half and give you old-crummy hot dog buns with their $2 minimum charge of a drink.  Glamorous? HA!\n\nThe place was okay for the warm tasting beer but I never want to touch their BBQ chicken again! Who the hell made that crap?! The bartender? I bet it was him because he was nothing but rude!! I guess I wasn't trashy enough to be in the bar. Thanks for nothing a**hole! Oh....tip? Here's a tip....you're probably delirious but you better be nice to your customers before the bar goes into s***!! Worst service I've received in SF from a dive bar.

It was crowded as always.  We ordered our cold pint of Stella Artois and walked towards the back only to find out that smoking was not allowed anymore.  Bummer.  NO SMOKING.  I guess it's better for all of us that smoking is not permitted inside the bar anymore.  \n\nAs we light up with other smokers outside the bar, we saw some pretty crazy people.  A woman on the phone in tears screaming at what it seems like a boyfriend, or girlfriend, then minutes later after hanging up, making out with a guy which obviously she just met.  Gross.  \n\nInside, more interesting individuals.  A woman at a bar by herself talking to a group of random guys.  She was nice.  I think her name was Nicole.  One of the guy she was talking to approached my roommate.  Got a little too close. \n\nRandom Guy: \"Want to smoke some weed.\"\nSi-Eun: ignoring\nRandom Guy: \"Wanna go home with me... no pressure.\"\nSi-Eun: \"What do you mean?\"\nRandom Guy: \"Is that a no.\"  Then he started mumbling to himself.\nSi-Eun: continued to ignore\nRandom Guy: flips her off.  What an as*hole.  \n\nWe downed our beers and headed home, wishing we never left our perfect neighborhood, The North Beach.  As we walked towards BART, I kept saying in my head... \"there's no place like home, there's no place like home,\" over and over and over until finally we made it home :-)!\n\n\n---------*----------------*--------------*------------*\nThursday: 12/72006 \n- 10:10p Arrival\n- 11:30p Departure\n\nI like this bar, but not when it's crowded because some people are just so rude and doesn't know how to say \"excuse me.\"  There's a pool table and a separate smoking room.  The bartender was extra nice and attentive considering how crowded it was.  Pints of PBR just kept on comin' -- 4 each to be exact :-)!\n\nI was digging the bathroom -- I liked all the graffiti on the wall given it smelled and was very dirty.  Tagging on a public bathroom wall was fun.  There was a pink Sharpie pen by the sink -- I picked up the pen, wrote my name on the wall, then took a picture of it to post on Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/LIjMD-PXdrjEAykKVoAiLw?select=yO74nUMNO73rTD0xhZr2iQ).  \n\nI think I've inhaled the most second hand smoke I have ever had last night at Delirium's smoking room.

Instead of causing a large scene I paid for the drinks and gave the extra drink away. I told him twice I did not order it and I do not want it. I should have just left. I had quite a few friends so that is why I did not just bounce nor make a scene. I never worked with nor seen someone make a mistake and make the customer pay for it.  even though it was busy I have been in and around food service and bartending for about two decades. I worked in Bars like Zeitgeist and Midtown that is now called Moltovs in Lower Haight and Upper Haight at bars like the full moon saloon that are no longer around.t. I never ever had a bartender pour me a drink that I did not order and then give me a truly vile attitude to pay for it. I walked into t crowded bar and realized it might take time to get a drink. I understanding having patience on a busy night. I and the people around me felt ignored repeatedly by this guy Travis walking buy entire swaths of people that had been waiting for his service over and over and after I heard three different groups speak on his attitude I realized it was not just me.

It doesn't matter to what type of music, as long as they are drunk enough and want to dance. The room where the dancing takes place is the best, because it is A LOT less crowded than in the actual bar, and there is also seating for everyone. The bar does have some TVs, but they were playing movies off of TBS, which I thought was an interesting choice... ?\n\nThe only thing to look out for is that the bathrooms are not that well labeled, so be sure to double-check before you enter.\n\nOverall, it was an okay bar.

However Saturday is 80's (some early 90's like Nirvana) night which is probably my favorite night there. Yes they do tend to spin the same tracks each time (Don't Stop Believin, Hey Mickey, Under Pressure, Sweet Dreams) but you're usually so drunk off the two dollar tecates and delirious from the fumes of about 100 sweaty people dancing around you that all you can think about is how much fun it is to sing Journey with an entire bar. \n\nExtra half star for the bacon hot dog cart outside the bar...definitely my future husbands.", "author": "Tam G."}

Oh yeah, there's a back room where you used to be able to smoke, but now you can only dance back there. If you're a girl (and I'm excluding punk/hardcore girls), you will not like the bathroom.\n\nAmbiance: Um, it's not really hipster-ishy in here as some reviewers might suggest. It's more of a hardcore crowd mixed with the indie folk, mixed with your rare punk and heavy metal folk, and yes, some hipsters. What they all have in common is their love for cocaine off of bathroom urinals. The dance scene in the back room is pretty sweet.

I guess I always go here on weeknights, when you a pretty hardcore clientle. They play New Order and Blondie. On a Saturday, though, you get the full B&T experience. It was packed, felt like a frat party, and extremely sweaty. The music was horrible. I mean, it was a frat party, they were playing Nelly.

She lives on Albion, and as fate would have it, Delirium lay between me and the cab I eventually made it into much, much later than planned. Word to the wise: when you are 33 years old, have some lifestyle standards and have been drinking champagne all night long, it is better to just walk on by the cute hipster boys smoking pot outside a bar in the Mission at 2 a.m. Far more advisable than, say, joining them for a drink at Delirium.\n\nThat said I do remember the following things about Delirium:\n\n-Lots of cute hipster boys, all of whom probably just turned legal.

They play a fine selection of 80s (and +/- 10 years) music, which is great because everyone there always knows where they were when that particular song came out. So lots of energy, lots of dancing.\n2. Pretty much a hook-up dive bar. Everyone is macking on everyone else, and there's all kinds of options available.\n3. Dogs are allowed, and you'll see canines imbibing freely with the patrons. I sincerely hope they autoclave the glasses nightly.\n4. The location is pretty good, crowds tend to spill out to the street after everyone gets kicked out at the end of the night, so theres an option for last minute phone numbers.\n\nCons:\n1. They only take cash - no plastic. Ridiculous for an establishment that serves booze. You want patrons to keep buying rounds, instead of having to leave to look for ATMs.\n2. The back room is permanently hazy with smoke - which is fine if you're on your third lung. Not so great if you prefer breathing and visibility.\n3. The floor and the bar get real sticky, real quick. And because of the layout of the place, having a conversation that isn't intended to get you laid (like with a friend, perhaps?) is near impossible. Also, you'll get jostled by an endless parade of drunks and mobility impaired.\n4. The drinks are *way* too small. C'mon guys, you're a bar with a 400% markup on alcohol. Don't be stingy with the booze! \n\nMy friend ordered a white russian and was told \"The coffee machine is broken\" by the bartender. Ummm... when I mentioned that half-and-half was what the recipie called for, I was told \"none of that either\". Ten minutes later, he ordered a Baileys with cream, and that came along without any problem.

Apparently my bartender did (the big fluffy muscle one who was wearing a black wife-beater).  I ordered a gin and tonic, and without looking at me he decided to complain to everyone sitting at the bar saying things like \"Look at this place...its packed!  the only drinks I should be serving are beers and shots!\"  I felt terrible, I had no idea it was going to be that hard to make a gin and tonic.

This place is filthy, but that is the price one pays for dirt-cheap cocktails, the right to smoke inside (hello?) and amazing, incredible dance music.\r\n\r\nYes, dance music. The back room constantly astounds me; in San Francisco, I have never found a space (a true space!) that invites the sort of heedless hedonism that Delerium does. I can absolutely recommend arriving at 10PM on a Wednesday, securing yourself the corner booth by the DJ, and settling in for hours and hours of classic rock and fucking roll that manages to be both danceable and listenable to whilst sitting and drinking $2 Tecate and $4 shots of whiskey. Unparalleled drunken revelry, my friends.\r\n\r\nThe back room aside, there is free pool on Mondays, but if the place gets crowded (i.e. after 11PM), forget about playing a decent game. And the jukebox is commendable, if slightly biased towards a few esoteric, cacophonous strains of punk music. And the clientele veers towards \"hipsters\" if you still believe in the validity of that term. But forget about Fridays and Saturdays - this place gets tragically crowded to the point of impossibility.\r\n\r\nSo really, and also truly, if you are seeking a mid-week destination that sincerely evokes the holiest trinity of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, then you can do no better than Delerium.

Real graffiti involves curse words, line art of genitalia, and gang tags.  People do not write \"hahaha\" or \"pork\" in big letters, or have tags that say \"Frederick Edgar Jameson, III, Esquire.\"  (Okay, so I made that last one up.)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-06", "description": "Goddamn, I sure seem to end up here a lot. Why? There's really nothing shocking about experiencing this particular Delirium. It's a bar. Some small tables along one wall, a booth in front, the usual stools, and a black-hole room in back where DJs spin after 10 pm. Checkered tile floor. Gray walls with lithographed rock posters. Enjoyable jukebox. Pool. Pinball. And the crowd is usually just fine...although, as with most things at the nexus of 16th Street and Guerrero/Valencia, you're better off going early, before the lemmings swarm in and take everything over.\n\nFrankly, the most instantly outstanding characteristic of Delirium is its motto: \"Service for the Sick.\" Now THAT is a manifesto worth supporting!\n\nBut the real reason I love Delirium is this. Let me tell you a story....\n\n[...insert flashback waves here...]\n\nPicture it: December 2006. It was, as the cliche goes, a cold and rainy night. And, so it happens, the date of the annual SantaCon pub crawl and chaos party. For those who don't know, SantaCon is a yearly excuse for Cacophony Society weirdos to dress like Santa, get completely trashed, and terrorize every boring bourgeois drone they can find. They call it \"Santarchy\" and it is just a few Jaegermeisters short of a riot.\n\nSo on this chilly, wet day in December, there is a group of people dressed in Santa suits and sipping beers at Delirium. Note that I said \"sipping\" beers...because it quickly became clear that this was not the real SantaCon, just some bland-ass Marina types who had heard something about dressing up like Santa and hitting a few bars. They were quiet, respectful, and utterly, shamefully BORING.\n\nThe bartender at Delirium, thankfully, knew all about SantaCon and, had he not been scheduled to work, admitted he would have joined the alcoholic holiday fray himself. Thus he was becoming increasingly agitated by the non-antics of the wack wannabe Santas.\n\n\"Come on!!!\" he shouted. \"I thought you guys were supposed to be the crazy drunken Santas! Do something!\"\n\nNo response from the polite, preppy Santa squad.\n\n\"OK, free whiskey shots for anyone who jumps onto the bar and starts dancing!\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"You people are pathetic! You make me sick!\"\n\nNo response again. Finally, the bartender had had enough.\n\n\"All right, all you assholes get the fuck out of my bar!! Santas, get out! You're pathetic! Cock smokers!!! Get out now!\"\n\nConfused, our sad Santas sorta shuffled towards the front door and left the bartender red-faced and huffing mad.\n\nFinally, with Poseurcon 2006 (as I had decided to name it) taking its lifeless party to some other venue, the bartender was able to calm down. He served up a round of free Jameson shots for those of us who remained. We drank. We swore. We cursed the poseurs. And everything got better with a quickness.\n\n[...end of flashback...]\n\nLong story short: Any beerhole where the bartender encourages costumed mayhem and kicks out those who fail to comply...well, that's a place I'm glad to spend my money.\n\nHell, there's still time to go there right now!\n\nPS: Lest you think I'm making this up, read another Yelper's previous post from 12/11/2006. Clearly we're \"on different pages,\" as my former yuppie boss would have said, but the fact remains: Delirium doesn't endorse boredom. Be \"sick\" or be eighty-sixed.", "author": "John G."}

I don't even know what it means to be a hipster. I just dress the way I dress.\n\nThat said, it's not that I don't like Delirium. I do. I really do, and it's one of the first places I used to regularly hang out at when I was new in town. Often a hit or a miss, but this is in the block where you're bound to run into someone you know, and it makes for a good time, generally. delirium isn't necessarily a dirt cheap or a fancy bar. It's a dive in the Mission, a place where neighbors and kids come out to play. Drinks are decent, and the bartenders are always nice. People mind their business and there's never drama. I enjoy the laid-back nature and the variety of music played here, as well as the occasional billiards, but having been offered a crack rock next to the pin-ball machine by some cholo, provided that I ditch my boyfriend, kind of made me like the place less. I know that's not necessarily an experience related to the bar operating itself the way it does, but this was kind of like just another reason to try to scope out another place to go in the Mission. it's not like this is the only bar.\n\nThe other thing that started to get to me was the amount of East Bay bros that obviously crossed the bridge to come here on the weekends. Or the ones from North Beach that decided it was cool to branch out. There is little place in the Mission for popped collar and sport coats, and especially no room for hair gel and silly pickup lines... please. It is menacing. Who behaves this way anymore? I could look past this if it weren't for the fact that everytime I'm outside smoking some creep who claims to be an artist would start talking to me and try to get me to go home with him. Or the fact that each time I go, the bar seems emptier and emptier and there is something so sad/pathetic about a few scattered individuals getting wasted alone in an empty bar, drowning their sorrows in vodka. I haven't hit mid-life crisis yet and I'd rather hang out somewhere more lively.\n\nAll that aside, if I'm invited to hang out I always stop in.", "author": "Y K."}

Now, I'm sure that in a \"dive\" like Delirium, this was just too G-D much.

If you're into sunlight, they have a lovely booth surrounded by glass bricks in the front, but if you're practically a vampire, like myself, then the back of the bar is for you.  \n\nOn Saturday's from open until 7:00pm they have a great happy hour.  $2 PBR (on tap, not in a can), and $3 for all other tap beers except Chimay.  They give you free freshly popped popcorn, free pool, and there is even a free BBQ.  Sweet.  I did burn the crap out of my fingers on a braut, but that was my own fault.\n\nThe bartender was super nice, and the crowd was surprisingly eclectic, and friendly.  I spent a good deal of my time chatting with a hot Irish drummer... Nothing wrong with that.  \n\nThe cons...the women's  bathroom is kind of awful.  There is only one stall, and there is a huge tripping hazard as the actual bathroom floor is about 3 inches lower than the floor on the other side of the door.  That might not sound like a big deal, but when you're drunk, that sucks.  There also aren't any mirrors, which I also was not a fan of.  I think the jukebox could use a little updating.  I tried not to keep playing songs off the same 5 or 6 albums but I failed.  I just couldn't find anything else.  \n\nIf you like grungy places, as I do, you will like Delirium.

Did the bar attract good company or did good company make the bar? I had a great time at Delirium the other night. There are so many bars on that strip to choose from and I rarely opt for Delirium. I found though that it has something for everyone. Bar area, pool table, arcade game, dance floor. It did get extremely crowded on Saturday night but people streamed in and out so quickly that you just had to bear with it for a few minutes and then you could breathe again. People watching was great - I found the crowd to be pretty diverse for a Mission divey place. I also enjoyed me a PBR. Delirium loses a major star for bathroom quality. I expect pretty nasty shit but this was bad. Plus, only one stall for women? The line was so bad that I rallied a couple girls around me, busted into the men's room and had them guard the door for me. Survival of the fittest, and I won.", "author": "Susan L."}

Ladies, do your kegels because you may be in for a long night of holding it in. Gents, exercise your enviable right to pee elsewhere, while enjoying the in-and-out privileges I so adore about this place. Sure, it's hot. Sure, it's packed. You may find yourself conversing with a dreaded musician who is clearly too high to be anywhere but Taco Bell or in the presence of a gallon of Rocky Road. I can't stand it when places are so packed it denies me the capability to move without some 'bows in my ribcage. This will likely be the case, but you'll be too busy enjoying your deliciously stiff drink and then eloquently explaining to your friend after closing that you're on the corner of San Pablo and A**hole.

Didn't think anything of it, thought I would just pop in for a chill night with friends.  In fact, I was excited because I wasn't even drinking and I still thought it'd be a cool place just to hang out and shoot the shit with some of my buddies.  The bartender however, expected something different.  I was hanging out at the table, minding my own business when he came over and asked for my ID - after I had already been in there sitting, not drinking a drop of alcohol - not even a glass in my hand.  I told him I wasn't drinking and the bartender went into a hysterical fit.  He demanded that he see my ID - which I showed him, and I'm 25 - and he kept on going off into hysterics.  My friends and I got up to leave, because he was really being strange and he started shouting vulgarities at us as I walked out the door.  I seriously think this guy had either a nervous breakdown or lost his mind and my friends and I witnessed the whole thing go down.  Really unfortunate because I thought this could be a cool place.

Nobody who lives within such close proximity to the City's highest concentration of bars, entertainment venues, and house parties is going to make a night out of hanging out at Delirium. So why the fuck is everyone always here you wonder. Theoretically, it makes no sense. Realistically speaking, you're here. Debt collectors should quit wasting time making prank calls and writing ransom notes and just come down here in person to kick your defaulting ass. But seriously, how many more times of rubbing elbows with a frenemy will it take to teach you a lesson? Actually, how many more times of watching a pair of bicurious hipsters flail about vaguely in sync to the Knife's Heartbeats before it gets old? I thought that the time I'd ever hear a bridge-and-tunnel girl proclaim Delirium as \"a really awesome bar\" before bolting for the bathroom stall to snort a line would just about  do it. But inexplicably, I came back (again) and threw away (yet again) what basically amounted to an $12 six-pack of Tecate. I don't know, I've basically accepted the fact that if I ever have a bad time, I can at least walk away with free packs of Camels from that one dude that makes this bar his first and last stop of the night.
