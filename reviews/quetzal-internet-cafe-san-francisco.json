I used to go there and get chocolate skinny cow shakes and read a book, or sometimes just get a coffee and people watch on Polk. Sadly, the skinny cow shakes are long gone and the menu has become more vegetarian and environmentally friendly but that's San Francisco for you. Still, the interior is a comfortable space and it IS nice that tasty sandwiches can be purchased now.", "author": "Frank L."}

The space itself is excellent, with plenty of seating and electrical outlets. \n\nHowever, I could not get the wifi to work. I struggled with it for an hour, and the staff was unable to help me. My laptop generally has no problems connecting anywhere else, and I was able to connect through my phone's data connection, although that is a less than optimal solution. Having come here specifically to get some work done, the non-functional wifi was a dealbreaker. \n\nIt appears that I was the only one having problems with the wifi, so it is possible that whatever the issue is it was unique to me.

Tuesday July 10 at 4 PM my wallet was stolen from my backpack that was hung on the back of my chair. I was sitting at the bar seating near the front counter. The guy sitting behind me quickly unzipped and reached in the backpack. I realized what had happened when I got up to leave and noticed my backpack was wide open and my wallet was gone.\n\nYes, I realize I should have been more aware (I was focused on my computer). The management and employees there also need to be more aware and kick out the homeless/junkies/pick-pockets that just wander in and loiter around the cafe unchecked and free to steal from the customers. They really need to hire a security guard.\n\nDescription of the thief is: African American Male, 45 to 55 Years Old, 6ft + Tall, Baseball Cap, Oversized Sport Coat and Khaki Baggy Pants.\n\nThe cafe manager said the security video camera captured the moment of the theft, but he couldn't see the guy's face clearly. I remember him sitting behind me and I thought he looked homeless, but also thought he was harmless. Man was I wrong. He's likely a pro street-thief.\n\nSit here at your own risk. On second thought, just go somewhere else. This cafe is definitely Not Safe and Sketchy AF!", "author": "Dan F."}

Once you take some of the chicken out, it's not a bad sandwich. The chicken they use is some precut/pre cooked chicken. Probably the frozen stuff. Little bland. Nothing gourmet about it. However, they use great focaccia bread! Super yummy bread and a nice little caesar dressing on it to make it flavorful. \n\nCan't comment on the turkey club that my friend got since I didn't try it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-05", "description": "I'm only going to address the cafe as I experience it and remember it.  It used to be classier.  In the past, customers had a chance at real dining.  A waiter came to your table to serve water, gave you a menu, and took your order.  Today, the service is cafeteria style.  You stand in line and place your order with a cashier (if he or she is paying you any attention; otherwise, you have to call the cashier to attention or wait).  A service boy brings you your order and quickly disappears.  Receiving your order does not take long.  \n\nThe seating arrangement in the cafe is lousy.  Sunshine and its heat really burn up the place, keeping it overly warm when it's not winter, and the shades and windows look like they once belonged to Ms. Haversham's home from Charles Dickens's \"Great Expectations\" -- old, worn, and in disrepair, and the cement floors and metallic walkways turn the place into a noisy echo chamber.  \n\nWhy does a customer have to hear the prolonged, loud stomping of feet when a man or woman exits the bathroom two tiers up and walks all the way down the metal walkway and out the door?  \n\nIn the back area of this large restaurant, laptop-using students or computer nerds who have no intention of making their stay brief occupy the most comfortable and shaded spots available.  The rest of the seating area in the back is ablaze in bright sunlight with excessive heat such that even if you manage to endure the waiting period seated here waiting for your order, you will have to listen to the incessant chatter and monologizing of at least one or two of San Francisco's priceless, mental hospital escapees who also have no intention of making their stay brief.  Listening to whatever others cloistered in the back chatter loudly on their cell phones is no better treat.\n\nThe men's bathroom looks like a smudgy highway restroom at any anonymous gas station.  It used to be only customers used these facilities -- if the cashier gave you a key.  Today anybody can walk in and out -- without even being a customer, and that's the reason for the dark and smudgy way it looks.\n\nThe middle area where seating is close to the food bar so you can see the service boy exiting the kitchen with your order is often crowded as well, but it is an area that welcomes the less talkative and noisy.  There are holes in the long dining tables where your Internet connection goes.  Without a computer, you feel like you're just dining in a place that's like a garage that makes certain technicians happy to be there when they're there, but makes no sense to anyone else.  The holes don't have covers.  I guess the owner stopped replacing the stolen ones.\n\nLastly, there's the music that comes over the intercom.  The restaurant goes out of its way to appeal to young people, youth who view themselves as hip, as cool.  I listened to so much music from the Sixties on my first visit there that the songs forced me to relive my entire late adolescence and early twenties -- from Cat Stevens to Mick Jagger over and over again.  The second time I dined at Quetzal the music was of the type called world music with some sort of jazz-fusion spin to it.  Again, because the restaurant is an echo chamber, even low volume music makes you feel you're inside a large stadium with speakers going full blast.  \n\nIt never used to be like this.  The music used to be quieter and always tasteful and instrumental if a little boring.  You could eat in peace and be in your own world, not the world the service personnel chooses randomly for you.\n\nThe best part of Quetzal, however, is the food.  A lot of five-star reviewers speak of Quetzal's food.  I agree.  I have ordered the Cobb Salad over and over again, either to go or \"for here.\"  It is absolutely healthy and delicious and there is artistry in its design or presentation.   It makes me happy just to look at it.  Under 10 dollars, this salad is a real bargain.  (But once I order coffee and pay the tax and the tip, the meal comes to $15.  That's a bit pricey.)  And, I think, the price is definitely worth the value you get.  I've checked out all the other restaurants in the neighborhood offering large salads or the famous Cobb Salad, and nowhere are you going to find in lower or upper Polk or lower Nob Hill such abundance at so low a cost as you find at Quetzal.  That's why I keep going.  The salad is good for me, filling and delicious, and the price, considering the competition, is completely reasonable, aka a real bargain.\n\nI also recommend take-out.", "author": "Charles S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-19", "description": "Finding serenity from the madness of Polk is easy at Quetzal. The free WiFi is a huge plus for those of us who enjoy people watching and surfing the internet at the same time and the drinks aren't half bad. For those of you wondering, a quetzal is the national bird of Guatemala. No, I don't see a correlation either.\n\nFirst timers might be initially confused when entering: does one sit down and establish a spot or order from the counter first? I can never decide. Judging by the other confused looks of patrons coming in, it's clear I'm not the only one. \n\nTo ensure the staff I'm not here just to leech WiFi, I order something at the counter first and then pick my spot for the next hour or three. My spot will almost always be an area that has an outlet. Thankfully, there are plenty in every direction. If you choose to sit along the back wall (facing the front), then be prepared to share outlets.\n\nWhen it comes to ordering something, I stick with drinks. Coffee / tea is available for caffeine chasers, but the smoothies keep me satisfied. A power shake with a little blackberry keeps me hydrated, even if it's not my favorite flavor in the world. In the 1st world, these are hardly problems.\n\nNot feeling like any of the above? Shoot for their beer on tap. Nothing like sucking down a frosty one during the warmer months and surfing a little internet. Oh and they have a real happy hour deal ($3 on tap!), which goes until close. \n\nThen there is the food. I can't seem to stomach anything beyond breakfast. The smoked salmon scramble is among the only winners of the bunch, not be outdone from a slew of super subpar items that include: nachos, quesadillas, club sandwiches, pizzas, and salads. Save for a slice of quiche, pie, or something in their pastry lineup, but even those feel a tad overpriced.\n\nLastly, the internet connection I've experienced has been stellar so far. There have been some quips about low quality internet, but unless good luck has been on my side, I haven't had to deal with any slow speeds at all. If anything, it's the one thing that keeps me coming back.", "author": "Jando S."}

What I don't get it how 1 of my pastries taste like sour mold and smells like mold. I discovered it by not smelling it first but simply putting it in my mouth, chewing and instantly tasting sour mold almost warm...disgusting. At my job ( a nearby restaurant) I literally spit it out into my hand in front of people....it was that bad....so I take it back seeing how I spent near 4 dollars for it and the girl tells me. \"No it csnt be we just got those in this morning.\" So now I'm lying? I ask her to smell it I tell her to even taste it she continues to defend her pastry claiming \"she'll show me the invoice from this morning .\" I told her i didn't care if they received it aa I Walked in the store its rotten.

This is far less a coffeehouse for social mingling and more solitary confinement for those who want to be left alone staring at their screens. There were quite a few such people there, but I find it difficult to tag them as customers since I didn't see any evidence of food or even drink next to their self-imposed work stations. It just never appears to me that the staff there is clamping down on enforcing table turnover so that the rest of us could eat and chat.\n\nAh well, I have to concede \"Internet\" is in the name. That's probably the main reason I'm not tempted to have a full-fledged meal here. I end up here to have a $3.50 cup of coffee or tea after a meal with maybe a similarly premium-priced slice of pie like the one in the photo I provided (Blueberry Tart...good from what I recall). The staff doesn't appear to be pushing the food much despite what looks to be a robust menu of items in their online food menu. I didn't even know you could get breakfast here. I think the recent addition of the sidewalk parklet definitely helps open up the space, a good thing as I felt like I was in the library otherwise.

It's like whoever is back there is genuinely thinking about how to make each dish as good as it can be for the person that's going to eat it. Portions are big, the cheese on my egg sandwich was fully melted and fully covered the egg and bacon below it, the slices of lox for my bagel and lox that I've also tried were thicker than I've ever seen, and the onion and tomato was placed under the lox so it was easy to cut and eat by hand without them falling off. The bagel was perfectly toasted, no burned spots but a nice dark, crisp toast all over.\n\nIt's also a great place to work, tons of seating, bar height and table height, good spots to people watch or just hide in a corner. Outlets all over, wireless is very good, and I've never been pestered about how long I stay. Outdoor seating in the parklet makes for a nice spot to take a lunch break with a cold beer. They put the tables and chairs out each morning and wipe them down so it's always clean despite on a somewhat busy and dirty part of Polk St.\n\nFair warning, this place can sometimes attract an interesting, probably homeless crowd, service can be somewhat inconsistent as it seems like the staff turns over quite a bit, and I've never been in when it was especially crowded so service could suffer during those times. The counters, tables, chairs are a bit rough around the edges, like they were built in someone's workshop as opposed to professionally constructed, but that's not a big deal, just makes it look a bit shabby.", "author": "Richard A."}

No signs, no aplogies. Just a chaotic, dingy, FILTHY mess. No soap, an array of dirty of paper towels on the floor.  On top of all of that, there is the inhumane process of having to ask the cashier to buzz you into that pit any time you need to use it. I'd put up with that if the bathrooms were private and not festering with bacteria.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? A grumpy, non-smiling cashier who clearly hates working there as much as I hated being there this morning.  \n\nQuetzal, invest in improving the environment for your customers who are paying quite decently for your food and drink. I highly doubt your restrooms even comply with code. \n\nIf you're craving the adventure of travel to a developing country, but don't have the time or funds, take a whirl through Quetzal's one and only bathroom. You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Nette J."}

I finally brought my friend David N. here for a visit this afternoon. \n\nAmbiance and Service: I was so excited when I finally made my way here. The interior was slick colorful with shades of upbeat yellow and soothing orange to compliment plenty of nice looking plants. Initially I wanted to add this cafe to my regular line up of places to hang out, but my experience turned out sour and disappointing. While I was actively looking to find their macaroons and coffee cake which they later told me they had ran out, their male servers were very rude and impatient. One of them became very upset with me when I was in the process of choosing my drink, and rather than helping me with an introduction with what was good here, he stood there looking annoyed. The nice female server had to calm him down and made some suggestions which I thought was helpful.\n\nDessert and Drink: I thought her recommended mixed fruit pie was solid, but the iced soy mocha was not well made at all. The drink was culminated by un-dissolved chocolate powder clumped at the bottom like a landfill that prompted a rough grainy finish. In retrospect, these alternative desserts along with the poor service were not enough to dissuade my disappointment for missing out on the two things I came for, the macaroons and coffee cake.\n\nWifi:  Contrary to Neil S. and Kristine W's reviews, their internet was not free during my visit, but 16 cents per minute according to their staff. As soon as that was said, I realized that I really don't have a purpose for being here so decided to pack up my laptop and quickly made my exit. \n\nWhat a waste of time and effort!

But, by and large, this place is not all that great.\n\nI first visited Quetzal in March of 2012 during a visit to San Francisco.  I stopped in to get a smoothie (the vegan and non-vegan options were great) and use their internet.  Over the course of my week long visit I stopped in there one more time and had a pleasant experience with both the staff and their product.  I thought the place was great.\n\nFast forward 9 months and I've officially moved to San Francisco.  One of my first stops was, of course, Quetzal.  I'm an avid coffee drinker and I often telecommute for work, so a favorite local coffee spot is a nice thing to have.  However, in the interim since I had last been there, something seems to have gone to shit.  \n\nWhile their drinks have remained great, their customer service had taken a serious nose dive.  They close at random times, don't keep regular business hours, and routinely made me wait for my drink while they prepared an easier one for someone standing in line behind me.  That, and their buzz-you-into-the-bathroom set up is just ridiculous.  I know they must get a lot of non-paying walk-ins trying to use the bathroom, so I get putting some kind of lock on it, but that just isn't working out.  Also, whoever is buzzing them in from the counter is often mumbling under their breath while they do it.  \n\nI've always enjoyed the beer they have on tap there and their abundant supply of electrical outlets near their tables, but I don't know that I ever see myself returning.", "author": "Mario B."}

I came in and order a beverage which was fine.  Later, I went to the counter to order food and waited at least 10 minutes because someone was on the phone and doing something to the register. Your paying customers should always come first.  Put the person on the phone on hold and conduct their business after your customers have been taken care of.  I couldn't tell if they were putting in a supply order or what.  I finally order a Zesty Burrito.  It was brought out to me and looked okay at first.  I was brought condiments that were almost empty.  Fill your ketchup, salt, and pepper etc.  This is such an easy fix.  I came in the morning so there is no excuse to give me empty ketchup bottles and not wipe off he tops. Next, I notice my burrito is missing 3 of the 9 ingredients.  When I return to the counter, the cashier argues with me that it is only one missing ingredient.  Well, why is it missing anything in the first place.  The cashier clearly does not know how to deal with customers.  The cook came out and didn't seem to say much.  Either he doesn't know the menu, or he was making it the way he wanted. I then point out the ingredients on the signs behind them on the huge billboard.  He realizes there is stuff missing and tells me they are out of the beans, but they can add avocado and the salsa.  Well, should't you tell me before I order that you are out of something?  It happens.  Restaurants run out of things but, be up front and don't serve me something I ordered with three things missing after I pay for something.  Then, I decided that after this guy argued with me, I don't want to reorder, they seemed to be irritated that I wanted my money back.  Honestly, I just didn't want the cook to spit in my food.  It wasn't until another person (from the back) came out that there was an actual apology given to me.  This is service 101 people.  If you screw up just apologize and move on but don't argue, then get an attitude because I asked for my money back.  If you are out of something just tell me and be honest.

Were you hiding behind a car or something? Maybe a convicted pie stalker?\"\n\n\"Man... I was about to tear that pie UP. I was waitin', but man you had about 30 more seconds, no lie.\" Customers at another table found it rather amusing.\n\nOff he jogs, thankfully my pie untouched. I pour a cup of perfectly steeped organic hojicha and settle in to relax, alternating between Pandora stations, a little 60s Reggae and then some Chet Baker.

I didnt find it cute at all as im not trying to spend 10 bucks on a smoothie, I gave him my order twice and he's just playing stupid games and wasting my time. As I was paying another guy chimes in with \"Wayne likes to be well tipped\" in a really douchy tone...i guess my dollar tip wasnt enough. After I got my drink, I realized he had charged me for two. I went back to the counter where another medium smoothie sat. I told him Id been overcharged, he countered with \"Your friend ordered one.\". As I wasnt in line with anyone that would be impossible and I told him as much. After 30 seconds of more ridiculousness, he told me he'd give me a refund but he himself would have to pay for the extra mystery upsell smoothie. Was it supposed to be like a guilt trip or something?

So I checked it out the first time, and got a bagel with hummus, tomato, and cucumber. I could only get half of it down, that hummus quite frankly tasted and looked like baby poop. I've worked in the food service industry a lot so I really try not to knock stuff that harsh, but I'm Greek and that hummus made me one sad Hellenic.\n\nAlso: $4 for a maybe-12-oz cup of fresh-squeezed OJ? Suck it, that is not cool.\n\nSo why did I go back? Because I realized they have a wider menu than the baby poo hummus, I always like to give places a second chance, and I'm an orange juice snob and haven't found another outlet for fresh-squeezed in my new 'hood yet.\n\nGot the Quetzal frittata the second time and it was actually really good, just HUGE. HUGE! The size of the plate! Luckily, I love giving my leftovers away to homeless people, and this one was very well received; I found the to-go box totally empty on a curb an hour after I gave it away. Still felt robbed (EVERYTHING is stupid overpriced), especially while I sipped my OJ extra slow to try to make the $4 last.\n\nThen I needed to use a computer since my laptop bought the farm, and so back to Quetzal I went, because I was hungry too and figured hey, two birds with one stone. Decided to try the cobb salad this time and asked about the public computers....they're 16 cents a minute. 16 cents a minute? Who the hell came up with that? That is such a random amount to me. And why, when all of your food and drink are overpriced out the a*s, would you still be charging on public computers when you're a 20 minute walk from the main public library? So I just sadly paid $17 for a salad and my OJ (yes, you heard me) and did the research that preceeded my computer use. The dressing on the salad was way too thick and intense, I frankly couldn't finish it, not even half, and I wasn't even about to give it to a homeless person because it seemed mean.\n\nThe one thing I will give Quetzal is they have a very nice sitting area and lots of windows, and I dig that. Also, some of their employees are super nice. But then there's this one chick with black hair who is seriosly rude as sh*t, she's been there the past two times I went and if she's in there next time I seriously will go somewhere else. I like the older guy and the younger blond dude, but that chick with the black hair, man....not cool.\n\nSo basically, I will probably go back to Quetzal, but I'm really going to try not to for a while because quite frankly I can't afford them. And there's plenty of better coffee shops in the Tenderloin that don't make you feel like you've just been backhanded across the face after you pay.", "author": "Kyveli S."}

For $3.80 each, the barista grinds the freshest beans to prepare our respected beverages. Both of our 16oz drinks also comes with \"mountain-size\" heaping of fattening whipped cream, and her caramel mocha comes with a drizzle of the caramel on top of the clouded cream. Her drink can be mistaken for a gourmet dessert from a fancy restaurant. When we first sip our drinks, we get a piece of whipped cream from our beverage on the tip of our nose (sorry, no pictures). We also split a Blueberry Scone for $2.25. I'm also not a scone-guy, but that pastry was surprisingly very moist and show no taste of aridity.

The cashier was awful and unfriendly and could not answer a simple question snot portion size of the quesadilla that were about to order. She was on her phone the entire time we were there . I asked if I could could use the bathroom... She has to buzz me in . When I got inside I went to use the larger stall but it had crap speared on the toilet seat and 0 toilet paper. When I went to use the other stall the toilet seat looked disgusting but I had to go so I decided to suffer through it and squat . The faulty door did not lock as other users had commented . Since the toilet seat was so disgusting I was mainly focused on squaring and not touching anything when the faulty door swung forward and knocked me hard in the face . Within just a few minutes my noise started turning blue and swollen. Awful place with poor service, standards .. Oh and the quesadilla we ordered..

I AM WITHIN THE YELP GUIDLINES. I WITNESSED THIS INCIDENT FIRST HAND! STOP BEING SHADY & SUCH A DESPICABLE BUSINESS & CLEAN UP YOUR EMPLOYEES, NOT YOUR YELP REVIEWS! MY REVIEW STILL STANDS:  My friend & I witnessed a male employee of Quetzal beat a homeless girl down in the street last month, while their douchey patrons stood by & just watched it happen. He delivered a few hard blows to her face & head & then after throwing her down on the ground, kicked her in the ribs, back & head multiple times. The girl didn't even try to defend herself. My friend & I called the police, since nobody else seemed to have the decency to care about the small girl crumpled on the ground. Once they arrived a female employee of Quetzal who resembled a gremlin, tried to justify the public beating claiming it was self defense. Right. She told us to go home & then threatened to beat our asses too. My friend is blatantly 5 months pregnant. Keep it classy Quetzal, you belong in the Tenderloin.", "author": "Amber S."}

I came in, thinking I could eat in with a quick bagel (with lox and cream cheese) and coffee. I bit my tongue at the price, but hoped the food would be worth the price.\n\nIf you're eating in, you get a stanchion and someone will be out with your food as you sit in the back seating area. While waiting for my food, I took a brief look at the rows of computers. I was impressed that they had Macs and large screens. I think this may have been the first time I've stepped foot in an internet cafe in the US. \n\nThere were at least 4 other groups/people who were already seated, waiting for their food, too. After a good 25 minutes, they brought all the food out at the same time. If I had been seated earlier, I would have been livid that they didn't bring my food out earlier. Because it did seem like they waited until everyone's food was prepared before they took them out.\n\nSo, with only 15 minutes left, I scarfed down my food. The lox was so delicious, as was the coffee. Had I known service would be this bad, I would have made arrangements to come in earlier. This is the type of food that I would linger for, especially since the seating was near lots of windows.\n\nIf I'm ever in the area again, I would come back.

So-so espresso, pretty good food, and the service was adequate both mornings I went.\n\nEvenings are a different story.  The wait staff I encountered were rude both times; although there are signs advertising \"open late night\", they closed the kitchen at 9 the first time I went and the whole thing closed at 10.  \"We're open late on weekends,\" they said.  Ok, noted.\n\nPlus, I had arrived at 7:45, so in order to get my last 15 minutes of internet from 9:45 to 10:00, I had to buy something else, which I then had to chug before they closed.  I get why they don't let you sit on your computer forever without buying anything, but it doesn't always work as intended -- or maybe in their view, it does.\n\nI tried again on a weekend evening, and I asked what time they closed.  \"10:00\" was the answer.

We freelancers who can only really work in coffee shops and cafes would rather follow our unwritten laws to maintain a degree of modicum than be told what our limits are.\n\nI almost feel like that, since they've installed the draft beer back in November, they've started catering to the urban yuppie scum bar crowd that takes over Polk Street on weekend nights (the same crowd that got rubbed out of SoMa and the Marina by the irresponsible suburban shit that comes in every weekend and wrecks the City).

But like the prideful Icarus aiming for the sun, this place got burned by their attempt at greatness, and by burned, i mean crisp like the piece of macaroni that falls into the flame when your are cooking mac and cheese, and you cant pull it out till you're done cause you dont wanna stop cooking midway through to save one stupid macaroni.\n\nIts time again people for A. B.'s top five list; Quetzal edition. \n\n1. Do you like cookies? Of course you do, who doesnt like cookies? I'll tell you who, Quetzal. Why? I'll keep telling you. Cookies are one of natures most magical treats, and as such they deserve to be kept in good condition for gastronomical pleasure. Quetzal sadly keeps them in a un-airconditioned box on the counter which gets blasted by the sun all day. So when you get that awesome sounding oatmeal choco chip delish mish. What you get is a rock hard rock of rockiness. And it costs you 2.50. Yup 2.50. For a cookie???????? WTF.\n\n2. onto the food in general. this place tries to bring you the exotic hoity toity fair of an upscale \"progressive\" cafe, and thats all nice and swell, but now when a fucking bagel with cream cheese costs you 3.50, and a salad plate out of a safeway package costs 10 bucks. I mean cmon, if you make this shit from hand, then sure. But dont bend me over for shit you just stick in the microwave and sever on oversized plates. \n\n3. WIFI, we all know im a stickler for wifi, and thats mostly because the tech is so cheap at this point it should be free anywhere in the city (see Seoul, korea) let alone in a cafe. BUT NO! Quetzal makes you pay for the overdone priviledge of wifi, and not only that, they give you a 2 hour limit. So if your right in the middle of something important online and you hit that 2 hour mark, so sorry my dear fellow, you gotta go buy another 2.50 rock to get another crack at it. \n\n4. Atmosphere. Nice and bright ill give em that, but chilly as my uncle vanili. maybe they should have spent less on all these fucking imacs and a little more on some insulation. \n\n5. Flies. They're annoying right? of course they're fucking annoying, their called flies for a reason fool. And Quetzal has tons of these bad ass winged mofos flying around your dome like it was made out of a poop sandwhich ( not good for the self-esteem, ill tell you that much). I dont know whether they have pools of stagnant water in the back attracting these fuckers (health code violation), or whether the snootyness of all these fucking imacs is stinking up this place and attracting these critters, but either way it aint pleasant. \n\nThere you go, my fellow city dwellers.

Oh, god, the music.  Where do they dig up this stuff?  Every song consists of a singer moaning vowels, an indigenous instrument or two, and some synthetic string-chords plunked down in Garage Band.  Many artists are played in the course of a day, perhaps, but they all stick to this theme.  I know saying it's Enya-like is a cliche; but all cliches conceal vital truths.  You can't get work done with that shit. \n\nSecondly, the prices.  This cafe's location is borderline Tender.  Yet the prices are certifiably Nob Hill.  The crowd is neither--a combination of lawyers, silicons and hostel tourists.\n\nOkay, if you're wealthy and new-age, frequent Cafe Gratitude and think \"compassionate capitalism\" is a real phrase, you'll go apeshit for Quetzal.

After working for about 45 minutes and ordering food and drink twice in that time, the music was cranked to a level we couldn't even shout above. This is an Internet cafe. Three sets of people were working, including my friend and I. She went up to the counter and politely requested the volume be turned down to the previous level, which had been fine. The female worker walked over and turned it down. Immediately a man came out from the kitchen and turned it back up. My friend walked back up and repeated the request; she turned it down again -- when a SECOND man came out, scolded her for doing so and headed for the volume. The female worker pointed to my friend (also a woman) and started to relay, very meekly, the request, and he looked right at my lovely, kind friend and mocked, \"Who? Her? Oh yeah, I heard it,\" and cranked the volume up double the unacceptable level. \"You can go outside if you want quiet\" he sneered. My friend and I chose to leave, and the two men laughed as we did, while the female worker cringed. Clearly they are used to bossing women around and being crazy rude for fun. We had been nothing but nice, quiet customers with a perfectly reasonable, polite request. It was clear that not only do they not give a damn about their customers; they actively hate them.

Usually it's OK, except one time when they were playing some Yanni-style music over and over and I nearly walked out.\nThe chicken breast sandwich is scrumptious, served on pita bread, real cloth napkins, heavy silverware, and a healthy salad. $10 is a decent price for that.  There are some problems--for example, to use the bathroom you have to grab the attention of a counterperson. 90% of the time this works, the other 10% it's a drag, because you have to walk back down the ramp to the front,etc. But at least this keeps the bums out of the bathrooms, which is pretty clean (but not up to my gf standards).\nOne night, this horrendous grinding noise started about 6pm. It was their \"roaster\" and it was very disruptive. It went on and on, and after 40 min we asked how long it was going to take, and they said a couple more hours.  ?? We left.

You sign up with your phone number and are given a four digit code (the end of your telly #) to tell the cashier whenever you buy a drink, and somewhere - magically - a team of Quetzal elves calculates your running total and you're awarded a free drink.  I don't know if you get  a coupon in the mail or if you're surprised with a \"This one's on the house, ma'am.\"  Sadly, I didn't live in the Tenderloin long enough to find out...\n\nThat said, Quetzal is a lovely place to get some work done.  As said before, they have free wifi (be sure to ask the barista for the password, which changes regularly - though not daily, as they insist.)  There are lots of tables and outlets and most customers have a laptop in tow.  I never drank the coffee, but the chai was good and their smoothies are pretty rocking.  They also serve wine & beer.\n\nThe sandwiches and salads are good but expensive for their size - most near $10.  The sandwiches come with a mixed green salad and house dressing, which is tasty but will stay on your breath for hours - beware!", "author": "Holly B."}

The interior has depth, delineated by ramps and the segmented  public computer section, and plenty of seating as you make your way from the front counter to the back of the Cafe. Quetzal also benefits from an abundance of daylight, which is a plus since I prefer natural lighting whenever possible. At night, the interior lighting allows for reading or studying and is not overly luminous for those who enjoy subtlety.\n\nAlthough I haven't deviated from the standard coffee and tea drinks, Quetzal has a wide selection of pastries, some of which are vegan, and sandwiches. The service I've experienced at Quetzal has always been friendly with a keen sense for efficiency.

I asked her to please take it somewhere else or outside and she went into a frenzy.  This is the type of customer you will run into often here so beware of that.\n\nLastly why they keep the bathroom locked I will never understand.

The coffee has a much deeper flavor and a real mule kick.  I get a mix of decaf--delicious and full full bodied--and regular (a boatload of caffeine)  If I drank straight regular, I'd take one sip, fly out the door and slam into the shopping cart of one of the Polk Street homeless.   If I drank their espresso, I'd be permanently on their ceiling.  All this for $1.45 or, if you want a day's worth of java, $1.65.\n\nNice scene in Quetzal's and outside--at the tables on the street it's mainly aging Queens, and inside it's hip people at computers.  And gorgeous hemp South American sweaters hanging on the walls.\n\nThe toilets are very clean but you have to get the counter guy to buzz you in.  BTW the counter guys are helpful but not chatty--they are usually too busy serving the line of Polk Street types waiting for  their coffees.\n\nSo, give this place a try.  If you're a regular, they take the last four numbers of your phone number and after ten cups--not all on the same day, I hope--you get a freebie.  Believe me, after ten cups, you have earned that freebie.   This coffee is so strong that it keeps your eyes permanently open.   And it's so much better than Red Bull and those poisonous drinks that rot your intestines and eat your stomach lining.  Who drinks that swill??????\n\nP.S.

I was in Quetzal towards the end of last February & I got on one of their I-Macs. I was on for a couple of hours, then paid for my time. The total seemed a little high so I mentioned this to the cashier. He said that I was on the computer for 2 hrs & 40 minutes. I knew for a fact that I was logged on from 8:12 to 10:12 exactly. Making it 2 hrs. even. I told him this, & he said that there was nothing he could do. I then went to the manager & told him the situation. He looked into their computer records & decided that even though the cashier had made a mistake, he was going to give me \"the benefit of the doubt\" & refund a mere $5, even though at 16 cents a minute a 40 minute discrepency would amount to $6.40. This all may not seem like much, but the experience really soured me on the whole place. I was talked down to & treated as if I was trying to cheat the system.
