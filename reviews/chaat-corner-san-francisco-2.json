Many, many times usually close to midnight since it's one of the few Indian spots open that late. We actually thought the food was middling except for their piping hot garlic naan and a questionably indigenous dish, tandoori chicken pizza. Looking for a quick dinner near Union Square, we came upon this tourist magnet of a restaurant on Cyril Magnin Street. The overabundance of staff and robust menu looked familiar from the other location, and our choices in return were quite predictable. Of course I ordered the $11.99 Tandoori Chicken Legs, and a succulent pair arrived sizzling on a hot iron plate over a bed of surprisingly raw white onions (photo: http://bit.ly/2EjaDdx).\n\nThe poultry was oddly dried out for dark meat. Jamie went for a safer bet, the $12.99 Chicken Tikka Masala, a somewhat watery curry plate with tandoori chicken breast, house spices, tomatoes, onions, cream, and fenugreek (photo: http://bit.ly/2nHlnbe). Although it was reasonably flavorful, it required a lot of jasmine rice to sop it all up. To offset the protein, we shared the $11.99 Okra Vegetable which they refuse to call bhindi masala even though that's what it was (photo: http://bit.ly/2FK6jBc). Swimming in onions, tomatoes, and garlic, it was unfortunately a sloppy mess with the chopped okra mushy. I kept wondering how long the staff kept it in the pot before serving it to unsuspecting customers like us. This Chaat Corner didn't elevate my opinion of their one-size-fits-all operation.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...predictably middling Indian food didn't delight our taste buds\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...big space but it still felt crowded in here\nSERVICE - 3 stars...on the iffy side\nTOTAL - 3 stars...this Chaat Corner didn't turn a corner for me", "author": "Ed U."}

The servers are distant and barely speak with you when handing you the menu, taking the order, and serving the food. The server even had a slightly annoyed face while serving us our food.\n\nI would recommend the samosa chaat. I have never had this before and am pleasantly surprised at how wonderful it tastes. I'd order this over samosas any day. The amount of sauces in this dish is splendid. I enjoy my sauces and this dish does the trick. It is very saucy, yet refreshing at the same time.\n\nMy party also ordered a chicken dish and lamb dish. These two come with curry, naan, basmati rice, and cucumbers. I felt they gave too much starch compared to the meat. The meat comes out on a bed of sliced onions, all settled atop a cast iron platter. This ensure the meat is still sizzling hot and cooking at your table.\n\nThe meat would have been good if only it wasn't burnt. We saw other tables order the same type of dishes and their meat was fine. When we received ours, it was burning so badly that a thick cloud of smoke began to swallow up our table and the area surrounding it. It made me cough and choke. Other guests were visibly distraught over the smoke as well.

Normally Chili Chicken has this particular kind of sauce, and it's not heavy on veggies, and it's quite spicy...\n\nThis one was quite the opposite. Blossoming with onions and peppers and a wide variety of spices, it was far from the (albeit delicious) sledgehammer of single-purpose flavor that chili chicken usually is.\n\nThe one downside is that it nearly got all over my clothes. They packaged it in one of those boxes that doesn't seal, which is a TERRIBLE idea for any sauce-heavy food. The second someone walks down the street with it, or goes around a hard corner in their car, it gets all over. Luckily they included plenty of napkins, because they were all ruined by the time I got home.\n\nThe waitresses and waiters were super friendly and speedy, which I suppose isn't too hard at an off hour (I came by in late afternoon), but still nice to see.\n\nPrices are kinda expensive, so I don't know if I'll head down here that often - but their presence on allset is a nice bonus.", "author": "Chris S."}

So much flavor in each dish; overall I had an excellent experience and would definitely recommend this place", "author": "Simar K."}

Despite their selection though, I wasn't exactly impressed by the chaats I ordered. I felt that they were really watered down and didn't have a distinctive flavor. It was kinda this and kinda creamy and kinda spicy. As one of my friends once told me, Indian food is so strong because the right flavor combination gives one strong flavor outing.\n\nAs for their curry, it's just alright. There's no flavor that pops out at you or lingers in your mouth making you want more. It's really watery tbh and just not all that savory. Meat is stewed alright though and some Indian flavor elements are there. \n\nNaans and rotis are alright, although I thought the garlic naan was overpriced and also a bit soggy. The roti is a bit dry but with the sauce it's alright.\n\nOverall, it's a really convenient place but the flavors are underwhelming.", "author": "Michael Y."}

When you walk in, you notice that the place has a nice ambience and a lighted bar (note that they sell wine and beer, but not cocktails).\n\nI ordered the two-piece samosas (veggie), lamb tikka masala, butter naan (clearly) and a glass of the Indian white wine. The samosas came with daal along the plate, which was too gingery for my taste, but the samosas were good. The lamb tikka came out SO quickly. It was reasonably flavorful and definitely hot, although about half of the lamb chunks were severely overcooked to the point of being difficult to cut. I really enjoyed the wine and was glad to experience a while from a new region. \n\nThere weren't many people in the restaurant on this particular Monday night, so it was quiet.

My friend ordered a beer, which he never got since our server had forgotten to enter it into their system, and by the time we realized it, we decided it wasn't worth the extra wait for the beer since we were halfway done with our food.\n\nMy friend and I both weren't too hungry, so we ordered the aloo tikki chaat and a side of the tandoori chicken. I was excited about the chicken, but after one bite I was hard pressed to eat more. It was the driest chicken I've had in a long time (possibly years) and I tried to compensate by cutting it up into many small pieces and dipping it into the more sauce-y aloo tikki chaat to add some more moisture to the meat.

It was a little burnt and it was hard. Interestingly enough, the dal that appeared on the table was a black dal which wasn't even on the menu. On further inquiry they told us that apparently the chef mixed the black and the yellow dal. Weird! But to our luck the dal tasted amazing!!! We ordered one more yellow dal and that turned out to be good as well. The 3 stars are going to the dal, the frankie and the fact that the place was nice and clean. \n\nNot sure about parking, we stayed around the corner so we were able to walk here! Wouldn't make the drive for this place honestly.", "author": "Labdhi P."}

There are so many options for food and drinks..plus did I mention they had a HUGE selection of beers? Food took a while to decide, but the daily specials just made it easier. I opted for the lamb curry & the gf got the chicken tikka plate. Both plates came with rice, naan, (mine w/soup).\n\nMy lamb curry was perfectly spicy and I really enjoyed it, however.. my girlfriends chicken tikka was by far my favorite. It came on a sizzling plate w/onions. We recorded a video of the food..it just looked heavenly.

My first time ordering togo I waited an hour for the food, but they've got better since. Anyway...on the menu they've labled the things that are \"vegan\" and vegetarian, which is something I get pretty exited about! It lets me know that the restaurant atleast knows what vegan means. \n\nSince being vegan, I tend to avoid pakora because the batter they are fried in normally contains milk, so I was pleasantly suprised to see the word vegan next to at least 2 of the pakora options. I orderd one of them, and since I was sitting at the bar I was just having casual conversation with one of the workers I mentioned how I was happy there was no dairy in them. He ended up saying something like \" Yea wellll they do kinda add milk and maybe butter, is that ok? \"\nObviously I said no, and checked out the menu again. \n\nThen I asked about the somosas that have the vegan lable... same thing, \"mmm yea definitely milk in that too\". Of course I started questioning why they even put the lable if there is dairy, he said \"This is 'Indian' vegan... its different\". I tried getting him to enlighten me on the difference, but quickly gave up when it seemed like we no longer understood eachother.\n\nI settled on some potato pancakes things with this casual vegan lable, and based on how I felt after eating then, im sure there was dairy in them too.\n\nDont trust the labels! \nId say just stick to the dishes where you can see the ingredients, like the dal or aloo gobi, stear clear of anything batterd or bready in general.", "author": "Jade H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-05", "description": "It's hard to find a chaat restaurant in my neck of the woods, so we were excited to try this place out.  \n\nI used google image on my phone to look up the different chaats, b/c the way they were described on the menu were all so similar to me.  Like our friends ordered pani puri but also ordered another dish that really appeared like the same dish, but deconstructed.  Anyways, we ordered most of the chaats, but none really stood out to me.  I think the reason was the overuse of potatoes was not something that I've encountered before.  I think the bhel puri had the least potatoes, and this was the one my friend liked the most.  Our waitress recommended the papri chaat, which had a lot of potatoes, but the yogurt and tamarind chutney more than made up for that in flavor.  The sev puri was memorable b/c it resembled Indian nachos.  We also got the chole bhature, and I thought the bhature (deep fried bread) was delicious, but I've had tastier chole.\n\nThe waitstaff was very nice, but there were a couple of times during the service that things went odd.  Like my husband ordered the soda b/c he read there'd be free refills.  When it arrived, he asked if there were free refills and was told that didn't start til later.  Since he didn't want to pay $2 for a can of coke, he declined the soda.  Our waitress seemed concerned and responded, \"It is already done.\"  I didn't think that was right, since she had just handed us the can, and we had not even opened it.  So I insisted, and she called someone over who took the can away.  Later, there was a miscommunication with my friend who ordered more bread, but they had written down cholay bhathure.  Again there was a bit of awkwardness.  I think what happened is that once something is put in the computer system, it can't be removed.  The restaurant made it right for us, but I think a better software system would be helpful.\n\nIf you never have had chaat, come here for the experience.  They have one of the widest selections I've seen and in addition, they have all the other usual menu items covered.  They even had lamb and goat and if I recall correctly, fish curries.  This is quite impressive.  If you're new to Indian food, I think the variety here would be a delicious (and still reasonably priced) introduction.", "author": "Lan N."}

The Indian wine, on the other hand, was surprisingly good and definitely could hold its own against the heavy spices.

I started with roasted Papadum-- perfect, hot, and delicious. Then, the \"Cauliflower stuffed Paratha\"-- it contained only a few CRUMBS of cauliflower. They said \"all our paratha's are like that\". I sent it back, and replaced it with \"Fish Pakora\". The fish was mostly skin and bones, very little meat. And it was inedibly salty, completely salty, tasted coated in salt. I nibbled what little fish-meat i could find, and left a plate full of half-chewed skin and bones. Then tried the \"Strawberry Lassi\". Delicious. Finally, ordered another roasted Papadum, since i enjoyed it the first time. It was NOT prepared the same way as the papadum i was served 20 minutes earlier-- it was cold and uncooked.", "author": "johny w."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-05", "description": "Nice place. Clean good service. Good menu. Only got 3 stars because my dishes were RIDICULOUSLY salty. I don't know if they use MSG or some kind of flavor enhancer or if it's just plain salt but they went WAY overboard. If they cut the sodium by HALF the dishes would probably be perfect. Not sure I'll go back again, which is a bummer because it's a nice place with a good, extensive menu.", "author": "Frank R."}

I've had a little exposure to Indian food in Vancouver BC but it was nothing like this. The only word I can use is delicious!!!!!!not to much spice not bland, just right if your looking for a real treat this is the place. We had the chicken tikka masala that the staff recommended it was  incredibly good. The place was immaculate and the staff very helpful and engaging.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-26", "description": "If I could give 0 stars I would , I normally don't write reviews but had to write this one . The worst restaurant I have ever been to . Food was horrible , service was horrible, everything was wrong , they just couldn't handle the crowd. In fact the servers themselves were laughing , when we ordered saying we can put in the order but not sure when you will get it !!!!! We had ordered dahi Batata puri, there was no dahi in it , pav bhaji was so spicy(as it was as if made out of chili powder), paneer kebabs were supposed to be served on hot plate but came out cold & uncooked. When we come as a group we expect food to be served together , it took us more than 2 hours with all of us getting our foods at their own pace . Worst of it was no water was served we had to ask couple of times before they bought it. It was not only us , this was the plight on all the tables around us. What is on the menu & what shows up is completely different . Not going back there again !!!", "author": "Kavitha I."}
