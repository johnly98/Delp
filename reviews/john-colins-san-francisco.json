It is in a good location as far as working in the FiDi/SoMa gray area. \n\nThey have a good selection of beer and definitely have a fun menu of their standard cocktails and seasonal cocktails. I almost always get the paloma because they put a twist on it and make it a little spicy. Their happy hour menu is pretty legit as well, you can get a decent cocktail for like $5. Also, this is a good spot for your co-workers that are always hungry after work since they have a sushi bar in house. The sushi place is open for lunch as well, just a note. \n\nThe bar has a beachy theme and I feel like they are always playing videos of surfing or waves when I am there. Overall, a pretty good happy hour place. It can get super busy though after work hours and then sometimes will take a little bit to get a drink.", "author": "Stephanie A."}

It gives you the option of what kind of environment you want to be in. \n\nTheir drinks are consistently tasty and to my surprise so was their sushi! Ordered sushi for the first time there and I was delightfully surprised by the presentation and flavor. However, they provide the worst chopsticks I have ever used! \n\nThe bar is well staffed so drinks orders are taken and served relatively quickly. \n\nThe music can be too loud at times.

Quite spacious, but I can envision it being filled up on a busier weeknight or on the weekends. We came on a weds night and it was pretty empty, which I was totally fine with. The happy hour drinks weren't that much cheaper than a normal drink, but the drink selection was pretty good. \n\nService-wise, it wasn't apparent there was service. We walked in and we wandered around the bar's lounge and didn't realize that the sushi location was actually upstairs. Reaching the sushi location, we were even more surprised at the mannerism where we were looked at disdainfully. Not sure why, but it definitely didn't feel welcoming. We then sat at the bar and the service was as one would expect from sitting at a bar seat. Although, it was definitely apparent the bartenders did provide different service depending on who you are or how you look. Being two young adults, we received less service than those of an older crowd.\n\nOverall, for a bar situation, it was pretty average and nothing that praiseworthy. I did like what I ordered, but I can probably get it elsewhere too with a different scenario or situation.", "author": "Alex W."}

Small dance floor, spacious bar but not too big you lose your friends, and great music.\n\nI normally never go into the Financial District to bar hop, but came here for a friend's birthday. I really liked the drinks menu and loved that the bar was long, with lots of room for people to order. There weren't a lot of people on the dance floor, which was kind of nice, but it also just seemed empty. It became more popping around 11 pm.  \n\nNote: I hadn't eaten since 1 pm and arrived at John Colins at 9:30 pm. At that point, I was starving. I bet my stomach was starting to eat itself, which I think is a myth I read online but still. I remember asking the bartender if they sold food, which he said they didn't. But he said wait here, which I did and he brought out a plate of chex mix. Like what!! My mind was blown. Such a nice bartender guy. Here I was, tipsy and begging for food at the bar and instead of being annoyed, he saved my life. And then when my friend and I came stumbling back to the bar, without uttering one word, he started pouring us water. Even put a little flower and cucumber in there to jazz up the water. I was like..\"how did you know?\" And he said \"I've worked here for more than 10 years..I know when people need water.\" I was like :OOO\n\nBartender, you da real MVP.

Just loud enough, just enough character, kind of a Tommy Bahama thing happening just a little bit,  but not kitschy. The drinks were perfectly prepared - with a quickness - and not overly expensive. The crowd was post-work, congenial, and handsome. \n\nSo, in SF, that means you get to stay in business (hopefully). But in OKC, we still don't have anything exactly like this.

I liked the ambiance, with lots of people standing up and chatting away, and the fact you can open a tab (or at least our group seemed to be allowed to do so). I did not, however, like my Cosmopolitan, which was probably one of the worst I have had (and I have had way too many for this lifetime) so I would say skip that one! \n\nThe next drink, however, was pretty good but I am very sad to inform I cannot remember its name - but I do know it was named after an Asian country/region. It was very fruity and well-executed, so I guess going with the house's cocktails is a better choice than just picking a classic. Prices seemed on the high end for me, but it appears that's just the San Francisco standard for cocktail bars.\n\nOverall, a good choice for a casual but stylish post-work drink.", "author": "Gabriele J."}

I cannot believe this place. \nWe came here to eat (tonight - random Monday - EMPTY) and were put at a bench I thought was for us while we waited, given that it was a singular half-foot wide bench (the bench was our table - not our seating). We order at 7:50 PM and - I kid you not - get our food at 9:10 PM. Mind you, we (the entire THREE people in our whole group) ordered a singular roll each - that's it. \nSo almost an hour and a half later, they bring out the 3 rolls on one plate, which would have normally been fine except we didn't want to reach over the middle person since we were all seated in a line. So they take it back and spend another 10 minutes putting the 3 rolls on separate plates and then we finally eat. This whole time no one comes over to apologize - our server came over once to let us know it would be \"a little while longer\" 20 minutes in but that was incredibly inaccurate.\nAbout the food: it was very mediocre. We wolfed down our rolls in under 3 minutes because we'd been waiting for so long by that point. The best one was my friend's Tuna Poke roll where they put tuna poke on top of the roll pieces (instead of it being inside the roll). I liked my Midori roll fine but it wasn't anything special.\nLook, I've been a waitress and a hostess and worked in the restaurant industry for multiple years. But even when it wasn't my fault that the food was taking a while, I - at the very least - always apologized profusely and tried to make it up to the customers with a free appetizer or something of the like. We had none of that verbally or food-wise. I can't believe a place like this exists in SF let alone the FINANCIAL DISTRICT. Never coming here again.", "author": "Mio W."}

So I come up to see if I flag down someone else and I'm noticing she's helping every new person that walks up (right next me) and won't even look at us. It was incredibly odd because we hadn't spoken with her to upset her, nor were we drunk. We were quietly waiting to tell her we wanted to close out and she just wouldn't turn her head. So, I got the bar-backs attn and he was kind enough to help me. He went to tell her and she seemed upset. Maybe she thought we were another couple that gave her trouble before?

I still like John Collins and what it stands for; a bar scene not trying to be a bar scene, where anybody can come as they are and just be. \n\nWe went on a Friday night past 11p, and it wasn't at all crowded, although there was enough people in there to make it interesting. The patrons were as random as the music being spun. Although mixed, it was more of a \"hip hop crowd\" and I use that term very generically.\n\nThe kind of night you have here really depends on whose spinning. \nThe DJ was mashing up music without mixing it. He would play a more current E-40 song then immediately put on Bell Biv Devoe. Thank goodness the crowd was in a good mood already coz folks didn't really know what to do on the dance floor. One minute they were getting hyphy, the next the were running man. LOL. Come one DJ, you can only confuse the party for like 1 song coz after doing that for 6 songs in a row, the floor cleared out and the only ones left dancing were the really drunk and the really freaky.

If you come in at that time & expect to judge the place fair warning you'll probably just leave,but  by 1130 it's pretty packed. \n\nA couple of Tips:\n\nNo Cover  ++\n3 (1 person) restrooms - All unisex\nLocated on Minna St (which is an alley between Howard & Mission) It's easy to miss.\nPark in the structure on Mission (between 4th & 5th) = $1.50 6pm - midnight & $2 midnight - 6am\nVenue space is small\n\n\nTop 4 topics I'll be honest about:\n* Drinks & service ++\n* Venue Space  +\n* Music - +\n* Parking -+\n\nDrinks & service:\nDidn't wait long for drinks but trying to squeeze in between bar stools to get our drinks is a bit of nuisance.  There is a little window the left of the bar that you can order drinks from so I'd suggest to hit that up instead of going directly to the bar itself (Duh!! Wish I had seen that before hand).\n\n1 person = 2 Shots, 2 cocktails = $30 + tip is a not too bad in my books, especially in the city!! Both Bartenders was nice, no complaints there.\n\nVenue Space:\n Be aware this place is about as wide as the alley street you walk along to get to the place. That's small in my books. I'm talking about decent capacity would be about 100. Standing room only unless you get bottle service, which only allows 2 areas to be in, and it's pretty much the only seating space you'll find. \nImmediately on the right as you walk in you'll find a small dance space, Eh that's fine. We ended up dancing anywhere within the bar anyways cuz it was just small. A fight broke up that night & they actually had to stop the music for a while just to clear out. BOO!! Don't spoil the night for everyone else. If this place had to shut the music off for a party foul & you started that ...BOOOOOO to you!!! If this place were bigger I don't think we would have noticed it, but....\n\nMusic: \n\nIn addition to that the music was all over the place. I'm talking about 20min intervals from one genre to the next. A few songs in sequence were Reggae, then switched up R&B, then switched up again to 90s, then switched up again  \n\nParking:  This is the city so as far as parking goes...it's a hit or miss. Plan to either park on 5th & Mission. It's less than $10 to park for 4 hours & only a 2 block walk (cut through Yerba Buena Gardens & the Metreon) otherwise take the Bart in. \n\nOverall a decent place & depending on your groups vibe this isn't too bad.

John Colins is good for either Happy Hour or Night time and that is rare to find in a bar. The major upside of John Colins is that they have DJ's that play Hip Hop! That's a huge plus because it always draws huge crowds plus it's free all night! I don't know how they do it but it has worked well for them over the past couple of years. \n\nDepending on the time you go the crowd can either be the work crowd of college students. The prices are reasonable and you don't have to wait a long time to get a drink since they always have enough bartenders manning the bar. The place doesn't get too rowdy but it does get too packed sometimes especially the dance floor. The people are diverse and there is hardly any incidents that happen. The sound system is great and they have space to sit or dance plus an upstairs.

I told him that I could never figure out why John Colins was so popular, nor how it was different from any other bar. Here is what I got out of him:\n\n-  There is dancing later on in the night so it doubles as a bit of a club.\n-  The bar is generally open to the public and people don't have trouble getting in, unlike 111 Minna down the street, which was hosting two private parties at once.\n(I've seen John Colins' dance floor taken over by a private party several times. BUT everything was still open to the public.)\n-  There's a very mixed crowd, and not dominated by suits. I'm not sure whether this still stands during the popular happy hour, though.\n-  The owners make a mean Sweet Leilani (sp?), named after the ex-wife of one of the owners. It's nigori sake, Calpico (an Asian yogurt drink), x, y, z, & mint. Very refreshing; can't taste the sake but it's there.\n\nWhat I've learned on my own: \n-  The service is great (no rude bartenders or bouncers here!)\n-  There's a small, hidden VIP room where an insider might stash her stuff\n-  WARNING: Be careful of leaving your drink on the bar. It's curved and drinks are ALWAYS falling off!\n-  There are little bowls of goldfish and crackers on top of the bar. Just ask the bartender if they are untouched and then take one.\n-  It's a great place to meet people. Something about the casual atmosphere. Guys will walk right up to you and start a conversation.\n-  The bouncer doesn't like men who pat his back-buddy buddy-schmooze schmooze. There's no need for that here anyway. Unlike Ruby, but similar to Slide, the line stays relatively short and there's no cover.\n-  The bouncer DOES like cigars.\n-  The owners are John and Colin...in case you haven't already figured that out. ;)\n\nUPDATE: A friend said I failed to note that I met her here, so let me just say that this is ALSO a great place for meeting fellow awesome gals who also just happen to be out bar hopping by themselves.", "author": "Fawn B."}

This place is killing the level of confidence that my friends have in me, and I am pretty sure I am no longer allowed to decide which bar we go to on a Saturday night because the last two times I have insisted on going to J.C. it happens to be on crazy 80's nights and while this is okay for a song or two...its pretty wack. \n\nI swear, the first time I went here it was nice. The typical shitty top 40 hip hop/radio hits and regular people dancing.

It was hard to maneuver around the bars and the bathroom is extremely limited.  There is a dance floor but it is fairly small.  DJ did play good music though.  Reception is killed inside so don't expect any of your booty calls to go through, especially if you are on AT&T.\n\nEven so, I love this place for the whole feel of the place.  The bartenders here are nice and will listen to any special request.  Prices for the drinks are good, lower than your average club prices.  Good mix of people.

Maybe it has changed since they last visted or maybe the weekday nights are better than a Saturday?  Meh, who knows.  But who would have thought a bar existed in this section of the Minna alley?  No cover if you come early enough.  This isn't a hipster SF bar but luckily the crowd is largely young.  A friend that invited us was having high school reunion/b-day celebration with some old friends.  The bar has a big with a mirror that practically extends the length of it, allowing you to see the face of anyone who is sitting at the bar... convenient.  \n\nThe bartenders are nice and I didn't drink too much that night so I can't attest to the quality of how the drinks are made.  I wonder how they react to someone who asks for a Tom Collins. The music seemed to be a mix of 90s hip hop and random popular 80s music, I suppose that was nice for a change.  There are people dancing, and the dance floor itself is limited to one small front section of the joint.  The restrooms can get busy and I remember there being at least two separate single bathrooms; big enough and pretty clean.\n\nThe bar and lounge combined take up more space, which is kind of a downside.  They started to play a mix of mostly old and some new hip hop stuff later on...not so used to that. Don't know that I'd be back, but I'm kind of curious how this place gets on a late Friday night.

The manager explained what happened, was apologetic, and gave my friend (the birthday boy) a $100 voucher for drinks on another night.  Yup, you heard me right, a $100 drink voucher to use another night.  So we all gathered and went over to 111 Minna.\n\nSo although I have not been to this place, yet ...

They have a $20 credit card minimum to buy drinks. Bullshit, get out of the dark ages. The DJ was trying to play his ghetto ass gangsta rap to please his boys from the hood but seriously, nobody was even dancing when he played those ignorant ass songs. So a little advice to the bar, get a DJ who plays music people actually want to dance to so it will prompt them to buy more drinks at the bar which therefore increases your revenue by the end of the night. Funny how simple economics work. Overall it's a decent place to party. I like to switch it up from the usual parlor, grand and sloane. This is a good alternative with a nice vibe. Just get the DJ in check and get your credit card debacle sorted out and we got a poppin place.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

The new location is waaaay bigger than the old one with far more seating, but it still has that same great liquor selection.  I seem to recall the bartenders making better drinks than I've recently had at this location, but that might be because my standards are now higher.\n\nTheir website says, \"Dress code strictly enforced. No baggy jeans, long t-shirts or sports gear allowed.\"  This is likely due to the fact that this spot is for some inexplicable reason a huge douchebag magnet. Maybe this is because John Colins subscribes to what I personally believe to be the ridiculous policy of having to pay to reserve a table since it includes bottle service. What If I don't want bottle service? What if I want to drink what I like to drink and my friends and I would have spent far more than your table reservation fee but now you'll never know?

Awesome that there's no cover and virtually no dress code. No line as well, so we step right in. Once inside, it's packed. I find my group of friends and proceed to people watch, and grab drinks at the bar. Chill ambiance, decent vibe. The bartenders are nice enough, serving the masses as quickly and as efficiently as they can. \n\nAfter being there for over 30 minutes, my friends and I notice the space is muggy. (I fear the extra moisture will make my hair begin to frizz!) To escape the mugginess, a friend and I decide to walk around to do more people watching.  After snaking through the crowd, we find there is practically no one dancing on the \"dance floor.\" Perhaps it was the poor music selection. No 80's, 90's, not even top 40's or classic renditions of anything danceable. With the exception of an MJ song, the music was a bust! \n\n45 minutes now pass and the crowd seems to be thinning. Perhaps the masses evenly dispersed themselves throughout the venue, or JC was simply a \"first stop of the night\" type of venue. In any case, almost midnight and around 7 of the guys in our group have yet to join us inside. The bouncer wouldn't let them in because \"there were too many guys inside.\" Not even the pleading birthday girl's story broke the bouncer (her bf was one of the guys outside). It's one thing to say that they aren't letting ANYONE in because it's too crowded, but another to single out the guys specifically.  If this were Vegas, this would be understandable, but John Collins is a tiny bar lounge that in my opinion has no real cache (yet anyway) to shun guys like that. \n\nSo, we leave...all 25 or so of us. \n\nJohn Collins I wanted to like you...especially since I enjoyed the old location for happy hour.

Or maybe it was the fact I paid money to be around crazies.  I don't know - maybe I have bad judgement sometimes when I want to have fun. All I know is that this place was the last place even the devil would visit on a romp around town.\n\nBesides the emptiness of the place and random people dancing by themselves in a corner (when no one was dancing and not really any music was playing) we had to endure (we only stayed for 25 minutes) poor bar service.  The bartenders refused to listen to my friends and I when we ordered our drinks.  RUM and coke - how hard is that?  Captain and coke - nope, not much harder.  What did we get?  WHISKEY and coke.  After explaining to him that this was not RUM, he apologized and immediately made us a new drink - another WHISKEY and coke.  Again, after we explained this to him and his friend, Muscles McGhee - the other bartender, they rolled their eyes and proceeded to make our drinks- WHISKEY again; we shouted, \"NO, NOT WHISKEY-RUM!!\" Those magical light bulbs finally went off in the heads and they smiled, apologized and proceeded to try and make a rum and coke.  However, they realized that they were out of rum.  How in the world does a bar run out of rum at 9:30 pm on a Friday night??? \n\nI mean, I know that maybe they didn't restock from Thursday, but really?  Also, HOW did they not hear us asking for rum the first 2 TIMES??  It wasn't even crowded.  They had some top shelf rum that they found after searching for a while that was only half a bottle so they made it for us.  It was more coke than rum, but whatever.  Since it seemed to be an off-night and they were more concerned with talking to each other, that's cool. You can't expect everyone to do their job well. . . . \n\nAnyway, maybe we will try \"hitting the town again\" when I am back in SFO, but I'm going to try a different bar that won't take my money at the door and then promptly slap me across the face like an insolent child.\n\nWorst bar.

And girls, you don't have to worry about slimy d-bags trying to approach you b/c most of the guys that come here work in the nearby FIDI area and are cordial. \n*AWESOME MUSIC: Ahhh! Love, love the music here!!!! A mix of Hip Hop, Tops 40s, and Old School Hip Hop, and 90's Remixes. The last time I went on a Friday night, DJ Dan was off the hook. He started the night playing some 90's throwback with MJ and then started going into the Top 40s: \"Meet Me Halfway\", \"Sexy Chick\", \"Do You Remember\", \"Bad Romance\", \"Replay\", \"Run This Town\", etc! He took requests and kept us dancing until closing! \n\nCons:\n*Once HH starts at 5-6, it gets PACKED.

Me, being from the SBay, just differed to the city folks to decide where we end up for the night. We found ourselves at John Collins. No cover was nice and the overall ambiance was well put together and very SF with the brick walls and decor. \n\nWhen we arrived we ordered our first set of drinks of hen & coke and vod/ton's and sadly we were served some pretty weak drinks. After we switched bartenders the drinks appeared to be more \"generously\" poured, so perhaps it was just a poor pick of bartender first time around. \n\nWhat I noticed throughout the night was that the crowds came and went like the tide of the sea. Not sure if that's normally the case, but at times I found the bar area rather thin in attendance, which I wasn't used to, especially when trying to eye the crowd for anyone interesting to talk to. \n\nLast negative part. The DJ. At random parts of the evening, the music would just entirely shut off and would stumble back into a beat. Not sure if the particular night I went, they had a newb DJ, but it surely didn't help with trying to dance around.\n\nI would say, if you're going for a happy hour hangout, this would be a sweet bar, but if you're lookin to go out dancing and grab a few drinks at night, this place would just be a stop through, not the end destination.", "author": "Chris D."}

The crowd is generally comprised of the after-work crowd, but I haven't observed any \"see and be seen\" type of attitudes that one gets at some other after-work spots - it's mostly people kicking back with a drink or two before heading home.\n\nI know that the bar is moving it's location at the end of the month and I hope it doesn't lose it's charm in the move.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-04", "description": "Probably one of the better spots in San Francisco. I like John Colins because you just never know what to expect in there. But that's a part of the fun. I've seen many clubs and bars that attract a certain crowd. John Colins doesn't have a type. Every person from the grad student to the hip hop heads to the older mid-life crisis douchebag comes here. The females range between conservative 30 something females who gather once a month to the hot girls who dress in the tiny skirts and stilettos, and even extremely casually dressed girls who just want to dance. Even the ethnic backgrounds are quite the mix. \n\nThe DJs are somewhat random. Some nights you'll have a ton of House music and other nights there will be a mix of Hip Hop, Top 40 and even a bit of Reggae thrown in here and there. \n\nBefore you get into the club, the laid back guy with the ponytail is usually checking IDs and letting people. He always seems pretty cool and seems to enjoy his job. Always makes it a more easygoing experience getting into any place. As you look forward to your left before getting in you'll also notice a Korean Taco truck. So if you're sorta hungry, you can grab a small bite for about 2 bucks a taco. It's actually pretty tasty. Plus you can get a cheaper soda than what the bar charges.\n\nOnce you get in, the dance floor is to your immediate right and some seating to your immediate left. The bar goes from one end to the other and it doesn't curve around to any other sides. The bar is almost always full and you have to kinda push your way in and say \"Excuse me\" because sometimes it seems as if people are determined to stand or sit at the bar area for the entire evening. The drinks are not real stiff, but they're decent. Once you get to the bar area, and you turn around to look up, there's always some movie playing above your head. The films they decide to choose are random as well.\n\nThere is no cover to get in, which I love. There's been times where I dropped in early, then I left, and came back again without a problem. The crowd is super laid back and pretty friendly. The mix of people always make it somewhat interesting. The dance floor is small, so get on it early if you want to make a spot for you and your friends. \n\nThe place never gets super exciting, so if you're looking for an extremely upbeat vibe, look elsewhere. If you're looking to have a few drinks and to dance a bit, this might be a nice little fit for your taste.\n\nOh, 20 dollar minimum on cards. I would just open a tab and buy a few, then close it out. The drinks are not cheap, so that 20 dollars can get used up within a single round with enough people. Otherwise cash is your only option.", "author": "Prince B."}

I have my new LA girl in town so we had to show her around and since JC is so close to work, why not.\n\nUpon entering, I thought we had accidentally entered Anchor and Hope. Very similar design with the high ceiling and the exposed brick, but I guess when you share the same building, tis bound to happen. After saddling up to the bar, we started ordering drinks. I was super tired and needed a second wind so i opted for the Espresso martini. The mantender said it actually had caffeine in the vodka (sweet!!!) and whether that was true or not, the drink definitely put a kick back into my step.\n\nFrom there we proceeded to drink a few more martinis and low and behold, it was time to break the seal. Yep, a girl can only go so long without a ladies room stop ;) And so I headed to said ladies room and wouldn't you know, it was occupied. Damn! But what's this, the men's room is open, hmmmmmm.\n\nEh, falk it, why not. And so I headed in and locked the door. From there, I began my business and what happens next? Oh, ya know, the friggin door opens and there stands a man looking for his room. \n\n\"Shit, shit shit!!\" was what I exclaimed and quickly kicked the door shut. Oh my god! How embarrassing and of course he was cute. Why wouldn't he be? That is just my luck. And so I washed my hands and made sure the bright red mortified glow was still on my cheeks and exited the bathroom. He was trying to contain his laughter and when I looked at him, he looked at me and we both burst into laughter. \n\nAhhh, I love life.", "author": "Stephy S."}

As with all my bar/lounge/club reviews, I'll provide only the pertinent information:\n\nDress code: none really. Collared shirt or nice t-shirt will be fine. Chucks are fine too. No dress shoes needed.\n\nCover: there is none. HOWEVER, if you're with a bunch of dudes and the line is long, you're better off giving the bouncer a couple bucks (maybe $5 each) to waltz right in. It's probably worth it. And if you can't afford $5, you probably won't end up getting lucky anyway.\n\nDrinks: Really reasonable prices. Example - Bought 4 shots of Stoli for about $28. That should give you a decent idea. Since there's only one bar, it will take FOREVER to get a drink. Not saying the bartenders suck, but it does piss us off.\n\nCrowd: At least 50% Asian, rest is mixed. A lot of birthday crowds. Pretty good looking people most of the time. Hey, that's what's important at bars right?\n\nDance: there's a pretty decent area with a DJ for dancing. He usually plays top 40s so the girls would appreciate that.\n\nI gave this place 4 stars because it's a pretty legit \"default\" place to go.

The staff is nice and efficient.\n\nUnfortunately, the last part is where it all went wrong. I'm sure the bartenders are still great, but the bouncer managed to, single-handedly, convince me and the group I was with to look elsewhere for our entertainment and libations. Honestly, a bouncer generally has little to do with the inside venue quality, and the nature of their jobs is a tough one. As such, I'm sure I (and most reasonable human beings out there) are willing to take bouncer-treatment with a grain of salt. They have to deal with a lot of pricks, and thus the rest of us must stomach treatment of the lowest common denominator. Generally, this is a straightforward concept, and as such I'm willing to take a fair amount of shit to just get into the bar du jour.\n\nBut this guy was an over-the-top dick to all of us, for apparently no reason. We could see inside, and the place wasn't crowded; on a Saturday night, they could have used our business. I'm absolutely sure that the profits from just our group would have paid this dumb-asses salary for at least the evening. Or, better yet, a nicer dude to take his place. Either way, when the guy outside your bar is losing the establishment money for no apparent reason, you have an HR problem. Dude, just sit, check IDs, and be merry.\n\nI wish I could say I'm pissed off, but it's really more just sad. Sad that I didn't get to visit one of my favorite spots, and sad that said spot is losing money because of a bad hiring choice. And the worst: they probably don't know it.

Tiny Natoma Street may have a rundown appearance, but all this negativity ends, quite literally, at the door of John Colins, one of SOMA's finer nightlife establishments.\n\nFirst, I was truly dumbstruck by the congeniality and pleasant disposition of the bouncers.  Generally, bouncers are an odious lot, surly trolls risen from the mire, bred solely to prey upon the good spirits of San Francisco's weekend socialites.  Getting frisked and interrogated by a grim looking half-ogre is more than enough to sour a person's mood for the evening.  However, the way the John Colins bouncers joked around with each guest made me want to have a good time there.  Kudos to these fine gents.\n\nTo even enter the four- or five-star category, a club has to have no cover charge.  John Colins gets a huge helping of these \"mad props\" I keep hearing about for having no cover.\n\nInside, John Colins is small and charming.  A dark curtain hangs over the main entrance.  Large works of abstract art adorn brick walls, against which sit couches for lounging.  There's a projector that shows random movies on the wall.  Last Saturday night they were showing \"Breakin'\", truly one of the finer pieces of breakdancing cinema from the early 80s, surpassed only by its eponymous sequel, \"Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo\".  A little electric boogaloo certainly would have garnered a five-star rating, no questions asked.\n\nThe bar area is narrow and a point of some serious congestion.  Despite this, I was able to get my drinks relatively quickly, though at a serious premium.  I guess this is where they get their money back on having a coverless club, but at least I can control how much I drink in any given night (in theory, anyway).  The drinks themselves were fine.  Nothing special, nothing terrible.\n\nThe music.  Ah, the music!  A great mix of (predominantly) old and new school hip hop, with a smattering of pop-infused electronica.  Light on tannins, with a round, smooth finish reminiscent of blackberries and dark chocolate.\n\nFinally, the crowd was almost entirely Asian as it was some Asian girl's birthday party.  The only other time I've been here was for an Indian party, in which case the place was overrun by brown folk.  It's hard to comment on the clientele with such limited data, but at least everyone seemed pretty friendly on both occasions and were intent on having a good time.  And the place wasn't full to the brim with a bunch of jokers, so there was plenty of room to stand comfortably without having to feel someone's anus pressed against your thigh (I mean, I can do that at home, right?).\n\nI really enjoyed my time at John Colins.

Not being a huge fan of the club scene of SOMA, I put up a valiant, yet ultimately unsuccessful fight to get out of venturing to this unknown establishment.  As I rode the dingy 38 into town with the eclectic mix of crack heads and old Asian people, I dreaded the worst: power tripping bouncers, $30 covers, sausage fests, attractive yet bitchy ladies and an overall disappointing night as these elements have comprised the majority of my SOMA nights.  \n\nJohn Collins completely surprised me.  The bouncers were cordial and smiling, the bartender was attentive and respectful.  The majority of the clientele was approachable, laid back, well dressed, attractive (but not pretentious) and fun.  The music was loud, but not so loud that it was impossible to carry on a conversation.  The place was crowded, but not a clusterfuck.  The drinks were strong and delicious.  Bizarre movies (Scarface, weird aerobic 80's dancing movies with levitating brooms) were projected onto the area above the door which at least made for an interesting conversation piece as well as something to look at when you were stuck with no one to talk to.  To further improve my impression of JC, I believe I had the scientifically perfect combination of Jaeger and Gin and Tonics flowing through my bloodstream.\n\nJohn Colins has convinced me that there is actually a cool place to hang out in SOMA.  I will definitely come here again and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a chill place to enjoy your Saturday night.  Furthermore, I've learned that I should never write off a neighborhood of the city because of a few bad experiences and unfriendly people.", "author": "Patrick N."}

When John, Colin and Leilani opened this bar over a year ago, they were facing a challenge of making it in the area already saturated with nightlife. Many tried and failed, like Varnish across the alley. Many more are doing OK, but lost their luster in the ever changing and utterly unpredictable bar popularity ranking in San Francisco.\n\nA year later, the place is thriving. Come in at any night, and there will be people, but from Wednesday night through Saturday night, it is really happening. Which is surprising, considering that not that many people really live nearby. That means, people actually COME here on purpose. I know I do. \n\nTake Wednesdays, for instance. John Colins attracts the spillover crowd from 111 Minna, which for some inexplicable reason closes at 10 pm. That spells gold for the bar's owners, because people who want to carry on with their night out can just hope over round the corner.\n\nDrinks are inventive and reasonably priced. The bar staff is friendly. In fact, the owners Colin and Leilani put their money where their mouth is by working the bar themselves. The movies shown on the screen range from big wave surfing (apparently, the bar was started with the Hawaiian idea in mind, but who cares now) to 1940s erotic flicks (indeed). The music is generally nice and loungey. The couch seat - barstool balance is just about right. The interior decor is clearly done by a professional, from the vaulted ceiling to the giant painting of bird's eye view of San Francisco.

It's on this small street in the cut and away from the main streets of SF.  \n\nWe arrived there and there was a bit of a wait just because there was a band that went on before and they had to pack up.  Once we got in, I totally dug the space and how the bar is set up.  It was a bit packed when we got in, but it was too hard to find some space.  The music was pretty good on a Saturday night and everyone seemed to be having a good time.\n\nOne major complaint: the bartenders there are f'ing inept.  I dunno how many times they messed up on our friends' drink orders.  Especially this one chick who thinks she's an amazing bartender, when in fact, she's terrible at what she does.  She screwed up ringing up my drinks and said \"you're sooo lucky, omg, you're soo lucky.\" Honestly, she was just an idiot and doesn't know how to push buttons on a register.\n\nOther than the rookie bartenders there, this is a great bar to meet your friends and enjoy some good drinks (if the bartenders don't mess it up).", "author": "Danny S."}

It is trendy but it is not trendy, hipster but not hipster and not entirely a scene.

Michael Jackson videos playing on the LCD project, wait, no now it's Friday; no now it's an 80s breakdance movie. The bar carries an atmosphere of chic for chics sake that I tend to find distasteful. In kind the clientelle is inches away from being your standard \"collar up\"\n Marina affair; the type of person that if you're not already in you have to prove yourself alright  brah? You'll find your mix of pricks and chill people for both gender, so it's a crap shoot on what you'll come across.\n\nThe staff, however, is amazing. The bouncer is perhaps the kindest and most patient man i have  met in some time, both to the patrons and the neighbors. The bartenders are fast and attentive to the point of seeking you out if you look like you're trying to get a drink. Even when the bar is crowded, which it more than likely will be.\n\nJohn Colins teeters on the edge being a nice place to mingle and socialize or steer clear from because of the pretenious socialites.

The music was great, bartenders were attentive, and they even carried Blue Angel Vodka-- it's surprisingly hard to find a place that carries this stuff.

However the bouncer repeatedly let groups of women in-- some of them just walked to the front, some were plucked out of line. As the bouncer pulled the three women in front of me, I told my friend this was too absurd and insulting, so I was leaving. The bouncer then told me that it was \"pretty full in there.\" My friend assured me it was not, and there were fewer people in the bar than when I arrived.  But either way, if it's so full, why are you letting in all those women?\n\nBased on the people I saw and the music I heard, I would guess this is a pretty mediocre-to-douchey establishment, but since I did not get inside, I won't make assumptions.\n\nA number of other reviews here say this place has a high bro quotient, so perhaps their admission policy is meant to balance that out.

Sorry.\n\n2. The line for the men's line was extremely long, because some guy was droppin a fatty deuce. At least, that's what I told all the guys in line (half were my friends, I'm not an asshole, really). I recall it was initially intended to be a funny prank, but once the bartender came out and knocked on the door, I knew there was no going back. In addition to his notifying the Phantom Pooper about the long line, I was screaming, \"Dude, pinch it off! There's a line out to Bayview here!\"\n\nBy the way, not one person jiggled the handle to see if the door was actually locked, including myself.\n\nAnyway. It was funny at the time, but you know.

They still tease me about that.\n\nI'd go back, but there are some MAJOR improvements that should be made on weekend nights.  Some things that detracted from an otherwise great night-\n\n1. Have the people who run the place ever heard of HVAC?  I'm a few decades too young to feel like I'm having a hot flash at a bar.  The dance floor was especially reminiscent of a sauna, and let's not talk about the BO.  Minus half star.\n2. Bathrooms.  Three single-person bathrooms for the whole place produces line cutting and grouchiness.  It seems to me it would help business to have more bathrooms, as people would have more time to buy drinks!  Minus half star.\n3. The worst one of all: bouncers at closing time.  No trouble getting in, but when it's closing time they turn downright rude.  I totally understand being forceful about getting a bunch of people outside of your establishment when it's time to close shop.  But when those people are being perfectly civil on the sidewalk outside your establishment, you have no right to YELL at your patrons to \"GO HOME\".  I seriously doubt the sidewalk belongs to John Colins.  A shame, as it left a pretty good night on a sour note.

In this particular bar, I feel like people go to be seen. It is mobbed with some pushy dudes. Maybe it's like this: there are bars that are clearly filled with single people that want to get laid. Everyone is looking around to see who is looking at them. This is accompanied by annoyingly loud music. Then there are bars where no one cares who is watching. They want to get drunk with friends and be able to talk. Getting laid is a bonus, not a goal. I obviously prefer the latter. This bar looks nice on the inside, but it is not conducive to sitting around chatting with friends. There are limited places to chill, so everyone mobs the bar and you stand shoulder to shoulder fighting your way in for a drink. You can't fault a bar for the crowd that gathers there, so here are a few pros and cons:\n- Waitstaff walks around replenishing a little bowl of goldfish and pretzels. Nice touch.\n- There is a cocktail waitress, which is awesome, but we could have used two or three more.\n- No drink menus at the bar, or that the waitress could provide. It was too crowded to go to the bar and view the selection, so I couldn't order anything unique or special to that establishment. I had a gin gimlet, and the glass was about half full. My friend's glass was all the way full, so I paid the same for half the martini. Little inconsistent. \n- They have a happy hour of $1 off everything, which is A-ok.", "author": "Merrilee T."}

At first I was a bit hesitant to pick this place since I have never been to this place nor their old location.  After my first happy hour that same week, I made the decision and I didn't regret it. \n\nI talked to John (owner) and gave me their business card, got in touch with his wife, Leyla, who was in charge of reservations/events. She was friendly and accommodating and got me a good deal with their bottle service ($500/2 Grey goose bottles) and the foyer right by the entrance.  That location was the best, close to the entrance/exit, dance floor, bar, and restrooms (only 3 to be exact). If you have AT&T, reception is spotty down to a dead zone if you're really way in the back but they were willing to give their passcode for their Wifi, which gave me other means of communication thru my IPhone (facebook, textfree, textnow etc) to contact my friends (yes there is an app for that). You have to be very specific to the bouncer about guests coming after a certain time (1030pm, i think), there's gonna be a long line outside, and they won't just let you in, not unless if you know them, or if it's your event. Good thing we were just right by the entrance so I could see if my friends were outside plus with wifi, communication was not really a problem (good luck trying to send/receive calls).

It was like a mix of electronica/house/alternative- I don't even know how to describe it. The DJ was feelin it though, everyone just looked confused haha. \n\nDrinks- just like any other bar in SF. I wasn't here during happy hour, so can't vouch much for it like the other yelpers. However bartenders were nice though. They messed up on my friends order, so gave us extra shots.\n\nLine/Wait- For some reasons there were alot of guys that nights, so they ended up not letting any more guys in unless it was an equal girl to guy ratio. Haha it felt like the girl:guy ratio rule in Vegas, which I thought was kind of funny for such a small SF joint. Our group lucked out because we had an equal ratio. The group of guys in front of us had to bounce. \n\nOverall- I think this place is more for an older crowd or those who just likes to drink and chill. Then again, it seemed hard to strike a convo here since it's pretty loud. This place is more for a chill night in my opinion (nothing too crazy). Probably not the best place to hit up in SF if you're down for dancing and good music. Free cover though.", "author": "Cindy L."}

I guess that tells you I liked the place, liked it enough to spend a significant night out in the city which is highly unusual when it comes to NYE. Both nights offered a comfortable, laid back, UN-pretentious environment.\n\nThough I was with a good group of people on NYE that I could have enjoyed a night with anywhere, anytime, I felt that there was something  particularly special about this place. Wanna know? It's the staff. I'm not sure if Colin just manages the place or if he's a partner, but he is hands down one of the sweetest, most personable bartenders/managers I have ever met. He is always a pleasure to deal with, whether it's ordering a drink or a business transaction. I ESPECIALLY loved that he was only willing to sell a set amount of tickets for New Years, assuring the comfort of those choosing to spend their time there. The place was comfortable, not over packed, easy to get a drink, all with good attitudes and positive vibes! Thanks Colin.\n\nI will definitely be back as I have friends who have a DJ residency there on Wednesday nights.

The boot-shaped shot glasses are a very quirky and nice touch.\n\nThe later the night gets, the cheesier the crowd gets. I guess that can be pretty typical of any bar you go to in San Francisco. But both of my times here, I found more of the \"local-city-type-after-work-crowd\" then a \"Bridge and Tunnel\" flavor. No party busses in sight here. I dug it.\n\nYou have to know where you are going when you come to this place. It's slightly off the downtown beaten path.", "author": "Kathleen N."}

It's almost tragic this place is so small, given the cool DJ who was also playing great music I was sure there would've been some major dancing going on.  Beers (at least the Trumer Pils and Pyramid Hef) came in at a Mission-esque $4 which is a welcome change to drinking in this area.  The bartenders were actually really cool as well.  After ordering one drink, the bartender remembered my exact order and asked if I'd like the same the next time I came up.\n\nThere wasn't much bad about which to write, but for some reason this place didn't strike a chord with me.  One thing that absolutely killed me was the bathroom situation.  I know it's probably considered \"classy\" to have a bathroom that is just one room with one toilet, but for high volume (male) crowds, two urinals and a crapper works much better.  This way when the guys who have to do some lines (you know what I mean) or take awhile messing with their hair are busy, the rest of us can enjoy getting in, urinating and getting out.  Also the guy/girl who came out of the bathroom with mussed clothes was pretty raunchy, don't you guys have apartments?  \n\nI could also stand to see a better variety of draft beer as well (where can't I get guinness in San Francisco?).  \n\nOverall it was a great night, but I don't know that JC offered too much to make me come back for that I couldn't have experienced/drank somewhere else.  Maybe if Yelp actually sponsors this place, I'll come be a groupie.", "author": "Steven R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-19", "description": "Overall I really like this place.  The DJs are always on point playing great hip hip circa late 80s early 90s.  They also have a projector screen showing and every now and then they'll play this 80's dance show similar to soul train featuring a Run DMC performance.\n\nMy two main gripes about this place are:\n\nEvery time I go here the DJ always drops hip hop classics, but the crowd here doesn't seem to care.  Considering most places out there play crappy hip hop, I'd wish the crowd would be more in tune to the music or that people came here cuz the music was dope.  If you don't really care much for the music than this won't bother you as much as it bothers me.  Next time they play \"Drop\" by the Pharcyde, I'd like it if more than just me started bobbing their head to the beat.\n\nWe ran into one bartender than was a jackass.  So when you're vying for the attention of the bartender on a crowded weekend, you don't expect to hear \"what the fuck do you want?\" from a bartender.  Let's see Mr. Bartender.  I'm at a Bar.  It's Friday night.  I'm trying to get your attention since you are behind the counter and taking drinks..I actually just wanted to say how nice your hair looks today!  Anyways,  after I got over my initial shock at this comment, I proceeded to order my drinks and promptly didn't leave the guy tip.

It's got a cool feel to it with it entrance on a small side street just off a second (almost speakeasy but not quite).  Music was good and drinks were strong.  I'd be giving it 2.5 stars if i had the option though.\n\nDrink complaints:\nLike most crowded bars, it took forever to get the bartender's attention, but once i did, the guy that served me and my party was really nice and responsive.  My only complaint was that one of their specials, the lychee soju martini pretty much tasted like sweaty feet.    But I'm pretty sure it wasn't the bartender's fault, just crappy alcohol.  After that I stuck with the Red Bull vodkas which were prepared quite nicely!\n\nBathroom complaints:\nApparently the Men's room was \"temporarily out of service\" that night so everyone had to wait to use the one ladies restroom.  When it came near my turn, I decided to just see what all the fuss was about with the guy's toilet and found that the door wasn't locked so i just went ahead and used the perfectly good, perfectly clean toilet.  After I broke through, the rest of the line caught on and started to do the same thing.  I later asked the bartender about it and he confessed that the leave the sign up so the staff can use the restroom if they were in a hurry.  SCAM!!!!

I've gotten really bad at this picking places thing. You have any ideas?\nScott: How about John Colins? Some people at work recommend it. (Mind you, everyone I work with is under the age of 25.)\nMe: Sure. Might be good for some laughs. \n\nSo, of course, after this is decided I proceed directly to Yelp and Yelp the shit out of John Colins and am confronted with information both alarming and comforting. Crowded (alarming), good happy hour (comforting), frat boys (alarming), cool space (comforting), lots of bad cologne (alarming). Anyway, the decision was made and I really do need to try to go out to new and different places every now and then. \n\nI sent Scott one last email reminding him to splash on the the Drakkar Renoir and headed down to Natoma. \n\nI was greeted by a wall of people and loud sounds and unless those sounds are some seriously rockin' rock and roll, this combination makes me grumpy. But I soldiered my way to the bar with thin hopes for decent gin. \n\nOh! Lucky day! They have Hendricks AND No. 209. Furthermore, the bartender who prepared my yummy martini for me was friendly, efficient and made a killer cocktail. The entire bar staff were not only clearly good at their jobs, but they also seemed to enjoy working there, which, take it from me, is the key ingredient in a good bartender. Everyone behind the bar had great energy and a little flare, but nothing flashy. Once I had staked my claim at the stooless bar, I had a chance to examine the room. \n\nA wide skylight filled the room with evening light, comfy-looking setups of cocktail tables, banquets and footstools comprised the seating in the narrow bar. The brick walls were hung with decent art, predominantly featuring American Bulldogs (I think) in a variety of poses and sizes. The crowd was hit and miss. I heard a lot about shoes and purses and guys from the ladies bumping into me on the right and the Warriors game was on, so the masculinity was at an expected high. The crowd was a little young, but everyone was definitely out of college and solidly in the workforce, which is encouraging. \n\nScott and his lady met me shortly. The excellent bar service persevered despite the hefty number of people jammed into the bar (the sign on the wall said maximum capacity 49. Whatever.) and when Mary traded in an experimental cocktail that was too bitter, the bartender was void of attitude and graciously replaced the offending libation. \n\nI will certainly go back to John Colins. Hell, I had a good enough time to bust open the iron-clad martini rule and have three instead of two. But when I do go back, it'll be on a Tuesday night. It would be a fabulous place to meet a couple of friends for a weekday nightcap--but I think I'll skip the happy hour.", "author": "Sage R."}

It's a beautiful bar, well decorated, with various \"sections\" and could have a great vibe.  However it's WAY too loud and the bar service was terrible.  I waited well over 20 minutes to get a drink.  I wish they would make up their mind and either be a dance club (as that's what they are trying to go for with their crazy loud music with speakers 5 feet from your ears), or the happy hour lounge, which is the design, but so not conducive to any conversation.  I would give it another chance on a non Friday night happy hour, but the rude bar tenders put me off completely.", "author": "Nolwenn S."}

The dance floor area is small, and despite a little technical difficulty, the DJ played some good music. I do agree that it would be nice to not have the music blasting all around the place, or at least lower the volume a bit around the bar area so we can hear ourselves talk.

Hubby and I were able to sit at the bar and talk to John for an an hour or so.  Drinks were spot on and watching a surfing video was fun.

So we said \" hello\" and handed him our ID's. He looked at all three of us and said, \" Um ladies, can you please move over here and come around the rope.\" I was confused because we were the only people in line and the rope was only 2 x 2 ft in length. Not even casual smokers or any type of other life was in the alley at this time so I didn't get it. I took one step forward, and then three steps to the side and then he said, \"welcome can I please see your ID's? It was weird?  I don't know if he was trying to be funny or he was bi-polar or perhaps he had short term memory or maybe he has whatever syndrome Munk has because I don't believe that one normal person would ask us to move four steps.  Awkward greeting put aside John Colin's is a good time. I like what the owners have done with the spot and enjoy the vibe and decor ( especially, the art work ) . Plus, the drinks in my opinion are well served and they always have a movie playing that takes me back as Breakin I did this past weekend. It's definitely a great spot to start your evening off  . . .", "author": "Jazzelyn F."}

The exposed brick, interesting art and dimly lit atmosphere makes this our favorite happy hour spot. We love the movies projected on the wall which tends to defer our attention from the conversations we are supposed to be engaged in. The bartenders are laid back and make great drinks. We love that you don't have to pay $12 for a small and clever martini. Drinks are reasonable and they make some interesting concoctions. It attracts the after work crowd and can often get PACKED on a Thursday night. We highly recommend this social watering hole for a Happy Hour gathering.

As a people watching spot it is FABULOUS - bringing in the after work crowd, SOMA hipsters and even some artists (you know what I mean, people wearing hats - in a good way).  The drinks were strong.

They have a casual cool dress code, DJ's and the Bartenders that seem to make the mixed drinks just right.  If you live in the South Beach, SOMA, of near the financial district this is the local spot for you.  Especially on the weekends when it is difficult to catch a cab, John Colins is within walking distance.  I had a friend in town for the Giants game and didn't think we were going out and of course with change of plans didn't have anything to wear. Thank God I knew that they didn't enforce a dress code. On the weekends it can be a bit too crowded  and the music is way to loud that I couldn't really carry on a conversation.  I would understand if it were a dance club but its not- its a Lounge.  A small lounge which is why I didn't understand the \"Reserved table.\"  My group seemed to luck out and found the last available table.", "author": "Catherine M."}
