But you can't get extra sandwiches, so if we want to feed everyone in our office we either have to do 2 platters or do separate boxed lunches. I understand their catering kitchen has things they can and cannot do, but this just seems ridiculous. Why can't we order a platter and a couple extra sandwiches? We will of course pay for them at their regular price, that's not the issue.\nAlso, they are quite disorganized when you phone to place a catering order, even though their website says they will only accept catering orders before noon.\nUnfortunately, we will not be attempting to order catering from Pazzo's again.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Well, the message is loud and clear Pazzo, I wont BOTHER giving you any more of my money.\n\nToday, ordering 2 salads was a nearly an impossible task. I called for 30 minutes straight, reaching an automated message with no voicemail. The phone was clearly off the hook. (I have personally seen them take the phone off the hook many times.)\nApparently they are still accepting FAX (seriously, who has a fax machine anymore?!!!!) for which they require 45 minutes to prepare. This is not industry standard.\n\nSo, I persistently drive over. As the only customer in the cafe I wait  for several minutes while multiple waiters chatted behind the counter, no one giving me a second glance. Their chatter sounded unimportant. When I finally interrupted and requested service I was told they were not ready for customers (although they had been technically open for some time...) and I was told to wait again.\n\nFinally, I placed the order and waited for my number to be called. The salads sat on the counter and no one bothered to let me know. Lastly, once I got back to work I discovered they screwed up my order. \n\nDear Pazzo, this is unacceptable.

They also have sandwich and soup specials that actually DO change , unlike some places that have the same special for the entire life of their operation. The regular menu offers plenty of salads, sandwiches, etc to choose from. They even give you the option of making a sandwich into a salad. \n\nThe line does get pretty long, but it moves relatively fast--esp if you show up just before or a little bit after the busy 12:30 lunch time. I think some of the portion sizes vary depending on what you get. Once I got a tuna sandwich that was huge while my companion got a hot sandwich that was barely enough to fill her up. \n\nI never have problems with seating when I'm there. It's less obvious, but they do have seating upstairs. Just watch out for that LOW ceiling if you're over 6 feet tall.

I work nearby, so I like to order online (which is a very easy site to navigate, in my opinion and often do the same for Dos Pinas as well), and then pick-up later. \nShortly after I stopped eating wheat & gluten a few months ago, I emailed a contact at Mission Bay Foods to ask about the gluten-free options, to which I received a response that the following week they would begin carrying a gluten-free (GF) bread. Hooray. Later that next week, I placed my first order, being careful to mention in the comments to substitute the GF bread, as well as leave off a number of condiments that I dislike (including the salad dressing from the side-salad). I picked up my order later (it was the roast pork sandwich), and brought it back to work to eat - there was salad dressing in a little container, but other items were left off of the sandwich, so I assumed the GF bread instruction was followed. It was delicious. Later that day, I wasn't feeling so great, but figured maybe I just ate too much.\nA week or so after, I ordered another sandwich (ham & cheese this time) in the same manner. When I picked it up, I was handed a container with salad, topped by the sandwich ingredients, plus a small bag with two pieces of what felt like stale bread (actually toasted. sort of.) Noticing my confused expression, the cashier somewhat embarrassingly, explained that the gluten-free bread is too small to build a proper sandwich on, so they serve the sandwich \"naked\" on the salad with the bread as a side. ...so the bread I had the week before was, in fact, regular wheat bread. Thanks, Pazzo. I'm particular about what I eat and the way I want it prepared, but I also hate to make a fuss, so I took my new meal and left, assembling my own awkward sandwich back at the office.\nToday, prepared by what I had experienced the last time, ordered the same ham & cheese sandwich, asking for gluten-free bread and within the comments on both the sandwich part of my order as well as the general comments on the order, asked that the sandwich 'filling' be put in a separate container than the salad. Again, no condiments, no dressing. When I arrived to pick it up, it was the same as last time - ham & cheese & onions piled on top of my sandwich and bread on the side. The cashier (I think the same guy) again, looks sheepish and starts to explain about the GF bread. I tell him I already know about the bread, but had asked that the sandwich be separate from the salad so he brings it back to the kitchen window - not for them to remake, but just separate... sigh. He then rings me up and only after I get my change and am waiting for my order to I realize that they charge extra for the tiny GF bread - and that it wasn't mentioned anywhere in the online ordering. Also, I took out the side of dressing that I asked them to not include and left it on the counter. It's wasteful for it to be included if I'm just going to throw it away.\nI appreciate that a gluten-free bread option is available, but if it's not big enough to serve a sandwich on, it's kind of pointless. And if the kitchen can't follow written instructions, it worries me that people might be getting served things they can't, shouldn't, or don't want to eat.", "author": "molly h."}

The food was fine, but I had a bad experience that makes me not want to return here. I will explain:\n\nI met a friend for lunch here today. We ordered separately, but right after each other. She got her food within a few minutes as expected, but twenty minutes after ordering, my order still hasn't arrived! In fact, they didn't even have my ticket in the queue when I finally came over to ask about it.\n\nThe staff and I later deduced what I suspected had happened in the first place. After I placed my order, someone else later ordered the exact same thing I did. The kindly stranger sees my order come out and accepts it as his before my number is even called, happy to receive such quick service. Meanwhile, I'm waiting outside with my friend's food getting cold. Unbeknownst to him, the stranger's order comes out and stagnates, as he as already eaten.\n\nWhile I should be upset with the stranger who took my order, I never knew who this person was. A simple solution could have prevented this if the staff verified that the correct orders go to their respective patrons when they come to the counter. After all, they give us a copy of the order/ticket with the numbers printed on them. I was offered no retribution.", "author": "Bryan E."}

The sandwich was delicious, with a tasty marinara to complement the well-prepared meatballs.  Unlike other eateries that attempt to make a similar creation, the meatballs were moist and not overcooked to point of resembling the rubber balls you'd get as a kid from the quarter vending machines.  As a table we shared an order of the pesto garlic cheese bread, which was good but seemed to be missing something.  The side salad has a decent vinagrette, that may be a bit overseasoned for most tastes.\n\nThe seating offers both an indoor and outdoor option, which is a plus for the normally sunny SOMA neighborhood.  The only other drawbacks I could find were repeated venturing back to the counter for utensils and condiments - and unfortunately having my order take 10 minutes longer to prepare than the rest of my party.\n\nOn the whole, I really enjoyed the good food and hearty portions of Caffe Pazzo.  With the limitation of truly good options to eat around my work, Caffe Pazzo looks like a place that should consistently deliver a quality meal that sends me back to work satisfied (if a little sleepy)", "author": "Drew W."}

Unfortunately, the quality has really gone down. I ordered the bleu cheese Caesar with steak. The menu says it's \"grilled flank steak.\" The last time I order it, that's what I got, and it was great. This time, the steak was super thinly sliced roast beef. Not grilled. This was more like deli meat. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't \"grilled flank steak\" either.\n\nI also ordered an iced tea. Pretty simple. I remember I liked the iced tea last night. But now instead of brewing ice tea, it's from a powder, and it's really artificial tasting. I couldn't finish it.\n\nIt's a shame, really.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-05", "description": "There is nothing worse than leaving a place feeling that you made the wrong entree choice. I ordered clam chowder and a chicken sandwich instead of the spaghetti and meatballs.  In our group of five, the ones that ordered the meatball sandwich and steak sandwich were very happy with their choices.  \n\nInitially, I thought about ordering the spaghetti and meatballs dish but then I visualized myself spilling it all over my dress shirt so I played it safe and went with the chicken sandwich.   My roasted garlic-sage chicken sandwich was good but nothing special.  I liked the asiago cheese on the sandwich and thought the aioli sauce was decent.  I didn't taste though any seasoning on the chicken and thought it was a little bland and dry.\n\nThe clam chowder wasn't creamy enough and just tasted generic.  This is a common complaint of mine in regards to clam chowder at cafes and restaurants in the city so I did not take the clam chowder into consideration with my rating of Caffe Pazzo.  \n\nThe only place I have had great clam chowder in San Francisco is at Fisherman's Wharf of all places.  Few people go to Fisherman's Wharf besides tourists or if you have a visitor in town and reluctantly agree to see Alcatraz for the eighth time.  However, I find myself at least once a month taking the cable car from Powell Street to Fisherman's Wharf with all the tourists hanging out of the cable car and taking pictures just so I can have decent clam chowder.  Once I get off the cable car and land in Fisherman's Wharf, the questions start from all directions. \n\n\"How long are you staying in San Francisco?\"  \n\"Where are you from?\" \n\"Would you like to rent a bike to go over Golden Gate Bridge?\"  \n\"Are you interested in a day cruise around the bay? \n\"How about five postcards for $1?\" \n \nAfter talking with people trying to sell me day trips, cruises, or  five postcards for a $1, I usually watch the bushman jump out at people for a few hours but then after that, I finally grab a great bread bowl of clam chowder on the street and all is good.  \n\nI'll keep looking for a great place for clam chowder in the city but until then, I'll take the cable car with the tourists to Fisherman's Wharf at least once a month and continue pretending to be a farmer from Iowa as I'm bombarded with people trying to sell me tourist stuff.", "author": "Josh K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-19", "description": "I've been working in SOMA for about 8 months, bouncing here and there for lunch, getting bored easily, never dazzled, never satisfied.  Until I found Caffe Pazzo.  I've been coming here pretty much every day for the last month and a half, and let me tell you why.\n\nFirst of all, it's impossible to become bored with their menu, because of their awesome daily specials.  And they are just that...daily.  Every day, it's like a little adventure, going on the website to check out the specials.\n\nSecond of all, their prices.  I see a lot of people on here complaining that they're a bit pricey.  Nay, I say.  Having explored every food institution within a 10 block radius, I challenge you to find a place that is not only cheaper but better tasting.  You may find one or the other, but not both.\n\nThirdly, (is that a word?) the ease of ordering.  I place my order online at about 11 every morning, and schedule to pick it up at 1:00, which is when I take my lunch.  And it's always ready for me.\n\nThe people who work there are very friendly.  Especially the guy who normally works at the register when I get there.  He recognized me the second time I came in, so now when he sees me walk in the door, he magically has my order sitting next to him when I get to the front of the line.  And it's not like I have a unicorn horn, or wear a kimono, I don't stand out in a crowd, and seeing how crowded it gets in there, that impressed me.  And now I suddenly feel like a very big jerk for not knowing his name.  Note to self: ask nice dude his name.\n\nSo, back to the food... When nothing on the daily specials really catches my eye, I have a standard staple that I always order, that hasn't let me down yet.  Soup and salad...boring you say?  Oh no.  For $6.50 you get a beautiful, rather large salad that contains fresh greens, dried cranberries, candied walnuts and blue cheese, with a yummy vinaigrette, and a generous portion of your choice of soup.  They always have 3 to choose from, 1 of which changes daily, 1 of which is always gazpacho with an add-prawn option (haven't tried that one, not too crazy about cold soup), and the last is always their vegetable and orzo soup which is surprisingly good.  When I first ordered it, I thought it looked bland, but the broth is very flavorful, and all the veggies in it are always still crisp, never soggy.   So I get that, grab a couple of free slices of really good French bread that they leave out, and bada bing, lunch of champions.\n\nI have ordered a few things which I thought were meh.  But I do not blame Pazzo, I only blame myself.  I don't like sun dried tomatoes, so why would I order something with sun dried tomatoes in them?  I don't know, but I did.  One time I ordered a sandwich special they had with so many ingredients that I couldn't even imagine what it would taste like (seared ahi, avocado, pineapple and cheese, among other things.)  I thought it could have done without at least one of the ingredients.  But I applauded their creative effort.\n\nTheir normal seared ahi tuna sandwich on their menu is really very good.  That's another basic I'll order, on a Friday (because it's $9, so it's a treat) if nothing on the specials menu screams at me.\n\nAll in all, I'm into Pazzo.  It makes me happy.\n\n****Was just there again today.  Nice dude introduced himself to me.  His name is Rich, for your information.  I'm a little slow on the uptake, and it wasn't until after I left that I thought to myself \"Hmmm, maybe he read my Yelp review.\"  If so, then he knew who I was, and that, again is impressive.\"***", "author": "Cat R."}

They have a good variety of food from sandwiches to soups to salads, all DELICIOUS and with pretty good prices.  The owner owns Dos Pinas as well which I love too.  Their split pea soup is TO DIE FOR-its soooo delicious and has sweet yam bits in it and bacon bits and comes with a side of this toasted garlic bread and all for only like $2.95! yummm", "author": "Renee S."}

The grilled cheese was on crunchy bread with nuts and was melted with shallots, but there was too much grease from the cheese and butter. It was a good deal for a mini sandwich and soup though ($6). I usually go here when I need to hit up the B of A across the street since the wait can take up to 15 minutes and they are pretty packed at lunch. More seating is available on the mezzanine level and the dining area receives lotsa light.  Parking can also be a drag.", "author": "Kim G."}

Prices are okay, a little high but normal for the city. My biggest gripe... okay, is it just me or does this place just SMELL weird!? The smell always hits me and until my nose is able to normalize it, I just find it pretty offensive... like a bathroom odor, really. Everyone I've been with has said they'd either sort of smelled it or don't really mind, and their major problem is the seating on the first floor. Still, consistently been good for lunch.", "author": "Jessica L."}

I like the salads a lot. The sandwiches are okay. The service has always been good to me. I haven't had to wait for very long and I never have to wait if I order online. The trick is not to show up at 12:30 expecting to get your sandwich or salad in 5 minutes. There is usually a like of at least 10 people and another 5-6 people waiting on their orders. There aren't many options in this area, and this is a good one!", "author": "Krystal S."}

The complaints I've read below are pretty pathetic you bunch of whiners. \n\nGranted I've only been eating here for about two months, I'll say that in that time, it's been consistently good, sometimes delicious, sometimes, just good. But consistent, quick (for the quality of food) and in the last few months sitting outside is so awesome. \n\nSince it's a grab and go joint, I don't need to critique any more than saying the staff is as courteous as they need to be. They say thank you and get the job done. \n\nI love the Steve's special of half pizza and half ceaser salad. I have the Einstein (tuna) salad a lot, and I think that needs more lettuce with it, but it's still just fine. The hot sandwiches are good and I want to try the blue cheese steak salad but haven't got there yet.", "author": "Eric D."}

They have daily specials that include different salads, sandwiches, and pizzas. Their soups change everyday. What I like about this cafe is that they have options for pizza and salad, sandwich and salad, soup and salad, and other such combinations. Even a little grilled cheese and soup. Yum. Pretty reasonably priced, I'd say usually 8-12 bucks for lunch. Their soups are almost always good (chicken chowder and tomato soup and curry chicken soup). If you come at noon tho, be prepared for a wait. This cafe is the type where after you get in line to order, they call out your number and you pick up your food. It's sometimes really slow to get your food once you've ordered and they're really busy! Tips: They post their menu on their site everyday! Also they provide free bread by the pick up counter as well as olive oil and vinegar to eat with it! Call in or fax your order too!", "author": "Christine L."}
