Yet alone a drive through visit! I had the Wakey Bakey Hash. So good! Hash browns, cheese, seasoning, and egg. I wish it weren't Limited Edition! I'm so sad it's only available for a short amount of time. My food was a little bit salty, but that's okay because the customer service was just amazing and that really topped off our experience. Our food was fresh and hot. The wonderful staff were so friendly and welcoming. We will probably be coming back soon!", "author": "Catalina G."}

At a jack in the box? \nMy coworker had ordered a spicy sriracha curly fry burger and when we got our order we were checked out by a super sweet lady in a \"Jack\" Apron around 5:20AM with brown hair , it took like 15minutes for us to get our order of a burger(not the combo) and a shake...way too long for our taste but no big deal, we had just gotten off our long shifts and we wanted to eat and sleep.\nWe get our food and leave..not even a couple hundred feet after exiting , my coworker notices they got the order wrong , it was the regular sriracha burger (i had no idea there was a difference ) . We went back to the drivethrough and told the lady who checked us out and her expression changed so quickly. She grabbed the bag, looked inside and SNAPPED at us that we ordered the sriracha burger. We kept telling her we didn't (if i had the receipt i would've even shown her but she failed to give me that..) she literally ARGUED with us. My coworker and I were calm while she was raising her voice at us and telling us what we did order and what we didn't. I was so taken aback to see someone's attitude change from completely sweet to a major b&tch. My mouth was open in disbelief the entire time , she was moving her head and hands with attitude on top of it all. We literally had to clarify with her that we weren't upset and we just wanted our order, that's all..then she took a deep breath, turned around and slammed the bag on the counter... The guy who took our order came around when she walked off and asked us if she gave us the sriracha curly fry burger , even her own coworker clarified that she had messed up..give or take another 15 and she comes back with our order with a smile. Talk about some major bipolar disorder. We've all worked retail and i can only imagine the amount of terrible customers they have to deal with but jesus , that was BY FAR the worst experience ive ever had at any retail/food place to this day.

I hate to give them a 2-star because there's only two Jack in the Box one on Bayshore and one in Daly City the one in Daly City the people are extremely nice but the one here why do you always have to wait for your food so long? there's always a long line in the Drive-Thru there's always a long line inside then how do you fuck up your order a burger is a burger? this is why I don't like fast food.\nBut since I was on my way home from the movies and I was in a cab we went to the drive-thru took 20 minutes that's ridiculous and it was only 3 cars ahead of us but at least I could say they gave me the correct food I do like their fries,but I don't like their buns I wouldn't even call it a bun I have no idea what the hell it was? The burger was mah. \nI know you're a fast food place but Step Up Your Service be a little bit more personal don't have a attitude if you don't like working there then go somewhere else but I think you're making what 15 bucks an hour to flip hamburgers.

This location has a long time problem with panhandlers, opportunistic thieves hanging (hub caps beware) etc. So I rarely go here. In addition, \"Jack\" tends to be more expensive than the other guys and you tend to wait longer.  But the new Smokey Cheddar Chicken sandwich prompted me to swing on by.  But, I was really taken aback that the deal I saw on TV ($4.99 meal deal) was $9.00 here.  Sheesh.  $9.00 for a grungy drive through experience. Even so, I ordered the expensive meal: Chicken Sandwich no Bacon.  I think I was on a mission, so fine. \n\nWhen I got to the window, they re-read my order as a \"burger\". So I said \"Chicken, no bacon\". A sort of irritated and, I would argue, rude, worker said \"yeah you got chicken\" with a poor attitude. Well....don't call it a Burger, it isn't a burger and guests wouldn't have to ask and double check if you said it right in the first place. Small point in reality, but because fast food places screw up so often and having to drive back sucks, and because getting home to find out that you we given something that you would never eat or order really sucks.....customers will have to double check when you don't call it out correctly.\n\nThe sandwich was fine.

It's a temporary new item. \n\nI came to try it just out of curiosity, because it's the only clone that's made to order. So u get them hot, unlike all competitors who serve them cold.\n\nThis location is a franchise so they charge $2.99 for 3 (regular JIB owned stores charge $1.99 for 3). No big deal, it's still a reasonable price when considering that most fake cronut imitations charge $5 each.\n\nThese are plain (dusted in cinnamon sugar), without any glazing or cream filling (the NY original).\n\nThese hot donuts were actually not bad, they're soft exactly like malasadas in Hawaii. But since JIB calls them cronuts, I expected layers inside and a slightly crisp exterior (fresh out of the fryer). It had neither, so I was a bit disappointed.

Each time we'd order something he would say it rudely - we went to the front of the window and he looked at us all snarky and we were confused, we were just trying to order your food? Then I think he was the manager, he was a short Mexican rude man. He gave us our bags and I pointed saying \"can I have some ranch please\" and he said \"what? You expect me to know what you're saying if you're just pointing at your bag??\" I was in shock, I told him \" I said can I have ranch please???\" And he said \"no you didn't.

I would have given it 4 if it weren't that annoyance that greets me \"adios\" at the end of the drive-through. I've been to this site a few times and each time it's always like that.\n\nIf it were possible to find something quick on those late clubbing scenes and you can feed to the grease urge that you get on those late night fiasco's...argh..\n\nThe late night DJ here is quite amusing too.. a think he's been here a couple years now, it's been awhile since my last visit, but there is this deep sounding Barry White voice on the other end of the the mic. You hope to get a dark tall maybe middle aged sexy man serving you, instead you get this fat small balding late 50's maybe close to 60's could possibly be Latin or Indian grandpa serving your meal in a bag from the counter window. Not at all what you expect but he is really nice and always greeting you well on your way out. Reminds me of my grand uncles :-) (that's why it deserved another star)...\n\nI have experienced better, Quite often our burgers are just a fresh, but a few times we walk out with not so hot fries, instead just warm so make sure to mention fresh fries! I would come back if I were in the area and had no other choice.", "author": "Ateh M."}

They have a drive-through, a parking lot, and the people who work here are nice, normal, and do a great job putting the food together.  Sure, it's just fast food, but there's still a difference between a sloppy, slapped-together mess that's missing something versus a meal that simply comes quickly.  Case in point, the tacos they make here are consistently plump and stuffed full of lettuce with a decent amount of hot sauce, much unlike the dismal ones from the Union Square Jack in the Box.", "author": "daphne w."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-02-13", "description": "I know you're a San Francisco snob and the simple idea of Jack in the Box offends your sensibilities. Personally I'm embarrassed when I make the lonely trek here every coupla months when the girlfriend is outta town and it's late. I'd never show up at home with fast food.\n\nBut let's be honest. There are few things in life as satisfying as the Jack-in-the-Box taco. I've been eating them for maybe 27 years. They're great; especially when the American cheese wedged in there hasn't quite melted. It's like In and Out. Lick the paper material.\n\nThis Jack in the Box is kind of a dump. It scares me to go here. But now and then on the way home from drumming I'll stop by. \n\nThe drive up is always packed so it's get stuck halfway in traffic or wait for someone in the other lane to drive up and cut in front of you. There are always seedy looking types hanging out the parking lot and panhandlers staring with hungry eyes by the pick up window. Once some guy cussed me out and once someone passed out next to the ordering station. You're kind of trapped in the parking lot, can't back out, can't move forward, so lock your doors.\n\nIt's a dirty and gross block but the food seems ok for what it is. And the service has gotten better. You know what, it's f'ing Jack in the Box. \n\n5 stars for the tacos, 2 stars for the location.", "author": "creige a."}
