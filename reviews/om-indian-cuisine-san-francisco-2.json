It's bursting with flavor, and the sauce is a little bit different than some other places - maybe heavier on the vegetable content actually - I'm really fond of it. They're also nice and include plenty of sauce for your rice or even to save and cook some yourself. \n\n I also love their chicken chili, and their coconut chicken. Both are also a little different than other places but still delicious. \n\nMy biggest complaint is the price/size. Compared to some other Indian places, the price is a little larger and the size is a little smaller. Still, I'll definitely be back! Well, figuratively - I guess they'll be back at my place! Delivery is just way convenient, and I have no complaints about the flavor etc.", "author": "Chris S."}

I ordered Bhindi Masala and chicken tikka masala with garlic naan. Everything was awful. Bhindi masala so over cooked it was inedible. Tasted burnt and bitter and just was terrible. Usually Bhindi masala is herbaceous and flavorful, this was definitely not that. The chicken tikka masala was so salty. At other Indian restaurants the chicken falls apart because it is so tender in the sauces. This was hard chicken with zero flavor, I've had been chicken tikka masala from Trader Joe's. The naan was also burnt and flavorless. Did I get a bad night for the chef? I don't know but I won't be trying this place again, super disappointing.", "author": "Meghan G."}

The curry sauce is cooked to a silky, creamy, and flavorful delight. It was rich but not overly dense, which satiates you, but not to the point that you feel stuffed. Om is also quite generous in the amount of naan they provide - the two naan pieces are so long that they overflow the basket. They are soft, warm, and bursting with flavor (try the garlic naan!) As a bonus, the restaurant provides a complimentary appetizer: papadum (thin, baked dough) with three types of sauces. This should be a go-to Indian restaurant!", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

They pay attention to details and are very heavy handed on spices, which if you are going for Indian food, that's what you should expect.\n\nWe love \n1. Chicken tandoori: the sauce (sweet, sour, spicy, and savory) is so bright and mouthwatering. You simply have to try.\n2. Lamb shank: meat is falling off the bones\n3. Chicken tikka masala: average, I prefer my tikka masala sauce to be chunkier, not as watery, but the flavor is still very good\n4. Saag paneer: they brown the cheese cubes, which brings out the flavor \n5. Aloo gobi and baigan bharta: great vegetarian dishes.\n6. Garlic naan: fluffy, chewy, and moist. Right on guys.\nWe do not like the pudina paratha, which is a wheat bread. It is hard and taste like cardboard\n\nTip:\nTheir spice level is not consistent. When in doubt, round down. I order their spiciest level a couple times. Once, it was so spicy that even after adding 200% more bland vegetable and rice in it, it was still too spicy, and I usually eat at the spiciest level at asian cuisines.", "author": "Tata X."}

We decided to order delivery from two different places for lunch. (Yes, we are fat a$$es!) I placed an order through UberEATS on Monday, January 16th at 1:01pm. It arrived at 1:53pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Samosa: Homemade crispy Indian pastry stuffed with spiced peas and potatoes, Served with homemade mint chutney, hot and sour, and tamarind chutney ($4.95)\n*Chicken Momo: Nepali delicacy cooked with ground chicken and Himalayan spices filled in cover with thin flour dough and steamed ($8.95)\n*Chicken Tikka Masala: Roasted chicken breast cooked in creamy tomato and onion sauce ($12.95)\n*Chicken Vindaloo: Boneless cubes of chicken cooked with potatoes, onion, ginger, garlic, and ground spices in a hot and tangy sauce ($11.95)\n*Serrano Chili Naan: Naan brushed with blended green chili ($2.95)\n*Assorted Bread: Combination of garlic, onion, and butter naan ($7.95)\n\nI love my Indian food spicy, so I was happy they served serrano naan. It added a great kick to the curries. I adore thick curries, but the tikka masala was actually a little too thick for me. I did love the spice level and flavors though. We ended up adding the vindaloo sauce to the tikka masala to thin it out a bit. The samosas were great! Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I didn't really like the mint chutney though. It wasn't creamy and minty enough. I love dumplings so I decided to get the momos. I think they come with a dipping sauce as I got something I thought was the hot and sour sauce for the samosas. It tasted more like a chutney I've had in the past with momos. The roommate enjoyed the dishes he ordered, the vindaloo and the assorted naans.\n\nIndian is one of my comfort foods, so I'm glad I discovered another great option for delivery.", "author": "Elena N."}

Ordered 3 things: chicken naan, vegetable pakora, and chicken saag. \n\nThe chicken naan was quite moist. It had been wrapped in foil, to keep it warm I'm sure, but what ended up happening was it was just soggy by the time it arrived. Also could not pick up any trace of chicken in there. It was rather bland naan, which says a lot considering naan is bland to begin with. \n\nThe vegetable pakora was also disappointing. There was absolutely no crunch to it. The flavor was also bland on these. There were 2 dipping sauces, neither of which did the trick as far as adding good flavor goes. \n\nThe one redeeming dish was the chicken saag. It was fantastic. Good enough to turn a 1 star review into a 3 star. The chicken was tender and juicy and the saag was perfectly flavored. Just the right amount of spice. While not the most visually appealing dish, I would certainly order this again. \n\nThe delivery itself showed up about 35 minutes late.

Arun Kumar Dangi was at Clay Oven when my wife and I first met him.  He is an amazing, energetic, and very positive human being, which you see reflected in the esprit de corps of the restaurants he has run.  More recently he was at Tara Indian on Market Street, and vastly improved that location.\n\nSo now I go to see him at Om.  To me it's a combination of really friendly people, super delicious Nepali-influenced Indian cuisine, and a comfortable, charming eating environment.\n\nI have probably tried most of the items on the menu, but I'll just comment on a few.  Recently I had the chicken tikka masala, behgan bharta, and saag paneer.  The first of these was creamy, with a delicate flavor.  The behgan bharta had a smoky flavor, with onions delicately cooked, and was actually somewhat spicy.  (I prefer my food quite spicy, but didn't make any special requests this time.) The saag paneer was lemony, and I really liked the chunks of cheese.\n\nEven more recently, I went with my family; Arun made a special soup for my mother-in-law who likes mild food, and one of the standout dishes was the tandoori salmon.\n\nAnd I have to comment on the pakoras.  I don't think I've had them as good at any Indian restaurant I've ever been too.  Some kind of combination of spices that I can't possibly guess at.\n\nThe place is cute and rustic inside, with a beautiful hand-embroidered piece in the back room showing deities of the Bhagavad Gita.  \n\nI really like Om.  It's a place with a lot of heart and great food, I highly recommend it.", "author": "Kai M."}

Needless to say it was a disappointment!\nCasual ambience,good seating capacity the restaurant is located on a busy street.\nMid afternoon when there wasn't any large crowd in the restaurant barring a few the service time was certainly longer!\n\nOur order was pretty simple. For starters we had..\n\n#Vegetable pakora - if the pakoras only have onions in them then the name should be otherwise and not vegetables!! Had them slightly over fried to the color and taste! Though it tasted well it lacked in the usual crispness of a pakora. 6-8 pieces.\nServed with a mint chutney.\n\nMain course order was for..\n#Mushroom Matter- We had asked for spicy and it was true to its word! The portion size was good for 2 eats. Well seasoned and served hot. Was moist enough hence tasted well with the bread ordered.\nDefinitely flavorful.\n\n#Pudina wheat Paratha-\n  Again the roast on the paratha was extra n hence felt the burnt taste to the palate. Presence of pudina was minimum though were decently soft.Sized well, served 2 pieces in the basket. \n\nDessert-\n#Gulab Jamun- \nPartially raw n cold!! Was a sheer disappointment! 2 Gulab jamuns in a plate with no syrup they felt dry. \n\n# Drinks\nMango Lassi- Good flavored,rightly sweet and not too thick to drink as well.\n\nOverall the restaurant needs to pay minute to the right way of treating n cooking the food.

The delivery beat the estimated time by about 20 minutes and the food was still incredibly temperature hot when it arrived.\n\nAloo Saag: Creamy spinach but not too fake tasting. Great flavored potatoes.  Overall nice dish.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala: sauce is super flavorful; it's on the lighter side of flavor and color.  Chicken was super tough and dry. That was a bummer because the flavor is good.  Maybe it was a fluke and this batch just had chicken that was overcooked, I hope.\n\nOkra: It's pretty mainstream.  Good but nothing out of this world. I could have done without it.  It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't special.  Lots of onions and tomatoes go along with the okra.\n\nDal Makhani: This was my favorite dish.  Creamy but yet still tasted like lentils. Super flavorful.  Who knew this veggie dish could be so amazing.  I would order this again in a heartbeat.\n\nVeggie Biryani: Interesting.  Didn't taste like the normal aromatic biryanis I've had before and it was even a little bit like sticky rice instead of the drier long grain rice dish.  It was more like fried rice I think.  Not bad but nothing special.\n\nRice: the rice servings are a little small so I ran out of rice so maybe order a little extra rice or naan if you need it to soak up the curries!\n\nThey threw in some raita and the brown and green sauce too!\n\nOverall great flavors and it survived delivery so well! \n\nSuper friendly and fast delivery.

I paid over $15 (not counting delivery charges) for a single order of chicken tikka masala--which came spilled and in one of the smallest food containers. Mind you, there were no napkins or utensils--or even rice to come with my order! Perhaps they expected me to drink the liquid? Well perhaps that would actually be apt because it was the most watered-down version of chicken tikka masala I've ever had; in the whole order, there was maybe 4 chicken pieces total.

Over-pricing, lackluster service, and meager portions all being tell-tale signs. \n\nIn particular, a place to get good Indian food in the neighborhood has been sorely lacking. \"Great Indian Food\" (creative name, no?), located across the street from this place, was ooooookay but nothing to write home about, and ended up going out of business. Tikka Masala, the predecessor for Om, was downright terrible (how do you manage to get chai tea to taste like rotting vegetables?!). So out goes the Tikka, in comes the Om. And I'm so very glad it did!\n\nFirst of all, our server Reason, was one in a million. He had such a relaxed and honest ease about him, telling us he eats Om's food regularly and that it is very good. He was extremely personable and went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our meal and time in the vicinity. Sure, this can be typical of new restaurants, more often it will be the owners who come over and try to schmooze and talk up their menu. Beyond all Reason-able doubt, this guy was just very friendly and personable at the core. And he did not lie! The food was delicious.\n\nWe had the Lamb Rogan Joe (interesting name, no?), the Vegan Dahl, Garlic Naan, and a side of Basmati Rice. Along with our free serving of Papadum from checking in on Yelp (which we did at Reason's suggestion), this was definitely enough for us to walk away feeling full and satisfied. \n\nPapadum-Crispy and light, I loved the sauces it was served with. One was tamarind-based and sweet, another had more of a spicy kick, and the third had a fresh lime and cilantro flavor.\n\nGarlic Naan-Fluffy and so satisfying to pull apart, as naan should be. The garlic and herbs it was baked with made it extra delicious.\n\nVegan Dahl-Very savory non-meat addition, and though I'd order it with medium spice next time, it's good to know that ordering a dish as \"mild\" here means you get what you ask for.\n\nLamb Seth-I mean-Joe Rogan. Rogan Joe. Yeah...-SO RICH and flavorful, as much as you want from a lamb dish. The Dahl didn't really need a rice addition but having the side of basmati definitely complimented this lamb-based dish by making it more share-able and adding texture.\n\nBasmati rice was fluffy and dry in that nice flavor-soaking way basmati has about it. There were some peas incorporated in it, too, which was nice.\n\nWe will definitely be back to dinner here, it is so nice to have another palatable spot on Haight.

Having realized our family gathering location has changed, we were understandable bummed out - but our opinion changed within minutes!\n\nThe owner sat us in the back room (our favorite spot - which NOW has an insane hand painted mural and new TVs for snazzy music videos). We had a really awesome convo with him before finding out he was the owner. He is super personable and passionate about his business; we really enjoyed talking with him through the evening! \n\nNow to the menu.... My dad is a total meat eater, I eat mostly vegan, and my mom is somewhere in between. This menu had something for everyone, and my favorite part was the labeling of the vegan items (WooHoo!).

I really wanted our dinner to be as sumptuous as I'd heard this place was but our meal was really disappointing.\n\nMy spouse and I arrived for dinner on a Wednesday evening at 730,  when there were just a few other folks in the restaurant. We ordered our meal: Chicken Momo as an appetizer, Salmon with spinach, rice, coconut naan and a single Kingfisher beer. Ten minutes later, the restaurant started to fill up, and we saw the folks at the table next to us get seated. The folks at that table next to us ordered after us, but got the Chicken Momo fried dumping appetizer very shortly after they ordered it. I was confused so I said to the waiter, \"I think that may be our order of Chicken Momo,\" but the waiter assured me it was not. 45 minutes after we ordered, our main dish arrived - and to their credit, the salmon was fresh, the spinach was tasty and it was wonderful - along with the basmati rice and delicious coconut naan. Yet still, no Chicken Momo. \n\nAs our dinner plates were being cleared, the waiter asked how everything was. Once again, we said we never received the Chicken Momo appetizer. He assured us that it was coming. Almost an hour after we ordered, the Chicken Momo came out - and with my first bite, I immediately realized the insides were ice cold. My spouse noticed the same thing. I told the waiter, who looked astounded when I said it was completely inedible. The waiter finally relented when I asked, \"Who wants to eat raw chicken?\"\n\nNo, the restaurant didn't charge us for inedible food that we couldn't eat. And yes, I appreciate the 10% discount off our bill. But when the waiter said he was bringing us out a comped dessert of rice pudding -- which neither of us can eat because we cannot eat dairy -- we protested and asked him not to do so. Nonetheless, the rice pudding was placed on our table and sat untouched. So that was a terrible waste of food, which really unnerved me. It would have been better customer service to at least comp us our Kingfisher beer, which we did drink.\n\nSo I'm sad to say, no thanks.", "author": "Susan L."}

The lamb vindaloo (mild, and truly mild) was great and the meat was excellent! I can be squeamish when it comes to subpar meat and nothing about either dish was anything but great. No toughness or pieces you have to chew on for 5 minutes. I've taken back dishes, not ordered again, or not gone back to other Indian places due to their lamb.  Everything else was good as well. (samosas, rice, naan)\n\nIt's not cheap but the food quality doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe only non-positive observation is that when you walk into the restaurant, you immediately notice 2 large \"watch your step\" construction looking signs slapped onto the back of the front 2 bar stools. Maybe they are temporary but I didn't get that impression because the floor there is raised.

Our water cups were never even half empty!  The complimentary rice pudding after each dinner is always a nice touch as well!\n\n\n\nAs for the food recommendations;\n\nLamb samosas mixed with the sweet plum chutney and slightly-spicy green chutney with a touch of the pickled vegetables is a must! (Note: If you aren't using the trifecta of \"sauces\" then you aren't doing it right!)\n\nNavratan Korma is my favorite veggie dish! Sweet, creamy and compliments anything spicy on the table.\n\nBengan Bhartha also has a sweet after-taste, but the best part about this eggplant based curry is that you can hardly taste the eggplant, which is great for someone like me who isn't a big fan of eggplant!\n\nThe Tikka Masala (chicken or paneer), the Alu Vindaloo, the Aloo Matar, and the variety of Naan (especially the garlic basil) are TEXTBOOK classic here!\n\nTired the Lamb Biryani last night for the first time, and it truly was \"highly aromatic\" with a nice spicy kick.

After a resent neighborhood move, I was thrilled to discover this gem of a place in the Haight. The food is fresh, served hot ( no buffet ) by a charming and thorough wait staff. I personally like spicy hot, but the heat of the dishes is negotiable and the servers are especially helpful in recommending heat as well as menu items. Papadum, a wafer thin cracker is brought to the table right after you order with 3 sauces, a spicy, a sweet and a mint chutney. Their Daal soup is some of the best I have had. Thick and temperature hot with bits of lentils and goodness. I love the Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo and my vegetable favorite is the Aloo Gobi. Potatoes and cauliflower cooked perfectly. Tender but with a tooth... not mushy. A lovely cup of Masala Chai is a great finish especially on a cool foggy San Francisco afternoon. A great restaurant that I find myself in weekly.

We were greeted immediately by the owner and promptly seated. The dining room was cozy and tastefully decorated, despite the fact they had only been open for a couple days. There's also a larger dining/banquet room in the back. \n\nFirst we had some Papadum wafer appetizers, served with 3 dipping sauces.\n\nUpon the owner's suggestion, I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, which he insisted was different/better than what is served elsewhere. It didn't disappoint. Sauce was a creamy coconut curry, and perfectly seasoned. Chicken was moist and tender(so simple, but so important!). We also tried the Lamb Rogan Josh. Not sure about the story behind the name of this dish, but it certainly satisfied my craving for lamb, along with a little heat(medium spicy). Loved the spice combination and garlic in the sauce and the lamb was, yet again, very tender.\n\nWe ordered basmati rice and fresh naan with the meal which, in my opinion, is a must.\n\nAfter speaking with the owner, I learned he was actually from Nepal and legit, explaining the presence of some of the Himalayan dishes on the menu.\n\nHonestly, my only regret is that I didn't try more stuff here.

I was really looking forward to a new Indian restaurant for our rotation.\n\nMy chief complaints: it's about 20% more expensive than the other places we order from. That would be ok if it was the only problem, but combined with the food not being very good, we probably won't order from Om again.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Papadum, $1.50 - fine. Was a little darker than I'm used to but perfectly fine.\n- Tandoori Chicken Wings, $9.95 these were good.\n- Tandoori Assorted, $10.95 - fine. No grizzly meats, so that's good. But they were missing a nice little tangy kick.\n- Spicy Mixed Vegetables Soup, $5.95 - first disappointment: for the price, it was a tiny portion. And the flavor was lame, and the clear soup had some kind of thickening agent that made it more like Chinese gelatinous soup. Very low on flavor. Certainly no kick from anything lemony. Highly overpriced.\n- Chicken Mulligatawny Soup, $5.95 - also a tiny portion. Very low on flavor. Highly overpriced.\n- Baigan Bharta (Vegan), $10.95 - fine. Nothing special.\n- Bhindi Masala (Vegan), $10.95 - low on flavor. \n- Mushroom Matar (Vegan), $10.95 - fine.\n- Chicken Tikka Kebab, $12.95 - fine. Also missing that nice tikka tangy kick.\n- Butter Chicken Masala, $12.95 - fine.\n- Tandoori Roti, $2.00 - low on flavor.\n- Laccha Paratha, $3.95 - low on flavor.\n- Jeera Rice, $4.50 - nothing special. normal rice. highly overpriced.\nTotal bill was $125, which was a bit higher than our usual dinner for 2 adults, 3 kids and leftovers for the next day.

This will be my new go-to Indian spot for those lazy nights in! You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Jessica W."}

The interior was nicely decorated. I was welcomed with free papadum. The sauce came with papadum had amazing flavor. I ordered  tikka masala, garlic naan and chicken tikka kebab it was so fast and very yummy...  Naan was like a foot long, tikka kebab was well cooked and chicken tikka masala is the best so far. I would definitely recommend and visit again to this fancy restaurant in upper haight", "author": "Anil P."}

I was so impressed by the quality of their food, considering that I went there on the second day of opening. I ordered the chicken tikka masala and it definitely surpassed my expectations. The chicken was so juicy and tender and the sauce was creamy and coconutty. I'm proud to say that, that was the best chicken tikka masala I have ever had! Even though this place is still under some construction, it has a pretty chill vibe the service was adequate. I will for sure come back and try their other selections of food.", "author": "Ashley O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-03", "description": "I've never been to India so I don't know how authentic the food is but I really liked it. It's a big step up from its two predecessors. The owner Ajay (sp?) is young, ambitious, and wants to provide good food and service.I had both.  The chai spices are subtle and not overwhelming.  The creamy tikka masala has a hint of spiciness which I like.  Had a choice of little to heavy heat.  The mango chutney and raita are a nice accompaniment .  The chicken was tender and fresh.  I took 1/2 my order home to save for dinner. It was even better reheated.  I can't give it 4 stars cause it's so new and will have growing pains.", "author": "Alston L."}

We've been searching since we moved to the city for our go-to Indian place. Who'd have thought this would be the place!?

However we were VERY impressed with the food. The butter chicken and daal makhani were the best we have had for a long time. The lamb was amazingly tender in the kebabs.

I was greeted as soon as I entered later I came to realise that he's the owner of that place Mr.aj Not too clumsy good scape between the tables which gives some privacy which has been lacked now a days beyond that we were given enough time and complimentary papad mean while we had a good glance at the menu.... Here's the real part which proves the class of the restaurant in which this place has excelled.... Can't say one particular dish is delicious I tried some pakoras tandoori chkn wings and the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and some basmati rice which are really mouth watering, it's better to try this kind of place which is run by an individual who treats each and every customer in a well mannered way which makes people feel comfortable who came to dine out with some hunger,celebrate their memorable spl movements obviously expect some hospitality which these guys had plenty some ova here with some delicious mouth watering tasty food started  loving this place hope to see you guys soon... You guys gonna rock for sure,I wish you guys a very good luck.", "author": "Phani C."}
