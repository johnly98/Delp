The ambiance/decor is nice, with warm wood accents throughout. After ordering at the counter, a number is provided, which you stick to a stand at your table and wait for your order to be fulfilled. For take out orders, the food is delivered at a counter on the side. The restaurant is generally clean, although I noticed it took quite a long time for the table next to mine to be cleaned after the customer left.\n\nI ordered take out the first time and had a sit down breakfast in my second visit. The take out took a long time, in part because the kitchen incorrectly plated it for eat-in; I saw the server sending my breakfast sandwich back into the kitchen; a few minutes later, it came back out wrapped for take out; despite the fact that the server was right there looking at the opening to the kitchen, she ignored it and busied herself with other chores, until she finally decided to bring my order to the take out counter. At the time, I strongly suspected that was my order sitting there, but was not 100% sure, otherwise I would have asked her sooner for my order.\n\nService during the second visit, when I ate in, was fine. My order was delivered with a smile.\n\nFor take out, I had the Anaheim Panini (scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, tomatoes, onions, avocado & cheddar on sourdough); it had good flavor, although the texture was not the most pleasant, probably because of the avocado that makes the sandwich a bit mushy. For eat-in, I ordered the Anaheim Scrambler (scrambled eggs, smoked bacon, tomatoes, green onions, cheddar & avocado served with harvest toast and fresh fruit); it was fine; in my personal opinion, I found the panini version more tasty.\n\nGreat convenient location, right on Market Street, close to the Montgomery BART station.", "author": "Tom S."}

Despite its deliberately quaint name, it's part of a chain of nearly 200 fast food-plus outlets across the country, all very studied in its oddly claustrophobic layout to ensure we all have maximum exposure to the calories they sell in mass quantities. They play in the same ballpark as Panera Bread, Specialty's, and Au Bon Pain, meaning it's a grade level above Mickey D's because they offer some table service, which basically means someone comes with your tray and takes your number. There's no genuine interest in finding out if the food meets a customer's satisfaction.\n\nIt didn't. I tried the $8.29 California Grille on whole grain harvest bread and supplemented their pre-packaged chips with a Caesar side salad for $1.49 more. The sandwich was a wet mess and overly seasoned to boot. It contained grilled zucchini, marinated artichoke hearts, roasted tomatoes, spinach pesto and provolone cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/1M9SO9s). There was very little flavor enhancement from the grilling, and I kept wondering if the staff even tastes any of the food they must prepare per directions from their corporate headquarters. My guess is no. I would trust the Korean ladies at any of the gazillion delis/mini-marts that actually know how to make a veggie sandwich.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...not much thought given to the execution here\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...focus appears to be on commerce, not comfort\nSERVICE - 2 stars...well...\nTOTAL - 2 stars...somebody put Corner Bakery in the corner", "author": "Ed U."}

I used to go to the CB right next to my work to get salads, sandwiches, and baked goods at least once a week.  When I moved back to the Bay and out of CB-territory, I was seriously having CB-withdrawals, especially when I would get all the CB emails reminding me of all the good eats.  \n\nAfter a few years of relocating (and waiting), CB finally has made its way to the Bay, with a few locations scattered in SF, Peninsula/South Bay, and East Bay. I decided to come to this CB location a few weeks ago for a late dinner bite on a Wednesday evening.  My first impression of CB was that it was pretty dead, which made sense because this CB is in the heart of the SF's FiDi and it was near store closing time.  I'm fairly certain that this place is pretty busy during lunch hours when all the SF office workers take their lunch break.  All of the workers were very nice and friendly. Of note, the bathroom requires a code for entry, probably to prevent random people (who aren't customers) from using it. \n\nI had the spicy Asian pork sandwich, which is a pretty new item on the CB menu. It was sweet, spicy, and juicy. The presentation was like that of an open faced sandwich, but the taste reminded me of a mix of a pulled pork and banh mi hybrid...sounds and looks like an interesting combination but it was tasty. I've had most of the other CB sandwiches (note, in SoCal), so the quality and taste of the spicy Asian pork sandwich is quite comparable.\n\nOverall, I had a good first time NorCal CB experience.

I don't really care - just don't call it something that it's not. They are selling a salad that is ostensibly fresh, and so the brown edges on the lettuce was not a good sign.\n\nThe pasta has been a mixed bag.  It's cooked to the right texture, which is harder than it might seem in a quick-service place.  And it has bacon.  That's where the goodness ends.  \n\nThere were three strips of 1/4\" thick x 1/2\"x2\" chicken in a pasta dish that came out right at $10. The protein portion is tiny, and the chicken feels watery, not very different from the precooked Tyson chicken breast that you can buy in Safeway. \n\nThe cream sauce (which, with the bacon - should make this a go-to meal) was watery and pooled on the bottom. The bacon's been hit or miss.  First time was soggy, second time crisp little squares.\n\nLastly, I have customized my order on two of my four visits.  It's never been right.  Items that I paid for have not been in the bag.  I don't know who the expediter is, but they are not doing their job. I blame myself in a big way, because I've only gotten my meals to go - and other places nearby have a high-enough standard of quality where I don't have to open and check every single thing to be sure it's as I ordered.\n\nAt Market Street Corner Bakery Cafe, evidently I do, cause they are so anxious to get you out they shove whatever's in front of them at you without checking for completeness and/or accuracy.\n\nThey belong in a mall food court, not on Market St. in San Francisco.", "author": "Rick C."}

I went online, (you can't order online, which is very annoying, actually - you have to call them, and sorry to them I know they're new in SF, but their phone people suck at their jobs. They have no idea what is on the menu, let alone asking what something on the menu actually is or how big it is or if things can be substituted. Not even the \"manager\" could tell me these things without putting me on hold to look at the menu herself) saw \"The Big Scrambler\" that sounded good for us. We wanted something completely unhealthy - a reward, if you will. Anyway, it says that it serves 8-10 people with an amass of scrambled eggs, either bacon or sausage, and croissants. On the phone, I asked specifically how much a serving was - we are a group of 20 people and some places have small portion sizes, while others have large ones - and was told it would easily serve 8-10. She went on to emphasize how each \"Big Scrambler\" would be at least two eggs per person, which, according to the serving size she had just told me, would be between 16-20 eggs scrambled. We maybe got 3-4 eggs scrambled with each of the two scramblers we ordered. \nApparently, the dish should be called \"The Big Meat, with some scrambles on the side\" because the meat was plentiful - honestly, like 20 pieces of either sausage or bacon, and then a ton of croissants for each dish, too. The HUGE issue I have is with the eggs. I don't know what any of it tasted like, I don't eat any of those things (well, I had a piece of croissant, which was okay - very buttery), so I can't attest to the taste of things, but people said it was good. My complete issue is with what I was told versus what we received. I'm going to try and add photos to show the unproportional amount of eggs to meat and croissant. \n\nI gave them two stars, they don't really deserve that. But I gave one for the food - which wasn't bad, I'm told - and one for the delivery woman who went back and brought more eggs for us. I hope she didn't get in trouble for that - because that's pretty much the only reason I'll even come back to this place as an individual. We will never order from here at my work again, needless to say. \n\nYes, they're new to SF, but portion sizes (and the actual dishes themselves) should have been worked out at other branches and then just continued here.

This place has that and even more. They have so many options for those things, and paninis and pastas. You can order ahead and beat the lunch rush.  The first time I went I got the panini/salad combo and got the meatball panini which was delicious! This time around I got the pasta/salad combo because I had to try their Mac and cheese. Not only was it fantastic, but they gave me a TON of pasta.  I thought it was going to be a tiny thing of pasta and a large salad but it was the other way around.  You get a lot of food for your money, the food is great, and it's in the perfect part of town to grab lunch without going too far from work. Can't wait to eat again!", "author": "Kristen T."}

I got a turkey club which was essentially a bacon and cheese sandwich with a piece of turkey and one tomato. I'm not one to write a review, but that is the biggest let down ever. I wasnt asking for something complex, but I guess it was a tall order for the kitchen staff today. Would really love if they would credit me back the $12 dollars I spent on this sorry excuse for a club sandwich. This was the nail in the coffin for me as there are dozens of better places to eat in the area. I would have had a better meal at McDonalds.", "author": "Ryan T."}

I ordered a breakfast panini with my friend and I had waited 30 minutes after she got her food before I asked about my order. We had already waited 15 minutes for her to get her sandwich. When I confronted the register about where my food was, the waitress proceeded to say \"yeahhhh we're really busy and kind of forgot about it and pushed it off.\" You don't say that to your customers. She then said \"we could refund you if you don't want it anymore.\" I'm hungry and anywhere else would take even longer. She didn't even apologize for the horrible service or the fact that the staff is inadequate in prepping food for their customers. I waited another 15 minutes before confronting them again, so I literally waited another hour and still didn't get my order. It took them another 15 minutes before I even got my order. A grilled sandwich with scrambled eggs does not take 1.5 hours to make. When I got my sandwich my panini was no longer crispy on the outside and it was completely soggy. Upon picking up my sandwich it was literally leaking everywhere and dripping all over the place. This place's food is mediocre and their staff and service is subpar. I definitely won't be coming here again.", "author": "Victoria C."}

I've tried their Southwestern - lettuce was turning, looked and tasted like salsa was dumped on it. I tried a side caesar in a combo - old looking lettuce and no dressing. \n\nSandwiches and soup are good. I had the Chicken Pomodoro panini - it was good, albeit a little oily for me. Turkey on Pretzel Roll was really hard. I guess I was expecting a soft pretzel. \n\nLemon Chicken Orzo soup is great. \n\nSpecialties is better for the same $. \n\nPer another review, my online order was sitting out all packed up.

The order took awhile to come out and when it finally did, they forgot to give me my baked goods. She went to grab it and that took forever too.

The order taker was very apologetic and ofer to comp the second order and a manger gave me a credit. We waited 30 mins for our order and only 1 scramble came. I went to inquire about the order and it led to the order taker complaining that her request to dbl the order was not followed, she came back and said they were making it and it would be a couple more minutes. 20 minutes later still no food was brought to our table. I then stood in line with other customers who were complaining about food delays, orders being incorrect demanding a refund. After 20 more mins I finally received my order. At this point I requested for the food to be take out and the manger ofer a refund, which she comped with the exception of my ice tea.\nThis location opened fairly recently but to have an order entered wrong, then made wrong, then take 60+ min to be corrected, is unacceptable. I will have to wait for a couple more months before I give this location another try.", "author": "Maggie Y."}
