It was labeled a salad but had just a couple tiny lettuce leaves. I did at least manage to get some ginger at the front which was a plus. \n\nAt the end of the line near the register, they had hand rolls for $2.25/piece.

One hand, I thought the rice was really innovative since they seemed to mix scallions and spam bits to jazz it up.  On the other hand, the spam on top was a bit lackluster since it wasn't glazed and/or crispy, just out of the can.\n\nPork Belly Bento: I really really really liked this bento box.  The pork belly was way better than you'd expect at a grab-and-go bento joint.  The meat was firm yet tender while the fat on top was silky smooth; all encased in an inviting glaze.  The cabbage underneath was a great pairing.  Loved the little sausages as a side dish, since pork with pork always works.  And the red colored fried tofu squares were an extra bonus protein.  Loved that they were acting like a vegan impostor to the pork belly.", "author": "Adam B."}

I got the Kinoko Gohan with Chicken from meal pal which I put as a time of 2:15-2:30 but when I got there at around 2:15, the place had already started cleaning up and didn't have anymore of what I had reserved. So that's how I ended up with the tofu and green beans.\n\nThe tofu was disappointing. It tasted like hot and sour soup mixed with tofu, which while could be good in some instances, didn't taste too good because there was so much rice and cabbage on the bottom. In all the bowl contained too much veggies and plain rice and not enough sauce or tofu. The green beans though were not too bad, they were rather tasty and had a nice dash of peanuts on top combined with a nice sauce.\n\nOverall, I would probably pass on choosing this place in the future, though it is possible that their meat items taste a lot better.

Comfort food that stays in your subconscious and eventually needs to be fed to your belly. They have one here, the $9.50 Oyako Don, which consists of chicken, scrambled egg, onions and mushrooms all simmered together and put over rice to steam (photo: http://bit.ly/1zflAVw). The term 'oyako don' actually means 'parent-child rice bowl' because chicken and egg exist in the same bowl.\n\nUsually the combo freaks me out because of the genocidal implications, but I make exception for this one dish since it can be tasty.

The other options they have are similar - bento bowls/boxes, which go for around $9, and other sushi bentos, all around $10-13. I think the chirashi is the best thing they have to offer in terms of quality. The bentos look pretty good and the sushi bentos look good too, although I don't feel like I would be okay with spending as much on those.\n\nWhat is surprising about this place is the quality of sushi and fish. It's pretty high for the financial district, for the price, and for the fact that it is a grab-and-go sushi place. I don't think there is a comparable grab-and-go sushi place around. So I can say with confidence that this will be my place for affordable sushi until something better pops up!", "author": "Junel S."}

I had spent at least 5 minutes gazing at the menu and at their offerings.\n\nThe chef was an elderly Japanese man, about 4'4\", and had a bandana wrapped around his head which suggested he was a sushi chef, but I couldn't be sure. The man dismissively replied that the sashimi was , \"fresh\", and that I , \"don't worry about how long it was out\" and scurried to tidy up the table and the offerings.\n\nHis English was quite good. I asked him how long the sashimi had been out in the 90 degree heat, and if the lack of refrigeration would have rendered the sashimi inedible?\nI touched the box, and it felt quite warm, as it was slowly heating up in the ambient temperature of 90 degree. He smiled as he looked at me, but did not answer.  I informed him that it would not be sanitary to serve such raw fish to the public, and if someone were to consume it, they would become sick.\n \nI asked him if it was normal for Tenmatsu to leave raw fish out from the refrigerator for extended periods of time, and if he had a Food handling certificate. I indicated that it would probably be in the best interest of the public health, and the restaurant to avoid serving sashimi that had been\nout of refrigeration for extended periods of time, especially on days where the temperature outdoors was in excess of 90 degrees.\n\nThe Japanese chef looked at me directly and said to me, in perfect English, while  smirking, \" leave this restaurant, and do not come back. You do not need this food, and I do not care what you think about this sashimi. Go, get out now\", he said forcefully.\n\nI was appalled. Really? \n\nI spoke to him  in a sincere way, and did not deserve the disrespect and contempt he showed me. The irony of the situation was that behind him on the wall, there was some poetry in chalk espousing \"compassion and loving attention to the food \" served there, according to a Japanese tradition. \n\nI suffer no fools, and sought out a manager nearby. I stood outside, shocked and dismayed by the rudeness of this crotchety curmudgeon. This rudeness was unacceptable and completely unwarranted.\n\nI have never been so rudely treated by an employee in all of my life. I did not feel welcomed by that man, and he took  pleasure at mistreating the customer.\n\nA Chinese store manager, Jennifer, came out, profusely apologized, but when asked why she would allow anyone to behave so miserably towards a customer, she offered two very \nlame excuses, \" his English is not so good\" and \" the hot weather must have made him short tempered\". Excuse me, Jennifer, but mistreatment of customers is never allowed, nor is excusable, Jennifer.\n\nWhy employ such a dullard, even if he was the Japanese face of a Chinese owned sushi restaurant? I do not care which nationality makes my food, as long as it is prepared well, and fresh. Quality doesn't depend on nationality, in my book.\n\nShe asked the bandana wearing louse to apologize. He smiled the saccharin smile and without making eye contact with me, and under his breath said, \"sorry\" AS HE TURNED AWAY and scampered back to the kitchen. I was shocked. Jennifer ran back to the kitchen and tried to have the chef return to apologize. He went with the , \" my English is not so good\" excuse, which when spoken in perfect English, like the hot sashimi, wasn't passing the smell test.\n\nWe were dealing with a 5 year old Japanese elder, apparently. I felt sorry that the manager had this louse on her payroll. Tenmatsu must never allow such disgusting displays of contempt for customers to permeate their business if they want to succeed in The City.\n\nTenmatsu can learn an important lesson in health codes and disciplining their staff, courtesy of the angry Japanese dwarf.\n\nPut on your listening ears, Willy NelsonSan, you are about to get an education:\n\nDON'T BE RUDE.

I actually threw out about a third of it because it tasted like supermarket sushi. The mochi was huge but I've tasted better. It was nice to try something new though. The man who ran the cash register was really nice.", "author": "Wendy L."}

I usually get one of the sushi options, fish curry or hamachi special meal. My coworkers tend to say their food is too salty, but I think it's the meat items they get. I've never had any overly salty issues from the fish items. Prices really vary, as you can get a hand roll or rice ball for $1-$2 or a full meal for $10-$12. The sushi prices vary in size and can range from $7-$13. Always a good lunch spot to grab something quickly - highly recommend it if you haven't been yet.", "author": "Shira O."}

They have bento boxes, donduri, curry, rice balls, hand rolls, and more. Everything is pretty affordable too, considering it's the financial district. The hand rolls are fresh, delicious and they aren't stingy with the filling. The rice balls are also good and only $1 each! The curry is a huge portion and I really enjoyed the fish, which I selected as my protein. However the sauce is just okay. I wish it was a little more sweet or spicy and I also think they should cut their veggies into smaller pieces. But a few of my coworkers love the sauce so it's definitely worth a try. \n\nI'll be back soon. I can't wait to try their donburi and handmade mochi! No seating inside so plan to take it to go.

The one issue I have with the rice bowls is that all the meat is stacked on the top and overall there is just too much rice.\n\nThey also have udon soup that you can order.

First impressions was that it was that the donburi was somewhat small for its price but the beef was really tender. I think the donburi itself can lighten up on the teriyaki sauce because the beef was drenched in it but, overall it was a good experience. I think 2 onigiri's can make a meal ($1.50/ea) but figured if I was at a store, why not try something they're more known for rather than just small things.", "author": "Judy C."}
