It's a bit inconspicuous from the street, but inside, it resembles a posh library, with literary drinks to match. The menu changes regularly, and on this occasion I got an Ellie Satler ($13) and Leopold Bloom ($12). Drinks are well prepared, and each has a distinct flavor. \n\nI wasn't a big fan of bourbon in one of drinks and asked to sub it for a scotch. Bartender said subs are not possible, because they use pre-made mixers for their drinks--- so they couldn't do it. Wow! A bit of a shocker here, but I guess it fits in with the theme and crowd of this place, which to me feels a bit mainstream and hits the crowds. \n\nAlso surprising, all though the place wasn't packed there wasn't anywhere to sit. Most of the tables were filled, or reserved, and I ended up having to stand by the bar. \n\nOverall, I think this is a solid bar to visit if you are in the area and want a uniqely themed, and changing menu. Call in advance and get a reservation for a table!", "author": "James S."}

It's been a long time since I went to a library, but I didn't know they had bouncers in the front now.\n\nI walked in and ordered a large pitcher of the house punch to share. It tasted delicious at first with its special blend of 11 herbs and spices, and it was the right mixture of strength and sweetness. But something was off, it smelled like something was burning. Oh no, was the local library on fire?\n\nLike a true hero I pulled out my phone to call 911, then I realized the smoky smell was coming from the pitcher itself. The secret ingredient was burnt wood, which they blended and mixed into the drink to give it the final smoky aftertaste. The drink was amazing up to this point, but I wouldn't recommend this one.

I really loved the ambiance of the place with the eccentric design. Novelas would not be complete without a library collection of books nicely arranged by color! I really enjoyed the rustic set up of the logs and wine barrels. Also, with the classiness of the chandeliers and zig zag flooring. There are chairs and lounging areas all over the place and the bar stool seating area. We opted for the high stools with the wine barrels serving as tables. \n\nI enjoyed my drink of the leopold bloom! Once our waitress had brought it out, I was mesmerized by the beautiful addition of the orange hibiscus flowers. The taste was divine with a great mixture of hibiscus gin, pineapple, mint, and grapefruit. It was more of a slushy consistency, but very refreshing and tasty. My best friend had the Sayuri, which was a nice blend of bourbon, miso, and plum bitters. The drinks were on the smaller side of portions and much pricer, but the serving and alcohol content were pretty good. \n\nWe also had the Novela meatballs and habanero hot wings. I thought the appetizers were okay. The meatballs were warm and drowsed with red marinara sauce. The hot wings weren't too hot and it was more of buffalo style wings. They also have weekly $1.25 oysters! We grabbed about a dozen that came with different sauces and nuances, they were pretty good. The staff was pretty friendly and our waitress had checked up on us frequently. I would recommend if your looking to make a quick stop for some drinks while in SF.", "author": "Christine N."}

For large groups, there are comfortable booths and you can make reservations for them. \n\nI ordered the Pippi Longstocking, a drink off the seasonal menu. It's a bourbon based drink with rhubarb, thyme, strawberry, tonic, and lemon in it. It was really good! I usually don't like drinks that taste too alcoholic and prefer fruity ones, but this one started off tasting strong and ended with a fruity flavor. Definitely an interesting drink to try!\n\nMy friends ordered a 32oz pitcher of the House Punch (Code Hero). I had a sip, and it was the opposite of my drink, where it started off sweet and ended with a strong aftertaste (a little more on the bitter side). They split it among 6 people, and each person had 1-2 cups. \n\nOverall, this place was really cool! I've never been to a themed bar before, and the environment was a nice place to sit and talk to friends. Their drinks are pretty strong but taste delicious!

This couple at the bar just left and we were going to take their seats. The bartender then told us, \"Get out of the seats, we need to move them to the back to the tables!\". We were pretty shocked by this reaction, and were really confused because there were a few other people at the bar who had chairs. He honestly could have informed us in a kinder and more polite manner. My boyfriend was really pissed about this so he left a note on the receipt, \"Ask your chair for a tip ;)\". Unfortunately it seems like the bartenders share their tips, for we wanted to give the bartender who served us our drinks a much higher one, but she wasn't the one who gave us the bill at the end. \n\nThis place is definitely a must to check out, and I really do want to go back there sometime.

I suggested Novela because I had them bookmarked on Yelp for ages and it was walking distance from the other bar we were at.  Everyone agreed and we had a great time.  I wish it was possible to get seated at the cuter tables without a reservation, but we eventually took over most of the large community table near the entrance.  \n\nI thought the service from the cocktail waitresses and the bartenders was great.  Really friendly and were working their butts off on a busy Saturday night.  I was indifferent with the bouncer (who honestly didn't believe my ID was me... give me a break bro, I'm 32 years old and I just retook my ID photo) and the hostesses.  The host/hostesses seemed to serve absolutely no purpose but to take up space by the door. \n\nTheir drink menu was popular.  All of my friends were ordering punches and cocktails, but they were all too sugary for me and I opted for my alcohol plain. \n\nI also loved the interior decor.  Was classy but not obnoxious.  I also think they did a really good job at keeping the bathrooms clean on a busy night. Loved the sink.", "author": "Jessica F."}

The aesthetic of this bar is amazing! \n\nThe service on the other hand was not so great. Upon arrival there was no bouncer so it was a walk in type of place. My party and I made reservations so we had a little corner with comfortable and stylish seating. The server had given us menus, but fail to realize that she gave us two menus with different drinks on it. Therefore, when ordering there was a confusion. Instead of looking at the wrong menu, which seemed like an older menu,  that she gave us she gave us an attitude and clearly stated that the items were not on the menu when clearly it was on one of the menu she gave us. \n\nThe drinks took quite sometime to reach us and the quality is average. \n\nThe ambience was intimate from the lighting.

We thought it tasted like soap or perfume, yuck.  At one point, it straight up tasted like alcohol.  My friend loved the sphere ice cube with the flower in it, but the drink just wasn't doing it.  Though the ice sphere was nice, it took up most of the glass so we felt a bit ripped off.  I was disappointed so I went up to the bar to see if I could try something else instead or have some changes made.\n\nThe bartender was very accommodating and listened to my preferences.  I wanted fruity but not too citrusy.  He recommended the Alice White ($12) and the Corina Springfield ($13).  The Corina Springfield was actually one of our initial choices.  He allowed me to have a sample before pouring a glass of the frozen slushee.  This one tasted much better and was sweeter.

Making a reservation was easy, and we were seated quickly upon arrival.  I LOVE libraries, and the library theme made it extra special.  \n\nAlthough Novela wasn't recommended for the food, we opted to go here anyway for the drinks.  Because this was a much anticipated night out, we ordered based on yelp and waitress recommendations.\n\n- Punch flight: I chose (you can pick 3), the house punch (whiskey), and the tequila and gin.  They were all really good, and my wife loved the tequila punch, but after the flight I ordered the house punch.  It had a \"smokey\" flavor, it was smooth, and the flavors mixed well.  The gin and tequila punch were also very smooth, but had more of a fruity taste.  If you're in a \"fruity mood\", I'd recommend getting one of these.\n- HIRAM BINGHAM - my wife loved this drink, and it was her drink all night.  I took a few sips, it was sweet, smooth, and had a unique taste. The whip cream on top was a bonus, and the way it tasted mixed with the drink was extra special.   Definitely a must try! \n- Mushroom Croquettes - I don't normally like mushrooms, but I loved these.  They were crisp, hot, and delicious.  The sauce on the side just topped it off!\n- Habanero Hot Wings - Nice kick, not overly fatty, and a little dry.  The flavor was good though, and the cream on the side offset the spicy.  Probably wouldn't order these again.\n- DIY Spanish Tomato Bread - This was probably my favorite.  The tomato jam was amazing, and I loved how it was \"DIY\" so you could choose how much jam to put on the bread, and sprinkle just the right amount of salt.  The jam isn't like a sweet jam, it's more like a tomato sauce.  It's yummy.  My only complaint was that there was a lot of jam left over after the bread was done.  We were offered more bread, but the bread was thick, and we didn't want to get overly full on bread.  Boo.  Can crackers be an option too?  We felt so wasteful.  \n- Truffle mac & cheese - we ordered this based on the waitress' recommendation because she said it was the \"most popular\".  I was thoroughly disappointed.  I'm pretty sure this wasn't supposed to be cold in the center, but ours was.  It was heavy, and very rich.  We couldn't finish it all, so instead we left our cold mac & cheese and opted for more drinks instead.\n\n-1 star because we lost our waitress a few times and had to wait a while to order more drinks and get refills on our waters.  And, because the truffle mac and cheese was cold and underwhelming.  I should note that we wanted to stay and drink and eat more, but we didn't want more of any food on the menu after our first round.  So, we kept drinking, and then had to leave because we didn't want to carry each other home.  I wish they had a few more small plates to mix up the variety.\n\nFinal thoughts?  I'll be back because we dug the modern decor, trendy vibe, and the music.  The drinks were unique, and I'll be honest, I kind of want to try every cocktail on the menu (on separate trips of course).  The staff were super friendly and welcoming, and the seating was nice, especially if you have a larger group.", "author": "Ashley S."}

The menu had symbols next to each cocktail describing whether the drink was fruity, frozen/slush, or stiff. Based on the icons, I ordered a Jay Gatsby, which was bourbon-based and very strong--perfect for kicking off the weekend, if you ask me. We sipped our drinks standing up because it seems like most tables and booths required reservations. After one drink, we got tired of standing and shouting to each other, and went to a different, quieter bar so we could sit down, as no seats opened up in the 45 minutes we were there.\n\nThe second time I came to Novela, I made a reservation for Saturday at 6pm because I was entertaining some out-of-town friends and wanted to make sure we could sit. Wow, the vibe on a Saturday was nothing like my first experience. The place was quiet and mellow. The only people there were seated at a table or booth, leaving the place feeling very spacious. Our waitress was extremely attentive, coming by to take our next order right when we finished our current drinks. This time, I had the Leopold Bloom first. Though gin-based, it didn't taste like a cocktail at all. It tasted more like a fruit punch. My second drink was the Ms. Moneypenny. If you like sour citrus drinks, this is perfect for you. Our group also ordered a hummus platter to share. It came with some pita and vegetables to eat with the hummus.\n\nI think Novela is a great place on the weekends if you like a low-key bar. Otherwise, come on a Friday night.", "author": "Yuki P."}

I searched high and low on Yelp for a good place to meet up for drinks and was so excited to find Novela! It was cute, you could make reservations for groups, and the literary themed drinks just pushed it over the edge in terms of amazingness. When we got there they seated us right away, the server was a bit slow about refilling waters and getting us drinks, but nothing super serious. All the drinks were really good and the ambiance was great. \nSadly about half way through the night, one of my friends pointed out a smell... having worked in restaurants in the past I immediately recognized it. It smelt like a dirty mop that they were using. I literally watched one of their staff mop up some stuff and the second the mop came near our table, it smelled SO bad. What was just a mild smell quickly became a severe smell. Then slowly it got a bit better, but literally we basically left and went to a nearby bar instead. Its a common mistake places make, using dirty mops, and when I walked over to the other side of the bar to go to the bathroom the smell was gone, but the entire other half of the restaurant was really, really bad. Maybe it was just a bad night, and if that is the case, I would highly recommend Novela to others, but it was really a big problem for our table and caused us to have to leave immediately.", "author": "Karen G."}

This is a great cocktail bar with a library theme to it with books all over the wall and little sections of the bar where you can gather your group of friends and all chat about life for a bit.  The joint itself is always packed during the week so make sure to grab a spot that will fit your group size as you will quickly run out of space. \n\nThe crowd the ventures here is a good mix of financial guys, tech guys, and general start up guys which is what you would believe to be common for any SF bar but this joint seems to bring this consistently where as other bars may be hit or miss based on the night. This is a solid/classy bar to hang out and the drink selections are plentiful so you will have no problem finding a solid drink. The bartenders are on point and extremely friendly without being snooty like some cocktail bars can be.

Okay, now that I've gotten through all the great things, let me talk about the one thing that caused me to give this a 1-star review. \n\nMy friend and I went in early October last year and had a great time. The total came out to about $36, and we split the bill. No worries, they can do it! Wrong. I was charged $18 on my card TWICE. My friend was charged $18 on her card once. I called them at least 4 to 5 times, but there was no response (I called during the day as well as during the night, but assumed that they would be more attentive in the afternoon or just as they opened because people were just starting to come in). \n\nI just feel like it wasn't fair for us to have to pay 1.5x the actual bill, and then not have anyone contact us back. I'm over it now, but saw the bar pop up on my Yelp feed and had to post a review. \n\nBuyer beware -- keep your receipts, check your bank statements! This may have just been a one time incident, but it can happen to anyone. \n\nIf I do end up going there again, which doesn't seem likely, I will definitely be paying with cash.", "author": "Swaja K."}

They allow so many people to stand in the well with their drinks that it's almost impossible to find the order \"line\" and the bartenders have absolutely no clue what's going on. \n\nOnce I was finally able to get a bartender's attention, I asked if there was simple syrup in one of the mixed drinks, a Violet Beauregard, and he responded with a tort, \"I don't know. We can't change our drinks, so whatever you see on the menu is what you get.\" I ordered the drink anyways and decided to risk having an overly sweet drink. Luckily, it wasn't too sweet! It was actually an excellent drink. But after my first sip, someone behind me knocked into my back and spilled half of my drink. \n\nNeither the guy nor his friends apologized for bumping into me and the bartender I told about the situation responded with zero emotion and did not remake my drink. \n\nSo unfortunate.", "author": "Jeff W."}

They were strong in flavor, which I love, and they came with a good jam. I didn't like the bread it came with though. The bread was super soft and on its own, would be good, but it doesn't pair well with cheese because it's too soft and just blends with the texture of cheese.

I lovvvveeee bars with a theme, so Novela was the right place for me. :) Novela is a book-themed cocktail bar, it is absolutely adorable because they have hundreds and hundreds of books along the walls and the books are all lit in different colors, making them look really really pretty. \n\nThey have a huge menu of cocktails, all of which are inspired by characters from specific books. Each cocktail is named after a character, says what book the character is from, and is made from ingredients what they believe the character would like or what destined the character! I found this extremely creative and cool. \n\nIf you would like to get a table for a group, I would recommend calling a few days in advance and booking that because they do get quite busy on weekends after 10:00.

You will LOVE it here if you are a book worm or just looking for an aesthetic place to get drinks. I came here on a Wednesday night with a group of ~8 people. There was plenty of seats at the bar and tables. They have a wide selection of drinks - with cocktails ranging from ~$10-$13 dollars. The bartender was friendly, quick and fast - with a remarkable memory!! She took like 6 drink orders at once. I was pretty surprised. I ordered from their main cocktail menu and ended up getting the \"Jade Whitestone\" for $10. It was a very sweet drink, I couldn't really taste the alcohol.. which I personally like! There were a bunch of other drinks that my friends also got - like the \"Jay Gatsby\", \"Curious George\", and \"Alice White\". The Curious George drink had a really weird consistency - because it does have bananas in it - but defiantly an interesting drink. I think they also have a different slushy special every night too, the day I went it was a \"Jack and Coke\" Slushy for $9!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-22", "description": "This bar is on my list of top 10 bars in SF. In my opinion, it's more of a lounge than a bar. \n\nNovela provides a classy atmosphere for people looking to have a conversation with their friends over a couple cocktails. It's located in the Financial District of San Francisco, so their clientele mostly consists of people working in the city. It seems like the ideal after hours place - the music is tasteful and not too loud, the atmosphere is pleasant and in a way romantic, and the drinks are worth the price you pay for them. \n\nYour average drink costs between $10-$13, which is standard for most bars in SF. They have a decent sized list of cocktails, and a section for Novela specialties. I usually order the Leopold Bloom, but have also tried the Jay Gatsby and the Ian Malcolm, both of which were good. They also have a good selection of wines and beers on tap. \n\nThe decor is definitely upscale - this bar reminds me of bars I've seen in some movies. The walls are lined with \"books\" which is a unique touch, and the lighting is dim but adequate. There are a lot of places to sit in groups, which makes it convenient if you're going with friends or coworkers. They also have some more personal areas, which is ideal for a date. This is definitely a good spot to start or end a date if you're looking for a classy bar that doesn't strain your wallet. \n\nThe clientele at this bar seem very well behaved - it seems like most of them work in the financial district and dress accordingly. This is definitely a bar where you'd feel out of place if you dressed too casually (sweats, sports attire). I've never seen anyone get rowdy or belligerent, which is nice if you're just trying to have a good time. \n\nOverall, the drinks are good, the decor is great, the restrooms are well maintained, and the bartenders are friendly and efficient. The only reason this bar gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because SF has some truly spectacular bars that set the bar pretty high. \n\nThis bar should definitely be on your list if you're looking to kick back after work, or enjoy drinks with your friends.", "author": "Ankit G."}

In fact, I wouldn't venture to say it's a bit overkill but it clearly gets away with it.  It has a lot going on decor wise and is the epitome of a trendy lounge. I dig the literary theme with the bookshelves on the wall and cocktails named after famous characters. On a side note it kind of gives off those, \"I bet lots of bachelorette party's go here\" vibes.\n\nThey have a big craft cocktail menu that's on the pricier side. Nothing too crazy but I was in the mood for something more casual and Novela isn't the place for that. One and done. Overall a solid choice. It was a little difficult to get bar service despite it not being very crowded but it seems like that isn't out of the ordinary for Novela. \n\nI probably wouldn't come back but if you're looking for something unique it's worth a shot.", "author": "Aaron B."}

You can make reservations or you can just walk in and take any table that doesn't have a reserved sign on it or hang out at the bar.

The decor was swanky-meets-library. Clean bathrooms. The music was good; they were playing a mixture of everything R&B, Alternative, Pop, Hip-hop, 2000's, etc. There was always staff walking by clearing tables of empty drinks for us and asking us if there was anything else we needed so that was nice, most places just ignore you and you have to demand some service. They make really good cocktails. We ordered the Jay Gatsby, Leemet, Leopold, & flights of Rum, Pisco, & Gin. They also offer beer, wine, & food.

I started with the Jay Gatsby ($11) which has bourbon, calisaya, nocino, amaretto, and islay scotch. Honestly I got this just because of the name. Excellent choice if you like a solid strong drink. Next I got the James Henry Trotter ($12) which has rye whiskey, white peach, grapefruit, egg white, hellfire bitters, and mint. This is a good drink if you are feeling fruity.

I came here on a Tuesday and since it's located in the Financial District the crowd is a little older (I'm early 20's) and most people were in their work clothes - suits, etc. \n\nThe drinks are VERY strong. I was a little disappointed because I like bars with creative mixologists, and I did ask for a custom drink with certain flavors but the bartender didn't seem in the mood to come up with something. She instead suggested the vodka punch and told me it's a fruity, light drink but even then I thought it was quite strong! So be prepared if you're a lightweight. Unisex bathrooms were very clean and lots of space to lounge around. Ambient lighting - light enough to see other people but not too light to create that unattractive fluorescent glow (just an FYI for those first date people). \n\n4 drinks was $57 w/o tip.", "author": "Allison L."}

Yelp lead us to Novela, and we were all very pleased with the recommendation!\n\nEnter Novela. It was a tame Tuesday night, and we were looking for some chill drinks at a respectable space. Novela is pretty dark with a lounge-y feel for after work hangouts. Yelp told me that their punches were pretty good, but the boys got some redbull vodkas--basic. I decided to get us some Negroni (where my gin lovers at) because of SF Negroni Week! They had three drink choices, and we settled with two Negroni Punches and one Negroni Bitter. The bartenders that night were ALL on point and very classy. Shoutout to the super pro bartender lady who had rad tattoos and a girlcrush-worthy septum piercing! She was kind enough to educate us on the ingredients of the Negroni (gin, vermouth, campari, and a twist) and how they made their Punch and Bitter. \n\nShoutout to the male bartender that night as well for being so friendly, sweet, and caring for our crew. I tip my hat off to bartenders who know their shit, but keep their egos in check. Yes, the whole world knows that y'all know your alcohol, but it's even more admirable when you can educate and spread the wealth of knowledge. Novela is your place if you want sincere bartenders and beautifully crafted cocktails. \n\nI see that people complained about pricing. No doubt drinks are well over $10 a glass, but you're getting hand-crafted pieces of art, so no shit it's gonna cost a pretty penny. Plus, don't complain because you're in FiDi. If you're looking for $2 pints and cheap well drinks, you can walk to another bar a few feet away. I can't wait to come back to the book-theme'd Novela.

The glowing colors are a great contrast to the large black windows and white washed brick walls on the left. The bar itself is a wall of glass with a yellow under glow. Everything is just so classy. \n\nDefinitely try out their house \"punches\" which rotate seasonally and grab a pitcher to share with friends. Each pitcher serves about 6 people for only 4x the cost of a glass. They also have their own signature cocktails that are named after story characters (how cute?!). I've also been told that Novela has the best greyhounds in SF from a random guy who took a lyft with me. \n\nThe crowd ranges from super dressy to more low key casual. It's definitely fun to just people watch. Beware though that the main bar is one sided and so it's get really really crowded there. There's a small bar also in the back but it's only about 5 ft wide. If you're in front of the bar area or near the communal table, you'll feel a little like you're in a can of sardines. So I would highly suggest grabbing reservations, especially if you plan on showing up prior to 12.

It comes in a cute rounded glass with a stem (not a martini glass, don't know what it's called) as opposed to the short Don Draper glass you were probably expecting. Perhaps it's Novela trying to move us away from outdated notions of manliness though, and so that's great.\n\nThe ambience is really nice, but make a reservation (you can make them through Yelp) if you're on a date and/or hoping to get a table. It can get very crowded on weekend nights and starts to feel more like the busy bars/clubs you were hoping to avoid rather than a quieter literary-themed lounge.\n\nA star comes off for playing Warriors games.

That happens though, so I'm not that upset about it and was willing to overlook. The part that really made me salty is that the bartender (larger blondish woman) was definitely trying to scam me on paying for drinks. She overcharged me $1.50 for my drink (I paid with cash), and when I mentioned to her that it was only $11, she claimed that it was extra because of tax. I am pretty astute at math, so I know that sales tax is not 15%, but fine. When I asked for a receipt, since I paid cash, she claimed the machine was broken. This is incomprehensible to me, as she brought out bills for other customers. In the end, I decided that since she wanted to overcharge me and refused to take ownership of that, I wouldn't leave the $4 tip I had intended. I am a former bartender (through college), so I know how stressful it is, thus I tip well. It left a truly terrible taste in my mouth (besides the fact that I could barely taste the alcohol in my punch), but I wanted to mention this in case this particular bartender was actually stealing money. I have worked at bars before and tax is ALWAYS incorporated into the written price. I didn't feel like arguing with her because I was trying to have a good time with my sister, but this was appalling. For $1.50, I will be sure to never return, and I was even planning to rent out the whole venue for a holiday party. They pretty much lost several hundreds of dollars for one bartender's greed. \n\nMost importantly, if you don't print a receipt, there's no record of theft, as I suspect she was doing.

My friends were late and I noticed the the tables were never completely occupied when I finally left with my 2 friends at 5:45PM. Lesson learned: Make reservations in advance for a bar?!\n\nWhat I did because I was annoyed and disappointed with the hostess: Spoke with the manager, Suzie. She apologized and mentioned that the hostess was new. We actually could have been put on a wait list. Fancy that. We didn't stay. Instead, we went to another bar for drinks and food nearby. We weren't disappointed and found a comfortable place to talk while enjoying our over-priced tasty drinks. \n\nMoral of the story: Maybe we will try Novela once the hostess and staff are properly trained, but I highly doubt it because there are so many other great bars in the city.", "author": "Michon P."}

Not sure why she had to wait until someone had  to tell her that we needed to order.\n\nThe people who work here are not the friendliest.  When we came in, the hostess was not present and I had to ask one of the servers where we could sit.  She said to find something that's not reserved, knowing full well that everything but the bar and communal table was reserved.  She could have been more informative and helpful.  Luckily, a couple left the communal table, so we grabbed the seats right away.  When we finally got to order, things were fine.  We got to talking to the couple across from us though, and they told us about their weird experience ordering drinks.  When they ordered their drinks, the bill came before the drinks. They were given the bill 5 minutes after ordering, but their wine and cocktail got there 5 minutes later. Wow.  I'm just flabbergasted by that. \n\nNeedless to say, we will not be going back to this place. You go to restaurants and bars for the ambiance and service, not just for the food and drinks they offer.

Which also means you don't wanna order the wrong one.  They have some favorites with familiar names like Gatsby and Finch, but the one you really want is the Princess Leia, which might be my favorite \"girly\" drink yet - mildly tropical, with a rather wonderful creamy sweet write foam on top.  Definitely has sugar in there, but it's not cloying. My guess is that it's not that stiff because it goes down so easy.\n\nUPDATE: I should've guessed that the Star Wars-themed drink was temporary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-25", "description": "Wonderful concept bar in SOMA, close to Yerba Buena, the Westfield Mall and Moscone Center (which is why it's soooo expensive). Novela really embraces their literary concept, from the decor - the books on the wall to the little antique book catalog that greets you when you walk in - to the adorable menu named after literary characters and authors.\n\nNovela is big, open and air-y, with a good number of chairs, though it gets crowded during Happy Hours and when there are conferences/events nearby (which is, like, all the damn time). The best time to go is on the weekend before 8pm. \n\nOne of the best/worst things about Novela is that you can reserve the seating lounges in advance (which I can see some patrons being annoyed by, since the \"reserved\" signs make you feel a little unwelcome). However, they did allow me and my friends to sit in one of the reserved lounges until the people who reserved it showed up, which was nice. \n\nThe cocktails are phenomenal. Really creative, tasty, perhaps a bit too sugar-y and certainly not anything a brown spirits purist would appreciate. But goddamn, they are so expensive. Most cocktails run $11-$13 PLUS tax PLUS Healthy SF fee! I personally really dislike bars/restaurants that charge you the Healthy SF tax. I'd rather they just bake it into the price. It almost feels like they want you to blame Healthy SF for the increased price rather than the fact that the employer isn't paying for it. Healthy SF is an amazing program so I have nothing but love for it, but I don't like the restaurants that almost make you feel bad for it.\n\nIn any case, a cocktail that says $13 on the menu turns out to be $14.57. But you are paying the price for a talented mixologist to make you a tasty drink, for the lovely decor and the bright setting, central location and creative concept. Worth it? I thought so. Would you get completely sh*t-faced here? Only if you had tech money. \n\nOh, and for people who complain that it takes too long to get a drink - gurl, you are ordering a cocktail with multiple ingredients. If you want a quick fix, order a beer or a whiskey and coke, or walk over to the Irish bar down the street. Don't come to a cocktail bar and complain that it takes too long for a cocktail. There's a reason they take long to make. And I gotta say, Novela makes them right.", "author": "Logan The H."}

Lots of chairs/sofas and tables. The location is near work, yeah so fifth star. But, Novela is also easy to find, is near parking lots (drink responsibly, yo), and is near all types of mass transits. Note there are many bars nearby if want to switch away from here too - like when the place is crowded.\n\nThe cocktails are seasonal and the menu changes in the Spring and late Fall. Drinks are pricey but quite good and you'll find something based on your alcohol preference. Something strong is the Hemingway's Punch which uses 3 whiskeys. Other punches I liked are the gin or tequila base though those don't seem as strong. If enough people, get a pitcher as that's the best bang for your buck (with ice it's 8-12 pours).

I ordered the \"Mary Poppins,\" which is made with apple spirit, cherry wine, ginger liqueur, clove bitters, maple syrup, soda and lemon.

Neither is Jamie W., so we were surprised to find ourselves at Novela one evening after having burgers and fries at Sliders in the Castro. It was a Sunday just after sunset, and as we walked in, it was not as crazy-busy as I have seen it passing by on a weeknight. We secured two of the high-backed chairs in the area opposite the bar (photo: http://bit.ly/GNmoqG). The house music was so loud it was hard to concentrate on the small \"Cocktails with Character\" menu (photo: http://bit.ly/GNmqPv). It took us a while to figure out a waitress was not coming, so Jamie got all gentlemanly on me and ordered our drinks at the bar. The heady decor is meant to evoke the library of some manor (photo: http://bit.ly/GWzUJo).\n\nBut mind you, this is a hipster's version of a library since the books are fake and so are a lot of the trend-obsessed customers. These are people who live by their smartphones and cannot read anything more than a glowing four-inch screen will allow before having the need to text someone back right away. The female bartenders, on the other hand, are professional and hard-working, tolerating all sorts of pomposity from the suits who feel entitled to step in front of others to get their drinks. Our drinks have finally arrived. Mine was the $11 Huckleberry Finn, a slightly sweetened tumbler of Aged Rum, Grapefruit Marmalade, Angostura Bitters, Tonic and Lemon. Jamie's was the $11 Sherlock Holmes, oddly named since it contained atypical non-British ingredients like Kappa Pisco and Zucca Amaro.\n\nThere was also Laird's Apple Brandy, Birch Beer and Lime to complete the concoction (photo: http://bit.ly/1gdV0Cl). We downed those quite swiftly, so it was my turn to go to the bar. I decided we would share a flight of their House Punches, three come for $14. The red pepper-accented Tequila and the ginger-habanero-twisted Cognac ones were tasty, but their signature punch turned out to be the best, Hemingway's \"Code Hero\" which features three whiskeys along with Pimm's, Earl Grey, Grapefruit, Maraschino and Lime (photo: http://bit.ly/1bq5fxs). It made us want a pitcher of that one in particular. But alas, we knew our limits. Besides, to quote Katharine Hepburn when asked if she ever gets drunk or high, she snapped back, \"Cold sober, I find myself absolutely fascinating.\"\n\nCOCKTAILS - 4 stars...intoxicating punches beat our the literary cocktails\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...lots of poseurs and awfully loud despite the supposed library setting\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...no waitresses but the bartenders deliver the goods\nTOTAL - 4 stars...worthwhile for the Hemingway punch...a pitcher please", "author": "Ed U."}

At the height of my liberation period, I spent every Friday night at Fluid: bowing to the porcelain throne, sprawled out on the coach or on the sidewalk outside bowing to the concrete floor. Hot mess aside, Fluid was like home sweet home to me.\n\nAlthough I was sad that Fluid closed last year, I was ecstatic to hear that they would be doing a major renovation and changing it from a club to a bar/lounge. \n\nAs we walked into Novela for the soft opening yesterday (official grand opening is today), my jaw dropped to the ground as if I saw Channing Tatum in a thong.\n\nWow. Just wow.\n\nA stunning transformation to a library themed bar, Novela boosts two bars with plenty of seating on plushy vintage furnishings, textured ceiling with chandeliers encased in metal spheres and an chic bookshelf stocked with illuminated colored books. I expected nothing less from the people behind Gitane and Maven; two of the most beautifully designed restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nNovela's artisan cocktails ($10-$12) are named after characters from American Classics like The Great Gasby, The Catcher in the Rye, and Huckleberry Fin. They also have handcrafted punches on tap that you can order by a drink ($10), by a flight ($13) or by the pitcher ($45). I wish they had happy hour specials. \n\n*Cocktail menu: http://bit.ly/116VBs1\n*Punch menu: http://bit.ly/11trtqF\n\nNovela has one attractive staff and very smiley at that.

Talk about having a good memory when I can't even remember what I ate for lunch yesterday.  \n\nMr. NSS gave me the evil eye when I wanted to order a pitcher of punch (yes, ALL for myself) so I instead opted for their cocktails. Both the Leopold Bloom ($10): http://bit.ly/11HiVTa and Daisy Buchanan ($10): http://bit.ly/10NjWUY were beautifully made cocktails by Ernon. The sophisticated Daisy Buchanan was my favorite because the egg foam gave the cocktail a creamy finish. \n\nI hope they have bar bites in the future even though if it's just charcuterie and cheese platters as it would make it a great date place to come for pre-dinner snack and drinks. \n\nOhh, and the restrooms.

Seriously, how can you go wrong with a place that serves Elizabeth Bennet and Emma Woodhouse drinks?! As a girl who has read her Jane Austen books more times than she can count, Novela has defaulted to one of my favorite bars in the city. I just can't believe it's taken me so long to finally visit.\n\nYou can't check out the books, but you can certainly check out all the DRINKS. The PUNCH FLIGHTS will probably get you the most bang for your buck; it's almost like getting three drinks for the price of one. The Fall Harvest, Pisco, and Gin + Sake punches were all delicious and packed a...punch! For a drink that's sweet but still has a lot spice, just like my favorite Bennet sister, I would try the ELIZABETH BENNET. For the fans of more \"stiff and spirituous\" drinks, you can go the route of scotch with JAY GATSBY. Novela's menu provides a handy key to guide you towards drinks which fit your taste palate. \n\nI absolutely love, looove, LOVE the interior of Novela. The lighting and ambiance is great for a date or group gatherings. As the crowds come in later in the night, it does get more noisy. However, I had no problem talking with friends in the couch corner. \n\nIf you plan on coming with a larger group, you can call or use Yelp to create a reservation--highly recommended if you come during the evening hours as it does get super crowded. For groups you can grab a large table or sit in the couches by the corner. Ask for the loungey corner if possible! The couches and pillows are very comfortable and cozy.\n\nThe SERVICE at Novela is pretty attentive. The drinks came out quickly and we never had to flag down our server. Just double check your bill at the end because they added an extra flight but left out a cocktail on our receipt.\n\nIf you are curious, yes those are REAL BOOKS on the shelves.", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

I don't understand why the main bar doesn't wrap around. It leads to very long wait times for drinks that are too labor-intensive. I just realized that there's a back bar that is not as crowded if you walk straight, past the main bar.\n\nThere is a decent amount of seating but it can still get crowded later in the evening on weekends.

Always something a tad different, a glass won't break your bank account. Read: it's less that $15 per drink, a steal in SF.\n\nGetting a seat during happy hour can prove tricky since Novela takes reservations.

The drinks weren't very strong and again, I wasn't a huge fan, but some of them were better than others.\n\nService was good.

We had been at Local Edition (vintage newspaper theme) right before coming here, so this seamlessly ended up being the next logical destination. A sophisticated night, indeed.\n\nAlthough there were no available seats/tables when we arrived, there was enough space in the bar area to comfortably enjoy our time here. The staff was welcoming and even the bouncer made conversation.\n\nI had the Miss Moneypenny (from the \"Cocktails with Character\" selection) and then Hemingway's \"Code Hero\" Punch (this is their handcrafted punch on tap), which features 3 whiskeys, earl grey, grapefruit, lemon, etc. I appreciated how their punch is made from fresh ingredients with the fruit being \"carefully zested, juiced, blended, and strained by hand\" (yes, I got that from their website). Almost makes me feel like I was juicing. Miss Moneypenny is vodka based and included pear and honey.

The books lit under multi-colored lights comes off with a fresh and energizing vibe, unlike Library Bar (both SF and LA) which I personally find a bit too literal and almost geeky.  \n\nDrinks were excellent and matched the novelty of the ambiance.  The cocktails are creatively named after characters and all have a complex array of ingredients (and good alcohol, I might add); it's a little bit intellectual in that it's been well thought-out and you need some time to ponder over the selection.  \n\nRoy Hobbs (bourbon, rhubarb tea, cocchi americano, amargo chuncho): on point and sophisticated.  It reminded me of the Negroni, only much better.\n\nDread Pirate Roberts (sta. teresa claro rum, diplomatico rum, miller amaro, strawberry,  balsamic, cherry bitters, absinthe, lemon): admittedly slightly more girly than the Roy Hobbs--I bet strawberry was the culprit--but still very good, with notable overtones blended into the dark rum.  It's served in a metal Moscow Mule-esque mug and it's funny that you can't even really see your drink because it's under a pile of shaved ice.  (Yeah, adult shaved ice....)\n\nInterestingly, the drinks took awhile to make, which is probably why they were so good: not like your average bar where they just whip up stuff without much attention or precision.\n\nThe downside is that it's rather crowded and noisy on weekends, so it can be difficult to find seating.

After ending up here with a group over a year later, I was pleasantly surprised, and now it is on the regular post-work rotation.\n\nThe drink that won me over was the Leopold Bloom. Hibiscus infused gin, which is made in house, gives it a wonderful blood red hue. Served over crushed ice, a few of these is a great way of taking the edge off at the end of the day. Given the tasteful decor and location, they are also reasonably priced. The only complaint on the interior decorating is some of the sitting area feels too open and underutilized. There is almost an uncomfortable amount of distance between people.\n\nThe friendliness factor is still a little hit or miss with the bartenders.

While the cocktails are a little pricey, I loved the unique names and they definitely do not skimp on the alcohol, let me tell you. Most of the tables were reserved so I'd reserve a table if you have a large party. I also liked that you could actually have conversations here and you weren't shouting over the music to talk.

And no, it's not a dive bar!!\n\nStopped by Novela after a big meeting and I couldn't have asked for a more perfect place. A colleague called in advance to reserve a few tables, and upon sitting down, we had a server ready and willing to take our drink orders. \n\nNovela offers a great variety of cocktails, from their house made punch, along with their seasonal punches, as well as their own crafted specialty cocktails with character like \"Juilet Capulet, Romeo montague, Alexander Supertramp, etc.,  For those who are not as adventurous with their cocktails, wines by the glass (and bottle) are available as well as bottled and draft beers. Unfortunately, there are no Happy Hour prices at Novela, but drinks are moderately priced from $5 to $13. \n\nThe ambiance is cool and sophisticated without being stuffy. I love all the details from the lighting to the fixtures to the wall paper inside the bathroom!\n\nI'd imagine Novela is packed on the weekends, so your best bet is to come right after work on weekdays.

Literature-named cocktails area cool concept but not sure if they are analogous to the fictional works they are named after. They are known for punch bowl flights. I've tried the Dorian Grey, Mary Poppins, Miss Honey Penny and the Black Punch. All were decent but did not leave me wanting more. Dorian Gray was my favorite. Mary Poppins and Miss Honey Penny tasted fairly watered down. Black Punch was very interesting because the molasses made it almost taste like BBQ sauce.

What ever happen to the briefcase anyway? Are they only used in Asian TV  dramas and the CIA?\n\nThe space has got a nice oval shaped design around the main bar in the middle. On either side, there is comfy seating, sort of a reading parlor decor with faux wing-backed chairs to fit the Novela theme, rather than a slick modern lounge motif of most new lounges. \n\nThere is also a small back room and bar, for special events and private gatherings, which I was attending. \n\nThe Literary theme is a little bit off in the drink menu design. Huckleberry Finn Rum drink? Why not Whiskey or Rye? Shouldn't a Rum drink be named Captain Blackbeard or Robinson Crusoe? Maybe even Moby Dick? \n\nI think the Drink Menu designer was watching those Spanish language Novelas on Telemundo, not reading any classic literature.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

Figured we could hop around on Mission to have some fun.  Wrong!  We walked into Novela and stayed here.  For nearly 4 hours!  Loved every minute.  The hostess/lovely petite woman at the door just told us to grab a seat wherever, as it was first come first serve.  After roaming around the bar, literally, two seats opened up.  Yay!\n\nThe place was poppin' as soon as we walked in.  High ceilings with funky light fixtures, pseudo library setting (Novela, get it?) with lit up faux books on the walls.  Lounge-type seating all around with the bar as the center of attention right smack dab in the middle, as it should have been because the bartenders were all gorgeous as was the bar structure itself.  Heck, even the drink fixin's were pretty to look at.  On display were things like mint, zested oranges & lemons, mmm... I could just smell the freshness of ingredients of their crafty cocktails... and I hadn't even had one yet!\n\nSpeaking of crafty cocktails, they are the reason I chose to come here in the first place (okay maybe I thought the name was cool, too).  I couldn't decide which I wanted, so I got a flight of punch for $14.  Generous flight amounts by the way.  Between the Pisco, the Gin, the Cacha\u00e7a punch, I honestly was in love with all three.  So in love that I wanted more more more.  So I shared a pitcher ($45) of Pisco with my galpal (her fave from my flight).  FYI on the menu it says this so called pitcher serves 4-6... Wrong!  It served us 9 glasses.  Or was it 10?  I don't remember.  See what I'm talking about...\n\nService could not have been any better.  I didn't catch my bartenders' names, and my receipt was cutoff a bit, but it could be Suzie V. (? the one with the cool tattoos) and the other was Dimas O.  Loved them both, as they were so attentive and genuinely nice, never rushing us when making orders.\n\nI loved Novela so much I came back the next night, and the Pisco did not disappoint!

So, what's a little premeditated planning if you can avoid the ridiculous line that starts forming during prime nightlife hours?\n\nPro tip #2, don't be afraid to order the punch pitchers, even if there are just two of you. Unlike some of the other bars/lounges in the city, the folks at Novela don't mind if you order one of these, despite these being designed to serve four - six. Now, if you want variety, sure, grab some individual cocktails - but if you don't mind sticking to just one or two, these are MUCH better value for your money.\n\nSo, a solid 3.5 stars for a sweet venue, with pretty good drinks. Not quite a four because our punch was actually on the too-sweet side, and also because the place gets unbelievably packed once 11 or so rolls around.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Aside from the usual bar caveats (i.e.: the bar itself is too high to be accessible), there are plenty of accessible tables throughout the venue. If you show up early enough (before 10pm), moving around the place isn't really a problem.

So if Spanish is your only language then you may be in luck.\n\nI use the word trendy because you walk in a dimly lit room decorated with modern looking furniture and fake books all along the wall for decorations.

The seating area is intimate and cozy for having deep conversations or to just kick-back.  I do recommend that on busy nights, you should get there early as the seating does fill up rather quickly.  The room can feel tight, but it also allows you to get to know your \"neighbor,\" in which you'll probably start a conversation on Gatsby or Shakespeare or just what you're drinking.

Walk in and grab one of the large tables up front, or keep going for seats at the bar or tables in the back in a fairly tucked-away space.\n\nYou want dark woods and slate grays and all those other colors that tell you it's ok to be in here on a Monday drinking? Novela has that. Nice servers who will bring those drinks to you, even though it may not be particularly quickly? Got that as well.*\n\nBut what they really have are tasty cocktails for a reasonable (for the neighborhood) price. I particular suggest the punch flights; these are smaller glasses than the chalice of punch you can get of a single punch flavor, but are basically sugary, colorful punches with different types of alcohol in them. There's a gin punch, a tequila punch, one that tasted like suntan lotion but in a good way, and of course, owing to the bar's writerly theme, a Hemingway punch with three types of whiskey in it (which was particular delicious). You can get a flight of 3 for 14, and I think 6 for 24 (or some small discount, don't quote me on the exact price). They're worth doing, even if some aren't fantastic.\n\nThere's also a full bar, and a small, eclectic bourbon selection that isn't just the straight B's (Booker, Blanton's, Bulleit, Baker, Beam and Knob Creek (almost all B's)) and includes interesting ones like Johnny Drum and Breaking and Entering.\n\nAll in all, this is a really, really welcome addition to the neighborhood and likely to be too crowded from being really good for me to get a seat here for happy hour.

My Atticus Finch was perfectly balanced while my friend's lighter Leopold Bloom was a pleasant and easy sipper.  Feeling adventurous, I had the bartender make me his take on a Meat Hook using Lagavulin 16 year - solid, though slightly heavy-handed on the sweet vermouth and not nearly enough of the scotch as evidenced by the weak peat on the nose.\n\nOverall, a great new cocktail bar in SOMA and a top spot to imbibe with friends.", "author": "Eric F."}

So wait times were a little long, but that's to be expected, so I will put up another star as soon as I've attended during normal business hours.\n\nAlright. Let's begin, shall we?\n\nNovela joins the ranks of other hip, hand crafted cocktail bars becoming so prevalent these days- see Bourbon & Branch, Local Edition. You all know the stops. They are dimly lit, the men sport handle bar mustaches, and I learn to pace myself, not by choice, but because the wait my hand crafted cocktail tells me so.\n\nBut what sets this new bar apart is the atmosphere. The bar is fairly large for a San Francisco bar, which means I had plenty of walking and sitting room to enjoy my drinks. The music is on point, Of Monsters and Men, Arcade Fire, all things which my spotify would play if I had company over and had to hide all my bad music choices.\n\nThe walls are decorated with books which change colors and pulse, art of Moby Dick, and all the drinks are based off characters from classic literature.\n\nNow, here is my only problem, and all my friends agree...the drinks, at least their specials, are strong.\n\nNow I know, I know, I drink with the best of them, all my girlfriends are whiskey drinkers, but these weren't pleasant to sip, every special we ordered was gross.\n\nThe Holden Caulfield, for example, tasted like just straight up bourbon. Which is fine, but if I were paying for this drink I would be mighty angry. Phonies.\n\nI would absolutely come back, but would order the old Jameson & Ginger, and skip their craft drinks.", "author": "Jenny U."}

With tables, sofas, and chairs lining the edges of the place, Novela is comfortable to walk around and stand in with a bar in the middle so it's easy to walk through people to get another drink.\n\nLoving the library-esque theme of the place with vintage books living the walls in little bookshelves all the way to the ceilings, and they weren't fake books either! These were real books, hardcopies with yellowing pages that smelled like a classic library..not that I smelled it of course, but if I had, I anticipate that's what I would have smelled.\n\nThe cocktail menu is short and sweet to the point, with a backside for charcuterie and other small bites. I loved how the cocktail drinks were named after literary characters such as Romeo Montague, Jay Gatsby, etc. but I honestly can't recall what my drink was..it was definitely a literary character from a book that I've never read :(\n\nI did notice, however, that my drink and my boyfriend's Jay Gatsby had an excessive amount of ice...mine was like a snowcone in a glass which made it heard to drink throughout the night.\n\nLove this place!", "author": "Zoe H."}

We only got to try two pitchers of alcohol here: the Hero punch and the Cognac punch.\n\nLet me start it off by saying the punch pitchers are a pretty good deal, especially if you come with a group.  However, that's where the fun ends as you reminisce about drinking jungle juice when you were in college.\n\nCognac punch: You might as well name it Con-yack.  This drink tastes pretty nasty. The habanero spice takes some of the bite away but you'll be left with a strange flavor in your mouth.\n\nHero punch: This punch didnt taste great, but it tastes awesome compared to the cognac punch.  I'd recommend you either stick to this or order pitchers of their sangria instead.\n\nThe good part about each pitcher is that it fills about 9 full cups so you get a lot of bang for your buck.\n\nThey turn on the lights and off the music at around 1:30am, so beware if you order a little bit before that time as you'll feel forced to down your drinks.\n\n3 solid stars.", "author": "Kelvin C."}

The ambiance was great as well as the decor. Large couches that make you feel you're in VIP area. Walls were filled with fake books and lighted up on the back portion of it. The lighting was dim with candles in a glass cup on the tables. It had that Gatsby feel to it in a way. Or more like the Rat pack hangout with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin or Sammy D. Love that era! Waitresses were attentive with my friend and I. The menu had that Gatsby vibe to it. \n\nCocktails with character? hmmm kinda comes off as they stole it from Tecate... \n\nMy friend and I arrived early enough to get a table and we were sat down right away! My friend started with the punch.... Kinda soft for my taste. I ordered the Jay Gatsby which consisted of bourbon, calisaya, amaretto, nocino and Islay scotch. Strong drink! A must try if you love bourbon! A good drink to pace yourself and socialize. Then I ordered the Santiago and that consisted of tequila reposado, mezcal, yellow chartreuse, coffee liqueur, habanero bitters, and salt. This was a very strong drink. You could feel it going down your throat as you swallowed it haha. Sore throat? Order this! Cost of drinks were average price.\n\nAfter pacing myself I had to make a stop at the restroom. The wall paper inside was pretty cool. Legs, legs and legs was the wallpaper theme but in a cool design. Kind of reminded me of the leg from \"a christmas story.\" Ralphie would have loved this! They had a little shelf by the urinal to place your drink! Awesome! Where you wash your hands was shared with the ladies. Can be a little annoying when all you're trying to do is wash your hands and the ladies are occupying all the space by applying any sort of make up or facial products. I understand ladies have to look nice but a shared vicinity is not a great idea at a place like this. I'm just trying to wash my hands, a lot of people just get in the way hogging up the mirror haha\n\nThe bar seemed packed but I didn't experience the wait of time to get a drink. The music was good for the most part. Not much dancing space. I'd go again just to sit down and grab a drink or two on a low key night. Give this place a try. \n\nThe only bad part is that well... The crowd could have been more diverse. It was at first, but by the end of the night it was not the case. \n\nTip: get there early to grab a couch or table.

As a former English major, I am obviously drawn to the theme of this bar. Drinks are cleverly named after literary characters, the menu is divided by \"chapters\", and bookshelves line the walls! What an English nerd's dream.\n\nMy group headed over at around 8:30 on a Friday night, expecting it to be impossible to get a table or seats. We got super lucky and saw a group leaving as soon as we got in, so we nabbed a table! A server warned us that a group might be coming for a reservation, but later told us the table was ours. Sweet! \n\nI'm a huge fan of the punch here, and it seems like the punches are a crowd favorite. We ordered a bowl of the Pisco Punch which was extremely good. We could hardly taste the alcohol! There was also a Thai Milk Punch which I tried and enjoyed a lot! It was like thai iced tea with alcohol (tasted better than it sounds!). I tried a third punch with coconut milk which had a very unique taste. Overall, I think the punches are the specialty here.\n\n(AN EXTREMELY SMALL GRIPE: They served the punch in huge bowls with ice, and also gave cups full of ice. This led to really messy pouring and spilling. It would be nice if they filled only the cups with ice, or only the punch bowl, but not both!)\n\nI tried a couple friend's cocktails and they were both very strong. I take that as a good sign for a bar.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time at Novela.

And wow - was I impressed. One step through the door, and I didn't realize where I was. This is a classy cocktail bar with a modern lite-up library interior, as well as, comfortably large and private seating. I asked for the strongest drink and was recommended the Jay Gatsby - and it was exactly what I needed after a long day. We also tried the Lolita and Leopold, both unique but potent cocktails. Of course, with every good drink there must be some good bites, so we ordered the deviled eggs and charcuterie plate. The plate had a  assortment of 3 cold cuts, nuts, pickles, and bread. With my Russian background, I consider myself a connoisseur of cold cut meat, and I found this to be an ideal lightly salted mix that complemented the drinks. The deviled eggs were pretty decent also. This was a great place to come in for a drink with a small group. And best of all, I left a souvenir my friend bought me on the table, and came back 1 hours later after I realized I left it, and they had held it for me! Excellent service. I highly recommend Novela to anyone - I know I will be back.", "author": "Nikita K."}

So as soon as I got back I asked them where was my cake and my bag (everyone was drunk) and the working ppl say if u like we can bring the cake back but the gift bag (??) disappeared!!! \nI told the security guard at the door (thinking that he could help) and he was very nice saying that he could check since one of the camera was pointed right in the sofa, so I gave my name n number and never got any calls. \nSo I tried contacting novella bar thru emails, website and calling (voice message) and no one never replied! \nHorrible customer service, over all they only want you to spend the $$$.

Man, I really hate places that make complex cocktails with well liquor.  Like what is the point?  It is uninspired and basically just taking advantage of the mixology trend, but without truly delivering a delicious, worthy cocktail.  Whereas most unassuming people would order a rum and coke, now they can order a rum with plum soda and a dash of bitter clown jizz.  Fancy, huh?\n\nOne of the cocktail descriptions sounded so amazing, except it's main ingredient was \"vodka.\"  Just, vodka.  Ok.  That is like ordering a \"steak\", without any kind of information on what kind of steak you are ordering.  How about going to an expensive restaurant, and ordering \"pasta\".  There is more than one kind, and each one is quite different when you are attempting to craft a well balanced menu item with the corresponding high prices.  Some people might believe that the addition of other ingredients voids any main liquor, so top shelf is unnecessary.  I disagree.  Other ingredients should balance out a delicious base liquor to create an amazing drinkable sensation, dude!  You are charging good money for these, so give me something great.\n\nTheir choice whiskey is usually Dickel, so like one step above well.  This one is easily flattened with the addition of other ingredients and ice.  I'm disappointed when I see Dickel as the main ingredient of a cocktail, and put out by well liquor altogether.\n\nNo thanks on some crappy well rum with vanilla infused baby tears and a sprig of mint sourced from heaven.  Still tastes like crappy alcohol.  The bartenders also seem very green and unknowlegable about the craft.  This is not a serious cocktail bar, but they will charge you serious cocktail prices!

When we arrived in the evening I was informed that our table was only ours for 2,5 hours and that we would have to give it up at 10.30. I was very disappointed, this was news to me.

I felt like us being there was just one big nuisance. But we decided to stay because this was the venue my party knew about and where they would show up.

The bottles on the glass-shelving bar in the middle of the room are also lit up and you can see them from both sides. It's filled with dark wood and comfortable seats. Even my Juliet Capulet was delicious but the experience made the whole cool atmosphere seem pretentious.\n\nWe walked in from the rain and found a seat around 9:30 or 10 I guess, on a Monday. We were neither approached nor greeted with a shout from the bar. We waited and got our own menus. Someone in our group said there's no table service, so we took a minute chatting and perusing the menu before we went up to the bar to order. \n\nThere were three bartenders walking behind the bar. We ordered two drinks from one of them and waited a bit long. There were other people sitting at the bar but it wasn't overly crowded, and didn't feel like a crazy, rushed atmosphere. I turned around and two bartenders were gone, including the one who took our order. Someone else handed us our drinks. Mine - a pisco cocktail, called Juliet Capulet - was $13 + 1.14 tax I guess? Wow. It was also about a quarter of the glass. It was tasty but my blood is not that rich.\n\nMy friend asked for wifi info. There is none. I didn't know places existed that still did not offer wifi.\nI asked for a pitcher of water for our table (we were about 8).. I got one and no glasses.\n\nWe sat and sipped, agreeing we all felt a bit meh about this place and their prices, and decided quickly we needed to go elsewhere. We finished our drinks, and a waitress came over and asked if we needed anything. Too little, too late. If the drinks were cheaper, OR the service was better I would give them more credit. Doesn't even have to be both. People I know have given Novela 4-5 stars, but I didn't feel it. Maybe on a different night customers are paid more attention.", "author": "Heidi P."}

When it gets crowded, seems like the bartenders ignore you and focus on making drinks for those that are seated and are ordering from the wait staff. Took over 30 min to just get the attention of a bartender. Then he said give me a second..... I understand that you are busy and swamped but my coworkers and I were standing idly by for 30 min and no one bothered to acknowledge us. \n\nAnyways, the space is really great for small to medium sized groups. You should reserve a spot in advance if you plan on getting an area to sit in. Otherwise there's plenty of room to stand around the bar, which is what my coworkers and I do since we sit all day long at work anyways so we don't mind standing at a bar. \n\nOh I saw that they do oysters on mondays from 4 to 7pm so I will be back to try that for sure.

I tried the Thai Tea Punch, which surprisingly was very good, yet odd. It tasted like thai tea kind of, but with a twist. My favorite drink that I tried that night though, was the Gin-Sake punch! I normally am not a big fan of Sake, but the drink was sweet and to my liking.\n\nI came on a Friday night around 9, and it was just starting to get crowded; they take reservations though, so if you come with a large crowd, you can try and reserve a table free.

The last two times I tried to go to Novela were a fail. the first time, my friend from out of town was cleansing and didn't want to do cocktails. The second time, there was a private party in progress. The third time was the charm. \n\nEvery since Novela opened, I have bee cruising by and enjoying the ambience. It's even better inside. leather chairs, t.The soft neon glow, pictures of Papa Hemingway, and lots of glorious books. OK, actually lots of books. I kept staring at a Jackie Collins novel that was right about eye level. Great literature? NO. A great addition to the overall look and feel of the place? Definitely. I just wish Novela was a bit quieter. All those books do nothing to kill the din.  I was with several other people. A group conversation was out. It was better to sidle up to one or two friends at a time. They need some nice velvet drapes, or better yet, some acoustic tiles. The seating is a killer too. it looks fabulous, but isn't really particularly comfortable. The chairs are a bit too low and oversized. If you spend more than an hour or so in them, it will begin to wear on you, unless you are a rather tall man. Then you might not notice a thing.\n\nSo, what about the cocktails/ They are pretty good. I had a Roy Hobbs and Hemingway's \"Cool Hero\" Punch for my libations. Both are guaranteed to put a bit of hair on your chest and some pep in your step. The Roy Hobbs was smooth, and the rhubarb added just the right hint of the exotic. The punch was harder to love. I'm not sure if it was the smokiness of the Arbeg or the floral notes from the Earl Grey syrup, but there was a distinct after taste that only went away about 3/4 of the way into my first glass. I also had sips of various other things (Scarlett O'Hara!), and it seems to me like each cocktail seemed to have just one thing too many. The next time I visit, I might be tempted to go the classic route and just stick with the Old Fashioned. \n\nService was good. I really liked how efficient and friendly our bartender was. She managed to handle me, a group of indecisive 20 somethings, and a group of suits wanting to leave in a hurry with the right amount of humor and aplomb. I suspect this might be an excellent place for people watching if you are so inclined. The clientele seemed just a bit eclectic. Novela is a solid 3.5.

I came for a friend's birthday on a Saturday night since they had such good reviews, there was no cover, and the venue looked classy. Since we got there early (around 10:15pm), there was no line and we were able to walk right in. However, our friends that got there later weren't so lucky. Even though the bar had plenty of space, they took their sweet time letting people in, and it took our friends at least half an hour to get in (they got in line around 11:15/11:30). What's worse were the nasty \"Cocktails with Character\" that they charge $11-$13/drink- each one I tried was horrible in my opinion. The Jacob Marley (Bourbon, Apple-Infused Alarosa Sherry, Benedictine, Cinnamon Bitters, $11) was overpowered by cinnamon flavor, the Romeo Montague (Rye Whiskey, Root Liqueur, Coriander, Angostura Bitters, Allspice, $11) was bitter, and the Ichabod Crane (Papa's Pilar Dark Rum, Spiced Blood Orange Liqueur, Smith & Cross Rum, Tonic Water, Lemon, $13) was barely drinkable. In addition, they only serve 2 types of vodka (no Grey Goose), and don't have pineapple juice.. what kind of bar IS this? The shots they poured were also super tiny, and they don't even fill up the tiny shot glass all the way. Their bartenders are not friendly at all, and I don't know if any amount of tip will get them to crack a smile. To top it all of, the music they played was dull and awful- I was really tempted to grab a book off the shelf and start reading it since I was getting so bored. We ended up leaving around midnight to go somewhere else fun, and saw there was still a long line of people waiting to get in (the bar still wasn't even remotely near capacity at that point). \n\nAlthough the venue itself is nice, I wouldn't think about coming back based on the service, high prices, and nasty drinks.

I went out last night and was hanging with a few friends. We are out eating and then go have some drinks and wind up here. We go find some seats by the back bar and put our stuff down.  And walk over to the open bar. That one was closed in the back. As we are waiting for the bartender, this bridge and tunnel chick front of us motions toward our seats telling her friend to go sit there. I politely tell her we are sitting there and that when shit hit the fan. This mitch turns to me and says \"then you need to go sit there and tell your friend to stop fucking bumping into me with his bag. \"It was crowded as hell. Great crowd btw. I tell her it's crowded and people are going to be bumping into each other. She proceeds to be a fucking bitch about the situation. So I admit I engaged by being an asshole, you want to act like an idiot and call me and my friend s names will be a dick right back. She calls me an asshole for telling her to chill so I was like fuck you. I could have easily been the bigger man but this female got under my skin. As we are going back in forth I was trying to be as big of an asshole as I could be because this chick went psycho in 2.3 seconds. Here is where shit got twisted. The cocktailer looks over at her not us but her and was like is he bothering you. \nSo a side note, not to pull the race card but I am 6 foot 10 inches and265 I am a big \"black\" guy. And she was a 5 foot 10 white girl. She goes and tells the security guard and next thing I know I'm being pulled outside and got to explain myself. Now the security guard was just doing his job. No problem he was very professional and when I explained to him what happened he understood she started the mess and was disrespectful to my friends and me. And let me back in. where my problem lies is the cocktailer Katelyn she could have asked us either to stop or go outside or told the security guard we both were cussing each other out. But no just me. I wonder why. What made things ever worse was I was in company of Willie brown. A family friend, it's bad enough I embarrassed myself by engaging in a stupid argument but to be racially profiled in the presence of a civil rights advocate didn't help matters. I take full responsibility for my behavior. But I think the cocktailer handled the situation wrong by taking sides without knowing what the hell was going on. \nwhen I first walked in I joked and was really friendly with the guard so when he and I was outside talking about what happened he was like the story he was told didn't seem right he was like I find it hard to believe you was super friendly and joking with me and 5 min later you walk in and start shit. Again he was just doing his job. \nI will never set foot in here again. I used to like this place we just had a reserved two tables and dropped over a grand and tipped our waitress 350 in November.

Love the names, but that's where it ends.  My punch flight all tasted the same, even though they were to have completely different flavor profiles.  Cocktails were equally disgusting.\n\nCustomer Service-0 STARS.  Our waitress was rude, inattentive, and attempted to charge us a \"standard 20% service charge\" that is reserved for parties of 6 or more and tabs left open.  We were a party of 4 and had to wait 15 minutes for our tab that was thrown rudely at us, not once but twice.  When I noticed this charge, I wasn't able to flag her down so went to the bar, where the very nice mixologist told me to have a seat while he had her fix it for us.  Instead, she comes barging over and rudely tells me \"what's the problem with your check?!?\".  When I inquired about the service charge, she continues in her rude tone of \"well it clearly states everywhere about the charge\". I then ask her to show me where, because on the drink menu it clearly states the charge only applies to 6 or more and tabs left behind. \n\nHer excuse to being called out on this \"oh, well, it must be something new because I haven't seen it before.\" REALLY BIOTCH?!?! I would think that management would have informed their staff of this type of important policy change.  Makes me wonder how many other people they have scammed and didn't catch on to this extra charge.  After having the tab thrown at me again, I left her a big fat 0 for a tip and a nice note as to \"why it's not nice or cool to throw the bill at paying customers\". \n\nWith so many places in SoMa, this is definitely a place I have no intention of ever visiting again!", "author": "Bella P."}

On the day before, I received an email directly from Novela that they were double booked, and that my reservation had to be cancelled. As a consolation, they offered to put me first on the wait list, hence bumping this up to 2 stars for notifying me ahead of time. Upon arrival, I was told that there was a low likelihood for getting a table, however, they'll be sure to let me know if one does become available. Since there's two lines (one for no ressies and one for ressies), they should've also offered to let my group go through the ressies line. Apparently, that line gets priority, and my group ended up waiting for more than half an hour to get in.\n\nI must say though that the decor was nice, however, drinks were ridiculously overpriced and not at all tasty. For the ladies, this is the place to be seen, and many are dressed to the nines. I was almost put to sleep by the music from the 70's/80's and some other stuff the first half of the night, but it switched over to something more upbeat around midnight. By then, the place had become packed with pushy and rude people. Turned off, I had to move my group elsewhere to a less pretentious place...\n\nThis spot is trending at the moment, but unless improvements in customer service are made, I wouldn't be surprised if it were to fade out in no time.

Walls lined with books, an English-lit-themed menu, and a card catalogue acting as a hostess' stand. Thanks to its location, enormous floor plan, and overall swankiness (sexy damask, monochrome floors, unisex bathrooms and chandeliers) this promises to be the Happy Hour spot for FiDi folk for the foreseeable future. But how do the drinks... stack up?\n\nThe drinks are named after characters from your fave high school required reading. The Jay Gatsby is bourbon and Islay scotch, marred by just a bit too much amaretto. The Huckleberry Finn fares better; it's rum, grapefruit, lemon, and bitters. It manages to be citrus-y but not too sweet. The leader of the pack in my books is the Santiago. Mezcal and tequila, coffee liquor and bitters. Deep and smoky, with just a hint of sweetness. Just like Hemingway!\n\nIf only. On closer inspection the literary theme seems a bit put on. I was confused by the inclusion of some British names in what seemed to be an homage to American literature, and calling a non-alcoholic option the \"Helen Keller\" is just... odd. Add in a glaring typo (Holy Golightly? C'mon.) and the bookworm in me can't help but be a little let down. Yes, these are the nerdiest of quibbles. I'll go stuff myself into a locker now.\n\nThe variety and inventiveness of the cocktails is a nice change from the expected, and the space truly is gorgeous. With drinks from $9-12 they're at least comparable to nearby Local Edition. And the option to order punch (on tap for some reason) gives them a slight edge. Time will tell if this story has a happy ending. \n\nObligatory Title Pun: Get LIT.\n\nMenu Readability: Two column card, with a swell cameo logo.\n\nNeed to mention: They have a semi-private area in the back with its own bar.\n\nWhat this place teaches me about myself: Sherlock Holmes made the menu, but Colonel Kurtz didn't? OK, OK, I'll shut up.", "author": "Vivek S."}

Even the furniture and decor make it seem like you are in a vintage library. To be brutally honest, I didn't really get it because I don't see the connection between books and alcohol, but nevertheless, it was interesting. As for the drinks, WOW. I am very picky about my drinks and the cocktails and punch definitely passed the test. I was very impressed. I will say that this place is more of a yuppy dive-in lounge than anything else. Given that there are not too many of those in SF, I can see why this place receives a lot of the yuppy SF crowd. Not that there is anything wrong with that (I was a part of it for the past three years!), but you definitely need to dress up a little if you come by here. If you are in casual clothes, you will definitely stand out and not in a good way. That being said, you don't have to be worried because it's also not a huge pick-up bar.

Novela not only gives an upscale classical environment a modern, trendy twist, but also successfully captures the current appeal of the whole Gangster Squad/Great Gatsby/combover-fashion-mid-nineteenth-century-coutoure social vibe. I don't know if that made any sense at all, but basically: everyone wants to be fancy these days, and Novela transports you to a fancy place -- one where you can still listen to EDM. \n\nThe drinks are solid. (Check out their menu here: http://novelasf.com/menu/) Definitely get the punch! We got the rum one and it was delicious! (I don't even like rum.) I ordered the Leopold Bloom cocktail and my friends and I agreed it tasted like a flower -- didn't like it. However, a couple of my friends ordered different \"citrus foreward\" cocktails, and like typical girls, we all appreciated the fruity flavor combos. \n\nThe waitresses are nice. The seating becomes somewhat limited on a crowded night (what's new), but there's plenty of room around the bar to stand. If there's a lull in your conversations, you can stare at the moving lights at the bar, or even grab a book - they're real! \n\nRecommendation: \nIf you're into exploring the city and checking out cool places, Novela will add a nice photo to your album of experiences. Definitely check it out.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

Books (or fake books) on the shelves on the walls and cocktails named after literary characters.    GF had the Pippi Longstocking, which was perfect for her, and I had the Atticus Finch, which was perfect for me.  Great cocktails.. $12+ a piece. Space is really nice in that it's open.  The bar has no stools, so it's pretty open and easy to get to the bar and order a drink.  There's one big table in the middle and everything else is sofas, armchairs, etc against the walls.   \n\nThe problem with the open space/setup is that it's a bit awkward.  There's very few places to sit for such a large space.  Most of the lounge areas are reserved.  And even if they're not, you sit somewhere that's open, and they'll come kick you out for a larger group.  It also has the feel of a somewhat classy lounge, where you can sit back in your chairs, but they pump the music just a bit too loud so you can't hear each other.  \n\nService is terrible.  There are servers walking around and it seems like there should be table service, but they just socialize amongst each other and pretty much ignore the tables.  I can understand if it's super crowded, but it wasn't b/c we were there early.  You have to either go get your own drink or wave the servers to come over if you can ever get them to look your way.\n\nOverall, just kind of seems like a snooty place.", "author": "Easter E."}

Wahoo! This has been on both of our lists for a long time, since we're both bookworms and the promotional photos of the neon color-coded library setting have been tantalizing. We moseyed in around 8 pm, and it was quiet and casual. From the neon lights and dark wood interior, we assumed it would be really loud and clubby when corwded, so we were happy to find plenty of open seats and took a long tour around the small bar before settling down in two high-backed arm chairs along the library wall.\n\nWe studied the menu and were enthralled by the literary inspirations for the drink names. She went for the Sherlock Holmes, and I ordered the (gin) punch. They were pretty... but they were really. quite. bad. The Sherlock Holmes tasted like medicine: maybe that's the birch beer? It had a strong bitter taste. Blech. And while my gin punch was not bitter, boy was it sweet: candy cloying sweet. Double blech. This was a HUGE letdown after all the hype.  Maybe it's just me, but I thought we ordered the most appetizing drinks on the menu (everything else sounded like a weird combo), so I'm really not interested in laying down more money to try something that will likely be even worse than what I tried last time.  The drink-making definitely does not match up to the hip interior.\n\nI would give this place 2 stars, but the interior is really great and I might be willing to come back again if I ordered wine or beer.  It's another \"scene\" that doesn't deliver on drinks, but at least the scenery is easy on the eyes... I can imagine it could be quite popular for girls' night out since there are huge crystal chandeliers and cute seats. But now I understand why my husband was VERY meh after he came here with coworkers a few months ago. Work on your mixology!", "author": "Hannah C."}

The crowd is pretty trendy, an interesting mix between the tech scene and the finance scene in SF. It's fancy and a little more upscale than other places in the area, without attracting the douchey types, so it's fine by me. \n\nThe whole place is themed to be like a library, books line the walls and a room in the back that feels like a smaller study. If you can get past the crowds to the back, you'll be surprised to see there's another bar. Always check that back bar first since the line is almost always shorter.\n\nTo top it all off the drinks are named after some of your favorite characters like the Jay Gatsby or the Hellen Keller.

My friend who lives in the area recommended we stop in for a quick pre-dinner drink on a Wednesday night when it was only mildly full. The interior was absolutely adorable. This is one of those bars that I could comfortably stay at for a fun evening. The bar room is lit by pretty chandeliers dispersed throughout the room and books line the wall of the interior and are color coded with lights shining on the shelves to allow the colors of the books to shine brightly. The floors are black and white tiled and the entire scene makes you feel like you're in a 1920's movie which is appropriate as the names of the drinks are inspired by famous literary authors of that era. What makes this bar so comfortable to spend a good deal of time is is how spacious it is. Tables and chairs aren't squeezed into any open slot so that the integrity of the space is kept. They have a long U-shaped bar, lots of bigger tables and couches for bigger parties and two person tables as well on the outskirts of the bar. My friend and I had a bit of trouble initially finding seats so we ordered standing up at the bar. We both went for the Vianne Rocher which was an interesting vodka-based drink with passion fruit. Every sip ended with what tasted like a bit of chili powder. I could never quite get used to the taste but I enjoyed the atmosphere so much that it compensated for the drink. Once a table opened up one of the nice waitstaff let us know about it and we stayed for a while and did some people watching and dog watching - dogs were allowed in - before heading off to dinner.

I preferred the fruity drink even though I'm not much of a \"lady cocktail\" consumer.  it simply had a better flavor - sweet and a touch of thyme.  I then tried 3 flights.

I like the floor plan and that it is spacious. The seats by the windows are good for people watching on Mission street. Those comfy chairs by the bookcases are good for relaxing and taking in a good scotch or bourbon. I love the drink concoctions and literary names. Novela also has good events, like the World Cup viewing party and the 49ers viewing parties. This is my classy spot in downtown for drinks.", "author": "Infodiva B."}

Everyone I know loves the colored library theme, and best of all, they're real! Take one off the shelf and get lost in Great Expectations while you sip your cocktail. Speaking of cocktails, the three-whiskey punch is what it's most famous for, and with good reason. They do run out on busy nights, and it's a little on the strong and bitter side for something that's pink, so order with...proper expectations. (See what I did there?)\n\nThe back bar is typically reserved for private parties, and weekends can get pretty packed in here. Try it out midweek if you like a calmer scene, but I haven't taken anyone there who hasn't loved it.", "author": "Kevin B."}

I could also see this place turning into a cluster come Friday night, seeing that servers seemed to be MIA (or avoiding us like the plague) so we had to stand in line at the bar for libations.

I booked a table 30mins before arrival, super easy and they even called/texted me to confirm. Arrived on time, got my table and waited for my friends. This place started to get packed within a few mins. Lemme just say the decor of this place is super trendy. There's colorful bookshelves lights all around and swanky chairs, the crowd was very \"yuppies\" that night. But that's what you get for happy hour in the FiDi/SoMa area so it wasn't bad at all. Also, all the hostesses were female and super sweet! \n\nAnywhoo, I ordered a mojito which was good but too sweet for my liking. We wanted to order food but I guess they don't offer that yet (hope it's coming soon)....But Luckily, 7x7 was hosting an event, so caterers were coming out of no where with platter of tiny fries, sliders, and cocktails. They were super nice and it was all free (kudos to that). \n\nAlso, Ploom vaporizers and gals were coming around asking people to demo their tobacco which was Awesome! I loved it and might possibly buy one. I tried the peach tobacco flavor (MMmmm!). \n\nOverall, a great experience at Novela.

The lighting, the books, the wallpaper, is all beautiful.  When you see the books on the bookshelves, it may look as though the lighting is coloring the books but look closely and you'll notice that the book themselves are colored and the lighting is highlighting the colors.  The clear see-through bar with the colored lighting is also a nice touch.  With plenty of seating throughout, I could definitely see this as a go-to happy hour location.\n\nUnfortunately, as it was the grand opening, the drink orders took forever.  It didn't look like they had a soda gun and my vodka tonic tasted different...  I shared a punch pitcher with some friends and that was a little too sweet for our taste buds (tequila).

My writing you is to address something every food and beverage establishment should lay out to staff before opening doors and that is keep things classy and leave egos at home. Friend orders a vodka soda. You do not stock the mainstream brand and so you substitute with an organic vodka. Drink arrives and tastes not as strong, somewhat watered down. We ask the bartender, an Asian male managing the bar in the backroom, 5'8\" tanned, tatted neck, spiked hair, whether he could sample the drink served and tell us if it's that way or needs more vodka. He looks at us as if we don't know how the drink is served, felt insulted  then whispers something to his two sous mixologists and the 3 avoid us like the plague for the entire 30mins of standing there. Finally when the crowd dissipates the younger of the staff explains that the drinks are measured and they can't do anything about it. Again not willing to sample the drink.

This establishment was very busy, but the service didn't miss a beat.  My bartender, Josh, was quick, efficient, and most importantly attentive.  I didn't have to wait long at all for drinks, and every drink I ordered was a well crafted cocktail that was very well priced.\n\nSecond, the ambience.  This establishment provided a very high-end, relaxed feel at very reasonable prices.  Novela is a great place to enjoy a few cocktails, hang out with friends, and meet new people.  It attracts a diverse clientele and provides for a very enjoyable atmosphere.  The decor gives this establishment a unique personality of its own creating an experience that you don't get at your typical \"bar\".\n\nThis will definitely be a regular spot for me!", "author": "Chris E."}

There are a few things anyone wants in a good bar:\n\n1. Ambiance: Novela had a great ambiance. I really liked the library theme and the decor. I also liked how it wasn't so loud that I couldn't talk to the other people in my group. This is where the positives end. \n2. Service: The bartenders were rude to multiple people in our group. I asked one bartender if they served off the cocktail menu the entire night and her snappy answer was just that \"this is the cocktail menu,\" as if I didn't know that already. See below for another example of how they were rude. \n3. Drinks: Their drinks were sub-par at best. Their flavors were too strong and didn't blend well with the alcohols. The Salvatore Paradise was far too smokey and when a friend of mine asked to change it, the bartender said \"we don't waste alcohol\" and just added some soda water to it for her. She ended up throwing out the overpriced drink ($12). I got the Daisy Buchanan for $14 which was far too sweet for my taste and had a tangy aftertaste. I had to force myself to finish it because I couldn't imagine wasting that money. \n\nIn the end the only reason I had a somewhat good time was the fact that I had awesome company, but none of us would ever return to this place again. There are far too many good bars with much better service to waste our time on overpriced drinks here.", "author": "Nayna L."}

I emailed you and talked with Irina about my options. Make a reservation through the website, she said, and I did.

You owe your customers proactive service when canceling their reservations. \n\nKnow what else is disappointing?

Made a reservation for a table for 12 people, was seated in a space that comfortably fits 8, we squeezed in 10 but could not squeeze in the other 2 people. When we asked if we could get another chair we were reminded that Novela doesn't actually guarantee seating when you reserve a table. The table next to ours said they weren't using their chairs and offered them to us but the hostess / manager (not sure what her role was) told us chairs could not be moved from one table to another. When one of our guests (who hadn't heard that conversation) asked and borrowed a chair from another table the manager was incredibly rude to him and snatched the chair back.

Walking around and ordering drinks is a mess with so many people, and flagging down a table is also a bit of a bear, but man, there is A LOT of talent here. Prices are fairly standard for what you're getting, so it's not a huge hit on the wallet for the area.

Our server didn't actually arrive to our table until 11:12 and that was after I had to get up and locate the hostess twice regarding the absence of our server. Would have been a bigger deal if we didn't already have drinks but since we did it wasn't..so since we had approx. 45 minutes to look at the menu we were ready to order as soon as she arrived... we went with the bowl of punch. We found the punch (vodka based) to be incredibly sweet, it honestly taste like syrup puree. I ended up asking the server if we could switch it our for something else... it was that bad. ****Being that i was a server/ bartender for 7 years i think its incredibly important to educate the customer, if you know that the drink a customer is ordering is sweet, how much trouble is it to give someone a heads up? ( customer service) In hindsight we ordered punch, punch is a sweet drink so next time we will ask a bit more questions before committing to 45 ounces of sugar water. When we talked to our waitress she did say she would see what she could do and the manager offered to take 50% off and we did ask for some sparkling water to dilute which helped ...a little...but it was a struggle. Honestly the thing that bothered me the most was the waitress said to us when we asked: \"why didn't you tell us it was so sweet\"? the waitress responded  \"well you seemed like you knew what you were ordering and its punch so I'm not even going to defend it\" uhhhhhhhhh.... well we did have 45 minutes to look at the menu so yes we did know what we wanted to order. Also thats a bit rude\n\nOverall I think Novela is a great place to have a few drinks and hang out, good music, ambiance but i would suggest stay away from the punch and go for a cocktail or a glass of wine.", "author": "Sylvia S."}

There is this really cute bar area nook in the back with the coolest looking chandeliers, I have a soft spot for neat lighting.  The drinks are well made, had quite a few Jay Gatsbys and pitchers of rum punch.  I'm hoping it was just because it was opening week but the bartenders were not very efficient in collecting money - my drink was made and then he went on to make 2 more people's orders before coming back for my money...it's a super crowded bar I'd like to move away so other people can order, you don't want to be that girl just standing there with the drinks!  The pitchers are hard to deal with if you don't have a table so booked a table for this Friday, Jen, the private events girl,  was really easy and nice to work with in reserving a table, great customer service and quick reply back.

We were seated at the table, and I have to say the chairs are really low, and the table is really high. It was a little awkward for me to sit, and I feel like I am pretty average height. About 30 minutes after we seated, the place got extremely loud. It was so hard to carry a conversation with the person I was sitting across from.

This place is trying to be a mixology bar but the drinks weren't blended or balanced well. When the bartender had trouble stirring two drinks simultaneous I began to worry. Then maybe the owner or someone walked by and he took a sip and said the drink didn't taste right, so my bartender kept trying the drink to check if the taste was correct..she basically drank half the drink since she couldn't get it right. I think she gave up because the drink tasted terrible. Then we gave them another try by getting the draft punch sampler, we figured you can't screw up a pre-made drink. We were wrong..you can screw up punch, it was so sweet it tasted like simple syrup with food coloring. I also don't think they use much alcohol in their drinks because I was drinking prior and felt the alcohol kicking in but when I got to Novela I started to loose my buzz...not cool especially when your drinks are $10.

We made a reservation online, which she impatiently told us they didn't have. She proceeded to be irritated that we still wanted to be seated somewhere and obnoxiously told us that they could maybe seat us somewhere until another real reservation came in. She treated us like street urchins and didn't even come close to a smile. This was also right at 7 when they had JUST opened and were virtually empty. We were told that the other reservation would cause us to be uprooted at 9:30. Okay, that's fine. Over 2 hours was more than enough time to enjoy our yummy literary themed concoctions. \n\nAt 8:50 the same rude hostess came back and plopped a sassy \"reserved\" sign on our table as if to remind us what second-class citizens we were. We all wanted to lay her out. She was also browsing her cell phone at the hostess stand and we even saw her ignore customers that came through the door.

I plan on going this weekend with some friends so I can let you know how it goes but I'm writing this review because I just met a lovely bartender, Josh who works there. I met him at Philz Coffee recently and found out he bartends there! So I asked him about it and he told me all about the menu and the vibe and was so nice! I can't wait to try out their unique cocktails and go out for a fun night at a bar that actually does table service.", "author": "Jen M."}

I suggest giving the dog at the entrance some training on manners and how to interact with people. We came for a birthday party ready to spend money. Will not come back.", "author": "bob r."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-01", "description": "this is a new place with a lot of potential.  the drinks are good, the atmosphere is good, the seating is decent.  however, the space feels lopsided and uneven, with all the people (because it gets packed) squashed in on one side of the place, logically, the side where the bar is.  the bathroom is past all these hoards of people, so you have to squeeze your way past them to the back, and then fight your way through the crowd to get out again.  it takes forever to order a drink if you aren't there first, and don't make the choice of leaving your tab open, you'll have to wait forever in line just to close it out.", "author": "Seymour D."}
