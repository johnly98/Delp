The Treasury compared to the other 30 venues I contacted was incredible. The buyout was reasonable, the staff was so friendly, and the drinks were incredible.\n\nA small story to highlight this.. I had emailed that I was going to stop by to see the space. I walked in and my eye was caught by on of the employees who found us a table and brought chairs. This was before they knew who I was (so before they were trying to 'sell' me on the space). They were welcoming and friendly to all.\n\nElisa and Ryan with the rest of the crew were spectacular.\n\nI truly can not recommend the Treasury enough.", "author": "chelsea j."}

I'd probably rate the treasury a 3 during happy hour and a 4 outside of that.\n\nOn the weekdays starting at 4pm, the place starts getting crowded once the traders start getting off work. Around 5pm it's almost impossible to get a seat let alone edge your way to the bar. The seating area is scarce since the area  around the bar is pretty narrow.\n\nBesides the crowd and the lack of space, the super fancy cocktails are pretty tasty. My favorite was the Flash which they don't seem to serve anymore. It was a nice gin (or vodka if you prefer) with kiwi, cucumber and lemon juice. Super refreshing! Some of the other drinks are tasty as well so just make your way down their cocktail menu :)\n\nOther than the cocktails, the food is just okay. The pigs in a blanket with the mustard dipping sauce soaks up the alcohol quite nicely.", "author": "Kathy L."}

Apparently they make a lot of their alcohols in small batches, so once it's gone, it may not be back for a while!\n\nSpace is nice, with the long bar as the centerpiece and tables to the side for food.

Got the pigs in a blanket and deviled eggs. Verdict: tasty bar food, but very expensive for what it is (e.g. $15 for 1.5 eggs). Pigs in a blanket crust was layered and crunchy. Mustard had the right slight burn to compliment the appropriate saltiness of the sausage and pastry. The sausage was of good quality and felt like real meat.\n\nThe deviled egg: white part wasn't salted at all, and a bit hard, yolk was fairly standard but didn't wow.

I arrived at 4-4:15 pm & the place was already getting crowded. Definitely need to arrive early (with your entire party) to secure seating. Probably better for smaller groups of 2-3 here.\n\nI secured a seat at the bar while I waited for my friends to arrive. Ordered the Watermelon Slushy & Roasted Squash & Burrata. Why? Because I could never say no to watermelon (my favorite fruit) & burrata (one of my favorite cheeses). The Slushy was pretty strong in alcohol, so I couldn't taste much of the watermelon. The Squash & Burrata on levain slices, on the other hand, was AMAZING. I would return just for it, but I think The Treasury's menu changes.\n\nOh yeah, I also ordered the Spicy Chicken Sandwich to-go for my bf, but it wasn't that great.

It's a wonderful cool lounge right in the middle of the Financial District (FiDi). Just like any other bar around the area, this place gets packed! But, the customer service is exceptional and the drinks are to die for!\n\nLocated in a 100-year-old Beaux Art Building; it provides a small, intimate bar lounge that offers dim lightening and candles. Just perfect for any occasion. Perfect location as its right down the street from the Montgomery Bart Station. It's convenient for everyone. I came on a Thursday night for a Meetup and was surprised at how beautiful the inside space was. I sat in the bar area and ordered a Shattered Ceiling, which consist of: absolute vodka, blood orange, manzanilla  sherry, sage and honey. Very tasty and delicious!\n\nThey have a good Happy Hour and grabs many drinker's attention. It does get loud, especially during the bar area. They offer seating near the windows (right by the bar) as well as in the back. Many people come up to the bar to order their drink and take it back to their seat. \n\nOverall, cool atmosphere. This place is poppin' during happy hour time and seems to grab a lot of attention. Prices are steep-no lie! Be prepared to cash out for drinks!

I found it refreshing on the hot day and really enjoyed it! One of my friends ordered the \"Blackberry Slush\" and my other friend ordered the \"Watermelon Slush\" (Both ~$15/each). I tried their drinks as well - all the cocktails were very well made and presented beautifully. The Blackberry Slush was particularly strong, but not sure if that was a bartender accident.\n\nWhat I really loved about this spot was the ambiance! The indoor decor was beautiful and there was a good amount of seating considering the size of this place. It's kind of located by a hotel right behind Blue Bottle Coffee, so it's a strange location but very cozy.\n\nPrices ranged from $12-18 for most cocktails.

The Standard Oil ended up being mine. Basically a twist on a Manhattan, so this was the most like my type of drink. The rest of the drinks were pretty and colorful, but everything seemed light and I like my drinks dark and strong. I saw a bunch of people ordering the daily slushie, so maybe that's the drink to get? It looked more like a drink I would enjoy on the beach versus a SF HH drink.\n\nMost bars in the FiDi are busy after work and this one is no exception. Drinks are fun, but taste wise not my type of cocktail. And the atmosphere was not really my type of place either. A little too uppity? More so because of the clientele than the bar itself, I think.

Served in a tall glass, this cocktail was strong but refreshing.  \n\nPurple Rain - $13. Colorful, fruity, and strong.  Hit the spot.  The names of the cocktails are more playful than the cocktails themselves which are all business. \n\nCheese Plate - $15.  The chef was out so they only had a limited menu.  I was disappointed we couldn't try the more interesting items.  Cheese was fine but not memorable. \n\nOverall, we had a nice time hanging out before hitting the town.

I just wanted to relax, have a drink at the bar and catch up with a friend. You couldn't have been better. There was a nice after-work crowd enjoying the same thing. I had found a place I could come back to again and again. I could chat with the bartender. You were perfect - right around the corner from my office.\n\nBut, you had to change, didn't you? The last few times I was looking for that same place I thought I knew. Relax, have a drink after a long day at the office and enjoy some conversation at the bar.\n\nUnfortunately\u200b, the music was so loud I couldn't have any conversation.

And I mean that in a good way (with all due respect to MC Hammer).\n\nI'll be honest... I wasn't sure what to expect from The Treasury tonight. From the outside looking in, it looked like another crowded, douchey FiDi bar full of arrogant finance dudes. But looks, as we all know, can be deceiving. When I actually walked inside, I was delightfully surprised by how unpretentious The Treasury really was. Although it was super packed at 5:30pm, I had no trouble flagging down a friendly bartender to make me a drink. I ordered a Manhatten with Maker's Mark, and it was one of the best Manhattens I've had in ages. Not sure what their secret is. And for my second (and final) drink of the night, I ordered the Tycoon (their version of an Old Fashioned, made with Elijah Craig 10yr Single Barrel bourbon, smoke, muscovado, and bitters). Wow - this could be my new favorite bourbon cocktail. They literally smoke the cocktail on the bar with one of those torch-thingies that chefs use to make creme brulee. They somehow capture the smoke (and the flavor of the smoke) in the glass, and then mix in the rest of the ingredients. The end result is liquid perfection. It's $16, which is a bit more than I'm used to paying for a libation. But the presentation alone is worth the price of admission.\n\nWhat really blew me away about this place was the food. This kitchen isn't just putting out peanuts and charcuterie. They're serving gourmet bar bites that rival the best restaurants in town. My friend and I shared their Pigs In a Blanket, the Deviled Egg Trio (which is topped with caviar, piparra, and chorizo), and their Pork Adobo Sliders (braised pork shoulder, Acme baby bun, slaw, sambal aioli). These were probably the best sliders I've had in years. I would come back just for those bad boys any day of the week.\n\nService was top-notch. Friendly and attentive without being over-bearing. All our food and drinks came out in a timely manner. And even though the place was packed and loud, my friend and I were still able to have a conversation without a bullhorn.\n\nI've gotta say... The Treasury has won me over. And judging by the crowds, I'm not the only one.", "author": "Kevin B."}

My colleagues enjoyed the business and finance inspired drinks like Standard Oil and the Glass Ceiling (though maybe that name is borderline sexist?). \n\nVisually, it's a treat, with a gorgeous, long bar beneath chandeliers and a generally sparkly, high-ceilinged interior. We had a high top, around which were circled about 10 of my fellow worker bees. Our server was friendly and efficient, and no one had to wait more than a few minutes to place an order. That doesn't mean you'll be knocking 'em back two minutes after walking through the interior gates. Wine came quickly, but the cocktails took awhile, especially as the crowd grew around 5:30.

The bar shares the lobby of the building with Blue Bottle Coffee and isn't especially large, but does make the best of the space. My only complaint is that the bar curves out at one spot where there is a table placed against the wall. Add in some people sitting at said table, people standing at the bar and servers attempting to move back-and-forth past that point, and, well, I think you get the picture. (Suggestion: move the table.) That aside, the decor of the bar is actually quite appealing.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were waiting for some friends to arrive in the city, so we had plenty of time to explore the menu. We were able to grab a table and a server promptly came over to take our orders. Our server for the evening was extremely nice and attentive: this made a great first impression!\n\nWe mainly stuck to their cocktail menu, but they have some wine and beer offerings in addition to an extensive Sherry selection.  In any case, here's what we had:\n\nCOCKTAILS\n- Shark Tank\n(Cutty Sark 108 scotch whiskey, huckleberry & coconut shrub, absinthe, lemon)\n- Flash \n(Aviation gin, kiwi, cucumber, lemon)\n- Paso de Drake\n(Kappa pisco, fino sherry, Velvet Falernum, grapes, lime)\n- \"AEW\"\n(I.W. Harper bourborn, grapefruit, musovado, basil)\n- Standard Oil\n(Rittenhouse rye whiskey, Dolin rouge vermouth, Drambuie, coffee bitters)\n\nWINE\n- 2011 Peregrine Cabernet\n\nFOOD\n- Half Dozen Oysters\n- Cheese Plate\n- Louisiana Blue Crab Roll\n\nAnd the verdict is...everything was great! Well, my girlfriend finished off the oysters before I could get any, but I'll take that as a rousing endorsement. In terms of food, the crab roll was my favorite. And in terms for drinks, I would pick the Shark Tank as my favorite with the Flash and Paso de Drake being runners-up.\n\nI'm eager to come back to try out the rest of the food/cocktails and possibly dive into the Sherry menu.

I told her bartender had promised me a reserved table when my guests arrived and manager said \"That is not true.\" When we went to bartender to determine who was lying, bartender had nothing to say. Apparently cat got her tongue. After discussing with manager for a moment showing my displeasure, I dropped it as my clients were waiting by the door. Manager took us a cramped table in a tight corner where we had drinks for an hour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-11", "description": "Things I like about The Treasury:\n- The drinks are creative and well made\n- The bar is long (aka plenty of room to saddle up) and service is on point \n- The big windows so you can sit and drink and observe others that are not sitting or drinking and feel superior\n- Music choice is odd yet perfect\n\nThings I really really like:\n- The decor (hello sparkles and metal)\n- They manage to balance being clearly upscale catering to downtown crowd with a supremely chill vibe*\n- The bartenders are knowledgeable + willing to share knowledge, I always end up trying something I have never had before\n\nI really didn't want to use \"vibe\" in this review but couldn't think of a more suitable word", "author": "Kate M."}

They make really good slushies like the blood and bougie. I love that the vibe is sleek and sexy and they play really good hip hop music. It can get really crowded sometimes since the place is pretty small. The bartenders are really sweet and gave us samples of their slushies(so good) and a free shot. Definitely love it here.", "author": "Lisa C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-20", "description": "Upon getting there around 6pm on a Thursday, there was a greeter who was perfect for his job. Super friendly without being phony. When I said I'd wait for my friend outside, he rightfully encouraged me in so I could try to establish a spot. I'm glad he did because it was packed with a 30-something crowd (perfect!) and, it turns out my friend was already inside too. I just couldn't see her because of all the patrons.\nI forget what they were called but the gin drink I ordered came with watermelon/ginger ale (I think) ice cubes, which was refreshing toward the second half od the drink. \nThe appetizer we had was delish: Burratta  (sp?)\nThe owner himself was bussing tables and making friendly conversation and recommendations, as requested. He told us that he had opened several other bars successfully for other owners but this was his first of his very own. He designed every detail - to include the bead at the end of the cocktail skewer and the industrial looking aprons they wore.", "author": "Vanessa A."}
