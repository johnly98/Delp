They have great lunch specials available with entree or curry options while providing soup to start.  I have never been here for dinner, so my comments about the service are for lunch only. \n\nThe lady that works at lunch time is always so nice, and provides great service every time we visit. She gladly brings out the Thai chili condiments, and constantly checks to refill your water.  The ambiance is pleasant, the lighting is dim to create an intimate feeling.  \n\nI have tried all the curries (red, yellow, green, and mango) with the exception of the pumpkin curry.  They are all very good, the yellow curry is mildest while the green curry is the spiciest option. I usually order the Thai samosas as a side, but sometimes order the chicken satay to get extra protein. Never ordered dessert, but they have a few unique options like a dish called \"bomba\" that looks like a coconut ball with some berry filling. \n\nI highly recommend this place if you're craving Thai food, and are near the Marina district.

From the window coverings to the decorative lighting, the interior design contributes to an atmosphere conducive to the enjoyment of your meal. The walls have paintings and Thai artifacts pleasantly distributed in the rather large dining area. The television near the bar seems out of place. Maybe they should kill it. \n\nBoth times I've visited, the service has been slower than other places I've eaten. Even the cup of soup that comes with your lunch took some time to arrive at the table. But, the slow food still tasted great. \n\nThe pumpkin curry I ordered came with soft tofu. It was the consistency of a firm jello. That was nice compared to the soft tofu that typically falls apart in the dish. The tough rind on the pumpkin was cut into serrations and into uniform sizes. It was the consistency of a firm tofu; not mushy at all. \n\nThey serve the freshest coconut in the shell I have ever eaten. The flesh came off the shell easily and in large, tasty bites. It alone would be worth a visit to this restaurant. A definite must have drink. \n\nI normally don't take pictures of my food, but the desert menu looked so good, I had to show it.

The reason I wouldn't give them a perfect score is because a couple of our items arrived to our table at room temperature which was a little discomforting, we had to send it back to have the plate heated up. Why would you want scallops cold in the middle? Other than scallops everything tasted very good.  \n\nFor starters we got the satay chicken, which was perfect besides it not being hot when it got to our table. It was still a little warm but we overlooked it because we were starving.  To share we ordered the scallops with asparagus (was sent back to due to being cold in the middle), Tom yum fried rice (which was full of flavor), and the green curry with chicken. The dishes ranged from $8 to $14 and that felt a little on the pricey side compared to what I'm used to in San Jose. \n\nThe drinks were reasonable, my Sapporo was $3.75 and my friends mango martini was $6 and her drink was delicious. \n\nOverall we had great service, the waitress came back and asked how the food was and refilled our drinks as needed.

The TV shows reviewers certainly blew it up more than they should have unless of course the restaurant was having an off day?\n\nThere were a few of us so we decided to order various items so that we could share and try different areas of the menu. :)\n\nWe ordered:\n\nPineapple Fried Rice\nPad Thai(seafood combo)\nFresh Spring Roll(shrimp)\nHot Basil W/Beef\nBBQ Chicken Plate\nSticky and Jasmine Rice\n\n\nThe Pineapple rice came out in a simple dish... :( \n\nSo I was disappointed in the presentation. On the show and in the menu they show it being served in a half shell Pineapple and this was not the case. :( When we asked the server - They said that they only do that sometimes.. Oh well.\n\nTo detail the actual food - This dish was good. I would reorder this even though the presentation wasn't what I expected. The pineapple chunks definitely seemed to be fresh and not out of a can. They were large and sweet and not soggy or small. We enjoyed this dish.\n\nThe Pad Thai was somewhat small in size but the variety of seafood mix was good. The only thing I would point out on this dish is that it was lacking some of that Thai flavor you would find in a good Pad Thai and that it was unfortunately OVERCOOKED which of course made some of the seafood items slightly chewy.   \n:(  A BIG no no when doing seafood....\n\n\nThe only other issue is that the Sticky Rice was not so stick but extremely hard. \n\n\nAll the other dishes were excellent. So, all in all everything was good but there are a few things that could have went better. I didn't deem these imperfections that bad to complain but on an evening when you are the only people in there you would expect things to go flawless. There were no big distractions to inflict the issues. Either way I am not sure if I will go back since there wasn't really any big WOW factor and the fact that there are quite a few Thai Restaurants in the Bay Area. \n\nAs for the server, She was very nice and very attentive. She certainly was on top of it with the drinks and refilling.\n\nRestaurant location. Right on Lombard and bring your walking shoes. They only have street parking available and with all the Motels and other businesses and Apartments it might prove difficult to find something right in front.", "author": "Rj H."}

However, they showed a pretty big level of disrespect toward a customer (me) so I feel I have no choice but to share a bad recent experience as a warning to future patrons.\n\nLast week I ordered delivery (via Seamless, which is awesome) and Benjarong messed up my order. I ordered Pad Thai with veggies in place of the chicken and shrimp, but still including the tofu. I had to have some protein! When it arrived, it didn't have the Tofu included, so I called to let them know that they had messed up my order and I'd like to either A.) be credited for my meal since it was incorrect or B.) have someone delivery me what I ordered.\n\nThe restaurant was incredibly difficult, not offering to do anything about the mistake and they kept claiming that I had \"already accepted\" the food... as if I was supposed to check that the order was correct at the door. When they finally agreed to do something about it, their offer was to give me a \"$1 credit for the next time I came in\" as that was the price difference of the Pad Thai with Tofu vs. without Tofu.\n\nI was incredibly frustrated that they had made a mistake, and they weren't willing to do anything to correct it. Either delivery me what I ordered, or don't charge me for what you delivered (that was incorrect)!\n\nAt the end, we reached out to Seamless who contacted the restaurant (who still refused to do anything about it). Because Seamless is so awesome, they credited us half the price of the messed up item - which we appreciated.\n\nIn the end, it wasn't about the money, but rather the principle. We've been customers for almost half a decade and you made a mistake - so fix it!

What do you do?\n\nWell, first off, after leaving Wondercon (where I found out how terrifyingly intimidating Lou Ferrigno really is.. he is a scary man) my Papa and I went into Jollibee (which I reviewed after last Wondercon, actually. Aw, nostalgia...). Jollibee was packed wall to wall with boys discussing Iron Man and Proactiv. LITERALLY.\n\nSo, we ran away and hid in the car (I was dressed as a sassy Lara Croft, so, if you can imagine, it was tiny black shorts and a tiny black tank with heels, which is not exactly the best rainy day outfit). We drove around and ended up on Lombard and it was raining way too hard to go venturing too much, so we saw 'THAI' on a window and decided it was acceptable.\n\nUm, acceptable is the understatement of the year. Try amazing.  \n\nFirst off, the decor is absolutely the cutest thing in the world. It is small, there's flowers,and not cheesy, but authentic feeling. The space is small,but not cramped. Its effing adorable.\n\nThe place was completely empty. Well, it was about three on a Sunday, and it was Easter Sunday, and it was raining like crazy, so basically it makes it so it wouldn't be too busy anyways. We walked in and a waitress popped out of nowhere and gave us a table and some iced water. The menu is decently extensive, with the standards (Pad Thai, Satay,Curry, etc) along with some surprises (Three Fish Taste plate, NY Steak?!).  \n\nWe started with the Crispy Wonton (pictured, check it).  It came with a raspberry-vinegar sauce (we think) and it was well excecuted. Not oily or fatty tasting at all, and a good consistancy.  It came in a cute little basket over a bed of wonton crisps.  \n\nI got the chicken Pad Thai (I was way too hungry to think, and just wanted my favorite) and I talked my dad into trying the Choo Chee Avacado Prawns (because I wanted to know what that meant). \n\nUm, YES YES YES. Pad Thai is the greatest food, and this place does it up right.  It was the perfect consistancy, the perfect proportions of noodles, egg, meat, etc, and was cooked to perfection.\n\nAccording to my dad (um, who did not share his Choo Chee Avacado Prawns), his was 'excellent'.  He said that the shrimp, which could very easily have gone wrong, were cooked to perfction and the texture of the sauce was excellent.  Note: this dish seemed hard to describe, which is why we had to order it to figure out what it was, but to get a sneak peak, I posted a picture of it. Also, get it with a side of rice.\n\nIt  was absolutely adorable, excellent quality, and an amazing place.", "author": "Andrea C."}

Even more absurd considering that today I hear a microwave buzzing from the back which should account for shorter cooking times if you're nuking parts of my lunch. \n\nI also do not eat meat or dairy, and while they have a sizable list of options for vegetarians, a few times now I have walked back to my office with beef or chicken and only realized the mistake once it was too late for me to go back. \n\nWith all that said, I do like their food and I will stay a patron, but it seems someone in the kitchen is in la-la land.", "author": "Natalie R."}

Maybe the chef was having a bad day and decided to take it out on my food.\n\nI've ordered Pad Thai a million times elsewhere and have never had a bad experience.

Even if prices were lower, I don't think I could lower my standards regarding food quality, but I've had way better Thai food elsewhere and can't really justify paying to eat here.\n\nWill I be back?

Well I suppose I found one.\n\nTo begin with, Benjarong can't really be compared with Osha. Benjarong is small, a more mom and pop place and there's only one waitress. They also have a \"honeymoon\" table... which I have never in my life seen before. Cute... but probably not practical.\n\nThere were also minute differences in the things I usually order. Benjarong's Pad Thai comes with huge shrimp complete with big tails and they sell coconut ice cream by itself (which they nicely packed in tin foil). Which would have been fabulous, had they not smothered it in chocolate sauce. It was really more of a sundae truthfully.\n\nTaste wise they also can not compare. Benjarong's Pad Thai has a very strange smell/ taste to it. I'd call it ketchupy. Since I usually cannot stop myself from eating the whole Pad Thai plate within an hour, the fact I set it aside and wasn't interested totally makes up my mind for me.\n\nCute place, but the food just isn't up to snuff.

Five of us walked in and were seated by a very nice man who was obviously related to the family who owns the place. Noticed right away that a small collection of prepared to-go orders were waiting on the bar for either pick-up or delivery. The smell of fresh basil frying was in the air... the very cold air. So cold, our host was bundled up in a heavy pea coat and scarf. Not that surprising since it was snowing on Russian Hill the night before (not enough to stick, but snowing none the less). \n\nThe small space that Benjarong occupies is a long and narrow void filled with all kinds of Thai (and Chinese) art knick-knacks and artwork.. The room is dimly lit away from the riser bar area. We had some issues reading the menus, but that was easily overcome. \n\nWe ordered up a chicken laarb to start. It was nicely done, but this type of dish is supposed to be served cold - it came out really warm probably due to the chicken not being readily prepared to serve, so they cooked more. Not too appetizing when you are expecting a cool protein laden salad. \n\nAs mains, we decided to have the red and green curry each prepared with chicken. Our sides were brown and white pearl rice. Also, we ordered Thai Hot Basil with pork and the classic Phad Thai noodle dish. \n\nAll of the mains were very well prepared and it was nice to have three options for rice (pearl, sticky and brown). Unlike many other Thai restaurants, their curries are definitely distinct between them. \n\nThe green curry had a real smoothness to it that crept up on you on the finish providing a feeling of \"I want more of that silky heat\" as the next bite was anticipated. The red curry was a bit bolder up front, but somehow they were able to provide the exact opposite effect as the green - it stood up in your face and stayed there. That's a good character facet that's sometimes either overlooked or over presented by most Thai cooks. \n\nThe Thai Hot Basil Pork was a simple preparation that packed a lot of flavor. Unlike most other Thai restaurants, this version was much less oily and salty than usual. I later found out that they use no MSG in any of their dishes - good to know. \n\nNow here's the reason for a middle of the road rating - the place was like a meat packing house. The heater must have either been broken or not turned on at all. This left for an uncomfortable experience overall - well that and the $2-$3 each higher prices for the same dishes at other Thai restaurants in the area... and $4-$6 more than the Thai restaurants in the LA area. \n\nThe carved and dyed daikon radish decroumontes we a nice touch on the appetizer plates, but quickly became annoying when they came on EVERY dish. Show your diversity, mix it up with other plate decorations... please.\n\nThe service was spot on, just as a good Thai Restaurant should have.", "author": "Leet M."}

Most of the time when I go somewhere and order something spicy, it's still fairly mild. Not so with Benjarong.\n\nThe service was prompt and friendly-- they were attentive, yet I never felt rushed. I was really indecisive and it took me a while to decide because there were so many great options. I ended up ordering the soft shell crab appetizer, and the spicy lamb (one of the night's specials) as a main dish.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the food presentation. Everything was pleasing to look at, and it really makes the place feel much fancier.\n\nThe soft shell crab (appetizer) is breaded in a lightly-seasoned breading and deep-fried. The breading was delicious and crispy, but the crab seemed sub-par. I had to pick my way through it, but the breading, combined with the Thai dipping sauce (a lighter version of the sweet chili sauce plus peanuts on top) almost makes up for it, though. Ultimately, I would probably recommend a different appetizer, though.\n\nThe spicy lamb dish was fantastic. It had just the right amount of heat without being overwhelming. Definitely get some rice to go along with this. The lamb wasn't overcooked, and the vegetables (red and green peppers, onions, ginger, and some large vegetable I wasn't able to identify) were all cooked just right. The portions were also just right, and if you don't have a particularly large appetite, there should be some leftovers to take with you.\n\nI had plenty to eat and enjoyed my time there.

It's a very cute and charming little restaurant and the staff is very attentive and nice.  Everything was well priced. Between two persons of 5'1 and 6'1(weighing in about 275 lbs), we had:\n\n*Calamari (It's a thing to MUST order at every restaurant - looking for the best calamari ever!): The texture of the batter was a bit crunchier than what we were use to.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't OMG either. It was accompanied by a sweet and sour sauce, i prefer an aioli or creamy sauce with my calamari. \n\n*Duck Red Curry:  This is one of the best curries I've had.  It was very rich and velvety, probably from the duck (I agree with Brooke C - could have used a bit more duck meat instead of skin).  Other than that, it was tasty.\n\n*Scallops & Asparagus: I love both scallops and asparagus, so having the two together made me SUPER HAPPY! It was a really good dish, it was a tad saucy but eating it with the rice helped balance that out. If you're not a big onion fan, they do use a lot of it in this dish. \n\nHappy to say we were very satisfied with the meal and did not leave hungry or super bloated.  It's a nice 5 minute walk from where we were and i liked walking home to help digest the meal :)\n\nPros:\n- Decently Priced ($40 / two) \n- Yummy food, would recommend to someone if they are near by\n- Proportions are perfect\n\nCons:\n- Small space\n- Probably not good for a large party\n- Side rice portions are a bit on the small end though (not enough for a 6'1 rice eating guy)\n\nRecommendations:\n- Don't bother with parking, it's hard especially in the Marina.  Go for a nice walk, it's good for ya! :)", "author": "Kathy D."}

Since they are literally just down the block I had anticipated the really good meal that I have had several times at the restaurant. \n\nUnfortunately, that was not the case today. It took over 40 minutes for food to be delivered and we both thought that $40 for three items was a bit high for lunch. Portions were small. \n\nTasty and flavorful, yes. But my coworker thought that the spicy beef with fresh basil should have been better. As he told me he has had much better at other Thai places at a cost much less. \n\nRice included was a very small amount and I did not like the plastic containers. I think plastic containers for the delivery of hot food is not a good idea. The containers were difficult to open. \n\nThe delivery clerk did not give us a receipt. The high price and the fact that it took over 40 minutes to delivery a simple noodle and rice dish did not make a good impression for my coworker. That is too bad because as I said I have eaten at Benjarong several times and enjoyed each dinning experience. \n\nWith this delivery order I was disappointed as was my coworker.

Went in on a Thursday night at about 8:30pm and the place was dead. Only 2 tables of 2 and 4. People are really missing out!

This time, we made a reservation for a Friday night and even by 8pm we were the only people there? I did notice the \"New Management\" sign.\n\nI ordered the Benjarong pan-fried noodles and bf got the \"Asian Otak\" chef suggestion. Our friend ordered fried rice and we also ordered a Tom Yum soup to start with.  I'm no Thai food expert, but have had my fair share of Thai foods and I didn't like the Tom Yum soup here.  It was way too sweet (almost syrupy).  The pan-fried noodles were described as \"stir-fried thick rice noodles\" but they weren't the flat noodles you usually get with like a Pad See-ew.  They were like ramen noodles or yakisoba noodles and mushy, probably overcooked? Flavor was good but the consistently was too mushy. The Asian Otak was a pretty impressive presentation of a banana leaf wrapping a curry-like mix of meat and vegetables. \n\nI'm not sure I'd come back. Despite being the only customers there, the food took awhile and service was okay.", "author": "Emiko M."}

The food was pretty typical for a Thai restaurant, but the atmosphere and food presentation were fantastic - especially considering Thai restaurants usually aren't award-winning in the decor department. We had the fried tofu and Benjarong spring roll with tofu to start - both were excellent and the portions were large enough that we were able to split them among three people. I had the Thai fried rice with tofu for my entree, which was good, but nothing special. However, all the food is presented  really well, with nice, colored garnishes. \n\nThe one HUGE drawback was the service. We were one of only two parties in the establishment and were not attended to very well.

We had desperate need of some Thai, and our usual go-to place was closed for the holiday, so Benjarong made the top of the list. \n\nSince our food was take-out, I'll cut them some slack for the food cooling down on the drive home and settling in at home. However, my girlfriend's beef was borderline cold (not even lukewarm), and my beef was slightly overcooked. The flavors were ok, and they did a nice job on presentation of the food - impressive considering this was takeout and it was a little box. :)\n\nGetting the food itself was slow - when we entered, there were 3 full tables with maybe 15 guests. Unless they had a big rush on take-out or delivery orders ahead of ours, we were quite suprised it took 30 minutes from time of order until it was ready... that's quite a lot for two simple dishes to go, especially since 75% of the tables were empty.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice - great decor, nice ambiance, very cozy feeling. It hits just the right note of classy and downscale. We also liked the little cushioned-seat nook by the bar where people waiting for takeout can sit - it's cool. \n\nAlthough our first experience wasn't the greatest, it wasn't bad. We'll give it another try, probably eating in the dining room next time, so maybe we'll see Benjarong get another star or two from me.

The quality of the meat and vegetables in the Red Curry with Chicken and Panang Curry was very good, and the curry itself was quite tasty. I loved the Tom Kha, but my wife felt that it had too much coconut milk in it that made it too sweet. It was definitely on the sweet side. We were disappointed that the jasmine rice we ordered didn't arrive and we felt it was odd that the curry dishes didn't come with rice, which brings down our review by a star. That said we will order from here again, making sure we get the right rice next time.", "author": "Alexander O."}

It seems to only be a a hit when I've eaten here and mostly crash & burn when I've ordered delivery. Once I called to order delivery and the woman told me I was out of their delivery area, I reminded them they had delivered to my home a week before. Then she told me it was too late for delivery..  Should I even continue? The flashbacks are making me angry. I like their food when you dine in; good Tom Yum and Pad Se Eew. Once my food had so much MSG... I had to take Nyquil to get to sleep.

The staff is friendly, but they really should learn some English. \nI wanted to order a salad, but I wanted to know if they use lettuce to make their salads, because some salads don't. It was a simple question- do you put lettuce in your salads? And the server could not understand my question. Forget it, I'll just order a lunch combo- green curry with chicken. \nWe also wanted to get a lunch combo to go for a friend. But it took awhile to explain that we wanted our food for dine in, but one extra dish to go. But she finally got it thank goodness.\nSo we eat, get our to-to food, pay and leave. When we got back to my friend's apt, he opens up the food to eat. The first thing he asks- where's the rice??\nwhat? No RICE?! How can you forget the rice in a curry dish? Outrageous. Rice is just rice, but what if you don't have a rice cooker at home? I was pretty mad. So I decided to walk all the way back to get the rice and complain. If restaurants mess up on something like that, don't they usually give you a future discount, or free dessert or something?? I was determined to get something. After all, we walked home, had to walk all the back to the restaurant, then walk back home! \nSo when we got back, I complained about the rice not being in the bag, that we had to walk all the way back, and I expect some sort of compensation for this. You know what their form of compensation was? Returning a dollar fifty for the rice. I was pretty confused actually. I've never seen that before. Is that normal? I don't know. I just left the restaurant. There are many better Thai restaurants in the area. I'll opt for one of those, the next time I feel like Thai.", "author": "Jeanie C."}

We had some issues with our waitress understanding our questions.  We wanted to know whether she thought the papaya or the mango was a better in season choice, but instead were treated to a word for word reading of the description on the menu.  Thanks!  Throughout the meal we had to deal with our dirty plates from the soup, salad, longer than we should have.\n\nSecond, the green mango salad was anything but green.  Instead of getting a green mango we had sweet ripe yellow mango.  On top of the salad was the largest soft shell crab I've seen, largely because it was so heavily breaded and burnt to a crisp.  Maybe the last time they changed the oil in the friar Nixon was still the president because it was borderline blackened.  We knew that didn't bode well for the next dish we had coming out, which was the fried chicken over fried rice (yeah I'm addicted to king of thai noodle version so I sometimes try it elsewhere).  \n\n   The fried chicken was the crunchiest and most difficult to dinner item I've had in recent memory.  Again, almost blackened, nothing like the light brown that was portrayed in the menu and so tough and overdone it nearly shredded my throat on the way down.\n\nTwo stars rather than one because it looks nice inside.", "author": "Stephen H."}

One of the girls glanced at us a couple of times and just when I was getting ready to get up and leave she came to ask us for our order.\nI decided to calm down and order anyway, we both ordered curry that didn't even come with rice?? ok, $2 more.\nAfter waiting for what seemed like forever the waiter came out with my bf curry only, saying my plate would be out shortly, sigh, I think 5 minutes later my plate came out. \nMy bf curry was warm, not hot and more on the sweet side but good, mine was hot and pretty tasty.\nOverall food is decent but a bit overpriced given anything you ask for is extra, like rice and extra mushrooms.\nAfter we were done eating we waited forever to ge the check, and then again to get it back. Horrible service and worse is that the waiter has a problem understanding english.", "author": "M J."}

I really wanted to like this place as a friend had recommended it. Decor was cute and our server was very sweet, so I thought we were off to a good start. Boy was I wrong. We had to wait almost 45 minutes to get the first dish and wait 5-10 minutes for each subsequent dish. The tofu yellow curry was OK, but besides tofu, there was nothing else in the sauce. I will admit the coconut rice was great, but the other dishes were lackluster. The hot basil chicken had a nice flavored sauce but I had a few pieces of suspiciously crunchy chicken that discreetly wound up in my napkin. I tasted my friend's pineapple fried rice and even though I can usually eat every grain of rice on my place, one bite was more than enough for me and the same goes for the pad thai. The pad thai was so sweet and thick with peanut sauce that I didn't have more than a few bites.\n\nWith so many other good thai restaurants in the city, I can't imagine any reason to give this place another try.

There's a minimum for deliveries, and rice doesn't come with the meal.", "author": "Sophia D."}

We sat and waited for our server for about 15 minutes before flagging someone down and ordering drinks. We all ordered drinks two cocktails, two beers, and hot tea.  Another 15 minutes later we flagged down the server again and asked if our drinks were coming and ordered our food. So, we are 30 minutes into our time here and we still have not gotten any of our drinks. Finally the server brings two beers and the tea but not the cocktails. Another 15 minutes pass and we are still  short two drinks. Now 45 minutes into our time here we had no food and only half of the drinks we ordered. Finally, we decide to leave and we notify the waitress that it's taking to long and want to leave and she storms into the back all mad. The must frustrating part is that there were 3 people working there and 3 or 4 tables not including us. Overall it was just a really bad experience.", "author": "Ms. G."}
