Their pizzas come in two sizes and my group of 4 ladies were pleasantly full after sharing a starter and the larger size deep dish (2 big slices each). Also great is that Little Star allows you to split pizzas so we could easily agree on what to get. During my last visit, we chose half classic and half vegetarian. \n\nThere were lots of options for great starters and salads, and we settled on the brussels sprouts on my last visit. Everyone enjoyed them and the bacon was a great addition. \n\nFinally, I enjoyed the service. While they were very busy, the waitstaff was all very friendly and, as it was approaching Halloween, they all were in fun costumes. Would definitely recommend.", "author": "Roya B."}

I came here with one other friend and we split this pizza evenly and boy were we full. Even though two of us eat a lot, I'd recommend getting the small pizza if you want to be comfortable after the meal!\n\nBe prepared to wait 15 - 20 minutes for the pizza to come out, but that's what you come here for! Fresh and great deep dish pizza! It was so delicious and had just the right proportion of cheese, toppings and sauce. The crust is absolutely delicious, one of my favorite parts of the pizza and Little Star did it right. It's a crunch, tasty, yet fluffy crust.\n\nThis place is great, I think it's a bit better than Blue Line and a lot better than Patxi's. I'd definitely come back!", "author": "Christopher L."}

Little Star Pizza Valencia is the best thing I have come across in a while. \n\nLocation: Located in the Mission District of San Francisco, near multiple modes of transportation. \n\nThe Interior: Super nice inside.

Great for meeting up with friends or if you want to take someone on a date. \n\nThe Food: To start, we got the asparagus and it was super good. Came with tomatoes and parmesan. From there, we got a deep dish that came with Olives, mushrooms and peppers. It had a name but I honestly can't remember it right now. To top it off, I drank an IPA with the meal and the whole experience was amazing.....and beyond filling. \n\nI don't even have that big of an appetite and I could not stop eating when I was here. 10/10 will be back.", "author": "Chris O."}

If you're feeling hungry, SF's most famous bakery (Tartine) is also a few blocks away and open pretty late.\n\nThe service is top-notch, and I love the decor here. But the location in Solano has better music, dancing workers, more seats, and a bigger bar.\n\nThe pizza is phenomenal. Had the honor of bringing three out of state friends here, and every single one proclaimed the all-star deep dish to be the best pizza they've ever had. Now that was more than I had hoped for. We regretted not ordering a large deep dish, but they were happy with the California thin crust too, which created a great contrast.\n\nI'm really impressed with their deep dish. I haven't been to Chicago, but this place definitely beats Zachary's and the hidden gem Tivoli Caffe, which are both great too. Their pepperoni and sausage are extremely high quality--on par with the sausage I had at the Italian Homemade Company, and the pepperoni is perfectly crisp.

Many vegetarians at this party (including me) and one of the deep dishes is labeled \"Cheese Only\". Two vegetarians went through a whole slice. I bit into a slice and immediately knew there was meat in there. The other two thought it was some exotic vegetable or fake meat because they are not familiar with Little Star. I called the location to complain and was on hold for 10 minutes.

Yesterday evening which also happened to be my birthday (I didn't tell them this) the large deep dish pizza that we got came out sub par.  The crust was hard as a rock, well maybe not rock hard, but I couldn't simply cut through it with a knife.  I had to stab it with a knife and push really hard just to crack through and the crust was more hard cracker like in texture, but obviously much thicker.  It was like crunching on a hard bavarian pretzel on the bottom and the edges.  There were also some black burned looking portions on the top (luckily they didn't taste burned).  We waited a long time for the pizza, probably 45 minutes or more.  They say it can take up to that long, but the dining room wasn't particularly busy, but I guess it was full.  It did seem like they had a ton of take out orders though.  Anyway, I'm just setting the scene here, not complaining about how long the pizza took.\n\nAnyway, we were both sort of disappointed with the pizza, it was obviously overdone.  I usually don't make comments or complain at restaurants, but the disappointed face across from me and the fact that it was my birthday and I was looking forward to having a great pizza motivated me to at least let them know that the crust was really hard and overdone.  I told them that we didn't want to send it back b/c we didn't have time to wait for another one, so we would just keep it and I just wanted to let them know.\n\nWithout any issues they offered to take it off of our bill!  I was shocked and grateful.  They also took off the order of broccolini that we ordered, which was unnecessary and much appreciated.  Wow.  I will continue to be a loyal customer with them having this type of attitude and approach.  I have full confidence that I will be taken care of each and every time I go here.  That is why this is a 5 star review, not b/c of the pizza on this trip, but b/c of the attitude of the staff and restaurant as a whole.\n\nIf the manager is reading this, I just want to say thank you once again.\n\n-Ty", "author": "Ty C."}

Most likely won't be coming back or recommending this location to out of town guests. I had family and friends visiting me and my cousin who is pregnant was craving pizza. I recommended going to Little Star and hyped it up (I've been several times). \n\nWe arrive and NO ONE acknowledges us for a good 10 minutes, now if it were busy I'd understand. There were only 3 tables with patrons. So my pregnant cousin had to ask someone behind the bar for some attention. Finally the hostess comes out, hardly makes eye contact with me and cracks a half smile that's more like an annoyance that we had a large party coming in. I was so close to having us leave by that point. But we stayed. We were a party of 8. The hostess said we had to wait for everyone in the party to arrive to be seated. Literally at this point there's only 2 tables with patrons. You have a pregnant lady wait while you have literally over half of your pizza joint empty. Made no sense to me on a non-busy night. Sorry that's just awful customer service already as if not being acknowledged on a non busy night wasn't bad enough. \n\nFinally everyone arrives. We had 3 little munchkins under the age of 5 with us. We could tell the hostess was just annoyed with us and probably due to having kids there later in the evening. Mind you the kids were well behaved just watching cartoons and eating pizza. I guess this location isn't kid nor people friendly. The hostess didn't seem to like people in general I think. \n\nThe Food Experience: We had Cesar salad, cheese thin crust, Little Star deep dish, and the Italian combo thin crust. Honestly everything was good. A solid 3.5/4 stars. Fortunately I didn't disappoint my family and friends so the pizza met their expectations. Nothing bad to say about the food experience. \n\nI've been to other Little Star locations and I've had a positive experience with the customer service and the food.

I stop by here with a couple friends for my favorite deep dish on the planet. 8:00pm and a half hour wait... No worries though there is a small bar at the front and a waiting area where the time will pass quickly.\n\nOne of the group is stylishly late for the 8pm dinner date and so it was perfect timing for him. My favorite is the classic deep dish \"little star\" pizza. But this time we agree on a deep dish with olives and chicken. Its great as they all are. I think its probably not possible to pick some combination that is less than awesome here.\n\nThis place is refreshing... its not a huge chain like Paxtis... and feels more special when you go as it isn't available everywhere. The people working here are top notch young people that appear to love their jobs - from the hosts to the servers. \n\nAs far as I know the story of little star is of two brothers: one owns all the \"Little Star Pizzas\" and the other owns \"The Star\" pizza in Oakland. I'm not sure of the story but that is rumor on the street.\n\nI doubt there will be any leftovers - but if there is you will all be fighting over who gets to take it home.

I finally got the chance to try this place over the weekend and WOW, I've been missing out. I love pizza in all sizes, colors, and shapes.  Little Star gives you the flexibility to do whatever you'd please with your pizza (flat pizza/deep dish pizza/add custom ingredients/custom sauce/custom cheese...you ask and they'll customize the crap out of it for you.)\n\nFood:\nWe made our own pizza, because well we're picky people. I got a deep dish pizza (SMALL) with: sausage, pepperoni, mozzarella, and basil. You start off with the pizza template for $15, and any additional ingredient is an extra $2. The sausage and the basil are both equal in pricing, which I thought was interesting. I think in the future I will add a bunch of meats and reduce the veggies. Don't tell my mother! But yes, I was amazingly surprised that this pizza spot lived up to its expectations and hype. Such yummy deep dish pizza. I want to come back already and it hasn't even been 3 days!  The size Small was just enough food for 2 people, 2 hungry people.\n\nService:\nWe visited on a Friday night around 8:30pm. Hostess estimated a 25 minute wait...but we were seated in less than 10 mins. Yay! I think a lot of parties give up on waiting or decide to check out other restaurants in the vicinity, reducing the wait time. All the employees from the hostess to our waiter were incredibly friendly and helpful, from asking for recommendations to going out of their way to make sure we had a great dining experience.\n\nAtmosphere:\nLittle Star is a super trendy and hipster place. Lots of thick rimmed glasses, plaid shirts, and wine drinkers. It's a super cozy spot, making it an ideal place for a date. I probably wouldn't do big parties here due to the space limitation, but definitely will be back on a date. I liked that even though the space is limited you can still clearly hear the person sitting across from you, which seems to be an issue in a lot of smaller SF restaurants. \n\nCan't wait to be back for some more pizza!", "author": "Stefany Z."}

We ordered the Caprese Salad, Spicy Chicken Wings, and a small Little Star w/ sausage added. \n\nCaprese Salad: (3/5) the ingredients weren't as fresh as I would have hoped \nSpicy Chicken Wings: (4/5) some of the wings were smaller, but it's great that the appetizer comes with a pound of wings and not a number \nLittle Star w/ sausage: (1/5) nothing compared to the pizza I've had in Chicago.

That corn meal really elevates all pizzas to the maximum though. \n\nIt took a while to get our seat, but they got us taken care of at the bar with beer. Since it's deep dish we expected the pizza to take a while (and it did) so we ordered the spicy chicken wings to share. Pretty good, and definitely had some spice to them (although a single order is possibly too small an amount for 4 people). Like I said above, the pizza was stellar. Pizza cooking can be something of a great equalizer, but with that said, all the ingredients seemed fresh and of good quality.

If I'm not at Pancho Villa for Mexican food, I am here for pizza, salad, and wings. \n\nWe typically have to drive an hour to get into the city and then fight for parking to eat here. If you know how much I hate both sitting in traffic and parking in the city, you know what it means that I will do both of those just to dine here. \n\nWhat can I say? The thick crust is amazing. Even some of my coworkers from other places that have famous pizza say that it is as good or better.  During my latest visit, I finally got to try the thin crust. Wow!  Totally different from their thick variety, and good in different ways. The crust is amazingly crispy, while not being that ultra-thin crust type. Those types don't take toppings well, but the thin crust here stands up to a whole bunch of add-ons. I think we ordered 6 pizzas for our group on this latest visit: thick and thin versions of 3 varieties. I think they were \"old school,\"the  vegetarian, and \"classic.\" We ordered extra so that we WOULD have leftovers. The thick crust holds up really well and makes for tasty leftovers. \n\nDon't miss the chicken wings. Yeah, everyone says that, right? I don't usually eat chicken wings anywhere, but these are special. There is some kind of spicy dry spice on them. They're not breaded, just touched with the spice and served with carrots and dressing. I eat them naked and let the others fight over the sauce and veggies. \n\nThe garlic bread is a sliced loaf of bread with butter and a roasted head of large garlic. You butter the bread and squeeze the soft and tasty garlic cloves onto it. If you've never done that before, don't worry, the cooking mellows the garlic and is is truly wonderful.\n\nThe staff has always been nice, and even when we showed up with a party of 10, the service has been quick and efficient.\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

He didn't smile and I don't know about you but to me you set the mood of your customer you determine if I am going to buy more such as alcohol appetizers or desserts! A smile goes a long way! He never checked up on us! I literally had on cup of water my whole meal! We literally had waiter envy because our counter table had awesome service! Fix that and we would definitely come back and give you guys a second chance!", "author": "Kataz T."}

It was nothing out of the ordinary- just your regular, run of the mill, combo pizzas. We also ordered their roasted broccolini and I actually preferred that over the pizza!\n\nAs for their service, we had the gal with the short, black hair and bangs and heavy eyeliner. She looked annoyed taking our order and given the music is practically blasting in the restaurant, I could barely hear her. She didn't bother bringing out water until we asked for it and even that was a bit of a wait. She also didn't bother to check on us if we needed anything despite the several times she passed by our table.

Although I have bookmarked many San Francisco places to eat, this one was not on my bookmarks list! Luckily, my friend heard great things about Little Star Pizza by word-of-mouth and convinced me to try this hyped up pizza place out for myself.\n\nWe walked in on a rainy day and the tiny pizza restaurant was semi-packed around 4:00PM on a Saturday. The restaurant definitely filled up as dinner time came closer. My friend and I were seated almost immediately. Since it was happy hour (much to our surprise), we took advantage of the Happy Hour Spicy Chicken Wings price as well as ordered a Deep Dish Pizza. Another surprise - we didn't know that we could pick two flavors on our deep dish pizza so we ended up ordering half Little Star and half Classic. While I loved the Classic more and my friend enjoyed Little Star more, both of these different toppings were amazing. What really caught the attention of my taste buds was the delicious deep dish pizza's crust. It tastes similar to one of those delicious breadsticks that a lot of Italian restaurants provide their customers for free, but ten times better. Crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside - yum! Also, our waiter was very funny and friendly as he helped us decide what pizza toppings to order. Price-wise, it definitely is your pricier pizza place but hey, you're paying for quality pizza!\n\nEven when I took a few slices home to heat up as leftovers, the pizza still tasted great! Little Star Pizza, you definitely live up to your hype.", "author": "Michelle S."}

She never checked on us and just wasn't very friendly. Even when she took our menus away, I almost felt like she was snatching them. We ordered - \n\n*Garlic Bread: Before tearing away each slice of sourdough bread, our table did it right and buttered and garlic-ed each side of the slices to let the entire loaf absorb the butter and the roasted garlic. This is garlic bread in its most simplest and purest form and I just loved it.  \n\n*Mixed Salad: A preferable salad option if you don't want greens that are topped with a creamy dressing but a vinaigrette instead. I really enjoyed the addition of walnuts but there was too much red onion that just over powered the salad.  We asked for no gorgonzola cheese based on the dietary needs at our table so I'm not sure if this would have changed the salad flavor. \n\n*Spicy Chicken Wings: The blue cheese dressing dipping sauce wasn't unpleasantly feet-y and went well with the wings. The thinly sliced baby carrots honestly looked a bit sad on the plate. The wings, a bit meager in size and in the serving, were definitely spicy but were very simple, something I felt like I could have made at home. \n\n*Classic Deep Dish Pizza: Just like the garlic bread, I loved it. Everyone at our table agreed that although the large pizza was smaller than expected, you could distinguish each ingredient and the toppings didn't get lost in the sauce. I particularly liked the cheese, and the crust was extra crusty with the added cornmeal.", "author": "Maya S."}

I've been putting it off because whenever I crave pizza, I usually go for thin crust rather than deep dish, but that changed last night. The wait at this tiny restaurant was ridiculously long. We waited nearly an hour for a table to clear. People seem to really enjoy just sitting around and taking their time at this restaurant, despite eating just pizza. Deep dish pizza takes 30 minutes to cook. To avoid ordering appetizers to hold us over, we placed our order before we were seated to cut down on the wait time.\n\nThe two deep dish pizzas to try here are the classic and the Little Star. The classic has your standard sausage, mushroom, green bell peppers, and onion toppings, which makes for a solid pick. The Little Star is a nice vegetarian option with spinach, ricotta, feta, mushrooms, onions, and garlic. Both are great in their own way. The crust was done beautifully and reminiscent of the buttermilk crust that Lou Malnati's does in Chicago.  \n\nWe did try the pesto chicken on a thin crust, which was probably everyone's least favorite. The chicken was dry and the thin crust just wasn't as good. Since we were so hungry by the time we got our food, we were pretty ravenous and ate in silence.

I didn't deal with the ordering or picking up, so this will be a short, pizza-only review.\n\nWe ordered two large pizzas for five people, and this was the right amount of food, with just a few slices left over. We got the classic deep dish and a thin crust with spinach and pepperoni. The deep dish is what Little Star is known for, so the five stars are for the classic pie alone. This was an excellent, excellent pizza, with a marvel of a crust--substantial, crispy, anchored with cornmeal. I've never had another crust quite like it, and would seek Little Star out just to have it again. It was a perfect base for the deep dish filling, a straight-up casserole of sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers, onions, and cheese. I don't tend to love deep dish pizzas, but Little Star's was delicious--I suspect it's the deep dish pizza for people who can't quite go all-in on deep dish pizza. The filling was not as heavy as the Chicago-style deep dish, and I thought it was much more balanced and enjoyable as a result. The acidic sauce kept it compulsively edible, and the crust held its own beneath a serious pile of toppings. I was less impressed with the thin crust. It tasted okay, but the cheese got rubbery pretty fast. I wouldn't bother with the thin crust again.\n\nAt some point I'll have to actually eat at Little Star and sample more of the deep dish pies. It seems to be San Francisco's primary (only?) claim to pizza fame, and judging from the classic deep dish alone, I'd say its reputation is well deserved.", "author": "Steph C."}

It was flavorful, the cheese was gooey and it tasted so good! We ordered the large so we would have leftover. Basically, we ordered two pizzas since we will each have two slices for dinner tonight. Great bargain!\n\nSince we were back near the kitchen and the restaurant wasn't very full, we could hear both the kitchen staff's music as well as the music for the restaurant.

I judge pizza spots based on consistency across the menu, not just their signature item! If they killed it with the thin crust, I for sure know that the deep dish has got to be even better. \n\nIn any case, the pizza was so perfect in every way - filled with a plethora of high quality toppings immersed among a bed of perfectly melted cheese... my oh my were we tantalized. The dichotomous blend of both the veggie toppings and the hardcore meat was overwhelmingly flavorful. \n\nThey also have an extensive gourmet draft beer menu which paired exquisitely with the pizza. \n\nThe ambiance is rustic-classic-casual and a tad hipster given the location in hipsterville (Mission) and the service is great!

Parking is a little crazy as usual, but our perseverance paid off and we got a spot just across the street.\n\nPop in and put your name down, it'll probably be 30 minutes. Maybe grab drinks at the bar, but you should just take a walk down Valencia and check out the hood.\n\nWe got the brass monkey (little star + sausage) deep dish and chicken pesto thin crust. This isn't like the crazy Chicago deep dish that represents midwestern obesity. It's much lighter, with a better balance of cheese-to-topping ratio. The chicken pesto was even tastier, with a huuge amount of pesto goodness. Chicken was pretty dry though (just the way my weirdo cousin likes it). The 3 of us way over-ordered with the 2 smalls -- 1 would have been reasonable. Oh well, just means plenty of leftovers!\n\nStaff was really nice, and they do a good job for such a small busy place.

Little Star can get pretty busy, so you may or may not have to wait awhile to get a table. I love that they have a bar area so you can always get a drink while you're waiting. \n\nThe Spicy Chicken Wings ($13) are so good. They are not messy like other places. Perfectly fried. The Greek Salad was delicious too. Good way to feel healthy (or just less guilty) with all these other fried foods in your table. It was tough for the four of us to decide how much pizza to order, so we order the following flavors. Oh by the way, you can request half your pizza to be one flavor and another flavor for the other half. Great way to experiment with many different flavors!\n\n----------\n\n* Little Star (Deep Dish) - Spinach with ricotta, feta, mushrooms, onions, and garlic. You really can't go wrong with any pizza named after the restaurant. This is probably my favorite one!\n\n* Classic (Deep Dish) - Sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green bell peppers. Exactly what it sounds like. Classic... Nothing special but still good.\n\n* Pesto Chicken (Thin Crust) - Pesto sauce, chicken, mushrooms, and onions. All my friends really enjoyed this, though I found the chicken to be a little dry. \n\n* White Pie (Thin Crust) - Garlic olive oil base, mozzarella, zucchini, tomatoes, and feta. Probably my second favorite next to the Little Star. Great if you're not a fan of tomato based pizzas.\n\n----------\n\nThe pizzas are so fresh and CHEESY. The crust is good enough to eat, which I suppose is saying something. Cool vibe here! Great for groups (as shown by their cakeage and corkage fees) and parties, and there are also personal sized pizzas if you just want to treat yourself.

Both their deep dish and thin-crust are exemplary and will satisfy even the harshest of critics (like me).

Let us start off with the cons since Yelp readers deserve to know what they are getting themselves into.  There are a few things that I did not like about the restaurant itself.  For one, this place has got to violate some type of law regarding maximum occupancy and a pose a fire hazard.  The waiting area is just too small, and combined with the bar area, that is just chaos.  The dining area is small as well, not to mention cramped.  You literally sit next to someone five inches next to you and overhear their conversations.  The last thing that is quite bothersome is the restroom.  There is just one restroom to satisfy hundreds of customers.  Be prepared to wait in long lines before you can use it.  \n\nAs for the food, the garlic bread is quite laughable.  By this I mean we were both expecting some bread with garlic smear or simply garlic bread that was ready to pop in our mouths.  Instead we find \"do it yourself\" garlic bread.  They just give us some bread, garlic cloves, and butter.  I guess we should have expected this when we saw it was only $5.  Haha. The joke was definitely on us.  \n\nThe pesto chicken pizza was quite good.  There was excellent pesto-toppings-dough ratio at work here.  It was a party in my mouth.  Good thing we got this pizza because at first I initially wanted the deep dish.  Then we saw a couple next to us order it and the whole thing was tomato sauce.  \n\nOverall, okay place.

Little Star offers both thin crust and deep dish style pizzas. Whenever I am in the mood for deep dish pizza its always a toss up between Patxi's and Little Star.  \n\nNow what makes Little Star different from Patxi's is the crust. You can taste the difference while both are good  Little Star adds corn meal  to the crust making it crunchier and flakier.  \n\nI always get the deep dish pepperoni and garlic.  I love that they give extra tomato sauce on the side since their sauce is amazingly good. The tomato sauce is made with sweet fresh roma tomatoes which gives the sauce the extra oomph!!! Each bite comes heavy with fresh, layered ingredients over the simple tomato and basil sauce and cornmeal crust.  I savor each bite of this slice.  I can eat two whole slices before my pants start to get tight and I know I need to 1.) slow down or 2.) Stop eating and take the rest home. It never really tastes the same when you take the pie home so me and my friends try to finish the whole thing.\n\nI like the dark wood interiors of the restaurant, the mid-century modern light fixtures and the funky urban atmosphere that lures deep-dish fans to Little Star at the Mission.  I admit I haven't had the friendliest of servers every time I eat here.

We always end up calling about a half hour ahead of time to pick it up.  I've been craving deep dish and it was around lunch time on a Sunday so we were happy to hear that Little Star on Valencia is open at 12 for lunch.  \n\nWe came right when they opened and were seated.  I just felt a bad vibe when I was seated and I saw my glass had like dried tomato sauce stuck on it.  I saw the extra plates, glasses, and utensils to the side so being the proactive kind of girl I am, I replaced it myself.  When I went to the bathroom and saw there was no toilet paper!  I told one of the hostesses this then she went to go find some and put the humongous roll on top of the toilet.  Did my business then I saw there was no soap!  So, I told the other hostess of this and she apologized, and said \"I'm sorry, I guess they didn't do their job.\"  Finally a guy replaced the soap in the bathroom.  I know this has probably happened to other people at other dining establishments but I just can't stand when stuff like this happens because missing bathroom items just gross me out because it's so unsanitary!  \n\nAnyways, I don't know if it's just me, but I thought my beloved Brass Monkey tasted better in previous occasions when we get it to go from the other location.  3 stars for the good Brass Monkey & $1 off his beer for HH.

Quite possibly, the best choice I could've that night! \n\nWe started off the night in this particular order:\n\n1. the Garlic Bread - a warm sourdough loaf served with whole roasted cloves of garlic and a side of butter. This is the real definition of garlic bread!! The garlic was raging profusely with aroma and the butter was warm and spreads...well, as smooth as butter. Definitely an awesome way to start the meal. \n\n2. the Spicy Chicken Wings - it's rather rare for me to order wings from places that usually don't specialize in them (ie: Alondra's, Wingstop, etc.), but there are places that surprise me, like Boiling Crab. Who would've known their wings were awesome?? But I digress... This place definitely has some memorable wings on the menu. I didn't really touch the blue cheese dressing because the flavor was right on. Semi kick of spicy and a whole lot of flavor... borderline almost Cajun like. Recommended? Yes. \n\n3. the Little Star Pizza - as my first time here, come on... I had to. Well, I have to give the credit to my bud Heather for putting this on the table for me. She also added sausage into the mix, which made it the wonder that it was. Along side of that was spinach, mushroom, garlic, and onion all drowning in their savory tomato sauce that was covered in ricotta and feta cheese. I'm not a huge fan of deep dish pizza, but I'm a fan of this one. \n\nAll in all, the experience was pretty nice. A dimly lit ambiance to set the mood if you're on a date or just a nice spot to hang out with couple buddies. Either way, you'll see me here again. \n\nWORD OF ADVICE: Get the rootbeer!!!

It's not like I'm reviewing a kefir-concoction from Bar Tartine that I'll only eat once in my life and can only base my opinion on one impression.\n\nWe ordered a salami flatbread pizza and the classic Chicago deep dish. I only ate the deep dish pizza and this is what I thought:\n\n* Temperature: even though we waited long enough that you thought the pizza was being made fresh, it came out at room temperature. While I don't want a pizza so hot the cheese turns into lava, I still want it to be hot. This wasn't. They probably let it cool down way too long, even though the place wasn't busy when we ate.\n\n* Sauce: terrible. My friend, who comes here often, said it was tastier than Patxi's sauce, so I can only imagine what that tastes like. He said the sauce here was heartier, with less sweetness. I think it tasted like a room temperature jar of Barilla pasta sauce that was dumped on top. Really disappointing flavors: the tomatoes had that stiff bite that only canned tomatoes seem to have, and the chunkiness gave it a mealy mouthfeel akin to frozen grapes. I've had great pasta sauce, so I know you can definitely develop a deeper, layered flavor with just a simple tomato sauce. This sauce is what turned me off to the entire pizza.\n\n* Crust: disappointing. The crust lacked enough oil, so it was dry. Since there is very little cheese and the sauce is so -- hmmm fresh? -- the crust should have been oiler to help balance the pizza out. Instead, it had the consistency of old graham crackers and the taste of day-old pizza crust. Some people like day-old pizza crust, but I only like it when the pizza is actually a day old. The crust could easily be improved with a little more oil or fat brushed onto it, better kneading to produce a flakier, lighter crust, and being served hot, which always makes crust soft and delicious.\n\n* Cheese: cheese was tasty and really gooey, almost like you could wrap it around the globe without it breaking. That's a great cheese experience.\n\nService was excellent and the waitress was really warm-hearted. Maybe I caught them at an off-hour for their kitchen, but I probably wouldn't come back here again. The quest for good Chicago deep dish continues...", "author": "Erol A."}

This is probably one of the most hyped up pizza places I've ever been to. There was about a 45 minute wait on a Sunday night.\n\nMy friends and I opted for 2 pies:\n1. Little Star (Spinach, ricotta and feta, mushrooms and onions). \n2. Classic (Sausage, mushrooms, onions and green peppers)\n\nOverall they were both pretty good. However, Little Star puts their own unique twist on their recipe, adding in cornmeal into the dough. This gives it a little bit more crunch than traditional deep dish pies but I found at times it was a little too dry for my taste. I'll have to come back and try the thin crust one of these days...", "author": "Calvin H."}

That being said...its not the BEST ever, just the best for the area. They use cornmeal in the crust, or on the baking surface, so there's a bit of extra crunch to it. That being said...I'm not sure how much I like the cornmeal texture to my pizza. I kind of want just a GOOD CRUST, you know? No extra stuff to try to make it more crunchy. \n\nThey're well known for their little star, I guess. I keep hearing about it from people. I'm somewhat of a carnivore when it comes to pizza, so their menu staples aren't very enticing. I often add meats to the Little Star or something. \n\nI haven't come during a busy time (usually around 1), so I've never had to wait in line for it.

It was evil, but evil in a good way, like Darth Vader or Tony Soprano. Despite being evil, you love them or these foods nonetheless.\n\nThe great debate of thinner crust compared to deep dish isn't even a comparison for me.  In deep dish the main attraction has got to be the sauce. In the thinner crust the cheese is the main attraction. Both good, but just totally different to me. \n\nThat being said, before the main event I asked to have a slice of the homemade cheesecake. I must say its a nice, soft, creamy goodness. Not at all overwhelmingly rich like some cheesecakes. Just right. One of the best i've ever had.\n\nNext came the wings. Not the traditional buffalo sauce wings that I admit, I love. But a nice change of pace. Savory, spicy, dry rub, favor filled wings. \n\n25 minutes later my reason for coming to Little Star arrived.  Deep dish pizza can be a thing of beauty. But does it taste as good as it looks? Not having a lot of experience with deep dish pizzas, in my opinion, the sauce was tasty, had good tasting toppings, along with a crust that held the pizza together with a solid cornmeal taste. \n\nWhen ordering a diet coke, the waitress told me they served Virgil's cola which is an organic version of coke.  I also noticed the salad is served as organic.  And while I'm very conflicted in my feelings towards things organic. I'm unconflicted in my love for the food at Little Star and my intentions to return for more guilty, evil, awesomeness.", "author": "Michael L."}

I'm not sure why I enjoyed it so much more than my usual Patxi's dose, but here are my guesses: LS has a \"juicier chunkier\" tomato sauce, LS's pizza came out hotter, with the cheese more fully melted, LS's cheese might have been saltier (the secret to all good mozzarellas!), and LS used kalamata olives (see previous salt comment).\n\nDespite my expectations that the pepp / olive side would \"win,\" the sausage / shroom side was the winner for me.

The only thing I would say is that per the portion size of the salad it could be a little cheaper (a large will not really feed a family of 4, so good thing we only had 3). A large pizza will feed 4, but is a little pricey at $29. Also the Pinot noir choice in house could have been better. Maybe I'm just spoiled by the price's at Lou Malnati's in Chicago haha.

The tables are set very close to each other against the wall so there might be a bit of a struggle to get out after stuffing yourself with pizza. They dimmed the lights around 6:30PM because everyone knows gourmet pizza is the most romantic meal of this American lifetime.\n\n- Mediterranean Chicken (deep dish): There was not that much chicken (not sure I could identify this as Mediterranean-inspired either), but the artichokes and onions added texture to the saucy concoction that is deep dish pizza. The cornmeal in the crust is also very noticeable and a unique touch (grainy texture, but not in a bad way).\n\n- White Pie (thin crust): Our waiter sent back our first pie because he said \"Something about it didn't look right. We have very high standards for our pizza!\" Thanks, kind waiter with a mustache! The vegetable (zucchini & tomatoes) and cheese combination is just the right amount of flavor, but I wish the crust was slightly thinner.\n\nTwo small pizzas (~$18-20 each) between the two of us were more than enough; we finished the deep dish and took home 2/3 of the thin crust.

Figured if there was room for them to accommodate us, we'd be able to do that. But no. While the restaurant was half-empty on this Sunday night, the hostess with the big attitude said there was some rule about not being able to eat there once the food was ordered to go. We asked why. No real answer... something about it being a policy of theirs. I went up to the bar where we were told to pay for the meal and asked the person manning the bar if there was any way an exception could be made. He said that if there was room at the bar, we could eat there. There was no room at the bar and no sign of space opening up for our party of four, so I asked to pay right away so that we could take the food out as soon as it was ready. We waited. And waited. And waited. Over a half hour later (an hour and a half after placing the order) and hungrier and more tired, I approached the bar again. After waiting a good 5 minutes for someone to arrive behind the bar, the same guy came back. \n\n\"Where is our food, please?\" \n\"Oh, I thought you were waiting for a space at the bar to open up.

But, I will admit that the cornmeal crusts are a love-it-or-hate-it kind of thing. I find them reminiscent of croutons: airy, crunchy, and almost cookie-like in texture. Personally, I like this more than I do regular crusts (which I'll often toss away), but I know a fair number of people who dislike it, and/or consider it too \"healthy\".\n\nNot that they don't suffer from a slight saltiness problem though. While the flavor is great, and the first slice is usually fine, the salt starts creeping up on you by the time you hit your second or third piece. Fortunately, I'm usually comfortably full after a single slice, so this becomes a somewhat moot issue for me.\n\nWaits can be a bit long around dinner time, with my longest having been almost 45 minutes. Pro tip: order in line about 30 minutes before you're to be seated. That way, your deep dish pizza will be there to greet you by the time you sit down at your table!\n\nIf you'd rather wait, or manage to be seated quickly, and want an appetizer, the garlic bread is a popular, and interesting, choice: a loaf of sourdough is served alongside butter, and an entire glove of roasted garlic, resulting in a DIY garlic bread of sorts.", "author": "Johnny W."}

My friend and I agreed it was a solid B/B+, using Zachary's as the gold standard for deep dish pizza in these parts. Perhaps this is unfair, but it was a tough Monday at work and we felt vindictive and deserving of pizza at the same time. Also, we once dressed up as ninja turtles and fought in the Valentine's Day pillow fight together, so one must trust the judgment of their hero-on-a-half-shell comrade-at-arms. \n\nThe tomato sauce had more of a chunky stewed tomato thing/less of a rich sauce texture than I prefer, and the crust was on the lighter/drier side. Toppings were tasty and fresh - we had the classic and added whole garlic- never a bad idea. Overall, pretty satisfying if you can't make the trip up to Rockridge. Put it this way - I wouldn't wait an hour in line for this pizza, but I'd probably crawl through mud and sit in a puddle for 46 minutes for Zachary's.\n\nService was quick and friendly, and it didn't take long for our food to arrive.", "author": "Selina K."}

The pesto in the Pesto Chicken has a nice thickness to it, and is swirled around your thin crust pizza topped with chicken, onions and mushrooms. Not too filling, but delish!

So, it should come as no surprise that I was willing to endure a trek to the city, a 30-minute parking hunt and an additional 30-minute baking time to taste a recreation of the famed Chicago deep dish \"throw that Brooklyn cardboard away\" pizza. \n\nThe restaurant itself delivers a dimly lit, but pleasant ambiance within a small space. The menu is quite straightforward with a small selection of appetizers (salads/breads) with a decent enough drinks' list to pair well with your choice of pie. However, due to the long cook time, I was slightly miffed they didn't have a more appropriate selection of appetizers. If I am about to delve into a gargantuan monstrosity of cheese, bread and sauce, I do not want to whet my appetite with MORE bread (looking at you garlic cheesy bread).\n\nOnto the pizza itself, it is covered in a thin layer of their tomato sauce under which lay oodles of nice mozzarella cheese and toppings ranging from vegetables to different meats. As with other deep dish pizzas, after the initial tasting, you start to hit only one note of flavor. In this case, that note was a good one, easily taking care of my craving and leaving me relatively full. \n\nHowever, now we arrive at my disappointment, the crust! It tastes like cornbread. Not only that, the amount of cornmeal used has probably rendered it a bit too flaky allowing it crumble from the weight of a slice.\n\nIs it possible to be unhappy with a four-star place? No, but with Little Star's famed pizza came a little disappointment (pun intended).

So of course I had to stop by and see for myself what all the fuss was about. As soon as I walked inside, a familiar smell greeted me at the door. What was it? OMG! It was Pi, one of my favorite pizza places back in St. Louis. And then it dawned on me - this IS the same pizza as Pi, just a different name.\n\nThe owner/founder of Little Star sold his delicious cornmeal crust recipe to the owner of Pi in St. Louis a few years ago. They have some sort of agreement in regards to who can make the pizza in which state. Little Star obviously has dibs on California and Pi in St. Louis. I think Pi also has a location in Washington, D.C., but don't quote me on that one...\n\nAnyhoo, I was elated to taste something delicious and familiar on that fated evening back in February.

It was super light with a very fresh mix of arugula and other leafy greens. The walnuts added an excellent, but subtle nutty flavor and when paired with the gorgonzola...seriously, amazing. We ordered a family size to ensure that everyone got their fair serving of veggies for the day, but we easily cleared the plate without resistance.\n\nFor the pizzas, we were a little torn. Most of the reviews on here pointed to the deep dish pizza as the favorite, but my family definitely loves the thin crust just a little more. We settled on two pizzas: the small (9\") classic deep dish and the large (12\") white pie.\n\nThe classic deep dish was good. The cornmeal crust added the perfect texture to the substantial filling of sausage, mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers. My brother felt that the tomato topping was overbearing on the other flavors though. He also remarked that it tasted better as a leftover the next day.\n\nThe white pie was excellent. The fresh zucchini and tomato slice topping added a burst of flavor to every bite...and the feta cheese added an extra little twist to each bite that had it. The crust was light and again meshed well with the flavors of the pie. The only complaint we have about this one was that it was definitely on the oily side. \n\nWe washed down our pizza by trying a ginger beer. It's not housemade, but it was still interesting to try. There is a heavy, but not overbearing, ginger flavor and it made for a good palate cleanser between the two pies such that we could really distinguish the flavors. We were excited to find out that we could buy it at our local BevMo too.\n\nThe ambiance in the restaurant is very cool. A bunch of small tables are lined up on one side against one long bench.

Great ambiance for a Pizza place but that is the only thing it has going for them.  Their Pizza is hands down one of the worst I have ever had.  I did both their Pan Pizza and the thin crust.  The Pan pizza was just a bunch of ingredients that tasted like it came out of a can and poured onto some pie crust.  It was totally tasteless!!  Their thin crust pizza had the weirdest texture and was overly dry and bland.\n\nNever again.", "author": "Gardell T."}

I had the chicken wings, which I really love. They are \"spicy\", but I find them more so flavorful, I like hot things and it only had a bit of a kick. I had a deep dish pepperoni & sausage pizza, which was good. Not sure if it is just the leftovers, but I found my leftovers a little on the salty side.

Anyway, I'll have to venture to the western addition chain with skeptical eyes at some point to see what the fuss is all about.\n\nOnto the FOOD. Go to little star if you're craving fanciful deep dish pizza. with only 5 different options for deep dish pizza, and a handful of options for thin crust pizza their small menu boasts delicious eats. I appreciate small menus though so perhaps it's just me. Expect to pay $23-26/deep dish. $4-10 for beer or wine.\n\nWe went on a saturday night around 845pm. We expected to wait a good 45 minutes (after hearing about the horrendous lines) but got seated immediately (be jealous). I wish they had better beer and drink options and think they should add a special homespun drink to the menu like basil lemonade or something! But overall the experience and meal was good for the price/quality. \n\nI really enjoyed our table in the small, intimate restaurant setting and super trendy servers and bartender. Deep dish takes 30 minutes to serve (it's a pie after all) so be wary. We were interested in trying the goddess pesto salad but at $7....how special could it be. We ordered half classic/half brass monkey. It came out. I was wary about having too much feta in the pie. It. was. delicious! And it really hit the spot. I appreciated the crust for its yeasty-taste and simplicity (with cornmeal yum) since it really complemented the \"innards.\" And yes they taste entirely different--class vs. brass so I highly recommend trying half of each.\n\nWill I go again?

Hungry and helpless, we looked around for a spot to hang out and wait in the crowded waiting room. Lucky for us, we found a teeny little spot by the bar. Here's my question Lucky Star, if the hour wait is frequent, why not condense the waiting area and expand the dining room? There's no point having a waiting room as big as the dining room!\n\nBeing close to starvation when we finally got seated, we ordered 4 pizzas between the 4 of us-- the Little Star Special, Classic, Mediterranean and the thin crusted Chicken Pesto. At first bite, I can instantly taste the freshness of the tomatoes. Yum! Without a doubt, the Classic was my favorite but the Chicken Pesto came in a close second.\n\nOur waitress was not particular friendly or welcoming-- perhaps she was tired.

Little Star is the best followed by Patxi's and then Zachary's. My comparison is not just the crust but the taste and the texture.  Don't argue with me Zach fans.  That was my experience and this is my review, not to mention great service at LSP too  ;-)\n\nLet me put this out there: I'm not a fan of deep dish pizzas because there isn't room in my waistline for extra carbs but I love the deep dish at LSP.  My favorite is the signature deep dish \"Little Star\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OoyK7MyuPtKOQAXmEmyM5g?select=9HMyOflMsp1bUXoMLEdjUw) It came with spinach, onions, mushroom, garlic, feta and ricotta cheese, and I usually add pepperoni.  The crust was made with cornmeal so it's not heavy and doughy but always crispy and never greasy.  The tomato paste had a balanced tang to it, not sour nor sweet.  And OMGosh the combination of cheeses were the perfect blend, gooey and stringy even if the pizza cooled down.  I had it the next day and it was still gooey and tasty.  \n\nWhy I don't like Zachary's:  cardboard crust made with flour, undercooked fillings that was heavy on the tomato sauce so it was sour and runny which made the center soggy, and the cheese became hard when we didn't eat the pizzas fast enough.  \n\nI also want to add a few words to those who say the best deep dish is found in Chicago.  Let me break this to you....this is the Bay Area.  Unless you plan to fly to Chicago each time you crave for a deep dish, I suggest you choose the best that the Bay Area can offer.  And the best is Little Star Pizza.  \n\nFYI: East Bayers who don't want to come to SF for LSP, well you lucked out because there's one down the street from Zachary's.", "author": "Hannah C."}

The well dressed vegetables were fresh and the crushed nuts sprinkled on top added the perfect texture to the salad to make it lively.

We ended up not being able to, so he promised me we'd go on January 2. Yesterday, he found out that he had to go back to University on January 2, so we changed it to New Years.\n\nWell, Delfina was closed on New Years, so we decided to hit this joint instead!\n\nWhen we got here, the place was jam-packed! No seats, loud chattering, drunk men singing-- you get the picture. We went to check-in, and were told we'd have to wait 25 minutes. My friend and I kept standing up to peek at empty tables and stared at each other in sadness. A man handed me the menu, so I spent a good amount of time fantasizing about and contemplating each item. We ended up waiting for a little over 40 minutes.\n\nBy the time we got to our seats, we knew exactly what it was we wanted. The waiter took a little over forever to reach us, and because we came on a completely empty stomach, every minute felt like an hour and every hour felt like a day.\n\nI sat there as my hunger was slowly mutating to neuroticism. I sat at my table, all shifty eyed and soft mumbles. I may seem small, but do not be fooled: my inner chupacabra was waiting to be unleashed!\n\nWe ended up ordering the Garlic Bread, Spicy Chicken Wings, and a deep dish pizza (half Little Star, half Mediterranean Chicken).\n\nI was impressed by the garlic bread. Not by the taste, but by the innovation. They give you steamed(?) garlic that you get to spread onto your bread, along with a huge cup of butter-soft butter. The garlic didn't have an overpowering taste, which was nice. However, that might have been because I drowned each slice of bread with 4 tablespoons of butter.. Ohhhh, butter! The bread was rather difficult to cut/slice, so we ended up having to rip it off. That made me question the freshness a bit.\n\nThe spicy chicken wings were great! No match for Wingstop, but definitely better than any other chicken I've had! It's hot, but not hot to the point where I'm crying my eyes out and drinking water out of the vase. I didn't really try the bleu cheese dressing, because God knows I hate bleu cheese.\n\nThe pizza was the best deep dish pizza I've ever had! Better than Zachary's, better than Patxi's!! By the time we got the pizza, I was already stuffed. I ate most of the the chicken wings, and he ate most of the garlic bread. I liked how they didn't go overkill on the sauce like some other places (often when I picked up a slice of pizza from Zachary's, the sauce would fall off). A balance of toppings and tomato sauce allowed me to taste the ingredients. The crust was \"WOW, PARTY IN MY MOUTH\"! Soft, buttery, cornmeal crust.... WOW! If I could just come here to order crust, I would!\n\nWe ended up preferring each other person's pizza choice, which was funny. I thought the Little Star's garlic taste was a bit too strong. We cleaned off everything so that we wouldn't have to carry anything home. My stomach felt like it was going to explode, so I had to burp a couple of times to finish my pizza. Good stuff! (:\n\nI really, really wish I could have given Little Star Pizza 5 stars. The waiting almost killed me. I can understand, though. Little Star Pizza seems to get tons of customers (there were still people waiting for tables at 9pm!). So I guess, 4.55 stars?\n\nI will probably wake up 10lbs heavier tomorrow, but that's the least of my worries!", "author": "Elaine N."}

It came with a bulb of roasted garlic and creamy butter both on the side to accompany the fresh piece of sourdough.

So the 6 of us, including a 5-year-old child decided to head to the Divisidero location for dinner on Sunday night (Dec. 30). When we got there, there was a 1 hour 30 min wait, which is hard to do at night with a small child. \n\nSo I called this location (Valencia) to inquire about the wait and the guy on the phone said 10-20 min for our party.  We then went all the way to the mission, only to enter the door and have the host tell us there is a 1 hour wait. We told them what the guy on the phone had told us and the host said, \"Sorry, I don't know who told you that because we aren't supposed to give quote times over the phone\". It was very frustrating to hear this after going all the way from nopa area to the mission and with a tired/hungry 5-year-old. \n\nI am not giving it one star because it had a long wait. But 1 star because the host staff obviously does not know what they are doing. I work in a restaurant myself and I know that the staff should have handled this in a different manner and whoever gave us that \"10-20 minute\" quote for a table should learn that giving the totally wrong quote time is not going to make any customers happy.  \n\nSorry Little Star, you are starting to lose your edge and it is hard for me to recommend you when the staff is so unorganized.", "author": "Juliana K."}

However, I picked up a pesto chicken pizza from the Divisadero location, and it was simply not as tasty.

The pesto was not as punchy and garlicky, and they dared to put red bell peppers on our pizza. WHY?!\n\nThey messed with something that wasn't broke.

I don't think so. \n\nB -- S\n-- Found parking during the day! woohoo\n-- Felt like servers don't look where they're walking, I had to avoid them twice because they were not paying attention\n-- Nice to have the ability to fill up our own water, I guess lol\n-- Garlic bread was disappointing =/\n-- Deep dish was just ok *read below why*\n-- Table next to us had thin crust & it looked delicious!\n-- No ranch?! Thank God for the liquor store across the street\n-- Didn't cost an arm & a leg!\n\nI bookmarked this place because it's so highly rated. The GF & I came here on a Saturday afternoon. We found parking on 15th & it wasn't super packed or anything. About the servers not paying attention: I just don't really think they were \"all there.\" I'm not trying to be a jerk but when you're not paying attention to where you're going & I have the walking right of way, you should stop. Instead I stopped to be nice but two times, really?\n\nWe knew the deep dish was going to take time so we got their garlic bread. I did say garlic bread, I read garlic bread and ordered \"Garlic Bread.\" What did we get? We did get warm, delicious bread with a side of butter and some roasted garlic. If I just wanted butter & bread, this would have been awesome. The roasted garlic was mediocre. I ate a whole crap load of it and it wasn't even that \"garlic-y\" and was just disappointing.\n\nWe ended up ordering a L deep dish with chicken, spinach and garlic. I'm really glad we got regular garlic even though our server almost got it wrong when she repeated it back to us. The pie itself was pretty good. The cornmeal crust was decent. The sauce was a bit tangy and really, really a bit too much \"tomato-y\" for me. I NEEDED SOME RANCH badly to battle the tomato overload. I was very disappointed that they didn't have ranch. Luckily the liquor store kitty corner to Little Star did! The ranch saved the pizza and the meal for me. I will say that the quality of the chicken was top notch on my pizza.\n\nWhen I compare Little Star to Zachary's, it's very similar minus the fact that Zachary's has delicious ranch & they don't use cornmeal. Their sauces are very similar, both have chinky tomatoes. My recent favorite deep dish winner, however, is Patxi's! They have a much more chewy & flaky crust that also has cornmeal. I can't say that Little Star lives up to Patxi's but is similar to Zachary's. I would like to try their thin crust and might be seeing that in my future soon.", "author": "Daniel D."}

The mixed Salad was pretty good, it wasn't heavily drenched in dressing which was good and the salad tasted very light and airy. Finally, our Classic Deep Dish Pizza.

We were about to order 2 pizzas, one of each but thanks to our waitress, turns out you can do a half/half pizza.  Yay me!  Best of both worlds.  OMG!!! I love love love the Little Star flavor.  The veggies all blended together with amazing flavor and the garlic!  I think all pizzas should have garlic.  The ricotta cheese and the spinach was a great combo with enough sauce so the pizza wasn't dry.  The Classic was good too but the name says it all, it's your good old, trusty, boring toppings.  The tomatoe sauce that was used really complemented the pizza.  It wasn't too sweet or sour.  Perfectly balanced.  \n\nBut that's not all folks!  You have to get their Spicy Chicken Wings!  They aren't saucy at all which I liked.  They were seasoned, fried and delicious!  A whole pound too!

It is freakishly delicious, with a great balance of cheese and veggies. Best of all? It reheats well too.\n\nIt does take them a little while to make, so don't make the mistake of arriving already starving.

The order was ready five minutes ahead of schedule, and the pickup procedure was great.  Additionally, the food tasted amazing.\n\nMy only real criticism was in the description of the dish. We ordered the Mediterranean Chicken pizza, and there was hardly any chicken in the dish at all. There must have been about one chicken breast used in an entire large pizza. The dish would have been an amazing vegetarian pizza if it had been billed that way, but the chicken was so sparse, that I almost forgot it was an ingredient, surprising me each time I got a bite (which was about one bite per slice).  If the title of the dish had not featured chicken, this would have been fine, but since it did, I was let down.  \n\nThe pizza was good, but it appears as though they are heavy on the veggie toppings and skimp a little bit on meat toppings. Just something to think about.", "author": "Evan R."}

I'm not sure I'm a fan, but I couldn't deny the deliciousness of Little Star's cornmeal crust. Every thick-crusted pizza should be made with cornmeal dough. My one stipulation was that the base of the crust could have been a little thicker as its toppings were making the middle soggy.\n\nI thought that the ambiance was quite nice -- but I was lucky to go to Little Star during an odd hour past normal Saturday lunch time. This allowed me to avoid the infamous San Francisco dining crowds that tend to ruin all dining experiences. My friend and I got a seat by the window and enjoyed watching the Saturday pass us by. I was also impressed that their Happy Hour discounts for their alcohol started as early as Saturday afternoon.\n\nAll in all a very pleasant experience, but I'm not sure if the food would be worth the regular crowds. Also, I find it slightly disconcerting that they only scored a 95 or something on their health inspection card. Where are those other 5 points? A restaurant of this much talk should not settle for anything less than 100!", "author": "Michelle L."}

And, it was definitely worth the wait.\n\nFOOD:\n*Mixed Salad (mixed greens, w/ gorgonzola cheese and chopped walnuts): I heart gorgonzola cheese, so I enjoyed how it added a great punch to the salad. Everything was fresh and well balanced; the vinaigrette had a perfect balance of citrus and oil. I liked how the walnuts were toasted which added a great crunch and nutty flavor.\n\n*Goddess Salad (romaine lettuce w/ pesto vinaigrette and beets): The crisp romaine was gently tossed in the fresh pesto vinaigrette. The basil flavor wasn't too strong and had a faint nutty undertones from the pine nuts.   \n\nBecause the deep dish does take longer to prepare 30-40 minute, if you're starving, it would be best to order an app or salad. \n\n*Little Star (spinach blended with ricotta, feta and mushrooms): I LOVE Spanakopita, so naturally I thought I would enjoy the Little Star; I did and then some. Let's start with the crust...I normally veer away from dish pizzas b/c if not done right, they can be soggy. LSP deep dish's bottom crust was hearty, crunch, and held up very well to the filling. The cornmeal had a slightly grainy texture that a added a bite to the crust. The outer crust was crispy on the outside and pillowly soft in the inside. The filling was FRESH--the spinach was cooked perfectly and maintained a vibrant green. There was a good ratio of ricotta and feta, so the cheese didn't overpower the entire filling. With salad and beer, one slice was pretty filling.\n\nOverall, the food quality is awesome at LSP b/c all the ingredients are FRESH, FRESH, FRESH!\n\nSERVICE: There are no reservations, so it's first come first serve. On a Sunday night for a party at 7, the wait was about 25-30 minutes. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, so no complaints.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: LSP is a pretty small restaurant. Upon entering, there is a small bar area that you can eat at. The main dining room probably seats 35-40. Red brick walls surround the place and is decorated by contemporary paintings. Only complaints are the creaking wooden floors and the place and get quite loud. \n\nWill definitely come back again, but will hit up their Divis location since it's closer to me.

Haha.. yes, I said it. And which one is better? Hmm.. I'm thinking Little Star Pizza wins. Why? Because of its cornmeal crust. That extra crunch at the end of your slice of pizza is a nicely added texture. Also, I think Little Star Pizza has just the right amount of sauce and pizza filling, so it's not overwhelming and dripping all over your place (which happens sometimes with Zachary's). \n\nAnyway, for a party of 4, we ordered two small deep dish pizzas and a salad to start.

The wait was pretty long (we were quoted 45 minutes but  really waited about an hour for a table for 2.) When the crowd gets crazy in the lobby, the bartender takes out a sample pizza and kind of calms down the crowd so I was fortunate enough to try a slice of their White Pie. \n\nThey have 3 beers on tap, a limited amount of red and white wines but it's their champagne that makes their drink list fun. When we were sat, I immediately ordered a Hey-Koolaid from our fabulously efficient and pleasant server and was tickled pink by the cherries on the bottom soaked in the champagne. \n\nWe had the buffalo wings rubbed in a spicy rub and baby carrots followed by a Classic DEEP DISH pizza. This is not a sad pathetic attempt at Deep Dish, nay, this is actually passable for the pizzas of my fond youth in Chicago so I'd proudly polish these pizzas again and again. We ordered the Classic with roasted garlic to give it a little pizzaz and I was not disappointed! I'm sure their thin crust is awesome too but it's their Deep Dish that's gonna get me coming back regardless of a 45+ minute wait. \n\nTheir cheesecake is homemade and when served with chocolate sauce, it became MAGIC. The only thing I'd want to add to it is maybe a little raspberry sauce but that's just me.

Screw it, BOTH.\n\nLittle Star somehow manages to make excellent deep dish AND thin crust, which is fairly unusual. We sampled the Classic (deep dish, sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bell peppers), the White Pie (thin crust, garlic olive oil base, mozzarella, roasted zucchini, fresh tomatoes, feta), and because my family is a bunch of fatties, the chicken wings. The wings came out first and had this amazing crunchy crust - not breaded, thank god, but just seared with spices. I'm not typically a wing person but I was fighting my brother off with every utensil I had to get at those wings. \n\nWhen the pizzas came out I got very, very excited. And then I put them in my mouth. The white pie had a perfect crust, crunchy and substantial enough to hold onto the toppings but thin enough not to overwhelm. That pie was GOOD. I was pleased to note the cornmeal crusting the outsides of the deep dish classic, and was doubly pleased when I forked off my first bite. Perfect sauce, good balance of ingredients, substantial and satisfying crust...I honestly can't say which pizza I preferred. They were both outstanding.\n\nLittle Star definitely makes it onto my short list of \"I'm in the Mission but don't want a burrito or a booze dinner\" restaurants. Which, granted, is not a list I have to turn to often - but perhaps now I will consider it more often.", "author": "Corinna K."}

I've been here many times over the years and it continues to be my favorite pizza in the city.\n\nTheir deep dish is solid and I do enjoy the hipster scene up in here. As you might expect, their jukebox is as carefully curated as their beer list... have a hankering for a PBR? Scrounge $2.50 and you're all set.\n\nLast night I had their white pizza (thin crust), pretty good but could have used more of those tasty tomato slices. Service is pretty reliable and a while ago they ditched their cash only policy, which is much appreciated. They don't take rezzies so there is always a decent wait, though if you go early in the week it probably won't be more than 30 mins.", "author": "Jeremy S."}

I ordered a pizza for my co workers and stopped in on my way to work. Unfortunately there was a problem with my order and the person who took it via phone forgot to take my number so they had no way to inform me. I wish that was the worst of the experience, but I showed up, gave my name and still wasn't informed. I stood there for a good 20-30 minutes and nothing. Sucks, right? \n\nThey were pretty busy, but I finally had to ask what was up, as I was already late for work. The young lady serving beer and wine checked and upon return it was clear something was wrong. A gentleman I took to be the manager on duty informed me of the breakdown in communication and complied when I requested a refund. But there is an upside to the situation. The young lady I'd previously spoke to came around the counter, took my order again and told me she'd like to hand deliver my order at no charge.\n\nIt takes one good person to change a bad experience. Because of her actions I will continue to give my business to Little Star Pizza. With that said, always request fresh mozzarella on top of your deep dish pizza. It enhances the experience.", "author": "Drew G."}

And they don't take reservations? Ugh. \n\nSo finally we decided to just do take out so we could finally experience te hype of Little Star Pizza. They're daily specials are pretty rad and usually worth going for since I think they do put effort into thinking what might be good to feature. We got a medium pizza and it easily fed two (very hungry) 20-somethings. The crust was very good, but pretty crunchy. The toppings were not overdone or too sparse and certainly added a lot of flavor.  \n\nWe also got garlic bread to go - it was literally a loaf of bread with a clove of garlic on the side.... um, what? Forgive me if I'm overlooking some impressive preparation that was not immediately obvious, but seriously? Not worth it... The garlic wasn't even roasted enough to spread. Oh well.. we got a loaf of bread out of it. \n\nLastly (please no threats).... Delfina is better. Sorry. If you're looking for great *THIN CRUST* pizza, go to Delfina.

The pesto drizzle (or whatever you want to call it) on top of the pizza is different than what I've experienced elsewhere, but it works very well. Couldn't have asked for a better pizza.\n\nService:    Everything went smoothly.

But this is not about comparing Little Star to other pizzerias in New York or Italy... it's more like giving them the credit they are due!\n\nI totally love it every time I come here.  The location on Valencia is hard to find and that adds to the allure.  It's difficult to park, it's a small place so the wait is always quite long.  But I'd rather wait a bit for a table for some great pizza than be seated right away to enjoy some mediocre fare.  That's just how I am - your mileage may vary!\n\nA little bar area makes the waiting even more effortless and enjoyable though they only serve beer and wine.\n\nI loved their thin crust pizzas, the regular crust pizzas and actually enjoyed the deep dish pizza.  I must clarify.  As an ex New Yorker, I have the obviously natural tendency to hate everything that's not like New York.  Chicago pizza is and will always be an abomination to me.  Oh, I eat it, but usually with annoying derogatory comments about how this could never stack up to a beautiful thin slice of New York's finest that you can fold and eat... ahhhhhhh...  but, I digress.\n\nSo, I did enjoy the deep dish at Little Star, but never more than one slice... mostly for the interesting crunchy corn meal encrusted crust.  But the other offerings are simply amazing... creative toppings (gorgonzola cheese - YES!!!!!!), artichokes sometimes, the usual vegetable medley, perhaps some goat cheese and spinach - you name it, they have it.  \n\nGood appetizer selection though I must ask... WHY????  Wait for the pizza ladies and gentlemen, it is worth it.  Do NOT spoil your appetite with chicken wings or other little nibbles.\n\nAgain, beer and wine are available should you choose to indulge in an adult beverage.\n\nPrices are quite reasonable considering the obvious popularity of the restaurant.  I wish they took reservations, even if it was only for tables of 4 or smaller.  But then, that would take the fun out of waiting for a table, wouldn't it?  ;)\n\n~ 5 stars overall for good ambiance, a cozy setting, fun staff, decent prices and drinks and absolutely delicious pizza!

I have no idea how it has a 4-star rating on yelp.  The service was bad, the seating arrangement was just plain stupid, the pizza wasn't worth the price, and the wine list sucked.  I guess that sums it up.\n\nMy friend and I tried to call ahead and order a pizza which we might then eat at the restaurant.  We were told that we could order takeout, but we absolutely could not eat it there--meaning that if we wanted to eat there, we would have to show up, get a table, order, then wait (even if I paid in advance with a credit card).  I have *never* had a restaurant that offers takeout tell me I couldn't order ahead then eat it there, and I have done this at many, many restaurants (seriously, what are they thinking?).\n\nWe theorized that perhaps the place was packed and they wanted to be sure they would have a table for us, but when we arrived the restaurant was mostly empty.  They then proceeded to place us at a table right next to another pair of people dining, even though the table right next to it was empty (the people next to us seemed equally surprised at this ridiculous notion).  We just quietly took it upon ourselves to slide over to the next table over without asking why in the world they would do that in a mostly empty restaurant--have they no consideration for conversational noise and privacy?.  To make it worse, this table was one of many that was up against a wall with a long bench.  They have the tables packed so tightly together that the waiter had to *literally* move the table out of the way so that I could get to the bench seat on the wall side of the table.  He had to do this for everybody else who came in while we were there, and again when we were leaving.  The place was never more than half full, and this was during dinner time, so I don't see why they wouldn't remove one 2-person table from the row of ten so that diners could get in and out of their seat (seriously, again, what are they thinking?).\n\nAs for the pizza.... we ordered the deep dish 'classic' with a cornmeal crust.  It was alright, but nowhere as good as Zachary's or Patxi's, and also not as large for the same price.  Oh, and their short wine list had nothing but wines from other countries like Chile and Australia.

The beers were flowing and the aroma of pizza was pleasantly wafting through the air. 1/2 hour into our drinkfest we noted that the restaurant was much more crowded and the many empty tables we previously saw, were now filled with happy patrons.

Thankfully the host was nice enough to inform us of the crowd situation and let us nab a table before our whole group was there- super sweet!\n\nThe pizza was delic! We ordered bothe the veggie and classic large deep dish pizzas with a few apps and had just the right amount of food. The sauce was a bit heavy- my only complaint, but the crust managed to stay crispy and delicious and lacking in grease, plus you didn't walk out with severe heartburn.

I never thought that I'd find a place that would give Gino's East and its famous cornbread crust a run for their money, but Little Star does just that.\n\nI came to Little Star Pizza with college friends on a recommendation from my cousin. The wait was pretty long given the small size of the restaurant and our group of 6, but the hostess was super-nice and offered to let us pre-order the pizzas to cut down the service time once we got seated. There are several 'suggested' options, or you can make your own deep-dish. I went for the equivalent 9\" deep-dish pie that I usually get at Gino's East in Chicago: sausage, tomatoes, spinach, and garlic.\n\nBiting into each slice is like sampling pizza perfection. The base sauce and cheese is spot-on: very flavorful, but not overly rich and heavy. The rest of the toppings were mixed perfectly, with the fresh spinach and very succulent tomatoes being some of the best I've ever tasted. The crust too was perfect: crisp and buttery, with a hint of cornmeal (not as rich as Gino's East's all-cornbread crust, but this means that the pizza is lighter and \"healthier\"). If there's one thing that they could add to make it better, they could go for a full-pie sausage patty option like Gino's East or Lou Malnati's instead of the sausage crumbs.\n\nBottom line: Possibly the best pizza I've ever had. And that's borderline heretical coming from a Chicagoan.", "author": "Peien L."}

It can't compare to any deep dish pie, in my opinion, but it's still damn good. The pesto was lightly drizzled on top of the chicken, peppers, mushrooms, and onions, giving it just the right amount of pesto flavoring. Don't get me wrong, I love pesto, but I find that pesto pizzas are often overly drenched in the stuff. This one was perfect. Two of us split a small and were satisfied, but not overly full by the end ($18.75).\n\nOn a previous visit, I also tried the White Pie which has a garlic olive oil base with mozzarella, roasted zucchini, fresh tomatoes, and feta on thin crust. Delicious, though I think I will stick to Cheese Board and Arizmendi for non-tomato based pizzas from now on. Little Star has too many other better options.\n\nOverall: $36 after tax and tip for one small thin crust pizza, one soda, and one beer. A little pricy, but not unreasonable.", "author": "Talia G."}

Upon entering, I was optimistic that the deep dish pizza would be as stellar as the other location but, alas, it wasn't. The lighting was right, the place smelled great and the crowd seemed happy.\n\nThe mixed salad was tasty - a nice balance of bleu cheese, nuts and lettuce mix. As I dug in, though, I found myself getting annoyed by the variance in leaf size; it turned out to be a royal pain in the ass to eat. The anticipation of the arrival of the ultimate gastronomic elixir - the half Class / half Brass deep dish pie - kept my welling frustration in check.\n\nAlas, when the pie arrived, I was completely let down. The sauce was considerably more acidic than I'd expected and the crust tasted yeasty and less sweet than the other location's. The toppings were applied inconsistently - I was actually wondering whether or not they put any sausage on the Brass Monkey.\n\nLike the other location, the service was exceptional - our friendly waitress even feigned interest in my at-table foursquare dabbling and congratulated me on knowing that the Brass Monkey is the Little Star deep dish with sausage. \n\nI think I'll stick with Divisadero from now on.", "author": "Mike B."}

I would align this very closely with Gino's Pizza East in Chicago, only not as greasy or cheesy.\n\nWe started with the garlic bread, which was kind of a do-it-yourself affair: a hunk of sliced warm sourdough (be still my heart), a bowl of olive oil/butter mixture (sounds gross but it was actually like very soft butter) and an entire roasted garlic bulb. Delish!  \n\nSome chef (either Thomas Keller or maybe Anthony Bourdain) once said to always try whatever dish is named after the establishment, so I was thrilled with my dining partner suggested the Little Star pizza. A mixture of fresh spinach, thinly-sliced onions, feta and ricotta complemented the traditional Chicago-style tomato sauce and mozz. The crust was clearly a nice cornmeal-based dough, which is perfect for this type of pizza, and the rest of the dish was probably closer to a warm lasagna without noodles, or maybe a salad. It was absolutely delicious. I had been worried about the feta and ricotta, but honestly, I didn't really detect either. Just a really balanced spinach pizza with occasional crunches of onion.\n\nI was also impressed with their selection of craft beers and sodas.

The long and short of is that the pizza is great if you're into that kind of deep dish style pizza - I am, and I really enjoyed the vegie, though I'm not a vegetarian.   They gave the option of having half one flavor, and the other something else - which was nice.  \n\nI have to mention the dark beer that i tried, I wish I remembered the name, but it wasnt a stout - real nice. Oh and you have to get the garlic bread appetizer for two reasons: 1) the pizza takes a full 30 minutes to bake, 2) the garlic bread comes with baked whole clove of garlic, still in its natural casing but baked and ready to be scooped out onto your bread, with butter - that was awesome.\n\nOn the pizza topic, I can appreciate a variety of types but if given my preference, I'd choose the texture and taste that I get from Blondie's pizza on Telegraph in Berkeley.  So the pizza here at Little Star is a different style, the bread is not as... doughy.

Little Star gave us a great experience. Everyone that served us had a friendly smile, personable demeanor, and attentive attitude. I liked the atmosphere on the inside. It's fancy yet you still feel like you're in a down to earth pizza house. An easy spot for a very casual romantic dinner or family get away. The light was dim but they still dimmed the lights even more and brought lit candles for each table. When we left we thought it was going to be black as night yet it still looked like mid afternoon. What an illusion.\n\nWe had the chicken wings and Mediterranean chicken pizza. Yeah we ordered two chicken dishes but they sounded the best. The chicken wings had a good spice flavor but nothing revelatory. I wish the chicken had more of a crunchy skin and spice coating than it did. Still good.\n\nThe pizza is of the course the main star. As usual with deep dish pizzas it takes 30 minutes to cook. It came out on time piping hot. I really like Little Star's pizza because it feels light and not greasy compared to other deep dish pizza places. Whenever I leave any pizza joint I feel heavy and greasy, ready to take a long shower or sleep. But when I leave Little Star I feel full and content. The cornmeal crust is really good too. It almost tastes like eating cornbread with pizza filling. I love the pizza crust ends because that's where you get the most crunch along with a concentration of butter. The crust is soft enough you don't even need a knife.\n\nThe only problem was that when I got here the waiter gave me one of the worst tables in the house. The place only had four tables being served so why'd he give me the worst table? I asked for a new table and he obliged.\n\n____\n\nUpscale casual dining. A different take on deep dish but a great detour I'll come back for.\n\nNote: One large pizza for two people is probably too much.

When we finally were seated, we ordered two small pizzas: a Little Star deep dish (spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic) and a Pesto Chicken thin crust. Thin crust came out first, and although it tasted fine, it wasnt anything special. Definitely NOT worth $18 for 6 small slices. Think about it. Thats $3/slice for average tasting pizza. Ridiculous. \n\nNext came out the deep dish. At first, it was exciting and novel. Corn bread crust. Ooo la la! But then after a few bites it quickly lost its novelty charm, and unfortunately the taste really didn't really make up for the loss. Just an uninteresting tasting mix of cheese and veggies on top of some cornbread. Not really that good, and definitely not worth $20.\n\nI'm guessing its sacrilegious to say this, but I would prefer CPK to Little Star any time. Little Star's pizza's were just not that interesting, and horribly over priced. At least they werent bad, plus the service was decent.

This shouldn't discourage you, however, as it is definitely is good -- especially is you're craving some deep dish.\n\nThe good:\n    - Nice, pseudo-New York ambience (brick and low lighting)\n    - Friendly service\n    - The garlic bread is actually toasty bread served with butter and roasted garlic\n    - Racer 5 on tap\n\nThe ugly:\n    - The wait can be pretty bad if you're not conscious of your dining hour\n    - It's relatively expensive for what you get\n\nOverall, Little Star, we had a good run... and I will probably continue to stray your way once in a while... but the marriage is off.", "author": "Kevin F."}

Its tomato chunks have that 'something.'\n\nI grew up in New Jersey. Thin, almost soggy like crust , beneath a smooth layer of tomato sauce, and heavy cheese on top is what I knew as pizza. And I adored it.\n\n....\n\nSo I couldn't help, but feel guilty, when I went deep dish and liked it. \n\nAlot.\n\nLittle Star was my first.\n\nAnd \n\nit \n\n was\n\n aaaaaaaaawesome (insert Chris Farley's (RIP) Tommy Boy voice)\n\nNow I know that most people dog on Little Star for not being authentic. Something to do with the tomato sauce and cornmeal crust. But I've tried the real \"Chicago\" stuff  and (Superbowl pizza pies flown in from Chicago) it just doesn't taste as good. Authentic or not -Little Star is what makes me wake up the next morning and....crave PIZZA.\n\nThat being said, there have been moments where I've yearned to play cupid with Little Star and Paxti's. And rear some Little Paxti's: cute pies with Little Star's top half and Paxti's bottom(their crust is incredible). Little Star and Paxti's would definitely make some beautiful pies together. (sigh)\n\nWith such a deep love for Little Star, I was ecstatic to learn that they'd opened up a new location in the Mission.  It has the same charm as the Western Addition location: loud conversations, a jukebox, a bar, uncomfortable waiting furniture and, dark lighting (almost too dark)  They've also added some new touches --- such as Ferris Plock wall art. It's so refreshing, when a restaurant expands and manages to retain its essence, yet still be creative and original. \n\nThe catch of Little Star is that it is a hot number. And with all things that we crave and love --- there's a wait. A loooooooong wait. To be seated. To get your pizza. To get your bill. \n\nOn a busy night, your stomach will probably be knawing on itself - it can be such a painful wait...and your head, if you're prone to migraines, may be throbbing from the loud booming voices around you......\n\nBut....\n\n... don't stress it....\n\nBecause it's still worth it. Especially if you order the mozzarella appetizer, the cheese deep dish pizza with your own carefully selected toppings, and the cheescake.\n\n....AND...\n\nEven when you have to loosen you belt, and have trouble dancing with nearly a pound of tomato sauce in your stomach. And are popping a big packet of TUMS like tic-tacs... \n\n---it's still worth it.", "author": "Jessica T."}

I was left wanting more [always a good sign]. Then came the pizza. At 9\" and a good 2\" deep, it was enough for three small appetites. I was a tiny bit hesitant about the mushrooms [yuck], but you can`t even taste them. Instead what you taste is just.. deliciousness. The ingredients meshed well with each other and no individual item was overpowered by another.

I paid my bill and added the customary tip.  I then checked the menu and confirmed we had been overcharged.  I went back to our server who said \"I'll give you $4.

I said that really is not good enough and I got the hand in the face accompanied by the \"whatever\".  i asked to see the manager who offered to give us a drinks voucher for next time we eat there.

There's definitely more of a trendy (and by trendy I mean hip and/or gay) crowd here vs the kind you'd see at a regular pizza joint. I wouldn't even consider this a joint - it's more like a gourmet restaurant.\n\nWhatever you order, just make sure you stick with the pizza - deep dish since that's what they're known for. The appetizers might get you full like it did me. Plus, they weren't even that great, or at least the chicken wings and the garlic bread weren't. If you do order appetizer, I suggest sticking with a salad.

The food here is unimpressive-- the salads, insalata caprese are all plates that can easily be recreated at home and aren't really heightened that much (particularly compared to Beretta, where even their simplest appetizers are incredibly fresh and use innovative ingredients). The pizza is fine: while the crust is great, the sauce needs more garlic, is a bit too sweet, and need some oomph.\n\nCons: I was very unimpressed by the douchey host and waitstaff. We came here for a birthday dinner; we had all arrived on time but were waiting for 1 person. Of course the restaurant wouldn't seat us (even though we were sharing everything because it's friggin' pizza), and also said if our last person didn't arrive soon they couldn't guarantee that they would seat us at all... mind you, we were all there, had arrived early, and had been waiting a half hour. And the birthday girl was very excited to be there, so it was disappointing that they couldn't have cared less.\n\nThe douchey, rude host finally relented and seated us. I dunno, I feel like Little Star tries to give off a posh vibe, but fails because it's a factory in there. They definitely want to get you in there and out. When we ordered, they told us we to make sure we had enough food because they don't take additional orders for more deep dish pizza after the first order.  It just doesn't feel very welcoming when they're itching for you to finish up so they can get in more diners. \n\nOverall: Poor service, douchey wait-staff, and pretentious vibe don't make me want to come back here.

The cornmeal pie crust was good, it had a rustic earthy taste to it. My half of the pie was overall good. I love the veggies except olives. With all the toppings, it did make for a heavy pie so we were only able to eat 1-2 pieces each with leftovers for lunch the next day.\n\nAmbiance - 4 stars, it was the first time i'd been to a pizza joint where it was contemporary and felt a little upscale compared to the hole in the wall places throughout the city. \n\nsitting area - there's plenty of tables even though they've maximized the use of the small space they have. My only gripe is that the tables against the wall are too close to each other. Thankfully we were there early enough that there wasn't a crowd nor anyone using the table next to us but there is very little space between the chairs and tables. You literally have to pull out the table if you're sitting against the wall regardless of your size.\n\nParking was a little challenging even though we were there before 6. Valencia is a busy street especially in the evening hours so you might have to drive around the block a few times to find a space nearby.", "author": "Faaae L."}

The pizza is deep dish, with lots of tomato sauce, tomatoes and extra cheesy with a crispy garlic crust.  IT IS FINGER LICKING GOOD.  I wish we had one down here in southern ca.  Their hot wings are delicious as well.  It's flavorful and spicy.  Their garlic bread is good too, but I'm not a fan of crispy bread so I left it for the bf since he loves it.  \n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate and they also have a bar.  If you happen to go later at night, expect a wait time of about 30 mins to an hour depending on how crowded it is.  The bar is a first come, first serve so you could sit there and order your food as well.  \n\nI love this place.", "author": "Shong H."}

Cute, dim, small restaurant with cool music and a scene crowd. They serve beer, wine, appetizers, dessert and of course deep dish and thin crust pizzas.\n\nWe ordered a large deep dish classic pie and their do-it-yourself garlic bread. I say do-it-yourself because you're given a sliced loaf, runny butter and a toasted bulb of garlic. The garlic is entirely soft and spreadable and the butter liquefies when slathered on a slice, which made it super tasty!\n\nThe pizza: deep dish with chunky peppered sausage, thinly sliced onions and mushrooms, with no bell peppers but with an add-on of perfectly firm plump artichoke hearts. The outer crust was really good because it was almost pastry like. It was buttery and flaky and even tasty when microwaved the next day for lunch. It was definitely different from Zachary's in that there's a whole layer of tomatoes ABOVE the toppings (really they shouldn't be called toppings since they're underneath the top) but the deep dish at Little Star didn't have such a distinct layer, which is not a bad thing, but I LOVE tomatoes.\n\nOnly a small pizza made it to our table although we ordered a large, just a small mistake of the waitress, but no biggie since we weren't charged for a large pizza. We weren't rushed through the meal nor pressure the kitchen was closing, even though we were some of the last people in the restaurant.

We chose to eat in Mission at a dimly light, tightly tabled, and otherwise intimate spot. We settled on the Deep Dish Classic and Thin Crust White Pie to share across the table. The Classic included a salty sausage with mushrooms, onions, and green peppers thumb-deep in a hearty marinara. It was true to a pizza pie - the deep dish crust held up well, with an emphasis on the filling. I'm ok with this. The White Pizza has been done countless times with mild variation. Here, it's served with garlic olive oil, mozzarella, feta, zucchini, and tomatoes and piping hot: gooey and so cheesy that the ribbons seemed endless from the pizza serving plate. At the end of our meal, I found myself counting among the table and nibbling on the unclaimed remaining slices until all were gone (others followed suit until it became a fork battle for the last few pieces).

One bite, and one can see the layers of flakey, beautiful, almost dense pastry-like goodness, that does a good job of staying firm even after a day or two in the fridge after being warmed up in my toaster oven (whereas Zachary's deep dish pizza in Berkeley had somewhat bland tasting, flimsy crust that quickly became soggy, even after i heated up the left over pieces in same toaster oven). The sauce has just the right amount of fresh tomato chunks. The cheese is just right (whereas I felt Zachary's was a bit too cheesy, to the point where I needed more sauce where there was none). It's simply, and utterly fantastic. \n\nI also prefer Little Star's admittedly overly hip/low lit atmosphere over Zachary's bright, childish (in the literal sense of the word) decorations. \n\nThough Little Star could take a tip from Zachary's efficient reception, specifically the fact that one is able put in their pizza order while waiting for a table. \n\nDelivery option would also be nice, though I live super close, so pickup isn't a problem for me. \n\nTheir garlic bread is splendid in its simplicity. \n\nIt's an expensive pie (Zachary's is pretty equivalent in price), but worth every penny.", "author": "Safiya B."}

Eeeks!  Is this pizza truly worth it?  Our pizza was a little cold once we reached our friend's house, but it wasn't even close to the best pizza I've ever had.  The deep dish one was definitely better, with fresh sauce, basil, nice seasonings.  The crust was okay, but not spectacular, and we liked how it wasn't dripping in grease.  The thin crust was like \"a cracker with cheese\", as described by a member of our group.  I agreed.  I liked the fresh tomatoes, but it wasn't good enough to warrant eating another slice.  We has a lot of that pizza left.  I'm sure it would be much better hot, but I'm not impressed, especially at those prices.", "author": "Kari C."}

It was orgasmic....pizza orgasmica does not even come close, im so so soooooo sorry!  This place is the TRUE pizza orgasmica *gasp*  I really don't like meat on my pizza but since I was in the company of other people it was a must to get a meaty deep dish.

Oh and we also had the chicken, holy crap....so good, sooo sooo sooo good! finger licking good that is.  You can smell the aroma of bbq'd chicken--it was very very flavorful that I could've just ate it by myself.

After much waiting---literally in the restaurant and also in my lifetime--- I have eaten at Little Star Pizza. Was is worth it? YES.\n\nAMBIANCE: Walking in, the first thing I see is a bar serving beer and wine to the mass of customers waiting for a table. The place is pretty loud and happening. It's a bit small but not uncomfortable. I like.\n\nFOOD: There were two of us and we wanted variety so we got two small pizzas:\n\n1. Brass Monkey: Little Star + Sausage + Deep Dish = Slice of Heaven. The crust is what makes this dish more special. It's so crunchy and baked perfectly. All the ingredients are fresh. Honestly, I don't eat much deep dish so I have little to compare to. Nevertheless, this is one of the best deep dish pizzas I've had.\n\n2. Pesto Chicken: Crust!! Again, the same quality crust as the Brass Monkey. The pizza is topped with chicken, mushrooms, and onions and drizzled with pesto sauce. Very appealing to both the eye and the stomach.\n\nPRICE: Normally, you'd probably spend about $10-15 a person. We spent a bit more, since we got two pizzas for two people. Even though a whole pizza may look small, it's definitely enough to fill your belly. \n\nSERVICE: The wait for a table can be brutal. We had a 45 minute wait on a Friday night, so we walked around the Mission to kill time. The waiters are super friendly here. You definitely feel welcomed into the establishment.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE: Best pizza in town? It comes close. I am debating between Gaspare's and Little Star Pizza. But then again, why argue when you can have both. =D", "author": "Jonathan L."}

The sauce is fantastic and the toppings are all great- the sausage in the classic is really what seals the deal for me. A lot of people I know spend a lot of time debating whether Little Star is better or Zachary's in Berkeley. If you've been to Zachary's, then you'll know that this is quite a bold statement. I personally can't choose which one is better. The crust at Little Star is better I think, but it's pretty tough to beat the deep dish chicken pizza at Zach's. You decide for yourself.\n\nI like the Valencia location a little better than the Divisadero restaurant because of the size. Valencia seems a little bigger and so the wait is usually a lot shorter.

Long overdue, right?\n\nMy friend and I arrived around 6:30 after a brief walk from the 16th and Mission Bart station, and fortunately, we were able to get a table before the big dinner rush came at 7.  We were greeted promptly with menus and waters as we deliberated what kind of pizza we wanted.  When our waitress informed us that the pizza takes about half an hour to make, we opted for the garlic bread to keep us occupied.\n\nI suppose you can call Little Star's version of garlic bread as \"deconstructed.\"  A loaf of pre-sliced bread is in the middle, and then a whole bulb of roasted garlic and butter are on the side.  It was a bit of an adventure to extract the cloves out of the garlic and spread it along the bread slice, but I've never seen that presentation anywhere else.\n\nLet's not kid ourselves here: the star of the show is the pizza, and the headliner, as many Yelpers have commented, is the crust.  Normally, the crust is the worst part of the pizza whose purpose is to just hold the toppings together, but Little Star's crust is much more than that.  It actually has taste and crunch, thanks to the cornmeal that they blend in there.  I bet that if they served the crust by itself as an appetizer--just the crust--people would go bonkers over it.  It's that good, folks.\n\nWe went for the large, which is eight slices, and both of us managed to chow down three each.  The waitress gave us each a box to go, handed us our check, and back home we went.\n\nThank you, Little Star, for waking me out of my Yelp review hibernation with your version of an awesome deep-dish pizza.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-08-13", "description": "Whenever pizza is the topic, I like to start by saying I'm a stark, raving conservative about one thing in this wacky world and that's pizza.  Crust, sauce, cheese... I'm of the mind that these elements are not merely vehicles for toppings so when I ordered both a 12\" thin crust and a 12\" deep dish I wanted to taste what everyone was so excited about.\n\nTurns out, not many kind things can I say about it.\n\nThe deep dish crust was perfectly flat up the sides and that made it far too crispy.  Cause I love you all, I'm going to set that aside as maybe just a flaw suffered only by 12\" pizzas at Little Star and move on to talk about the crust in general.   The cornmeal imparted it's usual gritty texture - which sucks, in case you were wondering :).  I understand how cornmeal can help slide a pizza out of an oven or pan and I don't care, it's unpleasant and adds no discernible flavor, so 86 that.  The crust taste was okay but nothing in particular stood out, save for a hint of butter.  The texture was meh, especially of the thin crust, I can't imagine anyone NOT pushing the crusts of their thin pizza slice to shame-side of the plate.\n\nLittle Star's pizza sauce needs some more zing.  It could benefit from more garlic and a bit of a sweet under-taste to go along with the tangy tomato (like basil, or sweeter tomatoes).  It could also use a savory spice.  Little Star does sprinkle with oregano and a healthy, welcomed amount of powdered cheese of some kind, but that aint making me wanna lick it off my plate.  The thin crust had only a whisper of sauce beneath the cheese which quickly dried into red paint.  While the deep dish had the perfect amount of sauce, it failed on having enough cheese.\n\nZachary's and Patxi's have much better tasting crust and sauce.  Yes, both places are known for their stuffed pizzas - you don''t gotta get up all in my face to remind me of the differences.  Flavor, texture. You feelin' me?  If the basic elements aren't strong, it don't matter what you stuff it with or throw on top.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty cool.  I personally dig the brick wall and dark furniture, the ambiance is unlike most any other pizza place.  Hipster crowds?  Well, yeah... welcome to the Valencia corridor!  And I suspect your money is as green as theirs. \n\nTL;DR version for the ADD crowd:  if what lies beneath a pizza is really important to your oral pizza pleasure, then I can't recommend Little Star.", "author": "Ben S."}

I say this because this review doesn't consider the experience during \"peak\" times.  I haven't yet seen the line around the corner.\n\nAnother disclaimer:  I have Lou Malnati's delivered to my door (Lou's is widely considered the ultimate Chicago Deep Dish pizza).  So, I'd consider my palate trained as to how a Chicago pizza should taste.\n\nCut to the chase - Little Star is NOT a replacement for a Chicago Style pizza.  It just doesn't have enough of what's bad for you in it (aka grease).  That being said, it's still delicious - you get the stuffed pizza experience minus a little of the guilt that comes with eating cups-worth of grease that usually accompanies a Chicago pizza.\n\nService:  The first time, service was just right - and there were just two of us so we quickly got seated at a high top.  The second time, we had a party of four.  There really aren't many tables and the pies take 30 minutes to make, so we avoided the quoted wait time by sitting at the bar.  It took us 15 minutes to put in our drink order - we had to jump up and down to put in a second drink order mid-meal and our order was wrong.  \n\nAll said and done, we'll go back to Little Star if we are looking for a long wait time - otherwise we'll order take out, have Malnati's delivered, or head down to Windy City in San Mateo to get our Chicago-pie fix.", "author": "Heather L."}

Every list I checked of San Francisco musts included Little Star, so I wasn't surprised to wait 20 or so minutes for a table. However, the mellow, pleasant vibes our waiter exuded made that time worth it. \n\nMy companion and I split a small mixed salad, comprising greens, cherry tomatoes, red bell peppers, Gorgonzola cheese crumbles, walnuts and a light house dressing. Because it was so tasty and full of textural interest, I've already tried to recreate this salad at home. \n\nOur waiter misunderstood our order, as he brought us a large classic deep dish as opposed to the small we requested. While we would've loved to leave with leftovers, my travel partner and I were hitting up a show after dinner and didn't want to have to hold a container in the middle of a hipster music mob. The pizza's toppings included sausage, mushrooms, green bell peppers and onions, along with a delicious tomato sauce piled heavily on top. Like I said, I'm no pizza guru, but I found the delivery of sauce on top of all the other strata interesting. The thin crust reminded me of an apple pie Pillsbury crust but left substantial room for layer upon layer of cheese, toppings and the incredible sauce I wish I could slather on my face again. \n\nA small pie would've been perfect for us, as our salad and two slices apiece left us satisfied but not stuffed. Our waiter suggested we offer our remainders to a homeless person, as innumerable people live on San Francisco's streets.

I should have been asked to be moved when they sat me next to one of the only occupied tables on the bench along the wall. Even with my engrossing novel, it was impossible not to feel like I was part of the first date occurring beside me. I didn't ask to move because I figured any moment swarms of people would enter and big parties would need the tables. Needless to say, I was surprised that the place remained quite empty for Saturday lunch.", "author": "Jess O."}

I've spent a lot of time in St. Louis, where a Little Start spin-off (Pi) gave me a little hint of what I'd be expecting. \n\nAlong with the fabulous Nichole P., I ordered take out on a Sunday night. We chose a large Brass Monkey (off the menu), and it was ready in 30 minutes. \n\nAs I can't really vouch for the actual restaurant, I'll keep this review strictly in terms of taste. The pizza itself was good, but the large is certainly not the \"large\" that I'm used to, even for deep dish. The highlight of this pizza is really the crust; it's simply the best part of the pizza, and it compliments the tomato sauce quite well. \n\nThe downside to me of Little Star deep dish is the price...a large pizza was $30. While it will certainly provide leftovers for quite some time, that's usually a bit more than I like to spend on pizza. \n\nGive it a shot, but I'm still looking for a better slice here in SF.", "author": "Tom A."}

SO. GOOD. I don't know if I'll be able to eat normal pizza crust again haha\nI don't know how they make the filling, but it was the perfect combo of flavors! Not too much cheese either! In the words of Goldilocks, just right! I wish there had been more spinach thrown in there, but that's probably just me cause I love vegetables.\n\nThe bathroom is really clean too!

I really did want to make the comparison between zachary's and little star.  And here's the verdict MY preference is Zachary's.\n\nDon't get me wrong, little star pizza was and excellent pizza that was pretty close to perfect in my book, but it really did come down to the crust.  I'm a HUGE fan of Zachary's flaky-crispy crust, albeit there really is little to no flavor to it.  On the opposite end, the crust at Little star is a very flavorful cornmeal (so i've heard) crust.  Texture wise it was denser and it had a lot more substance, it was tasty but I wanted that crunch texture.\n\nI will give Little star the slight advantage on toppings and how well they blended everything into one solid pie.  The ingredients just seem to have more presence in the little star pizza but I can't say it was like a whole step above zachary's toppings, probably like a 1/2 step.\n\nI also order a house salad, I'm not usually a salad guy and the salad was extremely oily for me, maybe it's supposed to be like that.  \n\nI will be back again to Little star, but like i've said I do prefer Zachary's.

The pizza is ... just bomb.  Unfortunately, this also means that competition for tables can be tough, so try and come on a slower night or outside of prime dinner hours.\n\nI'm actually writing this review to replace a more negative one I had, but I had such a nice experience the most recent time I went to Little Star.  The previous time I came, there was a bit of confusion that led to a much longer wait than had been expected, but this Sunday, Little Star was great.\n\nMy group enjoyed the garlic bread appetizer, which comes with piping hot bread, a whole head of roasted garlic cloves that you take out of the head of garlic yourself, and soft butter.  This do-it-yourself garlic bread is a nice new take on a standard appetizer.\n\nThe chicken wings were spicy and DELICIOUS.  I've never had them here before, and wouldn't have thought they'd be such a ... little star ;) but they really were.  I will actually get them every time I come back.\n\nAnd lastly, the vegetarian pizza.  There are a lot of pizzas to choose from here, and the ingredients will always be fresh and delicious, so just choose whatever sounds best to you.  Any pizza (go deep dish, of course) should be great here, because Little Star's strongest point is their *pizza crust*.  Like everyone else has said, it is awesome, with corn meal on the outside that adds just the right amount of texture and a little bit of crunch.\n\nAmong deep dish pizzas, Little Star is my favorite for the crust (and Zachary's in the East Bay is my favorite for pizza sauce.)\n\nDefinitely try Little Star, just try to avoid the biggest crowds.", "author": "David W."}

As with any other famous and delicious restaurants in SF, the wait requirement is about an hour... but absolutely worth the wait. \n\nI love the wait staff here. The wait was about an hour long and my party was getting restless. We saw some empty tables but since the restaurant was so busy with just 1 waitress and 1 busboy, we weren't seated right away. Also, a bigger party who came after us was seated before us because a bigger table had become available first. Not knowing this, I protested, and the waitress kindly and patiently offered me an explanation.\n\nEven though it wasn't her fault, the waitress felt bad that we waited a wee bit longer than other parties. So she gave a complimentary glass of beer to each of us. Even though we went during their happy hour where the beers are $1 off from their already low priced beer selections and we wouldn't have minded paying for them, I still thought her gesture was very kind. I would definitely go back just for their customer service. But lucky for me, even the food was amazing. \n\nPer every yelper's recommendation, we ordered the spicy chicken wings. They were delicious indeed. Even if you're not a fan of appetizers (although not likely) because you don't like having entree leftovers, chicken wings are worth a try. \n\nAs for the pizza, we ordered the vegetarian deep dish. It was my first deep dish pizza ever and I'm so glad it was at the Little Star's. It was the best vegetarian pizza I've ever had. Everything about the pizza was so scrumptious - from its non-greasy yet savory crust to fresh vegetable ingredients to marinara sauce (that tasted homemade).\n\nDespite the fact that this place is located in a somewhat less desirable part of SF (compared to Marina/Cow Hollow which I'm partial to) with some questionable characters (i.e., many homeless people talking to themselves or hitting on random people walking about the neighborhood) and that it's a bit more pricey than what I'm used to paying for for pizza, I am definitely going back.

Little Star has secured his footing, swung a surprised Zachary's around, and gotten him into a guillotine choke. His opponent slumps to the floor.\n\nLittle Star rolls Zachary's onto his back, and stands on his chest.

It's almost like a dog pissing on a fire hydrant as a means to claim its territory.  I can literally pull out a map of the city and draw out places that I avoided because knowing my dumb-luck I'd bump into him during his lunch break or what not.  One of the places that I tried to avoid during the state of \"healing\" was certain parts of the mission.  With that being said, stumbling across \"enemy lines\" due to your friends dragging you out for \"semi-pity-yet-celebratory-your-single-now\" happy hour leads to a stupid drunk text/call that one regrets the following day.  I've seen it happen countless times with my girlfriends as well as, I admit I've shamefully done it in the past; the last time I've done this very deed was at Little Star Pizza.   So now whenever I walk by Little Star Pizza a part of me cringes because I'm always reminded about the humiliating angry drunk text that I've once committed here in the past.\n\nAlthough I much prefer Patxi's, Little Star in the Mission is the PERFECT spot to go to right after having happy hour at Blondie's or at some other dive bar around the area.  Besides bacon wrapped hotdog, pizza is one of my favorite foods to eat while trying to sober up.  I say, stick to deep dish when you're here.  A small deep dish is actually really heavy and perfect for 2-3 people.  I normally order the classic (Sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells) whenever I go here.  The Little Star is also very delicious (Spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic).  It's normally a long wait if you order a deep dish pizza, but it's totally worth it.  I say order a salad while you wait.  They actually make pretty yummy salads here.  I've tried both the Caprese Salad (Fresh mozzarella served with sliced tomatoes, basil, and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar) and the Goddess Salad (Baby gems with a creamy pesto dressing, topped with chives and toasted almonds).  I much prefer the Caprese Salad, only because it doesn't fill me up as much as a small goddess salad so I have enough room for the pizza.  \n\n+3.5, the highlight of Little Star is the crust.  Everything else, I feel that Patxi's does a much better job.  Although I am normally reminded of my embarrassing message whenever go here, it's still doesn't stop me from going because it really is one of the best post-happy hour places to go to in the mission.", "author": "Jacquelynne S."}

I wish it was larger so I would have had more to talk home. I was secretly excited when my friend said, you want to take those home? My one slice of each we had... YES! \n\nWe went on a Thursday after work right before 6pm, there was no one there yet. I had heard it gets packed and figured we were safe at this time. And we so were! So we are greeted by the staff and seated by the window (the tiny table). I had wondered how we got that tiny table since it was completely empty... but 30 minutes later... people were waiting and looking like they were about to mob. There is a no reservation policy, so plan ahead if you really want to eat here and are starving. Be nice to staff, after all, they are the ones that will be seating you and are the ones that control the flow of things if need be, with bad attitudes, I wouldn't expect anyone to work hard to seat me (this is a side comment about a group of people that were there as I was leaving and their ring leader was giving them attitude). \n\nTo start, we had the Caprese Salad - Fresh mozzarella served with sliced tomatoes, basil, and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar $10. It was really tasty, fresh. As much as you may think you can't mess this up, yes you can. It is all about the selection of the tomatoes and cheese and they were both perfect. \n\nThe White - Garlic olive oil base, mozzarella, roasted zucchini, fresh tomatoes, feta Sm 12\" $17/ Lg 16\" $21 \n\nClassic - Sausage, mushrooms, onions, green bells Sm 12\" $18/ Lg 16\" $22 \n\nThey have a nice selection of wine and brews... but best of all, they have my favorite on draft, Pear Cider. \n\nI did not check out their ladies room...

The hubs and I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time given the really hefty + many good reviews read about it. \n\nWe arrived to the little corner restaurant at 6:00 p.m. The restaurant only opened 30 minutes ago and dam, it was already hot + crowded. We put our names down, but couldn't be immediately seated since our entire party wasn't there. Boo. So, off we sat in the bar area and enjoyed some drinks. They offer various types of beer in which one of them got me thinking if it was a generic version of Blue Moon as it was named, Blue Star. \n\nWe got to order one of their appetizer which was the hot chicken wings. Really good as it wasn't saucy. Looked like they just put a spicy rub on it and fried it to perfection. Served it with blue cheese and a few slices of baby carrots. \n\nOur pizza's arrived within a well timely manner when we finally got seated. We decided to order a small thin crust Classic pizza and a large deep dish Little Star pizza. According to the employee at the bar, the Classic + the Little Star is the most popular. \n\nThe thin crust pizza tasted good, but it wasn't anything spectacular. I really enjoyed the crispiness of the crust though. However, the deep dish Little Star was great! It was very fresh tasting and the ricotta just hit the spot. Made the pizza taste fabulous! Reminded me of lasagna. \n\nThe crust  resembled the buttery crust that you get at Pizza Hut. \n\nWe also ordered the housemade cheesecake. It was a hunk of a piece that was drizzled with chocolate sauce on top. Very, very good + creamy tasting. \n\nWould return here but only will get the deep dish pizza's.", "author": "stacy k."}

I've started wearing safety padding whenever I go there because inevitably some body opens the door real quick which smacks somebody and then everybody goes over like dominoes. Why they couldn't make the door open outward or move the bar back a few feet to make room for the crowd or so something, anything to make it feel less claustrophobic and like you can barely get into the place.

Especially if you're a deep dish fan. \n\nGreat place to meet up for dinner with friends before going out (Zeitgeist is right nearby...) or to bring folks visiting for some awesome fancy pizza.", "author": "Andy A."}

After my best friend has been jumped, our cars vandalized, no parking, and the infamous hipster crowd taking over, I attempt to be caught in that part of the city as little as possible.\n\nWe were invited to my friends birthday dinner party here the other night, and I bitched and moaned while driving to the mission about my woes and foes there. Whats new? I'm a shit talker by nature, but hey, I embrace my darker half with love. \n\nAlmost hidden in on the corner of Valencia and 15th, right by Monroe Motors (a great Ducati wrenching spot by the way) is Little Star pizza, boasting some of the best deep dish in the city.\n\nNow I've had great pizza, in the old school heart of NYC, where I've been spoiled by the crust which was cooked in the same oven for over fifty years. \n\nThere were many of us, so we ordered tons of appetizers, and four pizzas. The appetizers were, well, lacking to say the least. The blue cheese for the buffalo wings tastes like the cheap one from KFC from back in the day, the gorgonzola was flavorless in the salad and the onions were overpowering. The garlic bread wasn't on great bread, the butter was mild, but the garlic bulb itself which you spreaded was delicious, but a bit oily. \n\nBut then came the pizza, especially the \"little star\" deep dish. It was incredible, the cheese and homemade sauce nestled beautifully into it's amazing cornmeal crust. The crust itself was to die for. Flavorful, and not too dry. The white pizza was unlike other white pizzas. It was moist, and complex, flavorful and left you wanting more. The other pizzas weren't as memorable as those two, but still pretty amazing. The crust made everything. It was perfection.\n\nThese pizzas upon themselves made up for the boring and less desirable appetizers, and even the boring and flat cheesecake we had for dessert which was smothered in what seemed Hershey's chocolate sauce. (not a fan, but that seems obvious)\n\nStruggling for parking and fighting to get in may not be worth it at this location in my mind, but I am definitely willing to eat at their sister location on Divisadero which in my opinion is a much easier location to weather. \n\nFor a moment, even if it was only one, while consuming this delicious pizza, I forgot about the horn rimmed faces of hipsters seemingly glaring at me from throughout the restaurant, the drug addicts leaning against the wheels of my car, and the torn dirty pajama pants under shorts it seemed like everyone was wearing. \n\nBut I was shocked when I saw on a nice eatery's menu, PBR in a can....yep, it's official now. We're in the mission, and my city (born and raised bitches) is being taken over by hipsters....\n\nSIGH..........", "author": "Danielle S."}

I prefer a thicker toppings level, maybe like a 80/20 toppings to crust ratio, not 50/50.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed the pizza, but this place doesn't belong in the same sentence as Zachary's.

It was perfectly crispy but did not seem oily at all.  Even the bottom of the pizza crust stayed crisp.  The filling was really good, tomato, spinach, two kinds of cheeses.  I think I might like it better than Zachary's, but that is a hard call to make.  The mixed green salad was very nice too (way better than I expected from a pizza place).\n\nBe aware that the restaurant sort of looks closed from the outside (windows completely darkened, major construction going on on the sidewalk outside).  We almost left disappointed, but as we were walking away we smelled the pizza (\"mmm.. what is that amazing smell??  they must be open!  let's go back and see\") and happily discovered that they were indeed open.

Nonetheless, Little Star does serve great deep dish pizzas.\n\nThe scene:\n\nWe took it to go, so I didn't get a chance to fully absorb the atmosphere. I was expecting an old looking pizza parlor with a fat guy from Chicago handing us a pizza, but boy was I wrong. Who knew this is where the hipsters hung out in the Mission? It was a trendy restaurant with candles and cloth napkins. The cashier even had tattoos up her neck.\n\nThe food:\n\nK has been wanting to try an anchovie pizza, so we ordered the \"Little Star\" with anchovies on top.\n\nLittle Star pizza - Spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, garlic. I have to admit, it was a dang good pizza. Although not as great as Tony's Pizza Napoletana, I give it props for being a good deep dish pizza. The crust was crispy and firm, much like a pie crust made from corn meal rather than pizza dough. If you're a loyal follower of TheCultureBite, you'll know I don't eat tomatoes. The tomato sauce on this pie was literally 3 inches of semi-crushed whole tomatoes. I just picked it off and passed it over to K. The bottom half of the pizza was very good, however. The ingredients are undoubtedly fresh and it was loaded with garlic. All pluses in my book.\n\nI'm down to try Little Star Pizza again and actually eat in the restaurant.

The Pesto came out first - thin crust which I prefer.  It was amazing.  The pesto was just right, and the entire thing was a balance of chicken, and cheese, and pesto.  I could have eaten the entire thing, but I knew we had a second pie coming.  The Brass Monkey was worth the wait. It's deep dish - which is not exactly my favorite.  But it wasn't super doughy.  Instead, it was loaded with sauce, and basil, and cheese, and of course, the delicious sausage.  The crust on both was crispy and light (even on the deep dish pie).  Again, it took some restraint not to finish the entire thing.  I couldn't wait - I made the leftovers of the Brass Monkey into breakfast this morning.  I only wish there was more of it.  It was totally worth the wait (we put our names on the list when we got there and it was going to be an hour wait - we grabbed a drink nearby).  The server was so friendly - as was everyone there.

This review was based on my recent visit to their Valencia branch.   \n\nTake the case of....\n\nMIXED GREEN SALAD.  \nOLD DAYS:  Little Star green salad was one my favorite salads in the city--basic mixed mesclun, perfectly dressed, with sweet cherry tomatoes and piquant gorgonzola.  \nNOW:  The mesclun was really tough, bitter.  The gorgonzola didn't have the fresh, creamy sharpness that it had before.  It tasted like they got it already crumbled out of a container from the De Lano deli case.  The tomatoes weren't as sweet either...  Doesn't have the WOW factor any more.\n\nCLASSIC DEEP DISH PIZZA\nOLD DAYS:  Sweet, juicy bits of sausage embedded in layers of cheese, tomatoes strewn over cornmeal crust.\nNOW:  Mealy, \"sausage\" that resembled ground beef more than sausage.

We tried again late on a Monday evening, and were seated at a cozy table with plush booth seats in ten minutes. A bit of wine, a bit of conversation, and a bit of flirting with our hip waitress mitigated the hungered edge of our anticipation, and the hilariously tipsy patrons a few tables away called to both laughter and relaxation to blanket us. \n\nSoon, a steaming cast iron skillet domed in tomato sauce released from its orbit and descended upon our table, where I eagerly nestled a spatula into layers of fresh tomatoes, clinging mozzarella cheese, tender basil-infused pesto chicken, and golden roasted garlic, drawing out a generous slice with a thick, gleaming, lightly browned crust. The pizza was perfectly baked, but I detected a hint more of the pan's oily residue in the crust's flavor than I would like. Still, I would not hesitate to return to Little Star.

It's the question on every San Franciscan's lips, right?\n\nI truthfully can't answer.  They are both aiming for different things.  Zachary's is much more American style- they have all the standard toppings I like (the combination of pepperoni and pineapple is amazing, btw!)\n\nLittle star is going for something completely different.  Not one mention of pineapple on the menu here- traditional Italian is what they are after.  Their crust was pretty good, about on par with Zachary's.  Their sauce and toppings were awesome!  They have fresh (organic I believe) toppings such as sun-dried tomato.  \n\nDon't waste your time, order the deep dish.  If you want to fit in, put on your best hipster gear and order an organic cola (that's right, no Coke here).

Their chicken wings are also insanely delicious and you get a huge portion of it to enjoy while you wait for your pizza to come out of the oven.\n\nThis place does get really crowded, especially during the weekends, but I've found that Mon-Thurs around 5:30 is a good time to go.

Treat me and my friends like we're an inconvenience when we dine at your restaurant.\n\nLook, I understand that it's tough being the popular kid.  Everyone wants your attention.  Everyone wants a piece of your time (or your pizza).  You have to deal with this every day. The pressure is intense.  I get it.\n\nHOWEVER, that does not give you the privilege to enact selfish rules at the expense of the customer.  I can understand the \"Entire Party Must Be Present Before Seating\" rule.  You don't want empty seats while others are waiting.  That's cool.  Your \"Cash Only\" rule is annoying and anachronistic, but tolerable. \n\nYou were even cool when we (very apologetically) broke one of your rules and had an unexpected guest arrive late.

That's insane!\n\nOkay, fine.   When I think about it, I get that rule too.  Deep dish pizzas take 20 minutes to cook.  You wanted to turn the table over.

We would have occupied that table and continued to order drinks... you know, those alcoholic beverages with the insanely high profit margins?

We ordered 3 pizzas and various other goodies initially and had another 3 stragglers join our group very shortly after we ordered (and when I say very shortly, it was by no means a long time at all). One of those three does not eat meat, and all of our pizzas were ordered with meat. As anyone knows deep dish pizza is pretty much impossible to \"de-meat\" (not that I would ever dream of it, those vegetarians are a little cray-cray), so our late bleeding heart, animal rights, kooky but super funny, useful and cool friend asked to order another pizza, sans meat. \n\nThe response? No, we were not allowed to order any more pizza because we were taking up too much room and they wanted us to leave. Enter the obligatory \"What the fuck? I want to talk to management\" conversation, which ended it management basically reiterating this message. Not to mention they didn't even allow us to order dessert (which might have fed our one hungry companion) for I guess the same reason...they do not want our business (though they were happy to take the mandatory 18 percent gratuity they tack on to large parties). \n\nLittle Star, you are not so important that turning away business because you have a wait suddenly becomes acceptable. I don't care how good your food is.

However, I love me a good thin crust pizza and I won't frown upon the thought of sinking my teeth into one.  \n\nHaving a great pizza place is important in a city.  Its close to having that reliable mexican burrito joint that you can visit and know what you are getting.  Since moving here, it was important for me to find great pizza I could eat as well as take any guests to  that I could guarantee a great night with.  \n\nI had heard of this place, only because this was the pizza Barack Obama wanted when he first got into office.  Yes,  I Illinois senator, living in Chicago, choosing a deep dish pizza from San Francisco.  \n\nThe roots of Little Star (I believe cause I'm trying to remember from a story about two years ago) come from some place in central Illinois.  I think someone moved from there to SF but brought their style of pizza with.  The key difference with this pizza, more than any other deep dish  is that they use corn meal and there is a fair amount of it in the crust and drizzled on the top of the deep dish.  \n\nThe addition of corn meal is an excellent addition.  I can't complain.  Of all the deep dish I've had, this is the only one that has had corn meal in it.  Of all the deep dish crusts I've had, this is one of the few that I loved eating.  It was a welcome addition and one I can't complain with.  \n\nSo where does the deep dish fit compared to all the Chicago standards?  I think its unique with the addition of corn meal.  We ordered the Little Star.  Actually, we ordered the Brass Monkey, which is the Little Star with sausage added on.  The 7x7 menu had Brass Monkey on it but that was last year and they no longer have it on the menu.  But, you can add it to the Little Star.  \n\nIts not as cheesy as Giordano's.  Not as marinara-saucy like the original Pizzeria Unos.  Not as buttery as Lou Malnatis.  Its very good deep dish pizza though.  \n\nSurprisingly, I thought the thin crust was excellent.  Once of the best and the corn meal crust really showed its strength here.  We had the chicken pesto and it was excellent.  Great thin crust pizza.\n\nWe had the garlic bread to start as well as the spicy chicken wings.  Both were very good.  The garlic bread is a spreadable garlic and butter at your table.  A slightly different twist on the normal and I liked it.  The wings were tasty too.  Not too spicy but not overwhelming and tabasco based as well.  Its served with a nice crumbled blue cheese dressing.  \n\nI had high expectations for Little Star and they didn't disappoint.

We were informed that we could not order another deep dish pizza for some reason that made no sense.  Apparently they have some rule about large parties having to order everything they want all at one time.  WTF, are you kidding?\n\nSadly, they were not kidding, and unfortunately that really soured the experience.  Allow me to make it clear, we were not being loud, rowdy or otherwise obnoxious, we had not been monopolizing the table for an inordinately long period of time, it was early, there was not a huge crowd waiting to be seated, there was no reasonable reason for such an arbitrary rule.

At least I think so; it's been two years since I've made it to Zachary's, so I will have to try that again to be sure. Regardless, Little Star is quite good.\n\nThere is much to like about their pizza. The sauce is filled with large pieces of tomatoes, and well spiced (but more of the sauce later). They use a proper amount of cheese. And the bottom crust was crispy and tasty (but more of the crust later). They also have a decent beverage selection.\n\nNow for the inevitable criticisms:\n\n1) The sauce is good, but there is too much of it. My plate was a sea of red bits when I was done eating, since I knocked about 33% of it off.\n\n2) The crust, while good, is not great. If they brushed the edges with butter like Lou's, it would kick the crust into the \"I will eat this even though it is filling me up and making me skip out on the inside part that I really want\" territory. As it is, I'll eat some of the crust, but not all.\n\n3) The service - a little spacey. It wasn't that busy while I was here, but I kind of wonder what it's like when it is packed.\n\n4) Cash only - I understand they're slackers, but still, in this modern day and age, cash only is pretty lame for a place like this.\n11/18/2007", "author": "neil c."}

I know that the offended customer did show up late, but while there was still plenty of food on the table, and more beer was served after she arrived. I never saw her eat a bite. Having seen her earlier in the day, I know that she was looking forward to some pizza with her friends. It sucks to be left out.

The pie we had (the classic) was a perfect blend of crust, sauce, cheese and toppings. As I mentioned in my review of their other location, the thing I like most about them is that they don't use as much cheese as other stuffed pizza joints do, which definitely reduces the 'brick in the gut' post-meal feeling...\n\nThey also have great salads (love the mixed salad) and drink options (this time around we tried a wine, but all I can remember about it was that it was a red and was really good). They also have one of the best (if not the best) jukeboxes around...while we were there I remember hearing New Order, the Smiths, Depeche Mode and Interpol, among others...\n\nThe service was great, and I like the dark, cozy decor (you're pretty much forced to get cozy because it gets loud in here!) as well as the location (compared to the one on Divisadero)...just remember to bring your cash (or an ATM card), because that's all they take!\n\nAs mentioned above, I'll definitely be coming back here, but may cheat on them with Zachary's and Patxi's from time to time...", "author": "Art D."}

Your cornmeal crust is scrumptious and buttery, your sauce is hearty featuring big chunks of Tomato. Your wait staff always gives me all the salt and garlic that I need without ever fucking anything up.\n\nYou serve some great ales. Thanks to you I now drink Abbey, and yes it tastes even better with little star pizza.\n\nBut I can't help but miss my regular trips to the divis location. I guess I was going on dates back then, shucks, where as now I'm sitting in a less intimate corner of your dining room with a friend having shameless foodgasms in the spot light. Yeah life's tough.\n\nI also don't feel like the pizza is as good at your location, but I can deal. There are also less hot male serves, why is that? The place is also too loud to hear the amazing jukebox, at least in the same way as at the Divis location.\n\nBut oh well, I love you anyway.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-27", "description": "After months of hearing how much better Little Star was compared to Zachary's, I finally tasted for myself. And my conclusion... Zachary's, by a VERY SLIM MARGIN. Sorry, it really just came down to the crust. \n\nIf you prefer a more doughy, bread-like crust, then go to Zachary's.\nif you prefer a more corn meal, crunchy (almost fried cookie-like) crust, the Little Star will make you happy.\n\nBut as for deep-dishyness, it ranks right up there with their use of quality ingredients. The sauces are just the right amount of tang and the cheese could be referred to as \"creamy goodness.\"\n\nThe garlic bread was also quite delicious. It's more of DIY garlic bread as you have to spread the butter and the roasted garlic cloves on the slices yourself. But since you've ordered a notoriously time consuming to make deep dish pizza, you might as well take your time with appetizers. Order some wine too. (I enjoyed the Rhone.)\n\nComplaints? Only in comparison to the way Zachary's does it, the wait seems a lot longer as you can't pre-order your pizza before being seated. Plus if the waiting area is packed with rain soaked annoyingly loud Marina/Mission-hipsters who sit with their dirty feet on the couch, then the wait is barely tolerable.\n\nBut when all is said and done, it IS damn good pizza. So Little Star gets a full 5 even though I'd personally give it a 4.5 due to my doughy-Zachary crust preference. The extra half boost is because my BF (the pizza expert) was converted and has declared Little Star better than Zachary's. Which means if you are on this side of Bay, then Little Star is definitely the place to go for deep dish.", "author": "Viv C."}

It's cheesier with the right balance of ingredients and not overwhelmed with too much sauce. The crust throughout the whole pizza is crisp and tastes great especially if you love that cornmeal/corn bread flavor. Even a day or two later the crust is still crispy when reheated in the oven and tastes just as good as it was the day it was made. Also, besides the garlic bread the spicy chicken wings are a great starter. I must admit that they weren't that spicy or spicy at all; to me at least.

The place isn't that big, but there are plenty of tables for parties of 2. So two of my buddies and I arrived here around 9:45 for a late dinner, and the wait would last around 45 minutes. Since we already made the trek out here from the East Bay, we might as well wait. In the mean time, we tried some of their blue summer wheat on draft, and that was pretty delicious. The only problem was it increased my appetite haha. \n\nAfter finally getting seated, we tried to order right away since we looked at the menu while waiting. I have to take the experience down to 4 stars since it took awhile for us to be served. We eventually ordered a large classic and some garlic bread to start. The garlic bread was pretty bomb even though my friends and I didn't know how to eat it at first. Its practically a loaf of sourdough with butter on the side and a roasted piece of garlic. Apparently you have to take the roasted cloves out and then put it on your bread. Hey, the roasted garlic actually tasted really good with the bread. Good start.\n\nThe classic pizza came out right on time after we killed the bread, and I'm not gonna lie the pizza tasted great. Normally I always eat the crust first on my pizza slices because I'd rather enjoy the main contents of the pizza. The cornmeal crust was amazing! One of the better crusts I've enjoyed, and I didn't even need to eat it with ranch! Each successive bite of the pizza had a taste of freshness to it, and two slices from the large was filling enough between 3 hungry guys. \n\nI'd heavily recommend this place for a casual date or for small groups. Pizza is a little on the pricey side for its size, but the quality and taste justify the cost. A solid 4.5 stars from me (except there's no 4.5 star rating given on Yelp).", "author": "Loren John B."}

I've long considered that venerable Rockridge pizzeria the gold standard of Chicago-style pizza in the Bay Area, and I can only name a handful of pizzerias in the country that do it as well or better--among them, Zelda's in Sacramento and Lou Malnati's in Chicago. The only problem for me: Zachary's is often too far via BART. Fortunately for me--and you--Little Star here in San Francisco belongs on the short list of great deep-dish pizzerias.\n\nWe had prepared to down some brews during a very long wait, but luckily for us we hadn't even finished our first beers (they have an amazing wine and beer selection in their hipster bar/waiting area) before we were escorted to a great table in the happily noisy, warmly decorated dining area. \n\nConfession time: my ten-year quixotic quest for real Chicago-style pizza in SF proper ended not by design, but by a happy accident. I didn't realize until last night Little Star served deep dish. I was psyched. My stomach began to growl and my heart quickened. I couldn't wait to finish up my second and third Racer 5 IPA--which we referred to as our \"appetizers\"--and dusted off my \"It was good, but not as good as Zachary's\" schpiel for later use.\n\nBut then it happened. A perfect deep-dish pizza landed on our table. It had the right look, the right consistency, the right flavor. It was Chicago-worthy. The sauce was fresh, chunky and well seasoned. The cheese underneath was clean and in proportion. The sausage had substance--a great texture and the right amount of flavor to stand out from the other ingredients, but not too much. The green peppers and properly-diced onions brought the zest. And the crust--oh, the crust--hearty, dusted with (I suspect) cornmeal, neither oily nor too dry. The crust sealed the deal. We damn near inhaled the whole thing.\n\nFortunately, there was one slice of pie left for each of us, and I enjoyed mine for breakfast. The crust held up overnight, and the sauce only got better.

Their pizzas are also completely affordable; better than more expensive pizzas I've tried, and more filling.  \n\nIf you love deep dish pizza (or haven't tried it before) and don't want to make a trek over to East Bay for Zachary's, this is a absolute-must for you to try.", "author": "Alison M."}

The waitstaff was nice and the Za was very good.  The crust is cornmeal-laden and somewhat dry and crunchy.  I prefer either doughy or flaky like the real deal at Zachary's, but to each his own.  The sauce was thick and pungent and the 'roni was savory.  The cheese was fairly flavorless.  Zachary's sauce and cheese are even more flavorful and savory in my opinion.\n\nThis place is still terrific and I'll be back.

I like this location and interior better than the Divisadero branch, but could that pizza be ever-so-slightly more savory? Or was it just the night? \n\nWe got a deep-dish Little Star Special (spinach, mushrooms, onions, ricotta, etc.) and -- at the seasoned direction of one of my favorite Yelpers -- the thin-crust Chicken Pesto (minus the chicken, sub spinach). It was my first time having Little Star's thin crust pizza. \n\nAs with my impression of the Divisadero branch, these are very good pizzas. Little Star is uber-generous with toppings, particularly for a specialty pizza shop, which generally seem to subscribe to the minimalist philosophy. As with my initial assessment at the other store, they could use a bit more spice and zip to take their pizza to the next level. \n\nI've had enough experience now to comfortably report that I prefer Zachary's. Its crust, its sauce, its seasoning are more to my liking. That said, Little Star blows Zachary's out of the water in terms of generosity and amount of toppings. Sometimes at Zachary's, I have to search for items I've order to ensure they weren't forgotten (they always are in there, but in sometimes minuscule amounts). Still, I'd likely take a minimalist Zachary's pizza over a generous Little Star. I just like it better.  Plus, Zachary's takes credit cards.\n\nThat said, Little Star is a quality establishment with fine pizza which I am happy to patronize when in town and/or with friends. \n\nNote: CASH ONLY.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Then someone, I forget who, told me that Little Star wasn't exclusively a deep dish place, so then I was like, okay, I could hang with that...\n\nI have now tried three of their pizzas (all thin crust), the \"White Pie\" being my favorite, as well as their garlic bread, caprese salad, and champagne cocktails (the one with the orange cream flavor...OMG!) Their garlic bread is just bread and butter served with a big bulb of roasted garlic! Cool concept, although not what I was initially expecting (they explain this on the menu, I just didn't bother to read it the first time around so I was surprised). \n\nTonight I tried the \"Little Star\" and they kindly converted it to a thin crust style for me, even though it is only listed on the menu as a deep dish.

Until now, the only place I could go to for solid deep dish in the bay area was one of the three Zachary's locations in the east bay. But I decided to check out Little Star on a tip from a friend.\n\nSo how did it compare? Pretty well. I'd say the pizza here has a little less depth than Zachary's (in terms on actual height of the pizza) and they don't try to overwhelm you as much with tomatoes (not that I mind). The tomato sauce also has a lot more going on, with more herbs giving it a much fuller taste than the tomatoes at Zachary's. \n\nWe ordered the \"Mother Clucker\" - the special name for the \"Little Star\" (mushrooms, spinach, feta, ricotta and garlic) with chicken added on for some protein. It was quite good and the pie had a good balance of ingredients so that you could taste all of the individual flavors. Also of note - the crust. You could tell it had cornmeal mixed into it. My friend really dug the texture that it gave, but I'm not that into cornmeal in my pizza crust. I guess it's personal preference but I'd say it didn't detract from overall taste in any way.\n\nWe also got a half mixed salad to start and it was really good (gorgonzola + walnuts!) minus the red bell peppers that I could've done without.\n\nThe space is a little tight (like all things in the Mission) but we were still able to get a table for 2 on a Friday night around 10pm within 10 mins.

ONE SLICE filled me up.  ONE.  And I'm the girl who consistently comes back from lunch with guacamole, or curry sauce on my neck and caked into my eyebrows because I decided to bathe in it.  I eat a lot.  I bet I could win a contest like that little Japanese guy who ate something crazy like 56 hotdogs in five minutes or something.  I dont think I would want to join a contest like that, though.  If I lost, I'd be too full to shame-eat.

They do this thing with the deep dishes where it's \"backwards pizza\" or something.  It goes: crust, toppings, cheese, sauce.

Again, though, the sauce overpowers everything else.  But it's really good sauce, so it's actually a very confusing situation.  Quite the quagmire, I should say.\n\nThe jukebox is totally bitchin, and the servers are entertaining and attentive.  There was even a three legged dog!!  It belonged to one of the other customers, so you may never see it there, but I shit you not, I saw it.  And it was really cute, especially after five (ok, seven) beers.", "author": "danielle p."}

Upon my first bite of \"Deep Dish\" pizza I thought to myself: \"Was it worth the wait?\" Not really. The pizza is definetely a \"meh.\" Too much hype and not enough flavor. The crust was not crispy enough, the sauce was too sour, the cheese not  perfectely melted.\n\nI don't mean to be snob here but if you think this is great pizza, then you probably have never been to Chicago or New York.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-03-27", "description": "This is the first of many, MANY pizza place reviews I intend to write so I hate to do this for my first Pizza place review but holy crap I have no idea why the hell this place is rated so high! The pizza is just plain and simply, AWFUL! Maybe it comes down to preference for types of pizza but I would like to think I am not a pizza snob by any stretch of the imagination and while this place is not the WORST I have ever had I am sad to say its pretty far down the list of decent pizza to enjoy. Disappointing to say the least considering the stellar reviews this place has.\n\nFirst off I enjoy any kind of pizza be it thin crust, thick crust, deep dish, NY style etc so I don't really prefer one type over another and seeing that Little Star offers both I thought that was a pretty cool thing since I had not had any \"real\" deep dish since my days visiting Chicago where I had the chance to experience two of the best Lou Malnati's and Gino's East deep dish pizzas. \n\nHaving said that I tend to prefer super thin crust pizza these days having found out that is what \"real\" pizza is supposed to be and am slowly starting to convert away from my days of super piled on 10 meat-fantastic pies of Round Table, Mountain Mike and the Hut lore. (Not that I will not enjoy a slice of the Round, the Hut or the Mike if its hanging around...any pizza is better then no pizza amerite??? And lets be honest any super hot and fresh pizza is probably going to be pretty damn good anyway no matter where it comes from so I am not talking down to those \"fast food\" pizza places. Heck even Dominoes is good now sometimes) \n\nBut having that perfect balance of cheese, sauce, spice and crust from an original Margherita pizza made the right way is truly the taste of real pizza that I look for now and Little Star is pretty much the farthest thing away from that for thin crust and Chicago's best for deep dish as they fail miserably in both styles of pizza. \n\nWhere you begin? I went in on  a thursday night around 8pm to meet some family for a going send off dinner and my first impressions when walking in at the Mission/valencia location was that it was small, extremely dark and super noisy. Seriously the noise level is off the chart and only magnified by the fact that they are all open tables and you sit very close to all the other tables. So much for the ambiance but the food is going to be awesome right, so who cares?\n\nChecking the menu we started with some Garlic Bread  and then ordered 1 large deep dish pepperoni and sausage and 1 large thin crust half and half of cheese and white pie. The one good thing was the bread which was pretty good sourdough with olive oil butter and a fresh clove of toasted garlic with bulb intact which was awesome but it all went donwill from there.\n\nAfter waiting for about 45 mins the pizzas came out looking and smelling pretty good but the problems started when you take a bite.\n\nThin crust: The main issue with the thin crust was that it was not thin crust at all but rather a fairly standard med depth crust that had no taste or flavor and was somewhat doughy and lacking in any good texture. Did not really serve the purpose of bringing together the flavors of the toppings as it seemed the ratio of toppings to crust was way off in favor off the dull crust. The toppings for the white pie portion were very fresh however and had decent flavor but the cheese size was just flat. No bite of seasoning in the sauce, no gooey consistency of cheese and no hint of anything that would make a cheese slice standout. Just your avg forgettable cheese pizza slice you can get anywhere in the city for a couple of bucks.  \n\nDeep Dish: This is where things really went south. The biggest problem is the crust! It is a crumbly mess of bad texture and zero flavor. It was insanely dry crust that had no layers, no flake no NOTHING. I cant go into how bad the crust was but when i took out a slice it got even worse. SAUCE, SAUCE EVERYWHERE. Why the hell is there 90% sauce and 10% cheese!?!?! There was way too much sauce and it was pretty plain thin sauce to add insult to injury. Huge chucks of tomato and hardly any seasonings to speak of. What little there was of the cheese on this pizza seemed like the best part but with barely any of it there the ratio of sauce to cheese was so far off it ruined the whole thing. The meat toppings were there and had decent flavor but thats about as good as it gets. I seriously think this may be the first slice of pizza that I just picked the toppings off to eat and skipped the rest. And this is from someone who usually finishes everyone else's peices of crust!\n\nAll in all a terrible, terrible pizza experience topped off with the too high of price of admission for well below average pizza. Avoid and go to Delfina's....or Tony's....or damn just go to the Round, the Mike or the Hut for pizza way better then the crap here. OVERRATED!", "author": "Donnie W."}

You can tell that someone really put a lot of thought and care into this restaurant, and to them it is not just a way to make money.\n\nThe surroundings are that perfect blend of shabby and chic without pretension.  The service is great.  They are attentive without being intrusive, yet they still seem to have personality.  The beers on the menu are fantastic and go really well with the food, and the prices are quite reasonable.  Even the non-pizza food is impressive.  I had the chicken wings and they were wonderful, and I am waiting for the day I show up with enough people to share one of those huge and tasty looking salads I see them bring out.  I even love the jukebox which seems to have nothing but indie-ish CDs in it.  Every ten minutes I find myself saying to whomever I am there with, \"I LOVE this song!\"\n\nThe pizza itself is mind-alteringly good.  My other-half who is a Berkeley graduate and was very faithful to Zachary's admits that this is better.  The cornmeal in the crust gives in a really special texture, and it tastes like it may have been fried a little.  What really makes this pizza special is the tomato sauce.  It is nice and lumpy with tomato pieces, and the tomatoes in it taste so FRESH.\n\nWhen the two of us go we order a large pizza for $22 and only eat half.  We eat the rest for breakfast and lunch the next day.  $22 for three meals is really good value in my book.\n\nA lot of Yelpers have complained about the wait, but we have found that if you show up between six and six-thirty the wait is non-existent despite the restaurant not being empty.  Even when there are three of us.  I do not eat huge lunches, so by this time I am ravenous and it is not inconvenient for me at all.\n\nI have only recently moved to San Francisco, and the first couple of weeks I was wondering if I had made a mistake in wanting to come here.

They had been married for 47 years and were simply going through the basic routine in life.  Everyday, roll the dough out ... sauce ... cheese ... tan in the oven.  Mr. Pizza was quite frankly sick to his stomach.  You see his dough wouldn't puff up like it used too.  His confidence was lagging and it was certainly evident in the bedroom.  Mrs. Pizza assured Mr. Pizza that it had nothing to do with him.  She explained that old dough just doesn't rise like the younger stuff.  \n\nMrs. Pizza did hold back that a certain \"zest\" was missing from their life.  Mr. Pizza used to be more romantic and inventive back in the day.  A little jalapeno here, a blend of oregano there.   Mrs. Pizza had more variety and a husband who made sure he kept his lover guessing.  Lately, he had just been bogged down and threw no more variety in there.  Everything was so basic ... regular ... boring.  She was hoping Mr. Pizza would turn it around; maybe throw in some goat cheese, pesto, anything other than basic cheese and sauce.\n\nMr. Pizza asked his friends Mr. Budweiser and Mr. Parmesan for a little help.  Mr. Budweiser appeared quite cold and frosty on the outside but he seemed to come thorough every time you needed him.  Mr. Parmesan didn't smell too good up front but every time he was matched up with somebody it was always too good to be true.  \n\nMr. Parmesan and Mr. Budweiser gave Mr. Pizza a few recommendations to spice things up and recommended he see the folks at Little Star Pizza.  Mr. Budweiser assured Mr. Pizza these guys do amazing things to dough, sauce and toppings that are bound to make him feel like a new person.  Mr. Budweiser recalled his last visit as something he hadn't experienced in a long long time.  He told Mr. Pizza that Mrs. Budweiser came back to keg multiple times that night!\n\nMr. Pizza went to Little Star and was amazed at the selection and the delicacies on the menu.  It was like he was getting his own little makeover.  He was bound to surprise Mrs. Pizza.  Mr. Pizza pulled up in his delivery truck and made his way to the bedroom.  When he got in, Mrs. Pizza nearly melted!  Her old plain dough of a man formerly known as Mr. Pizza had now turned thick and was piping hot.  And what have we here?  Olives, real tomato sauce, fresh bell peppers, fresh ground sausage.  Things started to get mighty hot and heavy.  \n\nThe next day Mr. Pizza thanked Mr. Budweiser.  He told him that Mrs. Pizza went back for more than one slice that night ... and she hadn't done that in years!  The days old old flat plain dough and cardboard crust were done!  Mr. Pizza knew settling for that was a thing of the past.  Little Star was the answer he had been waiting for.  Mr. Pizza was reluctant to divulge his secret but he knew once everyone knew about Little Star, everyone would want to go.", "author": "Bill P."}

We were hanging out at a friend's house in the Mistro (Mission/Castro) area and we all suddenly had the same craving for some deep dish pizza. Little Star was a few blocks away and was thus quite convenient. Needless to say, I had little expectations since (a) It was 9pm and I was hungry (b) the margaritas i had on an empty stomach needed a complement...and fast! \n\nThe deep dish pizza was awesome - the tomato-basil sauce was perfectly seasoned, the red onions were fresh and thinly sliced, and the big chunks of italian sausage (not the ground up kind, but actually sliced wedges of  a sausage) made all the difference. it was a pretty heavy meal, and for 4 hungry people a large sufficed. \n\nAnother reason to be completely jealous of our friends' kickass place in the Mistro.

Apparently, we missed our chance as the server indicated they were in week 2.  You can't tell from driving by, as we've been doing for months.  The space is actually a little smaller than the one in Hayes Valley, but they've taken advantage of the small space by lining the walls with benches.  Otherwise, the location looks very similar to the sister restaurant.  The tables are very tight-the women next to me managed to spill a beer on my shoes-and the acoustics are such that the vibe is not the same.  It struck me as very loud.  I noticed the jukebox was not running at all times the way it is at the other location.\n\nWe got the last open table when we walked through the door at 8:15 on a Friday night.  We were in and out within an hour.  The service left a little to be desired-my boyfriend's salad was brought out a good ten minutes before mine.  That said, it's been a year since I ordered salad at Little Star (it's something I generally try and avoid at all costs) but both were exceedingly good-his mixed full of feta, and little pieces of pepper, and they hadn't skimped on the tomatoes.  My caprese featured smaller tomatoes, which I initially turned my nose up at, until I tried them.  The waiter hustled the salad out of my hands because there wasn't room on the table to put the pizza down.  When he placed the pie on the table, we realized it wasn't our pie-it was the pie of the couple next to ours.  It was too late-my salad was gone.\n\nThe couple next to us was very annoyed that it was cash only and that there wasn't a sign.  I could understand their animousity.  It seems like a reasonable request, or at least that the server could mention it early on-they had not visited the other location and they have signs up about how they won't seat incomplete parties.  It's likely to draw a new crowd who hasn't tried the previous little star-so I'll be back lots while I can still do the walk in thing.  I think the pizza crust was even crispier, but my mind may be playing tricks on me.\n\nI'm always up for Little Star-either location.  I'm confident the kinks in the service will be worked out shortly-and maybe it was just the large crowd a few tables over that made it deafening.  I'll be back again to check out the situation shortly.", "author": "Beth V."}

Still a very dark environment like the other.  They don't have any beer on tap, which is too bad, but there's a big bottle selection.\nCash only, as reported.  But it's just as yummy!

I actually ended up here two days in a row.  I've heard great things about it from fellow foodies and my date finally brought me out to try out the deep dished goodness!  My first time there, we started off with the caprese salad, which was absolutely delicious, and that was just the start.  We ordered a small deep dish \"classic\" and the yesss, the name does the pizza justice.  Mind you, this was my first REAL deep dish pizza experience.  (I still need to visit Chicago, btw).  Everything about this pie was on point all the way down to the corn bread crust.  FYI, I'm not big on bread, but I must admit that this was my favorite part.  You know you did pizza right if you can get a non-starch fanatic to chow down on her crusts.  Too good...The next day I had a lunch date with my cousin and I raved about the place, so he insisted we went there for lunch.  This time, we split the Mediterranean Chicken, which was just as good.  I must admit though, the Classic is still on top of my list.  \n\nA couple weeks ago, I met a couple of friends at the Little Star location on Divisadero where we shared the classic deep dish, the Italian Combo thin crust, and some chicken wings.  The Italian Combo was really good too, but after trying their deep dishes for the first time, it was hard to fall in love with it.  This is why I saved my classic deep dish for last.  And about their chicken wings...they're not all that visually appealing but they are delightful lil firecrackers that dance on your tongue.  NOM NOM NOM!\n\nOne thing though, I wish they a full bar.

So when I heard that Little Star was the Zachary's of SF, my interest was piqued.  There are two locations in SF, one in the Mission, and the other in Western Addition/NoPa.  We went to the former since it was closer to the BART.  Now, I should mention that the mission district is basically the opposite of Union Square: less Chanels and Louis Vuittons and more taco stands and bum fights (yes, we actually saw one) if you catch my drift.  But that is something that I really like about SF, every district is so unique and different from each other that you feel like you are stepping into a different city at every place.\n\nOnce we got to Little Star, we were told it was gonna be a 30 minute wait, but after 2 parties didn't respond when their name was called, the cool host swooped us in with barely a 5 minute wait.  The ambiance inside was pretty cool:  brick walls, dim lights, a very urban feel.  My only complaint was that it feels they tried to fit too many tables in an already small space, it was difficult just to get into my seat.  For appetizer, we got their spicy chicken wings with blue cheese dip.\n\nI could really have eaten the whole thing as the main dish! They were really good.  I love spicy food, and these wings really had kick! So much so that one of my dining companions had to get an extra soda to wash they down.  And the cool blue cheese dip really contrast well with these spicy wings.  Then, it was onto our pizza.  For the 3 of us, we got one large pizza called the Brass Monkey (which is a secret menu pizza but not really).  It had spinach, ricotta, feta, mushroom, onion, garlic, and sausage.\n\nHmmm...nom nom nom, the Brass Monkey isn't popular for nothing.  All the toppings really stood out so that I actually tasted every single ingredient from sausage to spinach.  It wasn't overpowered at all by the tomato sauce.  And the garlic!  You really taste the garlic in this pizza and that is perfectly fine with this garlic lover.  And then there was the flaky and crispy crust (which upon research, I've learned is made from cornmeal).  I actually cut my crust and forked it with my pizza so I would have a piece of it in every bite.  So good.\n\nSo how's Little Star compared to Zachary's?  I would give LS the edge for its indulgence in garlic and that awesome crust.", "author": "Alex T."}

What makes their pizzas unique is the tomato sauce and the dough. The tomato sauce is nice and mild, easy on the palette, unlike Zachary's (too tangy....which pales in comparison....I would give them only 2.5-3 stars) \n\nThe crust is corn meal. It provides a nice and mellow sweet taste as your salivary glands slowly begin to break down those starches into sugars providing a nice backdrop to your savory toppings. \n\nRecommended dishes other than their pizzas: Caprese salad: mild and FRESH mozzarella in with balsamic and virgin olive oil\n\nspicy chicken wings: Fried to perfection, not too crispy, not too soft. If you are not a fan of blue cheese dressing, this will make you a fan as their sauce is again very easy on the palette. \n\nThere are 2 locations, this one and another on Divisadero.

Got here at 7 and we were told that we would be seated in 45 minutes and here we are an hour and 45 minutes later and we are still waiting. I usually am a patient person especially with a dinner rush hour but this experience has been ridiculous.  They could not accommodate our large group of ten people so we had to split up in a group of 4 and a group of 6 which was fine.  We didn't care where our two groups would get seated just at the same time so we would get out of this place at the same time.  They kept seating four tops and six tops that came after us instead of holding two tables for us and after an hour and a half , I don't even care about the food. I have never reviewed a restaurant while I'm waiting to be seated. I don't even want to patron this establishment but it is impossible to find another restaurant at this time. To add insult to injury, she just offered to comp one order of the garlic bread due to our 2 hour wait. Are you kidding me? 5 dollars off for a 2 hr wait? That is a slap in the face.  On top of that, we were told to order while we waited so that our food would be ready when we get seated and guess what , no freaking food for our six tops as they are seating there right now waiting.  They need a better system or just refuse large groups if they cannot accommodate large groups.\n\nThey tried to redeem themselves during service and I have to give them an A for the effort they put out.  The food was really good and that was a great redeeming factor to a disastrous evening.  We got the garlic bread and the crust on the deep dish pizza was too die for.  So Even though the night started off rough, the food really made up for it.  Plus, we were so hungry anyway so we ate everything up.  The waitress did apologize for the hostess and said that it was her first night.  I just don't understand how they could start a new employee on a busy saturday night and basically throwing her to the sharks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-10-15", "description": "As I have with my Paxti's and Zachary's reviews, I want to preface this review by saying I am a born and raised Chicagoan who has been eating real Chicago pizza since i started teething.  My benchmark is Lou Malnati's, and for those in the know, they know that I am basically setting the bar at Olympic gold and asking for nothing less.\n\nWith that said, I have been hankering for a Chicago style deep dish pizza since moving to SF over 6 months ago.  I have tried Paxti's (mediocre, not very good crust, boring sauce) and Zachary's (better crusty, nice garlicy sauce), so Little Star was the next logical step.\n\nI had to keep my mind open after stepping into the place since it doesn't exactly exude Chicago-style pizzeria, which is typical old fashioned Italian restaurant with pies instead of pasta.  Instead, it was very hip and somewhat minimalist.  While waiting, I settled up to the bar and had a very good Belgium beer in a nice frosty glass (nice!).  After getting called to my table, I looked at the menu.\n\nThe pizza selection can best be described as Chicago California fusion.  A true Chicago style pizza is not long on toppings.  There is a ton of cheese and some meat.  You might have a few veggies too, but everything is simple.  At little stars, the presence of Chicken, feta, and olives on the pizza was a bit out of whack, but I guess you have to run with the local flavor.  We ordered a 12 inch deep dish with Sausage on half and spinach on the other half.\n\nWhen the pizza came out, I I was impressed initially by the crust.  As I have mentioned in past reviews, too often the crust is too think and not buttery.  Little Star, on the other hand, nailed it.  Crust was butter soft, but with a hint of crunch in the right places and not too doughy at all.  The topping were ample (the sausage chunks could have been a bit thinker, I guess), and the cheese was excellent.

Came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago with my roommate.  We were lucky enough to find parking a block away, the wait for two was about twenty-minutes.  We sat at the bar, drank some beer as we waited to be seated.  \n\nI think it's all about the deep dish specialty pizzas.  We shared the Little Star (spinach blended with ricotta and feta, mushrooms, onions, and garlic).  The small, six slices was $19, perfect for two.  I'm speechless, still can't stop thinking about how good the pizza was, mouth-watering for sure!  The toppings, the crust, oh-my-oh-my...!\n\nLittle Star Pizza has a few appetizers (chicken wings, salad), thick as well as think crust pizzas, and cheesecake or gelato for dessert.

The salad sucked. \nThe salad had potential to be awesome.. it had blue cheese, walnuts, that spicy lettuce, olive oil. Supposedly, there was some vinegarette but I didn't taste any at all. No tang. No sweetness. And the large was way too big. The waitress could have told our party of two that the small $5.00 salad was plenty for an appetizer.\n2. No free refills. They ensure this by giving you a can every time.\n3. The wait staff is distant and cold. We didn't even get a thank you on the way out (even though we gave them not one but two thank yous!). \n4. Cash only. However, their ATM fee is very fair.. 25 cents. That probably covers their cost.\n\nThe crowd here seemed pretentious, its true, but that's not a ding on the restaurant -- they have no control over their crowd.\n\nThe my onion-pepperoni-pepperoncini pizza was FANTASTIC.

Our waitress warned us against making a thin crust pizza deep-dish, so we settled on the Little Star pizza, complete with spinach, feta, mushrooms, garlic and onions. The service was surprisingly quick, despite the business. \n\nThe pizza was delicious-- the perfect blend. We ordered the larger size, hoping that we would want to take a chunk home, which we did. While it wasn't a quiet dinner, my boyfriend was happy-- and I won some points.", "author": "Bryan B."}

Adult and kid friendly, although a perfect date place with no pressure.  A brief 15 minute wait was fine as the waiting area is in the bar and has a comfy sofa.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  We had a cabrese salad and garlic bread to start.  Yum!  Garlic bread was fresh sourdough with roasted garlic and butter on the side - Mmm!  Large deep dish pizza with cornmeal crust was fabulous. We split meat and Little Star veggie - both sides were delicious!  Slightly off the beaten path of 16th St \"restaurant row\" in the Mission, and well worth it!!!", "author": "Tania S."}

I had to try this one out because I went to the Little Star on Divisadero and knew it was awesome. When we first got there it was a Friday night so there was about a 45 minute wait. This 45 minutes turned in an hour and a half.  Strike one. The hostess kept letting people in that had just waited about 15 minutes. She had said that people had called up for reservations but when I called 4 hours earlier she had said they don't take reservations.\n\nOur time finally came and we were shown to our seats where we ordered. My friend and I were into our salad and out the corner of my eye I see something scurrying across the back of the wooden bench my friend was sitting at. I don't know perhaps my eyes were playing tricks on me. After all, it was finals time I was staying up doing projects for school and not eating. I motioned to my friend to have a look and he nearly came out of his seat. It was an insect of some sort. I thought it was a roach. I was a little scared because it kept staring at me. My friend told the waiter in a hushed manner not to alert the rest of the patrons to insight a riot. Our pizza came.  Strike 2. The waiter assured us it was from construction they were doing outside and it stirred up a lot of things. Gotten up and walked out right? What would you have done? Ya we stayed there and took our first bite into the pizza and instantly forgot about the insect we had seen a little bit ago.\n\nIt was beautifully done with excellent amounts of cheese, meat, bread. The moment I was finished with 1 slice it was enough for me. Aside from the insect invasion this place is great. Keep your eyes open!", "author": "ryan n."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-03", "description": "Based on the large number of favorable reviews here perhaps I'd have been less disappointed had we ordered the deep dish as opposed to the thin crust, but the latter is always my preference, and it bordered on bad at Little Star.\n\nConsidering the crust, it wasn't thin as much as it wasn't deep dish. Its greater fault, though, was that it was tough -- a uniform toughness from one end to the other which made it a textural bore. Chewing on dense crust provides no reward that I can think of. Crust should yield a bit in places to the teeth and any post pizza ingestion mouth trauma should result from a combination of food temperature and hunger-induced impatience, not hard, sharp edges.\n\nIt was a bit like pizza on bread that had been frozen for a long time, then partly thawed and toasted. \n\nAs for that equally important flavor, when it came time to divvy up our two leftover slices -- one each of the White Pie (mozzarella, tomatoes, feta, zucchini and olive oil) and the special pizza of the day -- topped with asparagus and carmelized onion -- my friend asked me first which slice I wanted to take home. I thought about it for a second and realized it didn't matter because they tasted nearly identical. Why? Too much cheese and a major over dousing with the dry herbs. Didn't even know there was zucchini on the White Pie 'til I re-read the ingredient list posted on the restaurant's website menu. Nor could I gather that the onions had been carmelized.\n\nSo unfortunate when cooking methods are employed and seasonal ingredients are used yet fail to present. I was tempted to make a dash back across the Bay for a slice of Gioia's asparagus, spring onion and ricotta pizza where each ingredient strikes a shining note on your palette. \n\nTwo stars for the pizza.\n\nThe generously sized mixed green salad with walnuts, feta, chopped bell pepper and ripe, red tomato wedges was the highlight of our meal. \n\nThe service was attentive from the time we walked in and were greeted at the bar and seated soon afterward, although our waiter had an oddly contrived tableside manner. When I left my fork on the salad plate which he was preparing to whisk away, he had this to SAY, more than ASK :\n\n\"Do you want to keep that silverware I think you just might\"\n\nI indulged his obvious concern for my dining preparedness and retrieved the fork from the plate and, per my usual preference, proceeded to eat the pizza with my hands.", "author": "Michelle M."}

Even though I don't have pizza that often, I don't think this was your regular deep dish pizza in that the crust was not particularly thick. The thickness is primarily caused by the amount of tomatoes that they put into the pizza, which is probably better for you anyways. I think the amount of cheese and meat was reasonable, although other people at our table would have preferred more. The crust was pretty amazing. The large pizza was a little over 20$, and three of us shared it.  Overall a nice place to eat if you are in the area.

The deep-dish crust is amazing, the toppings are always fresh, and it has real left-over staying power (not like Delfina, where the pizza quickly starts to fade as soon as it leaves the oven until 15 minutes after it is baked the crust is crewy and bland- yuck).\n\nWhen we eat in the servers are always super nice (esp. the bigger guy w/the beard last night. Very friendly!). My only real beef with this place is that, in the 5 times we have ordered to go, they have never gotten our order right. Usually this means that I  (the meat eater) get two small pizzas and my girl (the veggie) gets none. After the third time this happened we started opening the boxes at the restaurant before we left, and we still would end up with the wrong pizzas.\n\nDue to the time involved in baking a new one we usually just throw up our hands, take the wrong pizzas and my girl will get a falafel from Truly Med.

We had a Classic with no sausages and with garlic (friend's boyfriend's request, not mine) and it was pretty good - very heavy on the tomato flavor. I would mostly taste the chunky tomato flavor (each pizza basically looks like a sea of red) and then the pepperoni, mushrooms, etc. under the tomatoes, as opposed to most deep dish pizza places that will put the toppings above the tomatoes. It makes for a very interesting and fresh flavor nonetheless; I also had the vegetarian and the spinach went very well with the tomato. Overall, pretty good shot.\n\nOrders take a while though - we were smart and went around 6:30 on a Friday night, so we got a table after waiting ten minutes or so, but even then the waitress advised us that our order would take about 25-30 minutes to finish and it did. So bring some people who you like to talk with. Bring loud talkers too - it's very loud in there. Also kind of dark (I'm not as partial to the places that consider a candle at the table sufficient light, as Little Star is).

The music was also great, my friend remarked that his \"coolness factor\" raised four points because he was eating in a restaurant that was unabashedly playing Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and Arcade Fire and I agreed.  \n\nTurned out *I* was the only person who knocked over a cup.

My experience with deep dish pizza in Chicago (Gino's, Giordano's) and authentic Chicago pizza in the bay area (Zachary's in Berkeley) has not been great. In all these places, I did like the crust, but the cheese-sauce-topping proportion was not to my liking and it just felt like a gooey mess. I prefer fluffy crust style deep dish pizza in Pizza Chicago (Palo Alto, Sunnyvale) which is much less goo-ier. \n\nWell, Little Star fell right in the middle of the two. The crust was fairly thin (for a deep dish) and crispy, but the cheese-sauce-toppings proportion was much better balanced. We had a mixed salad to start with. The menu described the salad as having red onions and red bells. However we only found itty-bitty pieces of these two, so it was a little disappointing, (well, maybe not that much for the onions) but the salad was decent overall. The pizza, we got a half-and-half of the Little Star and the Vegetarian with pesto as a topping (yes, just a topping, not as a sauce). The pizza was quite good. The crust is quite distinct and the sauce and toppings were nice too. For imaginative combinations of toppings, I still prefer Pizza Chicago in the south bay though.", "author": "Manjesh N."}

We decided to try some classic items recommended by other Yelpers - including the Spicy Chicken Wings with baby carrots and blue cheese dressing. Not fried wings (almost healthy!) but nice and spicey with black pepper. Very good - will order that again.\n\nWe ordered the Classic Deep Dish pizza topped with sausage, mushrooms, green peppers and onions. I am an Italian pizza fanatic and usually I will turn my back on the deep dish. Little Star's Classic however is not to be ignored - excellent, moist crust that stands up to the hefty toppings - including the delicious and chunky tomato sauce which crowns the pie.\n\nImpressive - will be back for more!", "author": "Mariangela S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-01-29", "description": "This review is for two things in particular: the bar and dining with more than 2 people.  The people behind the bar last night (two women) were singularly bitchy.  Our small group arrived at 7:30 and immediately ordered a bottle of wine while we waited for a table.  I thought the wine would be in a carafe (you know, because the WINE LIST SAID IT WOULD), and so I was confused when she brought out a bottle.  She said \"we only have one Sangiovese\" and rolled her eyes.  Fine.  So I took the bottle back to my crew on the couch and didn't realize I'd forgotten my credit card.  About 45 minutes into our 90 minute wait (more on that in a second), she came over to me and stuck her hand in my face.  My credit card was in her hand.  \"Oh my gosh, thanks so much!\" I said.  She scowled and walked away.  I thought I was maybe a little sensitive about it, but before I could ask my friends if they saw that, they were talking about \"what an angry bartender\", \"nice bitchface\", etc.  So that blew.  Particularly because I was the host of this small party, and I wanted to show them a good time.\n\nThe hostess was in NO HURRY to seat us.  Sure, there were a lot of people there, but as we sat and waited, couples would come in, get seated, eat a deep dish (read: slow cook time) pizza, linger over wine, pay the bill, and walk out, full.  Still we sat, with our bottle of wine, playing musical chairs while we waited.  This happened over and over -- couple comes in, gets seated, eats, leaves.  Finally, she says \"you know, you can order takeout from the bar\".  So we did.  When we finally got a table, an hour-and-a-half after arriving, and after half a dozen couples had come in, eaten, and left, our pizza was ready and all the server had to do was keep the water filled.  But of course, we still had gratuity added to the check.\n\n(Why did we not leave earlier, you ask?  I dunno.  Probably the stupid bottle of wine.)\n\nLong story short, the pizza is decent (Zachary's is better), but the attitude raised so much bile that I could barely taste it.\n\nIf you want to \"dine in\", then bring one friend.  ONE.  And warn the small groups waiting on the couch that they're in for a doozy of a wait, because the hostess apparently hates groups.  But really, with a place like that, takeout is definitely the way to go.  And finally, just do takeout from Zachary's, where the people are happy to have your business and don't treat you like a nuisance.", "author": "A W."}

When we called in our order, we were told half an hour. It was over an hour until our order was ready. Busy on a Saturday is fair, but just tell us an hour, yo.

One of the people who used to live in Chicago said this was the place to go if you wanted authentic Chicago style pizza. \n\nWe showed up around 8pm and it was pretty crowded. Our wait was about 30 minutes. The bar was full and the only other option inside to sit down at was a 3 chairs and a couch. I only point that out because I was annoyed by these 2 women who were hogging the couch. My three other friends sat in the chairs but the women were not about to move to let me sit down. I was so ready to tell them to move the f over. But they left after about 15 minutes. (ok - got the venting out of the way) The hostess did come to inform us that she was just waiting for a group of people who were already finished with their meal and were just chillin. I appreciated that she came and updated us.\n\nWhen we finally sat down we ordered the caprese salad - fresh mozarella, basil, tomatoes drenched in a balsamic vinegar/Olive oil mix. The tomatoes were fresh and the dressing was just right. There was also 2 pieces of garlic bread that came with it that was perfect to dip into the balsamic vinegar. \n\nWe ordered 2 large deep dish pizza: the Classic and the Little Star. As a veggie I was only able to eat the Little Star. It had chucky pieces of tomotaes and a fair amount of cheese. There were pieces of garlic that I would randoming bite into and at times it seemed a little over powering. I never tasted the feta that was suppose to there. I loved the crust. Although, I never tasted it except when I ate the outter portion. It was crunchy and buttery.  I was full after 2 slices.\nOverall I was extremely satisfied with my meal. But it was not exceptionally enough to deserve 5 stars.\n\nAs the stand alone veggie in the group I didnt have the oppurtunity to try both. But out of my party 2 people prefered the Classic and one other prefered the Little Star. They all like both pizzas though. The only common complaint was the garlic.\n\n***Note: My friend calculated the size difference and price difference and we figured out for about and extra $5 for the large you get just under double the amount of the small pizza. So my suggestion...Upgrade to the large.***", "author": "Richard C."}

It's still not nearly close to the pizzeria in Italy, but it's awesome in its own american way.\n\nI hate thick crusts pizza. Hate it. No italians do it that way. When you go to a local pizzeria, the crusts are as thin as paper that the pizza takes 3 minutes to cook. It's so good yet so light that I myself, a girl who's always on a diet, and never finishes her food (when she's on a diet), could eat an entire 12\" pizza.\n\nSo, why???? Why do I choose to go to a Chicago deep dish pizza place? If it wasn't for the Top Chef challenge, I'd never had tried it. It's something that holds a significant position in the culinary world, and it's something that I've never had before. I knew I might not like it, but just had to try at least once.\n\nGot a deep dish with whole bunch of toppings. I have to say, it's just not my thing, like what I expected. But it's actually very delightful. The crust is thick, but not overly clogged with sauce/toppings, and the crust is crispy on the edge and soft inside. It's so surprisingly light considering how much dough is there. I was very please with the experience. \n\nAlso got the thin special of the day, white pie with pear, gorgonzola, candied walnuts, and sauteed onions. It was sooooooo delicious and sooooo refreshing. The only thing I don't like is that they \"cubed\" the pears, instead of thin slice them. Sliced pears would not only stay on the pizza better, it'll also be more flavorful.\n\nOverall, wonderful experience, nice cute date spot, but also good for friends' catch-up.

Little Star is essentially a spin on Zachary's. They're doing well to get the four stars, not many make it to such rarefied heights.\n\nEntering the doorway to Little Star on Valencia during dinner hours, you will be greeted by a small line and a 20+ minute wait. Never fear, you can get appetizers and drinks in the entryway. Mmmm, their Caprese salad is so fresh and yummy, it rivals the best I've had on a trip to Bologna and beats anything I've had in a San Francisco restaurant. I'm not eating Italian food in SF every night, but I eat Italian about once a week. So, I'm not easily impressed by just any green leaves and cheese. Also available in the entryway: the coldest Thomas Kemper sodas known to humankind, served in a pint glass so cold, air condenses on the glass and forms ice on the rim. Oh, and the glass is filled with ice. There must be no better place to cool off on a hot day with a Black Cherry soda.\n\nI'm on the fence between Zachary's and Little Star. Both their thick crust pizzas are among my favorite treats. I could choose either. Fortunately, they're on opposite sides of the bay. Essentially, LS's crust is flaky and crumbly and Zach's is flour or whole wheat flour. Take your pick. I give the edge to Little Star for fresher tomatoes, and herbs in their pies. You will not be doing yourself a disservice if you order the thin crust pizza. The Margherita is just right. Someone there knows their pizza. I'd put the Margherita up there with Pizzeria Delfina. Yes, solidly in Delfina's class, but no, not better. I recommend coming here with four people unless you want to put some tables together.

That is just downright impressive!\n\nFinding the restaurant was not difficult with our GPS unit, but parking was a challenge.  We finally found a parking garage 2 blocks away which was about $5 for two hours.\n\nFrom the outside Little Star doesn't look like much, but when you go inside it is quite nice. Much nicer than I expected for a pizza joint.\n\nThe pizzas are a good size.  A small is $16 and a large is about $20 but a small will feed 2-3 people.  \n\nThe people working there are quite nice and when I whipped out my laptop they noticed that I had yelp open and told me they check it every day.  They were very concerned about making sure we had a nice meal.\n\nService was friendly but a little slow.  But it seemed to fit the mood of the restaurant.  You don't go here for fast service, but for good food and the ambiance.\n\nBetween the two of us, we ordered way, way more food than we could eat, mainly because we wanted to try it all.  We had the garlic bread appetizer (~$4) which I'd say was OK.  I probably wouldn't order it again but it was good.  They serve it with a side of creamy butter which the staff told me is whipped with olive oil to make it spreadable.  And that butter was awesome.\n\nWe also ordered the wings, and they were very good.  I'd recommend them to anyone.  They are not \"hot\" but they are spicy, meaning they have some unusal spiced flavor.\n\nWe also got one thin, and one deep crust pizza (~$17 each) - both small.  Somehow we managed to eat 1/2 of each, though we were stuffed.  The pizza was truly excellent.\n\nOne drawback to the place is that it is not very intimate.  You will hear everything being discussed at the tables beside you, so I wouldn't recommend it for a business or romantic evening.  But if you want to go get some really high quality food you can't go wrong here.  Personally I'll be returning on future trips to San Francisco.\n\nPlease note, this is the first 5 star rating I've given on Yelp.", "author": "John P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-01-10", "description": "Hype. Lots of it.\n\nFor deep dish, Little Star pizza isn't nearly as good as Patxi's or Zachary's pizza. They don't cook their pizzas long enough (you have to wait 40 minutes for your pie to finish at Zachary's, 25min+ baking time), and as a result, the flavors don't mesh as well. Moreover, they don't add enough tomatoes. In fact, compared to the other dominate two--they simply don't add enough ingredients all together. I should struggle to bring a slice of pizza from the pan to my plate. Toppings should fall all over the table, and there should be a sufficient amount falling off that I break the five second rule once or twice to in an effort to bring them all back to my mouth. If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in my face.\n\nMoreover, the spicy chicken wings were baked (or tasted of it). Blasphemy. I don't believe in baked wings. If they are baked, that needs to be prefaced on the menu. My wings should be crunchy and actually spicy. \n\nThe garlic bread appetizer was good, but could have been improved. LS servers you warm bread accompanied by a bulb of roasted garlic and a ramekin of butter mixed with olive oil. The bread was good, and the garlic was perfectly roasted. While the butter mixed with olive oil is a great marketing pitch, it was actually a bit of an annoyance. Mashing the garlic and the butter-oil medley proved to be a pain in the ass. The garlic was piping hot, and the butter-oil mixed didn't hold when mixed in the garlic--resulting in a slimly, oily mess difficult to spread on the bread. Sure, It tasted good, but it probably would have tasted better if they held the olive oil to maintain consistency. LS should have provided a better means for mixing, or have the server mix it for us--and add a couple of herbs for color.\n\nI've totally knocked Little Star. But you know what, it's still good pizza. But if you want to complete with the big boys, you've got to master the details. If you're in the east bay, got to Zachary's--if you're in the SF, hit up Patxi's. But if you're in the barrio, it's still not a bad option.", "author": "John M."}

We were told the wait would be about thirty minutes and decided to stick it out despite the aforementioned woman and one of dinning/drinking companions loud and drunken conversation about whether or not carrying a child for nine months was any big deal and a debate about the rights of fathers that was so cringe inducing I was happy they were clearly so wasted that they wouldn't remember it in the morning. \n\nSince we turned out to be the only party of two we got seated within ten minutes and were waited on promptly. Our eyes were much too big for our stomachs as we chose both the large salad, garlic bread, and a large classic deep dish (sausage, mushrooms, green peppers and onions) and a nicely priced bottle of wine from there short but well chosen selection. Everything came out in a timely fashion and the mixed salad was lovely with delicious fresh tomatoes and perfectly dressed, the roasted garlic and warm butter for you to slather on bread to your taste was also a lovely twist. \n\nThe pizza arrived shortly after we finished the salad and was delicious with a firm and tasty crust and huge chunks of sausage. As has been mentioned the place is crowded, small and noisy and this was not helped much when the drunken party from earlier was seated next to us and apparently decided to mend their earlier argument with a drunken sing along of Def Leppard's Love and Affection, so I can't quite to commit to five stars but I will definitely be back due to my new love of deep dish.

Got our orders taken fairly quickly by our watiress, then it all went downhill.     She brought our drinks and Greek salad appetizer after about 10 minutes, but as we split the salad between plates, we noticed it had no olives (um, kind of key to a greek salad, even a simple one....)   Checked the menu, and indeed, olives were in the delicious description.   It took us too long to get her attention, and when we pointed out there were no olives, her answer was 'oh, its new so I guess they don't know how to make it yet'   and she didn't offer to do anything about it.   We had to ask her to fix it.  She took our plates and told us she would get a new salad......great!   Then we waited, and waited and waited.....15-20 minutes, no new salad.     How long can it take to make a greek salad that has only 5-6 ingredients?    \n\nOur pizza was brought to the table (yay!), and about 2 minutes later our salad finally arrived.....although we had originally ordered a small salad they brought a large (maybe as an apology?).   And, it had a few olives now.     Once we tasted the pizza (delicious) we decided we wanted a few pizza condiments (dry peppers, grated cheese etc).   But, the waitress did not return after we got our food.   Ever.

I appreciated this fact but we agreed a tad under seasoned and the blue cheese needed to be thicker. We decided on the classic deep dish and the thin crust white pizza. The deep dish was impressive. Unfortunately, it was a slightly watery and it was mostly crust (insanely good crust) and sauce, not my favorite. The white pizza really let the flavor of the dough shine but I was missing tomato sauce. Hmmm. I'm thinking that the thin crust cheese pie with tomato sauce must rock!

I eat pizza probably three to five times a week.  I have eaten every type of pizza and enjoyed them all, almost...  I can say that there is only one piece of pizza that I remember that was not good.  And, by not good, I mean it was horrible- and the place in Glen Park that I bought that rubbery cheese piece of doughy grossness is long gone, having been replaced by Gialina (another great pizzeria that gets its own review).\n\nNow to Little Star...I grew up on Ken's Pizza in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.  It was thin, thin crust and extra crispy goodness.    That is NOT Little Star.  \n\nLittle Star does offer a thin crust, but it is heresy to eat that when you can enjoy the thick crust goodness that makes this place so special.  I have not tried every pizza they have-I am only a pepperoni and/or sausage guy.  And, boy do they make a great deep dish half pepperoni and half sausage pizza.  \n\nWhen I need to put something a little healthier than dried meats like pepperoni into my system, I have to say that the salads are really hearty and very good.  \n\nWhile I have eaten in the restaurant a couple of times, pizza is best when it is eaten in front of your own TV in your comfy bunny slippers.  Not that I actually have comfy bunny slippers (anymore) the point is that Little Star travels well.  \n\nWhile it can get a little uncomfortable having a hot pizza with the name Gerald scribbled in crayon on the box (the kitchen is loud so they though Joe was Gerald...),sitting on your lap for 15 minutes, the discomfort was worth it.  \n\nWhen we got home and dished up the slices, I wasn't even seated before  Faith (the border collie) was  waiting for her share.  Happily scarfing down a slice of the best deep dish pepperoni around using knife and fork (which are required for this kinda pizza), I stopped at the crust's edge and got a piece for Faith.

It was a half-block from where we were seeing a play that night and pizza sounded good.\n\nThe location in the Mission is very nice. They pack the tables in, yet you feel that you have a enough space to chat and don't feel crowded. We arrived 15 minutes late (damn you lack of parking in the Mission!) but the hostess accommodated us, which seems to be rare based on the other reviews. When seated we were offered a table by the front window or towards the back. Our Hostess asked if we wanted a seat near the window or further back. After we choose back, he said, \"Are you ok with sitting near the kitchen?\" I really appreciated the fact that he said that. Our waiter was very kind and attentive.\n\nWe split an aptly named Little Star pizza that was delicious. It absolutely hit the spot. The flavors mixed well and there was not a dominant ingredient. I greatly enjoyed the entire meal and highly recommend this restaurant. I won't be throwing around five stars too often, but this succeeded.", "author": "Justin C."}

They don't deliver though, so it took a long while before we tried it. This past Monday, roomie and I decided to walk down there and try this fabled pizza. Ya, we could have eaten it there, but the whole point of pizza is to sit at home and be lazy and watch tv while you eat it, not to sit in a restaurant. We chose the Little Star special flavor. It's vegetarian with different cheeses. The pizza was cold by the time we walked all the way home. Annoying. We had to warm it in the oven. Once we did though - yum! So many of my favorite things on one pizza! So yummy! The sauce was awesome, the blend of flavors, awesome. I love Chicago deep dish pizza! The crust was very good too, nice and soft. I suppose it was cornbread.  I have to say, it's not as good as Patxi's cornbread crust. Patxi's has deep dish Chicago pizza and is closer to my house. Plus they DELIVER. Little star's sauce was a tad bit better, though I like both. Little Star's pizza combinations, esp on this one, are better.  Patxi's crust and delivery are better, and you get a hot pizza and to be lazy. So, it's a tie. On a lazy day, neither of us will make the trek over to get this, but once in a while, we'll be craving it. It was so good, I was full and lamenting how I couldn't fit another piece. We both had to rest up in order to stuff more in our stomachs. I had 3 pieces in the end, over some hours. SO FILLING. Yum.", "author": "Merredith L."}

Solidly!  but it dawns on you that you could have probably thrown a rock from the doorstep of your hostel and hit 3 places just as good and saved yourself a heck of a trip across a busy metropolis.  remember this lesson and you'll be happier in life and save yourself a lot of time.\n\ni do not understand why people get so bent out of shape about decent pizza.  i mean, are people really so starved for good pizza that they all have to go to the same pizza place?  is pizza rare these days?  or it is GroupThink?  mob mentality.  we must ALL GO to the same places all the time. if they are going, i must go.  we must all go.  pizza is basically pizza.  the salad was pretty much a salad. don't get me wrong.  it was good and all.  the sangiovese wasn't bad either.  the mixed salad was fresh and the dressing was tastey, but rare?  ah no.  i'll give it a four, i suppose but when you're talking about the basics (and i include pizza in that) the line between 3 and 4 starts to get blurry.  our group shared two deep dishes.  one veggie and one sausage.  i think that and the salad was good for a group of four.  \n \nthe spot was slick and clean and the decor was well put-together for a pizza place. i expected a lot more sloppy and hap-hazard but this was clearly a pizza place that thought it was a sit-down restaurant.  :)  which it is.  but most pizza places think of themselves not as restaurants but as \"places that make pizza\" and simultaneous, it just so happens that they have places to SIT while you all can eat the purchased pizza.... \n \nlittle star definitely puts itself in the \"restaurant\" category.  not a bad deal.  again, i can't see the super-special need that required us to drive half-way across town to go here at 8pm on a friday and wait like an hour for a seat with a room crowded with 60 or so people also waiting for tables.  by the time i sat down i was both really, really hungry and my expectations had soared so high from seeing the lines of people that i was pretty disappointed to find out that they poured regular ol' sangiovese for wine and when making their pizza, they used regular old dough and veggies and sausage like every other pizza joint i've ever been to.", "author": "dan h."}

Can't you see I'm superchunkalicious today?!?!?!\", but that would have been downright hormonal. Instead, I decided that I would nibble a bit at Little Star and enjoy the leftovers later, in my kitchen, with the lights out, where no one could see my fat ass chowing down. \nI should have suspected that Plan A would be abandoned as soon as we got within a block of Little Star. The air in that whole neighborhood is infused with the smells of melting cheese, roasting tomatoes, and herby goodness. My heart started beating faster, I began to salivate...and I knew I was done for.\nOpening the door to Little Star is like waking up in heaven. The smell is out of control. I know I gained a pound or two just breathing the air in there. We got a large Little Star pie and I swear we spent the first 5 minutes photographing it...ok, PB did because he's the photographer and when I see food, all that's going through my head is, \"FEED ME\". The pies are like art. And delicious to boot. Just the right ammount of tomatoes, a crust so perfect it's beyond description, and delicious ingredients made me forget about my weight problems and body issues just long enough to eat a huge slice. \nWe both agreed that it was a tiny bit cheesy for our taste, so next time we'll get something with more veggies. Either way, we're intent on becoming regulars and looking forward to trying out the Western Addition branch as it's closer to us, making the whole driving-home-in-a-food-coma thing a little easier. In the meantime, I'll be saving up my Weight Watchers points, because next time I'm not stopping at one slice. \n\n**ps- our soda was served in icy, icy pint glasses fresh from the freezer.

I am also very proud of Little Star Pizza for being fucking unbelievable.\n\nThe reason for my pride goes as follows:\nI had left 111 Minna after a Friday Night happy hour during which I had put away more drinks that a lady should mention.  Nick H and I went to his buddy's place on the panhandle where we decided a pizza or two was definitely in order.  So we tracked across GodKnowsWhere until we got to Little Star, where Phel M had called in an order prior to our departure.  The place was hopping.  It was not your typical dirty or Italian-themed pizza place, but looked rather like a hip Asian-fusion style restaurant.  We sat on a bench while we waited for our take out.  We remained on this bench as we wolfed down about three pounds of pizza.  Each.  A waiter was good enough to bring us plates and napkins rather than tell us to scram.  Good man.  So we finally walked home, where we devoured another pound of pizza and I routinely declared my undying love and devotion to this new pizza mecca.\n\nWhy am I proud?  Because I ate way more pizza than I can normally handle.  Furthermore, my drunken mind was so impressed with the mind-blowing quality of the pizza (deep dish with cornmeal crust... SO TASTY!!!) that I actually remembered the name of the joint AND where it's located.  Usually I don't sweat these details, but clearly it left such a strong impression that I would happily trek over from East Bay just to chew on crumbs from other people's leftovers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-03-08", "description": "The four days prior to going out to Little Star,  we had an average of four hours of sleep a night due to a sick baby, lack of marital bliss due to a MIA husband, pour conversation topic choices on my part, and just general exhaustion because of the stresses of  everyday family life. We try once a week to go on a date. We usually look forward to it and sometimes we are even excited about it. In this particular  case I think we  wanted so bad to want to be excited when in reality all we really wanted to do was go home and sleep for five days strait waking up for snacks, bathes, and sex and then returning to sleep for another five days. Ah life before responsibilities. So the general mood of the evening was really working against us and our ability to thoroughly enjoy the pizza experience and basically made for the worst date ever!\n\nDespite all the drama that surrounded that night I must say that the dining endeavor was lovely. The dining room was smaller than we pictured and the decor was a little higher end looking than most pizzerias. It made for an intimate environment. I enjoyed the fact that they stuck with the traditional parm and pepper shakers at the tables and the thick red glass votive candle holders that looked like they belonged in a stereotypical mafioso Italian restaurant set in a really bad movie. It was just a hint of kitch and I liked it. It was a bit dark though, which on another night may have been romantic but came across as a setting for  a covert operation instead. In fact I do believe that I saw a man in a long trench coat, dark glasses and a hat sitting  in the corner passing a mid-sized manila envelope to a man in shorts, a safari hat, and a Hawaiian shirt. Secret agents? Or was it just an example of the diverse fashion senses that many San Franciscans sport? We will never know. It would also be a great spot for those over forty woman dating an under thirty man to come and look her most marvelous. Fine lines don't really show in dark atmospheres. The bathroom was the crowning glory though. Very modern for a place that has a one room unisex bathroom. Everything was automated! You could have managed to go in and out of there without ever touching anything if they had put the trash can closer to the door and had a pop lock instead of the twisty kind. I really have trouble enjoying sharing public restrooms with men, no matter what the floor of the bathroom is always wet and you always have to touch the toilet seat in order to pee. Ick, that was the only unautomated thing in there, the toilet seat. There should be a requirement that all unisex bathrooms have an automated seat that lowers when the toilet is flushed and has a floor button for the men to press with their foot to lift it, then no one would have to touch the seat ever. Genius.\n\nNow to the food. We perused the menu and then had a brief conversation about how guilty we would feel if we passed up a salad for garlic bread. Lets face it, who can really pass up good garlic bread? There was a ramekin of softened butter, warm bread, and a roasted head of garlic. The only thing that was missing was a hint of salt. If there was some chunky salt on the plate or table or if they had salted the garlic a little heavier it would have been perfect. Although I have to say I do enjoy the crisp outer and soft greasy inner of a traditional piece of really good garlic bread. You know the kind, where your lips are shinny for the rest of the evening, but it was delicious and unique, which I always appreciate. \n\nWe then ordered the deep dish little star pizza. I have to say that my favorite part about it was the crust. It was crisp on the edges as well as on the bottom. No one likes a soggy bottom, but it was soft enough to eat with ease. It had spinach, feta, ricotta, tomato sauce and provolone I believe. The sauce was delightful and the cheese melty. Delicious! I had a glass of wine and the hubby had a beer, what a luxury. \n\nDon't worry kids, nothing swells the heart, extracts the tears and warms the belly like a full stomach, making up, a kiss on the nape of your neck goodnight, and falling asleep being hugged tight by the one you love and  want to be loved by. Peace has been restored, maybe the pizza is magic or maybe sleep cures all?!", "author": "Esa Y."}

Great deep dish pizza with a crunchy cornmeal crust. Horrible service that practically ruined our whole experience here. \n\nWe had a pretty snippy waittress, but we didn't mind the curt service during the meal. It's a pretty busy place and we were there on a Saturday evening with a party of 6. We were dining at the same pace as everyone around us (i.e. we weren't hogging a table or taking our sweet time ordering, etc). We had just ordered our last round of beers and were finishing up our pizza when the server brought the bill. She handed it to us while saying in a very rude tone that if we wanted to finish our drinks, we'd have to do it at the bar because there were people at the bar who had been waiting a long time to eat  at our table. \n\nI've never been kicked out of a table before. This sort of behavior would possibly be understandable if we had been there for an hour or were just ordering rounds of drinks without ordering food or had finished our meal a while ago, but the pizza had just been cleared and we hadn't even paid the bill yet. Four of the six of us have worked in the food/restaurant service industry and know well enough not to hog a table after paying a bill. And of course if we were going to turn into a drinks-only party we would have moved on. But there was no need to tell us in a bitchy tone to hit the road. This is also an especially bad move if the bill hasn't been taken care of yet.  i mean, i know this is the mission but that doesn't mean you can kick me out of table before i've finished my beer or my meal. geez. \n\nSo we left a smaller tip than we would have if the service had been pleasant (we are usually 20 percent tippers) and had we been allowed to finish consuming the meal we were paying for. But upon leaving, we discovered that my friend left a shopping bag at the table. And when she sent her boyfriend inside to get it, the waittress was holding it hostage while demanding to know why our tip was less than generous. He explained that he has worked in restaurants throughout the Bay area for years and had never been asked to leave a table before, especially before the bill had been paid. And he was pretty insulted, especially as we were celebrating a birthday! He practically had to claw the shopping bag out of her hand, even when a second member of our party joined him to see what was taking so long. She (the birthday girl!) explained that we were not happy with our service and that while we left a tip, it would have been bigger had the service been polite or at least humane. \n \nI know that table space is a precious commodity in the Mission. So next time, mean waittress lady, let me finish my beer and then just say in a POLITE tone, \"we'd love you guys to stay and keep the party going, but if you're moving on to drinks only, can i help you find some seats at the bar so we can help our other customers get their grub on?\" (We would have politely moved too!).", "author": "Mindy S."}

Although the takeout was delicious, the pizza is simply designed to eat in.\n\nOur entire experience was fabulous from start to finish. First, the hostess quoted us about a 15-20 minute wait, but we were seated at a spacious 4-top within about 5 minutes. Our ebullient waiter, Ian, kept is satisfied and entertained. He had some great recommendations - doing two small pizzas of different halves for the four of us - so we could try as much as possible of the different pizzas.\n\nWe started with some garlic bread. This is not your typical garlic bread, though, folks. We're talking warm, soft, crusty sourdough with a crock of softened butter, accompanied by a whole head of roasted garlic. Oh yeah, baby. In case you were wondering, insanely delicious. We also split a mixed green salad which was good, yet basic.\n\nNext, the pizzas arrived. The deliciousness of the pizzas impairs my ability to form sentences. Cornmeal. Cheese. Sauce. Mmmmmmmmmmm. Absolutely delicious. I consider myself somewhat of a deep dish connoisseur, as I spent my college years devouring Zachary's in Berkeley, and have had many a trip to Chicago where I dined at Pizzeria Uno (the ORIGINAL - far superior to the chains), Gino's East, and Lou Malnatti's in Lincolnwood (a suburb of Chicago). I've also had Paxti's several times, which, honestly, has never quite done it for me. It's decent, but doesn't hold a candle to the cornmeal-y goodness of Little Star. Yum yum yum.\n\nAt the beginning of our meal, Ian told us we had to save room for the cheesecake. I was thinking, yeah sure, sounds good but I'm gonna invest my calories on this here pizza. However, my boyfriend being the cheesecake lover that he is, we ended up ordering a slice. And let me just say, holy cow (literally). The cheesecake was perfect. A substantial graham crust and beautifully light and tangy. Not too dense, not too sweet. Ian also brought us a complimentary generous bowl of Cookies and Cream gelato. He said it was their newest dessert and he wanted to know what we thought. One of our dining companions said, \"Oooh, Jill. He must know you're a yelper.\" I joked with Ian, \"Ahhh... are you just giving us the royal treatment because of my yelper status?\" He says, \"okay... remember... my name is Ian. That's I-A-N\" Loved it. :) FYI, the gelato was super delicious, but the cheesecake is where it's at.\n\nI think my meal at Little Star was potentially the most fattening meal of my entire life.

I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is pretty cramped and noisy. They really cram a lot of tables into a small space - if you are sitting against the brick wall you even have to move the table to get out which did provide an opportunity to meet our neighbors to the right when their table was suddenly right next to ours. It would be cool if all the tables were on wheels and every few minutes we got all switched around.\nWe spied a sweet looking giant salad on a nearby table and ordered it along with a small thin crust pie. I know they are known for their pan style pizzas but I'm not crazy about that style - a bit too heavy for me. The salad featured some tasty tomatoes but overall it was a bit underwhelming - good but not as great as it looked. The pie was quite good - not at all greasy and the small size was perfect for 2. On the way out my date asked for a card so she could remember the place and possibly review it here but they didn't have any cards so the super cool bartender lady took a postcard and decorated it with a picture of a slice of pie (could be savory - could be sweet) and stamped it along with our hands with a little red star.

After being told the pizza would take about 40 minutes to prepare (holy cow, are you familiar with how Zachary's operates? Wouldn't mind learning considering 1. small size of restaurant, 2. wait time for seats 3. time it takes to cook pizza), we decided to order an appetizer: the garlic bread. Little did we know that the garlic bread would take 35 minutes. i.e. appetizer for snacking while waiting for pizza, was actually appetizer to hurry up and finish before pizza came. It was delicious though, roasted garlic, creamed butter and toasty bread. Guy from our party complained, 'why did the garlic bread take so long?' Waitress replies, 'that's how long it tastes.\" me: '...' Anyway... the pizza came. Yes, lots of corn starch in the crust. But i like it. However, the sauce was very bland, like lots of tomatoes and not enough spice. For this reason, zachary's also wins on the flavor category of pizza. Anyway we finish and eat and the waitress takes forever to process our check. We catch another waiter and he tells us to wait five minutes and if our waitress hadn't come by by then, he'd process it for us. right. the service is lacking. so is the pizza. but not the crust. again cash only! for pricy pizza.

So I live all the way in the richmond much nearer the nopa location, so how did I end up here? I came all the way out to the mission initially to get some Palestinian food. But, that never happened because they never allowed me entrance, as they claimed that they had a large private party coming in, I suspect other reasons such as closing soon, and the  fact that I am blind and this place wasn't all that keen to help me last time I was at the middle east in place. But anyway, this review is not about old Jerusalem, so let's move on. It was probably nine for tea at night, and I had to figure out what to do, I certainly couldn't return to the Richmond and still find food so after a whole lot of searching and a phone call and a long bus ride and somewhat walk with some help of this very kind gentleman and I ended up here true, I got there around 10:25 and I finally got my pizza at 10:45 this does not dismiss or allow the less than minimally attentive service. I understand this was very near to closing, but I still expect as long as they're open a level of professionalism. It wasn't there, they literally dropped off my food after they toookmy order and dropped off my check the server came by once or twice, but when I told them something he was very dismissive, I was going to give them my card so they can charge me for the meal but I couldn't even do that because the server had rushed off, and I had to stand up for a couple minutes and try to get attention before he came back he charged me for the right amount and came back with my card and my receipt and just dropped it off without giving me enough time to tell him I was blind and did not know exactly where to sign on the receipt another girl finally  came by and helped me out to sign, but I almost had to beg her to help me out to the entrance the food was...... well...... not that good, the garlic bread was exactly what it sounded like garlic and bread, separately so that garlic was not made already on the bread. The bread was sliced up but the pieces were by no means separated, it was still in the shape of a loaf of bread, I am sure if I wanted to buy these same ingredients from the supermarket near me and make this dish I could do just the same as it was just cooked garlic and bread it was not that appealing at the other little star the garlic is nice and spread already with some very nice cheese on top so it's a sort of home-made kind of garlic cheese bread stick like thing except it's on something like slices of bread this is very delicious, what I had last night was not very delicious at all!!!! The pizza, at the other little star the crust is somewhat crisp but also somewhat softer at least not baked to a crisp I like cookies almost burnt to a crisp I like bacon almost burned to a crisp but pizza crust maybe not so much yes, the pizza crust was a little hard but most of all way to Krispy so it was almost like eating some sort of pizza on some sort of thick crackers also the toppings were kind of soggy and less good than at the other little star, you can tell they did not prepare it with as much care.and the slices are pretty dam small, where as at the other little star even if you order a small they just give you less slicers not miniature pieces I am not sure if the large pizza pieces are any bigger, but those slices at the other little star is easily one third bigger than the slices are here so, will I come back, sure maybe, but only if I really need food to last me a meal     But if I am craving for some little star pizza I'll goto the nopa location", "author": "Rachel N."}

THAT'S WHERE IT'S AT!!!!!  it's not necessarily a chewy crust if that's what you're in to, but it's got this great corn meal crispiness to it. i'm a big fan of pizza dough being rolled out in corn meal.  the toppings are varied and fresh etc, as is to be expected w/most really good pizza joints in the bay area so there's nothing really new there. i just wish that they had a little more to offer on the app/salad side of things and that they took credit cards (i want my miles!!!!!!).\n\nwe had the same server last night we had the first time we were there and she comes off as a little ditzy or something but i find her rather cute and amusing.  the servers and the hostess all seem to help each other with running food and settling tabs so service is not only friendly but usually pretty quick.  they've got an affordable wine list that matches pretty well with pizza.\n\nsometimes it's the simple pleasures like sharing a bottle of red and a yummy pie with the man you love that makes you think life is sooooo good.", "author": "Bird B."}

We walk in...bar is crowded. I spy one empty chair on the end. I grab it and immediately the bartender (Todd) gives me a menu. I ask him so questions. He gets me a Malbec. I asked him about the Rhone. He gives me a sample of Rhone. J gets the Italian wine. I hear Tod talking about the Zinfandel. I didn't know Dry Creek Valley winery was in Sonoma, I say...I love California Zin's... so Tod pours me a generous sample of the Zin. I listened Tod talk to the customers...he is very knowledgeable, mellow, affable and attentive. \nNote: he only works on Friday nights. Little Star Pizza is not a wine bar...I went to Nua the other week in North Beach...they claim to have a wine bar...however, Nua only had California whites, no reds and the bartender was not even half as informative as Todd. \n\nOur wait for a table was 30 min and I wanted something to eat while drinking wine...J suggested the garlic bread...I was thinking, I don't like garlic bread and I don't like sourdough...but J really likes garlic bread and sourdough so I held my tongue...the appetizer arrived. Oh my Goddess...the garlic clove was so creamy and light...the butter, mixed with olive oil, was soft enough for dipping. The sourdough...let's just say that it tasted perfect with the garlic and butter. \n\nOur server, Savannah, was AWESOME. She wore her hair in braids (very cute) and despite her name...has never visited Savannah, Georgia (I'm from the South and I love Savannah.) We were going to order a large salad but she declared that a small was enough for both of us. I looked her in the eye and said, \"We're hearty eaters.\" She responded, \"I stand by my declaration.\" I wondered if we should order thin crust or deep dish but J had his heart set on the tomato/sausage/onion/pepper deep dish...we got a large so we could have leftovers.  The salad came---very fresh--perfect size (Savannah was SO righ!). The pizza...the crust was cornmeal? The crust was delicious....tomatoes so fresh...sausage flavorful... we were very happy. \n\nSo, the food was wonderful, service incredible...it was time for the bathroom... I mentioned to Savannah how irritating it was to go to the bathroom and find it sans T.P. (see my other reviews)...so, Savannah (restaurant was packed)...goes to the unisex bathroom and then comes back and reports that there is plenty of T.P. J and I were both flabbergasted. What amazing service. \n\nFor dessert, there are two choices listed on the menu:\nCheesecake\nGelato\n\nThat's it...no fancy descriptions after the items. The food menu is one page. The drinks menu is one page. I like brevity and simplicity.  We thought long and hard about the gelato...but then decided we were too full and asked for the check. \n\nNote: the check took FIVE minutes to arrive. Again, we were pleasantly shocked. \n\nFor such good food and cool ambience...we didn't expect such gracious, attentive, friendly service. \n\nService gets FIVE stars. Food FIVE stars. Todd and Savannah...thank you for making our first experience so wonderful!\n\nP.S. J and I recently tried pizza at Pizziaolo (Oakland) and Cheeseboard (Berkeley) and Arinell (Mission, close to LSP)...however, it is difficult to compare as these places all have their unique flavors and crusts...I would say, though..for the best service, atmosphere, food in addition to pizza...Go to Little Star!", "author": "Grace C."}

I had heard that Little Star tended to get kinda crowded. But upon reading other yelpers reviews, I guess this Little Star location is less crowded than the one on Divis, and they were right! So refreshing to not have to search for parking and wait in line for 30 minutes. Also, we arrived at the tail end of their happy hour, $1 off wine and beer. So, keep the wine coming(i'm a closet lush).\n\nAfter looking over the simple, straight forward menu, we decided to  order the garlic bread as an appetizer. Warmed bread, a little bowl of butter and roasted garlic. Make your own garlic bread, yummy! We ordered wine: I had the cote du rhone, and my husband had the pinot grigio. Decent wine, decent prices.  And we decided to order, as our entree, the Little Star deep dish cornmeal crust pizza, which had feta, ricotta, spinach, mushrooms. My husband wanted to order a large. And I thought he was crazy. \"You're crazy!\" I said. I told him to trust me. He finally caved in and we ordered the small. Which, of course, I was once again vindicated, I was right. It was the perfect size for two people. I think we ate about 3 1/2 pieces each. Just to further prove my rightness, the table next to us, a table of 2 guys, with body mass indexes in the \"overweight\" to \"obese\" category, had ordered a large deep dish pizza. They couldn't even finish half the pie. \n\nOk, so the comparison, Little Star vs. Zachary's. I vote for Little Star. The crust is light and crispy, probably because of the cornmeal. The pizza itself tasted less greasier than Zachary's. I ate 3 pieces and didn't feel like I was going to burst. My husband, though, is an enjoyer of the grease, and thought that Little Star was good, but that Zachary's was better. \n\nOh, and I wanted to comment on the music. There's a juke box here, and the music they were playing was great...The Smiths, the Cure, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Pixies, Postal Service...\n\nOh and the wait staff...very attentive and prompt. Good service. (I think the prereq to work here is that you have to be a cute hipster with at least 3 tattoos and some kind of piercing somewhere....well, that's  probably the prereq to work at any place in the Mission...)\n\nTotal $57.00= app, entree, 4 glasses of wine and tip\n\nWe'll definitely be back.", "author": "Caroline C."}

Donna A. and I got there a bit early so we sat at the bar and took advantage of happy hour (to our surprise). Happy hour on a Sunday? Yes!! We sat at the bar with the friendly bar staff, and knocked back a few beers in frosty pint glasses while we waited for our friends to arrive. Once all 9 of us were there, the hostess sat us within about 15 minutes which was a pretty impressive feat, even with us being on the early side. We ordered two salads and 3 large pies (one thin pepperoni, one classic and one Little Star), which amazingly worked out to be just right; everyone left satisfied and happy. And to top it off...it worked out to be about $15 a person, including tip, which for a big group dinner out, is hard to beat.\n\nI could go on about how great the pizza was, but you've all already heard that.

Yes, this deafening enclave on the corner of 15th and Valencia is in full scale automated pizza production mode, each pie emerging from the kitchen looking more mouthwateringly delicious than the last. We decide to pass the time by drinking at the bar. A conversation is difficult to be had here, as the noise level would be on par with what the SF Chronicle deems \"explosion/ bomb level\". A good 45 minutes later we are finally seated at a large booth table, and as we had been pouring over the menu during our wait, we ordered immediately (thin crust white pizza with zucchini and tomato as well as the signature \"little star\" without mushrooms). First to arrive was the thin crust which was composed of a buttery crust topped with feta, mozzarella, garlic, and the aforementioned vegetables. This pizza was our appetizer, and we thoroughly enjoyed it in it's crispy, buttery, creamy, savory glory. A bit later to arrive was the famous deep dish, \"chicago style\" pie, a buttery shell sprinkled with corn meal and stuffed with chunky tomato sauce, ricotta, mozzarella, and spinach. I'll admit, this one is very similar to Zachary's but this is only a compliment as Zachary's is obviously a tried and true favorite of most anyone growing up in Berkeley. In fact, even the decor  ie brick walls reminds me of Zachary's (minus the kid's framed pizza paintings). In any event, Little Star does an excellent deep dish pizza and you can't go wrong with this rich  and cheesy heavenly pastry-like delicacy. Just be prepared for a long wait, although the lively ambiance and friendly staff make the wait all the more bearable.\nPS.

We arrived just after opening on a Saturday night at 5:15PM thinking we would be one of the first.  No.  How silly of us!  We were a bit dismayed that they did not have any beers on tap.  They made up for this however by pouring our wonderful IPA and Stout into frosted pint glasses all the way to the brim.  We never even saw the bottles.  I wonder if they open multiple beers to fill the 14 oz. pint glass all the way or how they manage to do that.  Perhaps they carry the 20 oz. Racer 5 IPA and do it that way.  Hummm...  This might require another visit seated at the bar to figure this out.  Also a warning.  If you are looking forward to those champaign cocktails, don't get your hopes up because this location has none of them.  They do have more beers and more wines though to make up for it.  That was fine by me.\n\nAnyway, we started with the garlic bread.  It is not like typical garlic bread.  It is more of a do-it-yourself kind.  You get a trough of butter, a full oven roasted clove of garlic, and warm sourdough bread to smear it all on.  YUM!\n\nThen we ordered our typical deep dish cheese with mushrooms.

I cannot emphasize enough how horrible the host and his attitude is.  The pizza is just not good enough to justify poor treatment of customers.", "author": "K A."}

I'd have to say the Mission location beats the Western Addition location for three reasons: First off, there's more space for tables, plus more of a bar/waiting area. And yes there is usually a wait. Secondly, they take credit cards along with cash (although please be aware they strangely do not allow more than two payment options). And finally, the parking situation is oh-so-much better than in the Western Addition. Despite the differences among locations, one thing is constant.

I make my living in the service industry and I don't care if you ARE in the best city in the country AND are in one of the best neighborhood in it, you HAVE to pay attention to your customers.  Without customer service your have nothing, however cute/stylish/young/hip they may or may not be...\n\nTonight, a couple of friends and I wanted some deep dish yummy pizza (to combat the rain) and we found it.  The pizza was fantastic; I will not take away from that.  Ingredients perfectly handled, salad divinely dressed.\n\nOur server was wonderful as well.  This issue was that it was a TUESDAY night, and, mind you, my 4-top waited 15+ minutes for a table, we had a buzzard of a host watching our every moment.  It was as if we had De Niro's table and were holding him up.  I was sitting on the banquette so I was aware that she watched everything we did.  Now, a good host does this without the guests being aware of it.  I've done it; you have to know your room.   This was more of a countdown to our departure.  Luckily, my fellow diners were preoccupied with the pizza so they did not notice.  As one in the industry, I wish I could have done the same.\n\nOur glasses were picked up off the table nanoseconds after they were placed empty.  Pacing happened behind our table in a frenzied fashion appropriate of a Saturday Valentine's night.  Not to mention the lack of eye contact and absence of friendliness.  Needless to say, after tipping generously, I wish I had not....\n\nbecause...\n\nit was bad enough that we were not given even a 'thank you smile' let alone a \"thanks for  coming\"...but one of my guests was glared at upon saying thank you.  \n\nAt this point, I was going to say something...\n\nSo, I stopped at the 'bar' to ask if I might leave a comment .  The woman behind the bar seemed more interested in looking me up and down for my sense-of-style (or whatever!)  than that I had felt rushed in my dining experience.  She said, \"yeah...I'll tell the manager\"...\n\nReally.  \n\nI live in the Mission and the attitude is not needed nor appreciated.

The pizza's are actually authentic Chicago-style, with the cornmeal crust and crushed tomatoes on top of the cheese. I can't go 5 stars as I feel a pizza place should not be quite as upscale-looking as Little Star and the pies could use just a touch more cheese.

The most common comparison I noticed when reading the reviews prior to going to this place was that with Zachary's pizza in the East Bay.  I'd say they're a bit different but definitely in the same league (I'd also recommend Zachary's to those who have never been).  The pizza crust might over do the corn meal thing a little, but (in my experience) only after your stomach is majorly stuffed and starts telling your taste buds to step it down a notch.  \n\nThe spicy chicken wings (not to be confused with buffalo wings) were also pretty damn good in terms of flavor and texture (though my company thought it to be a bit over spicy/seasoned).\n\nI'd recommend this place to anyone into pizza.", "author": "Anx R."}

So I presumed this trip would be another home run. Unfortunately, it was a case where great food could not overshadow the service.\n\nFood:  FOUR STARS- Garlic bread was once again a great hit. Great bulb of garlic to spread over the butter and warm bread . The Mediterranean chicken and vegetarian pies were really good. Loved the zucchini in the veggie pie, really stood out. They were able to sub the feta cheese with mozzarella for the mediterranean, which was nice.\n\nService: TWO STARS. This is where even the most immaculate pizza pie couldn't make up for it. We waited a very long time for our garlic bread to arrive, maybe close to 10 minutes, which just seemed like a lot for us. But we ordered a veggie and a non-veggie pizza for the 4 of us. The server specifically placed the pizzas on the table and noted which one was veggie and which one had chicken. Only problem: she mixed it up. So let's just say one wondered why chicken tasted light like zucchini and another was shocked that artichokes were really chicken.\nNo hives, breakouts, or \"refunding of the meal\" was required, but just a big no-no especially with hardcore vegetarians in the party.  We briefly mentioned it to the server and she seemed apologetic. The mgr actually stopped by and gave us a discount on the meal and apologized as well. They explained the lighting sometimes causes confusion. Well...then fix the lighting! \nIt was cool that the mgr stopped by and rectified it, but it was one of those \"too little too late\" moments that would make Donald Trump say, \"You're Fired.\"\n\nAtmosphere:  THREE STARS. Very packed on a friday nite. Duh, but then again it was packed on a Saturday nite in Divisadero and it there was at least more breathing room or places to sit down. Wait time was around an hour & 15 for a table. On the plus, the restrooms were very clean, but the dining tables were really scrunched together and there were very little room for conversation. The Divisadero spot was much more open and actually made the most of its tables to make it more personal. Parking-wise, go to 16th or 17th for street parking. \n\nSo overall, it averaged out to 3 stars. I was going to give it 2 stars, but since the mgr did apologize, it gets a third star. And that was very cool of her to do that, I can't stress that enuff. Would I come back here? Here, maybe only for takeout, but for now I'm probably gonna stick with the Divisadero location.", "author": "Neil N."}

As for the pizza, it was delicious and filling. The corn meal crust was unique and took a slice to get used to but my kids found it addictive. There was ample cheese in the middle, topped by a tangy red sauce with big chunks of tomato.

Then came the head-to-head comparison of the deep dish Mediterranean pizza.  LS's has an airy corn meal crust that I like more than Zachary's, but the flavor/mix of ingredients didn't have the same pop as Zachary's version.  Zachary's wins hands down on the thin crust both in flavor, crust texture, and visual appeal.  Do they have dessert at LS?  Can't tell you, since our waitress threw our check in the middle of the table before we finished our pizza, so I guess not?!\n\nOverall, if you are in the City and can't make it to Berkeley for Zachary's then Little Star is an adequate substitute.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-15", "description": "I hate dropping the name of \"the competition\" in a review for a place, but in this instance, it'll be a compliment to compare Little Star to Zachary's in Berkeley.  \n\nThe landmark pizza joint in Berkeley is \"the\" undisputed hero of tomato-pie eaters flung the world over.  My favorite cousin comes from London every year just to recall his first PhD in the OB department at UC Berkeley by gorging himself on an entire \"deep dish\" - yes, the whole thing, all by himself.  Seriously, don't get too close when the feeding frenzy is on, you could lose an arm, or at least your favorite pinky-toe. \n\nI am pleased to say that I have a destination a little closer to my own home, and to my own fond life-education within the Mission. I had heard about Little Star from friends, and always took their advice with a grain of salt, after all - I had been to Zachary's, so there was no looking back.  Now, having been invited to a birthday gathering for a certain tomato-hater I know, I too have discovered a close second to the benchmark. By second I mean 99.5% or the original.  And by tomato-hater, I mean a hot blond schoolteacher I find myself enamored of lately. When a pie is so good that a person who claims to hate tomato's gobbles down 20 slices in 7 minutes, its saying something about the quality of the food, and the ability to pleasantly and gastronomically disguise an otherwise disdained vegetable or fruit. I speak of course of Mediterranean Deep Dish, which was a crowd favorite, and the reason for my own tears of joy on this particular Saturday night.\n\nI will remember Saturday the 14th of April, 2007 for a number of reasons.  Not the least of which involves a charming educator who turned 32 on that day.  But also because of the satisfaction I found in broadening my pizza horizons, filling my fat belly, and ultimately delighting in the knowledge that I have a special treat to share with family and friends whenever they feel the need to feed. I also have a place for my own special events that doesn't involve any form of despised public transport.

The appetizer we had was the garlic bread, which was an inexpensive and a deliciously innovative twist on what we were expecting. A small loaf of slightly toasted ciabatta style bread, warm creamy butter and a whole head of roasted spreadable garlic (Similar taste to the \"bathtub of garlic\" from The Stinking Rose). 5 bucks and so damn tasty! After we were seated, needless to say the 12 of us were starving and decided to order immediatly. 4 pizza's, 3 breads, 2 chicken wings and a few bottles of wine.

I had just moved into the area and stopped by Little Star for dinner with the same foodie friends who had coaxed my curiousity; I would say, it's definitely a California spin (given the kitschy Mission decor, and California wine list plus the pies themselves... you'll just have to see) on what I remember Chicago deep dish being, but it is oh-so-good that way. The sauce is so tasty, fresh, and generous in portion. There is not an excessive amount of dough, and its nice and crisp... kinda like a tougher pastry dough. So good, be assured that all crusts will be eaten!\nThe ingredients? Fresh, yum, and oh I want a piece right now! We ordered the Classic and the Little Star, and while I love both I think I my heart truly belongs with the Little Star. A vegetarian type pizza, this is sure to please both carnivores and veggie-only kin alike! The cheese selection, the mounds of spinach... so good, really I'm starting to salivate as I write.\nWe split the pies among 7 people,  most of us having moderate sized appetites, and it was about $10 a person including tax and tip (tip is included for parties over 6). Drinks were separate, and about $4 to $7 a person without tax or tip, and I would recommend the usual beer or wine, but maybe stay away from the Champagne cocktails, which are interesting but I don't think really go with the meal.\nBe warned, I did wait a good half hour, but that was time well spent sipping drinks we'd ordered at the bar and catching up with friends. :) I'll definitely be back!", "author": "Jessica L."}

My favorite is the \"Little Star\" which has spinach, mushrooms, and ricotta cheese - their pizza sauce is absolutely the BEST I've ever had - not too salty, kind of chunky, and very fresh!   We also shared a house salad, which is plenty for two people.  Get here early, though - we arrived about 5:30 on a Friday evening, and were seated right away.  When we left an hour later, the lobby/bar area was filled with people waiting.  Go early, or get the pizza to go!", "author": "Debbie B."}

Ah, Little Star. I'm glad I met you. It was fate that brought me to you. Let me count how many ways I love you. \n\nYou're always there for me when I need you. Well except when you're closed on Mondays. All is forgiven though, when I order my deep dish Little Star Pizza. It is seriously a slice of heaven. It contains so many ingredients that I don't like, but they're blended together so perfectly that it works. The spinach, ricotta, tomato, mushroom, and onion..so yummy. The cornmeal crust is the SHIZNIT. If ever, I want to stray to another place, I always remind myself it will not compare to you. It also tastes so great the next day cold, which I can not say about many pizza places at all. I have tried pretty much everything on the menu, my faves are the deep dish Little Star (duh!) sacrelige to order anything else. My thin crust fave is the White Pie with salami (as introduced to by the WC). I love the blue star wheat beer and did I mention the buffalo wings and the blue cheese dressing. Make sure to order extra blue cheese, it is divine! \n\nAdded bonus, their jukebox is amazing. It basically has every album I have ever loved circa 1999-2003. I love walking in and hearing all my fave tunes and then sharing a meal with the WC. It is the best. Their acoustics in here are terrible though, may want to rethink the brick walls as it just bounces sound across the room. The long wait can be a pain, but it's well worth it. I wish they delivered, but that would probably take away from the experience of what is Little Star.", "author": "Kristy H."}

Sausage, chicken and basil.  I have a ritual: I buy a bottle of red wine from Bi-Rite, stop in Little Star on the way home and put in an order, go home and drink a glass, pick up the pizza, eat 4 slices and refrigerate the other 2.  By the time the bottle is gone I am ready to re-heat the remaining 2 slices in the oven.  The trick is scooping the tomatoes onto a plate before you pop the slices in the oven.  The last step in the ritual is telling myself that the 6 block round trip to Bi-Rite negates the rest of it.  I realize this is false but that is the beauty of faith.", "author": "Kasey K."}

Except for the cash only part - that I could do without, because sometimes me and my people are trying to consume mass quantities of deep-dish goodness!  The one thing we were really sad about leaving in the East Bay was Zachary's - but once Little Star hit my radar, there was no turning back.  We're talking crispy, doughy, melty, juicy-chunky-tomatoey, spicey-sausagey, stringey-cheesy, little bit of garlic punch, all around delicious.  Once you have some Little Star in your mouth, you start getting this crazy idea that maybe your stomach is bottomless.

Being from the east coast and having lived in Chicago for 7 years, I can tell you this place is definitely worth going to.  Chicago has great deep dish, but you can only eat a slice of it.  The deep dish here is not overwhelming and the crust, well its to die for.  Its a mix of butter and cornmeal which makes it out of this world.  If you love carbs as much as me, you wont be disappointed.  As for the wings, they are nothing like you would expect.  I loved them, but if you are going in there hoping for traditional hot wings these aren't them.  They are just salt and pepper and some ovo I think, they were very tasty in my book.  The blue cheese added zero to them, but all in all this place was great.  Waiting an hour isn't the most fun, but they definitely do not hide the fact that you will indeed wait an hour.", "author": "Jaime C."}

Ironically, I have never been able to get away from the thick crust here, because it's so freaking orgasmically good. Which makes me really have to say it's not really pizza to me. It's more like a pizza-like casserole pie. It's all the things I love about lasagna, but it's pizza. It's the best Chicago-style and better than Zachary's (which I never imagined).

We waited 30 minutes or so for a table - Tuesday night around 7ish.  Ordered the Caprese salad - good, but not anything great - and did a deep dish half Greek and half classic.  The crust was delicious - not oily or overly flaky.  My dissatisfaction came from the ratio of sauce to pizza.  The sauce was so thick you could not tell which half of the pizza was which and it really overwhelmed the toppings.  My husband even asked if there was feta on the Greek as he could not taste it through the sauce.  I know he does not have a great palate, but really, if you can't taste a strong cheese like feta because of the sauce, you might have a little too much sauce.  Overall the pizza was ok.

It's my personal goal to introduce the glory of Little Star to as many people as I can; whenever friends visit from out of town, this is the first place I take them to eat, and it never ceases to amaze. The Little Star pie is my fave: packed with ricotta, onions, mozzarella, garlic, spinach and mushrooms, topped with the most delicious tomato sauce ever.  Really. The best. Ever.\n\nThough I've been to both locations, the Valencia spot is more cozy and closer to where I live, so I mostly go there. It also recently started accepting reservations and taking cards (Divis location does not, as far as I know). Parking is always awful, so I recommend walking/public-transiting it if you can.\n\nDefinitely make a reservation for weekend nights, or any night really if you don't want to wait (and you will) and before 5 pm (they don't accept reservations same-night after that).

So yes, the pizza here is good. But the service is crappy. As in it is staffed by a bunch of dumber-than-dirt fashion victim hipsters who are unskilled at managing customer flow in their restaurant. So, instead of being aware of the problems caused by their management or in the least bit apologetic for their mistakes, they give you defensive attitude. Also, I was totally not in love with the bartender who was so concerned about getting her tips that she hounded people eating and drinking at the bar while waiting for their table to settle with her instead of in their seat. Believe me, I understand that bartenders get the short end when it comes to this, and I always make sure I pay and tip at the bar before being seated, but I don't appreciate being pointedly asked to do as much. I watched her do it with everyone who sat down at the bar --even going so far as to strongly suggest that people order their pizzas and eat at the bar instead of getting a table-- and I thought it was in really poor taste. I doubt I'll go back because fuck dumb mission hipsters holding you responsible for their stupidity. I suggest eating there only if you can't get to the better-run and less hipster infested Divisidero location.", "author": "L W."}

It's likely among the best in the city. The menu isn't huge - which could be good - could be bad. I was a bit disappointed they didn't have a Caesar Salad. I ALWAYS have a Caesar with my deep-dish! We got the Caprese Salad instead. Seeing as how I don't like chunky tomato's - I can't speak for the entire dish. But the Mozzarella and Basil? Awesome. The prices were fair, and the \"cash only\" policy could definitely be an inconvenience (and is surprising for a place like this - the atmosphere was a step above casual, but could easily go either way).

And I was disappointed enough to weep copious tears. There were bits and parts of the pizza's that worked individually, but did not come together as whole.While the sauce was passable on one pizza, the layering was better in another, or the crust was close to how it should be on a third. Little star was closest to being passable. And then I had a eureka moment about deep dish pizza  in SF. It wasn't the pizza, it was me. While I don't compare it back to Uno's/Gino's east/Lou Malnati's and think of the pizza here as a version of Chicago's deep dish healthier/lighter(if that's even possible in the world of pizza) cousin, I actually really liked it - the lighter cheese, the cornmeal crust and the freshness of the whole pizza.

No. Not even close. I'm stunned by the number of reviews on this site that even compare the two. The only resemblance was the way the pizza looks. It looks like Zacharys, but that's as far as it goes. So as for the debate about which place is better - it's not worthy of a debate. If you want Zachary's caliber pizza and you live in San Francisco like myself, you'll just have to trek over the bridge and head into Zachary's. Little Star Pizza is no comparison. \nNow - aside from the fact that it doesn't compare to Zachary's, it's just not that great. I hate when I consume HUGE amounts of calories without the reward of tasting and eating some Bomb A** food! Yuck. Who wants to feel like a cow after sub-par pizza? Not me. I should've made the trek to Zachary's and consumed the calories for a reason. \nWe ordered the Little Star Pizza (their specialty). Way too busy and the crust was gross. The crust was nearly dripping with butter but not in the good Unos Pizza crust kind of way but just in a doing way too much kind of way. The Garlic bread was essentially a loaf of bread and a roasted clove of garlic on the side...for $5 or $6. The one thing that was really good was the salad...although we ordered takeout and the restaurant forgot to add my dressing to my bag...so i ended up eating it with some salad dressing I had at home..annoying - especially after sub-par pizza. \nAll I can say folks is that if you want good regular pizza in the city, try Goat Hill (and make sure you try their ranch dressing! sooooo delic!)...and if you want really good deep dish pizza, make a trip to the East Bay and go to Zachs!

I've been on the quest for the best pizza in all of S.F. for sometime now and everyone kept saying go to Little Star. So its my b-day and my family was in town and we dicide to head to Little Star. When it was determined to head to the Star I was so excited, but after the experience I wished we had went to a better pizza place. Now I knew going in that it was Chicago style and this was my reason for going, I love Chi-town style pizza. But the pizza just lacked the robust taste everyone said it would have. I expected to be in pizza nirvana. Now Little Star isn't all bad, the service was great and my waitress never kept me waiting. I would never go back there unless I was close by and wanted Chicago style pizza. If you want good Chi-town pizza in the city head over to Patxi's in Hayes Valley, you won't be disappointed. Now if you really want the best Chicago style in the Bay Area, there is only one place to go and thats Zachary's in Oakland or Berkeley (Its an EB chain).", "author": "Paul C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-12", "description": "We went here on a Friday nite at 8PM. The hostess told us it would be a 30 min wait. The place is small and cozy and the waiting area is a bit small. After an hour, we finally got our table. So, here's the review. The pros: we ordered a classic and some other pizza, a salad, and garlic bread. The deep dished pizzas were pretty good (gormet compared to all the other deep dish pizzas I've experienced), the salad was just right, and the garlic is different. I am not a fan of their garlic bread (the garlic is roasted and serve separately with the sourdough bread). Overall, the food is decent and the price was reasonable. Now the cons: I don't appreciate being mislead by more than 30 minutes of waiting to get a meal. Let's be real, these people have been doing this for awhile and they have a pretty decent idea how long a wait is and I feel most of the time, they drasitcally underestimate the wait on purpose. Second, the place is not well managed. They need more staff. The hostess doubles as a busboy, clearing and setting tables while the waiting staff is busy running around taking orders, but not really paying any attention to their guests. To be fair, the staff is friendly and try their best, but they need to run this place better and more efficiently. I would come back again.", "author": "nik t."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-29", "description": "This place rocks!  I'm not usually a big fan of deep dish pizza because the crust is usually so doughy and thick but Little Star serves a deep dish pizza with a thin, cornmeal crust that's really tasty (I especially like the spinach, garlic, ricotta pizza with added anchovies).  They also have a good tomato, mozarella salad.   I don't know if they take reservations but if they do, I'd definitely call ahead.  We went on a thursday at 8:30pm and it was an hour wait for 2 people - luckily, there's a really cool bar nearby called Fly Bar that you can hang out at while you wait.

Tonight, my husband and I went quite early in order to beat the crowds and eat lots of carbs and fat. We arrived at about 6:20, sat down, looked and the menu, and then realized that happy hour would be over in 2 minutes or so. At which point my husband went up to the bar, tried to order a drink, and was told by a super unfriendly bartender that in fact it was 6:31 and so he could no longer order drinks at happy hour prices. WTF? So, on principle, we didn't order drinks and we thought this was really lame. This same bartender was totally bitchy later on when we tried to leave the check and our cash with her-- she pretty much refused to take it.  So, I don't know that we will be going back here due to this experience. There are plenty of other friendlier places to get pizza in the mission....", "author": "Michele F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-03-05", "description": "Maybe my 3 stars aren't fair because I'm truly a thin crust girl. Either way, this place is overrated.\nFirst of all, my pizza got soggy really fast. I don't know if that's necessarily their fault. I thought the cornmeal is meant to prevent that, but it definitely does not make good leftovers. Some parts of my pizza had just way too much sauce. The sausage that they use is really good, though. Overall, the pizza was good and I would eat there again if someone was taking me there and paying.\nI can't believe they don't take card. To me, that is seriously unacceptable. It's a pizza place, an expensive one! Non-acceptance of cards is only (almost) okay for places that sell small things, like candy stores, coffee shops, places that will lose a somewhat substantial amount to card fees. It's not okay for Little Star Pizza to not take cards, where the average tab must be at least $20-25.\nOkay, so that's a general rant against places that don't take plastic, but the pizza is also pretty expensive and probably just not worth it.", "author": "R D."}

They've been replaced with too-light glass ones that stick to the bottom of frosty pint glasses and embarrass uncool folks like me in front of the all the hipsters when they drop off my drink into my pizza plate - clash!!.

HOWEVER, the last time I was there, we had the worst service I have ever had...  Our waitress was extremely unhelpful while we were trying to decide on a pizza and how much to order.  She also tried rushing us along with the bill at the end before we were even done eating!  She placed the bill on our table while we all still had food on our plates and when she came back and saw that it was empty threw it back on the table.  I told her we would pay when we were finished Eating!  It was a Saturday, so it was busy, but not as busy as a typical Saturday.  She also told us that once we ordered one deep dish we couldnt order another...yet we saw other tables sit down long after we did who were still ordering deep dish.  I'm not sure what her problem was, but this will prevent me from going to this Little Star ever again!  The hostess was great as was the bartender.  And of course the pizza was delish, but she tainted all of our experiences...

The guy who tended to us was very down to earth in his style and conversation, and I liked that. For some reason, it was very appealing to be served by a real guy's guy. As for the pizza, the two of us handily split a small deep dish vegetarian pizza, which was more than enough for the both of us. What really impressed me was the Caprese salad. I tried a Caprese at another restaurant (in North Beach, no less!) but it was runny and didn't compare to here. I haven't been to the other Little Star, but I like the ambience at this one. Dim and intimate, good for a date but also as an outing with a friend or a handful of friends. I was thrown by the cash only payment, and although there was an ATM on premises, I don't like paying the extra fees for non-bank transactions, and I found it odd that such an evidently-established restaurant like this couldn't honor even my debit card. Otherwise, you should definitely give Little Star at Valencia a shot.", "author": "Joseph R."}

Whether this locale's cooks who are not yet versed in the particulars of \"little star pizza making\" the crust is still as buttery good as its parent but the sauce can vary from day to day.   The chicken wings are great at both spots and the beer and wine lists are relatively above average for a pizza shop.  I tend to only order the deep dish pizza as the thin sliced just doesn't do it for me like Pizzetta 211, Pizzeria Delfina or Pizzaiolo.
