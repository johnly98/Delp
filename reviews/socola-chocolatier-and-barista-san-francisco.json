If you're feeling bold and adventurous, try the sriracha and durian. \n\nOnly con. Remember how I told you they're located near a busy street? Well, parking is a bitch to find.

It's a cute spot on a rather remote block of Folsom with very little pedestrian traffic. That's a bit of a shame since the chocolates are good even if they are somewhat premium-priced. Part of the challenge is that the chocolates, as tasty as some of them are, lack distinction, something unique that would make them memorable. As the trio of strippers sang to Louise in \"Gypsy\", you gottta have a gimmick if you wanna get applause.\n\nThe sisters proclaim they make \"artisanal confections with modern flavors and a fantastic taste of fun\".OK but was I having fun? When do we get to the fun part? I came here with Jamie W. and noticed they're trying to be more than just a chocolate shop. They also serve espressos and pastries in an attempt to expand their budding market. We sat a spell at an open table mightily sharing a small selection of their chocolates - Passion Fruit Vanilla Bean, Burnt Baby Burnt (Burnt Caramel) with Sea Salt, Vietnamese Espresso and Bacon (photo: http://bit.ly/1rLzLcH).\n\nThe price was high at $9.95 for a quartet, but that makes it comparable to what you would pay at Recchiuti Chocolates in the Ferry Building. Keep in mind I'm the type that gets excited at the prospect of a free chocolate square at Ghirardelli's. Socola's were tasty confections for sure, but I still think the quality at Recchiuti is better, richer, more velvety. More practice perhaps. To top it all off, I even had a $4.50 cup of the Truffogato, a Four Barrel espresso topped off with a chocolate truffle (photo: http://bit.ly/1pVyqk6).

Needed to make sure I did my due diligence and update my previous review (below) since the world is a happier place when delicious chocolates are part of our daily diet!  I can't wait to eat my way through the entire menu - you can't go wrong with whatever you try.\n\n\nPREVIOUS REVIEW:\n\nCan truffles be sexy??  How about mouthwatering and delectably delicious?  Being a huge chocolate fan - I am very picky when it comes to my chocolate.  There's only so much chocolate a girl can consume before it hits the waistline...(Note to self - try not to overindulge)...\n\nAnyways,  I'm surprised I've never yelp about the Lieu sisters!  Wendy and Susan are geniuses!  Wendy, the chocolatier herself, and Susan - the savvy business entrepreneur has come up with some amazing concoctions! Ingredients I just couldn't see tasting all that great together  became instant favorites!  Vietnamese coffee, bacon, guiness...who knew they'd be so delicious with chocolate!  Each truffle packs amazing flavors that isn't overpowered by the chocolate - it's like the perfect tango!\n\nI've been devouring their chocolates for years.  Not only do they get more sophisticated as time passes, but more creative and if possible - more enticing. I realize now that I am very deserving of the finer things in life - truffles included!  \n\nThey take orders year round and if lucky, you may be able to find them in a few select stores.  Currently, I know for a fact their truffles are showcased at Bi-rite Market...def check it out - esp if you're waiting in line at Bi-Rite Creamery...mmmmm..craving a balsamic strawberry now!\n\nOoh FYI:   \nS\u00f4c\u00f4la - best chocolate of the east bay 2009 - diablomag.com/Diablo-Mag...", "author": "Julie H."}

She LOVES durian. I am not a fan at all. I heard they only make it once in awhile and I emailed Socola to let me know when they do have the durian to please let me know. The owner, Wendy (super friendly) emailed me back in 5 minutes saying she had one box left and will save it for me. I told her I want it shipped and she replied back quickly with a link to purchase. Shipping is $5. She said it might take a few days to arrive. It arrived the next day and she put a little ice pack with it also. \n\nThe service was wonderful. Wendy answers your emails so quickly and is very helpful and friendly. The truffles can last in the fridge up to 3 weeks. A little pricey, but they are one of a kind. \n\nI surprised my sister with it and she said it was very good. She doesn't even like sweets, but she loved it.

(Did I miss anything?)\n\nHere they use Four Barrels coffee, which is widely regarded as a good roaster.  That said, it's not a guarantee that your coffee or espresso will be good.  I've been to at least 2 other places (not to be named) that serve Four Barrels coffee and it comes out mediocre at best.\n\nSocola is not like that. Their barista -- I believe his name is Josh? -- knows what he's doing.  He consistently pulls some of the best espresso shots I've ever had.  He knows what to look for in terms of timing, volume and crema and he knows how to get it with the proper grind and tamp.\n\nI believe they make all of their coffee with a large french press instead of a drip mechanism, so if you like french press coffee, this is your place.  And I can tell they've brewed it at the proper temperature.  No bitterness, deep complex flavor.\n\nOh yeah and they have delicious chocolates there too, but honestly I'm not there for that.  The coffee is where it's at for sure.  It's a bit on the pricey side, but totally worth it if Josh is there.

I guess sriracha and guava are their most famous chocolates, and I choose earl grey and jasmine just because I like tea.\n\nSriracha: Well.... too spicy for me. The flavor is so strong and you can barely ignore it . I would like it more if it is not that spicy.\n\nGuava: Wow this is amazing, after the first bite I realized that there is a guava fruit jelly inside the chocolate, which is so creative and blew me away. \n\nEarl grey: Don't know if there is any problem with my tongue bud... when I taste it, I can barely taste any earl grey in this chocolate... which really disappointed me..\n\nJasmine tea: Unlike earl grey, this is just what I want! You can taste the light jasmine inside the chocolate. \n\nI would definitely come back again for their chocolates.

I came for the chocolate and I think I know a thing or two about chocolate, being originally from very close to the Swiss border. For credibility: I also frequently visit the other Artisan chocolate places in SF and am not afraid to pay $10 for a 80g bar of regular chocolate and $3 for a piece of truffles, however here the chocolate is wanna-be overpriced for what I can taste in it.\nI did an assorted dozen, just like last time, foregoing the ubiquitous flavors like fresh mint. The truffles are largely disappointing. The ganache is O.K but not distinct, and doesn't develop much flavor when melting in your mouth. Some of flavors just distract from good chocolate like the Lychee Pate de Fruit. To be honest the only outstanding and differentiated flavor I found in the Dangerous Durian. It doesn't really cater to my taste ( tastes like old potatoes ) but at least it was a different and differentiated flavor.\n\nI think I did my duty trying them twice and will go back to the established other Artisan shops.", "author": "Stephen S."}

Usually I think that chocolate \"kills\" the flavor of coffee, but they pair a nice robust four barrel coffee with rich but not cloying chocolate ganache, which really marries the coffee and chocolate notes very well.  As the coup de grace, they float a house made rich chocolate marshmallow on top.  The marshmallow adds just a note of sweetness as you sip the latte, and there's usually enough left at the end to serve as the perfect little treat.  \n\nThe chocolates that they make are extremely well executed.  These are not rustic hand rolled truffles, but sophisticated well crafted and extremely presentable little gems that your significant other would simply *love* to receive in a little box to celebrate that next special occasion.\n\nThey leave some samples on the counter, and I must confess to liberally taking advantage of their generosity, and can tell you that they are very good at pairing chocolate with some unusual flavors, but by far my favorite has been their vietnamese coffee flavor, which was suprisingly not too sweet and really allowed the coffee and chicory flavor to shine.", "author": "steffan z."}
