All of these fun friendly people have drinks and they're not sharing.  But the first and foremost observation is the noise.  You can reach out and touch this wall of noise buzzing in your face like moths who just found a ninety-watt light bulb.  The dissonance is a huge red punch to the ear drums and it suffocates the senses, if only temporarily.\n \nThe bar is lit by a golden yellow light and, underneath its lambency, the SFGG Rugby Club is huddled together, sploshing beer about and howling for one another's approval.  A bright neon light shines from the window, lighting up the smokers outside on the sidewalk.  They look like bead-covered blobs through the rain-spotted windows.  The television's on up above, but no one is watching.  There's a juke box in here, but I can't hear it.  The beatific faces rush by laughing and yelling like they just discovered a new galaxy.  Someone brushes by me in the rush of things.  I try to look over at the person.  I overcompensate and find myself looking up at the fan.  I then attempt to look back and the person is just another blur laughing with a bigger louder blur.  The chatter grows as voices compete with other voices in order to be heard over the other louder voices.  The bartenders keep the tables clear of glasses, condensation, crumbs, spills ... and they keep the cups of merriment full to the brim.  \n \nI see a girl sitting on a barstool from across the bar.  From my point of view, she looks bewildered.. confused.. uncertain.  I wade across the room full of noise and reach her, tapping her shoulder in an affable manner.  She turns around and looks at me with a peculiar glance.  I totally forget what I was going to say to her.  I am entangled in the surrounding buzz.  My thoughts drift about in the commotion.  She is saying something up at me in a humorous tone that I can't decipher.  I laugh and nod as I float away against the current of patrons bellying up to the bar.  There are so many conversations, so many drink options, so many people possibilities - I am overwhelmed in an instant.

(No, we are not models or actors...my friend's brother was the director so he graciously let us be in it.)\nAnyhoo, Jeff didn't feel like hanging out in the cold for the whole thing, so he headed down Chestnut to the nearest bar: La Rocca's.\nWhen we got there, there were maybe six people in the bar, not including my bf or the bartender, all of whom were dudes who clearly were not used to interacting with women on any level.\nWhen we ordered beers, the bartender thought we were all on the same tab, but we weren't so he proceeded to tell us the bill was \"all fucked up\".\nWhen he figured out who owed what, my friend asked if there were any drink specials since her beer was a little expensive. The bartender replied with, \"Five bucks is expensive? Where the fuck are you from? If you want cheaper beers, you should probably just fucking drink at home.\" \nNot that five bucks is terribly expensive, but there are many, MANY (way cooler) bars in the city, with cheaper drink prices. His hostile response was a little shocking and totally douchey. \nWe all agreed no tip was in order and when he picked up our credit card slip said, \"Wow. Thanks.\" Sorry, fucktard, but you act like a dick to customers, you're gonna get treated like one. \nI know this is a total tourist trap of a bar, so we really had no business being in there, but Jesus, if I was a tourist and got that kind of abuse, it would leave a shitty taste in my mouth about SF for sure. It left one in mine. The only way I would ever step foot in this dump again is to purposely not tip this asshole.\nToo bad, because according to my bf, about ten minutes before we got there a really cool older bartender was working who hooked him up with shots.

Lots of people are counting on me to represent San Francisco and not let anyone down. I know I cannot, under any circumstances, be the first one to puke in a gutter and pass out in a drunken stupor on the seemingly huge bar crawl that will be taking place next week. \n\nSo, lately when I leave a party to \"go home\" my coaches really push me to have just one more drink, or two, before I give up! Such was the case this last Thursday when on the way home from a beer filled evening at Kennedys there was the \"Irish Coffee\" sign staring out at us from La Roccas. This was an opportunity not just to drink but to mix those alcohols, thus strengthening my digestive system further. \n\nI have been into this little corner bar many times. It is actually a great place to train. The shape is this weird corner building with an island in the middle, thus making it hard to navigate while sober, especially when it gets a little crowded with the mix of locals and tourists it attracts, so to navigate it drunk is quite a challenge indeed. This helps with the agility I will be needing. \n\nThey have a nice selection of alcoholic beverages, and the bartenders do a decent job of pouring drinks that are not weak and do not charge what you would expect for the area. This place isn't quite a dive, not exactly a neighborhood bar, not a tourist spot and definitely isn't your typical North Beach night spot either. It is just an older, smaller worn in place to get your drink on and maybe catch some sports on one of their strategically placed TVs. \n\nIf only they would stop using canned whipped cream in their Irish Coffee, I would train here more often and award them more stars.", "author": "Drue C."}

When my old SF friends come back to the city we often start or end the evening at LaRocca's.  \n\nExcept when Bimbo's and Cobb's have star headliners parking in this part of North Beach isn't too bad especially if you are willing to climb a few blocks to retrieve your car. But why drink and drive when the 30 Stockton is right outside or you can grab a cab before the competition really gets tough in the middle of NB?  The place can get busy when there are big  North Beach events, the local nightclubs have a big name performer, or there is a big sporting events.\n\nGreat jukebox, wide selection of beers, usually an interesting mix of people, and I like every one of the bartenders.  Tourists comprise a very small percentage of patrons and don't spend nearly the amount of time that the locals do.  This is a great place for a drinking session with your buddies.  \n\nThough LaRocca's isn't for every one, particularly people who don't understand proper bar ettiquette and abuse the word douche.  One Yelp review that cites the bartender kept dropping the F bomb is something I've never seen anything close to but  certainly isn't outside the parameters of possibilities.  In that case the Yelper states that three entered, ordered three drinks gave the bartender a card and then told him they wanted to pay individually.  I'm not sure what is weaker: Not telling the bartender that the first card was for one drink, or being too damned cheap to buy your friends a drink? \n\nFor the literate folks out there the place during most hours is more like \"The Tender Bar\" and less like \"Cheers\". Those times LaRocca's is hosting a reunion party, showing ballgames for  the Wisconsin Badgers SF alumni, or other local televised sporting events the place loses some of its dark charm.   The odd shape of the place creates a great flow that makes the place feel comfortable.\n\nBest Recent Moment at Larocca's: Giants are two outs away from winning the World Series when a 30 Stockton pulls into the bus stop.

Sports/Rugby bar, well priced drinks, great jukebox, but it tends to get VERY crowded and VERY loud. Lots of fun memorabila on the walls, the bartenders are nice and heavy handed with the liquor so go on, get drunk and enjoy.", "author": "Catherine K."}

There used to be a guy named \"Pooh Bear\" who was this sweet yet ornery semi-homeless guy who weighed about 300 pounds but was the \"sweetest bear around\"... I used to send him postcards from my travels around the world care of La Rocca's, and the bartenders there would give them to Pooh and he'd cry because someone thought of him. He died recently, but his legend lives on (ask any of the bar staff for stories). I guess it used to be an old Mafia hang-out, but now it's a hang-out for soccer hooligans. A quick walk from Fisherman's Wharf, the more commercial part of North Beach, and right by Bimbo's, La Rocca's is a little out of place, but that's the way it likes it.", "author": "Christy M."}

We now go at least twice a week and consistently end our nights with a shot poured by our favorite local bartenders. Comfortable atmosphere, interesting people and cheap drinks... great North Beach establishment.", "author": "Corrie M."}

He was a regular, and everyone there always told me he was \"A man's Man\". My dad's name is Bob Kelly, and though he passed 15 years ago, he is still remembered.  In fact they have a picture of him on the wall,  I expected when I visited 2 years ago that it would have been removed by now, But that is LaRocca's, a friend for life. \nThe LaRocca's themselves are no longer there, and though my Dad is Irish, I remember him telling me that no matter what kind of threat I faced, or trouble I may ever get in,  he had \"friends \" who could \"help me out\". In fact,the LaRocca's had a family band, which played at my wedding reception.  Guess you could say they were kind of my extended family.\nMy kids and I moved to Arizona, but even they take special pleasure, any time they are in the Bay Area, to stop by LaRocca's, where their Grandad is still remembered.\nIf any of you longtime patrons remember him, Bob Kelly, it would please me greatly to hear from you! I am his second daughter, Patricia, and email is trishep104@gmail.com\nLRocca's Rocks!", "author": "Trish S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-10-16", "description": "It's never my idea, but I have spent many a night at this bar.  This is a bar I used to go to when I was underage.  Now that I'm legal to drink, it's not my first choice, but it's at least decent.  The set up can be a little awkward and there's always a huge line for the bathroom, but if you can get a seat at the bar or in the window, you're golden.  The bartenders are cool and the drinks are stiff.  I come here when I go to Bimbos, for a daytime drinking marathon, or when friends drag me there.  Ask the bartender for dice and play midnight at the bar.", "author": "angela k."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-12", "description": "This is a fun bar to go to if there is a big event in the area (ie. Cobbs or Bimbo's). If you go on a dead night it can be quite depressing. I have been coming to this bar for a long time and love it. The bartenders are cool and the owner is out of control (in a good way). It attracts a good local crowd. Even though they say that it is where the \"Tourists meet the locals\" I never see any tourists, just lots of locals. I cannot go into this bar without seeing someone that I went to high school with. They have another catch phrase there - \"Drink with Dignity\". I prefer to lose my dignity, and this is a perfect place to do it.", "author": "Paul H."}
