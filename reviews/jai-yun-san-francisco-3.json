They do not offer any menus, it's all chefs daily creations.\n\nThe four of us dined here on CYN, I believe we selected the special tasting menu for that evening. I also read that the chef does his vegetables and meats shopping every morning to insure the best quality and freshness to create very unique dishes for that evening.\n\nThe dishes are beautifully presented, they were indeed very unique  and fresh.  The favors were fantastic! They only had 3 bottles of wine that still had price tags on them. We ordered all the wine they had.\n\nWe did have a wonderful unique experience and laughter throughout the night, as we tried to interpret what they were saying about about ea dish.  Definitely challenged my mandarin.\n\nThe price tag was $800 for the four of us.. great experience!  Definitely should try once just for the experience.   No hot and sour, no Kung Pao, no beef and broccoli... just wonderful flavors of freshness!", "author": "Michelle A."}

There are white tablecloths and orchids on the table.  How can this be you may ask?  Well, it is now a pop up restaurant inside of a rather utilitarian restaurant on Broadway.  The space is protected by shoji screens, and feels lovely, and will last until the chef finds a new restaurant space. \n\nI suggest that one goes now for delicious freshly prepared Chinese cuisine, for one never knows whether he will get a new place!", "author": "maria B."}

No. I mean strange like I threw down $80/person at a place decorated to the brim with knick knacks (plastic grapes and doll houses and lacquer treasure chests). Like we called ahead on a Thursday afternoon and they opened just for us, a group of 4. Like the food is high-end but there's a bowl of mini Milky Ways at the counter when you leave.\n\nI am not well-versed in this manner of Chinese cuisine, so it was all new to me. A couple highlights: Abalone and scrambled egg whites, candied eggplant, tofu skins, beef tongue, crispy mushrooms. In all, we had more than 15 small dishes, each a small treat.

I have traveled to China quite a bit for work and vacation and am very familiar with Chinese food from street carts to the upscale private rooms. I was visiting San Francisco for work and was excited to take some friends and family out for something not typically found in America- upscale Chinese food. So I made dinner reservations for our party of 6 at 630 on a Saturday night. \n\nThe first indication that should have sent me packing was the fact that we were the only ones in the restaurant other than a single server and the chef (on a Saturday evening!) and it remained that way for the rest of the night. By the end of the night I completely understood why. \n\nThe staff at Jai Yun do not speak any english which was fine since I speak Chinese. What was not fine was the server's complete ignorance of everything in the restaurant from literally not being able to describe any of the many dishes served to the 7-11-esque underwhelming wine/beer selection. When we asked for a bottle of wine, we were directed to a soda fridge where we grabbed our bottle that was chilled well below the appropriate serving temp. The menu was chef's choice with three price points 68, 88, and 98 dollars(per person) where everyone has to pick the same option. We went with the 98 dollar menu [mistakingly] thinking the food is where things have to start getting better.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the variety of food served if the quality had been even slightly better than a mid level Chinese take out restaurant it might have made up for the atmosphere, undertrained staff, and most importantly justified the 100 per person price. To finish off they less than impressive meal, our server returned the bill to a guest who was not the one who paid asking for a bigger tip while leaving a basket of halloween candies as \"dessert\" (this was August). So much potential, such poor execution.", "author": "Jon R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-22", "description": "Jai Yun is a treasure but also something of a victim of cultural divides and expectations people have for restaurants in San Francisco vs what people expect in fine dining in Hong Kong or certainly in mainland China. To the Chinese, formal dining is something to be celebrated and holds a very fond place in most people's hearts. However, restaurants--even the very best traditional-style ones--are not high on trendy modern furnishing nor the sort of graceful finery you'd find, say, at Paris' Taillevent. Often as not, the grand old banquet restaurants in China are a bit worn around the edges with what appear to have been an effort towards poshness . . . but circa 1983. Jai Yun is cut from the same cloth: the emphasis is purely on the food though I expect were you to ask the chef he'd think the atmosphere and furnishings are just fine. For many Americans though, if you're paying $100 for dinner you probably expect a setting that doesn't look like every other run-down Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Jai Yun, alas, just isn't in agreement with you on that.\n\nSo, if you're seeking a more \"American\" fine dining experience with on-point service and lush surroundings, seek that elsewhere. This is a Chinese banquet restaurant in one of the largest Chinatowns in North America serving traditional yet innovate Chinese food--take it as it is or go somewhere else, but don't complain to the tone of \"well, gosh, it sure wasn't much food for all that money and it wasn't how celebrity chef __________ did things at his Vegas restaurant Darlene and I went to a month ago!\". Because this restaurant isn't that restaurant. \n\nThe emphasis here is on Shanghai cuisine (Hu cuisine) which isn't nearly as easy to find in SF as Cantonese or other regional Chinese cuisines. There are, in the prix fixe dinner, a number of cold dishes and then hot ones. A lotus root salad, smoked fish, and various pickled vegetable dishes are stand-outs though everything is of the utmost quality. Anything done here with Chinese Five-Spice is also stellar and really shows what Five-Spice is supposed to taste like and how it's ideally used in cooking various meats. Likewise, the chef knows his way around applying ginger as a primary yet not overpowering seasoning. The Shanghainese-style Crystal Shrimp is probably my favorite but as the chef is custom preparing every dish himself and using ingredients he purchased the same day in many cases, the offerings can easily vary night by night. The chef, since he does so much of the work himself, is really coming as close as possible (or maybe even closer) to the goals of Nordic chefs like the brilliant Magnus Nilsson where the focus is on superb food crafted with attention to the nuanced flavors involved for each individual guest. It's a lofty undertaking but it comes together here--if you pay attention to the food and not the atmosphere or uneven service--amazingly.", "author": "Mike W."}

When we made the reservation we asked for the least expensive meal for 4.  We were told it cost $65/person.  We also were told it's BYOB.  There is no $65/person for a party of 4; the lowest price is $80/person.  The corkage fee is $20/person.

Service was outstanding. Food was spectacular and truly authentic Chinese. My friend who lived in China for 3 years approved of this place! For appetizers, I enjoyed the tofu that tasted like duck, cilantro tofu, beef tongue, and pickled radishes. Next, the abalone with egg whites were very tasty! I am very picky about seafood and was hesitant to try it but glad I did! The fishiness of the abalone was balanced by the egg whites. The abalone was cooked to perfection, maintaining its delicacy and tenderness. All of the tofu dishes were outstanding! The fried spicy mushrooms were delicious! I emtied that dish instantly. The edamame with tofu was very good, however the clear noodles were a bit too spicy for me. The fried beef was my favorite as well as the fish with vegetables.\n\nAll the pictures are uploaded so check them out!  We also had a bottle of Sanctuary Pinot Noir which was oustanding with the meal. From the outside, this restaurant may look like any other Chinese restaurant, but this restaurant is a real gem. I highly recommend coming with a group so the price is more affordable. We paid $100 per person, +$65 wine, so our bill was around $300 with tip. If you come with a group, it'll be about $65 per person. This is a bit expensive for me but I'd love to return and bring my friends to try it.

This placed #10 which is quite an accomplishment since his reviews include places all over the US and Asia. The chef of Jai Yun is from Nanjing, which used to be the capitol of Southern China and his cooking is very typical of the region's cuisine.\n\nTips:\n\n1. Get a reservation. The waitress will tell you that they seat by reservation only, although they do seem to accommodate walk-ins on slow nights.\n\n2. Come hungry! We ordered the lowest price set for 2 people ($98/person) and received appetizers + 12 dishes. I was done at dish 6!\n\n3. You'll be there for 2-3 hours - the chef subscribes to Slow Food.\n\n4. No take out. It's a shame that my mom and I weren't able to finish everything. They don't allow take out or have any take out boxes.\n\nYes, it's pricey, especially since most of it was vegetarian. After reading everyone's reviews, it seems that the chef cooks the same dishes each time. Disappointed! I was led to believe that he prepared meals based on what's seasonally available and his creative whims. If that were true, I'd certainly feel that the price was justified! It was $213 before tip.\n\nYes, you can probably find better value elsewhere. There were some dishes that were my-mom-makes-this-at-home and others that were very creative like the abalone with egg white or the sweet/spicy fried mushrooms (so juicy). Other standouts include the sweet spare ribs with fried taro balls and the loofa squash & gingko nut.", "author": "Mimi X."}

Novel...evidence of the master behind the kitchen. $$$. Reservations must be made! Accepts credit cards.\n\nI follow and echo Vicky L's sentiments about allowing my frugal self to disappear, in full deference to this review. Sitting at my gorgeous Crate and Barrel dining room table, looking out at the wondrous work of the marina sun on my garden outside. Listening to Sarah Brightman's magic and taking a break from the heaviness (but beauty) of Andrew Pham's writing (aim to devour everything he's written...)....\n\n4.5 stars only because of the prices charged (he's a one man show, literally), and the decor upgrade/revamping would transform the meal altogether and make the experience complete.\n\nProperly and finally motivated (this occurred when Brightman hit the high G with piercing authority!) to review one of the best Chinese dinners I have had in a long while.. at least, here in the States. Chef Nei, I admire so much. He, a genius who is trapped and limited by his own need for control over every infinitesimal detail of his cuisine, at last unable to unlock the mental chest of recipes of many regions of China that he is able to master. I grew to like him immensely, chatted for a while after dinner, and was very thankful for his larger-than-life talent. And, in the end, I left the restaurant feeling sorry for his loneliness...I feel it when I look into his eyes. \n\nHe decided to keep the restaurant open for us... our lone reservation, which, in the end, turned out to allow a few (1, to be exact) other obviously eager patrons. Yes, how we did it, I do not know. Shall never, but thankful to the chinese culinary gods that he decided to open to cook for my parents and myself. We came to sample his 'middle of Middle Kingdom\" cooking wonder. I longed for those flavors that I have only read about in many books. I wanted to close my eyes and appreciate the tenderest, sweetest of combinations. \n\nFor $300, all 3 of us did say steep in price. Dishes are not large, but there are several. One comes with pre-set price points, with the lowest tasting menu at $80/pp. Size of dining party affects price charged. Please keep in mind that you are paying solely for trying his culinary skills and genius in dish composition! It's not about anything else but that here!\n\nWhen picking apart how many ingredients are loaded into each small dish, and considering how many dishes came our way, it was a meal of a lifetime, and an experience difficult to capture in the English language. \n\nStarters were a medley of dishes...  pork skins, ham, mushrooms, picked radishes, kong cai, among others.. delicate and palate-opening, we thought that 80% of the medley was wonderful. Just a few fell flat in flavor and pop.\n\nAnd then the ball started rolling, and slowly, out came all of the dishes:\n\n1. Abalone fillet with egg whites and mayo combo\nEXCELLENT\n2. Gluten \"meen gun\" with asparagus, sauteed with radishes and mushrooms\n3. Crystal shrimp... so 'seen'/fresh, the shrimp were singing. Taste was extraordinary.\n4. Dancing mushrooms\n5. Edamame with gogi berries and tofu skin. Unique, full of flavor for veg dish EXCELLENT\n6. Spareribs and taro. Perhaps one of the standouts for me.EXCELLENT\nAte that one slowly\n7. Xigua with gingko nuts. oh my---the smoothness of the fresh squash prepared\n with some sort of starch and coupled with freshness and unique taste of gingko-- fab.\n8. Crispy beef prepared with scallions and plum sauce EXCELLENT\n9. Golden fish... the filets were so fragile and perfectly cooked.. gorgeous flavor and texture\n10.Glass noodles with 'lap yuk': a pork belly-type of layered pork. HOT but the kick was yum!!\n11. 3 veggie combination including leeks. I just cannot recall the rest. \n12. Bursting Fire dish\n13. DESSERT: AND YOU THOUGHT YOU LIKE DEEP-FRIED BANANAS....try his house special of deep-fried eggplant!! with all seeds scraped, the heady, melty, silken texture of the eggplant came through in the most delicate of batters... something one would imagine picking up in SE Asia. An other-worldy type of tempura batter (must have used ice).\n\nI'm warning the reader that it's not the ambiance that makes this place so great. Rather, it's the repertoire that he knows. The knife skills are evident in the dishes. I couldn't resist commenting, and he seemed to sincerely invite me back into his kitchen to observe. He commented a bit about his life, and for a flicker of a moment, I felt the burning loneliness that must be his life.. full of passion for his food, and held back for his language and cultural differences, unable to fully flourish with all this potential.  I felt very very fortunate that evening; he didn't mind spending some time chatting after our meal, although I was ever-sensitive of the party that came in after us.", "author": "Jana C."}

I can go back and forth between 2 stars and 4 stars so will just settle on 3 stars.  The main problem is the price. You're looking at spending $100/person roughly (maybe as low as $65 if you go in a big group) based on their menu pricing so I wouldn't bother trying this place if you can't risk it.\n\nThat said, the cooking and creativity is fantastic. I've rarely seen such ingenuity shown in Chinese cooking so I was really excited to try this place. You also get a lot of courses -- I counted something close to 20 courses even when I chose the cheapest menu option. You get to try everything from abalone to wheat gluten cooked in ways you probably never tried before.\n\nI think this is an incredible place to take friends who have never experienced great Chinese food or creative non-Americanized Chinese food. It would give a great survey of the potential as well as the best there is.\n\nI'd be tempted to come back here again and try a more expensive menu but with more people so it's cheaper per person. I wouldn't be surprised if it ended up being a 5 star experience.\n\nI would say though that the decor is quite lacking for such an expensive restaurant. If you like Mission Chinese Food though and have enough money to live in a nicer neighborhood than the Mission, you may really like this place.

My favorite items were the in the gluten/tofu direction which is surprising because I usually shy away from this category, but the chef really knows how to make them sing. The smoked fish and ginger cabbage app were also very good. \n\nThe cabbage was the only thing I would call remotely hot/spicy, and I'd asked for spicy, so I would say this is a place for milder tastes and savoring the ingredients and presentation, not flavor drama. \n\nThe hostess immediately asks if you have a reservation which I did. But she didn't check it and a party of five came in with no reservation and was seated with no problem. \n\nActually, the place was pretty empty.

They are open for vegetarian lunch, but dinners are served with reservation only.  Mr. Ninh is the one-man chef for this restaurant.  His passion for pursuing the perfection of Chinese cooking has continuous offer delicious foods over 20 years in San Francisco.   Mr. Ninh's philosophy is that the ingredients has to be purchased daily and be used up at the end of the day.   Therefore, the restaurant will server ONLY by reservation.  I have not had lunch there yet, so I am sharing my experience only for dinner.  In order for him to serve the food at the highest standards, he not only shops fresh daily, but also personally makes all dried ingredients and sources as much as possible.   You make the reservation saying how much you are willing to spend per person ($65-$168), and you will be surprised with whatever the chef created based on what's fresh for the day.   When we visited, it's on a weekday night, so the restaurant was not as busy as in weekends, the chef came out and explained to us about this restaurant.  Every dishes he created, he also created a Chinese poem for it.\n\nOur reservation was $98 per person, and we were served with 25 dishes!  Every dish was as fresh as you could get and delicious.  The dishes are not the usual items you would see in most of Chinese restaurants.  The dishes here are more of home cooking style, and the taste, texture, freshness, color is at their highest quality you can get.  On each of the dish, you can observe his passion in the perfect cooking of Chinese food.  For example, every piece of the food is cut the same shape & size, his skill on temperature control on stir fry resulted in crispy texture of vegetables, his knife skill is supreme that the lotus root was cut to paper thin.  Mr. Ni times his cooking carefully based on when the food will be served.  When he marinated pickle dishes, he plans the start time to ensure the maximum quality of the crispiness & flavor.    The dinners usually don't serve rice (but they will provide if you ask for it) because you will be served with so many dishes that just 1-2 bites of each dishes will fill you up.  This is really a treat for the art of Chinese food. \n\nThe only caution is that if you don't like spicy foods, make sure you let the chef know when you make the reservation.  Among 25 dishes we had, there were ~ 5 dishes that were too spicy for a couple of us.  Also, the waitress can handle limited English, so if you have a Mandarin speaking person in your party it will be helpful with the communication.  If not, it's not a problem, as you just sit down and wait to be surprised with the authentic, healthy, and fresh Chinese home cooking.\n\nIf you are looking for foods like Chinese banquet that come with Pei-King roast duck, Lobster, Walnut Shrimp...etc.  This is not the place for you.  If you are looking for a unique memorable enjoyment for the art of Chinese cooking, this will be a nice place to enjoy.", "author": "Angela W."}

The utter lack of a menu was a particular draw, and Chef Nei does right by his customers. \n\nMy friend and I came at prime dining hours on a Saturday night, and for our entire stay there was only one other table of two.  People came in off of the street, expecting to have a quick bite at an unassuming Chinese restaurant, but were graciously turned away, being told that they needed 'appointments.'  I felt like I was at an exclusive fete with a backstage pass.  \n\nAfter sipping tea, a stream of banchan-like cold dishes flowed from the kitchen.  The sole waitress arranged them beautifully in a nice pattern.  They were all delicious, the pickled items perfectly textured.  Definitely mouth-watering was the abalone and egg foo yung, lotus salad, crispy eggplant, and basically everything (and I wish I knew what everything was!)

If you have any food allergies, you have to make them known, but just to be safe, I'd avoid eating here since there might be residual nut residue in the wok. \n\nIf you are the type of diner that craves the complete experience (service, ambience, food), you'll most likely be dissapointed with the ambience (plastic plants, fortune cat, strange lighting etc...), but will find the service very friendly and attentive, and the food to be interesting and the ingredients fresh (the preparation style might be regional, but the dishes are of the chef's own creation and not likely to be found elsewhere). It will definitely be one of the most unique Chinese dining experiences you will have in North America.\n\nIf you are the type of diner that just wants good quality Chinese food at a reasonable price, Jai Yun will likely leave you dissapointed. You will inevitably feel ripped off based solely on the quantity/price ratio. Light eaters will find the amount of food just right, but I'm an average sized male and I found myself having to supplement the meals with subsequent snacking. If you're willing to drop $100 on Chinese food, go across the street to R&G or head over to Hong Kong Lounge in the Inner Richmond where you'll get a lot more bang for your buck.\n\nJai Yun is just one of those places where there's no middle ground. It's a lot like Tommy Toy's in that after your meal, you might feel the strong urge to either A.) hug the chef, or B.) knee him in the groin. You'll either love it or hate it. But if you have $100 (per person) to spend and feel like trying something unique, roll the dice and take the gamble. But if you're in a less adventurous mood and want food that hits the spot, avoid this place and go with the sure bets I mentioned above.\n\nP.S.

I've been a few times and have always left feeling very full. It's hard for me to understand why some people complain that the food isn't filling or is overpriced. \nIf you go to a Western restaurant and got anything over 10 courses for $100 i think most people would think that was an absolute bargain. It's sad that folks are OK paying 3x the price for upscale Western restaurants but don't see the value in good Chinese food. I think there's a psychological block that people have when it comes to Asian food.\nAlso, why do so many Americans feel like they need to eat like they are stuffed in order for it to b a good meal? I feel like portions are generally too large at many places here anyway. \nNow, that said - it is true - this place is lacking in atmosphere and service. The chef unfortunately does not have the savvy to hire the right marketing and service staff to complement his business.  They would do so much better if they even just played some nice background music. And it helps if you have a Mandarin speaker in your group.\nAnyway, I'm from Singapore so I have no problem eating delicious food in substandard surroundings. \nIf you are looking for a romantic night out and attentive service to impress someone, Jai Yun probably isn't the place. But if you just want some really good, AUTHENTIC Chinese food (not the greasy coarse, watered down dishes in most Chinese restaurants here VS good food you can get in Singapore or Hong Kong) this is a great place to go.  And you can choose the $68 option which I still thought was a lot of food.", "author": "Sushi K."}

Is this the French Laundry of Chinese restaurants. Being that I've never been to the French Laundry, I'm not qualified to make that comparson.\n\nWe've heard about this restaurant for several years. Reservations required, small plates, lots of flavors, no menu, cash only, pick a price point and take your chances. \n\nOur feeling is that anytime you try out a new restaurant, you're taking a chance. You can reduce your chances of failure by researching what others are saying but at the end of the day, your experience is uniquely yours.\n\nWe found a coupon on restaurants.com a couple of weeks ago for $50 off of a $100 meal. Last Sunday, we were in SF for a play and made reservations for dinner for 2 at 6:30pm, using opentable.com. \n\nVictor left a message on my cell phone on Sunday to confirm the reservation, which we did after the play was over. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by our server and the chef. They confirmed that we had reservations and we were seated and given water and hot tea. We were presented with \"menus\" that offered dinners for $80, $100 and $150 each person. We decided to go middle of the road with the $100 each.\n\nI asked the server how many other guests they were expecting and we were told that we were the only ones that night. The combination of cold, rainy weather and Thanksgiving week had put a damper on business.  She also apologized that the food might be a tad slow in coming out because there was a photo shoot going on in the kitchen.\n\nWe met the photographer and had a nice chat. She was taking photos for a website on unique chefs that is in the start-up stage. Being that I spent 10 years as a photojournalist, it made for an interesting experience watching her work. She also took a photo of my dining companion and myself with the chef and the 12, yes 12, appetizers that he had prepared for us.\n\nSome were familiar flavors while others were new to our palates. Most were quite yummy and it was certainly pleasurable to pick at them while conversing. Three of the appetizers were meat based and the rest were veggie based. Some dishes were subtle in flavor while others were in your face. \n\nAfter we finished, the plates were cleared and the first of our TWELVE entrees started to arrive. One at a time. The meal was set up in such a way that we never had two entrees on our table at the same time, yet we never felt rushed. \n\nAs others have stated, no rice was served nor was it offered. If a dish was spicy, our eating plate was exchanged so as to not mix flavors with the next dish. Just like the appetizers, we found familiar flavors and new ones. Some ingredients were used on both appetizer and entree but usually mixed with something else and definitely with a different flavor profile. \n\nI'm not listing our dishes simply because I know that I can't adequately describe them. Since there's no menu, there was nothing that I could copy from. I could list the ingredients that we recognized but that wouldn't tell you enough about how the flavors were. A couple of dishes were a tad too sweet for our taste but certainly not inedible. A few dishes blew us away just because they were so yummy!\n\nWe felt that as a special occasion restaurant, we would do this again and hope for an equally successful menu. For an everyday place, this is a bit out of our budget but maybe not yours?\n\nPositive unique factors were the new dishes that we had; quality of service; cleanliness of the restroom (spotless); the volume of food.\n\nNegative unique factors: the server and the chef do not speak English. The chef only speaks Mandarin. I speak some Cantonese and that's how we communicated with the server. The photographer also helped with some translation. I think that some of the negative experiences that others have written about could have been corrected immediately with adequate communication skills.", "author": "Dexter D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-19", "description": "Disclaimer: Cheap Chine$e Girl disappeared for this review.  She'll be back later.\n\nFor those of you who don't know the difference between Chinese food from different provinces and regions (it's okay, I didn't figure it out until I was in high school, because I'd just eat everything in front of me without questioning), the stuff you eat in Chinatown like dim sum and chow mein is considered \"southern\" Chinese food.  The food from northern China is usually lighter and healthier, which means less grease and MSG.\n\nJai Yun, a place Sara P. had bookmarked for awhile, is northern Chinese fare.  We walked in for lunch and they gave us a small sheet that explained why they don't have menus, along with price points that you can pick ($18, $25 or $35 per person).  Since we didn't know how much food we would be getting, we decided to go with the $18 meal.\n\nSo, yes you read that correctly: there is no menu.  They also don't do take-out or delivery or to-go for \"environmental\" reasons.  How do you order?  Well, once you tell the waiter what price you're paying, he brings out the food, specially prepared by the chef.  The waiter also asked us how spicy we liked our food, and not knowing their scales, we said medium-spicy.\n\nOur first course was a quartet of pickled vegetables: chopped Chinese broccoli, cucumber, lotus root, and red radishes.  They were all very fresh, crunchy, and lightly marinated in the sweet and sour juice (which is like a vinegar water, because it's not a thick heavy sauce).  All of them were delicious.\n\nOur second course was a cooked shrimp with chickpeas.  Like the vegetables, there really was no sauce that accompanied the shrimp.  It was just lightly sauteed in a little bit of oil, and lightly seasoned with salt and pepper.  The waiter also brought out a bowl of white rice for each of us.\n\nNext, we got edamame beans and tofu skins.  Both were also lightly seasoned and sauteed.  If you're wondering what tofu skins taste like, it's like eating a really, really thin crepe that has a little more texture.  This was also really good, because it was light and went well with the rice and shrimp.\n\nAfter that, the waiter brought out a plate of chopped white fish, corn, bell peppers and daikon (I think), and like the previous dishes, these were tossed together and cooked the same way.  This was my favorite, as it had the most texture and flavor (especially the sweetness of the corn).\n\nOur last dish was a plate of pork belly and wide glass noodles, cooked with really, really spicy red peppers.  This was probably my least favorite, as the peppers and the seeds almost too unbearable for me to eat on a warm day with my hot tea (if it'd been a cold night, I would've inhaled this).  If you're into spicy foods, you'd probably really like this.\n\nOverall it was a fantastic meal.  Neither of us felt stuffed or gross from eating typical greasy Chinatown food.  My advice to you if you're expecting chow mein and pork buns is to get rid of that and enjoy the food from a neutral standpoint, because it's different than the stuff you're probably used to.  It was fun to not know what you're getting.\n\nSomewhat pricey but in Jai Yun's case, it's the quality, not the quantity, that counts.  I recommend this place for a bigger party, as you'll probably be able to try more dishes.\n\nP.S.  Sorry I only took one picture.  I was too hungry to remember the pictures for all the other dishes.", "author": "Tori S."}

With the cheap paper placemats, cliche paper dragon and fake flowers all over the place it screams COME HERE TO EAT GENERIC CHINESE FOOD! Yet they charge $125 per person for a prix fixe menu. Color me confused. I felt like I was in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThe tiny dishes served were cooked well, but it will NEVER amount to the outrageous prices they charge. Apparently there is one chef who is doing all the work and I understand it is a lot of labor to chop/cook everything by yourself, but it is moronic of him to not hire a sous chef. He's definitely going out of business soon. We were the only table there that night and his restaurant is pretty big. There is no way he makes enough for rent. \n\nAfter all the dishes were served, we were given our check on a standard plastic tray with a few mini chocolate bars.

If it was $80 for the table vs $80 per person, perhaps I wouldn't have such a low star rating up there.  But at $240 for the three of us, it was a HUGE rip-off.  Even with our $100 Restaurant.com coupon, dropping the final tab down to $140, we felt quite gypped.\n\nAbout 80% of the 20+ courses we received were vegetables.  Even our friend, who is a pescetarian and was initially afraid there wouldn't be enough items for her to eat, commented after dish 15: \"Uh, where's the meat?\"  As mentioned by just about everyone, the dishes are very, very small.  No rice or starches to fill you up = very hungry diners despite a very loooooooong meal.  Did I mention that we waited a full HOUR after seating before we got our first courses?  We were seriously one of three tables.  There were maybe ten people total all night.  And it still took a full hour to get nibble #1.  If it weren't for the fact that I expected culinary nirvana after all the praise here and on Chowhound, I would've high tailed it out of there.\n\nI'm all for down-home hole-in-the-wall ambiance, but when I'm paying triple the price for Chinese food, I expect a tiny bit of effort in making the place seem a little nicer.  Place looked like your run of the mill Chinatown establishment, right down to the son/host/waiter taking your $240 order in a sweatshirt and dirty sneakers.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, but in the end it was an incredibly unfulfilling experience.  The food was nothing spectacular, nothing unique if you've been to non-mainstream Chinese restaurants, and as others pointed out, not even entirely made of only the freshest ingredients.  The wait was excruciatingly long for very little food, and the final bill was the hardest to swallow, even with a hefty coupon. \n\nPerhaps in the past it was a gem, but as-is, I certainly would not recommend it.", "author": "Christina F."}

We had been here on previous occasions and always enjoyed our meals. This time we felt like they rushed us through all the courses. \n\nIn a cheap Chinese restaurant I expect the food to be served fast. Here, where food is their only selling point (you do not come here for the vibe) and they charge $100+ per person, you want to be able to enjoy each course, one at a time.\n\nSo we got the appetizers and the first two courses within 5 minutes of ordering. Then when she served the third course along with the next table (who arrived before us) we realized the lazy chef was trying to avoid cooking the same dish twice. I told the waitress to slow it down and so she did, by holding the already-cooked fourth course in the kitchen. She served it to us lukewarm. \n\nI complained again and not three minutes later she comes out with the fifth course, saying it was already made so we should have it while it's hot. FINALLY, the chef slowed it down by making the next table wait until we were ready, so that he could still cook for both tables at the same time. Our mood was ruined.\n\nFor a restaurant that only has 3 tables on a good night (and wants $200+ for two people) you'd think that the chef (also the owner) wouldn't mind pacing out the courses. Many if not all of his dishes can be wok-tossed in under two minutes, with pre-prepped ingredients.

We were super excited about coming here.\n\nWe were a party of 5 last night.\n\nWhen my wife made the reservation (for her own birthday dinner I might add) she specifically called out my allergies to lobster and scallops. I am Chinese American so I understand the challenge or eliminating these components in a haute Chinese dinner. Nonetheless, I do have a serious allergy and I carry around a couple Benadryl and an EpiPen because in certain circumstances, either of these components can cause me problems even as an accent to a dish.\n\nOur party of 5 arrives for our 7pm table - and spend a few moments to review the menu. The very kind Maitre'D who is also the primary server explains the prix fixe menu options which include three price levels up to +$80/person. He explains menu ingredients are more special with each increasing price level, 3 altogether, and the number of dishes increases with each level\n\nTo complicate things a bit we explain that three of our party wants to catch the last ferry to Marin to get home which leaves at 9:30pm. This is a problem with our parochial little town but that's another story. We are thinking of the highest prix fixe level but at this point our server doesn't regroup and say, well, perhaps it would be best to go with a lower price level for a few number of courses. He did say he would say the chef would try his best but I sensed he wasn't in control here. We decided on the highest prix fixe level because we were excited about the food AND reminded the server of my severe allergies to lobster and scallops.\n\nThe first course of individually plated cold plates was very tasty and beautiful. The gai lan dish in particular was striking but again all the other 10+ dishes were just lovely. I want to clarify that individually plated dishes meant all dishes were served in discrete family style portions or small plate style but each of us needed to serve ourselves. This is expected as it allows the best timing for presenting the food when it is ready. This is very nicely done.\n\nDish after dish of lovely small plates came out to us with variety, beautiful color, balanced and just delicious.\n\nWe did notice that during the arc of the 8-9 courses that we would have appreciated more frequent swapping out our individual eating dishes. During one small sequence, at least two spicy dishes were served followed by a beautifully prepared fresh vegetable dish. At this level of food, we would have expected a fresh eating dish between the spicy and fresher vegetable dish. We're not sure if this is a logistics problem or a lack of understanding. At $80 each, this is similar to one of Quince's prix fixe meals and the level of service is MUCH higher. As a person of Chinese descent, I'm frankly really bummed out about this because I want this level of Chinese food to succeed. But this is a minor disappointment compared to what comes next.\n\nI think it was course 7 - a lovely dish that incorporated rehydrated scallops!  My lovely wife and in-laws called this out right away and alas they were right. This is no joke and while I regularly indulge in gallows humor this was outright wrong. To give a sense of how torn I was, I tried to explain away to my family that perhaps the chef didn't 'get' the distinction between rehydrated scallops and fresh scallops but I am frankly misguided here. The server was apologetic but the chef should have really come out and apologized. Again, at this level, some expression of real concern should have been made. The chef did present another dish, gratis, but in the face of a major health calamity, this didn't seem like the best possible gesture. We aren't cheapskates - we just needed proper acknowledgement of the issue.\n\nWhen we closed out the bill, the server did bring a coupon for $20 off our next visit but come on! Frankly, the entree should have been removed from our bill and/or the chef should have come out to try to express his regret. Even if language was a potential issue we think we're astute enough to recognize genuine regret through facial expressions and body language.\n\nI am really bummed about this. This is precisely the kind of haute Chinese food the world needs. Jai Yun emphasizes fresh from the market cooking with balance and delicate preparation, while honoring the family banquet style of dining. I want to love this place but disappointed about the lack of care to the overall dining experience.\n\nDaFlora in North Beach and Le Pamphlet in Paris have similar proprietor run gestalt - we always feel the strong hand of the owner/chef but somehow we are left leaving Jai Yun with a sense that the chef's arrogance spoils the experience and ignores the patron by and large.\n\nI may try Jai Yun again but my wife and the rest of my guests have definitely stated they would never come here again.", "author": "Christopher L."}

Once I read about the unique nature of the prix fixe menu and all the surprises that awaited, I was really intrigued. There must have been a typo in the book as, it claimed (upon its second printing in 2010) that the prices were 15, 25, and 35 I think. Once I called to make the reservation, I found out it was actually 80, 100, and 120 for dinner. Yikes! Still not phased by the absurdity of all this, I pressed on and decided to go there for dinner with a friend our first night in San Francisco.\n\nI've eaten some amazing meals in Taiwan and China, and was expecting great things based on the expensive price point of the menu.

This was my experience at their original location on Pacific Avenue, next to the now defunct Mobil gas station near Powell Street.  My sister suggested celebrating my father's birthday here, after reading about many accolades to the chef.  On a weekend evening, our party of eight looked forward to a typical Chinese banquet.\nWhen the food starting coming, we noticed that the portions seemed relatively skimpy, unlike most Chinatown restaurants where NOT boxing food is unheard of.  The family members shared a consensus that the food was different, innovative, and a nice change from the norm.  Yes, there was abalone, lobster, crab meat, and other delicacies.  There were small dishes and more than ten courses.  Everyone was satisfied with the quality and amount of food, since it was just enough without any leftovers.\nHowever, the smiles and compliments quickly became :0 when the bill arrived.  This is when we discovered that my sister ordered the $100.00 per person meal.  Gee... no wonder there were no menus given.  The next kicker was that she forgot to ask about their payment policy which is \"CASH ONLY\"!  With a feeling of both shock and panic, we scrambled to our wallets and purses to check whether we had enough money. I worried that the running joke of washing dishes to clear the bill would be realized tonight.  Luckily, we were able to search every nook and cranny of our pockets to cover the bill with a generous gratuity to boot.  The waitress later told us that we could leave a name, address, and telephone number and come back later in the week to pay the owed balance (if you'd told us in the first place, our blood pressures would not have suffered the unnecessary spike).

We gave the wonderful server, a preschool teacher by day, a $100 tip (that's her pay so treat her well).  The service was impeccable and she watched over and knew exactly when to remove plates and bring the next course.  The meal lasted a good three hours.\n\nTo those who complain about the price, tell me where you can get a dinner with 12 appetizers, 13 courses, totaling 25 dishes for $60 person?  Can you do that at Quince, Kokkari, Boulevard or any other comparable restaurant is San Francisco?  Stop complaining about the price.  You know what you are going to pay before you go to Jai Yun.  So, don't go and then complain afterwards. You can negotiate a price and the above price can be met.  So, if you cannot afford at least $60 per person, go to Dennys or Applebees.\n\nAs for the small plate complainers,  we are in a small plate age in many restaurants,  Have you been to State Bird Provisions where the plates are small?  At Jai Yun, you will get 25 different plates of food and after 3+ hours, we left quite full.  If you obese folks want a large plate overflowing with food where all the foods mix together, go to some cheap buffet where you can get heap food on a large plate that you can over fill over and over again.\n\nJai Yun is rated one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in America.,  It is a place that\nevery food lover hopes to stumble across, but to find Jai Yun a Chinatown in this country is a special surprise.\n\nNei Chia Ji is from Nanjing, China, and is a passionate cook.  He doesn't speak English well, but he will come out and greet you and is very polite and personable, more so than the grippers who complain  about price and small plates.\n\nNei makes no concessions to people who think Chinese food is cheap, starch laden sweet sour pork and fried rice.  Rather, each of his plates is stamped with pure flavors, classic approach, and impeccable technique.  \n\nMr. Nei runs a fascinating restaurant.  You can only dine by reservation and there is no menu.  Go with a group of people, 10 is ideal and negotiate a price, starting at $50 per person, and you will have a dinner you will talk about for a long time.", "author": "Donald W."}

The chef decides for you based on available fresh ingredients, his mood and maybe the phase of the moon. You simply choose the \"level\" menu per person at the table; each level is priced differently but you get what you pay for. I think we ended up choosing the $75/person dinner and ordered a couple of Tsingtao too.\n\nThis is some of the most delicious Chinese cuisine I've had in my life (a high compliment because I LOVE my mama's home-cooking and have eaten at some pretty nice restaurants in Taiwan/Japan/Hong Kong/Singapore). Every day vegetables and meats are turned into delicacies with the attention to detail in the cut, presentation, portions - everything. I was blown away at the whole experience.\n\nService? You'll have trouble. We were really confused because the staff, though smiley, didn't seem to speak English OR Mandarin. WTF?

Last night, I went there as part of a group of eight people, all of whom love really good food (and three of whom have been to the French Laundry--and agree with Mason Z's comment!). Every dish sparkles with freshness, everything was perfectly timed. It was a bit like sitting through a magnificent symphony, with each movement fitting perfectly with the ones that preceded and followed it, and yet memorable in itself. We opted for the least expensive option ($65/person), and left the restaurant feeling as though we'd snagged the bargain of the century.\n\nChef Nei integrates Chinese regional cuisine from around the country into a banquet of about ten courses or so (with the cold first-course consisting of about fifteen different small dishes). He begins with light, cool, palate-refreshing dishes reminiscent of southern and southeastern China, gradually working up toward the heat-filled dishes suggestive of the west, and then ends with the slightly sweet, smoky flavors recognizable from the Shanghai/Nanjing region (where Chef Nei is from). Some of the dishes were classics, and immediately recognizable (among them: abalone lightly tossed with eggwhites, edamame and beancurd sheets, red-braised pork shoulder, crystal shrimp), but most were creative reinventions of old themes. Of these, two that are deeply imprinted in my memory (or on my tastebuds?) are the taro balls with spareribs (the taro balls looked like beautiful pale marbles, lightly coated in glaze--creamy on the inside, crunchy on the outside), and a baby eggplant dish (the \"dessert\"!), that was also light, crunchy, and creamy all at once. \n\nI had the opportunity to speak with the chef at the end of the meal. He is shy, self-effacing, and passionate about what he does. He happens also to be a student of traditional Chinese medicine/nutrition, and integrates what he has learned about particular herbs and berries into his cooking. Perhaps that is why, this morning, instead of that heavy, bloated feeling one often gets from a lengthy (3-hour long) banquet, I felt light and energetic.\n\nWe were welcomed and served by a young woman who was warm, gracious, not intrusive.\n\nAs for the decor, well, it reminds me of the out-of-the-way, unpretentious-yet-memorable family-run restaurants one finds (if one is lucky, or guided by one who knows) in Taipei or Shanghai...I don't find it tacky, just low-key.

I am Chinese, and have eaten lots of good Chinese food in my life. Is it worth jacking up the price 400% to get a 20% improvement in taste from the average Chinese meal? NO.  \n\nFirst thing you notice was the ambiance: very typical Chinese restaurant look, not fancy pancy decor for the $$$$.  And the hostess/waitress was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt (ala colleges students).  It was also completely empty on a Friday night.  Not only that, but I think that we were the ONLY diners that night. People came in and left when they found out that this was not a typical, inexpensive Chinese restaurant around the corner.  Disturbing.  \n\nSo how this restaurant works is you have to pick what you want to PAY, not what you want to EAT, then the chef goes and gives you his take on a $60 meal (that's the lowest price!).  Did I mention that was PER PERSON? I could feed a family of 4 a huge feast for that price at a regular Chinese restaurant.  Oh and the portions were very meager.  Probably ~50% the size of what you would get at a typical restaurant.  \n\nOK enough complaining about the price.  The food admittedly was tasty.  There.  I said something nice.

I think that wait staff should make themselves invisible. The wait staff here was constantly at the table and this gave the impression they were almost another guest at the table. They were not overly conversational but their presence was too intrusive. Part of the problem was constantly re-filling the tea cups. I would prefer a tea pot at the table.

This restaurant is quite simply highway robbery.\n\nI went here with my girlfriend after being curious for several weeks and seeing a high rating in Zagat - 26 and the appeal of a tasting menu.  Now, before I launch into harsh criticisms - let me state that the food was in fact good - just nothing spectacular - and certainly not worth the outrageous price.  What are the prices?  $100, $128, and $160 per person (not the $65 listed).  There is no list of what is on the tasting menu and no indication as to what a higher price gets you.  We opted for the middle tier after being told that we would get fancier ingredients.\n\nFirst the atmosphere:  This is your normal hole in the wall Chinese restaurant (not a bad thing) albeit very clean and with a large array of artificial flowers.  There were only two other people in the entire restaurant when we arrived and the one woman who was paying seemed to be angry and impatient.  This should have been a warning.\n\nI have been to China and Taiwan over a dozen times and have been treated to a variety of good cheap meals and fancy business dinners.  My girlfriend is Taiwanese.  This is not to say that I am an expert on Chinese food - but I _can_ tell the difference between Panda Express and a banquet.\n\nThe dishes kept coming and there were plenty of them but after a couple rounds we started to worry since there was nothing to differentiate this from any other decent Chinese restaurant.  In fact it seemed that many of the plates were exactly the same with a subtle change of ingredients.  Besides the abalone and egg soup - I started to wonder what ingredients the extra $56 had bought over and above the already outrageous $200.  Everything had the same yellow bell peppers and scallions and there was very little variety in flavor.  One dish had canned corn.  Each of the dishes had fancy names - but were not any different than what you would get anywhere.  Szechuan Chicken is Szechuan Chicken by any other name.  When we asked what kind of fish the final dish was - the server told us that she didn't know and couldn't tell one fish from another. \n\nSo in the end we paid $300 for a dozen and half or so small dishes that we could have gotten at any restaurant in San Francisco.  There was nothing especially unique or standout. In fact I would say that even at normal prices - I am not sure I would go back a second time.  On a Zagat scale the atmosphere was a 12 and the food an 18-20.\n\nIn the end the server came out with the check and two Halloween-sized Milky Way bars that she called dessert.

All of it was fine, even good, but basically just Chinese food that was a cut above what you get at a low end Chinese restaurant.  They told us to expect a two hour meal. It lasted 4 hours, at one point there was 45 minutes between dishes (a costly night babysitter-wise!).  We'd reserved on Opentable and let them know ahead of time that of the three of us, one doesn't eat pork and one had a shellfish allergy. I reconfirmed that with the waiter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-08", "description": "This is a long overdue review. We've been going to Jai Yun since 2002. Chef Nei is nothing short of an artist and genius when it comes to Chinese cuisine.  I am Chinese and I have never had better Chinese food in US anywhere.  His style is unique, similar to Omakase in Japan which means \"entrust\" in Japanese, roughly translates to \"chef choice.\"  As with Omakase, chef Nei will serve different multiple courses based on the type of Omakase that customer has chosen, and each course is carefully selected and prepared by him.\n\nMost people equate Chinese food to large quantity of cheap food; mostly breaded and deep fried, and mixed with some sort of gooey sauce that's loaded with soy and sugar.  People don't think of quality in Chinese food, but they do with Japanese food.  What's with that?  I think it's time that we look at Chinese cuisine in a different light.  Chef Nei picks out the freshest ingredients daily and creates his multi-course feasts with his heart and soul.  As with any great Western chefs, chef Nei's creation represents him and his passions for food.  I have never had a meal there where I didn't leave happy and completely satisfied.  Everyone that I have ever brought to Jai Yun is always amazed how Chinese food can be so refined, varied and delicious.  It doesn't have to be greasy, saucy, sweet and loaded with MSG.\n\nDepending on which price fixed you select, the number of courses and types of main ingredients would vary.  The feast always starts with cold dishes like house-smoked fish, thinly sliced braised beef shank, Jelly fish salad, Enoki mushroom salad, spicy shredded Napa cabbage, 5-spiced bean curd with cilantro and pine nuts, thinly sliced crunchy lotus roots, cucumber salad, etc.  The first course of hot dishes is usually the Abalone Foo Young.  It's not the Americanized Egg Foo Young that looks and an overcooked omelet with gooey sauce all over it.  This is the real deal.  Foo Young means velvet in Chinese. The texture of the egg white in the Abalone Foo Young is velvety, delicate, and the flavor is and out of this world.  The thinly sliced Abalone is the most tender abalone we've ever had.  We always fight to lick the serving spoon at the end, so that every bit is devoured.\n\nDepending on the amount that you want to spend, season and freshness of the ingredients, he may serve Shanghainese crystal shrimp, saut\u00e9 Chinese celery with tofu and Chinese yellow chives, tofu skin (yuba in Japanese) stir fried with fresh soy beans and tiger lily flower buds (it's suppose to make you smart, so they say...it hasn't worked for me yet), orange peel beef (unlike any orange peel beef you've ever had), the real-deal spicy Kung Pao chicken (NOT breaded & deep fried), stir fried mung bean noodle sheets with house-cured Chinese-style ham and baby leeks, steamed winter melon topped with spiced pork ragu, braised Shanghainese pork ribs and taro root balls in clay pot.  All wonderful, but don't expect detailed descriptions, as English may be limited. The list can go on and on if you are willing to pay the price, just like the high-end restaurants in Northern California like Michael Mina, Cyrus, French Laundry, Gary Danko, Ame, Koi, etc.  You get to choose how much you want to spend and chef Nei will serve you a meal that you won't forget.  The only difference is his price will be a lot less than the fore mentioned restaurants.  Because, you won't be paying for the high rent, fancy d\u00e9cor, professional wait staff, highly compensated ma\u00eetre d' and sommelier, fancy crystals and silverware, high stocking costs of premium spirits and wines.  What you pay for is the amazing food; course after course.\n\nI'm so glad that he now opens for lunch during the week with less expensive price fixed menu.  Reservations for lunch is highly recommended, and it's required for dinner.  I still prefer dinner there, it's more expensive, but what can I say, I want to have all of the courses.  Lunch is a great compromise though, because not all of my friends can afford to go there for dinner every time.  I can't wait to go again next week, it's making me hungry just thinking about it.  If Jai Yun were right down the street from us, I'd go there at least once a week.  Oink! Oink!", "author": "TopCat W."}

There was no one there, but the place was open. There were three waitresses eager to help. I ordered the $25 menu.\n\nFour dish appetizers: marinated cucumbers, enoki mushrooms, vegetarian duck, shredded jelly fish -- yum.\n\nMain small plates: sauteed shrimp-- perfect. Fresh soy beans with tofu sheets -- tastes good, but salty. Kung Pao chicken -- quite good. Overall verdict: interesting concept, good food, but maybe a bit overpriced because you might be able to get the same quality of food elsewhere. Also, the dishes are really not that unique. But then there is no other Chinese restaurant like this format, and it was kind of fun not to know what i was going to eat.\n\nGiven that, i am not sure if I will return to give it another whirl.", "author": "L S."}

Loved it!\n\nIf you're looking for a typical Chinese restaurant, a big menu with lots of options and rice and stuff and things - this place is not it. I love 'standard' Chinese food and eat it often, this place just isn't that kind of restaurant.\n\nThis is a very special restaurant, that after having lived in San Francisco for 20 years, am so happy to have found to share with others. This is a a 'special occasion' restaurant. For parties of 4 and larger (we had 15 for dinner) it is perfect! There were 2-tops in there as well, but a large party here is very fun.\n\n1) Reservations - REQUIRED. Since the chef cooks everything fresh, every day, he shops for how many are coming for lunch or dinner\n2) Menus - there aren't any. You eat what the chef serves...vegetables, fish, meat, it is wonderful and fresh fresh fresh.\n3) Amount of food - the small(!!!!) plates keep coming and coming and coming...for dinner we had 12 tiny appetizers and then following that, 12-14 additional courses that came to our Lazy Susan. FUN FUN FUN. Take a small bite, and move on... \n4) Ambiance - this is a very standard Chinatown restaurant, you are not going there for ambiance, you are going for the food\n5) Prices - It is not an every week or month, kinda place. You pay for great great great food. The only real choice you have when you go is the price point you pay for the evening...and the difference in the price points are the kind of ingredients included in the dishes, pay more, get more fabulous dishes, pay less, and you get GREAT dishes.\n6) Rice - you don't get any rice with your meal...the food here is the focus.\n7) Service - the service is good enough, pleasant, and it is just fine.\n\nIf you're looking for something VERY different that you won't find anyplace else in San Francisco (I don't think), that serves GREAT Chinese food, and that you're going to experience fun and food and not worry about walking out with doggie bags, I ask you to try it.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Mark M."}

Our dinner consisted of 26 amuse-bouches, which usually would be complimentary from a French chef to prepare you for a culinary adventure.  It was definitely fine Chinese cuisine- finely chopped, finely minced, finely cubed, finely filleted, finely julienned dishes with subtle flavors and lack of textured- consisting of common Shanghainese and Northern courses.  Nothing  to write Mom about. This was my 3rd visit over the years of its existence.\nService left a lot to be desired - one waiter tending to two tables of duos and our table of five.  Have to continuously ask for tea refills, even though tea cups looks like six-inched vases.  Decor was not conducive to fine dining, drapes of plastic leaves vines, plastic flower arrangement including one of poinsetta, the whole venue of what one would expect in a Chinese resto somewhere on the transCanadian highway. A plus was the noiseless atmosphere.  If one is willing to spend this much per person, I would rather go to Koi Palace and have their $800 banquet dinner set for 10 persons, despite the noise there and the usually bad service.", "author": "John L."}

We both feel that most food in SF is just too pricey for what you get.  So I have to say that I was very happy to have sat down for a dinner at Jai Yun. We had the $80 per person Prix Fix. I have to say that each bite of every dish was a real pleasure and pleasant surprise.\n\n I wont go into detail on each dish, but the balance of flavors for every one of the 14 or so plates of food we were served was perfect. Each unique, bringing out the intended flavor of the main ingredients in the dish, balanced with wonderfully sweet, hot, spicy,tart, or aromatic blends each unique to its dish.  In my opinion nothing was overplayed or too understated.  The freshness of the food really stood out along with the care that must have gone into the preparation of each of these little gems.\n\nIf you want ambiance or a wine recommendation or polished service, you may want to check out your favorite French restaurant.\n\nBut if you want Chinese food carefully prepared with exceptional results from what I would consider a dedicated and masterful chef, you should go to Jai Yun.", "author": "BRIAN F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-30", "description": "I was all excited about finally eating excellent Shanghainese food in the bay area. But I was quite disappointed. I would say that the food is decent and authentic Shanghainese food, but, nothing special. In fact some of the cold dishes are not quite up to snuff. I found the beef shank to be undercook, it suppose to melt in your mouth. The vegetarian duck made of tofu was not moist enough and the texture was not smooth enough. The cold chicken, which traditionally is soaked in shao shing wine, lacks any taste. In fact, most of the cold dishes tasted kind of flat and too much sesame oil, rather than vibrant. Also, don't be impressed by the number of dishes, this is quite traditional for Shanghainese appetizers in any decent Shanghainese restaurant.\n\nThe hot dishes were also disppointing. For $65 dollar, the only costly dish was the abalone, which was smothered in egg white, which gave it a smooth texture, but the abalone was quite tastless. The braise pork was underdone and chewy. the lion's head meat ball, a tradition Shanghai dish was too small and since it is serve in a broth, the dish is totally transformed and lack that rich sauce that comes from the braising the meatballs. Ooh, and where is the famous eel in garlic sauce. One cannot judge how good the chef is without trying the chef's rendition of the eel in garlic sauce. And, what is Kung Pao chicken doing in a Shanghainese restaurant. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that Jai Yun can make foodies excited because there are really so few decent Chinese restaurants in the bay area. But if anybody has grown up in Hong Kong or has travelly extensively in Asia, you will know what great Shanghainese food is, and Jai Yun is just run of the mill. \n\nIt is too bad that Jai Yun can charge such as a high price for food that you can get in Hong Kong or China for a few bucks. But,  I think eventually, people will become aware of it. On the Thursday night when I had dinner there, there was only people in three tables. The restaurant is big and empty. Not a good sign. He might have become a bit too embitious in moving to this new location.  However, this might make him lower the price and develop a menu.  I think Jai Yun will be more sucessful if it becomes a regular restaurant serving decent Shanghainese food at a decent price. Right now, its a rip off.", "author": "Vivien L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-08", "description": "The first thing any prospective customer needs to know about this restaurant is that it does not work like any other restaurant I know of.  Your dinner will consist of approximately 20 or so tiny dishes, all of which are shopped for and planned ahead of time.  Your only choice is to pick the price point which will vary the specific dishes you get.  And the prices range from about $60/person to over $100/person, usually with rarer or more expensive ingredients as you go up in price.\n\nSo, you absolutely have to walk in knowing this.  I can understand people leaving if they are expecting a standard Chinese restaurant.  That's why it is important to read the reviews to understand the \"why\" of the ratings and therefore if that rating applies to you.\n\nOnce past that, the food is unbelievably good.  Now I am not Chinese so I have few reference points for this type of Chinese food.  The hallmarks are phenomenally fresh ingredients with taste, texture, and presentation that are spellbinding in every dish, and even more so the interplay between dishes.  Flavors are usually subtle but with enough variation to keep your eyes and your taste buds seriously entertained for hours.  Preparation, for example something as simple as julienned vegetables, are incredible in the perfection of the cuts and sizing to provide a fabulous experience.  Jai Yun serves a sensory overload of the highest order.  It is truly incredible and like absolutely nothing I've ever had.  Once in a while it is most definitely worth splurging at Jai Yun.\n\nIt is very useful to have a native Chinese speaker in your party to get an idea of what you are eating :-) as well as maybe make some dish tradeoffs along the way.  Maybe some mid-course corrections in spiciness might be required, etc.  It is also very helpful to have a larger party as more dishes can be brought out IIRC.\n\nCompared to other places that charge maybe $75 - $80/person, Jai Yun is right at or very near the top of that list.  I far prefer it to a stuffy and ostentatious French or latest-trend style restaurant.  What a gem for San Francisco!!", "author": "Mike K."}

We were also intrigued by the ordering approach - pick one of the predefined amounts ($45 - $150) you want to spend per person and your dishes will start coming. Based on everything I read, it seemed like the experience was more positive with more people so we decided to take my parents here.\n\nThere were four of us and we choose the $65 per person dinner. We lost count but we're guessing we had about 23 plates of food - mostly small/medium sized dishes and one large dish. Half of the dishes were cold, and the rest were hot.\n\nThe food was amazing! The meal was about taste and texture. The dishes came out slowly so we were able to taste and discuss. The entire experience took about an hour in the half to two hours. We were all pretty full by the end of the night. The service was good - polite. I don't think their dishes change too often - we had a lot of the same dishes as the other reviewers (Haterade B and Daniel T).\n\nThe place was really clean unlike most Chinese restaurants - I checked the restroom, too! The decorations are a bit random (ie, disco balls). This place is about the food experience.

Seriously!\nThis is the biggest scam I've ever seen when it comes to dining!\nThe food is okay; nothing to boast about. They charge $98 to $168 (non \"VIP\" menu) per person. You don't have a dining choice, only a price choice. The restaurant is Reservations Only so they know exactly how many folks should be dining. The waitress explained they buy food fresh to prepare for the evening. So it seems they already know the evening meal plan.  I suspect they play customers against each other (unbeknownest to them) by pushing for the higher priced choice. We were told the other table ordered the $168/person menu so they offered us the same food for the $128/person menu.  What a friggin' scam!  Now to the food.  Primarily tiny portions of various vegatables with very little meat or seafood.  Food costs are likely less than $10.00/person.  Again, it tastes okay, but a \"French Laundry of Chinese Food\" it is NOT.  The restaurant is along a quiet, dark street - not in the main Chinatown area. The decor is akin to a $5.00 fast food restaurant (paper place settings and cheap chinaware)...not at all what one would expect for $100+ per person. Service is fair; they were nice.  Whe we dined, the place is dead...no business.  There were two or three tables of two when were were there (one couple was behind us and we believe there was another couple but we never saw them).  Place appears to seat at least 40 people.  Waitress indicated it's never full because of the \"reservations and special for preparation.\"  I doubt it; probably more because SF folks know it's way overpriced!  If we hadn't made Open Table reservations, if we hadn't just arrived after a 4-hour flight and weren't really famished, and if it weren't a special evening for my wife and I, we would have walked out.

I wanted to show him this neat little place. He was quite anxious to experience it. I must say, I quickly became bored with the same dishes as I had the previous times. I thought the point of having no menu means dishes would be different every week if not every day, or at least from time-to-time, season-to-season. Instead, I had the same things every time, especially the cold dishes: jelly fish, cucumber, gluten, sliced beef shank, etc.  Even most of the hot dishes were the same: kung pao chicken, orange beef, spicy tofu, etc.\n\nMy friend was not impressed although he did remark that this is probably the best Chinese food in all of San Francisco.

the chef fried the skin of the eggplant so that it disintegrated as you bit into the flesh, leaving a lightly smoky taste in on the palate. simply amazing.\n\nfor the finale, there was the ti pang rou, the smoked and roast pork shank, where the meat was so tender, you could pull it apart with two forks and the fat was braised to the consistency of near melted butter.\n\nnow, having waxed poetic about the food, but after giving much thought about our experience and reading through my thoughtful dining companion's review on this restaurant (i dare say his palate may be even more refined than mine in many ways), i have to bring the rating down two stars.\n\nwhen i arrived at the restaurant, no one was at the front of the house to greet diners, and there was not a single soul in sight. the first rule of a good chinese restaurant is that it is always packed to the nines around dining rush hours. that there was not one person there made me think twice.\n\nalso, there wasn't a menu available to list the ingredients or dishes. you are given a little bound pamphlet, which explains why you're not given a menu, only a sliding scale of how much money you'd like to spend at the establishment. most chinese people would turn their nose up immediately and walk out of the restaurant at this point. my friend and i chose $65/per person (mind you, this is also cash only, which makes it even harder to stomach when you really want to know what will be placed in front of you). i asked quite a few questions of the server, who also happens to be the son of the chef/owner and he explained that everything is based on what his father could pick out fresh the day of, based on the number of reservations at the restaurant and how much each diner was willing to spend. \n\nnext, the question of beer or wine came up. again, no beer or wine list, and the server came back, bringing about a total of 7 bottles of white wine, all chardonnay with one sauvignon blanc. all of the wines were californian and picked arbitrarily by the family as the server readily admitted they didn't know much about wine pairings with chinese food. \n\ni wanted to cry at this point. i could excuse the cheap plastic decor and pokemon origami stars hanging from the ceilings, but i couldn't really excuse this. jesus, i've hit 5000 characters on this review!", "author": "May T."}

But for SF, it is still a novelty as the knife work and general attention to detail is very good.  As they do not do a lot of business (mostly because it is expensive) the oil they use to cook needs to change more readily as one can taste the tad rancid oil in the spicy chicken dish...but overall, would like to see the chef here change the menu every month and lower prices as it seems to 'gimmicky' now.

I also pre-load with 4 pieces of grilled cheese since I read about the portion sizes in advance.\n\nOur party had 6 so the total ended up $310+. With that kind of money, if we went to R&G or South Sea Seafood Village, we'd be eating Geoduck sashimi, steamed whole fish (that was swimming in the tank 10 minutes ago), steamed oysters with black bean sauce, smoked sea bass, probably a mound of fresh shrimp, whole crab (possibly 2), and free steamed rice.\n\nI grew up in Hong Kong. I kid you not, Hong Kong has pretty decent Shanghai restaurants because of the flood of immigrants from Shanghai after the Nationalist party had been kicked out of China by the Communists. The dishes served at Jai Yun are NOT worth raving about. They are decent, not spectacular. Saying that they are overpriced is an understatement.\n\nPickled vegetables, tofu products, and Chinese wheat gluten are in abundance every single fracking day in Chinatown. They're not what the chef find super fresh and unique for the day. You want duck tongues? they're $3 a pound a block away. You want beef tripe? New Asia has them for dimsum and they're less than $3 a dish. You want pickled cucumber with sesame oil? Give me $10 I can drown you with  a whole bottle of sesame oil and 8 huge cucumbers.\n\nDiet coke served was expired back in 2007. I will never go there again.", "author": "DANIEL T."}

I agree, if you aren't Chinese, then you may think that this place is the greatest thing since sliced bread (my boyfriend is white), however, because I am Chinese, this place was nothing special. 65 bucks for a person is a bit much so I was expecting something jaw-dropping and spectacular, I was expecting things I have never seen before, but I was wrong.

But in all fairness, this restaurant is such a gem, such a unique experience, the word needs to get out.\nForget all of the other Chinatown restaurants with gloppy sauces, repetitive menu offerings and mediocre quality. Jai Yun offers the freshest ingredients prepared simply and perfectly. Don't worry about the lack of a menu or the small portions, you will be completely satisfied after an offering of a dozen or so dishes. The cold appetizers are intriquing and amazingly refreshing. Then, the sauted abalone, the kung pao chicken (unlike anything you will find elsewhere), the crystal shrimp, the lightly fried mushrooms and the spicy eggplant deserve to be considered classic dishes. (I hate eggplant except the version served at Jai Yun). \nI have taken scores of SF visitors, business clients and SF foodies to Jai Yun and they have consistently raved - \"how come I never knew about this place.\" I have even taken hearty meat eaters here who marvel at their new-found love for dishes comprised of vegetables, soy bean, tofu and wheat gluten. My vegan guests love this place.\nIs it expensive? Yes, if you compare it to the other cookie-cutter Chinatown restaurants with their overly corn-starched sauces, canned vegetables and  piles of flat-tasting noodles. But if you compare Jai Yun's prices to those of other foodie-favorite, non-Chinese restaurants, Jai Yun is a terrific value. And the real secret is to try Jai Yun for lunch - reasonable prices ($18-25 per person), no reservations required and the place is empty, making conversation and business discussions easy. \nI recently took 10 people to Jai Yun for my wife's birthday - out-of-town guests, jaded SF foodies and a couple of kids. Everyone loved this place. \nReally, if you haven't tried Jai Yun, you are missing the best of what SF has to offer in unique restaurant experiences.", "author": "Scott R."}

This experience was so delightful, so beautifully executed, and delicious (though at times also curious) that I felt moved to rate. I recently read the book by Nicole Mones, The Last Chinese Chef. Her descriptions of the varieties of provincial Chinese cuisine, their meanings and origins fascinated me to the point that I wanted the experience. To my delight, at the end of her book she listed acknowledgments of chefs who had helped to educate her as well as those who still practice the form she wrote about. The chef at Jai Yun was one of those she listed. She was right that the atmosphere of the restaurant is remarkable for its plainness. The food is remarkable for the opposite: excellent to exquisite at times. Those who have written to make sure to have a reservation and come hungry are right. If Mones is correct that chefs descended from the Imperial Chinese form are few and far between anywhere, this may explain why even those who feel they know authentic Chinese cuisine might not recognize this. Our experience suffered none of those listed by the disgruntled. What can I say? It was great. The service staff were family to each other and they treated us as guests in the true sense of the word.

I believe I spent $55 for dinner here, and was at a table of 10. It was one of the most delightful dinners I have ever had in my life. But it does help to go here without preconceived notions of what a Chinese restaurant should be or what a $55 dinner should be (other than wonderful), and the food definitely better be more important for you than the service or ambiance, as it is for me.\n\nBetween the 10 of us, we had 14 cold/chilled/room temp dishes served all at once. Once we had devoured those (and we were careful not to overeat, since we knew there was more food coming), the remaining 12 or so dishes were served one at a time. Yes, all but two of the plates (the pork leg and the whole fish) were tiny, but we each got some of everything, and nobody left hungry. In fact, there was food left over. And there was not a grain of rice in sight for the entire meal.\n\nActually, it's best if you do come in a big group, for more variety. And you don't need Chinese, unless you want to know what you're eating :) But it's all good.\n\nI had never had most of the dishes before. Every one of them at least tasted pretty good and many were magnificent. While a few ingredients turned up a little too often, there was a good variety of spicy, not spicy, chewy, soft, veggie, not veggie, don't ask, this, that, etc.\n\nYes you could get some of these dishes for a lot less at some other restaurant. But not all of them, and probably not most of them. Abalone and shark's fin are pricey ingredients, for sure. And tasting menus cost more at virtually any restaurant. So stop complaining.\n\nFor those who complain that the requirement for a reservation makes the place seem like more than it is, you have to go back to Oliva Wu's article several years ago in the Chronicle that outed the place. Before her article, you could just drop in and they'd start bringing dishes out until you were full, then you'd pay for what you ate. You bussed your own table, got your own tea, etc. Oh, and the clientle was almost exclusively Asian.\n\nAfter the article, the place was overrun. I'm sure he put in the mandatory reservations policy to maintain his health and sanity.\n\nDon't dis him for the reservation policy. It keeps him sane and minimizes the waste of fresh food which he has to buy each day.\n\nNo, I would not eat here often. It's not that type of place. Would you go to the same French restaurant for their tasting menu every week? To the same Japanese place for their kaiseki? No, you'd burn out.\n\nBut I'd like to make this a yearly thing, and I recommend it to my friends and to visitors (provided I know their preferences for restaurants are similar to mine).\n\nBy the way, someone posted a review for the new place over at the old page, so go read it.", "author": "Charles B."}

If you are a walk-in, you probably have to find another place for your meal. The waitress told us the chef himself buys the stuffs in the morning to prepare lunch, and again in the afternoon to prepare for dinner. That's why they don't have a menu, and you don't have to order, and you don't know how many dishes will come to your table. You get whatever the fresh ingredients he can find on that day. We had 8 appetizer and 6 (or 8?) hot dishes and 1 very small dessert on that day. The waitress also told us that if the ingredients are a little more expensive, you might have 1 less dish. I think she also mentioned something that if you come in a bigger group, say 8 people, you will have over 30 dishes together, and the dishes will cover 95% of vegetables and meat available in the market.\n\nI know that Michelin guides are not interested in Chinese food, but if they do, the food in this place deserves almost one star (or definitely half a star, :)).", "author": "Carol L."}

We had a total of 18 different S to M size fine dishes one L size final dish. Since I lived in Hong Kong for over 16 years, this particular branch of Chinese cuisine brought back a lot of fond memories, as dishes like these were only served in private supper clubs, such as club houses established in Hong Kong for people from the same root far away in mainland China, aka word-by-word in Chinese \"same-village-society\". Everything that was served to us at Jai Yun was as fresh as it could be, perfectly executed, served at a temperature that was supposed to be consumed right away, which also explains why the size of the dishes was best kept S to M so that you would not have to eat a lot of the same thing over a long period of time while the temperature drops and texture changes. It is like a banquet without having to invite 15 friends to share. If you love food, this would be a TRUE fine dinning experience. Suggestion: make reservation early, be on time, be ready for a 2 straight hours of well planned dinning experience, bring cash as credit card is not accepted, and very important, listen to your server's valuable suggestion(s).\n\n5 Stars for quality of food, 4 Stars for quality of service, 5 Stars for dinning experience, 5 Stars for being clean, 3 Star for interior decor (not my priority as a food lover), hence overall 4.5 Stars.\n\nNote: if you have a stick on top of your head, that might be just what you need if you could get it to work.", "author": "Mango N."}

And the experience can be summed up in one word: WTF.\n\nSo we chose the $18 price point.  We had no idea what's coming out and how much of it is coming out.  But we were excited and intrigued based on the reviews we read about this place.\n\nSo 5 small (read: REALLY SMALL) plates came out very quickly.  They were the cold dishes.  And what a disappointment.  They were so tiny and not even impressive - it looked like dishes made from leftover ingredients or decorations used for other bigger and better things.  There was a teeeeeny mound of jelly fish.  Bad jelly fish. It was mushy, and not crunchy.  There was some pickled cabbage - way too spicy and no flavor.  Some pickled cucumbers.  REALLY?! a teeny mound of pickled cucumbers?  Why bother?  It wasn't anything special, and certainly wouldn't go to a resturant to eat it.  Some really really salty brocoli stems.  (very likely part of the section they thew out after using the big brocoli stems for last nights dinners).  And some other pickled dish.  Then 3 hot dishes.  Also TIIIIIINNNY plates.  A small mound of spicy ground chicken, a small mound of shrimp, and a small mound of gluten.  None of it tasted bad.  But it definitely wasn't anything to write home about.  And DEFINITELY not worth $18!  C'mon, those 5 pickled dishes are normally the freebies they put out on the table before your main meal comes, and this was included in your \"assortment\" of dishes for $18?\n\nNothing tasted bad, but the whole experience left a very bad taste in my mouth considering I just paid $22 for so-so food and in small quantities.  Terrible value!\n\nIf you're out to lunch, skip this place and go elsewhere... R&G is just around the corner!  (ps - for the record, right after our \"lunch\" at Jai Yun, we walked over to R&G to order a beef chow fun to go so we could actually be full.)", "author": "Stella M."}

No customers either.  I see the waitress and ask to see the menu.  She shows me the menu that has three prices: $18, $25, $35.  That's it.  No description of any of the options.  To my questions what each price includes, she says the chef will pick it for you.  She suggests to go with $18.  Okay.  First, it's some pickled vegetables kind of Korean style.  Not bad, and presentation is beautiful.  Then comes a shrimp dish, which was pretty tender, but I needed some soy sauce with it.  I also asked for a bowl of rice.  Then came a mushroom dish and some warm salad.  Mushrooms were very nice.  At this point the lunch was over.  The waitress comes up to me and says that since they are not busy (I am still alone in the restaurant), the chef will make another dish for me.  Since I am still hungry, I ask for some meat.  After that, I hear some arguing in Chinese coming from the kitchen.  The waitress comes back and says that it was her mistake, and that I already had two hot dishes while only one was allowed for $18 lunch.  Oh, well.  I'd say I would not go there again.  A better description of what to expect would also be nice.", "author": "Pasha G."}

You tell this petite Nanjing chef what you want to spend---$65/person? $120/person?  (There's no menu.  It's like a pris fixe meal.)That determines what dishes you'll get.  We were a table of 6 and spent $70/person (so $500+ bill without alcohol, and $80 tip).  14 cold/ chilled/ or room temp dishes arranged very attractively, all delicate and refined versions of typical central Chinese cooking.  (You have to be seasoned in Chinese cooking to recognize what an incredible job these dishes were.  I read Michael Bauer's review in the SF Chronicle and thought he didn't quite understand what these dishes were about.) Then came the hot food (warm)(spicy)(really spicy).  In total there were 31 dishes.  Had the chef stopped at about 20 dishes, we would have walked away saying \"WOW, great food!\" but at 31 dishes, it became \"Hey, too much food.  You need to stop.\"  Too much food ruined the experience.  But every dish was, to our Chinese taste buds, a real hit, except for the fish in a salsa-like sauce and a fish-fillet sauteed with little veggies;  the fish didn't taste fresh---so definitely a miss.", "author": "Bo P."}

Yes, it's expensive, but so is every other restaurant in the city, and the food was tasty and very fresh.  I took one star off because now that I've gone I don't feel the need to go back for a long time.  A tasting menu is nice when that is what you're in the mood for, but it can also get old quickly.", "author": "Adam P."}

Their website/Lonely Planet Guide has an incorrect (old) address, there is no menu, and one must have a reservation to eat there for dinner. (Walk-ins are okay for lunch.) There are three price levels and it's not cheap. Without a recommendation, I probably would not have gone there. I am glad I had the recommendation! \n\nI had dinner there this weekend with a group of 6. We had more than 20 dishes, we lost count. We brought our own wines - unoaked whites and low tannin reds go well. There are some good descriptions of the food in the previous reviews. Those that I can remember include: the ethereal abalone/egg white salty custard, radish pickles, lotus root salad, cucumber pickles, cilantro and tofu salad, sliced smoked fish, spiced vegetarian mock duck, crunchy jellyfish salad, hot and spicy sliced cold beef, seaweed salad, \"kung pao\" chicken Jai Yun Style, an enoki mushroom dish with paper thin slivers of feathery tripe, edamame with \"tofu noodles\", sweet and salty gluten cubes, chinese broccoli, delicious chunks of buttery-textured eggplant with a crispy, caramelized-tasting spicy coating, crispy fried orange beef, stir fried shrimp,  deep fried mushrooms, mung bean noodles, stir fried matchsticks of eggplant and mushroom, and the grand finale was a whole grouper smothered in a colorful sauce of minced herbs and vegetables. I know there were more, I can't remember them all.\n\nThe food is light, fresh and artistically presented in small portions. Vegetables shine here, accented with seafoods and meats in hot and cold dishes. The overall experience is one of contrast and balance - colors, flavors, textures - salty, sweet, hot. I recommend this place for omnivores, as there is indeed no menu - you are served what is selected for that evening's service by the chef. Dinner for us was like a gigantic tasting menu and we ate everything. Go expecting a unique experience and take your time. This is not a fast meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual. The restaurant is immaculately clean.", "author": "G F."}

I had noticed this place before, but had always assumed it was your run-of-the-mill Chinese food place with the Kung Pao chicken rice plate listed at 5.95 for the lunch special.  This was NOT the case at all.  \n\nWhen I walked in, the place was empty.  I was seated by an amicable woman and handed a one-page menu with a written preface and prices listed instead of dishes. 18/22/25.  A bit thrown off, I went with the cheapest course, and hoped for the best.  At this point, in retrospect, this experience reminded me of a drug-related experience in college.  With that said, I was first handed a small array of four appetizers.  The first 'gateway' dish being seaweed [wink].  This was followed by dishes that, under normal circumstances, I would pass on, say if I was at my hypothetical Chinese Aunt's house: jellyfish, fake chicken meat, and some pickled bits (of \"I'm not sure what this is.\")  All were excellent.  This was followed up by what I would compare to the purest white substance not snorted, but ingested, white abalone mixed with some egg whites.  I say this in jest of course.  This dish probably sounds unappetizing but think of it as your typical tuna sandwich mix taken up a couple notches.  This was followed by a tasty salad with cilantro.  The final dish was a bowl of mushrooms.  Now, when I mentioned that this had reminded me of an experience in college, I must throw a disclaimer out and say by no means do I endorse recreational drug use nor mean to glorify illegal substances.  With that said, the mushroom dish was a trip and a half.  They were so good.  Legendary.  They had the most delicate deep fry layer around the ideal mushroom consistency with the right amount of heat, spices, and garlic.  I'm not the biggest mushroom guy but every bite was transcendant and made me put the book I was reading (not \"The Hobbit\" as you're probably thinking), and I let myself savor every piece. \n\nAll in all, it was a $20 lunch experience that I had not expected myself to get into.  But I definitely plan on coming back here with others next time, when my wallet can handle it, and when I need that fantastic mushroom fix.", "author": "James D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-25", "description": "These reviews originally prompted me to take my entire party of 16 here to celebrate my birthday. Let me explain - this restaurant has been raved about all over Yelp. I was born in and subsequently lived in China for a total of about 7 years, and have a taste for tasty, authentic Chinese food. I can't deny that I'm a picky eater but I know good food when I eat it.\n\nWhat's been said:\n- Food is authentic and unique, as compared to the many other restaurants in the touristy downtown SF Chinatown\n- Food is plentiful, dish after dish after dish comes\n- Food is varied, especially when with a large crowd (they cook many many small dishes and dishes are consumed family style)\n\nWhat actually happened:\n- The service was atrocious. I think there was 1 server/busboy/everything boy for the entire restaurant, at 8pm on a Saturday evening. Other than my party of 16, there were maybe 4-5 other tables there. He was not rushing around to accommodate everyone, in fact, we asked twice to get water before getting water. I asked twice to get tea, and in fact just never got tea the entire evening. He did not smile once and acted such that everything he did was a favor (and not for the big, fat undeserving tip that we gave him for no good reason). Let me tell you - even in China, no matter what quality restaurant, they serve with a grand big smile on the face.\n- The food - \"plentiful\" is an antonym, and I am a 100 lb Asian girl and \"scarce\", \"minuscule\" and \"non-existent\" better serve as an accurate description. Having read that the only complaint some diners have had here is that there is too much food, and it comes on coming and coming (!!!), I tried to, as advised, sample some of each dish. By the time they brought out the third to last dish, we inquired as to the status of the flow of the meal, and were informed there were only 2 more coming. I think all of my guests died a little on the inside. By the end of this meal I was by no means full. And I get full easily. I am aware the rest of you seem to have had a different experience here but I simply DO NOT UNDERSTAND what went wrong and why we were are left unfulfilled.\n- The food itself - unique? Kind of, if you've never been to China or eaten at a Chinese restaurant that is not R&G (i.e. catered to foreigners/tourists and the financial district lunch crowd). They are basic cold dishes that are popular in China but the ingredients themselves are of the most basic kinds: cucumbers, beef, tofu. Nothing was original or creative. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A DINING EXPERIENCE!!!\n\nI've said enough. To summarize, food is not plentiful, food is not unique, service is atrocious and ambiance (caveat, as expected) is non-existent.\n\nWe got the $65 per person prix fix ($80 all in, which means fat tip for our useless waiter/busboy/person thing). So let me do the math for you - that is over $1000 all in, and they could not have treated us better. I am utterly disappointed - this restaurant was meant to be the hidden gem that showed the truly unique and authentic side of Chinese cuisine, with which I have grown up with and love.\n\nIf you plan to spend that much per person, spend a bit more and go to Gary Danko, where their 4 course prix fix is $80 (my best culinary experience within city limits). Or for a more Asian feel - go to Slanted Door. Although it's hard to get reservations here, it is NOT as expensive as you'd think (unless you choose to abuse their extensive wine collection). But 2 people, a few dishes and 2 glasses of wine? You can swing that for $100.\n\nIf you want my personal recommendation for the best Chinese food in the city? Head over to the real, authentic area in the Richmond among Clement/Geary streets. I love Szechuan food, specifically the Szechuan spiciness - Spices and Spices II are teeming with people, and entrees average $10 each or under. I consider this the real, true hole-in-the-wall Chinese experience.", "author": "Y W."}

If you do bring your children, make sure they have eaten and you are willing to pay at least half of the adult price.  We had the $65 pp and went home hungry with a bill of 370 + tips.  We could have gone down LA for better tasting food, nicer ambiance, and some extra $ in our pocket.  We had no soup, no dessert,  no rice and no variety.  The abalone dish we had was tasteless and oily.  All hot dishes we had were either stir fried or deep fried.  Nothing steamed, grilled, or slow cooked or prepared otherwise.  If you think the photos of the cold dishes are appealing, I feel that's the best you are gonna get.   Also, if you think this is a Shanghai restaurant, you will be in for a surprise.  Over half of the dishes we had were spicy.  However, it's not spicy enough for people who like Szechun food.   The bath room is clean.  There are very few dinners in the place.  They don't validate parking.  The server we had did not know much about what's in the dish.  We were so disappointed with the experience and dishes.      If you decide to go at least once, be sure to make reservation.  I saw them turn away 2 people who came in.  They also start to take credit cards now.", "author": "Terry C."}

Came here for the first time yesterday for my birthday lunch with a large group. I am honestly a bit sick of going places and then spending like 20 minutes JUST to order and then another 10 minutes at the end figuring out what everyone owes. It was just so nice to have a pre-fixe price + the chef picks what you get. WOOHOO - give me just what's good so I don't waste my time ordering something that takes like .. well you know. This is definitely some of my favorite Chinese food in San Francisco (Hands Down!) - not too oily, flavorful, simple and truly representing a Mandarin style of cooking (Hunan, Shanghainese, and a couple of other regions). You can guarantee that you won't leave filling a super food coma as a result of the MSG and LARD used to cook your food. I brought my co-workers who are not all Asian (plenty of diversity at the table) and not a single person complained. There were some people who didn't want certain things like shrimp, but they had plenty of other stuff to eat. The price ranges for lunch are $9/$18/$25/$35 and yes your whole table has to get the same thing. We chose the $18 lunch. All the dishes were great - the favorites of the table being the fish, the pork leg, and the fried mushrooms. Great atmosphere, a pretty quiet restaurant to bring groups (at least for lunch), and personally prob some of my favorite food here in the FiDi/Chinatown area.", "author": "Jeannette L."}
