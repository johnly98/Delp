The answer is never the answer.\" - The Art of Fiction \n\nLocation: The Tenderloin District, San Francisco. \n\nI had a really nice, but mysterious dinner here. First, my dinner was delicious, and jasmine tea as smooth as smooth. The service (family owned & operated) was very friendly to the point that I felt they wanted to adopt me, lol. Yet even though everything was a green light I can't help notice the \"mystery\" I had... this mysterious place is called Tuyet Mai. \n\nI've been on a Asian persuasion mission this past week, dining at Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai restaurants, and tonight Vietnamese called Tuyet Mai. After perusing Yelp I find Tuyet Mai with solid reviews and what stood out was \"family owned\" and \"delicious foods\". I was sold to cross the safety zone and enter into Tenderloin territory, if you know, you know, and yet where most authentic Vietnamese restaurants are located. Tuyet Mai it is! \n\nAfter zigzagging the hood I find Tuyet Mai on Hyde St. & O'Farrell St., a stones throw from an Adult Theater, Liquor Store, and derelict whatever that was, yet the location on Hyde was actually calm with a good vibe. I enter with a warm \"Engrish\" greeting and handed the menu. Jasmine tea is served. I decide on the dry vermicelli with spring rolls & bbq pork. I then ask the Mrs. on what does \"meat roll\" on another dish meant. Her response was \"you try it\" lol. Um ok. So she makes my dinner with added \"mystery meat\" lol. \n\nThe Bun Cha Gio is served pretty quickly. And I notice after a few bites of the \"mystery meat\" that it's some sort of sausage sliced up. Pretty good actually. My dinner was delicious with a good ratio of meats, vegetables, and vermicelli. The fish sauce was on point and allowed the combination of foods to mingle well. The jasmine tea flowed nicely. \n\nIn the end, I recommend Tuyet Mai to all. The only caution flag is my \"mystery\" bill. See many come to the Tenderloin to eat \"cheap\" Vietnamese food. I expected the same. And why I was charged an additional $3 is a mystery indeed. It most likely was for the \"mystery\" meat that I only had a question on but the Mrs. added it to my plate. I guess, I had no clue I was ordering it?! Kinda like ordering a foot massage but being told to go all around the world...", "author": "Eric R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-01", "description": "Tenderloin has an abundance of Vietnamese restaurants in-fact there are as many as 8 specialized Pho restaurants apart from banh mi and coffee shops. I randomly decided to try Tuyet Mai one Saturday afternoon for lunch. At the peak lunch hour, it was completely empty. This seemed a bit odd as most other Vietnamese restaurants usually have a wait at this time. Anyway, as I had already committed myself I decided to push ahead and get something. After going through the menu, I decided to get the Duck curry noodle soup ($9.30) as I had not seen this item at other Pho restaurants. I had to pay cash as I think I did not hit the minimum required for cards.\n\nAfter ordering it was a long 20+ minute wait for getting the food. It seemed that the kitchen was working on a large to-go order of almost 10 servings that they had to fulfill before they could attend to my order. I got two containers, a large plastic container with the soup and another small Chinese to-go container with the noodles which was a good start as it prevented the noodles from soaking up all the broth by the time I reached home. Let's start with the good stuff. The duck noodle soup was pretty good. Even though there were no big chunks of duck meat its flavor came through pretty well. I was expecting it to be very salty but it turned out to be properly seasoned. Now for the bad. The quantity of noodles that I got was very tiny, filling about half the small to-go container. What's worse if that they were small strands that seemed to be left over from the large order. It was as if they just took all the leftover noodles from the last order and packed those off for me. This is just not done. Goes without saying that I did not like what I got.\n\nPrice-wise it was pretty cheap and inline with what you would pay at other Pho restaurants in the hood. Unfortunately, the quality of the noodles let these folks down which is a pity as the soup itself was pretty good. I'm going to attribute this to maybe a onetime thing and try them again in due course but given what I got I'm in no hurry to do that.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

The place is family-run and quite small with such old-fashioned 90s Vietnamese style decor but that's how you it's authentic. My friends and I were in San Francisco for only 2 days and a half and we came here twice already. It is so hard to find a decent Vietnamese restaurant in New York so we basically ate everything we could. \n\nThe menu offers a very wide range of Vietnamese dishes from all kinds of noodle soup and rice cake to main entrees. Bun Bo Hue, Ca Kho To and Canh Chua Ca are my favorite. Ca kho to and canh chua came along so well with white rice and reminded me of my mom's food. Bun Rieu, Mi Quang, Pho Bo, Bun Mam, Chao Long...I can't even remember all the dishes we had but they were all so delicious. If you want to try something different, definitely go for Banh Beo (rice cake with dried shrimp and dipping sauce). I couldn't find any place on the East Coast that serves this delish and I was so happy to find it here. \n\nCafe sua da (iced coffee with condensed milk) and Tra da chanh (iced lemon tea) were rally refreshing and tasty as well. I only wish they had all the desserts listed on the menu, which then didn't. \n\nI repeat you can't never go wrong with Tuyet Mai!

After having an order of the BBH, I would definitely say that it comes close to its SJ competitor and even surpasses it in other ways! The BBH here had super tender cuts of meat that could only be achieved with either high quality meat and/or good cooking method. The cha was more flavorful than I typically find in BBH. The noodles were perfect too! Very bouncy and chewy as opposed to a denser, basic noodle. I would only say that the broth at BBH An Nam is spicier and flavored with more lemongrass than this one was. \n\nWe also had an order of the spring rolls which were HUGE. Half of an order and a small BBH was very filling for me.

It's family-run, which I like very much, and the space is modestly decorated. The food itself is not the predictable selection but central Vietnamese variations that originate from the town of Hue. Now believe it or not, I've been to Hue in my travels, but I can't for the life of me, remember anything that unique about the cuisine in that area except I did take a private cooking class in nearby Hoi An from a sassy, sharp-tongued chef named Miss Vi.\n\nI was folding that banana leaf with hospital corners, but I digress. This place focuses on Hue's clear-broth noodle soups, so I ordered one, the $8.30 bowl of  Hu Tieu Ngoc Mai with shrimp, chicken, squid, fish balls, and a whole lot of cilantro (photo: http://bit.ly/29GgtWg). It was actually a bit bland for my taste with the broth too watery to savor really. However, the complete miss for me was the $7.40 B\u00e1nh Xep, the pork pot stickers which were skimpy on filling and just a little too limp and under-cooked in texture to satisfy (photo: http://bit.ly/29FrGoW). It wasn't enough to scare me off as I have a feeling with a bit more guidance, I could have ordered more fruitfully. Otherwise I could just show them what Miss Vi taught me in the kitchen.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...a bit disappointing but perhaps my palate was shaped by other parts of Vietnam so as not to be more discriminating\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a modest setting\nSERVICE - 3 stars...very quiet\nTOTAL - 3 stars...like Hue, it's in the middle somewhere", "author": "Ed U."}

Not only are do they serve this region of food but it is so on point to the authenticity of presentation and quality that I have to say it is my favorite vitamins restaurant in the city of San Francisco. It is that good. The customer service is very simple and also very very friendly. This is a family owned restaurant that serves food that is the closest as it gets to traveling to Vietnam but you're still in the United States. On the menu I highly recommend if you like spicy food,the Bun Bo Hue. Also an item that is very traditional in Vietnam is called Banh Xeo, Vietnamese style crepe. It's a very small restaurant and it's a very small location so coming here you need to beat the lunch rush in order to sit and enjoy yourself. If you see a line it's worth the wait, if you don't see a line then you're like you're lucky. If I can give this place more than five stars I would do it, definitely highly recommend it.", "author": "Dang D."}

I like that they're usually not super busy, and very clean, very quiet, and warm and welcoming. \n\nI've had their Bun Bo Hue which was very flavorful, a bit on the meatier side but still feels very light and tasty. Bun rieu is also good. I really like their Banh Xeo, it's crispy and fresh and served with lots of big lettuce leaves, the only thing I didn't like was the Banh xeo had too much pork jerky in it it was on the chewy side. I will tell them to remove the pork next time. \n\nI really like how their fresh veggies selection is a bit different from other pho places. They have a different selection instead of the normal basil/mint. There are other herbs that I couldn't name. Very tasty. \n\nThe reason for 4 stars is because even though they work really well as a simple family restaurant, their food always lacks a little bit of the delicacy touch. That makes them \"good but not amazing\". However, they're very solid for lunch if you want simply good food and friendly service.", "author": "Wendy K."}

The door to the restaurant has peeling paint and is a little difficult to open. The restaurant reminds me of a typical nicer-than-average restaurant you would see in Vietnam. By American standards, the restaurant is pretty run down. The service was excellent and very attentive. \n\nWe both ordered bun rieu and shared an order of egg rolls. The egg rolls came out freshly fried and with plenty of fresh lettuce to wrap it in. I'm usually picky about the nuoc cham that Vietnamese restaurants offer. The nuoc cham that came with the egg rolls was delicious and tasted just like my family's recipe. \n\nThe bun rieu was underwhelming and bland in my opinion. I had to add fish sauce to add more flavor to my broth, which was disappointing since the broth is usually the best part. I enjoyed that the bun rieu comes with tomatoes, shrimp, crab, tofu, and pork blood, but I could have gone without the overcooked shrimp. There also was barely any crab, another disappointment.

A regular consisted of 5 pieces or so of beef, a thin cut of pork feet, one slice (not even cube) of pork blood, and one small handful of noodles. The large didn't seem much larger by comparison. But I guess as the saying goes- quality over quantity any day.", "author": "Ada C."}

This is completely different kind of hangover cure! I love this place because of all the authentic vietnamese appetizers and noodle soup (other than pho or pho ga) here. \n\nLet me tell you, coming here on a saturday or sunday morning is like going to AA meeting with a bunch of hungovers. Everyone reek of alcohol from the crazy night before, errrrbody looks like sh*t haha complaining about how much they hate alcohol, and of course everybody is dying for that hot steamy bowl of noodle soup! \n\nEvery time I'm here, we always over order. Our eyes are always bigger than our stomach, trying to order all the amazing appetizers they have here such as Banh Xeo (the crepe with mushroom, beans sprouts and shrimp), fried calamari, and that vietnamese steamed rice cake thingy (sorry i forgot the name). They also have similar dry pho as Ha Na Nimh but it's a little different. \n\nMust try - BUN BO HUE & BUN RIEU\nIt's absolutely delicious! It hits the spot if you are looking for some hot steamy soup other than regular beef pho. The soup base is so bomb, not much MSG. Personally I don't really order beef pho anymore so I wouldn't know how their regular pho tastes like. And I only order pho ga from Turtle tower now, so I won't be a judge for that either. \n\nThe area.... hmm it is in the center of Tenderloin but so are most of amazing vietnamese spots.

There is NOTHING else that compares to a good bowl of Bun Bo Hue, Hu Tieu, Bun Rieu or Pho when the weather is cold.  I found that it was the only place open and within quick walking distance from Lower Nob Hill and thought I'd give it a go.  \n\nIt was funny that the server who was on break, was actually eating a bowl of Bun Bo Hue.  I opted for that after seeing the yelp pics of it.  Pretty close to what you might find on the streets of Vietnam I'll be honest and the service was just as quick too.  Probably took less than 8 minutes from the order in the kitchen.  I was also sitting right next to this dutch door they use as a order pickup window.  \n\nThe Bun Bo Hue, spicy red chili flake goodness.  I was coughing from the spicy broth after sipping it for taste.  The quality of the dark beef cuts are the best you'll find around.  Fresh and soft to the bite.  One of the best components of the soup.  Don't forget to throw the mint leaves and bean sprouts in your soup!  Cools it down and adds some light texture of flavor to it.  I got one blood block and one fatty pig knuckle which is a MUST in Bun Bo Hue.  Didn't add any sauces except for squeezes of lemon throughout eating it.  \n\nIt is a tiny joint but was not overcrowded when I came in.  Everyone complimented the food on their way out while I was eating.  The family or people who run the places are very nice and gave some steamed rice to a homeless guy who stumbled in drunk when I was there.

So first off, kudos to them!\n\nThe BBH is very affordable (~$8/small). My friend was explaining how it takes a day to brew the broth, and my other friend tasted his bowl and promptly said \"This doesn't taste like it took a day.\" The broth is pretty flavorless if you really concentrate on it; it tastes like they dumped a lot of spices/oil on top right before they serve it to you. The noodles are strangely overcooked, as if they've been frozen too long and then boiled as long as possible.\n\nWe also shared an order of summer rolls (~$7.50/three). I know these rolls are always a rip off at Vietnamese restaurants, but this was actually ridiculous. I felt like I was eating mouthfuls of iceberg lettuce and bean sprouts... and that's it.

I was told they might not have any and she'd go check. Came back, nope, no egg rolls. I had been checking the menu quick to figure out another option in case they didn't have them, so I said I'd have the vegetarian pot stickers. Guess what? Not available either! What. This kinda tells me that they don't make these fresh at all, they're pre-prepped or frozen. Ugh. Ok, so I ordered the fresh tofu spring rolls. They had that, so great.\n\nSecond, and this is where I got really frustrated, was the food came out very staggered. The meat spring rolls came out first, followed by the duck salad, both of which were for one of our party. Next came the soup for someone else. After about 5 minutes, the pork/rice dish came out. Which left mine last... the non-cooked tofu spring rolls. Those took at least 10 minutes, if not 15, before they arrived, after everyone else was at least half-way through their meal (I didn't want anyone waiting on it).

It took a while to get the food, unlike other pho restaurants where your food comes out instantly so you know they're cooking with some TLC!

I'll start by saying this is a lovely nice clean place with friendly staff. Vietnamese is one of my favourite cuisines, and I say you can always judge a Vietnamese by it's regular pho. So I ordered Pho Tai and a side of pot stickers... First of all the pot stickers were just deep fried and had lost all the flavour and when my pho arrived there was some kind of white meat in it, I kindly advised that this was not beef and was told it is 'rare beef' like I was some kind of idiot who didn't know what rare beef looked like.. The broth was bland, had been heavily seasoned with God knows what and I had to add a lot of sriracha to make it taste ok. I picked out all the 'rare beef! And ate the noodles & broth!

And you know what you usually get in these types of places? \n\nReal, authentic food that is delicious, from humble people at decent prices, that's what! \n\nIf you want pomp and circumstance, chi-chi decor and crowds, fancy fruit cocktails, drunk hotties in cocktail dresses or hipsters trying to make the scene, do not come here!  \n\nIn fact, most of that superficial stuff is found after dark, and this restaurant, being truly family run, is only open from 10am to 6pm, and only 10am to 3pm on Sundays! \n\nThe other thing you will find here? Working class Vietnamese and some Chinese. I was the only Low Fan (outsider) in this place for lunch (well it is tiny, with only about 7 tables, but still!) and probably the only one all this week.  \n\nThe outside is tattered and torn, and could pass for a contractor's storage locker. Inside, it looks like it used to be a bathroom or kitchen, as there is old funky tile on the walls. And the tiny kitchen where they make all this good food, is only slightly bigger than a walk-in closet, with one refrigerator and a small stove. \n\nThey serve \"Dac Biet Thuc An Hue\" which is specials from Hue in central Vietnam. That means their number 1 listed dish is Bun Bo Hue, the famous hearty, spicy soup from Hue. But they have a very large menu for a very small place, and offer Pho, Bun, Com Dia, Com Chien, and even Canh Chua soup. \n\nThey also offer a couple of things that are slightly harder to find. \nA. Banh Xeo, the half moon crepe I like.\nB. Banh U'ot..which is thick rice noodle wrap stuffed with meats, from the south of Vienam.  \nC. Dry style Hu Tieu, or Hu Tieu Kho Ngoc Mai, or their special version .\n\nI tried C, the dry Hu Tieu, which Da Lat Restaurant near San Jose State  is famous for serving. \n\nHu Tieu is also a noodle dish, and the regular kind is sort of like a Pho soup with broth, and typically with seafood and pork. The dry type is served with none or very little standing broth initially, and is served with a side bowl of  usually chicken broth with green onions. Inside the main bowl, Ngoc Mai served it with shrimp, pork slices, cross-hatched squid bodies, chicken, chopped greens, and a handful of peanuts, all sitting atop the rice noodles, in a puddle of savory, hearty broth.\n\nYou can eat it like it was served, sort of halfway between a wet bowl of Pho (but with different ingredients) and a dry plate of Bun (vermicelli noodles). But I pour the chicken broth in and eat. Yum! You do get a lemon wedge and some sliced jalapenos to add to it, and you could add Hoisin and Sriracha, but they are not necessary and would ruin the flavor.\n\nNgoc Mai also serves you hot tea when you sit down, and the 3 people working are all very nice, but not talkative. They acknowledge you and say thank you. \n\nHu Tieu Kho Ngoc Mai and tea was a little more than $7 after tax.

Seriously?\n\nI'd probably give Ngoc Mai a lower rating if not for the fact that eating there reminded me - for the first time since moving away from Socal - of dining in those dirty hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese places in the Little Saigon district in Orange County.

The storefront's aged and homey, like someplace in south Vietnam.  It's a small family style restaurant; a place that has no table seat under 4 people, with two long picnic style tables in the center.  A half door leads to the kitchen area on the left when you enter, so if you're friendly enough you can simply tell the cook what you want yourself.\n\ni've only eaten my signature meal here one time, (pho tai nam/gau with steak on the side and a lemonade) but the beef was fresh and very tasty.  The broth, albeit a bit watery, had a nice kick of white pepper and a lot of home-style original flavors-- the star anise really was noticeable, while lighter flavors of licorices and cumin took a pleasant stance off to the wayside of center stage.  A lot of Vietnamese places forgo using licorice altogether, so that by itself warrants this place a 4 star review at the least. I think Ngoc in Vietnamese means water so the name of the restaurant suits their pho broth fittingly. Very light and clean with no added msg. It rivals my wife's pho broth.  Adding lime juice and garlic-chili pepper oil mix like I normally do actually ruined it a bit.\n\nSo why the half star? The service was really really refreshing.  For some reason, most of the places where I go, the person who serves you looks and acts like they just lost a fight that involved a yelling contest. The woman who served me was very pleasant and attentive and even had sense enough as a server to ask if I wanted ice water or hot tea.  Going by the conversation the other patrons where having, the Bun Bo Hue is their signature meal to try.\n\nWhy not a 5 star review?  Although I know they have it if I had asked for it (since it was available in other dishes on the menu), pho with brisket or flank was not on the menu.  This place is also just a TAD on the expensive side, at 10.00 for a regular bowl with extra meat. Also, a side bowl of hot broth for steak on the side orders was not provided.", "author": "Rich H."}

Their crepes are also great, with the right texture and crunch.   I really can't comment on the rest of their menu which I find is subpar compared to their #3.   Also, everything is made to order so it's super easy to order almost everything without cilantro!  Score!\n\nMy only real complaint about this place is that they close early (considering the sketchy people that hang out on that corner, I can't really blame them) and they always take a month off every year for vacation.

It's a dirty, hole in the wall place, equipped with outdated furniture and tableware, which really just adds to the authenticity of the place.  You really do feel like you just stepped out of the TL and into Vietnam, but without the unbearable heat and having to eat your sweat as it drips into your food because you know that even if you were to wipe it, it would start dripping again and any extra movement in this kind of heat is really unnecessary.\n\nThis place offers a variety of genuine Vietnamese dishes that you usually don't find anywhere else, however, the only thing I order here is the Bun Bo Hue which is a spicy beef noodle soup.  Rarely will you find this item in any restaurant and even if you should be so lucky, it will never taste as good as this place.  They have this dish down.

With its tiled walls, fluorescent lighting (well not entirely positive as it was the middle of sunny day, but I imagine it probably was), various knick knacks on the wall, and kitchen tucked in the back, this place had the look and smells of a place you may very well find in 'Nam. Okay, well I've never been to Vietnam. But I have eaten at places that looked like this in other parts of Asia, so I am imagining it is what a restaurant over there could look like.\n\nThe menu (which oddly looks like a DVD case) has a large number of selections. I settled on some known constants for comparison: pho ga and bahn xeo. \n\nThe pho ga was mediocre at best.  The broth was light and slightly sweet. Some of the noodles were mottled with a strange color. The chicken was slightly dry. In the end, the broth proved to be too light and sweet for my tastes. I did not even finish it.\n\nThe bahn xeo was also a bit of a disappointment. The crepe was completely crispy (not light and airy on the inside) and incredibly oily. Cutting through it literally shattered the pancake. The filling was also relatively flavorless.\n\nIf you're into the Vietnamese iced coffee that is dripped ... this is not the place for you. It's mixed behind the counter from pre-made coffee.\n\nOn the upside, the people working there are incredibly nice.", "author": "Mobile B."}

Otherwise prepared to be waiting outside for awhile as there is only one person who is the waitress, server and cleans all the tables. Inside you'll be able to see the kitchen where the rest of the family operates between 2-3 refrigerators full of individually prepared meats and veggies that were pre-cut and stored for cooking. The noodles there are fantastic - you can request what type you like (wide rice noodles, thin rice noodles, egg noodles, etc) so make sure you ask for the kind you prefer. The beef noodle soup had a fantastic homemade taste and the lighter (by comparison) bun rue was full of crab and tomatoes.YUM!!!

I feel like i've tried every place in the TL that yelp has suggested and every place seems to serve Bun Bo Hue differentely. \n\nI came here with the bf last week around 2pm on a monday. Parking was easy, there's 2hr free parking in the front. The place was empty, missing the lunch crowed i assume. The menu is quite large here but the one thing i was here was for their Bun Bo Hue. #1 i believe. We ordered 2 bowls extra spicy. (after reading yelp reviews i remembered some ppl saying its not that spicy so ask for extra spicy). Waited maybe about 10 minutes and we were served. The bowl was large but where was all the noodles? and no cabbage? The broth was some what ok. It lacks the aroma taste of lemongrass and the the sweetness of the broth. Something just wasn't right and we left hungry and disappointed. The price seems reasonable i think it less than $7 a bowl but not enough food or at least for us not enough noodles.

Guess i was expecting to be blown away by the much more authentic version, but sadly, that was not the case. The crepe was not uniformly crispy, the shrimp still had their tails on, and the rest of the innards, though tasty were not what I had been hoping for.\nDid not try anything else, though I could see the noodles in the pho were of the broader variety, leading me to think perhaps this was Northern Vietnam style, and perhaps that accounted for the difference in the crepe?\nThe service was pleasant and efficient, and I would give it another try should I be in the area.", "author": "Carla B."}
