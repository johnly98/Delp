For a party of 4 (3 guys) with no left overs, it was about $100 for 6 dishes:\n\n1. Twice Cooked Pork - my fav dish out of the 6\n2. Szechuan Spices Spare Ribs - second fav dish\n3. Sauteed Eel strips - least favorite, no flavor, not to crazy about the slimey texture either \n4. Shanghai Style Shrimp - ehh.. not much flavor \n5. Shredded Tofu dish - pretty good\n6. Fish and mushroom dish - just alright.. kind of bland. \n\n It's an average food place, and the serving sizes are pretty small. I probably would not come back here again or ever crave their food.", "author": "Leah A."}

I found this place on accident, once the Korean place I like across the street seems to be closed down. The hot and sour soup is awesome, not too hot or too sour with a very deep rich broth that makes it one of the best hot and sour soup I've ever tasted! \n\nBoth times I've been here I ordered the spicy house chicken, and it is very good with black mushrooms.  The lunch specials cost about six dollars and range up to nine dollars at most. The service is typical to Chinese restaurants, spotty at times, but that's OK. Come here for the hot and sour soup alone, and you end up ordering several things off the menu. Will be back soon to explore the menu, and provide an update.", "author": "Marlon T."}

The dishes that I really enjoy is the chicken salad and their Hong Kong style crispy noodles. I ordered take-out the other day and tried their Mandarin Chicken which was really good as well!\n\nIf you eat in, it's always the usual same two people. The nice lady and the server which looks like a big old bear that you can't understand. All I ever understand from him is when he says \"you want rice?\" other than that, it sounds like jibberish but its ok.\n\nWhen ordering take-out, normally you would expect to get rice for free (It is an Chinese place isn't it?), but no, they actually charge for rice! As being Chinese myself I think that is ridiculous. I think that was the only down side. Other than that, I recommend just eating at the restaurant itself. \n\nDon't forget, if you order out and order $15 bucks or more, I believe they give you a free chicken salad with their coupons on the take-out menu. They're not going to tell you about that so remember to look at the take-out menu first. \n\nAnother thing weird about this place is that they have two separate menus. One for the Chinese people with their \"special\" stuff and a separate one for tourist. I don't understand why they need to do that but I find it annoying when they automatically stereotype me and give me the Chinese menu which I find very confusing. You'll understand what I mean when you see it yourself. \n\nThe other menu is definitely much easier to order from because they split all the entrees into categories such as poultry, seafood, pork, beef, vegetables, etc.", "author": "Mona C."}

This is most likely the worst Chinese food i have EVER come across living 18 years in Sam Francisco. For Non-Bay Area people, this restaurant might not be bad, in fact, it might even come off as being delicious and authentic! But in comparison to the other Asian restaurants in San Francisco, eating here wasn't an enjoyable experience, The SOLE reason we came here was because we were being treated-but never again.\n\nThe waitresses and waiters were quite nice, but the restaurant was poorly lit and the menus were pretty old and grimy.\n\nThis is what we had:\n\nShanghai Tofu Thizad Soup - The soup was probably my favorite part of the meal. The broth itself was quite tasty, but the presentation itself was horrible. Taste definitely outweighed appearance in this case. It was definitely not something you would order if you saw it; it looked like it was a bunch of leftover dishes thrown into a soup and served on the spot.\n\nPotstickers - Reading positive reviews on Yelp, I was a bit excited to try it, but my hopes were crushed as I had my first bite. Burnt. The insides weren't that bad, but the rest were soggy, not crispy at all! Bad move.\n\nShanghai Dumplings (XLB) - in XLB, you're usually looking for a paper thin dumpling with luscious juicy meat inside. Here, the peel was CHEWY. Like gum. Not thin at all! And there was no \"soup\" in the dumpling either. Disappointed.\n\nPrawns with Green Soy Beans - Initially, these were quite good, but as time went on, the oiliness got to me. There was this awful shininess to them. It looked like someone had literally took this dish tossed it in oil.\n\nShanghai Style Meatballs - These weren't that bad. The meat was quite tender, but mouth was wanting something more. It left me thinking about what it was missing rather than me enjoying it.\n\nBean Curd Sheet with Greens - Tofu didn't seem edible. It was rock hard! No comment.\n\nShredded Pork with Yellow Chives and Tofu - Took one bite and set it down. Too oily and fake. Enough said.\n\nCome here only if there is a world apocalypse and you happen to be craving Chinese food.

From my experiences, I think Peking had OK ones. I mean, the skin wasn't too thick or too thin, but the thinner the better. The soup inside these little treasures are THE most important. The soup in the ones here weren't as flavorful as I wanted them to be, but for some place in the sunset, I'd come back! Saves me a trip to c-town! In addition to the regular ones, the crab ones were pretty tasty too. The crab meat I expected were softer but it's alright. If I were to choose to order the regular or crab ones next time, it'll definitely be the regular ones.\n\nOnion pancakes are one of my fav dishes....the ones here were a little disappointing. Just a tad too oily....but it was cripsy. I think the ones I prefer would be thinner and flakier. \n\nThe sizzling soup was delish...good amounts of veggies and scallops. Maybe just a bit on the salty side, but not bad. A good soup to try out!\n\nLast, the Chef's chicken with basil. It came wrapped in foil. You open it up, and the strong scent of basil and spices come out. Yum!! They use white meat chicken, so that's a super plus for me! It wasn't too spicy, but it was perfect for some weaksauce I was sitting across from.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-07", "description": "In the same way that you expect lobsters from Maine, steak from Texas and clam chowder from Boston, China is packed with a plethora of different localized of cuisines.  If you want some authentic Shanghainese food, this is the place to go.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the culture in Shanghai is completely different from that of Taiwan or Hong Kong.  And while most people in Shanghai speak Mandarin, most are bilingual and speak Shanghainese, a local dialect that's so different that it's unintelligible to people that speak either Cantonese or Mandarin.\n\nNow, I'm not an expert on Chinese cuisine, but I do know that if you order your Mongolian beef and kung pao chicken here you're completely missing out on the experience.  Reading reviews like, \"This is the most authentic General Tso's Chicken that I've ever had!\" make me cringe.\n\nI came here with my mom and my sister for a quiet family dinner.  According to my mom (who's originally from Shanghai), Peking Restaurant recently hired a new Shanghainese chef.  She had no problem speaking to the host and the waitress in Shanghainese.  (Even though I can't understand a lick of it, it's not everyday I get to see my parents speaking to strangers in Shanghainese.  When I was backpacking through Europe, I remember my ears perking up every time I heard somebody speaking American English, it was an immediate and familiar touchstone.  I'm sure for my parents, even though they've been living here for the past forty years or so, it must be the same way for them when they hear somebody speaking Shanghainese.)\n\nSo what's good here?  I'm pretty squeamish when it comes to particular foods, even still, the fish head soup was really good.  Savory broth with chunks of white fish meat served family style.  Delicious.  And while I didn't see any fish head itself, I'm sure the $20 price is enough to scare most people away.\n\nOf course, there are two of my favorites, the siu long bow and the Shanghainese noodles.  Siu long bow is a Shanghainese style dumpling that's filled with a pork filling and steaming broth.  When you eat it, you want to be careful not to pop it and let it spill all over your plate, otherwise you've missed out on what makes the dish so special.  And for a small restaurant on Noriega street, the siu long bow here was surprisingly good.  Shanghainese fried noodles are always good.  The egg noodles are thicker than your average noodle, and are fried with soy sauce and a little bit of pork.  Sure it's packed with lots of starch and lots of oil, but it's damn good.\n\nAfter our meal, the chef came out to greet us with some free desert on the house--a nice touch for a neighborhood establishment.  If you're interested in trying out some good Shanghainese food, give Peking restaurant a shot.  Just ask for a few recommendations before you cave in and order the shrimp fried rice, OK?", "author": "Tony L."}

The vinegar that came with these was a little sweet.  We probably should have added soy sauce from our table.\n\nPot Stickers:  Crispy!  I loved how the skin was not too thick.  The meat inside was okay.\n\nSnow Cabbage & Pork w/ Rice Cakes:  Not a very large plate, but very tasty.  The snow cabbage was fresh, not the preserved kind.  Plus, there were juicy black mushrooms too.  Didn't appear particularly oily.  Probably my favorite dish of the meal.\n\nShanghai-Style Clay Pot: Basically, a clay pot of rice cooked with fatty pork and veggies.  A little bit on the salty side, and we had to pick out the fatty pork.\n\nThe names of these dishes are a little different because some of these items are not on the take-out menu!  I usually like to grab one as a reference, but it didn't do me much good this time.  \n\nYes, most of the other patrons in the restaurant did not appear to be Chinese.  And the tea was just a tea bag in water.  But we picked out a few of the Northern Chinese dishes and were actually quite pleased with the end result.

The primary reason was that I had brought a credit card and most of the places around took cash only or a different type of cc.\n\nThe staff here was extremely nice.  We had three different people waiting on us, which made everything very efficient and pleasing to my serving days of time past.\n\nThe first dish we ordered was the Seaweed Egg Flower soup.  When they brought it out, it looked amazing.  The taste, however, was a little lacking.  It really didn't set a good first impression as I noticed the peas had seemingly come from a frozen bag and the mushrooms were just slightly gritty, but overall it wasn't bad.  \n\nThe next dish, the Hong Kong style crispy noodles were really good.  I actually enjoyed these a lot.  It had plenty of meat and vegetables on top of the very crispy noodles.  This certainly set a better tone with me.  Peking beef came out next.  I've never really noticed any adverse effects to eating MSG, but I'm sure it was in the food.  Still, how can you give up a great dish just because of the umami components?  The beef was perfectly light crisp-fried and had garlic, green onions, and ginger--all of which I'm a major fan!  This really hit the spot with me.  It certainly ended my dining experience well.\n\nAll-in-all this isn't a bad little joint.  It certainly wasn't the busiest on the block, which leads me to believe I may want to come back and check out those places as well, but this place was fine in its own right.", "author": "Brent A."}

How sad.\n\nLet's step back for a moment.  I started coming here ten years ago, and the place never disappointed.  On the outside, it's your typical Chinese restaurant with your usual decor and your usual fish tanks.  \n\nHowever, if you dig a little deeper, you'd find out something else.  It's the kind of place where the owners, a.k.a. the waiter and the waitress, are always nice, helpful, friendly and even funny.  It's the kind of place where I used to tip even when I got takeout because I wanted to be nice.  It's the kind of place where the hot and sour soup is so good, my dad swears it has the ability to cure a cold.\n\nAll the food here is good, but not spectacular.  Peking restaurant had only one signature dish worth trying - Peking beef.  It was my favorite thing to order here; one might even call it my guilty pleasure.  Today my two friends and I went to Peking for a late lunch/early dinner.  We ordered some appetizers while I was waiting for my Peking beef.\n\nWhen my dish came, I noticed that something wasn't quite right.  My dish looked . . . different.  I am not sure whether they changed the chef or otherwise messed with near perfection, but it wasn't the Peking beef of yore.   It was a greasier, fatter, blander, doughier version of the dish I had grown to love.  I was so shocked and disappointed, even the crispy rice noodles didn't cheer me up.\n\nI never thought I'd say this, but I don't think I have a reason to come back to Peking.  The fortune cookie, however, was dead on.  It promised me a \"pleasant journey to a faraway destination\" right after I booked a trip to the East Coast.  How did they know???", "author": "Yan G."}

All the traditional vegetable dishes, slow cooked soups are delicious.  Must order the Wu Xi spareribs, and the hot n sour soup here is the BEST you'll have anywhere.

But one waitress-owner is just (an octave) way too loud and high pitched; I guess that is what one reviewer earlier described as \"paranoid.\"  Sometimes there is a young girl in her 20's (owner's daughter) with long hair who I counted touched her hair 14 times in two minutes during order-taking for just two customers. \n\nThere is a local health law governing restuarants saying each time an employee touches the hair he/she is supoosed to wash the hands.", "author": "Eric L."}

The food here is one of the best in the sunset district.  I've tried several.  I recommend the Sesame Chicken which isn't on the menu.  My second choice is the Walnut Prawns.  Ask for extra sauce. Nancy is very kind and so are the rest of the staff.  Maybe they are nicer to me because I frequent here several times a month.  When friends from out of town come to visit, Peking is always their request.  It's a great place with children.  Last night I spent $80.00 which included dinner for eight, tip, drinks, 9 dishes and food left over to go.  This is my choice.  Parking is a pain, but if you double park in front while the rest of your party goes in to get seated, almost always someone walks out and a space is available.  That's the trick!", "author": "Ramon W."}

Had their mu-shu vegetable dish, the pancakes could use a little work, but the veggie part was pretty delicious. We had some mao pa tofu; made with a simple sauce but still had good portions of ground pork, pretty good too. I'd go back if I was in the area.", "author": "Jaejean K."}

As a Chinese, I like this place because it reminded me hometown. But all what I can remember about this place is salt, salt and salt....", "author": "Vat S."}

It is a very clean restaurant and everyone on the staff has a smile.  Terrific lunch menu at a very reasonable price.", "author": "Aaron M."}

He said that he had eaten at many Chinese places around the US, Canada, and throughout Asia and he said that the chef here is outstanding. I fell in love with this place right away and can't find a better Chinese restaurant anywhere in the bay area. It's not fancy or trendy, but the food is amazing. Sure I've had off meals, but for the most part it's consistently great. My wife and all of her family also come here. My sister in law went to Paris and was taken to this trendy new, highly rated Eurasian fusion restaurant. After spending over $100.00 per person she said that Peking was way better. Try the Pot stickers, the chicken salad, onion pancakes, the combo chow mein or combo fried rice. The best hot and sour , won ton, and sizzling rice soups on the planet, (his broth makes all the difference in the world). The garlic chicken, and kung pao chicken the Mongolian beef, mango beef and the Sze-chuan prawns are all unique and all incredibly good. I can go on and on about their wonderful dishes. I've honestly looked for over 20 years to find a better and closer Chinese restaurant to my house in San Ramon, but you simply can't beat Peking. John the owner is a master trained chef, and his wife and staff are so warm and friendly and always remember me, my wife and kids by name. I really, really love this place.", "author": "Johny A."}
