{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-03", "description": "*3.5 Stars*\n\nCan you say: diiiiiiive?! Gimme some of THAT right quick! The Hyde Out is literally a great place to \"hide out\" and just chill and maybe catch a game or two. It's practically hidden on the corner of Hyde Street and California in the Nob Hill district. \n\nThere's nothing fancy about this spot and that's exactly why I dig it! Low key, not too crowded (except for on big game day nights) with a local crowd and super down to earth bartenders. And did I mention that the drinks  are cheap? Oh yeah... that's ALWAYS a winner in my book! And, they aren't watered down either. You will definitely get a bang for your buck. \n\nThe bar itself is long and narrow with plenty of seats and a few TV's that hang in the corners. There's also an upstairs area, but we haven't yet gone up there. Most of the people who come here are locals and regulars but they are very welcoming and a few of them will really have you cracking up at their jokes! \n\nAlthough I enjoyed myself while I was there, a few things are keeping me from giving them a higher rating. First, they are cash only! BOO HOO! I have to say that I truly despise cash only businesses. I understand the concept but then again... I kind of don't. Secondly, that bathroom... let's just say it ain't the prettiest. I know,  I know...  it's a \"DIVE\". Buuut, that don't mean y'all can't fix up that bathroom one time! I mean damn! I would hate to see what that bathroom looks like on a game night....\n\nAside from those nuisances, I really dig this bar. It's a great a little hidden gem in the area to chill out and have a nice drink. If you're in the area and are looking for something low key, I would recommend it. Just make sure you bring cash and try to use the bathroom BEFORE you get there.", "author": "Shayla B."}

I suppose this is Nob Hill's Dive-Bar.\n\nI've lived a block away for two years and just around to going about a month ago.  Football Sunday.  They open at 10am on Sundays, have about good TV's, and the crowd was full of folks from all over.  (I won't hold the fact that there were a lot of Eagles fans against the bar...  JK ;) )  I've been coming back for more football, a few evenings, and a little NYE last night.\n\nGreat location - Hyde/California.  As a space, it's a cool lay-out.  Nice little nook upstairs and a fairly long bar.  The bartendresses have all been super-cool along the way.  All compliments in that regards.  Drinks - nothing outrageously different, but solid beers on tap.  Happy hour discounts help.  I believe 4-7pm.  $1 off beers.  Usually I don't do a lot of shots (although anyone from this place would think I do), but it's been perfectly reasonable to buy a few rounds for folks I've met along the way.\n\nWhich brings me to why this place is really 5-star:  The folks.  Cool people.  I have met a lot of people along the way.  Interesting, smart people.  Not all saints.  Not degenerates, either.  Well...  One or two.  Interesting stories.  Plenty of classy 20/30-somethings who are reasonably successful SF future mid-upper-class (well, anywhere else - this neck-o'-the-woods, middlist-class).  But, plenty of the crew that's lived on Nob Hill for years, going back to SF was just a little more down home.

I am a Seattle native living in the Bay Area for a few years now & I love it here. After the Seahawks win against the 49ers, my girlfriend & I bar hopped to celebrate our team. Dressed in our team colors we walked into The Hyde-out. We were immediately yelled at & cursed at by a few men in Niners shirts sitting at the end of the bar. Due to their aggression, we turned around & walked out. While outside deciding where to go, 2 of the men followed us out & began harassing us. The 1st man got in our faces, yelled at us about the Seahawks, called us bitches, & threatened us physically. At that point one of the bartenders came outside & asked US to leave & told us she would call the police. She informed us that these men were the bars \"regulars\" & \"it would be best if you just leave.\"  We were speechless. Meanwhile the man is still yelling & cursing at us. We walked away & turned the corner up California St. where the 2nd man was standing, out of sight initially. We walked past him & he began to continue with the threats of violence & physical intimidation by getting in our faces. Both of these men were much bigger than us. At that point a second bartender came out & told us to leave (which is all we were doing since we left the bar on our own accord) She told us the same thing as the first bartender. The men were their regulars & it would be best if we just go. She then offered us free drinks & a hook up on another night if we would just leave. Clearly I will never go to this bar again.

And yes, I stuffed the glass in my purse and it fit. :D\n\nGreat views upstairs of Nob Hill and it had a fireplace too (though I'm not convinced it worked since it didn't look connected to anything).

Two of my friends showed up after the first round and remember seeing cash on the bar in front of me and the person who showed up with me, but we were charged for this.  Additionally, we were charged for a set of kamikazes we did not ask for which the bartender wanted to \"share\" with us.  After taking shots with us, the bartender's response to my protest of the bill was:\n\n  \"I have not been drinking.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that you should not be drawn to this place because of the sign which says it has free wireless internet, because you will be lucky to get that working for 3 minutes out of 3 hours.  They have unconfigured retail network equipment whose signal is fighting with one of their residential neighbors, and when I offered to fix it they simply shrugged.\n\nCome if you will, pay for each drink and don't let the bartender be \"friendly\" by keeping a tab open for you in their head, don't accept the free shots, and don't feed quarters into that juke which just asks for a quarter at a time until it is \"satisfied\".", "author": "Justin R."}

A big fan of this place for the following reasons:\n\n- Great beer selection\n- Wonderful and cozy upstairs\n- Internet Jukebox\n- They have board games that you can borrow and play at the bar\n\nCarrie C. just had her birthday party here last Saturday and got to see why this place is one of her favorite neighborhood dive bars. Her party was upstairs where they were playing scrabble. I found out that the board belonged to the bar. That's something so cute! It's not the first time I've heard of something like that - it's just the first time that I've encountered that sort of down home neigborhood hospitality in a while. The bar also has a few good TV sets and would be a great place to go to watch a major TV program or sports game with a crowd. I'm thinking of coming back here to watch the presidential debates - because this is the sort of place that can take care of all of your needs without the expensive price tag you might encounter at a fancier bar trying to be all things to all sorts of people. I like Hyde Out best because it's just trying to do one thing really well such as create the perfect spot for a someone to go and grab a drink. \n\nOne last thing: You do need to remember to bring cash", "author": "Laura G."}

Other people on here are saying it has a great view...I guess it's okay. Nothing really to look at except people and CALA's grocery store (which brings the neighborhood down a notch.) Good place to sit if you want to people watch. \n\nOther people on here have said that the bartender is super nice. We had a women bartender and she was just okay. Nothing special. She didn't smile or anything when one of us mentioned how hot it was today. \n\nThe beer selection is, again, just okay. Didn't see any Belgians (not counting Stella) or anything super interesting. But then again, I'm used to going to beer bars and, of course, this isn't a beer bar. \n\nMy girlfriend got a vodka tonic and it was a huge and strong vodka tonic. This may be a good starter place.

My favorite place is the upstairs which is a great vantage point to watch folks walk about California, in and out of Cala Foods, and getting off and on the Trolly Cars.  Decently priced beers and cocktails, but the jukebox is kind of a rip off even though the song selection is huge.  Also, it's right next to Golden Horse Chinese food, which, in my opinion, is some of the best Chinese food I've had in a long time.

But oh well. I stop by here after I get off work late at night probably way more than is necessary. The bartender is the sweetest, she knows exactly I want every time, sometimes even better than I do. \"Looks like a hard night, girl. A shot for you.\" Who am I to deny a shot, even if it comes on the pretense that I look ridiculously tired/like crap. Anyway, thankfully no one thinks its weird that I like to come and drink by myself....but I never end the night by myself (no, not like that). I've met some really awesome people here, everyone wants to strike up a conversation, and there's a general laid-back and friendly vibe.. Cash only, remember that.

Though some might consider it a dive bar, it's definitely on the upper echelon as opposed to dive bars in the Mission.  Perhaps it's cuz it's in Nob Hill . . . Anyhow, the HydeOut is a great place to come in, grab a beer/cocktail, and chill.  On a Friday or Saturday night, it might get a little louder and rowdier but it's still pretty low key.  The new jukebox also lets you find some random tunes to rock out to.  The bartenders are some good-looking ladies and provide great service.  Soon enough, even if you don't come in all that often, they'll know you by name and drink.  Drinks are moderately priced and made stiff.  Only thing to this place is it is CASH ONLY, with of course the conveniently placed ATM inside in case you need more moola.", "author": "George J."}

It's usually a good mix of friendly locals and people from other neighborhoods looking to hang out and chill or maybe get a little crazy.\n\nThe bartenders are good looking, friendly, and make tasty drinks at neighborhood bar prices (try the \"Space Pussy\"). Again, the bartenders here always fun!\n\nThey have an Internet jukebox to play your favorite jams and a huge flat screen TV to watch sports.
