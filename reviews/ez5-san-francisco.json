He gave me 5-6 suggestions (outside the norm of Dada, 111 Minna, Eve, and 183 Proof) with EZ5 being one of them.\n\nAt first glance of his text message, I was thinking, \"WTH is EZ5?!?!\" Although my friend mentioned that EZ5 is crackin' on Thursdays and Fridays, we decided to take a chance and come here for HH on Wednesday, January 12th. \n\nEZ5 is tucked away in an alley (across from R&G Lounge) that separates Chinatown and FIDI. From the outside, one would think that EZ5 belongs in the outskirts of the Sunset or Richmond Area with the opaque orange tinted windows with black paw prints and bright fluorescent signage.\n\nD R I N K S:\nHH is Monday - Friday, 4 PM-8 PM. Beer and wine are $3/glass. Regular cocktails are $7-9 depending on your liquor selection. $20 minimum for CC's.\n\nI had a Hendrick's Tonic ($9) and a Tanqueray Tonic ($7 - made by accident) both of which were STRONG! *happy dance*\n\nThe bartender was very friendly. It was a slow last night and she went around asking people if they needed another around which was nice of her. \n\nC R O W D:\nThe crowd was mixed and pretty chill for Wednesday HH; young professionals in their 20s, corporate banker types, some tourists and ones who seem to be \"regulars\".\n\nBased on other Yelpers' reviews, I can imagine the crowd being predominately Asian on Friday and Saturday nights. \n\nM U S I C:\nOther than Mercury Lounge, EZ5 is the only bar/lounge that plays Top 40s, Hip Hop, and R&B during HH which is HUGEEEE plus in my book! There are resident DJs on Tuesdays (all genres), Thursdays (Hip Hop, R&B & Old School), Fridays (Hip Hop & R&B) and Saturdays (Hip-Hop & R&B). Monday is Karaoke night. \n\nThat night, we met Benson who helps DJ from time to time. He was really nice, encouraged requests from us and even brought us to the meet the couple that owns EZ5. I'm normally the buzzed one running up to the DJ every SINGLE weekend screaming, \"CAN YOU PLAY STEREO LOVEEEEE PUH-LEASE???\" This time I wasn't drunk AND I didn't even have to get up because Benson was nice enough to come and ask what we wanted to hear.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R:\nUpon walking into EZ5, I didn't know what to make of the d\u00e9cor. It was eclectic and funky; tangerine walls, colorful random hand paintings, tchotchkes hanging on the walls, a 70s disco ball and tacky foil garland draping the ceiling posts.\n\nThere's seating for 10-12 at the bar, 3 booths, and large square ottomans between the bar and the booths. \n\nThe music was the perfect volume; loud enough to make you want to bob your head, but not loud to the point where you have to scream across the room (like other bars/lounges) just so the person next to you can hear you.  \n\nOther Yelpers mentioned a dance floor? If they clear out the center ottomans, there is a large pathway to the restroom between the bar and the booths, but I wouldn't exactly call that a dance floor per say. There's also a small space in front of the DJ booth, the size of a cubicle which I guess others are referring to as the \"dance floor\"? Well in any event, when you're drunk anywhere can be your dance floor right? Gawd knows when I am, I turn the couches in the clubs to \"my\" dance floor. :X\n\nP A R K I N G:\nOn weekdays, easy metered parking before 6 PM (at the 4-6 PM tow away zone). These spots are taken very quickly, so get there by 5:45 PM to snag a space and then sit in your car until 6 PM. \n\nOn the weekends after 10 PM, street parking is relatively easy to find as most neighboring businesses have closed by then. \n\nIf you can't find street parking, The Portsmouth Square Garage is located a block away on Kearny/Washington streets and the rate is $3/hour. \n\nThe funky ambiance and d\u00e9cor aside, I really like EZ5 for a HH spot with awesome music. I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK!!!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It was happy hour, so most drinks were only $3, good value!

Keep in mind this is coming from a career non-drinker who just so happens to hang out with a lot of party peeps. And both ends of the spectrum - from the crazy party animals to the prudies like me agree - EZ5 hits the spot! Every single birthday party from my circle of friends and associates always ends up here as the final stop to cap off the evening, and for good reason.\n\nLadies, are you sick of the sleazed out \"dance clubs\" that play nothing but the likes of Souljah Boy, Plies, and whatever else mainstream crap is on the airwaves today? To make matters even worse, the patrons look like they got lost on their way to the \"Growing up Gotti\" lookalike contest, or think they are starring in the latest season of \"The Ultimate Fighter?\" Well, you are in luck, and your salvation goes by the name of EZ5.\n\nNot only does the DJ bypass all of the current mainstream hit pop, but mixes in a good blend of golden era hip hop and gangsta rap, new wave, new jack swing, and even hair metal. Where else can you hear the likes of New Edition, Dove Shack, Bon Jovi, Chi Ali, Stevie B., Debarge, Guns 'n Roses, Positive K, New Order, Pharcyde, Ozzy, and Color Me Badd all back to back? What's more, the DJ's have zero attitude, and are open to requests. They are more equivalent to the downhome DJ's you would find at a house party.\n\nTucked away in a nondescript corner of Chinatown, you would never find EZ5 unless someone brought you here. As a matter of fact, I had been strolling by this very spot ad nauseum since I was a wee lad, and I would never have known there was a bar on this tiny alley. When you first bring your friends here, they will all moan with a collective, \"You have GOT to be KIDDING ME!!!\" when first catching a glimpse of the location, with the low key exterior and circa 70's neon sign. However, once they walk through that hallowed corridor, the party's on!\n\nThe owners are a super cool middle aged Chinese couple, the type whom you would never associate with operating a bar - a kick arse one at that. My group has become quite acquainted with them by now, and they always take good care of us. That's the number one sign of a good bar when the regulars are treated like family. \n\nAbove all, nowhere to be found at EZ5 are the \"Growing Up Daisy\" casting call rejects. Nothing but classy, well-mannered, and typically more educated peeps here. After all, this is where I come, right?  ;-)  Furthermore, unlike most bars/lounges/clubs, which neatly fit into one category or the other, but not all three, EZ5 has a little bit of each. Feel like just chillin' at the bar, but not dancing? Maybe more in the mood to chop it up with your group of ten friends in a booth? Perhaps fancy to shake what yo mama gave ya? Do one, two, or all three simultaneously at the almighty EZ5.\n\nWhen it comes to nightlife in the Bay, there are only two categories in my book. Either it's EZ... or sleazy. The choice is yours.", "author": "Eric W."}

But if you want to go to a bar for the karaoke, this is NOT the place.  The English song list is minimal and the song book is not organized at all.  It took me about 20 minutes to find a song that we saw when we first opened the book after we turned a few pages.  We thought we were going crazy and it actually disappeared from the book!  The \"KJ\" was obviously the owner or a family member. She seemed nice but did not understand or speak any English at all.  She just laughed and nodded whenever I asked her a question.  My daughter asked her if they had \"Before He Cheats\" which is pretty much a karaoke staple and she had no idea if they had it or if it was even a song!  She just kept pointing at the mish-mash song book.  When I finally picked a song, she put it in the machine, handed me the mike, and then proceeded to try to hand some random regular guy at the bar another mike to \"help me sing\".  I was walking out the door before the song even ended only to find myself inundated with skeevy cab drivers waiting to take advantage of this out of towner to get me back to my hotel.  It was a nightmare, truly.  BTW....if you sing here, don't expect to sing your song, they give out mikes to every drunk at the bar to sing with you.  Just a very weird experience.

When a group of four of us went in on a Friday at 5:30 for happy hour it was pretty crowded with no seats (table or bar) in sight.  Standing room only.  We were hoping to imbibe while sitting rather than standing, so we were facing a big dilemma.  As we were scoping the scene, the owner came out of the wood works.  Sensing that we were on the verge of leaving, she came over to us and asked how many we were.  She motioned to some guy who brought us a table and four tiny cushioned stools.  Our hearts were won over.\n\nWe enjoyed a round of $1 jello shots and a few rounds of $3 Sierra's.   And if you sit at a table, a totally efficient cocktail waitress comes around to take your drink order, so you really can just max and relax and your drinking desires will be catered to with the quickness.

I've met so many of my good friends here..and we almost NEVER walk out straight.  Sometimes it could be dead but that's ok.

He can't dance, but he can do the splits!\n\nI'm usually sitting at the bar with my homies drinkin', chillin', and building the occasional \"tower of tips.\" More often than not the female bartenders are cute and fun to flirt with. Annie also makes it a point to introduce the new waitresses to me. That gets 5 stars on effort alone! Got to love the \"motherly asian lady\" stereotype. Kam and Annie always have the place decorated for whatever holiday is coming up and they always have jell-o shots on hand. If you check out the walls you'll also notice that the art work on display, and its always changing too. Classy in a low-key kinda way.\n\nDJ E-Dubb spins on weekends, mostly Fridays now I think.

I know, I know, I'm a pretentious bastard, but please, read on.\n\nEven with my sweet new rectangular piece of technology pointing me to all sorts of spots in walking distance, I couldn't seem to get my ass in a chair and my hand around a glass.

Finally, we decided to ditch the gizmo crutch and follow our gut: we headed up the hill to Chinatown.\n\nBefore we knew it,the glow of neon lights poured out onto the otherwise dark sidewalk in front of us. \"We're going here,\" I said.

Annyway. Lighting was low and sohistique, booths were modern yet comfy. Disco ball was a'spinnin. I ordered a silly drink that doesn't have a name and involves pineapple juice and 2 different liquors, and when the bartender got it wrong the first time, he apologized sincerely and happily made me another one, without charging me extra (whicih would have been appropriate, given the price of the ingredient he left out the first time). The place was pretty dead, but it was a little early for a Saturday. I think it would be a blast with a crowd. I'll definitely be back, and with many friends.\n\nHoping that I don't sound terribly insular, this place was a little bit like walking into a bar in \"Lost in Translation.\" Everything was lovely, but just...different, somehow.

The latter may be a Pro if lounging and enjoying cocktails and chatting up a bit is your tune.\n\nHowever, for a DJ...I would like the notion of having someone actually listen to some of the records I hauled over from San Jose to SF (yes, I still play vinyl and don't reckon I'll be switching anytime soon). Records are heavy man!\n\nAs an audiophile, I feel the soundsystem could get a little more \"oomph\" in terms of bass, but with residents above the bar and nearby, I understand the need to keep \"the peace\" (sorta speak).\n\nI dig some of the concoctions they brew (e.g., The Day Off, Barely Legal, 3 Day Weekend) and the staff are personable. Plus, the PacMan table game!\n\nThe place is more of a Happy Hour lounge and probably sees more action during the week rather than the weekends.\n\nBut what truly makes this joint are the Owners (Annie and Kam).\n\nAfter my first party (Saturday evening) where we ended having a blast playing until 2:30am (yikes...), all our friends were still up for jammin and decided to go to an after-party at the Gingerbread House (in Potrero) to check out some underground that went until 6~7am (double yikes).\n\nAnnie and Kam asked where the place was and I gave em the directions (thinking on how they could possibly ever show up with all the energy spent on their bar that evening).\n\n(flash forward later that next morning at 4am) A friend of mine (while waiting for our drinks at the Gingerbread House) who was at EZ5 earlier asks me, \"Hey, aren't those the Owners at the bar you just played at?\"- sho nuff, it was Annie and Kam slammin some hefty shots with some friends right there!

I've been here twice now- last night and last week; both on a Monday night.\n\nIt was a friend's birthday last night, so we grabbed a couple other people and came out here to have a few drinks. We sat in the lounge area and were greeted by Edgar, who brought us our drinks, a dish of complimentary snacks (that included a mix of peanuts, pretzels, corn nuts, and Goldfish crackers), and a pack of cards and some dice, explaining to us some drinking games that we could play.\n\nThey were more than kind and extremely generous; they even gave us a round on the house! And everybody traded hugs & kisses with Mama, who's one of the owners; a fantastic woman who kept us all entertained with her lively, histrionic personality. Needless to say, we had  a blast! We're going to grab a couple more friends and come out to their 4th anniversary next Saturday on the 8th of September!\n\nAnd the best part (for me, anyways) is that I live right around the corner, so after a night of fun here I only have to take a few steps and I'm home!", "author": "P A U L."}

Was welcomed by Cam at the door, who was taking a break, and proceeded to step into a great atmosphere. The DJ music was moving, and along with the rest of the setting, gave me the impression that \"I WANT TO DRINK HERE!!!!\" \n\nThe bartender was a slender cute girl named Yen. She asked what I wanted, and I said something with pineapple juice, her choice. Yen returned with a very tasty drink, that hit the spot. I can't remember the name of the drink, because I was already too drunk, LOL!!! I followed that with a shot of Jack over, to toast with a drink I purchased for Annie. \n\nEZ5 is now added to my list of places to visit. I was told that it becomes a club on Friday and Saturday.

Had it not been for the Happy Hour function we had today, I probably would have never found it. After my experience today I wish I hadn't. There isn't too much to this story, but what coincided left me completely flabbergasted. \n\nI had just finished a typical day at work and headed to EZ5 to meet up with some coworkers for drinks. I really wasn't in the mood for alcohol so I ordered some water finishing my first glass rather quickly. When I asked for a second glass, an annoyed bartender told me that this would be my last free glass, and if I wanted more water I'd have to pay for it. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I need to pay for tap water? Worst part of it all was that this person turned out to be \"Momma\" who apparently is an owner if not THE owner.\n\nOf the 100s of bars that I have visited across the globe, never have I experience anything like this. What was this lady thinking? I was with a group of 20+ regular customers who were also in shock by this story. I can't even think of ANY situation where it would be ok to deny somebody water. I was feeling very dehydrated so was not in the mood for any alcohol and for the OWNER of a bar to deny me from something I needed because \"it does not make good business sense\" is simply outrageous. Apparently she needs to pay her water bill. Funny thing is I heard that Momma sometimes hands out free shots. \n\nWell, I guess if you're looking for a bar where you can get really wasted without having to worry about your friends calling you a wuss for pacing your drinking with water then EZ5 is the bar for you. Well, now that I got that off of my chest, I'm gonna go get my water. \n\nOh, and Momma, you should probably rethink the strategy of denying water to your customers. Someday you'll realize that it actually IS good for business.", "author": "Marcel I."}

The music was good but no one was dancing because it's pretty small and there was no room for gettin down. I'm not sure why the location on here says it's located in the financial district because I feel like it's in the middle of Chinatown. We found street parking around the corner, so that, combined with the lack of cover, was a guarantee for a good night.", "author": "Sobrina T."}

If you're looking for a chill night w/music, head here. The one reason I come is cuz the bartend-ress, Denise is awesome!  I don't have to wait long to get my drink order, and she makes the perfect drink everytime!  Otherwise, most nights, it'll be pretty quiet w/the occasional bachelor & bachelorette parties which can take up 50% of the space.", "author": "Christi S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-06-08", "description": "This is handsdown one of my favorite bars because it is so hard to define. All of the reviewers so far are right. Yes, it's over 40 people, and yes, it's under 25 people, and yes, it has funky mismatched furniture and cheap doo-dads, and yes, the owners are nice. They were having really good hors d'oevres for a while, and the DJs were OK if old school, 90s hip hop, and electronica were your bit. It's small and next to my fave dim sum place. It's random and eccentric like SF, and yay, it's not in the Mission!", "author": "Anna B."}

Sure the place is kinda small and the decor is retro, but the staff is super duper friendly and they have a nice little appetizer bar to fill up your stomach before drinking it up with your fellow co-workers.  Be sure to get there early on a Friday though because this place gets packed with the Financial District happy hour crowd.", "author": "Yun W."}

I loved this place because it was totally hidden, they played music, the owners were so chill (not like most bar owners) and they came up with different types of drinks for happy hour.  They're pretty chill...it's dark, and the ambiance is nice.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's small as hell inside.", "author": "Nathalie C."}

EZ5 is actually a hike uphill from where I work (California /Davis) but its worth the walk.  \n\nThey have cute booth seats with square/foot rest add-ons that can be moved around depending on how big or small your group is and they have $3 Sierra....whoa!  Other HH specials include $3 wine but mind you, its $3 so don't expect much.  I'm not a wine drinker myself but just looking out for those of you who are.  Jello shots are only $1 if you're feeling adventorous.  The place also has complementary snacks, not just mixed nuts but salami, pretzels, edamame and other stuff.  Service is awesome,  the girls are on top of their stuff.  No need to do any hands in the air signals to get another drink.\n\nEZ5 is the place I go to for a chill time to hang out after work.", "author": "Arceny A."}

I guess the landlords weren't stoked when they realized that T. was making all the money...they gouged the rent and made him sell the bar.

Parking was surprisingly easy to find. When I got out of my car and saw the place was just around the corner, I was like \"Oh snap!\" My cousin and I arrived just after 10, so most of the clientele was at the bar. We grabbed a seat on one of the couches and placed the first of many drink orders for the night with the waitress. She reminded me of Gogo from Kill Bill with her slow pacing back and forth. Hey, she could've been hiding a meteor hammer somewhere in that hoodie she was wearing! All assumptions aside, she was actually very nice and attentive. A friend of ours was the DJ that night. He dished out mostly 80s and 90s joints, and I don't recall hearing anything mainstream, which was cool. More people began filling the place up after 11, but not to the point where it was hard to weave through the crowd. Overall, the vibe was good and the drinks hit at the right moment. No complaints here! I wouldn't mind coming back.", "author": "Rhia R."}

BTW, dont order absinthe when there are alot of ppl at the bar because it does take up quite a bit of time to make this concoction.", "author": "Sam L."}
