With Wing Lum, this was a bad assumption.  I came here for dinner on a Sunday and ordered their seafood deluxe. I even upgraded - soup, appetizer and rice for $7.50 extra.  \n\nThe food here was not good - the soup was bland (and they gave me a lot of it), the egg rolls did not have a lot of filling and the seafood was overcooked (the shellfish was rubbery).  The veggies were OK.  The upgrade was not worth it. \n\nThe service was consistent with what you'd expect for an ethnic place. With tax and tip, this was about $28. The restaurant itself was a bit dated.  Not recommended.", "author": "Andrew S."}

First of all, a mutual friend knew the people working at this restaurant, so a group of 8 of us walks in on a Saturday night at 1:30am right when they were about to close, but my friend insisted that we had to eat at this Chinese restaurant. When the restaurant employee saw my friend, his face changed from being hesitant to welcome arms. We got seated at this long table perfect for 8 people. I'll admit there was this shady individual at the bathrooms, but besides that, this place was the bomb.\n\nThe ambiance is very oriental feeling. They definitely tried to make the restaurant seem more Chinese with their painted walls and various Asian decor. They had wooden chopsticks and placed forks on the table for us. While I went to use the restroom, I was surprised to find out that my friends had ordered two of the following to be split between the two tables - General Tsao chicken, Mongolian beef, chow mein, and honey shrimp with cashews. Then I requested to order the twice cooked pork because that was what I was craving. The food came out pretty fast, probably because we were quite literally the only ones in there at 2am. \n\nI'm sure the food tasted even better since we spent the whole night drinking away at the bars on Polk Street, but it was so tasty! Somehow, we hooligans finished all the dishes (my side of the table quicker than the other). It was as if we inhaled the food from it being so delicious. I really liked the twice cooked pork flavors even though the pork isn't quite the typical twice cooked pork with it being crispy and all. It was kind of like a Mongolian beef texture. I've never had the honey shrimp with cashews before. It's usually candied walnuts with the honey shrimp, but it was a great substitute! That was a must order along with the twice cooked pork. The General Tsao surprisingly wasn't too breaded and it was very tangy with enough chicken meat to breaded ratio. \n\nOverall, I will come back here whether it's a late night Chinese craving or during the day. Great service and delicious food! Also, with a 20% tip, the total for 9 dishes came out to be about $16 per person! Great for groups!", "author": "Ada C."}

I know that there are many Chinese restaurants in San Francisco that offer competition. But this establishment gets five stars from me which is significant because I don't pass out five stars generously. But Wing Lum deserves every bit of those five stars.\n    Ok I know there are a lot of good Chinese restaurants out there. But there is usually something I don't like about them. The portions aren't big enough. They won't take the vegetables out of the fried rice(I don't do vegi's). The servers are unfriendly. Too over priced for what you get. Not here at Wing Lum. Everything from the quality and portions of the food served to the service and price is right on the mark with what a good Chinese restaurant should be. \n    Lets focus on the food right now. I'm sorry but nobody does it right like Wing Lum does it. As I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I do realize that there are a lot of good Chinese restaurants out there. Especially in a city like San Francisco. But no matter where I am at the moment, I will go out of my way to be able to eat at Wing Lum. I recommend their sweet and sour pork. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Not only is it delicious but they give you a lot of it. By the time time you finish you will be full. :-) The great thing is it won't cost you an arm and a leg to get full either. \n    The same waiter always waits on me and my friend every time we go in there. He's always super friendly and very prompt with the service. You never have to get his attention for anything. That is the sign of a good waiter. He pays attention to his customers so they don't have to come to him for service. He's right on it. \n    I could go on and on saying good things about this place. But I think you all get the idea. Wing Lum is a groovey place to get some excellent Chinese food in the beautiful city by the bay. Alright! Yeah! Uhhhh!", "author": "Nathanial T."}

We catch a matinee at the AMC Van Ness, and then we duck in to Mel's Diner next door for a bite to eat. Unfortunately, the line to get in to Mel's this year was out the door. We searched up and down Van Ness and Polk Street for a plan B. We pretty much heard an angel choir singing when we saw the Open sign at Wing Lum.\n\nThe decor of the place is pretty funky. Lots of fountains, pastel colors, plants, and weird ornaments (none of which really seemed to match). But we didn't care - we were hungry, and these guys were serving.\n\nNormally, I'm leary of restaurants that have menus a with a long laundry list of food options. Wing Lum's menu is HUGE. They had over 244 choices (no joke) to select from. Since I was hungry and unfamiliar with the quality of the food, I decided to stick with tried and true Chinese favorites - pot stickers and chicken fried rice. My friends order the prawn fried rice and the no-fried lemon chicken (which is a cute way of saying tofu). Everything turned out to be just fine. The pot stickers were a bit on the doughy side, but the pork filling was tasty. Plus, we got 8 in our order, so it was easy to share. You're lucky to get six pot stickers per order at most restaurants. My chicken fried rice was also decent. The chicken and veggies were plentiful. The rice was a bit on the greasy side, but it all tasted good.\n\nPrices are reasonable. Service is efficient. Thanks, Wing Lum for saving our Christmas!", "author": "Kevin B."}

Since this device can smash subatomic particles together and reproduce the energies that existed a fraction of a second after the big bang, along with creating Z bosons, pi mesons, and the strange quarks that construct the fabric of the universe, you are pretty certain that you can use this thing to make the best Sweet and Sour Chicken of all time and dimensional spectrums. \n\n\"What's your name?\" you ask the battered scientist.\n\n\"Christoph.

Both times I went the place was EMPTY and yet my friend and I had to wait about 30 mins for someone to take our order, then another 30 mins for our food and then eventually when we gave up on waiting for the check we'd go ask for it and head out.  The worst was when people would get seated next to us (in the empty restaurant) and then they would get their food before we'd ever order and leave before we'd ever get our food!\n\nNeedless to say, I stick with take out.  However tonight I tried delivery for the first time (yes, we're exceptionally lazy today... but its \"free delivery\"!) and that didn't work out at all!\n\nI called in my order: orange peel beef, chicken fried rice, potstickers and fried wontons.  There is a coupon on the takeout menu for free chicken fried rice for orders over $20, and the pre tax total according to the menu was 20.75 without the rice.  So my first mistake was not specifying that I wanted to use the coupon, which in hindsight would have saved much time, but I figured I'd just explain to the delivery guy about the coupon and its all good.  WRONG.  He shows up and tells us the total is $31+ because we got Kung Pao Chicken.  NOPE.  Definitely never would have ordered that because of my peanut allergy.  So my bf explains to the guy that we never ordered that and he says we get it free because of the coupon for orders over $25... Ok, so we call the restaurant and explain that we definitely don't want the Kung Pao and ask to just pay for the rest... after passing the phone back and forth (it was more humorous than anything else) they finally agree to take the Kung Pao back and our total is $24.  Fine, whatever.  He left the coupon on the floor.\n\nWe sit down and pull out the food and my bf starts eating the orange peel beef... definitely chicken.  WTF.  At least my rice and sides were excellent.\n\nWhy 2 stars: They definitely have the best chicken fried rice ever and the prices are fantastic.  Everything I order is excellent.  I just wish they could not pull weird shady business by throwing in \"free\" items and charging more and then mess up everything anyway...\n\nLesson learned: stick with walking in and ordering takeout, order elswhere for delivery or dine-in.  The food is quite excellent, cheap, ready fast and you don't have to deal with anyone.  :)", "author": "Katie S."}

Not able to finish all the dishes in the dinner we asked if we could box it up to go. Our waiter (I think the owner, as he said he had been there for 14 years) offered to box it up himself and took our dishes to go box them. He returned with one semi-large bag. We thanked him for our time there and went home. The next day when I opened the food bag up for leftovers dinner I found that the majority of our food was missing.\n\nEach of the take-out boxes were filled no more than halfway, when they each should have been overflowing, if not put in multiple boxes. We had barely touched the cashew chicken dish: one bite by each of us.\n\nI called and asked about our predicament. The person on the phone remembered who I was and blamed us for the problem, explaining that we forgot the other food, that he threw it out this morning, and that if we had called earlier he would still have it. I asked how we could have forgotten it when he didn't bring it out to us. He then switched languages on me, and I couldn't understand what was said. To his credit when I told him I didn't understand he switched back to English.\n\nFrom then on, he was very rude and hostile toward me saying over and over again that I had forgotten the food. I kept asking how this was possible as he only brought out one bag for us, and put it directly on the table. Seeing this was going nowhere, I told him to have a nice night and that I am sorry but I cannot return to his dishonest business.\n\nWhat doesn't make sense to me if there was an extra bag (that he might have left in the back) was that we had four dishes to be boxed up: mongolian beef, cashew chicken, bbq pork fried rice, and won ton soup (he switched the soup in the Szechuan Dinner at the beginning when we ordered, as we asked)\n\nThe bag I received had one box for each of these dishes, but extremely small portions of each inside. If there had been another bag, it makes more sense to me that you would box one dish up at a time. So if a dish took up more than one box, those boxes would be filled before any of the other dishes were boxed up. Then I would put the boxes for one dish in a single bag, and only after running out of space in that bag (weight, volume), then I would get a second bag and put the rest of the dishes in there.\n\nBecause the bag I received had portions of all the dishes in it, it makes more sense to me that our waiter did not even box up the rest and decided not to give us our food. But maybe he just forgot to bring out the other bag.\n\nEither way, he was extremely rude on the phone and dishonest about the situation, blaming me for a mistake he made. I will not be returning here, despite the comfortable aroma and pretty good food. There are plenty of other Chinese food restaurants in the area.", "author": "Cael H."}

But it ended up $16.25... My thought was \"why is it so expensive for 2 items?\" after i paid, i realized they charged me for an extra item that i did not item. Which was a bowl of soup... unless it comes for free... but still..  \noverall, my shrimp was fresh but the fortune cookie was stale =( \nNext time, if i ever order out, I'll make sure what the cost is... or else, I'll feel ripped off again.", "author": "Selina L."}

It started out as delivery, and then I discovered the fantastic dining room. \n\nWing Lum provides SF Chinese at it's best: great portions, fresh vegetables and meats, their seitan is pretty darn good and the in-house service is amazing.\n\nThey give generous portions - and if you are a regular customer, they will generally throw in a lot of extra stuff, like appetizers, etc. \n\nMy personal favourites are the BBQ Pork Chow Mein and Sweet & Sour Seitan.", "author": "Stephen M."}

My waitress was a sweet old lady who kept me posted on how soon my food was coming.  I started w/ a bowl of wonton soup, but not like the kind I used to get in NY w/ 3 wontons and tiny shreds of pork.  This soup was $5.50 worth with about 6 or 7 wontons and a bunch of veggies in a big bowl.  It was definitely satisfying.\n\nThis place is suited more for 2 or more people, they have pretty big portions.  I came alone though so I was practically full from my soup when they brought out the Chicken House Special I ordered w/ rice.  Delicious, and the lady pointed out the Chinese shittake mushrooms in it maybe because she could tell I was half-Japanese.  This also hit the spot, spicy and delicious.", "author": "Teddy H."}

And after a night out we weren't keen on trekking over to Chinatown so this place just had to suffice. You know what though, this place isn't too shabby. The dim sum could have been a little better or more varied, but it tides one over for a bit. Don't let the slim pickings for dim sum deter you. Of the dishes we selected all of them were pretty tasty. The service was a bit on the slow side but they are also apologetic to that fact but overall it was pretty standard.", "author": "Shauna S."}

The girl at the counter said they'd had a big party earlier or something.  Cleaned them out.  \"Shouldn't you close up shop or go by some other name until this condition is remedied?  I mean you are 'DIM SUM Bar', for chrissake!\".  I couldn't help but be a bit of an ass.  This put a logistical wrench in my dinner mission.  I still had to pick up a Vietnamese sandwich at Lees for Lauren C on Larkin and Ellis, so I could hardly roam very far in pursuit of my own dim-sum cravings.  But a few days ago, I'd noticed \"Dim Sum all day\" signs had appeared taped up inside the windows of Wing Lum on Sutter and Polk.  Fate!  I'd never set foot in the place before tonight, though I've been walking past it for years.  Way too much Chinese fanfare for the Tenderloin, if you know what I mean.  But tonight, it's all good.  I make my way up the four steps that elevate the establishment, by a small but meaningful degree, above the level of the street.  Inside, it's movie-set thick with ambiance, alright.  Bright lucky Chinese red painted interior.  The fog-machine exoticism of large epiphytes hanging from the ceiling in clay pots crusted with lichen that drip moisture into the koi pond below.  A serpent of Christmas lights coils about the stone feet of Eastern deities.  There are small aquariums throughout the restaurant that glow like green lanterns at tableside and teem with baby guppies amidst glaucous algal blooms.  Nice.  Clearly there is a fair amount of positive radiation keeping all this shit flourishing and alive.  I know about how fish tanks and plants are a gauge of the health of the house.  So I am prepared to love this place from the moment I step inside. A smiling Chinese woman comes forward to greet me. \"I came in for the dim-sum!\", I announce. A Chinese man looks up from the kitchen through a window in the wall and makes approving eye contact with me.  \"I saw the signs...\"   I want to make sure they know why I'm here.  I want to be a reward to their efforts.\n\nThe new dim-sum offering at Wing Lum is great, and you should avail yourself enthusiastically of this new source of 'sum in the Loin, if that's your thing.  But this glowing review owes more to the nourishment I took for the soul.  \"Thanks Wing Lum dudes for your awesome and unselfconscious expression of entrepreneurial optimism.  Thanks for having the courage to reinvent yourself in uncertain times.  Be encouraged!  Make your signs larger and more colorful.\"", "author": "Jack M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-14", "description": "If you like bland, overpriced Chinese food then this is the spot for you!!!  Hit this joint up last night after having a few drinks with a friend.  We ordered the usual salt and pepper porkchops (which is a chef's \"special\" on their menu) and the beef w/oyster sauce.  Now, mind you, I don't expect much from a Chinese restaurant these days.  I expect bad wait staffs, less than sanitary conditions, and cooks that I wouldn't want to eat from if I actually saw them in-person.  But one thing I do expect from a Chinese restaurant is this thing called, umm...flavor!!!  Flavor is that thing that sort of spreads around and gets absorbed into your taste buds when you put something in your mouth.  Well our dishes lacked this key component.  The beef w/oyster sauce was craphole bland and the salt and pepper spareribs had neither a salty nor peppery flavor going on.  Keep in mind here folks that it's 12:30 in the morning and we're trying to sober up from the drinks we'd had earlier that night.  So if this place can't satisfy my low expectations in a state of semi-drunken hunger, then you know it's bad.  Save your money and go elsewhere.  Even the Subway on the corner stays open late so maybe a $5 footlong is a better choice.", "author": "D L."}
