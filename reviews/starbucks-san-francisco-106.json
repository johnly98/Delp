I usually top by this branch to grab a coffee on my way to work. It is full of people and long line at even early hours. \n\nOverall, this place is fine and I do understand that they get busy from time to time. However, my last experience with location was not pleasant. \n\nI ordered a hot chocolate with no whip cream and waited about 15 minutes to get my order ready. Once it was ready I picked it up and realized that there is a whip cream in it on my way to out. Immediately returned and told it to server over the counter. I was thinking that they will replace is promptly so that I could get on my way. However, the lady picked up my cup and without saying a \"sorry\" just dumped top part of hot chocolate and fill it with milk. Ok I get it, you might have a bad day, or tired, but at least don't do it in front of customer. It just feels like blank point insult to your daily customers. \n\nAnyways, I will stop by at another Starbucks down the the street from now on. Even though it doesn't change anything in eyes of corporate company, I would at least get better customer experience with some respect.", "author": "Jason M."}

One employee in particular who was male with black somewhat curly hair with terrible washed out green highlights had the worst attitude of them all. My mother and I waited patiently on line to order and we waited a total of 15 minutes online. When we ordered my mother ordered a non fat cappuccino dry, and she said extra extra dry. When we received our drinks, her drink was filled to a brim and nothing of what she had asked, she kindly asked them to remake it and the guy with the terrible hair threw attitude and was scoffing. We waited 20 minutes for the drink which he hadn't made and yet again we went up to confront him. He looked at us and my mother said \"I've been waiting patiently for twenty minutes for a drink I ordered 30 minutes ago and had messed up once. Is my drink done yet?\" With the worst attitude I have ever witnessed, he barked at us telling us it wasn't his problem and that that he didn't care that we were waiting for that long. We called the manger over and while we were speaking to him the terrible haired employee started mocking us, throwing his hands on the air, flipping us off, making funny faces, and was being extremely unprofessional at his job. I'm not sure how a man like him even acquired a job. The manager was laughing and didn't even care a bit which was even more disgusting. I have never been more appalled in my life. And I am a avid customer to Starbucks. I am very disappointed that this Starbucks was very unprofessional and disgusting towards us. The girl who kindly remade our drink in the end was super professional and sweet.

One was courteous, and seemed interested in my request to be fulfilled. He alone is the reason that I am awarding two stars. He was also the employee who prepared mine, and my groups beverage which were all made well. That being said, the other stocky employee made me feel like I was being a nuisance by politely asking for some toilet paper, or some napkins to use the bathroom. I have worked in food industry positions before, and I understand how difficult it may be to accommodate anything out of your primary role (in this case making drinks etc). However, when I asked there were only two officers in line that were being serviced by the other employee. In other words there was no reason to shirk off my small request to restock something as basic as toilet paper. The stocky employee that I asked for the toilet paper from went to the back about 5 mins after I asked and I was under the impression he was getting the toilet paper, but in fact he wasn't. It wasn't until the friendly employee asked him two separate times did he finally get toilet paper. Before the friendly employee informed me that the toilet paper was restocked. By the time he did so my group had finished all of their drinks and were solely waiting on me. I am thankful I don't have any medical issues that require prompt bathroom access in public spaces.  but not before he used the bathroom himself. I have also submitted photos representing the chaotic state of the bathroom itself which leads me to believe that they are negligent in general with the maintenance of the bathroom. That is a health code issue, and it didn't boost my confidence in their sanitation behind the counter either. Anyways, some may say this is a small infraction but in my opinion customers shouldn't be made to feel invisible, unimportant, or like a nuisance. Also sanitation both in and around food prep is essential for a safe and quality product.

I came in on 5/10/14, about twenty minutes BEFORE their Frappaccino Happy Hour was about to start. \nI asked for a Venti Caramel Frappaccino with two extra shots blended in, and I asked for it to be split into two Grande cups. I know that the shots included create extra volume in the drink when blended (I would know, I work in a licensed store), and since I'm paying $1.50 for the extra shots for a total of $6.45 for the drink, I wanted my leftovers that wouldn't fit in the normal Venti cup. The cashier proceeded to tell me that they can't split my drink in two cups. \n\nEXCUSE ME? I had to explain I wanted my leftovers, and again she told me, they can't split my drink because it's against store policy. She said she would let the person on bar know. For some reason this simple request became such a big problem because at the time I walked in and ordered, there was maybe one or two customers after me. She needed to talk to TWO of her coworkers, which caused a build up behind me. One of her coworker said she would split it for me.\n\nI paid and walked to the bar. I proceeded to watch four WATER cups come out. \nSo let me get this straight, it's fine for FREE water cups to come out, but I can't ask for an extra cup for a drink I PURCHASED? It's free advertisement that I'm walking around Union Square with a Starbuck's beverage and not just a free water..\n\nTo add insult to injury, I'm sure they messed up my drink. I asked the man who handed off the drink if my two shots were blended in, and the woman said they were. Funny, since I watched them make my drink and didn't see any shots go in. I asked for two ADDITIONAL shots to be added, not to REPLACE the frap roast.\n\nTerrible customer service. With some many locations nearby I won't be returning to this one.", "author": "Jenna H."}

She wasn't there first, I was. However, if she'd asked nicely, I would've given her the table as I was standing right next to it waiting. I also got adopted by a family who gathered around me. I finally went outside to wait and a lady stood so close to me that I could count the hairs in her ear even though there was plenty of room outside. Bah.

They are ubiquitous.  This one gets special kudos for extremely pleasant service.\n\nIt's got to be tough, in that particular tourist-heavy location, to keep a good attitude.

Mass-produced coffee with menu items like the frappuccino, excess packaging, and free trade coffee is not featured. Part of me goes \"eff that man! Put your money behind your convictions!\" But I need something to get me through the day, and Peet's by Macy's charges premium prices for slow service (hai this is tourist land). Yes, I am sometimes of weak moral constitution.\n\nAs a result of this location being a mere 45 seconds from my workplace, I'm here A LOT. Sometimes there is a line and sometimes the bathroom (recently redone) is out of toilet paper but the people that work here try their best to keep things going. They are also cheerful but (usually) not obnoxiously so, and on the rare occasion when they do screw up my order (on my 15 min. break I don't have time to wait for them to make me another drink!) they've always made it up to me.\n\nMaybe I keep coming back here because caffeine is one of the addictions I struggle with daily (another one being shoes), or maybe it's the turkey bacon English muffin sandwiches, or maybe it's that starbucks rewards program that gives me free soy and peppermint in my lattes (I always hate paying more for soy. It's not my fault my body can't digest milk!). It's definitely not the red velvet cupcakes (gross! but the vanilla bean cupcakes are a great treat). I'd like to think it's the good people and the fast drink-making. \n\nI now judge all other starbucks locations by this one and so far the 24 hour location on California as well as the one in Macy's SF have come up wayyyyy short.\n\nMinus one star because well....it's still not a cappuccino from an Italian bar. Gotta hit north beach for that.", "author": "Katies F."}

Customer service.\n\nI'm not here often -- perhaps once or twice a week at most. The SWEETEST Filipina woman works here: she remembers my name, my order, and actually takes the time to ask how I'm doing. It's sad that such gestures of civility color my impressions of a place but WHOOP there it is.\n\nOn the other hand, there's a cute muscle-bound guy who works here too, yet he clearly thinks I'm a repugnant piece of shit who looks like the son of The Elephant Man and Madeleine Albright handmaidened by Bruce Vilanch since he always refuses eye contact, any form of address, and practically THREW the lemon scone at me when I was last here. But that's okay since you know I LOVE getting abused by guys who think they're superior to me and/or have a stick up their ass, and after living in SF for a number of years I'm used to the entitled, condescending, fuck off ugly Japo superiority complex of gay turd blossoms as manifested in a fragrant display of behavior both aggressive and passive-aggressive.\n\nWE ARE FA-MI-LY!

My Starb, though responsible for my dwindling bank account, has shown me that this international chain often blamed for the world's problems, is capable of having a neighborhood feel - clean, friendly and superbly run. \n\nThe Stockton/Sutter location, on the other hand, is exactly the kind of place that Howard Schultz and every single Starbucks employee should be ashamed of. \n\nMy most recent visit was to grab a juice for my companion, who happens to be diabetic and was suffering from a very low blood sugar. Because I couldn't afford to wait in line first, I grabbed a juice and made sure he was ok before returning to wait in line. Fifteen minutes later, I was still standing in the line, waiting to pay for the juice. One customer had ordered and paid that entire time, and there were still three people waiting patiently in front of me and several more behind. Behind the counter, there were EIGHT Starbucks employees, six of whom were standing around idly, chatting. I had to ask if it was possible for someone else to open a register before any of the other six employees even made a move. The employee who rang me up (blond bob cut, big earrings, you know who you are) was rude and even made snide remarks to another employee about me while I was standing right there. \n\nThe manager on duty, (thin male, dark hair, glasses, you also know who you are), one of the six employees who was not doing anything to run his business efficiently, was of no help and muttered a faint apology when I let him know of my experience. \n\nEven if you ignore my unfortunate experience this evening, this Starbucks is regularly the slowest and dirtiest one around. I would highly recommend you try any of the other dozen in the neighborhood - You really can't get much worse than this place.", "author": "Carolyn C."}

NASTY RESTROOM!!!\n\nI was just there yesterday with my boyfriend and his mom, after shopping we wanted to grab a cup of coffee before heading home.  I wasn't the one that stayed in line to place the order so I didn't have any interesting conversation with the cashier, hehe... lucky me  =)  but it wasn't a pleasant visit for me anyway...\n\nI was sitting down waiting for my boyfriend to come back with my mocha and it took him over 15 minutes so I got impatient and went up to find him.  There he stood so I asked him why so long, and he told me the guy there said 'someone may have taken one of our mocha', and logically you would think they'll make you a replacement right away, hehe... not this place!!!  \n\nSo my boyfriend waited, and he saw orders placed after him got fulfilled, so he asked the guy there how much longer for our mocha to be made, and the guy said, 'ah, ok one second'.  Hehe... seriously, that guy had no common sense or what?  It occurred to us that he didn't have much up there.  \n\nIf we paid for the mocha and stood there waited, and didn't get it, then they owe us, am I not correct?  'Someone may have taken one of our mocha'?  What does that really mean anyway?  Did he expected us to just say 'ok' and walk away, hehe...  I say the guy there forgot to make my mocha and didn't want to admit to that, maybe? I don't care if someone took my mocha; I want my mocha, hehe... that's all  =)\n\nAnyways, after we got the mocha, I needed to use their restroom before the long drive.  The line was not too long, with 3 people ahead of me, so I waited.  OMG, their restroom was sooooo nasty.  The door you have to pull really hard to shut (someone could have fixed the door, ya know, considering so many customers each day).  The garbage can was full and toilet papers were all over the floor.  It was not a place I wanted to be in.  Contract those muscles if you have to  =)  Oh, and the mocha, tasted like crap.
