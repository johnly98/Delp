Luckily we came when it wasn't foggy - it was a clear sunny day so we could see everything. Because it's on a hill, you get a clear 360 view of the city. You get a view as far as Financial District, but also of the Inner / Outer Sunset Neighborhood. I could even see Twin Peaks from up there! \n\nIt's a little walk up the stairs from the street to get to the top, and there's a small trail that wraps around the hill if you want to take your time. At the top, there's a few benches overlooking the city. Would be cute for a date spot, or even a picnic! No bathrooms - so make sure you go beforehand.\n\nAs far as parking goes, we chose to park further away and walk. We parked on the street near the base of the Hidden Garden Steps and had no problems finding a spot. To get to Grandview, we went up the Hidden Garden Steps, walked through a cute residential up to the 16th Ave Tiled steps, then walked that staircase and walked up another staircase to the actual park. A lot of walking, but makes for a great urban adventure in the area!\n\nBecause it's next to the 16th Ave Tiled steps and walking distance to the Hidden Garden Steps, I think it's a pretty good spot to take visitors. There's quite a bit to see in the area alone, and the neighborhood is quite cute to walk around. That is, if they're looking for more unique experiences in the city beyond the tourist-y stuff.", "author": "Alyanna C."}

Even if the view is obstructed by fog it's still nice to come for the mystical feeling of being surrounded by fog and wind.  You could spend $200 on an oxygen facial or you could come here for free.\n\nI use Grand View Park as a stop on an urban hike adventure.  There are a lot of staircases in this neighborhood to do a mildly strenuous urban hike.  The Tilted and Hidden Garden steps nearby are the most well known and picture worthy so I'd recommend checking those out as well if coming here.\n\nI usually take the staircases and make my way to Golden Gate Heights park.

Then I took more steep steps to walk down to the top of the 16th Avenue Tiled Steps. If you do it without taking too many breaks (which you will inevitably want to in order to take pictures of the view), it's actually a pretty decent workout. \n\nI would definitely recommend this for anyone visiting San Francisco who wants to do physical activity for about 30 mins - 1 hour (depending on your speed) and also see some views.

In my opinion, Grandview Park is like the cherry on top of the cake that is the 16th ave Tiled Steps. It's really not that hard to climb up the few stairs if you are in some kind of shape. \n\nJust like with the Tiled Steps, turn back once or twice on your way up so you can see the different in scenery. In my opinion, I find the views to be gorgeous. On your way up to the top, not only enjoy the view, but relax in the comfort of the generous shade from the large trees.\n\nThe reason why I like this place so much is because you get to see a 360 degree view of a part of SF that gets ignored a lot: the residential areas. Usually, you associate SF with the loud city life in the financial district. Hence, when you go up to twin peaks, thats what you primarily see. But this is a nice change in atmosphere because you get a quieter, more serene, more SUREAL view of the other side.\n\nI think the best part is probably that you can see how LARGE Golden Gate Park is. Its literally like another world down there because you can see how far it spans across San Francisco.\n\nThis place is a must go with your friends, family, and loved ones.\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Once on the top of the stairs, you can make a quick left around the hill towards the top of the hill.  There you will be greeted with some strong winds from the pacific ocean that is a breath of fresh air.

I'd heard about the 16th & Moraga Street mosaic steps before (see my other review for those), but had not had the pleasure of viewing them myself. My bf and I got a new camera, so we wanted to spend the day in the city trying it out and being tourists (even though we live nearby and come to the city often). I was looking up the mosaic steps, and I stumbled upon the Grand View Park reviews. I never would've known this incredible place existed if it weren't for Yelp, so I am eternally grateful. \n\nOnce you reach the top of the mosaic steps, you walk up the street to the right, and you'll see a small set of stairs on the left. Climb those steps, and then continue on to the right and you'll find the winding wooden staircase up to Heaven (or what I would like to imagine Heaven looks like). We were lucky enough to go there on a super clear Sunday in November. The weather was fantastic all over the city that day. It wasn't super crowded up top - maybe 20 people total, so we were able to get tons of pics without having random people in the pictures. The view is spectacular up there (it was so clear we could see the peaks of the Golden Gate that day), and we had a great time playing with the panoramic and other settings on the camera. \n\nWe brought sandwiches up there with us (which we were super thankful for after climbing all the stairs!). There are a few benches on the way up that look out over the ocean, and because it wasn't very crowded, there was one or two open. We opted to just stand and eat at the top though so we could overlook the bridge and downtown. I know we got extremely lucky with the weather, because it wasn't cold at all up there. But based on other's reviews, bring a coat up there with you, because you want to be able to spend as much time as you'd like taking it all in, and not have to cut out early because you're freezing. \n\nI would definitely love to come back here at night to check out the city lights.

Sure, I could use the exercise, but I was storing up those calories and time for sunset gazing.\n\nFYI, the steps look ordinary from the top too, so it's best to start your journey at the base of the tiled steps. Take in the art, and then travel up another flight a steps up to the top of Grand View Park, and stroll your way around the top for 360 views of the city.\n\nIt's a nice date spot for a picnic or sunset. Take your out of town friends too, coupled with the tiled steps for a good, local experience and views.", "author": "Rebecca G."}

While my boyfriend with a fear of heights doesn't love the stairs, we both enjoy climbing to the top of this hill to watch the sunset over the ocean or the fog roll in under the bridge. The view includes the entire span of Golden Gate Park, the GG bridge, downtown, twin peaks, the entire sunset district, Angel Island, the Marin Headlands, and the ocean.\n\nI love using this area to do exercise. The staircase is long, and running up them, around the park, down the other set, and around the block is a great workout. I often see high school soccer teams training around here.\n\nWhile you're visiting, also check out the two sets of tiled stairs. While this neighborhood is extremely confusing to navigate by car or on foot, the two tiled staircases are hidden artistic gems. They aren't near each other, though (10 minute walk apart), and they aren't exactly the stairs on this park.\n\nThe only criticisms of this park are the hefty amounts of poison oak around the hill! Beware! Sometimes there's a little bit of glass in the sand, so don't go barefoot. Also, bring your sweatshirt cause it can get windy!", "author": "Allxie C."}

The trek to get to the top requires a climb up several dozen steps regardless from what side you enter from (14th st or 16 st) but you will be rewarded once you arrive to the top (assuming there is no fog). The view is unobstructed and spans the entire Golden Gate Park which is something you can't really get from Twin Peaks.\n\nThere is only one bench at the top and a couple places to really sit down comfortably and enjoy the view. One thing to note is that if you come from the 14th st entrance, you will have to walk through some sand - just an fyi with those concerned about ruining your shoes. The 16th street steps feature mosaics so be sure to check those out (many people are unaware of these steps if they happen to enter/leave from the 14th street side).", "author": "E E."}

Decided to do something non-foodie related with my girl Chloe G. and spent the day checking out the simpler things around the Sunset. This park definitely lives up to its name and offers a stellar grand view of San Francisco.\n\nThere are two streets you can enter from - 14th Avenue and 15th Avenue - both requiring a hike up a stairway. The ground becomes sand and the wind picks up as you get toward the top, so come correct with the clothes. There are a couple of benches scattered around the park so that you can sit and enjoy the view from different angles.\n\nHIDE YO KIDS!! So much PDA it's cute, but then it's not cute. There were also beer bottles littered around. Who the hell would even think about getting drunk up here?! The terrain up top was so bumpy to even walk on sober, I nearly pulled a Jack and Jill and busted my head open like Humpty Dumpty!! I ain't got time to be luggin' people down this already steep slope neither because I can barely get myself down!!\n\nSimply put, Grand View Park is one of the best places to get a 360 of San Francisco. The view will catch your breath better than Kelly Clarkson ever could. From couples to families, writers, photographers, and everything in between, this place has something to offer for everybody.

I went when it was quite windy and no worries to those who are afraid of heights as there isn't really a cliff or anything that you can fall off of. \n\nOne of the best places to take scenic pictures and to take in the view. You can see the Golden Gate Bridge on a clear day and it's a really serene place.\n\nYou get quite a work out if you're coming from the 16th Avenue Tiled Steps Project, but it's well worth it when you reach the top.\n\nI highly recommend coming here for travelers as well as locals. Can't beat this natural attraction! The trees are also pretty unique and cool looking.", "author": "Henry P."}

Come check out GVP on a nice sunny day! You get a very majestic view of the north and west side of San Francisco. \n\nThis is a nice spot to check out the Blue Angels during Fleet Week. You can see a good crowd of people camping out at the top of the hill as well as people hanging around on the east side steps. A lot of folks also hang out at the east base of the hill along the road, to catch the aerial show.\n\nIf you are a workout junkie, GVP provides at least 3 different set of stairs for you to run up and down. Also, the 16th avenue steps is further down on the west side as well as another set of stairs on the north side takes you down to 16th and Kirkham.\n\nYou can also jog or walk around the streets that circles around the hill.

From there, you can see Sunset, Richmond, Downtown, and the entire span of Golden Gate Park. Simply beautiful.\n\nThis is my favorite local spot to watch the fireworks on New Years Day too. There aren't very many people, AND the view of the fireworks in addition to the view of the city is a spectacular view.\n\nI also tend to meet the most unique individuals up there too. Once I met a man who gave my friend and me a quiz on San Francisco, because he wanted to make sure we were \"true San Franciscans\". He asked us how many miles San Francisco was in length and width. He said 7 miles by 7 miles, but he was also drunk, so I'm not sure if his answer was correct...\n\nThe only minor problem I have is that I get lost about 90% of the time trying to find it, and then when I finally do find it, there's the trek of climbing a million stairs to get there, but I suppose that's what makes it so amazing :)", "author": "Caitlin C."}

Beware of the raised metal steps though. There is railing but for those uncomfortable with small heights, it can feel a little lacking in support and scary.

At Grand View, you still feel like you're IN the City, like you're in a really tall tree, looking out.\n\nNot as easily accessed as Twin Peaks, but the mosaic staircase on 16th Ave is quite pretty, and there is the plus side of not having to deal with gobs of Eurotrash and HK tourists", "author": "Sachi T."}

Last Monday I was off and it was one of those rare, gorgeously warm weather days in February, so the hubby and I took a walk/run up the thousands of steps or whatever to get there.  I was huffing and puffing around the halfway point while he was already waiting at the top.  \n\nWe hiked from below 19th ave, through the mosaic tiled steps, then up another set, and finally to the park itself.  A lady at the bottom of the staircase asked if we were going to the top and we said yes.  So she asked us to say a prayer for her cat buried up there.  We said okay, and then carefully walked through the sand (kind of wondering exactly where she buried the kitty).\n\nSince it was a clear day, the view was just absolutely breathtaking.  I think it was the first place I've seen in SF where you can really see everything, probably even more that Sutro if I can remember.  You can see the entire line of treetops from Golden Gate Park, the Golden Gate Bridge, Angel Island, North Bay - Sausalito area, downtown, the ocean as far as the Sloat side to where it crosses the Bay on the other end.  It was just so amazing and so tranquil.    \n\nOnce you're up there, you'll totally forget about the thousands of steps you have to walk down.", "author": "Stacey C."}

I struggled a bit with finding the place but that could just be because I'm new to the area and I don't quite have the hang of the crazy san fran streets yet.  One thing that all the reviews seemed to agree on is the fact that it is secluded and a good place to be alone.  This was not the case on the night that we went.  We went on a Saturday night and there was around 10 people there with the same idea.  10 people doesn't sound like a lot but it was a bit aggravating because it's not the biggest place.  Also, one of the reviews described the place to have a lot of benches and places to sit but really, there wasn't anywhere for us to sit.  We had to walk back down a little ways and stand to watch the sunset.\nOverall, this was a beautiful place and I got major points for taking my boyfriend here.

Get said hottie date to agree to an actual real date (no, that drunk pizza orgasmica run after getting tossed out of bar none does NOT count)....count that as a check too\r\n3.) Wine, dine, bide your time  with date (usually 3 drinks worth etc. etc. bla bla blah)\r\n4.) drop the a-game bomb on her/him- \"yeah, there's this little hill I know with a view that puts seeing the sun set over El Pollo Loco on El Camino in redwood city to shame\" \r\n5.) she/he will have no choice but to agree, you suave playah you\r\n6.) stop into a classy liquor store to get that equally nice, classy,  bottle of boone's farm (on ice playah, its what Fiddy would do)\r\n7.) chillax with your honey and watch the sun go down on the sunset, watch the lights of the boondocks that is my neighborhood wink on, and let the romance just flow...preferably, at a speed faster than the boone's farm running through your hot and bothered bodies\r\n8.) don't know- still have yet to get to this step (see previous steps)\r\n\r\nA-game baby, settle for nuthin' less", "author": "Tim V."}

Sitting up there at dawn and watching the sun come up is breath taking, just like when the sun is setting too! At times its sunny up there and then you see a blanket of fog rolling in too. It's quite nice =]", "author": "Jason C. J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-20", "description": "Even on the foggiest and coldest of days, this place is worth the little hike.  I'm sure on a clear day the views of Ocean Beach, GG Park, and Downtown are spectacular, but with the fog rolling in, it feels like you're floating above the city on a cloud.  Be forewarned however, this isn't your typical benches everywhere, spread a blanket over green grass and picnic type of park.  There are only a couple of actual benches, and some branches that have fallen strategically.  And the terrain is more ruffage than grass.  Great if you feel like going for a stroll/mini-hike...a wonderful view will be your reward.", "author": "Sarah L."}

Huge views, almost 360 views of the ocean, city, etc. It's off the beaten path, never too many people there, and never any tourists!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-25", "description": "Definitely a site to see. It's well worth the walk and the view is absolutely breathe taking. You MUST access it through the Morage Tile Stairs to complete the experience! The site, again is amazing. Come on a clear sunny day and get a glimpse of the entire San Francisco. Spots your favorite spots and view the ocean, even a love bench to sit for hours.", "author": "Serena J."}

It is a definite hike up the stairs, but worth it.  The view itself is obviously easy to appreciate, but I was also drawn to the general atmosphere and mix of people who were also there to enjoy the view: a young couple, some families, and a nice looking group of friends in their 30's who plopped down with a case of Sierra Nevada's to enjoy the sunset.  Would definitely recommend coming here for a date.", "author": "J B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-31", "description": "I lived within half a mile of this place for a year somehow without realizing that it even existed.  When you are climbing up the HUGE staircase to the top of the hill it gets progressively more and more windy and it totally took me off guard how ridiculously crazy the wind blows up there. Yes the wind really sucks, but the 360 degree view of the city totally makes up for it...you can see all of ocean beach on a clear day as well as the golden gate bridge and pretty much all the rest of San Francisco.  Usually there aren't too many tourists up top or anyone in general which makes it a great place to kind of relax and just take in the views while sitting on the single bench they have there.  If you live in the sunset and haven't been here, you really have to check it out....one of the few cool things you can do for free in SF that is actually worthwhile in my opinion.", "author": "Isaac W."}

My friend, and I stumbled upon this place when we drove across the city one day, exploring different neighborhoods along the way.  Man,! what a hike up the hill; my feet were not killing yet, than god.!  Then, I could not believe the long flights of stairs that we had to climb.  I guess I had a a slight fear heights, being visually impaired and not being able to see everything as well.  But, we made up, a little tired and taken away by the breathtaking views of the City and the entire bay area.  I thought that it was a small greenbelt, but my friend pointed out that it was long and narrow and we ended up walking out a ways.  It was breathtaking listening to the sites and sounds of the city down below.  It is a very tranquil setting to go to to lose yourself  for a while and take a break from the hustle and bustle of the city.  We were up there for a while and the multiple flights of stairs did not mean a thing anymore.  We made it down safely and were both a little tired, especially after having to walk back down to the bottom of the hill.  It was well worth the effort.  We will definitely have to come back here for a picnic and a sunset.  This, like all San Francisco parks, will be around for years to come.  Keep up the good work City of San Francisco.!", "author": "Brian S."}
