I loved that they have a location on Valencia and that you can pop by for a nice cup of tea. The only sad thing is the limited seating available inside, but once you have a seat along the wall, it's great. I sat there for a while reading my book and it was just lovely.\n\nThey have an insane selection of tea at all price points, and all different types. I can't remember exactly what I ordered right now, but because it was iced, it took a little longer than I expected. They steep the tea for you and then ice it accordingly so that it never really oversteeps - although I sometimes think steeping times are a bit of a personal preference if you've had enough experience with teas. As a result, I felt my green tea was slightly on the oversteeped side of things, and I would like to return to try something different. I find black teas a little more forgiving, especially when iced.\n\nThe tables are quite tiny so it's unclear to me how you'd eat anything you order here but people seem to manage so it must be just me. If I'm ever in the Mission again, I'd go back to try more teas!", "author": "SY C."}

I was craving boba and saw they offered matcha latte with boba and got excited since I love matcha. I guess I had high hopes for this spot but the boba was on the harder side and I like my boba chewy and soft. It also wasn't sweet enough for me and I'm the type of person who asks for 25 or 30% sweet.  The matcha latte itself was ok. It wasn't memorable and had more of a milky taste than matcha. I will definitely be getting my boba fix elsewhere but I would go back to give their regular tea drinks a try!", "author": "Valerie T."}

The chai tea and truffle avocado toast are to die for! Samovar is charmingly decorated, featuring a small sales section of modern tea ware and bags of tea. Standing out the most are the large brass pots in which the staff brew the chai tea, filling the place with a rich aroma. Once you order the chai tea, they scoop out the tea with large spoons! The place seems like a modern apothecary in that they put (what I think is) tea leaves in test tube bottles on display. A drawback in the layout is that there is very limited seating and low tables on which to put your food. They should really invest in tables to encourage people to order food... I had to sit outside in a public sitting space.\n\nThe chai tea is rich and flavorful, unlike many of the other such teas I have drunken before. I love the creaminess and the force of dairy in the tea, which might not be everybody's preference though... The truffle avocado toast is an excellent deal because it also comes with two poached eggs and a very generous amount of (I think boiled) mixed greens on the bottom. It is a delicious dose of several vitamin and minerals!! I love avocado, toasted white bread, truffle oil, and mixed greens, which makes Samovar's dish absolutely perfect!!!", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

My barista was a masterful salesperson, which I respect, and he suggested the Shibumi Matcha bowl. This was a mistake on my part. \n\nI also thought a matcha scone would taste good, but it did not. Do not get it. The barista was incredibly kind and let me taste the scone before purchasing it, which was lucky, and I am really thankful. \n\nThe Shibumi Matcha bowl cost $7, and was an unsweetened matcha tea with notes of rice, sweet potato, and green hay. It tasted like warm grass, and I wished I had ordered a chai tea latte or even a matcha tea latte that would have cost $4.50 or $5. \n\n(There is a ceremonial importance to the matcha bowl, hence the hefty price.)\n\nThe matcha scone was very strange.

Fans of the more atmospheric teahouses at Yerba Buena Gardens and the shuttered one in the Castro may be bummed that they can't order the three-tiered English service platter of quiche and finger sandwiches. But you can still get a scone here and a variety of toasts, and those may be the only food items they sell here. If you ask me (and even if you didn't), this was the economically sound thing for Samovar to do.\n\nAnd frankly I'm not a pinkies-up-type of teetotaler who needs to wear my derby and ascot to drink a cup of tea.

It frankly looks and feels a lot more like a Blue Bottle than a Lovejoy's, and you order from a rather extensive menu that is vertically placed as you walk through the door. I tried the rather premium-priced $7 Saffron Rapture with \"notes of saffron, quince, apple, and citrus\" (photo: http://bit.ly/2zNXAKE).\n\nIt was quite tasty though I'm used to getting a Venti Peach Tranquility for $2.65 at Starbucks because I'm common I is.

I took advantage of the adjacent parklet to sip it because it was a bit too hot for me to drink and walk at the same time.

It was flavorful with so many spices. It is easy to tell this was special. \n\nThe venue is very cool. White stone bench inside and a few stools allow a small number of people to enjoy their drinks inside. There is also some seating outside on the street. The high ceiling, the less is more type of interior design, and the ceramic looking mugs lined up on the wall behind the bar are trendy. \n\nMy disappointment was not about the tea but the operation. I asked for a mug to enjoy my chai inside and was told that mugs were being washed and only paper cups were available. It doesn't look like that there is a lot of seating inside and outside to begin with and everyone inside were drinking from paper cups. This is something that never happens next door at Four Barrel. I got my cup and started looking for seating. That's when I realized the place feels so spacious (although the space is small) because the layout allows a lot of space for the ordering line and the bar but not for customers to sit down. I would understand if the establishment chooses to be a take-out kind of place. That could work with coffee but with tea, I expect to be able to enjoy it rather than being forced out.

The tea is also way too expensive, especially for the chai which is premade and then poured into a pretty brass pot for the \"looks\" of authenticity.\n\nMore negatives - I ordered 2 vegan chais from here recently, and got lids that did not seal around the edge. It wasn't one of those \"maybe it's sealed but actually then it pops off because it wasn't really sealed\" situations. It was a \"tightly closed on the cup, but not quite tight enough because liquid was spilling over the edges anyway\".\n\nWhich makes it difficult to ride an uber, walk around, or do anything other than sit in the shop -- except there aren't really any seats there, or it's not designed as an inviting place to sit and lounge.\n\nI felt terrible for my lyft driver and had no option but to let the tea just continue spilling into my lap and my purse, instead of his car.

Beautiful and quality cafe for tea lovers! Seems like their speciality is chai. They have copper pots brewing all day and it smells lovely. This is my favorite cafe in SF.\n\nThe interior is pretty tasteful, and there's a bunch of white ceramic cups lining the wall with some nice lighting. Seating is limited to a side bench against a wall and there's small wooden coffee tables to set your drinks on. This spot seems more like a grab and go type cafe.\n\nMenu is pretty extensive. They have treats like egg or warm veggies (they come in mason jars!) and toasts. If you're feeling millennial, there's Truffle Avocado Toast for $13. They have gluten free sourdough too. The tea is sourced organically and imported and you can really taste the quality. Drinks will run you around $4-5, and the menu is a bit pricy but it's worth. At the counter they have a huge selection of cute (but expensive) mochi cakes.\n\nThis place is related to the Samovar Tea Lounge in Soma but I feel like it hardly compares. The food is really mediocre there in my opinion. \n\nEAT\n\nEgg Jar - Sous vide egg, smoked salmon, organic brown rice, sauerkraut, furikake, sesame oil, soy sauce. Cute food concept, pretty good to munch on. I mostly got it because of the aesthetic. There's a little too much soy sauce.\n\nTruffle Avocado Toast - Avocado, sous vide eggs, white truffle oil, salt, butter, pepper. A bit on the expense side for $12 but this is a pretty filling dish. Comes with cooked spinach in a pretty interesting dressing. It's a bit on the salty side so I recommend balancing it out with a sweet toast.\n\nMiso Tahini Toast - Housemade miso tahini spread, furikake. The toasts are thick and tasty! I personally liked the saltiness of the tahini spread it was pretty unique. Came with nice toasted rice puffs on it.\n\nMake sure to look out for their toast & tea specials. The Strawberry & Rye Toast is popular here.\n\nCashew Cardamom Toast - Pan de mie toast, butter, cashew-cardamom almond butter, Maldon salt. Amazing almond butter that tastes similar to chai flavor because of the cardamom. The portion for the butter is generous and it was finger lickin' good! \n\nCinnamon Maca Toast - Similar to the Cashew Cardamom but with a slight difference in taste.\n\nMatcha Mochi Cake - Pretty good, nothing too special. They're small and bite sized so try some different flavors if you can.\n\nCHAI & LATTE\n\nTraditional Masala Chai Latte - Made really well!

While I thought an average meal or tea experience was on the pricier side of things, I thought the quality of their loose leaf teas was top notch (and the food items were tasty and uniquely created). In recent years, some of their older locations closed, and I decided to check out this Valencia Street location while I was in the Mission. \n\nMy friend and I were both eager to try their Masala chai, and boy, did the employee working at the front keep us waiting. There was neither an acknowledgment when we got into the line or even some brief statement explaining why he spent several long minutes chatting with a person who seems like a close friend (their extended goodbye made it clear that they were quite tight). If I hadn't agreed to treat my friend to some tea, I would have bounced as soon as I noticed that good customer service was not on the menu that day. \n\nWe finally ordered our chai, which was scalding-I guess what they lack in expediency they make up for in heat. The chai was OK, but the texture was impacted by the occasional milk skin pieces that likely formed from overheating. The rest of the service staff seemed quite lackadaisical, and the presumed manager appeared to be more interested in socializing than running his cafe. \n\nMaybe this Samovar branch is for people with an expanded definition of service and tea quality, but I'm pretty sure I won't be back in the future.", "author": "Keith H."}

It is absolutely one my favorite places when visiting San Francisco. I was really excited when my daughter booked a facial for my birthday at This Magic Life and I was scheduled to be in the area one hour before my appointment. \n\nI walked in to see that this was just a to-go place and there was public outdoor seating and stadium style seating to the side. Everything was still beautiful! The signature teas were steeping in beautiful copper pots which are best for conducting heat. The cashier offered me a sample of their signature Masala Chai but it wasn't what I thought it was. I decided to order a Matcha Latte since they use premium Matcha powder and one of the most popular items, \"Eggs in a Jar.\" I thought this was San Francisco's version of Eggslut. The eggs in a jar were two perfectly sous vide eggs on top of organic brown rice, sauerkraut and smoked wild salmon sprinkled with furikake and soy sauce and sesame oil. I could have done without the soy sauce and the salmon was only like a tablespoon worth. It was expensive at over $10 even though it came with a Ball mason jar! The green tea latte was $5 and very bland and came lukewarm. It was a surprisingly unsweetened but went well with the eggs in a jar. \n\nI don't mind spending $$ on amazing food but I spent close to $20 for a mediocre breakfast.

In Japanese tea ceremony, a traditional bow is both before and after consumption.  The Matcha Bowl which cost $22 is the highest grade matcha.  Looking at matcha green tea through the recycled glass soup bowl after a couple of minutes is like seeing a hot tub sauna.  Spinning the soup bowl is tough since it's made of glass; ceramic should be much easier.  As for the most expensive matcha, I'm glad it's not more bitter like the one from Asha Tea House.\n\nSweet milk tea should be the same as HK style milk tea.

Best to ask if they are freshly made for that day. \n\nThe design of the place is ingenious with a middle counter that serves as a hangout counter to place one's tea for the standing crowd and a divider of the waiting crowd vs. already served crowd. A bi-level long sitting section is against the wall to create symmetry and division at the same time.

Sadly, my experience was somewhat ruined by a few things:\n\n- the grumpy pill that every staff member must have taken before coming to work. Is it too much to ask for a smile? Or to at least appear like you give a damn? After admitting it was my first time, the staffer didn't even bother so much as a \"welcome\" and continued to respond to my questions as if I was a total idiot. At one point, I even felt compelled to apologize for having questions. That in itself is enough for me to not come back. \n\n- the avocado toast was well-priced and I loved the gluten free SRSLY Sourdough bread option! While I was impressed they used Maldon Salt, there was none to be found. I returned to ask for some and realized why I couldn't taste anything -- they are using a salt shaker for the salt. Everyone who uses Maldon knows, you have to crush the coarsely chunky salt between your fingers to get the full taste benefits of this lovely salt. Eating my toast was like a Russian Roulette of taste -- some bites had a chunk of salt, most did not. Sad face. \n\n- my order was for here but both my chai and my toast were served in crappy takeout containers. On that note, the lids to their coffee cups don't fit well and I witnessed many people (including myself) struggling to make them fit without leaking. \n\n- the chai was very nice ... once it cooled down to a normal hot drink temperature. I love the presentation of the big copper pots but perhaps they need to have better monitoring of the temps. I burned myself with the first sip and it took 15 minutes before I could actually drink it. \n\nAll in all, this place could be great but it needs new or improved staff/company culture and some minor logistical adjustments.

It was mildly sweet even without sugar and without the flavour of the Indian spices that chai has. \n\nThe place is advertised as inexpensive (single $ sign) here on Yelp, but for $5 a chai it's a lot more expensive than most other places! It has a good amount of seating and a very clean, code-locked bathroom. The service was a little slow but polite. We could taste the chai, but none of the other items on the menu.

It's fresh, it's comfortable, and very well executed. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nThe recent resurrection of the tea-specific shop has lead to a somewhat unsettling increase in the price of tea these days, and nowhere is that more clear than here at Samovar Tea. I almost did a literal double-take when I realized that my large Masala Chai was pricing out to $5.50, and while this was a generous portion (at least two cups if not two and a half), that's a pretty stupid price point irrespective of the blend of spices that comes attached to the tea. Samovar sits right on the fence of rational pricing here, and while the price wasn't enough to deter me from coming back - it was close. Star Granted, reluctantly. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nI like the bite of Masala Chai tea, but oh my goodness did this have some serious bite. As in, holy moly let me take a quick break from drinking this before I get some serious indigestion here. That doesn't mean it was at all bad, but unless you're really a fan of Masala Chai you might want to stick with something a bit safer (I'd equate this to a strong IPA in the beer world). Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nAs a tea nerd, I love the concept of Samovar Tea, and I'm glad it's popular, but on account of the price point and the product, I can't say I would strongly recommend it to friends unless I was 100% sure they were as crazy about tea as I am.

Their boba, though, now that I've had it a few times, is sadly not awesome. I'll only go to boba places that actually brew tea so that part is obviously wonderful here.

The peppermint sage herbal is also super nice, and several of there other made to order hot teas look lovely. The catch: WHOA EXPENSIVE. Not hardly a thing for vegans on their small food menu. I settled for the warm greens and rice and added avocado. $10 for probably the smallest scoop of rice and the saddest pile of wilted arugula you ever saw. They made it wrong by adding salmon (hey it happens). The girl working told me she would fix it again. I got half way through eating it and there were multiple flecks of salmon I had not previously detected. Meaning - all she did was pick it off. TOTALLY unprofessional and a huge disappointment to me or any vegan. I've also had some short tempered service here on many occasions. The place gets packed.

I ordered an Iced Green Ecstasy which is a Japanese Sencha and it came out excellent -- bright green color, no astringency, yet still had that grassy flavor that I love about Sencha. Very refreshing. \n\nI'm curious to see how consistent the quality is, because other tea places vary from day to day and from staff to staff. I imagine the Steampunks they use eliminate most human error (it's app controlled) so I have high hopes. \n\nThe single thing that bothered me was a lack of a bigger serving. Granted, tea is an experience to be savored, not devoured like some venti Starbucks nonsense, but I frequent David's tea daily by my work and receive larger servings for the same price. \n\nI guess they could have a bigger menu too, but I think they hit all the important spots with solid options. \n\nI will return here.

I used to regularly give their loose leaf tea as gifts. I have found the quality of the Mission location, though, to be a little inconsistent. This place is always crowded. I've gone in a little before closing and gotten a chai that wasn't very hot. I stopped by again last week, and they had just added the milk/cream to the pot before serving. It wasn't quite as strong and spicy as I'm used to, and tasted heavy on the milk. Not sure if that was because it was not stirred completely, or just hadn't brewed long enough. The cooper vats of the chai are charming, but with their pricing, I expect something more consistently delicious.", "author": "M T."}

And when I try a new place out that i'm excited for, I want to expect to have at least a decent experience here. We walked inside super excited, knew what we wanted, and all you see are the 4 workers with literally no facial expressions. Just 4 blank, emptied faces. We were ready to order so we waited until one of the workers noticed us. The one blonde woman working there came up behind the tea bar and did not even say a thing. She stared at my friend  expecting her to just say her order and when she dis, she then just looked over at me and said nothing. Assuming she was going to take my order too, i happily said my order and all she said was \"sure\" blatantly and quickly turned over. HOW FREAKIN RUDE CAN YOU POSSIBLY BE. We thought maybe it was just her that was having a bad day, so one of the other workers rang up our order and he also had no expression on his face. It was a nice cute tea place with crappy faceless workers. My friend and I ended up tipping them both cause we just figured out of consideration to them having a bad day. As we wait for our food, my friend sees that the lady has made our food and put it on top of the counter w/o saying whether it was ours or not. She goes to the back, comes back, and my friends decides to ask if it is our food, the worker said yes without even looking up or acknowledging her whatsoever. She then asked my friend if we need utensils with her monotone voice, WITHOUT looking up still and pouring her freakin tea. When my friend says yes, she looks up at her  like this, -__-  and also asks, \"to go?\". WELL NO FREAKIN SHIT, we have food in jars, of course we're getting it to go. Not only was it just their attitude, but their diligence in just putting an effort into serving us. The worker leaves the bar, brushes past by me and does not even apologize, she literally drags her feet not trying to find utensils for us fast enough. Instead, she's moping around, SLOWLY BUT SURELY finding us some utensils. After that, Right when we are 5 ft away from leaving, one of the guys just suddenly got happy and wishes us a nice day. AND WE SAW THE ONLY LADY WORKER LAUGHING AND BEING FLIRTATIOUS AFTER WE LEFT. IT WAS SO UPSETTING TO HAVE SUCH A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE THERE. Yes, their chai tea and food in a jar was good; although she was being skimpy on the salmon. But customer service really matters to me esp if it's your first time somewhere.

My friend had ordered a green tea matcha shake, which came out nearly immediately. After 5 minutes of waiting, I inquired the whereabouts of my green tea, of which the worker replied that it was still steeping. I watched my cup sit there on the back counter for at least another 4 minutes \"steeping.\" Finally, the timer goes off. I go over to pick up my cup of tea, and as soon as I tasted it, I knew it was over-steeped because it was simply too tannic.

White stone walls with little to no decorations. It's the kind of place I would grab my tea and move along.

Call me crazy, but I think tea kind of sucks. I want to like it, but I just...don't. So, I was pleased to see they had chai, which is occasionally pretty good - and bonus, they even have vegan chai! It certainly fell into my category of \"pretty good,\" which by anyone else's tea standards would surely be delightful.\n\nThe space is terrible for relaxing - I think there's just one bench along the back wall.

Have it hot or cold, vegan or with whole milk - simply amazing any way you have it. It is made from scratch with a bag of herbs and is warmed in a big pot on a stove. I'm also known for being addicted to their rosy palmer which is a fancier more delicious version of the Arnold palmer (+rose water!) \n\nTheir staff is warm and friendly and they all give excellent customer service. They never seemed stressed or rushed, which is a relief first thing in the morning. One of their employees, Saul, goes above and beyond in his customer service. It seems like he has made friends with everyone on the street. There are times when I go by just to chat with him, and I'm usually not the only one. \n\nThe space itself is simplistic yet beautiful.

It's not a huge space but it seems to be poorly designed, even taking that into consideration.\n\nAs another reviewer has pointed out, some of the teas/chais come pre-sweetened and they are too sweet. Why not let people sweeten themselves to taste?\n\nAlso be aware of the short hours -- they close at 7pm every day of the week.

When she did tell me the price, she was so fast, muttering the price under her breath, that I could not even get it.  I gave it another try and said I was looking for tea to go and prepare at home, she told me they did not sell matcha like that, but there was a bag of matcha right there, ready to buy and take home.

They brew the tea leaves using some fancy brewer that injects bubbles and warm water into the clear brewing chamber. I'm sure you can Google how they actually work. I got the matcha and it was relatively smooth and tasty. One can pick up hints of wheat and other aromas. Serving temperature was on point, not too hot otherwise tea leaves burn and give off misleading aromas. Price point is slightly on the higher end for me, but then again this may be normal for a traditional tea brew house. We don't have a place as elegant as this in SJ, mostly Vietnamese boba tea houses. The mission is a trendy spot, especially near 16th streets and so forth, very artistic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-28", "description": "walked into this place awhile back and really didn't understand what was happening or why you would have a tea place so cold and uncomfortably designed. nowhere to actually sit and drink tea...true intent of having tea.  i asked for recommendations and she really didn't know much about the options, so tried something that tasted very absynthy or earthy.   i get that the mission is changing, but this may be the crossroad establishment...if this place succeeds, then the mission has morphed into something else and i better start foraging for leaves and learn botany.", "author": "Roy N."}

I did not try any of the chais or any of their food but it looked and smelled good. Didn't catch the name of the man who helped me but he was very nice and knowledgeable!! will definitely be coming back to try some more teas and food.", "author": "Mary C."}

The only problem with the Valencia location is that its not convenient for sitting or relaxing. No tables or chairs just benches (I would have rated it as a 5 otherwise).", "author": "A N."}
