We arrived as a party of four on a Saturday night around 6 PM, and we were seated immediately. We got the crispy vegetable spring rolls, regular XLB, seafood gyoza, Beijing noodles, and trio of buns, all which were delicious, plus my favorites: \n\n- Shrimp toast: This is essentially the long Chinese donut (the one you normally eat with jook) with shrimp baked into it. The donut was crispy and the shrimp reminded me of that which you'd find in the fried shrimp ball at dim sum spots. It's drizzled with a sauce that is reminiscent of sriracha mayo. \n\n- Lamb dumplings: I can't decide if these dumplings or the tom yum XLB were my favorite of the night. If you love lamb, you will love these. Each fat dumpling is stuffed with ground, flavorful lamb. It comes with a sauce that is similar to soy sauce (unless it actually is). So delicious! \n\n- Tom yum XLB: The real winner of the XLBs is the tom yum XLB. They're a deep red/maroon color, and wow, the flavor of tom yum is definitely there. It was such a trip for me but in the best way. It was my boyfriend's and friend's favorite dish of the night. Made us wonder all the different soups you can transform into XLB!\n\nAll in all, I was super satisfied with my dinner here. Everything was delicious. It's a super trendy environment full of millennials, haha. I would definitely come back and probably order everything that I had this time. Can't wait to go back :)", "author": "Daisy T."}

Wasn't completely filled with soup. I'd definitely say I've had better. Had to request Ginger as it didn't come standard. It was minced/grated vs cut into thin matchsticks. \n\nSeafood potstickers: great presentation but the skins were thin and soggy; when picking up with chopsticks the skins broke. Flavor was good and the fusion dipping sauces were spot on. \n\nShrimp and pork shu mai: solid; nothing amazingly mind blowing about them. I still think Koi Palace does a better version. \n\nChar sui bao: delicious! Probably the best item we ordered. \n\nGreen tea milk buns: matcha flavor wasn't very strong in the buns, the creamy milk center was delicious. \n\nDecent overall but for the prices I'd rather be at Koi Palace.", "author": "Vicky L."}

You would think the stuff would be growing in the streets here, but I'm sorry to say it's been spotty at best for decent to good dim sum.\n\nI've been high and low and everywhere in between this town and I wrestle with the fact the stuff I can get in Colorado tastes better, get more of it and at a better price than anything I've tried in the Bay Area and going out to Richmond as well.\n\nMoving on, this place caters more to the hip tech business crowd. No big families or aunties yelling for the next cart to come along. It's a nice modern space, slightly sterile but still comfortable.

Went here for breakfast/ brunch on Saturday. Make sure you get there before noon otherwise there will be a wait. The staff is extremely friendly and they are very attentive. They have communal tables and outdoor seating.\n\nMy favorites were the green beans, pork and shrimp sui mai, and shrimp toast! The shrimp toast was really interesting- Chinese donut with shrimp on top. Crispy and savory! The gyoza were surprisingly delicious as well- they make them the traditional way so they are connected.\n\nThey serve tea in individual servings so everyone can choose a different tea. They have a good assortment. \n\nThe XLB are flavorful but I don't prefer the aluminum trays that it comes in. Make sure you carefully transfer the XLB to your spoon before eating.\n\nThe dumplings have good flavor but the skin was a little too thick to my liking. The plating was perfection- love the colors of the and micro greens that top the dish.\n\nEnded with the egg yolk bun that was good but not oozing egg yolk like my favorite place!

While it seemed like we would be waiting forever, the wait staff does a good job of getting diners in and out in a timely fashion.  Our wait time was about 20 minutes.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nSHRIMP TOAST - so good we ordered 2 servings! It was so flavorful and the toast/donut part was light! It didn't make you feel overly full.\n\nGAN BAN NOODLES- noodles were soft/ chewy and deifnitely fresh! The peanuts gave it a nice crunchy texture.\n\nLOBSTER SUI MAI- Really good! Must order!\n\nPORK XLB- What I had been waiting to try. There's nothing like it that I've tasted! Soup inside a dumpling?!  I had to get directions from my friend on how to eat it, but the red wine/sauce that it came with was good! I didn't like that it was a tad bit hard to take out of the tin, but if you did it carefully and slowly, you would have success and eat it properly! I think I could have eaten all 6 pieces myself!\n\nCHICKEN BAO- I loved that it was pan seared. However, I think this was my least favorite dish. It was too doughy for me. \n\nSHRIMP HAR GOW: Nothing special about this dish either. I could get it from my local dim sum place. There wasn't much taste from the filling inside.\n\nOverall if I were to come back, I'd just order the shrimp toast and the XLB.\n\nService was super fast! I felt like our waiter was dashing from table to table. And whenever we'd need something or wanted to order more food,  he was gone from our table before the last word came out of our mouths. LOL!\nGuess I know why they can get people in and out of there!\n\nCool spot to see them actually making the dumplings, if you wanna watch them.", "author": "Mimie L."}

Clean place with good service and bao's that melt in your mouth and disappear in seconds! \n\nGot the pork bao, bbq pork bao, garlicky green, trio, and siu mai (And also a trio to go but shhh).\nthe green beans were very garlicky out the ouside with a nice crunch! Super yummy and it was presented nicely too! Siu mai, though not my go to for dimsum foods had a nice skin, juicy on the inside, and big pieces of shrimp. The baos came out steaming hot (got the steamed version as opposed to the pan fried) and the dough was soft, a bit sweet, and wrapped the filling so nicely. Between the bbq and regular pork, I'd say the tangyness of the bbq beats the light hint of ginger-y bao. Both nice and juicy though!! \n\n\nThere was the trio of bao with egg custard filling, the beet and taro filling, and green tea with condensed milk filling. Out of the 3 (though again, all were good) the consistency of the taro was the best. It was a bit thicker in filling and had some texture so it. It also had the faint but noticeable taste of taro, very yummy!! \n\nWill def be back to try the noodles and shrimp toast.", "author": "Linde H."}

Beautifully presented and equally delicious!\n\nDecently sized restaurant with a fun vibe and entertaining where you can watch the kitchen staff prepare dumplings from a window- just like Din Tai Fung. Good music, neon lights, and Kpop MV play on the projector giving the place a karaoke/lounge nightlife feel.\n\nPork Xiao Long Bao - different from the traditionally made XLB that's served on top of napa cabbage in a steam basket, these are individually placed in aluminum cups. A bit small, but still soupy with a good morsel of minced pork mixture on the inside. Delicious with ginger, black vinegar and soy dipping sauce. An order comes with 6 dumplings.\n \nSiu Mai (Shrimp & Pork) - Ground pork with shrimp encased in a wonton, fatty pork was nice and tender. Big chunks of shrimp, sweet and not fishy and the exterior of the wrapper was soft and thin. Often found Siu Mai to be rubbery and chewy at most places, but it's just right here!\n\nGarlicky Green Beans - Sauteed green beans in garlic and garnished with edible flowers. Perfectly cooked beans with just enough bite, yummy garlic, and sesame flavor. Good veggie dish to share.\n\nHar Gow - shrimp encased in a rice flour wrapper and steamed, nice chunks of shrimp but found the wrapper on this dumpling too tasteless and left more to be desired.\n\nChicken Bao (Seared) - Steamed bao filled with chicken, green onion, mushroom and ginger mixture and seared. Love the contrast of the soft, fluffy bao to the slightly crisp and roasted flavor from the searing. The chicken mixture is juicy, tender and delicious! You get 3 baos per order.\n\nTrio of Buns - a happy ending to any meal here, a trio of sweet steamed buns. Green Tea with Milk filling, Beet and Taro filling and Egg Yolk Bun. The buns are light, fluffy and come out steaming hot. Fillings are lightly sweetened and the perfect texture, a bit gelled and custard-like. Didn't know which one I liked more, but I can't stray from a good classic ... so the Egg Yolk did me in. It wasn't the best sweet steamed buns I've had but they were good!\n\nService is always on point here. Food always comes out quickly and piping hot. Never had an issue waiting too long when dining here. Price is similarly on par with that of DTF. Close to the Caltrain station and easy for Lyft/Uber drop offs. Definitely a new favorite spot of mine for dumplings and baos!", "author": "Janet N."}

Now this area is usually pretty dead, especially on a week night. Well that's not quite true at Dumpling Time where there was a line of hungry patrons waiting for a seat at this place. It was about a 45 minute wait to get seated. They should invest in a digital wait list since it's such a popular spot.\n\nKnowing this place is famous for their pork xlb, I had to give it a try. They come in a steam tray of 6 per order and do go down really quick. I mean real quick so you probably want an entire tray to yourself. We sat with a good view of the kitchen so we were able to watch the masters at work the entire time. It definitely is a skilled art that you would appreciate. The xlb is definitely delicious and I would recommend that you also order the 4 piece siu mai with it. Other clear winners were the lamb and the egg yolk bun (get that for dessert). Be sure to use the chili sauce at the table for an elevated experience. I feel like I'm having dim sum yet not quite in a dim sum environment. Know what I mean? \n\nFor a local spot, it's way easier to get here than Din Tai Fung which is outside of my acceptable driving radius for good food. As much as I would love to make the drive down there, it's just not happening. Dumpling Time will satisfy this void and I'll be happy it's here in the city. For those that don't want to wait for a table, you can order to go. It's probably better so you can enjoy the delicious dumplings in the comfort of your own home.\n\nNote the closing time of 9:30pm which is incredibly early. People already started clearing out at 9pm so be sure to put in your last order by then.", "author": "Tim G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-10-23", "description": "Located pretty much over by San Francisco's Design center area at the foot of Potrero hill and where all the freeways converge, Dumpling Time offers to Xao Long Bao (XLB): i.e. those dumplings that explode with hot soup.  The wait is resonable on a Saturday at around 2pm just prior to closing.  The service is a bit hit or miss but they do get the orders right.\n\nAlso on the negative side is the tea.  It sucks here.  Why offer expensive chinese food if your tea sucks?  Makes no sense at all.  The tea looks like it's high quality as it is presented in a container where you see the leaves and it meshes with the hot water.  But that's a mirage.  I saw some kid working on the side who was simply opening up tea bags and dispersing leaves into the tea container.  That explains the bad quality.\n\nNow to the dumplings.  Note how in the first couple of paragraphs, I was a bit negative of this place.  True, but now the positive.  Every dumpling we ordered was pretty decent.  I will add one last negative: there are two very expensive items that are too hard to pass up:  Wagyu Beef Gyoza (about $15 or so) and Lobster Shu Mai (about $17 or so).  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  They both do not taste any better than the cheaper items for sale.  The Wagyu Beef Gyoza tastes pretty much like a $2 pot sticker you can order in SF Chinatown so don't pay unnecessary foodie tuition like I did.  Ground Wagyu beef tastes no different than any other ground beef.\n\nThe Lobster Shu Mai on the other hand tastes no different than shrimp shui mai so don't bother wasting your money.  You'll save $30-$40.\n\nAll that being said, I will say, the quality of the dumplings here are very good.  So good, I'd come by again if I were in the neighborhood.  The service is off most likely because of how crowded the place is..the young'ens who work here lack the attention span to be perfect.  I will say, that if the service is improved, this is easily a 5 star place (well, assuming the tea situation is improved).\n\nThe XLB's are 4.5 star quality.  Pretty darn good but not as good as Din Tai Fung in San Jose (SIngapore, Costa Mesa, Hong Kong, etc.)", "author": "Tony U."}

We didn't have to wait too long, which was a plus. \n\nWe ordered the lamb dumping, tom yum soup dumplings, seafood gyoza, and the custard bun (trio). Keep note that the soup dumplings are more of the cantonese-style, dim su xiao long bao (not the super soupy, Shanghainese style ones). Of the three savory items, my favorite was definitely the tom yum soup dumplings. The dumplings skins were interestingly colored with red beet, and the savory, sweet-and-sour flavor of tom yum soup made the dumplings a unique taste. The seafood gyozas were delicious as well, with a nice crispy crust, and the lamb dumplings were good too (if you're a fan of lamb, since some people find it to be gamey). My favorite item of the night was the trio steamed custard buns. These were SO good!

Ambiance + Service + Food were amazing!!! \n\nHOT TEAS.\nBI LAO CHUN GREEN TEA ($3.5) - Gentle, mild sweet, fruity aroma. Presentation of my tea was absolutely beautiful served in a clear glass individual pot with full bodied fresh herbs at the bottom. The first sip was very light and definitely gentle - probably the most gentle tea I have ever had. Impressive. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nFOODS. \nYou've been warned: they don't serve rice!\n\nGARLICY GREEN BEANS ($8) -  Perfectly sauteed garlic green beans garnished with edible baby flowers. The presentation was beautiful and inviting. The green beans weren't soggy or too crispy and the garlic flavor wasn't overpowering yet present. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nSEAFOOD GYOZA (5pc/$10) - Spinach skin, crab, scallop, shrimp, with spiced chili butter. I do love seafood but not too much seafood where it's overkill. We ordered this because the server had recommended it and I was hesitant it was going to be to seafoody but it wasn't. The spinach skin helped break the seafood taste. I tasted shrimp and scallops the most of the three seafoods. I would prefer the skin to be a little bit more cooked and crisped but afraid doing so would look the bright green color of the wrapper. RECOMMEND.\n\nPORK XLB (6pc/$8.50) - Pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine. If you know me, I am a XLB snob. Their XLB was executed perfectly!!! OMG!!! Perfect thickness of the skin (not too thick and not too thin), very soft, and fragile. The meat filling was rich in flavor and there was plenty of broth. I had a foodgasm pricking a hole and sipping it's juice and then putting it wholesomely in my mouth. Yah, get that mind out the gutter.  I wish they had steamed the dumplings not in mini cupcake wrappers and found a different method, they tend to tear easily when trying to separate them. This was my favorite item at the restaurant. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nHAR GOW SHRIMP (4pc/$6.50) - shrimp, cream cheese, juicy pork. I thought this was going to be the typical Har Gow dumpling because it looked typical. But the cream cheese adds a little more creaminess to the filling. We were planning to order the Shrimp and Cilantro but this comes with a unique green cilantro dipping sauce. The cilantro flavor isn't strong in the dipping sauce but it adds that nice veggie/herb taste with the shrimp. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nBEIJING NOODLES ($9.50) - Pork, green onion, ginger, soybean paste. I've had this before and there wasn't anything too special with their take on the noodles. I did notice pork sauce was rich and hearty that we didn't need too much of this. RECOMMEND.\n\nHAPPY ENDINGS.\nGREEN TEA & MILK BUN 3 pcs/$6.50 - Such a sweet treat at the end of a delicious meal. Three steamed milk buns (green, white, red) filled with flavored custard. I think my favorite one was the white one, it had a milky vanilla filling. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.\n\nYup, I do love this place and if I ever move back I will be a regular.\n\nJABA APPROVED. Until the next bite....", "author": "Jane A."}

Wait time was pretty much as expected, came in a little after 7pm. Waited about 30-40 minutes, but trust it was definitely worth the wait! Yelpers were right about this place, service was on point and fast. Servers were friendly and so helpful. Peak times here are definitely between 6-8pm. After 830 the crowds seem to die down. Now as for the menu most of the dumpling options are $10 and under! \n\nIn LA, we usually go to Din Thai Fung for dim sum munchies. I guess in SF it's Dumpling Time! Now for the food we ordered a few things. \n\n-Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai 4pc: $6\n-Shrimp & Cilantro Har Gow 4pc: $6.50 \n-Pork XLB 6pc: $8.50 \n-Tom Yum Goong 6pc: $9.50\n-King Dum (big a$$ Dim Sum): $9\n-Trio of Buns (dessert): $6 \n\nAll of em were great! All worth a try! All worthy for posts on the gram! My personal faves were the Tom Yum because the beet skin tasted good. The King Dum was amazing and huge, you use a boba straw to slurp up the soup in the dumpling! It was so good we ordered some to go. The trio buns we got to go and yes their bomb as well!

Xiao Long Bao is one of my most favorite of foods and it's one item I can't get in Charleston, SC. Whenever I land in SFO I can hear the dumplings calling my name. I arrived at lunchtime so my first stop after dropping my bag at the hotel was finding an amazing meal.\n\nThere was a short wait but it was totally worth it. Plus, they make up for any time you wait with insanely quick service. The efficiency of ordering is great and they turn tables fast if you're looking for a speedy lunch. But the real excitement here is the food. As we perused the menu, we overheard a family next to us place theirs and inspired us on a couple items. \n\nWe were mostly interested in the XLB so we ordered a couple different types. Obviously the OG and then a variant made with beets in the dough. Both were excellent but nothing beats a classic... so we doubled down and ordered another. It's kinda nice that they come in these little foil ramekins so you don't lose your soup in prep.\n\nMake sure to indulge in more than just the soup dumplings though. We snagged an order of BBQ Pork Bao which had a perfectly fluffy outer layer and great ratio of filling inside. The flavor was excellent but another big winner was the lobster shumai with truffle oil.

Reason being, that we had our dog with us for my boyfriend's birthday, and we ended up waiting 1.5+ hours on a Thursday night for outdoor seating, due to the host messing up the waitlist and skipping us several times by accident. Angry blackout rage was happening.\n\nBUT THEN - he finally called our table, promptly apologized for forgetting our name on the extremely long waiting list, and gave us complimentary tea and salad of our choice. The service was extremely prompt and we got our food hella fast. Once we were seated, we were in and out within 35 minutes. The food itself was delicious and well priced.\n\n1. Shrimp toasts - I'm not sure what I was expecting, but based off of the mixed reviews, I knew I needed to try it. This reminded me of a chewy doughnut roll, with an embedded layer of shrimp fishcake flavor, with a drizzle of a seasoned mayo. Bad description, but it was unique, tasty, although a bit heavy to share between two people (get a group).\n\n2. Cucumber salad - this was complimentary due to the host mistake, but was refreshing. Nothing too special, but for free? I'll take the veggie hydration flavors.\n\n3. Xiao Long Bao - As others have said, this is tasty. Hot, juicy, and plump - just the way I like my men and dumplings. Jk. Not as good as Din Tai Fung, but what is?\n\n4. Green beans - Loved this. Crisp and well flavored, and you can feel less guilty about the shrimp toasts since this is a green vegetable. That's how diets work right?\n\n5. Chrysanthemum tea - floral, refreshing, and light. Non-caffeinated if you're having a late night meal.\n\n6. Pork buns - tasty! I'm usually not a fan of buns since they end up being doughy, but this was crisp on the bottom, had good meat to bun ratio, and had a flavorful porky saucy interior. There are 3 that come in one order so make sure to double it, if you have 4+ folks.\n\nOverall, great addition to the area and looking forward to coming back!", "author": "Stacy K."}

I thought it was a very clever way to work in the Chinese Donut. Not overly greasy and was a great way to start off the meal. The Sui Mai came out next, and the pork and shrimp all tasted very fresh and was steamed perfectly. No one likes saggy Sui Mai! We ended the meal with XLB, which checked all the boxes when it came to texture ( skin wasn't too thick and held little pockets of soup), but fell short when it came to flavor. The pork was still very tender but lacked that gingery kick that usually rounds out the taste of traditional XLB. \n\nI recommend Dumpling Time if you're looking for a fun, hip take on traditional dumplings, dimsum, or noodles; but feel free to pass if you're in the mood for some traditional homestyle cooking.", "author": "Josh H."}

He's the San Francisco Chronicle Food Critic that named Dumpling Time 1 of 100 places to eat in this magnificent city. \n\nAs you walk in, you'll see 2-3 people hand making their delicious dumplings, and you can't help but try and find out what's the fresh to go dumpling they're putting together, but don't worry, everything is so fresh, they're just waiting on you to order them so they can place the bamboo steamer onto their huge commercial steamer. And to manage what's on the steamer is a task I certainly wouldn't want. \n\nThis eater seats around 80, say 60 inside and around 20 outside and from the time they open, there's a line throughout the day; talk about a home run...and the hilarious thing is that the owners who came up with this concept did it for sheer entertainment. They're definitely not new to the restaurant game as two of their highly successful concepts are just around the block: Omakase (3 Michelin Stars: 2016, 2017, 2018) and Okane, a casual Sushi/Japanese Tapas place is a really popular place. \n\n5/5 Siu Mai $6.00 came in nice and hot, freshly steamed and the meat was perfectly seasoned and tender. You could tell the dish was made from fresh pork, not frozen and the shrimp had a nice fresh consistency too. \n\n5/5 King Dum $9.00 was a Xioa Long Boa but in a 3X size, and it was served with a bubble tea straw. The soup was piping hot so you'd best leave it alone for around 5 minutes before trying to sip the delicious soup from it or you'd burn the top of your mouth. \n\n5/5 Pork Gyoza $8.00 were excellent; love the presentation of this dish as it comes with the skin stuck all together; really fresh tasting and I love the crunchy bottom of the gyoza too. \n\n5/5 Pork Boa Seared $6.00 were steamed, then seared to finish off the top and bottom; the inside was filled with seasoned pork with a hint of ginger and it was absolutely amazing. One of my favorites for the night.\n\n5/5 Egg Yolk Bun $6.00 were part of the sweet selections or the \"Happy Endings\" menu; these were done perfectly with a sweet egg yolk type filling that resembles almost a egg custard tart but smoother and richer and thicker consistency. \n\nIf you sit inside, you'll see K Pop videos of your favorite group but the music isn't really loud at all; servers are all very friendly and totally with the program...I'm just wishing I had eaten here more than once to try the many other things on the menu that look so so good. \n\nFor those of you who live in the Bay Area, consider yourselves very lucky!", "author": "Ivan H."}

My friend and I decided to come here and line up before they opened (10 am) since this is still very much a trendy restaurant and it doesn't take reservations. \n\nWe were immediately seated (everyone who was in line when they opened was seated) and the server recommended that we order 2-3 items per person.  I didn't eat breakfast that morning and was a bit ravenous so we decided to order seven items to share between the two of us - shrimp and pork siumai, shrimp hagaw, pork xiaolongbao, lamb dumpling, BBQ pork seared bun, wagyu gyoza and crispy tofu.  \n\nThe relatively standard items (siumai, hagaw, xiaolongbao, Pork bun) were OK.  The wagyu gyoza was probably not the best preparation for wagyu - it doesn't really highlight the wagyu and isn't worth the buy-up. The crispy tofu was surprisingly good - I think they used silken tofu and the texture here is amazing.  Like the wagyu, the lamb dumpling was probably not the best use of this ingredient.  Seven items were definitely more than enough to get us full. \n\nOverall, this was a good meal. Service was meh but the food came out quickly. The ambiance was OK and the price is relatively affordable (including tax and tip, the above meal came out to be around $40 per person).  This felt a little like din tai fung.

If eaten immediately, the was great.  The combo of the airy donut and savory baked shrimp was delightful.  However, if eaten when the donut cooled, then it was very heavy and you can taste the oil in the donut.  The garlicky green beans were so yummy that we finished the entire bowl.  We also had the lamb dumpling.  The flavor was a bit bland for my likely; however, there was no gamey taste in the lamb.  The waygu beef gyoga was great.

That when a server walks in with some creamy hot filling...all that food, yah boy better be willing! \n\nFor all y'all who are about to quit on this review faster than Lebron James during the NBA Finals (GO DUBS!), hold up a sec. I just need to brag about how GOOD Dumpling Time was. After having wanted to visit this little dim sum eatery for months, I finally had a chance to eat here with my girlfriend. Though the prices were on the higher-end, the quality of the service and food were truly on point! \n\nUnlike most dim sum joints I've been to (both big and small), Dumpling time was unique in that it offered a bunch of creative fusion items.  Though this place had your usual Hargow and Siu Mai options for example, Dumpling Time also served dishes like their King Dum (gigantic soup dumpling) - many of which I never dreamed of seeing. Plus, they even had a couple noodles dishes for those who'd want to have something other than dim sum. And staying authentic, Dumpling Time of course had many types of hot tea. \n\nIn terms of cost, this is where Dumpling Time diverged from most \"average\" dim sum restaurants. Pretty much all of their dishes were priced on the high end. Expect to pay about $2-$3 more for things you can otherwise find somewhere else. Like, the Siu Mai was $6! I'd say this place was - at least cost wise - a mini version of Din Tai Fung.\n\nMy girlfriend and I ended up splurging and got the Beijing Noodles, Shrimp Toast, the Pork Xiao Long Bao (XLB), Siu Mai, and the Bun Trio. Here's what we thought of the experience:\n\n-- PRETTY AMAZING FOOD FOR THE COST --\nThough I'm more of a cheap a$$ who feels like low-cost dim sum is the way to go, I definitely thought that much of the food we ordered was worth it!\n\n1. Beijing Noodles (7/10): Let me start with the one that I didn't think was worth the price/hype. Although I enjoyed the soft texture of the hand cut noodles and how it contrasted with the crisp scallions, I felt like it was pretty subpar. Portion size was very small and the meat/sauce lacked flavor. \n\n2. Shrimp Toast (9/10): SO GOOD! This was pretty much your usual Chinese donut with spicy aioli sauce and shrimp filling. Crunchy, savory, and delectable experience. Could've been much cheaper ($9!!) but would get again. \n\n3. Siu Mai (9/10): One of the best I've had. Although small, each piece came out smoking, juicy, and SO FLAVORFUL! This was definitely my girlfriend's favorite.\n\n4. Xiao Long Bao (10/10): Truly on par with the ones at Din Tai Fung, Dumpling Time's XLB was AMAZING! Delicious soup, hot and juicy pork, and great vinegar dip - all ingredients of a perfect XLB.\n\n5. Bun Trio (10/10): Not one, not two, but THREE orgasmically good buns. The standard Egg Yolk Bun was so savory and satisfying, the Beet and Taro Bun was surprisingly good, and omg the Green Tea and Milk Bun was the best thing I had at Dumpling Time.\n\n-- HIGH QUALITY ATMOSPHERE --\nThough the restaurant space was tiny, it had an amazing San Francisco vibe to it. The patio seating was so relaxing, there was a nice breeze going, and the background music added a nice punch. I just loved how the the place was in a random street too!\n\n-- FAST, ACCOMMODATING SERVICE -- \nLoved the workers here! They were friendly, allowed us to move to a different table, AND brought out our food SO FAST! We pretty much came and left within 40 minutes.\n\n-- CONVENIENT LOCATION --\nProbably one of the best perks about Dumpling Time besides everything above was the spot itself. It literally only took us around like 15 minutes to walk here from the 4th and King Caltrain Station and so it really wasn't a detour to come here. Plus, the restaurant was very close to the freeway. \n\nTo me, Dumpling Time is one of those places where you should eat at if you want something beyond the normal dim sum experience. As a fusion eatery, it truly blends together all the flair of the city with the scrumptiousness of traditional dim sum. Although this place is pricey, I still think it is worth a try. I give it a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. If anything, come and then tell your friends you got a small taste of Din Tai Fung in the city!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Still-crisp Garlicky Green Beans were on par with others restaurants & not overly sauced. \n\nI liked the Cilantro & Shrimp Har Gow a little less than the Shrimp version; the twist is there is cream cheese & pork in these steamed dumplings. Shrimp Toast, a Chinese donut with minced shrimp & spicy aioli, was addictive. Steamed Chicken Bao were amongst the best tasting I've had. Crispy Sesame Tofu Squares were soft on the inside & had a five spice type seasoning. Pork XLBs were soupy enough, but I'm intrigued by the King-Dum, an XLB so large, the menu claims \"you'll need a straw!\" \n\nThe items I ordered for the table but didn't try -- Seafood Gyoza w/ shrimp, scallops, & crab, BBQ Pork Bao, Main Lobster Siu Mai, & Beijing Noodles -- were all hits. \n\nDessert, called \"Happy Endings\" (truer words were never spoken), were so sweet & delicious, I wanted an order of three all to myself! Both the Egg Yolk Bun & Green Tea & Milk Bun had ample fillings. \n\nOur family dim sum breakfast came out to about $145.

They kept breaking which is a no no, but the meat was tender!\n-Trio Bao. OMG. I want more!!!!!!! So simple but so yum.\n-Pork noodle. Disappointing. Bland noodles.\n\nAlso, when they say share a table, they really mean share a table. Like a small table square table for four with two couples.! One of which was on a first date. Slightly awkward that my elbow was basically touching his elbow. Do we talk to them too? Do we sit facing each other or side by side? Wait why aren't they eating their food.

Amazing, I've always wanted to try soup dumplings made with a different type of soup.

Not the most amazing, best dumplings I've ever had in my life, but it's pretty good.  Came 11:30am on a Sunday and got seats 10 min after signing in.\n\nVenue / Service: clean and bright on the inside, though it does feel cramped.  We sat nearby the kitchen and the servers were moving so quickly past each other that some glassware fell and broke. The kitchen is open so you get to see them making the dumplings which is cool to watch!  \n\nFood: it's pretty much all about the dumplings, so be prepared to carb-load a bit!  Would probably limit the number of baos if you don't wanna get full too quickly.\n-- CHICKEN BAO seared (Chicken, green onion, mushroom, ginger)(3pcs/$6) - decent amount of filling inside vs. wrapper, and it was quite tasty!  Love the green onion and ginger to brighten up the otherwise heavy filling.  \n\n-- PORK XLB (pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine)(6pcs/$8.50) - hard to go wrong with XLBs but these were quite good.  The wrapper is super thin, so be careful of breaking them when you are trying to take them out of the container.  Soup was nice and light yet savory, and the pork had a nice texture.  \n\n-- KING-DUM (1pc/$9) - pretty much is the equivalent of 6 of the smaller XLBs.  The wrapper is quite thick, unlike the regular XLBs and you have to poke a hole in it with your straw so that the filling / soup inside will cool (which took quite a while).  There's a LOT of filling so keep this in mind if you are ordering other dishes.  Overall, I think I preferred the smaller XLBs in terms of easiness to eat, but it's a fun dish to try.  \n\n-- Three-sum dessert buns (green tea / milk, beet / taro, and egg yolk)(3pcs/$6) - our favorite was the egg yolk flavor-wise, though the beet taro combo was an interesting one.  The green-tea / milk one was slightly on the sweeter side for us, but appreciated how these had a decent amount of filling vs. the wrapper.  \n\nAll in all, this isn't the absolute best dumplings I've had, but they are higher on my list.

Highly recommended! Don't worry about the beet skin if you're not a beet fan- it doesn't taste like beets!! The skin is not as delicate as the ones at my favorite place for XLB, but you can't have everything in life, can you? \n\n-chicken gyoza: the texture for gyozas here is incredible!!! There is a crispy layer on the bottom and a kinda spicy seasoning on top. The chicken and mushroom filling is amazing too. Get these!\n\n-pork bao: perfectly pan-fried and delicious filling. Recommended, unless you already have other bready items. This+the shrimp toast+two other dumpling dishes can be a lot for two people (oops did we order all that for two people?)\n\n-shrimp toast: this item is very popular on yelp, and rightfully so. I would say it's an absolute must if you're in a group of 3-4 so everyone can have a piece instead of multiple pieces- tends to fill you up a lot, and remember, you have many other types of delicious dumplings to try! \n\nXi'an dumplings: we got the pork ones and boyfriend LOVED them. Apparently these remind him of dumplings he had in NY. If you like boiled dumplings, these are pretty legit. The thick wrapper is just not my top favorite dumpling.\n\nBeijing noodles: much like the rest of the menu, they only have two options- pork and veggie. The pork noodles comes with minced pork over handpulled noodles and it's quite good. Pro tip (from our server): use the little bowls they give you for the noodles. It's a lot easier to eat the tiny bits of pork out of a bowl that you can pick up and put really close to your face :)", "author": "Debika M."}

But tbh, it's slightly overpriced and the portions are small. Food is good but nothing special.\n\nI was committed and I braved through the rain so I can try the food here. \nUpon arrival, I was super excited to try the food, hoping it'll be what I imagined for it to be...but reality can be disappointing or just a tad bit.\n\nThis place wasn't bad but just overly hyped for what it truly is. \n\nThe foods that I tried were:\n-Jumbo XLB: fun concept and great for IG story but in reality, once you pop in the straw then the juice leaks out from the bottom. You either have to suck fast or it'll leak. A tip is just it cool down a bit then go at it. If you attack it too fast then you'll end up with a burn mouth and tongue.\n-Pork XLBS: they were good but nothing special.\n-Shrimp Dumplings: One of my favorite items. \n-Bun trio(sweet): I loved the custard one. Second to that the matcha/green tea one. My least favorite was the beet and taro one - a weird combo and I personally don't care bout it.\n\nThere are so many dumpling places so this place doesn't really stand out.

My friend and I curated an itinerary of notable SF places for a day adventure, and Dumpling Time was the perfect way to kick it off ^_^\n\nWe got here a bit early (10:40am). Plenty of metered parking around the area. We parked a few blocks away, but the walk over is pretty cool-- I'm not familiar with SF districts, but Dumpling Time is situated in something of an interior design hub, with countless hip furniture stores to peruse while we waited for them to open.\n\nService here is great! Our server was very kind and attentive, always checking up on us. A breezy Saturday calls for sitting outside, which was lovely with the heaters underneath the overhang.\n\nWe ordered three dishes to split. Call me crazy, but with so few veggie options in sight, I decided to give myself a break... It was weird trying meat again, but I found myself enjoying the dishes a lot! I swear I won't make any more exceptions LOL.\n\nTOM YUM GOONG: SOOOO delicious and savory! I loved the juicy filling and the beet skin! The pictures made it look like some of the dumpling skins were inconsistent, ranging from fire truck red to, well... chicken cutlet pink... but we got lucky and ours were this perfect, vibrant shade of red! They were gorgeous and very tasty, my favorite dish of them all. \n\nMAINE LOBSTER SIU MAI: These took 10 minutes longer than everything else, so just a heads up if you planned on doing that ~perfect  bird's eye shot~ for the IG feed-- your other dishes might get a lil cold. Otherwise super yummy! The lobster was blissfully flavorful, surprisingly filling for such small bites. I loved the floral garnish.\n\nKING DUM: This is the gimmick everyone comes for-- and tbh, this was my least favorite lol. It wasn't horrible but I think a bit overhyped. The boba straws are cute but impractical. The dumpling skin is too thick to pierce, so you'll be ripping it apart while the juice drains below the steamer basket slots-- you end up not drinking much of the soup at all )-: Also, we noticed that it seemed almost a little deflated when we got the order. When it's finally cut open there's very little filling, only small chunks in each corner of the dumpling. Still delicious but not worth it imo.\n\nThere's chili oil and soy sauce for dipping, but the dishes are so flavorful that you really don't need it! Overall a great modern twist on dim sum. I would love to take my Taiwanese parents here to see what they think ^_^", "author": "Emmeline W."}

However, our friends already helped us set expectations that Chinese food in SF isn't the best but that this place was not that bad.\n\nCame on a Wed night and there was already a bit of a wait as we did not have reso. We ordered a bunch of things off the menu and though nothing stood out in terms of \"OMG this is so good!\", the dishes are very unique. Hipster dim sum if you would. Highlights include the giant Xia long bao (XLB) you drink from a bubble tea straw and beet colored XLB with Tom yum filling which we enjoyed.

I happened to stumble on this place because I got lost and a lot of restaurants happened to be closed for the Memorial Day weekend. Interestingly enough, there were tons of people waiting to eat even though the surrounding area was empty. \n\nI decided to order 3 pieces of Chicken Bao with seared buns ($6) and 5 Chicken Gyoza pieces ($7.50). I was under the assumption that I was going to be hungry after eating both of these dishes. However, I was wrong. I felt super full and very satisfied. \n\nThe chicken bao was warm and super crunchy on the outside. The skin was thick and soft on the inside. It was not salty at all and left me wanting some more. I loved the mushrooms and how they crunched with every bite. The chicken gyoza was oily and the inside was similar to the chicken bao. \n\nThe chicken gyoza was really spicy somehow and I ended up drinking from the whole water pitcher!\n\nI plan to come back.

I don't think I would order it again though\n* Shrimp Toast $8 - Best thing here! Def memorable and unique. I've never had anything like this before.\n* Har Gow $6.5 - Most disappointing item of the night, quality was okay but the shops in outter Richmond/inner sunset taste far more superior and for half the price. \n* Beijing Noodles $9.5 - Quality noodles and you obviously taste how fresh it is. The downside is that lacks flavor, it was missing a little something to really elevate it. \n* Hot Tea Options - They bring your tea in a steeper, that's definitely a win\n\nI didn't try any of the Baos because my friends who went prior recommended that I don't, and that's what are people usually raving about. \n\nThe service here was A1, food comes out in a flash and the servers are quick to respond. \n\nAs for parking it's relatively easy in my option, lots of street parking in the area.\n\nOverall if you're coming here for dim sum, maybe pass?

Add some soy sauce and enjoy them better!\n\n5) Three-Sum (3.5/4): I really wish they have lava egg yolk bunn instead of custard ones, but hey, you cannot have everything.

It's definitely not your traditional HK dim sum place, but in a great way.  It's Asian fusion dim sum, done right with restraint.  Come early right when they open or come late.  Anytime in between is at least 1.5 hour wait.\n\nOur favorites are the shrimp toast, shrimp & cilantro har gow, seafood gyoza, char-siu bao (seared) and the Gan Ban noodles.  The shrimp toast is a remake of a traditional classic which was shrimp paste with white bread, battered and fried.  This version on the Chinese fried donut elevates it and adds a very crunchy element that pairs well with the shrimp paste.  The shrimp & cilantro har gow comes with the best cilantro dipping sauce.  It accentuates the taste of the cilantro in the dumpling without being having a too \"green\" taste.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

We came here pretty late for a Sunday evening and there was still a lot of people waiting outside! Parking is scarce on the streets and near many warehouses. It was kinda creepy getting back to our car. \n\nThe restaurant was clean, modern, pretty decent size and good for large groups. There is inside and outdoor patio seating. Their two clean bathrooms are all gender types so that was good. I would have never thought this restaurant would be in this location though.\n\nWe ordered:\n*They ran out of cucumber salad when we got there about 7:30p.\n** Make sure to mix the two sauces on the table and dip the Dim sum. I liked that better than what they give out for the gyoza and lamb dumplings.\n- Bunny Nara Sparkling Sake $18 - @7% I would think it was  little strong. It had a weird taste with sweet but still good enough\n- Garlicky green beans - was good\n- Steamed pork bao - the bread was super fluffy and pork was tasty. This was the best I have had!\n- fried pork gyoza - very soft shell and tasty pork. This tasted freshly done.\n- Steamed lamb dumplings - was tasty but shell was kinda thick and lamb was gamey. Won't order that again.\n- Shrimp & pork siu mai - very good; soft wrapper and pork was flavorful \n- King Dum - their pork soup dumplings in king size! WOW! I actually thought this would be bigger from the news article and Yelp pictures but it's a decent size. Drinking the soup before opening the wrapper was an experience just to try it!  Soup was very good. The inside pork was delicious and fresh! The wrapper was a little thick but once you open it up, it blended well.\n\nI would give this place a good solid 4 star?  Loved watching the chefs making the dumplings. You can tell what was made fresh vs frozen or a little old. Prices are decent, food and good service. Make sure to get the king-dum soup dumpling.

Pricey for the portion size. Chill atmosphere. \n\nCame here during a Friday afternoon after the lunch rush and right before their mid-day close.  We were seated right away. They have a mixture of indoor and outdoor seating but we chose the inside. I like that they have community tables.  This isn't a common thing in the states but pretty common overseas. \n\nWe ordered the pork gyoza, mamas secret recipe dumplings, XLB, sauteed garlic green beans, and shui mai. It might seem like a lot of food, but between 2 ppl we finished everything and weren't stuffed. \n\nThe pork gyoza was good. It had a nice crispy bottom that was covered in a spicy powder (the same kind used for ramen). Not sure I would order it again. \n\nThe mamas secret dumplings come in veggie or pork. We chose the pork. These were good. The filling was juicy and flavorful. Only thing we didn't understand was the stuff they threw on top. They had pea shoots, grape tomatoes, and sliced radishes as a garnishing. All of it was raw and didn't have any taste.  It was pretty but didn't add anything to it. \n\nXLB, it's their signature dish. It was average. The skin could have been thinner. I did like that all of them were really juicy. \n\nGarlic green beans was flavorful and fresh. It didn't come out overcooked or wilted. Only complaint is the price. The serving size of this dish is on the small side and the price tag was $8. \n\nThis was my favorite dish! The shui mai was DELICIOUS. It was made just like my favorite place in Hong Kong. Same flavor and consistency. While I rave about this, again only complaint is the price. Is 4 tiny pieces worth $6? A specialty dim sum place charges way less even in the city. \n\nOverall would come back if in the area, but prob not to often bc of prices and parking.

Definitely one of my favorites here \n\nShrimp toast- wish we ordered two of these, it was that good\n\nBeijing noodles- typical minced pork noodle dish, didn't taste too special to me\n\nGan Ban noodles- supposedly less popular than the Beijing noodles here but THIS NOODLE DISH WAS BOMB!! I really wonder what the sauce is made of in this dish\n\nHar Gow- a little too sticky texture . Not that exciting \n\nPork XLB- probably one of the better XLBs I've tried \n\nTom Yum Goong- THIS BLEW THE PORK XLB out of the water. I REALLY liked the flavor of these with the tom yum soup inside . Bursting with flavor \n\nKing Dum- honestly this was ordered for the picture taking. It's quite large and the flavor isn't as good as it cools down\n\nThree-sum- Green tea/milk bun, beet&taro bun, and egg yolk bun. Super cute buns to end your meal with. But my favorite was green tea. \n\nOverall this meal was quite pricy ($180 after tip for the 5 of us) but my future in-laws seemed content .

I finished my wine when my buddy showed and we walked back across the street to see where we were on the waitlist. It hadn't moved much since I left.

I really liked the pork dumplings and Tom yum goong, and the pesto-like sauce that came with the har gow. So unique! Flavors were all great, but I felt like the dumpling erred on the small side -- if I'm paying ~$6 for 4 pieces of har gow, I expect them to be bigger than what they turned out to be. Overall, it felt more catered to the non-asian community, in that it was pricier and ordered a la carte vs directly from the cart. \n\nThe King Dum was most disappointing since it was very difficult to share and the wrapping was a bit too thick on top, but too thin towards the bottom, making the overall experience underwhelming.

Vegetarians, there's also a few things for you.  \n\nThe winner of the night was the shrimp toast ($8) which was chopped shrimp on a Chinese donut.

We were disappointed with the dumplings.  We ordered pork xiao long bao ($8.50, 6 pieces) which is made with pork belly and placed in little tins.  Though the contents were tasty, my xlb stuck to the tin and as carefully as I peeled back, my xlb tore and out came the soup.  We also ordered the famous kingdum ($9 each) which is a giant xlb served with a boba straw to suck out the soup.  Because of the size, the kingdum will take about 20 minutes to come out.  Not sure why we needed a straw because the soup was scarce.  Beware, it takes a bit to cool down.  \n\nThose with peanut allergies: beware of their homemade hot sauce on the table.  There isn't a warning so I put a few scoops on my noodles before I came across something that looked like a peanut.

This was the winning factor.\n\nTrendy dumpling place that is surprisingly delicious.\nI've had a lot of different types of dumplings in my life. XLB, regular dumplings, wontons, bao zi, you name it. I lived in Beijing for 7 years, home of dumpling makers. Which pretty much makes me a dumpling connoisseur :-) \n\n* Pork XLB ($8.50 for 6) - This was what made me respect the place. I cannot emphasize enough how many places I've been to that put XLB on their menu, that end up in disappointment. This is because the skin is too thick, there is NO soup, the soup LEAKS (bad craftsmanship), the skin sticks to the plating (bad execution). NOT HERE! It is very difficult to make XLB, clearly, given my multiple attempts to find places that make them well. The meat inside was tender and soft, as it should be. Not as a ball of meat that has been separated from the skin - because there was fat and it was not overcooked! A++\n\n* Shrimp toast ($8) - I love Chinese donut or \"you tiao\" and I've never considered it as a toast. This is what I mean by trendy / hip haha. I've only had it with congee or soymilk. It was indeed very delicious with shrimp on top. Very crispy!\n\n* Pork dumplings ($9 for 8) - Standard. Good.\n\n* King Dum ($9 for a big ol' thang) - This is the what people come here for, and the pics. Of course garnished with flower petals.... who would've thunk to use a boba straw for dumpling? -snaps pics- I've actually had a large XLB with a straw before in Shanghai so it was cool to see it being offered at a restaurant in the States. Personally, not for me because the skin was too thick. But the meat inside was nice and juicy.\n\n* Chicken / pork gyoza ($7.5 / $8 for 5) - Standard. Liked that the chicken gyoza had mushrooms in it. But 5 pieces for $8?! \n\n* Gan ban noodles ($9.50) - I LOVE cold noodles. This was delish! \n\n* Three sum (dessert) ($6) - Sums out, buns out. This threesum included 1) green tea & milk, 2) beet & taro, and 3) egg yolk. All were freaking delicious. Highly recommend if you are sharing. \n\nOVERALL, I would come back. There are places in Chinatown that have these prices & the quality of food / vibes are not to this standard.

I had been wondering if it was fine to park with all the tow-away signs, but we decided it was fine because the signs did not specify which stores. After eating, we saw people removing those signs with new ones specifying the addresses (basically the office side) for which parking was allowed.\n\nI liked it. Cute and hipster. Videos playing on the wall. Bright and cheery vibe. The food was good - similar to other dimsum places. I think the King XLB is a bit of an Instagram fad - it's not as practical to eat and enjoyable as the normal bite-sized ones. The soup is scalding hot and difficult to drink through a plastic straw. I also don't like the idea of drinking boiling hot soup through plastic. It's not easy to share and the whole thing kind of breaks apart so you end up with dumpling skin and broken up meatballs with leftover soup seeping between the bamboo container to the little plate underneath.\n\nThe gyoza was satisfyingly crunchy and the stuffing was good, but it felt like it lacked that extra oomph. The Beijing noodles (Basically zhajiangmian) were great but portion was shockingly small especially considering the ingredients are not expensive. It was like an appetizer size, definitely not a full portion. \n\nI enjoyed the food and atmosphere. It's tailored to a wider audience and have helpful descriptions on the food items are on the menu. I liked that the dumplings were made fresh, unlike a lot of places that just fry frozen dumplings...as expected of a dumpling house.

Is it a Hunger Games scene? Is  this a lottery system? How does one get selected to go in? Simple: immediately add your name to the paper waitlist at the front.\n\nThis place is small, so only so many people get to go in at the same time.  It must have been a Christmas miracle because we were one of the last people to make the cut, and they do not play around!\n\nThis place makes legit dumplings and even better soup dumplings.  I've never been happy with any soup dumplings that I've tried over the years. A lot of places claim they serve it, but they tend to be dry on the inside with no soup spilling out, so you might as well just call them regular dumplings. This place though, perfection both in flavor and execution.\n\nSome of our favorites were the green beans (out of this world), lobster siu mai, tom yum soup dumpling, pork gyoza. Everything was outstanding. Food came out fast but service was somewhat slow, so I recommend placing your order all at once or you might be waiting a while.", "author": "Chanita S."}

Will definitely be coming back. \n\nFood: \nWe tried the following dishes, starting with my favorite dish:\n(1) Beijing noodles - Just all around yummy and the noodles had the chewy texture of fresh noodles.\n(2) Egg yolk bun - Just sweet enough and so fluffy. I don't enjoy desserts which are too sweet, so this hit the spot.\n(3) Garlicy green beans - Crispy and not overcooked.\n(4) Pork gyoza - Fried just the right amount so they were slightly browned and crispy on the outside.\n(5) Xiao long bao in pork and tom yum goong - I liked the pork better, but they were both well made. \n\nService: There was a bit of a wait to sit down for dinner (around 10 - 20 minutes), and you put your name on a paper list to make a reservation, but the service once seated is fast.\n\nAtmosphere: It's a sit down place, but the atmosphere is pretty casual. They have outdoor and indoor seating areas.", "author": "Michelle B."}

We sat outside and ordered the garlicky green beans, shrimp toast, King XLB soup dumpling, tom yum goong (pork belly, shrimp, coconut milk, wrapped in beet skin), Xi'an pork dumpling, and for dessert we had the trio of buns (green tea/milk bun, beet/taro bun, & egg yolk bun).\n\nThe green beans were sooooooo good. One of my friends said she wasn't going to have any because she hates vegetables but then she ended up eating it the whole time too insert eye roll emoji here.* The other thing I would recommend are the beet skin dumplings. Not sure who what when where why, but there things are delicious. The ever so hyped King dumpling I cannot give too much comment on because we were so adamant about waiting for all of our food to come out (for a photo ofc), that by the time we finally ate the dumpling, all the soup had sunk down to the bottom, so that was our fault.

My boyfriend took me out on a date night, but the original location had already closed its kitchen. Lame! It wasn't even that late. Fortunately, Dumpling Time was still open. It's even open until 9:30pm everyday! And for lunch. I know I'll be coming here many more times because of how close I live.\n\nThe only downside (and upside?) is how popular it is. We put our name down and waited outside in the cold. There was a patio area that looked nice, but it was still too chilly for my liking. It took 15-20 minutes of waiting for us to be seated at a bench in the middle of the restaurant. We had taken a look at the menu already and decided.\n\nEverything was tasty! During this meal (edit: and also a future time I visited) I tried the following items:\n\n* Garlicky Green Beans - So good but so salty! Definitely a good starter to get you warmed up for dumplings.\n* Chicken Gyoza - Perfectly crisped and seasoned. Flavorful even without soy sauce.\n* Pork Bao - Medium sized with a good amount of filling. I really want to try the char-siu ones that have a little peanut butter in them.\n* Beijing Noodles - Also salty (I think because of the soybean paste) but great to share with multiple people... Unless you like it so much that you don't want to share.\n* Shrimp & Cilantro Har Gow - I would say it's better (less greasy) than most dim sum places I've been to. Impressive!\n\nThere are so many other options for food and beverage. I can't just come here once or twice. I know I'll have to wait even if it's for lunch or dinner, but it's totally worthwhile.

Once last year - wait was about an hour long for a table for 2, and again recently - wait was only about 15 minutes for a table of 3 but it was communal. \n\nI have tried the shrimp toast, \"king dum\" - large xlb with a straw, Tom Yum Goong xlb, pork xlb, garlic string beans, lobster shu mai, beijing noodles, and their xi'an pork dumplings. The prices are pretty steep compared to regular dimsum/xlb places, but most of the items here are pretty good and good to try. The shrimp toast is pretty unique and has great flavor to it, even though it looks kind of simple (chinese donut and shrimp). The \"king dum\" large xlb is great for pictures and the experience, but not very worth it. The tom Yum Goong xlb is pretty good and unique, haven't seen this anywhere else. The regular pork xlb is pretty tasty with a good amount of soup. The garlic string beans are pretty good and goes well with the xlb, but nothing very unique about it. I've never tried or seen lobster shu mai before so we gave this a try - pretty expensive and I don't think I will order this again. It doesn't taste too different/special, not worth the price in my opinion. The beijing noodles is pretty good and has great flavor to it. The xi'an pork dumplings I would pass on next time because it tasted different that regular pork dumplings and I didn't really like the filling. It also looks like a salad dish mixed with sprouts and radish which was kind of weird to me.\n\nThe service is pretty good, though you may need to flag them down when you need something.

Very tasty! \n\nKing Dum - so big that you need a straw! This was nice for pictures but the skin was too thick and the meat was not firm. \n\nTrio of buns (green tea & milk bun, beet & taro bun, egg yolk bun) - these were okay, the green tea stood out the most. \n\nXian pork dumpling - nothing special and very bland. \n\nHar Gow - these were good but we had better. \n\nOverall, the dishes we ordered were hit or miss.

The Beijing noodle was also yummy (I added the hot sauce oil for an extra kick) with ground meat and freshly pulled noodles. I don't really recommend the Siu Mai, which was a bit bland (also had to add hot sauce which I never do for siu mai). Finally, the char siu bao was also good - we ordered the seared, not steamed, version which was tasty and even had a bit of peanut butter inside for uniqueness. \n\nService: Quick service, really attentive servers but don't expect your typical dim sum waiters here.

However, after one bite, I completely understood why and we ordered a second steamer of XLB.\n\nXLB\n- There is quite a bit of soup stuffed into each one, more juicy than many other XLBs at other restaurants. The soup itself is super flavorful.\n- Most of the dumpling skin is a perfect thinness although the top part is a bit thicker where it bunches up. Note: the top does get a bit dry if you let it cool too long. \n- The filling has a smooth mouthfeel and there is a good amount inside of each dumpling.\n- Overall great ratio of soup and filling to dumpling skin.\n\nOther dishes\n- We also chose to get the pickled lotus root and carrot salad, green beans, and the pan fried chicken baos. The pickling on the lotus root was very subtle but it was a nice crunchy side to have with the dumplings and bao. \n- The XLB were soo good that it really out shined the other dishes.  I really like the bao to filling ratio in the chicken bao, but the filling didn't have as much flavor as the XLB and since the XLB were so juicy, the bao filling seemed dry. The green beans were also underwhelming in flavor. Good thing theres soy sauce and chili oil on the table!\n\nSeating\n- My friend and I agreed to communal seating inside for a slightly shorter wait on a Sunday night.

I have been wanting to try something new and came across Dumpling Time during one of my yelp searches. Come early! We arrived at Dumping Time around 1030am and there was already two groups ahead of us. When you arrive, you can see that the workers at Dumpling Time are busy getting the restaurant ready for opening. You can see the chefs working nonstop making the dim sum items. They already have the list out for you to write your names on, which is great. \n\nDumpling Time started seating people promptly at 1100am. Even though we came early, we noticed that everyone that got there as they opened were seated. So I guess you can get there at 1100am and it should be okay. They didn't seem super busy on a Saturday morning. They have indoor seating and outdoor seating. You will be able to to choose as long as there is both options available for you. They will also ask you if your whole party is present. \n\nWe got a few things to try! We got their shrimp toast, char-sui bao, chicken bao, xiao long bao, tom yum goong, pork xian dumpling, and their trio of buns. \n\nTheir shrimp toast was really delicious! It's pretty much a Chinese donut with shrimp paste on top. I thought they did this dish really well. I couldn't really taste the shrimp but the Chinese donut part is very savory. It had just the right amount of crunch and the aroma of it was so yummy. \n\nTheir char-sui bao and chicken baos have the option of them steaming it or pan searing it. We got both with a pan sear and it gave it a nice crispy textured to the sides. The dough that they used for their bao was very good -- very soft. It was probably my favorite part of the baos. As for the inside, they're pretty normal to me. They should just have a dish of just plain pan seared baos .. I would totally order that! \n\nTheir xiao long bao and tom yum goong were pretty similar in taste. The only difference was that the tom yum goong had a little bit of spice to them. But other than that, they're about the same. I probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference if their wrappings weren't different. Both were pretty good. All of them were really juicy and none of our dumplings popped prior to reaching us! \n\nTheir pork xian dumplings weren't that great. To me, they were quite bland even with the sauce that they provided. I had to use chili oil to give it some flavor haha! \n\nTheir trio of buns were our dessert! It consisted of green tea and milk bun, egg yolk bun, and beet and taro bun. The egg yolk bun had an egg custard like filling inside and was the sweetest of the three. The green tea and milk bun had a very delicious aroma and was not too sweet at all. The beet and taro bun was yummy as well -- also not as sweet. I think my favorite was the green tea one. The egg yolk bun was too sweet. And the beet and taro bun was so so. \n\nThe price seems average but it does seem pricier than regular, traditional dim sum. I was super stuffed after lunch. We ended up spending $80 for all of that food. I'm not sure if I'd want to go back since there are so many other choices in San Francisco for dim sum....but if I was in the area, I would definitely go for a trio of green tea buns!", "author": "Doriee D."}

I don't think the amount of food that you're getting is worth the higher price you're paying either.\n\nI was definitely expecting some spectacular tasting XLBs that would've blown my taste buds away based on everyone else's reviews, but I feel like I've had the same taste at other dumpling or dim sum places. I guess what was unique about the experience was that the plating was super nice and extra (ahem, the secret recipe). Unfortunately I don't think I'll come here again unless a friend is DYING to try this place ... and even then I'd still probably recommend going somewhere else.\n\n|Beet XLB| -- Beautiful reddish color to the dumpling skin. My boyfriend did point out that the skin was thicker than other places like DTF, so it didn't wow him. This tasted like any other XLB, so I don't think it was worth the price or wait.\n\n|Mother's Secret Recipe| -- I thought the dumplings were small and that the majority of the dish was a bed of nicely cut onions, leaves, and peppers that only added color to the dish. \n\n|Seafood Gyoza| -- I was expecting more cause it was labeled \"seafood\" gyoza, but it should've just been labeled \"Shrimp Gyoza\" because that's all I tasted. The shrimp flavor is similar to getting hao gao at dimsum restaurants. The green skin is different, but doesn't enhance the flavor or anything. I did appreciate the sauces accompanying the dish.\n\nTIP: If you're here early, definitely take a peek inside the place and ask if you can put your name down before the rush of people come. Thanks to the chef who had at let me write my name down even before 5PM when they opened for dinner :)\n\nMy meal was honestly fine until the very end. I had just started attempting to calculate how much tip I wanted to leave until employees were all up in my face trying to clean up the table. I understand you're trying to be efficient and prepare for the next pair of people to sit, but I literally just received my check. It didn't help that the waiter also grabbed the plate with dumplings I was planning on taking home. I didn't even get a chance to ask for a box because they were LITERALLY rushing to just take everything off the table. Luckily I was still able to salvage it before he ran off to dump the plate.\n\nAlthough the King XLB sounds compelling and is Snapchat/IG worthy, the price did not seem worth it to me. \n\nTLDR: Expect to pay at least $20 per person if you're hungry because each dish is around $9. The dumplings are on the pricey for what you're getting since you can get the same flavor at other XLB restaurants or dimsum places. If you're into more bougie plating and presented dumplings, then I guess this place could be for you. Cute modern looking restaurant with parking spots.

I'd say it's one of the better dumpling places in SF that won't kill your wallet. Still not going to match up to places in LA (cheap and amazing), but it satisfied my cravings. \n\nService and setting: the restaurant itself is ok. It's not nice for a date spot or anything, but large and patio seating. What killed me was the service. They made us wait in freezing cold when 3/4 people were there, we said we would order, and they weren't even busy (plenty of tables). Super slow, not very polite... when we wanted a dessert menu (all food clearly finished) I waved my arms and they all ignored / weren't bothering to check. There's also no where to put any bags / coats so they constantly knocked over my bag tucked in the seat 2/5. \n\nFood: really saved the experience for me so it was worth the poor service. I wouldn't spend money on noodles based off what I had. We had a minced beef dry noodles (one of my fav dishes) but I wasn't impressed, just salty and not much else. Veggie (I think) dumplings with tons of excessive garnish. Probably to draw the sf hipsters... lol. Those were good though. Also awesome and definitely would order again include seafood gyoza, xlb, har gow, shumai. The skin was not as chewy and delicate as I'd like but fillings were awesome and overall super satisfied. Milk bun was also a nice sweet finish but wouldn't say it's a must have. TLDR save your money for dumplings 4/5\n\nI will definitely be back when the next craving hits and hopefully the service won't suck next time.", "author": "Anna N."}

The regular sized xiao long baos come in 6 pieces and mini aluminum trays like the ones used for egg tarts.  \n\nFor 6 girls, we ordered 5 XL soup dumpings, 2 regular pork soup dumplings, 1 tom yum goong, seafood gyoza, gan ban noodles, shrimp & cilantro har gow, shrimp toast, and cucumber chili salad. It was the perfect amount of food that we completely finished minus some remenants of the XL soup dumplings that the girls didn't finish.  \n\nI must admit that the XL soup dumping is a little overrated.  The soup was good but the texture of the meat/veggie was much different than the regular soup dumplings.  I definitely prefer the regular ones over the XL.  As for the pork vs tom yum goong, I can't really decide since I only had 1 piece of the tom yum goong.  \n\nMy next favorite item was the seafood gyoza.  There are real pieces of quality seafood in it and were not minced so finely that you can't tell what you're eating. The cucumber salad was meh because it wasn't marinated long enough. \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but I would have liked to try the trio buns.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Most Asians who are AB-whatever don't usually eat dim sum in the PM. We tend to get our dim sum in the morning, so when I saw this place was open for dinner I thought...we need to try it! We were in the mood for dumplings, and with a name like Dumpling Time, we knew we'd be set. My friend had yelped this spot before and highly recommended the Shrimp toast and now I'm telling you--order it. You won't regret it even though it sounds funky. It's basically you tiao (AKA chinese donut) and delicious shrimp and cheese I believe. Just try it. We also ordered the veggie dumplings, siu mai, and boo got the famous XLB and pan-seared fluffy pork bao too. After you order, the server puts your items on a receipt paper list and keep it at your table--exactly like what daytime dim sum spots do. At the end of dinner, we both walked out completely full and filled with delicious flavors. \n\nThere is a restroom in the back part of the restaurant--very clean and easily accessible. Parking is easy to find and pretty safe being in the Design district. We only waited about 15-25 minutes for dinner on a Sunday before getting seated which was pretty great for prime dinner time. I'd suggest instead of pen and paper waitlist, have the cell phone text/call service. It gets cold waiting outside in the evening, so getting us connected and texting us when our table is ready is a fab idea. The ambiance is dimly lit and cool--feels like I'm in Hong Kong with yuppies. They play Asian music videos on the projector screen wall, and have outdoor seating too (I think heated). Very family and group-friendly!\n\nI'd say if you're coming here for dim sum, it's definitely not as diverse in variety, but the quality is awesome. It's tastier and a bit larger in portion/bite sizes compared to spots like the infamous Din Tai Fung (I don't like the DTF's in the Bay Area), so I'd definitely come back again. In terms of dumplings, yes the skin is delicious and I've had better inside stuffings for veg...but they plate their food with a more \"hip\" aspect with microgreens and little accents that make this a younger, fresher, SF-vibe dim sum spot.", "author": "Jodi H."}

Overpriced, bad service (like horrid), and although the food might be photographable, I would say it's mediocre at best. \n\nI came here with a group of five for dinner. After an hour wait, we were seated. The place is loud with music videos and things playing from a projection on a wall. The video kept malfunctioning and replaying so it was very distracting and no one bothered to fix it. We ordered an assortment of gyoza, dumplings, xiao long baos, and trio dessert buns. The xi'an dumplings were presented beautifully in a very modern, classy, and highly instagrammable way. I recall them tasting great as well - but that's the extent of how much the dishes stuck out to me. The xiao long baos were underwhelming in flavor and the gyoza and the rest of the dumplings were really nothing special in my book to warrant the $6-7 price tag for five pieces or $9 for the tom yum goong xlb. It's kind of ridiculous.\n\nThe service was horrendous. Maybe they were still trying to get it together - but the wait staff were primarily concentrating on just taking the orders and checking them off the list when they arrived, then scurrying off as quickly as humanly possible. There was no feeling of customer service besides that, it actually felt almost rude. Trying to flag someone down for water was an impossibility. The staff walked around so fast and even with our hands raised, trying to make eye contact - it probably took us at least 20 minutes to finally get someone to give us a refill on our empty bottles. We literally had a game going on trying to make eye contact with someone, anyone, walking around. It was almost like the staff were trained not to address any issues outside of taking orders and delivering them.  \n\nMy favorite thing about this restaurant was the trio of milk buns which were honestly, quite delicious. However, if your name clearly indicates a specialty in dumplings and the best thing was the milk buns - there may be something amiss!

We ordered an extra round of the seafood gyoza because it was so good! The \"King-Dum\" that has been sensationalized on social media is worth getting at least once, but honestly the ratio of meat to soup to skin was off, and our poor king-dum fell apart within the first bite. \n\nThe other options are pretty standard dumpling restaurant items at about 2-3x the price point for on par or even slightly below par quality.

That being said, I came in with the expectation of an Asian Fusion take on dumplings and prices that aren't exactly traditional (aka cheap). I got exactly what I expected but was pleasantly surprised by the actual flavors (though I did avoid ordering any extremely traditional items). Parking in the area wasn't too bad (plenty of street parking since it's kind of an off the main road area). For a Monday I was surprised there was any wait but there were a few people in line. We were seated very quickly though.\n\nMy friend and I were only looking for a super small dinner so this place was perfect. We ordered the following:\n\n1) Shrimp Toast: Basically you tiao with shrimp on top and I'm not mad about it at all (ok I'm a bit upset by the $8 price) but it's an oil soaked delicious experience. (4/5)\n\n2) Shrimp Cilantro Har Gow: I'm not the biggest Shrimp Har Gow person but the addition of the pork and cilantro was exactly what this dish has been missing. The skin itself was a bit thick but fine. (4/5)\n\n3) King Dum XLB: These have been popping all around the internet and I just needed to try it for myself. I'm happy they were actually able to get a decent tasting soup in here but overall it's definitely a try once and never again item. The skin is very thick and the interior isn't anything special. I was very surprised that it's actually a good deal smaller than I thought. It's about the size of your palm but surprisingly shallow. The waitress recommended each person order their own because it's hard to share.

The menu for this place is also super simple, limited options under each category and sadly, they were out of the King Dum XLB when we got here so that's on my to do list for next time.. right next to waking up early for it. \n\nWe ordered the regular pork XLB, tom yum XLB, seared char siu bao, shrimp har gow, pork gyoza, seared pork bao, and trio buns for dessert. Everything was good besides the seared pork bao. Pork was just too stiff to bite into, definitely get the char siu one over those. But everything else was delicious, except food does take a while to come out so you're gonna have to be patient. \n\nBetween 2 people, we spent $53 and that's not too bad.

Designer t-shirts and well-kept shoes were saved against the onslaught of porky soup. For myself, I have come to expect every third XLB to be just an absolute wreckage. At Dumpling Time - this wasn't the case.\n\nThe pork dumplings sat like a layer of top-soil beneath a garden of red peppers, green sprouts, and white radishes. The garden looked so well-organized that I felt compelled to delicately pick away at the flowers until I reached the fresh food below rather than to violently scoop down and unearth the soil.\n\nSesame seeds carefully dotted the tops of the green beans which came out in a boat-shaped dish. A communal spoon and fork slid beneath the veggies to provide a specific sense of decency, reflecting a set of preferences not-often doled out in dim sum restaurants.\n\nShu mai, har gow, Beijing noodles, pork ribletts all were served with a similar amount of decoration and pomp, and all tasted great.\n\nUltimately, the taste of Dumpling Time was on point.

It definitely has authentic influences, but it obviously has a modern fusion take on it. I like that it is pushing the boundaries of what Chinese food looks like, esp to non-Chinese people. The interior is hipster, with some communal tables and unique glassware. The projected K-pop stuff on the wall was weird and distracting. \n\nFor two we had:\n- shrimp toast $8 (my favorite dish of the night, greasy though)\n- Beijing noodle $9 (my least favorite. Not bad, just bland and average) \n- king-dum $8 (cute gimmick decorated with edible flowers. I took the pic, then plucked the flowers right off. I am not going to eat dumplings with flowers on them. It goes against my Chinese blood!)\n- pork XLB $8 (solid XLB. Soup nicely sealed inside. Served with red vinegar.)\n- tom yum XLB $9 (tasted pretty much identical to the pork XLB. Pretty with the red skin, but I couldn't taste the coconut milk)\n\nEverything tasted okay. Everything was presented beautifully. It is pricey for what it is, especially since dumplings are considered \"cheap Chinese food\". Luckily, when we arrived at 6, we snagged the last open seats without a wait. But when we left, there was a good crowd waiting outside. Parking is not bad at all. \n\nLast comment, each little XLB has a foil cupcake liner. I know, it prevents sticking so you can have the optimum amount of soup.. but I hope they can think of an alternative. I don't want piles of them to go straight to landfill.", "author": "Kim W."}

I'm from Beijing and the best way I can describe this is that they serve traditional Chinese dishes with a small twist, aimed at a younger crowd. They incorporate ingredients like mayo, Tom yum soup(and its ingredients), and peanut butter, which are great additions but are not used in traditional Chinese cuisine.  \n\nWe loved everything we've tried: Saut\u00e9ed and gingered snap peas, pickled lotus root, shrimp toast, shrimp and cilantro har row, pork XLB, and Tom yum XLB. Each dim sum comes with it's own sauce which compliment each other quite well. My husband and I definitely over ordered and were so stuffed afterwards we could barely walk. \n\nTips:\n1. They don't take reservations or do takeout or delivery. Come at an off hour or plan to wait for 15-30 minutes. \n2. They have a covered outdoor patio for people with dogs.", "author": "Tata X."}

So that was a little annoying.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-09", "description": "TL;DR: if you're willing to travel a bit for dim sum, go to Dim Sum King in Daly City.  If you're willing to travel a lot, Din Tai Fung in San Jose is still the best.  Otherwise, you're outta luck and should come here. :p\n\nSo first of all this place is buuuusy.  We came Sunday at ~2pm (they close at 3) hoping the crowds have cleared, but it was still a 30-40 min wait!  Luckily when they say they close at 3 they actually mean last call at 3, so we were able to eat comfortably.\n\nNow, about the food... I was super excited about a dim sum place opening since there aren't any others nearby!  The menu is definitely much smaller than a standard dim sum menu, but have all the major dishes.  So we got:\n\n-Shrimp toast: it's literally 5 shrimps on Chinese doughnut cut into 5 equal lengths.  If you like shrimp and Chinese doughnut, you'll probably like this.  For me, it was too greasy.\n\n-Seaweed salad: fresh, vinegary, strong garlic flavor - loved it.\n\n-XLB: very good; thin skin, good soup, and a great meaty flavor!  Not as good as Ding Tai Fung of course, but still very good.  Came with a red vinegar (?) sauce that didn't taste like anything\n\n-Shrimp har gow: this was the worst har gow I've ever had.  The shrimp was clearly very, very poor quality.  It was obviously frozen, watery, and the meat tasted like it was slightly disintegrating.  It also tasted milky... overall it was just disgusting.  I usually love har gow but will never get it here again.  It also came with a creamy parsley sauce?\n\n-fried pork buns: the \"fried\" part didn't really come through, other than that fluffy outside, good filling, I'll probably get it not fried next time.\n\n-seafood gyoza: not crispy at all, skin was a bit dough-y, almost undercooked.  The inside, was basically all the same disgusting har gow shrimp\n\n-for those looking for king dim... it's not always available :(\n\nAnd then the other weird stuff... so this is clearly a Chinese dim sum place, but all the utensils were clearly Japanese.  A lot of the dim sum had non-traditional sauce on it like mayonnaise and butter.  The TV is playing K-pop.  Not a deal breaker, but just kinda weird.\n\nOverall, the place is just meh.  It's only popular because there aren't any other dim sum alternatives nearby lol.  But if you're willing to travel a bit go to Dim Sum King in Daly City - it's soooooo much better and less pricy.  And of course DTF is still the best dim sum place to go :)\n\nI may come back if I'm suuper craving dim sum and suuuper lazy haha.", "author": "Jeannie Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-17", "description": "Came here for a \"small lunch\" on my most recent trip to SF with some friends. This place is located in like the \"arts district\" or according to google maps, \"Design District\". Depending on which way you are coming from, you may not see it so easily. Their sign is blocked in one way by their exterior seating. The restaurant opens at 11AM but people will start signing up on the list at probably 1030AM or so. Parking is fairly ample but you see a lot of people arriving by Uber/Lyft. We were like the 2nd or 3rd group to arrive. They started seating people promptly at 11AM.\n\nAfter being seated, of course we referred to Yelp for some suggestions. Shrimp toast and Trio of Buns were one of the top recommendations so thats what we got and a few other things \n\nShrimp Toast ($8)\n\nUnlike the typical \"toast\", this shrimp toast uses \"you tiao/yao tiu\", a traditional chinese breakfast favorite which is like a chinese donut. The shrimp is a paste of chopped shrimp lined inbetween the groove you'd typically see in you tiao. The shrimp had a pretty good texture and flavor. Unfortunately the you tiao was cold and not that crispy. If they were able to keep it crispy and warm, it would be great ! 4/5 rating \n\nChicken Bao (3pc/$5.5) - Chicken ,green onion, wood ear mushroom, ginger\nChar-Siu Bao (3pc/$6) - Char-siu roast pork belly, touch of peanut butter\nBao may also be ordered crispy (pan seared)\n\nThe baos were pretty tasty. The char-siu pork was actually fairly light in flavor. The chicken reminded me of the \"big buns\" i get with meat filled. Both were pretty nice in flavor. The bao itself was soft. Not as chewy i had hoped for in a well made bun. Doesn't give that \"bounce\". 4/5 rating ! \n\nPork Xi'An Dumpling (8pc/$9) - Pork, cabbage, green onion decorated with thinly sliced radish, micro greens \n\nThe xi'an dumpling, despite the pretty presentation in a bowl, was probably the most disappointing of them all. Dumpling was a bit plain in flavor and the xi'an sauce was a bit plain in flavor as well. As with all their other stuff, the wrapping is self-made in-house. 2/5 rating\n\nKing-Dum Xiao Long Bao (1pc/$8) - Soup dumpling large enough that you'll need a straw\nPork XLB (6pc/$8) - Pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine\nTom Yum Goong XLB (6pc/$9) - Pork belly, shrimp, coconut milk, wrapped in a beet skin\n\nThe Pork XLB and Tom Yum Goong XLB came out at the same time. Served in an aluminum cup like most places do nowadays since people cant pick up XLB without breaking it, even if their lives depended on it. Flavor wise, they both were fairly similar. You can taste a slight more tartness to the Tom Yum Goong version (maybe it was just me) but flavor wise, really similar. \n\nPersonally, i didn't order the King-Dum but my friend did. It was served with a boba straw (Ow..?) Huge meat ball inside with some meat. The steamer is served on a small dish/bowl, which was a great idea and saving grace because his King-Dum popped on the bottom and all the soup went. The soup was fairly light, not too fatty. He said the normal XLBs were better in comparison in terms of skin thickness, flavor, etc. \n\nTrio of Buns (3pc/$5.5) consisting of Green Tea & Milk Bun, Beet & Taro Bun, and Egg Yolk Bun\n\nWhen this was served, the same friend who ordered the King-Dum and I heard Egg Yolk Bun. Our hopes were peaked when we had imagined it to be like the runny yolk inside like some dim sum places offer. We saved this for last, but unfortunately 2 other friends tried this first and killed our hopes.. The egg yolk bun was like a custard. The Green Tea & Milk bun was very fragrant and smelled amazing. Probably the best of the 3 IMO. Beet and Taro bun was nice with the taro filling as well. Good way to try all 3 \"Happy Endings\". \n\n----------------\n\nOverall, the place is nice to try, but im unsure if i would return again. Unique offerings but nothing too great in comparison to ones ive had in the past. Its all personal preference. Its great they make their wrapping/skins all themselves as its not really something a lot of places do anymore. Kind of pricey for the things offered but we were decently satisfied. We had a lot more other foods that day to save room for HEHE", "author": "Andrew C."}

I ended up coming here on a Monday for lunch and was seated immediately. SCORE! If you come with the mindset that you're here for some cheap dim sum or XLB then you're going to be sorely disappointed by the price. \n\nOk now that we've reframed our expectations, Dumpling Time is a newer, cleaner, and slightly more upscale place to get your dumpling fix on. With that comes increased price. I mean 4 pieces of har gow goes for $6 here when you can something similar on Clement St. for $2. However, Dumpling Time goes a bit non-traditional with its addition of cream cheese or cilantro to their har gow. In many dishes this place does things just a bit differently. Like their seafood gyoza...you can really taste all the crab and scallop and shrimp but wrapped in their spinach skin ($9.50 for 5 pc) or their ginormous King-Dum XLB ($8 for 1) that is garnished with rose petals and other edible flowers.\n\nOverall, I like the place and the flavors are pretty spot on with their unique twist. However, lunch for 2 came out to $42 with tax/tip and we were both still pretty hungry.

We were sat at a table that was meant for 6 people at most , but since we only had 3 people, we had to share the table which was fine until they SHOVED 4 more individual to the table ! Hence there was 7 people at the table, making it feel so cramped !

All the time I've been here, my party was always seated outside so I can't say much about inside. I get cold really easily, so sitting outside kinda sucks sometimes, however, the tent is really good at blocking out the wind! I just wish there were a couple more heaters lol. Don't waste your time trying to get a table inside when outside seating is just as good as being indoors.\nAnother great thing about sitting outside is that I got to bring my pup Kuma! We weren't entirely sure if they allowed dogs to be honest, lol. If they don't allow it, I guess Kuma was just too cute to refuse!\n\n[Service]\nWe usually get really great service at the beginning of our meal, and then when it comes time to order more or grab the check, it always takes a while to flag someone down. This is probably because by the time we finish, servers are experiencing table turn around, helping other customers close out and get ready for the next set of customers, so it's totally understandable.\nThe servers are incredibly sweet here! They even took Kuma into consideration and made a make shift water bowl for him. I felt bad telling them I had a portable water bowl for him already.. Lol. Thumbs up for thinking about him!\n\n[Food]\nThe food is really good!! I was a little bit afraid that it wouldn't have lived up to the standards of other great San Francisco dim sum restaurants. With that being said, Dumpling Time holds their own. Nothing on their menu is bad, lol. \nWhat drew me to this place at first was the Tom Yum soup dumplings. I don't know what I was expecting but these dumplings were definitely.. different. I'd skip these.\nMy favorite dishes are probably the shrimp toast (whoever thought of putting minced shrimp and mayo on a chinese donut is a freaking genius), seafood gyoza (the sauce on the side is so good!) and also the egg yolk & green tea buns.\n\n[Worth it???]\nJust like everyone is saying, Dumpling Time is on the pricier side. If I were to take my boyfriend's family here, they would probably think these prices are laughable. But, the food is good! Price point, not so good.\nI would come here with friends or even family to show them a more modern yum cha experience. (Just without the tea because the tea here is expensive and not worth the price per person!)", "author": "Audrey G."}

Between the 2 of us, we got 4 items and it was enough to feed 2 girls.\n\nOf course I got the giant dumpling (King-Dum) and though it was cool, it tasted like an normal soup dumpling except since you're suppose to slurp all the soup out first, it just takes like filling and a ton of dough. It was cool, but not my favorite of the night. We also got the shrimp toast which was good as the shrimp had great flavor and the chinese donut was deliciously fried, the seafood gyoza which was good and the tom yum goong which was my favorite and tasted like tom yum XLB and reminded my of my thailand trip the month before except the flavor wasn't as prominent.\n\nOverall, it was good food.

There were actual people taking pictures of these chefs with their dslrs...\n\nXLB served in tin foil cups that stuck to the xlb... how do I dip (and cool) the bottom of my xlb in the sauce? What is logic? The xlb RIPS because the heaviest part is at the bottom/the skin is thin so it's hard to take it out all in one piece, but if you do get it out in one piece the rounded spoon that is too small to hold the xlb will not allow you to have that sauce:xlb ratio. If you decide to eat it in the cup, good luck using the sauce and keeping the soup from spilling everywhere...I know perhaps the cups are used to catch the soup/ stabilize it when it steams but you can do that with FLAT SPOONS too. And if foil cups are the secret to a thin-skin, well-steamed xlb, maybe use cups that are easier to pry the xlbs from (hint: more rigs? larger cup?). Please, logic over aesthetics for once. \n\nThe veggie xian dumpling was good because they used really young chives. The pork gyoza was alright but not mindblowing.

There's a lot of space to wait outside and a bench you can sit on. After 20 minutes, I went inside to check on the list and found that our name was already crossed off! After informing the hostess, she said that they called our name and someone else claimed it. Since we were sitting outside on the bench (which is further from the entrance) we didn't even hear the host call out any names. Apparently it's a \"thing\" that happens often here. Luckily the host told us that they had a table ready for us so we were seated right after. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best. We ordered tom yum XLB, the king dum, pork gyoza, and the bun trio. Our waitress suggested that we ordered one more item because it's small portions so we opted for the Beijing noodles. I definitely prefer chewy-textured hand made noodles and the Beijing noodles were more like a dry ramen with ground beef. I was really excited for the tom yum XLB because I've never seen anything like it but unfortunately it didn't taste like tom yum at all, definitely not worth $9 for 6 pieces. The king dum was also a bit of a let-down. They give you a thick straw to drink the soup inside but it's almost impossible to suck anything up and all the soup ended up dripping down to the plate under the bamboo container. When we tried to cut it, it fell apart and the skin became mushy. If you're looking for authentic XLBs, this is not the place to go. \n\nThe best thing about our meal was the pink taro bun that came with the bun trio. The filling is real taro and complimented the bun very well. The other buns that came in the trio was green tea and your typical white custard bun. The green tea didn't taste anything like green tea either. Dumpling Time is a bit overrated and pricey for what it is. You're basically paying for pretty looking dumplings and baos.

Fancy little flowers and watermelon radishes scattered haphazardly on buns are good for the picture, nothing more. I went around 11:30 on a weekday, and it was still super busy, full inside the restaurant at the large communal tables and outside in their patio area. \n\nAll of their dishes cost around $5-10, and most of them consist of 3-4 buns or dumplings. Essentially, you're paying more than $2 for each of these buns, and the worst part is that they don't even taste good. I skipped the XL Bao because it's probably an L at most - it's pretty small when you see the basket it comes in, which is smaller than the one that contains the xiao long bao. \n\nShrimp toast was good - I especially liked the cream that they put on it, though there was just a drop of it on each piece. The shrimp dumplings with cilantro sauce were interesting because the sauce gave it a strange flavor typically associated with burrito innards. The Bun Trio, which contained the green tea, taro, and custard buns was disappointing because it seemed like they just bought frozen buns and steamed them in the kitchen. Nothing was as bad as the noodles, though, which were incredibly bland even after I heaped hot sauce on them. \n\nYes, this place is exciting because of the neon signs and hip interior, but if that's all you want, just drop by and take a peek.

Good thing that didn't deter me and my friend from trying it out. Came in around 11:30am on a Sunday, and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. If you come around 12:30, be prepared for a long wait.There's a clipboard to sign in on the waitlist, and there's indoor/outdoor seating.

Then I ask the hostess what times do they run out by and why they ran out? Later we see the table next to us get them, so we asked the waiter from before if we can get them now.

They looked better than that, but we didn't order them because I've been fooled by Shrimp Toast before.\n\nThe centerpieces were Mom's Secret Recipe Boiled Pork Dumplings and the soup dumplings which are very tasty and small. You can pop them in your mouth very quickly, they are very good. We ordered the Tom Yum Goong variety. They were gone in a flash. Mom's SRBPD were awesome. We could have eaten 3 times as many. And they were beautifully garnished with micro-greens, chives and flower petals. Lovely.\n\nA woman at the next table shared her Beet & Taro bun as a dessert because she was full. Pink and very tasty, but nothing sent off fireworks. It was just an appreciated sweet ending.\n\nAt the end of all this, we were still hungry and were ready to go somewhere else to finish the meal. But instead, we shared a beer, which was very cold and satisfying. It filled us up sufficiently so we paid the bill somewhere around $50.\n\nNext time, we'll have one of the two noodle dishes on the menu. That should fill us up a little better and might save $10. There's lots of places in the City with Shanghai Dumplings, but this is certainly one of the nicest. Totally recommend it.", "author": "Marty R."}

The alcoholic beverages are listed but it's BYOB until their license gets approved.  We arrived before opening hour and found a crowd waiting, but once opening time came, we were seated in a prompt and orderly fashion. \n\nThe interior isn't huge but it fits a good number of people. Most of the people waiting before opening were seated in the first seating.  Our order:\n\nPork XLB - $8.  We watched as the staff wrapped Dumplings and these came out quickly.  Piping hot, filled with broth, and supposedly made with Pork belly.  As we watched the staff wrap the Dumplings and place in a tin cup, we noticed how white the Pork meat looked. Likely fat, but it leads to a distinct dumpling flavor that is more fatty than I liked.  The dumpling skin is on the thicker side as well. Overall, solid dumpling served Hot with plentiful broth but not the best I've had. \n\nTom Yum Goong - $9. A nice variation on the traditional with beet red dumpling skins and a subtle Tom yum broth.  I liked these better but still thick skin and similar dumpling Pork meat. \n\nKing-dum - $8. Perfect for selfies but very thick skin given the size.  The Pork meat was the most white and fatty in this one but of note, there was a lot of broth and it was served with a nice boba straw and piping hot.  A one time order thing. \n\nShrimp Dumplings - $6. Basically har gow but a slight twist with cream cheese and a cilantro dipping sauce. Both were subtle twists that didn't detract from the large and high quality shrimp inside. \n\nSeafood Gyoza - $9.5.  Another slight variation with green Gyoza skin and lots of high quality seafood and Pork.  Cooked very nicely and juicy with a crispy exterior.  The butter dipping sauce and traditional soy dipping sauce were nice additions. \n\nBeijing Noodles - $9. Basic dish with delicious house made noodles and a simple but tasty stir fried Tan Tan sauce. Solid. \n\nXian Pork Dumplings - $6.  Beautifully garnished but standard frozen thick skin boiled Pork Dumplings. Tasty sauce but otherwise unremarkable. \n\nSnap Peas - they ran out of their popular green beans but this was a nice substitute.  \n\nChar Siu Bao - $6.  Pan Fried version and nicely done with a crispy bottom.  Good quality char Siu meat. \n\nOverall, Dumpling Time was a solid spot.  I actually was most impressed by the shrimp\nDumplings and seafood Gyoza instead of the Xiao Long Bao.  Prices are a tad higher given the trendy environment but solid ingredients.  I wasn't a fan of the thicker dumpling skin and Pork meat used but everything was tasty and solid. \n\nDumpling Time accepts credit cards including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

First thing first, find parking. Parking around isn't too bad and we went on a Saturday. Once you find parking, you put your name down on the wait list. Make sure your party is there or near by, they don't sit you unless everyone is there. The wait isn't too bad, around 12:30pm the wait was about 30mins? When we were finally called, we pretty much one thing of each section (or more) LOL. Oh and there is about 25mins-30mins wait on making the Large XLB.\n\nWe started off with the garlicky green beans. Wasn't impressed. It would be something I make at home and I wished they had more garlic. \n\nNoodles: We got the Beijing noodles...Kinda disappointed as well. Wasn't something that tasted unbelievable. The portion is enough for maybe 1 person... SAD...\n\nGyoza: Had the seafood Gyoza, this hit the spot! Now thats what I'm talking about! I recommend getting this one. You don't normally see green gyoza and...hardly can find SEAFOOD ones.\n\nBao: We chose Cha siu bao, make sure to have them pan sear it. It is quite yummy. They also hold the red dye in the cha siu, this is a plus.\n\nDumplings: Ok I thought this was very odd. I usually eat my dumplings just steamed/boiled and with the sauce, this came with cherry tomatoes and some greens. Too hipster LOL. Nothing too special on these ones.\n\nNow to the XLB:\nWe ordered the regular ones, not bad. Tasted pretty good.\nThe LARGE one...NEEDS A STRAW?!?! Actually I felt like you don't need it. You use it to poke a hole to let the steam out and have it chill before you can drink it. But the XLB is so big you can even pick it up with a spoon and chopsticks so...there isn't much to using the straw. COOL idea but not needed. Awesome it came with a small dish so the soup you couldn't drink will be on that dish and you just drink it after you finish the XLB. The XLB itself was pretty good, just a jumbo size (a bit inconvenient to eat) XLB.\n\nWould I come back? Maybe if I was in the area :)", "author": "Jade L."}

They serve a variety of different dumplings and noodle dishes. \n\nThe ambience is hyped and modern. I love the neon signs, Canto-rap vibes, and Shanghai landscape line art. You can watch your dinner being made in the window as well. There is outdoor seating to enjoy the chill SF air. \n\nThere is often a wait so come prepared. I was lucky enough to come early on a weeknight, so there was no wait for me. I've heard that the wait could take up to an hour and a half. \n\nI ordered the King Dum (the large XLB), regular & tom yum XLB, shrimp toast, the noodles, and the trio dessert buns. Out of all the dumplings that we tried, I would definitely say that their large XLB was my favorite. The regular and tom yum had a good amount of soup, but the wrapping was a little thick on the top. I would definitely pass on the tom yum ones next time. I was surprised by how much I liked the shrimp toast. It was a Chinese fried doughnut with shrimp paste. It was yummy, crunchy, and not too oily for a fried item. Their noodles were a yummy, dry-mix noodle. I thought the portion was a little scarce, but the noodle texture was good and the flavors were yummy. Mmm, the dessert buns were the yummiest. Soft and a good amount of filling. There was a taro, matcha, and custard. My favorite was definitely the custard, but all were a lovely way to top off the meal. \n\nIt was a good dinner spot with a lot of variety for a group sharing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-07-01", "description": "I really wanted to like this place, but I'd say it's just a pricier hipster dumpling spot. I'm a HUGE dumplings fan, and I've been to many in San Francisco, but this doesn't make the top dumplings place on my list. The presentation was good, especially for the king xlb and pork dumplings, but see below for my comments on each dish we ordered. \n\nWait time: We arrived around 5:10 pm on a Friday and added ourselves to the waitlist. There were already a few groups hanging around also waiting outside. (It opens at 5:30 pm). \n\nDesign: \n- There's a big window at the entrance that shows the chefs preparing the handmade dumplings. \n- Indoor and outdoor seating \n- Modern & hipster \n\nWhat we ordered: \n\n1. First to come out was the pork xian ($9 for 8 pieces). The presentation was nice - it was loaded with garlic and chives on top. The skin was very smooth and soft!! You can tell it was freshly made. But in my opinion, the skin was just the best part of this dish. \n\n2. Second to arrive was the seafood gyoza ($9.50 for 5 pieces). I only ordered this because other Yelp reviews claimed it was good. To be honest, it wasn't anything great. The buttery sauce that came with it was awkward and didn't mix well, but the other soy sauce with it mixed better. It was more like a green skinned ha gaw. Pricey for just 5 pieces of mediocre gyoza :/ \n\n3. Third to arrive was the pork XLB ($8 for 8 pieces). Again, the skin was good, but it wasn't anything better than I've had before. :( \n\n4. Last to arrive was the King XLB. ($8 for one piece). This dish apparently takes 25 minutes to cook, so it'd be best to order this immediately upon sitting/ordering. This was the only reason why we wanted to come. I've been wanting to go to a dumpling place with a straw to drink the soup (I've only seen this in la). I believe Dumpling Time is the first place in NorCal to have this. It's definitely the biggest soup dumplings I've had, and the first I've drank with a straw! This was the best dish we've ordered all night. It was large, juicy, soft, and flavorful. The soup was fresh, and so were the tender pork and skin. Yes, it can get messy and the soup eventually seeps through the bottom. \n\nWe ordered 2 king xlb's but the second one took FOREVER to come out. We waited so long, and saw so many other people's King xlb's come out that we eventually got frustrated and asked our waiter to check up on it. She said \"it's coming\" 2 times, but we still waited and waited. She then came back and said it would take another 3 minutes. At that point; we didn't want to wait anymore. She gave us the option to wait or cancel the order, so we did cancel it. After we canceled it, her whole demeanor changed. She wasn't nice or friendly, and the way she grabbed our bill and gave it back was with attitude. Hello...it's not our fault the food took forever to come out. There's no reason to give us attitude when we're the paying customers that waited and didn't ask to cancel until she gave us that option. \n\nAll in all, this was definitely a one time experience. I understand why this would be a \"hit spot\" in SoMa because there's not many in that area. But from my experience, there's a lot more better priced dumplings and flavorful tastes in other parts of SF.", "author": "Miranda T."}

If you're a party of 2 or less, you'll likely need to share a table with others, and here the orders can get mixed up, as the servers will know to deliver to the right table, but not to the right seat or the right party at that table. \n\nWhile the fact that everything is made fresh to order is a huge selling point, the drawback to this is that you'll probably need to wait a while for your food after sitting down, which limits the amount of turnover that this place gets from a business perspective.\n\nAdd all this to the fact that there's a large, covered, and heated outdoor patio that's currently used as a waiting area - instead of extra dining space that could easily fit 20-30 more people - and you have a situation where waiting times can cascade spectacularly.\n\nAs for the food, all the items I tried were quite decent. The shrimp har gow, for example, had some extra fatty flavor to it thanks to a dab of cream cheese (!) and some pork filling. Each dumpling, however, was sized rather diminutively. The pork Xi'an dumplings were merely OK, and the tom yum goong (xiao long bao with pork belly, shrimp, and coconut milk, all wrapped in beet-colored skin) were decent too. Also, they can't serve alcohol at the moment, so it's either soft drinks, tea, or BYOB.\n\nIt's an OK experience overall if you're in the area and you're really craving dumplings.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-28", "description": "3.5 STARS. Upon reviewing their Yelp while waiting in line on Christmas Day (2017), my boyfriend and I noticed that Dumpling Time has significantly increased their prices within the past year. For example, the char siu bao increased in price from $5 to $6 and the tom yum goong from $7 to $9. The wait wasn't too long and the heaters outside made the patio bearable. Service was quick and attentive. Now onto the dim sum. \n\n~ CHAR SIU BAO (3pcs/$6; 4/5): I like char siu bao and this tasted like any other one I've had. Good, but nothing special.\n~ KING DUM ($9; 3/5): My boyfriend wanted this \"for the gram\"... I didn't think it was worth it at all. The soup was hard to drink out of the giant bao and the bao itself was difficult to eat since it was so large. And because it was so large you can't eat it with the soup without it spilling everywhere. In turn, you're not getting the true XLB effect.\n~ TOM YUM GOONG (6 pcs/$9.50; 4/5): I was drawn towards these not only because they were red but also because of the pork, shrimp and coconut milk combo. I didn't really taste any coconut at all and these were pretty basic XLB. Not worth almost $10 in my book.  \n~ MAIN LOBSTER SIU MAI (4pcs/$12; 3/5): These were super disappointing... Not only were they stupid overly priced for what you got, I couldn't even taste any truffle. The siu mai themselves just tasted like shrimp, not the fancy main lobster they claim it to be. \n~ SHRIMP TOAST ($12; 4/5): This dish was my favorite of the meal. The \"toast\" was crispy and the shrimp on top was generous. The sauce that was drizzled on seemed to be some kind of sriracha sauce which was pretty tasty.\n\nOverall, Dumpling Time is definitely unwarrantedly overpriced dim sum.

It's a fun modern take on the dumpling house.\n\nIf you're familiar with Din Tai Fung, there are some similarities: service style - your order receipt is left on table so that the servers check off what has already been brought to you, clear window panes to see the dumplings being made in real-time, long wait times (depending on day & time you arrive).\n\nFaves:  shrimp toast (shrimp paste on a traditional Taiwanese long donut), shrimp & cilantro har gow\n\nPork XLB was good; better than most places, but I wouldn't put it at the same level as Din Tai Fung.

I've been here with my family twice and I'm already excited for my next visit here. :) To secure a spot when it opens, put your name down on the list 15-20 minutes before it opens! If it looks like no one is around, it's usually because people are waiting in their cars cause it's cold/windy. So don't be alarmed by a huge crowd when it opens! \n\nIt may take a while for the food to come around within the first hour because the kitchen is backed up on orders, but it's worth it! I wouldn't get the shrimp toast because the fried toast isn't as fresh as the ones you can get at Chinatown. It has a very unique taste with the spicy mayo on top and a small piece of shrimp inside the toast. The har gow skin is really delicate that it breaks once you try to lift it from its tray. I would recommend the siu mai! It tastes just like how it should at other dim sum restaurants! The XLB is a MUST. In fact, get three orders of it because you can easily finish it. My favorite part of the meal is the dessert. The green tea milk bun is the best one. Condensed milk cream in the middle and green tea as the base. A nice mix. \n\nI am docking one star off for the customer service. I understand that it can be chaotic because of so many people you need to be aware of.

The door to the restaurant was originally opened and the servers saw us waiting around for a bit and decided to close the doors to the restaurant... I felt like they could have taken our names down first before doing that. Once the restaurant opened, there was quite a crowd of people already and the server that saw us several times gave the list to someone that just came.\n\nOur bill came out to be $151.38 for 14 dishes with 18% gratuity for a party of 5 or more... we ordered the three-sum baos to go and they charged us the 18% gratuity for it too... it's not much but still weird in my book. \n\nSome of the dishes I regret ordering the most were:\n\nLobster siu mai ($12 for 4 pieces... it tasted like regular sui mai)\nThe shrimp toast ($8 for a roll of Chinese donut with a very small amount of shrimp in the middle. So small that my dad didn't even noticed there were shrimp. Definitely not even a third of the amount as one of the yelp picture of it shows)\nCucumber salad ($5 for a tiny bowl of pickled cucumber..)\nBeijing and gan ban noodles ($9.50 for small bowl of oily noodles)\n\nDishes that were good but were still a bit overpriced:\n\nKing-dum XLB ($9 for one... comes with a straw to drink the scorching hot soup before eating the dumpling. I recommend transferring it to another bowl cause it was no easy to drink it)\nTom yum goong XLB ($9.50 for 6 pcs)\nPork dumpling ($9 for 8 pieces, tasted like average dumpling with colorful veggies decoration like cherry tomatoes and red radishes)\nShrimp and pork siu mai ($6 for 4 pieces)\nCrispy tofu squares ($5, not crispy like the name)\n\nDishes I will order again in the off chance I ever end up there again:\n\nTaro and beet bao ($6 for 3)\nGreen tea and milk bao ($6 for 3)\nThree-sum ($6 for 3, very awkward to order but I recommend trying this; they're unique and yummy)\nShrimp and cilantro har gow ($6.50 for 4 pieces, this was really good and their cilantro sauce adds a refreshing taste to it)", "author": "Heidi V."}

If not, we would have been seated at their weird 6-person communal table! I have nothing against communal tables but those tables put you right up against your neighbor. I think Dumpling Time could benefit from a different table set up: more 2/4 person table and do away with the awkward 6-person tables in the middle. \n\nWe ended up ordering: \n1) Pork XLB (3/5): I had high exceptions and these were honestly a disappointment. The skin was the right thickness and consistency, but the soup was pretty bland. Other XLB places have much more flavorful dumpling broth. \n\n2)Tom Yum Goong XLB (5/5): Favorite dumpling ever! Both of us LOVED these.  There's a hint of beet flavor from the skin, but nothing overwhelming. There's also a nice little kick from the meat which makes these dumplings amazing. The soup was also very flavorful! I could gobble up at least a dozen of these!\n\n3)Seafood Gyoza (3/5): These were alright. I will admit I got it for the spinach skin.... Nothing that blew me away. The aioli sauce was a bit weird. Both of us avoided that. \n\nAs long as there's no wait and I'm already in the area, I'll come back and order several rounds of the Tom Yum Goong XLBs.", "author": "Angela W."}

We were super interested in what Dumpling Time had to offer since it was listed as Hot & New on yelp. We got here around 6pm and there was at least an hour and half wait. We were seated outside in a small table (usually it's for two people) but we were hungry so we didn't really care and got seated. The waitress brought the menu and we were looking through what to order. To be honest, the waiters weren't very attentive with our table it seems since they never really came around to check up on us unless they brought our foods out. \n\nSo for our dinner, we ordered the shrimp toast, xiao long baos (comes in 6), king dum (giant xlb with a straw lol), chicken gyoza, char-siu bao (pan seared), beijing noodles, shrimp & cilantro har gow, and trio of buns. Shrimp toast was plain. XLB were good and honestly you can never go wrong with that. Kim Dum was yummy but all the soup just came out the moment it was served. It was so hard to suck up the soup through the straw too but the concept was cute. Char-siu bao was pretty good though and the beijing noodles were flavorful. Shrimp & cilantro was alright, nothing special. \n\nPricing isn't too bad at this place. It's cheaper than DTF but I think I enjoyed DTF more to be honest. I wish the XLB came with more than 6 pieces lol. \n\nOverall, we had a good time but I don't think it was amazing.", "author": "Monica W."}

Yeah, there's usually a bit of a wait. The food was pretty rich and good all-around, with no complaints, and I only knocked it a star because I like cheaper food.\n\nHighlights were: the fried tofu (so silky and delicious), the fried donut with shrimp, the regular XLB, the tom yum XLB (contrary to some reviews, I liked it as much as the regular ones!), the wagyu dumplings, and the beijing noodles (tasted handmade!) in that order. We got one of the king dumplings just to try, as well. The happy ending dessert buns were good, too. The only one I didn't like was the xi-an vegetarian dumpling, which sadly lacked taste and flavor.\n\nI do recommend going with a group of maybe 5 people so you can sample more of the menu since each order usually comes with 4-6 pieces but ordering several for yourself would be costly.

The food came out fresh and steaming hot. \n\nFried BBQ Pork Buns- The BBQ pork filling was delicious and I really enjoyed having the buns seared a bit on the outside. \n\nSteamed Chicken Buns- The chicken filling was not as savory as the BBQ pork filling. I liked the steamed buns equally compared to the Fried version because they place a cute stamp on each bun when you get it steamed. \n\nXLB- So much broth! I loved it! I was definitely making slurping sounds eating each dumpling. Though the dumplings were small, each is hand made and delicate. \n\nBeet XLB- I was a bit disappointed that these wrappers turned out to be brown and not purple as expected. Nonetheless the filling was still delicious. There was noticeably less broth compared to the regular XLBs but still worth a try. \n\nSeafood Dumplings- I loved the filling and butter sauce!

The pork XLBs are about as good as I've had in other places, with a very thin skin that's not too doughy, while maintaining a hearty serving of soup in each bite. The other standouts are the baos, I most enjoyed the pork bao, followed by the chicken bao, and then char-siu. The pork was the most well seasoned and flavorful. I got them all pan seared and the quality and taste of the dough really made them standout.\n\nThe gyoza were OK, nothing too special about them. Same for the regular har gow, I did not bother to try the cream cheese har gow. The shrimp toast was tasty and unique, but on my way out I was disappointed to see that they were using store bought bread and just adding the shrimp paste. I guess this is no different from restaurants that buy their pasta instead of making it fresh, and it won't stop me from getting the shrimp toast again, I just hope they change that in the future.\n\nOverall, this place is off to a good start and as long as they don't keep bumping up their prices (seems some items have gone up from opening day) and maintain the consistency, it will be a SOMA go-to spot.\n\nLarge groups beware, lines form quickly.

I sent it 29 seconds ago!\" And, then they stand there and stare at you until you respond over email. \n\nGranted, emergencies come up that require your urgent response. But, when they're asking for bakery recommendations and what color fondant they should get for their bf's birthday cake that's 2 months and 11 days away...GTFOH! (Ok, I would never say that but c'mon now).\n\nAs you walk in, Dumpling Time has a dumpling exhibition area like Din Tai Fung. Here, you even enjoy your meal in front of the dumpling makers and watch the magic happen. Much props to them for having to deal with people watching their every move, snapping pics, and videotaping them (I was one of them). Imagine if someone watched us 24/7 at our cubicle/office. Yeaaa, PornHub will just have to wait. \n\nDumpling Time softly opened yesterday (thanks, Ann S. for the heads up) in the former Source and Dusty Buns space. It's walk-in only and no reservations. \n\nThe menu is comprised of Chinese and Japanese dumplings with a CA twist, baos, noodles, and small veggie side dishes. Everything is super reasonably priced with nothing over $9. Beer and wine only. \n\nMr. Diva likes to order a sh*t ton of food which I'm always down for. How else are you going to get a good sampling of the menu? We ordered the following:\n\n*Cucumber Salad ($3)\n*Pickled Lotus ($3)\n*Shrimp Toast ($6): http://bit.ly/2rslRT3\n*Shrimp Har Gow (4 pc - $6): http://bit.ly/2qxNaMu\n*Seafood Gyoza w/ spinach skin, spiced chili butter aioli (5 pc - $7.50): http://bit.ly/2r25QXw\n*Pork Gyoza (5 pc - $6.25): http://bit.ly/2rs2NEu\n*Pork XLB: Heritage pork, savory soup, shao-sing wine (6 pc - $6): http://bit.ly/2qSUN34\n*Tom Yum Goong: Heritage pork, black tiger shrimp, coconut milk, beet skin (6 pc - $7): http://bit.ly/2qtVX3U\n*Cha Siu Bao (BBQ Pork), pan seared (3 pc - $5): http://bit.ly/2pMi46l\n*Beijing Noodles w/ pork, green onion, ginger, soybean paste ($9): http://bit.ly/2rgk46Y\n*Bao Trio: Green Tea & Milk, Egg Yolk, Beet & Taro ($5): http://bit.ly/2rslFUj\n\nMy favorites...\nThe Shrimp Toast was a halved youtiao (Chinese cruller) that's topped with shrimp paste and a dollop of spicy aioli. Crunchy and chewy with a good amount of fresh shrimp paste. Carby goodness. \n\nThe Pork XLBs are the best in SF next to Yank Sing and Crystal Jade (better than DTF which is overrated IMO). The skin is thin and these bad boys are hella juicy. When you pick it up with your chopstick, the XLB sags like big 'ol tatas which is a good sign. I like to switch it up by biting a hole at the top and sucking the broth out, and popping a whole one in my mouth. If you do the latter, be prepared for a wonderful broth EXPLOSION in your mouth! It's served with red wine vinegar and ginger. Personally, I like black vinegar more (smoky) so I hope they have that option in the future. \n\nThe Cha Siu Bao (pan seared) had nicely browned, crisp bottoms and fluffy tops with a savory pork filling. The filling is slightly creamier than the traditional filling since they add peanut butter. \n\nI love har gow and these were a good fusion rendition with a cream cheese filling and a chimichurri-like dipping sauce. The barely translucent skin had a good stretchy chew and was generously filled with plump shrimp. I know it sounds a little odd but the combo of cheese, shrimp, and the herby green sauce had delicious layers of flavors. \n\nThe Green Tea & Milk Bao was the perfect ending to our meal. Didn't taste much green tea but the bao was soft and the filling was like a creamy milky custard. Very yummy. \n\nMy least favorite was the Beijing Noodles (Zhajiangmian). The handmade noodles were overcooked and soggy. \n\nThe staff was friendly but a little on the green side. It wasn't clear who are server was was so ended up flagging down various servers when we didn't receive certain orders.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-12-06", "description": "Tried for the first time today while I was in the area. I am on a budget but needed to get lunch in the area. It was me on my own, so wasn't looking for anything special or fancy, just something that would fill me up. \n\nI opted for something under the Soup Dumplings section of the menu, thinking that this would be a soup with dumplings in it. The item was Pork XLB- pork belly, savory soup, shao-sing wine. I asked a waitress to help me make a choice, but she didn't mention that this was just 6 steamed dumplings with soup inside. \n\nI definitely don't hold her responsible for this mix-up, but the menu could certainly be clearer. 'steamed dumplings filled with soup' might be a better way of putting it, as I (not unreasonably) assumed that the words were in a slightly unconventional order (but that's not unusual for this area) but effectively just meant it was a soup with dumplings in it. \n\nI'm definitely not a dumpling aficionado, and have never been to a dumpling place before, so I know nothing about the lingo that's used and what it all means. A little more explanation, maybe even a hipster-ish pencil representation of each style of dumpling, would be helpful for anyone that, like, isn't an expert because it's what they grew up eating. \n\nI had that problem with a lot of the dishes - couldn't understand what it would look like and if it would be just a couple of bites or a full entree. Something like this \"Shrimp toast: Chinese donut, minced shrimp, spicy aoli $8\" - I was interested but had no idea what to expect, so didn't order it. Is it like 1 slice of sliced bread, kind of size? Or is it a few slices of this dish? What is Chinese donut anyway, I've never heard of it?\n\nAnyway the soup dumplings were tasty enough, but I couldn't help thinking how weird is this, these little tiny bite-size dumplings with a little pork and some hot SOUP inside and dipping sauce? A little weird in my world. I added lots of chili sauce as the dish was lacking flavor a little. \n\nI ordered this dish thinking it would be my lunch - it certainly wasn't enough for a lunch. More like an appetizer for one person. $8.50 was too much for 6 small dumplings that could basically be eaten in 6 bites. If two people were dining together, and all portions are about the same size, I would definitely recommend at least 3 dumpling dishes. \n\nAs I was about to go into a meeting, I needed more sustenance. So I asked to see the menu again (added a picture of it here) and picked the only thing on the menu that I perceived to be a filling dish - noodles. Luckily I had time to order again and wait for another dish to be prepared. Can't go wrong there, right, it's noodles? Well, they were pretty good - certainly didn't disappoint. \n\nI was hoping it wouldn't be a tiny 6-bite portion, and it was not. It was a medium size bowl of delicious noodles, green onions, ginger, soybean paste and savory pork very well flavored and seasoned, unlike the dumplings which were just a touch bland and like anything you can get from the cheap Chinatown vendors with the huge bamboo baskets. I had a similar dish to this at a hip noodle place in LA, but have to admit the LA place blew this one out of the water. \n\nI would love to see more of a combo platter of different dumplings for the solo diner, as there is no way of getting a variety of dumplings except if you have a large group and order 10 different dishes. I know this kind of thing is probably anti-hipster rules though and would offend the purist. \n\nDoubt I will be back as the experience was too perplexing and I rarely have a need to be in this part of the City, but I must admit I had some reasonably good food, though I was trying to find a value-for-money place for lunch and had no idea that I'd be spending $23.75 for 2 dishes and nothing else, with the tip and the obligatory sales tax AND 'SF Mandate Tax 4%'. I was hoping to keep it around $10 all in, ouch.", "author": "Zoe L."}

The you tiao or \"toast\" part of the dish were super crispy and compliments the shrimp. I was a bit disappointed with the XLB because ours came really dry. I saw that the table next to us got fresh fluffy ones so we must have got the last batch before they started a new batch.\n\nBtw even though we didn't get the large XLB, according to one of the server, the tom yum  XLB taste just like it. My friend really liked the tom yum ones as it has a kick to the typical pork XLB.\n\nThe trio buns were so good as well! My favorite one out of the trio was the taro bun because they use real taro as the filling.\n\nOverall, I would give this place a 4/5. I minus one star because the XLB could have been better, but everything else was delicious. It is a bit pricey for dumplings, but I do think some of the dishes taste better than some dim sum resturants.\nI recommend this place if you want to try a twist on your traditional dumplings, but definitely come early!", "author": "Grace Z."}

Not as good as the soup dumpling but it was still good to try. I like how you can drink the soup through a straw! Definitely something different. Be careful when you drink the soup, let it cool down before sucking! It's very hot! \n\n* Beijing Noodles (Pork, green onion, ginger, soybean paste) $9.50 - 5 stars\nThe noodles were very fresh and the texture was perfect. The flavor was great! I just wish the portion was bigger.\n\n*Three-sum (Green tea & milk bun, Beet & taro bun, Egg yolk bun) 3pcs/$6 - 5 stars\nWe got the trio buns! All the flavors were there and the buns were moist. It was indeed a happy ending!\n\nWe both came here with low expectations since there were mixed reviews about this place. But the food turned out a lot better than we expected! The atmosphere was nice. I like how you can see the workers make fresh dumplings through the glass windows. \n\nThey have a mixture of indoor and outdoor seating. They have a few communal tables so if you don't mind eating at the same table with others then they could seat you right away. The space can get pretty tight when it's busy. We sat in the middle communal tables and some people/waiters kept bumping into my seat. I had to really scoot my seat in..\n\nService was good, but not great. We had to wait a while for someone to bring us the bill and it took some time for them to come back with our credit card after. We completely understand since everyone was so busy running tables.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-05-21", "description": "When I first saw dumpling time on Yelp, I was skeptical because I knew there are no legitimate Asian restaurants in this area but given the positive reviews, I decided to give it a shot even though I (accurately) guessed that the people who wrote these reviews have no idea what good ethnic food is. The food was completely tasteless at a 30% surcharge to what it would cost in the Sunset.\n\nWhen I arrived at the restaurant, I took a walk through the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised to find Asian employees making the food and it alleviated my concern of inauthenticity and appropriation. Although that feeling was instantly reversed when I saw the menu, tasted the food, and left the restaurant to eat at another restaurant because I was still hungry after sharing 6 dishes between 3 people.\n\nWhen I saw that xiao long bao was labeled 'xlb' on the menu, I instantly knew I had made a mistake. No self respecting Chinese speaker would ever abbreviate the dish this way, that is a westernized bastardization of the name. Despite this, we had sat down and it was too late to turn back so we ordered the pork dumplings, xiao long bao, tom yum goong, green beans, Bei Jing noodles, and shui Mai.\n\nWhen the food came out, the appearance was fine but once we took a bite, we realized that the food was the same as the restaurant - all exterior appearance and no content. \n\nPork dumplings - first of all, the dumplings were covered in sliced radishes and some kind of cabbage vegetable - what the heck is the chef thinking throwing these random raw vegetables on dumplings? In any case, it's hard to mess up dumplings and they tasted fine. Although I'd rather pay 3 dollars less for a frozen bag with 5x the quantity at 99 ranch for the same quality and taste.\n\nGreen beans - this dish had great reviews and actually looked delicious but unfortunately, we can't see taste. These were the blandest green beans I'd ever had in my life. I was confused because the dish looked liked it would be super flavorful smothered in garlic but it literally had no taste.\n\nBeiJing noodles - similar to the green beans this dish had the appearance of deliciousness, noodles covered in meat paste, but the taste was a huge let down. The meat paste tasted decent but that flavor did not transfer to the noodles. A let down.\n\nXiao long bao and Tom yum goong - the Tom yum goong is basically the same as the xiao long bao except the skin is made of beets. Overall, the dishes were fine - texture of the skin was thin and the meat and soup in the dumplings tasted fine. But they were no better than any other dumpling house and I'd opt to eat at the restaurants in the sunset for 30 percent more quantity at 70 percent the cost.\n\nShui Mai - this dish was fine but again, no better than any hole in the wall dim sum stand you'd find in the sunset, Richmond, or Chinatown. The only difference is that they cost 3x more here.\n\nAll in all, my friends and I were let down by our experience here. For the amount we paid, we should not have left hungry. But we left hungry and desiring food with flavor. There isn't a single dumpling restaurant in the city that is worse than dumpling time. Dumpling time creates picturesque food and did everything right in terms of setting up the restaurant, such as employing people of the same culture to make their food, but there is no substance and taste to anything here.

Next were the pork baos which were mediocre and a bit bland. More seasoning and meat in the filling would be a huge improvement. \n\nWe also ordered the beijing noodles which I was very excited to try.

I was pleasantly surprised by Dumpling Time and had been waiting for a decent Chinese restaurant to open up in the area. The restaurant is rather hidden in Soma in a warehouse area with a nice little patio seating and spacious seating inside. Upon entering, you can see the chefs hand-making the dumplings as you wait about 15 minutes for a table for dinner. I went at 7pm with a friend and we ended up getting seated with another pair at a communal table. \n\n[Dinner]\nThere is about a 15-20 minute wait for dumplings. It is definitely recommended to get 2-3 dishes per person as the portion sizes are extremely small. My friend and I ordered the Beijing Noodles, Xian pork dumplings, Tom Yum dumplings, King Dum, and an order of regular XLB that was messed up because the kitchen gave us another order of Tom Yum instead. There is a limit of one King Dum per table. I really liked the Beijing Noodles and Xian pork dumplings. The Tom Yum dumplings are an interesting twist on the regular XLB dumplings with a beet skin and slightly sweet and sour soup. I would recommend trying this once. The King Dum was disappointing as the skin ripped and all the soup fell out before we could drink it with our straws. The dumpling itself tasted a little bland. \n\n[Service]\nThe service is pretty basic. I think the restaurant is understaffed, with servers scrambling to clean, take orders, and serve all at the same time. However, Dumpling Time is pretty new so I'm sure this will improve. There was a mistake with the kitchen and we ended up receiving two orders of Tom Yum dumplings instead of one of each of the XLBs. Our server was very nice and did not charge us for the messed up order of Tom Yum. \n\n[Decor]\nMusic in the restaurant is really really loud. I would recommend turning this down since there are lot of patrons generating noise as well. I like the open kitchen where you can see the dumpling making, but I would enjoy not having the Giants game playing on the wall as I'm eating. The whole combination is really strange. \n\nOverall, ordering 2-3 dishes here can get pricey, so I would recommend bringing a friend and ordering more dumplings to try.

Drink it fast or it will leak down to the bottom plate. \n\nThe service was slow too. We ordered within 5 mins of sitting down. But we had to wait more than 30 mins for our food to come. There were a decent number of workers but they kept forgetting things for our table.", "author": "Aaron H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-22", "description": "If you don't mind the district, and are looking for the trendiest dumpling place, then look no further!\n\nReservations are not taken, so its important to be there at 5:30. Granted, my boyfriend and I came tonight (a Sunday) and it wasn't particularly slammed-busy. We got there around 5:20 and there were a few groups already ahead of us. The doors opened a little behind schedule. Once they did open though, they seated everyone pretty quickly.\n\nAs all dumpling places prefer, it's best to order all at once. They told us they were out of the shrimp toast, when we tried to order it. However, we did noticed that as our meal was ended, another table had ordered it and received it. It would have been nice maybe for our server to let us know it had become available, since we'd asked... but I guess a reason to go back.\n\nWe got the cucumber with fresno chilis, har gow, (the one with shrimp, cream cheese, and pork), one King XLB EACH (or King Dum), one order of the regular XLB's, and the Tom Yum Goong. That one has pork belly, shrimp, coconut milk, wrapped in a beet skin. (Which is really just dyed with beet juice, we learned.) We also got the Char-siu pork bun, which says it comes with \"a touch of peanut butter.\" Then, we got the trio for dessert which is 3 buns, one of each of their flavors. Green Tea and Milk, Beet and Taro, and an Egg Yolk bun. \n\nThe cucumber was good, albeit a bit oily, plus came with a cilantro leaf, which I find odd since its not meant to be in the dish. Potentially overlap from another appetizer, however I feel like restaurants nowadays should be more careful with stuff like this, to avoid allergies.\n\nThe har gow was very luscious with the cream cheese. it might have been melted, or watered down, but it still was a great combo. The Char-siu was also pretty decadent, due to the peanut butter, but it wasn't overwhelming. I only had a tiny bite and I did enjoy it. Our server recommended pan fried, so that's what we got. Def enjoyed it. \n\nNow, to the XLB's. Of course we had to get the King Dum. Now, before you order, it's not as big as people thing... Also, there are no instructions, and my boyfriend literally asked our server: \"So.... what do we do?\" She said most people drink the broth, and let it cool down, and then kind of just go at it with the spoon lmao. We had to wait for the broth too cool, after poking the hole, and then got that juicy soupyness. Cooling time was a bit but once that was the right temp, we went to town. Lol. \n\nFor the broth - quantity was alright, however, it was lacking that \"oopmh\" of flavor. It was yummy, don't get my wrong, but not that amazing \"wow\" I want. The regular XLB's are the same, as you might imagine. They come in little individual foils, which is nice, and the wrapper was pretty thick, so it was nice not to lose any due to that breaking. However, there is even less broth in these, and if you let them cool down too much, your window of time is closed and the foil will stick to the wrapper. Thick wrappers work against you in that matter lol. \n\nThe Tom Yum Goong were a different story all together! That beet wrapper as a flavor all on its own though, prob from the juice and that broth seemed to have a hint of spiciness! Or some kind of acidity? I -loved- it. I would hands down come back just for these. Same problem with the wrapper and foil tho, however I was quicker with these lmao. \n\nThe trio was also good - we didn't pay attention and were going to order 1 order of the Green tea and 1 order of the beet taro, but she must have realized that, so she was like ok 3 each? We caught ourselves and just got the trio because why not try the egg yolk? \n\nTurns out that was the best decision. That was by far the best of the 3 buns. I guess I have to fight my boyfriend next time for the last one, when we get just that order. \n\nIt is a very cute interior, perfect to instagram, and some of their items were really quite good. Otherwise, I think they tried a little too hard to be trendy or fusion or something? Maybe trying to add to the neighborhood as well. Lol I'm kidding mostly.  But if we had gotten the shrimp toast, maybe I'd feel differently. \n\nWill be back!", "author": "Rachel W."}

Christine and I came on a Sunday afternoon right after the Giants game where we drove from Parking Lot A in China Basin to the Design District where Dumpling Time resides. It only took about five minutes to get there by car and by 5pm we already found at least ten people ahead of us waiting to put their name down and for the doors to open which tells you how revered this place has already become in just four months of being open for business.\n\nDumpling Time is from the team behind Okane, Live Sushi Bar, and the Michelin-starred Omakase and they smartly decided to that this venture would focus on traditional Asian dumplings with a very distinctive California twist. We were sat within the first ten minutes of them opening as we chose to be sat outside on their patio since the day was still quite warm. We were lucky enough to get the table by the window where we saw dumplings being made in the glass-enclosed dumpling room. Perfect weather and table, it doesn't get any better than that.\n\nThe menu is small but mighty at Dumpling Time, as we obviously came for the Dumplings and the Soup Dumplings, otherwise known as the Xiao Long Baos. In terms of traditional Xiao Long Baos, they have two options pork and tom yum goong which are baos filled with pork belly, shrimp, coconut milk and it was uniquely wrapped in a beet skin. The more traditional option was the pork belly, savory soup and shao sing wine. Both were warm to the touch and filled with juicy broth that anyone would sip up if there was overflow, which of course there wasn't any. We also really liked the Xi'an Dumplings as we got the ones filled with pork, cabbage and green onion, they were their mother's \"secret recipe\" and they were plated with such beauty and creativity it was if you were eating artwork with the chives, cherry tomatoes, and radish slices, although they didn't taste as refined as the Xiao Long Baos. We also tried out both the Pork and Chicken Gyozas both of which you can taste the freshness from it being made and fried that moment, one had pork, green onion, ginger and cilantro while the other had chicken, shiitake mushroom, wood ear mushroom, green onion and cilantro. Taste wise, I like the pork better since they were heartier. We also wanted to try the one of the noodle dishes and since there were only two choices, we went with the meat filled Beijing Noodles with minced ground pork, green onion, ginger and soybean paste, my dining mates and I were slightly disappointed in the lack of quantity in the noodles and overall flavor profile. Next time we'd probably skip their noodle dishes and gorge ourselves with all of their dumplings.\n\nBut we didn't skip dessert, as we sampled their Trio of Buns, filled with Green Tea & Milk, Beet & Taro, and Egg Yolk. It was a nice way to sample which of the buns we liked the best, I always go for the traditional egg yolk mainly because it's the least complicated of the bunch and I was right, the egg yolk was sweet and savory all rolled into one.I really like what Dumpling Time is trying to accomplish by mixing in traditional Taiwanese and Chinese cuisine with artisanal fresh flavors and platework you can't go wrong by trying it out for yourself.

The pork xlb was definitely worth the hype, super flavorful and the soup just explodes after you take a bite into the wonton skin. The kingdum, also know as the giant xlb was huge!

They recommend ordering 2-3 dishes per person, and I tried:\n\n-Shrimp Toast ($8, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=SphRhGZouOsj6OAvz8JxvA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=4-gRG1S357m-QfmGmgNuHA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Super unique, since they place a fried shrimp patty on top of half a Chinese donut. I liked this dish, but it was too greasy and filling, and I wish they allowed half orders of this. It's definitely worth trying once, but I would rather order more dumplings the next time around.\n-Crispy Char-Siu Bao (Roasted Pork Belly, Peanut Butter, 3pc/$6, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=a6RlV7FKmyrDu9lJVdr1jw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Xldninai73zyZjQL9z1Niw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): We opted to get this crispy/pan seared, but I didn't think the sear added much to the bao. The filling was good, and the pork belly flavorful. However, you don't taste much peanut butter, and there was too much bun to filling ratio. Although this was good, I would rather order more dumplings the next time around.\n-Pork XLB (6pc/$8, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_Ar5Ob985vipanRvucmphA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this is one of the better version of xlb I've had in a while! The skin was thin, and there was ample soup inside. The meat filling was also seasoned well, and good quality- A must order!\n-Tom Yum Goong (Pork Belly, Shrimp, Coconut Milk, Wrapped in Beet Skin, 6pc/$9, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wFpkoQaYcBvmgiP02PBgWw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Not that great- the beet skin was thicker, and the coconut milk didn't quite work with the other flavors in this dumpling. I wouldn't get this again.\n-Trio of Buns (Egg Yolk Bun, Green Tea & Milk Bun, Beet & Taro Bun, $5.50, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pNwIWwIOUsIWqP_1GFBFDw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nF27eKYYYj3PZSaDtGpAOQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lyTkiQd42noVkb2Z47HKpg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): All were good, and I loved how super fluffy the buns were! The green tea was my favorite, and I liked the subtle milk filling. The egg yolk was super creamy, and the beet and taro was the least favorite just because it didn't have as much flavor as the others. However, I'd definitely recommend ordering the trio once to try all three buns.\n\nOur server was good, and the food came out really quickly. It was nice that they had a homemade chili sauce at the table, but it wasn't spicy at all, and could have used more chili oil. I will definitely be back for more xlb and buns, and also to try their other types of dumplings! There isn't much parking available in this area, but there are some metered street parking spots.", "author": "Amy D."}

The staff was nice and accommodating, but they seem to be very unorganized. The food was very slow to come out. Two parties that sat down 30m after us got their food before us, which is frustrating when you're hungry.

I wish I could have that with porridge all the time. It's basically a roided-up chinese donut. The spicy mayo on it wasn't spicy at all. The shrimp was like the shrimp paste that they steam and deep fry for dim sum. \n\nThe trio of buns included green tea/milk, beet/taro, egg yoke. We ate it in that order. The first two were not that memorable. That egg yoke one though, delish. If a Bao and a egg start had a baby, it would be that. \n\nEverything else was pretty lackluster. The noodles didn't have much flavor. Most of the dumplings had a watered down flavor. It's nice that they can pan fry the baos, but the meat to Bao ratio didn't make it really worth it. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a ok spot.

I've heard that this place wasn't good and was overpriced so I came here with low expectations. This place opens at 5:30pm for dinner and there was already a wait at 5:22pm!! Yep, it's one of those places where lines form even before they open..\n\nEveryone was seated easily since the line wasn't long at all. There is a waitlist where you have to write your name down. Your entire party needs to be present in order for them to seat you. We witnessed a group that was not complete and were not seated until their whole party was there even though the restaurant was practically empty so be sure to come together! The restaurant is pretty big with at least 20+ tables.\n\nThe waiters and chefs were so nice! The service is great and our water carafes were always refilled before it was empty and we had a tiny table with a ton of food and our dishes were cleared fairly quickly.\n\nWe had the chance to try sooo much food between two people so don't judge :p\n\nGarlicky Green Beans - $8 (Rating: 3.25/5)\nI've had better at Kingdom of Dumplings. They were ok but not great and they weren't hot when they came out. The sauce wasn't too flavorful but if you are someone who doesn't need much flavor, you'll like it!\n\nShrimp Toast - $8 (Rating: 3.5/5)\nAfter reading all the reviews prior to coming here, I was expecting this dish to be the bombb! It's literally a chinese donut (which was cooked well and crispy) with a bit of shrimp mixture placed in a hole on top. There was some sort of chinese mustard/mayo lined under the bottom for extra taste which complemented it well. I think this dish is all hype but definitely something you should try yourself. You'll like it if you're a fan of chinese donut/have never tried.\n\nSeafood Gyoza - $9.50 for 5 pieces (Rating: 4/5)\nThe gyoza (potsticker) came out with a green skin made of spinach! The filling had crab, scallop and shrimp and was so flavorful! We almost didn't order gyoza since we didn't think it would be anything special but I'm glad we tried it! There was a semi-crispy layer under the gyoza which is a plus but my friend was hoping it would have been a little crispier. However, I recommend this dish!\n\nBeijing Noodles - $9 (Rating: 4/5)\nReviews raved about this dish so I had to get it! It was good, but it wasn't as amazing as everyone made it sound. I do recommend ordering this dish though because it was flavorful. The noodles were a bit too soft for me but still good. The portion wasn't too big and was easily split into two small bowls but it was perfect for us since there were only two of us. I would order this again!\n\nShrimp & Cilantro Har Gow - $6 for 4 pieces (Rating: 3.75/5)\nShrimp, cilantro, juicy pork goodness?! I didn't expect to like this dish but I did! The skin was made well and the flavors were good. If you like har gow, I recommend this since their regular one comes with cream cheese and I'm not sure how I would like that.. but it sounds different?\n\nKing-Dum Xiao Long Bao - $8 for 1 large one! (Rating: 4/5)\nSuch a cute name! To my surprise, it was pretty good. It's large enough you get a straw to drink the soup out of it! It was kind of hard to eat but you definitely have to order it if you like taking pictures of your food. It was cool to drink my soup through a straw out of the top of my dumpling.\n\nPork XLB - $8 for 6 pieces (Rating: 4/5)\nThe smaller version of the large XLB ^ and it was good. The skin isn't as thin as Din Tai Fung's but it's still pretty good!\n\nTom Yum Goong XLB - $9 for 6 pieces (Rating: 4/5)\nPork belly, shrimp, coconut milk, wrapped in a beet skin which made the skin a bright wine color! To my surprise, I liked this dish a lot because it's different. The flavors were good because I do love Tom Yum soup! I recommend trying this dish.\n\nTrio of Buns \"Happy Endings\" - $5.50 for 3 pieces (Rating: 3.5/5)\nHave you ever tried a bun with custard or milk filling inside? It's pretty good here! There's 3 different colored buns with either custard or milk filling inside. The green one has a green tea flavored bun. We were too full to try the red one to see how the bun tasted. The filling inside isn't the liquidy texture but it's still good. I've had better but the bun flavor is a really cool concept. I'd recommend trying it if you've never tried it.\n\nOverall, this restaurant surprised us! We didn't expect to walk out liking it and eat as much as we did. Of course we had a lot of leftovers but we got to try almost everything! It was easy to find parking in this area so that was a huge plus. I'll definitely be back to try more!", "author": "Valerie T."}

The presentation was beautiful, the beer was so cold and the food was served hot and fresh. We ordered 12 dishes total (not going to list them all) but I'll list my top three. The seafood gyoza was the best I've ever had and so beautiful. The shrimp toast was scrumptioussss. It was like a buttery donut with shrimp. I also really liked the Gan Ban Noodles.

Then we ordered the pork bao and the extra large soup dumplings. \n\nI'd have to say my favorite thing was the garlicky green beans which is probably not good since it's a dumpling restaurant.

I believe I arrived around 11:30 am on a weekday; thirty minutes after they just opened. It started getting busy around 12-12:30. So I highly recommend going around the time they open. \nI got the king dumpling (1 pc $8), shrimp toast ($8), pork xlb (pork soup dumplings 6 pc $8), trio of buns (3 pc $5.50), green beans and steamed shrimp dumplings (shrimp har gow 4pc/$6). The king dumpling came with a mini boba straw to drink the soup but sadly didn't come with the colorful decoration of petals on top like I've been seeing in pictures. I was a bit disappointed by that. However, the green beans came beautifully covered in colorful petals and were really delicious; possibly my favorite dish. I honestly ordered the trio of buns for the picture. I love sweets but for some reason I don't really like sweet custard baos, so I was unsure how I would feel about this dish. I was surprised by how light the sweetness was without it being bland.  The white bun (I'm not sure of the flavor) is my favorite. I believe the red bun is red bean and the green bun is green tea. All three buns have a custard filling inside. All the dishes I ordered were freshly made and very delicious.\nAround the time they got busy, they seem to have forgotten about our last dish- the steamed shrimp dumplings. I understood and assumed they were backed up with orders so decided to wait fifteen minutes before bringing it to their attention. I then asked about our shrimp dumplings and they came back with the news that they are now preparing it. Even though our dish was forgotten, it was worth the wait. \nI love their set up and decor. They had a projecter that played Kpop music videos (I think) on their blank wall. Their seating can seem a bit crammed, especially for the tables that seat two people since they are situated pretty close to another party of two.

If you are looking for the juicy fillings wrapped in delicate skin that somehow manages to not break when you lift it up, and the multicolored deliciousness combo that rivals the authentic stuff you find in Shanghai, then this is the place. Basically it's the only Xiao Long Bao place within SF that compares to Din Tai Fung. Sure the lines are long and the price tag is Americanized, but like I always say, unless you want to buy a plane ticket to China...or drive to South Bay...this is as good as it gets. Order the other stuff on the menu too, I've tried everything and they are all good. There's the giant dumpling you can drink the soup with a straw, that's also pretty rare to see in the US. Good stuff, get it.", "author": "Yi Y."}

In other restaurants that I've been to, the soup inside XLB is kinda greasy. But not here. The broth was clear and tasty and the skin was very thin. Thumbs up. \n\nBeijing Noodles were not very good. They were not chewy and had no texture. Watiress suggested adding soy and chilie sauce from the table. \n\nShrimp toast was interesting. Big bites of shrimp cake on top of Chinese Youtiao (fried donut). A little greasy but not too bad. \n\nSteamed Egg yolk buns were soft. Loved egg custard filling!

Heads up, this place has been opened for a few months and still faces long wait times (30-1hr) during peak hours. So be prepared, but I think the food is well worth the wait. When you get there, put your name down and if time allows, go get wine or beer from The Grove :).\n\nI've been here a few times so I'll just detail the items below, but definitely pair your dumplings with these house chili oil - it is outstanding! And go in a group to try the most!\n\nBeijing Noodles: This is one of my favorite things to order! The noodles are perfectly cooked, but the winner is the ground pork in this dish. It just lends SO much incredible flavor with the ginger and soybean paste! Highly recommend!\n\nGan Ban Noodles: If you're vegetarian or not, I think this dish is solid and differs a lot from the Beijing Noodles to give variety. They are generous with the veggies and it comes in this tasty light peanut flavored sauce. Super good!\n\nShrimp + Cilantro Har Gow: My group wasn't big into cream cheese so we got this one and boy is it yummy! The cilantro just goes so well with the shrimp and the har gow wrapper is perfectly sticky - great texture and flavor combined!\n\nPork Xi'an Dumpling: These were the dumplings with the most subtle flavor in my opinion, but I also think they tasted the freshest. So don't expect outrageous flavor, but it's done well if you appreciate the subtlety :).\n\nPork XLB: I think Dumpling Time did these well, but I don't think it's the best you can find in SF. The broth was flavorful, but didn't have a wow factor and the dumplings were smaller than I'd have elsewhere. I still think Hunan Home is the best place for XLB. That being said, this is still a great place to go when you need your soup dumpling fix and I'd argue it's better than the Din Tai Fung in San Jose.\n\nSeafood Gyoza: These might have been my favorite from the dumplings. The gyoza comes out nice and crispy and I just loved the spinach skin, holding a sizeable amount of flavorful seafood inside. I'd recommend these for gyoza fans :). \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this trendy spot! Come with a group to share and try many of their delicious dishes.", "author": "Sabina S."}

First off, the good: the decor was very nice and modern. They also had a window where you can see how the dumplings are made, similar to ding tai fun. \nThe bad: we ordered the king-dum, pan seared  chicken humbao, and trio of dessert bun. The king dum was a total fail. By the time we got it, the soup have soaked most of the bottom layer and was dripping out of the dish so we barely had any soup to drink.the rest was just standard. The chicken bao was also a failed. It was supposed to be pan seared, yet you can only see slight marks on them, the bao otself was still soft like a regular humbao. And it lacked in flavor, we all had to use a lot of soy sauce. The trio of dessert was just ok. The egg yolk was probably the most flavorful, but they should have name it egg custard. The taro and beet was too dense and had no flavor. And the green one was just very milky. Price wise, it was very expensive. For those 3 dishes, it was around $25! And we were still very hungry.

The menu is full of various dumpling options and the cool part is they are all made on site and you can see them making it. The location is fairly accessible, but during the week it can be hard to find parking. Also to note if you park on the street to be aware of your surroundings as some parts are a bit sketchy.\nThe service here was fast and friendly and the lay out of the place is causal and open. Menu is straight forward with various dumpling, bao, har gow, gyoza options. While not as authentic as other dumpling/dim sum places it's a good place to bring novices to try as they don't have the more interesting items the more traditional places have.\nDuring my visit tried the pork gyoza, pork bao, pork and shrimp soup dumplings, and shrimp & cilantro har gow. Gyoza was ok, crispy with a decent dipping sauce. The bao was soft as a pillow filled with porky goodness. Soup dumplings were ok as well. My favorite was the har gow, as it had large pieces of shrimp and were cooked perfectly.

Needless to say I was beyond excited when I saw Dumpling Time on the \"Hot & New\" list, especially given that they seem to focus on Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings). \n\nHowever, after looking at the menu I felt a bit deflated. When you see Beijing noodle (\u70b8\u9171\u9762) and Shanghai XLB on the same menu, you shall be very alarmed. Beijing and Shanghai, the two metro cities are rivals of each other, and their palates also have some irreconcilable differences. In fact, even today in Beijing you could hardly find a decent Shanghai dumpling place, and most Shanghainese people would not appreciate the saltiness of Beijing noodle. Growing up in Beijing and spent quite some time in Shanghai thanks to my Shanghainese mom, I have *some* reservation about putting these two items on the same menu. \n\nDespite my doubts I decided to keep an open mind and try it for myself. Sadly it didn't pay off this time. \n\nXLB: \n+ Soup was actually very good.\n- Stuffing is bad, lacks texture and falls apart easily.\n- I don't even know how well the skin hold up because it came in a tin foil cup! No self respecting dumpling place should serve XLB like that.  It was very difficult to dip the dumpling in vinegar or even taking a bite because they just get stuck at the bottom. \n\nBeijing noodles: \n+ It's tasty.\n-  It's nothing like Beijing noodles. Beijing noodle comes with very specific thick & salty sauce, very fatty bits of pork belly (not mince meat), and at least 2 veggie toppings (thinly chopped cucumber and bean sprouts are most common). This dish has none of those. As a Beijing person I'm mildly offended. Call it anything but Beijing noodles plz.\n\nOther dishes: \n~ While some dishes sound quite creative, none of them was very memorable. \n\nInterior: \nThe space looked very chic in photos but confusing in real life. \nSide #1: A glass wall with people making dumplings behind it. Since Ding Tai Fung did this in all of their locations this became a trend in restaurants that serve xlb. \nSide #2: A counter, semi open kitchen, some neon signs, then a very hipster white wall with wall art. \nSide #3: A white wall with non-stop Korean(!) music video projected on it. Why?\nSide #4: Windows & two toned (white & greenish blue) wall. Hello 1980. \nWhat are you trying to express Dumpling Time? Make up your mind.\n\nService: \nWhile our servers were nice, we were told to order everything all at once and wouldn't be able to add anything later.\n\nIn general, I'd agree that Asian Fusion is the accurate category for this restaurant and I was very disappointed. Give it a try if 1) you haven't had great XLB before  2) there's no line, it's not worth the wait otherwise.", "author": "Rachel Z."}

It wasn't overwhelming since the shrimp was in the middle and it wasn't too much of it.  \n\nGarlicky green beans - eh it was okay, there wasn't much of a crunch or snap like traditional Chinese restaurant and I feel like it's a bit too oily\n\nBeijing noodles - I don't know how I feel abut this one, i feel like I was eating bland noodles, even with all the ingredients mixed in.  I had to add hot sauce and it just didn't taste right.  \n\nXLB - the soup was okay, but the meat, it didn't taste like traditional XLB, it taste like regular store-bought dumplings.  Most XLBs filling has more of a fattier taste and this one just tasted like regular pan fried dumplings.  Also, it has a bit of a funky smell to it (I don't know how to explain it in English)\n\nTom yum - at least this was a bit different and it wasn't too bad but again, nothing that was out of this world.  Also, didn't taste like tom yum lol.\n\nKing XLB - I don't even know anyone does this, it's really for looks.  The skin was a bit too thick (obviously) but just sucking on the soup through the straw which isn't that easy and you just chunks of the filling.

There was a waitlist and we ended up waiting for about 35-40 minutes.  When we finally sat down, they took our order quickly and food was at our table 6 minutes later.  \n\nWe ended up ordering the Da Hong Pao Oolong Tea, the Shrimp Toast, Seafood Gyoza, Tom Yum Xiao Long Bao, King Dum, Beijing Noodles, and the Three Sum. \n\nThe tea was suppose to have red dates and purple plums.  I taste a hint of dates but not the plums.  It was fragrant though.  \n\nThe shrimp toast was made of shrimp paste on a Chinese donut.  It was creative and the donut was delightfully crispy.  \n\nThe seafood gyoza was in between a potsticker and a boiled dumpling.  It came with a spiced chili butter sauce that was so addicting.  I liked the sauce better than the gyoza itself because I'm not a big seafood fan, but it went well together.  \n\nNext the tom yum xiao long bao.  It came with a beet red color skin.  It tasted pretty much like tom yum goong to me, but my husband couldn't tell.  It was interesting to try this unique dish, but personal preference I don't love tom yum goong, so while it was good, I probably could eat more of the regular xiao long bao.  \n\nThe King dum was interesting but we wouldn't order it again.  The skin was thick and overall it was ok but not great.  More of a novelty item.  \n\nThe Beijing noodle were ok.  It wasn't too special and the bowl of noodles was relatively small.  \n\nExtra points for the three-sum option of a variety of buns.  I liked them in the order, beet and taro, egg yolk, and my favorite the green tea milk bun.  The green tea tastes the most unique.  It has a milky filling, but tasted a bit coconutty too.  \n\nThe meal was somewhat expensive but we did order a lot of food and the food was unique.  Nice little dim sum treat!", "author": "S Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-17", "description": "More accurately 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 for swiftness of service (not to be confused with swiftness of getting seated) and food. Came here with a friend as a belated birthday lunch, and spent a little less than an hour waiting. The waiting experience is further dampened by the fact that Dumpling Time isn't surrounded by any shops or places you can wander around. \n\nDumpling Time is a pretty good novelty dim sum experience. I would maybe even come back, if my friends were up for getting there before they open. But the quality of food is underwhelming for how much it costs. The xian dumplings all had broken skin, and the Beijing noodles were salty enough to make me feel parched for the rest of the day. The xiaolongbao were good, but nothing distinguishes them from the xiaolongbao you can get at another dimsum place for half the wait. I have to say that the shrimp toast (shrimp on youtiao) was my favorite, it's a big pull factor for returning.\n\nThis is one of those try it once places, but pleasantry of experience will probably be contingent on getting there early and not expecting anything radically different from normal dim sum.", "author": "Amy J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-18", "description": "My friends and I were lured here by all the pretty pictures and glowing reviews. The wait was about 30 minutes for a party of 4 on Tuesday night at 7:15pm. There were 13 parties ahead of us when we first put our name on the list but 40-50% of them left so we didn't have to wait as long. \n\nI should preface by saying I am a snob when it comes to asian food. I only like authentic asian cuisines and this restaurant should be classified as asian fusion. \n\nFirst of all - This is not a Dim Sum restaurant. Dim Sum is cantonese and XLB are shanghainese. Jiao Zi and XLB is not Dim Sum. (XLB is commonly eaten at dimsum but it is not dim sum. It's Shanghainese) They do serve a weird version of \"har gow\" and a very americanized cha siu bao but those are the only items that can be considered dim sum. \n\nWe shared a number of items between the 4 of us. \n\nShrimp Toast - my friends like this one but I couldn't have it because it contained butter. What chinese restaurant uses butter? -- eek! definitely asian fusion. \nActually all of their dishes are asian fusion. Nothing that authentic. \nPork XLB - this one tasted okay, but they all came with diapers. I know they did this because americans can't pick up a xiao long bao properly with chopsticks, but just no. They also give you red vinegar to go with this dish. No. Pork XLB should be served with black vinegar. -__-\nTom Yum XLB - My friends liked this one too, but I'm born and raised in shanghai and this dish is terrible. \nGiant Bao - this one is the giant XLB that everyone sees in pictures. Ours did not come out looking pretty or tasting great. it was okay. \nXian Jiao Zi (Dumplings) - this was probably my favorite. They serve this like a little floral salad. It's pretty but I like my dumplings without extra olive oil. \nBeijing Noodles - comes with ground pork. It's pretty good, but very oily. \nPork Bao & Cha Siu Bao - both very small compared to other restaurants and nothing special. \n\nPortion sizes for everything were very small. Tasted above average for an americanized dumpling shop, but way way overpriced. Presentation is a novelty and really didn't add much -- sometimes it added negatively like in the case of XLB diapers. \n\nIf you don't eat asian food often and you want pay extra, waiters/waitresses that speak perfect english, plenty of inefficiencies just like a typical american restaurant then come to dumpling time! \nIf you actually want to experience real authentic chinese dumplings at a real chinese restaurant, do yourself a favor and head over to sunset, inner richmond (within SF) or millbrae, Cupertino. You'll get much better chinese dumplings at much better prices.", "author": "Annie Z."}

A bit out of the way, and waits can be long, but it's worth the journey.\n\nI didn't have high expectations for the food, since the restaurant seems to cater to the Instagram/Snapchat crowd, a phenomenon in which taste is inversely correlated with post-worthy aesthetics. See: \"Dragon's Breath\" liquid nitrogen puffs, Unicorn Frappucinos, etc. But my group ordered Dumpling Time's two most novel offerings, the Tom Yum Goong XLB, wrapped in a pretty red beet skin, and the King Dum, a giant XLB whose soup you have to drink with a straw, and they were both excellent.\n\nThey certainly don't beat Din Tai Fung or other good, legit Asian joints, but the food was still great. \n\nMy only gripes: \n- A lot of the soup escaped the King Dum, and we had to drink it from the dish it fell into, which I guess is natural, but annoying. It was hard to break apart into smaller pieces, too. I guess that is one of the cons of giant, Instagrammable food. \n- The place is pretty expensive (for me - typical for a trendy restaurant in the city), and dishes are small. We each paid about $30 before tip.\n- Servers didn't offer refills on our teapot, which was also expensive (and it's supposed to be for one person, but we stretched it out to two). I know this isn't an authentic Asian restaurant, but seriously... It's hot water. And as a tea enthusiast, part of the tea experience is drinking it through multiple steepings, especially with a complex tea like our pu-erh.\n\nFinally, I wanted to say I'm really disappointed that the dessert section of the menu is called \"Happy Endings,\" especially since the owner is Asian. So many Asian women are stereotyped, assumed to be sex workers who give \"happy endings\" just because of their race, and sexually harassed or assaulted. It also just contributes to the hypersexualization of Asian women in general. I've personally been harassed on the street by men who ask if I can give them a happy ending (along with other brilliant lines like \"suki suki\" and \"will you love me long time?\"). Treating this like a fun joke only perpetuates things. Seriously, just change it, please.", "author": "Maya K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-08", "description": "Wow...I seriously can't believe how much the Yelp community has let me down on this place.\n\nWe came here a little before closing at the end of lunch in order to avoid a wait, and it worked. We only ordered an order of the king size xlb and the tom yum goong xlb just to try the place out. \n\nThe tom yum goong xlb came individually in a tin pan that you normally get an egg tart in. It's a bit shocking as I've never seen a place take the easy way and cheat like that. If you're a xlb place, you should have the technique down to not need a pan to hold these dumplings together. Even the mom and pop place in Newark got that technique down. The other issue with it is that it is difficult to get it out of the pan without breaking the entire thing. The skin was thin but the top was so thick that all you can taste was the dough. This was the same issue with the king size xlb as well (which the soup did not flow out when you poke the straw into it, like the server had told us it would, I poked it 4 times trying to get the soup to flow until I realized there was not much soup in it to begin with). The filling for the tom yum goong was better than the pork as the pork was lacking flavor. The other issue is with the soup, I've never had xlb broth this bland. It tasted as if it came from a bunch of meatless chicken bones and a smidge of msg. There was also not enough ginger in the dipping vinegar sauce. \n\nHonestly if this place was in anywhere else other than SF, I would not be as critical. In SF, you have such great places to get great xlb in the sunset or outer Richmond or even the peninsula. Dumpling Time should have been able to do better research on taste anywhere in the city or even looked into Din Tai Fung, instead of just focusing on making that king xlb instagramable. Coming from a team that has garnered a Michelin star for omakase, I'm a bit appalled and shocked. \n\nMaybe we came on an off day, but I don't think I'd risk coming back for mediocre xlb.", "author": "Linh H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-29", "description": "TL; DR As far as I'm concerned, Dumpling Time is severely underrated on Yelp. I came here last night honestly not expecting much (except a long line). I left extremely content. \n\nI will say there was a long line out front when we arrived. There were likely 10 groups ahead of us and we got seated in 20 minutes. It wasn't a long wait at all despite looking daunting at first. \n\nWe ordered the Vegetarian Xi'an Dumplings, Chicken Gyoza, Char-Siu Bao, Pork XLB, and egg yolk buns for dessert. Everything was brought out very quickly. We were probably only there for about 40 minutes. \n\nThe Xi'an Dumplings were decent. They tasted somewhat like a veggie spring roll. Same fresh taste. Not really up my alley but that's just me. \n\nThe chicken gyoza was excellent. They had a good amount of heat and a nice crunch to them. \n\nThe Char-Siu Bao were probably my favorite item that I tried. Quite possibly the best pork buns I've had (and I've had a lot). They weren't too doughy which is a nice change since some pork buns are more dough than filling. \n\nThe pork xlb were extremely gingery. I don't mind ginger but this was a bit much. However, when you pair it with the red vinegar sauce they give you it was perfect! Took the bite out of the ginger. Great pairing!\n\nLastly, the egg yolk buns were really really great. It's basically a steam bun filled with a thick custard. I was a huge fan! I'll definitely be coming back here.", "author": "Nick D."}

Trendy dim sum with a modern twist with added colors and creativity. \n\nDIM SUM:\nThe menu is very limited as it is only 1 page consisting of xiao long baos, buns, gyozas, noodles, chinese donuts and of course their XL xiao long bao. We ordered: \n+ Tom Yum XLB $9/6: My friends weren't the biggest fan of the flavor, but I actually thought it tasted pretty good with a kick of spiciness\n+ XL XLB $8: Apparently they only have a limited number of these per day. The concept is definitely unique and originated from Shanghai. The bun itself is really pretty, but the content on the inside is lacking meat and mostly contains pork juice. Not sure it's worth $8. \n+ Trio of yolk buns $5.50: matcha bun, regular yolk bun and beet and taro bun. The matcha bun has very subtle flavor, taro and beet was voted least favored in our group and yolk bun was most favored. \n+ Pork Gyoza $5: tasted like any other gyoza with added decoration that makes the dish look more appealing. \n+ Sui Mai $5: this was their special of the day. It tasted like any other sui mai at typical dim sum places, but I did appreciate that it didn't have chucks of fat in it like some lower quality places. \n\nSERVICE: \nFriendly waiters, although it does take awhile to flag someone down when it gets super busy. The food came out somewhat promptly considering how busy it was. We came here 10min before they opened and there was already a crowd - we ended up waiting about 1 hr to be seated. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nThere is plenty of parking nearby so that's a big bonus. There is seating inside and outside, but not very big compared to typical dum sum restaurant. Very clean and brightly lit. You can also watch cooks make the XLB while you wait! \n\nVerdict: Overall, I think I would rather just go to Dragon Beaux or other dim sum shops, but this new location appeals to the latest modern dim sum trend.", "author": "Samantha F."}

Wasn't bad, but didn't quite live up to its hype. \n\nWe ordered:\n- Cucumber salad: Holy crap. This is so overpriced for $5, it was almost comical. Luckily it tasted great, but for $5, I expected something larger than a drink coaster-sized container of thiny sliced cucumbers.\n- All the XLB, including the King-Dum, Pork XLB, and Tom Yum Goong: I liked the Tom Yum Goong the best because it was the most unique. Everything was overall not bad, but I didn't think any of these were nearly as flavorful as XLB should be. Plus some of them fell apart while lifting them out of the bamboo steamers, which is a big no-no. The King-Dum was fun to order and eat though because they give you a straw.\n- Shrimp & Cilantro Har Gow: Not bad, not very memorable.\n- Beijing Noodles: Definitely their best dish, but portions were small.\n- Chicken Gyoza: More shiitake mushroom than chicken, which I didn't mind. Tasted pretty good.\n- Trio of buns (egg yolk, green tea & milk, beet & taro): Came out piping hot, which I liked. The beet & taro was by far the least sweet, so pick that one if you're sensitive to sugar! Green tea & milk and the egg yolk bun were both very creamy, though the green tea could've used more green tea to differentiate it.\n\nFor a place named Dumpling Time, I don't think they do a great job at making dumplings.

I'm a huge fan of XLB so when I saw that Dumpling Time had an XL XLB (extra large or King-Dum as they call it on their menu), I needed to have it. My group of 3 was seated out on the patio within minutes of arriving. There is a window where you can watch the Dumpling masters. We ordered all three varieties of XLB, Beijing Noodles, pork XiAn dumplings, cucumber Fresno salad and the dessert bun trio. Of all the items we ordered, we were only satisfied with the two varieties of normal sized XLB and the dessert bun trio. The large XLB was too big and all the soupy flavor was lost. The noodles lacked a lot of flavor and the type of noodle they chose did not stick to the sauce. The cucumber Fresno salad also lacked flavor as it should have been more vinegary. It felt as though, the cucumber were just dipped in vinegar 15 min prior. The pork Xi'An dumplings were also very disappointing. There was no flavor at all. Now that I've critiqued those dishes, I'll go through the dishes that I enjoyed. The soup in both of the XLB was flavorful (especially the Tom Yum one) and the Dumpling wrapper was light and thin, exactly what they should be!!! The tom yum variety was also very unique which I appreciated. The dessert bun trio was great as we got to try all the varieties shared. The bread part was deliciously sweet and light in texture.

This is the prettiest dim sum you'll ever eat.\n\nFor the full-review, I'll be going over all the dishes (in order) my girlfriend and I ordered on very empty stomachs after a BART ride: \n\n~ THE FOOD ~\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Pickled Lotus, $5 - it's basically a lighter version of a classic lotus dish.  It had more of a vinegar taste and not long marinated, but if you like lotus and that satisfying crunch, it was a really refreshing take and fantastic palate cleanser between later dishes.\n\nThe first main item that arrived was the Seafood Gyoza, $9.5 for 5pc.  Holy crap.  This was an instant 10/10, beyond amazing with the paired sauces.  Everything about it tasted amazing, the seafood mixture, sauces, and crispiness of the pan-fried bottom was paired perfectly.  Definitely order this if you like anything seafood related or a texture/flavor bomb.\n\nWe later ordered Chicken Gyoza, $7 got 5pc, btw.  It was still great (like a 8/10 relative to the seafood gyoza) but didn't have that euphoric food wars-esque feeling when we ate it.\n\nMoving onto bao's, we got the Char-Siu Bao, $6 for 3pc.  We weren't unanimous on our love for it, but overall it was really good.  The char-siu flavor wasn't super strong or candied tasting, but the peanut butter worked really well actually - it was more like a peanut satay sauce.  The actual dough was super light, fluffy, and mildly sweet with a perfect proportion of filling to bun.  I wish I tried the pan-seared option though, heads up that you can take advantage of that.\n\nNow for the real reason we came here initially: the xiao long bao, specically the KING DUM, $8 for 1 ~massive~ piece.  The King Dum is by far, the prettiest, largest, soupiest xiaolongbao I've ever had.  It was literally a massive XLB, everything else was the same, except it came with a bunch of pretty flowers and stuff on top too.  It definitely had a ton of soup, and the novelty to drink soup out of a boba straw is worth it the first time.  Otherwise, it's clearly not a go-to dish to share with friends or order beyond the initial holyfriggincrapsnapchat factor.\n\nPork Xiao long bao, $8 for 6pcs.  Now I would get this on a daily basis if I could.  This is just a traditional, perfectly executed rendition of the nostalgic XLB we all crave.  The price is pretty fair imo - for comparison, Berkeley's cheapest is around $6-7 for 6pcs.\n\nOnto dessert, the Happy Endings (lmao).  We ordered the Trio of Buns, $5.50 for 3pcs.  It's pretty much what you would expect.  The egg yolk was definitely the best, had a fantastic rich flavor with that filling.  The green tea and milk was mainly milky tasting, and the beet and taro was essentially a colorful taro bun with minimal flavor.  They were all good and light tasting, but the egg custard bun would be my sole order next time.\n\n~ PRICE, AMBIANCE ~\n\nGrand total was about $35/person after everything, and it was definitely worth it (especially considering SF food prices).  My girlfriend and I were both stuffed with dim-sum beyond the grade of a traditional restaurant.  Even though it didn't have the entertaining push-cart system where you point, over-order, and get a wide plethora of dishes, I still loved the experience.  Dishes came really fast, though you could hear them preparing it fresh in the kitchen after you ordered.\n\nOn that note, tips: If you seat near the kitchen, the sizzling is super, super loud.  You have the option of sitting outside, though it could also get some street noise or wind.  Otherwise the restaurant is bright, nicely decorated, and casual.\n\n10/10 would seafood gyoza again", "author": "Bryan T."}

However, the prices are fair considering the location and quality of food.\nNow city folks can rejoice in being able to get yummy dumplings without having to venture into Chinatown or Sunset!\n\nModern, clean interior. Fast-casual sit down restaurant with plenty of seating inside and a semi-outdoor patio outside. A bit cramped and loud. Patrons consist more of the early 20's-30's Instagram crowd and young SOMA residents who live in the immediate area.\n\nService staff is super nice, fast, and come equipped with excellent recommendations. Props to the server who was able to seat us 5 mins before closing time (2:55 PM!!). We literally had to order right when we sat down and nicely assisted us with recommendations without rushing us completely. Some restaurants are super strict about closing time and don't even seat people 15 minutes before closing, so much appreciated!\n\nSHRIMP TOAST - Nothing special for me, exactly what you would expect based on the pictures (shrimp in the fried Chinese doughnut dough). Yeah, it's good (B/C FRIED!!) but it's not out of the ordinary and I wouldn't recommend ordering it unless it's your first time trying Chinese doughnut!\n\nSEAFOOD GYOZA $9.5 for 5 - My second favorite! The filling was delicious (creamy and sea-foody) but the bottoms could be crispier and more fried.\n\nCHAR SIU BAO $6 for 3 - just OK for me, though if you really love char siu baos and don't often get to have it, this would be a solid option. The dough was fragrant and fluffy and the filling was good.\n\nBEIJING NOODLES $9 - very good but the noodles were just a touch too soft for me. Right amount of filling and spot-on with the sauce.\n\nVEGETARIAN XI AN DUMPLING $8 - MEH. Just meh. Skip.\n\nPORK XLB - My favorite! SUPER juicy and skin was nice and thin!\n\nTOM YUM GOONG XLB - also very good but it tasted nearly identical to the pork XLB and the skin was a bit thicker.

I came to DT with the highest expectations, thanks Yelp...but DT definitely delivered. Like DTF, you can view the dumplings and baos being made while you wait outside, which is super cool. There was quite a wait when it just opened but they had a nice system for seating people swiftly. The parking lot is rather small so it may be a good idea to get street parking. DT, like it's name, focuses on dumplings and baos instead of entrees like DTF's vegetable stir fries and what not. The items on the menu may seem novelty (I'm looking at you giant dumpling and tom yum XLB!), but after trying the tom yum XLB, I was incredibly surprised that the food here wasn't just a fad or merely instagrammable and actually crazy tasty! Food price I'd say is ranked just before pricey (on a treat yourself note, maybe not for a college student like me), but is well worth the cost from time to time. Every dish tasted delicious and the sauce following the XLB were incredible! I loved everything we ordered and will be back again. The staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming and the ambience of the restaurant, which is a little dark for my taste, was quite nice. I was in awe of the projector on the wall, showing us Kpop music videos...that is such a creative idea. I usually itch for dessert after a good meal but after being so wow-ed and full from the food at Dumpling Time I was perfectly content without it all the way home. And even slept in a great food coma afterwards...if you've wanted to try it and enjoy dumplings, go to DT and give it a shot.", "author": "Bonnie T."}

Just as you expect, it's made for social media, instagram, snapchat, etc, but hows it taste? Meh. Lots of broth, but if you wanted it just for the broth, u would have gotten soup. Once you drink the broth out of the boba straw, your wondering how do I eat this thing? My choice was to pull it out of the steamer and put it on the plate that was under it. Put the sauces on it and eat it with the won ton soup spoon. I didnt think chopticks would work well and I didnt have a knife. Not something I should get again thats for sure.\n\nXLB - Pretty good and exactly what you expect. No surprises, just solid XLB\n\nTOM YUM GOONG - This one surprised me. Better than the XLB and the best thing I had here for sure. More flavor and it just stood out.\n\nShrimp Toast - It got better with every bite. It was a great starter and something I would definately get again.\n\nCucumber, fresno chili salad - overpriced and not worth it. Fairly bland and the cucumber salad i typically get for $3 at a thai place is way better and larger portion.\n\nCHICKEN BAO  - I didnt care for this. Chicken is never my choice when picking items unless its wings or fried. Chicken just doesnt have much flavor.. Besides the chicken, I didnt care for any of it. It was all fairly bland.\n\nJust a heads up on the King Dums, if you go, go early. I was there around 1230 and it was sold out.

I have to say... the naming convention of their food is kind of strange... we ordered the pork pot stickers, pork bao, three-sum, pork xl and king dum. Everything tasted amazing and pretty close to what I would eat in China. One thing I really liked was for all the pork fillings they mix it was cabbage, many dumpling places don't do that and it makes the filling kind of hard and dense. By adding in the cabbage (which I do at home also) make the filling more enjoyable and lighter on the stomach. As for the star of our meal, the king dum, I was expecting a full soup dumpling but there's actually meat inside as well! In a way I liked it, knowing I wasn't purely consuming fat, but it also made it kind of hard to drink the soup with the straw.

We scored parking in one of the few spots directly in front of the door. The restaurant has a nice outdoor patio that's covered. The restaurant  had someone with a clipboard come out at 11:02 to take our names and party size and went back inside. I didn't really see the point of taking down our names and party size if the restaurant wasn't even open?? And there were only 2 parties in line at that moment hahaha. Well, whatever. We were seated once my name was called. I've recently dined at Din Tai Fung, so I'm apologizing in advance because my comparisons seemed to be automatic.\n\nAs first timers we ordered\nStarters:\n-garlicky green beans: garlicky green beans are always a good idea. but they weren't perfectly blanched\n-shrimp toast: not sure what they use as the \"toast\" part but i really enjoyed this item\n\nSmall Bites:\n-cucumber salad: the cucumbers didn't have any peel and were sliced lengthwise. I prefer the cucumbers not sliced lengthwise and prefer the peel\n\nHar Gow (steamed dumplings):\n-shrimp : this has cream cheese but I could barely taste it\n-shrimp & cilantro: i'm not big on cilantro and will only eat it when necessary. the combo of shrimp and cilantro with the paired cilantro dipping sauce was complementing\n\nNoodles: \n-beijing noodles: a tad bit bland but my son loves noodles and still loved it\n\nGyoza (pan crisped dumplings):\n-chicken: filled with a lot of meat and the dumpling wrapped itself wasn't so thick. i think it maybe drizzled with a little spice (orange flakes on the picture) just fyi if you have kids. my son grabbed it so fast and licked the flakes and said \"spicy\" \n\nXLB (soup dumplings):\n-king dum: instagram worthy for $8 \n-pork xlb\n-tom yum goong: red colored because of the beet wrapper\nI LOVE XLB and these actually tasted good. BUT.... what I didn't like at all was that the XLB was lined with an aluminum liner. So actually, the bottom of the dumplings stuck to the liner! This made eating it soooo messy. We tried so many ways to remove the liner and even if you try to peel the liner off first instead of making a hole at the top , pulling the liner can create a hole and the soup spills from the bottom! I like eating XLB by putting it directly into the spoon. Isn't it supposed to be that way?? This was a big no no for me especially since XLB was my favorite and we ordered a lot of it. We got tired of making such a mess we just got over it and took it home. The left over XLB (we took home) didn't stick to the liners I guess because it was cold already.\n\nAnd why is their plates soo small? It was literally just a little bigger than a teacup saucer but it was square shaped. The green beans barely fit the length of the plate. Fyi soda is served by the can. \n\nI wish they had chocolate XLB like DTF. That probably would've made me give them another star.\n\nI enjoyed the food here and would dine here again only when they get rid of the aluminum liners for the XLB but I noticed that the staff serving you here aren't as knowledgeable as the staff as DTF. Example, as we were packing our food, we asked the waitress to get \"extra of this sauce\" (& was holding up the actual sauce to show her) and her response was \"Which one is that?\" Uhhh. YOU tell me which one that is. It's not even like there was barely any sauce left to tell what it was!\n\nOh and on this note I have to mention something about the bust boy or whatever their title is -- the ones who just clean up your dirty dishes!! He comes to our table to remove some dishes & I politely ask for napkins. I don't have an accent either. He nods his head and says \"Ok.\" But then the waitress comes over and says \"He said you needed something?\" Uhh. Why can't he get me the napkin. Or why can't he tell her it is a \"napkin\"? Later on,  I asked him for \"a FORK for my son please\". He again nods his head and says \"Ok.\" I was watching him and AGAIN, he tells our waitress to come to our table. With my own eyes I see that he doesn't tell her I need a \"fork\". That's weird to me. Unless it's a rule that he can't get the table anything and it must be a Waitress to do it???

Overall, if you're into hyped up mediocre dumplings then I guess this is the spot for you.", "author": "Cristal C."}

There aren't really any seats around for people waiting, and most people wait outside, so expect to stand for a bit, and don't leave yet -- the food is worth it and it doesn't take too long for the food to get to you once your seated. \n\nSERVICE:\nWe ended up sitting outside, and despite it being a bit windy, it wasn't bad at all since they have 4 (i think) overhead heaters. I was scared that the tables were placed too closely and you could hear each other's conversations, but it actually wasn't, so cheers to that!\n\nNow, onto the delicious BAOSSS: \n**I love that all the dumplings come with their own specialized sauces**\n1) Vegetarian Dumpling (2/5) - Of all of food I got, this was the most beautiful dish. Funny story actually - the dumpling wrap is a deep green spinach wrap, and it was topped with all these beautiful vegetables that the spinach wrap camouflaged with it so I thought I ordered a salad ---until I dug in and realized they were dumplings. Most of the filling were chives, and the skin is on the thicker side, but it was appropriate for this dish. However, I'm personally not too big of a fan of chives, and this dish didn't super stand out for me. The halved cherry tomatoes and slices of radish (?) also didn't really add to the flavor of the dish, only the aesthetics. The sauce was a must to improve the taste of a rather blander tasting dumpling. \n2) Chicken Gyoza (5/5) - I loveeee this dish! There wasn't really any extra dumpling skin like you see with most dumplings, and the skin is a bit more glutinous, though not thaat thick. The filling itself had a lot of texture and wholesomeness with the wood ear mushroom (crunch) and the shiitake mushroom and chicken. The sauce also complimented the dumplings very well, though I probably could have eaten it without it. Only thing I would say is that it wasn't that crispy on the exterior, if that's what really matters to you. \n3) Chicken Bao (4/5) - Their baos are very soft, and the filling was delicious, chicken and wood ear mushroom. However, I wouldn't say it's super wow or anything. \n4) Pork XLB (5/5) - Its not easy to find places that make perfect XLB and this place is no exception - I have a bit of a higher standard for XLB. What I loveee about it is that the skin is thin, filled with plenty of delicious soup with a slight note of ginger, and the flavor of the whole thing is delicious. My only drawbacks are 1) most XLB I've had at traditional places aren't cooked in individualized foil trays, which easily causes the thin skin to rip and precious soup to spill out and 2) the meat was a little too soft for my taste - it kind of broke apart in my mouth rather than for me to chew it down - I like my texture! However, these two drawbacks couldn't bring down my impression of these wonderful juicy XLB. \n5) Trio Bun (4/5) - Again, super soft baos and though very delicious, it didn't have a \"WOW\" factor. The egg custard bun was very similar to what'd you find at dim sum restaurants, the filling being more on the pasty side than the liquidy yolk. The matcha bun had a white filling, with the texture similar to the egg custard bun, but having a great matcha taste. The taro bun was filled with reaaaal taro, mashed to a smoother consistency with a little bit of chunkiness.", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

While the food itself isn't bad, it's not significantly better than what you can get at other Chinese restaurants around the area. And while I'll admit that the craftsmanship and skill of their dumplings, and particularly the XLB, is better than most of these places, that alone doesn't justify almost double the price (i.e. 6 XLB at Dumpling Time will run you $8, while the same at Kingdom of Dumpling runs you a little under $5) when they otherwise pretty much taste the same.\n\nIf you still do insist on trying the place, the dumplings, of course, are their namesake, and what you should try, as their noodles and baos were a little lackluster.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The place is fairly spacious, but crowded, with little room to move between tables, so you'll have to wait for one of the side tables, either towards the front or back door, to clear up.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Most of the tables before us were parties of 2 and the list moved fairly fast. We were seated at 12:45am and were asked what we wanted to order fairly quickly. Left the restaurant at 1:55pm, but could have left at 1:45pm if it wasn't for waiting for the bill. \n\nFOOD\nWanted to order the super big xlb (that you drink with straw) but they ran out already!! Darn.\n-Celery, yuba, peanut salad $5- fresh ingredients and good flavor. Only wished there was more\nShrimp toast $8- most yelpers like and recommend this one. I thought it was good, but I was not wowed.\n-Tom yum goong xlb 6 pc/$9- cool reddish colored xlb. Skin was thin (some parts too thin and it broke!), juicy. Doesn't taste like Tom yum that much, was still worth it to try \n-Pork xlb 6 pc/$9- super juicy and the pork had good flavor, not mushy like other places!! Skin is thin and didn't break as much as Tom yum one. Delicious and the favorite item I had here\n-Seafood gyoza 5pc/$9.5- wow super 'crunchy' but not very flavorful. Reminds me of 'ha gao (shrimp dumpling)' but less flavor. That's why it came with two different sauces, a spicy soy sauce-ish and a butter mayo-ish dipping sauce. \n-Trio of buns- one of each type of dessert bun: beet/taro, green tea/milk, egg/milk 3 pc/$5.5- better than I expected. At first I thought it tasted raw, but maybe it's just the flour taste. The texture is super fluffy and soft. Not too sweet. Good to share.\n\nSERVICE\nService was alright. Most staff are young. We were seated quickly, had to share a table for four with another couple, but that was fine. Waiter came by to take order very fast, even before we were ready. No mistakes with our orders, but there was a long wait until we got our last dish- seafood gyoza. They bring whichever item is ready (regardless of savory or dessert item). Bus boys seem to not have very steady or quick hands. Husband accidentally spilled water on the table and nobody wiped it up for us. So even though the decor is super cute, this place is a spot that's super casual and quick where they try to quickly get as many people in and out. However, it took a while to get our bill and even longer for the waiter to come back to get our credit card. The table next to us saw that it was taking a while so he gave his credit card to the waiter when the waiter picked up our bill and credit card. When about to sign, husband saw that the credit card was not his... it was the other table's. So we gave it to them. When husband got his card, we realized we had the other table's bill. So they charged the card on the wrong bill. It was a $10 difference so I gave the other table a $10 bill. Aiyaaaaa...\n\nDECOR/AMBIANCE\nNot a huge space but brightly lit and comfortable. Larger communal tables in the center. There is a waiting area outside with heaters where you could wait outside and a window from where you can see xlb being made by hand. Noise level is fairly loud but not uncomfortable. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food, especially the pork xlb and would come back to try other items like the savory buns, noodles, and the super large xlb. Not recommended for big parties, 4 is max in my opinion. Service could be better, but perhaps that will come with time. Just have the mindset that this is a quick in and out Chinese restaurant and you won't be disappointed. :D", "author": "Iris H."}

I grew up eating my grandma's homemade dumplings every weekend, and my mom makes the best Beijing style noodles in the world. So I'm already pretty biased.\n\nBut Dumpling Time is right across the street from my apartment, so I had to try it. They really crammed the tables in here - my waitress had to ask me to scoot my chair in multiple times and we moved our table at a certain point so another waiter could get by. The wait wasn't too bad, but there was definitely a line as it got later into the night. There's one lone dumpling maker in the Din Tai Fung style glass room.\n\nThe good:\nTheir pork XLB had really good flavor. Their skins were a little too thin, and the waiters should really let people know how to eat them. There were a lot of confused people around me. But the XLB weren't too oily or greasy. Solid B+!\n\nGarlic string beans were really tasty as well.\n\nPork gyoza weren't traditional, but the filling was tangy and flavorful.\n\nThe mediocre:\nThe giant XLB is definitely Instagram worthy, but the flavor was really bland.\n\nThe pork dumplings looked beautiful, but tasted very sweet. We didn't even finish them.\n\nThe Beijing noodles - where is the soybean paste? I just got a pile of noodles and ground pork. The paste is what makes them distinct!\n\nFor San Francisco standards, Dumpling Time isn't very expensive, but for dumplings themselves, they were very overpriced.

A line started forming after our party but the wait isn't too bad because the service is super quick and people were seated within 20 minutes of waiting. Parking is really limited in front of the store but there are more parking options around the corner in the more industrialized areas. Items are made to order so it is guaranteed fresh! We ordered the xlb, tom yum goong, seafood gyoza, king dum, and the seared bbq pork bao. The seafood gyoza was everyone's favorite with huge fresh shrimp pieces inside. The tom yum goong was my second favorite with a unique thai soup flavor. The seared bbq pork bao was alright and the peanut butter inside has a very mild taste that isn't too overpowering but rather compliments the bao. The xlb and king dum were okay; I wouldn't drive all the way back here for it and I mainly purchased the king dum for its novelty factor. \nOverall, it was a nice cute place to try out something new!

To start, we had the shrimp toast and this was honestly the best dish we had here -- the donut bread and shrimp in one bite was a satisfying combo. Next we ordered the vegetarian dumplings and the lobster dumplings. Both were pretty tasteless, and the lobster dumpling had barely any lobster in it. Without sauce, it felt like we were chewing just simply flavorless cooked dough. The presentation was nice, the prices were okay, and the environment was cool because of the group seating style.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-01", "description": "I give this place 4.5 stars, le bf would give this place 5 stars, and when asked why, he said price.\n\nLe bf and I came on a weekday night around 6:15pm. We came early because we read that if you came later, lots of things would be sold out, and you could tell that some people weren't very happy about it on Yelp. As we walked in, most of the tables were already filled, but luckily, there was a table for 2 by the window and we were quickly seated there. Having studied Yelp and the menu, we knew exactly what to get. At 6:15, we managed to order everything we wanted, and nothing at that time was sold out. \n\nWe got:\n1. Garlicky Green Beans ($8)\n2. Shrimp Toast ($8)\n3. Pork Gyoza ($7.50)\n4. Char-Siu Bao ($6)\n5. Shrimp Har Gow ($6)\n6. Shrimp & Cilantro Har Gow ($6)\n7. Pork XLB ($8)\n\nAs of 5/31, they still didn't have their alcohol license. You can purchase tea or soda at this time. \n\nDefinitely get the garlic green beans. They were super garlic-y and cooked well. It was the first dish to arrive and we polished it off completely before our other items arrived. The shrimp toast was essentially shrimp on top of a chinese doughnut served with a spicy mayo sauce. It was good, but I don't think I will order it again. The pork gyoza was the biggest disappointment of the night. There was nothing special about it and the sauce it came with was extremely salty. You will regret ordering it. I don't really like char-siu baos, but lef bf wanted it. He said it was really, really good. He is a bbq pork bun connoisseur. The shrimp har gow would make my ancestors roll in their graves as it had cream cheese in it. It tasted good, and I really like how there were large chunks of shrimp in it. I also really liked the shrimp and cilantro ones. The sauce it came with was quite good, but at the end of the day, I still like it served with the dim sum red vinegar (which you can request). The pork XLB were better than I expected. For the price, and the amount of soup and flavor you get, we will definitely be back for these. Le bf liked these better than Din Tai Fung. He said that he could go to Dumpling Time versus having to drive all the way down to the South Bay for Din Tai Fung. \n\nPro tip: Ask to keep the lid for the XLB steamer box. That way, you can keep your XLB nice and warm and you aren't in this huge rush to eat them before they get cold. Cold XLB = a no no. \n\nFrom the point we ordered to the point we asked for the check, we ate a full meal in under 35 minutes. WOW! And this isn't even considered fast food. For how full we were (we did take some shrimp toast home as well as one of the char-siu bao), the price was really good. Service was really good and the food came out fast! We will definitely be back. I really do recommend this place. Just make sure to come early to ensure that you get to try everything you want.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

The whole atmosphere I would describe as factory-like.\n\nHost nor the servers walking by never acknowledged that there was anyone waiting.

Very soft, hint of sweetness, and the pork had just enough chewiness.\n- Three-sum - Combination of the 3 dessert baos. Sweet but not overwhelming. Fresh and soft. We really enjoyed trying these.\n- Shrimp & pork siu mai - I don't even like siu mai but I enjoyed these!\n- Pork XLB - There were well made with a lot of soup inside them. I found the tin foils made it hard to eat the dumpling. While removing the foil the dumpling kept popping open and soup spilled everywhere..\n- King dum - The straw is a little unnecessary imo. There was juice but not so much you need a boba straw for. Was difficult to eat.\n- Pork dumpling - The order came in a bowl with some colorful veggies. The dumplings could use more flavor.\n\nThis may seem like a lot but the portions were quite small. My friends and I felt we could have gone elsewhere for a more filling dinner.

The restaurant was hip and new, and I overall enjoyed the setting and service. If you're looking for legit authentic dumplings though, I'd recommend going to another dumpling place (dumpling kitchen in taraval is amaaaaazing!).\n\nThe baos were just aiight. We got them panfried but they still seemed pretty doughy/fluffy (I was expecting something like shen jian bao but they weren't quite like that). The BBQ pork was pretty good (but I have to say, I just had the baked BBQ pork buns at Dragon Beaux and nothing compares to those!). Chicken/mushroom were fine too.\n\nI found the xi'an dumplings kinda strange. They were presented with this super fancy/new American-esque fresh salad and cherry tomatoes but the dumplings themselves were still warm and tasted pretty similar to the gyoza meat we had so I wasn't really sure why it was presented in a salad. Not bad at all, just a little odd, lol.\n\nDessert buns (we got the trio) weren't that great, I'd pass. Usually lava buns are oozing with super soft almost liquid egg yolk but these weren't oozy at all! Flavor was okay but not as rich and luscious as the ones I'm used to (omg they are so amazing at dragon beaux - sorry I keep comparing the food to dragon beaux but it's hard because I was just there :p). I wasn't a fan of the green tea or beet dessert baos either.

It's fun that they have dumplings from the different regions of Asian but I think because of that their dumplings are not as good as they could be. They are just trying to do too much and haven't perfected things. They are tasty but really not special. \nThe Tom yum xiao long bao lacked the Tom yum flavor. You could barely taste it, i wanted more. The strings beans were good and and the noodles were probably my favorite. The dumplings had lots of garnishes which you can see in the picture. I thought that was really unnecessary and it did nothing visibly nor did it add to the dish. The big xiao bao was cool. We ordered it just to say we got it but it definitely is not as good as the little ones. Fun idea but fun is all that it really is.  \nI think it's worth a one time visit. THe portions are small so you have to order a lot but for the most part the food is good. I wasn't that full leaving and it is a bit pricey for dumplings so that was a bit of a bummer. I enjoyed the overall experience but probably wouldn't go back again! It's just a one time kind of place for me.", "author": "Andrea W."}

We decided to show up just before opening at 11am and it paid off.  There were about 6 groups before us so we knew we'd get a table.  They didn't start seating us until past 11, no big deal unless you've been waiting all morning for some dumps and you're starving.  It's been awhile since we've been in the area. The last time we were at this location it was Source.  I'm sure it was something else after them.  Hopefully they'll be here longer than the last two.  If you're not from the area and have to drive, we parked on Alameda about a block away (4hour free parking) since Division is mostly metered and hard to find space.\n\nFor starters, based on yelp reviews we got the shrimp toast followed by shrimp har gow, seafood gyoza and xlb tom yum goong.  They didn't arrive in that order but I guess that doesn't matter.  \n\nSeafood gyoza came first and I couldn't get enough.  I loved the spinach skin and the healthy portion of seafood stuffing but most of all the spiced chili butter sauce was so good we didn't even touch the other sauce it came with.  \nShrimp toast came next and it's more a Chinese donut dough topped with shrimp paste.  It was crispy with plenty of shrimp flavor from the shrimp paste.  It was dotted with what tasted like sriracha mayo that I wish there was more of, yum.  \nShrimp har gow was different because it had cream cheese. It was mild but lent a creamy texture.  It comes with a green sauce you can spice up with a dab of chili from the table. It's also filled with plenty of shrimp.  \nXLB tom yum goong was filled with so much soup you have to make sure you slurp it all before you lose it.  Lots of beet flavor from the skin and the soup.  Not too fond of the vinegar it comes with. I like the more traditional vinegar pairing.  \n\nI realized that everything we ordered had shrimp and I was okay with that.  Craving lots of seafood lately.  I wanted to order more, like the happy endings trio buns but I had Mr Holmes cruffins and Tartine passion fruit lime Bavarian cake waiting for me. Perfect amount of food for two.  I can't wait to go back for more. \n\nIt gets really loud when it's full.  Something I remember from Source.  Friendly service.", "author": "Naty D."}

I finally made the trip and I'm glad I listened to everyone and ordered the regular sized xiao long bao instead. I went with my boyfriend and we shared an order of pork XLB (6 pcs), veggie dumplings (8 pcs), and pork bao (3 pcs). We were sufficiently full, but we did pre-game with some Mr. Holmes pastries a few hours earlier. The pork XLB had great flavor to it. They were nice and juicy and came with some dipping sauce. I really wanted to order the king dum XLB, but even the waitress said most people found it difficult to eat. The pork XLB was perfect for sharing with my boyfriend and there's plenty of colorful options on the menu to boost your instagram game. I ordered the veggie dumplings to offset all the pork we were going to eat and was very happy with the dish! The dumplings are green (get that color for your instagram shot!) and came with a variety of other colorful chopped veggies. I've never seen cherry tomatoes in a Chinese dish, but it worked for me. Maybe it's not what mom has been cooking at home, but it's worth giving a shot. The pork bao was okay, but they do come a little small. The flavor also wasn't much to brag about. It was standard bao that you can get at any corner dim sum shop. \n\nLogistics: We spent $25 on those 3 dishes (keep in mind though that we came in with a partially filled stomach). I've definitely been to cheaper dim sum places, but Dumpling Time isn't structured the way other dim sum restaurants are. I would probably come again for lunch with friends that I'm showing around the city, but I don't think I'd come back on my own for a casual visit. They do have some parking in front of the restaurant, but spots are limited.

We came here on a Saturday night, and the place was bustling. There was an indoor waiting area, which is basically their outdoor eating area, but it was nice because it was heated, and absolutely freezing outside. However we ended up waiting for a table for almost 40 minutes, and it was cool to walk in and see people making dumplings. The atmosphere was really hip with vibrant neon signs. \n\nWe got the:\n\n- Crispy Sesame Tofu Squares ($5): i was not too crazy about this. It tasted incredibly salty and the sauce was way to sweet for my taste. The texture on the outside is perfectly crispy, while the inside is so soft that it almost melts into your mouth, which I thought was really interesting, but I am not sure I loved. \n\n- Chicken Bao ($6) : This was probably my favorite dish we got there. It was perfectly stuffed with the right ratio of meat to bao, and the filling was really good. \n\n- Chicken Gyoza ($7.50) : The Gyoza was really interesting it was really crispy almost fried at the bottom and I enjoyed the stuffing, and overall it was average. It was a little saltier than I expected, but it seemed like a lot of other gyozas I have had before. \n\n-Vegetable Dumplings ($8) : I really enjoyed the vegetable dumpling filling. However be careful because the dish comes in a really aesthetic bowl topped with several different toppings, and my friend thought one of those toppings were tomatoes, and there were halves of cherry tomatoes, but she accidentally picked up straight up red chili and burnt her tongue. When the chili seeds touch the edge of the dumpling and you accidentally eat it I am not sure how I feel about this. I really liked the filling for the dumpling as it was very flavorful, but I was not a fan of the exterior. It was rather watery and kept breaking quickly. \n\n-Three Sum ($6) : This was really good! I really especially enjoyed the Egg Yolk Bun, then the Green Tea & Milk Bun, and finally the Beet & Taro Bun. The Egg Yolk Bun was so good, and I kind of wish we had just got three of those. The Beet & Taro was not too flavorful, but was still good. \n\nOverall I think the service is amazing, but it kind of felt like they wanted us to leave because right when we finished a dish, someone would take it away, which maybe I am just not used to, but my friend mentioned feeling this way as well. I am not too sure if I would come here again because although it was incredibly good it seemed so overpriced and I feel like I have definetly had better food at other places.", "author": "Manisha P."}

Been looking for a place that has XLB as good as what we've had in NYC and have yet to find a winner.  We ordered their king XLB, some appetizers, noodles, and other dumplings to try.  The king XLB is really gimmicky and didn't impress me at all.  The other dumplings were average at best.  The seaweed was tasty, but very small portion.  The noodles were also average at best.

The skin was a little thicker than at DTF but wasn't too thick \n- Tom yum XLB: pretty red color. The flavors on this were more subtle than I expected, but the pork belly filling was tender \n- Egg yolk bun: smooth filling, light bun texture, not overly sweet \n\nFood came out pretty quickly.  Even though it's not traditional, it's nice that the XLBs are in mini tins so that you don't lose the soup picking it up from the basket - pretty brilliant! \n\nI would definitely get the pork dumplings and pork XLB again.

The flowers and sprouts on top were a nice touch but in all honesty, I'm biased because I'm a sucker for these things!\n\nThe bad and ugly  (I got a bit lazy, sorry): the siu mai and the big Xiao long bao.

It was nothing special and very ok according to my parents, but to be fair, they're priced more or less the same as other places so it's not like you're really taking a hit. The big Xiao long bao is more there for the WOW factor and Instagram/snapchat photos. The broth was good but it was so hard to eat, and in order to have such a big bao, the skin needs to be proportionally thicker. Because of the size, the skin was a bit dry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-09-21", "description": "FOOD: Old school dumplings with a touch of Cali fusion--aka Chinese yumminess you AND your veg friends can enjoy at half the grease v. traditional places. \n\nI'm a sucker for microgreens and blossoms, which top nearly every dish! \n\n- Pork Gyoza: I was reluctant to order this as I have many all too greasy memories in mind from this staple offering at dumplingeries all over town. I was pleasantly surprised by its lack of grease (still more greasy than homemade though) with no sacrifice in flavor. I appreciated that the \"pan fried\" element was a quick sear to the bottom rather than a deeply brown and crunchy affair, allowing you to really taste the dumpling for what it is (rather than just the base deliciousness of thoroughly fried food).\n- Pork Char-Siu Bao: Peanut butter... I had my doubts. But it was excellent! The bun was nice and fluffy, the pork was flavorful and not too fatty. I am still not a huge fan of peanut intruding in my BBQ goodness, but I appreciate the effort to innovate \n- Shrimp & Cilantro Har Gow: Would just go regular shrimp next time. This is another oldie but goodie for a reason. As a cilantro lover (not a soap taster), I found the cilantro too overpowering for the shrimp. It has a strong foreflavor, blocking out all the fragrant foreflavor of the shrimp and leaving that oceanic aftertaste I tolerate when eating shrimp.\n- Xi 'An Vegetarian Dumpling: Tested this for vegetarian friends, and it is go! Flavorful and fun. The flavors aren't as umami-y as in the meat options, but a couple orders of these for a never had pork before veg friends will do wonders. \n- Pork XLB: I know the mini pie tins these arrive in are controversial, but I was absolutely enchanted by them. The flavor of the broth was spot on--my favorite in the city--and my only issue was with the wrapper itself, which unfortunately stuck to the bottom of the tin and tore prematurely every time I enjoyed one. Perhaps a thin slice of carrot (as done at other restaurants) or spray of oil at the bottom would allow the XLB to break free without breaking.\n- Happy Endings Trio: Save room! These were the highlight of the meal. Loved the sweet but not too sweet end and the medley of Asian dessert flavors. Favorite was the egg yolk bun--the custard was so yummy.\n\nSERVICE: Accommodating hosts (we switched from inside to outside) and upbeat service (have to be in such a busy space!). Server arrived promptly to take our order and food arrived not too long after. Definitely seemed a bit understaffed on (harried) waitstaff, so don't expect to be fawned over, but do expect service when you need it.\n\nAMBIANCE: Fast paced, bright (with neon signs inside and out), and clean. Window where you can see staff rapidly making dumplings by hand, though that did make me a little sad too (hope they are paid enough!).

The shrimp toast was a strip of fried Chinese donut with shrimp paste down the middle lengthwise--think shrimp paste in crab claws or eggplant from dim sum--topped with a light drizzle of mayo. We also got the Beijing noodles which were delicious with the right amount of pork and sauce but slightly more oily than is my preference (though I'm not sure if this amount of oil is traditional). And last but not least, the green beans were way better than described in the reviews I read before coming here! They were beautifully presented in a textured stone-like oval bowl with little edible flowers, the portion was generous, and they were deliciously fried and garlicky. The four dishes came out to be $41 without tip which was reasonable for the area. To wrap it up, I would come back with friends to show them this trendy place for XLB and (pretty good) extras. If looking for a XLB place to take my Chinese parents this would not be my first choice due to the price point and younger / more hip clientele. So congrats Dumpling Time on making good Chinese food more accessible to the Mission Bay area. May the King Dum forever be a staple of foodies' Instagrams!", "author": "Jackie T."}

(I'll explain later)\n\nSo straight to the dumplings, since that's in the restaurant's name, they're honestly pretty average. Nothing special, nothing particularly bad, nothing really stands out. But I looove dumplings, so I still found these so-so dumplings yummy, although a bit expensive.\n\nI had the Pork Gyoza, the Pork Dumplings, and the Pork XLBs. The XLBs are in those shiny paper/foil cups, which I think makes it harder to eat. I'd much rather have them on a sheet in the basket.\n\nI did have the KING-DUM, the giant soup dumpling. It's a great for photos but super awkward to eat. You basically have to poke it with a straw and drink all the soup first before you can eat the rest. It would difficult to pull the whole thing out of its container and bite it - you'd lose all the soup. It's also impossible to cut and split among people, again you'd lose all the soup. So at the end you're left eating the skin and meat with no soup. MEH, not really worth it.\n\nFor dessert I had the Happy Endings (buns). I got all 3 flavors (Trio of Buns) and they were sooo good! The Beet & Taro was my favorite, but they were all great. Super fresh, super warm, super moist, SUPER TASTY! I would come to this place and eat nothing but Happy Endings... who needs mediocre dumplings?", "author": "Posu Y."}

If you are looking to take pretty photos of your dumplings, sure, swing by. But if you want hot, fresh, juicy dumplings, this is not the place. First--they serve XLB in cupcake tin foil (WTF?!?) it's appropriation of Asian culture, tbh. For 5 dishes, 2 drinks, it ended up being $90 with tax. I understand why it's popular, it's very picaresque in the age where photos are king. But it cannot be passed off as authentic \"homemade\" dumplings. The dumplings themselves weren't even cooked properly, overcooked imo. The meat was falling out--which is a no no. I thought the best dish were the string beans, which is saying something at a restaurant that primarily serves dumplings. \n\nThey are trying to be din tai fung with the open viewing area where you can watch them make dumplings, but no, stop.

But they have a lot of little issues that they need to fix. I do consider this to be top 3 dim sum in San Francisco, but dim sum in SF is sub par or over the top expensive ( why are you soup dumplings so expensive yank sing?)\n\nIn regards to their soup dumplings (xiao long bao) they are delicious. They have excellent broth with a great meat ratio but, they still have problems with tearing wrappers. They insist on those little foil cups for the dumplings and make the dumpling too large. The dumpling inevitably droops over the side of the foil cup and becomes stuck causing a tear when you try to disconnect the dumpling from foil. The XLB are just too large here. Too large for the foil cups and too large for the spoons provided. Din Tai Fung remains the master of XLB and I wish the owners of Dumpling Time would study them a little bit more. These XLB taste delicious and are the best in the city behind yank sing's over priced option.\n\nThe shrimp shumai with cilantro are some of the best tasting  shumai I have ever had. The quality of the shrimp seems high with a coarse chop and the cilantro adding great freshness. Again the wrappers are just not there. They tear very easily. \n\nSo the service..... The service needs a lot of work. The people are friendly and totally unorganized and seeming confused. They appear to have enough staff but nobody in charge orchestrating the mass confusion. There does not appear to be any real system in place and nobody has the others back. Seems like a bunch of individual servers running around in a large space lost not working as a harmonious group. If these kids could get their stuff together they would change turn over time dramatically. On both of my visits we easily could have eaten in about 50% the time. This restaurant could turn and burn much more effectively but every server seems in the weeds. \n\nI really like this place and will continue to come back. Its good but it could be great. If it wanted to this place could get a Michelin star but they are very far from that currently. The flavors are excellent and some of the best in the bay.", "author": "Peter M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-07", "description": "What time is it? That's right! Its Dumpling Time! Let me start by saying I'm a bit of a dumpling snob. I can be quite particular when it comes to these delicate little savory balls of dough. That said, I was incredibly pleased with this batch of NumNum! \n\nFirst up were the go-to\u00a0Xiao Long Bao... For all you non-dumpling eating peasants, these are more commonly called Soup Dumplings. Why? Because they are dumplings that literally have soup inside of them. Duh. These were delicious! Perfect ratio of soup to skin (STS as I like to call it), perfect balance of flavor, and they came with a \"soy-based with a bit of spicy\" sauce that I poured over top (after piercing each with the chopstick to ensure perfect penetration of flavor). I have to say, they could have been hotter, but considering I ordered delivery I'm not mad. At all.\u00a0\nNext up were the Seafood Gyoza with Spiced Chili Butter. These little gems of the sea must be what Ariel would get on special occasions, because they were fu**ing DELICIOUS. The green spinach wrappers did the job of making me feel like I was still being healthy... The inside was a harmonious and delectable mix of crab, shrimp, scallop, and cilantro. Once again the STS was perfect (in this case, stuffing, not soup). They came with two sauces, one of which was a basic gyoza sauce but the other was this amazing slightly spicy creamy butter sauce. These things were so good that even non seafood eaters would love them! Ok, I'm not sure about that because I wouldn't share with anyone who asked to try them... But I would bet so!\n\nLast sample of the evening were the Maine Lobster Siu Mai. Holy S**t. Have you ever traveled to Portland? (Maine, not Oregon). Well, if you have, you know that near the wharf there are several little amazing lobster shacks, and as soon as you step anywhere near them, you can practically taste the deliciousness of the fresh crustacean in the air. Now, imagine being able to bottle up that intensity and compact it into a bite sized gem of steamed dough with chives, butter, and white truffle oil. That's exactly what these bad boys tasted like. Amazing. They did not require any sauce, but myself being a Saucy Sam, tried at least one with each of the previously mentioned sauces, and I would be lying if I said it did not make them even better. \n\nAll in all, I ate 15 dumplings. 6 soup dumplings, 4 lobster sui may, and 5 gyoza. I could have EASILY eaten double that. Partly because I'm fat and eat too much, partly because when something is so delicious I just want to keep eating it far after I am full, but also because these bad boys are a little bit on the small side as far as dumplings go... My suggestion? Order quite a bit more than you would normally think you want, you will NOT be disappointed. And I forgot to mention... They also gave me this side of pickled Lotus and Carrot. Never had Lotus before, it was delicious.   \n\nI cannot wait to go to this place and literally order everything off the menu. Oh damn! I think it may be Dumpling Time again....", "author": "Dennis P."}

I ordered the Tom Yum XLB, the King-dum (The huge XLB), Seafood Gyoza and some Char-Siu Bao (Seared, high key recommend getting them seared).\n\nFood, it tasted great! My favorite was the Char Siu Bao honestly because it was so savory yet highly sweetened by that peanut butter sauce inside that delicious piece. The seared option was totally worth for that textured dimension. Second, the seafood gyoza caught me by surprise about how good it was, especially with the side sauce. IT WAS THICK, AND SO CREAMY. The King-dum tasted like a regular XLB, but it was obviously bigger. The soup was so savory and rich! The Tom Yum XLB, honestly are you know... ordered for aesthetics. I feel like my only problem with this meal is if you advertise a XLB to be Tom Yum, I'd kind of would except Hot Pot dripping into my mouth. The red vinegar sauce however that accompanied it was a good contrast between flavor combos!\n\nService: It was fast, easy, simple. I don't mind waiting, I really don't. To be fair, and to be considered, most of the time it's not the server's fault if food comes out late. Usually it's a factor of things and servers are the face of the issues set upon.

The food was good, not mind blowing but tasty. As many others have stated, if you are a true dumpling connoisseur, then this is not the most authentic option. However, the presentation of each dish is absolutely stunning, everything comes out piping hot and the service was great, hence the 3.5 stars.\n\nWe got the following dishes:\n- Garlicky green beans: Simple, straightforward veggie dish. A bit on the salty side for my taste.\n- Beijing Noodles: Probably my favorite dish we got and would recommend it. The meat had lots of flavor and the noodles looked like they were very fresh, possibly hand made. Added some chili sauce and thought it was great. TIP: make sure to mix all of the noodles with the meat well, otherwise they'll seem bland.\n- Char-Sui Bao (steamed): Also good. The pork filling was not overly fatty and these had good flavor. \n- Pork Xi'an Dumpling: Not my favorite. Everything was topped with edible flowers, radishes and sliced tomatoes, which did nothing to enhance the dish. I found the texture to be a bit mushy as well. I've definitely had better pork dumpling and didn't think these were anything special.\n- Pork XLB: Not the best I've ever had (if you're looking for top quality XLB in the Bay Area, still have to go to Din Tai Fung), but they were good. The soup in the dumplings had good flavor, but I found them hard to eat since it was quite a challenge to pull off of the foil cups without popping them and accidentally draining the soup. \n- Tom Yum Goong XLB: To be honest, this was the dish I was most disappointed in. Don't get me wrong, they were still tasty, but I didn't thing the coconut milk flavor came through at all. Glad we tried them, but thought these were just a slightly less tasty version of the Pork XLB.\n- Trio of Sweet Buns: My favorite was the Green Tea & Milk Bun, hands down, and would get these again for sure, but my friends also enjoyed the Egg Yolk Bun. Was glad we got the trio to try them all, but I was underwhelmed by the beet and taro.\n\nI'd come back again if I was in the area.

Granted, we came on Sunday afternoon, literally 15 (!!!) minutes after the restaurant opened so it was expected to be faced with a line. The restaurant isn't as big as a regular dimsum restaurant, at least not as big as the ones in the 626 or SF Chinatown. There are communal benches/tables inside the restaurant, which we snagged a table at. Pricing definitely more expensive than regular dimsum restaurants, without the push carts. The nice waitress told us that everything's made to order so you basically should order everything you want at once. \nWe ordered the tom yum soup dumplings, the regular ones, the pan fried pork buns, and the shrimp toast. I loved the shrimp toast. It's so innovative, especially since I love you tiaos (they're so bad for you but its so gooooddd). They somehow spread the shrimp paste on top and fry it together. The tom yum soup dumplings has a coconut soup base and was like drinking the bottled coconut water. Nice to stop every once in a while when I dont want to drive to Chinatown.", "author": "Michelle R."}

It seemed they didn't quite have their operation down yet.  We waited for about 15 minutes which wasn't bad and the guy who ended up seating us was quite apologetic (though it really wasn't even his fault).\n\nBetween my boyfriend and I, we ordered the har gow, pork XLB, xi'an pork dumplings, gan ban noodles, and the happy endings buns (trio).  The har gow and xi'an pork dumplings were  good.  However, I was disappointed by the XLB.  I was hoping this place would have good XLB since it's a dumpling place, but the XLB weren't as soupy as I thought and the skin was kind of thick.  The gan ban noodles also were meh.  To be fair, we really wanted the beijing noodles, but they sold out when we were there.  \n\nThe (desert) trio buns were pretty good.\n\nOverall, I'd still go back to this place because it's the closest asian place to my house (probably).  I'd like to go back and try the beijing noodles, but I'd stay away from the XLB.", "author": "Carrie L."}

The pork and chicken gyoza (pan-fried dumplings) were good. The chicken bao (steamed bun) was good... But the xiao long baos (soup dumplings) left something to be desired -- we tried the pork xlb and the tom yum goong. With the name of the place being Dumpling Time, I was expecting the soup dumplings to be the star of the show, but they were not. They were on the bland side and did not have a satisfying balance of skin, soup and filling. I've definitely had better xlb, especially since I'm from the San Gabriel Valley where there is a lot of good Chinese food.\n\nEnvironment:\nDefinitely not the classic Chinese restaurant vibe -- but that's not a bad thing, it's just different. I could tell that this is more modernized or Americanized, or that it is Asian fusion. Again, not a bad thing. The interior is comfortable and clean and there is the choice of outdoor seating as well. There is the luxury of free street parking nearby. Service was fast and friendly.", "author": "Kevin S."}

The wait wasn't too long (~15 min) for Sunday noon time, and parking was not bad either.  The server was very nice and recommended pretty good items.  We had the shrimp toast (crispy fried chinese donut topped with a savory shrimp paste), Beijing noodles (minced pork in a savory black bean paste sauce with cold noodles), pork gyoza (pan fried), char siu bao (pan fried bbq pork buns), and pork xiao long bao (small steammed dumplings containing pork ginger and some soup/broth).  Overall the food was great.  Portions on the lighter side compared to the price, but guessing it is quality over quantity, and paying for the trendy environment.  Besides the price and somewhat smaller space (especially if you have a kid, as I do), the only other drawback preventing me from giving this place a 5 is they sold out of the giant Xiao Long Bao (literally a super size version of the pork xiao long bao, where you need a straw to drink the soup out of the dumpling).  They said that only about 25 are made for lunch and dinner service, each, so get there early for either service to get your chance at it.", "author": "Raymond F."}

We found metered parking across the street and were seated immediately. \n\nItems ordered: \n\n1. Shrimp Toast / $8 for 6 pieces: Shrimp paste topped on a youtiao (Chinese donut) w/ spicy alioli and cilantro garnish. The shrimp and alioli paired well but our youtiao was clearly a leftover because they had to refry it. The inner portion that should be doughy was overfried, drenched in oil, and way too crunchy. \n\n2. Beijing Noodles/ $9: Good chewy noodles topped with seasoned ground pork. \n\n3. Tom Yum Goong/ $7 for 6 pieces: The beet skin turned an unsavory color after being steamed but what was really disappointing was the lack of Tom Yum flavor. The coconut flavor was really subtle and I'm not sure you can really call it Tom Yum if it lacks the tanginess of the lime or kick of lemongrass, chilis, etc. The pork filling was also a bit mushy. \n\n4. Xi'an Pork Dumplings / $8 for 8 pieces: This dish was probably the most disappointing of all. The dish was topped with sliced radishes, halved cherry tomatoes and sprouts that did nothing to enhance the flavor. The skin was too doughy and even stuck to my teeth as I chewed it. The filling was also mushy and nearly tasteless. \n\n5. Egg Yolk Bun / $5.50 for 3 buns: This was probably the best of the bunch. The bun consistency was fluffy and the filling was tasty. \n\nIt was great to try some place new but hopefully they improve their recipes because the ideas are creative but execution was poor.", "author": "Connie C."}

The restaurant is airy and the seating is comfortable and not too crowded. Of the dishes I tried yesterday, I really loved the Xi'an vegetarian dumpling. The flavor of the vegetables and the dumpling skin was the perfect amount of chewy yet tender. The XLB may just be the best I've had in the city so far - tons of broth inside, the top knot was soft, the skin was very thin. The shrimp toast was another favorite - perfectly crispy on the outside, just enough chewy on the inside without being overly oily and really fresh shrimp paste. The pan seared pork and veggie bao (\u751f\u714e\u5305) was also really tasty. The bottom was just seared just enough without being tough or burnt tasting and the filling was flavorful and moist, just like it should be! The green tea bun with creamy milk filling was the perfect amount of sweet to end the meal. \n\nAs a novice home cook, I loved watching the dumplings and baos being made in the glass enclosed room. The amount of skill used to perfect the many different types of dumpling skins and bao doughs is awe-inspiring and I can just watch the chefs work all day. \n\nDumpling Time is a perfect place to bring your date, your family, your birthday gathering and your kids will love watching the dumplings being made. What a great addition to the neighborhood and the city as a whole! I really look forward to their official opening because I can't wait to try more of their dumplings and revisit my favorites.", "author": "Veronica C."}

Luckily, as a result, we noticed it opened a few days early and popped over for dinner on Thursday before the lines started to wrap around the block.\n\nEverything was absolutely fantastic! Full disclosure: I'm pregnant, so we ordered about 80% of the menu since my only remaining vice is food. We loved everything we got - my favorites were the pork gyoza, pork dumplings, and pork bao (sensing a theme?); my husband LOVED the seafood gyoza and shrimp dumplings (another theme).\n\nWe did notice by Friday & Saturday people were lining up early and wait times seemed long - I'm surprised they had ANYTHING left for dinner on Saturday after the insane lunch crowd.\n\nWe're big fans of the Omakase Restaurant Group (Kash and Edgar always impress!), and I'm confident any kinks will be worked out in a matter of days.\n\nIn the meantime, I'm just hoping for the lines to die down so I can go eat there more often!", "author": "Carrie W."}

But unfortunately, I ordered other dishes and was disappointed with them. \n\nCame here on a Tuesday night around 6pm, there wasn't really a wait, probably 5 minutes, but after we left, there were definitely more people, perhaps 6 parties waiting. Parking was average, perhaps I got lucky with street parking. Interior is pretty small but dishes are washed pretty clean. \n\nXLBs: Probably one of the better XLBs I've had in NorCal. Up there with DTF and perhaps even jucier. It came in a steamer with 6. I'm not really a fan of the foil cups that they use when steaming them, but it wasn't too much of a pain to take them out. Occasionally they would get stuck and the XLB would break apart. \n\nPork Gyoza: Basically pot stickers. The filling was delicious, with meat and some veges, but my major problem was with the dough itself. It was very sticky and strange. IMO, the dough shouldn't be stick and should be more on the crispy side. Perhaps it's something they put in the dough. But flavor was good, not too salty. \n\nSteamed Dumplings: Very unimpressed. They added some sort of salad decoration on top. The dumplings were tiny and contained little to no meat. The bulk of the dumpling was the dough, which was also a similar consistency as the gyoza, sticky. Would not recommend. \n\nBeijing Noodles: Basically minced pork noodles. Zha Jiang Mian. So nothing really special there. They use flat noodles instead of round ones. Overall flavor was decent. Not too salty, which can often be the problem. \n\nWould come back if I were in the area. \nProbably would not recommend waiting if it's over 35 minutes. \nGet the XLBs for sure. Gyozas if you must.", "author": "Scott K."}

It took us an hour and a half to get seated. Meanwhile, 12 parties who arrived after us got seated. That's a minimum of 24 people. Basic math: 24 is a lot more than 6. At the very least they could have warned us and broken us up, but they didn't tell us they might need to break us up until after an hour wait, although they did ultimately seat us together. Absolutely garbage table/waitlist management.\n\nIn fairness to them, they gave us free small bites as a consolation. They were ok. I appreciate they recognize they done effed up.\n\nBy the time they sat us, I was legit ANGRY, but we'd already sank the time and it was late enough that most restaurants would have closed down already. We ordered x'ian dumpling, regular pork xiaolongbao (they'd sold out of the giant ones), and pork buns.\n\nWith that wait, I would have been placated if the food was great. And after all it was... ok. I liked X'ian Dumplings the best, something different. The XLB and bao... I've had better, I've had worse. Very middle of the road. I was crazy hungry at this point, and even with hunger bonus points, I wasn't particularly impressed. 3/5, maybe 3.5/5 if I wasn't so pissed.\n\nI was really excited about this place because the food scene (and especially the Asian food scene) in Soma is terrible and the prices are great for SF.

Come early and get guaranteed dishes and no wait. But before you start changing up your schedule to eat at Dumpling Time I have to say this place is a lot of hype. I'm not sure that I would go again but i'm glad I experienced it once to get my cravings out of the way.\n\nFor two people the boyfriend and I definitely over ordered (I have this problem of wanting to try everything on the menu). We ordered the snap peas, shrimp toast, pork gyoza, char-siu bao, pork xi'an dumpling, king-dum (giant xlb), and tom yum goong xlb.\n\nHighlights\nKing-Dum (Giant XLB) - Highlight of my meal thought it had amazing flavor. \nTom Yum Goong XLB - Tasty I was afraid of this one because Tom Yum soup in the form of a dumpling did not sound appealing to me. Luckily this wasn't that strong in Tom Yum flavor it was a subtle hint of Tom Yum.\n\nOkay/Good\nPork Gyoza - While the gyoza didn't taste any different than your average gyoza the sauce they provided was worth mentioning. It came with a butter aioli of some sort and while really heavy it added a unique taste to the gyoza.\nSnap Peas - With all the dumplings I recommend adding in a veggie dish and this one was good.\n\nPass\nPork Xi'An Dumpling - Pass on this, it's a steamed dumpling. Taste no different than other steam dumplings tbh it lacked flavor and I wouldn't be able to differentiate it from the frozen stuff.\nChar-Siu Bao - I didn't find this extraordinary.

The waiter gave the table to 2 people who came after me again and again. Finally after 4 tables after me, I was served. But I was arranged in the middle of a group of table. The server never noticed me. I had to wait longer until the server finally came to my spot. And I came here for the king dum. But they said it was sold out just before my order. I mean if I could sit earlier, I would be able to have it. This is such a bad experience. Usually one person should get seated pretty easily. But this place made me keep waiting and waiting because they wanted to squeeze me in a 8 people long table so that one person could sit with another one person... my advice is that if you come alone, just write 2 people on the list so that you can get a table faster and you can be severed better", "author": "Danyang Danielle C."}

We were the 3rd group to be seated. Friendly service and efficient. Speed of food was ok, although I see everyone else received their food before we did and they ordered after us. Had the shrimp toast, it was a fried Chinese doughnut with some shrimp on it. It was ok, nothing that would leave a lasting impression. The seafood gyoza was also ok, although it was just cooked and brought to us, the filling wasn't hot enough. The butter sauce with chili was not very spicy, it didn't do too much to elevate the seafood gyoza. We also had the pork xlb, they were nice and juicy. My favorite would be the xian dumplings, it was presented beautifully and the pork had the right seasoning to it. Another dish that we tried was the har how or shrimp dumping, the skin was nice and thin not thick, just the right consistency but I did not taste any cream cheese in it. It was fresh and hot and it really reminded me of eating dim sum.  As for the king- dum, I should've listen to my fellow yelpers and avoided that. The soup mostly drained to the plate under the steamer and I did not even used the straw that came with the dumpling. Novel idea but I'm still dreaming of the soup bao from Anthony Bourdain's travel segment. Mostly metered parking around the area.", "author": "Alicia A."}

We had the har gow, xi'an dumplings, char siu bow and of course, the XLBs. The har gow was very well made, but not a highlight and the xi'an dumplings were very delicious.  But we all know why you're reading this and getting ready to go to this restaurant. I've been the Din Tai Fung all over the world - from Sydney to Arcadia so I can understand where your head is at. I would rate the XLBs a solid 4/5. The skin is almost as thin as DTF and the flavor is definitely at the same level. If the skin were perhaps a bit smoother and more delicate, it would be close to the same level. Overall, the experience was great and the service was good for a Wednesday.

Got there on a Sunday at around 6:30 and despite there being like 20 parties ahead of us our party of 4 was seated in less than 30 minutes. They have a lot of communal tables to get butts in seats so be ready to meet strangers!\n\nThe dumplings come out fast - we ordered pretty much 1 of every dumpling on the menu. The KingDum is fun- we split it 4 ways after taking turns drinking the soup out of a straw.\n\nFavorites include the seafood gyoza with butter dipping sauce- highly recommended for seafood lovers! Packed with big chunks of lobster and shrimp, with a butter sauce I could drink.\n\nThe coconut milk/beet wrapped soup dumplings were also a star- really flavorful and different than your typical XLB. \n\n-1 star for being out of several beers. The menu isn't long so if they're out of some stuff there's not a ton of other options. They do tend to also run out of food around 9pm- staff said- but hopefully they'll beef up supply!\n\nI left uncomfortably full but couldn't turn down another bite of dumplings. The tri-color dessert buns were bomb! Taro and egg custard being our fave. \n\nThey have an outdoor patio which is just a waiting area right now but hopefully that'll become a dining area soon too!

There was 2 groups of 2 infront and I wrote my name down on the waiting list. The hostess 2as already seating the first party and checked the list after. So the second party didn't wrote their name down but I let them get seated first. There was more tables open and it wouldn't of made a difference. We got seated at the patio but there was no settings ready so the hostess went to grab them and then she forgot the menus. We sat for about 5 mins before the server came with water then I asked for the menu and he quickly went to get it and apologized. (He was very aplogoectic even though it was not his fault) another 5mins passed and we were ready to order but the waitress asked if we could move to another table and so she can seat a party of 5. I didn't mind so we agreed. The first what! The party didn't want to sit in the patio! Then she and her group decided the patio was ok. So we moved and they sat... Haha and next! They moved the 2 tables that were set up for them to connect with another! OMG! (Super irritated at these 5). Then after they sat for about 5 minutes and drank their water, they requested to move inside instead! Holy cow! This has nothing to do with the restaurant but I just wanted to say that the hostess handled herself very well handling this group!\n\nWe ordered everything we wanted and they had everything plus added new items since they opened (or the last I was here.)\n\nSeared chicken bao, pork xlb, 2 king dum, xi An Pork duMplings and clinatro har gow.\n\nFirst was the XiAn Pork Dumpling: Plating is nicely done but the garnishes didn't help add flavor to the Dumpling. I tried it without sauces first and it did lack flavor. \n\nSecond pork xlb : none of them broke! (Thank you !!!) The thickness of the skin was inconsistent. I had one that was super thick then 2 that were not. I wish there was more Juice in them (doesn't everyone ). The meat flavor was ok. One of them was super ginger-y.\n\nThird clinatro Har Gow: I expected the skin to be thinner but I have seen thicker. The taste is ok but it does come with a clinatro sauce which I good BUT if your food is flavored right... Why would I need to use the clinatro sauce? Just my thoughts !\n\nForth was the seared chicken bao: I like the bao. A lot and I don't eat bao. The meat is not juicy and I think there a way too much mushroom inside . Also for a seared bao, they outside of the bun is overly moist. Which makes it stick to your fingers.\n\nFifth : king Dum (king xlb) literally ordered it for the gram. Takes the longest... We ate everything and it still wasn't here....And tun tun tun... After 40mins it's sold out! Wtf! Waiter said it was system miscount. Haha sold out right before we ordered ... I don't think so buddy!\n\nReview stays the same 3 stars.\n\n\n**********************************************************\ncame here when they first open about 8pm and they were basically sold out of most items already.

For example, the boiled dumplings were hand crafted down to the wrappers, and they were topped with edible flowers and fennel shavings. The garnishes were unexpected but made the dish beautiful and tasty. We also loved the Beijing pork noodles - this was probably our favorite dish of the night. We also had the seafood gyozas, pork xiao long baos, and crispy fried tofu. Everything was tasty and made to order.

Pretty good.\n- Beijing noodles (3.5/5) - The flavor was actually pretty good (and legitimately reminds me of the real thing), but there was probably half as much sauce as I would've liked.  With enough sauce and maybe some vinegar at the table, this would've been 4+ stars.\n- Shrimp & cilantro har gow (3/5) - The flavor and texture was fine, but the dumpling skin was too thick.  Comes with a cilantro sauce that was interesting, although I personally wasn't a huge fan.\n- Xi'an pork dumplings (3.5/5) - Pretty good, with a nice crunch from the cabbage.  One or two of the dumplings on our plate must have come from an entire batch that was way over-boiled, though, as they were mushy.\n- Tom Yum Goong XLB (4/5) - Probably the best thing we had.  I'd never had Tom Yum in a XLB before, but it really worked - the soup and filling were both delicious.  The individual tin foil mini-pans that each XLB came in made it slightly more difficult to eat.  \n\nI'm sure we'll be back a lot more, as this place will definitely satisfy some of our Chinese food craving without forcing us to trek all the way out to Richmond/Sunset or Chinatown.", "author": "Simon L."}

Slices of raw cucumber with oil and chilis for like $6.  \n\nCrispy Tofu Squares - This was our favorite dish of the night!  Really good flavor!\n\nSeared Pork Bao - The bun itself was a bit dry and the meat was decent\n\nPork XLB - Din Tai Fung prices for Panda Express quality.  Also - the XLB stuck to the bottom of the aluminum tin which caused the skin to break and the soup to flow out.\n\nShrimp / Cilantro Har Gow - The sauce was actually really good.  Totally not asian but still tasty enough.\n\nPork/Shrimp Siu Mai - Tasted like any other dim sum restaurant's siu mai only twice the price\n\nVeggie Dumplings - Definitely the least favorite at the table.  IMO - it was pretty looking but did not taste great.  All veggies were bland and the toppings didn't match the flavor of the dumpling\n\nBeijing Noodles - Pork was seasoned really well.  Overall - a good dish.\n\nShrimp Toast - We ordered it but they ran out...but they didn't even tell us until we asked them where it was\n\nGreen Tea and Milk Bun - Definitely a must try.  I really enjoyed it.  It wasn't too sweet, which I liked.\n\nEgg Yolk Bun - This is not a typical egg yolk bun like you get at a dim sum place, where the inside is runny.  This was more like an egg custard bun.\n\nService - Decent enough.  They made a mistake on our order but corrected it.  The maitre'd seemed rude though to folks (not to us but as you see her interacting with other guests)\n\nOverall - I would not come back because the prices are too high to the quality of food you get.", "author": "Christopher L."}

The dessert dumpling trio had an egg custard flavor, beet and taro, and green tea. It's a very hipster dumpling spot, with screens and decor to match, but at least it was a clean environment. The hubby enjoyed the shrimp toast and Beijing noodles as well. The green beans have us the needed veggie fix, and we downed everything with a bottle of sake.

I also really liked the chili oil on the side thatcam go with all the foods. It wasn't spicy but it had a little kick that made all the food better. Excellent food and excellent friendly service.

There was already a line so we were a little shook but we were seated pretty quickly. The whole experience involves A LOT of waiting around for your food, so make sure you set aside at least 2 hours plus a little more if you have to wait in line. While we were ordering, the waitress kept pushing us to order more (and no shade, that's her job, get it gurl, ect) but honestly, don't do it. We, unfortunately, got pressured into doing so. \n\nWe got:\n1. Shrimp toast - I liked this, my friend didn't at all. It was super crunchy and oily. Wish they added a lil more shrimp to it. \n2. Char siu bao - This was alright. It wasn't bad or good. I honestly can't even remember what it tasted like. Forgettable. \n3. Pork XLB - I wish we didn't order this. I've had much better XLB at mom and pop shops in the east bay. It was so bland and lukewarm, don't even bother. \n4. King-dum - This is the only reason we came here so I was super excited to get it. It's huge and picture-worthy. Taste-wise, it was, like everything else, alright. The meat was mushy but it was fun to eat, I guess!\n\nOverall, come here once if you must for the aesthetics. Food-wise, there are better, cheaper, more authentic spots out there. I really wanted to love this place but everything was so \"meh.\"\n\nPS: they ran out of the King-dum as we were wrapping up our meal.

After waiting for so long, my friends and I were excited to try their large XLB (the one that's so big you need a straw), but they were sold out!! We started with the shrimp toast, which is like a youtiao topped with a shrimp paste. I'm not sure if it was because we were starving, but we really enjoyed it. It was perfectly savory and the two different textures worked really well together. We also had their garlicky green beans which was very typical Chinese styled green beans, not all that special. Next came our pork bao that we requested to be pan fried. This was just a typical Chinese pork bun with lettuce and other vegetables. It wasn't all that special. We moved onto the two types of XLB- pork XLB and tom yum goong XLB. While both were filled with savory soups, we preferred the pork XLB over the tom yum goong XLB since it had less of a vinegry taste to it. The tom yum XLB wasn't spicy or sour like the soup usually is. Topped with meat and some ginger, the Beijing noodles were also pretty delicious, but it was definitely not enough to share for the 3 of us. We ended with the trio of happy ending buns- matcha and milk, egg yolk, and beet and taro bun. Of the 3 type of buns, the matcha and milk was our favorite, having a familiar custard-y, milky taste to it. \n\n- THE WAIT\nDO NOT go on a weekend unless you know that are first in line. We arrived on a Saturday around 12:30 PM and we waited until 1:58 PM to be seated (it closes at 2:00 PM). Our food took a while to get out since there was still a lot of people waiting for their food.  We were starving and cranky, making us feel that this trip to Dumpling Time wasn't worth it. \n\n- THE PRICES\nThe prices here are pretty steep, considering typical Chinese food isn't very expensive. However, this is more of an Americanized Chinese place and every plate is nearly $10 for just a few pieces. Although the food is pretty good, I felt that the wait and the prices weren't all worth it.", "author": "Cindy C."}

So yeah, they're pretty good. In addition to the xlb's we also ordered the BBQ pork buns which were also really really good because the dough was nice and light. We got them pan fried so it had a little crunch and a little lightness. The pork dumplings were pretty with the flowers and colors but were just ok in comparison to the xlb's. The surprise of the night were the pork gyozas which were absolutely amazing. Not too oily, lightly doughed, and lightly fried. The filling was flavorful and melted in the mouth instead of being chewy like a gelatinous mess...the way a lot of gyozas can be after being steamed and fried. The only disappointment was the giant King-Dum that is so beautiful and comes with a straw to sip the amazing soup. But it was difficult to sip, and the dough was tough and chewy and then messy to eat. Great novelty, but not great for eating or for $8. All in all, \"souper\" delicious. I", "author": "Tina P."}

We got there right when they opened at 11am and were seated fairly quickly. (It's a good thing we arrived early because by 11:30am the restaurant was full and there was a bunch of people waiting outside for tables.) The weather was nice so we opted to sit outside on the patio. Our server Maddie was extremely friendly. She suggested we order two to three items each and told us the dishes were best shared family-style. She then made a few recommendations from the menu and took our drink order. I got the the Holy Craft Harajuku Girl draft beer. Harajuku Girl is a rice ale brewed with yuzu, a Japanese citrus fruit. It was very refreshing. Carlos had a glass of chardonnay. For lunch we shared the shrimp toast, pan-seared chicken bao (steamed buns), Tom Yum Goong XLB (soup dumplings), seafood gyoza with chili butter sauce, and shrimp and cream cheese har gow (steamed dumplings) with cilantro dipping sauce. Everything was really delicious. Our favorites were the seafood gyoza, shrimp toast, and the shrimp and cream cheese har gow. For dessert (a.k.a. \"Happy Endings\") we shared the Trio of Buns (Egg Yolk, Green Tea & Milk, and Beet & Taro). Egg Yolk was my favorite. Overall I really enjoyed my lunch at Dumpling Time.

I hear the line is out the door since they opened, but we lucked out and missed the rush when we got there around noon on a Monday. Everything was delicious and will def come back again! \n\nThese are the items that we tried: \n-garlicky green beans: typical green bean dish from a Chinese restaurant. \n- shrimp gyoza: my fave dish! this comes with a butter chili sauce that is uniquely different than the usual gyoza sauce. But if u don't like it, it also comes with the basic sauce too. \n- shrimp toast: shrimp paste on top of a Chinese donut, fried to the perfect soft and crunchy combo. \n- Beijing noodle: the meat has plenty of flavors so be sure to mix it up well, otherwise the noodles will taste bland. Good with some chili hot sauce if u like the heat. \n- tum yum goong xlb: this dish intrigued me the most but I couldn't really taste the tum yum. Still really good but it'd be better if the broth is more robust with tum yum flavors\n- \"king-dum\": took a while to come out. a large xlb that's as big as your fist, they actually give u a boba straw for the broth, but be careful, The broth is very hot. A bit hard to eat and the broth eventually seeps to the dish below, but overall the flavors are delicious. It's a really cool concept and def worth trying, but I personally prefer the regular sized xlb more \n- Tsing trio: the sweet baos - buns with filling inside.

However, the way things are run around here is ridiculous. Walked in seeing a long line, with no greeting or welcome by a host or any of the workers. We didn't even know where to sign in. Why? Because the sign that says to sign in is taped to the door and the door was propped open so you couldn't see it. Checked in and signed in at 12:10 for a party of 4. \nThere was already a ruckus inside due to a homeless woman walking in to the store and taking food. They kicked her out AFTER threatening to call the cops and cursing at her. However, she didn't leave the area and proceeded to the customer waiting area outside to get ready and do her hair. We sat there waiting uncomfortably while she proceeded to yell out, asking for food. Why didn't anyone call to have her removed from the property? I have no clue. \nBy 12:45 several groups had already gone in before us, parties of 2's and 3's. We realized then that they were not going according to the list but by table availability. Which was rather frustrating since we already had to wait outside uncomfortably and starving because we were so excited to try their food. When we asked how much longer we had to wait, the host/waitress was extremely rude about it saying she didn't know and that it depended on the number of tables available. She didn't apologize for the long wait or anything. However it didn't seem that hard to just pull up another chair to seat a party of four. By then we decided to just leave and eat elsewhere since their customer service and wait time is complete shit.", "author": "Stephanie N."}

Get here quick, because wait times aren't immense right now, but there are only so many king-dum's (at $8) per day. Get one; you'll thank me later. It's a giant xiao long bao, and even though the thing is magnified by 5, it still carries the same thin skin and awesome pork filling and hot soup. That also means you have to get the xiao long bao. While you're at it, they're famous for their gyoza, and the pork ones don't disappoint. Ah heck, since you've had that much, start with the crispy, sauteed string beans and shrimp toast. It's exactly the same, if not better than the same dim sum places you grew up eating at. Want just a little bit more? The har gow are fantastic. Their wrapping skin is really what makes it, as it's perfectly translucent, springy, and thin. The same can be said for what's inside. Loads of real, springy shrimp.

We ordered the following:\npork XLB: the pork was raw when we first got it. the second time around, we got 5 instead of 6, so we had to ask them to send in another order. when we finally got our order, the soup was good, but it was unclear whether the meat I was eating was really pork or just a lot of fat. it was definitely not high quality meat. on top of it, XLB in the foil just kind of ruins the experience for me. If you can make it well, you don't need the foil. \nhar gao: the cream cheese is weird. this isn't ravioli and I don't understand why add the cream cheese. \nchicken bao: nothing wrong with it, but it's also just nothing to rave home about.\ngarlicy green beans: it's a bit dry, nothing more than what you get in any Cantonese cafe.\nshrimp toast: my favorite. I could do without the sauce. \npork xi'an dumpling: this one is very pretty with the micro green, but the taste is just ok.\noverall, because this isn't your Cantonese cafe, I expected something better. I don't think they use high quality ingredients and it shows in the food. when you try to be better than the status quo and do creative things, you also have to step up in the ingredients you are using.

The staff is friendly and attentive. One of the waiters even noticed I was trying to Shazam the song they were playing and offered to get the name of it for me haha that was a plus. My favorites are the pork xlb and tomyum xlb. For dessert, you can't go wrong with the trio (I think they recently renamed this to the threesom) so you can taste a bit of everything. The kingdom was fun to try at least once (and it makes for a great photo op).

Also got the crispy/pan seared chicken bao which tasted great (unless you're like some weirdos I know who don't like mushrooms then you should probably skip these ) Fro Happy Endings/dessert, we got the Trio of Buns just so we could try them all. Loved the Beet & Taro Bun the best as it wasn't too sweet like the Green Tea & Milk Bun. I think they are in the preparation of having the outside dock area for outside seatings in the near future.

I had this restaurant on my list for awhile as I, like everybody else, wanted the giant soup dumpling that you drink with a straw.  I only ever had this in Shanghai and was happy to see it here. Unfortunately when we ordered, we were curtly told they were sold out of these.  This is simply poor planning/management. It was 1PM on a Saturday, and yes there was crowd, but it wasn't so crowded that it would completely blow your estimation of what was needed for the day.  Especially given the known popularity of the dish. \n\nWe ordered some noodles and a few other dumplings.  Like others noted, the dishes are on the smaller side, particularly the noodles. The dumplings were average - not bad, not good, though one dish was a bit mushy. \n\nI really wanted to try the King-Dum, but I don't know if I'd return or recommend it to others as I wouldn't want to come back only to be told it's unavailable again especially as the place is a bit out of the way.  I'm glad we only had to wait 20 minutes, I would have been much more annoyed if I waited hours as other reviews stated only to find out the one dish I wanted they didn't have. Honestly, the other dishes weren't stand outs from any other dim sum/ Chinese restaurants. If you want to try it, either go early or skip altogether.

I was not paid by another restaurant to write this review, but rather, so upset by the meal that I felt compelled to write this review\n\nPros\n+ Prep is quick, food is served quickly and service is decent overall \n+ Ambiance is also positive, and also very convenient in terms of location being right next to my office\n\nCons\n- Where to begin.. The food is hot trash. Period. This restaurant does not respect authentic Chinese recipes and I'm appalled that they'd even pass this place off as a dumpling house. -\n- Cream cheese in a Har Gow? Peanut butter in a Char Siu Bao? Just stop.\n- To be even more specific, the Xi'an dumplings tasted like mash potatoes or beans wrapped in a dumpling. Furthermore, it was completely shrouded in radish and tomatoes. WHAT? \n- The XLB was absolutely flavorless. The soup inside had no taste & the skin was stuck to the wrapping and I could not eat it the way I wanted to\n\nBottom line: You should avoid this restaurant if you have any knowledge of what an actual dumpling should taste like. People rating the food here as \"great\" or even \"good\" most likely don't have taste buds or have extremely low standards. I don't expect this place to last longer than 1 year.", "author": "ryan k."}

By SF standards, that's a huge bargain.", "author": "Ajit K."}

What an anti climax- we had high hopes after spending 30 mins in the queue waiting for a table. Maybe if you have ever eaten dumplings before you would have been impressed but anyone was has eaten some great dumplings before will not be coming back. \n\nThe dumplings were fresh, you can see them making them but completely lacked flavour. Bao buns were just ok- bread was tasty but filling was dry and pretty bland. You can always tell a good dumpling place by the sauce and the chilli sauce was not spicy and only came with soy sauce, no dumpling sauce. The xian pork dumplings were tasty they were the silver lining. \n\nService was also unimpressive.\n\nWe won't be back and I wouldn't go out of your way to make it here.", "author": "Allie S."}

The seafood gyoza with spinach skin was so plumb and tasty, we had to go for two more rounds. The vegetarian xian dumpling came pleasantly surprised with pickled vegetables.  The green tea and milk dessert bun was enjoyable.  The friendly general manager spearheaded the wait staff who did their best to serve the crowd with smiles.

The hostess ripped the sign in sheet away from us just as we were reaching for the pen to sign in. She proceeded to ignore us completely while she walked outside to call out tables. We followed her outside and after she was done calling out tables we asked her to add our names to the list.  She responded by dashing back inside while saying that the sign in sheet and pen are over here, back at the original spot.  3 separate parties took this opportunity to jump ahead of us in line and sign in before us.  Just a ridiculously rude and unorganized way to handle your first interaction with customers. Once we were finally seated, it took a rather long time to be approached by a waitress.  We ordered a good amount of food, which then came out in a completely random order (appetizer, my main, her dumplings, her main, my dumplings, 2nd appetizer). This made a small table completely crowded. On top of that, we had to send back the veggie noodles because they had egg in it (vegan), even though the ingredients listed on the menu didn't mention egg, but did mention tofu, of which there was none.  They didn't apologize or offer any solution to that, so only one of us had a complete meal.\n\nThis dining experience left a bad taste in our mouths during our last night in San Francisco.", "author": "Mark T."}

We ordered our food and received our packager receipt at 6:06 for four items and we did not see the first item until 6:36. I didn't really pay any mind to it as the ambience was very nice but I expected the food to come out in a steady flow as I had noticed for other tables. We finished our first course and didn't receive the second until 7 pm. At this point I was becoming extremely wary as people who had arrived after us were receiving wave after wave of food. At 7:15 I asked the waiter about that status of our food because we were still starving and he said that the King-Dum takes 15 minutes, while I was trying to explain we had ordered over an hour ago he quickly brushed me off and walked away. At the point I flagged him down and pressed the issue further. When I received my chicken bao I received one less dumpling than advertised and the king-dum was extremely underwhelming and barely had any soup. Overall the food was extremely mediocre for the time waited. I will not be returning.", "author": "Weston T."}
