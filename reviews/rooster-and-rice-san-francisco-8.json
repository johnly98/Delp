It's not just plain white rice, it's seasoned and goes amazing with the soy ginger sauce.

For anyone working in the Financial District and want a filling lunch, Rooster & Rice will check all the boxes. The line can get long during lunch hours with most tables full, but it's easy to bring back to the office!\n\nThe menu is straightforward without any crazy items. You get a good amount of chicken (or whichever option) for the higher price. I was disappointed that all the flavor is in the sauces. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious but it makes me believe I can easily make this dish at home for a quarter of the price. I do like you get a soup with your meal too! The little things make all the difference.\n\nFor an extra wow, get the soft boiled egg and put the sauce on top! It'll transform your view on the egg! But don't feel pressured in getting an egg. Having worked in F&B, it still feels like a rip off paying a dollar for an egg when they're buying eggs for around 50 cents/dozen. \n\nAnyway, if you're on a lunch break alone or with a coworker, I'd recommend this as an option!

The menu is pretty limited --  but there's no issue in doing one thing well. And they do chicken well -- it's plump and juicy.\n\n\"The Original\" is chicken breast and thigh served with the skin on. The skin gives it a bit of extra fat/taste which I recommend but you can order it skinless, if you prefer. It comes jasmine white rice. You can (and should) pay extra for egg or veggies (each are $2). \n\nThere's also an extra sauce option for $1 but you don't need it. There's free habanero and sriracha sauces. We preferred the sriracha -- it had a kick but wasn't too spicy. The whole thing is served in a cardboard container with plastic utensils.\n\n\"The Marina\" is skinless chicken breast and organic brown rice. It's also solid but I prefer the original. If I get this again, I would order the sauce as the rice was a little dry. There're also a paleo option -- chicken and veggies, no rice.\n\nYou also get a small container of bone broth. This was hot and tasty -- a pleasant and healthy surprise.\n\nThis Rooster & Rice location is small with limited seating. Come early or late for lunch to avoid long lines.

Even so, never had chicken so simple yet juicy every time (surprising for chicken breast especially)!  I personally don't need any seasoning for this (personal preference) b/c it simply lets the chicken shine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-12", "description": "Street food is the essence of Southeast Asian cuisine.  Chicken and rice is a basic dish in almost all cuisines.  A staple that many connoisseurs seek here is the famed Hainan chicken and rice.  This is offered mainly in Malaysian/Singaporean though sometimes found in Vietnamese or Burmese restaurants these days.\n\nRecently, many of classic Asian dishes are making their way to the mainstream market including this.  My search for this, my dad's favorite, led me to ABC in Chinatown (closed about two years ago) and Banana Island in Daly City. Late last year, my friend surprised me with a box on our way to a Warriors' game with a box of food (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=jLV0bGDuLgzOc6m2mydEmA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  It turns out my friend ordered the Original (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=1dmW1YjvNODDhJXpRymj9Q&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  I took a few bites only that night as it was late by the time I got home after the game.  It was delicious but would definitely keep me awake on a work night.  I actually had this the next day (do not advise reheating) for dinner.  Here is my checklist for this dish:\n\nChicken - perfectly sous vide as you don't need teeth to chew this; nice that they use breast and thigh meats and there are no bones to pick here... literally.\n\nRice - nicely flavored and actually didn't starch up like most when refrigerated; some places use butter to sauce this up but it tasted like they use the broth from the chicken likely.\n\nCondiments - the dipping or pouring sauce (your preference) paired well with the chicken and the rice, not overpowering; would have enjoyed a second sauce (red chili sauce is the norm in Asia and many places here).\n\nFor leftovers and, moreover, for such a specialty dish, I was surprised that it was still so good the next night. Price wise, don't expect street food pricing especially given the location and cost of doing business here.  Will try to stop here for lunch one of these afternoons and try it fresh.", "author": "Mike C."}

I was intrigued by the Hainan-Style Chicken that was served with rice cooked in their homemade chicken broth that the chickens are boiled in. \n\nI ordered \"The Original\" aka Kai Mun Gai. Verdict? Let me break it down:\n\n* The Chicken: Very moist. I was afraid it might taste \"gamey\" but had a natural chicken flavor throughout. Wished it was served skinless as the skin can be used for chicken cracklings (as they do serve at the Filbert St location). It is served with cucumbers which I loved to cleanse the palate and cut through the richness of the protein. I wasn't into the soybean ginger sauce as it was too overpowering for the integrity of the chicken lol!\n\n* The Broth: Very clear broth which means they cooked it right and skimmed off all the impurities from the cooking process. However, it was heavy on the salt. I had to dilute it with some water to tone it down. It would've been so comforting:(\n\n* The Rice: OMG...the rice was SO FLAVORFUL!!!! Very aromatic and you could really taste the chicken broth it was cooked in. I could just eat this alone with their house habanero sauce ( which is so good for all you spice lovers)!\n\nConclusion: I would go back again to give them a second try but I'll probably end up going to the Filbert St location as they serve the crispy chicken skin.

I got The Marina (#2 on the menu), and at first the chicken looked pretty dry, not what I was expecting. When I saw my coworker's chicken, it was all drenched in wet sauce. Then I realized, I had to do that myself with the little sauce container that they provide.\n\nOk, now I dig in... and wow, the chicken not only _looks_ dry, but it actually _is_ dry inside. The sauce on the outside tastes good, and I want the entire chicken to be marinated and cooked in a pot of it! But I guess after eating this healthy clean chicken breast, I don't feel oily and crappy on the inside. Also, the broth that comes with it is hot and delicious!\n\nOverall, although the chicken was dry, I did enjoy it.

Normally, I'm not a fan of chicken, but I didn't really have a preference for what I wanted to have for lunch that day so I just went along with this. Other than the recommendation, I didn't really know anything about this place before I came here, although I did pass by this place a couple of times. \n\nWhen I saw the menu, I was surprised that they only had four items on their menu. But maybe the simplicity of their offerings allowed them to focus on the quality of their food. I was thinking about getting The Marina or The Paleo, but I was feeling like getting some rice, and The Marina didn't seem to have chicken thigh. I ended up getting The Original since it had both chicken breast and thigh. \n\nThe Original has slices of chicken breast, thigh, rice and cucumbers along with a cup of chicken broth. It also came with the chili, ginger, garlic and soybean sauce. The chicken broth was pretty clear and tasted great. I liked the chicken thigh better than the breast, and it was good by itself. However, my favorite part of the dish was the sauce, since it really enhanced the flavors of the chicken and rice. Was a very nice touch to the dish. \n\nI added a small spoonful of the rice to the broth, and it was awesome. I probably should have set more rice aside given how much I enjoyed this. I'll remember this for next time.\n\nChicken's not really my first choice of protein, but the sauce really did it for me. The broth was excellent and only made the dish better.

For better or for worse, you always remember your first time for anything.  The first time I've had poached chicken (Hainanese tho) was at Banana Island when I was in high school.  I've had several since, but I could never find one that excited me like the first time.  Let's face it poached chicken itself isn't exciting even if the skin is still on, but when you pair it up with flavorful soy ginger garlic sauce + a hot sauce it's pretty special.  And still healthy, right?  That's what I'm telling myself.  And let's not forget the chicken fat rice!  Okay, that may not be healthy, but healthier than greasy fried rice, yes?  I've always loved Hainanese Chicken and from time to time have the craving. \n\nI've had Rooster & Rice bookmarked for their version of this treat, Khao Mun Gai, ever since they opened up their first location in Marina.  But let's face it that location sucks for parking.  And of course their 2nd & Folsom St location opened way after I stopped working in SOMA.  So you could imagine how excited I was to see when the Kearny Street location opened.  After one failed attempt after my 11:30 Barry's class got out, I wasn't going to wait in that long line!  So, I made my way to the shop around 11:15-11:30 on a Friday a couple weeks later.  There were only a few people inside and no line.  I ordered the original though I was trying to be good and contemplating getting the Paleo for the broccoli.  The Original comes with breast and thigh meat, chicken fat rice, chicken broth and this amazing soybean ginger garlic chili sauce.  They also have Sriracha and a habanero hot sauce at the utensils station but you won't really need it because 1) their sauce has a little spice to it and 2) it's cracktastic!  \n\nAfter a few minutes my order was ready and I brought it back to the office to indulge in.  I took sips of the comforting flavorful chicken broth.  My coworker said it smelled amazing and reminded her of posole.  LOL Anyways, the chicken was super moist and light even the breast meat.  It had some flavor but the wonderful sauce takes it to another level.  Lastly, the chicken rice was flavorful and fluffy, and the slices of cucumber rounded out the dish to give it some crunch.  I loved the sprig of cilantro too.  \n\nIt's a bit priceyish at $12 pretax but it's a wonderful, comforting, and delicious treat.  And depending on how you look at it, healthyish.

In an area where lunch can easily be $20, this is an everyman's meal and hits all the criteria for the kind of lunch area you would want to go, if you work in this area. I don't work around here nor live close to here. I was craving some Hainan chicken and rice and even though Rooster & Rice markets themselves at Khao Mun Gai, it's similarly enough. A quick walk from the Montgomery station and I found myself behind a quick moving line. I got the original-chicken breast and thigh over jasmine rice. Some cucumbers on the side. No egg. I received my order pretty quickly (checkmark on quickness of service, v. important when you have to rush back to work). At home, I dug into my food and..felt meh. The meat was not as tender as other Khao Mun Gai/ Hainan Chicken I've had. It tasted rubbery after a while and bland. The sauce that it came with helped but the chicken is definitely a 7/10. The rice wasn't too bad, flavorful but it was weird. Some of it seemed to have not been cooked in chicken fat, leaving 85% with that melt in your mouth chicken fat taste and the rest (15%) loose, bland white rice. What was the point of the cucumbers? They were soggy and most likely served as decorations. I felt some regret as I bit into the first slice. I should have known better. Perhaps it was because I wasn't rushing to devour my lunch before my lunch hour was up, which was why I tasted everything so succinctly but next time I have a craving for Khao Mun Gai on a day off, I'll look for somewhere else.

After downing the Original in record rime, I remember asking co-owner Bryan Lew if he was considering opening another shop closer to SoMa as I said I would be a more frequent customer as it takes me a while to get to the Marina on MUNI. I think I may have offered to wear a chicken suit and sing \"Tennessee Bird Walk\" a capella on the sidewalk. Lucky for you it didn't come down to that, and in fact, I was surprised he made it happen with not only a SoMa location (review: http://bit.ly/2D1q7mC) but now this spot in the heart of the FiDi right on Kearny.\n\nIf I was still working in the FiDi, I'm guessing I would be there every other day. Going every day might border on the ridiculous, don't you think? I met Jamie W. here after work as herds of office workers were making their way to Market Street to get home. There was only one young Asian couple dining here, so service was pretty fast. In fact, most of the customers who came in after us were young Asian couples with the occasional tall blonde boyfriend looking bewildered that he didn't end up at Chipotle like he suggested. The staff was also unsurprisingly young and Asian. We were thrilled they served the $12.95 Paleo because Jamie and I are trying to minimize our intake of rice even though the Hainan-style rice is extremely tasty.

For those who get their daily carbs from whiskey/wine like me and generally would order something like The Paleo - stop it and give in to the delicious rice that is meant to accompany the chicken.  \n\nWith my Hainanese roots, The Original really hit home for me and was very reminiscent of the Hainanese chicken rice. The major difference is the sauce, since this is a Thai chicken and rice. In The Original, both the breast and thigh chicken were succulent, but dunking it in that chili garlic soybased sauce was heavenly. The sauce is not overly garlicky, but you may still want some gum afterwards. All dishes come with a chicken broth that really warms the heart on a cold day. \n\nAt this location in FiDi, lunch time is crazy, but the staff here move the line pretty quick.

My meal was heightened to another level upon trying this guy out. It's complimentary at the napkin station; also sold in bottles at the counter.

The name explains it all, you get chicken and rice.\n\nWhat I liked:\n* Simple and filling. The Original which is what I normally get is just steamed chicken (breast and thigh) and rice (with a couple cucumber slices) as well as a soy based sauce on the side. It also comes with some chicken soup/broth on the side which which is a bit oily for my taste, but still not bad.\n* Great hot sauce that you can get on the side. Pick the habanero over the sriracha unless you can't handle the heat very well. It's sweet and has enough kick to it that you can feel, but not enough to ruin your meal or stomach. I definitely wouldn't come here as often if they didn't have the habanero hot sauce.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n* A bit pricey. With tax, you end up paying $13+ for a relatively normal meal.\n* Limited seating. If you come here for dinner on a weekday, expect to wait for seating or get takeout.\n* Usually a decent wait for your food, but I guess it doesn't exactly claim to be fast-food.", "author": "Michael M."}

But due to inconsistency issues, I hardly ever go back there. \n\nWhen they have the recipe right, it's amazing! The chicken is fragrant and juicy, the garlic rice is also fragrant with the perfect texture, and the chicken broth is good and soothing. They have really good habenaro sauce to go with it too.\n\nBut when they don't have the recipe right, it's a disappointment. Sometimes the chicken is dry and other times the rice is too hard or way too mushy. The inconsistency happened regularly.\n\nSo when they opened the FiDi location last year (2017), which is somewhat near my work, I've decided to stop by for a try. I stood in their long line full of excitement because I haven't had it for a while. \n\nOf course, when I took my first bite, I regretted it. Their rice was hard, and the portion of the meat was tiny. I had an assumption that they were still working out their kinks at this new location, so I've decided to not go back until I've given them enough time to get settled.\n\nToday was the day I've decided to go back... and I'd have to say, it's a lot better than the first time. The broth is not too salty, and the portion of meat is perfect. Unfortunately, I found the meat a bit dry, rice was a bit mushy but tolerable, and the raw sliced cucumber tasted old. Again, it's inconsistent.\n\nI will go back there when I'm craving for something warm and hearty, and my stress level's so high at work that I needed comfort food (I'm Asian who grew up with Singapore's Hainan Chicken Rice, which is MY comfort food) but it won't be my go-to place. \n\nFYI, I would never compare Rooster & Rice with Singapore's Hainan Chicken Rice. It's slightly different, especially the sauce that comes with it. Rooster & Rice says they serve Thai Chicken Rice. Anyways, whether you're craving for a chicken rice version from Singapore or Thailand, let's be less critical and give Rooster & Rice props for introducing and making this Asian dish popular in this liberal city.", "author": "Summer O."}

Restaurant design is new and minimalist and designed to be more like a fast food store.", "author": "Emile L."}

It has a delicious homemade taste and is super quick to pick up.  The original is the thing to get, but if you want a bit of greenery add on a side of veggies.", "author": "A C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-02", "description": "Love the original chicken rice, which is pretty much the Hainan chicken. The chicken rice and the chicken work so well together. It really brings thr flavor of chicken to life, not to mention the broth was also very tasty. Wish this is a bigger portion but still give it a 5 stars because of how good it tasted.", "author": "Jing W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-19", "description": "It's good for what it is and for some of us, this is comfort food.  But it's very simple and it's very expensive. For a plate with rice and poached chicken, you will paying about $15+.  And the broth literally tastes like Swanson's out of a can.", "author": "Diana M."}
