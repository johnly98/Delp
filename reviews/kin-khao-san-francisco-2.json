It slowly filled up but we were the firsts one in. I'm generally nervous being the first to a restaurant because it can take the kitchen awhile to get the stoves fired up, etc. but it wasn't the case here! \n\nI ordered the Khao soi (chewy egg noodles in a curry broth - so good to have a warm noodle soup on a cold and foggy SF day). boyfriend got fried beef rice noodles and his was perfectly cooked (crispy but still chewy, a little char, yum). We also ordered a curry mousse with chanterelle mushrooms to spread over rice cakes and that was the Best! Chanterelles are so savory and chewy, and paired perfectly with the curry mousse. What a fun, unique, and delicious dish. \n\nService was kinda impersonal but whatever. Delicious & would go again.", "author": "Rebecca Y."}

We fortunately made reservations at least a week in advance though you can afford to wait the week of. If you just wanna show up, wait times will be about 30-45. Located in the ground floor of parc 55/Hilton, Kin Khao does delicious Thai food with authentic quality ingredients. The taste reflects that, but so will the price.\n\nWe started off with the hot wings. Comes with 3 normally. So tender. Well sauced, that had a decent kick but also a slight acidic taste to it. Everything from the moist chicken to chicken skin to sauce was on point. Since there were two of us, they added in a fourth chicken wing and charged us for it. Thoughtful but wish they asked. Then we got the caramelized pork belly. So fatty. So tender. So good. So fatty. Would def pair it with the sticky rice. A good amount of soy sauce in the sauce, but it was so good. \n \nWould love to be back.", "author": "Will X."}

I sat at the bar and spotted what looked like a fixed price menu, with two or three choices at each stage of the meal. Turned out, it was a group menu and the dishes were all on offer. Pricey - but it looked like a great way to try a lot. \n\nFrom the One Bite in a Leaf it was all fresh, aromatic and delicious. \n\nThe Dirty Girl tomatoes were a simple and textural delight, not overwhelming the delicate freshness of the beautiful little tomatoes. The Nam Tok Beans were probably my least favourite dish, a little too... beany. The texture just didn't work for me. \n\nThe squid was spicy sour and cooked al dente, and the caramelised pork belly that came out with it was cooked to melt in the mouth voluptuousness. The richness was nearly overwhelming. \n\nThe highlight for me was the green rabbit curry. Tender, not at all dry and perfect for eating with the accompanying rice. \n\nDessert was a cooling tannic and sweet soft serve of Thai tea. \n\nAll portions were surprisingly generous, and by the time the rabbit curry arrived I was in way over my head. It was a delight to sample so many very different dishes, but it felt wasteful to be unable to eat more than half of what was presented.

I called the night before and was so glad they only had 5:45pm and 7:30pm available on a Tuesday evening. Once there, our server was really friendly and helpful. We ended up ordering the vegetarian curry (the fried egg omelette inside is delectable), which I really loved. It comes with rice so no need to order additional rice for two people. We also got their one noodle dish with chicken, which wasn't as great but pretty good. \n\nOverall, I recommend this place if you're looking for something different and tasty. Just note the high price point. They have really unique dishes I've never seen at a Thai place before (rabbit and clams?). \n\nThe main downside of our whole experience was how pushy the hostess was to get us out.

We came for a Saturday lunch and had traffic issues, arrived 40 minutes after our reservation time, but they still squeezed us in. Fantastic service!! Usually when I get Thai food, I want insanely satisfying homey and comforting asian food: Pad Thai, Tom yum, etc. Kin Khao is different- a Westerized, upscale take on Thai food while staying true to its flavors. We had the Khao Soi curry noodles and the basil ground pork with a fried egg and rice. Both were carefully thought out well made- we left full and happy. \n\nUltimately, Kin Khao is a fun place to go for upscale Thai food. The food is fantastic with a great atmosphere.

We called ahead to make a reservation for a late dinner on a Monday night. It's located on a corner inside the Parc 55 hotel. The host was warm and inviting as he showed us to our table but I wish I could say the same about our waitress. She did eventually ease up as the night when on. This is not your typical Thai restaurant. The food is elevated with bold flavors. If the menu seems too over the top or pricey, there is literally another Thai restaurant across the street (trust me, we debated it). We ordered the yaowaraj noodle (flat noodles w/chicken), pretty hot wings, caramelized pork belly, massaman nuea (braised beef cheeks curry), and mussels & stone fruit gaeng kua curry. Of the dishes ordered, I probably wouldn't get the wings again. The wings were good but not worth the price point for what you get. The massaman curry had strong spices in it so don't expect the sweet coconut curries you're used to. The beef cheeks and pork belly were both tender to where a knife was not needed. A con with Kin Khao is you are charged for rice. It's considered as a side here but completely necessary if you are eating the pork belly or curry. On the pro side of things you experience Thai food on another level. Overall everything we ate was good and yes, Kin Khao is expensive. Spending over $150 for four at a Thai restaurant isn't common but as the 1 Michelin star rating states- worth a visit.

If you don't drink alcohol, maybe check out the limeade. It's beautiful, its color changes as you stir the drink the first time!\n* Food is served family style, which means they put the dishes in the middle and everyone shares. Portions are bigger than for 1 person, but not much bigger though, so I'd still recommend 1 dish per person, with adjustments depending on how much everyone eats in your party.\n* Food is a bit different from the regular thai restaurants, their menu seems more modern or fusion, I'm not sure how to describe it... but if I was craving a creamy chicken curry, I probably wouldn't come here (they don't even serve a simple chicken curry, their green curry comes with rabbit and the masaman is beef cheek).\n* That being said, everything we tried was delicious. I'll start with the curries, since that's my favorite dish overall: the rabbit curry ($36) was very good, but the rabbit is hard to eat due to the bones. It also comes with a couple of (rabbit) meatballs. The masamam nuea ($36) was gamey and rich in flavor. Neither was too spicy.\n* Pretty Hot Wings ($14): really really good, out of the 6 dishes we got, this is 1 of the 2 I want to eat again next time. The 3 chicken wings are pretty big, and super rich in flavor. \n* Caramelized Pork Belly ($22): the other winner of the night. It smells like heaven and tastes incredibly. Made me forget I was on a diet. I think the dish comes with 4 pieces of fat pork belly.\n* Namprik Ong ($18): this is some sort of chilli paste that you put onto veggies or the pork cracklings. I'm not a fan of this one, and there were only 2 pork cracklings, so it was really hard to share. Other people really loved it though.\n* Yaowaraj noodle ($20): noodles with toppings... in my opinion, inferior to any pad thai I've had, not a fan, wouldn't recommend it.\n* Sitcky rice ($4) or plain rice come in a big bucket to share among 2-3 or more people.\nWe also had drinks and desserts~", "author": "Mimi Y."}

We had to resort to going on yelp (THANK YOU YELP COMMUNITY) to pick dishes. \n\nMy favourite dish was the Yaowaraj Noodle, which was a lot like a pad see ew with lots of chicken; the vinegar on the side added a completely different, but complimentary flavour profile. We also had the chicken wings, which were good, and not too spicy at all despite the name. They were crispy and came with a really nice sauce that was sweet and slightly  spicy. The worst was definitely  Laab Kua. Now I like my spice (thank you Korean heritage), but this was either accidentally waaaay over spiced, or it was just incredibly spicy.The notes were just really spicy and really salty and intense garlic (which I actually really liked). I've had Laab before, and it was amazing (@sabai sabai), but this was juts a mess of too spicy, too salty AKA heartburn with some veggies. While some of you may be asking why we didn't send it back, it's because I hate that, and unless I find glass in my food, I am unlikely to send it back. The sticky rice was really nice! \n\nWould I come back, maybe to try other dishes, like the pork belly that every table was having, but I don't know if I'll be rushing back anytime soon.", "author": "Heather C."}

I grew up in Thai Land and am well acquainted with salty food, but I must say never before have I paid this much for non-edible food! I gave this place 2 tries already, so will not be coming back.\n\nI ordered the wings and bean salad today. \n\nWings - EXTREMELY SALTY, and super tart. I advise the restaurant to add some sugar to balance the tartness and saltiness. \n\nBean salad - Ive had many versions of this type of salad. It's called larb in Thai. Honestly, this is a horrible way to make larb. Tofu would be a better option than beans. Almost forgot, it's also SUPER SALTY!!!\n\nI paid $30 + $6 tips Across the street is another Thai restaurant; I suspect my money would be better spent over there. \n\nI ordered the blood rice before and while it looks interesting and pretty, it's not good.", "author": "Jackson S."}

Though honestly it's still one of the chillest and most casual Micheline dining experiences I've ever had. Food has been great both times I've been here. Some items are amazing while others are just good but the price isn't bad, there's never been to long of a wait, and I've always left happy. The only downside to my visit this time was the service. They were friendly but we had a really difficult time waving anyone down for help.\n\nFor our meal we got the following:\n1) Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine (Curry Mousse in a jar w/ mushrooms served w/ crisp rice cake): Despite the fact that this was my least favorite item during my last visit (not to say I didn't really like it) I found myself craving the creamy mousse and their wonderfully crisp rice cake.  The bit of coconut at the top provides some nice sweet relief to the slight heat from the curry. It's the same as the first time and I still really like it. (4/5)\n\n2) Khao Kan Jin (Pork + Rice + Blood Sausage in a banana leaf w/ garlic chips + fried & raw shallots w/ cilantro and lime): My main entree. Not quite an entree size which is sad cause it's freaking delicious. I am addicted to that sticky rice w/ the blood. Then when you add all the herbs both fresh and fried and top it with cilantro, there's just so much goodness in each bite. Only downside is the price to portion (4.75/5)\n\n3) Khao Mun Gai (Chicken Fat Rice w/ Ginger Poached Chicken w/ Cup of chicken broth): Friend's entree. This is more of an entree size. Rice has some background taste of chicken fat but not as rich as she hoped. Chicken was very moist and well made though not super flavorful but the sauce was there to fix that. The real star though was that random cup of broth. We almost didn't want to drink it cause it was just so amazing. It looks like your average chicken broth but it has the richness and concentrated flavor of gravy. It's magical (4.5/5)\n\nOverall, I really love this place. I'm glad it has a Michelin star though I don't know if it's elevated to that level but then again it's just a name and the award is kinda arbitrary so whatever.  It's upscale Thai food and it's good.

Not quite in the fashion a discreet speak easy would purposefully rid itself of any publicly visible access, Kin Khao is no less easy to find.  Located in the far stretches of the Parc 55 hotel in a remote alcove with dim lights and the echoes of patrons gawking over the menu, one thought clung in my mind - what a smart marketing strategy.  Yes... how do you make good food even better?  Get your already-hungry customers to work a little more at it just to be a little more hungry so that when the food is served it is no short of a miracle on a plate with rainbow beams of glory shining down from heaven onto your plate. To be honest, that is 80% of what made the food good - the extra hunger. \n\nI must caveat my review with the fact that I had spent 2 weeks in Thailand prior to trying Kin Khao - and had consumed Thai food every day of that trip.  As such, though I was happy with the meal and would certainly venture back to eat it, it simply was a tier lower than the quality of Thai food in Thailand \n\nI tried the menu items that came recommended as \"signature dishes\" by the waiter, each described in turn:\n\n(1) Nam Tok Beans - the chili, lime, and cilantro flavors certainly came through and for a moment, I was mind boggled. I thought it may actually be taco flavored beans or more Mexican. Nonetheless, the flavor burst was enjoyable. \n\n(2) Khao Yum - Yum, (Kin) Khao!  I loved the blend of turmeric rice and the different flavor profiles that accompanied it - the herbs, the vegetables, the coconut, and shallots. It felt like eating a rainbow. My one disappointment with this is I wish the portion size were larger. \n\n(3) Mushroom Curry - A bummer I don't think this is on the menu anymore. As you can tell from the pictures it was so delicious I had forgotten to take a picture of it and took the picture half eaten.  I loved the FUN in how the varieties of FUNgi and curry flavors blended with each other to make for a really memorable and satisfying flavor profile. \n\n(4) Black Rice Pudding - This was probably my favorite dish because it caught me by surprise. I didn't expect to enjoy the flavor combination so much. I loved how the strawberry-hibiscus blend complemented the salty coconut cream and sesame.  \n\nOne area of improvement is the service - be careful with your order. We had asked for sticky rice and got plain rice (I know, supreme bummer). In addition, the waiter forgot the side of stir friend baby choi sum. Can't blame the place - they are simply too busy. But it would be nice to have timely and accurate service. A girl can dream.", "author": "Vivienne K."}

Had no idea how popular this place was and didn't know it was a Michelin haha but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. As a lone guest, I easily found space at the bar (though by the time I left, there was a line). I wasn't very hungry as I was jetlagged so I only got 2 appetizers and 2 drinks. The bartender, Matt, is incredible making 3-4 drinks at a time while taking orders and attending to guests at the bar. He got some help later into the night but he really didn't need any. I ordered the Siam Sipper and Kem Kon for my drinks and then the Caramelized Pork Belly and Plah Pla Muek (Squid) with sticky rice.\n\nWasn't too crazy over the Siam Sipper (Thai style old fashion). Didn't taste a big difference from a normal old fashioned but that might be because my tongue was on fire from the Squid dish haha. The Kem Kon was a pretty and delicious drink.\n\nThe pork belly melted in my mouth and went really well with the spicy tangy-ness of the squid. (I love spicy and the squid definitely builds up but it was only the tip of my tongue that burned) I mixed the sticky rice with the squid sauce and it was amazing.

Kin Khao got on my radar after they received a Michelin star and I was excited to see what they're all about. To be honest I didn't know what to expect compared to other Michelin establishments, but I enjoyed how relaxed the dining experience here was. Now that it has a Michelin star I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time. \n\nKin Khao is located beneath the Parc 55 hotel so it's quite easy to get to. The restaurant itself is broken up into a square and a triangle shape so it was surprising to see how they organized the place to make it feel open and inviting. \n\n| FOOD | \n\n*We were tempted by their pre-fixe tasting menu for $60/pp but this time around we decided to get more of the family sized options. \n\n+ Nam Tok Beans - One of my favorites during our meal. This dish is served lettuce wrap style so the lettuce added a nice contrast to the sweet/sour flavor of the beans. It was a refreshing way to start our meal.\n\n+ Caramelized Pork Belly - YUM. You really can't go wrong with this dish. The dish comes with 4 pieces of their tender pork belly cooked in a clay pot. The pork belly was melt in your mouth and when you pair it with sticky rice it was delicious. The sauce that comes in the pot is also a nice addition to add to your spicy grilled squid. Trust me... try it out. \n\n+ Grilled Squid - I was also a fan of this, but my BF not so much. I thought the squid was cooked well and was not too rubbery. It's unassumingly on the spicy side so watch out how much sauce you add with each bite. This wasn't heavy at all so it paired well with the savory pork belly.\n\n+ Rabbit Curry - I've never had rabbit before so I was a little skeptical of this dish but I was pleasantly surprised with how tasty it was. The curry had a nice heat in the sauce and the rabbit didn't taste gamey at all. The portion size of the rabbit was enough to share between two people and it was also so tender that it fell off the bone. The meatballs weren't my fave, but this paired really well with a side of jasmine rice. \n\n+ Sticky Rice - The sticky rice here is a nice change from normal jasmine rice. Their version doesn't take on the sweetness as what you'd expect with the name \"sticky rice\" so it's a nice pairing to the dishes. \n\n+ Thai Tea Soft Serve - Kin Khao didn't have too many dessert options, but this was a nice way to cool off from all the heat in the meal. The thai tea soft serve wasn't too sweet so the condensed milk/tapioca balls added the additional sweetness. The toasted coconut added depth to the flavors and was a nice texture change. \n\nAfter visiting Thailand recently I learned about \"Thai Spicy\" and I love how Kin Khao incorporated the spice component into their dishes while ensuring the the balance with other flavors in their dishes. \n\n| SERVICE | \n\nNo complaints here! From the moment we checked in to when we finished service was impeccable. We had a reservation and came 15 mins early, but the waitress was quick to seat us and the waiter was quick to introduce himself. He was easy to talk to and offered us great recommendations of what to get. Even during our meal he offered pairing advice and suggestions on how to eat certain dishes together to balance the flavors. \n\nI'll definitely come back but it'll probably be for more special occasions.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

Both dishes were delicious. The pork belly was very soft and flavorful but it was on the fatty side. Curry was delicious but I'm not sure if I want to get this dish again. It was good but nothing too special. It was just typical curry with crab meat. Personally I think curry was not worth $55. \n\nNext time I would like to try their prix fixe menu!

I get a noodle dish (pad see ew) at almost every Thai restaurant I visit. The yaowaraj noodles were essentially that and it's description was beautiful.

Although I liked most of the items on the prix fixe menu, I have my favorites and plan to order a la carte the next time I'm there.  It is highly filling though and expect to leave stuffed.\n\nMy 2 top faves?  The mushroom terrine and the caramelized pork belly.  Both of those are must haves if you plan on coming here.  Service has also been attentive both times.\n\nMake a reservation as seats are hard to come by here unless you get there early and find a spot at the bar.  Parking is also terrible in the area.  \n\nI, personally, love this spot and think it absolutely deserves the michelin star!", "author": "Jen W."}

I had not eaten at a restaurant awarded Michelin Star before and was told by a friend this place is a must-try. It did not disappoint. This restaurant can be quite busy so it's highly recommended that you reserve a table beforehand. We were able to get a table 24 hours in advance without a problem.\n\nThey have so many good options, we selected the dishes between looking at yelp reviews and getting advice from the general manager. We ended up ordering Mushroom Hor Mok, the caramelized pork belly and braised beef massaman curry. The dishes are served family style so it's easy to share if you want to.\n\nThe Hor Mok was really good, it comes in a jar and is a curry mouse with mushrooms and other things. It goes so great with the crisp rice cakes. I have never had good rice cakes like this before. A perfect appetizer.\n\nNext, we received the caramelized pork belly with white rice. It was so tender and the flavor was so good. You just can't stop eating it until it's gone!\n\nThe last dish was braised beef massaman curry. This dish was also so tender! Ton's of flavor, a little heat but just about the right heat level. The sauce it comes with is also so good.\n\nWe were so full after this but we couldn't resist trying their Black Rice Pudding dessert. It's served warm and has a great combination of flavors. It's not too sweet, it's just right.\n\nThis was an incredible dining experience, I will definitely want to go back to this restaurant next time I'm in town.", "author": "Magnus L."}

I booked a reservation for 2 for lunch fearing that it would be busy, but it was about half empty so you can be safe to score a table without one too. Their lunch menu is different than their dinner - some of the same apps, but more focused on single bowl items - noodles, rice, etc than shared plates. \n\nFor app, we went with the server recommendation of mushroom terrine. Very, very good. Nice chunks of mushrooms in a creamy curry sauce, served with crispy rice crackers. \n\nFor entrees, I got the khao soi, and my husband got the pork bowl. Khao soi was exceptional. It was just as good in flavor as the best khao soi i had in Chiang Mai, although missing the spicy factor. However, the pork noodle bowl was just okay - broth was too fatty for my liking.\n\nDrinks were good too!

The second time I came we got the braised pork belly and octopus. All the dishes were outstanding. You have to order rice on the side - highly recommend the sticky rice.

It's not often that Thai food is taken and elevated to the next level of dining experiences. People usually go for a quick, cheap meal at many Thai places in the US, but at Kin Khao they take traditional Thai recipes, and using the finest ingredients, create an all round fabulous dining experience. \nMaking a reservation is easy - and highly recommended as lines get long any day of the week. Food presentation is simple but thoughtful. The waiters are very knowledgeable about the food and portion sizing, so listen to what they have to say and recommend! Their wine list has numerous great choices to complement your meal, and naturally their Thai food is phenomenal. \n\nThey go past the usual noodles and rice you see at many Thai restaurants.\nMy favourite here was probably the simplest dish - sweet slow cooked pork belly. I highly recommend getting the sticky rice along with this, and once you eat the pork belly, pour the oozing fatty sauce onto the rice and finish it all up! Another favourite was the beef cheek massaman curry. I could keep listing of great dishes but I honestly think there's more great things on the menu than I can list.\n\nHaving said that, my one complaint is that I ordered the Laab/Larb and it was too salty... the only unfortunate part of my Kin Khao experiences. \n\nTLDR\n11/10 would come back a third time.", "author": "Mati K."}

Crunchy, savory, tangy, soft, everything nice. Added a bit of their sriracha sauce for an added kick.\n\nLaab Kua-Pork lettuce wraps. Also YUM. Looks simple but is full of flavor. The spice sneaks up on you, so beware if you don't like too much spicy food.\n\nThai tea soft serve-Not my favorite but was still pretty good. The tapioca was a nice topping.\n\n\nOnly thing to note is that the portions are fairly small. I expected entr\u00e9e sizes, and they were more like appetizers.

The place is located in a hotel, not very spacious but not too small. We got a table right away on a Sunday night.\n\nTbh all the dishes we had were not impressive to me. It's not the kind of authentic Thai food but more of a modernized version. The Plah Pla Muek - bay squid with spicy/ tangy seafood sauce was okay. If you don't like sour food you might not enjoy this. The Laab Kua - Nothern Thai style minced pork with fried shallot and chili was super spicy I could barely had two spoons. However, it would be great to eat with rice if it were less spicy. I like the Yaowaraj Noodle - kinda like pad see ew with chicken - the most bc it was not oily, the seasoning was just perfect and I love the smell of burned wok pan. \n\nOverall the food was just okay.

I think a pot of curry was close to $30.. and I wasn't sure what about it made it $30.\n\nThe meal I had was good, but very expensive. The portions aren't particularly big and it was kind of on the saltier side.. I had their vegetables which was really good actually, their curry was ok..., I had their braised pork belly which was good as well but a little too salty, I also liked their jasmine rice it resembled sticky rice a lot. \n\nOverall, I'd give it a try but didn't think that it was worth it.

Fish paste comes through.\nMassaman Nuea - The curry was great. It wasn't extremely spicy and it had plenty of flavor.\nLaab Kua - Just thinking about this makes my mouth water. This dish was pretty spicy, but it wasn't something that was unbearable, it was the right type of spice where you just wanted to keep eating it. This dish came with veggies, and pretty much was scoop and eat.\n\nWe also ordered a cocktail which was made with Thai tea. That was a first so we definitely tried it and it was really tasty. If you like Thai Teas, definitely check this one out. \n\nI think it's definitely worth checking out if you like Thai food, your sensitivity to spiciness isn't too high, and if you want to try out a Michelin Star restaurant for a reasonable price...this is your place.", "author": "Bruce K."}

Highly unlike any Thai I've ever had before, and I mean this in the best way! My friend and I were both in the mood for cocktails, and our server did a great job making suggestions. We landed on the Tom Yum and The Artists Reward for me. The Artists Reward reward has mezcal and maraschino, along with some citrus flavors. It wasn't a super strong and smoky mezcal, and the citrus was a great contrast. I also had a Kradot Punch later. Yumm! The pineapple was sweet and smooth.\n\nAll the dishes here are family style. We started with the Pretty Hot Wings. Wowzas! They weren't as spicy hot as I expected, but had a spicy sweet and sour sauce, yet still crispy. These were a great way to start off the night.\n\nNext up were the Nam Tok Beans. So apparently I didn't read the menu well, because I was expecting green beans. So imagine my surprise when these come out as crispy Gordo Beans (which the menu did clearly state), served with lettuce similar to a lettuce wrap. But the minute I took a bite, my disappointment waned. They were SO good. Crispy, warm, a faint flavor of chili and soy. I'd definitely get these again.\n\nThe Yaowaraj Noodles were good, but probably my least fave of the night. Lots of textures between the noodle, chicken and veggies, but these were ever so slightly oily to me.\n\nAnd then the highlight of the evening ... Caramelized Pork Belly. Perfectly cooked, great crisp on the outside, and cooked in a sweet brown sauce in a clay pot. Honestly the most tender meat I've ever had! We opted for the sticky rice and poured the juice on it. Yummmm.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the Thai Tea Soft serve ice cream. It comes out super fast and has huge chunks of toasted coconut on top. Fab!! Such a refreshing way to end the night.\n\nOther things - they will not seat you without the entire party present. Kind of a drag since My friend was stuck in traffic, I desperately wanted to sit and have a drink after a long day of travel, and they wouldn't let me. If I wanted a drink, I'd have to drink it out in the hallway (Kin Khao is in a hotel). That wasn't too appealing to me. Another group was there, waiting on their 4th, and offered to even order for him, but the hostess shared that they were close to losing their reservation. It's family style dishes, so I don't get what the big deal is by letting 3 of the 4 sit!\n\nAlso, and this is a plus, they have complimentary postcards for you to choose from.

I will say, this is not your typical Thai restaurant that services a mean green curry or a limey tasty pad thai, rather, it is still a fusion inspired Thai restaurant that takes California ingredients and incorporates Thai cooking techniques and traditional foods into what is Kin Khao. I came here with family to show them the \"new\" (somehow, the years pass so quickly) places of San Francisco. \n\nFOOD: I would say to go for the tasting menu. Our group of four thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu and that it comes in family style (something that I thoroughly enjoy). From the delicious beef to the perfectly cooked rice to the crispness of the green beans, the food at Kin Khao was perfectly seasoned and presented in a home-y and elegant way. \n\nSERVICE: Overall, I thought the service was high, especially for a Michelin restaurant. Each dish was explained and presented well. One slight hiccup I saw was the pacing of the meal, where at first, the meal was paced very slowly, but later, picked up towards the end. Not too distracting, but it was something that I noticed. \n\nI would say this place was a 4.75 star for me with a little hiccup in the service.

Don't compare it to other SF Michelin restaurants because it won't feel like one. \n\nMushroom hor mok terrine (Curry mousse in-a-jar with mushrooms, crisp rice cakes) - Thai version of chips and dip. Rice crackers were crisp. Would've preferred them thinner because it was hard to fit the thick curry ingredients and the cracker in a bite. A little messy. \n\nKhun yai's rabbit green curry (Kiew Wan curry paste, coconut milk, rabbit leg + saddle, rabbit meatballs, apple eggplants, Thai basil) - Super spicy. The rabbit tasted exactly like chicken. \n\nMassaman nuea (Braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes) - Not spicy at all. Delicious, creamy, savory, and the beef literally melts in your mouth. No chewing needed. The potatoes were amazing too. \n\nKathoey Collins - Different from prior yelp pictures. This time, it has aloe vera liquer. Refreshing!\n\nCoedo Shiro Hefeweizen - Don't prefer beer but this was great. \n\nRiesling - Too sweet. Couldn't finish this. \n\nService - Incredible. I was initially upset because I asked for recommendations for non-spicy items and could barely touch the rabbit curry without crying and sweating from the spice. The manager noticed immediately and insisted another dish on the house. I'm thankful she did because the Massaman nuea became the best Thai dish I ever had that wasn't pad thai. They also gave me shots of condensed milk to alleviate my symptoms. \n\nInterior and ambience - One star. It does not look or have the setting of a Michelin restaurant at all. Very loud and people were yelling over each other to be heard. It was distracting from the food. The majority of the time, my husband and I communicated through text across the table. \n\nWait time - Reserved the day before and was seated 30 minutes early on a Friday night at 8:30PM.", "author": "Ee Vonn Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-06-26", "description": "Had high hopes for this supposedly affordable, Michelin, Thai restaurant. The issue? The prix fixe menu isn't really affordable when you consider what you are actually getting; it did not feel, taste nor deliver on a memorable experience like a Michelin should; and honestly, it's not even close to the best Thai place in SF. To top it all off, the service was subpar.\n\nAt $60 per person, the prix fixe menu is supposed to provide a wonderful, pre-set menu that is specifically curated and balanced in order to provide the best experience the restaurant can muster up at an affordable price, as you are giving up a little bit of freedom and make their life easier. Too bad Kin Khao treats this is a Michelin marketing gimmick. Not only is the prix fixe menu not a good value compared to their other offerings, but the actual food and experience is sub par, lackluster, and underwhelming. The dishes were not cohesive and even worse, the server was kind of just throwing them at the table, without much care for proper pacing, what made sense, and just either delivering them too fast or we had to wait forever, just based on when the kitchen was done making them and the server could be bothered to bring them, with no care for our dining experience. This has to be *the* worst Michelin restaurant experience I've ever had. More than that, it was disappointing even by average restaurant standards.\n\nWith the menu you get Tom Yum, Yum Polamai, Nam Tok Beans, Plah Pla Muek, Carmelized Pork Belly, Blistered Green Beans in XO Sauce, Massaman Nuea, and Thai Tea Soft Serve. We started the meal with a disappointment - the soup. It was just ok, without much flavor and even visually, the carrying tray had paint chipped off and wasn't entirely clean. It's one thing to go for rustic and modest but that's not the vibe we got. The salad had some strong flavors but it was simple, small and not memorable. The beans were so overcooked and tasteless that it just felt like eating pure fiber. The pork belly was delicious but not even in the top 10 best I've had. It's hard to mess up pork belly. We then received the squid we were supposed to get two dishes ago. It was too chewy and tasted a bit like rubber; most likely overcooked. The rice and green beans were OK-ish and decently flavored but came cold and imho, felt out of place during this part of the meal; you'd expect something that tastes a hell of a lot better than the complimentary green beans and rice you get at some restaurants, but this was just barely that. The beef curry was actually quite delicious and the strongest dish from the prix fixe. The soft serve? Well, let's just say I've had better from an average chain establishment for under $6.\n\nWe also ordered the Mushroom Terrine. Ironically, it was one of the better dishes we had that night.\n\nWe also got some drinks - the lemonade was OK and the Thai Iced Tea was watery and tasteless.\n\nTo top off the overpriced and underwhelming food experience, the service was horrendous. Our server didn't seem to care that we were there. She never checked on us, never made us feel like we were welcomed, didn't explain anything and mostly stayed in the corner doing her own thing. When one of us went to the restroom, we were a bit surprised to find out the restaurant doesn't even have one (they share it with the hotel in the same building). That didn't bother us as much as the fact that the server didn't even tell us we need a key to get in and the person had to come back for the key after going there and not being able to enter.\n\nOverall, to say we were disappointed is an understatement. Forget about Michelin standards and expectations; the food, service and atmosphere don't even warrant a positive comparison to an average restaurant. I can't even say \"expect to get what you pay for,\" because you honestly can get a whole heck of a lot more for $60pp at many other places in the city.\n\nI doubt I'll ever come back and I most certainly cannot in good conscious recommend this place to others when I know you can get much better Thai food, service, and overall experience at establishments like the Farmhouse Kitchen Thai Cuisine.", "author": "Mario B."}

Kin Khao is definitely one of the more affordable Michelin one-star restaurants that you'll find in SF for dinner, and it carries an informal but pleasant vibe. Finding it can be a bit of a pain, quite honestly, depending on which entrance to the Parc 55 you use. We just kept looking for signs and eventually stumbled upon it down this somewhat random hallway.\n\nThe restaurant was totally packed when we arrived, and it seemed a new walk-up party materialized every minute and a half. I would definitely get a reservation! We waited about 10 minutes for our table and then were taken in. \n\nThe restaurant smells like Bangkok (the nicer parts), legit. They encourage you to share everything family style, which we did only a bit due to my annoying fish allergy. On that note, they were SUPER accommodating and the server crossed out all the things on the menu that would set my throat to closing, which I greatly appreciated. This kind of consideration is a touch you should always find in a Michelin restaurant, and Kin Khao delivered. \nThey have a highly seasonal menu, but here are a few highlights:\n\n-Nam Tok Beans: These were interesting. I kept coming back to them, and I'm not quite sure why. They were crispy and I enjoyed the bit of spice introduced by the chili. Not sure if they prepared these in the traditional nam tok style with cow/pig blood, but in any case, they were good. 3.5\n\n-Hot Wings (sans fish sauce): Ok, so I'm not the type of guy to go to a proper restaurant and order wings, but if you get a Michelin nod and are bold enough to be a Thai place and call your dish \"Pretty Hot Wings,\" you are totally looking for people to order this dish. On the whole, I mean...they were hot wings. Cooked well, seasoned nicely, but I also could have made these at home. I didn't taste a hint of the sriracha and tamarind glaze that was supposedly on them. So these were just OK. A 3.\n\n-Gaeng Som Sour Curry: Definitely my favorite! I didn't have this curry when I was in Thailand a few months ago but enjoyed this vegetarian dish (it also has an egg). There is an \"omelette\" atop the tamarind broth...in short, excellent! Even after I was full, my hand kept finding its way to my spoon, which kept finding its way back to the bowl for more of the delicious crispy omelette and its friend, the chili broth. :-) 4.5 \n\nI'm vascillating between a 3 and a 4 for Kin Khao.

The meat was very tender but the curry itself was missing a bit of a tangy kick. \n\nAll in all, we had a great meal and the courses that stood out by far were the charred squid and pork belly, especially together.", "author": "Esther K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-26", "description": "The first thing I did when deciding what to do this weekend was search \"Most affordable Michelin Star restaurants in San Francisco\". Kin Khao was one of the very FEW options available. And though my wallet hated me less so than if I were to go to most other Michelin adorned spots, I felt like many other more affordable restaurants could deliver the same taste and quality as that of Kin Khao. So I guess we really paid the above-average price of Thai Food just to say \"WE JUST ATE MICHELIN QUALITY FOOD.\" Nonetheless, the experience was seamless and I can definitely tell why this place deserves a Michelin star.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine 5/5\n- this is so yummy the curry sauce is absolutely perfect. The sauce is very rich but not overly heavy, and the mushrooms inside give it such a nice texture\n- the rice crisps serviced with it are really fun to eat as well. Ahhh the flavour and texture of this dish was just so much fun\n\nNam Tok Beans 5/5\n- be careful with this one because I can definitely see why some people don't like it BUT I LOVE IT\n- the beans are crispy and soft at the same time... like how is that even possible\n- the seasoning is very nice too! Think lime juice and a thai twist on cajun seasoning.\n\nChicken Fat Rice 3.5/5\n- broth comes in the coolest bowl ever. imagine a bath tub water slide shaped like a bowl.\n- chicken came in generous portion\n- lots of rice\n- very subtle flavours - nothing SUPER special about this dish but the sauce was VERY good. salty and savoury\n\nYaowaraj Noodle with chicken 4.5/5\n- I liked how this noodle wasn't overly greasy\n- comes with green chili juice which gives a nice kick\n- very flavourly and not overly drowning in sauce or sodium\n- noodles are very soft and chewy, chicken wasn't overly dry. They were slightly charred too, which was pleasant for bringing out flavours \n- would have liked a little more meat/egg/veggie (personal preference) but the flavours were definitely there\n\nPork Bowl  4/5\n- braised pork belly was very well marinated, tender, but a little too sweet for my liking\n- this bowl is SUPER filling, my friends could barely finish\n- Pork Bowl is similar to a weird version of Ramen\n\nService was of course very great. The wait staff came by frequently to check up on us, clear dishes, and refill water. They offered to explain the menu too (which was definitely needed because I did not understand any of the dish names).\n\n\nIf you want authentic Thai food for value, I would suggest just going to any hole in the wall in Thai town. But if you want good service, a casual atmosphere, and the chance to check off eating Michelin grade food in the heart of SF, Kin Khao is your best bang for your buck :)\n\nTHANKS KIN KHAO!", "author": "Monica X."}

We were pretty excited given our love for Thai food and the fact that this is one of the more affordable Michelin starred restaurants!  \n\nThe menu had a decent number of items, especially since the dishes are meant to be shared, and we eventually settled on the rabbit green curry & yaowarag noodle! We also ordered a side of sticky rice for our curry and a \"Tom Yum\" (not a soup, but a cocktail)! \n\nThe rabbit green curry had a wonderful flavor and was not overwhelmingly spicy. The meat was very tender and the meatballs were very flavorful. On top of that, this portion was enormous- though that might also be due to the large bowl of sticky rice we ordered. \n\nThe yaowarag noodle was very tasty as well. Don't forget about the sauce on the side, I feel like that was the one thing that really stood out and made this dish memorable!\n\nAs for the drink, it tasted good but honestly I felt like I was just drinking juice. \n\nOverall, I would come back again but with more people next time so I can try more items!!", "author": "Janice L."}

But if you're up for the challenge, get ready for a delicious journey!\n\nComing in for dinner, we started with an appetizer of the mushroom hor mok terrine, a lovely curry mousse with mushrooms served in a jar alongside crispy rice cakes. We also had the khao kan jin, a savory blood sausage (steamed in banana leaf) and mixed with garlic chips, shallots, cilantro, and lime. The khao yum, or rice salad, wasn't particularly memorable, but the plah pla muek, or little charred Monterey Bay Squid in a spicy-sour fish-sauce with plenty of chili, peanuts, and cilantro, was tender and super intense in flavor!\n\nThen came our entrees, which were served with brown rice and sticky rice. My favorite was the rabbit green curry, which came with extremely tender, fall-apart pieces of rabbit leg/saddle as well as rabbit meatballs, swimming in a light, coconut-based curry broth that's a lot spicier than it looks! We also had the namprik long rua (\"Boat Trip Relish\"), which was an umami bomb! It was a mixture of shrimp paste, little cubes of caramelized pork belly, and crispy catfish, served alongside raw vegetables. This was definitely a dish that needed rice with every bite--just a little dab of the paste went a long way in terms of flavor!\n\nBy the end of our meal, I was sweating profusely.

It's nice and sweet and the meat is sooooo tender. Melts in your mouth.\n\nKhao Kan Jin: The street food classic here, made in a banana leaf. It wasn't bad, but kind of bland in my opinion. There was some flavor in it, can't say what exactly, but I didn't care for it. \n\nMassaman Nuea: Beef cheek curry. Good flavor, and goes decently with sticky rice!\n\nKhun Yai's Rabbit Green Curry: Definitely not enough meat on one rabbit leg, and the dish didn't have that nice strong flavor i'm used to with curries. It was just kind of alright. \n\nThey did't have their famous hot wings, which we were all bummed to find out, but we did also get this one chicken lettuce wrap dish that I enjoyed b/c of the accompanying citrus sauce. \n\nOverall the restaurant is nice, the food is ok and the people are helpful, but I've had much better Thai food at places that were much less expensive. \n\nStay Cheerful ;)", "author": "Garen A."}

We were seated immediately upon my friend finding the entrance -- it's weirdly hard to find despite the name being emblazoned upon a pillar on a busy street corner.\n\nThe atmosphere was best described as chill. It really felt like any other trendy, casual Thai restaurant, despite the international acclaim its kitchen had garnered. Think Osha, but a little less busy in terms of the decor. As a casual, chill kinda dude, I loved it.\n\nAfter much deliberation, we decided to order the nam tok beans, pork belly, and yaowaraj noodles, a balanced mix of carbs, meat, and veggies. We grabbed a pair of drinks too, whose name I unfortunately forgot (and cocktails aren't on the online menu for some reason). The taste was pretty tough to forget though, it was fruity and cinnamony with a tinge of booziness. It reminded me of the end of summer and beginning of fall, as pretentious as that sounds. All the drinks on the menu seemed good, so you'd be hard-pressed to go wrong.\n\nAfter ten minutes or so, our first dish came out...and it was wings? We sent it away, having not ordered any, but we did both agree that it looked fabulous. The waiter brought it back, having misheard me (not hard to do), and gave it to us on the house. Nice! They were possibly the best wings I've ever had, just spicy enough for it to be noticed, and absolutely bursting with flavor. The breading was soaked with the sauce, and both it and the actual meat were delectable. Absolute must if you go!\n\nNext out was the yaowaraj noodles. They were also excellent, a little sweet, very savory, and a tinge salty. The rice noodles themselves were perfectly cooked, as was the chicken, but the latter was in such small bits I had trouble individually noticing them among the tasty noods. Ah well, the ensemble was wonderful, and that's what matters isn't it?\n\nBefore we had killed off the yaowaraj, the pork belly and its associated sticky rice came out in a delightfully fitting pig-topped cast iron pot. When I reached in with my chopsticks to grab a slice, I didn't really feel anything because the meat was so tender! It was a good start for sure, but the actual taste was...a little lacking. It was meaty and moist and tender, but that's about it. I didn't get the burst of flavor I was sort of expecting. The rice was a letdown too; it was sticky, sure, but it was simultaneously a little dry and overall not great.\n\nBut after this dip, the beans came out and after two or three lettuce wraps of them, the pork was forgiven. I didn't think of beans as being a very Thai food, but these really worked. They were a lil spicy and each one bursted with savory in my mouth. The lime, chili, and cilantro lent it an almost South American flavor, while the other ingredients brought it back to Southeast Asia, but with a twist. Also highly recommended!\n\nI decided to spring for the Thai Tea Soft Serve with rum float, and while the ice cream and its topping tasted just like sweet, creamy Thai tea, the rum was confusing. It totally overpowered the ice cream flavor and ended up being a weirdly-textured, rummy soup. The rum itself was good, though! Just...get it on the side instead.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience at Kin Khao. The wings, beans, noodles, and cocktails were truly an experience worth having, and at ~$65 each, it wasn't too terribly expensive for a Michelin-starred restaurant in SF. The rum ice cream float and pork belly were very underwhelming, though. Had we skipped those and saved a buck or two, this'd be five stars for sure!", "author": "Shawn W."}

I went with a colleague for lunch and arrived about 5 minutes before opening.  There was already a few other people waiting for the restaurant to open.  We were sat promptly when it opened.  We ordered the chicken wings and the green papaya salad as appetizers.  The wings were cooked very well.  Very crispy in spite of the sauce that was on them.  I expected them to be a little more spicy since they were called the \"Pretty Spicy Wings\" but they were delicious none the less.  Papaya salad was on point as well.  For the main course we shared the Yaowaraj Noodles which were a bit similar to Pad See Ew and they were very tasty.  Great flavor profile and the chicken was of a great quality.  We also had the Khao Mun Gai.  The quality was fantastic and the chicken was cooked very well and stayed quite moist but the dish was a bit bland for me.\n\nOverall we had a wonderful lunch.

It's the only time they offer KHAO SOI. It's a chicken curry-based broth noodle soup, but is flavored in a way where it doesn't feel heavy at all. The added crunch from the egg noodles definitely help. Probably the best Khao Soi I've had to-date.\n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine -- I've had the terrine twice now, & it was oddly better the second time. I felt like there was more of a tom yum flavor & mushrooms to balance out the richness of the dish. Would order again if I was with a group of people.\n\nKhao Mun Gai -- Enjoyed the meaty chicken in the dish but thought the broth was on the saltier side.\n\nThai Iced Tea -- First time I ordered it was on the sweeter side, but second time I ordered it was perfectly sweetened.\n\nPad Kee Mao -- Love flat noodles, so had to get it. Dish was good, but nothing super memorable.\n\nYaowaraj Noodle -- Nothing really stood out about this dish for me either. But I probably would recommend the Pad Kee Mao over this, if available.\n\nPretty Hot Wings -- A little on the sour side for my taste, but enjoyed the crispiness of the wings. Wouldn't order again.\n\nMassaman Nuea -- Dinner only. Braised beef cheeks were SUPER tender, but the dish just didn't come together for me.\n\nReservations are easy to make online via Resy.

Maybe it was my bad for expecting a hearty Thai meal, but what we got was fancy Thai fusion. We ordered the \"Massaman Nuea\" braised beef cheek ($35). It was delicious and very tender, but the portion size was tiny. Not to mention we had to spend an extra $4 each on scoops of white rice. Come on!! RICE, tho??

I'm glad I finally experienced this SF Thai staple.\n\nMy weekend lunch here was very pleasant - I didn't experience any of the service issues that other reviewers mentioned, but it also wasn't too crowded. The food came out quickly as well.\n\nNam Tok Beans - This reminded me of larb lettuce wraps, but with beans instead of meat. Good chili heat and plenty of lime brightness, though a tad salty.\n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine - I'm a fiend for mushrooms, and this dish did not let me down! The mushroom mousse was extra creamy and intended to be spread on top of crunchy rice cakes. While I liked this contrast, I loved just eating the decadent mousse by itself - so much great umami.\n\nFive-Spice Duck Noodle Soup - I took some leftovers home, and the broth was solid at fridge temp. That's some gelatinous goodness right there! The five-spice was just the right amount of bitter. I also like the rice noodles, which were flat like chow fun, but broth was the star by far. Paired with the chili paste on the side, this hit all the flavor notes for me.\n\nKhao Soi - Omg these egg noodles were the perfect texture - extra springy, with great chew. The coconut curry broth was delicious, with a nice amount of heat, and had great kaffir lime flavor.\n\nCold Brew Thai Iced Coffee - They can do condensed milk on the side.

Actually pretty disappointing for a 1-Star Michelin restaurant.\nThe dishes were supposed to be authentic and family-style. I've never been to Thailand, so cannot tell what is truly authentic. But I've tasted way better ones at some random street food shops in Indonesia.\n\nThe blue flower limeade was the only one I would rate for a 5 star. The syrup on the bottom was fragrant, fruity and delicate, while the limeade on top was pretty strong and pungent. Mixing them together was like a firework booming on the tongue. It was a very good start and set a high bar. Alas. Too early and too bad.\n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine. Interesting combination of something smooth and something crispy. My only concern was that the \"curry mousse\" tasted like Nacho cheese flavored Doritos.\n\nSaeng-Wah Salad. Very spicy and salty. Be careful when you bite the little red chili rings!\n\nPad Kee Mao. If every meal must have its ups and downs, this is the very bottom. Too salty, and too oily. Worse than the stir fried rice noodles you would find at any Chinese restaurant.\n\nMassaman Nuea. Even more salty than Pad Kee Mao! How could you manage to take so much salt within one meal! Didn't find the slightest hint of coconut milk in it, although it said so on the menu. All the flavors were hiding away from me except for the salt! \nBeef and potatoes were a classic combination in any curry or beef stew dishes, but the potatoes here were like they didn't belong here. Bland and flavorless. How come the potatoes remain so arrogant in such a salty salty salty bowl? Was it on purpose because my tongue could take a break?\nEven the Jasmine rice could not save the beef curry. Growing up eating rice almost everyday, I had expected more for a 1-star rice.\n\nFinally the famous black rice pudding. Would've been great if the pudding was cold. Fresh strawberries mixed with hot pudding? Not a big fan of this idea. And salt! What was salt doing here again? A slight hint of salt would add extra layers to desserts, yes, but this was way too salty!\n\nIts been 4 hours since I left the restaurant, and I am still drinking water.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-26", "description": "I don't like curry or spicy food... but this was quite amazing!  \n\nVenue / Service: probably one of the most relaxed Michelin Star restaurants I've been to and greatly appreciate it for that - it definitely isn't as stiff / stuffy as a few other places!  The best way to describe the vibe is a slightly-more-upscale-yet-popular-and-therefore-crowded-Thai fusion joint.  It is much more crowded than I expected so be mindful if you have large shopping bags or such; it'll get tight.  Service-wise, the waiters were very helpful in recommending dishes and were quite quick... food came out much quicker than expected from a busy kitchen! \n\nFood: don't expect usual Thai dishes you see from take-out places; these dishes will seem quite unique to those (including myself) who don't eat a lot of Thai.  Also be prepared for lot of spices and curries (probably shouldn't come here if you are not fans of either).  \n-- Khao Kan Jin (Banana leaf-wrapped steamed pork+rice+blood sausage, garlic chips, fried + raw shallots, cilantro, lime)($15) - one of our favorites of the evening!  I usually don't like blood sausage, but the texture/flavor of the sausage with pork and rice alleviated that strong blood sausage flavor that I'm not a fan of.  It also helped to have the shallots, garlic, cilantro and lime to brighten up the dish so the sausage doesn't feel heavy in your stomach.  The banana leaf adds a great aroma to the sausage to get rid of that pungent blood scent too.\n\n-- Caramelized Pork Belly (Sweet, savory, voluptuous pork belly cooked in a clay pot)($22) - I usually am hesitant about pork belly because the fat is either too gristly and hard or turns into mush in my mouth, but this one was right in the middle.  The pork belly didn't completely fall apart when I picked it up with chopsticks or when I bit into it, but was still soft to chew.  Pork belly itself was greatly seasoned and was very savory.  A bit on the heavier side, so be mindful of what else you order. \n\n-- Dungeness Crab & Betel Leaf Curry (Spicy, tangy Southern curry with dungeness crab meat and betel leaves, sen mee rice noodles)($55) - if you want spicy, this is spicy.  Less crab than we hoped (but that's because we LOVE dungeness) and they give you a side of rice noodles to somewhat alleviate the spice level of the curry.  Curry was well rounded; it's just that I can't handle a lot of spice.  Must-try for spice lovers, otherwise I'd reconsider it.\n\n-- Massaman Nuea (Braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes)($35) - hands down our favorite dish of the night.  The Massaman curry wasn't very spicy (perhaps because we had the crab curry right beforehand, see above), and has a pleasantly sweet aftertaste, probably from the coconut milk.  Beef cheeks were so tender and flaked away nicely when you cut into them.  I would highly recommend this dish for everyone.\n\nAll in all, this would be at the top of my list of favorite Michelins, for its somewhat laid-back vibe and excellent food- they turned this non-curry/spice lover into one (or at least got her interested in them).

So let's get everything straight first:\n\n1. Their service is HORRIBLE.  We were seated for TWENTY MINUTES before ANYONE came by to say anything at all.  After we ordered drinks, you guessed it, ANOTHER TWENTY MINUTES before we had any of our cocktails or beer.  So yeah, FORTY MINUTES and our table was still void of any food.\n\n2. The decor isn't fancy.  The staff ain't dressed anything fancy.  You looking for your sommelier???--you kidding right?  You'd be lucky if the staff even knows the names of their cocktails (ours had to look one up.)\n\n3. This IS NOT fancy food.  There are no expensive ingredients.  This is perfectly made home-style Thai food, and nothing more.  Nothing unique.  Just supremely well made.\n\nSo, why did Michelin give a star to this place!?--who the F knows???  Clearly Michelin doesn't care about their brand anymore.  These stars are meaningless.  We went to Chez TJ a few months ago, who also earned one star, and really, several stratospheres separate the experience between these two places.\n\nAlright, given that, just ignore the whole Michelin bullcrap, why did I give 5 stars even despite the ridiculous service?... Cause the food is some of the most perfectly made home-style Thai food (with a couple exceptions) that I have ever had the pleasure of having in America...\n\n1. Tom Yum \"Not The Soup With Shrimp\" $13 \"Tanqueray gin, Lo-Fi vermouth, galangal, lemongrass, angostura bitters, makrut leaf\":  Ingredients sound rad don't they?  Well, I can't say the finished product tastes much different than a standard citrus cocktail.  5/10\n\n2. Hua Hin Beach \"Comes With An Umbrella\" $13 \"Denizen 8 year rum, coconut cream, lime, chocolate stout, salt, kaffir lime\":  I was really looking forward to this--rum and stout!?  Well, miraculously it does work together in the oddest way.  I guess maybe sorta like a chocolate rum cake?  Glad I ordered this.  8/10\n\n3. Khao Kan Jin $15 \"Pim's favorite Chiang Mai street food, pork+rice+blood sausage steamed in banana leaf, garlic chips, fried & raw shallots, cilantro, lime\":  Well this was different.  It's like a hybrid of Chinese zongzi + German blood sausage.  Has a chewy texture.  I liked it.  Not all that fancy though, but as with most their dishes, everything was perfectly cooked and clean as F.  7/10\n\n4. Som Tum Papaya Salad $10 \"spicy chili+lime+fish sauce dressing, green beans, cherry tomatoes, dried shrimp, peanuts\":  Honestly, does not taste that much different than papaya salad anywhere else.  A bit expensive for what it is.  6/10\n\n5. Nam Tok Beans $14 \"rancho gordo ayacote negro beans, tossed isaan-style with lime, chili, rice powder, light soy, shallots, herbs\":  I think I'd give the title \"World's Most Delicate Beans.\"  Pretty much the fanciest and most delicately cooked beans I've ever seen.  The large beans had a sublime texture of the perfect firmness and starchiness.  Each ones was coated with a sandy mix of flavorings.  Beauty in simplicity exemplified.  9/10\n\n6. Khao Mun Gai $17 \"chicken fat rice (yes, that's what we said), ginger-poached chicken, served wiht Pim's secret sauce & a cup of chicken broth\":  This would be the biggest disappointment.  It's basically Chinese Hainan Chicken, with the only difference being they use long-grain rice, and instead of the onion oil and ginger sauce they have a brown Thai-style sauce.  But really, it's pretty much the same thing.  And honestly, most of the Hainan Chicken I've had over the last couple decades is better than this.  #1, their chicken is REALLY BLAND.  The sauce is mandatory.  #2, some of the chicken is pretty dry.  That's a bigass NO NO NO NO NO for Hainan chicken.  Kills it.  Anyway, I'd skip this if you're spoiled (apparently) by eating Chinese food.  Also, I must note, my friend ordered the same thing but her plate was far prettier than ours--totally inconsistent.  3/10\n\n7. Kanom Jeen Nam Prik $21 \"rice noodles with a sweet, sour, & salty coconut shrimp sauce, served with poached & fried vegetables & a soft boiled egg\":  Epic-ly flavored.  Just too much going on here to describe adequately.  It's slimy.  It coats your mouth and throat with flavors.  Nutso sauce.  Unfortunately, we just can't get over the mushy noodles.  (My friend next to me, who ate this throughout her childhood, said it's supposed to be that way.)  F that.  There are better ways to cook noodles.  6/10\n\n8. White Jasmine Rice $4:  Yes, Four Bucks for white rice.\n\n9. Black Rice Pudding $11:  This is interesting.  The rice pudding reminds me of Chinese red bean dessert soup.  Slimy with some bean texture.  This would probably be the only fusion dish here--they serve it with caramel sauce!, crunchy toppings, and this crazy coconut white sauce that is super salty!--and I LOVED that white sauce!  Pretty simple stuff, but I liked it.  7/10\n\nAs they say............ It Is What It Is.\n\n5/5\n\n#thai #sanfrancisco #michelinstar", "author": "Dean C."}

I usually just opt for the pad thai or the pad see ew wherever I go--I never really get too adventurous with it\n\nI needed to find a restaurant for a graduation celebration, and the person being celebrated loves Thai, so I did a Yelp search of Thai food in SF, and this was at the very top of the list. Kin Khao: a Michelin star Thai restaurant located inside of the Parc 55 Hotel. YES. And so I went online and made a reservation for 9 PM on a Saturday (I had booked about three days prior to the night, so only the later nighttime slots were available)\n\nWe got there a little early and let the woman working at the front know that we had arrived. She told us she'd do her best to get us seated as soon as possible. A short while later, we were taken to our table. The inside of the restaurant has an intimate feel to it. It's kinda dark (if you're eating for the Insta and need dat A1 lighting, you might have a little trouble getting that shot). Shortly after being seated, a waiter came by to ask for our orders\n\nThe noms:\n- Mushroom hor mok terrine: This is curry mousse in a jar with mushrooms. It's served with crisp rice cakes. OH MY GOODNESS. HIGHLIGHT OF THE MEAL. This was the first thing that came out. AHHH. The curry was oh so rich and creamy. It had that nice, strong coconut taste (not to the point of being overpowering. The mushrooms are what make this dish. The rice cakes were crisp and thiccccccc. Not yo average Quaker brand lightly salted rice cakes\n\n- Yum Yai salad: This is a Thai-style tumeric rice salad with herbs, vegetables, crispy shallots, and tamarind+black sesame sauce. There was A LOT going on. Not gonna lie, I was a little confused by this dish. It was fresh and had a variety of cooked and raw vegetables. The presentation was nice too. It came topped with edible flowers. It kinda reminded me of a jungle?? IDK. The dressing was unique and zesty!! This was my least favorite item of the three things we ordered\n\n- Pad kee mao (vegan version): This is spicy stir-fried drunken noodles, typically served with ground pork, rice noodles, garlic, bird's eye chili, onions, bell peppers, and holy basil. We got the vegan version made with Hodo Soy tofu instead of ground pork. This was really good!! Hodo Soy Beanery is the company that makes the tofu for sofritas at Chipotle. The tofu used in place of ground pork was kinda reminiscent of that...just double the price. Hahaha...nonetheless, delicious and full of flavor. It had a strange (not in a bad way) texture that left me feeling satisfied. I'm extremely picky with things that try to imitate meat, and overall, I don't really have any complaints about the tofu/meat substitute used in this\n\nI asked for hot sauce and was given three options: sriracha (not the sriracha we all know and love but instead a glass bottle with something written on it in Thai...so maybe it's fake...either that or it's even more authentic than the \"real thing\"), chili powder, and fish sauce with chili powder. I opted for the sriracha and doused everything I consumed in globs of this red sauce that was more sweet than it was spicy (but I have a kinda high spice tolerance so make of it what you will)\n\nBottom line: Not terrible pricing for a Michelin star restaurant. I think the meal would've been better had we ordered things with meat, as there weren't too many vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian friendly options on the dinner menu. Again, Thai isn't my favorite type of food, but I thought this meal was enjoyable!! This place is worth checking out!!", "author": "Kithumini J."}

We came here for lunch and enjoyed the fast service and food.\n\nBased on recommendations, we ordered Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine ($14), which is a very tasty mushroom mousse in a jar that you smear over 6 rice crispy squares (see pics). The mousse was amazingly savory and a rich blend which reminded me of curry. The rice cakes were a bit too dry and thick, but otherwise not bad.\n\nThe crispy chicken sandwich (15) is amazing. Think sriracha aioli and a large juicy slab of fried chicken on a nicely toasted white bread. So thrilled that the chicken was not dry.\n\nThe khao mun gai (19) is like haianese chicken but with a different sauce. Nothing too special here. Of note, both of us were very hungry and these 3 dishes were more than enough to fill us up. \n\nTake a look at the pictures!", "author": "Andrew Z."}

I was asked if I had a reservation to which I answered no, and then I was seated in the corner and handed a menu. I already knew what I wanted so I waited for the waitress to come back, and then I ordered the kao soi with flat rice noodles and chicken. The flavor was really good and it was spicy without being too spicy and overpowering, but there was very little portion-wise. At the high price of $18 pre-tip pre-tax, I definitely expected more food. Quality was pretty good but some cuts of chicken were questionable. Noodles were perfectly chewy and flavor was enjoyable. \n\nSidenote: I just saw on Yelp that this place has a Michelin star?! I'm very surprised to hear that.

Pad Thai, Curry by the Color (Red, Green, Yellow), even the Tom Yum served in a fire pot is standard now. Kin Khao changes this direction, taking Thai food back to it roots and then bringing it back with a modern twist.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice is that the menu is much smaller than a typical Thai restaurant, focusing on an ever changing set of dishes.  My favorite were the Khao Kam Jin and Caramelized Pork Belly.  the Khao Kam Jin is a Pork+Rice+Blood Sausage served with garlic chips, shallots, cilantro and lime.  You break up the sausage and mix everything up and you get a treat that is rich, earthy, and rustic.  The caramelized pork belly was also really good.  Served sliced in a clay pot, the fatty, sweet, and tender slices are perfect over some white rice.  \n\nThe Pretty Hot Wings were more Pretty than Hot, although they do pack an initial kick, it goes away pretty fast.  They are quite tasty with a sweet zing, and fried perfectly. \n\nThe Massaman Nuea (curry) was good, but I've had better.  Same goes for the Yalwaraj Noodle, which is basically Chicken Pad See Ew.\n\nThere is a full bar with Thai themed cocktails.\n\nService was good but wait can a bit long as the place is on the smaller side.

Although reservations not required, I highly recommend it as there was a long wait for dinner on a weekday. \n\nParking is a little difficult as it is location downtown, so we were a little late to our reservation. Great service, we called in and they allowed us to be ~10mins late before they give our table up. Arrived on time and we were promptly seated.\n\nFew things that stuck out to me is the unique meat choices they have here (beef cheeks and rabbit are just two that I can think off my mind). For dinner, we decided on the braised beef cheek curry and pad kee mao. The braised beef cheek was super tender and pulls right off the bone. Flavor reminded me a lot more of beef stew rather than curry, but overall, I really enjoyed the dish. For the pad kee mao, the flavor was definitely bold and paired up correctly with the noodles, which were cooked perfectly (not overcooked or under). \n\nAlso got the chance to try the blue flower limeade, which was essentially lime juice, bubbly water and infused with the blue flower syrup. It was refreshing and a must try if you are a fan of the blue flower.\n\nTLDR; Would definitely recommend. Although Michelin recommended, place was fairly casual and I would at best, consider it an upscale Thai restaurant. Good food, great service. Good luck with parking :)", "author": "Jenny N."}

It's cozy so make sure you're okay rubbing elbows with other people. We ordered the spicy chicken wings as recommended by our server to share. I had the Khao Soi which is a Northern Thai style curry with coconut broth, chicken, egg noodles, and pickled mustard greens. I was warned this was extremely spicy. I asked for a side of chilies to make it just a tad more to my level. Overall the broth was delicious and definitely worthy of $18. Their lunch menu is easy to navigate and I've been told it contains their most authentic offerings. It's expensive so not a daily kind of meal but when it's time to treat yo-self, this is a place to do it. \n\nService was impeccable.

She seemed to just say everything on the menu is good. Could not really pinpoint one dish that stood out so I was not sure how well she really knew the menu. \nI ordered probably 6 dishes. 2 appetizers and 4 main dishes along with rice. For my family, it was not enough. I was the most excited for the mushroom appetizer and the rabbit curry. Both just didn't excite me as I ate it.

I had specifically asked her a few questions about the dish so I am not sure how she got it wrong. \nLastly, when the bill came. I noticed the wrong dish on the bill and I told her and she told me she had to correct it with the right dish and charge me for it....seriously ??

It's located on the second floor of the Parc 55 Hotel. Kind of hard to find but just keep following the signs!\n\nBe aware that their menu changes quite often. We wanted to order the pad kee mao and khao soi, but unfortunately they weren't serving either. We ended up ordering the Khao Kan Jin appetizer- blood sausage, pork, and rice wrapped up in a banana leaf. It definitely had unique flavors, but I was wasn't the biggest fan of the texture, and it was lukewarm.\n\nIf you get one thing here, make it the pork belly! Hands down the best pork belly of my life. Suuuuper rich and delicious, and so tender that it melts in your mouth. Absolutely the star of the show and I would recommend this to anyone! For the other main, we ordered the braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry. The portion was huge, and the beef cheeks are very tender. However, there was something funky about the flavor of the curry...I couldn't put my finger on it but I did not love the sauce. Also, the sticky rice was very hard, and I wish we had ordered white rice instead.\n\nWe ended the meal on a high note with the black rice pudding. I loved this dessert, especially since I've never had anything like it before. It came with caramel sauce, coconut sauce, and some crunchy toppings which made for an interesting texture with the softness of the rice. Very sweet and a great end to the meal!  \n\nOverall, the prices are pretty steep for Thai food, but understandable given the Michelin star.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-16", "description": "Have you ever thought about dining at a Michelin star restaurant for the first time, but hesitated because of the cost? Or maybe you've always wanted to take your significant other to the fanciest Thai restaurant in San Francisco, but you aren't sure that it will be worth it? Thanks to my uncle, I have the best place that will neither cut too deeply into your savings nor fill your stomach with regrets: Kin Khao. Listed in San Francisco's 2017 Michelin guide (https://sf.eater.com/maps/michelin-stars-san-francisco-bay-area-2017-map), Kin Khao is an exquisite adventure into modern Thai dining. This restaurant will leave you breathless and begging for more.\n\nKin Khao is located on the intersection of Ellis and Mason Street within SF's Tenderloin neighborhood. If you plan on coming, keep in mind several things. First off, the restaurant is inside the Hilton Parc 55 Hotel; you should be able to spot Kin Khao at the corner of the building (follow the signs). Consequently, this place uses hotel restrooms that are found down the hall outside (need to ask for key-card). Second, I HIGHLY suggest taking public transportation because traffic gets really bad here + parking is limited. There's valet but do you really want to pay $$$? Besides, Powell BART is RIGHT THERE! Third, check your surroundings because the Tenderloin can get sketchy at night. And fourth, make a reservation because lines get long. But note that you'll have to reserve via Resy (http://kinkhao.com/) because their phone doesn't really work. \n\nKin Khao's menu is quite small (one page with food on front, drinks on back), but the key is diversity and creativity. This restaurant won't have western obsessions such as Pad Thai; instead, it blends modern and traditional into dishes like their Plah Pla Muek. Cost isn't extraordinarily outrageous, but you will be paying ~$100 for 4+ dishes. NOTE: They also have $60 multi-course specials. I was fortunate enough to have sampled most of the menu, and so here's my take:\n\n-MUSHROOM HOR MOK TERRINE (10/10): I found that the crispy rice cakes dipped in such a savory, creamy curry sauce made the PERFECT snack to start a culinary adventure. \n\n-NAM TOK BEANS (10/10): This dish is essentially a plate of beans on top of a bed of herbs and lettuce - all infused with a lime-chili sauce. If you love finger foods, you'll ADORE this. It's best enjoyed by wrapping the beans with lettuce. \n\n-CARAMELIZED PORK BELLY (10/10): Juiciest and most caramelized pork I've ever had. You only get four pieces, but each one literally melts with the slightest touch. \n\n-PAD KEE MAO (10/10): Why get \"usual\" drunken noodles at a Michelin restaurant? Because this was the best-tasting Pad Kee Mao EVER. Contrary to what the menu says, it's not spicy.\n\n-PLAH PLA MUEK (7/10): My uncle and co. LOVED this dish but I only thought it was slightly above average. Squid was really chewy, but the sauce was too sour for my liking.\n\n-WILD BOAR LAAB KUA (5/10): After trying Pok Pok's Boar in Portland (https://www.yelp.com/biz/pok-pok-portland), I was STOKED for Kin Khao's version. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Just like the Nam Tok, you eat the boar with lettuce and herbs. But, meat was underwhelming and there were too many pieces of garlic/shallot. Beware though, dish can get hot. \n\n-RABBIT GREEN CURRY (10/10): HANDS DOWN BAR NONE BEST DISH! Green curry was DELICIOUS and the rabbit meat was amazing (definitely like chicken). First time trying rabbit for me, but won't be the last. \n\n-SALTED DUCK EGG (6/10): They suggest you add this to compliment any meal, but I don't think it's that necessary; most dishes already have enough salt/flavor.\n\n-TAPIOCA DESSERT (4/10): This was a bit too heavy for me. Be warned because the dessert comes out warm. I did like that it had copious amounts of strawberry. \n\n-THAI TEA SOFT SERVE (7/10): Thai tea ice cream was great, but I thought the crispy flakes took away from the experience. Out of the two dessert options, I recommend this one.\n\n-ATMOSPHERE (10/10): Ambiance is VERY INTIMATE with the dimmed lighting, music is popping, and walls are decorated with bottles and lunch containers. What more can you ask for? Oh right, FREE POSTCARDS on their wall!\n\n-SERVICE (10/10): I thought that every employee at Kin Khao went above and beyond to provide us with the best service imaginable. They were extremely responsive, loved engaging in conversation, and even ranked each dish by spice level for us! I also loved the fact that they validated parking (with a small discount).\n\nIf there's two things in life I won't ever regret, it's 1. Meeting my girlfriend and 2. Trying Kin Khao for the first time. I had high expectations coming into this restaurant and most, if not all, were fulfilled. The food at Kin Khao is pretty amazing, service is top notch, atmosphere is memorable, and cost really isn't that bad. Ultimately, I give this place an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating! I will be back for my anniversary. \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

It offers an upscale take on Thai and Asian fare that takes advantage of the fresh, local ingredients we're lucky to have here in Northern California. \n\nThe caramelized pork belly, for example, takes what's already rich, savory fare and heats it up in a sweet glaze inside a clay pot. Heavenly, sweet, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. The sai ua sausage was also a tasty, if small, treat. The yaowaraj noodle (\"Bangkok Chinatown\" stir-fried noodles with chicken, XO sauce, egg, green onions, cilantro) was decently prepared and, pleasantly, not excessively greasy. A Thai coffee was a decent way to wash all the food down.\n\nService was friendly and efficient, and the venue is quite compact and casual, with all your utensils stored in canisters in front of you, and modest to long waits out in a hotel corridor if you don't have reservations.

He said that it, by itself, was worth the $40 ( uh.. meh, I just thought it tasted like chicken).\n-  I was looking for some kind of pad see ew, pad thai or something else that's noodle-y on their menu.

It was good, but at $20, we've had much better Thai noodles.\n\nThe MEH:\n- Our waiter lacked any interest in us that night. We didn't feel welcomed through and through. To top it off,  the check took forever to come and he just flopped our dessert menu in front of us sometime during the meal as we were talking. \n- They have a pre-fixe dinner menu for $60/person. The dishes were identical to the ones on the menu. We seriously considered this option and even did a little math to see if it was a good value. It wasn't. The waiter said you're getting a smaller version of what you would get if you just ordered the dish from the menu. The pre-fix is supposed to appeal to \"busy  travelers who only had a night in SF and wanted to try a bit of everything \". This makes sense, so just order the regular dishes and get more bang for your buck... This prefix is a total Michelin gimmick in my head.\n- Lack of bathroom inside the shop -- they share one with the hotel that they're attached to... however, you can't get in without a hotel key or hotel verification, which our waiter forgot to tell us. The front desk was empty at the time, so we had to wait a few minutes just to tailgate behind hotel people -__-\n- Lackluster dishes: rabbit curry, ($35+ $5 rice) pork blood rice appetizer ($15). I wouldn't recommend either of these dishes. The rabbit curry was excruciatingly spicy and liquidy/thin (authentic Thai curry though). Just don't get the pork blood rice appetizer. I love pork blood and all, but didn't understand this dish at all... it just tasted like bland sticky rice with the lime I squeezed onto it. \n\nIt's really hard to ruin a Thai restaurant experience for us, but my bf and I left very unsatisfied with the poor service and the expensive 'just okay' Thai dishes that night.", "author": "Vy T."}

Many people have told me that SF has pretty good Thai food, but I have yet to try anything amazing in this city so I came here with guarded expectations.  The atmosphere at Kin Khao is really nice: the decor is modern and lighting is really great (for food pictures and conversation).  We were seated very quickly but had also made a reservation.  Things we tried:\n\nPapaya Salad:\nPROS:\n- great quantity: huge plate and definitely shareable\n- fresh, definitely did not have that sat-in-the-fridge feel or flavor\n- healthy for sure\nCONS:\n- a tad bit salty.  I've had TART papaya salad, mostly because it's green and unripe papaya that is being used but this was really heavy handed with the salt content.  Either it's too much fish-sauce or salt.  \n\nPad Khao\nPROS: \n- not super greasy: sometimes the noodles end up sitting in a puddle of grease\n- not overly salty! Sometimes there is too much soy sauce or salt or sauce of whatever kind they use but this was a really nice balance\nCONS:\n- noodles were slightly overcooked and borderline mushy\n\nChicken Rice:\nPROS: \n- definitely shareable, good quantity of chicken and rice\n- it's not Hainanese chicken rice (so don't go into it thinking that's what it is because the sauce will disappoint you), but the chicken was well done and came out warm (for those of you who were wondering if it was cold chicken.\nCONS:\n- the chicken fat in the rice wasn't really there, tasted more like chicken stock rice.\n\nIt's not super amazing, and I've definitely had better in New York and Atlanta, but it's not bad either.

They take thai flavors and put a modern spin for a higher price. \n\nFOOD: \nTheir menu consists of thai appetizers, salads, noodles and curry. We ordered: \n+ Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine $14: This is a play on duck pate and foie gras. Instead, they use curry mousse and mushroom spread on crispy rice cakes. We actually enjoyed this dish as the flavors were very strong and paired well together. The curry was a tad too spicy for us though. \n\n+ Pad Kee Mao $14: The dish came in a decent portion, but taste-wise, was mediocre. We both agreed we've had better pad kee maos at traditional thai places.  \n\n+ Spicy Pork Curry in a Jar w/ side of varied steamed veggies (I forgot the actually name): This dish was basically a side of steamed green veggies, fried pork skin and a jar of spicy ground pork mixed with curry. I honestly was not too impressed by this dish. The ground pork curry, again, was too spicy and oily. And the streamed veggies was just something I could have probably made at home. \n\nSERVICE: \nVery professional and friendly service. We could tell the servers really know the menu well because they suggested side pairings with some of our orders. \n\nAMBIANCE: \nThis restaurant is actually located inside the Hilton Hotel at the corner. The inside is very modern and hip, decorated with minimalist-ic thai decor. They can seat up to about a party of 10-12 people. \n\nVerdict: The only aspect we though was Michelin star worthy was probably the price.

Let me preface this by saying, the waitress did warn me. Upon ordering the two she said it was and I quote, \"a little spicy\". Being a fan of spicy foods I brushed it off, shrugged my shoulders and responded with, \"that's alright\". But man was she serious. I remember downing about  5 glasses of water after the heat settled in my mouth ready. Let it be known that Thai spicy is beyond normal spiciness. \n\nAll that aside, the squid was flavorful and unlike anything I've ever tried. It was tender, tangy, spicy, herby, flavorful and everything you'd enjoy. Or anything I'd enjoy in a dish. This was by far my favorite plate at this restaurant. The rabbit curry on the other hand was mild and had a different sense of curry that I wasn't quite accustomed to, it was good, it just wasn't curry. We originally ordered this thinking the rabbit would add a different element, but I think it was slightly bland. This option lacked the elements of a traditional curry.

Especially when places like Lotus of Siam has yet to receive a star.\n\nThe food:\n-Saeng-wah salad:  I'll start with the highlight of the meal.  This prawn cevice is a direct descendant of the Issan-style raw shrimp salad.  It hits the main flavors of lemongrass, lime, chilis, etc.  The addition of the crunchy bits and the different layers and textures really compliment the quality shrimp.  I could have done 2 more orders of this dish.\n\n-Nam Tok Beans:  I was really excited for this one because of all the previous reviews.  The ingredients listed were reminiscent of some of my favorite Thai dishes.  The only thing I tasted was the beans and some soy sauce.  I got none of the lime, mint, cilantro, shallot, chili flavors.  It was bland and was the dish that was touched the least.\n\n-Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine:  Great presentation.  Pretty good flavors.  The other standout dish that we received.  The rice cake was a really nice contrast to the curry.  We just wished there were more mushrooms.  \n\n-Yaowaraj Noodes:  They were good.  It wasn't anything special.  You can get the equivalent at Osha or Lao Table.\n\n-Rabbit Green Curry:  Again, this was good, but nothing that stands above other sit-down Thai service like Osha.  The thing that really bugs me is that it costs forty dollars and I still have to pay four more dollars for rice.  \n\n-Blue Flower Limeaid:  This was delicious, but at 6 dollars... whew.  \n\nThe rest:\nI came here once before possibly 10-ish years ago.  It was a Thai place, but it felt different now.  I'm guessing they either changed or did a refresh of the restaurant.  It did feel like a step up from before, which is refreshing since a lot of the places I've recently gone to after a long hiatus has been awful.\n\nThe restaurant had that \"we're trying very hard to make it look casual and rustic even though it was probably redesigned not too long ago\" feel.  I just feel like everyone is doing it.  It's fine.  I'm not dinging it.  But it didn't say to me, \"hey, you're gonna get some good Thai food here\".\n\nIf the rest of the dishes hit like the mushroom terrine and the salad, I would have enjoyed this place more.  Although reasonably priced for a Michelin starred restaurant, it was above average in price for a comparable meal at what I would consider an equivalent Thai establishment.", "author": "Samuel L."}

We were seated a few minutes after our arrival and quickly decided on apps/mains.\n\nWe shared the spicy chicken wings appetizer. This dish was solid! I was skeptical that the sriracha would be overpowering and not lend to complex flavors, but the sauce was fantastic and the chicken was cooked really well with crispy skin on the wing. \n\nFor mains, we ordered the crispy chicken sandwich and the pad kee mao. A bit of advice: I would not order the sandwich. It was a very run of the mill dish when we were expecting the chicken to be spiced well and to be dazzled by flavor. Others may enjoy this if you're just looking for fried chicken cooked well, but I expected more pop from a Kin Khao dish. \n\nThe pad kee mao on the other hand was outstanding! I've had pad kee mao from so many Thai spots and this one is easily my favorite due to the flavors, perfectly cooked noodles, and well-spiced ground pork. Pro-tip: Add some of the house-made chilli oil and squeeze some juice from the lime on top. This really elevated the dish!\n\nOverall I enjoyed the food at Kin Khao minus the sandwich :). Regarding service, it took us a while to have a waiter replace our plates with fresh ones before the main course came. We kept searching for a waiter to speak to and ask for new plates but they weren't super attentive despite the place not being packed/busy while we were there.\n\nI will definitely be back to try some more of their dishes :).", "author": "Sabina S."}

It was good, and I'd come back if I lived in the area, but I was not impressed in any way.   \n\nTo start, I ordered a rose tea and a papaya salad appetizer. The server forgot about my tea order, so that was unfortunate. The papaya salad appetizer tasted more \"interesting\" than \"good.\" It was pickled and crunchy, but also fishy. So if you think you might appreciate that particular flavor profile, go for it. It wasn't for me.\n\nThe lunch meals we had were the chicken rice and the drunken noodle with ground pork. The chicken rice was presented Chinese style - the chicken was bland but meant to be eaten with the very delicious and light chicken broth as well as the ginger rice. The meal was very good and healthy, but just kind of boring. The chicken was also a bit dry.  \n\nThe drunken noodle with ground pork was very good. Noodles were chewy but not too chewy; flavor was neither underwhelming or overwhelming; and the portion size was quite generous. I would go back for this dish. It was great.\n\nWe also got to try the Thai iced tea as well as the Thai iced coffee, both of which were very yummy.\n\nOverall, this seemed like your standard Thai restaurant.

It's hard to rate any thing that is truly new, inventive, loyal to traditional techniques (kind of), and bold.\n\nOn one hand, Kin Khao has dishes like green curry rabbit. It has a rich coconut base and a spicy aftertaste and the meat falls off the bone. You have to recalibrate your taste buds to adjust for how much flavor is packed into a dish that is sensual and not overpowering. \n\nAnd then you have pork belly which is softer than any pork or other meat you've tasted. The fat and meat is soft and light in comparison even to ootoro, an odd comparison because it's flavor masters the rich and delicate balance of sweet and savory. \n\nTo be honest, I failed in ordering drinks. I only had one and I did not ask for a pairing but I tasted the Thai old fashioned and it had ingredients I don't remember but it was new and the flavor tensions were balanced and it made me happy. \n\nThe best part of this meal is that you know Kin Khao does not waste money on frills or rococo. Your money is spent on the pleasant and knowledgeable wait staff. Its spent on the creative energy that goes into marrying Thai techniques and flavors with fresh local northern California ingredients. It's going to experimenting on pushing what cocktails can be when we disregard our western flavor shackles. \n\nYou'll hate Kin Khao if you love General Tsos chicken, plain cheese pizza, or refuse to stay in hostels.

It was really great quality, had a mellow ambiance and a great selection of cocktails.\n\nI started with the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine, which comes with curry mousse in-a-jar with mushrooms and you eat it on crispy rice cakes.  Great presentation and perfect textures.  It was very spicy and well-made.  Sadly, I couldn't finish it because it was too spicy for me.  I did have two rice cakes full of the mushroomey moussiness. \n\nI really wanted noodles, and realized that I couldn't get noodles unless they were spicy... so again, I decided to go against my normal \"stay away from spicy food\" and tried the Pad Kee Mao.  It's stir-fried drunken noodles with ground pork, rice noodles, garlic, Birds Eye chili, onions, bell peppers and holy basil.  Again, great presentation, great combination of textures with the chewy drunken noodles, the pork and the veggies.  This wasn't as spicy as the mushroom terrine, so I think if I only had this, I would've been fine.  But my taste buds were already pretty overwhelmed by the kick the mushroom terrine delivered just before this :P  The noodles were perfect!  Highly recommend this dish.\n\nCocktails: I had the Pattaka Shake - kind of a sour version of a Thai Iced Tea...

The place has a nice dim ambiance but gets rather noisy so keep that in mind. The space is small but they have some communal tables. \n\nThe menu consists of street food based options that you won't find typically at Thai restaurants in SF.

It's not too special.\n\nPad Kee Mao - Spicy stir fried drunken noodles with ground pork, rice noodles, garlic, birds eye chili, onions, bell peppers, holy basil. There's a vegetarian version made with hodo soy tofu. A pretty good deal given that it goes for $20 on the menu and it's a Michelin star restaurant. This is probably my favorite dish here! The flavor is great. It's not that spicy, and the texture of the tofu really feels like meat. I'm not a fan of how greasy it is though. \n\nMassaman Nuea - Braised beef cheeks in massaman curry, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes. This was a great choice and easy to share with another person. Portions are huge, and is not as spicy as the other curries. It runs for $35 and the curry choices are noticeably more expensive.\n\nA pretty good spot for those feeling more adventurous with Thai cuisine.

Truthfully, this restaurant deserves no more than 3.5 stars, and here's why:\n\nFirst, the ambiance seems cool at first, but this restaurant is LOUD. The area is small, with loud music, which forced every patron to essentially yell to be heard. Imagine this in a very crowded restaurant: super annoying.\n\nSecondly, what is with the host and wait staff? Rude, rude, rude. The hostess refused to seat us because on member of our party was less than ten minutes late. When she arrived, we notified the hostess who rudely rolled her eyes while sighing, \"finally.\" ?? Excuse me? What exactly were we keeping you from doing?\n\nWe were seated and promptly greeted by another round of rudeness from our waiter. As vegetarians, we simply asked to confirm that one of the items we were going to order would not contain any shrimp paste. The waiter felt it necessary to mansplain, \"Yes, vegetarian means no shrimp.\" Thank you, sir, I've been vegetarian for my entire life, but I'm SO glad you were able to explain to me what vegetarian means. Gold star for you!\n\nFor the rest of our time there, he came back and forth from our table, taking our drink and food order, but acting like it was the biggest nuisance in the world for us to ask him to do his job. I'm pretty sure he only lightened up when he realized we would be leaving.\n\nSo, why on earth would I rate this place four stars after all this rudeness? The food is excellent. The flavors are incredible, and each bite was an explosion of flavors you wouldn't once think to combine. Unfortunately, one of our items arrived super late, but the restaurant comped us for the delay, so that gave us some hope that maybe everyone at the restaurant was having a bad day.", "author": "Sejal D."}

We walked by this place and decided to give it a try since its a Michelin 1 star restaurant. Amazing service, tasty food, and overall a great experience. \n\n[The Restaurant/Service] \nWe were immediately attracted to this place from the great reviews and the busy crowd. We expected to have a long wait, since we had no reservation, but lucky for us, we opted for the bar seat and were seated immediately. Our server was mainly the bartender and he was fabulous. He checked in on us often and he gladly gave us recommendations, while answering any questions that we may have had. Atmosphere is classy casual, given its in the financial district vicinity so there are lots of individuals dressed in business attire. Interior decor is nice, dim lights make for a romantic easy going atmosphere as well. \n\n[The Food] \n\n-Drinks // Blue Flower Limeade // 6.00 // I thought that this was pretty refreshing. The presentation was on point. Pouring the blue flower mix and adding the sparkling water so that you can see the blue white gradient, then adding the lime juice made it turn a beautiful purple/pink color. \n\n-Entree // Rabbit Green Curry // 35.00 // My FAVORITE thing here! Love the spice development and the amount of meat inside was very generous. Absolutely delicious! \n\n-Entree // Wild Boar Laab Kua // 20.00 // This one was tasty, but I didn't appreciate it as much as the green curry. For 20.00 I just didn't feel that this one completely won me over. \n\n-Side // white jasmine rice // 4.00 // Not badly priced for getting a mini pot of rice. \n\n-Dessert // Thai tea soft serve // 11.00 // Not sure if this one was worth the 11.00 because it was tasty but not crazy amazing. They do however give a decent portion, so this is great if you are looking to share. \n\nOverall, the green curry was the winner for me. The food was tasty and the prices are understandable given the Michelin star, but the food just wasn't as impressive as I expected.

As with other Michelin star restaurants (Kin Khao holds 1), reservations are highly recommended. Located inside the Parc 55 hotel, the actual entrance to the restaurant is at the corner of Mason and Ellis but you can also enter through the hotel. If you need to use the restroom, you'll have to get a key card from the hostess and use the hotel lobby's restroom.\n\nOur group of 3 ordered: mushroom hor mok terrine, pork cracklings, massuman nuea, whole roasted rock fish and khao yum. For dessert, we chose both the black rice pudding and Thai soft serve. All of the dishes were flavorful, savory and appetizing, but I would say that the stand out dishes were the terrine, rock fish and the black rice pudding. The spice level was moderate and there was more emphasis on the mix of other flavors (tangy, sour, sweet) instead of just spicy.\n\nI knocked one star off because the service wasn't very friendly and our food came out slowly. I felt like we were left hanging a few times throughout our meal.

I've been looking forward to trying this eatery before I even got to the city. Beyond my expectations. And they were high since this is a Michelin star restaurant. \n\nWe couldn't decide what to order so we went for the price fixe menu. $60 per person. This place is not expensive considering the caliber of food and the service. They don't back down in flavour. It's in your face bold punch! I have to admit we though the menu was a tasting menu... and I think we were wrong. Very very big portions! \n\nI am giving all dishes 5/5!!\n\nTom yum - sour, spicy and delicious. The mushrooms were yummy. Great starter to whet your appetizer\n\nDirty girl tomatoes - wow. Perfectly ripe romas topped with peanuts and shallots swamped with lime fish sauce. I might make my own less tasty version at home (and then probably hate it..)\n\nNam Tok Beans - knowing nothing about this dish, I was thinking some version of stir fried green beans. Well whoops! Totally wrong. They are sooooo good. Think of deep fried peanuts.. that are more like edamame. Way better of course. \n\nCarmelized pork belly- described as voluptuous.. and sure was. A bit too fatty for my taste but the sauce is to die for! I may have triple dipped.. then swirled my sticky rice from the beans dish to soak up leftover sauce\n\nPlah Pla Muek - charred squid. Yum yum yum yum. I can't say anything more. Must order!\n\nwok charred Brussels sprouts with xo sauce - I was beyond full at this point but had to try it. Never thought of xo sauce in Thai food. Not Brussels.. but these were delicious. \n\nMassaman curry with beef cheeks - super tender beef that fell apart easily. Very rich and aromatic curry yummm\n\nSoft serve Thai ice tea with tapioca and condensed milk was the best way to end the meal. I can't even describe how good this was. Even if you're full, ORDER IT! \n\nI'm here for another couple nights and I'm already contemplating a return visit as there's 3 other things I really  want to try........ so tempted.", "author": "Patricia F."}

We sat at a large communal table at the edge. My friend sat at the head of the table. The serve came to her and asked her to sit closer to the table because she was blocking the road. I would just like to mention that she was already sitting very close to the table. The same occurred for my other friend. \n\nWithin five minutes of sitting down, the server asked us what we wanted to order. We weren't ready and asked them to come back later. When he returned a second time, we were finally ready. \n\nAs we were finishing dinner, and working on the final pieces of the food, a different serve asked if she could clear the plates away from us. We declined since we wanted to finish everything. Once we did finish, the servers cleared our table and started wiping the table. We were a bit shocked as we were still finishing up our cocktails. Then he proceeds to place down the dessert menu. We declined dessert since our cocktails were still a work in progress. Our check came, we paid and was working on finishing our water. Hostess from the front comes and starts collecting our glasses. \n\nI am extremely displeased with the lack of communication from the servers. The environment plays a huge part in the food, and this place did not set the right tone. \n\nNow for the food. \nTHREE STARS FOR THE FOOD \nWe order the rice cake with mushroom curry. The curry is very spicy but paired nicely with the crispy rice cake. We could taste chucks of mushroom. \n\nWe also ordered the beef cheek ($35). While the meat was very tender, and the vegetables were flavorful, I personally don't think it is worth the price. Lastly, the caramelized pork. For $22 you get four pieces of very tender, melt in your mouth pork. HOWEVER, the presentation was beyond basic. Arriving in a sizzle black container, there were four pieces sitting in a large container. No decor or additions, just pork. \n\nOverall, the food was decent but not mind-blowing.

We had three omnivores, a vegan, a vegetarian, and one guy with low tolerance for spiciness.  Overall service and food were good, but just not great.  So on behalf of our group, 3 stars.\n\nOur two vegetarians got the short end of the stick.  The puffed rice salad was really tiny and basically a scoop of rice over greens and a few veggies.  A vegetarian curry costs like $30 and looked like a dark, watery vegetable soup with carrots mostly (My Sons and Daughters fiasco redux?!).  On the plus side, both the vegetarian drunken noodles and mushroom terrine over rice cakes were well liked.\n\nFor the omnivores, the whole roasted rock fish had nice crispy skin, aromatic herbs, and solid dips.  Meat could have been more moist, but not bad.  Beef cheeks were probably our favorite - super tender and flavorful.  Next was green curry rabbit, which is like chicken.  Our least favorite were the chicken wings - crispy, seasoned, but on the skinny side.\n\nDesserts were 50/50.

They are salty, crunchy, spicy, tangy, and bit sweet. What more can you ask for?\n\nKhao Kin Jin - If I had to choose, and it's a hard choice, this maybe my favorite dish. The pork has a depth of flavor that I can only describe as an indescribable amazingness. This indescribable amazingness also is infused into the rice, +1 for banana leaf steaming technique. A great touch is the garlic chips which add a nice crunchy texture to the dish.  \n\nNamprik Long Rua - \"Not for Thai food beginners,\" as the menu warns. Oh man, is this jar of spicy fermented goodness amazing. A MUST order if you're adventurous or simply love strong fermented flavors. Thankfully it is served with refreshing mixed vegetables to help balance the whole dish. \n\nFive-Spice Duck Noodle Soup - A very solid noodle soup. The duck, broth, and noodles are cooked perfectly. Not only is the dish good, the presentation is on point with the gigantic piece of duck hanging out in the bowl. \n\nKin Khao does Thai food and it does Thai food extremely well. I must admit that Kin Khao is probably my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. The food, drink, service, and value are all working together. It's pretty remarkable that each dish had their unique \"umami-ness.\" I left with a huge smile on my face and the feeling that I got more than my moneys' worth. \n\nThere's hard to find any faults with Kin Khao, however if I had to nitpick, the only fault would be it's location. Kin Khao is nestled inside the lobby level of the Hilton Parc 55 hotel. I can only venture to guess why they chose that particular location, but it does diminish the entire experience a little.

Tables were set up with utensils in a cup and dishes were served in traditional Thai metalwear you would see in the streets of Thailand. So let's get started...\n\nWe started out with the blueflower limeade, a fun refreshing twist to the traditional blue pea flower drink. It was lightly carbonated with the perfect sweet and tart combination. \n\nThe first appetizer was the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine, which was fragrant, creamy and delicious. Top it on the crispy rice cake and mmm... But personally I would have preferred some warm chewy, flakey and buttery nan/flour pancake (I know wrong cuisine) to go with it texture-wise. Nonetheless it was still really good. \n\nNext came the Som Tum Papaya Salad and this was like no other papaya salad I've ever eaten (disclaimer I haven't had a lot of papaya salad but...) The flavors worked in harmony and work perfectly on my palate. The crispy roasted peanuts were so fragrant that it resembled sesame oil. The papaya was crisp and fresh. The dressing had the right balance of acidity and hit the perfect notes of savory. This was one of my favorites. The lady said it was the spiciest appetitzer but it didn't even hit my spicy radar... Lol\n\nOut came the Pad Kee Mao and everyone at the table was enchanted by the (wok hey) tickling our nostrils. Very good aromatic heat in this dish and delicious. \n\nKhao Soi was the reason we came. A rich, complex, flavorful broth that is not heavy and packs a kick. My husbands nose was running and father in law was sweating... Lol this dish is spicy in all the good ways, heat that subtle but strong and disperses quickly unlike ma la spice. The thick and chewy noodles paired perfectly with the soup, pickle veggies and crispy noodles. This was so good my mother in law drank all the soup. Unfortunately, for me it was a little too spicy. 3/4 people gave this dish 5 stars . \n\nKhao Mun Gai was so bland and underwhelming it should not be on the menu. The chicken was tender and flavorless and the rice was oily but not fragrant. The sauce was decent. All Hainan chickens I've eaten put this Khao Mun Gai to shame. (And I've eaten a lot of Hainan chicken)... Lol\n\nDespite being really full we decided to order dessert. Being part of a Malaysian-Chinese family we eat our fair share of Black Rice Pudding. This was not your average Black Rice Pudding. It came with a heavenly side of toasted coconut carmel, salted whipped coconut milk, and crispy brown rice puffs.

I'd probably avoid the cocktails next time as they were $13 a pop.\n\nThe food came shortly after. It was served family style. 8 courses. \n\nMushroom Hok Mok Terrine - Fun appetizer. Visually appealing. It was curry mousse with mushrooms served with rice cakes. However, the consistency was more liquid than mousse. It tasted very much like tom yum coconut milk soup, but more bland. \n\nYum Som-O - Super refreshing appetizer. It had pieces of citrus fruit, cucumbers, toasted coconut and shallots in a spicy lime vinaigrette. My favorite dish of the night. Wish this was a larger portion. I only had a small spoonful. \n\nNam Tok Beans - Beans served with leafy green wraps. The beans were salty. We all agreed there was something missing... maybe a sweet dipping sauce to balance out the saltiness? This was when they brought out the sticky rice to accompany the beans, but it was so hard to spread the sticky rice out on the leafy green. \n\nPlah Pla Muek - Squid in a citrus, salty sauce. Not as spicy as expected. Super tasty paired with the caramelized pork belly. Thanks our waiter for the suggestion! \n\nCaramelized Pork Belly - Very tasty pork belly! The portions could have been larger. Some of our party got very thin or small slices/pieces of the pork belly because of various sizes placed in the pots. I put the sweet and savory caramel sauce all over my white steamed rice. Delicious! \n\nWok-Charred Brussels Sprouts in XO Sauce - Salty and made saltier by the dried scallops, shrimp, and ham. \n\nMassaman Nuea - Braised beef cheeks in curry with coconut milk. This was reminiscent of Indian/Middle Eastern curry so it was a little unexpected. The braised beef was super tender and soft, but we were all so stuffed that we barely touched this. \n\nBlack Rice Pudding - Tasty rice pudding. Wish there were more bananas!

I'm not going to dock it an extra star for that because objectively the food is good, but that \"Michelin star\" conjures up major expectations.\n\nMaybe it's just what my group ordered, but the lunch menu in general doesn't offer many interesting dishes. I was debating between the Khao Soi (curry noodles) and Pork Bowl (pork noodle soup) and opted for the Khao Soi since I felt like the flavors would be more representative. It was tasty but did not blow me out of the water. Also, there are way too many crispy noodles (and maybe not enough egg noodles)! I love me some crispy garnish, so I can't believe I'm saying this, but I literally had to dig under the crispy noodles to get the egg noodles. I ended up finishing the egg noodles with tons of crispy noodles left over. \n\nOther people got the fried chicken sandwich which looked tasty but also impossible to eat as an actual sandwich because it consists of two thick pieces of toast.", "author": "Allison Y."}

But the food was really good that it was worth the wait! I got to try their Nam Tok Beans, Pork Belly and some curry (that had omelette on top, not sure what the name was.....). Besides from the pork belly, both the beans and the curry were something that I have never tried before. The nam tok beans were a little salty, but when you wrap them with the lettuce and cucumber, they are just perfect. The curry was more like soup with veggies and omelette on top.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-06", "description": "I'm always a skeptic when it comes to hyped-up bouge Asian food flooding Instagram, because all too often it's everyday street food repackaged onto ceramic plates and marked up 10x what the original version costs in Asia. I guess you can call me a hypocrite, because when I noticed Kin Khao's newly minted Michelin star, I perked up my ears, visited for lunch and dinner, posted on Instagram, and added to the hype.\n\nTL;DR\nYes, Kin Khao stems from Thai street food, but with a creative and distinct California twist.\nYes, it's pricey, but yes, it's worth it.\n\nPro tip: I strongly recommend coming in a group and ordering a la carte, because the Friends and Family prix fixe menu is a hefty $60 per person, with less flexibility. We came as 4 people and it came out to $35 per person total after tax+tip, and we were full and satisfied all our curiosities on the menu.\n\n(++) Five-Spice Duck Noodle Soup ($23; Confit Muscovy duck leg, thin rice vermicelli, bok choy, garlic oil, five-spice broth): The duck had an amazing semi-crispy coating of spices, and the flavorful duck paired and thin vermicelli well with the subtly flavored garlic oil and five-spice broth. I'm almost glad I had this alone at the bar, because it's one of those dishes best appreciated with some contemplation. The portion size was generous with the large duck leg, though for a lunch totaling $30 I'd better not be hungry afterwards.\n\n(+++) Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine ($14; curry mousse in-a-jar with mushrooms, crisp rice cakes): Perhaps the most unique dish--I never would have imagined curry in mousse form, spread onto texturey and light housemade rice crispies, with some mushrooms thrown in for dimension. There's a layer of what seemed like coconut cream on top for extra deliciousness (and aesthetics).\n\n(+++) Nam Tok Beans ($14; Ayocote Negro beans tossed Isaan-style with lime, chili, rice powder, light soy, shallots, scallions, mint, cilantro): Bold without restraints. The combination of spicy, cool, earthy, citrus, and aromatic flavors synergize into a complex gastronomic artwork. You'll never look at beans the same way again.\n\n(+++) Caramelized Pork Belly ($17; sweet, savory, voluptuous pork belly cooked in a clay pot): Remember the first time you had good pork belly in ramen, it was delicious but after awhile it just tastes standard? Welp, Kin Khao's pork belly solves this first world problem. The smokey roastiness, indulgent baconieness, and caramelized sweetness tug the flavors in different directions, resulting in a voluptuous masterpiece. It's perhaps the most tender pork belly I've ever had that really seems to melt in your mouth. (Sublingual pork belly, anyone?)\n\n(+) Yaowaraj Noodle ($19; Bangkok Chinatown stir-fried rice noodles with chicken, XO sauce, egg, green onions, cilantro): Having heard good things about their pad kee mow, I was excited to try their seasonal noodles, but the yaowaraj noodles were just okay--the ingredients were fresher, the noodles were more meticulously al dente, and it was overall tastier than your typical Thai noodle dish, but it didn't live up to the price tag. \n\n(+++) Massaman Nuea ($35; braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes): Woaw, quite a memorable curry with robust layers, from a tantalizing blend of spices and floral creamy coconut milk melding into fall-apart-tender beef. For better or for worse, from this point on most other curries taste diluted to some degree. \n\nRice ($4): We got an order of sticky rice and one of brown rice, and they came in a cute little ceramic crock pot. The sticky rice was a kind of \"lightly sticky\" rice that was delicious but not too dense. If you are getting curry, I recommend 1 rice order per 1-2 people. \n\n(+) Black Rice Pudding ($11; served with burnt coconut sugar caramel, salty coconut cream, puffed rice+peanut+sesame praline all on the side): Everything tasted homemade and not too sweet, to my liking. The concept of DIY Thai sundae is fascinating; however, for someone eager to try dessert but cognizant of graceful dining, having to add each ingredients in tiny spoons was cumbersome. \n\n(++) Buttermilk Soft Serve ($11; served with Pim's stone fruit jam and toasted coconut): The flavors of the actual soft serve are mild (note: does not taste like buttermilk fried chicken); you can think of it as similar to Bi-Rite's creme fraiche except less creamy and less sweet. The interplay of fruit and toasted coconut was like sophisticated trail mix. I enjoyed the nuances of this dessert (and the fact that it's easier to eat in large spoons than the black rice pudding.)\n\nOverall, Kin Khao is a crafty culinary adventure that is definitely of Michelin caliber. I've had mixed experiences with the servers--some seem friendly and others seem borderline pretentious. The dining area is more casual than the ambiancey bouge places of SF, but the food presentation is solid (which is the priority these days).", "author": "Edna C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-01-18", "description": "In the 3 times that I've been to Kin Khao, today's visit was by far the most disappointing. The two previous times I've gone to Kin Khao, my experience was quite good to be honest. \n\nTo start this review, if you didn't know Kin Khao had a Michelin star, now you know! As you walk into the restaurant, it's hard to miss the 2018 Michelin plaque on the wall. \n\nI ordered the duck noodles today as my entree and it was not a dish worthy of costing $23 (I believe it was actually the most expensive dish on the lunch menu). The broth that the noodles came in was very, very bland. Usually when you get a bowl of soup, the first sip is the best because your taste buds are overwhelmed by sudden change in flavor and from there on out, each additional bite becomes more and more mundane. This was certainly not the case with this broth. Compared to the broth that you get with pho, the broth here is seriously lacking in any flavor. The rice noodles were also on the overcooked side - very soggy. While the duck leg that came with the dish was very crispy on the inside and seasoned well with salt, it wasn't anything that was mind blowing. There wasn't any creative or complex sauce to go with the duck leg other than a sauce that tasted much like a watered down buffalo sauce, with a hint of chili. \n\nFood aside, service was kind of a mess as well. Good service in my opinion is when the wait staff comes and delivers food and drinks to the person who ordered it without screaming out the order. Unfortunately, that was the case with every dish that arrived - chaos. For the first couple of orders that showed up, the waiter would yell the name of the dish, hoping the person who ordered it would shout back with their hands up saying it was them who ordered the dish. After the first three orders, the waiter gave up on this effort and just started to randomly place plates of food in front of people. Huh?\n\nI don't claim to understand how Michelin stars are award, but without great food, nor service to match, I'm not sure what Kin Khao is getting awarded for.", "author": "Austin W."}

Probably has the star because it deviates from the standard Thai restaurant route of Pad Thai and Green Curry. It has a very interesting menu split into three sections. Our waiter recommended us to get one from three sections. Would have been too many to share between two people. Had the massaman beef curry which was quite good. Had a huge chunk of beef inside. Portion size with a side of rice was actually large enough for a whole meal. Would have been content with just that. The wild boar laab is very very spicy. More than I expected.

We had called ahead to see if we needed a reservation. The hostess picked up and said there were tables available so no reservation needed. We walk over immediately from our hotel (took about 15 min) and then when we got there and was greeted by the hostess (same as the one on the phone), she was very snarky and said we needed a reservation so made one on the spot for us with her resy app. Confused, we asked why and she said that some people \"snuck in\" within the past 15 min without reservations. She said it in such a disgusted tone that was so offputting, as if the thing she hated most in the world were walk ins. There was no waiting area in the restaurant so we sat outside of the entrance to wait for her to call us back in when our table was available.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-07", "description": "Kin Khao is quite possibly one of the best thai restaurant in the Bay Area. The flavors here are bold, innovative and from what I have heard quite authentic to food in Thailand. About 2 years ago, when I first visited, it had just received its 1-Michelin star. I came back twice since then and have found the quality of their food to be consistent and on point each time. \n\nA couple things to take note. Food here is unforgivingly bold, but well balanced. You need to like acidity and appreciate spice or else you might miss out on the full experience. The menu is organized by \"bites\", \"meats\", \"seafood\" and curries. There is also 1-2 dessert offered every night, but they do run out as you approach later into the night ~9:00pm or after. The idea at Kin Khao is to order family-style, sizing can be portioned depending on the sizing of your party. I have been here as a party of 2 and a party of 6; I suggest if you have a party greater than 4 people to make a reservation because the restaurant does get quite packed! \n\nAmbience here is intimate, casual but more upscale than your typical Thai restaurant. Presentation is key, and the kitchen is pretty good about customization. My favorite part of eating here is the unique flavors and dishes that I've never experienced anywhere else. It's truly an awesome experience if you like Thai food like I do. \n\nFor a party of 4, I recommend getting 2-3 bites and 2-4 entrees. The entrees are not petite, but they are also not big. So portion that based on how much you eat. My friends and family have a big appetite so we usually order at least 1 entree per person + bites. \n\nBites: I recommend the pork cracklings, mushroom terrine (it's like a pate made with mushrooms!), nam tok beans (this was really interesting and delicious; a bit on the acidic side FYI), khao yum and the pretty hot wings. A lot of these were recommended by our waiter, who will be able to let you know which dishes might be too spicy based on your palate. We ordered almost everything medium to spicy\n\nMeats: Khao Kan Jin is a pork-rice-blood sausage that is steamed and wrapped with banana leaves. It sort of reminded me of Chinese zongzi because of the texture and flavors. However, this definitely had a thai flavor to it; Caramelized pork belly (sweet) and Wild Boar Laab Kua (spicy and tart) were both very tasty and unique. \n\nSeafood: Plah Pla Muek is a grilled whole squid that is so tender and topped with peanuts and a tart, thai-spice dressing that is tingles the tongue in the most perfect way. This was one of the spicest dishes we had (probably because we also asked for spicy), but it tasted really good. I liked dipping sticky rice in it or drizzled over normal steamed rice. \n\nCurries: Khun Yai's Rabbit Green Curry caught my eye because I really like rabbit meat when it is cooked well. The green curry here was on point, fresh, herby and spicy. I loved that you could see the granules of spices that contributed to the green curry paste. The rabbit was stewed in the curry, but wasn't star of the curry unfortunately. Massaman nuea was also quite good mostly because I like massaman curry, and that combined with beef \"pork cheeks\" that were amazingly tender, was a lot of fun for my palate. \n\nSpecials: will be shared by waiter/ress; they do have different specials each day. \n\nSides: order sticky rice to eat the thai-way (so I'm told by my husband who lived in Thailand for a month); the chicken broth is also very nice. Clean, not-greasy, light but also with a lot of great chicken flavor \n\nDesserts: save room for dessert PLEASE. It hasn't ever been an issue for me at Kin Khao because their black rice pudding is so delicious. It's also kind of served family style. The concept of the dessert is also quite unique. Essentially you are given steam black rice and a variety of toppings to customize your own \"coconut sticky rice pudding.\" The sticky rice is perfect, and more fun to eat than white sticky rice. Toppings all complemented each other well: strawberry hibiscus syrup, burnt coconut sugar caramel (by favorite!), salty coconut cream, puffed rice-sesame seed praline. EXCELLENT. Get it. \n\nOverall, Kin Khao is a special Thai experience. Food here is innovative, beautifully rustic plating, but the flavors remain authentic to thai cuisine, spiced up to another level. Overall, excellent and highly recommend.\n\nBon Appetit!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

This dish was probably one of the best I have ever had.  I mean, those chicken wings were marinated so well that they were extremely flavorful.  The fish sauce reminded me of the Vietnamese fish sauce they use in almost every dish, it was spicy and salty with a tinge of sweet.  The Nam Tok Beans were Ayocote Negro beans tossed with lime, chili, rice powder, soy sauce, shallots, scallions, mint, and cilantro--all the ingredients I like, basically.  I am not a fan of beans but this was pretty good, the beans were firm and went really well marinated.  This dish came with some lettuce and cucumbers.  \n-The Khun Yai's Rabbit Green Curry was with coconut milk, rabbit, apple eggplants and basil.  The curry was nothing too special in my opinion, as the curry tasted okay, more plain than anything.  The Caramelized Pork Belly came only in three and a half pieces and it tasted sweet and savory as it was advertised.  It was flavorful and a good amount of salty in the clay pot.  You'll need a lot of rice to eat with this dish.  The Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine was curry mousse in a jar with mushrooms and a few crispy cakes.  This dish was the one I liked least because I didn't tasty any mushrooms.  \n-I had the purple drink which was was made with Thai Purple Flower and Lemonade.  My gfs also ordered the same drinks and one said it was too sour, one was medium sour and mine apparently was perfect.  \n\nImprovement:\n-The dishes were flavorful, some were different and some were just okay.

It was by incompetent luck (half assed research) that the restaurant I was planning on going to was closed Sunday.  \nYelp to the rescue. \n\nSituated in the back of Parc55 Hilton hotel rests this Michelin star Thai restaurant. Who would've thunk it? \n\nI was eyeing the pork belly bites, but it's only offered during dinner! Booo\nOrdered the curry mushroom terrine with rice crackers instead. \nIt was a pleasantly thick, smooth and creamy  yellow curry with tender mushrooms and a bit of a spice kick at the end. The cracker gave a nice contrasting texture to the mousse. Really delish. \nI got the rice, pork and blood sausage wrapped in banana leaf bite because I like anything wrapped up like a present. It's a cross between the Chinese sticky rice dim sum and the \"chocolate\" stew my Filipino friends got me to eat called Dinuguan. It was definitely comforting and good, but I don't need to have it again. \nThe last thing we ordered was the Pad Kee Mao. It's basically spicy ground pork with chow fun noodles. The noodles were perfectly cooked and coated well in sauce. It was delicious. I'll order that again next time and not share it. \n\nNot your typical Thai fare, but I didn't miss the Pad Thai. \nWill definitely be back for that pork belly though.", "author": "Pam N."}

Good contrast with the rice crackers \n\nPretty hot wings - I've had better wings, I think I prefer Korean hot wings\n\nNamprik Long Rua - It says on the menu that this is not for Thai food beginners, we read that and immediately reacted with \"challenge accepted.\" But we failed the challenged, I wish we had stuck to some good pad kee mao or something. The flavors again were good, but it just wasn't something any of us particularly enjoyed. The dish itself is a bit confusing, it comes with assorted vegetables (fried, steamed, raw) that you then eat with a sauce that includes catfish, etc. and you eat it with rice. I guess I'll continue to be a beginner. \n\nPork belly - heavy, caramelized, not spicy, delicious. My main qualm about this dish is that it's a-la-carte and needs to be paired with something to cut through its heavy and rich flavor, which isn't something we gave good thought to. \n\nThai soft serve - pretty tasty! We didn't love the roasted coconut with it, but there is also some tapioca in there and that was a nice addition. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't pass up another time to dine here, but I'll probably never seek it out until there is a potential they can change up the way that they serve their food so that not everything is so spicy.", "author": "Annie S."}

I called in a reservation an hour before they opened without any problems. When I arrived, there was already a line-up and those without reservations were given the option of the bar or the communal table. Personally, either would have been fine for me as well. About 30 minutes into service, the restaurant was buzzing with patrons.\n\nI decided to order 3 dishes, not really knowing what to expect in terms of portion size. I ordered the khao kan jin, the massaman nuea, and the butternut squash panang. The khao kan jin is rice with pork and blood sausage wrapped in a banana leaf, served with garnishes on the side. You open up the banana leaf and mix everything in. The rice was soft and tender and had a mild flavor. I enjoyed how the garnishes added to the flavor.\n\nThe massaman nuea was my favorite. It's braised beef cheek in a curry sauce with potatoes and whole shallots. The beef was so tender. Of the two curry dishes, this was the spiciest. Removing some of the oil in the curry helped reduce the spice. Mixing it with rice also helps. The butternut squash panang was also a hit. The butternut squash was perfectly cooked to an al dente firmness. I enjoyed the roasted peanut crust on each piece of butternut squash. One curry dish is pretty big. You'll definitely be full with just one. I had to take some to go.\n\nService was excellent. The wait staff was attentive and very knowledgeable of the menu.", "author": "Suor K."}

Highlights of my visit included the Butternut Squash Curry, the Pork Belly, and the Chicken Wings!\n\nThe service here is commendable, and the staff is very friendly and helpful in answering whatever questions one may have about the menu. For example, two orders of rice is definitely enough for a group of 5. We ended up getting an order of jasmine white rice and one order of sticky rice. (I wasn't particularly fond of eating my meal with sticky rice, but that's just me.)\n\nThe Butternut Squash Curry was my favorite because the flavors and spices created an unforgettable party in my mouth! The butternut squash was delicious and was not too soft or hard. This curry dish can be spicy for some, but it is manageable.\n\nMy group wanted to be adventurous, so we tried the boat trip relish. We didn't know what to expect, so we were really confused, when we got a plate of raw vegetables and the jar of shrimp paste sauce. We ate the vegetables with the sauce and added the sauce with our rice. The sauce was definitely not for beginner Thai eaters, as indicated on the menu. A small scoop was enough to generate a big burst of umami flavor in ones mouth. The taste is heavy, but delicious and very very flavorful. Interesting try, but won't be getting it again anytime soon (or at least until I'm a more experienced Thai cuisine eater).\n\nThe pork belly is definitely a dish you won't regret ordering. The fattiness of the pork belly just melts in your mouth, and it is fantastic.\n\nThe pretty hot wings can be a challenge to eat, but it is worth making a mess for! The wings have a hint of lemon-yness, and everything about the flavor was on point.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-27", "description": "Kin Khao is probably one of the most affordable spots with a Michelin star - which it does live up to. It's a quite small establishment on the ground floor of Parc 55 Hotel. The menu is pretty limited; for lunch there are only about 5 choices in each section, and slightly more for dinner. And most dishes are good for sharing.\n\nMy friends and I got the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine, Khao Soi, Five-Spice Duck Noodle Soup, Khao Mun Gai - in the order of my most to least favorite. The mushroom terrine is unlike anything I've tasted before. It's a jar of mushroom curry mousse, to be spread on crisp rice cakes. Never have I thought curry on rice crispy would be a good idea, but oh boy it is! Apart from the interesting texture, the mousse itself is also super silky and flavorful. This is a must-try! Then onto the entree. The Khao Soi is soft and crispy egg noodles in chicken curry broth. It's a bit spicy but you can ask for the chili oil on the side. It's a bit pricy at $16 given the simplicity of the dish in my opinion, but is indeed very hearty and fulfilling. The Five-Spice Duck Noodle Soup comes with a whole duck leg, with meat falling off the bone. I'd have liked it a lot more if not for the fact that it was over-salted. The Khao Mun Gai (chicken fat rice with ginger-poached chicken, served with a cup of chicken broth) falls short on flavor; we poured the leftover curry from the mushroom mousse (again, so flavorful!) to add up a kick.\n\nMy friend who's been there for dinner before also highly recommended the pork belly and fried chicken, which are only available for dinner. The dinner menu also has a $65 prex-fixe which was a great deal for the amount of food you get, per said friend.

I did not really care for the Turmeric Soda and sent it back (this is when I ordered the 2nd Blue Flower). My husband said his wine wasn't good. He said it tasted watery. \n\nWe ordered Khao Kan Jin, Pretty Hot wings - chicken wings, and Yaowaraj Noodle with Chicken. The food was pretty good. The chicken wings weren't anything special. The Khao Kan Jin was very good. It had rice sausage, garlic chips, peppers, green onions and other things. The rice and sausage come in a steamed leaf and you unwrap it and mix it in with everything else. This was different and really good. I also really enjoyed h crunch of the garlic chips. The wings weren't anything special. The sauce was ok but nothing stood out about it. Just typical wings. The noodles were also very good with the chicken. Th noodles had a nice chew and the sauce was good as well. We also ordered a side of sticky rice. It was your typical sticky rice. \n\nWe ended our dinner with the Buttermilk Soft Serve. It was very tart. It tasted like there was hardly any sugar. Buttermilk is definitely a fitting name as I believe it gets its tartness from the buttermilk. It had coconut and something else in it to add a bit of sweetness to the dish.

The curry had a hint of spice to it, but it wasn't overwhelming. What was overwhelming was just how tasty it was! There was so much freaking rabbit in the curry which was surprising. The rabbit was all also super tender-- I was worried that since some of the meat was on the bone (the rabbit is both on a bone and in the form of meatballs), that it would be difficult to eat. However, since the rabbit was tender, it came right off the bone! Not gamey at all!\n\nThe side of rice was a large portion, which is always nice.

The food arrived in a manner that was spread out allowing us time to discuss the dishes. The food was excellent as we expected. My issue happened as we were getting ready to leave. The manager approached us and asked us to leave as there were other reservations. It was the first time I have ever been asked to leave a restaurant in 48 years and honestly I did not like it after spending 175.00 plus on dinner for two. Had he waited we would have left within minutes anyway. For me and my date it was an unfortunate way to end our experience. So to recap the service and food was excellent, however the experience of being asked to leave is what I will remember about this restaurant.", "author": "Mark J."}

Start with the mushroom hor mok terrine, it's one of their signature dishes (it's a pretty common dish in Thailand, but I don't see it much in other Thai restaurants in the city). How to describe this dish? Uhm.. it's a jar full of goodness! It has coconut milk, it has curry and it has mushrooms. You just scoop some of those custard goodness onto a crispy rice crackers yum! \n\nThe Khao Kan Jin is one of my favorite dishes there. It's so authentic and you will never taste anything like it. It's pork, rice and blood sausage wrapped and steamed in a banana leaf. For those who never had blood sausage, don't worry it's not bloody or anything like that!! lol \n\nThe noodle dish is always great to have. The charred squid is delicious; it's spicy and tangy with lots of fish sauce and Thai chili! The whole roasted rock fish is great as well; it's served with the same sauce as the squid. \n\nFor the curries, I really like the beef cheeks massaman curry. The meat is very tender and the curry is very rich and flavorful; the sweetness in this curry come  from the coconut milk and lots of sweet spices like cardamoms, cloves, star anise, and nutmegs.", "author": "Sam M."}

As a Korean human, I think fermentation is an attractive savory factor when it comes to food. The whole experience was definitely more exotic than usual. \n\nI ordered the Hor Mok, which was NOT what I expected. It said mushroom, so I was expecting a mushroom veggie dish, but no. Definitely interesting and really good though. It's more of a mushroom curry paste to dip. We also ordered the Nam Tok, which the server said to be careful with given how potent and strong the flavors are, but I thought this was the best dish here. Definitely tastes like Korean food, dwenjang or Makdwenjang.\n\nI would say the service was interesting. Our server was funny and said his wife was asian, which was funny to me.

Or maybe my expectations are higher when I'm paying more. This meal left me wanting some good ol' hole in the wall Thai food.\n\nFirst of all, we were quoted 1hr wait, but we waited longer than that --- closer to 1.5 hours. I hate poorly estimated wait times; I'd suggest under promising and over delivering --- it's much better psychologically.  Tell them the wait is 2hrs so that's what they expect, when it's really less --- then they're excited it wasn't as long as they expected! \n\nAnyway, by the time we were seated, we were ravenous. We tried the Pretty Hot Wings (fish sauce wings), caramelized pork belly, and the Massaman curry dish.\n\nFirst, I can guarantee that your blood pressure will spike after eating here. Every item was crazyyyyy salty, even paired with mouthfuls of rice. We joked that the chef was crying into all of the entrees that night because it was so busy. There's a lot of dishes I eat at home such as salted fish, where the salty item is meant to be paired with rice to tone it down, but not even rice could save the day.\n\nPretty hot wings - super salty, standard fish sauce wings. You get 3? 4? wings....I know those wings are 2.99/lb at Ranch 99....come on now..\n\nCaramelized pork belly - fatty, salty, melt in your mouth pork. The first 2 bites were good, the subsequent bites.....just too salty and fatty to indulge in. \n\nMassaman curry dish - the flavor was unfamiliar to me......and not in a good way. The braised beef cheeks in it was tender, but again....wayyyyyyy salty. I usually like slurping spoonfuls of my curry, but not this one. \n\nService was friendly, but not anything memorable. For the prices we paid, we were expecting a lot more than overly salty fancy foods and ludicrous wait. Going to have to pass on any future visits.

It's inside a bigger office building so it can be sort of confusing to find but there's a sign on the corner. As far as the wait goes, if you have more than 2 people a reservation is a must. I imagine you'd still be waiting an hour or more with 2 so do yourself a favor and book ahead. They make you have the entire party before they seat you and hold your spot for up to 15 minutes.  The space is small but I didn't feel super cramped. \n\nNow down to the good stuff. The food itself is stellar. Unlike any Thai food I've ever had. We ordered a bunch of dishes to be shared family style. I  honestly can't remember what they all were but they were amazing and very unique. My favorite was the pork belly.

While not authentic, it definitely brings the flavor of Thai food and executes in a unique and tasty way.\n\nThe star of the show by far is the Caramelized Pork Belly. I've had my fair share of pork belly, but this pork belly is unbelievably good. Melt in your mouth delicious and tender, with an absolutely sublime sweet and savory flavor and sauce. The pork belly single-handedly carries Kin Khao from a great to a FANTASTIC restaurant. Combined with the waiter's suggestion of sticky rice, it is absolutely phenomenal.\n\nMany of the other items on the menu are also great in their own right, just not nearly as good. The Massaman Nuea is my next favorite, bringing a solid Thai curry taste with a delicious chunk of beef that tastes great and is a match made in heaven for white rice. The Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine is a delicious and unique appetizer, combining delicately crunchy rice cakes with a smooth and flavorful mushroom curry mousse that combines well together and brings out the mushroom. Nam Tok Beans are another appetizer that uses strong and pungent Thai flavors and feels very much like a true appetizer that builds up your appetite.\n\nAll in all, Kin Khao is amazing. The food is delicious, bold and beautifully presented (as one would expect from a one Michelin Star place), the decor is pleasant, and it is crazy affordable for a Michelin Star place.

However, if you are looking for over the top amazing, those dishes may disappoint you.  Maybe this is where people are critical of Kin Khao, because they expect a lot or are over hyped.  The beans could have done with a little less spices, and I agree that the Khai Mun Gai's chicken was a little dry.

We had reservations and were sat right on time. \n\nWe started with the pork belly and the \"pretty hot wings.\" The server added extra wings to our order so that we could each have one (we were charged for the extra, of course, lol.) I felt that the pork belly was tasty, not not a game changer. The wings however... ahhh YES! If you're a wing person, get these. They are unique with what I think was a slight vinegar taste that I really enjoyed. And they aren't ridiculously hot. I can't do super crazy spicy, because I'm a wuss, and these were perfect to me. \n\nOur party of 4 had 2 people who hate family style dining, and 2 who love it, so we all chose our own entrees, although Kin Khao seems to suggest you do your meal family style, which I agree would have been better, because the entree portions are pretty big, and totally shareable. If you have your heart set on visiting Kin Khao, I recommend going with your adventurous eating friends, who like to share :)\n\nMy husband and I ordered the Massaman Nuea, which is the braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry, coconut milk, shallotsa and potatoes. Although I did find this really really good, I felt that $35 for a bowl of curry was pretty crazy! However, as mentioned, the portions are pretty big, so I do think this could have been shared between 2 people along with 2 appetizers, unless you're a person with a big appetite. The flavors were delicious and it wasn't too spicy. \n\nOne friend ordered the green rabbit curry (also $35), and I tried 2 bites and my ears and head caught on fire from the heat. Thank gawd I didn't order that, because I wouldn't have been able to have more than 3 or 4 bites of this. If you're a wuss to spicy, do not order this! I could appreciate the flavors, but no way could get through the heat. \n\nMy other friend ordered the Namprik Long Rua ($27) (boat trip relish.) I had never heard of or seen this dish before. It was a little jar filled with what they refer to as a shrimp paste relish, caramelized pork jowl crispy catfish and it's surrounded by crispy vegetables to eat the relish with. It struck me more as a sharing item, but OMGGG it was SO GOOD. Unlike anything I have ever had. There were so many wild flavors going on in it, I regretted not ordering it. I will definitely go back for it. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed Kin Khao, but I was a taken aback by the entree prices. I feel like I have been saying that a lot lately about my dining experiences, so I guess I better suck it up and get used to it! I think I was particularly aware of the prices here because I'm used to the traditional Thai eatery prices, which isn't fair of me. I can't compare Mel's Diner's burger price to Marlowe's burger price, it just isn't the same thing! And hey, I plan on coming back, so that shows how the taste of the food trumps the prices :)", "author": "Liz M."}

I've been hesitant writing a review because I wasn't sure exactly how I enjoyed the food. Initially I thought I liked it. But I think most of that had to do with it being a Michelin rated restaurant so I felt obligated to think that it was good. However I knew in my heart that it wasn't my favorite thai. \n\nDon't get me wrong. The food is okay but didn't really satisfy my thai cravings. We eat A LOT of thai food, very often. So comparing it to all the places I've eaten at, Kin Khao was definitely different. For starters, I liked that the thai tea had a definite tea flavoring, though I wish it was a bit sweeter. The chicken wings were okay, but heavily sauced and a touch on the salty side. The curry was okay but lacked sweetness as well. The noodles were cooked well but also lacked sweetness I felt. The best item we had were the beans. \n\nEverything was okay but nothing was spot on. The service was also very average. The hostess was extremely sweet. However the waitress lacked any warmth or charm. No smile, nothing.", "author": "Dan P."}

On this night, my request was simple, there was a soup on the \"tasting menu\" that I wanted to order without having to order the 5 course pre fixed menu that not only I had to order but so did the person I was with. I asked & even pleaded in the most respectful way possible for the waitress to make this request to the chef on my behalf but she refused, given us long winded reasons on why this simple request could not happen .... disappointed & a little frustrated, we ordered our meals & proceeded with dinner. As closing time approached and only a couple of tables remained, I kindly asked again, even offering to pay to just get a taste of the soup. Again, I received outright refusal ... not even the polite \"let me ask the chef\" routine.

We weren't super hungry so we just got a dish to share and some drinks. We tried the Yaowaraj Noodle - rice noodles with chicken, XO sauce, egg, green onions, and cilantro.

The decoration was sparse and plain, pretty similar to any regular Asian restaurant with the utensils in a wooden canister on the table. However, it's all about the flavors here.  They do not shy away from it. One of the dishes we ordered was Nam prik long rua. It came with a warning in the menu and then our server warned us again about the strong flavor.  The warnings are probably due to the heavy taste of shrimp paste, cat fish head, fish sauce, and variety of chilies. If your interaction with SE Asian food is just with Pad Thai, drunken noodle, and pho, this might be too much for you. However, if you have experienced more with SE Asian foods, I would strongly recommend this dish.   The spice and flavors were pretty authentic.  \nThe portion sizes here are also pretty large, especially for a \"fine-dining\" restaurant.", "author": "Vanessa N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-23", "description": "My first Michelin Star restaurant in the US! When you first walk towards the entrance of the restaurant, the smell of the food is so strong that your tastebuds won't be able to contain themselves. Personally, I made a reservation aheAd of time via Resy, which was very easy since it only me and my friend so we were a small party. However, note that if you have more than 6 people and you make a reservation, you'll have to use their prix fixe menu. \n\nDRINKS: the names sound amazing, and the ingredients interesting. \n1) Blue Flower Limeade (4/5) - I saw many people raving about this drink so knew I had to try it. The drink itself was very beautiful, and tasted delicious - like limeade and my friend also tasted the blue flower (she's Thai and grew up with it). However, given that it's $9 and tasted just like a special-ish limeade, I don't really think it's worth it personally unless you have that money to casually spend. \n2) Pattaya Shake (0/5) - Tried as we might, my friend and I just couldn't finish this drink. We were intrigued as the menu says it's a concoction of pineapple infused rum, coconut cream, lime, condensed milk, and Thai tea. However, the lime and pineapple didn't go well with the creaminess of the coconut cream and condensed milk. My friend compared it to \"sour milk\". However, our waiter was very friendly and gladly replaced our drink. \n3) My Thai (3/5) - As someone who doesn't really enjoy alcohol, I thought the alcohol taste was very strong. My friend hardly ever tasted alcohol in her cocktails and was able to taste it in this drink, so that's saying something! She enjoyed the fruitiness of it, but the alcohol was overwhelming. \n\nFOOD:\n1) Mushroom Hor Mok (5/5) - First thing that came out from the kitchen, and our grumbling stomachs were in heaven. Don't underestimate this dish, as it looks relatively simple, but the flavors are amazing. The rice cakes seem like meh, but if you bite it them, they're perfectly crunchy. The mushroom Hor Mok is topped with coconut milk, but don't be afraid as it's not too strong and mixes well with the spices of the mushroom. There's a generous amount of mushrooms provided. \n2) Massaman Curry (6/5) - Curry with Beef Cheek that MELTS in your mouth! A generous amount of meat is provided, along with some potatoes. It's quite spicy, but if you eat it with rice, it's absolutely delicious. My friend who has never had Beef cheek before said there was a slight after taste, like when you eat liver, but I didn't personally taste this. I don't know what else to say about this... but I highly recommend it! \n3) Roasted Rock Fish (3/5) - Coming with a Vietnamese background, this fish reminded me of the roasted fish we can find in Vietnamese restaurants, so at $49 I wasn't sure how worth it this is for me. First bite of the fish, it's moist, but also quite fishy... however, if you dip them in the sauce that's provided and eat it with rice, it tastes a lot better! The green sauce is what my Thai friend calls a seafood sauce and the red sauce is a SPICY fish sauce infused with Thai chili peppers. Personally, we enjoyed it with the seafood sauce most. If you end up packing this home to eat, eat it wrapped in lettuce like a lettuce wrap!! \n4) Black Rice Dessert (5/5) - Im an absolute sucker for sticky rice and sweets. In the photos I've seen on yelp, the sticky rice cones with the burnt sugar caramel, salty coconut cream, puffed rice + peanut + sesame praline on the side. However, I'm not sure if it's just the night we went or the thing they do now, it was all topped for us already. The flavor were great, as the burnt coconut sugar caramel and salty coconut cream added dimensions to an otherwise only sweet dish - burnt, sweet, creamy, salty. The puffed rice and praline added delicious crunchy texture to the rather soft texted black rice pudding. Although our dinner was quite huge, I devoured this dessert down. \n\nSERVICE:\nAmazing! The servers are very friendly, and the food and drinks come out quickly. We weren't satisfied with the Pattaya Shake and the server kindly replaced it for us with a different drink. I also told him it was my friend's birthday, so he topped the dessert with a candle, and wished my friend happy birthday multiple times! \n\nATMOSPHERE:\nTaking an otherwise traditional Thai style feel and turning it a bit more upscale. Despite being in a hotel, you don't get that vibe. It's a bit darkened lighting to give for a more cozy meal. Thing to note is restroom is in the hotel lobby, and some tables were a bit too close for my liking, and there is a communal table.\n\nOverall, food is AMAZING, portions are great, drinks are meh, service is amazing. Highly recommend and I want to come back to try their other dishes!

My best friend from So Cal was visiting and we always have difficulty choosing a place for lunch so I thought of Kin Khao. \n\nThe first time I came with two of my friends over a year ago, we ordered almost everything off the menu. This time, we ordered the Pretty Hot Wings (3 pieces for $12), Khao Mun Gai ($17), and Five-Spiced Duck Noodle Soup ($23). We also had the blue flower limeade ($6) and the Kathoey Collins ($13). \n\nAfter the carafe of still water, the blue flower limeade and Kathoey Collins drinks came out first. My blue flower limeade was a beautiful non-alcoholic drink that the server added a small cup of lime juice which made it perfect. My friend's Kathoey Collins was a combo of vodka, chareau liqueur, blue flowers and also a little cup of lime. The drinks were visually beautiful and tasty. My friend wished she was on a beach with her drink!\n\nThe pretty hot wings (fish sauce+garlic marinade with a tamarind+sriracha glaze) came out next followed by warm linen towels. There are three wings to an order but you'd wish there were more! The flavor was spot on with a bit of a spicy kick and it was perfectly lightly fried. My friend is particular about getting her fingers dirty but even she couldn't resist getting sauce over her hands to eat it. \n\nThe Khao Mun Gai (chicken fat rice, ginger-poached chicken, Pim's secret sauce and a bowl of chicken broth). The secret sauce is what makes the dish! The rice is like very soft sticky rice. Just take that sauce and pour it over everything! The sliced cucumbers lining the bottom of the dish helped add a refreshing twist to the plate. \n\nThe duck noodle soup (duck leg, thin rice vermicelli, book choy, garlic oil, five-spice broth) came out last. The duck fell off the bone (for those of you who think you'll have to eat it with your hands) and the broth was very tasty. The combination of the ingredients made for a tasty treat. It was a bit expensive for $23 but was worth having my friend try. \n\nThe servers are beyond courteous. If you need to use the restroom, ask the server for a hotel key as it's located outside the restaurant in the Parc 55 hotel lobby.  Yes, a bit pricey but it was worth it both times...and times to come!", "author": "Olivia C."}

Buried in that sauce were some aggressive peppers.\n\nBoth of these dishes came from small plates section, in the middle of the menu.

I came with a friend, and being our indecisive selves, we perused the menu for a while before just asking for recommendations, though the recommendations given was basically everything is good lol. So we did this semi-independently - proud of ourselves haha. \n\n- Beans: these were interesting, definitely not what I expected. Maybe I didn't read the description carefully, but I imagined something like sambal green beans, and not like actual beans haha. We were instructed to enjoy the dish by wrapping the spiced beans with a bit of a crisp shell in the lettuce leafs. The spices were very strong, and perhaps a bit too salty for my liking. \n- Rabbit curry: it was between the rabbit and beef, and so I voted for rabbit because I hadn't had it before (or at least, don't remember lol). It had quite a similar texture to chicken (I guess that's why they didn't have chicken on the curry options haha), and was quite tender and wasn't gamey at all. The meatballs were a bit more so and had more texture. The curry itself was pretty good, but I wouldn't say something that really stood out to me. I'm no chef, so maybe it's difficult to cook rabbit, and that's where the skill and execution lies. \n- Caramelized pork belly: this was definitely the highlight of the meal. The pork was incredibly tender, with a glaze just right and perfect caramelization of the outside. I'm not one to eat fat, especially off something super fatty like pork belly, but I tried it just because, and it literally melted in my mouth. Definitely a treat! \n\nWe were both super stuffed after dinner (definitely ordered way too much lol) and we didn't finish all the food haha. I think I expected to be wowed a bit more from dishes like the beans (we both agreed we could have done without it) and the rabbit curry, maybe also because of the Michelin star hype, but the pork belly is definitely a must-try. I'm glad I was able to try my first Michelin star restaurant though! Long overdue for sure.", "author": "Joanna C."}

Searching for 55 Cyril Magnin on Google Maps will take you to the wrong side of the block. The restaurant is actually located on the intersection of Ellis and Mason, tucked inside one of Parc 55 Hotel's exit hallways.\n\nThe vibe here is casual, modern, and buzzing. Perfect for a chill night out with friends, Kin Khao offers an eclectic family-style menu that changes seasonally. None of the dishes that we ordered looked conventional or typical; everything was so unique! Most of their signature items are quite spicy though. Unfortunately, the menu doesn't indicate their individual levels, kinda like a 1-5 chili rating system. If your tolerance isn't great, I would recommend letting the waiter know early on to get some suggestions going.\n\n// Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine ($14) - 4 stars\nI've never seen anything like this. Interestingly, the crispy rice cake and mushroom curry mouse went really well together.\n\n// Plah Pla Muek ($16) - 4 stars\nYou know the food is authentic when it's this spicy. Two of my friends voted this as their favorite dish of the evening.\n\n// Caramelized Pork Belly ($17) - 5 stars\nMy personal favorite, the pork belly was melt-in-your-mouth tender. Literally soft as butter. It doesn't come with any carbs though, so order a side of rice to balance out the fattiness.\n\n// Kua Kling Ribs ($16) - 4 stars\nGreat moisture and juiciness on these ribs. However, our waitress over-hyped the spiciness when said that this was the hottest thing on their menu. To me, the squid was a notch more fiery.\n\n// Yaowaraj Noodle ($19) - 4 stars\nProbably the closest thing to Pad Thai on the menu, this noodle dish was not too greasy and had good portion size. Go easy when adding the vinegar though.\n\n// Crab Meat & Betel Leaf Curry ($50) - 3 stars\nThe most expensive dish was also the most underwhelming. I was expecting a larger mix of ingredients in the bowl of curry. It was just crab meat and a few leaves.", "author": "Miko B."}

I'd contemplated coming here for an anniversary dinner but we had decided to stay in.\n\nWhen we arrived, we got seated right away, which is surprising given the popularity of the place. We went with the mushroom mor hok terrine, crispy chicken sandwich, and black rice pudding. The restaurant was relatively empty by the time we sat down...but then we wait over 20 minutes to get our food. \n\nMushroom mor hok terrine! This is described as curry mousse in a jar with crispy rice cakes Basically tasted like a rather strong red coconut curry with strong lemongrass taste. You get a little spoon to spread the curry concoction (in a mason jar, lol how hipster) onto your crispy rice cracker. They were very generous with the number of mushrooms (to the bf's chagrin haha) as well as the amount of spread.\n\nCrispy chicken sandwich: bread was crispy but not burnt at all (yay good job!). I always have weird thoughts about cutting the top of my mouth on the crispy part of the bread...anyway...chicken was moist and flavored well, sriracha aioli they had went well. This didn't stand out in any way for me, but it was something I'd be okay with eating. Not a huge fan of pickled veggies, but these were ok.\n\nBlack rice pudding: I guess I was thinking about American style rice pudding, you know, the milky stuff you get in children's lunches. This is definitely Asian-style, basically tasted like the stuff my mom used to make in super large quantities. They give you a giant bowl of it with three toppings-- salty coconut cream, puffed rice+peanut+sesame praline, and burnt coconut sugar (tastes like those Chinese New Year coconut candies melted down). I guess it's different if you've had it before, but was kinda normal to me.\n\nKind of annoying that they don't put their prices on the menu available on their website but you can easily find this info on Yelp (yay, thank you fellow Yelpers!).

It's not quite what I had in mind. I was hoping for the crispy rice salad, but I think that is a traditional northern thai dish. This was still very good, though. And a nice break from everything else since it wasn't that spicy. The tumeric in the sauce was on point! \nFor the entrees, we got the \"boat dish\" (I don't remember the exact name, but it had a jar of savory meat and lots of fresh veggies) and the catfish curry. The cat fish curry was a bit odd because it also had pickled vegetables. I felt like there was a bit too much going on with the flavors of sour, spicy, and savory.

Welcome to another week of Fantasy Food Rankings.\nLet's get right into it. \n\nKin Khao's Lunch roster is STACKED, so with the short amount of time we have, I want to focus in on three dishes.\n\nStart/Sit Column:\n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine - In the last outting, Terrine started the game off strong as an appetizer, but soon fizzled away in the last two quarters. He has a unique style which catches most defenders off guard, but as soon as you realize its just rice crackers and curry, his pizzazz starts to wear off. Fantasy owners have been disappointed with his performance thus far as he has failed to find the end zone in recent weeks. Terrine will be a desperation start with only AP(Appetizer)4/Flex value in the deepest of leagues. I recommend a sit. \n\nKeep/Trade/Cut:\n\nPretty Hot Wings - Pretty Hot Wings coined their own nickname... How diva can you get? Let's be honest, we all know you have more tang than bite. We need to see Wings spice it up before he can enter our starting line up. Kenny Golladay to Calvin Johnson is what PHW is to Korean Fried Chicken. Wings looked great in the preseason and on film, but come game time, he has not performed as such. There were comparisons to San Tungs during draft time, but Wings never lived up to the hype. During Week 1 his potential value warranted a spot on your roster. But, at this point in the season, Fantasy Owners must regret spending their FAAB ($13 on average) as PHW has been downgraded to an appetizer by committee. PHW will be an AP3 with AP2 upside going forward for the ROS. If I owned PHW I would be looking to trade him away in a package deal with another dish. Hopefully there are fantasy owners in your league that still hold value off the name Wings alone.\n\nNews and Notes from around the League:\n\nYaowaraj Noodles with Chicken - Come preseason, Analysts have been raving about Yaowaraj. Although the MC (Main Course) position is plentiful throughout the league, Yaowaraj was able to emerge as a top tier fantasy option. Displaying a hint of fish sauce and a splash of vinegar, we've never seen a MC as polished so early in their career. He is currently leading the team in targets and continues to be the focal point of the offense, carrying the entire lunch menu.

Note: the restaurant does not seat your party until everyone is present. I started with the pattaya shake, which tasted like a creamy pineapple-flavored rum. I thought it tasted fine, but had hoped it would taste more like a spiked Thai tea. The only Thai tea characteristic in the drink was the ombr\u00e9 color effect. I also ordered the khao kan jin. The cilantro/shallot/garlic/lime combo is refreshing and really complements the meaty blood sausage flavor in the rice. I highly recommend this if you love the steamed sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf offered at dim sum places. \n\nThe restaurant is tucked away on a corner of the Hilton Parc 55 hotel. The restroom is in the hotel lobby, which was a bit confusing to get to. When I walked out of the restaurant, I didn't see any signs directing to the restroom, and I wouldn't have known where it was if I didn't run into a security guard in the hotel lobby. Don't forget to ask the servers at the entrance of the restaurant for a hotel key that gives you access.\n\nThis is not the usual one-dollar sign curry & pad thai Vietnamese restaurant where you order one dish that has meat/carbs/veggis and eat it all by yourself.

We did not have a reservation but were promptly seated at the one communal table. Our server was polite enough although he made himself quite scarce during our meal. We were satisfied with our experience until it came time to settle the bill. In Vancouver we are accustomed to the server bringing a credit card machine to our table because we have chip-enabled credit cards requiring the credit card holder to enter a PIN number into the credit card machine. We were not aware this was not an option at this restaurant, so when the server proceeded to take my friend's credit card and walk away with it, she asked if she should go up front to settle the bill with him, believing he would need her PIN number. It so happened that me and my friends are of Chinese descent, and this was our server's comment to us: \"this is not a Chinese restaurant. At a high-end restaurant we take your credit card, run it, and bring back the slip for you to sign.\"\n\nImagine our disappointment with the attitude of this server, in a city as diverse as San Francisco. This happened the first night of our visit and really gnawed at us.

It was difficult to make a reservation, but when a table of four popped up at an obscure time, we knew we couldn't resist. I knew it was a nice restaurant with good food. That's why I was pleasantly surprised when I found out they had a Michelin Star!\n\nSurveying the menu, we ended up ordering an array of appetizers and entrees. And of course with sticky rice! The first dish we ordered, the Spicy Chicken Wings, was tangy and spicy, but not unique in my opinion. The second dish, the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine with crispy rice, was creamy and hearty. \n\nWe were enjoying the crispy rice until one member suddenly exclaimed, \"there's a staple in the curry!!\". We immediately told our waiter who profusely apologized. The chef said that the staple probably came from the mushroom producer's cleaning techniques and not from the kitchen staff's handling. In place of the Mushroom dish, we told her that we wanted the Beans Dish, which she gladly ordered for us. I personally enjoyed the beans wrapped in lettuce more than the mushroom rice dish because of the nuanced zing from the spices and the crackly and crunchy but also chewy texture from the beans.\n\nThe rest of our dishes, the octopus, the pork belly, and the pumpkin/squash curry were all delectable. Out of the three, I would HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend the pork belly. It not only melts in your mouth, but the sweet soy sauce gives it an extra kick.\n\nWe also miraculously scored a reservation during the prime time. The restaurant itself was pretty loud, but not cramped at all. Because of the staple incident, the waitress took off the highest priced menu item (the curry) and gave us a free black rice pudding dessert. Thank you Kin Khao for wonderful food and also taking care of us after a staple scare!", "author": "Jessica E."}

First off, make sure you make a reservation beforehand because it gets packed within 10 min of opening. Luckily I was able to snatch a reservation at 5:30 the day before. So I didn't have to wait in line before they open... Which was quite long, btw. \n\nMy biggest problem with Kin Khao is that their food is either too salty, too sweet, too sour or just too overwhelming in general. I've had thai food in Thailand before and I know it's supposed to be extremely flavorful but I'm sure it can be done in moderation. I'm not supposed to be chugging my water after every bite or try to eat as much rice as possible to subdue the taste. \n\nRibs 2/5: \nThis was probably THE saltiest and spiciest thing they've got on the menu. I ate a whole bowl of rice for one piece of rib. There were just too much spice and lemongrass going on. There were 4 of us and half of the ribs were still untouched by the end of dinner.\n\nPretty Spicy Chicken 3/5:\nIt wasn't really spicy and way too sour, too much tamarind. \n\nCaramelized Pork Belly 4/5:\nOne of the better dishes here, a little bit on the sweeter end but the pork belly is super tender and fatty. \n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine 3/5:\nIt's curry mousse in a jar with rice crispy. An interesting fusion dish, I liked the curry, not sure if the rice crispy add to the flavor or not. \n\nYaowaraj noodle 4/5:\nBangkok chinatown stir-fried noodles with a bunch of random stuff. It's basically chow fun and pad see ew mixed. I thought this dish is on the better end, I really liked the charred flavor, and it's not too overwhelming. The addition of dried shrimp, dried scallops, and dried ham was a great idea. \n\nBlack Rice Pudding 4/5:\nCoconut and black rice pudding, with burnt coconut sugar caramel, salty coconut cream, and puffed rice+peanut+sesame praline. They serve these all separately so you can mix them all together yourself. I liked this! I really like the combination, but it tastes very similar to a vietnamese dessert (che) which doesn't cost $8. \n\nKin Khao is much more like a fusion restaurant than an authentic Thai restaurant. I think it's too much for thai food, and I don't think it's justified.", "author": "Yen P."}

I was guest in the hotel and after a lot of hiking, I was beat.  I went for a shower and said to my boyfriend \"Just get some pad thai or something - I saw a thai place downstairs\".    So...they don't have pad thai - simply not that kind of Thai place, what with the Michelin star and all.  After all that hiking, he wasn't about to come back empty handed though, so he attempted to order takeout.   Apparently not that kind of place either.  Our two dish takeout meal threw the kitchen into a tizzy and apparently it was quite the project.   \n\nTotally worth it though.  The chicken and noodle dish he brought back for me was absolutely delicious.

It was  Saturday and they were able to accommodate.   They had a lunch menu, and was served over the weekend. That was actually a negative, I asked if I could order off the dinner menu, and was denied, the 1st time I have ever experienced this, I mean why not, at the very least my  check will increase. \n\nWhat i noticed is that the lunch menu is protein deficient, noodle and rice heavy,  I mean what is better for a hangover than copious amounts of Asian protein, lol. Well sometimes you can't always  get what you want, and this was not a need.\n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine that was a very tasty app creamy, super amounts  of unami. \n\nSom Tum Papaya Salad  this was really nice, very fresh and lots of citrus. \n\nNam Tok Beans - This was quite tasty and exceeded my expectations. The only issue I had with this was that they do not serve enough lettuce wraps with this, I asked for more and was not charged, however I would think that would have been obvious. \n\nThe service was awesome, efficient, confident and professional.\n\nI am not giving 4 stars for the fact that the lunch menu is pretty limited and if lunch is your only option are not permitted to order off the diner menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-08", "description": "Cheapest Michelin star restaurant in SF (or so I'm told). Kin Khao has been on the Michelin guide book for two years now. The restaurant is in the same building as the Hilton hotel and might be affiliated with the hotel in some capacity. Kin Khao's restrooms are on the Hilton's establishment.\n\nWe made reservations one week before for a group of six people at 8pm. I recommend making a reservation a week ahead of time, especially with larger dinner parties. \n\nAtmosphere: Kin Khao is a slightly upscale Thai restaurant and they play 70s/80s music (yay). \n\nService: great customer service. The waitress was on point about her recommendations (ex. portion size, dishes). \n\nFood. Oh boy, we got a lot. We did it family-style. Two of our friends came here before, so the stuff we ordered were on point. \n\nDrinks:\n-Blue flower limeade. The limeade had a light fruity flavor. It was unexpected but really good. You had to mix it to get that nice shade of blue (you have to be there and drink it). \n-Thai ice tea. Disappointing. Very diluted when we got it. \n\nAppetizers:\n-Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine. We put mushroom curry on the rice cake. Best appetizer. It was really satisfying. \n-Khao Kan Jin. The contents (rice with pork) was wrapped in a banana leaf when served. It was pretty good. \n-Carmelized pork belly. Sweet, savory, and voluptuous (just how the menu described it). It was served in a cute clay pot. The clay pot cover had a animal on it. I think it was a pig? SOOOOO GOOD!\n-Wild Boar Laab Kua. Pretty spicy (6/10) and good dish. \n-Yaowaran noodle. Tastes like typical Chinese stir-fried noodles with chicken. Not impressive.\n\nEntrees: \n-Massaman Nuea. Sweet curry with beef. Not my favorite, especially since we had green curry.\n-Khun Yal's green curry. Spicy green curry with rabbit meatballs, rabbit leg, and eggplants. Spicy level was 7/10. Even though it was really spicy, it was MY FAVORITE entree. I don't know what to make of the rabbits, but it was good. \n-Namprik Long Rua. Be warned - this is really spicy (8/10). The menu says that \"this is not for beginners.\" All the spiciness is at the bottom. We put this spicy, shrimp paste on various vegetables. It is recommended to save this dish for last, because your taste buds might be slightly numb. \n\nSides:\nSalted Duck egg. Eat this with some rice!\nPork crackling. Chili and lime flavored. I love how the chips crackle when you sprinkle lime on them.\nHouse Pickles\n2 sticky rice + 1 white jasmine rice. Enough for 6 people!\n\nDessert:\nDidn't get any because we were so full. Next time, I wanna try the black rice pudding. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend Kin Khao. Only deterrent is the pricing. I can understand if people do not want to pay $20 for Chinese stir-fried noodles (I wouldn't again). But if you want to treat yourself every so often and are in the mood for Thai, come here!\n\nPro tip: you can get Kin Khao postcards. They are on the wall shelf in the back.", "author": "Jessica C."}

The only downside is this place is a bit pricey for dinner. I also didn't realize it had a Michelin star.\n\nFor the appetizer my friend and I shared the asparagus. It was good but nothing that memorable. The serving size is also fairly small so don't expect to get full off of any appetizers. We shared the yaowaraj noodle dish which was my favorite. \n\nThen we tried to be adventurous and shared the namprik long rua which the waitress made sure we knew it wasn't for beginners. I like trying new things but was a bit worried when she said that. After I got the dish I knew what she meant. The dish has a really strong spicy shrimp paste. It's extremely intense and definitely needs to be eaten with something else like rice to dilute the flavors. I thought it was interesting to try but I wouldn't get that one again. We finished off the meal with black rice pudding and toppings like coconut cream and caramel. The dish was hot and wasn't what I expected but still tasty!\n\nOverall fun place to try new dishes and great atmosphere.", "author": "Linda X."}

After a long time of glossing over the menu, we decided to opt for the tasting / prix fixe \"Friends and Family\" menu. For what it was, the price ($55) was a little hefty. \n\nThe prix fixe menu featured a lot of their most popular and signature dishes. And to be honest, I didn't have the highest expectations. I mean Thai food is good, but always a mediocre level of good. 5 minutes into our first course, I was blown away. The mushroom hor mok and the nam tok beans were exceptional takes on everyday Thai flavors. The rest of our dinner was incredible as well, but for me those two appetizers, the massaman curry (our server was nice enough to let us substitute this for the green rabbit curry), and the caramelized pork belly were standout dishes. \n\nI'm not sure I would come back anytime soon, but definitely a great dining experience, with a unique take on Thai cuisine that is not to be taken granted for!", "author": "Liz C."}

Really, don't waste your time or money on this restaurant. I really wanted to go because I saw that they earned a Michelin star. \n\nI went here with le bf once, and that was the second time the bf had been here. Both times, he was underwhelmed. He thought the food quality didn't match the price. I have to agree with him. \n\nKin Khao is located in the Parc 55 Hotel. Le bf and I ordered sticky rice, papaya salad, and a few different entrees. I've honestly forgotten about the 3 different entrees we ordered because they are just not memorable. My biggest gripe was that the sticky rice was cold. The first time we got it, it was cold and served in a grass-like basket. We sent it back because we have never received cold rice at a Thai restaurant before. The second time we got the sticky rice, it was still cold. At that point, I didn't need to send it back anymore. I just knew we were going to keep getting cold rice. How the heck do you serve cold sticky rice? Really, come on. The waitress who took our order that night also didn't seem to know the menu that well. We asked her for recommendations and she couldn't provide any. \n\nWe spent more than $150 that night and regretted every cent.

With that being said, it's as casual as they come and reservations aren't too hard to get. In fact, there are plenty of walk ins. The vibe is fun and the menu is very eclectic.\n\nI had an order of the wings, which were absolutely delicious. Some unique flavors that seem to show up with each bite, almost as if it's multi-layered. I also had the Pad Kee Mao dish which was exceptional. It's a noddle dish that, like the wings, had multiple layers of tastes. The vegetable panang was also delicious. The combination of all these dishes made for what was one of the most unique tasting meals I've ever had.\n\nWhat's great about places like this is that it's unexpected. You would never expect a place this casual to have a Michelin star. It's a little on the pricier side, but not too much so. Either way, it's worth every dime and then some.

The restaurant has a no-frills, very down-to-earth atmosphere. \n\nDishes were family style, with small plates around $15-17 and larger plates anywhere from $25-50. For two people, the server recommended 3-4 dishes total. Definitely a higher price tag than what you're probably used to paying for Thai, BUT you can also expect some amazing flavors that you definitely wouldn't get at any other typical Thai restaurant.\n\nKhao Kan Jin (Banana leaf wrapped, steamed blood sausage): \nThis tasted a lot like Korean blood sausage to me, which I love, so I really enjoyed it. But even my boyfriend, who usually doesn't like blood sausage at all, thought that it tasted great with all of the fresh cilantro, lime, shallots, and fried garlic mixed in with it. \n\nPlah Pla Muek (Grilled squid):\nThe squid was so well cooked--Not very chewy, which is a big pet peeve of mine with squid and octopus. And the sauce that it was served on was SUPER tangy and fish sauce-y in the BEST way possible. Side note: Would not recommend for anyone that currently has a canker sore because the sauce is that tangy and acidic.\n\nMassaman Nuea (Curry with beef cheeks):\nOh my god, this is the gold standard for everything braised. The beef was so ridiculously tender and flavorful. All it took was a poke of my chopstick for pieces it to fall into the curry, which was also amazingly flavorful. It definitely wasn't like any other Thai curry I've had. I actually thought that it tasted like Thai, Indian, and Japanese style curry flavors had all been perfectly melded together.\n\nBlack rice pudding: \nThis came with toppings on the side, a kind of \"build your own\" type dessert similar to a sundae. Not as spectacular as the main dishes, but definitely one of the best rice puddings I've had.

Great flavors to dilute with the sticky rice served at this time\n\nCharrred Eggplant Salad: Soy+lime drsg, coconut, shallots, mint, cilantro, shisho (3/5) - Unremarkable but again a great rice accompaniment\n\nCarmelized pork belly: Sweet/savory in a cast iron pot (4/5) - Why are we still eating pork belly? Is there a next hip meat yet? The fatty part was melt in your mouth delicious, sauce excellent for mixing with the colorful mixed grain rice served at this time\n\nChili Jam clams: Littlenecks in chili jam and Thai basil sauce (6/5!) - favorite dish of the night for fresh umami and jazzy sauce\n\nBlistered Chinese long beans: XO sauce, dried scallops, dried shrimp, dried ham, ginger, garlic (4.5/5) - Kind of a Chinese staple and can't go wrong unless the beans are old.. which they were not in this case. A smidge salty but still very good with charred and savory flavors\n\nMassaman Nuea: Braised beef cheeks in curry, coconut milk, burnt scallops, potatoes (4/5) - Getting extremely full at this point but still enjoyable despite holding our bellies\n\nButtermilk Soft serve: Decent soft serve but AMAZING jam topped with toasted coconut\n\nWe also imbibed a Bundaberg Guava beer and a \"Quarzit\" Riesling from Germany. I'd skip the Guava beer since it literally tastes like sparkling guava juice but the riesling was delicious albeit expen$ive at $13 a glass. \n\nService was very attentive - in fact, sometimes too attentive since we had numerous servers ask us about taking our plates within minutes of each other. The dishes came out very quickly and despite asking them to slow down the pace, the courses just kept coming out piled on top of each other. Our little cafe table was definitely ill equiped to handle this.

It looked like there were people waiting outside the restaurant as well, but it wasn't hard to get reservations at all (on a weekday at least). So I recommend snagging a reservation if you can since it was pretty packed inside!\n\nOnce seated my friend ordered a beer while I ordered the blue flower limeade (a bit on the sweeter side but still good!). One of the biggest reasons why I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the service was so slow. The restaurant was packed but there were only about 3 servers. It took forever for us to place our drink orders, let alone even order our food... and even longer for dessert and our check.\n\nThe first dish we got was the mushroom hor mok terrine. We weren't really sure what to expect when ordering this, but it was so good. The rice cakes were so crispy we ended up eating some of it just by itself. The mousse concoction was super tasty as well, lots of mushrooms!\n\nNext we got the khao kan jin - our server told us to really mix the rice in, so we did. The rice was so sticky and my friend struggled for a bit in order to really combine everything together. This dish was good, but I would probably pass on it if I ever came back.\n\nFor veggies, we got the yum yai salad. Some much needed veggies, and the dressing on it was really good as well. Def a good choice if you want to get some green in.\n\nAnd then of course the caramelized pork belly! Probably the only dish we completely finished. The dish is just the pork belly straight up, so we also used the rice from the khao kan jin to accompany it. If not, I would recommend ordering a side order of rice or something. The pork belly was still sizzling in the hot pan and was cooked to perfection. DEFINITELY GET THIS.\n\nLast but not least we ordered the black rice pudding. The pudding alone tasted like nothing, so you really need to add in all the sides. We weren't the biggest fan of this and didn't bother finishing it, so probably wouldn't order again.\n\nAll in all, a solid place with a great atmosphere. It was casual and a bit loud so I wouldn't come here for super special occasion, but for dinner with friends it's perfect! Can't wait to come back and order the pork belly again.. among other things.", "author": "Megan K."}

I was initially a little shocked by the prices since it was lunch and we were albeit in a restaurant connected to a hotel, but I was later told that the place had a Michelin star so I guess that's expected. My first time ever in a restaurant with a Michelin star and it was pretty satisfying. \n\nThe pretty wings were very bold in flavor and I liked how spicy they were but just a tad too salty for my liking, not sure if it was the fish sauce that enhanced the saltiness of the dish. The khao soy delivered in taste, but I didn't like the crunchy bits on top that sat a little heavy in my stomach and was more of an interference in getting to the noodles haha. The dish is much better with a dollop of the chili oil on the table. Once I added that kick, the dish became pretty addicting. It got better with each bite. My husband had the pork noodle dish which he loved but I preferred the khao soy over his dish. Our friend had called in so the owner actually came over to our table and gave my friend a little signed souvenir since she had been told that she was a fan which I thought was the sweetest gesture and really meant a lot to her. It made the experience all the more memorable. \n\nService was really great as each of the girls who came to our table was really helpful and attentive to our needs. We ended with a black rice dessert which was really salty/sweet, but was evened out in flavor by all the add ons such as puffed rice and so on. Altogether a great experience that I would be willing to come back for!", "author": "Ann K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-14", "description": "First off all, let me start by saying that Chef Pim is the sweetest lady. She not only runs the kitchen, but also welcomes people to the restaurant and runs the dining floor! Although she was busy that night, she was nice enough to introduce herself to our table and tell us a bit more about her restaurant.\n\nNext, I think Kin Khao is unique in the experience it provides. It's quite a casual ambiance for a Michelin-star restaurant, which can be great if you're looking to exprience great food with friends and don't necessarily want to make a big deal out of it. However, it does get pretty loud, since the space is relatively small and it may not be the type of ambiance you'd want to a special occasion (dates, anniversaries, etc.). Additionally, some of the tables are very close to other tables, so the space could be a little tight. We were lucky to get a table in a good location on the floor.\n\nThe location is in the Tenderloin, not too far from Market Street at the bottom of the 55 Parc Hotel. Interesting location, but it gets the job done. Reservations are almost required, unless you have a party of 2 and you arrive after 9pm (you might get lucky!).\n\nOnto the most important thing that we all care about: THE FOOD. This being a Michelin star restaurant, I had high expectations coming in, and some of those expectations were met. Let me explain. Have you considered the difference between a Michelin star restaurant and any other restaurant? It could be a number of things, but for me it's the attention to detail. I thought that Kin Khao had this in some aspects, but not in others. Below, I've listed what we ordered and \n\n-Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine - This is a great appetizer to start with. Of everything we had, I felt that this dish had the most distinct mix of flavors. There was so much going on and combination of the soft, warm terrine with the crispy rice cakes took my taste buds for a ride. Highly recommended!\n\n-Massaman Nuea - I was trying to get the Rabbit Green Curry, but it was unavailable, so we went with this dish instead. Best choice of the night! This was my favorite--it was probably the softest meat I've had since Kobe beef in Tokyo. The curry sauce is also very savory and works perfectly with the meat. Highly recommended!\n\n-Caramalized Pork Belly - A lot of hype around this dish, but I felt like it lacked consistency. I've had better pork belly elsewhere and felt that it lacked juiciness. Still worth trying and damn good, but it fell slightly below my expectations. \n\n-Pretty Hot Wings - Unfortunately, these were not spicy... at all. The chicken was also kind of bland beyond the skin. I would probably skip these and try something else on the menu if I were to do it again. \n\n-Pad Kee Mao - This dish also did not meet expectations. Again, it seemed like the spices didn't really come out in the dish. This is a customer favorite from all the reviews I read, which makes me question how consistently they can prepare this dish. \n\nChef Pim aims to provide an authentic Thai dining experience. She sources all of the ingredients locally and makes all the spices mixtures by-hand in the restaurant. I think she achieves her goal, but sometimes it lacks in consistency. I would have loved to taste more of the spices and variety of flavors in these dishes. Overall, it's still a great dining experience, but (as many of the professional review on Kin Khao), there's room for improvement. \n\nNOTE: the Rabbit Green Curry can only be ordered with the Friends and Family menu (multiple courses, $55 per person). However, the online menu has it listed in the general Dinner section. This is very misleading! Pease be aware of this before you begin ordering!", "author": "Vasiliy M."}

The moment I set foot into the restaurant, I was overwhelmed by the smell of fish sauce. I'm not particularly used to it but it's bearable. I can see some people not being able to grow accustom to the smell. \n\nWe got the pork belly that everyone raves about, the whole rock fish and a side of sticky rice. The pork belly indeed lived up to the expectations. It was very flavorful and juicy and goes really well with rice. The rock fish was delicious as well; the fish itself was very tender and the sauce on the side just completes the dish. The only complain I have was the rice. The rice was kind of cold and tasted stale. It was like eating left over rice that was left on the counter for several hours. Definitely not what you'll expect from a michelin restaurant.\n\nOverall, this place has great ambiance and good food and I would definitely recommend it if you're comfortable with the fish sauce smell that pervade the whole restaurant.", "author": "Anita T."}

It took a while before I noticed the apparent lack of promised crispy catfish, until I realized those fishy breadcrumbs were it. This dish actually tasted better than I'm making it sound. \n\nThe carmelized pork belly was good, but I can do better at home with Trader Joes once-cooked pork belly and some balsamic glaze. For one thing, mine comes out crispy, unlike the restaurant's. \n\nKhao Yum salad was OK... preferred less carby and more salad-y, but it did say \"rice salad,\" so I suppose one should expect rice to feature prominently. \n\nThe rabbit green curry was too spicy for my taste, but a lot of people really enjoy spicy food. The rabbit itself was extremely tender -one of the best I've ever head this side of the Atlantic, and the rabbit meatballs were delicately flavored. Too bad the curry overpowered everything. \n\nOverall it was a decent meal, though I've probably eaten just as well if not better at neighborhood Thai places, and for less.\n\nOne thing that made the experience less than pleasant is the fact that it was blowing extremely cold air from somewhere -maybe a vent, maybe a draft from the door. I don't know. I just know we needed jackets where we sat. \n\nAnd... this was pretty egregious... near the end of our meal, the waiter comes by on his way from clearing another table, and refills my water glass -from the carafe he just cleared from another table!!!

I came here with 3 other people and our server suggested that we do NOT get the tasting menu as it would not be worth our money. The tasting menu is ideally good for 2 people since you get to try a little bit of everything. But for 4 people, you are better off ordering a la carte. He suggested we order 2 dishes from each of the 3 sections (so 6 dishes total) and it was the perfect amount of food for us.\n\nWe ordered the mushroom mousse, caramelized pork belly, noodles, braised beef cheek, khao kan jin and namprik long rua.

Truthfully I would have given this a 5 star if it wasn't for the Manager.  The restaurant was pretty lively and I had my baby watching her educational shows which is in spanish.  She wasnt making noises nor making a mess.  The volume on the phone wasn't loud compared to overall volume in this restaurant.  Then this white man came up with no introduction, no small talk, just the words of please lower the volume of the phone and left.  I don't know if this young man never learned customer service but that was not the way to approach the situation.  \n\nAfter we were done eating i called him and ask him why he told us about the volume. He said that supposedly a customer said it was disrupting them which mind you we are at a corner with just two tables beside us.  I want to make clear that my friend who is sitting two chairs away could not even hear the video on my phone.  I told him if this place was a family restaurant. He said yes but they dont usually have people with ipads and phones on during they were partaking in that restaurant.  Come on people really...no one in their phone? I mean thats BS.  I told him if thats the case they should put a sign that it wasn't allowed.  I told him in future reference that he should approach the situation differently.  I didnt complain when another customer laughed like a hyena, but he minded a spanish teaching video.  I ended it with I will be contacting thr owner and Better Business Bureau.  \n\nThe whole experience was ruined because of this gentleman.

It's one of my favorite places in the city to go to for an impromptu date night. It's also one of the few places that I will wait 40+ minutes for. Thankfully, you can order drinks while you wait, and the excitement of your future meal makes the time go by quickly. With that being said, it's always smarter to make a reservation (but we tend to be more impulsive about eating out). We've eaten at Kin Khao at least five or six times, but last night's meal was different as they were offering a special Friends and Family pre-fixe menu for $55 per person. We took advantage of the special menu, as it included many items that we had never ordered before. \n\nWhile we were waiting to be sat, we each ordered a cocktail; I ordered the Pattaya Shake (cacha\u00e7a, coconut cream, lime, condensed milk, thai tea) and my husband ordered the the Artist's Reward (Montelobos mezcal, maraschino, grapefruit, lime, peychaud bitters, thai chili tincture, saline). Both drinks were so well-crafted, as are all of their drinks, although cacha\u00e7a is definitely an acquired taste. Later in the evening, my husband ordered the Kem Kon (Old Granddad 114 whiskey, Vermouth L'Afrique, tamarind, lime, cinnamon) and I thought it was the tastiest, most well-balanced cocktail of the evening. \n\nOur pre-fixe menu consisted of the following:\n- Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine (Curry mousse in-a-jar with mushrooms & crispy rice cakes)\n- Nam Tok Beans (Ayocote Morado beans tossed Isaan-style with lime, chili, rice powder, light soy, shallots, scallions, mint, cilantro)\n- Charred Eggplant Salad\n- Caramelized Pork Belly\n- Chili Jam Clams\n- Blistered Chinese Long Beans in XO Sauce\n- Massaman Nuea (Braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes)\n- Buttermilk Soft Serve\n\nThe portions were very generous and we were absolutely stuffed by the end of the meal. There was an endless supply of sticky rice (my favvvvorite) and water was constantly replenished. The best dish, hands down, is the mushroom hor mok terrine. I could probably just get three orders of that and be totally satisfied. The curried mushroom mix is incredible, and pairs so well with the rice cakes. It's the right amount of heat and spice, and a great way to start the meal. It was our first time trying the nam tok beans, and we will definitely be ordering this dish from now on; the combination of heat, mint, and lime created the most delicious juice that we sopped up with sticky rice. Every dish we had was memorable and special, and the only dish I probably wouldn't order again would be the pork belly (it was too fatty for my taste). Otherwise, it was an all-around wonderful meal (per usual)! \n\nThe vibe is casual, yet upscale, and we've always had great service.

The design and interior are very comfortable and pleasing to the eye! There was a 45 minute wait when we arrived around 6:30 and we put our name down to be texted when a table was ready. We only waited around 25-30 minutes which was nice. \nWe ordered a lot (would have appreciated some guidance from the waiter on what is a good amount). \nWe started with the wings which are definitely spicy but sooooo tasty. The sauce was probably one of my favorite wing sauces ever, my date agreed. We also had the pork belly which was DELICIOUS. Only thing is, pork belly is so fatty, even with the sticky rice, it was too much to eat two pieces each (comes with four in a serving), so it went to waste unfortunately. \nWe also ordered the noodle dish they had on the menu which was good (my date's favorite dish), but to me it was just a basic noodle dish.\nThe true standout for me (even at the price) was the Rabbit Green curry.. it was soooo flavorful & delicious. I wish I hadn't been so full and been able to finish it because I love rabbit. \nOne thing I felt was missing from the dishes though was a little freshness. We ordered a meat heavy meal so of course it wasn't light, but I felt the need for some fresh herbs or greens to lighten up the heavy spicy sauces.\nI'd definitely go back and recommend to friends visiting SF.", "author": "Moranda B."}

It's located in the Parc 55 hotel, and Kin Khao matches the hotel's posh vibe accordingly. There's not much seating, and you also have a good chance of being seated at a communal table.\n\nBeing poor college students, my two friends and I limited ourselves to two dishes. We ordered the braised pork belly, which was really good. It's the perfect combination of fatty meat and tender pork. It's served sitting in sauce and its own fatty oil I think, so if you don't like that stuff, this might not be for you. The sauce is savory but has hints of sweetness. We also shared an order of the rabbit curry. It erred a bit on too salty, but eating it with a lot of rice helps. The apple eggplant was a unique touch to the curry. On a side note, rice costs extra, but two or three people can get full off one order.\n\nOverall it was a good first Michelin star restaurant experience for me, but I'm not sure if I'd come here again unless someone was treating me. :P", "author": "Priscilla S."}

First, we didn't even try the food because the overall service experience was soooo bad!  I don't care how good the food is, if the service can't match up to it, then forget it!   As eating  should be an experience that embraces your taste buds as well as your well-being!  If a place puts you in a bad mood, then it's hard to enjoy the food!  \n\nNow having said all that, let me describe our experience!  We got to the restaurant and were given a wait time of 15 min, even after clarifying with the hostess ONE FIVE as in 15 minutes!  So, after 40 minutes, I decided to check in on our table.  The hostess proceeded to tell me that we \"were next.  they were just waiting for the customer to sign the check.\"  Okay, I could handle that and was getting excited to finally sit down and try the food!  Now, another 15 minutes passed by; so, again I checked in with the hostess.   And, again, she said we were next!   Next thing we know, a party of 6 gets seated BEFORE us (we were a party of 5)!   At this point I had just given up and asked if we could just order our food to go, which the waitress and manager told me they don't do!!!  They couldn't even make an exception due to their misrepresentation and communication!  \n\nNeedless to say, after this experience, we all were NOT even hungry anymore!!!\n\nTrust me, no food is ever worth bad service!!!\n\nPS. As we waited for our ride, the party of six left without eating!  Go figure!!!", "author": "E F."}

We arrived as they opened at 11:30 and were sat promptly.\n\nA had been to Kin Khao before for a team lunch at work so he had tried some of their dishes, family style, and was a fan. That being said, he didn't remember what they had ordered so we settled on two of their lunch items. I had the Pinto Market Lunch ($18) and he ordered the Khao Mun Gai (I think $17). We just had water to drink but their cocktail list looked impressive, however we had lots of shopping ahead of us.\n\nOur meals arrived pretty quickly and were presented beautifully. I fully enjoyed my meal as it gave me a chance to try lots of different items. Note that I did order brown rice instead of white and this was forgotten, but I wasn't going to make a fuss over it. I thoroughly enjoyed the Rabbit Green Curry (never thought I would say that) which had a lovely flavor and was light. I also really enjoyed how tender the pork riblets were. My boyfriend, however, did not really enjoy his Khao Mun Gai. He found it a bit bland, even though the sauce served with it added a kick. Both meals were served with a cup of chicken broth as a palette cleanser which I think was a nice touch.\n\nNote, the food was good enough for us to come back, even if A ordered the wrong thing. However, what really got us was that it took us 25+ minutes to get the check and pay. Keep in mind, there were MAYBE 5-10 other parties in the restaurant. It took about 15 minutes for us to get the check after asking and then another 10 minutes for no one to grab the check with a credit card and me to get fed up and bring the card up to the front. This is frankly unacceptable, especially in a restaurant with a ton of help that isn't even half full. It is especially weird of a place with a Michelin star, no matter how casual. This left us with a very sour note in our mouth.\n\nOverall, I would PROBABLY come back, though for dinner on the assumption that the service issue was a fluke. I think the prices were reasonable and the food was of a high caliber but that the service wasn't at the level. I hope Kin Khao can prove me wrong on my next visit.", "author": "Carrie W."}

The rain was pouring outside during that time. The restaurant is inside the Parc55 building, and the hotel lobby was the only area where the restrooms were. I had to use it, however a sign in front of the restrooms stated that only concierge could provide me a card to badge in. I think that's ridiculous, since there was quite a long line of people trying to check into the hotel and I waited 10 minutes in line. However I was able to slip into the restroom with a group of patrons of the hotel before I reached to the front of the line to speak with concierge about a card for the bathroom.\nAnyway, when I got back to the restaurant, four other parties showed up also waiting for the doors to open. But as soon as 5:30 hit, we were seated right away even without making a prior reservation.\nWe took a seat with the menu already on our table, so it was zero time wasted before taking a look at the selections. \nI knew beforehand that the prices would be higher than an average Thai restaurant. It has a Michelin star, and many other upscale Thai restaurants around the city have around the same price. I was extremely interested in the rabbit green curry since I've never had rabbit before. My boyfriend got the boat trip which had been noted on the menu that it's not for Thai food beginners. We also ordered sticky rice separately since the entrees did not include rice.\nThe food arrived fairly quickly, and I'm sure we were the first to order so that made sense. I was delighted. \nThe boat trip came in a bowl filled with raw veggies (green bean, radishes, purple cabbage, cucumber, carrots, kumquat(?), mango slices, and fried greens. The smaller bowl included contained shrimp paste that was extremely strong in taste and spiciness. The warning was right, not for beginners. It was overall a healthy and still challenging dish that will make your breath the last thing your date wants to kiss! :)\nMy green curry was quite enjoyable. The rabbit was  tender, fall off the bone, not gamey, and great in portion. The rabbit meatball was my favorite in this dish. The curry was also very spicy; it lingers on your taste buds. I loved the jalape\u00f1o pieces embedded within the curry. \nThe sticky rice was a bit tough to dig my fork into,  they stuck alright. I'd go with the regular white rice next time.\nThe server was very pleasant and attentive. She was smiling during the service and that's always nice to see. We didn't feel rushed even though many customers came in through the door during our meal.\nI would love to try this place again when given the chance, as long as I arrive before dinner service or make a reservation. It's not the place for a big party without a reservation ahead. I'd also like to try their lunch menu one day.", "author": "Alice S."}

Its entrance is through a hallway that looks similar to a service hallway. Regardless of the strange location though, the food and drinks were on point. They serve some common Thai dishes that you would expect (i.e. pad thai), but I would definitely recommend trying a few of the more different ones. I thoroughly enjoyed every single dish we got.\n\n1) Mushroom hor mok terrine (curry mousse in a jar) - This was so unique! It's literally... curry.. mousse in a jar. It comes with crip rice cakes to scoop the curry mousse onto. The \"mousse\" was so flavorful but not overwhelming, with a subtle taste from the mushrooms.\n\n2) Pretty hot wings - Spicier than you would expect, but so good! They don't cut the entire wing into the wingtip, the wing, and the drumette though, so it's just one big double-jointed piece, which through me off a little bit.\n\n3) Massaman nuea (braised beef cheeks in curry) - Amazing! This is a must get! I've gotten it twice now. Once again, the presentation caught me off guard, because it is just one VERY large piece of beef cheek sitting in a curry. Regardless, the beef cheek was so incredibly tender. I didn't need a knife at all, and the meat was basically melting in my mouth. The curry / sauce itself was also delicious and is amazing over rice.\n\nI also tried two of the cocktails: the farang 75 and the artist's reward. Both were well-balanced and great.

This was much appreciated as several of the dishes were pretty spicy.\n\nFood (Five dishes and a side of sticky rice shared family style for three was plenty.)\n\nKhao Kan Jin - This dish required some instructions. First, you unwrap the steamed rice/pork/blood sausage from the banana leaf and then you mix in the accompaniments (freshly fried garlic chips being one of them). The blood sausage was not too strong and all the different ingredients blended well together to create a very flavorful dish. This ended up being one of my favorites.\n\nNam Tok Beans - This dish also came with instructions. We were to wrap the beans in the lettuce leaves provided. Though chili is listed in the description, this was probably the most mild or 0 heat dish that we had. \n\nPlah Pla Muek (Squid) - Squid was tender but the seafood sauce was really spicy (probably 10/10 though they do not list spiciness level)! Next time I'd ask if the sauce can be served on the side. This one had us craving more of the beans. I had scooped some of this sauce on my own plate so I continued to eat it with the rest of the dishes.. oops. It was good sauce but I also needed a lot of water to recover.\n\nYaowaraj Noodle - These noodles also had a hint of heat, but not at the level of the seafood sauce that came with the squid. This was good but not as memorable as the other four dishes that you don't normally see at Thai restaurants.\n\nKhun Yai's Rabbit Green Curry - This curry was spicy as well but not as spicy as that seafood sauce on the squid.

Definitely make reservations as this place gets extraordinarily crowded. \n\nI went with just one friend and we were both impressed at how quickly the food came out and how DELICIOUS the food was! We got the pork belly which was honestly some of the best pork belly I've ever had in my life! I HIGHLY recommend it with a side of sticky rice - life changing. We also got a noodle dish (I can't remember the name :/) that blew me away - super flavorful and unique.\n\nOne small caveat is that I would say their dishes tend to be on the saltier/greasiest side, so if you're not a fan of that type of food (which in general Thai food is), I'm not sure how much you'd enjoy their dishes. I'm sure not all of their dishes are extra salty and greasy, but I would assume that many are.\n\nThe location is convenient to get to - right under a hotel on the ground floor. The ambience was great - a little crowded and loud, so probably better for a group dinner than an intimidate date night. The service was impressively quick and the food was sublime. \n\nI highly recommend checking this place out if you're a thai lover - one of the best thai places I've had in the whole Bay Area!", "author": "Steven L."}

To the point that I thought they were giving us one portion instead of two. \n\nThe food was hit or miss tonight. \nWe had the pre fixe menu. \n\nTom yum soup- 1/5 too salty. Too much fish sauce or shrimp paste. Not much substance. Just a mushroom or two and a stalk of lemongrass. \n\nNam Tok Beans- 2/5 too salty. Tasted like roasted garbanzo beans. The sticky rice it came with was so hard and dry that I had to send it back. \n\nDirty girl tomatoes- 5/5 slightly salty. Wish they had given us more. Plate was the size of a teacup saucer. For two people!! tomatoes were sweet and vibrant. They also were almost ruined by heavy salting. \n\nPork belly- 5/5. This made the meal!! Delicious, unctuous pork belly, sweet and savory at the same time. Hot and bubbling in a cast iron cocotte. A must try. Only two pieces. I could have eaten a whole slab!\n\nPlah Meuk (squid)- 4/5 tender squid, slightly tart, tasty!\n\nBrussels sprouts in XO sauce- 3/5. Too salty. Roasted just right but the heavy salt killed it. XO sauce was too much but I guess I just don't like dried scallop or dried shrimp. Mostly it was the salt that weighed it down. \n\nRabbit curry- 4/5. The piece de resistance! Or supposed to be. Rabbit was tender but cooked a slight bit too long because the meat was ever so slightly stringy. Tasted more like pork than delicate rabbit. Meatballs were in the description. We got 2. Very small meatballs. \n\nThai ice tea soft serve 5/5 super delicious with coconut flakes and forbidden rice on the bottom. \n\nWe came with two kids after visiting the museum of ice cream so we were very grateful to have a reservation to rest our tired feet.

Arrived around 1:00PM on a weekday, the restaurant itself is not packed however we waited for around 5 mintues until me and my friends are being seated by a waiter. The menu were being placed on the dining table after we sat down as usual, and the waiter walked away immediately without asking if we want anything to drink. That is fine.... Then we waited 15 mintues until he came back to us and take order. \n\nMe and my friend started to order, she asked for water and I asked again to make sure he got our order. \nSo when i said please give me water, he impatiently said \"you said it twice.\" Fell like he is really rude and impatient but okay... I was thinking , if the food is good i will not complain. \nI ordered the chicken with jasmine rice. It cost around $17 if i remember correctly and it came with a soup. \n\nThe soup are salty, and the portion of the chicken rice are small. Although it is good for one person, I do not eat that much but i still feel hungry afterwards. Three pieces of chicken are given  YES, THREE PIECES. The chicken meat are rough, not fresh and it is tasteless. There are sauces next to the rice, without the sauces the chicken are really just plain boil chicken with nothing special. \nMy friend got the fried flat noodles with chicken, sorry I don't remember the dishes name . \nHer fried flat noodle with egg and chicken taste ordinary as well , it cost around $19. \n\nI asked the same waiter for some tissue napkin to wipe my mouth.. Guess what type of napkin he gave me? Those where you can get in the washroom , toilet paper napkin.... I was so surprised, one michelin star restaurant giving washroom paper napkin for customers? I have NEVER EVER encounter such bad service. \n\nAsked for the bill, around $50 for both of us. They charged us 18% gratitude directly, these kind of service expect 18% tips? I asked him why is it included, as in customer are free to tip accordingly. He took the check and said because foreigner do not tips so they have to included . Okay.. But we are locals.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-05-17", "description": "We went here this past weekend after my fiance had been talking about coming here for several months.\n\nI'm generally a big Thai-food fan and I didn't know it going in, but this isn't an authentic Thai restaurant.  It's not necessarily a Thai-fusion either, so I suppose I would call it a modern twist on Thai cuisine.\n\nOn a Saturday night, it was fairly busy but since we came at 5:30 PM right when they opened we had no difficulty getting a table without a reservation.\n\nFor the two of us, we had three dishes, a Mai Thai and glass of wine.\n\nHere's a breakdown of our experience with each of the dishes:\n- Pad Kee Mao (aka Drunken Noodles): These were quite amazing here, actually.  It was a little spicy but not overly spicy and came with ground pork, which was seasoned quite well.  I don't think I've ever had ground pork that was quite this tasty.\n- Khao Kan Jin (aka the banana wrapped blood sausage): The sausage came with toasted garlic (which was perfectly toasted and quite good), shallots, cilantro and lime.  I think we both liked the idea of this dish and the presentation was cool with the banana leaf and all.  However, once we mixed everything together and put some lime juice on top as we were told to do the dish was underwhelming and lacking in flavor.\n- Pretty Hot Wings: These were fairly large compared to most wings at other restaurants, which was good.  They were pretty messy but the sauce itself was nicely savory and tangy, but not sweet.\n\nThe restaurant is in a hotel and it can be a bit snug if all the tables are filled up.  Since it is in the hotel, there is no bathroom in the actual restaurant so you have to walk near the front desk of the hotel to go to the bathroom.\n\nOverall, I would just say that it was \"okay\".  I think I was expecting more given the hype (Michelin star, many people waiting outside for it to open, etc.), so I was planning to be blown away.\n\nI may come back again just to try one of the curries since it said in the menu that they're made from scratch daily.  However, at least after this initial visit, my expectations aren't very high.", "author": "Jennifer T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-26", "description": "(4.5 stars) So honestly, had no idea this was a Michelin star restaurant when I made reservations here...\n\nAnyways, just be wary... it's SUPER spicy. If anything even mentions that there's spice, check with your waiter to potentially get that spice level knocked down a few levels. We didn't say anything and we were in shock and asking for more rice and water. It's really \"Thai Spicy\" as far as I can tell.\n\nThe servings are really small (for everything but the curries) and shared family style so expect to order a least 1 dish per person. \n\nWhat to get:\n\nCaramelized Pork Belly: This was some of the best pork belly I've had in a long while. Part of it may be due to the more \"Asian\" style of cooking so that the meat is tender and juicy opposed to getting dried out. I was so sad there were only 4 pieces! Super flavorful that you'll want to mix the \"juice/sauce\" into your rice until you realize that it's basically just a ton of melted fat from the pork belly.\n\nKhun Yai's Rabbit Green Curry: I was pleasantly surprised the how much rabbit meat they have in this curry. Rather than just a few chunks here and there, it was large pieces, some that even had bone in it. Delicious green curry with a kick. The first mouthful was amazing until I started to realize my lips were stinging from the heat. I would suggest going for medium spice levels to still get that original flavor but be more manageable on the mouth - because really, you want to be eating more curry than rice. \n\nStir-Fried Baby Choy Sum (V): Simple sauteed veggie dish with a flavoring of light soy sauce and garlic. Sure my mom could cook this at home for me but when served with all the very flavorful and spicy foods, this side is refreshing to the palate. It could perhaps do with a little less soy sauce for my personal taste though. \n\nYaowaraj Noodle: Without the standard pad thai or pad kee mao, this noodle dish steps in as homely and satisfying. The rice noodles are hearty and full of flavor. There's also a small dish of chili oil that you can add. Don't get me wrong, it's delicious, but when I found out how spicy other dishes were, I decided to hold off. \n\nPotentially skip:\n\nCrispy Squid Nam Makham: The worst thing about this dish was how SMALL it was! Literally it was like a few tiny pieces of squid. It's plated beautifully and very colorful. I loved the balance of flavors. But there just wasn't enough of it justifying paying for this dish again. \n\nKua Kling Ribs: So maybe some people will really like this. It has bold flavors, it's flaming red, and there's a decent amount of meat on each rib. But it'll likely leave your lips and mouth on fire. It's really kind of an ugly dish as it's just red blobs covered in some red particle things. I wasn't a fan of the spices, but that might just be personal preference. The meat also just wasn't as tender as I would have liked to see. Given that the pork belly was so good, I expected these to really hit the spot as well. Unfortunately, it was a total miss. Towards the end, it was just unbearable and no one wanted to eat these.", "author": "Liza X."}

We stayed at the Parc 55, so we opted for this place as it was conveniently located a few floors under our room. With no reservations on a Saturday night, we were seated immediately around 9 P.M.\n\nIt's a hip place with a casual environment. Not reading much into the reviews, I had no idea that it was a Michelin starred restaurant. It's family-style, but the portion sizes are small. It's also not your traditional Thai restaurant and you can expect to spend a little more here. Between the three of us, we shared the Pretty Hot Wings, Plah Pla Muek and Black Cod Taypo Curry with a side of white rice. The wings ($12 for 3) were good, but nothing special in my opinion. The Plah Pla Muek ($16) is charred Monterey Bay squid; this dish was tasty, spicy and had a robust flavor. It also quickly disappeared as there were only 7-8 bite-sized pieces. As for the curry, it was delicious (and spicy)! There were so many flavors and the fish was cooked perfectly. I was really pleased with this dish, but was it worth $37? Not so sure.\n\nThe service was only okay. Our waiter took time to talk about recommendations, but was visibly frustrated afterward when we were indecisive.

As I was eating my wings, I was trying to absorb as much of the flavor as I could. Citrus, sweet, spicy, it was all there, glazed smoothly on a lightly cooked chicken wing. \n\nNext came the Pad Kee Mao, and wow, it was spicy. Overall, I didn't think the Pad Kee Mao was that impressive. The noodles are thinner than most places, which I thought was a nice touch, and the flavors are sharper than most Thai places, but I thought it was just different, not necessarily better.\n\nAfter my first experience at Kin Khao, I decided to give it another try since I didn't get to try a lot of dishes on the rest of the menu. This time, we ordered a Pad Kee Mao again, but also had a Pork Belly and a Rockfish. The Pad Kee Mao was actually better this time, because the meat was juicier and there was more oil on the dish. The pork belly was a really nice comfort dish, as the soft and savory pork belly felt like butter in my mouth. \n\nThe big dish for the night was the Rockfish. The sauce used to marinate the fish was pretty good, but I thought the fish meat wasn't all that great. I guess it's dependent on the fish itself too, but the fish meat wasn't that tender and was more on the tougher side. Overall, with the sauces, the fish was a really fun experience to eat. Beware though, if you don't like fish bones.\n\nKin Khao was a nice start to my (hopefully) future Michelin star restaurant experiences. It's a casual and bustling place with food that's packed with as much energy as the atmosphere. For the price, no other Michelin star place in SF can beat this place.

Good thing the combination of Idaho G vodka, chareau liquer, lime and blue flowers worked together. On the other hand, the Artist's Reward with mezcal, maraschino and grapefruit is more up my alley.\n\nWe covered the food section extensively well since there were 6 ravenous yelpers who came together on this meal. If you try pronouncing the names in Thai, it becomes a silly tongue twister game! Sai ua + namprik noom (grilled house made pork sausage paired nicely with crunchy cracklings), kua kling ribs (turmeric curry seasoned pork ribs; beware of the huge chili!) plah pla muek (charred squid in a spicy/tangy seafood sauce), yao waraj noodle and laab tod. I know pork belly is a dish that every single chef has cooked and presented on their menus a zillion times, but here's a voluptous pork belly that's caramelized perfectly and offsets the spiciness of all of Kin Khao's dishes. Even if you hate pork, you should order this dish just as a palate cleanser! And for a sweet, calming ending, the black rice pudding is to die for. Down to earth, casual, simple. Just like the girl next door.\n\nAdmittedly, the items I enjoyed the most were the cocktails (a given) and dessert (surprise!) this was probably due to the fact that I'm a wuss when it comes to anything spicy. Plus, after sampling a couple of these dishes, not only was I sweating my balls off (if I had balls), my taste buds were pretty much shot and nothing else can bring me back except for the pork belly to cleanse my palate ;)\n\nKin Khao is best explored with an excited, open mind.

It definitely lived up to the high expectations in my head... but I will warn you that this place is expensive!\n\nFirst of all, based on the prices, I expected a fancier looking restaurant, but Kin Khao is actually pretty casual.  That being said, they are very busy and you need a reservation to get seated -- call ahead!\n\nKin Khao has an awesome cocktail list, so my group of four started there... amongst the group, we tried some of the Session cocktails, a Tom Yum, and a special lemonade that turned purple (for the pregnant one in the group!)  Everyone was pleased with their orders.\n\nWe then ordered way too much food, including the following:\n\n-House-made pickles\n-Yum Yai Salad\n-Pretty Hot Wings\n-Mushroom Terrine**\n-Caramelized Pork Belly**\n-Vegetable Panang\n-Yaowaraj Noodle (Vegetarian Style)**\n-Crab Curry\n-Sticky Rice\n-Black Rice Pudding\n\nThe only thing that was not good was the side of chicken stock, which I did not even list above.  Everything else was a winner... especially those items with asterisks above!  If you are on the fence deciding what to order, do not miss the Mushroom Terrine, Caramelized Pork Belly, and Yaowaraj Noodle!\n\nThis is a rich meal, and many of the items have a kick, but it's some of the best Thai you'll experience.  Probably not the best place for kids or picky eaters, but if you're feeling adventurous, go check it out (after you make your reservation, of course.)  I will not hesitate to return!", "author": "Gabi M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-01", "description": "TLDR - very fancy Thai, pricey but interesting interpretation of unique Thai dishes\n\nI've been here both for lunch and dinner now. The menus are different for lunch and dinner and seem to change seasonally as well. I'd definitely recommend making a reservation beforehand, especially for dinner. The address says it's located on Cyril Magnin, but it's actually kind of hidden at the corner of Mason and Ellis.\n\nThe space felt like a modern interpretation of a Thai shophouse. Not very big. Mostly a lot of small tables and one larger communal table. \n\nKin Khao definitely isn't your typical authentic Thai (or even just fancy Thai) place. The menu doesn't really have the usual Thai food like pad thai or the normal curries. Instead, they feature more unique dishes you'd find in certain regions of Thailand, like khao soi, sai ua and namprik noom. They aren't quite the authentic version of those dishes, but they're still a delicious interpretation of them. Prices are expensive for Thai, but on par with a typical meal in SF.\n\n*** DINNER ***\n\n-MUSHROOM HOR MOK TERRINE ($14) - 5/5\n[curry mousse in-a-jar with mushrooms, crisp rice cakes]\nIf I hadn't had fish amok in Thailand, I probably wouldn't have been drawn to the idea of curry mousse and probably would've skipped over this on the menu, especially since there's no meat. But whatever you do, ORDER THIS. The mousse had the most amazing texture - so smooth and silky - and was super flavorful - coconutty curry with a slight kick.\n\n-YUM KAI DAO ($10) - 3/5\n[fried duck egg, chili jam dressing, peanuts, shallots, mint, cilantro]\nMeh, kind of anticlimactic. The egg had a nice runny, gooey yolk, but it just felt like a normal poached egg with crunchy bits from the frying and a sweet, spicy sauce on the side.\n\n-LAAB TOD ($17) - 3.5/5\n[spicy, herb-y pork meatballs served with jaew sauce, veggies, sticky rice]\nOkay. The meatballs were a little on the dry side and not particularly flavorful. Kind of awkward to eat because the lettuce they were served with weren't big enough for wraps.\n\n-KUA KLING RIBS ($16) - 4.5/5\n[spicy, dry-fried pork riblets in southern-style turmeric curry paste, kaffir lime leaves]\nhot tender flavorful\nMMM another must get! They definitely aren't shy with the spicy rub on these ribs. Full of flavor, packed with heat. Pretty tender (could be better) and fatty.\n\n*** LUNCH ***\n\n-PAD KEE MAO ($18) - 3/5\n[spicy stir-fried drunken noodles with ground pork, rice noodles, garlic, birds eye chili, onions, bell peppers, holy basil]\nNot super special. The noodles had a nice soft, chewy texture, and there was a good portion of pork and plenty of basil. The chili added some heat but I (and anyone from Thailand) would've liked it a LOT spicier. Not bad, but a little on the bland side. My biggest problem was that it was VERY greasy. The lime helped lighten it up a little, but the noodles I had in Thailand were never nearly as greasy.\n\n-KHAO SOI ($18) - 4.5/5\n[northern-style chicken curry broth, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, and spicy chili oil (on the side)]\nIf I hadn't had legit khao soi in Chiang Mai before, I probably would've given this a 5. Kin Khao's version isn't quite as flavorful as the Thai version, but it's solid. The curry broth was pretty flavorful and wasn't too thick or rich (which probably means it had less coconut milk and was actually healthier), but was lacking a LOT on terms of heat. The spicy chili oil didn't add much and the restaurant didn't have red chili flakes/powder instead, just sriracha. The crispy noodles on top contrasted well with the chewy noodles in the broth, and the chicken was tender but rather flavorless.", "author": "Jessie L."}

We were looking for a place nearby that was open after 8 pm on a Sunday.  It got good reviews, so I was hopeful, though many times, higher-end places like this lack flavor.  Not the case here.  I wish we had more appetite to try more things, but my friend and I got two dishes:  the wild boar laab and the fried scarlet runner beans (Rancho Gordo!).  The waitress recommended 3-4 dishes but two was just the right amount since these are relatively generous portions.  The standout for me was the beans, which had a crazy dressing they were tossed on, very limey and very addictive.  I've never had beans that way and I want them again!  The wild boar was good, but a bit too spicy for my taste (though the waitress warned us, to be fair).  We got both brown and sticky rice.  The brown rice was in a cute turquoise metal pot, which was also awesome to keep it warm!  We also got two soft drinks--the turmeric soda (SO GOOD!) and the blue flower lemonade (good, but I wish I had gotten the turmeric soda).  Also, the very nice hostess saw that it was my friend's bachelorette weekend and sat us at a nice 4-top by the window--which was a nice touch!  \"Hm, not bad for a hotel restaurant!\" we joked.  I recommend if you're in the area.  By the way, bathroom is located in the hotel lobby, which is a bit of a trek.", "author": "Kati P."}

In a sense- it's a typical San Franciscan place, trendy, cute, expensive for smaller quantities, located right next to the Parc 55 hotel. But, it's pretty darn good! At least what I tried. I went on Tuesday evening so the wait was only about 5 minutes for bar seating. But its a fairly small place, so reservations are necessary if you have a large group. \n\nI wasn't planning on getting a drink, but the cocktails looked so darn good, and the bartender was so nice, I just had to try one (even at the $13 price tag). So i got the tom yum- one of the more popular drinks and it was delish! Very refreshing, just sweet enough but also with a good amount of alcohol! My kind of drink! The Kathoey Collins also looked good- so pretty with the blue flower coloring in it, Will definitely get this next time!\n\nFor food, we didn't want to over order so we tried the mushroom terrine and the pork belly. The terrine was definitely something I've never tried. I wasn't expecting it to be so moussey- maybe I should have read the description better! But it was definitely fun to try. Taste wise- it's decent, not too creamy, but you still taste the coconut and the rice crispies are fun to eat them on. However, I probably would not ever crave this again- good to try and share amongst friends. \n\nThe pork belly was omg SO GOOD. It was caramelized to perfection- just enough of the burnt sweet smoked flavor and the sauce was so good. Fatty and meaty, I was just sad that there were only 4 pieces. I savored every last bite. This is a must get! \n\nThe rice was more than enough for two of us to share. We probably could have ordered one more dish as everything was a bit small, but I'm glad I was left wanting more as I will want to come back to try many more dishes!\n\nThey have fixed price menu for $55- this seems like a good deal to try a variety of dishes, I would be interested in coming back for a celebration to try it out.\n\nWill be back!", "author": "Vivian D."}

I'll start with a recent visit to Kin Khao, the recently Michelin-starred, unassuming Thai establishment nestled into a boutique hotel with little signage but lots of flavor.\n\nWith dining, I have a general high-low philosophy, which constitutes a high willingness to pay for quote-unquote haute cuisine like French or Japanese, but wallet stinginess on standard fare like Chinese or American diner dining. As such, I have a hard time properly judging non-Japanese fine Asian cuisine restaurants like Kin Khao. My experience there so directly recalled a dinner last year at Chicago's Parachute, a Korean restaurant which has made as many celebratory reviewer gains as Kin Khao. That experience in a nutshell? Really good food, hard to swallow bill.\n\nThe wife and I did a late lunch at Kin Khao, which constituted of two non-alcoholic beverages, a starter, and two main dishes. While the bill was not remarkably extravagant, it will still a cut above your standard Thai lunch to be had, for example, at a dingy-looking place called Siam right across the street. I understand all the arguments: finer preparation, better ingredients, higher rents, et cetera and so forth. Still.\n\nIf you'll excuse my two paragraph diatribe, I'll now get to the tastiness of the food. The drinks--Thai Tea and Coffee--were both really good, with a lighter hand on the condensed milk and sugar content than is the American standard. The only miss of the meal for me was the heralded mushroom hor mok, a \"terrine\" mousse with a chunky, cottage cheese texture. The flavor profile was not enough mushroom and too much spice, though the latter was dulled by the relatively tasteless rice cakes. I like the effort but didn't love the execution.\n\nI can't say the same for the two entrees we ordered. The wife, a curry fanatic, immediately navigated to the Khao Soi, a chicken-based curry broth, while I waffled between the Khao Mun Gai chicken rice and the Pork Bowl, ultimately opting for the former. Both the wife and I are half-Singaporean, and both dishes immediately recalled our motherland. Hers, a wonderfully flavored curry accompanied by egg noodles with the perfect spring and step, reminded us of laksa. Mine, simply prepared boneless chicken breast, Hainan chicken.\n\nTo be honest, I'd still favor Singaporean-style Hainan chicken rice, where the rice is a vibrant yellow and the bone-in chicken doused in brown soy sauce mixture. But holy moly, Kin Khao's \"secret sauce\", which so perfectly pairs with the melt-in-your-mouth chicken, has me giving serious thought to switching sides. I also can't forget to plug the chicken broth, just pure broth with hints of ginger and salt, easy to slurp and delightfully refreshing.\n\nFinally, both dishes were thoroughly elevated by a splash of Kin Khao's chili vinegar. Don't forget about this, folks. It's hidden in a concealed ramekin next to the silverware, and comes highly recommended by yours truly. I especially recommend it splashed in the broth (either the plain chicken or the spicy curry) or paired with the secret sauce atop the chicken fat rice. I'm sure it has its place amongst the other dishes as well.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

Sumptuous mousse slathered on rice cakes - basically the perfect way to start a fabulous meal.

Supremely flavorful and the perfect amount to share.\n\nBut, damn, that black cod taypo curry. The star of the show (although the mushroom terrine was a close second). Creamy coconut curry, sticky rice (which we had to order separately ahem) and the main attraction - a poached black cod filet. Delightful.\n\nAt $12 apiece, cocktails were potent and creative, especially the Artist's Reward (a gorgeous elixir with montelobos mezcal, maraschino, grapefruit, lime, peychaud bitters, szechuan pepper salt) and the Farang 75 with pisco, velvet falernum, lemon, cava, and ginger.\n\nSure, there was a bit of sticker shock at the bill, but man, did Kin Khao deliver.", "author": "Emily C."}

It's located on the corner of Mason and Ellis, tucked inside one of the back exit hallways of the Parc 55 Hotel. But if you do find Kin Khao, then you will have just come across one of the best no-frills one-star Michelin restaurants in the entire city.\n\nKin Khao is not a fancy place. In fact, its spare, contemporary decor has kind of an IKEA restaurant quality to it. But despite its casual, simple appearance, the food at Kin Khao is both dynamic and complex. And it's absolutely mouthwateringly delicious.\n\nFor starters, I highly recommend the Som Tum Papaya Salad ($10). It's sweet, sour, salty, and spicy, hitting all the sensual corners of your tongue. Too many Thai restaurants serve watered down versions of this Northern Thai dish, but this version was very close to what I enjoyed in Bangkok, so it's a must-order for me every time. Eat it with Sticky Rice ($4) and they will know that you're not an amateur.\n\nAnother must-order dish for me is the Pretty Hot Wings ($12). It's a mess to eat, but they give you an extra napkin to clean up afterwards. This too is sour, salty, savory, and spicy, and it's bound to induce a primal grunting at the table as you voraciously devour its succulent flesh. But it's one of those dishes that you will be craving for long after.\n\nI'm also a fan of the Caramelized Pork Belly ($17). The pork is super tender, and the glaze is like Thai BBQ sauce. And the Yaowaraj Noodles ($19) are pretty good too, especially with the spicy vinegar.\n\nThe Khao Mun Gai ($17) here is one of the better versions I have had, but to be honest, I feel the sauce could have had a more gingery punch. The chicken fat rice, however, is both comforting and extravagant at the same time.\n\nFor dessert, give the Black Rice Pudding ($10) a try. It's different, but it's actually a lot better than it sounds.\n\nWhen it comes to Thai food in SF, there are a lot of good options. But without question, Kin Khao is one of the very best of them.", "author": "Paul L."}

I normally dislike going to Thai restaurants because I am very particular about the way I like my Thai food. But after coming to Kin Khao for dinner, I came back for their lunch as well\n\nFor dinner we had the House Pickles, Khao Kan Jin, Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine, Pork Cracklings, Yaowaraj Noodle, Carmelized Pork Belly, Wild Boar Laab Kua, Rabbit Green Curry, Massaman Nuea, and the Namprik Long Rua. This restaurant is definitely more conducive to eating family style in order to try different dishes. Each of the dishes is so strongly flavored that it would be difficult to eat one whole dish by yourself. The menu AND the server warned us about the Namprik Long Rua as a strongly flavorful dish that is not for beginners or people who are adverse to strong seafood smells and tastes.\n\nMy 2 favorite dishes of the day were the Terrine and Carmelized Pork Belly. Protip: order the sticky rice so that you can dip the juices from the Carmelized Pork Belly, they go really well together. \n\nI think if you want to experience good Thai food, you should order a variety of dishes and taste them with your friends. My friends also really liked the Namprik Long Rua even though it was pretty spicy and fairly strongly flavored. It went well with the fresh vegetables that they provided. They also have very good vegetarian options.\n\nMy second time here was for lunch. I got their Khao Mun Gai and it was very well priced for lunch (for a Michelin-starred restuarant). The chicken was tender and flavorful. The broth that they provided on the side was well seasoned to my taste (had some cilantro and lemon juice). The service was very good, they had plenty of good suggestions for dishes and checked in on us very often. The ambience was quiet and well lit. I would definitely go back there again for lunch or dinner. It is definitely one of the cheapest Michelin-star restaurants I have been to in SF. \n\nFIVE STARS!", "author": "Eric P."}

It's tucked away in a Hilton hotel, so it's pretty easy to miss! It's a small place with a casual cool atmosphere. I decided to try one of their cocktails- I got the artists reward, and it was tasty! Nice and strong, and it had that wonderful smokiness from the mezcal. For food, we started with the mushroom dish with the crispy rice cakes and the nam tok beans. Both dishes were great! The mushroom dish was kind of a mushroom curry, and it had a nice spicy kick to it, and the crispy rice cakes served with it were such a great idea- I thought it was a fun take on eating a curry with regular sticky rice! Those beans though, I could've eaten a huge bowl of them and been satisfied with just that. The flavors were nice and it was refreshing since it was served as a lettuce wrap! We also ended up ordering the pork belly which was super tender and nicely caramelized (the boyfriend's favorite dish), and the pretty hot wings which were tasty and actually not overly spicy! It was also a nice touch that they brought out a bowl for the chicken bones and moist towels to wipe off all that sauce from our hands! Finally, for dessert we split the black rice pudding which I think was my favorite dish. It had complex flavors with a subtle sweetness from the rice and burnt coconut sugar caramel and just enough salt to provide a wonderful contrast. The food was awesome, and for the price, we thought the portions were really reasonable! Overall, we loved our experience here and are excited to come back and try other items on the menu!", "author": "Rachel D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-22", "description": "Kin Khao is located in Parc 55 (Hilton hotel) on the 2nd floor, to the left of the hotel check-in desks. Valet parking is available: $12 for 2 hours and then $5/hr additional. Bathrooms are located in the hotel lobby just past the elevators (you do need a card key from the hostess stand to gain access). I was able to grab the last reservation for the weekend at 5:45PM on a Sun by email a little over a week prior for a party of 6. Definitely try to book in advance as there was a large wait outside when we left (especially for large groups as they do not have many tables for them). Dress is casual (you do see people in just tees).\n\nThe menu is split into 3 parts: appetizers, small entrees and large entrees. To be honest, we all thought the small and large entrees were about the same size. For parties of 7 or more, the prix fixe ($60) is required for the table. If you're not a large party and still want to order the prix fixe, the whole table would have to order it as well as it is served family-style.\n\n*~Our Order~* on 5/22/2017\nThai Iced Coffee: ($5) Wrecking Ball Cold Brew\nPickles\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine: Curry mousse in-a-jar with mushrooms, 6 crisp rice cakes\nPretty Hot Wings: Nam Pla fish sauce+garlic marinade, tamarind+Sriracha glaze. 3 pcs\nCaramelized Pork Belly: Sweet, savory, voluptuous pork belly cooked in a clay pot. 4 pcs\nWild Boar Laab Kua: Spicy northern Thai-syle laab, housemade 'prik laab' chili blend, raw shallots, fried shallots, garlic chips, green onions, cilantro, pak pai\nYaowaraj Noodle: Bangkok Chinatown stir-fried rice noodles with chicken, XO sauce, egg, green onions, cilantro\nNamprik Long Rua: Spicy, umami-bomb Kapi shrimp paste relish, served with caramelized pork jowl, crispy Passmore ranch catfish, seasonal vegetables\nMassaman Nuea: Braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes\nButternut Squash Panang: Roasted butternut squash in panang curry, coconut milk, makrut lime, Thai basil, peanuts\n\nThe pickles came out 1st and was quite tart. I really enjoyed the Mushroom Hor Mok as it was pretty much really thick curry, but about half the table preferred it without the rice cakes. I've had the fish sauce wings from Pok Pok in Portland, OR and while I do like the Pretty Hot Wings more, I think I'm coming to the conclusion that I really don't like fish sauce wings (and I'm part Vietnamese so I do cook with it a lot). They are quite meaty tho as well as tender & juicy. The Caramelized Pork Belly comes in a very cute cast iron pot that has a little pig for the lid's handle. The pieces were more fat than meat so several people really enjoyed it, but I prefer more meat. BF loved the pork belly so much, he ended up ordering another for just him and one other person (the 3rd dish wasn't as good as the 1st 2 for some reason tho). The Wild Boar Laab Kua is eaten like a lettuce wrap and was on the dry side. \n\nThe Yaowaraj Noodle was just OK and not a \"must order\" dish. I did not like the Namprik Long Rua and my BF ended up being the only person eating it. My favorite dish was the Massaman Nuea. The meat was extremely tender and the curry very strong (as well as a bit spicy). The Butternut Squash Panang was also very good with the squash easily broken by chopsticks.\n\nThe Thai Iced Coffee is very sweet but does have that slight chocolately flavor that I enjoy.\n\nService wasn't overbearing but water carafes were constantly replaced and empty dishes quickly cleared without asking. It was still easy to flag someone over for anything we needed.\n\nI've had this place bookmarked for ages and only because a friend said this place was possibly better than Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas that my BF wanted to try this place. While we loved some dishes, my BF and I didn't think it was nearly as good as Lotus of Siam. Since there are quite a few Thai restaurants that we haven't tried in SF, Kin Khao is not a \"must return\" for us yet.\n\nIf you go, definitely order the Massaman Nuea, Butternut Squash Panang and Caramelized Pork Belly.", "author": "Kitty K."}

What's amazing is the combination of flavors that the chef provides (Salty,  sweet, citrus, earthy-umami).\nSo the first main opener, they give you 3 types of dishes together and all three compliments each other so that you're not overwhelm with how sweet or spicy one dish over the other. Each dish really pairs well with each other and has a perfect balance. \n\nNow of course if you don't order the fix menu, your experience will be different because you will be ordering things that might not balance well with another dish. So if you were to order a .. pork dish and after 3-4 bites in you might experience \"oh man this is good but it's so.. heavy or overwhelming in the umami so I'm going to eat a chicken wing \" - well duh it's overwhelming. You need to counter that with something citrusy to clean your palate.\n\nI have never encounter a well balanced Thai fix menu ever, unless I spend an airline ticket to go to Thailand.

As such this place is really good for groups (also because you can try a lot of stuff as a group) and its served family style, a trend lately. I love thai food but have gotten sick of the same old coconut curries and phat Thai that every single restaurant makes pretty much identical. Kin Khao does everything different.

Kin Khao is what I like to call FANCY Thai food.  I had previously tried their food through a dinner service called Din and both meals I ordered were fantastic.  Kin Khao is for adventurous eaters like me.  Sean C. and I had reservations at 7 pm on a Friday evening.  Even when we arrived on time, they were still waiting for a table to clear in order to seat us.  Reservations are key.  Other people were waiting outside when we arrived and we were seated before them.  \n\nWe ordered a few cocktails to start.  I had the Vodka Collins while he tried the Artist's Reward.  Perusing the menu, we asked our server for recommendations.  She recommended the Namprik Long Rua which was shrimp paste relish, served with caramelized pork jowl, crispy catfish, and seasonal vegetables.  It was a beautiful presentation.  You mix up the bowl of shrimp, pork, and fish, then you eat it with the vegetables and rice.  There's an umami explosion of flavors in your mouth.  I was in love with the salty, bitter, spicy, sweetness, and sour flavors.  The vegetables vary and included: radishes, tomatillos, carrots, fried eggplant, tempura green beans, wax beans, etc.  Some of the vegetables were raw while others were cooked.  The change in textures also won me over as well as the flavors.  \n\nSean C. ordered the Black Cod curry which was spicy on the onset but the coconut flavors were on point.  This was one of the best curries I've ever had!  They don't ask you how spicy, they just make it spicy which is why I love it so!  We also had rice on the side to sop up all the delicious sauces.  We both fully enjoyed this meal.  We kept trying a little of both entrees and were rewarded with amazing flavors.  My tastebuds rejoiced.  For dessert, we had the black rice pudding that came with coconut milk, caramel sauce, and crispy rice & crushed peanuts.  The rice pudding by itself was bland but by mixing in the sides, you came away with a balance of sweet, salty, crunchy & soft.  It was delicious and a wonderful end to our amazing meal.

Overall I found the food not worth the wait or price despite being a decent meal. This is what I sampled:\n\n- Spicy pork ribs: This is not for the light-hearted. Despite growing up in a family where raw jalapenos and Sriracha were a mainstay, this was way too spicy for me. It was a thick crust of powdered burning spice and it didn't help that the mean was so thin around the bone and dry that there wasn't much to balance out the heat. Even the cocktail and sticky rice couldn't save us.\n\n- Pad Kee Mao: The noodles were cooked well but honestly I felt the sauce was too sweet and without depth. \n\n- Vegeterian noodles with vegan XO sauce and Tofu: Again I felt the sauce was too sweet although I appreciated the pickled chili peppers. The noodles also seemed a bit overcooked because they were shaped more like shreds than sheets. \n\nOverall I would likely not return given all the other options I have in the City.

If you order the prix fixe, it is for the entire party so keep that in mind if you're considering this as an option.\n\nHere's what I thought was memorable:\n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine: I think this was my favorite, which is some mushroom paste/spread thing served with crispy rice. The crispy rice was sooooo good and crunchy. If you've ever had 'guo ba' it reminded me of that. \n\nYum Polamai: This is a savoury fruit salad. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would! The way the sweetness of the fruit balances out the savoury portions like shallots and the dressing worked surprisingly well. I thought this was a really unique dish - would recommend trying it!\n\nCaramelized pork belly: I also enjoyed the caramelized pork belly! Granted, it's pretty hard to mess up pork belly but it was still delicious and worth pointing out. \n\nThey serve their tasting menu with regular rice and sticky rice, and I LOVE sticky rice! I probably wouldn't go here again because the flavor profile doesn't match my personal preferences, but I can see why this place is popular!", "author": "Theresa L."}

I think this place is a bit overpriced for the ambience, but that being said, the food is good.  It is a restaurant located within the Parc 55 hotel.  We ordered the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine, Sai Ua + Namprik Noom, Yaowaraj Noodle, and Black Cod Taypo Curry.  Here are the deets on each dish:\n\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine - The taste is very reminiscent of Mama noodles - tom yum flavor if you've ever had it.  Not to say that is artificial tasting or bad in anyway.  Actually, I really enjoyed it! I love the crispy rice cakes that were paired with the terrine.  This was a bit spicy, but not enough to rattle my cages (for spice reference, I eat Sambal and Sriracha often with my meals).  I would go back and order this dish again! My favorite among what we ordered.\n\nSai Ua + Namprik - This dish is not spicy at all.  I really enjoyed the sausage and the pork rinds.  You make a lettuce wrap with the all the components offered on the plate.  The flavor was very fresh and the sausage had good flavor.\n\n\nYaowaraj Noodle -  This dish isn't spicy and I thought it was the most mediocre dish.  I think the flavors didn't wow me and it was a $19 noodle dish.  Not my favorite.\n\nBlack Cod Taypo Curry - The flavors are so complex and the cod fish was cooked perfectly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-26", "description": "Since this was my first Michelin star experience, I had the vague expectation that Kin Khao would entail super dressed up diners, menus full of amped up prices, my party of 3 having roughly a snowball's chance in hell of being seated without having a previous reservation...in actuality, Kin Khao nothing of the sort. We literally walked in at around 9:30pm on a Wednesday and were brought to a table right away. Despite being part of the hip Parc55 hotel lobby area, Kin Khao's restuarant space was very down to earth and approachable in decor and service. Slightly dimmer lights like that of a ambiance-full hotspot, but otherwise seating...utensils and place settings...bar area...all more on the simple/practical side than overly stylish. We were planning on just getting our own entrees and heading out, buuuutttt then we saw the pre-fixe menu...$55 for 8 dishes?!? Yea it's family style, but seriously.. the dessert alone normally runs for $11 soooooooo.. I guess we're gonna hafta just do it! LOL Here goes:\n\nMushroom hor mok terrine (curry mousse in a jar with mushrooms, crisp rice cakes)- Because of the rice cakes, you want to assume this is just some child's snack food, but trying to elegantly dip into the mousse and bite into the cake without the delicate puffs breaking apart all over proved to be quite difficult, lol! My friends didn't care for this one that much, but I rather liked the savoriness of curry, made light by the mousse form and the slivers of (kaffir?) leaf on top. Lovely!\n\nNam tok beans (ayocote morado beans tossed isaan-style with lime, chili, rice powder, light soy, shallots, scallions, mint, cilantro)- HOT. DAMN. These beans packed a SUPER heat punch! The rice powder I think helped with keeping the whole mix on the dry side, almost crisp on some parts... very mealy and filling.....the alliums made it savory enough to make us hunger for real meat! Lol.\n\nYum polamai (stone fruit salad with toasted coconut, shallots, peanuts, chili, mint, cilantro, shiso)- My picture didn't do the colors justice, but this dish was quite beautiful! A bit puzzling on flavors and textures because you don't usually come across spicy coconut, or crunchy peanut and plums with cilantro, but it works out surprisingly well! \n\nCaramelized pork belly (cooked in castiron pot)- JEEBUSSSSS. I have NEVER had such *literally* melt-in-your-mouth pork belly!....with maybe the exception of some kurobata pork belly I had with ramen ages ago, but I digress....these 3 perfect slices....*sigh*...so so so good! My tastebuds certainly won over my protesting arteries in a heartbeat. XD\n\nChili jam clams (littleneck clams in Khun Yai's chili jam and thai basil sauce)- The clams were cooked jusssttttt to the right edge of being done! I was impressed at how much juice they still had for being such little guys, haha. A little disappointed on the portion since we had to split it three ways, but nonetheless quite tasty.\n\nBlistered Chinese Long Beans in XO sauce (dried scallops/shrimp/ham ginger, garlic)- Long beans should be a simple dish, right? Like...whatever, everyone serves this! NOPE. Kin Khao elevates their beans with some serious next level schtuff...yea I'm talking that premium dried seafood and ham! Sometimes when you want that slap-in-the-face taste of umami, you just gotta use real meat to flavor your veggies! I would TOTALLY just come back just for this dish. Literally the best I ever had.\n\nMassaman Nuea (braised beef cheeks in massasamn curry past, coconut milk, burnt shallot, potatoes)- After the spotlight stealing pork belly, I was kinda iffy about trying another meat dish that couldn't possibly compare but good lawdy... these cheeks were possibly even softer than the belly! I could almost spoon my mouthful of tender beefy curry from the main hunk of cheek it was that well braised... ^___^. And the fried shallots? Pure yassss.\n\nBlack rice pudding (burnt sugar caramel, salty coconut cream, puffed rice/peanut/sesame sprinkle)- Yay for build your own dessert! After the whirlwind of salty sweet flavors, I think it was very smart of the chef to let people make their own desserts to meet their individual tastebud needs. Nothing overly sweet, salty, or oily here...just the right way to close out the night.\n\nWhew! That was a lot of food! Everyone at the table has to participate (i.e. no splitting) but, really, it's such a great deal anyway, you should just come with an empty belly and go for it! I'm coming back ASAP for a shot at their noodles and chocolate beignets!\n\n(My wallet may be in for a lot of trouble if these is how all Michelin star evenings tend to wow.)", "author": "Yen D."}

I went with two friends and between us we shared the mushroom hor mok terrine, the pork belly, and drunken noodles. The hor mok terrine was literally like putting curry from Trader Joe's on top of a plain Quaker rice cake. The pork belly was definitely extremely moist and tender - very well cooked but was extremely fatty. I feel like that is their way of skimping on the amount of actual meat they give you is by making half of the serving just the fatty part of the animal, simply to fill space in the dish. The drunken noodles with sticky rice was decent - the noodle part was very good but we all agreed that the sticky rice was extremely dry. I give it 3 stars rather than 2 or 1 because I did like what I ate but it is nowhere near the quality or level of service of any other Michelin Star restaurant I've ever been to (I think I've been to 5). So, for the price point, you can find much better food for a lot less money all over SF. As for the service, that could definitely use some improvement as well. The hostess was snooty to my friend when she arrived to get a table and they rush you out the door by clearing your plate the second you're done with it...and if you're NOT done with it then they will come back to the table every 3 minutes afterwards asking if you're finished yet.

It was tough on my return visit not to simply order the same thing again, however a menu like this deserves a full perusal. On my second visit, it was all about the spicy fresh pork cracklin's and the rabbit in green curry (\"Kiew Wan curry paste, rabbit leg + saddle, rabbit meatballs, apple eggplants, Thai basil\"). Both are impeccably constructed dishes. The curry is spicy, rich and deep in flavor. It's as close as I've had in the states to the things I ate on my visit to Thailand. The price tag is an abrasive $29 (rice not included) but damn... that's some incredible curry. \n\nService here is friendly and on point, while being fairly laid back. A style I truly appreciate. I've sat at both table and bar, and both are recommended. I think the thing I need to get past is the notion that Thai food should be cheap.

I thought this made for a great way to start the meal\nPad Kee Mao - soo good!!\nSpicy Hot Wings - exactly what they sound like.

Was tasty, but nothing that will make me come back for more. I don't understand the crazy hype, because it's very similar to my mother's cooking, but cooked and served in a fancy pot.\n\nBok Choy - Just your standard stir fry.

However, I'm not too sure what rabbit brings to the dish that another meat, like chicken would not, if cooked in a similar fashion. This was my favorite dish.\n\nDrinks: Siam Sipper is great. This is some innovative mixology: an old fashioned with a great thai spice twist. Rasa Umami was also a great choice for those of you that like a slightly stronger drink. Kathoey Collins - this drink literally tasted something like minty toothpaste mixed with vodka, and seems like a recipe a bartender would try when they initially start to try to mix their own drinks.

We ordered the spicy squid to start, which was probably the best thing we tried that night. \n\nWe also got the Namprik Long Rua (shrimp paste with caramelized pork jowl, crispy catfish, and salted duck egg). The waiter warned us that this is dish packs a punch due to the shrimp paste. I grew up eating it so I was all about it. Don't think this would be a crowd pleaser though because it's an acquired taste. I don't really understand the raw vegetables it came with though. I know you're supposed to eat it with the paste, but I didn't really think it went that well together. It was just a big plate of vegetables and thing of paste. The only way I could eat it was with rice, which was $4 for a single serving. Like y tho. We had to get two orders. I could've bought a huge bag of rice with $8. $2 I'm okay with. $4 should not be a thing. \n\nNext was the green rabbit curry. Pretty good but not worth. I know rabbit will come in at a higher price point but the curry wasn't that much more amazing than the first green curry I tried in the dorms at UCLA. \n\nI thought Kin Khaw would be my gateway into the Michelin star world, but this was so disappointing.

You are essentially getting a wing and a drumstick in one.  \n\nThe pad kee mao was my favorite dish.  Rice noodle dishes are pretty standard fare at Thai restaurants aplenty, but to get one with unique subtleties and new but unsurprising flavors definitely hits a home run in my book.\n\nThe papaya salad was a good amount of sour and spice--I am not regularly a papaya fan but this is a young green papaya so it tastes more green vegetable.  \n\nThe blue flower drink is possibly a gimmick in that it changes colors as you stir it, but the flavors are light and crisp so it is a winner as well.\n\nDon't get so full that you skimp out on dessert- the warm gooey purple/black rice pudding paired with caramel (weird but works) coconut cream and puffed rice is bomb.", "author": "Pauline M."}

It was right near our hotel and I liked it so much that I ended up going twice in a week - it was THAT good. \n\nFirst up, you're probably going to have to queue for a table. On a Wednesday night the wait was 30 minutes, on Friday night it was about an hour and half. It's worth the wait. Arrive early, leave your details with them and they'll text you when your table is ready. You can make reservations in advance. \n\nI really loved the food but there was two stand out dishes for me. Firstly, the stone fruit salad (Yum Polamai) - A savory stone fruit salad with toasted coconut, shallots, Bird's Eye chili, mint, cilantro, shiso -\u00a0which was just perfect. Light, refreshing and yet super addictive. I actually considered ordering a second one, I liked it that much. \n\nThe other dish was the Pad Kee Mao -\u00a0stir-fried drunken noodles with ground pork, rice noodles, garlic, Birds Eye chili, onions, bell peppers, holy basil. This goes perfect with the sticky rice and was just delicious -\u00a0lots of flavours going on but it all worked really well together and was just amazing. The noodles were so soft and slippery and the pork was really tender. A lovely dish. \n\nThe staff were also worth mentioning as they were all amazing. Friendly, welcoming and super professional - our waitress whipped me up a hot toddy when I mentioned I didn't feel well and they had great beer recommendations, too. \n\nDinner for two on the Wednesday night came to $90 for two starters, two mains and a beer each which I thought was really reasonable.

Expecting it to be the same dinner casual, was very surprised when the big question at the door was, \"reservations?\". Fortune was smiling on my friend and I tonight, we got right in at the only unreserved table. Sideline, used to work around the old Slanted Door when it opened on Valencia, picked up Banh Mi once in a while, then one day they stopped selling sandwiches and the crowd was a bunch of tourists, then they were moving to the Ferry Building and you (apparently) need reservations weeks in advance. Kinda the same culture shock here. \n\nAnyway, prices definitely a little different from Thai Time. Had the $19 Pad Kee Mao and the vegetarian dish with \"running beans.\" My friend ordered some Thai ice tea. \n\nFirstly, the tea was terrible, watery, little flavor at all. Very surprised, think that alone was $4.\n\nBut next was the bean dish with some sticky rice, and oh my it was pretty awesome with a lot of flavors hitting all cylinders, an Issan dish. Crunchy beans with an amazing sauce that you roll up with the rice in some (too small) lettuce leafs. Definitely a winner. \n\nThen the $19 pork Pad Kee Mao came. You and I both think, \"who spends $20 bucks on some noodles?\" But damn if they didn't serve some of the best PKM I've ever tasted! It was well spiced, ample ground pork integrated into perfectly cooked noodles with a great subtle smoky flavor. These two dishes were extremely filling, got out of there just over $60 with tip, and it was a special occasion so that was okay. \n\nServer was attentive, friendly, handled my friend's idle rambling like a saint as she was tending to many other tables. And the other support staff was definitely on the ball too. \n\nThe noise level with tables of chatty yuppies became ridiculously loud, would be great if they can tame that a bit. And the Thai ice tea needs a LOT of help. But those two dishes we had were definitely repeaters, service was superb, and price was not cheap but very fair for the overall experience.

This was the best dish we got by far. We then ordered the tamarind wings. I love tamarind but when I tried the wing I got a disgusting taste that was nowhere close to the taste of tamarind.

He said it was good but salty.\n-Mussels green curry: mine. Again, good but salty. Could have used more heat. \n-Brown rice: you get a huge tub for $4. It's the red-brown rice too, which I love.\n\nAll of this came to $96 before tip and we didn't even order drinks!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-01", "description": "Although I really like Kin Khao and have dined here several times, I can't seem to love it. And the main reason is: it's too heavy for my taste. After eating my face off in Thailand, I can't say Kin Khao has the same light, fresh taste; however, it certainly is unique. And again I think this is a matter of personal preference, but I find everything is a little too salty. The clams were drenched in a thick sauce that I had to diffuse with rice. The pad kee mao had a slight burnt taste to it and the minced pork in it was extremely salty. I was so thirsty during and after the meal. If there is one thing you must get, it's the mushroom terrine. Quite unique flavors that really go well with perfect crispy rice crackers. \n\nI'm not going to give up though, I will be back to try more dishes because they all sound so interesting. I  just hope not all the dishes are as salty as the ones I've ordered so far!", "author": "Yue X."}

Ate here for dinner on Friday night without a wait since we walked in and the sweet hostess gave us the option for bar seating. \n\nAs with most bar spots, let me tell you some good news...there are PURSE HOOKS! Score! We google map'd Kin Khao after we got off the bus, and tried to find the place but kept on walking around the same corner hotel. We asked the kind gentlemen outside and he said it's upstairs! WELL DUH. We found Kin Khao and was surprised that it was a restaurant in the hotel...that kind of swayed my opinion on it to begin with, but at the end of my meal I could care less where it was located. Kin Khao in all its glory is a winner in my book.\n\nStarted with their beer cocktail (have never been interested in beer shake-ups, but I trusted our friendly mixologist) Pak Pow since he described it as being refreshing with hints of spice! I loved it and would recommend it for people who don't want something sweet and like hints of spice and definite citrus notes (ginger, lemon). We decided on the Plah pla muek (inky tender big squid) which was a little on the sour and fish sauce side with TONS of delicious cilantro peanutty notes. SO SO SO freaking good. We also had the Mussels & nectarine curry. HOLY smokes, refreshingly sweet with tons of delicious flavoring going on. Texture-wise, it was very liquidy and more runny/thin than most Thai curries I've had. I wish we could have taken the rest of our curry home, but our plans wouldn't make that convenient.\n\nI cannot wait to come back to try their catfish and other delicious curries. I also love that there are so many vegetarian options and their spicy levels are just mild in my opinion. Their coconut rice was also very sticky and feather-light for sweetness...one suggestion: just don't put the sticky rice on a wax paper sheet. I couldn't eat all of the sticky rice because it got stuck on the paper. The metal bowl container is fine, most of us want to eat all of the sticky rice without losing a battle to the adhesion with wax paper. In all, vibes are great for date night or a relaxed dining experience with close friends. It's not recommended to bring huge groups since you'll have to wait longer and the space itself isn't fit for banquet style groups. But that's what so great about Kin Khao--personalized, flavor bursts of Thai crafted yums.", "author": "Jodi H."}

The restaurant is inside Parc 55 hotel and its pretty tiny. This is what I ordered:\n\n- Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine (4/5): Texture is similar to liver pate. Taste of mushroom was just perfect, not too overwhelming nor tasteless. The rice cracker that came with it was really crispy and had a pretty decent flavor on it own. A perfect combo to pair it with the Mushroom pate. \n- Pretty Hot Wings (3/5): Really spicy. To me it was a tad too spicy. Wasn't a big hit for me. Felt like it was just deep fried wings topped with hot sauce. Nothing special\n- Caramelized Pork Belly (4/5): Literally melts in your mouth. It's served on a claypot so when it comes to your table its still boiling hot. Careful not to burn your tongue here. Its on the sweeter side rather than salty but its the perfect amount of sweetness to go with your rice.\n- Kua Kling Ribs (3/5): This is really spicy too. Tasted like indonesian Rendang tbh. It was good i thought but a little too salty. Had to eat it with rice to balance that saltiness.\n- Black Rice Pudding (4/5): Presentation was nice. Basically just your regular sticky rice with a bunch of different toppings (nuts, rice crispies, coconut milk) \n\nI can see how this place has one michellin star. I think it's quite a deal for how much you're paying.", "author": "Valerie H."}

And come with a group that likes sharing and trying new foods. \n\nUnfortunately, I came at lunch and with co-workers who wanted to order individually. There was no wait around 12:15pm. Good amount of customers but still tables available. \n\nThis is definitely a higher end Thai place. Dish prices are around $18. \n\nThey don't have certain dishes during lunch- charred eggplant or octopus salad. Boo, I was looking forward to trying that. \n\nWe shared the pretty hot wings & blistered Chinese green beans. I liked the green beans- they came in tasty XO sauce = dried scallops + dried shrimp + dried ham + ginger + garlic. YUM! The hot wings were wet and saucy. Okay.\n\nThe waiter said popular dishes are the pad kee mao (drunken noodles) and pork bowl. \n\nBecause I wanted to sample different things, I got the Pinto Market Lunch (panang curry with rabbit meatballs, pork riblets in sweet+spicy garlic chili sauce, seasonal salad, pickles, a cup of chicken broth and jasmine rice). \n\nThe rabbit meatballs were 3 tiny pieces, son. Boo. The curry sauce was good though. I liked the salad and pickled veggies, and the chicken broth was soothing. I wouldn't order this dish again, but I'm glad I got to sample different things. \n\nThis is a Michelin star Thai restaurant located on the side of a hotel.

All I have to show for this adventure was several meaningless Uber fares for our party of 8, a hour of wasted time, and having to scramble to go to another restaurant down the block. Great.\n\nDon't take reservations if your staff can't honor them or be troubled to enter it in the computer. Unbelievable. If I could give negative stars I would give -5.\n\nEDIT: Other people have thrown me messages asking me if my experience was \"that bad\". Yes, it absolutely was. I have no problem waiting a hour for a hot restaurant spontaneous. I have a problem when a restaurant that takes reservations on a non-busy Monday and then completely forgets to input it into the computer.\n\nEDIT 2: Instead of owning up to a honest mistake, I get an excuse. I asked this Sam to confirm a table for 8 for 8 people. Had he asked for a credit card number (as wholley unnecessary as it is), I would have gladly provided.\n\nNo, I did not \"hang up\" on your host. I asked him very explicitly, are we confirmed for 8:00pm?\n\nOf course this guy is going to protect his own rear-end in light of such a public and honest review.

This restaurant had been highly recommended by a friend, and I saw a Michelin star on their wall when I walked in. I was expecting good, if not great, food.\n\nWe made a reservation and arrived a bit early, and were told that we couldn't sit down until our reservation time. No big deal. The restaurant is somewhat small and they were busy. We walked around the block and came back later.\n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered a variety of dishes to share between two of us. We ordered: pork belly, pork cracklings, rabbit green curry, and phad kee mao.\n\nThe pork belly was the standout dish of the night. It was perfectly cooked with a nice sear, and melt-in-your-mouth tender. That pork belly had been treated with a lot of TLC. Good stuff.\n\nThe pork cracklings were average. Nothing to make it stand out from any other pork cracklings that I've had in my life, good or bad.\n\nThe rabbit green curry had a good flavor, but the meatballs were SO salty. It was a salt bomb, and salt was all I could taste. I could have kept eating the green curry, but I only ate one meatball.\n\nThe phad kee mao was the most disappointing dish of the night. I only ate a tiny scoop that my boyfriend had put on my plate and didn't bother going back for more. It was so overloaded with soy sauce and incredibly salty.\n\nI don't know if they were having an off night, but whoever the chef was that night needs to lay off the salt!

Their dishes are on the modern side and I can definitely say that they know how to cook. Now for the most important part in my eyes - how is their duck noodle soup? The duck, which is the hardest part to perfect in the soup given its fattiness is cooked with perfection. The chef has completely removed all the fat from the duck so it doesn't leave your soup too oily. The broth itself however isn't as tasty as some of the restaurants in town.

Plus the 1 Michelin star it has made me set a pretty high standard for the food. Let me start by saying this isn't your typical Thai food joint with the variety of noodle dishes, curries, and soups. It's very unique Thai food with authentic flavors and made-from-scratch ingredients. \n\nMy friend and I came here for dinner Sunday night and were luckily seated in 15 minutes at the communal table. I recommend getting a reservation because it gets super busy especially on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nWe ordered two starters/appetizers, one entree to share, and one dessert.\n\nThe two starters we got were the charred eggplant salad and the khao kan jin. The charred eggplant salad was not what I was expecting, it was a little artificial tasting to me; it was almost like they used liquid smoke instead of it being charred? I did enjoyed it more when we mixed it all up in the shallots, mint, shiso, and soy & citrus dressing.\n\nThe khao kan jin was my favorite dish. It is banana-wrapped steamed pork, rice, blood sausage with garlic chips, fried shallots, raw shallots, cilantro, and lime. I was really thrown off when I read \"blood sausage\" (pork is usually not my choice of protein), but I actually enjoyed this dish a lot. You unwrap the rice and mix it in with all the vegetables and squeeze lime juice on top. The lime really brought all the flavors together. \n\nThe entree we got was the mussels & nectarine gaeng kua curry. This is probably the best red curry I've ever had. It is very fragrant with a good spice kick - probably because they make their curry pastes in house daily! The nectarines in the curry sauce was very unique - I've never had that before, and I enjoyed it a lot. The tartness of the fruit went well with the spice - again, this place does flavors well! The mussels were fine, I will say that they weren't super memorable. Just the amazing curry sauce alone with rice was perfect for me.\n\nThe dessert we got was the black rice pudding. It's enough to share among two people - it's a pretty decent-sized dessert portion. It is served with three tiny bowls of burnt coconut caramel, salty coconut cream, and peanut & puffed rice & sesame praline. Our server described it as a sundae-type situation where you put the three \"garnishes\" on top of the pudding. We thought the pudding was a little watered down - it wasn't as viscous as a typical pudding. It tasted good, especially when you mix all the sauces and praline in, but I did expect/want a more \"pudding\" consistency. The burnt coconut caramel sauce was so good. I just ended up eating spoons of that alone...\n\nOverall: great restaurant with amazing flavor incorporation. I've never had a more unique Thai food experience. I subtracted one star because I did think the execution could have been a little better in regards to texture of food mostly. Like I said, this isn't a typical Thai restaurant experience because it is on the fancier side. I want to get the prix fix menu next time I come ($55/person) because you get a variety of dishes! You end up paying around that much per person even if you don't order prix fixe, so I think it's worth it since you get to try out a bunch of different foods.", "author": "Steph V."}

This was definitely one of the best Thai food experiences I've ever had. Each item that we ordered was unique and cooked to absolute perfection. \n\nWe dropped by for dinner on a Friday night at 9.30pm and were able to get a table for 4 almost immediately. Our server did a great job explaining the menu and giving us recommendations. The menu is broken up into three sections based on the price and quantity of each item. Most people order family style and I would definitely recommend it so you can get a taste of each dish blending the spicy and sweet. \n\nBetween 4 of us we ordered 1 appetizer, 3 small plates and 2 large dishes. It was the perfect amount. We got:\n\nApeetizer: \n- Mushroom Har Mok\n\nSmall Plate:\n- Khao Kan Jin\n- Nam Tok Beans (absolutely fabulous)\n- Caramleized Pork Belly\n\nLarge Dishes:\n- Rabbit Green Curry\n- Vegetable Panang\n\nWe got a round of cocktails too which were decent. The 'Pattaya Shake' though wasn't for us. Couldn't get through more than 2 sips. The entire meal was a little more expensive than I initially expected with it costing us $50 each. \n\nOverall the food was great, each item had a nice presentation, meat was cooked to perfection and the veggie dishes were amazing too.", "author": "Zoher Z."}

That pork belly...oh my goodness, yes. We were all over that. Needless to say, the pork belly is only memorable, standout dish from this dinner adventure. \n\nWe also ordered the chicken wings, massaman nuea, and sticky rice. The chicken wings were typical, crispy wings that were nothing too notable. It seemed just like fried wings with the traditional Mae Ploy brand sweet chili sauce all over. The massaman nuea was spicy, flavorful and had a layer of oil that kicked the spice up as well. \n\nService was good and attentive for a rainy, Sunday night when the place was decently full.

I made a reservation. As we entered the restaurant, I noticed on one side there 2 large parties with baby strollers. The hostess was going to seat us with the babies and I told her I didn't want to be near any children. Ok, the attitude that came from her along with the look was a enough for me to leave. Really I'm paying $29 a dish, I do not want to sit next to any screaming kids or babies. Anyway she sat us begrudgingly on the other side of the restaurant. From then on we were in a food meca. \n\nOur server, Heidi, was very good. We started off with drinks which were amazing: Kem Kon (Old Granddad 114 Whiskey, Vermouth L'Afrique, Tamarind, Lime, Cinnamon) and the Pak Pow (PA, Appleton Reserve Rum, Allspice Dram, lemon, Nutmeg). \n\nWe then ordered: Nam Tok Beans (Scarlet Runner beans tossed Isaan-style with lime, chili toasted rice powder, light soy, shallots, scallions, mint, cilantro),   Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy (With light soy, garlic), Massaman Nuea (Braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry paste, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes), Pad Kee Mao (Stir-fried drunken noodles with ground pork, rice noodles, garlic, Birds Eye chili, onions, bell peppers, holy basil) and a Sticky RIce. \n\nAll the dishes were excellent though we could of done with 1 less dish.

We had a group of 9 for a 6p dinner last Thursday night.\n\nDrinks:\n*Farang 75: encanto single vineyard pisco, velvet falernum, lemon, cava, ginger ($12)\n*Tom yum: tanqueray gin, imbue vermouth, lime, galangal, lemongrass, abbots bitters, kaffir leaf ($12)\n*Kem kon: old granddad 114 whiskey, vermouth, l'afrique, tamarind, lime, cinnamon ($12)\n*Suan som smash: dickle rye, winter citrus, angotora bitters ($12)\n*Old fashioned: four roses yellow ($11)\n*Hua hin beach: mount gay black barrel rum, coconut cream, lime, chocolate stout, salt, kaffir lime, umbrella ($12)\n*Kathoey Collins: akvinta vodka, chareau liqueur, lime, blue flowers ($12)\n*Pak pow: ipa, appleton reserve rum, allspice dram, lemon, nutmeg ($12)\n*Manhattan: four roses yellow ($11)\n\nThe drinks were good and actually fun. The kem kon was my cocktail. A little sweeter than I expected, but had a good balance of flavors. The kathoey collins was the star of the night. Fun and interactive. When the server mixes the drink together it changes color. Our table ordered three of these just to watch the pretty violet come to life. Out of everything, the four roses manhattan was my favorite. Just simple. I'm an alcohol purist after all.\n\nFriends and family menu ($50 each):\n*Mushroom hor mok terrine: curry mousse in-a-jar with connie green's mushrooms, crisp rice cakes\n*Pretty hot wings: nam pla fish sauce + garlic marinade, pretty spicy tamarind + sriracha glaze\n*Yum yai salad: a \"grand\" mix of raw, cooked & battered-fried seasonal vegetables, not-so-spicy chili jam dressing\n*Caramelized pork belly: sweet, savory, voluptuous pork belly cooked in a clay pot\n*Stir fried baby bok choy: baby bok choy, light soy, garlic\n*Massaman nuea: braised beef cheeks in massaman curry paste, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes\n*Gaeng som sour curry: seasonal vegetables in vegetarian chili + tamarind broth (no coconut milk), topped with a seasonal green omelette\n*Black rice pudding: served with burnt coconut sugar caramel, salty coconut cream, puffed rice + peanut + sesame praline all on the side\n\nSince we had a big party, we had to go with a prix fixe menu. It was a good sampling of their menu as a whole. I really enjoyed the mushroom curry mousse and the pork belly. My favorite dish was actually, the one we added, Khun yai's rabbit green curry: kiew wan curry paste, rabbit leg + saddle, rabbit meatballs, thai apple eggplants, thai basil ($27). I love green curry and this one one had great flavor.\n\nSo the math nerd in me can't help but notice the friends and family menu isn't really a good deal. As a group of 9, we got 3 of each dish. When I added up the regular cost of the dishes, the friends and family menu cost $116. Times that by three and the total is $348. But we paid $50 each, so $450 altogether. That's over $100 more than it should have been. From the looks of it, our dishes were the same size as the regular dishes, so it feels kind of like a rip off when going in a big group.\n\nI thought the food and drinks were pretty good, but having to pay an extra $100 for being in big group?

A couple of friends swore this is the best Thai food they've had but I walked away with mixed feelings.  There were definitely dishes I liked but others that underwhelmed or were too intense or salty.  Get some rice to offset this.\n\nLet's start with the cocktails which are awesome and influenced by Thai flavors.  The TOM YUM was recommended by my friend.  It's made with Tanqueray gin, Imbue vermouth, lime, galangal, lemongrass, Abbott bitters and kaffir leaf.  It did not disappoint.\n\nOur party of six split these dishes:\n\n* HOUSE PICKLES - Nice for a palate cleanser.\n\n* MUSHROOM HOR MOK TERRINE - This was my favorite item.  The curry mousse is served in a jar with mushrooms and there are crispy rice cakes on the side to spread the mousse on.\n\n* NAM TOK BEANS - A good vegetarian option.  The scarlet runner beans are tossed with lime, chili, toasted rice powder, light soy sauce, shallots, scallions, mint and cilantro.\n\n* PRETTY HOT WINGS - Yes these are pretty spicy.  Too spicy for me though.\n\n* PLAH PLA MUEK - I liked this charred squid a lot.\n\n* CARAMELIZED PORK BELLY - The pork belly is cooked in a clay pot.  It's good but if you're even remotely tired of all the pork belly then skip this.  I've had better.\n\n* KUA KLING RIBS - This was my least favorite.  The paste was overwhelming and it came out way too salty.\n\n* YUM YAI SALAD - A multi-textured salad with raw, cooked and batter-fried vegetables.\n\n* DUCK PANANG CURRY - By the time this one came out, I was pretty full.  But I had a bite and liked it.  The only downside is that the braised, bone-in duck leg and thigh are hard to share.\n\nThe dessert here is the BLACK RICE PUDDING.  It's a DIY production.  You get all the ingredients in separate bowls and put it together.  It looks better than it tasted for me.  I thought it was bland.

It was kind of interesting, because I got to watch the bartender make drinks, but at the same time, he was making a hot mess, so that irked my OCD. It wasn't like there was a mad rush, so I'm not sure why he was so all over the place and messy. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the pork bowl, the Bangkok posh salad, and the pinto market lunch.\n\nFirst off, the pork belly in the pork bowl dish was superb. It was perfect and melted in my mouth. Both of us commented on how lovely it was. The broth was very salty, but it was an overall favorite.\n\nThe salad was a major fail. What is this? We didn't finish it and forced ourselves to eat what we did.\n\nThe pinto market lunch was good, but not extraordinary.\n\nOne problem is that my mom is Thai. First off, she would never eat here, because she's a traditionalist and doesn't want to add in fancy ingredients like rabbit meatballs that aren't supposed to be in the dish. I don't mind this, and actually like new combinations of flavors, but the green curry itself isn't something I couldn't make at home in 20 minutes. I guess if you don't cook Thai food, you might be really crazy about it, but I can have that any time I want (minus the rabbit).\n\nThe other problem is that the food here is crazy expensive for what it is. My mom would never pay this much for Thai, and she would berate me if she knew I had. There are so many amazing places for less money. Yes, I appreciate the inventiveness of some menu items, but the flavors (to me) just aren't that different and deserving of the cost. \n\nExcept for the port belly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-28", "description": "How does a place with a supposed impressive credential make such horribly wrong Thai food? I wonder this for nights after deciding to give Kin Khao a try. I'm not against modernizing or reconceptualizing a cuisine if it is done right. Kin Khao gives the patrons, including me, the impression of a place that serves up a modernized Thai food while still preserving the traditional taste of whatever they're presenting. \n\nNope, everything was over salted and overly sweetened. I'm not saying that I'd expect the food at Kin Khao to match what the taste profile one may expect when they're in Thailand but several places around this area has achieved this without going off the deep end like this establishment (ahem Lers Ros, Sai Jai Thai, House of Thai??)\n\n\n1. Pad Thai Goong Sod: whoa, there's nothing about this noodle dish that's even close to what a Pad Thai is supposed to taste like. From the overuse of dark soy sauce and the muted, salty and sugary taste of bad cooking, the only thing that is \"right\" about this dish is texture of the noodle itself.  \n\n2. Laab Tod: I am not sure what to really expect from this dish but this is more like a lettuce wrap kind of deal. What kind of Laab that was \"Tod\"? No idea, it's just a basic overly salty meatball served up with some lettuce and sticky rice. The only flavor that I get out of this is saltiness, a little bit of this little ball goes a long way, meaning you will likely need a mouthful of sticky rice to make your bite more balanced. \n\n3. Gaeng Som Sour Curry: no, just say no to this \"seasonal leaf and root vegetables in Som sour curry broth, with tamarind, fresh red chili, and no coconut milk.\" The poor soul who made this probably never knew what the real deal is supposed to taste like. It's supposed to be more like a soup than curry, and this part, they've managed to get it right but there is nothing about it that tastes \"Som sour.\" The broth is so sweet and salty, we couldn't bare to finish it. This one really went off the deep end and most disappointing of all the dishes. \n\n4.Sai Ua+Namprik Noom: finally, someone got this one right, the taste is spot on for this northern style sausage. Sadly, I can't depend on consuming just this to sustain me through dinner. So I paid the $75+ bill and walk home to eat a second dinner elsewhere since out of the 4 things we've ordered, the only edible one is this one. \n\nI don't mean to burst anyone's bubble but if you really do enjoy paying top dollars for mediocre Thai food presented in a way that is more tame for your taste while fooling you into thinking that you're eating some awesome re-imagined Thai food then you should continue to patronize this place. I don't mind, it just means that there's less of a wait at some really great Thai places down the street for me. Thanks!", "author": "Taffany H."}

It's been a roundelay of Thai eateries for as long as I've walked by this weirdly hidden corner space of the Parc 55, which I'm convinced has the worst layout of any hotel lobby ever. And the design extends into this space which I think is also oddly configured with two severely divided spaces making up the dining area. I'm sure back in the seventies somebody thought this was so contemporary modern. But at least the food is much better thanks to owner Pim Techamuanvivit and chef Michael Gaines (who previously worked at the acclaimed Manresa in Los Gatos). They make dishes that put a stylish twist on traditional Thai fare.\n\nJamie W. and I decided to come here at the last minute on Christmas Eve when I was able to secure a 5:30 table. We were a bit squashed into the banquette seating next to a family of four with fidgety adolescents. Never a good sign, but they were thankfully better behaved than the mother who kept pushing her handbag and St. John knock-off overcoat into my space. The menu is robust yet tight in selection though all of it very tempting. We started with the $12 Yum Yai Salad which gets bonus points for the most unique application of tempura as it was applied on greens and asparagus tips. They then mixed in lettuce leaves, steamed kabocha squash and thinly sliced watermelon radish, all of it drizzled with a sweet chili jam (photo: http://bit.ly/1I5BDWC).\n\nIt was a refreshing mix of flavors but not even the liberal use of tempura on lettuce, no less, made the dish stand out.. We segued to the $16 Pork Bowl, which was a hearty pho-like creation with flat rice noodles swimming in a tasty pork broth festooned with crispy belly, braised shoulder, tofu (unnecessary), and a soft-boiled egg (photo: http://bit.ly/17scRDh). It was a nice substitute for the Caramelized Pork Belly, which is what I really wanted. But I couldn't justify it in my head when we were already ordering the $27 Massaman Nuea, one of the more luxuriant curries I've ever eaten enriched as it was by coconut milk and piled high with braised beef cheeks, burnt shallots (intentional) and potatoes (photo: http://bit.ly/1wF4wSf).\n\nWe needed a bowl of brown rice to sop up all its decadence (photo: http://bit.ly/1sga3Ci). As recompense, we ordered the $10 Wok-Charred Brussel Sprouts in XO Sauce. I was unaware what XO sauce was until I read on my iPhone that it's a spicy seafood sauce from Hong Kong. I liked the side dish a lot but probably because the sprouts were mixed with dried scallops, dried shrimp, dried ham, garlic and ginger (photo: http://bit.ly/1tSDmXc). What's not to like about that? Or anything we had for that matter since each dish appeared methodically created with an abundance of flavors that somehow melded together. There was hardly any need for the Sriraja Panic Chilli Sauce that was waiting to be shaken and poured (photo: http://bit.ly/14F2rik). The food is worth a return visit, the layout not so much.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...really complex Thai dishes that work for the most part\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...not a fan of this space\nSERVICE - 3 stars...a bit quiet, a \"speak when you're spoken to\" attitude\nTOTAL - 4 stars...go for the stylish take on Thai...you won't see these dishes across the street", "author": "Ed U."}

It was creamy, just a bit spicy and very, very delicious. \n\nThe Plah pla muek is squid mixed with a Tom yum like sauce and cilantro and was so juicy and grilled just right. Also an appetizer that I really enjoyed.\n\nThe yum yai salad was also a great surprise. The salad mixed tempura fried vegetables with raw vegetables in a tangy sauce. The mix of the textures was great and readily recommended if you want to order some veggies in the meal.\n\nThe laab tod is a pork meatball dish that goes wonderfully with the sticky rice that is included. It's soft, marinated well and a simple dish that is done wonderfully. \n\nThe sticky rice also goes wonderfully with the caramelized pork belly, which is absolutely melt-in-your-mouth and so soft. While this is one of their most popular dishes, I did find this dish more overpriced though give the portion size. There's only 4 pieces of pork belly, so that's $4.25 per piece of 2inx1inx1in pork. Delicious, but there's other items on the menu that offers better value given how much is overcharged for this dish.\n\nThe Kua Kling ribs is also excellent...if you can eat very spicy food. These ribs are one of the spiciest I've ever had and was really good but definitely not for the faint of heart. Very flavorful though though I lost my sense of taste after maybe 2 bites. \n\nThe Massaman Nuea is curry with braised beef cheeks and the beef is so tender and absolutely melts in your mouth. The sauce is also delicious and goes so well with rice. The black cod taypo curry is also excellent. The fish was tender, the curry was creamy and I loved it. This curry is a bit spicy though, so I would recommend getting the Massaman Nuea if you don't like spicy food. \n\nThe drinks here are also excellent. The Tom Yum is very popular but I also really enjoy the Farang 75 and the Pak Pow. The Ladyboy Collins is also quite good and very refreshing. \n\nDoes Kin Khao offer good value? Portion sizes would have to be a little bigger to justify the price tag. However, Kin Khao most recently became a Michelin one star restaurant in 2015 and while Michelin stars can be overrated at times, Kin Khao is definitely one of the most affordable Michelin restaurants in the Bay Area and one that offers great quality and amazing flavour.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

Then, if the Michelin inspection team adds it to their 2015 Bib Gourmand list you might sit up and take further notice.  That's some serious buzz swirling around Kin Khao and for good reason.  \n\nIt's not often that I encounter a restaurant preparing food that I've never before tasted the likes of.  Less often that I encounter food that I can't stop thinking about.  There always seems to be another new place to try but Kin Khao?  All I can think about is returning.  \n\nAs others mention, the inauspicious entrance is on the corner of Mason and Ellis.  Inside, you'll find restaurant decor that falls somewhere between unremarkable and completely under the radar.  It's by no means a dive but neither is it at all dressed up, as hotel restaurants often are.  If not for hearing about Kin Khao in advance (and having a reservation) I'd never have walked by and chosen it from amongst the many other options in the area.\n\nDinner was:\n\n*  Tom Yum \"Punch\" ($12), an alcohol laden cocktail which rivaled Slow Club's Malabar (one of my favorite cocktails ever) for excellence in drinkable Southeast Asian flavors.   \n\n*  Yum Yai Salad ($12) which, upon first look, was off-putting due to what I presumed were icy lettuce leaves.  Silly me.  Not here.  What I was seeing were lightly fried lettuce leaves and, when paired with chili-jam dressing and assorted other raw and cooked vegetables wow.  Or rather WOW.  A flavor sensation.    \n\n*  Nam Tok Beans ($11) - I asked our server's advice when having trouble deciding between two items and she correctly steered me here, to \"Rancho Gordo's Christmas Lima Beans tossed isaan-style with lime, chili toasted rice powder, light soy, shallots, scallions, mint, and cilantro\".  The things I did with that dish I did until there wasn't a speck left on the plate.  It's similar in style to Miang Kham in that you can wrap it's parts up in spinach but the similarity ends there.  The glorious tastes linger.  I long to eat this dish again.      \n\n*  Beef Cheeks ($27) - I'm uncertain what giant animal had such immense cheeks but they weren't for nothing.  The serving size of this dish was more than ample for two.  The tastes?  Exquisite.  \n\nI've always enjoyed the generally accepted version of Thai food served in most American restaurants but this here food takes off to places that those menus don't even begin to suggest.  Kin Khao is a place I wish to return to several times over, in 2015, to make my way through the entirety of their menu.

They won't seat you until your whole party is there even if you have a reservation. They don't have their own bathroom in their area, so you have to get a key and walk around the building a bit to get to a restroom. \n\nService: Slow but kind.

To be honest I'm now wondering if I just don't know what real Thai food is supposed to taste like.. because for such a famous and well liked place, I disliked a lot of the dishes. But I have been to some other great and legit seeming thai places... so... \nWe ordered Nam Tok beans. It came with lettuce.. and was extremely salty. Like, put two beans on a leaf of lettuce if you want it to be okay. Yum kai dao - a small dish that is mainly a duck egg with onions, peanuts, and a bunch of sweet and sour tasting sauce. The egg was fine, but the sauce was overwhelming and also salty. TOO salty. And the peanuts, which I presume are supposed to add a crunchy texture, were stale and almost soggy. We got the massaman. This was a regular sized bowl of curry with very soft pork.. but this, too, was very very salty. I would have needed about 4x the amount of rice that they had given us to make it okay. It was very flavorful though - so coconuty that it was almost floral. We also got the hot wings which were decent (though the sour flavor was too strong). \nThe caramelized pork however, was absolutely amazing. This pork belly was so soft and tender that i could cut it up with my chopsticks.

The thing that made this place for me was the pork belly - this is the best love-handle and 'betes-inducing pieces of jiggly porky goodness  in SF. \n\n1 Michelins are usually a bit overrated and I think this one about fits that stereotype, but its worth the visit for the pork belly. Service and venue were both decent, but LOUD. Bring earplugs and ask for 3 glasses of water.", "author": "Snuffles B."}

Bay Area and had bookmarked it. It's a Thai fusion place.\n\nFirst off, it's located inside a hotel and shares a bathroom with the hotel. The bathroom requires a key card to get in and it's kept pretty clean.\n\nMy friend and I didn't have to wait to be seated because we came maybe half an hour after it opened for dinner. It got packed pretty quickly though. \n\nCustomer service: Decent, didn't have to wait long for our server to come back\nAtmosphere: Very nice, relaxed, easy to hear my friend\n\nFOOD:\n-Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine: Got this as an appetizer - crispy rice cakes with a creamy mushroom curry that definitely has a kick to it. It was delicious. \n-Caramelized Pork Belly: This was definitely the star of the meal. It was delicious, sweet, fatty, melt-in-your-mouth goooood. It's similar to the caramelized pork belly in shanghainese cuisine, except maybe a bit firmer but still really goooood. We ordered the sticky white rice to eat with this and it was definitely the right choice. \n-Chicken Wings: These were alright, I think we got 3-4 chicken wings? They were sweet and spicy. \n\nOf note, the menu changes occasionally so don't be surprised if you see something on yelp that is no longer on the menu. For the price and Michelin star reputation, I definitely think it's a great value.", "author": "K W."}

Last week we discussed where to go.  Alan did some research on restaurants close to their hotel, the Parc 55, I sent Cathy the links to three of them and she chose Kin Khao, which she had had bookmarked.  Conveniently, it's in the hotel.  Alan and I took BART over and the walk from the Powell Street Station was relatively short and easy.  They were sitting in the lobby area when we arrived a little before our 6:00 dinner reservation and we walked over to the restaurant.  There was a short line in front of us but it moved quickly and we were seated at a 4 top and given menus.\n\nThe restaurant was a little dark for reading menus, as they tend to be these days, but iPhone flashlights solved that.  They had an intriguing cocktail menu and the food menu was tiered, w/ starters, more medium sized plates and then larger one.  All food is served family style.  Our server came over and was marvelously knowledgeable about the menu.  He not only oriented us to the hierarchy of dishes and gave us suggestions on how to organize our ordering, but he was helpful in explaining the nuances of the cocktails, which helped Cathy and me choose which ones to order.  I can't remember their names now, but I loved mine, which was herbaceous and not too sweet and the taste I had of Cathy's was delicious too.  Hers was like an Old Fashioned if I remember correctly.  Alan and Dennis both ordered Mai Tais and Alan reported his was good.  The four of us looked over the menu and agreed to order two salads, one a shredded green papaya and the other, Yum Yai, a mixture of raw, cooked and fried vegetables, a charred Monterey squid dish, a noodle dish that was like pad see ew and a dish of ling cod dumplings w/ lotus root from the larger dish part of the menu.  We ordered brown rice and then ordered a second one.  All the dishes were elegant and refined.  Some had a bit of heat but I didn't find any of them overwhelmingly hot, just very flavorful.  Each one brought a unique flavor profile and I would find it hard to choose a favorite.  We must have chosen well.  It was a lovely dinner in excellent company.", "author": "Toni M."}

The name of the place literally translate to 'eat rice/food' so I was expecting an 'urban' aesthetic, but when we showed up I was very impressed.  The place tucked away inside the Parc55 hotel and might be a tad difficult to find if its your first time.\n\nThe place was super clean and busy.  When the hostess asked if we had a reservation I was expecting a wait but we were seated immediately.  My friend was running a few minutes late and we were told we couldn't put in orders until everyone was here.  No worries thought, just gave us extra time to browse the menu.\n\nWe started with some beers and the cucumber som tom.  I has never had a Thai cucumber salad where the cucumber was still in its main form.  Typically it's sliced up into little bits but regardless of the appearance the sauce that it was soaking in was very good.  Not too spicy and with enough kick.\n\nWe opted for the caramelized pork belly, laab kua, and khao kan jin.  They all arrived and with the exception of the laab we were all thinking wow these portions are super small!  The pork belly was served in a hot pot and looked amazing.  Very happy it tasted just as good as it looked.  Very tender and such amazing flavors.  I asked for a side of rice to go along with it.  The laab kua portion was huge and didn't look like any other laab I've had before.  Looked way more cooked, I guess than I'm used to.  Again no worries cause it was also very good.  Maybe a tad bit spicier than I like but you can offset that with some rice.  It's served with lettuce to make wraps.  The last was the khao kan Jin which I've never had before.  It came in a banana leaf and the waitress told us to unwrap and mix it all together with the other ingredients in the bowl.  And again we were pleasantly surprised at how good it all tasted.  And even though the portions looked tiny, it was quite filling.  I ended up taking some of it home.  \n\nEverything we ordered was well above and beyond expectations.  I will definitely come back.  The reason why it wasn't 5 stars is because the price was a bit steep for the portions received, but I don't mind paying that if the food is good.  And it was!", "author": "Nyla K."}

I knew I would like Kin Khao right away - you can smell the yumminess as you walk up to the door, you're greeted by kitschy chalkboard style signage and menus, and the host staff were very welcoming and friendly. It's a small space but well-decorated and buzzing with energy. The bartenders and servers wear my favorite type of apron (yes, I have one). Does it make a difference? The aprons haven't steered me wrong, yet! (Marlowe uses them, too.)\n\nThe plates are meant to be shared - which the menu and the servers will tell you - and this is fantastic news, because you'll want to try everything that hits the table. Out of all the things we  tried (and there were many), the crispy eggplant salad was my least favorite... still good, but not as awesome as all the other stuff. I really enjoyed the octopus, the wings, and especially the drunken noodles. The curry was tasty as well. There were definitely NO misses, and the coursing was spot-on.\n\nI would recommend getting at least one order of rice (it'll serve 2-3 people easily), and you can choose from sticky, white or brown. Not only is it perfectly cooked, it's also just the vehicle you need for scooping up all the left-behind bits of savory sauce.\n\nKin Khao's cocktail game is also on-point, with spunky variations on classics plus some creations of their own. You can order an array of beer as well (I had the grapefruit radler) - and if you're not feeling the booze, the Thai iced coffee is pretty incredible and there are a few soft drink options that are way more interesting than soda.  \n\nMinus one star because it's in a hotel and you still get that weird hotel vibe coming in/going out (you know, watching weary travelers straggle in and people in pajamas board the elevators). You also have to use the hotel's hallway bathroom, which is nice enough - but closes down before the restaurant does.", "author": "Catie F."}

You're going to be dropping some coin, but well worth it if you're into food and into Thai food at that.\n\n- That curry mushroom terrine. Holy crap, get this. A decadent rich umami spread on rice cakes. A hint of spice, but really it's those decadent mushrooms that really make this a win. A great app to share.\n- The fish curry. A whole filet of black cod poached in a deliciously creamy curry. Wow. Imagine that buttery cod mixed with creamy coconut curry and you can imagine the sensory overload. A few items that would have made me feel better about this dish - more vegetables in the curry. This was really just some delicious fish in the broth and I think a few more additions to the mix would have made this dish stand out even more. And, with so much broth left over, I felt almost a little wasteful. \n- The pork belly. I'm not the biggest fan of pork belly, but this is another story. Cubed rich pork belly sizzling in a pan will get me every time. A great order and easy to share.\n- The fruit salad with spice and coconut was a let down. Not worth the money and my least favorite part of the meal.\n\nService was solid, drinks are at about $12 a pop and they pack a punch.\n\nA definite must eat while in SF if you get funky with food and don't mind paying higher prices.

A 2-star Michelin chef goes to Thailand to prove there's more to Thai food than chicken satay and peanut sauce. I think he accomplishes that with these bold purely authentic Thai tasting masterpieces.  \n\nThe food is addictive. Everything outside of fish sauce and sriracha is made in house. Came with a group of 4 to eff shit up family style. Best Thai food in SF!\n\nHere's what we ordered. Ranked in preference.\n\n\nKUA KLING RIBS $10 - Spicy dry fried ribs in this tumeric curry paste.

Classic Thai with the sweet, salty, spicy tongue twister. 4/5 \n\nGREEN RABBIT CURRY $22 - Fantastic depth of flavor from the curry, the bunny (named him Bugs) loin and saddle was super tender.  The rabbit meatballs reminded me of the ones from Italian wedding soup. \n\nCARMALIZED PORK BELLY - $13 - Melt in your mouth voluptous pork belly. Similar to Japanese Buta no Kakuni. \n\nKHAI SOI GOI - $15 - Northern style chicken curry broth where you add pickled veggies and spicy chili oil as you go. What I liked best about the dish was the combination of fresh and fried egg noodles to give contrasting textures.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2#U5dDY2rKk_e8FS6dAC0Z5g)\n\nCHILI JAM CLAMS - $18 - Littlenecks swimming in this umami flavor pool of chili jam and thai basil sauce. Little plump nuggets of flavor. 3.5/5\n\nCRAB MEAT AND BETEL LEAF CURRY - $34 - Good flavor from the tangy curry. WIsh there was a little more dungeness crab or other seafood thrown in. It did come with rice noodles.\n\n\nIt's inside the Parc hotel, little trendy but not as trendy as say Lers Ros - Hayes Valley. Some     There's a bar to have drinks before your.

We are talking 30$+ for some items, not justified IMO for the setup and atrocious wait to get seating. But I digress they were booked solid and even with a reservation we had to wait to get our table. \nThis visit the tasting menu caught our attention and I would say its decent way to experience a lot of their items in one sitting. I asked for a substitute course as don't eat pork and was obliged. \nFirst off they need to get the pacing right on the tasting menu as one gets slammed with dishes at once and then have to wait for bit for others to arrive. \nMushroom terrine: a variation using modern techniques. While somehow the terrine represented the curry flavors well mushroom felt like out of the can type.\ncucumber som tum: popular items if you have visited bars in Thailand. Very similar to the original\nnam tok beans: I was thinking this would pack a wallop of spice but surprisingly mundane take. Reminded me a lot of the second course of Peking duck sans the crunch on the lettuce as the lettuce was probably not iced in cold water I think. \nPork Belly: I didn't try this my friend enjoyed this offering.\nnoodles with chicken: Sub course for moi a good take on a classic could have used more heat.\nchilli jam clams: Very mild IMO and didn't just do it for me. If you have had Singapore style chilli crabs (much superior) the sauce was similar i.e. sweet with a hint of heat.\nwok charred asparagus: OK I guess nothing you wouldn't find at any place that does stir fry.\nmassaman beef: The highlight again IMO. cooked just right though not one would expect if you are thinking the traditional flavors. More like beef rendang IMO.\nBlack rice pudding: Forgetful.\nWe also got a serving of sticky rice with first course and jasmine rice in the middle. \nNow the prices have gone up so have expectations for moi.

After reading said review, one of my relatives that I had dined with mentioned how he didn't think the food was THAT bad.  Perhaps, but it certainly wasn't good.  Plus, he probably hasn't dined at the likes of places like Kin Khao or Lers Ros either!\n\nLocated within the Parc 55 Wyndham, Kin Khao is becoming quite the spot.  In fact, it's fortunate we had a reservation because even for dinner on a random weeknight, there was a moderately sized crowd waiting for table.  I can only imagine what it's like on weekends, but you know what?  It still just might be worth the wait!\n\n-- PRETTY HOT WINGS - Nam Pla Fish Sauce+garlic marinade, pretty spicy tamarind+Sriracha glaze...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2#s5yhr-n-S0PYYrJnTYlFXA)\nThese Pretty Hot Wings were, well...pretty hot.  And pretty large (wing, drum, and tip!).  The chicken itself was piping hot and the marinade/glaze had just the right kick.  As much as i liked it though, I'd be curious to try other starters before getting this again.\n\n-- BLISTERED GREEN BEANS in XO Sauce...$10\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2#WC_jPscHd24s8wheoDlQxA)\nThere wasn't a lot to the dish, but it was terrific.

Lots of flavor without a lot of fat/greasiness.  What's more, the chicharrones added a nice crunch/texture to the sticky rice and sausage.\n\n-- PAD KEE MAO - spicy stir-fried \"drunken noodles\" with ground pork, rice noodles, garlic, bird's eye chili, onions,  bell peppers, and Holy basil...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2#hYwAovsZIyS0sAL7L4uDCQ)\nWhile not as impressive as our other dishes, this was still pretty solid.  The noodles weren't heavily sauced, there was a good mix of seasoning/spices, and it wasn't too spicy.  It's not a must get (esp given the price), but you can't go wrong with it.\n\n-- MASSAMAN NUEA - Braised Beef Cheeks in Massaman Curry Paste, Coconut Milk, Burnt Shallots, and Potatoes...$27\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2#TdEIwzCBhuEKyTy96cfulw)\nHands down, the highlight of the meal.  The beef was ridiculously tender and the burnt shallots added a really nice earthiness to the dish.  However, the curry was what amazed me most - a deliciously creamy mix of spices that packed a mouthful of flavor.  It's not a cheap dish, but I'd highly recommend it\n\nOne thing to note is that Kin Khao's menu can fluctuate, reflecting whatever is fresh and/or in season, but there are some staples that seem to show up more consistently than others.  However, regardless of what shows up if/when you go, don't be scared to get the more \"adventurous\" dishes, as those seem to be the ones that stand out the most.\n\nAs much as I love the food though, I will say service wasn't perfect.  While the kitchen put out our dishes quickly, our waiter was hardly friendly (though he was like that with others as well).

It's authentic yet refreshing with the additional use of local Californian ingredients. why ONLY THREE STARS?\n\nThe fried chicken is some or the best I've tried - anywhere (including Thailand). The pork belly is my husband's absolute favorite. I have lived in Thailand. \nThe portion sizes for the starters are WAY TOO SMALL for the price, specially since the ingredients are not even organic. You only get 4 fried chicken wings which are just plain regular chicken (nothing uniquely sourced) where ordinarily you should get 8 to 10 pieces.\n\nAnother fav is the salad which they do with seasonal ingredients - really love the dressing and the soft and crunchy textures. \n\nThe main courses are excellent, but incredibly over priced. $35 for a single person's vegetarian main course or $50 for non vegetarian is completely unjustified given the small portion, ambience and service. \n\nOutstanding cocktails if a tad too sweet. \n\n The only disappointing thing of our meal was the service from our server Allan which really brought down their reputation of this establishment as worthy of a Michelin star in our eyes. \n\nFood was brought out in a rushed manner, nearly all at the same time with barely enough time to finish a course. That led to the pork belly getting cold. Our server never even checked on the meal until we requested something.\nDespite the fact that between the two of us we ordered enough for 6 people, and much more than other tables around us, the level of attention and lack of willingness to serve was really disappointing. Allan kept attending to the group on the table beside us (looked like he knew them) and completely ignored us. Our questions regarding allergies and requests for minor adjustments were met with disdain and at one point he just says \"NO\" and walks off without any explanation. \n\nAt one point we received an appetizer we hadn't ordered and it was on our table for 5 mins. We thought it was complimentary to make up for the shoddy service (as it came from a different server who says \"here we have a little tomatoe salad for you\"). Just as my fork touched the food he hurriedly comes and removes it, apologizing saying it's not for us. THIS IS SUCH A FAUX PAS! if a table of 2 people is giving you hundreds of dollars of business and you (mistakenly even) put a small appetizer on it, PLEASE DONOT REMOVE IT, it just makes you look bad, definitely NOT worthy of a Michelin star.\n\nThe rest of the servers were very nice though. I wish we had better things to say about our server because that would have made it another unforgettable meal at our favorite Thai place but I guess it as not to be.\n\nAnother note on the front desk - the policy about not seating guests until everyone arrives makes sense - for larger parties only. It's ridiculous to expect that in a group of 2 people if 1 has arrived, or if in a group of 3 if 2 have arrived, they should wait outside for the one person to show up until they're seated. \nI was made to wait alone outside until my partner arrived with a curt response from the Thai lady at the front. It creates such a bad impression at the get-go. Not a welcoming start to the meal, as many other patrons have pointed out. The restaurant should really address this.\n\nSorry, but when I'm spending $100++ per person, I expect warm welcoming and accommodating service willing to go the extra mile , with outstanding food. Kin Khao really needs to up its game on the former to match the high quality of the latter.", "author": "Yelper 2."}

While it wasn't groundbreaking by any means, the straightforward preparation was executed to perfection.  Next, the Yaowaraj Noodle turned out to be exceptional in its slight chew, fresh veggies and robust yet balanced flavors from the XO sauce.  And finally, Khun Yai's Rabbit Green Curry redefined curries for me in its immensely rich spices that never overpowered and enough weight to be hearty yet not overly heavy.\n\nCocktails were great and overall on the lighter side to allow the food pairings to remain center stage.

You won't find Pad Thai on this menu anywhere!\nVegetarian options are limited and Vegan options are just enough to make 1 complete meal with.\n\nToday I had:\n\nYum Palamai-A fresh and unique take on a salad. Mostly made up of fruits including Persimmons, apples, pomegranate. It is sauce heavy, made of soy and lime vinaigrette, fried shallots, mint, cilantro, and other herbs. The flavor was very new and pretty hard to describe. It is tart and sweet, but the vinaigrette and fried shallots gave it a more salty and warm taste, reminding me of flavors you'd find eating in a Vietnamese Spring Roll.\n\nFor our main entree we had the Stir Fried Baby Bok Choy and the Gaeng Som Curry.\n\nThe Bok Choy was nothing special. It literally was just stir fried with garlic. \nHowever, the curry was pretty delicious. We had it cooked with omelet on the side to make it vegan friendly. It is very spicy and had a strong sweet & sour taste. It went perfectly with the fluffy brown rice that is served with it.\n\nWe also opted for a round of drinks. My cocktail was pretty good, but I don't remember what it was. It was pretty pricey at $12 each. My bf had the chocolate stout and he said that was a delicious choice and unique for a Thai Restaurant to have on choice.\n\nThe dessert was the winner tonight! Only 1 choice and it is vegan! The Black Rice Pudding remind me of Vietnamese Che. It is coconut milk and black rice pudding served with burnt caramel and puffed rice. Soo warm, and sweet. It hit all the right spots after a spicy meal.\n\nService was friendly, and the timing of the meal was done perfectly. I recommend reservations, as we got lucky and snagged the last table-but they warned us we needed to be out before a certain time before the next reservation came in.\n\nWould I come back? Probably not. Even though I had a good experience, their lack of vegan options makes it hard to choose to come back. It was a great way to open my eyes up to new ways to enjoy Thai food.

The Pad Kee Mao was good, but nothing super out of the ordinary.  The beans were also good, and a nice addition to dinner since everything else was fairly heavy.  The curry was something I had a hard time enjoying since it was REALLY spicy.  I don't have a high spice threshold, so I'm sure it's enjoyable for those who enjoy really spicy food, but it was a little too much for me.  Our server warned us that it was spicy, and he was definitely right.  In any case, my friends and I were underwhelmed with the rest of the dishes, and service-wise, it felt like we were being ignored for majority of dinner.  Our server stopped in to check in on us once after our food arrived, but was only too quick to give us the check mid-way through dessert.

I had heard of Kin Khao for a while, but I stubbornly resisted going due to the fact that I lived in Thailand for year and couldn't fathom it being 'fancy' or a michelin star. Boy, was I wrong lol.\n\nThe mushroom terrine was simply amazing. It has the texture of the steamed egg dish that exists in my asian cuisines - but she managed to get a nice spicy curry kick into it along with hiding little pieces of mushrooms in it. Spread on top of a crispy rice cake and you have a little bite of magic. \n\nCaramelized Pork Belly in claypot - Wow. This is comfort food at its finest. Melt in your mouth pork belly that is sitting in a caramelized sweet sauce and pork fat - glop it on top of some rice and wow. \n\nNam Prik Long Rua - they warn you ahead of time that this is an umami bomb along with other things. Nothing could have really prepared me for the complex flavor of this. It's like getting taken for a ride through all your taste buds. Fishy, sour, sweet, salty, and spicy.. and a strong umami presence through it all. They don't give you quite enough vegetable/fruit sides to eat this with - you just barely need a little bit to get that umami bomb erupting in your mouth.  One of the most interesting things I've eaten in awhile. \n\nSweet Black Rice Pudding - I love this dessert that's originally from Malaysia/Singapore.

It was decent, but the portion was smaller than I expected.  Also had the Yaowaraj noodle dish, which was similar to Phad See Ew, but not totally..the chicken was a little charred for my taste, and my daughter's as well, and the salad that we had, the Yum Yai salad...well that was probably my favorite of the three.

Secrets, secrets!\n\nAfter studying the website, I was surprised at what the interior of the restaurant looked like because I expected it to be a small mom and pop with more than an hour wait. Instead, the interior is sleek and modern suitable for dressing down or up depending on your shindig and seats more than 10 people. \n\nAnyways, was finally able to cross this off my bucket list. I want to cross it off 100 times more! Kin Khao is freaking delicious. Their dishes boast complex flavors that will:\n\n1. Keep you eating way after you've unbuttoned the top button of your pants (saw this happen, just sayin') \n2. Make you order more food just to take it to go (who doesn't love a second dinner?)\n3. Make you want to lick the bowl/plate/whatever you're eating from (thought about it)\n4. Trap you in a food coma (been there done that)\n5. And give you many reasons to come back and try other menu items you haven't yet\n\nVegetables for all. There's quite a few plentiful vegetarian options that won't leave you hungry or feeling jipped. We ordered the green beans to start (vegetarian since the xo sauce clearly isn't). Honestly, they were pretty...boring; bland, unseasoned, and lacked a saucy component. They were crisped well, though. Slightly disappointed.\n\nI got over it and was pleasantly surprised with the presentation and taste of my Khao Mun Gai! Such a beautifully and cleanly presented dish with chicken fat rice (omg yum), ginger-poached chicken that was super moist, a line of sliced cucumbers, intense chicken consomm\u00e9 (similar to chicken noodle soup broth, a great palate cleanser), and Pim's secret sauce. Pim's sauce was my favorite, so gingery, spicy, and fish saucy!!! \n\nI was overwhelmed with food envy after trying bf's vegetarian Khao So Gai. The egg noodles were perfectly toothy, and the red curry was mighty fine. You could tell they spent time developing flavors (which I'm always a fan of). I ate the mustard greens because he didn't.

If you're not used to shrimp paste I would recommend avoiding this. It was a layered dip of shrimp paste, pork jowl, catfish served with a variety of Thai crudit\u00e9s for dipping. If you love authentic Thai with very strong flavors you must get this. \n\nBraised beef cheeks-the cheeks were very tender and moist but the curry sauce could have been more complex. At $35 for a curry I think this one could be skipped over\n\nPork belly-very tender and oh so caramelized. I think this dish was intended to be sweet but I felt it was a tad overly sweet and probably could have used a bit more salt. \n\nSticky rice- their version of sticky rice is extremely sticky and a little undercooked and they recommend this for most of their dishes but I  would have gone w jasmine rice which would have soaked up some of the flavors a little better. \n\nAll in all great experience and namprik long rua is one of my favorite Thai dishes and I've only gotten to experience it at one other Thai place in DC.

I have heard a lot about this place for its authentic, soulful take on Thai cuisine and dropped by for a quick lunch during my stay in San Francisco. I am a sucker for Thai food, and had high expectations stepping into the restaurant that looked somewhat out of place, tucked on the backside of Parc 55 hotel. At least the dishes that I sampled, however, were somewhat below the lofty expectations.\n\nI started out with a couple of starter dishes. Pretty hot wings that came with Sriracha glaze were indeed spicy, but the meat was not as well-cooked and the sauce was somewhat less satisfying, with a puzzling blend of spicy, sour and sweet. On the other hand, mushroom terrine immersed in curry mousse in a jar, which sounded so promising, was curiously bland. It seemed like everyone at the restaurant was ordering khao soi, that classic Thai dish of Northern-style chicken curry broth with egg noodles, so I tried it as well along with a side of sticky rice. While I liked the spicy kick of the broth, again the chicken was somewhat not as tender as I had hoped and the overall richness of the dish that I loved so much at a New York Thai restaurant like Uncle Boons was missing. \n\nThe restaurant has a full bar with some playful cocktail options. I tried what was called Hua Hin Beach, an inventive take on Thai iced tea. I'm not sure how crowded the restaurant gets during the dinner, but it was relatively manageable at lunchtime. I always hesitate to assess a restaurant's worth based on one experience at lunch knowing that dinner is the time where the full range of what the kitchen can do show up, but at least the dishes I've had for lunch were, while decent, not as satisfying as I had hoped. Perhaps next time on my visit, I should visit this place again for dinner exploring a larger selection of dishes that may display the full range of Thai cuisine's spice and versatility.", "author": "Ken S."}

It might be a personal preference though, so if you like SUPER fatty pork belly, this might be right up your alley.\n\nBrussels Sprouts: Pretty good, but other than \"sweet\" and \"charred\" I couldn't tell what else made this awesome.

Talk about high maintenance. *rolls eyes*\n\nOpening in late February 2014, I've been closely following famed blogger Pim's restaurant, Kin Khao. We had planned to go on opening week but I was told they wouldn't have chicken for five days to make their Kao Mun Gai (Chicken Rice). What tha heezy? So I waited. In the interim, I heard not so great things from friends who had visited Kin Khao: small portions, high prices, and bad service. I scratched it off my list to try until I recently read Jessica Y.'s rave review and a foodie manager at work told me Kin Khao is a must try. \n\nKin Khao has received a lot of media exposure lately so do come with reservations. By the time we left at 6:30 pm on a Wednesday, there was a small crowd (many tourists) waiting for a table. \n\n~ *~ D R I N K S ~  * ~ \nKin Khao's Thai inspired cocktails ($12) are not to be missed. Their bar menu was created by the Bon Vivants of Trick Dog who make kick ass cocktails. I had the Tom Yum: http://bit.ly/1DlFVIf and the Smooth Thai: http://bit.ly/1suTjkv. Both were really well balanced with prominent Thai flavors (sour, sweet) but I favored the Smooth Thai as it had a deliciously creamy almond flavor from the creme de noyaux. One gripe: why are non-alcoholic drinks $9?! That's ridic. \n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\n*Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine w/ crisp rice cakes ($11): http://bit.ly/1uKmgwx\n*Namprik Long Rua: Kapi Shrimp Paste w/ pork jowl, crispy catfish, salted duck egg ($18): http://bit.ly/1uKmtzS\n*Caramelized Pork Belly ($13): http://bit.ly/1DlG8er\n*Massaman Nuea: Braised beef cheek in Massaman curry paste, potatoes ($25): http://bit.ly/1wsFAyD\n\nHats off to the Chef Gaines (formerly Manresa) for crafting such phenomenal and refined Thai dishes. I was afraid that the food would be dumbed down but I was wrong. He kept the integrity of robust Thai flavor profiles and developed amazing depth of flavor without the use of msg. \n\nThe Mushroom Terrine was excellent albeit a tad bit overly spicy (made Mr. NSS hyperventilate). The crisp rice cakes were a perfect crunchy canvas to the rich, curry-like mushroom terrine. I would have preferred the terrine being served cold though so it's more easily spreadable. \n\nIf you love pungent fobulous foods like me, the Namprik Long Rua is an absolute must order. It's a funky concoction of shrimp paste, fatty pieces of pork jowl, duck yolk, and deep fried pieces of catfish. Slather it on some rice and with each bite, you will have a umami bomb (just as the menu says) in your mouth that's full of wondrous textural contrasts.\n\nAnother fobby fav of mine is Hakkanese Pork Belly so I loved the Caramelized Pork Belly served in a scorching hot claypot. The pork belly is so tender that it melts in your mouth like pork buttah. Pure fatty deliciousness. \n\nWe were stuffed at this point but had to get a taste of the Massaman Nuea. The ginormous chunk of beef cheek was fork tender and the aromatic massamman curry was rich, creamy, and delicious. Their curries are made from scratch and you can tell there's a lot of love put into developing the complexity of each one. Loved the fried shallots for a satisfying crunch.\n\nIt looks like they've listened to their yelp reviews and beefed up their portions which is worth the price tag for the top-notch ingredients used. We had leftovers to feed two more people. Fyi, rice (white or brown) is free.\n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nUnfortunately, their service was not as fantastic as the food so I'm rounding down my rating. Of all the Asian restaurants, I find Thai restaurants to be the most welcoming and hospitable. I know Kin Khao is not an \"authentic\" Thai restaurant per se, but for their $$$ price tag, service seems rather cold and inattentive (I don't doubt the negative reviews). \n\nOur waiter took our order and was never to be seen again. He did drop off extra rice cakes which we didn't request. We had to flag down another waiter (much nicer) for more rice and someone who I believe was the floor manager for more drinks. \n\n ~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nMinimalist and casual with simple wooden furnishings (lacked warmth). For some reason, I expected the ambiance to be more \"upscale\" but I guess they want the food to take center stage. Makes sense. You can't eat ambiance.\n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nUber it or take public transit. Nearest garage is 1.5 blocks away on Ellis-O'Farrell.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Be sure to order lots of rice with your protein dishes!\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nIs it chic? For sure. Is the service good? Definitely. Is the food enjoyable? Yeah, with some caveats. But a Michelin star? REALLY?! Having been here twice now, my trust in Michelin ratings is shaken even more. But, what do I know, I'm just a Yelper. I'll leave the famous ratings to the paid critics. Now, ignoring that...\n\nAcross my two dinners here, I've tried their yum kai dao, nam tok beans, pretty hot wings, caramelized pork belly, and kua kling ribs. You know, things I wouldn't normally find at the usual run of the mill Thai place. And, without getting into them all, I'll say this: they've all been very enjoyable, but the folks in the kitchen are NOT shy about their seasonings. I'm usually not one to speak on this, because I know I eat lighter than most folks, but the friends I've gone with have also commented on how the meat dishes tend towards the too salty (ribs and belly), spicy (ribs), or sweet side (wings).\n\nSo, unless you've killed your taste buds, be sure to order lots of rice on the side. Or, do as I do and bring the leftovers home, to stir fry into something else: the ribs make for an excellent fried rice. Or, perhaps, try asking the kitchen if they're willing to cut the seasoning in half. The place is way too classy for me to do something like swishing my food in a cup of tea.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - It's a modern hotel restaurant, so, not surprisingly, the place is ADA compliant, as far as I can tell. The main/direct entrance to the restaurant is up a flight of stairs, with a manual wheelchair lift to the side. This has been known to not work at times, however, so you may need to head to main entrance of the hotel and wind your way through the back.\n\nBathroom - The restaurant itself doesn't have bathrooms, which are instead located outside, as part of the hotel.

Service was interesting - we were waiting on a 4th person, so we told the waiter to hold off on orders til she came. However, she got delayed, so we told a few other staffers to flag our waiter down so we could order after all. We ended up waiting 15 minutes until I got up and physically walked to our waiter to ask him what the deal was. He was very nice beyond that, but apparently the staff doesn't talk to each other or something.\n\nWe ordered 3 things:\nSTIR FRIED BABY CHOY - Fairly bland. Wouldn't really recommend unless you're in love with bok choy.\n\nNAM TOK BEANS - Amaaaaazing. The right mix of spices, crunch, and the onions added a nice touch. I'd order this again for sure.\n\nYAOWARAJ NOODLES ($17) - Like the bok choy, too bland for my liking. There was a decent amount of chicken and food overall, but it just wasn't tasty, especially for the price. Wouldn't really recommend this.\n\n\nIf you come here, get the Nam Tok Beans.

In the end, I can only taste the saltiness of the dishes and nothing else. \n\nWhat I did not enjoy about this meal was the papaya salad. Please don't get me wrong, I love papaya salads in general and I was looking forward to it. I did not look forward to how its spiciness killed off all of my taste buds for the rest of the meal. Mind you, I can take in a lot of spicy foods, from Szechuan to very spicy Indian foods. The only spicy levels I cannot take was Indian spicy (from Mint Leaf in Berkeley) and soaking my lips in dynamite spicy level (at Craw Station in SF). After I had killed a jug of water trying to rescue what was left of my tongue, I could not even taste that \"hint of lime\" my friend said of the nam tok beans. The only flavor from its long description that I agree with was soy. I could not distinguish anything else.

We ordered some of the more interesting and expensive plates hoping to get the most out of this experience. Oh, we got an experience alright.\n\nWe ordered from this lady who was maybe the manager or even owner and asked to get the ribs. She immediately told me that it was really really spicy and persuaded me not to get it. So we ordered other plates and settled for what sounded \"safe.\" \n\nThey brought out the dishes and brought brown rice instead of the white jasmine rice we ordered. The Khao Kan Jin was decent. More on the good side than bad. We also got the Khun Yai's Rabbit Green Curry which was okay. Meat tasted like chicken and all it was was the rabbit and curry sauce, nothing more. The last dish that came out, the Namprik Long Rua, was extremely salty! I mean I love salty foods but this was not even edible. I usually don't complain about food ever but I had to let our server know my concerns. I was being as gentle and nice about it as possible but sure enough she didn't care.

With a large selection of traditional dishes, the decision on what to order is difficult! Also, beware that they tend to run out of certain options as it gets closer to closing time. We ordered the Massaman Nuea and the Khao Kan Jin...both of which were delicious and spicy (note the giant pepper on the curry). Alongside the majority of dishes, you will need to order a side of rice (normal or sticky rice) for an extra cost. \n\nThe atmosphere here is very fun, the waiters are attentive, the decor is Thai mixed with funk (if that makes sense) and has a very modern vibe.

As delicious as this was, I would definitely recommend splitting this with at least three people (the appetizer comes with four slices)--towards the end of my second slice, I was starting to get a little overwhelmed by the richness of the flavors. However, this is a must try for anyone who visits the restaurant.\n\nBeef cheek curry: good flavors, but was a little underwhelmed after all that delicious pork belly.

It's just amazing food in a really chill atmosphere.

Given the rarity of two dollar sign restaurants with Michelin stars, me and the BF were eager to check it out. Reservations were surprisingly easy and we scored a 7:45pm spot for the same night! (BEWARE: It is definitely more $$$ than $$) \n\nThe first thing to note is that Kin Khao is inside of a hotel. We had a little trouble locating it since we came from the opposite entrance. The restaurant front itself was modern and edgy. We checked in with the host and being a couple of minutes early, we asked if we can wait by the bar. Unfortunately, the bar area consisted of at most 4 stools and there was no room. We ended up standing awkwardly outside in a dim hallway waiting for our cocktails. It wasn't a big deal but some standing room near the bar would be nice! Especially given how delicious the drinks are.\n\nFor cocktails, I had the tom yum (drink not soup!) which had gin, vermouth, and lemongrass. It was probably one of the best cocktails I've had recently -- smooth, refreshing, and with a little kick. The boyfriend had the Mike Thai that was equally good. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded pretty good so we were stuck for a while. There is a tasting menu that includes the more popular dishes such as the nam tok beans, papaya salad, pad kee mao, and the beef curry. It includes dessert for a price tag of $55 per person. Tempting but seemed excessive for a Tuesday night. \n\nWe ended up ordering\n\nSticky rice -- 3 stars\nOur rice arrived way before the other dishes and it felt lukewarm. By the time the actual food arrived, it was already cold. \n\nNam Tok Beans -- 4 stars \nScarlet runner beans (think giant red pinto beans) tossed with chili and seasonings. You are given lettuce leafs to make lettuce wraps with the beans. The server says that people prefer to wrap a bit of the sticky rice alongside the beans -- how weird that a complement to the dish is not provided but had to be ordered separately. Luckily, we had ordered some rice for the other dishes since no one informed us of this pairing beforehand. The beans itself was packed full of flavor. It was a bit salty for me but the boyfriend thought it was great. \n\nCaramelized Pork Belly -- 5 stars \nServed in a clay pot, the pork belly was by far my favorite. The pork belly was perfectly juicy, tender, and so so decadent. The sauce had a tiny hint of fish sauce in it and I loved the combination with the sweetness of the pork fat drippings. I ended up pouring the leftover sauce all over my sticky rice. My only complaint is that I wish there was more than just 4 (albeit thick) pieces but even at $5 per piece, I would get this every time. \n\nPad Kee Mao -- 3 stars \nFlavorful but soooo oily. However, I did appreciate the fresh rice noodles. Apparently, there's a limited amount per day and they do run out. I just wish the the dish wasn't so greasy. \n\nBlack Rice Pudding -- 4 stars \nDIY with burnt coconut sugar caramel, salty coconut cream, puffed rice+peanut+sesame praline as toppings on the side. I liked the concept since I normally find restaurant desserts to be too sweet. \n\nAfter everything, our bill came to be around $120 with tip. While still cheaper than other Michelin star restaurants, it's ridiculously expensive for Thai food. After eating $1 pad thai on the streets of Bangkok, it's hard for me to pony up that much $$$ for a bowl of noodles. I understand there's paying for atmosphere and service but Kin Khao didn't exceptionally deliver on those fronts either.

This isn't your typical mom-and-pop Thai restaurant in the Tenderloin - this is an excellent eatery that's attracted the attention of other chefs, hot heads, and hungry partiers alike. \n\nKhao Soi Gai is a favorite (it's a northern Thai dish) and Kin Khao's rendition is even better than House of Thai's. Hot dang! So much flavor, depth... and so much of it. It doesn't come cheap at $15 but this is decidedly elevated Thai food.\n\nThirsty? This is a Thai restaurant with a real (and ambitious) cocktail program. Our French friend chose a wonderful bottle of celebratory bubby and we may have dabbled in some beer, too. I think this is the first time I've described a Thai spot as fabulous, and I'm already plotting my next visit!\n\nDinner served 'til 1am nightly and last call for drinks follows at 1:30.

The wait staff kept trying to bring us the wrong dish or dishes that we've already ordered. It was bizarre how utterly disorganized these people were. There was a large party right next to us and it was impossible for our table to get any service. \n\nWe ordered 3 apps and 2 entrees. They brought us 4 apps (they put another plate of beans on our table although we refused it a precious time because we got that item already) and only one out of the two entrees. The waitress told us that they would just give the extra app to us for free (they charged us for it). We waited half an hour for the bill because we simply could not get their attention. No one brought us water either, and with the high level is salt in some of their dishes, the lack of water made the meal such an unpleasant experience. \n\nI don't give out many 2 star reviews, but the sheer incompetence of the staff is mind boggling. They weren't rude, they just didn't know what they were doing. The restaurant has been open for at least 2 months when we went so this amateur service is inexcusable.", "author": "Alice W."}

You can make it to your tasting with the coconut milk, salted caramel and the nuts and crunchies. \n\nCocktails were your typical drinks but with a twist.

Our server suggested the  Nam Tok Beans-Scarlet Runner beans tossed Isaan-style with lime, chili, toasted rice powder, light soy, shallots, scallions, mint, and cilantro (I'm copy pasted from the menu here; there is no way I'd remember all of this), which were really delicious. I had never heard of Scarlet Runner beans before, but they were hearty and were like a purple lima bean. The Massaman curry-Braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry paste, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes-was our entree of choice, which my husband devoured. Super inventive cocktails-'The Artist's Reward with mezcal, maraschino, grapefruit, lime,\npeychaud bitters, szechuan pepper salt is one that I find myself wanting all of the time now.

Yes, it was a taaad bit overpriced, but I think the dishes were very good and I felt justified spending that amount.\n\nThe second time, I would give it 2 stars. I was greatly disappointed especially after my previous positive experience here. I ordered the wings, ground pork & shrimp, fava beans & peas entree, the squid entree and a side of sticky rice. The wings were overly salty and vinegary. Then the pork & shrimp and sticky rice came was SO SALTY!! It was basically inedible without rice. Even then it was too salty. The sticky rice was good, and was generally the only thing I enjoyed this time around, and was served in a larger portion than the last time I came here (at the same price point. Before it was in a small one serving small bamboo basket). The squid was different than the one I had before. This time its a series of small squids in a salty peanut, citrusy sauce. And yes, this dish was also very salty and a little too sour. I have no idea how many pitchers of water we went through but the food was so salty that we went through many rounds or refills (pitcher refills)!

I probably wouldn't order this again.\n-Laab Tod (Spicy, Herb-y Pork Meatballs Served w/Jaew Sauce, Veggies, Sticky Rice, $16): Just ok, nothing special.

However, it was worth it to try once. \n-Khao Soi Gai (Chicken Curry Broth, Egg Noodles, Pickled Mustard Greens, Served w/Spicy Chili Oil, $15, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2?select=I3pjxvokthNfMJN_rdfCqQ#I3pjxvokthNfMJN_rdfCqQ): Pretty good, although it was on the pricey side. However, the curry broth was really flavorful, but I probably wouldn't order this again.\n-Khao Mun Gai (Chicken Fat Rice, Ginger-Poached Chicken, Pim's Secret Sauce, Served w/Cup of Chicken Broth, $15): Just ok- the chicken we had was a bit dry. Skip!\n-Black Rice Pudding (Warm Coconut/Black Rice Pudding, Served w/Burnt Coconut Sugar Caramel, Salty Coconut Cream, Puffed Rice/Peanut/Sesame Praline on the Side): Super delicious, and we would've ordered another one if we weren't so full from the food.\n\nWe also tried a few of their cocktails, but I'm not a big cocktail person, so wasn't a fan of the ones we tried (they were also really strong tasting). My friends also weren't big fans, so we would skip the cocktails if we came back:\nTom Yum (Tanqueray Gin, Imbue Vermouth, Lime, Galangal, Lemongrass, Abbots Bitters, KaffIr Leaf, $12), Mike Thai (Denizen Rum, Mount Gay Black Barrel, Combier, Lime Juice, Pineapple Juice, Rrgeat, Allspice Dram, $12) & Kathoey Collins (Akvinta Vodka, Chareau Liqueur, Lime, Blue Flowers, $12).\n\nService was solid, and overall, we had a good meal here, although I'm not in a hurry to come back.

Lots of Laotian people speaking the native language (I understand both so can make out the differences). If anything, it's more of an attempt for a fusion restaurant. My assumption is that they say it's Thai food because Laos is less common and no one typically searches for \"Laos\" food when looking for places to eat?\n\nThe food is good though! It is situated in a hotel and right across the Hilton Union Square, so it has a more fancier vibe. Price skews towards the higher side (e.g., I ordered the pork noodle dish for $18 and a side of pickles for $4. I also got the rice pudding dessert for $10!). Actually, it's really, really expensive for what you get. Why did I eat here? I don't know. Just wanted to try it!\n\nFood came out fast and service was cool.

The first we received was the khao kan jin, which was a little disappointing.  It was not bad, it was just rather low on flavor and at times almost insipid.  Second was the khao yum, which was great.  Tons of varied flavors and ingredients, with a healthy amount of sweet mixed throughout.  Last was the rabbit green curry, which was excellent as well.  A little steep at $35 for a bowl of rabbit and curry, but it was good.  A solid amount of heat, which stayed consistent rather than build as we ate it.  Good flavor and superb tender rabbit. My wife had the thai tea soft serve for dessert, which she said was very good. Service was friendly and prompt.  A solid meal for some more innovative thai cooking.", "author": "A. L."}

Thai food is one of my favorite cuisines due to its spicy kick, coconut based curries, and you can literally eat a wide variety of dishes in one sitting. One day at work I was randomly surfing the Internet trying to find the next \"hot\" spot to go to in San Francisco - that didn't burn a hole in my wallet. I came across the new 2015 Michelin star restaurants list (you know our generation loves lists and it helps us dictate what we do next) and Kin Khao had just got a Michelin star rating. \n\nWhen you first walk into the restaurant you feel like you're back in Asia - very packed restaurant, long lines out the door, and can smell the spices looming around the restaurant. I can immediately sense the great service, very personable, quick, and makes sure you have a personalized experience. \n\nI started off with the Yum Yai Salad and can I say for having huge lumps of lettuce in it it turns out to be such a good salad - from its bitter/sweet dressing, fried, saut\u00e9ed, and fresh vegetables. This will make your palets go wild! \n\nFor main entrees I got the Pad Kee Mao (such a good spicy kick to it) with perfect cooked noodles (it's always the worse when you get hardened noodles), very wet with a sweeter sauce, and fresh vegetables.\n\nLastly, I am not a huge fan of having red meat with Thai food but the Massaman is a beef dish doused in curry, spices, onions, and a special yellow paste. The beef is so tender and cooked to perfection and every bite feels like you're having a filet mignon at a fancy steak house.\n\nWe all know how hard it is to get reservations in San Francisco. Sometimes I have tried to make reservations 4-5 weeks ahead of time and still can't manage to get a table. You will be surprised Kin Khao you can get a table for a small group (2-4) around a week ahead.\n\nCheck out the restaurant and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Kunal T."}

Super unique and reminded me of Thai, but also had a twist on what I was used to. Same with the bean sprouts and fried egg - YUM! I'll also give an honorable mention to the beef cheek curry. I love beef but I'm not personally huge on the texture of cheek. However, it worked perfectly in this dish. For $55, this tasting menu is absolutely the way to go if you want to have a fun and playful meal. \n\nI have one comment about the decor of this restaurant - it confuses me because it's weirdly plain and feels a bit office-y to me.

Kin Khao is in a hotel, which means that the bathrooms are actually located in the hotel lobby. We came on a Sunday night and were seated promptly at the bar, but noticed that during our meal, the restaurant filled up significantly. Aka: make reservations if you have more than 2 people and don't want to wait for the communal table.\n\nThe bartenders were super friendly and happy to explain everything on the menu and make recommendations. \n\nWe had:\n- Nam Tok Beans (beans as lettuce wraps)\n- Plah Pla Muek (citrusy, spicy squid with peanuts)\n- Rabbit green curry \n- Jasmine rice\n- Sticky rice\n\nEverything was 4 out of 5 stars. Super delicious and very unique, extremely prominent flavors. Note: everything is pretty spicy, so if you cannot handle spice, I do not recommend coming here unless you're able to convince the chefs to make yours mild.\n\nThe beans were super interesting - flash fried black beans (again, spicy) served as lettuce wraps. Great with a bit of sticky rice to cut the flavor. \n\nThe rabbit green curry was super delicious, but I'm not sure that $35 green curry with an exotic meat is substantially better than $12 green curry with chicken from any other Thai restaurant in SF.\n\nOverall, this place has a great vibe and food really is very good.

The mushroom flavor is not strong but the custard-y texture of the curry is so good with the cracker!\n\n[ Sum Tom Papaya Salad ] One of the best papaya salad I ever had...it's also one of the spiciest I ever had, so becareful! Nevertheless, tangy and refreshing!\n\n[ Blistered Chinese Long Beans ] This is one of the most flavorful dish! It's made with XO sauce, and you can't go wrong with XO sauce, which contains dried scallops + dried shrimp + dried ham + ginger + garlic...in order words...salt on salt on salt! Yum!\n\n[ Pretty Hot Wings ] I like how most of the items on the menu has a Thai name except for this one. But it's pretty self-explanatory. These are indeed hot, but not as hot as the papaya salad. Also, it's SO salty...in an odd way too. Not a fan of the sauce that coat around the wings.\n\n[ Pad Kee Mao ] These drunken noodles are so good! You can totally taste the \"wok\" flavor. \n\n[ Massaman Nuea ] Braised beef cheeks in Massaman curry. This was just okay. The beef was super duper tender, however, the curry wasn't as good as I thought. \n\n[ Kua Kling Ribs ] The ribs I had was pretty dry and not very tender.

Curries, spices -- something about getting an influx of those powerful flavors feels incredible.\n\nKin Khao is definitely one of the most stand-out Thai places that I've been to, meaning that the menu wasn't limited to Pad Thai and curries with the basic proteins (chicken, tofu, beef, pork, shrimp), but it had choices like rabbit as well. That said, with it being a fairly new restaurant as of the date of this review (March 11th, 2014), it still experienced some service flaws and it felt like the place wasn't running quite like a well oiled machine just yet. The food, although creative and bold to some extent suffers from a lack of ultimate execution in my eyes. While I give it four stars, it's being pretty generous (and giving them a break for only being open for a few weeks) and my experience was more on the 3.5 level.\n\nAmbiance:\nChic, modern and casual. Lots of wooden tables and one larger communal table that I ended up coming to dine at alone (but met a fellow solo traveler and we ended up talking for hours). Lots of points for having a communal table! Nice place to bring a date.\n\nFood:\nI tried the Yum Kai Dao as an appetizer, which on the menu is listed as a runny-yolk deep fried duck egg \"salad\", chilli jam dressing, peanuts, shallots, mint, cilantro, cucumber. It's definitely one of the most interesting salads I've had to date and I loved it. It was quite spicy, especially when I got little pieces of chilli, but I really enjoyed the fried duck egg on top and how it mixed with all the other ingredients.\n\nFor my entree, I received the Khun Yai's Green Curry with Rabbit which I really enjoyed, but felt like the dish would have been perfected by having no bones in the rabbit meat (it took away from the experience) and adding more vegetables to it. Although the menu states the dish also had \"Thai Apple Eggplant,\" I really only tasted the rabbit, curry and rabbit meatballs. I would have loved there to be potatoes, broccoli, peppers or some other veggies to blend into the curry, but that was lacking.\n\nService:\nWas fine, but a few key points: I had to ask for rice specifically (and I asked for brown rice) with my curry. They didn't charge me for it, but if I didn't specifically ask for it...it wouldn't have come. I didn't get a small bowl to mix my food in like my neighbor did and when I finally asked for one...I ended up getting a small plate and not bowl, which was inconvenient and inconsistent.\n\nFood/Price Balance:\nIt's a unique experience, so it's worthwhile -- but the place is pretty pricey. I expect more for the value they charge, both in terms of creativity, service and taste. The experience was more 3.5 stars, but I give it a 4 because it's new and hopefully they'll listen to the feedback and get the kinks worked out.", "author": "Alex L."}

The average age in this restaurant at 8pm on a Friday was around 28, which was fine by me, but it's probably not the kind of place you would take your grandma. We were able to walk in and get a table without a reservation, which was awesome!\n\nWe ordered the Pretty Hot Wings to start, which as the name suggests, were pretty hot but not blow your lid off hot. My husband thought they were too spicy, but for me they were good...I think it would be mild-ish if you're used to Thai-level spiciness. The wings were tasty, and had a pretty good balance of sour/spicy/sweet. They were definitely difficult to eat, so I wouldn't order them if you were trying to be neat. haha\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) and the Massaman beef curry with a side of sticky rice. I was surprised the curry didn't come with rice, so that was kind of a bummer that we had to pay an extra $4 for something that it should just have with it. I really enjoyed the curry...The meat was so tender it just fell apart, and the curry sauce was extremely flavorful. The drunken noodles were also great. I would recommend both.\n\nOverall, a great restaurant in Union Square with more locals than tourists. I would come here again.", "author": "Jessi C."}

We ordered the Papaya Salad, the Wild Boar Laab and the Yaowaraj noodle. I love Thai food but I also realize that as an American my palate for Thai food is very different from what \"authentic\" Thai food is. Having said that, the Papaya Salad and the Laab were SO spicy. And the menu says \"spicy\" but we were not prepared. The papaya salad had some complexity with the sour and spicy so it was good even though our mouths were on fire. The Laab however, just tasted like heat to me with very little other flavors so that was a little disappointing. It was very spicy but also bland bc it needed salt. The noodles were delicious. In the future I would definitely be mindful of their spicy dishes before ordering and I advise other diners who are heat-shy to do the same.", "author": "Zoey M."}

We went for dinner and got seated right away but more luck than anything. Have reservations if you don't want to wait. Menu is simple with offers of a fixed course type experience. Being with the family we chose to go a la carte. Service was good but sadly food was not up to all the what the rave was all about. If you want the scene of being in a hip place that is hard to get in and pay for way overpriced food then this place is for you!  \n\nWe ordered:\n* Wild boar laab - super spicy by any standard so be warned!  Tasty and the best dish on the night and only reason for the 3 stars. \n* Caramelized pork belly (which was never put in the system by our waiter) - never came so didn't try...\n* Massamun nuea - beef cheeks were super tender and curry sauce was not overly sweet. It was great till half way and you realized it was a bit too salty. \n* Mushroom hor mok terrine - this many people post pics of and you feel like you don't want to miss this.. Go ahead and miss it. It was bland and didn't offer anything special you would write home about\n* Kids pad kee mao (off menu made on request) - this nearly made me write a 1 star review. The bill came with this dish with sauce and noodle only no veg or meat at all costing $31!!!  Are you kidding me!  We asked the wait staff to look at this and they said oh our mistake and reduced it down to $12... \n\nTheir lunch menu is different and seems more Thai street food than their dinner but we will not try as there are more interesting places in SF to explore.", "author": "Ake H."}

When we walked in, I was surprised by where it was located. It seemed to be located in a business center or some apartment lobby, not sure which, but it was interesting. Next we walked in, all the servers were caucasian, the audience is very caucasian based as well. When we entered, we were seated immediately, and the lady took care of us. She saw that I was looking at my yelp to find some good selection, she gave me some advice. To my surprise, there was no pad see ew, or a lot of classic dishes you can find at a thai restaurant. My friend then told me this location is a seasonal restaurant with a changing menu. Lunch and dinner is different and that dinner is a lot pricier. I have to say I enjoy the atmosphere, the decor, and all the dishes used. It was very hipster and cute, providing a good vibe to the location. The server was great, gave us suggestions. we ordered two different dishes. He got a soup that reminded very closely to laksa. He ordered the khao soi- which was a northern-style chicken curry broth, egg noodle, pickled mustard greens, shallots. and lime. I ordered the pad kee mao-a stir-fried drunken noodle with ground pork. rice noodle, garlic, birds eye chili, onion bell peppers, and holy basil. I didn't like my dish as much as I thought I would. It tasted like the beef dry stir fry noodle at restaurants except.. spicy. My friend's soup was pretty good, I was never a fan for curry but it was pretty good! This location, has no parking, menu is a bit pricey, service is mediocre, but I would say that have a good feel and decor to it.", "author": "Amy Y."}

However, the mushrooms were a good addition. \n\nKua Kling Ribs\nSpicy dry-fried pork riblets in southern-style tumeric curry paste, kaffir lime leaves\n- 1 star: I LOVE my spice, but these riblets were COVERED in super spicy dry powder.

I went to Kin Khao a few weeks after it opened (and again a few weeks later) and the highlights for me were the Pad Kee Mao, Khao Mun Gai (chicken fat rice. yup, CHICKEN FAT RICE), and caramelized pork belly (only available for dinner). The Pad Kee Mao was pretty spicy but flavorful, and the chicken fat rice was so simple, but delicious! If you're looking for decadence, the caramelized pork belly was seriously so good and came out piping hot in a clay pot. Eat it with white rice or sticky rice and you'll be in a happy place!\n\nAs for cocktails, all of them sounded interesting and delicious!

More importantly, the birthday girl and her guests had fun!\n\nI'm glad I made it in time for some appetizers.  The Mushroom Hor Mok was a great intro to dinner.  With spicy peanut sauce spread onto a rice cracker, I could snack on this all night long.  But I had to control myself.  After several bites in, I was getting excited to taste what was to come.  The Yum Yai salad didn't do much for me, and the Hot wings were mainly tangy with mild heat.  I wish I was having a Four Roses Manhattan at this point.  But on to more food!\n\nMassaman curry was my favorite dish here, with huge portions of the most tender braised beef cheeks.  I normally get this tamarind & coconut-infused curry at most Thai places and Kin Khao's version is top notch!  \n\nRabbit Green Curry was my second favorite.  Green curry had a nice kick to it...and I don't mean the rabbit leg.  The spicy coconut flavor was addicting and complimented everything in this dish, including the tasty rabbit meatballs. \n  \nCaramelized pork belly is another must-have.  So much flavor and tenderness in this clay pot dish.  Their Stir fried Baby Bok Choy was more like a palate cleanser for me.  I'm sure my stomach was thankful for this simple dish.  \nFinally, the Black Rice Pudding was a perfect finish to this multiple course dinner, especially with all the spices from the curries and sauces.

My server (who is always the same guy, all 10 times I've been here) made a bet: try the food I accidentally ordered, and if I didn't like it, he'd order me the entree I wanted and comp it. There was no need - the first bite I took of the dish, it was over. Meal consumed. I knew this place was a winner :)\n\nNow, given I've been here 10 times, I do have to say I ate here today with some colleagues and something was missing.

Every thing else (soy lime dressing, toasted coconut, shallots, mint, cilantro) came together pretty well.\n\nMEATS: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2?select=7eucdMxQq4YwczHDc7XbRw#zEbH_ilaZKY_0ecx1aTaZQ\n* Kua Kling Ribs (spicy dry-fried pork riblets in southern-style turmeric, curry paste, kaffir lime leaves. $15)  - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2?select=7eucdMxQq4YwczHDc7XbRw#J60xpGyBgKYMt1_YdF8vww\nSurprisingly, this was my favorite! The dry rub actually gave the ribs a really great texture. It wasn't messy, but it was a full of flavor, with a light fuzzy texture. Reminds me of pork floss, which I grew up with at home! The meat itself, despite being in a dry rub and even looking dry, was actually really great. It wasn't dripping in oil or sauce, but still retained a lot of moisture in its texture once you bit in.\n\nNOODLES & RICE PLATE: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2?select=7eucdMxQq4YwczHDc7XbRw#F8YHRfZ6TWNh28__2eVrFw\n* Pad Kee Mao (vegetarian: drunken noodles, tofu, rice noodles, garlic, chili, onions, bell peppers, holy basil. $14) - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2?select=7eucdMxQq4YwczHDc7XbRw#tf27gPGvsEim7QEiYvdWiQ\nThis was good but it didn't overly impress me. I thought the rice noodles were a little hard. It was very spicy but didn't have much flavor otherwise.\n\nDESSERT:\n* Black Rice Pudding (warm coconut + black rice pudding, w/ burnt coconut sugar caramel, salty coconut cream, puffed rice+peanut+praline on the side. $8) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kin-khao-san-francisco-2?select=7eucdMxQq4YwczHDc7XbRw#7eucdMxQq4YwczHDc7XbRw\nThis was a little plain, but the coconut cream had this great savory hit, and that, the caramel, and the crisped rice all came together pretty well.

I tried this place out very recently, ordering the Khao Mun Gai and the Khao Soi, as well as the Tiger Woods and Wrecking Ball drinks. The Khao Mun Gai is definitely top notch - amazingly prepared sticky rice with a spicy/salty house sauce next to one of the best chicken you'll find in San Francisco. The best part is that the chicken is poached - there is hardly any oil or grease to distract from the freshness of the meat. When you add the \"Pim's secret sauce\", it's a recipe for success. \n\nI found the Tiger Woods drink to be pleasantly unique, although a bit on the \"too sour\" side. Try it and you won't be bored, though. \n\nDisappointments: \nThe Khao Soi, one of their most popular dishes according to the hostess that took our order. However, I was very unimpressed, as it was hardly distinguishable from other curry noodles I've had around the bay area (Noodle Theory comes to mind). And when considering the price, it truly hit me as a dud.\n\nThe Wrecking Ball Thai Iced Coffee is nothing special. Skip it.", "author": "Matthew L."}

The noodles and broth lacked flavor and depth from the curry powder, and were more oily than anything. The presentation for everything was great, but flavors were lacking in all departments.

Warning: Even when you order these with tofu it looks like ground beef. I had to verify twice with the waitress because I was sure they had made a mistake on my order.

It was good but I'd be fine skipping it in the future.\n\nOverall I appreciated that the food was very flavorful without being overly spicy or overly sweet. Too many Thai places make their food so spicy that it really drowns out the flavor.\n\nThe disappointing thing about Kin Khao is that the ambiance is really lacking.

But I was just SO disappointed with my experience with this restaurant. We had a show at 8pm at the Orpheum Theatre so we showed up here a little before 6pm. They told us the wait would be about an hour and we weren't too hungry yet so we figured we could wait it out, have a quick meal, and walk over to the theatre in time for the show. We sat around until after 7pm and went to ask the hostess how much longer it would be. She tells us that they're waiting for another table of 2 to leave so that they could combine two tables for us, so it'll probably be another 20 minutes. That was officially going to cut it too close so we decided to leave. On our way out, we noticed there were at least 2 tables of 4 that were available. Why couldn't they have seated us there...? Literally no more than 2 minutes after we walked away, they called to tell us our table was ready. NOPE. Sorry, too little too late. We were SO excited to try out this place based on the reviews and pictures, but I am super disappointed by how it all went down.", "author": "Richelle T."}

Came here with the girlfriend for Valentines day and our bellies were happy. Prices are steeper than the typical Thai place but well worth it. We just finished ordering and smelled something great, asked the waiter and he couldn't track it down for us. The food overall was pretty good (i can't recall all the dishes we ordered except the pork belly which was mouth watering and melting, definitely recommend it and the chicken wings). The one thing I was disappointed about was ordering 15 minutes before the family next to us and our waiter served both our tables and coincidentally we both ordered the same sticky rice and chicken wings but the table next to us got it 10 minutes before us and we had to track down a different waitress to check on our order. I don't want to think that the waiter (whom was indian) was bias and gave our friendly family neighbors (also indian) the privilege to eat first and not give us the same attention and care. That was my only gripe, overall the food was good and it's a good place to bring a date if you like the loud environment.", "author": "Kevin W."}

The dishes and flavors might been Americanized.\" Oh, I was wrong. My friend and I ordered the Yum Kai Dao, Sai Ua + Namprik Noom, and Black Cod Taypo Curry. All the dishes were delicious with very bold flavors, they definitely didn't skimp on the spice. The Black Cod Curry was my favorite. The curry was incredibly rich and the cod was so tender. This is a bit pricey for Thai food, it's probably because they now have that shinny new Michelin star. For two people bill came out to be about $75. I definitely do want to come back and try more of their dishes.", "author": "Cindy A."}

The barman was very helpful and let us sample some wines before we got our glasses and even recommended the best way to eat the scrumptious mushroom and rice cake dish. The flavours of the foods were out of this world, a slight spice but not too heavy. We wished our stomachs could hold more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-11", "description": "Here are the quick and dirty reasons to try Kin Khao:\n\n1) Incredibly delicious Thai food that you won't find at your local takeout joint. (Unless said joint is in Thailand.)\n\n2) Attentive and professional staff who know how to run a proper dinner service, but keep it casual and comfortable. \n\n3) An accessibly priced Michelin Starred restaurant of non-western style food. \n\nThis is seriously well done Thai food. The flavors and dishes are authentic in a way that makes you question what us Americans have been eating all this time. You won't see any Pad Thai here! \n\nWords to the wise: while the interior is pleasantly decorated, it's in a weird location in the back of a hotel lobby. Also, my friends who are vegetarians were less blown away by the experience.

I love that. I also love that the staff is friendly and eager to suggest what they enjoy the most. Now, let's get down to the flavor. I found nothing to be spicy, SO if you don't like spicy food, you're safe here. I did ask for dried chili peppers, and thy didn't have them. Instead they offered my chili oil. My dish Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles), would have been absolutely 5 stars had it been spicy enough, and with the dried chili's. The wings are delicious, but a little sweet for my liking but they were cooked PERFECTLY. Juicy, crunchy, piping hot.\nThe Khao Soi I LOVE LOVE LOVE (in Chiang Mai), but found it here to be a little flat, and lacking in that richness of the dish near and dear to me that I've been eating for the last 15 years of my life. Believe me, if I see Khao Soi on the menu, I ALWAYS order it. You should too for that matter. It's a special dish, and take it if you can get it! Overall, it's a fun experience.

Yet another Michelin star restaurant with an affordable price point. \n\nSo my friend and I decided to take a trip to the city specifically to dine at Kin Khao. \n\nThis is a fairly small restaurant, maybe 30 ish tables max? So definitely make a reservation ahead of time since it gets packed. \n\nThe food- absolutely delicious. We went family style and shared three small dishes and a dessert. In total, it costed about $30-$35 each. Not bad at all. \n\nThe ambiance- not very fancy but definitely stylish. \n\nThe service: great, loved them 5/5\n\nHighlight of the night: their dessert. Don't pass up on it", "author": "Valerie C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-18", "description": "On my second visit to Kin Khao I learned that their presentation and menu have changed: they decided to present most of their items as small plates, leaving the curries as the main entrees. This did not end up affecting our experience as mostly every dish was executed perfectly. As with most restaurants serving small plates, to get the most out of this restaurant it's best to have a party of 4 minimum. \n\nMany thanks to the webmaster as the site now presents with the most current menu! \n---\n\nNEW DISHES\n- Pretty Hot Wings (Nam Pla fish sauce+garlic marinade, pretty spicy tamarind + Sriracha glaze). Self-expalantory as those wings did catch my attention. The Sriracha and fish sauce makes for a more 'umami' wing than usual with the spice bomb. \n- Wok-Charred Brussel Sprouts in XO Sauce (XO sauce = dried scallops + dried shrimp + dried ham + ginger + garlic). My dining guests say that this is the best brussel sprouts they ever had. For me it's a different way to approach brussel sprouts as the sauce makes it more sweet. It's best to be used as a side vegetable to a less-sweet main. \n- Laab Tod (Spicy, herb-y Devil's Gulch Ranch pork meatballs served with jaew sauce, veggies, sticky rice). It's supposed to be made as a lettuce wrap but to me I ate this as a small rice dish with everything surrounding the rice. \n- Caramelized Pork Belly (Sweet, savory, voluptuous pork belly cooked in a clay pot). A *fat* pork belly is a *good* pork belly. Sauce was sweet but it didn't take away from the essence of the pork belly meat. \n- Black Rice Pudding (Served with burnt coconut sugar caramel, SALTY coconut cream, puffed rice + peanut + sesame praline all on the side. Think of it as a make-it-yourself Thai Sundae). This is an excellent dessert provided that you are either more adventurous to try more \"unusual\" ingredients (compared to standard American/European classics) or are used to similar ingredients. I like red bean so the actual pudding is very similar to red bean. Eating the pudding by itself is bland and the challenge is to mix the sides to make it a better pudding. I was able to find that combination and it's good for people that don't like their desserts too sweet. The puffed rice/peanut/sesame praline is excellent to eat by itself. \n\n---\nIN SUMMARY\nProvided that my group likes Thai food, Kin Khao will be my restaurant of choice to SF visitors and locals alike should they want to stay in the more populated areas of SF and want to try a more conventional restaurant that the local foodies would flock to that doesn't have fusion elements or have an unusual dining concept (SBP, Lazy Bear). Though it's Parc 55's hotel restaurant it is certainly more down-to-earth and more hip than a lot of the hotel restaurants out there. It strives to be authentic yet keep up with the ethos of other SF restaurants and use authentic, locally-sourced, high-quality ingredients or any combination of the above.\n\nSuggested Ordering (party of 3-4)\n2-3 appetizers, one being Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine.\nRice\nOne heavy meat dish, which can also include the Pretty Hot Wings. \nSide green (brussel sprouts or bok choy, depends on how heavy is the meat dish)\nOne curry dish. The meat involved would be ideally lighter than the heavy meat dish.\n(Optional: Pad Thai. Pim's pad thai is serious business and is unlike any other pad thai dish I've ever encountered)\nSweet (Black Rice Pudding or Thai iced teas)\n\nPS: Despite Pim being quite vocal in her blog and book she is quite approachable when you meet her.", "author": "Isabella B."}

In short, I didn't care for the dishes we ordered, and for that reason I feel we paid way too much for what we actually experienced. With tax we paid $85 + $15 tip = $100 for the dishes described below, one glass of wine, and one diet Coke. I've had far more enjoyable Thai meals for under $50 in many of the dozens of Thai places on the Peninsula.\n\nThe GOOD - Service was friendly, efficient, and attentive, and the food was served fairly quickly. Also, the noise level was tolerable which I attribute to the acoustic ceiling tiles and other features of the ceiling. I wish more restaurants invested in noise abatement.\n\nThey serve a Riesling which my girlfriend really liked.\n\nThe BAD - Nam Tok Beans = way way too salty and the dish itself didn't seem fresh; rather, it seemed like it may have been cooked the day before. This dish was disappointing.\nWild Boar Laab Kua = On the menu this dish sounds delicious but instead of having a complex array of flavors, I found it to have just a single rather overwhelming flavor of chili spice. It's not that was too hot (I like hot and spicey), it's that the flavor was overwhelming like they got the proportions wrong. I realize that probably they *didn't* get the proportions wrong, but that's how it tasted to me.\n\nThe OK - Khao Yum = this salad was interesting but not so interesting that I'd order it again. I wish now that we had ordered Som Tum Papaya Salad instead.\n\nSticky rice = There was nothing wrong with the rice...but hey, it's rice.\n\nMaybe their other dishes are better, but I'll never know as I'm unlikely to return to this highly-rated place.", "author": "Matt G."}

I am not sorry that I have used an exclamation mark to emphatically punctuate every single sentence in this paragraph! \n\nMy dear friend and I splurged for a special occasion, and now I want everyone to experience the gastronomic heaven that I experienced:\n\n*Pretty Hot Wings - uhm...pretty AMAZING hot wings. On the spiciness scale, I'd say it falls perfectly halfway between a hot cheeto and tears of death. The fish sauce flavoring is perfect. The only other time I've had chicken wings like these were surprise, surprise: at Pok Pok in Portland. Which is also known for unabashedly serving Northern Thai food. I see a trend here, and I like it!! \n\n*Laab Tod - meatballs that are to be drizzled with the accompanying chili sauce. Delivery method: lettuce wraps with sticky rice. WOW. I am a huge fan of contrast in every bite of food, and boy does this dish do it for me. The warm, soft meatball against the cold, crisp lettuce. The spiciness of the chili sauce against the sweetness of the sticky rice. I could go on for hours, or you could just order these and see for yourself. \n\n*Namprik Long Rua - was delicious as it was a joy to behold. The colors of all the accompanying chopped fruits/vegetables from the watermelon radish to the vibrant mango is truly the kind of food scene Instagram itself dreams about. You're supposed to have a bite of the fruits/veggies following a bite of the catfish/duck egg/pork jowl concoction in order to balance out its strong savoriness. It's all so good combined with that sticky rice! We asked our waitress to recommend something very uniquely \"Northern Thai\" that you won't find at most other Thai restaurants, and she nailed it with this suggestion!  \n\n*Duck Panang curry - at $27, this dish is on the pricey side for what came out, but delectable it was! One single, tender, fall-of-the-bone duck leg was delicately centered in a bath of yellow curry. Out of all the things that could have been bathing in a bath of yellow curry, I don't think I could have imagined anything else with flavors more befitting.

So when I Yelped khao soi, I stumbled upon this place! \n\nUnfortunately, day of my reservation, I discovered they only serve khao soi during lunch :( Noooo... Nonetheless, the food is good, but pricy. To be fair, it's cheaper than your typical Michelin star restaurant. What's crazy though is that khao soi in Chiang Mai is priced typically ~$2 a bowl. Here, it's $18. I bet everyone in Thailand would have a heart attack if they discover it's 10x the price here...\n\nAnywho, onto the food. The plates were all pretty generous and my friend and I barely managed to finish 3 dishes. I was a bit surprised with the entree costs (ranging from $25-50). We ended up splitting the mushroom terrine, ribs, and chicken wings. They were all robust in flavor and definitely spicy!\n\n- Mushroom terrine: good, and my favorite dish. `It's unique and you top the rice krispy-like crackers!\n- Chicken wings: Did not like and the least favorite. My friend and I thought they tasted SUPER sour.... we asked the server if the wings are supposed to have a pronounced sour flavor and there was some communication barrier... so she fetched the manager (?) and told us it is supposed to be sour because of the tamarind. This is a bit strange because I don't see anywhere else on anyone else's review how sour they were. I've had much better Thai chicken wings, like Pok Pok in Portland. I also can't believe it was $4 a wing.\n- Ribs: It had a disclaimer that it's not for Thai noobies, but man, this was delicious! It has a nice kick to it and it's pretty spicy. Be careful not to talk and eat at the same time because you might choke up a little bit.\n- Thai iced tea: typical, although $5 is ridiculous... but I knew I needed this for spicy food! I don't think they give free refills either. Typically $2-3 at Thai restaurants. Yeesh.\n- Long island iced tea: tasted like pure alcohol to me..\n\nBill is reasonable for a Michelin starred restaurant, but overpriced for Thai food. According to previous Yelp reviews, rice used to be free! Now it's a whopping $4. $4!!! I'm tempted to bring my own rice if I ever come back here... Service is pretty good; the server checked back on us a few times. \n\nFor now, I'm giving Kin Khao 2 stars and will try the khao soi for lunch some time. I really do wish they served that during dinner!", "author": "Janet H."}

Never heard of Thai meatballs, but I'm game. I'll have that. Served lettuce-wrap style with a spicy dipping sauce, it's delicious and like nothing else I've had at at Thai restaurant.  But the portion is rather small, so I add the crispy squid (awesomely delicious again, a nice Thai twist on calamari), and the spicy cucumber salad (again, very tasty).  Along the way I have a couple of Phuket punches, a very tasty bittersweet tropical cocktail laced with lime and tumeric, again like nothing I've had anywhere else. (I'd come back here just for the drinks.)\n\nKin Khao is the hotel restaurant at the Parc 55, sort of.  It's in the hotel building, it's highlighted as the hotel's main dining option in the in-room guest literature, but they don't seem to be officially part of the hotel.  You can't charge to your room, for instance, nor do they do room service.  I was just off the plane and starving after a long day of traveling, so as soon as I was checked in I headed straight to Kin Khao.  And didn't regret it; the food was great and those Phuket punches really hit the spot. \n\nBut I did have a bit of sticker shock when the bill came:   $76 before tip, for the meatballs, squid, cucumbers and two drinks.  Quite a tab for what really amounted to three appetizers that left me still feeling a bit hungry, and more than double what you'd pay for a much more filling, albeit more standard and formulaic Thai meal across the street at Old Siam.\n\nOverall, I rate Kin Khao very high for the quality of their food, but knock off a star for price-to-value.  As for atmosphere, there isn't much of that.  It feels like exactly what it is: the corner street-level suite of a modern downtown high-rise hotel.  You sort of get the feeling that they moved in right after Kinko's moved out, and didn't bother changing the decor.  Have a seat over there by the copy machines.  But I suppose that's the sort of ambience that qualifies for hip and trendy these days.\n\nStill, I'll probably be back, when I'm in the neighborhood and feeling flush with money.

This restaurant is inside the corner of a hotel which caught me off guard at first, but the food is packed with flavor in every dish that and it is affordable as well, so you will quickly forget the fact that people wait in the psuedo hotel lobby for their tables. \n\nThis place is small too, so definitely make a reservation but if you have a large group not the place for you. They have only one table for groups of 5 people or more, so it is slim pickins to get that table. So 4 people or less is your goal for dining here, although they do have a walk in communal table as well so they try and cater last minute dining wishes, and I can see how they can because this has to be the fastest food service EVER. Did I even get a chance to eat my food? We ordered about 5 dished for the 4 of us and I swear within a few minutes all of the dishes were already on our table! Definitely no time for us to hang out, chat, sip our cocktails (my thai old fashioned was lovely by the way!), no no no. Eat now. And here is more food. And here is your other order, and here is the last thing you ordered. All at the same time. I would have preferred the food to be spread out since we were done dining in about an hour which is just nuts. \n\nThe best dishes?? RABBIT CURRY hands down. That green curry was some of the most flavorful curry I have ever had and I really had trouble waiting for my friends to take their portion since everything is family style here. So creamy, so amazing, I had to use my spoon to make sure every morsel was gone from that bowl. The caramelized pork belly my goodness. This was so tender it fell apart the second you moved a piece to your plate it had so much pork belly goodness in it. And the nam tok beans--lime, chile, rice powder, shallots, scallions, mint, all put into fun little lettuce wraps, this was so great. The baby bok choy was fine but nothing special and although others in my group liked them, I was not a fan for the kua kling ribs. Something about the flavors in that just did not jive with me.

Our server was really helpful and he suggested that we should get 4 apps and 2 entrees between 4 four people. \n\nFor vegetarian people, try the hor mok mushrooms and nam tok beans, they're both greatttt appetizers. The mushroom dish comes in a jar alongside some rice crispies and it is delish! When I read beans I initially pictured French beans but these are actually Mexican beans that are tangy and spicy. A word of caution if you have a lower spice tolerance like me you are going to find most of their food pretty spicy over here.

Without exploring the menu of Kin Khao first (our mistake) we stopped in here for dinner on a Friday night. We didn't have a reservation so ended up sharing a table. When we first looked at the menu, we were confused by the options and didn't know what to select. Our waiter helped us out and we ended up ordering the squid dish (Plah pla Muek) and the caramelizes pork belly with orders of sticky and jasmine rice on the side. The pork belly was delicious and the squid was overpowered with garlic. This is not a place for authentic Thai food.  It seems the chef is trying for nouveau Thai but to me, if you strip away the authenticity of Thai cuisine, then you should not call it Thai.  I have ordered the pork belly (similar preparation) in a number of other restaurants, there was nothing Thai about it. The squid preparation seem to have some Thai flavors (ginger, lime juice, cilantro, lots of garlic) but again, this isn't authentic Thai to me.

Ha Nam hadn't fully transitioned to their new location on Larkin for her to try the famous 25 dry, so I said okay.. PLAN B! We have Thai. I thought she might be apprehensive because hey, she lives in Los Angeles and Thai food is freaking legit as heck down there. However, Jessica Y has an open mind and was down to try anything. Swoon, that's why I call her my foodsie twin. \n\nWe walked in on a Saturday night without a reservation but lucked out with seats at the bar. Still, I highly recommend a reservation. Kin Khao was still doing their late night hours at the time we dined. When we left close to 10pm, people were still flowing in. Their hours have changed since then, so I guess I won't be getting midnight fixes. \n\nWe shared three dishes and it was probably pushing it. I don't regret it one damn bit though. \n\nYum Yai Salad - a gorgeous mix of raw AND lightly batter fried seasonal veggies. There was a light sprinkling of chili jam dressing mixed in. This is probably one of the best salads I've ever eaten. It is so simple yet so amazingly tasty. The mix of fresh, raw crunchy veggies and crunchy fried veggies were beautifully married together in the chili jam dressing as it was slightly sweet. Again, so simple yet delicious. \n\nNam Prik Long Rua - this is not for those whose tastebuds are faint of heart. this is for the folks who like salty fermented and pickled things. if you're into that type of stuff, you'll like this dish. this is a jar of shrimp paste with caramelized pork jowl (pork cheek), fried catfish, duck yolk. There's a good amount of garlic and fish sauce in there as well. The dish comes with your choice of white or red rice, and a variety of veggies. We mixed a bit of the paste into our rice and would eat it that way (omg, foodgasms just thinking about how good it was) or we spread the paste on the raw veggies given to us. Every now and then, I would take some of the paste and mix it into my rice, and then put it on the veggie anyway. Honestly, it was good any damn way. The menu wasn't kidding when it was described as an UMAMI BOMB. Damn, like for real!? I think my eyes rolled to the back of my head. If you're not into the fermented, the fishy, the salty type stuff... stay away because this isn't for you. Otherwise, DO ORDER THIS. Thank me later. \n\nKhao soi gai - now I've eaten a good amount of khao soi by now. It's become a comfort dish for me. I think Kin Khao's is Northern Thai style which is pretty similar to the original Burmese version. A combo of fried and boiled  noodles and chicken in a coconut curry broth. DO use the pickled mustard greens that come on the side. They add tiny speckled amounts of salty pickled crunchy goodness to the dish. Kin Khao's broth for khao soi is definitely on point. The right viscosity (it's supposed to be thin in case you're wondering), the right amount of sweetness and just the right amount of \n\nKin Khao's menu changes. True to the authentic game, they stick with what is in season. They also cook with sustainably raised or caught meats and seafood. Another plus. Oh, they're inside of the Parc 55 hotel. Just a note in case you have trouble finding it ;)\n\nDo me one favor.. If you're going to make a beeline for this joint, please don't just settle for pad thai and pad kee mao. Be adventurous.

I don't do suburbs well, I must admit. It was a decent restaurant but it was lackluster so you won't see me writing reviews since I generally only write reviews for restaurants that were note worthy. I liked Kin Kaho because it was written in NYT. A few weeks back. I thought it was a place in New York until I read the address. Then it became a Michelin Recommended restaurant. Then the Foodie meet up group was starting to organize food there. I went like, \"crap, I'd never get in.\" When I learned that my friend S was available for dinner, and I was already in Union Square, I took the opportunity to reserve a table. What do you know, they had tables available. First step. Success.\n\nThe place is hard to find. Tonight it was particularly challenging because there was apparently INFORMS annual meeting going on in the hotel. I ought to know what that conference is about, because one of my closest friends goes to that every time because his company exhibits there and he gives speeches and discuss bidnesses. he used to tell me that he's headed to INFORMS conference like he's going to see the Eiffel tower, as if everyone should know what it is. I don't. Never heard of it. And apparently, the only thing I do know after tonight was INFORMS conference people are annoying. They wander about the hotel with their badges like aimless flies looking for a way out of the glass window and they can't quite figure out how. They block my ability to navigate and find the restaurant successfully. Alas, it took me three tries, after I finally gave up and the hotel staff took me to it. So write this down. Mason and Ellis. It's where the closest entrance is. \n\nNow that we conquered the restaurant location, we must figure out what to order after cutting through the line and shove those INFORMs people out of the way (they did not have reservations!). After being led to our table, within minutes I could see why this particular restaurant got the notice from both New York Times and the Michelin. We ordered what Mark Bittman ordered. I saw him live at City Arts and Lectures one year. He ordered the salad (sliced, fried and steamed), so extremely weird combo and yummy. Pork riblet was swimming in umami pond. Wings, hot wings were the best I've had, to-date, and I am obsessed with wings. Finally, their pa thai dish with giant shrimps was very odd - shrimp seemed semi raw, and I love weird food. \n\nHard to have a good conversation as the evening went on as  the restaurant became crowded and people got noisier. As we were thinking to head out to grab coffee, we were stopped short, and sufficiently seduced by the black rice pudding dish.\n\nS and I go on our food date every so often, the last time we went to the Blue Plate. She's one of the smartest, most insightful women I know, we used to do lunches in the upper peninsula as she was a GC for a biotech firm there and I was paying my dues and climbing the corporate ladder at a payment company.\n\nAs we grow older, our taste really changed. We went from going to fast food places to really quality restaurants. We went from partying late on Saturday evenings in the Marina or North Beach to doing three hour brunches at the Cavalier, Nopa, or Bar Tartine. Or dinner at Kin Khao. A good quality restaurant like this one is impossible to miss, even though it's impossible to not get lost while trying to get here.\n\nI like weird and unique food. I like Mark Bittman. I like my companion for the evening. I like the topics we covered tonight. I don't like INFORMS people blocking my way to the restaurant.  So, all in all, I'd say, this was a successful evening.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I ordered the Khao Kan Jin  (steamed pork, rice, and blood sausage in a banana leaf) and the Namprik Long Rua. They were not kidding when they warned that the latter is not a Thai dish for beginners. It's unapologetically funky, intense, savory, and all sorts of good. Get some sticky rice, you'll need it to temper the funk of the namprik relish, which is also served with a whole slew of fresh vegetables and fruits, which provide varying contrasts to mellow out the intense dish. Their cocktails are also incredible, and so are the bartenders that make them. The tom yum cocktail should not be missed, especially if you enjoy the complexity of the soup it's inspired b; the sweet, spicy, sour, flavor you'll find at all good Thai places.", "author": "Willy L."}

I have to admit, when I stopped by Kin Khao upon exiting the Parc 55 hotel, I was expecting some white-washed hipster Thai \"eatery,\" but this spot definitely highlights the powerful flavors and the signature freshness of great Thai cuisine. As you sit by the busy intersection of Mason and Ellis, enjoy the views of the city while you grab and devour the Pretty Hot Wings, a trio of fried chicken wings coated in an intensely tangy and pungently spicy glaze of fish sauce, garlic, and Sriracha. The drink menu has plenty of interesting choices, but I opted for the Turmeric Lime Soda, strongly aromatic and rooty yet crisp and refreshing. The Pork Bowl featured a light pork broth with crispy pork belly and flat rice noodle -- an awesome combo especially when paired with vinegar on the side, but a little underwhelming compared to the flavorful wings that came before. A solid Thai restaurant, though it is a bit on the expensive side. If you're opting for less costly options, there's the Old Siam Thai Restaurant right across.\n\nOverall, a great experience, but the price-for-value might be a little unbalanced due to the hype from their Michelin star.", "author": "William C."}

Quick Yelp resulted in this smallish boutique home style Thai cuisine.\n\nWe started off hydrating in style with some Singha (beer) and Thai Iced tea.  Singha is ur typical lager, but helps u take the edge off and get into Thai way of eating!  Tea was a typical sweet, milky, coconutty deliciousness (Pro Tip: save some for the meal to tame the heat).\n\nWe then moved into an appetizer.  Now typically vegan food is disgusting... but I would vouch for the Hor Mok.  Its a fancy dip for rice crackers.  Mushrooms, curry complete with a dollop of sour cream... j/k coconut cream.  Earthy, slightly spicy, but creamy (and yet not too heavy) and rice crisps are a perfect delivery vehicle for this super dip (add airy crispy texture and a subtle rice flavor at the end of each bite).\n\nThen came the drunken noodles (Pad Kee Mao).  Oh man that was a treat.  First thing that I noticed was the dried (fried?) Thai basil as I scooped up the noodles, then came the pork crunchy bits, then I tasted smokey perfectly cooked noodles.  Overall medium to high heat (here comes the Thai tea to the rescue).  If it gets too greasy for you, use the provided lime to break it up.

It was crowded for a Wednesday, always a good sign. \n\nOur group ordered many dishes including the mushroom app, wings, noodles, ribs, pork belly etc. Loved the mushroom app - such a delicate but flavor-packed dish and an excellent way to initiate an exciting meal. The noodle dish was my personal favorite. I thought the ribs were dry (maybe that's Thai-style though?) and no where near the level of spiciness we were warned about - two separate staff claimed they were the spiciest item on the menu... \n\nCocktails, wine were delicious. I felt the one dessert option - sticky rice with various toppings - almost worked. Almost. \n\nGreat service, great company, no complaints here!

Indeed, dining at Kin Khao made my trip to SF joyous. Albeit that Kin Khao has a modern western decor, it provides authentic Thai food. While most hor mok is cooked with fish, the hor mok at Kin Khao is made with mushroom. I love that Chef Michael Gaines does not hesitate to add spices into the dish. However, I wish that the hor Mok were wrapped in banana leaves like the traditional ones and the rice crackers were served warm rather than chilled. Last but not least, my Thai friend recommends Kin Khao's northern Thai sausage over Lotus of Siam's because the former has a better fat-to-meat ratio and tastes more flavorful.

You can tell that an incredible amount of care, thought, and precision goes into their food and drinks.  Thai cuisine has always been a favorite of mine, and this restaurant has made it to the top of my list for favorite Thai restaurants. \n\nI started off by asking for their most popular cocktail - the Tom Yum.  This drink is made with gin, Imbue Vermouth, lime, galangal, lemongrass, Abbots Bitters, and is topped with a kaffIr leaf.  I was half expecting it to taste like an entree soup given the ingredients, but it just tasted like a great, creative cocktail.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the vegetarian Yaowaraj noodles, a great pan fried noodle dish with Hodo Soy tofu, wide rice noodles, egg, green onion, and a few other goodies.  It was served with what seemed to be a tangy fish sauce on the side.  This dish was near perfect (see my only complaint below).\n\nAnd then came desert.  Terrible move.  And by terrible move, I mean best decision ever.  My waiter talked me into trying the black rice pudding.  I was expecting something along the lines of a mango sticky rice dish, but it was very different and in a good way.  They serve a bowl of warm black rice and give you 3 smaller side bowls: salty coconut cream, puffed rice + peanut + sesame praline, and burnt coconut sugar caramel.  The whole idea is that you \"assemble\" your own pudding the way you like it.  You can mix in all of the sides, or none of the sides.  By experimenting with different sides, you could have some bites which are crunchy and salt, others which are very sweet, you get the idea. Clever desert.\n\nOnly fault I could find was that the food was very mild.  I'm used to my Thai food having some bite - a kick to it.  It's probably because most people seem to prefer mild food, so next time (and trust me, next time will be happening very soon), I'll ask for it spicy.  Otherwise, the service was great plus they have seating for small parties (including parties of 1) up by the bar where you can both order drinks and food.", "author": "Zach S."}

I'm a big fan of Thai food!\n\nThe experience started out well enough. The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual, not even a hint of stuffiness or pretentiousness. The waitresses were very enthusiastic the whole time, and the cocktails were great.\n\nUnfortunately, I was extremely disappointed by the food. The outer layer of the Laab Tod (meatballs) was dry, and there wasn't much flavor as a whole. Once you add the hot sauce and wrap it in the lettuce along with the rice, it tastes better, but still average at best. I could taste no basil at all in the Pad Kee Mao, but instead was treated to excessive grease. Yes, I realize Pad Kee Mao is supposed to be greasy, but this was a whole other level. The Kua Kling Ribs were also dry, and had an overwhelming taste of lemongrass that drowned out any flavor the pork may have had.\n\nOn the positive side, I was impressed with the Caramelized Pork Belly and the long beans. The pork belly was very tender and the sauce did a good job balancing out the fattiness. But pretty much everything else I tried lacked complexity. What usually makes many Thai dishes so amazing is the combination of multiple bold flavors that are able to complement each other. Instead, I found most plates here dominated by a single element.\n\nIn summary, I strongly recommend against coming here. There are many, many Thai restaurants in the city that have much tastier food for a much lower price (more authentic as well, if you care about that).", "author": "Richard Z."}

You can also take the escalator from the hotel's lobby or follow the strong smell of fish sauce leading to the restaurant. The interior is modern and sparse with an oddly shaped dining room.\n\nThe menu is very focused with a limited number of options. I like that there were unique dishes that you do not find in most Thai restaurants.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nPretty Hot Wings-Crispy and tangy with hints of tamarind and fish sauce. These are addictive and a must order.\n\nYum Yai Salad-An eye-catching mix of raw, cooked, and fried vegetables tossed with a chili jam dressing. A clever dish filled with different textures but the price was too high for the portion size.\n\nPad Kee Mao-Stir-fried wide noodles with ground pork, garlic, Birds Eye chili, onions, bell peppers, and basil. A very satisfying dish.\n\nAdditionally, the cocktails are well conceived and full of interesting ingredients. The Rasa Umami pairs sherry, scotch, turmeric, lime, and white pepper for a refreshingly different cocktail.\n\nKin Khao is worth trying for the adventurous menu offerings that are not available at all Thai restaurants.

Thankfully, it is located in a hotel so you're free to sit by the door or wander to the hotel lobby after you put your name down. I think the wait was around 30 minutes for my party of 3 - not bad. \n\nWe were seated at a large table alongside another party since many of the smaller tables were already occupied. I did notice that service was a bit slow in the beginning and at the end. We were trying to get noticed so we could order for our empty stomachs. \n\nThe food is incredible. The flavors, textures, and fragrances were all so enticing. If it's your first visit I definitely recommend the pork belly as well as be pad kee mao. The pork belly was incredibly tender with the perfect combination of sweet and savory. I could not get enough of the sauce or the pork. The pad kee mao? Also delicious!

Very salty food as if the chef were not trained. I would say that a random Thai to go place across from my house does a better job than this one. Things that are supposed to be light are salty, things that are supposed to be a bit sweet is also salty. Furthermore, the service was bad and the waitress was extremely arrogant as if everyone had to beg them to eat in their restaurant. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, and in fact I wonder if all the positive reviews were just posted by the friends of the restaurant owner.

When we saw the photos from Yelp of these wings, we thought two pieces of wings were quite pricey for $10 at a place like this. However, when we got the wings, they were significantly larger wings than we had expected. The sauce was quite flavorful with some Thai kick to it, though the wings could be crispier. I wouldn't say these wings are that hot. Nothing special.\n\n-NAMPRIK LONG RUA (Boat Trip Relish): The description looked very interesting so we ordered this supposedly non-Thai-food-101 dish. Though the relish was somewhat flavorful and edible, it was way too salty and over-powered by fish sauce flavor which they claim to be umami flavor bomb (yeah, right). The worst part was the vegetables served with the relish. They were far from fresh, probably cut up an hour or two ago, sort of withering as served. The tomatillos served were brown and again, far from fresh. And worst of all, how the phuck am I supposed to eat this cabbage that's not cut properly (look at the photo)?! This restaurant clearly doesn't know the basics of serving food.  And... where's the caramelized pork jowl?!?! What a waste of $23+tax+tip\n\n-CRAB MEAT & BETEL LEAF CURRY: I'd say this dish was the best of all the dishes we ordered, the flavor was quite bang-on (with the help of loads of MSG), with a fine combination of spiciness, saltiness, and sweetness. This is probably the only dish I'd re-order if I was ever forced to eat at this restaurant again. To make it worse, there were 2 unwelcome guests in the dish as shown in the photo.\n\n-PAD THAI GOONG SOD: This was pretty mediocre pad thai. Definitely had better ones, but it was edible and thank God there was no ketchup. I have no respect for restaurants who serve a whole shrimp, though, let alone at a restaurant that doesn't serve a knife...?! Again, how the fook am I supposed to eat the shrimp? Use both of my hands and leave shrimpy flavor on my fingers for the rest of the evening? Gross!\n\nThe bill for two with two $5 beer was over $110 minus tax and gratuity. A price I am not happy to pay at a restaurant this standard.\n\nAfter our meal, we both suffered from severe MSG side-effect, all-night-lasting thirst that cannot be helped with even 1 liter of water. It was very clear that they had loads of MSG in their food.\n\nI was quite disappointed dining at Kin Khao. I will not be back here unless I am forced to and definitely will not recommend to anyone. Maybe it's a fine place to grab a beer and enjoy mediocre Thai food but definitely not a place to make a reservation for a date/special night or wait in line to be seated.", "author": "Annie L."}

So, I was hopeful at first.  Then came my entree of Khao Kan Jin.  The portion felt small to me and I didn't really taste the pork.  Maybe they forgot it in my order?  I was expecting something more exotic tasting since they practically dare you to order this on their menu (literally the menu says we dare you to order this).  Good thing I also ordered their Stir Fried Bok Choy.  That was a good portion of greens but very, very light on the soy sauce and my garlic tasted burnt.  I had to ask for some Thai chili which helped kick it up a notch.\n\nThe service was just okay and the place rather small but clean.  Definitely modern in design and befitting a restaurant in a hotel (it's in Parc55). And like most restaurants in a hotel, pricier than normal Thai restaurants.

She previously took me to Commis in Oakland, which was my first Michelin star restaurant, so I wanted to take her to our next Michelin star dining experience. Hearing that this place recently got it's first Michelin star, I made reservations 3 weeks in advance.\n\n The restaurant is in the same building as a hotel. Upon entering the restaurant, I wasn't properly greeted or acknowledged (even though the damn server was standing right next to the door with his iPad). I walked up to the counter and told him we had reservations.\n\nI was seated and we were given menus. The server (Aaron) came by and introduced himself to us, but I could immediately tell that the tone of indifference to serving us was already in his voice. To be fair, I was dressed down because my girlfriend and I were coming here straight after work. After he dropped off our glasses of water, I waited about 7 minutes and had to flag Aaron down to circle back to take our order. \n\nWe ordered: the spicy wings for appetizer, the kee mao (drunken noodles), caramelized pork, and sausage with sticky rice. \n\nI then got up to wash my hands. One thing to note: the bathroom is not inside the restaurant. You have to walk all the way around and into the hotel lobby to wash your hands or use the restroom. Kind of inconvenient.\n\nThe food came out rather promptly, which was pleasantly surprising. The wings came out first. I love wings, so I was super excited to try them. But when I started taking my first bites, I was disappointed and baffled at the price they were charging for 3-4 pieces of wings.\n\nThe caramelized pork came out next. It came out extremely hot, so we let it sit while we finished our wings. The pad kee mao came out next. Thai is one of our favorite cuisines, and this is a dish we frequently order, so we were excited to try it from a Michelin Star restaurant. Took our first bite, and it does not taste like the traditional drunken noodles. It wasn't bad, but it was so far from an authentic kee mao dish that it was rather disappointing. It was mediocre at best.\n\nThe pork had cooled off to eat, so we took a shot at that. Probably the best dish we ordered, the pork melted in our mouths. My only complaint with this dish is that its serving size is TINY. I'll upload pics on this later.\n\nThe sausage with sticky rice was rather disappointing as well. It was dry and had. The sausage was on the dryer side also, and it wasn't enjoyable eating it with that combo. We ended up having to use the left over sauce from the caramelized pork belly to add some flavor to get past the dryness and blandness of the sausage.\n\nAaron and at least two other servers saw our empty plates  on our crowded table and didn't come by to pick it up until we were nearly done with the last dish. Even after our tables were cleared off and I was looking around to make eye contact with staff or Aaron, who was now at the table of 13 businessmen with a much more engaging and friendly demeanor than we experienced, but everyone seemed to be standing around or talking to each other. I finally raised my hand to flag down a lady walking around who immediately went to the cash register to get my check. Finally, Aaron abruptly thanked us and dropped off our check as he walked toward the table of businessmen.\n\nWill not be coming back here again. I would not be surprised if this place loses its Michelin star as soon as it's re-evaluated. I was shocked leaving the place that it even earned its first one.\n\nOverall, a very subpar experience.", "author": "Steven O."}

The atmosphere of the restaurant is pretty casual, and there is some music for the background but not too loud. The restaurant is also pretty quiet and quaint considering the amount of guests that were there at the time too.\n\nWe ordered Pretty Hot Wings, Wild Boar Laab Kua, Khao Kan Jin, Caramelized Pork Belly, and Buttermilk Soft Serve.\n\nThe Pretty Hot Wings were delicious. They were well cooked, and quite fairly portioned. The sauce was more savory than spicy, but when you get the chopped pieces of pepper the spicy levels kicks in a bit. I wouldn't really call it a spicy dish, but it is very flavorful.\n\nThe Khao Kan Jin was absolutely delectable. It is the first time I've had blood sausage and enjoyed it. The mix of textures and flavors was magnificent. It had a good combination of savory, sweet, and sour. Texture-wise it was a bit gelatinous, but that is to be expected and the other parts of the dish helped cut that down some with the garlic chips, cilantro, garlic chips and shallots.\n\nThe Caramelized Pork Belly was delectable. The sweetness of the sauce cut down the heaviness that pork belly normally brings. The thick cuts are also full of flavor on their own without pouring a bit more of the sauce from the dish over it.\n\nThe Wild Boar Laab Kua was pretty good. Wrapping it in the greens helped take the dish to another level texture-wise. Without the greens crunch the dish doesn't impact your palate as much due the the consistency of the meat portion. The consistency of it is great and so is the flavor, but the greens take it to that next level. The leaf doesn't have too much flavor on it's own, so you still get the savory flavor of the dish itself. I think it needed a bit more spicy, but it was full of flavor.\n\nThe Buttermilk Soft Serve was pretty good. The toasted coconut was actually of good quality rather than just the flakes being toasted you get at most places. The crunch and flavor of the coconut helps cut down on the sour the soft serve gives. The jam at the bottom is also a full of sweetness. I think it'd have been a bit better if there was a little bit of that jam in the middle of the dish rather than having it all at the end, but I do admit the jam helped with cutting down on the sour at the end of the dish.\n\nThe service was fantastic and friendly too. They were very responsive and patient with the amount of time it took us to order as a whole table.\n\nI would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food.

I highly advise against comparison, otherwise you will wind up comparing your entire meal to a completely different restaurant in a different city and state. \n\nKin Khao is a fantastic restaurant that is a true representation of northern Thai street eats that are not found in your average Thai restaurant in the U.S. For that reason, it is essential to try the dishes that are less common and out-of-box. It will truly complete your dining experience.\n\nWe started with the Pretty Hot Wings, well because, the similar wings at Pok Pok are completely orgasmic! These wings were okay, but not as great. Again, had we not had the Pok Pok wings, we would have probably thought these were great.\n\nOur main items consisted of the Yum Yai Salad, which is NOT TO BE MISSED. I have never, ever encountered such a beautifully plated salad with so many textures and colors that tasted outstanding. The plate consisted of raw, cooked, and tempura-style seasonal vegetables dressed with a chilli jam dressing. The description may not sound like much, but take my word for it. This is THE dish.\n\nWe also ordered the Khao Soi Gai with chicken, which has become one of our favorite Thai street food dishes. It's a curry broth soup with egg noodles and pickled mustard greens. You spice it up to taste with some chilli oil served on the side. It doesn't sound like much, but it does wonders for the taste buds! Order a side of rice to mix into the soup, and you've got yourself a hearty main entree.

Pok Pok uses a very aggressive take on spices, but somehow leaves you with lack of depth. I did think Kin Kaho was able to create layered flavors in a nice, but casual space, but it was WAY too expensive. When I visited, many of the patrons were tourists (maybe that's why they can get away with such high prices), but they're all tourists with a bit more taste. \n\nWe only tried three dishes:\n\nSpicy Chicken Wings: The sauce on this guy was okay and decently spicy, but I enjoy the wings from Bowl'd in Albany a lot more. I know they're not the same cuisine, but if I'm going to eat wings, I'm going to eat great wings and these were not. \n\nSeared Squid Salad: where was the sear!? I didn't see any char or taste any sear on this dish. The limey-fishy sauce was really great, but I think this dish was misrepresented on the menu. \n\nGreen Curry with Rabbit: this is a very watery curry, but it tastes great. But I remember being shocked at the price when we got the check. I knew we were going to order this regardless of price, but I'm a value oriented person and $22 for one curry seems too much! I also could have done with a lot more veggies. There are a few scant Thai eggplant and some basil leaves. \n\nWe also had issues with service. We kept getting the hard sell on wine, but neither of us really drink, so we were pretty firm that we didn't want anything. Despite that, our server kept trying to sell us. No thanks. Learn to read your audience.\n\nAlso, when the curry came out, the runner said he'd bring us bowls and spoons instead of having to try to eat a very watery curry off a plate. The bowls and spoons never came and then he brought bowls to a different table. We waved a few times to get his attention and then just sort of laughingly gave up. We didn't have regular sized spoons and only had the serving spoon so if we wanted to drink some of our very watery curry, we had to use the serving spoon. Hilarious. \n\nAnyway, I wouldn't come back here because the prices are ridiculous in my opinion and I'll stick to Amphawa Thai for my Thai fix.", "author": "Victoria J."}

We don't pretend to be Thai food experts, but we have eaten many Thai meals at many upscale restaurants in Thailand and elsewhere, so we are a bit experienced.  I had read some favorable reviews of Kin Khao and noted its Michelin star, so we thought we would check it out.  Honestly, Kin Khao is a strange restaurant and the Michelin star is a real puzzle.\n\nFirst of all, the food is not bad -- but it really isn't Thai. We only had three dishes -- a mushroom mousse, caramelized pork belly, and charred squid. Of these, the mousse was more of a French thing - not bad, but the delicate flavors were overwhelmed by the Thai seasoning on the squid dish. I happened to like the squid, but my partner felt it was too sour. The pork belly was the best dish, but we associated that more with Chinese cooking rather than Thai. It was tasty, but nothing better than we have had a hundred times before in casual Chinese eateries around the world.\n\nThe service was cheerful and prompt. No complaints there.\n\nBut what totally killed the evening for us was the noise level -- it was like being in a jet engine testing site. Diners are crammed in, ceilings are low, and all surfaces are hard. As a result, it was a din. I realize this is now supposed to be \"edgy and hip\" and, if you want that, well frankly, you're welcome to it. We had to lean forward and shout to hear each other. And who really wants to listen to the people next to us shouting at themselves? As noted, we only had three dishes -- primarily because we couldn't wait to get out of the restaurant. \n\nAnd finally, the prices are a bit ridiculous -- it was $72 before tip for one starter, two mains, and two Singha beers. Given the number of really decent Thai restaurants -- with much better ambience and at half the price, we just did not think this was good value for the money.\n\nThe one word we thought that best described the experience was \"pretentious\".", "author": "George F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-13", "description": "Ahhhhh! Another big disappointment!\n\nAfter having returned from a recent trip from Portland, I've ben actively on the hunt for some authentic thai food and expected SO much more out of the hype of Kin Khao. Although I do agree that this is probably the most authentic thai food gets around SF, but the quality and taste was just not on par with Pok Pok. \n\nWe made a reservation for 7:30pm on a Saturday night, and even after being 30 minutes late, we were seated immediately upon arrival at a little after 8pm. The restaurant is a bit hard to find since it's on the second floor of Parc 55 Hotel. \n\nStarting off with drinks, I ordered the tamarind water while my boyfriend ordered a few cocktails and said they tasted great. The reason I ordered the tamarind water was because after I had the tamarind soda water at Andy Ricker's Whiskey Soda Lounge, I'e been craving it since and thought that this might do. Except little did I know, this was only just the beginning of the let down. The drink needed more tamarind flavor and less lime juice. It tasted more like a cocktail without alcohol than a drink that should sustain by itself. Regardless, at $6, I still finished it.\n\nMoving on to the food, here is what we ordered: (Ranked from most to least favorite)\n\n1. Khao Soi Gai $15\n     -Northern-style chicken curry broth, egg noodles, pickled mustard greens, and spicy \n       chili oil (on the side.)\n\n2. Pretty Hot Wings $8\n     - Nam Pla fish sauce+garlic marinade, pretty spicy tamarind+Sriracha glaze\n\n3. Mushroom Hor Mok $10\n      - Curry mousse in-a-jar with a mix of wild and cultivated mushrooms from Connie \n         Green served with crisp rice cakes\n\n4. Khao Mun Gai $15\n    - Chicken fat rice (yes, that's what we said), ginger-poached chicken, Pim's secret  \n       sauce, served with intense chicken consomm\u00e9\n\nAlthough Khai Soi Gai was my favorite dish of the night, and the taste and flavor was there, the big miss was the fact that the coconut milk did not have that same freshness and creaminess as Pok Pok, where I know that chef Andy Ricker was shipping fresh coconuts directly from Thailand and putting only the best ingredients in his dishes. The hot wings on the other hand was not spicy at all, and I almost wish it had a little more kick to it. I feel like since diners have different spicy preferences, rather than keeping it mild, the restaurant should ask for how spicy you would like for the dish to be and prepare accordingly. \n\nThe mushroom Hor Mok was different, and tasted more catered to the heaviness of Americans rather than Thai, but really the problem I had was with the crispy rice. I think the curry mousse and the mushroom combination was great, but because the crispy rice was bland, I don't believe that this was a good pairing.\n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night was the Khai Mun Gai. The chicken was not at all tender, and rather, a little dry. This dish has nothing on Nong's Khai Mun Gai in Portland and that makes me SO SO SAD, because I was really hoping to find a substitution rather than having to go to Portland all the time.\n\nAlthough the vibe of the restaurant was great and service was also spot on, the flavor of the food just wasn't as spectacular as I had expected or desperately hoped for it to be. I really do think in terms of taste, it's definitely there and Khin Khai has it going on, however, they just need to use better ingredients to achieve that same level of heavenliness as Pok Pok and Nong's in Portland. \n\nUntil Pok Pok opens in SF (pleaseeeee do!), I guess Kin Khai will have to do for now, but I probably wont be visiting too often.", "author": "Luby H."}

It's located on the lobby level of the Parc 55 Hotel, and the setting was a lot more casual than I expected. The lunch menu is very limited, so we almost left. If you want variety, go at lunch. There were about 3 appetizers and less than 10 entree options. There was only one commonly found dish on the menu, and that was a shrimp pad thai. The other dishes were a bit more obscure.\n\nWe ordered the special green rabbit curry with thai sausage balls and eggplant, the shrimp pad thai and a side order of sticky rice. I took my mom here, and she is obsessed with spicy food (which is why Thai is her favorite). When we asked how spicy things were, we were told that nothing was really spicy. We asked for dishes to be made spicy or for some thai chilis on the side. Their answer was that they can't modify any of the dishes, and the only spicy condiment they had was the Thai version of sriracha. That's the main reason why we almost left.\n\nI'm glad we decided to stay. Yes, nothing was really spicy which is like Thai food blasphemy. However, the flavors of everything were spot on, rich and delicious. The curry had a small kick to it. There was ample rabbit meat, a couple of nice snappy Thai sausage balls (which I thought and wish were crispy rice balls), and a few thai eggplant. The dish was garnished with Thai basil, and the sauce was perfect for dipping with some sticky rice balled up between my fingers.\n\nThe pad thai was smoky, intensely sweet and sour and not greasy or mushy at all. The noodles were very al dente, and they were topped with 2 large head-on & shell-on prawns. The flavor was so good that I kind of forgave the fact that it was basically all noodles and only 2 shrimp. \n\nI forget the name of the cocktail I ordered, but it was sweet, sour, and really refreshing. \n\nI had high hopes before I got there, low expectations once I was told that nothing was not could be made spicy & left there feeling satisfied and happy that they met my initial expectations. Would definitely return but likely during dinner so that I have more options.", "author": "Catherine N."}

Located in a section of the Parc 55 hotel, this restaurant might be slightly hidden if you did not know to look for it. Thankfully they took reservations, which was what made us inclined to try this place out to begin with. There are a variety of different food menu items that are not typical when you think of thai food. Most of the food options are also served a la carte, and you can share them family style with your guests. Since the portions are rather on the small side, I would probably suggest getting one dish per person plus one more dish too. You should definitely order some rice as well.\n\nI remember that we ordered green beans, a sizzling pork dish, a rabbit curry dish, a spicy noodle dish and a couple sides of sticky rice. I have to say that even though portions were quite small, the food itself was actually very tasty. Although I am not typically a pork fan, the sizzling pork dish (I forget the actual name) was very good and one of the more memorable dishes of the night. The noodles were also another favorite item (also forget the name but I think it was similar to a pad kee mao?). Due to the price/food size ration, I probably wouldn't come running back here since there are plenty of other Thai food options in the city, but I don't regret trying it out in the first place.", "author": "Daniel H."}

We ordered 4 dishes to share and it was more than enough to keep us satisfied. We had the mock terrine (amazing appetizer), pretty hot wings (not very spicy and very flavorful), carmelized pork belly (super tender) and the whole roasted rock fish (crispy with great sauces; pretty big fish so we couldn't finish it).

Living away from home for too long, my taste buds are changing. I've adapted to the taste of Thai food as it is usually experienced in the US--it's either too spicy or too sweet. \n\nThai food isn't all about the degree of spiciness. Thai dishes are bold and intense in all flavors (spicy, sweet, sour and salty). How do you get these flavors? Ingredient, ingredient, ingredient!!!  \n\nHere at Kin Khao, their concept is simple. They search for the best ingredients available--the fresh produce and sustainable meat and seafood. They want to bring out the real Thai flavors to the table and introduce something new to you. So, don't get upset if you can't find Pad Thai or sticky rice mango on the menu. Explore new dishes!\n\nI must say Kin Khao is one of a kind Thai restaurant. They make their own curry pastes and sauces.  You will never see this in other Thai restaurants in the US. I was so excited when I knew about this. I also appreciated all the work they put into it. This concept may not please everyone as it comes at a price. You will properly spend a bit more here.\n\nAs authentic as it gets, my favorite dishes are Khao Soi Gai and Chilli Jam Clams.

If you're thinking that all Thai places are the same Thai buddha-styled semi-dated places, this place totally breaks the mold.  It's almost trendy, but not quite... Perhaps \"well executed\" would be the best phrasing.\n\nBut then there's the food.  Everything here is a little different, a little higher-end, than your typical Thai fare.  It definitely makes you question what Thai is and its general flavor profile.  We had smoked eggplant with lime and shallots (they called it burned eggplant, but there was nothing burned about it) and it was wonderfully smokey and all the lime/onion/cilantro/mint complemented the eggplant perfectly.\n\nNext was the Pad Khee Mao, which maybe wasn't the best I ever had, but it was definitely a twist on a favorite of mine.  We did order the vegetarian version, so that probably has a lot to do with how much I appreciated it.  The meat replacement was interesting - It was tofu-like, but reminded me more of Mexican cotija cheese.  Which was interesting.\n\nLast we finished with the egg curry.  Which was like nothing I've ever had before.  There was a super flavorful almost vinegar-like tamarind broth underneath, with the most delicious turnips slowly braised in it.  Then on top was basically a scallion omelette, which was quickly pan seared before finishing in the broth.  It was completely unique and enjoyable.\n\nI had a wonderful time here and I'd definitely recommend it to people looking for new, upscale international experiences.", "author": "Jon E."}

I noticed because this restaurant is close to the TL or ghetto part near Eddy St, HOMELESS people just go right inside the hotel because there is no security at the back of the hotel. \n\nSATURDAY NOVEMBER 21,2015 9:45PMish\nI was waiting and sitting down outside the restaurant, when a HOMELESS woman walked inside the hotel, but i did not think that she would go inside the restaurant but she did. Luckily the staff called security and were quick to escort out the homeless woman. Two guards dragged her out, and because her clothes are not fitted and she did not want the guards to touch her, her clothes were off and YES the HOMELESS (she) was naked in front of me and the tourists who were waiting for a table. I think that the restaurant should have security at the back of hotel because this is  a turn off for customers. I was seriously traumatized. I mean she could have been physical with the customers eating inside. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE The customer service is not the best. The only way for you to reserve is to go on their website. If you call, it will take you to vmail. The first time i ate here i made reservations at 9:15pm, and we were not seated till 30 minutes later. The host will say that your table is ready, but it's a lie. There are still customers eating and waiting for them to pay. The same thing happened last time, host said 10 minutes, but still ended up waiting. \n\nPRICE The dishes are a little expensive considering for the portions they give you, but i get it it's inside a hotel.", "author": "Rose P."}

So don't expect your favorite Thai staples (Green Curry Chicken, Pad Thai, etc.) to appear on the menu in exactly the same form.\n\nOkay, so if you're not going to order Pad Thai, what should you order? Here's what I recommend:\n1. Ask what the special is. I once came by when the special was a fried codfish, and my friends decided to be adventurous and go for it -- it was amazing and totally worth it.\n2. For a starter, get the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine. It's basically a curried mushroom paste, which I realize doesn't sound appetizing, but trust me, it's awesome. Goes really well with the rice crackers, then save the rest and eat it with rice.\n3. Get the Caramelized Pork Belly. Crispy on the outside, with soft, juicy, fatty centers, it's everything you wanted out of pork belly. Sauce also goes really well with rice.\n4. Speaking of rice, go for the sticky rice. It's the same price as the regular rice (which I don't understand...) and it goes well with everything. The sticky and slightly sweet rice adds a nice texture and flavor balance to anything else you order.\n5. If you want something alcoholic, the cocktails are great, and there's a really wide variety to choose from.\n\nGreat food, great atmosphere, and friendly service. This is Thai food done a little bit differently, and it works really, really well.", "author": "Brittany C."}

Our party of 5 arrived in waves but we were fine waiting at the bar briefly.\n\nThe food was the highlight:\n2 orders of the Pretty Hot Wings. Definitely hot. 3 huge wings per order. We got messy =]\nCrab sen chan (basically crab pad thai) - large portions, delicious\nChicken curry noodle - i LOVED this and finished every bite\nShort ribs - this was flavorful but the ribs weren't very juicy...almost charred/brittle\n\nDrinks + Service were disappointing:\n75% of our meal, $-wise, was in drinks. \nWines were ok but expensive ($13 for the only sparkling by-glass option). \nWe moved onto cocktails since the place touted bartenders from Trickdog.  Maybe it's because it's opening day, but they couldn't make one of the drinks we wanted to order and our waiter couldn't explain why and used the \"i don't really know the menu well...it's my/our first day\" excuse.  It's called training... He also got one of the drink orders wrong - \"without cream\" ask isn't really even a matter of training. Waiter was just bad.\n\nThe go-to drink seems to be the Ladyboy Collins.  It's a funny name but the drink starts out blue and they pour some lemon juice in it and it turns a pinkish purple. Nice way of simulating the \"transformation\". Definitely get that.\n\n\"Tom Yum\" drink was \"so-so\" and so was the Julep.  Friends who've been to Trickdog were disappointed in overall drink quality.\n\nLastly, their entire POS system crashed halfway through our meal. The waiter said that's why he kept on getting our orders wrong (there were no backup post-its and pens to write down our order?). That's really unfortunate but not uncommon. The experience shouldn't be sacrificed because of it.\n\nLastly - food price and decor were on point. Food was ~$15 (almost the same as our cocktails).  Decor was like a clean, casual thai eatery with a lot of seating (apparently fits 75). The only thing that makes the place look sterile is that it's tucked away in a random spot in the Parc 55 hotel (have to walk past the elevators into back hall way).

I was a bit frustrated at first as I'd been looking forward to Thai only to discover the lunch menu had a total of six entrees, and only two could be made vegetarian-friendly. I'd been looking forward to having either Pad See Ew!\n\nWe were told the dishes were \"family sized\" but in truth they weren't. The Pad Kee Mao I ordered could easily have been for one person, but we wound up spreading everything around anyway, including some appetizers. \n\nAnother issue I had: I asked about the heat level of the Pad Kee Mao and was told it was mild. One of my coworkers and I found it *way* hotter than we'd like. There was no way that this was mild by any means.\n\nNow, despite the grousing, I do have to rate this place four stars. Why? The food was pretty phenomenal. I tried the tofu Pad Kee Mao and the green beans in XO sauce and both were delicious. Our group had also ordered the chicken wings, which come three to a plate and are *huge*. One coworker thought they were some of the best wings he'd ever eaten and was afraid he'd fill up on that before the entrees showed up.\n\nThe drink menu looks pretty fascinating and I'd love to try a few of them out; alas, being a work lunch, I avoided at the time, but it just means I'll be back at some point for drinks and snacks. \n\nIt's a bit pricey but the quality is up there, making this a decent place to check out if you're not too worried about the limited menu. If you have a sensitive palate for spicy heat, request that they make the dish extra mild instead of just taking the server's word on it.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-02", "description": "Last week a good friend treated me to the tasting menu at Kin Khao as a (very) belated Birthday present. It was a real treat to try so many items on one sitting. We started with the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine which I had tried before when I visited a few years back and it's still very good but also very spicy, probably the most spicy thing of the evening. So we ordered some hot tea to help cool ourselves down (we're British like that), it worked a treat and we could continue with the rest of the curious spread. Our favourite of the starters was the Yum Polamai - a wonderful salad with stone fruit and coconut and lime and shallots. The next thing to be set on the table to draw exclamations of delight from us was the caramelized pork belly, need I say more? The worst part was having to watch my friend eat the other piece, I could definitely have managed this one all by myself. It was sweet and gooey, fatty and a great foil to the previous brighter, spicier flavors. Earlier I had nearly declined the offer of the tasting menu because I am not a huge fan of beans, but I am so glad I didn't listen to my bean-hating self. The blistered long beans in XO sauce were so moreish that even when I'd finished everything I thought I could eat, I kept picking at the remaining few with my fingers until they were all gone. I'll take those beans any time over the boiled mushy memories of my childhood. Finally, the crowning dish of the evening - Khun Yai's rabbit green curry thoughtfully served with a choice of brown and white rice was a mix of creamy spicy perfection. There was only a little of it left over by the time we came to the end of the savory courses but even so I made sure every last drop of it made it home in a doggy-bag with me for lunch the next day.  Like I mentioned, we are both British which led to some amusement over the dessert of Thai Tea soft serve. Like I said to my friend - when we were kids (a very long time ago now) there would be these old ladies (ancient great-great aunts and the like) who when we visited would have these  big brown tea pots dressed with tea cosies that had been used to brew tea for decades (maybe even centuries) and they had this very distinct black tea leave smell - and that is what the Thai Tea softserve dessert reminded me of. It  evoked memories of that tea, which when were kids we would drink with spoonfuls and spoonfuls of sugar and lots of milk. I never expected a Thai dish to drum up a very British childhood memory, but that it did. Thanks for the journey through Thailand and unexpectedly back to my roots, Kin Khao!", "author": "Sam B."}

Amazing, if I could only get one dish, I would get that again (although, if the Mushroom Hor Mok came without garlic I'd definitely get that instead)\n\nKhao Mun Gai: you're supposed to eat the rice and the chicken, then drink the broth, but we put the rice and the chicken in the broth and we liked it better that way :) A good chicken soup, not very special though.\n\nWe didn't have a chance to try the desserts, because we were on our way to say \"Happy International Women's Day\" to my sister's mother-in-law, and I had already made the dessert :)\n\nIs it the next \"it\" restaurant of San Francisco?

In fact, this would probably rank as the second best Thai restaurant I've ever tried in the States (surpassed only by the 2007-2009 version of Thai X-ing in DC) which probably shouldn't be too much of a surprise given the lofty laurels attributed to the restaurant.  On this visit, I tried a number of items but the absolute standout was the green curry with rabbit meatballs.  Combined with traditional eggplant and basil, the rabbit meatballs were intensely flavorful.  The accompanying green curry provided a lovely base simmering with controlled heat from a wonderful mix of spices.  On the side, there were a number of pork ribs and a side salad in case you needed anything to accompany your order.  Words don't justify this dish; it was easily among the best I've ever had (again, second only to green curry short ribs at Thai X-ing circa 2008).  \n\nI also ordered some rice noodles over pork cheek (excellent) and an accompanying diner ordered chicken fat rice with chicken.  It was interesting enough, but probably only the second best animal fat order I had of the week (pork fat roasted potatoes, anyone?).  Still, I'll continue to dream about that green curry with rabbit meatballs.  I'd suggest you stop dreaming and start ordering because this menu likely won't stay stagnant.

You can definitely taste that they make their curry paste from scratch and the rabbit itself is melting in your mouth (it changes from the bad chicken lots of places use with curry). \n* Plah Pla Muek ($14): Fresh and very spicy! My husband loved that dish.\n* Khao Soi Gai ($15): My favorite dish after the Rabbit green curry.\n\nI haven't try the desserts (yet), but I heard the Black Rice Pudding is super good!\n\nI agree with some Yelp review about the service: Sometimes it's a little bit over the place (they forget to bring a spoon you asked, they don't bring you water right away...) but nothing crazy.\n\nI had the pleasure to meet Pim Techamuanvivit (co-owner of the restaurant). She was really nice, took the time to explain with she decided to serve rabbit instead of chicken, and offered to try the Sai Ua+Namprik Noom (grilled house-made Northern Thai pork sausage, cracklings, with darn spicy young pepper relish).\n\nSo, I completely disagree with Dennis Z. when he says \"they buy it elsewhere and prepare it\" because they are actually making it from scratch. Oh and also when he says \"When we arrived at the restaurant we didn't see one Asian person\"... Pim was born in Bangkok (hope it's \"Asian\" enough for Denis).\n\nAs a conclusion, I will definitely recommend the place for nice cocktails and good food!", "author": "Chlo\u00eb O."}

My friends and I were left with, literally and figuratively, a bad taste in our mouths.\n\nWe were seated in a very dimly lit room, to the point where it was difficult to read the menu. We joked about needing to use the light on our phone to see better. But then, a family at the end of the communal table actually did that when they were seated so we knew we weren't the only ones who found the lighting to be an issue.\n\nService wasn't the greatest. Our waitress checked in on us shortly after we were seated and we weren't able to look at the drinks. After that, her check ins were far from timely nor did she give off the much of a friendly vibe either. Your restaurant is always going to be busy, so that can't be your excuse.\n\nNow, what should be the highlight was the night, it was all a bust. WAYYYYY to much salt on everything, no amount of lime, rice, hot sauce could salvage it. I'm drinking my weight in water for the next 24 hours to flush out all that salt.\n*Khao Kan Jin - sounds more exciting on paper than it actually is. The mix ins were cut too big so they were difficult to evenly mix in with the sticky rice like the server instructed us to do.\n*Pad Kee Mao - overly salted/soy sauced and the pieces of meat were small, salty and burnt. Probably the saltiest dish of the night, there was more than half the dish still leftover.\n*Yum Yai Salad- This one was okay, but because it came out as the 3rd dish, instead of the 1st or 2nd, we were kind of over the meal by then. The different textures of the salad was interesting, salad paste/dressing was still salty.\n*Rabbit Green Curry - this one was my favorite of the night but ruined by rice. Meat was tender, curry had the right amount of spice. Maybe just not enough vegetables.\n*Sticky Rice - This was like day old rice that was warmed up in the microwave and then left out. We literally had to pull the rice out of the basket with our hands. And then even letting it soak in curry sauce couldn't soften it. We had to cut the lump of rice with our utensils as if it were a piece of meat.\n*Plah Pla Muek - Squid was cooked perfectly, al dente. But you guessed it! Ruined by too much fish sauce.\n\nMichelin star or not, I wouldn't recommend this place. Such a waste of money.", "author": "Christina B."}

You won't find lots of items like pad thai, pad see ew, yellow curry etc.  The items are just so exotic here!\n\nI got the Khao Soi Gai noodle dish.  It reminded me of Chiang Mai noodle soup that I don't see at too many Thai places.  This noodle dish was AMAZING.  The curry soup was creamy and delicious.  The noodles were cooked just fine.  One caveat is that the soup is EXTREMELY spicy (a lot spicier than you would imagine) - I guess I should have been tipped off by the bright orange color of the soup.  They give you sweet chili oil on the side but quite frankly I couldn't use too much of it. \n\nMy friend got the Pad Kee Mao dish and while he said it was tasty, it was also extremely spicy.  They do not skimp out on the spice here.\n\nThe waitress we had felt a bit awkward though, and the seating inside is quite small.

The drinks were all amazing so just pick one, enjoy and repeat. The 'not so good' was the actual service. The waiter was a trip. He was not very friendly borderline rude. He was not engaging or welcoming. I saw that there was a piece of rice/gunk left on my plate and so I asked if I could please get a new plate when he got a second. Any other establishment, the waiter would have said something like 'Oh I'm sorry about that, of course or I'll get you one right away'. This guy was just annoyed that I didn't just pick it off my plate because he didn't say a damn thing and grabbed the plate briskly and walked to another table and got me that plate.

When I arrived I told both the hostess and the waiter I was in a tight time limit as I had to be upstairs in an hour. \nThe waiter brought a decanter of water and I said I'm ready to order now. Ordered papaya salad and the chicken and rice. Salad arrived promptly. It was not, however, mixed, which I discovered after moving it from serving plate to my plate in stages. All the hot peppers were on the bottom. I was burning and hoped my entree would arrive soon so I could eat a little rice to counteract.\nAnd waited and waited and waited. I could see others from the One Day University who arrived after me and many of whom did not have reservations get their food while I waited. I was getting antsy due to time limit.\nMeanwhile, new parties arrived at tables either side of me and waiter asked both if they wanted still or sparkling water. I had not been offered a choice, just brought still (given a choice I'd pick sparkling). \nIt was 1:05 when I finally got a waiter to respond to my attempts to flag someone down. He said they will take my order right away. Take my order? I had ordered half an hour ago and had to be upstairs at 1:30, where was my food?\nLiterally 2 seconds later he brought it. Food was cold. My deduction: it was prepared and plated but no one brought it to me.\nRice and chicken broth both had good flavor. Poached chicken totally bland and white flabby skin very unappealing, especially when cold. \nI had 10 minutes to eat my lunch.\nThe hostess came by as I was frantically signalling and asked if I wanted the check. I said I'd order dessert if I could get it to go as I had to be upstairs in less than 10 minutes. She said they could not prepare it in 10 minutes so no dessert.\nI barely had time to run upstairs and brush my teeth (necessary after the fat and chilies) before the next session began.\nThis has happened too often to be my imagination or coincidence, that I get lousy service while couples, groups, and men get their food before me even when I was ahead of them, or not offered drinks, or have server bring check and try to hustle me out without a chance to get dessert, or food left sitting to get cold.

Laab kua: ground pork with cilantro, mint, shallots, garlic. The flavor is intense and really good, and it's definitely good on sticky rice. Beware of Thai chilis \n5. Khao kan jin: steamed pork, rice, and blood sausage wrapped in banana leaf. The flavor is good on this, but a few bites were enough for me \n6. Kua kling ribs: dry fried ribs that were spicy and cooked with a curry paste. The lime leaves were a nice touch, and this is good with sticky rice\n7. Yaowaraj noodles: not quite the noodles I was looking for, but they worked for my carb craving. They're broad noodles with XO suace, egg, green onions, chicken. \n8.

My husband and I tried the cucumber som tum, stir-fried baby choy sum, Sai Ua + Nam Prik Noom and the Massaman Nuea. Of those, the only dish I would recommend is the Sai Ua + Namprik Noom, I like the combination of the flavors, the sausage has a kick to it but not too spicy. The cucumber and the stir-fried baby choy sum are ok, but really nothing to write home about. My husband do like the cucumbers. I would not recommend the Massaman Nuea, it's really heavy and just tastes ok. For close to $40, save your money and try something else.   \n\nIt's $100 for us for 2 people with no drinks, which is really expensive Thai food, but an affordable Michelin experience. If you are looking for a Michelin restaurant to try, it's ok; if you are looking for good Thai food or value for your money, I would recommend go somewhere else.", "author": "T L."}

We called ahead and were told they could fit 2 people in at the bar or the communal table if we arrived within the next 10 min (shortly after 5:00). Luckily, we were staying at the Hilton, which was only a couple blocks away.\nArrived at the restaurant and received a friendly greeting from the hostess. There was already a handful of people ahead of us, but I believe most of them had reservations.  This is a small restaurant so reservations definitely recommended.\nWe had the thai iced tea, the Namprik Relish and the Butternut Squash Squash Penange.  The thai iced tea had a good strong tea flavor and wasn't overly sweet as most Thai restaurants serve.  I would recommend it.  The Namprik Relish was a fun dish to eat.  Large variety of raw and blanched veggies to eat with the relish. The relish itself was very pungent, flavorful mix of salty, sweet and sour.  This was a winner for us but may not appeal to the unadventurous palate.  The Butternut Squash however was waaaaay spicy. Our server did warn us about the spice level after we ordered it but we went ahead anyways.  My sister could barely eat the squash, even without the curry sauce.  I have a high heat tolerance and even found it very spicy.  The only strange thing was it was listed as butternut squash on the menu but we're 99% sure we got a kabocha squash curry... not that its a bad thing, but it was misleading from the menu.  The serving size for this was generous but then again, I believe it was over $30+.  I wouldn't order this again due to the spiciness but would definitely come back to try other dishes that looked really tasty on all the tables around us.", "author": "louli e."}

I ordered their mezcal spicy drink, can't remember the name. it was really good.  We shared the grilled squid dish, which I liked a lot. Also had the vegetarian curry and beef curry. I liked the sauce for the vegetarian curry a lot. The beef curry was just ok, I didn't like the curry as much. However, the beef in it is really good. Also ordered the pad kee mao, which was good too. I was a little hesitant because it said ground pork, but it's in house ground pork, so it wasn't really super grounded up.

It's located in a fairly non-descript building with a FedEx shipping center and a Hilton hotel inside (walk around the corner to find the restaurant sign, initially I went in to the wrong side). I think Oracle owns the building itself. The bathrooms are located outside the restaurant on the Hilton side. Looks like you need a reservation on weekends, but we lucked out by going at an early hour I think, as we were seated almost immediately without one. Place is pretty small inside, so I see why there's a wait (at least there's a bench outside to wait on). They even serve you sparkling (free) and regular water by the pitcher when you sit down, which I've never seen before. I didn't order any drinks, but my girlfriend and our other friend mentioned they were some of the best of the night that they partaken in (they went with the mezcal one--Artist's Reward). The pad kee mao is a standout, and the ground pork was really good (I usually get this dish w/beef, so I was surprised how tasty it was). Didn't even need any hot sauce for this one, it was tremendously flavored. We also had the Plah Pla Muek, which was great...really tasty squid and the peanuts paired well w/them. Massaman nuea...damn, the beef cheeks did just fall off the bone. We got the white jasmine rice ($4) with it, and it was great. The rice comes in a cool pot too with a handle. We had another vegetarian dish with a name that escapes me, but the sauce was awesome. The server was really knowledgable about everything, and made sure we were taken care of all night.

Comes out sizzling in a clay pot and you have to eat it while it's still hot! I felt like I was eating fat the whole time...but I guess having 1 piece is okay :p\n\nKua Kling Ribs - We asked the server to make these ribs extra HOT and it was soo spicy. Great if you prefer hot hot spicy tangy bursts of fire in your mouth, not so if you are me. \n\nPad Kee Mao - Noodles!! Okay, these are different from any pad kee mao I've had. It tasted a bit on the plain side tbh, but there was enough basil (which I love) so it smelled really heavenly.

I'll keep this brief and to the point.\n\n1) Not authentic Thai food\n2) Server said maybe 10 words to me\n3) masaman curry lacked depth of flavor and no peanut flavor.  Not what I am used to.  Maybe from a different part of Thailand?  \n4) Did not offer level of spice like legit Thai restaurant\n5) No choice of meat for curries like legit place\n6) Overpriced\n\nOverall, do not come expecting legit Thai food.

I wish I did since they now only serve it at lunch. It sounds amazing.\n\nSome of my favorite dishes:\nWok-Charred Brussels Sprouts in XO Sauce - UGH! I want XO sauce on everything! These sprouts are perfectly cooked (some crunchy bits) and tossed in a wonderfully briny XO sauce. I could eat bowls of this all day long! Order these with some sticky rice. You won't regret it.\n\nPretty Hot Wings - The tamarind Sriracha glaze is AMAZING. Just the right amount of tangy and sweet!  \n\nMassaman Nuea - Perfect curry. The beef cheeks in this melt in your mouth. Good with any rice! \n\nBlack Rice Pudding - Treat yourself to dessert. The burnt coconut sugar caramel is just sweet enough to mix in with the rest of the ingredients. It's surprisingly light and great for sharing.", "author": "Karena Q."}

I wanted authentic Thai food.  This did not disappoint.\n\nWe didn't get a lot. It was late, and weren't in the mood to be stuffed. That said, we could have completely ordered more dishes than we did based upon what was offered. It all sounded good.\n\nWok-Charred Brussels Sprouts in XO sauce\nMassaman Nuea\nSai Ua + Namprik Noom\n\nI got The Smooth Thai as a cocktail, and my husband got a Chang beer.\n\nNote, he almost fell over when he saw the price of the Chang, because in Thailand, you can get the big bottle for about $2. Let's say it's comparably priced to what an SF beer drinker would expect.\n\nThe cocktail was yummy, and kind of difficult to describe. Not too sweet, and definitely went well with the food.\n\nThe Sai Ua + Namprik Noom was great.  A nice snap to the sausage, and the relish was spicy, but really full of flavor. It was hard to shove everything into a single lettuce leaf, but every component they provided really added something, so work it, and just do it. It will be worth your while.\n\nThe Massaman was epic. we had it in Thailand, and we have it all the time here in the states, but this version will make you question what you've been eating all of your life.  The key is the meat. The sauce is perfectly executed, and should be noted, not hot spicy at all, but the beef cheek changes your perception of what a curry could be.  It was so good, I'd go back for that dish alone, even though the sausage was nigh that good as well.\n\nThe sprouts were very charred, but in the best way possible.  They make their own XO, and you can tell the care they take.  This is a place that you should anticipate a big bill, especially in comparison to normal Thai places, but the quality you get is worth the money you pay.

But, a) I was on a business trip and b) it was legitimately some of the tastiest food in any genre I've ever eaten. \n\nI ate this meal alone and I think I'd have liked it better with a few friends. That beef cheek Massaman curry was the textbook definition of \"foodgasm\" but after a certain point it actually became daunting to eat so much richness by myself. I think an ideal way to experience this place would be with 2-4 people, a couple starters/small plates and a couple main courses and lots of sharing. I saw so many dishes come out that I'd have liked to try but I am only one person. The main portions are also pretty generous - more than enough for 2 people to share, especially with the variety of a starter. Sharing would also bring down the per person cost a bit in addition to upping the variety.\n\nAlso, I'm not usually one to pay more than $10 for a cocktail but as I was sitting at the bar enjoying my meal and watching the expert mixology happening in front of me, I couldn't resist trying one.

We made reservations a few hours earlier and managed to snag a 8:45pm table. When we arrived, we were told the party prior to us was still eating. I don't think we sat until 20 minutes after the reservation. Ambiance was nice enough. It's a small Thai joint located in a swanky hotel. I heard this place recently received a Michelin and wanted to see what the fuss was about. Overall, I wasn't impressed and here's why. \n\nWe ordered the yaowaraj noodle, hot wings, caramelized pork belly, massaman nuea (beef cheek curry), and sai ua + namprik noom (pork and sticky rice in lettuce). The noodle dish arrived first and was extremely delicious. It tasted like a glorified version of a pad see ew. The hot wings were a huge disappointment - it was too salty and a mess to eat. Also, for the price of 3 for $12, it's not worth it. The beef cheek curry was pretty good. The beef was tender and broke apart easily. The curry was rich and overly salty. I wish they had more potatoes in the curry to balance out the flavors. The pork and sticky rice in lettuce dish was a bit bizarre. The waitress said it was her favorite, but when it arrived, it just looked like a dish that was trying too hard. It was basically chopped up sausage pieces with a side of lettuce and sticky rice. Needless to say, I was not a big fan. Lastly, the pork belly arrived to the table late because the waitress forgot to put the order in. It was what you'd expect pork belly to look and taste - fatty, chewy, tender, and extremely salty. Meh. \n\nWhen the bill came, we ended up paying around $30 each. This is pretty steep for a Thai place, but \"cheap\" for a Michelin restaurant. A few of my friends thought the meal was amazing. However, I don't think I would come back again. If I had to, I'd probably order one of salads because they can't possibly pour salt in that.", "author": "Joyce S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-21", "description": "This place is Michelin star overrated! Visiting from NY and a hotel guest, decided to try this out of convenience. Prices are absurd for the portions they serve. Supposed to be family style but more for groups of 2-3 to share. Ordered the Noodles- very bland; bok choy - bland also, no garlic taste as described; and pork belly- delicious, top choice but 4 pieces only. Black rice pudding is the only dessert but you must try it; very different. Cocktails are a delightful concoction but overpriced also. $100 tab for 1 cocktail, 2 sodas, 3 dishes, 1 dessert all shared w my 10 year old daughter. Really ?!!\nThey need a little better insight or experience, for lack of better word, on seating. There's a large communal table in the center of the room but strangely don't seat large parties here but instead singles and deuces. Large parties are sat at the 2 and 4 top tables. The bar is offered to couples and CHILDREN! Not sure of the laws in SF, but I find it very disrespectful if you try to seat me at a bar w my daughter after waiting 30 mins yet offer a nice table to a couple before us. Have some sense.\nAll in all, this place is overrated and overpriced taking advantage of its Michelin star and the fact it's inside a hotel.  I've had better Thai food.", "author": "Jessie G."}

We were very last minute with making reservations but managed to score a table for 3 at 5:30p. I was so happy. It felt like winning the lottery! \n\nThe food here is delicious. Besides from Pok Pok in PDX, I'm not sure any other thai restaurant quite compares. Such amazing and authentic Thai flavors. My family is Vietnamese so a lot of the Southeast asian flavors in the dishes we had really brought me back to my childhood. Reminded me of grandma's cooking!\n\nBetween the 3 of us, we ordered\n-Pretty Hot Wings: Had a good crisp even though it was glazed with an amazing spicy, sweet, and sour sauce. Really well done.\n\n-Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine: Yummy light and fluffy appetizer. Had a sour kick to it which I couldn't get enough of.\n\n-Yum Polamai: Most amazing salad ever. It was loaded with persimmons, pears, apples, and pomegranates combined with herbs (cilantro, mint, shiso), fried shallots, and chili in a lime-fish sauce vinaigrette.\n\n-Namprik Long Rau: This one came with a warning on the menu. Not for Thai 101 beginners. Order this for sure but eat it sparingly with a side of rice or vegetables. Super tasty but also super intense and heavy with the fish sauce and shrimp paste. Soooo yummy if eaten with the right proportion of rice/veggies. \n\n-Khao Mun Gai: A nice and neutral dish to balance out all of the intense spicy flavors of everything else we ordered. The ultimate comfort food.\n \n-2 sides of chicken broth: Best chicken broth ever. Really great for cleansing your palette after every bite.\n\nThey had a nice cider on the menu which was really refreshing paired with all the spicy food. The cocktails all looked amazing too! I ordered one with cava and citrus which went really well with the meal.\n\nAmbiance was a lot more casual than I had expected. In my mind, I was imagining a grandiose and fancy restaurant. Instead the vibe was more modern and casual. The decor is really sleek and minimal with pops of playful accents here and there. They also had a good Talking Heads playlist on while we were dining too. :)\n\nCan't wait to come back!", "author": "Veronica T."}

The thai noodle dish was just so-so (really pricy for a simple noodle dish).  The vegetable curry was REALLY spicy; hard to enjoy anything else when you are sweaty and tongue is on fire.  Almost everything is spicy (except for the pork belly) that we ordered so be prepared.  Would be nice if there are more warning or if they can change spiciness...\n\nWaiter:  The waiter seemed unprofessional.  The guy dressed like a slob; we couldn't tell that he was one of the wait staff, and his demeanor when taking order was almost rude, disrespectful, unprofessional.  The owner was much nicer, she came a few times to see if we needed anything else.\n\nPrice: The price is definitely on the higher side.  Be prepared to pay at least $50/person.\n\nOverall:  Pricy for the food you get.  Be prepared for spicy food and maybe ask if it is spicy before ordering.

If you are looking for authentic Thai food (like me--visited or grew up in Thailand), you should dine here with an open mind! \n\nI give two stars for following reasons: \n\n1st star: Community table/ bar seats that allowed dining without a reservation. My partner and I casually dropped by Kin Khao at 6PM on a Sunday. All tables were taken; however, an attentive hostess quickly seated us at a community table. Luckily, we had privacy from other diners since the table was large and chairs were spread far apart. \n\n2nd star: Must try LAAB TOD! This dish was different from the standard Laab (gai/moo) salads. We enjoyed pork meatballs, cucumber slices, cilantro and mint leaves wrapped with a green leaf, and dipped in jaew sauce. The jaew sauce was DELICIOUS. The moment I took a bite into the wrap with this amazing sauce, I felt like I was in Bangkok. Aloy! \n\nI couldn't give remaining three stars for following reasons:\n\nLost 3rd star: Some dishes were too salty or bland. Yum Kai Dao and Yum Polamai were both salty and overwhelmed with fish sauce. Yaowaraj Noodle was bland and simply lacked flavors. \n\nLost 4th star: Thai iced tea was bitter. I expected Thai iced tea to be sweet to balance with spicy dishes. \n\nLost 5th star: Menu changes were unexpected. I wanted to eat Khao Mun Gai (my favorite chicken rice dish) and I was disappointed to learn that it is only served for lunch. Big sigh. Other customers at the community table had a similar issue--they wanted a squid dish that they saw on yelp, and seemed disappointed to learn that they did not serve the dish they wanted to try.", "author": "Ari Y."}

I managed to get a Saturday night booking (although maybe it was due to an OpenTable bug, I dunno). We arrived, and it did take them a little while to manage to find us a place to sit (although I don't know why as the place had several empty tables). We were finally given a table. \n\nThe menu had a lot of interesting cocktails, so we each tried one while we were looking to order. While they were really good, I wasn't blown away by either of them, so we opted to have a bottle of wine with the rest of dinner. We decided to share the chili and lime pock scratchings, the hot wings, the massaman curry with beef cheek and the not-for-thai-beginners Namprik Long Rua (which turned out to be some sort of relish... we're still not sure if we ate it correctly). \n\nThe crackling was good, as you would expect it to be. The hot wings were amazing: Salty, sweet, bitter and sour, just as you would expect Thai food to be. I wanted to lick the plate. Then the relish arrived! It looked amazing with a selection of vegetables to cleanse the palate. And it tasted brilliant. I still remember it now. And the curry was fantastic. I love beef cheek, and one thing Kin Khao has taught me is that a person can braise beef cheek in anything. And it will be delicious.\n\nBecause almost everything we shoved in our faces was glorious, we split the black rice pudding dessert. What a fun dessert! I may not order it again, and I do like my desserts to be kind of sickly, but it was nice being able to tailor it the way you like. We asked about dessert wine, and the server asked but there was none. However, she did tell us the bartender was making us a cocktail to go with dessert, and s/he did a great job with the pairing.\n\nI can't recommend this place enough.

This place really prides itself on being authentic so don't come here expecting the cheap Americanized thai dishes that are ubiquitous.

Last we had the Rabbit Green Curry which was so good but really spicy! The only downside was that the server said 3 dishes would be enough for two people but it was too much food for us and since we were going to a show right after we couldn't take it with us.

The menu is limited with just a few entree choices, but everything sounds and looks good (just look around you.)  It's hard to not indulge and get a few to share/try.\n\nWhat we ended up getting: mushroom terrine was so clever in presentation that at the time I felt like I was eating something completely reinvented. But now that I think about it, it's like dipping into a fairly common curry dish with rice crackers. \n\nAsparagus with fermented beans was ridiculously good.  The flavor, the umami, the tenderness and the crunch--- I'd be happy eating this everyday.\n\nMy entree was the Khao Soi dish that seems to be extremely popular.  The crispy noodle in contrast to the softer noodle submerged in the broth was very interesting.  The flavors are great. The chicken was dry and bland though. \n\nMy husband got rice noodles with dried shrimp (I forgot the name).  It seemed like a fairly boring pad see ew dish, but the flavors are a lot more complex and interesting than your neighbhorhood Thai restaurant staple noodle dish. \n\nWhy did it remind me of going to a food truck?  The complexity of flavors and aroma makes you salivate instantly, and you end up eating everything so quickly that before you know it, your body feels so full and sluggish it's as if you just ate a 3000 calorie burger.

The flavors jump out at you, the spices are definitely there, and the heat slowly spreads through your body as you devour the dishes.\n\nThe smiling, welcoming, and attractive hostesses seated us quickly each visit (had reservations each time).  The service is quick and efficient - though on the one very busy night I was there it was clear they could have used at least one more person working the floor.  Another nice compliment to the servers - 2 of the 3 times I visited the server asked if there were any dietary restrictions at the table.  On one visit one of the party did not eat seafood.  So the server wrote this down and remembered this during the ordering pointing out any not so obvious seafood element of a dish (for ex, the XO sauce has scallops in it).\n\nPrices are \"reasonable\" for the quality (and considering you are in San Francisco), the portions aren't huge but decent sized.  The dishes are meant to be shared and it seems to work if you get an app and main per person with rice (and maybe an extra dish thrown in for good measure).\n\nHere is a quick rundown of the dishes I have tried there (or at least the ones I remember).\nApps:\n- Mushroom Hor Mok - a curry mousse (not mouse) with excellent mushrooms which you spread over small square ice cakes - a must have - perfect for sharing\n- Hot Chicken Wings - nice kick, 3 decent sized wings - may or may not get again\n- Kua Kling Ribs - small pork ribs with a definite kick, about 8 or 0 in the serving - good for sharing - I really like these \n- Plah Pla Muek - spicy squid dish - very tasty\n- Sai Ua+Namprik Noom - yummy pork sausage with cracklings - no the healthiest dish, but I would get again\n- Rabbit Curry - another good dish that is great for sharing - another return dish (if the others will eat rabbit)\n- Khao Soi Gai - basically a chicken/noodle/broth dish with condiments on the side - very flavorful - but hard to serve into individual bowls (they don't seem to give you serving spoons)\n- Blistered Green Beans in XO Sauce - another great dish (warning, the XO sauce has a scallop extract in it in case you are allergic to shellfish)\n- an grilled eggplant dish - basically a large peice of grilled eggplant with a nice sauce and caramelized onions - again very flavorful though it started to get a little soggy after a while - would get again\n\nWhy only 4 stars vs. the 5 my above description seems to warrant?  Well there are still a few glitches:\n\n1. they make a big deal about delivering food in the proper order - but they seem to be off a bit.  For example, in my visit last night they brought the very spicy pork ribs before the mild eggplant with more nuanced flavorings.  The spiciness of the ribs totally overwhelmed the eggplant.  So we set aside both for a bit and ate a little rice to let the spice mellow out.  But then the eggplant started getting soggy.  It clearly should have been served first.\n\n2. one visit was for an anniversary (with notations on the reservation).  No acknowledgement of that until after the bill was paid and even then the comment was made softly to one member of the party.  Not that we expected much (if anything) but the table next to us (4 somewhat annoying mid-20's foodies from out of town who knew one of the assistant managers from a wedding they all attended) got a free dish and another special item compliments of the chef for simply showing up.  After seeing that I thought we would get a dessert on the house or something - but nothing.\n\n3. during the same dinner as #2, the assistant manager came over to talk to the party next to us and stood between out table and theirs.  Her ass was hanging over our table, bumping our food, etc.  Not something I would expect a restaurant employee to be doing.  Sorry, I don't want someones ass anywhere near my food!!!\n\nIn the end, I won't let the negatives ruin my solid experience and enjoyment of the quality food.

Papaya salad we had asked for the sauce on the side due to both our intolerances for extreme spice, but the kitchen clearly disregarded the server's note, which is kind of unfortunate because we both died promptly after. Definitely wasn't his fault though, and he apologized after he realized their mistake. Sticky rice was good and ordered to try and mitigate the spice though that failed, it helped a bit. Pad kee Mao was also rather spicy although we ordered mild, but I definitely enjoyed the overall flavor a bit more than the other food we had.", "author": "Joy H."}

Despite some non-traditional preparation, I have to agree with my friend that Kin Khao's dishes have the kinds of spice and flavors that I haven't tasted since eating in Thailand. It's definitely not the watered down, sugary American Thai that we're used to here.\n\nThree of us ordered three bites to start plus a bowl each. Bites were bok choy, asparagus, and a seasonal white bean. All great flavors... Baby bok choy was not too watery or over salted as they often are, and cooked perfectly (we were commenting that we could never get bok choy to cook like this at home). Asparagus was XO sauce I believe, enough said. Beans were interesting contrast of crisp and flavor - can't remember what exactly it was but yummy outcome.\n\nI had the pork bowl with meatballs, two enormous slabs of sumptuous pork belly, small chunks of meat, two halves of a runny soft boiled egg in a broth with wide noodles. Soooo good. Broth complemented with nice rich flavor, I stopped myself from drinking the bowl.\n\nLunchmates got the market bowl, which had a little bit of everything. I think they said rabbit meatballs were amazing. I had a taste of the green curry, which made me believe that they get Thai spices - it is spicier than most green curry, not sweet at all (yay) and much more complex. Yum.\n\nWas fairly easy to get a table at lunchtime on a Tuesday. It almost looks like a sandwich shop, not much ambiance, but just fine for lunch time in Union Sq.

But there's an awful lot of completely ignorant proclamations of the greatest this, or the greatest that on Yelp. \n\nSushi, Pizza, Chinese Food, Thai Food. Everyone claims they know what the best is, and are happy to trash anyplace that doesn't conform to their perfect mental picture of what is right.\n\nYet most people haven't been to Japan, to Naples, to Shanghai, or to Thailand. Many of those same people wouldn't be able to tell the difference between fresh wasabi and green horseradish; between di bufala and cow's milk; between lousy dim sum and real xiao long bao; or the difference between curry paste from a jar and curry made from scratch every day.\n\nWhich is why many people don't understand, and never will, just how good Kin Khao is.\n\nThis restaurant doesn't serve your precious, sickly sweet Pad Thai just like you want it from your $6 take-out place down the street? Boo hoo. \n\nThis is some of the best Thai food being made in America today. Period. \n\nWho am I to say? Just a super opinionated foodie who has been to Thailand and eaten well there, from insider street food to some of the top fine restaurants in Bangkok. \n\nI've now been to Kin Khao about four times and eaten almost everything on the menu at least once. I've not been disappointed by anything. And several dishes are complete knockouts, including the Massaman curry, the green curry with rabbit, the pretty hot wings, the pork belly, the Pad Kee Mao and the Mushroom Hor Mok.\n\nNew dishes keep popping up in the restaurant's twitter feed, so I keep having to go back. Last night I had the Laab meatballs and wanted to eat about eight more (you get four with an order).\n\nThe wine list is excellent as well, for those who care about such things (I do -- being able to get a top quality German Riesling or a killer Vouvray with my dinner isn't something I find at most casual San Francisco restaurants, let alone a Thai restaurant). And I highly recommend the Ladyboy Collins cocktail.\n\nI've had nothing but great service, and find it laughable that some people here are actually complaining about getting their \"family style\" food in waves as it is hot and ready, instead of all at once.

If you like your bland neighborhood Thai and you don't like salty food... do NOT go here. You will be miserable. \n\nThe flavors are sometimes aggressive in a fun way to me. The food that I've had (and I've had most of the menu now), is familiar to anyone who knows Thai food, but created in a surprising way where the flavor profiles are just a little twisted. There are also definitely some items on the menu that are totally different than what you could get at the typical Thai place. \n\nEveryone has their own favorites. My niece adores the drunken noodles. I love the sausage, squid, and som tum (which I like to eat with a salted duck egg that you can get on the side). \n\nI did bring my trainer here, who was, I think APPALLED at how salted and seasoned it all was. But she also eats microwaved tilapia and egg whites, asparagus for days, and that sort of crap too. As a result... she looks like her, and I look like me, lol.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-20", "description": "This place has among the worse Thai food I have ever had.  Most of my friends are Thai and I eat Thai food at least twice a week, so I have a good understanding of what Thai food is. I'm not like many other non-Thai people that order Pad Thai or Pad See Ew every time.\n\nMy friend (non-Thai) and I were craving some Thai food after midnight on Thursday/Friday, but most of my go-to spots were already closed. My friend decided to check Yelp for something and found that this place was very near us, was still open, and had good reviews.\n\nWe had a some trouble finding the restaurant because the address took us to the Parc 55 Wyndham.  One of the hotel staff saw that we were out front and confused, and assisted us by informing us that the restaurant was at the same location as the hotel with the entrance being around the corner.\n\nHearing that the restaurant was joined to the hotel made me a bit skeptical, but Million Thai used to be joined to a hotel, and they were good, so we continued.  When we arrived at the restaurant we didn't see one Asian person; not on staff or as a customer aside from us. Another red-flag to me, but I was willing to give it a chance, so long as the food was good.  I will note that at some point we did seem 1 Asian woman who appeared to be on staff and got a glimpse of the kitchen to see at least 1 Asian man cooking.\n\nWe sat at the bar and  ordered 3 things:\nSai Ua - Thai sausage\nKua Kling Ribs - Fried pork ribs\nKhao Soi Gai - Curry w/ chicken and noodle\n\nThe sai ua was the only thing that tasted good and could finish. That's probably because many Thai restaurants don't make their own sausage; they buy it elsewhere and prepare it.\n\nThe ribs seemed like they were coated in a thick layer of seasoning paste then fried.  Seriously, it tasted like I was eating seasoning paste by the spoonful.  I've cooked with red and green curry pastes before, and when I accidentally put too much in, it tasted almost like these ribs.\n\nAs for the Kao Soi Gai, I don't know what the heck was going on here.  It looked as though they used 2 different noodles for this dish, both of which I've never seen in this dish.\n\nI've always seen the noodles being a fried egg noodle that's flat and medium wide. The noodle is served in the curry with some of it submersed in the curry and some sticking out, so you have both soft and crispy noodles.\n\nAt Kin Khao, the fried noodles looked and tasted almost like the crispy noodles you see served in place of bread at an Americanized Chinese restaurant.  The noodles in the curry seemed to be udon or udon-like.  The flavor of the curry was bland and unimpressive.\n\nIf not for the friendly service from the bartender who was serving us, I would probably rate this place 1 star.  Perhaps it was an off night.  Perhaps they prepare food differently for non-Thai and Thai people; I've seen this at other Thai restaurants.\n\nPlenty of other better Thai restaurants in SF.  House of Thai is relatively near and has way better Kao Soi, as does Thai Time, but they're on the other side of the City.\n\nLers Ros, Million Thai, Sai Jai Thai, and iThai are a few other options that are reasonably near with much better food.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

The restaurant is a small spot in the Parc 55 hotel, right off of Market Street. We came around 5:30 and were seated without reservations, but the place got pretty packed after 6. I asked for a drink recommendation, and was told the Tom Yum was the most popular, so I went for it. The drink was very refreshing and had a great of gin, lemongrass, and some other gimlet-like ingredients. We struggled for a while on deciding what to order on the menu. The majority of the menu is pork heavy, and I have to say its not my favorite meat, but we decided to go for it if it was so popular here. We ordered the pork belly, which was soft and delicate, but the waiter told us that it comes with a sauce that we would want with rice, and recommended that we order extra rice. The three of us could not figure out what sauce he was referring too, because the only remnants after the pork belly was some sticky honey-like residues on the plate. I liked the yaowaraj noodles, they had a nice texture, but were on the overly dry side. Lastly, we got the pork sausage wraps, which again had a good sausage, but there was no sauce for the wraps, so it tasted pretty dry. Overall, the food at Kin Khao was not bad, but it is more of a Thai Fusion than authentic thai, and the dishes come with an increased cost due to the Michelin star.", "author": "Nikita K."}

It was very well appointed, with the chairs having a decent but passable faux antiqued finish them. For a Monday night, it seemed rather busy and I was lucky enough to squeeze into a spot at the bar. The bartender that greeted me was very friendly and asked if I'd like to try some of their specialty drinks. I opted out as I was on a bender the previous night in LA. Instead, I went with my usual whiskey. Neat.\n\nI'm normally not for a 3 course meal but I was a ravaneous beast after a 12 hour ride up the coast on Powerade, a snickers bar and I don't know how many Slim Jims. After briefly skimming yelp and the menu, I chose my poison.\n\nI decided to go with the Mushroom Hor Mok Terrine as a starter. It comes with crispy rice cakes and packed in a little jar. The mousse was quite good and had nice large chunks of mushroom hidden within it's thick consistency. I was told the best way to have at it was to dig right down through the different layers to get a bit of everything. It was a bit unwieldy to eat with the rice cakes but definitely worth the bit of splatter on my face. By far my most favorite of the courses. Protip: try this with glass of sipping whiskey (Macallan 12). The smokiness of whiskey REALLY brings out the spiciness of the curry.\n\nNext came the Khao Mun Gai which is basically Thai Chicken rice served with a concentrated, yet very refreshing chicken broth to be sipped. The breasts and rice were cooked just right and the lovely ginger sauce on the side. This is basically peasant food done up fancy. My father cooks this dish at least as good, if not better than I had here, sans the chicken broth side so what I had really hit home, though nothing amazing.\n\nFinally the dessert I ordered was the only one available for the night: the black rice pudding with coconut cream, caramel and puffed fried rice. By far my least favorite dish as the coconut cream had a bit of a sour taste to it, which I was not expecting. The fried rices texture didn't work for me either as I was scooping up creamy spoonfuls of the pudding, the pieces were almost a nuisance to eat. I mentioned my reactions to my bartender and he happily substituted sweet coconut cream for the sour one, which I greatly appreciated. He also recommended I allow the fried rice pieces to sit a bit and \"sog\" up, but I wasn't feeling it at that point.\n\nPrice: 4 stars\nService: 5 stars\nFood: 4 stars\nAmbience: 4 stars", "author": "Duc D."}

Obviously a seasonal item and a must try!\n\nKua Kling Ribs 10\n\"spicy dry-fried pork ribs in southern-style turmeric curry paste, Kaffir leaves\" -- very heavy on the dry rub. Maybe my least favorite dish and it was still pretty great. I wouldn't order it again, but I'm glad we tried it.\n\nCaramelized Pork Belly  13\n\"sweet, savory, voluptuous pork belly cooked in a clay pot\" -- yelpers raving about this but I found it to be too fatty and not caramelized enough. Pretty plain compared to everything else. Maybe it needed a vegetable or noodles or something....\n\nMassaman Nuea 25\n\"braised beef cheek in Massaman curry paste, coconut milk, burnt shallots, potatoes\" -- Extremely rich and flavorful! The beef cheeks were delicate and so so rich. Eat one and done.

So, we were very excited.Here's where it went wrong.\n\n\nWe arrived 5 minutes early for our reservation but were seated immediately.It was a 6 o'clock reservation so the place was only half full but got packed by the time we left. Its on the corner of Ellis and Mason so its on the BACKEND of the Parc 55 hotel. A waiter approached our table and poured water and gave us the menus. We both knew what we were going to order food wise but we hadn't looked at the drink menu. We were both going to order the Thai Mint Julep so Jovanie changed his to a different drink.It tasted like a Thai Iced Tea.I was surprised because it didn't taste like a mint julep at all, not that that was a bad thing. I usually order a shot of whiskey with dinner, especially if its something i haven't had before. They had a whiskey called Green Spot , which i had ever even heard of before so when the waiter asked us if we had any questions, i asked what kind of whiskey is it, so he said\"i'll go ask the bartender and i'll be right back!'\n\nHe never came back.\n\nWell, he didn't come back until he was dropping off our main courses.\n\nA woman came up to our table 10 minutes after the first waiter and asked how we were.It turned out that i had met her when she worked at Flour and Water, so we talked for a minute and left. Jovanie thought she was our waiter and i said no, i think she's the manager.\n\n10 minutes after that, we finally got our waiter, who was British or Australian and seemed very nice but by this point, we are both kind of irritated because its been about 20 minutes and we still haven't even out our drink order in. So when i asked this guy about the green spot, he said he'd have to go ask and i said \"forget it,ill just order it!\" and i ordered the mint julep with it. Of course he came back about 5 minutes later and told me they were out of that whiskey so i just order four roses.....just to be safe.......\n\nwe got the mushroom terrine and the green beans as an appetizer. The terrine was delicious but i couldn't help but notice that it tastes a lot like Gang Garee Gai, which is yellow curry with potatoes and chicken but, of course, minus those two ingredients.Jovanie liked his green beans but thought that Hawker Fare did it better. \nOur main course arrived and i got the Khao Soi Gai noodle dish since Yelpers seemed to love it.I liked it a lot. But it wasn't anything i had to come back for. Jovanie got the pork bowl, which he felt the same about. \n\nWe decided to skip dessert because we were underwhelmed by that point.I tried ordering an IPA but,of course, they were out of that too, so i settled for a chocolate stout beer which was okay. I'd say if this were in my neighborhood,i'd go every once in awhile when i wanted Thai food but honestly, Hawker Fare does this food a lot better AND a lot cheaper.", "author": "Jim M."}

The place can be tricky to find, as it's on the 2nd floor of the hotel and there's not much signage either inside or outside the hotel. The atmosphere is very casual, which is cool considering Michelin-starred places are often more buttoned up.\n\nWe both ordered from the pre fixe tasting menu and these were our impressions:\n\nHits:\nMushroom terrine - Great texture, both on the creamy mousse and the crispy rice cakes\nCaramelized pork belly - The sweet sauce is quite addictive and we ended up dipping chunks of sticky rice in the sauce to soak up as much of it as possible.\nBrussel sprouts w/ XO sauce - Loved the depth of flavor in this dish. The earthy and fishy flavors pair really well.\n\nMisses:\nPapaya salad - SPICY. I'm usually ok when it comes to spice tolerance, but this one was so spicy it was inedible.\nNam tok beans - Again, the spice prevented us from enjoying the dish fully. I'd already gone through two pitchers of water and wiped my brow 20 times at this point. Did they accidentally drop a ghost pepper in these dishes?\nShrimp paste curry - Extremely salty. After the previous two spicy dishes, another rich dish was not what we needed. Mouth was very numb.\nBraised beef cheeks - Good meat quality, but the curry was too salty again.\n\nThere were some fine dishes, but overall, the misses overshadowed the meal.

A curry is not a soup with coconut milk. They use the exclusion of an ingredient to serve you lackluster soup.\n4) Khao Soi Gai with Tofu - The noodles were like any other Thai noodles. \n5) Yum Yai Salad - This is a salad with kale chips. Limited seasoning and mostly tasteless. \n6) The Pork Bowl - Tender but we only get 4 small pieces of pork. \n7) Drinks - Their drink menu is mostly alcoholic.

Modern yet pleasant in design with wood and white dominating the d\u00e9cor as a small kitchen tinkered and clinked just out of sight it was perhaps five minutes before the afternoon's sole server arrived at my side and having already noted the missing mushroom jar I inquired to its availability only to be denied, a pair of lunch specials offered along with eight other savories from which I selected three along with the menu's lone sweet.  Stating up front that both the lunch menu and he himself were 'new' it was with an error that my waiter first brought Thai Iced Tea in place of the coconut tinged cold brew I'd requested and although bright with tamarind a few sips was enough, the creamy java far better fitting my palate as well as the opening volley of three funky wings themselves quite hefty in the orange Indian aromatic amidst a sauce of acid and spice.  Explaining that I was really in no hurry as the meal marched on it was next in the daily special of fried quail that I partook and although quite crispy the flavor itself lacked, a touch of Pim's chili jam enlivening things a bit while slightly sweet rice was a filler par for the course.  Moving onward to one of five items under the section labeled \"eats\" it was with admitted indecision that I selected between the Khao Mun Gai and Khao Yum Kai Dao but eventually opting for crispy duck eggs over the chef-recommended 'chicken fat fried rice' I can only assume I made the right choice, the runny yolks acting to meld a multitude of complex flavors while bold textures arrived in each bite.  At this point admittedly eavesdropping on the conversation of the doubly Michelin Starred chef just two seats away as he chatted with a friend about the ballgame they were in town to attend it was just under an hour and ten minutes after I sat down that my final plate arrived and served steaming from the kitchen though I cannot attest to just how 'authentic' any of it was I can definitively declare the rice pudding as excellent, an $8 portion big enough to share served to be dressed like an American sundae proving to be one of the top two or three takes on the dish I've experienced to date.", "author": "Michael U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-10", "description": "Excerpt from my blog, tayav.com:\n\nTo say I have been anticipating the opening of Chez Pim's Kin Khao is an understatement. I finally made it to Kin Khao (which literally means \"eat rice\" - a term Thais use to say \"let's eat\") two months ago. I really didn't know what to expect. I was anticipating traditional Thai flavors that K. Pim frequently mentions, but also playful explorations on Thai dishes. After a truthfully lackluster meal at the highly hyped Night + Market in Los Angeles, I braced myself, but went in with an empty stomach and an open mind.\n\nWe started off with drinks, delicious with hints of Thai flavors and not too overpowering: Thai Herb Julep, Ladyboy Collins (mine - it changes colors from pink to purple. Get it? ;), and the Chow Suan Gin.\n\nNext, some small bites.  The Pretty Hot Wings, right, were very tasty. They definitely had a kick and I loved the tamarind flavor in them. And, as crazy as it sounds, they were even tastier with more Sriracha to dip!\n\nThe next dish is my favorite thing here at Kin Khao. The Saeng-wah Salad is a modern take on a traditional Thai salad, the Saeng-wah (literally meaning \"play-chastise\"), which is basically shrimp crudo, made in a Thai style. It's basically very ceviche-like, with a Thai kick - the red chili peppers are potent, so watch out! This is a traditional Thai dish that I've never tried, so I was pleasantly surprised. Pim kicks it up by pairing it with another Thai favorite, pla duk foo, or crispy catfish, also typically eaten with a salad of green mango that has the same tangy flavor. Served with raw shallots and red peppers, I could not get enough of this dish. \n\nI was really looking forward to trying the chili jam clams, and they didn't disappoint. They were sweeter than I imagined, but I am also accustomed to the bottled chili jams. What I appreciated most about these were the size of these babies that you would not get at any mom n pop Thai restaurant. These clams were huge! The  Khun Yai's Green Curry with Rabbit was also an interesting take on your traditional green curry. The curry flavors didn't stand out as much as I had hoped -- definitely heavier on the coconut milk side, but the rabbit meatballs were so tasty, and the rabbit meat was not gamey at all. \n\nThe Klua Kling ribs are my husband's favorite and the item he ordered again on our second time at Kin Khao. The flavors of the rib tasted like the curry was really homemade -- like chopped and pounded with mortar and pestle with love to create this dish. I've had this traditional southern Thai dish in many places (including Night + Market and authentic Kua Kling in southern Thailand), and this was pretty close to what I remember eating in Thailand. It wasn't too soggy, and like many curries. was even more intense as a second meal (as proven by my dinner the following day).\n\nWe tried he Black Rice Pudding Dessert. The first thing I appreciated about this dessert was that she calls it what it is in Thai: Black Rice. It ain't forbidden - it's my favorite type of rice. The texture of black rice is a bit heartier, much like brown rice. It's served paired with coconut milk (a must!) and caramelized palm sugar (yum - so rare), as well as crispy rice flakes. \n\nDishes on second visit: The Mushroom Hor Mok is a vegetarian take on another traditional Thai dish, made by steaming a paste mixture of fish, coconut milk and curry. Pim's version of this dish goes the vegetarian route, and combines another Thai favorite, khao tung. A traditional Thai snack/small bites dish, khao tung, the rice crackers, are eaten with a savory mixture of coconut milk, peanuts, caramelized onions and ground pork. The hor mok is served in a pot de creme style, eaten with the khao tung (it's normally eaten with regular rice). This is delicious, and even tastier the second day as leftovers.\n\nAnother dish I was keen on trying was the Sai Ua + Nam Prik Noom. Sai Ua sausage is made with similar flavors as the Kua Kling. The intensity of the herbs comes from the kaffir lime leaves. It's served paired with another northern favorite, Nam Prik Noom. Traditionally, this is a bright green chili paste made from green peppers finely minced. Pim creates a more salsa-like version here with roasted peppers, which give it a unique, albeit still intense flavor. It's also served paired with homemade chiccarones (need I say more?) and quality, fresh vegetables. I've never had butter lettuce with nam prik noom, so I couldn't stop munching on that!\n\nMy husband describes it best when he says Kin Khao isn't your average Thai place in the States, which seeks to mimic the down-home-comfort flavors at a simple, family-style restaurant (and not to say I don't love those!). As a Bangkokian, Kin Khao is that place you'd goon a Friday night with friends -- the hip new place that's reimagined the flavors you grew up  with into something magical.", "author": "Taya V."}

You may see several items on the menu that you may not have heard of unless you grew up or lived in Thailand. \n\nMy favorite of the night is Green curry with rabbit and rabbit meatballs. I know Easter's is coming up, but you should give this dish a try. Rabbit leg is tender and smooth (it tastes better than chicken!). Rabbit meatballs are unbelievably good. The green curry is Khun Pim's grandma recipe. It's rich with coconut milk yet very flavorful from fresh curry paste. \n\nOther dishes I like are:\n\nFried Duck Egg Spicy Salad.

I was amazed that for once the staff actually thought the music was too loud and turned it down for us. That literally never happens anywherelse. As for the food? It was really tasty and I mean clean off the plate deliciousness. The wait staff was very kind and helped us understand what we were getting ourselves into as well as telling us what's sold out already. My personal favorites, the curry cod dish, I secretly wish they'd bottle that broth up to let me take home! It was that good. Then clay pot pork belly...I know what you are thinking, pork belly is been done to death and generally, I would agree, but these pork bellies were so understated yet insanely delicious. They dissolve upon consumption. Overall it was a great experience. Only wish the prices were better, but I suppose one star Michelin joint has to have an one star Michelin price tag. :) definitely will come back for lunch! \n\nFinal parting thought: if you are looking for the usual bland pad Thai, Tom yum soup, other fares you can find in countless Thai outfits then this is not for you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-02-26", "description": "I've learned something valuable. Ignore the hype. Respect my fellow yelpers. From the press, one might think this was the greatest new Thai restaurant in history. Yelp tells another story and I learned the lesson last night. \n\nFirst of all, they can't get the basics right. The address of 55 Cyril Magnin is wrong. The restaurant is not on Cyril Magnin at all. I was there, could not find it, called, and then I was told to go to the corner of \"Cyril Magnin and Mason and Ellis.\" Seriously? When is the last time you found a street intersection that had 3 streets on it (excepting the unusual case of circles and non-square street configurations). Anyway, there is no such place. I told the guy on the phone they need to fix the address and he just ignored me. I hung up on him and had to search for the place myself because he was no help. It turns out, they are on the corner of Mason and Ellis. Not on Cyrill Magnin at all. It's one thing that they publish the wrong address, but for the guy who answers the phone to not even know where they are is inexcusable. \n\nService was also disappointing. I spent 10 minutes studying the menu because I didn't like any of the options and was trying to figure out what to do, then after that, the same dude who answered the phone comes to my table and tells me it's the wrong menu and gives me a new one, then I have to start again. \n\nThe food choices were not inspiring. They have no soups. I always go for Thai soup. And, in the curry section, they have rabbit, beef, or vegetable. No duck, no chicken, no seafood. Creative and diverse - yes - credit for that. But, I'm just not into rabbit. I'm an adventurous eater but I don't like eating rodents. Rabbits are just too close to rats, and I can't cross that line into the rodent family when it comes to eating dinner. I'm fine with them serving rabbit, but if that's the only non-beef choice, it doesn't leave a lot of option. I don't consider vegetables to be a meal. So, the only choice for me was the beef. \n\nIt was a beef shank with bone in and marrow. The mix of marrow with curry was brilliant. I really enjoyed that. The curry itself is the best I've had in SF. Made from scratch, without too much sugar. But, the beef itself was cheap crap. Poor quality meat, most likely factory farmed meat, a huge portion, and it was incorrectly cooked. The marrow was still cold. And, the meat was hard and chewy. This kind of meat should be falling off the bone. It was hard and rubbery either because it was cooked too fast at too high a temperature or it was factory farmed meat from a sick animal that never had the chance to move or eat well, or both. \n\nThis one dish was $26. Well over $30 with tax and tip. Way too expensive for a single dish, especially one that doesn't even taste very good. \n\nI'd give this place a 2 star except I give 1 more star because I think they have good intentions, passion, and at least some integrity on making their own curries. It's clear, at least in some ways, they're really trying. But, I have no desire to go back. \n\nMost disappointing, at the end, the guy at the front desk (same one who didn't know where the restaurant is located, and who swapped out my menu after I'd been studying the old one for 10 minutes) asked me how the meal was. I expressed disappointment, said in a somewhat unhappy voice that it was \"just ok\" and rather than connect with what I was saying, he giggled and wiggled his ass.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-02", "description": "I'm perplexed by the handful of recent reviews. Mainly because people don't get what Kin Khao is all about. Yes, it's a Thai restaurant, but it's not your typical Thai restaurant. The prices are a bit higher because of the purveyors (check out their website) and the quality of the ingredients. You won't find every single curry in the book. You're not going to find your typical pad thai. This is not the place for you if you want cheap and low quality Thai food! Turn around, now. What Pim is trying to do is serve some of her favorite Thai dishes that we typically don't see. She wants to expand the knowledge of what Thai cuisine really is, that's why the dishes are different. They are dishes you don't typically see in an Americanized Thai establishment. And mind you, everything is fresh. Even the curry paste is made in-house. \n\nI did go back to eat at Kin Khao two days after my first visit. Luckily, I went with a larger party so we ordered more off of the menu! \n\nBITES:\nMushroom Hor Mok - AMAZING. After reading the description, I imaged a spread--almost like a pate. When it arrived, the mousse came in a jar with several rice crackers. The mousse was amazingly well-balanced. Great flavor and texture from the mushrooms. We were really debating not ordering this since it's a vegan dish, but we were quite surprised! We all loved it.\nYum Kai Dao - My favorite dish! The flavors and textures were so well balanced! Crunchy, fresh, spicy, sweet, rich. The duck yolk was so runny and just coated everything perfectly. I could've eaten a whole bowl myself.\n\nMEATS:\nKua Kling Ribs - Sadly the pork belly was 86'd at 6pm. Sad about that. However, our backup plan were the ribs. These were spicy! Be prepared. But the ribs were tender and they didn't skimp on the rub! A bit too spicy for me, but the flavors were there and spot on.\n\nFISH+SEAFOOD:\nChilli Jam Clams - Clams were plump and juicy. Light dish and not spicy if you want something a bit more toned down.\n\nCURRIES: \nMassaman Nong Lai - Yum! Really liked this a lot (love the rabbit curry better, though). The meat was extremely tender. I loved the sweetness of the burnt shallots and I just love potatoes in curry. Of the massaman and the rabbit (which we had last time), I love the rabbit more--especially the day after!\n\nRICE+NOODLES:\nCrab Sen Chan - Oh yum! Very similar to pad thai, but these were so good! The noodles were cooked perfectly (my Thai friend told me that rice noodles should be a bit chewy and not at all mushy! Think al dente). I loved the bits of crab throughout. I could've eaten a whole bowl of this as well.\n\nGREENS:\nKanah Pad XO Sauce - I typically don't like Chinese broccoli. I don't like how bitter it can get, but Kin Khao did them justice. These were quickly cooked and blanched, I think, to keep the crunch and color. They were soggy or bitter, but perfect! Chinese brocolli done right. \n\nWe ordered white rice on the side and I have to say that I have never been to a Thai restaurant where they served rice with curry. You always had to order it separately! That's just my experience.\n\nOverall I would go back. This is one of my new favorite spots and I would go myself and order the mushroom mousse, the fried duck egg, the rabbit curry, and some rice. That would be my perfect meal, right now, at Kin Khao.", "author": "Diana Lyn Z."}

All of the staff greeted us and were very nice except for him. No hellos, no goodbyes. Just bad juju!\n\nAnyway,  3 out of 4 arrived well before 6 and I would say that the place was about 15% full (if that). We asked to be seated but Sam refused to seat us b/c our 4th wasn't present. The funny part is that during this time, a waiter was standing next to Sam and said, \"Sure!\" just as Sam said, \"No\", but then quickly went into, \"err\" mode b/c even he knew it was cool to seat us. Well10 minutes later our fourth finally arrived, so we were seated. OK, fast forward to our dining experience...Sam literally lurked around the restaurant. Now I understand that it's part of a manager's job to oversee the restaurant, but he would literally walk around the tables every 3 minutes which made it look more obvious. Maybe we wouldn't have noticed him as much if he wasn't dressed on the sloppy side (the waiters were much better dressed).\n\nPork belly Noodle Soup\n- Definitely flavorful, but the pork belly pieces were small. Instead of traditional noodles (stingy), the noodles are square rice noodles, but they're all stuck together, so it was a little tedious to remove them even with expert chopstick skills. Additionally, the two orders that we received were luke warm when we received them. \n\nCrab Pad Thai (There's a fancy name, but it's essentially crab pad thai)\n- Despite being pad thai, this order came almost 8 minutes after our soup dishes. The waiter kept on telling us it would be another minute which was fine, but when we saw what the dish looked like, it was surprising b/c pad thai is super easy to make. Also, we couldn't even taste the crab which is unfortunate since there is an abundant amount of crab in SF.\n\nDish sizes\nThe portions aren't small, they're average, but the dishes are pretty pricey.\n\nDrinks\n- $12 for cocktails is a little high for this place\n\n**Disclaimer** Unlike Dave S., I'm not a certified Thai Food Taster.

This a very personal and eclectic take on Thai food with dish that you probably wouldn't find in Bangkok either. The dishes that were good were very good, the dish that wasn't good was quite bad. The spice might be hotter than most Americans are used but the quality of ingredients and the atmosphere are very San Francisco.\n\n\n\nFinally got to go for dinner. The Khun Yai's Green Curry with Rabbit is some of the best rabbit I've had in California and the curry was really good. I want the recipe for the rabbit meatballs. I found the portion of meat to be plenty and I took half the dish home. I seriously will go back just for that even if it's 22 dollars.\n\nWe had an octopus dish that was really disappointing because the octopus was very chewy and rubbery. I hope it's not a regular dish or they work on how they cook the octopus. The French Spouse found the chili acidic sauce with it too hot for their palate but they tend to not do heat as much as I do. I found it strong but manageable.\n\nWe also had the Khao Soi with Tofu $15 which was good portion for one person. It didn't suffer at all from having a veggie broth.\n\nWe started with the Yum Kai Dao which I've always liked in all it's personal variations and this was great with lots of flavour.\n\nI liked that the rice and sparkling and still water is free. We also got the tamarind water, 2 \"thai ice teas\" and one thai ice coffee. They have a developed cocktail menu and the drinks looked good as did the cool boys behind the bar.\n\nService for us was great. Our server knew the menu, was able to make suggestions and checked in. It's was 2/3 full but there was a large table that I think got everything on the menu and it looked so good. Pim was in the house and brought out a dish and was totally on top of her staff in a good way.\n\nWe did spend a 100 dollars something I haven't done at a Thai place in SF but have done at places in Sydney and in resorts in South East Asia.\n\nIt probably wouldn't become our regular weekly Thai place but I am going back for the rabbit and to try a few of the dishes we saw other tables having.\n\nIt's wheelchair accessible (lift on the outside corner stairs and through the lobby).

But service was good and helpful and I enjoyed my meal.  By the way, portion sizes are ample.\n\nSai Ua+Namprik Noom, a grilled  pork sausage, that came with sticky rice, spicy pepper relish, lettuce leaves and addictive cracklings is one of those plates you are supposed to wrap and assemble on your own.

They said we were their first group this large so I'm sure we were putting their restaurant to the test.  \n\nFirst off this place is a little hard to find, but if you walk through the hotel you will find it easily.  The ambience is excellent, like modern restaurant with a twist of old school thai cooking.  I walked into the restaurant and thought the owner looked familiar, been watching her YouTube channel for a while now! So was very excited to finally try her food.\n\nThe green curry with rabbit is a must have!!! I have never had curry that was so fragrant... I'm sure they made the curry paste in house or something because you could clearly taste all the different spices in it.  Can someone say kefir leaves? It was a little spicy... But oh so very good. Love that burn.  The octopus was also delicious too, very fresh and was cut j to small prices so those who aren't into trying different foods can just snag a smaller piece.  \n\nIf you are looking to have a large group this place is lovely for it, l but I would keep the group to a max of 12-14 since the communal table can only seat that many.  We ended up splitting the table into smaller \"tables\" so the bill was easier to handle.", "author": "Timothy S."}

My boyfriend and I went family style and had 3 dishes between the 2 of us. We got the rabbit curry (omg, the meatballs in it were out of this world. i could eat a dish of just that), spicy dry-fried pork ribs (borderline too spicy for this girl, but still retained a lot of flavor), and the octopus (well flavored as a whole, but some bites were more chewy/overcooked than others, so the dish wasn't as consistent as the rest). The drinks were well made, but at $12 each, I started to question whether it was worth it to order a 2nd or just buy a full bottle of wine at $40. \nAll in all, great service and an authentic Thai meal, but minus points for pricey drinks, really really bright lighting/lack of ambiance.

There are no easily visible signs of Kin Khao from the street.  Turns out it's inside the Parc 55 Hotel, on the 2nd Floor.  When you go inside, you have to go up the escalator and there are no obvious signs so I had to ask the front desk.  Turns out you go past the elevators all the way around to the other side, and there it finally is, without a sign on the door.   \n\nThe restaurant is actually quite small but buzzing with people.  We had just read a NYTimes piece on it so we were excited to try the \"authentic\" cuisine.   Sure enough, the menu is not what you'd find at a typical Thai restaurant in SF.  Everything was actually really good, but a bit unusual, and for the most part a bit heavy. \n\nWe ordered:\nMushroom Hor Mok Terrine - tasty mason jar of curry and mushroom mousse with crispy rice crackers.  Pretty heavy start to the meal.  \nYum Yai Salad - a bit bitter but a pretty good salad nonetheless.  Not really that special but nice to get some fresh greens at a Thai restaurant. \nPad Kee Mao - my favorite dish of the evening. Stir fried drunken noodles with ground pork, garlic, chili, bell peppers, etc.  Also really wasn't as spicy as it was billed to be.  Noodles were cooked to the right texture, it was super tasty, and add a bit of their non-MSG sriracha and it was perfect.  \nSai Ua + Namprik Noom - we were choosing between this and their umami bomb but decided to go a safer route.  This was really good, with the pork sausage nicely done, and it was fun to combine the lettuce, darn spicy pepper relish (which wasn't as darn spicy as the name suggested), cucumber slices, chichicharones, and sticky rice.  It wasn't the most elegantly rolled food, but it was an interesting combination. \nBeef cheek curry - this was really super tender melt in your mouth braised beef in a thick curry broth with potato.  It was also rather heavy, as you'd imagine.  I might try the rabbit green curry next time given other reviews. \n\nOverall, I was excited to try the dishes and liked the fact that it wasn't your standard Thai-American fare - the food was nicely prepared, tasty, unusual.   I'll probably bring other friends to try it, but this seems less likely to be my go-to Thai when I have a Pad Thai craving.", "author": "Vivian W."}

Kin Khao occupies a small space inside the Parc 55 hotel on the corner of Ellis and Mason street. Don't let the modest space deceive you; Kin Khao has been recently awarded a Michelin star and is being hailed as not only of the top Thai restaurants in the city but all restaurants in general. It has definitely become my favorite Thai eatery in the city! My wife and I shared three plates....the yaowaraj noodles, caramelized pork belly, and the massaman nuea. The noodles were like a pad see ew type of flat noodles made with chicken and veggies. They had a distinct yet pleasing fish sauce and/or paste. Solid dish. The pork belly came out bubbling in a clay pot and was super fatty and decadent. Cut the richness with some silky steamed rice and you're good to go! Lastly, the massaman nuea stole the show! Holy crap this was euphoric good! It was a big chunk of braised beef cheek wading in a big bowl of curry sauce. The meat was fork tender and the curry flavors  deep and complex. That sauce was awesome drenched over my rice and noodles. Hell, you could pour that sauce over a shoelace and it would taste good!

No warmth which is surprising to me since Thai/Laotian people in general are very pleasant which does not transalte at all to the staff.  Again, I really like the food here.\n\nRegardless, I will keep coming back and look forward to a friendlier experience (fingers crossed!)\n\nI've pretty much tasted everything on the menu.

I always have to get extra rice cakes.  In fact just go ahead and order the extra rice cake, you'll need it.\n\nChili Jam Clams - a must!!!!  Again the perfect balance of spice and sweetness.

The server suggested we order this with sticky rice, which we did, and found this to be an ideal complement.\n\nThe khao mun gai was exactly as described but the different element to it is that they recommend you drink some of the chicken broth as you eat the poached chicken and chicken fat rice. The rice isn't heavy at all; the fat is all in the broth.

The khao kan jin was good but it's just overpriced street food that any Asian grandma can make better. As were the mushroom terrine, fried duck egg, pork belly and the curries, all ok, but way too salty for my preference.

My wife has made many successful dishes based from her recipes in her book and we were sure everything will be good there. We went to Kin Khao on the opening Friday and were the first people through the door. The food did not disappoint! I tend to over order and go quite excited to try the food. We had 1 appetizer, 1 salad, 2 main dishes, 1 dessert , 1 cocktail and 2 other drinks; First, we had the Pretty Wings. They looked to be sweet, but really weren't. The flavor was very balanced and simply delicious, unlike any wings I had any any other Thai restaurants. Next we had the Yum Yai salad. I can't get over the contrast between the fresh vegetables and the fried ones. it's completely wonderful. The chille jam based dressing is also very tasty. For the main course, we had the Beef Massaman curry and the Crab Sen Jan noodle. The flavor of the curry was true, a lot like what I remember eating growing up in Bangkok. The highlight is the bone marrow that is eaten with the meat. Oh, so good! I love it so much. The noodle dish can be mistaken for a Pad Thai dish, but they are two distinct and different dishes. I  especially like the crab bits. So satisfying. Finally, we had the black rice dessert. I love the caramel sauce that goes with the coconut. It was not sweet like I had imagined. I enjoyed it so much even though I was completely full at this point and we had to pack some food home. For drinks, I had the Rasa Umami. It felt spicy by itself, but went really well with the food. I think they had done a great job creating cocktails to go with the food on the menu. BTW, we had 1 ice tea and 1 ice coffee as well as the cocktail. They are both sophisticated  and not overly sweet. \n\nAll in all, this will be my new go to Thai eatery in San Francisco and I will likely make many more trips here in the future.", "author": "Soraj P."}

I had heard great thing about this restaurant from friends, but it was such an underwhelming dining experience.\n\nMaking a reservation was super easy. It was the Friday before a holiday, and there were plenty of time slots available for a party of four on OpenTable. When I got to the restaurant, the hostess was nice, and informed me that our table would be ready in a few minutes. That was all good.\n\nWe sat down and ordered drinks. After that, it sort of went downhill for me. After we got our drinks, it took at least 25 minutes for our waitress to come back and take our order. I even tried to flag her down, but that didn't work. I will give her credit for answering our questions about the menu, and being nice.\n\nWe attempted to order the Pad Kee Mao and the Chili Jam Clams, but both were out! That was a HUGE disappointment. I understand if clams are sold out for the day, assuming that these are fresh catches, and the restaurant has a limited supply. But, for a Thai restaurant to run out of noodles?! That's just crazy. So, after some reconsideration of the menu with the waitress, we ordered the Nam Tok Beans, Pretty Hot Wings, Duck Panang, Sauteed Bok Choy and Kua Kling Ribs. \n\nThe Nam Tok Beans were amazing! The acidity, tanginess, freshness from the mint and cilantro, and the crispy outside and soft inside of the beans were just perfect. This was probably the highlight of our meal\n\nPretty Hot Wings - ehhh...I've had better wings. Try Pok Pok if you're ever in Portland.\n\nDuck Panang - super disappointing. I love my curry, but the flavor was just not there. It was very flat in taste. The only good thing about this dish was the braised duck, which was great, and perhaps the pineapple. Otherwise, probably one of the most disappointing curry dishes I've ever had.\n\nSauteed Bok Choy - The second highlight of the meal...that should give you some insight as to the meal overall.\n\nKua Kling Ribs - Sounds better than it looks and tastes. It is quite spicy, and the ribs were tender. But again, the flavor profile of these ribs was just so flat. It was heck of a lot of spice, and nothing else. It was almost as if you're eating tender ribs (no salt added) with a bunch of dry rub spice.\n\nAll in all, I probably won't come back unless I see a change in the menu.", "author": "Paul P."}

We began with faintly crunchy blistered green beans with XO sauce, which our server helpfully informed us contained ham, dried shrimp, dried scallops.  Marvelous, leaving no doubt what the \"xo\" refers to.  \n\nThe Kao Soi Gai had sweetness and spice in perfect equilibrium, the red curry bathing fantastic chewy egg noodles and slices of chicken, set off by crunchy egg noodles and pickled turnip greens.  Only my expectation of food to come (and maybe a shred of decorum) prevented me from lifting and sipping from the bowl to savor every drop.   \n\nOur Khao Mun Gai lived up to its hype, the gloriously rich and unhealthy chicken fat rice, superior moist poached chicken, and a sensual secret sauce undoubtedly containing a variety of controlled substances.

I really want to give these guys 3.5 stars. \n\nThere are two things holding this place back from a higher rating. Location is one. They're in the Parc 55 hotel and unless you're walking locally it's a little bit of a pain to wind up here as a destination. The other is the decor. It was far more downscale than I anticipated. Neither of these are show stoppers however because the food is really good. Service too.\n\nWe started with a jar of pickled vegetables...carrots, onions and a few others. Crispy, not too pungent, fresh. Great start. We then ordered three dishes to share between two of us. We over-ordered maybe a bit but I wanted a fairly broad sampling. We ordered:\n\nSai Ua+Namprik Noom  - grilled house-made Northern Thai pork sausage, cracklings, with darn spicy young pepper relish. Delicious. I never expected to see pork sausage on a Thai menu. Like everything we ordered, the flavors popped. Well spiced but not over the top.\n\nKhao Mun Gai  - chicken fat rice, ginger-poached chicken, Pim's secret sauce, served with intense chicken consomm\u00e9. This is the dish we'd heard about and the one we were really curious about. Unusual (in a good way) presentation with the diner sipping chicken stock as part of the dish. \n\nKhun Yai's Green Curry with Rabbit  - Kiew Wan curry paste, rabbit loin & saddle, rabbit meatballs, Thai Apple eggplants, Thai basil, Bird's Eye chili. This was my favorite. The rabbit was tender and moist in a curry with a touch of sweetness.Just an excellent dish.\n\nThe service was efficient and friendly if not overly personable. Fine.\n\nIf I'm downtown I'll definitely be back.\n\n3.5 stars.", "author": "Gary C."}

In general, all the food was solid - good, clean flavors, large portions (for an upscale restaurant!) and super filling.\n\nOf the dishes I had, the Kua Kling ribs were my favorite. Simple succulent and rubbed with so many lovely spices (SO YUMMY!), they had a great kick and I loved them. Next would be the octopus, which had a nice smoke to it and perfectly balanced tender and chewy. My third favorite would be the mushroom Hor Mok. This dish was super unique and very well balanced. If you love curry and mushrooms, it's a must have.\n\nA sad note is that I was a bit disappointed with my Thai Girl cocktail. The lime was very strong and I couldn't taste the banana in it at all. And the noise level is high. I was originally worried about the spice level, but all the dishes had a good kick to them without being overwhelming.\n\nAll that said, I'd probably stop by again.

I came here with a friend and we ordered the Khao Kan Jin, caramelized pork belly, and the pretty hot wings. The blood sausage onions, scallions, lime, and cilantro and mixed into a very unique blend of fresh and savory. It made for a light yet tasty start of a meal. Next was the pork belly, which is actually the highlight of the meal for me. Put simply, this might have been the best pork belly I've ever had. It was caramelized and cooked to perfection. The meat was fatty but not at all chewy, and just melted in my mouth. Last up were the pretty hot wings, but to be honest this was a bit of a miss for me. There was just nothing special about it. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't particularly good. I guess I just had higher expectations from the first two courses. All in all though, the place is priced more than fairly for a Michelin starred restaurant and definitely worth the trip if you find yourself in San Francisco.", "author": "Patrick S."}

Enjoyed this one very much.  \n\nPanna Cotta with Pim's Preserves.  Dessert was the only true disappointment.  The panna cotta was soupy and unformed.  Tasted like watery yogurt.  We asked the server if this was a bad batch to which he replied it is meant to be that way.  Not sure if he was just winging it and we caught him off guard or whether this dish was truly meant to be soupy but I would expect a panna cotta to be gently formed or it isnt a panna cotta, right?  I'll say this was a miss.\n\nAll in all, I give kin khao 3 stars for potential and I would return and recommend this place.  I'm guessing that they're having some early growing pains which is to be expected but this place is a welcome addition to the SF restaurant scene.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-15", "description": "Despite of the hype of the reviews here, I find the food here to be a \"OK\". I ordered the minced pork drunken noodle and spicy chicken wings for lunch. The total tab for these and an iced coffee come to be $50 dollars. That's some expensive lunch (the lunch set menu at a one star Michelin restaurant in downtown Manhattan was $50 so that gives you some idea). I do believe the food was delicately prepared. But the flavoring was either off or way too salty / rich. The hot sauce glazed over the spicy chicken wings tastes nothing usual than the tiny bottle hot sauce you find in a grocery store aisle. And there were so much of it (for the first five seconds, I was sucking sauce off the wings to get to the meat). Despite of my high tolerance for spicy food, all I tasted in my drunken noodle are chili peppers and sugar. The flavoring of the food in the restaurant is very typical of what attracts the majority of american's tastebuds: salty, sweet and overpowering. Well, if you are a thoughtful eater, that is far from the definition of good food. But I guess that works for the main street. If thats what you are into, for me, I was left parched by the amount sodium i inhaled at lunch and had to drink lots of water for the rest of the afternoon. One star for the service, one start for frying the wings crispy and one start for trying to make good food (but did not get there). The price is way too high.

Serve starters & entrees in two hot courses, like a real restaurant.\n\nThe service was friendly and quirky, but clueless. We were asked the same question several times, they forgot to bring real serving utensils, and so on.\n\nThe dry ribs had a pleasant lingering heat, and the beef cheek curry was very well done. The pork bowl was bland, and its loose egg was overcooked. The poor squid was overpowered by vinegar & ginger, but the other dishes could have used more seasoning.\n\nExcellent cocktails which were refreshingly not oversweet.

Not the typical Thai restaurant catering to western taste, Kin Khao stays true to the authenticity of Thai food. Their expertise use & infusion of the Asian spices puts them in a class by themselves.

Next came the pad kee mao, one of my usual favorites when it comes to Thai cuisine. Again, it was so overwhelmingly spicy that I was not able to taste any of the basil flavor, garlic or anything else, Omg! Made me wonder how authentically Thai this restaurant is because the basil leaves were not stir fried with the other spices which is typically how restaurants make it. Instead it was dry fried (?).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-11-02", "description": "Disappointed....\nHad high hopes going knowing they had received a Michelin star. The whole experience was horrible. 1. The drinks were definitely on the lighter side and not as balanced as I liked. But that is personal taste. 2. The appetizer, meatballs. As part of the dish, there was additional chili sauce. One would think with additional chili sauce, the meat ball would be seasoned on the lighter side so the patron can adjust the spiciness to their liking. Instead, the meatballs were over spiced where it overpowered any other flavors. Second thing, a sticky rice was part of the meatball appetizer. The rice was cooked but definitely left out too long before serving as each rice kernel was dry and hard. Sticky rice should never be serve in that condition. 3. Pork belly. That was good. 4. Roasted whole Cod. Disaster. When portioning the fish, there was difficulty removing the meat from the bone. For anyone that has had bone in fish, that is the first sign that the fish was undercooked. The fish was taken back for additional cooking. Definitely appreciated someone coming to acknowledge there was an issue with the fish, but was flabbergasted when told that the difficulty of the cod fish meat coming off the bone was normal. Once the fish was returned, the fish was evidently much drier as they just threw the fish back into the oven and cooked further. That was the biggest disaster. 5. Papaya salad. Not sure if this was the order that the restaurant had intended for us to eat, so can't comment too much. But again with the seasoning. Bring it down a few notches. After 2 bites per group, no one could touch that dish as it was just way too spicy. 6. Jasmine rice. Same issue as sticky rice. Jasmine rice is suppose to be fluffy and not hard and dry. I've had spicy thai food, but always with good depth of flavor. The food here had no depth and no flavor but tons of spice. Thoroughly disappointed. Old Siam across the street probably had better food.", "author": "George S."}

I love me some fried chicken wangs anytime, but it was quite typical, it did come with a couple of special sauces. I liked the pork belly because it reminded me of a Chinese dish that my family used to order, it was comforting but a bit on the oily side (use the rice to soak up the extra sauce). The braised beef cheek curry was the most interesting out of the dishes we ordered - it was a larger portion. The most disappointing part of the meal was the dessert - this was recommended by the server but we did not like it at all. \n\nThe service was great and they kept coming back to check on us, another plus is that it's open late!", "author": "Tina F."}

I had seen this entry on Yelp! and decided to book on OpenTable since it was close to our hotel. I did not see the menu, and then had difficulty locating the restaurant when we went to find it. When my wife and daughter and I arrived, I was certain the menu could not accommodate our dietary restrictions (no pork or shellfish), and let my family know we were going to try some place else, and let the restaurant know we were going to release our reservation.\n\nWhile we proceeded to look for another venue on Yelp!, Pim came out herself and asked if they had done anything wrong. She was totally disarming, took us through the menu and offered to accommodate changes if needed.\n\nOur meal was superb. The waitstaff supported us all the way through...including to dessert, which we TOTALLY were not going to eat, however by that point we just HAD to cap the meal with the black rice pudding.\n\nBoth Pim and our server made recommendations, steering us away from ordering MORE food than we needed, and explaining how to eat the various offerings when brought to the table.\n\nFor three of us, we ordered 1 entree and three other plates. Mushroom Hor Mok was out of this world! My wife especially enjoyed the Yum Yai salad, which was done without the shrimp paste for us, and the Nam Tok beans were unbelievable--WHO can make lima beans taste like that? The Kaho Soi Tofu was also very good--the scallions, onions and chile brought extra spice to a dish that was already perfectly flavorful.\n\nLikely we could have been fine with one fewer small plate, but I wouldn't  have wanted to have missed out on ANY of what we did get.\n\nI am shocked by reviews of this restaurant on Yelp! that are below four stars.  Prices for food really were not at all extravagant for San Francisco standards, so I cannot understand people saying the food is overpriced. We paid less for dinner at Kin Khao tonight than we paid for breakfast today.  And I have read reviews of service that were sub-par, but find them hard to believe given our personal experience.\n\nI would recommend this restaurant to anyone, unless they do not like Asian cuisine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-23", "description": "Sadly, I'm writing off Kin-Khao as a go-to restaurant. They've always had some issues with consistency of food and service, many times brilliant, other things sour or pungent or salty (or forgetful, or absent) to the point of unpleasantness. After a number of visits I'd settled into a routine of enjoying the funky vibe and knowing which dishes were sublime (the mushroom terrine) and which are globs of cloying sauce (pretty spicy wings).\n\nOn the last visit, the usually-sublime massaman curry came out different. The color was different, the curry sauce was a different color, and the salt level was unpleasant, not quite inedible but well on the way. We mentioned it to the server, who promptly offered to have the dish re-fired. I asked if this was possible because the curry was what tasted so salty, but he assured me that the kitchen could cook it with less salt. The dish came back exactly as before. When we pointed this out the manager came out, insisted that the dish was always cooked this way, that nothing changed in the recipe, and that plenty of people enjoyed the dish but they would take it off our bill. My dining companion and I are not idiots, I've had this dish at least twice before, and it's not hard to tell when something is excessively salty. So it was basically a flip off. If this place wants to survive it's going to have to pay attention to the level of salt, fish sauce, and sriracha they add. When a kitchen starts oversalting things it is a bad sign that managers and owners ought to heed and not allow a defensive staff to deny.", "author": "Gil S."}

I had the noodles with pork cheek, which was very spicy with heavy beefy sauce, really very boring. But too spicy got me go eat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-01", "description": "The 2 stars reflect their service and our disappointment in their ability to make sure we were well taken care of. When we arrived, the table we sat at had very little to no lighting. My mother and her friend (who are both older ladies) had such a hard time reading the menu. We mentioned this issue to our hostess, but she just said \"sorry, this is how the boss likes to have the lighting, the darker the better.\" She didn't offer to bring out candles or anything else to help out. So I took out my cell phone to help them read the menu. \n\nWe had the Mushroom Terrine (our favorite) and the Fried Duck Egg (it's ok, not great) dishes for starters. Then we ordered the pork belly (pretty bomb) and the (stupendous) vegetable panang curry with a side of brown rice for the main courses. When we were done with the appetizers, our table sat empty for a long time. It was actually about 15 minutes or more before we decided to ask where our main courses were. To give you some reference so you don't think that I'm exaggerating, the couple at the table next to us got seated around the same time we finished our appetizers. Then moments later they received all of their orders. Yet we still haven't received our main courses. The server came back out and said \"sorry my ticket was already printed out awhile back but the chef hasn't fired the food yet.\" Which tells us that if we didn't even ask him about our food he would not have bothered to check the kitchen on our main courses. He then said \"I asked him to fire them up now and they should be out in 1-2 minutes\". This was not true, it took a while longer for the food to come out. But in between those moments, another server came by and offered us a small plate of pickled vegetables \"on the house\". I'm not sure if we're just being really Asians, but pickled vegetables are usually in a jar on the table for free at some Asian restaurants. It's not really considered an apology for forgetting our main courses.\n\nThen came the $23 Root Vegetable Panang Curry, it came in a medium-sized bowl that was only half-filled with curry soup and about 9-10 small pieces of cubed vegetables. That's it :(  I asked the server, so what makes this dish so special that it's worth $23? He said, \"the time it takes to hand-make everything, the curry paste is imported and that the ingredients are very expensive.\" \"Just so you know, we used to have a crab curry dish on the menu and charged $40 for it\" (as if that's supposed to make me feel any better). Oh, and he added, \"It's the price for eating here I guess.\" I told him that I really didn't feel like a half-filled bowl of watery curry with a small amount of cubed vegetables is justification for charging us $23. The Rabbit Green Curry was $27 and made sense because of the contents: rabbit leg & saddle, rabbit meatballs, apple eggplants... The Vegetable Panang Curry was good but not $23 good. It had nothing in it. The Pork Belly dish was in my opinion a much more valuable dish, yet that was only $15.\n\nHe said he's sorry that I feel this way and then came back to give us our bill.\nThe bill had no offer of a discount for the long wait on our food. He didn't show any concern when we were expressing unhappiness, no offer for anything at all to make us feel better. I am very disappointed with the way they just brushed us off.\n\nWe would not have visited this place if it weren't for the GQ article I came across and the Zagat piece mention.\n\nMy advice to others, definitely go try it, I think it's a cool experience. They had some really interesting cocktails, the Rasa Umami was pretty darn good. But definitely don't come here if you expect great food, great service and great value.

They were behind, fine.  Thirty minutes late, annoying but okay especially since the hostess, who sought us out, let us know the table was being cleared and would just be a couple more minutes.\n\nThen something I've NEVER experienced as a diner, they blatantly gave away our table to another party.

Why are you accepting walk-ins?\n\nTo sum up:\n- 8:15 Friday night reservation (there 10 minutes early)\n- Told at 8:45 our table was being set\n- 8:50 come to find our table had been given away, to people with NO RESERVATION\n- Get some free pickles, then sat down 15 minutes later\n\nMaybe recognize that Friday night is not an ideal time to accept walk-in guests? Maybe don't take away the table from a group that was literally told \"This is your table coming up\"?\n\nJust a shame because my wife and I noticed they got their Michelin Star and were a bit bummed because we were worried that it would become much busier and harder to get a reservation.

Not only is she witty and irreverent but she knows her Thai cuisine.  We went the first time for lunch and the service was impeccable, the drinks were very well thought out for non-alcoholic choices.  I had the turmeric lime soda and my husband had the blue flower limeade.  Lovely really.  Our entree's were bursting with unique but well paired flavors.  The stir-fried bok choy was simple and perfectly flavored with light soy and garlic.  I have never had beans that had this much flavor but the Nam Tok Beans with lime, chili, soy, shallots, scallions, mint and cilantro were addicting.  When we went back two days later I had them again for dinner since I was obsessed..I think I dreamt about them for sure.  My husband who is about the pickiest diner (more about service and taste than types of food) was blown away.  He is what I call a super taster and nothing gets by his palate.

It smelled like rice cooking and straight up fish sauce once I got to the elevators, and my nose led me down a winding hallway to the restaurant.  \n\nI would say it's a must-try, but perhaps not a regular spot.  It's definitely a flavorful experience.  \n\nThe table favorites were the fried duck salad (lots of flavor but wished it had actual \"roughage\" underneath the egg), the curry mousse in a jar, and especially the black rice pudding (a harmony of salty, sweet, sticky, chewy, crunchy).  The rice pudding was the only dessert, but we agreed it was so good that it could live up to that.  It was nice that there are 2 rice selections that are \"complimentary.\"  The crab noodles were not a stand-out, but they were well executed, the noodles were a perfect texture.  \n\nWe were full and it came out to be about $25 a person w/o drinks, not bad.", "author": "Mirba E."}

I'm talking pick-it-up-so-I-can-eat-at-my-desk quick. I got work to do before this 3-day weekend! I googled some nearby places, I peeked at a few saved restaurants list and I finally landed on Kin Khao. I'm a big fan of Pad Kee Mao and I saw a reviewer had rated it highly so I thought why the hell not. So I popped on over and normally I think they like takeout orders to be called in since they take call-in orders starting at 11 and serve at 11:30, but they had no problem since I arrived at 11:45 and there was only 1 table sitting down to eat. My food came out piping hot less than 10 minutes later, pretty damn quick. It was also delicious. I may have eaten it faster than it took to cook. The noodles were great, the pork was well done and the vegetables were julienne'd in a way that you could pick up a slice of bell pepper with each noodle instead of the normal lets-cut-this-tomato-into-4-pieces-and-throw-it-in dish. No, Oh-and-lets-do-the-same-with-the-bell-pepper, And zero, screw-cutting-the-basil. So, yes, this is one of the better Pad Kee Mao dishes in the city.\n\nMy only concern: this place should definitely have a $$$ rating instead of $$. I know Yelp says $11-$30, but if basic Pad Kee Mao is $18 for lunch what's there for $11? Their cheapest app? Meanwhile, Osha Thai (lesser quality) has the same dish for $12 and they are also $$. Logic/algorithm issue? Maybe, just something I noticed.", "author": "Justin H."}

I'm obsessed with the hor mok terrine and the dessert with coconut cream and caramel. My boyfriend and I tend to be debilitated by making decisions (especially when everything sounds so delicious) tried the family menu one night. The good news is that you get to try a whole range of dishes. The bad news is that the servings are very generous and you will be way too full at the end because you have no self control and now youngster yourself. While we've never ordered that menu again, we have returned to some of the dishes that we were able to try, like the caramelized pork belly, which is so sweet and fatty and crispy, I could eat it al day. They also change the menu up (I miss you pad see ew!!), but not too much, so you can't get into a rut ordering the exact same thing every time you go. I'll also just note that the dining room on the right side as you walk in can be deafening (opinion possibly skewed by a baby tearing up a drum solo on a metal rice pot the last time we were seated there), while the one on the left doesn't seem to reach the same noisy heights and is much more enjoyable for dinner.", "author": "Claire T."}

The various things we had were mostly way too explosively flavored (not in a pleasant way). Too much salt, too much garlic and very very spicy, in an overpowering way. The opposite extreme was the chicken fat rice. Bland and boring. Basically if you ever had a boiled chicken, that's what it tasted like. They also give you what I think is a side of the water the chicken was boiled in (they call it intense chicken consomm\u00e9). \n\nThe service is just awful. They brought out one entry and completely forgot about the other one. So we awkwardly waited and waited for the second dish to come out, while the first one got cold. When we asked them about the second dish, they said that the dishes come out as they are ready (or something along those lines). Ok.

My friend and I shared two dishes, and we got the Yaowaraj Noodles  for $19 and the Pretty Hot Wings for $12. The dinner menu at the top says food is served family style to share, but I don't know what kind of family they expect would get full off of the serving sizes they have. When we got the noodles, it was served on a small dish, and if I counted correctly, we probably got less than ten bites each of the noodles, and the noodles had no flavor besides being burnt. I could only taste how burnt they were, and I would have called a waiter to complain about the noodles, but there seemed to be no one available to assist and no one came over to check on us or our food. Secondly, the wings came out, and to our dismay, there were only 3 wings, yes 3 wings for 12 dollars. We ate them, and the first thing we said was \" too sour\" and proceeded to down our waters. It was not spicy at all for me and all I tasted was sourness, so the flavor for us was not there. They do give hot towels to wipe down your hands after you eat the wings, which was nice, but still doesn't make up for the experience we had there. After we got our check and left, I was still hungry and felt like I didn't eat anything, so we went to get food after. Come here if you want to spend money on small portions, unauthentic thai food and a disappointing dinner. However, I can't say anything about lunch, which I will try if I can muster up the willpower to eat here again and update here.", "author": "C H."}

To find the location of the restaurant took a bit of walking around the block since it is located in the Parc 55 hotel and the address takes up a whole block. The restaurant is located at the NW corner of the hotel block- on the SE corner of Mason and Ellis. What I really don't understand is the pricing. I don't see how $100 for one (least expensive) entree and two apps (no drinks) is considered a $$ restaurant. It was good, but you can eat way better Thai in this city for a fraction of that, but maybe not sustainable meats... I wonder if due to the Super Bowl crowds and the location inside the hotel if they raised prices. Despite SF being pricey at times $30 + entrees are not usually at \"two dollar sign\" restaurants and it was not worth it. I have slightly higher expectations for that price and would have been happy spending it elsewhere. What happens in SF is anyplace near downtown that is nicely decorated and ok food is way too expensive. Come out to the sunset and eat your myself will with authentic anything you want for $20. The bean dish with salad wraps was ok, lacked strong flavor, the XO noodles were also ok but nothing special. The green rabbit curry was quite good and had the perfect amount of hot heat without making you uncomfortable.

Also I would like to add this comment about their \"family style\" dinning. Why the hell do they call it family style, when the dishes served, come out one by one with a 7-10min delay?

No sweat. The restaurant wasn't overly busy and there were numerous empty tables so it didn't seem overly crowded. We arrived and there was a small line to speak with the hostess. She was working on a tablet managing tables and lists and was clearly struggling with her job. Before I could provide my information the hostess ran off. She came back, wouldn't acknowledge myself or anyone, and then walked off again seemingly confused holding the tablet. After a few minutes she finally comes back and takes down my information. I politely ask if there is an estimated time she can expect us to wait. She begins to fumble with her tablet, even more flustered than before and after 90 seconds or so, someone jumps the line shouting their name and saying he has a reservation. \n\nSHE DROPS WHAT SHE IS DOING AND LEAVES. Completely ignoring myself as well as several other people who had been in line in front of the rude gentleman. I'm peeved, but fine. After she seats them, she walks back over and I ask her again, how long, roughly, will it be before we can expect to be seated. Again she fumbles with her tablet and then AGAIN WALKS OFF. I'm vexed with this woman and people in line are getting noticeably angry. We decide to simply walk over to the bar to have a drink and wait for our table as we have been there for over 10 minutes by this point. \n\nTables remain empty, unfilled, on a Saturday night and she is not seating anyone quickly. We have drinks, the Bartender, Katie is polite, excellent and we are generally enjoying ourselves. The communal table has had 7 open spaces for roughly 15 minutes at one point so I politely ask the hostess if we can be seated there, she is angry and says there's other people on the list ahead of you. I ask if there is any update to how long we can expect before we can be seated SHE AGAIN WALKS AWAY!\n\nWe have now been at the restaurant for 45 minutes, SITTING AT THE BAR, where we could have ordered food... and there are still EMPTY TABLES that have been empty since we have been there. The hostess walks over and says your wait is going to be at least an hour.\n\nI lost it. When I pointed out that there are empty tables that have been empty she says those are reserved for 8:30. I hope managers realize they have a hostess costing them margin. I point out to her that I had REPEATEDLY asked her for the wait time and that she had continuously ignored me. Katie the bar tender actually felt bad for us and was a bit shocked by the whole episode. She invited us to eat the bar but we were all pretty pissed and ready to leave.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-29", "description": "The most disappointing food experience I've had in SF...\n\nMaybe it was the expectations or maybe it was the service, but this place landed well below anything we could have imagined.\n\nWe started with the som tum, which was the high point of the meal. Som tum is something we like a lot and we have tried quite a few. This ranks solidly in the middle of the pack. It lacks the savory note of the crab paste and was under seasoned in general. \n\nFrom here it just got more and more disappointing. \n\nThe chicken fat rice was something I had hopes for. The rice was flavorless with the only notion of chicken fat being the glistening greasy appearance. The chicken itself didn't seemed to be cooked properly. As I understand it, this is supposed to be the thai derivative of hainanese chicken; however, the texture of the chicken was WAAAAYYY off. The chicken itself had zero salt or any other flavor. It's supposed to be poached in a broth, ice shocked and then sliced. The dish we received had zero resemblance to the flavor and texture of the original. Every flavor we got on the plate seemed muted.\n\nAnd then began the wait... turns out the service didn't put in the order for our fried chicken and two sauces... This eventually became the absolute worst dish and worst fried chicken I've had in years. The skin was still soggy and crumby. Worse still.. coconut flakes or shreds in the skin had sogged up too and got stick in your teeth like little pieces of grass. Again... no detectable salt or brining in the meat. Perhaps it was the rush to bring us the chicken once they realized the problem, but a major misstep.\n\nA hostess was at least kind enough to come and ask about the meal. She finally sussed out that we were completely dissatisfied with the chicken rice and took off the dish from our bill, even after we told her we were good with paying for it all.\n\nOverall... just a disappointment.", "author": "Charlie H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-17", "description": "On a weekend when the partner was away, I came here with a big craving for chicken rice, the fatty, schmaltz rice that is oh so good when done well.  The SF weekly had an article saying that the version here was better than Hawker Fare's so I decided to give it a go.  \n\nAlthough I came for the chicken rice, it was the wings which were really outstanding. They were perfectly fried whole wings, with the tips and everything, and every bit of the skin was crisp, flaky and well seasoned.  The flesh inside was juicy and sizzling and wonderful.  To cap it all off, the wings were bathed in a novel sriracha sauce I had never encountered before, which was slightly spicy, but more tangy then anything.  Very good!  I could have that sriricha on anything.\n\nThe chicken rice itself was so-so, there wasn't much of a schmaltzy coating to it as I would have liked, nor did the chicken in the dish have much flavor or skin to increase the comfort food quotient of the dish.  However, the soup stock that came with the dish and the garlicky secret sauce that are on the side make it savory and satisying when poured on the dish.  Having had it, I don't think I'd have this particular dish again (I think the best chicken rice I've ever had came from Mission Chinese in the first year or so when it was open, though they have since changed the recipe and now call it schmaltz rice, but it tastes nothing as good as it once did), however, every other dish that I saw come out of the kitchen looked outstanding.  In particular, I've got to come back for their pork meatball and pork belly dishes, as well as the octopus, but in general, again, everything looked great!  \n\nIf you're alone, as I was, sit by the bar.  You get to see all of the dishes come out of the little kitchen and the bartenders are pretty entertaining.  The night I went, there was a brassy bartender working telling entertaining stories and who kindly provided me with warm towelettes when she saw the cro-mag man imitation I was doing with my chicken wings.  There is also quite possibly one of the handsomest bartenders in the city working there, a tall, trim, neatly bearded fellow, who to paraphrase one of my favorite authors, looks like a man whom women (or men) who have been best friends for decades would tear at each other like panthers for a chance to get with.  Damn.  Just saying.  \n\nThe place is a little hard to find.  It's in a corner of the Wyndham hotel, but it's not actually on Cyril Magnin as listed here, it's on the corner of the hotel at Ellis and Mason.  It wasn't too packed on a Sunday evening, but I would say in general to make reservations unless you are going to sit at the bar.  Prices are a little more than at most Thai restaurants, but not a whole lot more, and the quality is worth the extra few dollars.  Try it.", "author": "Jim M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-18", "description": "A 3.5 star experience really.  4 stars for food, taking a star off for other reasons below.\n\nJust got back from my first time dining here.  The menu is kept short and focuses on dishes that a) are likely chef strengths and b) dishes I love.  The menu might appear unusual to those that expect a hundred choices from Asian restaurant menus, but I certainly appreciated it.  I spent a year in Thailand, which I humbly believe gives me some good perspective on what dishes this place does well and what it can improve on.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the flavor profiles and spice balance are mostly well executed.  This is what Thai food is supposed to taste like.  I had the Khao Mun Gai and other colleagues of mine went for the Pad Kee Mao or Khao Soi.  All were quite good, but all were slightly off and have room for improvement.  The Khao Mun Gai sauce had an extra dash of soy that somehow managed to detract from the chili and ginger.  The chicken broth that accompanied the Khao Mun Gai was a bit too salty and oily.  The Pad Kee Mao lacked the appropriate amount of holy basil and heat.  The Khao Soi was the best dish of the three but also was missing something I couldn't put my finger on.  With all that said, these are probably the best renditions of these dishes I have had in San Francisco.  Good Som Tam.  On the flip side, the Thai Iced Tea was not done well and was too akin to a coffee taste (despite using the Number 1 tea brand, the most prevalent in Thailand).  This was a waste at $5 a glass.\n\nKudos for having the original Thai Sriracha sauce on every table.  Good atmosphere and decor, but very weird music selection (Jazz/Soul in a Thai restaurant?!?).  Contractors were in and out of the restaurant during the lunch hour and were sitting on one side of the restaurant for a business meeting with what I presumed to be Kin Khao staff.  \n\nService was appalling slow and inattentive (at least they got that part of the Thai culture right) and lunch took almost 90 minutes on a workday with a total of 6 seated tables in the restaurant.  There was no explanation of any of the dishes and no one asked how we enjoyed the food.  Maybe it was an off day, but the staff comes off as aloof and disinterested.  Also, how is it that the hostess, wait staff, and cooks (from who I saw) are NOT Thai?  I hate to compare this place to Osha, but at least they employ Thais.  \n\nThis place has the foundation to be a raging success, but they are trying way too hard to be cool and not hard enough to provide even mediocre service.", "author": "Matthew L."}

I think San Francisco has been accustomed to inexpensive, cookie-cutter Thai restaurants and trying to compare Kin Khao to the usual place would like comparing Manresa to Applebees.\n\nThe food is exquisite, well balanced and thoughtful, and extremely delicious, with hearty portions that are ideal to share.  \n\n   - Kua Kling Ribs:  spicy, tender and crusted with curry and spice.  I am a heat wimp but could not stop eating these, so hefty with meat and the kaffir lime filled my head in the most delightful way.\n\n  - Khun Yai's Green Curry with Rabbit:  rich, aromatic curry base with a half of a rabbit, quartered, rabbit meatballs and tender eggplant.  Mindblowingly good.  If you have never tried rabbit before or if you are like me and can't get enough rabbit this will spoil you forever.  I had some leftover and it was the best lunch the next day ever. \n\n  - Khao Mun Gai (chicken fat rice): If I could have this every day it would not be enough. The poached chicken was tender and so flavorful, the rice - toasted in chicken fat - was the perfect doneness and topped with the chili - fish sauce - peanut sauce was a heavenly bite, then a sip of the incredible chicken broth served on the side, I just about swooned in pleasure.  I would like to have jars and jars of that spicy sauce to put on everything.\n\n  - Crab Sen Chan:  These tangy rice noodles with a ton of fresh picked crab was one of my favorite dishes.  This is not Pad Thai.  The noodles were coated with the luscious crab fat and I really did not want to share this dish.\n\n  - Pork belly in a clay pot:  So tender and sweet, a large portion of sliced pork belly sitting in a puddle of it's own juices.  I ordered brown rice to eat with that and the nutty, perfectly cooked grains were a perfect foil.\n\n  - The rice pudding dessert was ridiculously good. the caramel sauce that accompanies this was so amazing we were fighting each other over spooning out the last drops.  The most comforting and yet elegant dessert.\n\n  - The cocktails are also fantastic and worthy of a visit alone.  The mint julep with the Thai basil was a revelation, why doesn't everyone add Thai basil??  The Tom Yum (not the soup) cocktail was perfectly balanced and quaffable.  The coconut based cocktail was the perfect antidote to the spicy curry ribs and is my new favorite cocktail.\n\n  - Ingredients:  The real authentic sriracha sauce is so fantastic, wish I could buy a bottle.  All of the ingredients are sourced from places where I buy for myself, and the quality shows in the dishes.  The fish sauce is incredible and really stands out in the dishes.  The herbs blow me away.\n\n  - The service was very attentive and thoughtful, the server was very accommodating to my deadly food allergies and I felt like I could relax and eat and not worry about my safety.  The cocktails came quickly and the staff were there when I needed them.  Pim has been there each time I dined and it was a joy to see her graciousness in making every guest feel welcome and tended to.  \n\nThis is a wonderful place and I am greatly enjoying my quest to eat everything on the menu.  The location is very convenient to me and is in a lively area off of Union Square.  It's the perfect place for a pre-theater dinner or apres-theater.  What a treasure to have such high caliber dining available in this part of town.", "author": "Heather H."}

But read on.\n\nThe first time I tried this, I had the gaeng som curry. It was not to my taste, more like a soup with an egg floating in it but I thought the quality was high.\n\nI ate there a couple of weeks ago. The menu was in brown ink on tinted paper and in an odd font that I found hard to read in the dimmed light. The names of the dishes were easy to read, but everything else I found a chore. This set things up for disappointment, as I'll relate later.\n\nI ordered my favorite Thai dish, khao soi, curry soup with chicken, egg noodles and crispy noodles, with condiments on the side. Delicious and well worth what they are charging for it. \n\nGot a side of the Chinese broccoli with XO sauce. This XO sauce is different from the XO sauce I get in Hong Kong places, and this is a Thai place, so I'd expect it to be different, and it as well was delicious if difficult to keep the sauce on the gailan.\n\nEnded with their one dessert, glutinous black rice, a fun dish served with crisped rice, salted coconut sauce, and a sweet sauce that you can add to taste. I used all of the rice and half on the sweet sauce.\n\nAside from the greeter who seemed mildly put out that I wanted to sit at a table and not the bar even though the place was starting to empty out, staff was friendly and helpful.\n\nThen came the check. On it, to my surprise, was a healthy SF surcharge. I went back to the menu and confirmed it was on there, in the hard-to-read font at somewhere around half the font size of the dish descriptions.\n\nOne star off for that. As I've posted in other reviews, if I miss it, it's almost as much of a deflation as if it wasn't there. I feel less gamed, but I still feel gamed. So I now have a bad association with Kin Khao and probably won't be back. If you're going to add a surcharge, do everything you can to make sure it's not a surprise. Put all notices in the same place at the bottom of the menu in a way that makes it hard to overlook, such as in a different, but not smaller, font. Oh, and put it on your website with the menu (not there as of the date of this review).\n\nVegetarian friendly. Although there are a couple apparently vegan dishes, I couldn't see being able to put together a satisfying vegan meal here.", "author": "Charles B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-08", "description": "We didn't have a reservation, but were able to be seated with others at the \"community table\".  First thing we noticed it's a pretty noisy and hectic-seeming place in a small space with relatively low ceilings.  Most Thai places are quieter and have a mellower vibe.\n\nYes, it's a bit hard to find -- especially if you just go by Google Maps, since the location marker is at the lower entrance of the Parc 55 Hotel.\n\nThey suggest you share everything \"family style\", and so we got the papaya and smoked eggplant salads as well as an order of the green curry with rabbit over brown rice.\n\nThe papaya salad came out first.  It was on the small side -- which is OK -- but quite a bit saltier/fishier tasting than we would have liked.  This, we think, was either mostly or wholly due to liberal inclusion of dried shrimp bits.  The smoky eggplant salad was also on the small side, with good smoky flavor on the eggplant and garnished with what looked and tasted like it might have been thin crispy-fried onion shavings.\n\nAlthough we liked the eggplant salad better, neither lived up to our hopes & expectations based on the NYT write-up.\n\nThen there was a big lull.  Eventually we caught the attention of another waiter (not ours) who must have noticed us hungrily looking around the room for our waiter.  He asked if we were awaiting more food, and we said, YES ... we need our rabbit curry, and gestured to the lonely pot of brown rice that was well on its way to getting cold.\n\nWhen the rabbit curry finally showed up, it was good, but still not WOW good.  The rabbit was fall off the bone tender (it was still partially on the bone) and very moist.  The green curry it was swimming in, however, was very smooth and yummy, but lacked a certain zing or kick ... and I found adding some of the bottled red \"heat\" (imitation siracha sauce?) on the table improved it significantly. \n\nOverall, with the high expectations we had going in based on the NYT story, and the prices, it was a bit disappointing / underwhelming, and I don't think we'll make any particular effort to return with so many other great places around.", "author": "Adrian B."}

Hoh Mok is ok but I prefer to eat it with jasmine rice better than crispy rice. Kua Kling is diffent. I think, they suppose to use cumin to cook through that but it looks like Prik Khing in Thai cooking style. The price is definitely higher than other Thai restaurants.

First- we had a reservation and still had to wait 15 minutes, not ideal especially at 9pm.  My date got a pork noodles dish which had tons of very fatty meat and not-so-flavorful broth (maybe this is unfair due to it being compared to the amazing green curry I had ordered).

We liked everything we had but those were really the standouts! Service was excellent and attentive - I have a shellfish allergy and eating Thai can be difficult but the wait staff were so great about flagging when a dish brought to our table contained shellfish. Plus our server made the perfect cocktail recommendation based off of the flavors I told her I wanted. All in all an excellent experience and hopefully the next time we're in town we'll be back!", "author": "Chitra P."}

The following are some of my highlights.\n\nRabbit green curry - Best green curry I've ever had. It's perfect. The meat is fall off the bone tender, flavor was not too sweet or salty. Very balanced.  \n\nYum Kai Dao - This dish was so satisfying. The egg has runny egg yolk and crispy egg white. It's spicy with chilis mixed in with greens. A great starter. \n\nI also had Chicken Rice, Sausage, Crab noodle, chinese brocolli with xo sauce and so many more goodies. There wasn't one dish I didn't love.  \n\nEveryone is really kind and friendly here.

So I can't comment on anything else. The menu is simple at lunchtime. Short but still with a good range. I surreptitiously watched what was going out to other tables and rapidly settled on the Khao Soi Gai based mostly on smell, which was wonderful. We also ordered a simple Som Tum Papaya Salad to start with something refreshing. The salad was actually a highlight. I've always thought the secret to a dish like this is balancing the sour and salty and spicy and sweet and this was perfect, absolutely perfect.\n\nOn to the main event. The soup is served as described with noodles, broth, chicken and on the side some thinly sliced shallot, pickles and chili oil. Never one to shy away from the heat, I added some of all three. They were all great additions, but special mention must go to the pickles which were a superb contrast and delicious in their own right. Our server warned us that the soup might grow in heat but actually I found it  very well balanced. The chili oil I added packed an initial punch and it led for me to the broth remaining very balanced. The flavor was superb and matched the aroma that had attracted me in the first place.\n\nOverall, very highly recommended. The food was delicious. The service let us do what we wanted which was talk shop for nearly two hours. It is a little pricey but I thought it delivered all the same. Next time I'll come for dinner to try the rabbit which sounds fantastic.", "author": "Owen L."}

But once you find it, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how accommodating and friendly the staff is and how cozy (in a kitschy way) this new spot is.\n\nI feel like Thai restaurants in America veer towards the overly sweet or fried route. At KK, The dishes are savory and hearty in a refreshing way-it actually feels like they've taken the time to prepare (braise, season) each item. The herbs (kaffir lime, turmeric) perfectly punctuate stand-out dishes such as the Kua Kling ribs and the pork sausage. \n\nI think the one dish that gets me coming back is definitely the Massaman curry. It's super flavorful and tender and I've never tried anything like it before! It's an offbeat take on comfort food.\n\nLove the cocktails as well-it's a team from Trick Dog so you know they're decent.

The menu is more limited for lunch so I can't comment on the full menu. I enjoyed my meal here and found it to be quite clean and comforting although nothing really blew my mind. The Nam tok beans were a salty, satisfying surprise with the sticky rice (though a tad too salty) and the Khao soi was solid (flavorful broth, moist chicken, you could adjust the seasonings to taste). The khao mun gai was not what I was expecting at all based on the description of being chicken fat fried rice. It was poached chicken presented with a side of white rice (subtle for being cooked in fat; it was basically shiny, more defined rice vs clumpy) and then it came with a concentrated ginger sauce for the chicken and an intense broth that was supposed to be a palate cleanser as you ate the chicken. This dish felt nice and nostalgic for me like a variation of something my mother/relatives used to make. So I liked it but ultimately I felt like it was something that could be easily replicated or experienced although it was a very different dish than what I might normally order at a Thai restaurant.

Just because the owner is GF of famous Michelin ** chef does not give her cred for authentic Thai food.  I've been to Bangkok and far reaches of Thailand and experienced some real strange and wild food but this place does not even serve simple good Thai food.  Two items recommended are based on Chinese food in the Blistered Green Beans and the Khao Mun Gai (really bad version of Hainan Chicken Rice).  The beans were boiled and then seared in a wok with burn marks hardly makes them blistered and I never had XO sauce (from HK) in Thailand except at a Chinese restaurant there.  The chicken was dry and devoid of flavor and frankly none of the dishes showed any of the wok-smoke flavor as I think the chef is not Asian and does not understand how a wok can glaze a dish without tons of oil.  The wings tastes like Siracha bathed Buffalo Wings and the Pork Bowl was greasy and fatty.  All the wok dishes lacked cooking technique...for God sake's, it is not just round and concave vessel for a reason so lots of the dishes lack the Asian flavors one gets from a very hot wok.

The rabbit curry was very rich and decadent, not very spicy, but really rabbity. In a good way. The riblets were very hot and very tasty, not just fiery. The pork broth with noodles - delicious. The cocktails were creative and very successful. I'd recommend the Tom Yum and the something something beach thing, which was kind of like a pina colada but more sophisticated.

Then the waiter assured us that the dishes should be shared family style.  For five people we ordered 5 entrees and an appetizer and rice.  As the dishes started arriving, they were clearly not sharable.... biggest disappointment was the the Pad Thai noodles which arrived with two shrimp and about half a cup of noodles.  The pork belly had about 4 pieces of meat with nothing to accompany it.  And so it went.  Since I had invited the group, I virtually ate nothing so my guests would get enough to eat.

We have been in San Francisco for 5 days and were beginning to assume that it was impossible to have a poor dining experience in this city.  On our last night in the city, this assumption was corrected.  Don't waste your time in a city of beautiful hospitality on a disappointing place like Kin Khao.", "author": "Mary J."}

Unlike a few reviews that suggest service was poor and/or the hostess was rude, that we most certainly did not experience. We found the team to be polite and the service to be spot-on. The meatball appetizer was good - juicy, fried and tasty. The Youwaraj noodles were okay - not too special although the flavor was above average - I though the chicken portion for the noodles was a bit stingy and it was definitely way too oily and greasy for me. The raw + tempura battered veggies were also just okay - didn't really experience anything out of the ordinary. Finally the beef-cheek curry which I would describe to be a deep-rich and flavorful option. I didn't think the quality of the beef was the best - it's gelatinous like you'd expect, but seemed to be very fatty for my taste. I have to say that at $27 dollars for the curry it was way over-priced. We could not finish the curry and noodles because of how rich and oliy the combination was for us. Overall I think it's 3 stars for me and not worth the quality and price to return - with the food mentioned above + 2 glasses of wine and 2 cocktails, our tab was $83 pp which is extra-ordinarily high for Thai food. I just hope they don't \"rest on their laurels\" because of all the fanfare they receive from critics and others' alike", "author": "Anon Y."}

We were excited about organic produce in Thai food and went there with open mind, ordering more than $150 worth of Thai food for three people, and we could not eat any of it.  Fortunately, the rice was free so it was the most expensive bowl of rice.  To be polite we took a doggy bag but ended up giving it to a homeless person.  The hormok was salty and fatty without much mushroom.  The rice crispy to dip the hormok was not crispy at all and slightly chewy as if it was not fried in a fresh oil or it has been sitting out for few days. The musamarn curry was very rich and the meat was tough and did not taste fresh.   The ribs were very dry.  they were supposed to be crispy but they tasted overly salted and double cooked, almost like they were cooked twice because they did not sell the night before.  The chicken wings were large and extremely salty and sweet which you cannot taste the meat.  For someone who claims to be \"foodie\", and to serve food that you cannot taste the supposedly organic, excellent quality produce because they were overcooked and drowned in extremely salty and sweet sauce is disappointing.  The owner became defensive when my constructive feedback was negative and became very defensive, implying that I did not know how the food should taste.  Honestly, I would really love to have Thai food with organic and sustainable products, but Kin Khao is not it.  Go to Kin Khao if you want to pay big $$$ and meet celebrity food blogger but for real Thai food, go to Marnee Thai, Jitlada, or Sweet Lime.", "author": "Yaw E."}
