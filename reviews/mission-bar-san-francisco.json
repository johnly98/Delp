[This would be an odd story if the DYL was elsewhere, and I ended up reviewing this bar. Not that I haven't done similar things in the past. I just recognize that they're odd.] \n\nUsually, I'm totally cool with dive bars. Hell, at the bars in my hometown that I grew up drinking in, Bacardi was considered top shelf. I was at a bar two months ago where the bartender confessed that, in two years of working there, she'd never made a martini before. THAT'S a dive bar. There was, however, just something about this dive bar that I didn't like. I'm a Mission resident, and even I don't like the stretch of Mission that the bar sits on. The bar is narrow, dark, noisy, the bathroom walls appear to be on the verge of achieving sentience (you'll know when they do, because they'll start screaming). \n\nThe drinks were cheap, and relatively strong. The pool table in the back runs true, and the cues were straight. If you don't believe me, you can ask the fellas my partner and I shellacked in a game of 8 ball. \n\nOverall, my impression was basically that I can think of a half-dozen bars in a 4-block radius that are as cheap (or close), cleaner (by far), and nicer in general.

The place was packed with more than a hundred people who were Tom's friends from one of the local Meet Up groups. This is a classic dive bar and the first I've been to in a long time. The environment was dark with a vertical layout that had small tables stacked on one side of the wall facing the bar and a good looking pool table in the very back. After being stuck in LAX with a prolonged flight delay, I managed to grab a chicken shawarma sandwich from the deli next door to complement a huge glass of hefeweizen followed by Tom's recommendation, anchor steam. The quality of the hefeweizen wasn't the best I've had, but the anchor steam was quite good. In addition to the friendly crowd, each glass was less than $3.00 and I had a wonderful time catching up with Tom and getting to know his friends. Although the line to play pool got really overwhelming in the end, the proximity to the 24th BART Station and extent that people were so friendly and approachable made the entire experience worthwhile. To add to the experience, the bartenders were laid back, friendly and very quick to respond. There was someone who brought her cute dog so it was nice to have her companion as well.

Drinks are absolutely affordable. There's a pool table. Some scruffy booths. Scuffed floor. Red walls. A decent jukebox.\n\nAll that is irrelevant, however, once people show up.\n\nThe crowd is what most immediately defines the Mission Bar. Located as it is --- right on Mission Street itself, within spitting distance of the 24th Street BART --- it seems to have no regular clientele of its own, simply whatever mass of beery bar-hoppers happens to be there when you arrive. This means you may have to fight off suburban jerkoffs drowning in perfume/cologne and clad in the latest mall fashion wack-cessories. Or maybe everyone will be sporting intentionally lopsided bangs and hipster-wave retro clothes from the Flashdance collection of 1983. Or, hell, maybe it will even be empty and quiet and you'll stare into your beer fizz and think, \"Hey, I bet this place would be pretty cool if there were, y'know, anyone here.\"\n\nThat's the fate of the Mission Bar in the year 2007.

We stopped in to meet up with friends and enjoyed the low-lit dive feel that the bar gave off.  The booths are great, but there's a limited number and were all full (and stayed full) while we were there.\n\nThe beers are cheap - $3.50 for Anchor Steam - and the bartenders are nice.  Not super friendly, but nice and there when you need them. \n\nWe were excited about the pool table in the back, but there were some real wing-nuts who guarded the table with their lives and wouldn't let anyone else play. But that's nothing against the bar - just the annoying people who happen to be there the same night as us.\n\nOne thing that's too bad is that there isn't a patio to step outside.  Personally, I like my beer accompanied with a cig or two.  You can always step out front, but what's the fun in that if your beer is still inside?", "author": "Amy J."}

We went big most of the time - drinks were cheap and strong, you could usually get a table, etc. etc. Then, over time, we realized that while Walter the bouncer recognized us and made small talk, the owner (I forget her name) always acted like she'd never seen us before. We thought that was a little weird, and too cold. I mean... we might not be the coolest group of friends you've ever seen, but we always tip well and for christ's sake! we were there multiple times a week for months on end. \n\nEventually, the thrill wore off and we headed to greener pastures. Still, it was good while it lasted.", "author": "Jen B."}

I am bestowing five delicious stars on this fine tippling establishment based on the sheer awesomeness of their Tuesday night special. FREE POOL & $1 PINTS OF PABST. Do the math, friends. You will have a shitty Wednesday, guaranteed. Beyond this nut-tingling deal, there are many other fine points of distinction to be made. The jukebox is top-notch. Appetite for Destruction, Surfer Rosa, Paranoid - all of these albums and more are collected in one device for your listening pleasure. There is ample seating throughout, and the bar itself is pleasingly long and easy to lean against. The pool situation is of an admirable quality - unless you are prone to blaming the table/cues for missed shots (Santos!) you should be relatively content. Apparently there is a secret little room in the back where unspeakably awesome things happen. I haven't been in it. So in summation: go to this bar on Tuesday nights.", "author": "Max H."}

I told him I had some family function that night and I was not some wannabe at the bar trying to steal his girl (I was by the way). So he proceeded to say something else smart then the I Irish Catholic in me kicked in and I got in his face. He attempted something that was supposed to be a shove and when I shoved him on his ass I think that he got the pic that I outweighed him by at least twenty pounds and I could pound him into submission and sell it to Kink.com\n\nBut you got love a bar where you go to all the time and some punk tries to get in your face cause you look like you don't belong.

The owner Laura is awesome and super laid back.  They have a random but amazing jukebox...ranging from Johnny Cash to Prince to the Humpty Dance.  My favorite go-to place for neighborhood drinks.", "author": "Dolores Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-30", "description": "This place is just what it says...  BAR.  That's why I think I'm kinda in love!  Fun and skilled bartenders.  Good tunes.  Always a seat available.  Just the right amount of grime, without a thick stentch in the air.  Entertaining every time...  there's always some local from the block doing something crazy or silly in a drunken stupor, making you feel less drunk that you thought you were...  but as soon as you leave and get back to your own reality you realize how great your strong and affordable cocktails were...  stumble, stumble, slur, cab pulls up and you pour yourself into it...  mission accomplished!", "author": "Erica S."}

I'd never really considered going there (not sure why), even though I live close by, but some friends suggested we go.  It was a Wednesday night, and there were 4 people there, including the bartender.  So, I can't say much about the crowd.  But, it seemed like a good layout, and the pool was fun, and the beer was cold.", "author": "Chadwick W."}

I paid just $3.25 for a Maker's on the rocks at 7pm, and in the soak-the-hipsters Mission, that is a beautiful thing. (Okay, it went up to $5 after 8pm, but I can still live with that.) Also, the bartender had really fine tattoos. And I got to hang out with some fine friends, and then stagger down the street to El Farolito for a burrito to soak it all up. If this place was closer to where I live, I would make it my local.", "author": "Fawn F."}

Time doesnt exist here. Got drunk with the bar keep and a good buddy, first and last time i had wild turkey.

During baseball season they have the Giant's game on and the bartenders get into it.  They have cheap beer, a pretty good jukebox, nice bartenders. It used to be nicely crowded on the weekends, now it can get a bit intense.  I went there last night in search of good cheap beer and pool and...FOUND IT! Even parted with a dollar for the jukebox I was so happy.", "author": "rachel h."}

Smoking not allowed (unlike many dives in this part of the mission)  Great staff, love me some laura and walter.  No lame ass uberhipsters, if your looking for uberhipsters and want to observe them in there natarual habitat go to the phonebooth on South Van Ness and 25th.  The space is pretty large and while busy on weekends its always comfortable.", "author": "Jimmy M."}
