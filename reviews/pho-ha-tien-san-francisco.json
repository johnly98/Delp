This dish is a rare find in SF and it definitely hits the spot.\n\nBun Bo Hue\nThe bbh broth here leans a tad more clear than most places and while it's not as flavorful as one would like it to be, it's a surprisingly refreshing alternative to the better known version.\n\nFor the most part, I like everything that I've tried from here, which is actually quite a lot considering I've been in this neighborhood for most of my life.

Haven't been here in over a year due to the declining quality of the food and service overall.\n\nCame here today with my boyfriend and his father because they were hungry. We ordered a small combination pho, bun rein and an XL combination pho with apparently extra \"PROTEIN\" (aka; two dead flies floating back up in the broth).\n\nIt was found in my boyfriends XL combination pho after he had basically finished the entire thing which was super funny/disgusting considering that he had finished it not knowing there was some nasty ass flies in his food but also it was definitely a health concern. Assuming that the flies were found in the broth, it must have been dead for awhile in the pot of broth that's still being used for making other noodle soups. Just thinking about that again is making me sick. When we reported to the Owner (bald headed guy) he didn't look like he gave a crap. All he said was \" do you want a new one?\" Me: no it's fine really ( I mean like why would I want another bowl knowing that there might be more bugs or what not inside of it). He responds with a rude attitude and without even fully acknowledging that there was anything wrong with flies in his food with \" fine, we'll take that pho off the bill\" and just left. Like come on! This is a REAL HEALTH CONCERN!\n\nI mean I understand that a lot of restaurants are not up to health standards and it shouldn't be a surprise that there might be bugs or stuff occasionally that lands in the food but TWO FLIES in one bowl??? There is something seriously wrong with the cleanliness of this restaurant.\n\nPersonally, the overall quality and service of this place has really gone down hill.

We were given menus and tea pretty much as soon as we were seated, which is always nice.\n\nI ordered the bun bo hue and it was passable. It's not as flavorful as I'd like, and the pieces of meat were roughly cut. It's also not as spicy as other BBHs I've had, but I guess that's what hot sauce is for. The one plus is that it's a HUGE bowl (mainly noodles though), and you could definitely share between two people if you wanted. I also shared an order of beef carpaccio with the bf, and it was good. The meat was nice and thin, but a little warmer than I'd like. When I eat warm carpaccio, it just doesn't sit right with me. I think they could've put a bit more of the toppings as well, but that may be personal preference. HUGE PLUS is that the carpaccio is so cheap compared to most pho places! I believe it was $9.\n\nTwo of my friends ordered the beef stew soup with egg noodles, which they loved and is their regular order. One of my friends has the seafood noodle soup, and it was such a sad bowl of noodles.

There were about 15 tables and they had the TV on (basketball game). After looking at the menu our orders were taken in a timely manner. Tea and water were served shortly after. Our table had not been restocked with chopsticks or soup spoons but we simply asked for them along with forks and spoons. \n\nAs a person who has had experience with Vietnamese food, I can say that the Banh Xeo did not disappoint. Plenty of fresh veggies (romain lettuce, cucumbers, mint leaves) and the fish sauce wasn't too overbearing.

I wouldn't say I'm a pho expert, but if you like a flavorful soup, then I really don't see how you can go wrong here.\n\nMy boyfriend had the traditional combo beef pho (in the extra large size....wasn't necessary to get this big of a serving...) while I had a small size of both the pho ga (i.e. chicken noodle soup) and the sate beef pho.  \n\nI was completely obsessed with everything we had but ESPECIALLY the sate beef pho.  The combo beef pho had tons of flavor and was on par with any other traditional pho I've had previously.  The pho ga was awesome and much more flavorful than my previous favorite pho ga at Joy Hing Bar-B-Que Noodle (which, in turn, is meant to be better than Turtle Tower - but I haven't had Turtle Tower to say for sure).  The sate beef is just \"wow.\"  The broth is a little spicy and a little sweet, with a heavy dose of coconut milk, and then with the rare beef and crushed peanuts mixed in - it's just heaven.\n\nWe also had the BBQ pork rolls (not fried; served cold in rice paper), and with the addition of the spicy chili garlic sauce on the table, I really enjoyed these.\n\nSodas are self-serve (fun!) and hot tea is free.

The lady just pointed at a random table for us to sit in. Another lady literally just threw the menus on the table.. um okay? Everything else went well until it was time to pay. We asked for the check and they forgot about us, mind you it wasn't even busy at all. They just kept washing random dishes and played with their kids at the front tables. When we finally had our bill, the lady kept asking \"are you ready, are you ready?!\" Bitch does it look like we are ready? My friend had her card on the table and when I was still trying to pull out my cash the lady tried taking away the bill and I HAD TO rudely tell her, WE ARE NOT READY.

Beef balls tasted low quality and the mints weren't even fresh. They had black spots on them. Mind as well do themselves a favor and not serve the herbs at all if they are that old. I tried to pay by card and they wouldn't accept my money because they have a $15 minimum charge and I didn't have cash on me late at night for safety reasons. The dude keeps telling me to go to target to get cash. Why do I go to target to get cash for is he dumb? I told him that the bank i use is actually near by and if they would give me a few minutes i would be back. The older gentlemen said I would need to leave my ID before I leave. They both at that point treated me like a criminal or a suspect under interrogation. Keep in mind that their cost of goods sold is only about $3-4. To dodge taxes they would rather take cash to avoid the 2.9% transaction fee. No matter what the minimum charge on debit cards are, the fee is still 2.9%. Now the bill was about 10 dollars so that would make their fee like 29 cents. They basically treaty their customers like criminals and caused a fuss over 29 pennies. Well... ain't that pity....

SUPER SKETCHY. Why did it come out so fast!? Is the chicken pre-cooked?? Probably. The portions on the rice plate were so skimp.

They never answer their phone either. Often times times at night they're cleaning up and putting chairs on tables and mopping the floor around you while you're eating your dinner even tho there's still 15-20 minutes left before official closing time. And of course they give you the check way before you're done eating. Yet judging from the numerous similar complaints from other Yelp reviewers over the years they don't seem to care about improving. Guess they get enough regular business with their cheap food that they've accepted complacency. They're also pretty cheap like charging extra just for some extra soup to add to the often dry (but tasty) beef stew noodle soup which is what I often order.

We sat next to an awkward couple and another guy waiting for his to go order.\n\nI saw an empty table and requested to be seated there and instead the server gave the seat to the couple next to us.  It was understandable because they came in first, but then again they didn't request it *shrugs*.\n\nSo they got the table.  No big deal.  15 minutes later the server comes and ask the guy who is waiting for his to go order if he wanted tea and he had to point out to her that we were the actual patrons waiting for our order to be taken.  She leaves the tea at our table and walks off.\n\nI looked around only to find that she had seated someone else at a small table and had already taken her order.  I had to stare down at the staff for them to realize that our order had not be taken.  Instead of having our order taken we were asked to move to a smaller table.  By this time I was irked....the pho better be DAMN good.\n\nI stared intently again at the staff and they finally decided to come over and take our order.  \n\nWe ordered two # 2's, one small and one large.  I stared around again they fed everyone else before and after us.  They obviously forgot our order.  The bowls finally arrived and I was shocked.\n\nI thought to myself....\"this is a combo right????\" There was no tendon, barely a full strand of tripe, and a few scraps of meat.  I am never the type to finish my pho and i finished this bowl.  I didn't finish it because it was DAMN good, but I finished it because they hardly gave me any food!\n\nNow to the flavor.....msg water.....only hot sauce semi-salvaged it.  I left a pho restaurant hungry.....that should never ever happen to anyone!\n\nThe crowd are just the regulars that live there.

I'm not someone who needs a lot of explanation about Vietnamese food. So, I really just care about the food being timely and the waitstaff being friendly, which was all true.

I just cross my fingers hoping I get a \"good batch\" made by the \"good chef\" with thin skin and lots of meat filling every time I order it. However, one component of the banh cuon is consistent, and that's their flavorful pork filling - which is what primarily keeps me coming back.\n\nOtherwise, everything in my old review holds true.", "author": "Christina C."}

All their vietnamese stuff is on the slightly above average scale. Mind you, I'm being generous here. Their broth has long since been watered down, I know they freeze half their stuff, and if it weren't for the fact they're the closest halfway decent pho place around, I wouldn't come here.\n\nTheir derivatives of american cuisine are terrible however.  Friend ordered a pork and shrimp crepe last night, since he is a major fan of them.\n\nWhat we got gave us the immediate impression it came out of the deep fat fryer because it was literally dripping in grease. We asked the shift manager at the time if it was deep fried, but he corrected us that it was pan fried! \n\nThe inside was horrible. A mess of onions and bamboo shoots, with a light scattering of pork bits and and some of the toughest shrimp we've ever tried chewing. To top it all off, it was bland beyond bland. We called the manager over again and he defended himself by saying that it was 'how it was supposed to taste', that the filling was not seasoned whatsoever, that it was meant to be eaten with the fish sauce and vegetables on the side. \n\nWe could not send it back as it seemed, so I paid for us and my friend said that he would never come back.

Had the craving for some Vietnamese and after driving on Ocean Avenue we stumbled on this place. Although on the menu they do offer several versions of roasted crab, we only got the pho.\nThe pho was ok, nothing much to brag about. The garlic noodles are heavy on the garlic flavor, maybe too much garlic powder? Lol! We left with our tummies full but later experienced reactions from ingesting too much msg. For those that have reactions to msg (mono sodium glutamate), beware of this place as their soup stock is heavily dosed.", "author": "Mark M."}

They basically don't offer deliver service, please fix your yelp info and stop misleading your customers! \n\nThe broth is water-downed, so we had to ask for extra spice & extra spicy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-28", "description": "I used to come to this place occasionally for their vietnamese sandwiches and dry vermicelli dishes whenever i was in the neighborhood. Back then it didn't disappoint and was fairly priced.The service was average but the food portion was decent and there was always a crowd of people eating there. \nSurprisingly, after 5 years of not coming to this place, I decided to give it a try again since I was in the neighborhood. OMG it has gone super downhill from what I remembered and I'm so sad to write this review but it must be said.\n\nFood: I ordered the pho ga and my boyfriend ordered the bbq pork vermicelli dish with  eggrolls. We also orderd a combination pork sandwich.\nFirst of all, the pho ga said it comes with a variety of \"fresh\" vegetables on the side. All it came with was a pile of old bean sprouts, some old cilantro and a lime wedge that was dried out. Where is the mint and other aromatic herbs??? When my pho ga came out the first thing that came to mind was the pho ga I had from Yummy Yummy. I was envisioning a sweet chicken broth with ample amounts of shredded chicken and chewy noodles with some thinly sliced onions floating at the top. What I got from Pho Ha Tien was SUPER watered down broth that was really oily. The shredded chicken pieces looked like scraps of unwanted chicken,not to mention it was so skimpy. The noodles were all clumped together and seemed undercooked. I was so disappointed because for $1.00 more I could have had something way better at Yummy Yummy.\nMy boyfriend's vermicelli dish was also disappointing. First off, the portion was small and most of the bowl consisted of vermicelli noodles. He said the few bbq pork pieces he got had no bbq flavor and tasted a bit sour. The egg rolls were super oily, so much that he had to dab it with a napkin and I didn't see much herbs & vegetables underneath the noodles.My boyfriend isn't a picky eater but he took a few bites and pushed the bowl aside. He moved on to the vietnamese sandwich, and boy, was that a disappointment as well.\nI remembered raving about these sandwiches 5 years ago. Now all I can say about it is skimp, skimp, skimp. There isn't any sort of combination in that sandwich. If you go to Dinosaurs and order a combination pork sandwich, you'll get a real combination pork sandwich for $1.00 more. This place had 2 types of meat for the combination but only gave 1 slice of each meat. Even sadder was I got the ends of one of the meat so it wasn't even a real slice.They also skimped on the veggies. The only thing they didn't skimp on was the mayonnaise, which was oozing out the sandwich. \n\nService: When we arrived, we were not greeted by a waiter and we chose our own seats after standing around for a bit. After we sat down, a waiter came with the menus, placed it down and walked away. Weird...but didn't phase me much since most Asian restaurants are known for shitty service. We waited a while for the waiter to take our order but he was doing other things so another waiter came to take our order. Within 5 minutes of taking our order, three waiters come out with all our food. Holy moley that was really fast! Did they pre-cook everything ahead of time? \nAfter we finished eating for a while I tried to flag down our original waiter to get the check. He walked swiftly by us a few times and didn't give us eye contact so I had to verbally call him out when he was a few tables away to get the check. A woman came with the check and it totaled out to be $21.15. I put down $25.15 hoping to get back change and tip them $2.00 for their mediocre food and shitty service. When the woman came back to pick up the check, she looked at it, said thank you and walked away. We sat there for 5 minutes waiting for the change to come back but it never did. I was so shocked...why in the world would I tip you 20% for that food and service? You must be crazy to think it was worth even 10% tip. We walked away and vowed to never go back to this place...horrible.", "author": "Suzanne L."}

But Pho Ha Tien can't deliver miracles.\n\nMy cousin Griselda D. hooked me onto this place years ago. We used to frequent the nail shop and the hoochie Brazilian clothing store across the street, so we decided to stop in. I've only had three dishes at this place:\n\n- Garlic noodles ($6.45): Personally, I love when my garlic noodles are slathered in minced garlic. I LOVE garlic. They're actually comparable to Thanh Long's garlic noodles only theirs have too much butter. \n- Pho ($6.70): I get the #2 combo noodle soup (beef brisket, tendon, tripe, beef balls). I like that the beef comes rare so that it's cooked in the broth. The broth isn't too salty. Portions, as in most Pho places, are huge.\n- Curry chicken ($6.50) : Too much sauce. The curry was a bit too overwhelming for my taste. \n\nService: Don't expect much here -just the basics. They bring your food and then pretty much forget about you. But that's typical, so I don't expect much. I get take-out most of the time, anyhow.\n\nParking sucks. Don't even attempt to block the neighbor's driveway next to the restaurant, even for a second. They watch you like hawks and will have the tow truck on you before you know it.\n\nOverall, this would definitely be classified as a hole-in-the-wall.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-15", "description": "I came here on Monday since I've been having huge pho cravings for a while. I normally don't like coming here because it's usually a) very crowded and b) kind of overpriced, but, it was super convenient that day.\n\nWe had a party of six people, and it was so packed that there was a small line forming. It was also kind of hectic, trying to get to six people seated. Luckily, there was a four person table, and the table directly next to it (literally, there was no space of anything) was a table of two. Since two of our party didn't come yet, the four of us sat down, waited for the table next to us to leave, and then the other two in our party arrived. \n\nWe already ordered before they came. I ended up getting the one I always get at any pho place: #1. It's normally #1 in pho places, and it's normally a combination of beef balls, tripe, flank steak, and some other beef-related meats with noodles. This also only comes in XL size. Someone else ordered the same thing, Bun Bo Hue, Fried Fish Cakes, and the Charbroiled Pork and Egg Roll vermicelli (#28) dish. Everything ordered was a large except for the fish cakes and the #1s.\n\nThe two #1s came first after about five minutes or so - super quick! It was HUGE. It was pretty standard, but again, it was just... well, really big. The soup was flavorful, and I added lemon and bean sprouts in it. I finished the entire thing because I barely had any breakfast, and I don't recommend trying to finish it if you truly can't.\n\nI didn't get a chance to try the Bun Bo Hue, but apparently, it is super spicy and very filling. After the other two in our party came - they ordered a #17 and #21 - the fried fish cakes came.\n\nI tried one. I, personally, didn't like it. The outer skin is kind of tough, and I assume it's meant to be that way, and the fish cake is way too chewy. I don't like foods with textures I consider strange (which, this one was). Also, it came with a small bit of pickled carrots, white radish, and lettuce. I didn't try any of the veggies though.\n\nAs for #28 (the vermicelli), I did try some. They didn't give a large amount of the sweet sauce with carrots in it; some of the noodles were still slightly dry. But other than that, the pork and egg rolls were cooked perfectly.\n\nService was great. They seated us quickly, considering how hectic it was and how hard it was to get a 6-person table. Food was served in a short amount of time, they were gracious enough to give us extra bowls without us even asking! \n\nAlthough this place has great service and good food, it is SLIGHTLY overpriced for pho. My beef ball combination noodle thing cost $8.25 for an XL size. I don't come here often, but when I do, it's mostly for convenience sake. I would prefer to go to a place where it's slightly cheaper, but almost the same size portion for the exact same meal. But that's just my two cents and my personal preference. There's honestly nothing too bad about this place.", "author": "Nancy C."}

There was something bizarre, maybe missing, about each ingredient. The noodles had a weird texture, the soup was extremely bland and the beef tasted a little stale.

Round, clear skin dipped into the hot water bowl and you fill it with, a crisp lettuce, cold noodles, chicken, basil and dipped in the fish sauce absolutely delicious.  \n\nPlace has adequate seating for twos/fours and larger parties with your average Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant atmosphere.

Service is somewhat friendly especially the guy with the glasses and blue shirt but the guy at the cash register seems like he's always kinda brutish, unfriendly, never smiles and never says thank you.\n\nI think if they bump up their service and act more friendly they can increase their business.  The place seems busy whenever I go in so people probably accept it as just how these Asian places operate.

Took a sip of their Lipton tea and the same weird smell/taste was found there. \n\nI dont know why they have so many customers, maybe its because its the only PHO place in the are but I am not going to pay $20 dollars for two for soap flavored pho.

I typed in Pho in the yelp search box and this place popped up first so I thought I would give it a try. When my friend and I walked in they greeted us with smiles. I ordered the small Pho Ga(chicken pho) and my friend ordered  the small steak/tendon beef broth pho with a side order of fried shrimp. It was just as I imagined ! Delicious !! The small had a satisfying amount of noodles, and the fried shrimp were not over cooked and dry. I will definitely eat here again. I gave them a 4 stars and not 5  due to lack of service. They never came back to our table after we got our food nor brought our check to our table. After waiting patiently at my table when my friend I finished our meal I finally just got up and went to go pay. Still, that doesn't take away from the quality of the food. I will definitely be back soon :-)", "author": "Jasmine R."}

So my boyfriend and I ordered a small bowl of pho and a sandwich to share. The sandwich was DELICIOUS and had a lot of filling inside, but the bread did flake a lot of crumbs. The pho was mediocre, nothing special. I tried their housemade soy milk (the server pushed towards me ordering the housemade soy milk over the canned soy milk that I had wanted), which was actually really good. Most places that I've tried housemade soy milk tastes aged, but this one, undoubtedly was fresh and had the right amount of sweetness.

This is the only pho restaurant in the area so my fiance and I stop here for lunch almost every other week during our break from work. Today we came during noon and it was packed. We were seated at the round table with three other men who just kept staring. One of the ladies came to take our order and I asked her if we can get another table that just opened up. She said people are waiting that just came in, and I told her that we have been waiting and all she said was \"SO ARE YOU READY TO ORDER OR WHAT?\". RUDE! So she took our orders and I saw that some people just got up at another table and I asked the bald guy if we could sit there and he said yes. After that the waitress gave the table up to people who just came in. The bald guy realized that and luckily someone else got up at another table and he said that we could sit there. Sorry, but I don't feel comfortable sitting with three other people who stare at you while you are trying to eat. Anyways, after that we ordered our usual seafood pho, which I think is really good, and a vietnamese sandwich that we always get because it goes good with the soup. We asked for waters and the waitress forgot until we asked the bald guy, and I guess he told her to go and get it for us. SO HERE IT GOES, HALFWAY THROUGH MY FIANCE'S BOWL SHE FOUND A TOOTHPICK IN THE NOODLES!!! I DON'T EVEN WANT TO THINK OF WHERE IT CAME FROM, BUT THAT IS NASTY AND COULD HAVE INJURED HER IF SHE ATE IT.

So I felt like some Pho noodles. So I check them out on yelp and they got pretty good reviews. So I figure since I was around the area I'll give them a try. I sat down next to the door and was handed a menu. That's the only thing that was fast. It took me about 30 seconds cause I already knew what I wanted to eat. I noticed that they sat three other tables after I sat down. They took their order and got their food even before I even ordered mine's.  Pho is (in my opinion) all about the soup. If it is bland or is the soup rich with flavors.  In this case it was bland....nothing to get excited bout. And if you add on the terrible service then this would equal to about a star.

The service is fast and on your table you find all the delicious condiments that add to your pho that make it even more delicious. Before being served pho (if that's what you ordered), someone brings you a plate of bean sprouts, lime and leaves to add to your soup as well.

It was Crab and Asparagus soup served with whole pre-blanched aspargus, crab meat, chopped scallions and an egg. served in a seafood broth. We were both happy with the flavor and portion, not to mention some good asparagus and substantial quantities of crab meat. My wife washed all that down with rice and BBQ Chicken and I, the broiled beef strips covered in unsalted peanuts and a sweet BBQ sauce that didn't overpower the chicken. Of course. accompanied with the token pepper and vinegar dipping which was integrated with carrot strips and fresh chopped scallions. \n\nAll pretty good stuff.  We were both happy we stopped for the first time.\n\nWe washed all the food down with the pre-dinner tea and two beers. \n\nThe bowls of Pho being served around us were huge and accompanied with tons of veggies.

Being a cold, foggy night - I thought a big bowl of piping hot Pho was just what the doctor ordered.\n\nI don't know much about Pho. To be quite honest, I had never even heard of it before the great \"How do you pronounce Pho?\" debate of Yelp Talk 2006. After that, I was intrigued. I tried it and have been hooked ever since.\n\nThat being said, I don't particularly know what makes good Pho. I just know what I like - and I liked the Pho at Pho Ha Tien. My main requirements are flavorful broth, generous noodle portions and H-O-T. The pho here filled those requirements nicely. They offer numerous variations, but I stuck with my usual - rare eye round and well-done flank steak. \nThe BF had the noodle soup with barbecued pork. He didn't love it - he was surprised that the pork came on a separate plate and needed to be dumped into the broth - but he liked it. He gave higher marks to the three colored coconut drink he had for dessert. I just don't get Asian desserts - but that is a whole other review. Overall a very pleasant dining experience. I'll for sure go back.\n\nOh...\n\nWe also had a Vietnamese shrimp roll. It was amazingly fresh and so big I could hardly fit it in my mouth \n\n(Darin!)", "author": "Jamie M."}

They also have the bbq over rice or rice noodles, which is also good. And they have Vietnamese Sandwiches.  And they have sweet milkshake-like drinks. They have other stuff on the menu, like La Lot beef and other more complicated Vietnamese stuff, but they seem to be out of it those all the time. \r\n\r\nI have a low bar for pho places, though.  I mean, it's just got to be good pho.\r\n\r\nThere's only one problem I have with this place and that is that a few of the people who work there are really  grumpy, particularly one guy who I think must be the owner.  This is not the greatest place to take kids because the dining room is small, but it's also noisy (they seem to always have the TV on, which faces the diners, so don't go there if you want someone to concentrate on you).

I wanted Pho but instead of rare meat, I wanted Wontons. Yea I know I know, I just wasn't craving the rare meat. Anway, they gave me egg noodles instead of rice noodles which wasn't even crackin'. I thought that I made myself really clear but I guess not. If I wanted Wonton noodle soup, I would've gone somewhere else. Lesson learned, don't switch up your Phos!

I actually think their pho is sub par, the meats sorta rough, soup lacks a little bit in flavor, and lemons are not strong enough. They however managed to get the extra star from me because of their humongous selection of food that is not too bad.\n\nHere are a couple of things that are really hard to find, esp. DECENT in Vietnamese restaurants up and down the bay excluding San Jose's Lion Plaza because they might have better.\n- Bun Rieu, a crabmeat, pork, and tomato variety of pho. It's pretty good here, it's one of the only places I know that serves it too!\n- Banh Cuon, dude, honestly, seriously. If you can get it without that THICK white coat around the meat, you're lucky. Here you can, it's good, but the fried onion they put on top of it compromises the flavor.\n- Banh Xeo, as much as I like it. Don't get it here, it's quite disappointing, esp. after the one at the Lion Plaza, or from your mom's cooking. But if you're in the craving for it, at least you CAN get it.\n\nIn my belief, their sandwiches are pricey, I'm used to paying more like $2.25 for my Banh Mi Dac Biet, Combination special.\n\nI like Ha Tien, but I wouldn't order just like the Pho Dac Biet, maybe like a vermecelli bowl or rice or what I listed above.", "author": "Win\u00e8 C."}

Love their eggrolls, rice plates, beef stew, sandwiches, dessert drinks, and pho.  There's something for everyone, so if one doesn't like noodles, they can have rice, specialty entrees, sandwich, or appetizers.  The restaurant is spacious and full of lighting.  Location is convenient via transportation and plenty of parking.  It's close to everything...whether you crave for ice cream, just head over to Rite-Aid for cheap ice cream, or head to a  nearby bakery for pastries, or pamper yourself to a mani/pedi for cheap.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-18", "description": "When it comes to pho [pronounced like \"fun\" without the \"n\"], I like a lighter, more simple broth. For Southern-style pho, I stuff the sprouts into the bottom, throw in some basil and squeeze in a little lime. Everyone has their own style of eating pho. Stealthypoo doesn't like the sprouts, so she doesn't put in any. She likes to put in a whole lot of sauce. It turns her bowl into a murky vat and masks the flavor of the soup, which I'll never understand, but that's just how she likes it. At Pho Ha Tien, I ask for the rare beef to be served separately from the pho. I put those slices in and wait until they're a safe color to eat. I've asked for the beef on the side at the pho place in Westlake, and their slices are much too thick and don't come out as tender as the ones here. It really depends on the cut of the meat. These are thinly sliced and not completely frozen when they reach your table. No matter the temperature of the broth, the meat seems to come out soft. Just don't leave it in too long before eating!\n\nPrices are cheap. If you're feeling extra hungry, there's a larger size bowl you can get, and then you can add on noodles or extra orders of meat. The extra side of meat costs almost as much as getting another small bowl of pho, so you might just want to do that. Not sure how many slices come in that side order.\n\nService isn't horrendous. It's family-run. One lady is easier to order from [the older one] than another who always appears grumpy. Parking is a pain in the butt [one of the reasons I'm rarely at the gym]. Not impossible, however. The K-line runs right along Ocean, so one could take that. \n\nThis is the place I go to when I wake up on a weekend morning craving pho. Of course, usually what happens is we'll end up at this place, and I'll order something else because I took a look at their extensive menu and another caught my eye. The bun (rice vermicelli bowl) is a safe bet, and the rice plates are fairly simple. The sandwiches are acceptable and have served as sustenance during the summer Stern Grove concerts. We would get to Stern Grove early, save some spots, and then one of us would grab sandwiches from Pho Ha Tien after 10am. I also like to get my fix of Vietnamese coffee here [strong coffee with condensed milk = SO GOOD], even though with braces, I shouldn't be drinking any coffee. I just brush quickly afterwards!\n\nThey are closed on Tuesdays. I've forgotten on several occasions and driven by - oops. \n\nIt's 3.5 stars, but since everyone else gave 'em such a low rating, I've moved them up just a little bit. It's not a place for everyone. I think I'm more on the generous side with this place because I've been going there for awhile now. I like it. Doesn't mean you have to.", "author": "Tinna H."}

(and it's a LOT cheaper here)\n-we've also tried the more traditional dishes like the catfish and crepes... they were all very interesting and tasty, but we tend to stick to our favorites.\n-can't forget all the yummy desserts... 3 bean drink and fried banana ice cream are our faves.\n-also, best post-workout meal are the vermicelli noodles. light and healthy, and hits the spot.\n\nsome reviews said that the service is not that great... but everyone has been friendly to us since day 1. they even give us free food and drinks once in a while! (yes, that's how often we eat there).", "author": "Ruth T."}

Pretty standard savory beefy Pho that only gets better with some spicy Sriracha sauce added.

We've been to a lot of pho places, and we really like this one.  The pho is great and the price is cheap!  It is a very basic eatery with no frills.  Clean and basic service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-08-29", "description": "Close by. Nearby restaurants worse. A few dishes are actually OK by my Vietnamese Restaurant \"hole in the wall\" standards. \n\nFirst, I've worked with a few Vietnamese guys that have taken me around (San Jose area) to have a basic idea of what decent Pho and Bun should taste like. Second, a seemingly simple dish like Pho is apparently very complicated to get \"right\" as few places manage to pull it off. Third, some places have friendly, attentive service and good food, a mix of the two, or some variation of the two. \n\nPho Ha Tien is a bit below average on service and overall food quality. Usually places that have \"Pho\" in their name are emphasizing that dish as their specialty - this place has little to brag about. Most soups I've tried there are on the bland side, something is really missing in the flavor - the broth could be plain water and I'd barely notice. One notable exception is the \"curry\" Pho - a dish I have only noticed at this place but it's actually very good - if you like things a little on the hot side. Also, the sandwiches aren't bad.\n\nOverall not a place I frequently visit, as I have a car and bus fare and have come to believe that Taco Bell/KFC is about the pinnacle of what this stretch of Ocean has to offer in the way of a consistently edible meal. There's another Vietnamese restaurant down at Miramar called the \"Mayflower\" (yeah, funny name), and although you end up leaving there smelling like food the service is usually brighter and the food's a *little* better (can't vouch for the pho there yet). \n\nPho Ha Tien will do in a pinch, but don't leave your house or neighborhood for it as a destination - you may be let down a bit. Street parking is available, but you'll have to compete with the 24 hours fitness crowd clogging up the local streets for blocks and running stopsigns.", "author": "Zen T."}

However, as soon as the waiter started talking to my husband and I, I got the vibe that he was none too friendly. \n\nWe did arrive about 15 minutes before closing time so I thought that maybe, he had a long day and just wanted to go home, which is understandable. However, before the restaurant officially closed, another gruff co-worker of his started to put all of the chairs up on the empty tables without any regard for the people who were sitting next to them.\n\nThe final straw of the \"completely rude service\" theme of the night was when that same guy putting the chairs up got into my personal space so that he could turn off the TV that was above my head. Mind you, we had just paid so it would only be a few minutes before we would've left.\n\nBeing someone who likes to provide constructive feedback, I went up to the counter to talk to the manager to let him know what had happened. What occured next was a total joke...I would've expected at least an apology for the rudeness but the 2 servers instead started to raise their voices and get confrontational with me saying that they were doing it to make it \"easier\" for them to close.\n\nNow, this place is kind of a hole in the wall and being Asian myself and knowing the general service level of most Asian restaurants, I was not expecting even 3 star service. But what they \"served\" up was pretty much the worse crap in terms of service, the attitude was completely atrocious.\n\nOne time in this rude place is enough for me thank you very much! I will never spend another penny in this place which is a shame as I think their food was actually ok. Just don't even go there!!!", "author": "Judy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-04-18", "description": "We ventured out to the Sunset to go to Iriving to get a Viet sandwich, a new recent obsession of mine. While driving down Ocean we spotted this place and said...hey...why not? We were seated quickly. The ambiance...not much to speak of. But I had a feeling that this was not what the place was about. Looking around...it looked to be all about the pho. So we scrapped the Viet sandwich idea and went with that. We both ordered the #2 - pho with the whole cow in it - tripe, tendon, flank and beef balls (no...not Rocky Mountain oysters). A large bowl cost $6 - good deal but also the standard price in SF. The pho was pretty good - not great - adequate - satisfying. Nothing we couldn't have gotten anywhere else and not spectacular.  You get the idea. My \"beef\" with this place though was the service, which was pretty much non-existent. After we were obviously done nobody came by and asked us if were wanted the check. Even after flagging the lady down and indicating that fact, we still sat for 5 mins without getting the check. We ultimately ended up having to go up to the counter and ask for it ourselves. I saw that somebody else made this comment as well. Come here if you're in the neighborhood. It is like I said, adequate. But with all the great Viet places in the city, I wouldn't go out of your way to come here.", "author": "Steve H."}

The Pho is very good, and the lemongrass chicken and beef are great too, actually you can't go wrong with their menu; and tell me where can you have a good meal for $7 bucks, you can't even go to Burger King for that money anymore, a small con, they do use MSG but not excessively, I wish they wouldn't, but hey, you can't win them all.  It is a family friendly place too, I have been coming to this place for 7 years.  Now.....if what you are looking for is luxury,  cloth napkins, fancy tablecloths, etc., you are in the wrong place, this is a family run restaurant, clean, friendly and fairly priced, the food is super fresh and their the Vietnamese iced coffee a must have!, although my wife likes the iced tea and my kids love the frozen drinks with tapioca pearls . My absolute favorite is the beef satay pho.  For a luch on the go they also have really good sandwiches for less than three bucks, Come on people!!! you can not complaint about them putting just enough meet on their sandwiches,  they are $2.75, you can not compare them to the $5.99 monsters from Safeway or the $7.90 from Subs Inc. I repeat they are ONLY $2.75 and it is a very generous sandwich for the money, very tasty too.  Enough said, I'll keep coming back, in fact I was there last night :-)\nEnjoy", "author": "Pablo T."}
