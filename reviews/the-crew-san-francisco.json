The service was great and food came out quick. If you check in, you get a free order of gyoza!! \n\nWe ordered: \n- Beef Bulgogi: this was pretty sweet but I thought it was dry. It costed about $18-$19 for a large order.\n- Spicy Rice Cake: the rice cake was chewy and the sauce was so bomb. The sauce was spicy yet sweet and this order was also big. Costed about $13\n- Soft Tofu Stew: THIS WAS SOOOO BOMB!! I would definitely recommend this stew!! \n\nOverall, the food was really good and for the price, you get a big portion. THEY ALSO OPEN LATE!! They also offer korean bbq and I'll probably come back to dry their KBBQ!", "author": "Quynh L."}

There's been quite a few times my boyfriend & I were coming home to the Sunset from partying with friends, & would try to figure out what we wanted to eat & if any of those places were open or not. The Crew has come through for us so many times because they stay open until 2am & their food is just BOMB. We always get some type of Korean Fried Chicken because they do it so very well, & we discovered a new favorite Korean dish we both like, Tteokbokki! \n\nIt's pretty hilarious how whenever we go out to eat at ANY ethnic restaurant & we feel like being adventurous with our order, the waitress always looks at my -white- boyfriend & says we might want to order something else because it's \"spicy\" or \"americans usually don't like it\" not knowing how absolutely SEASONED & unafraid of food my boyfriend is! Well, on this particular occasion, we got the haba\u00f1ero mango wings which I absolutely loved & were for once, too intense for my boyfriend! In his defense though, haba\u00f1ero anything is always kind of a toss-up, you gotta use it sparingly to really enjoy the flavor of your food accentuated by the slight taste of the haba\u00f1ero pepper. The Tteokbokki is a cylindrical rice cake cooked in this not so spicy red sauce with green onions & sesame seeds. Super good! Korean food is such a sensory cuisine where you get to enjoy something crispy then something chewy, something hot then something cold, then something sweet then something spicy! Such a balanced spectrum.\n\nOverall, we be lovin' The Crew & everything they serve. They're polite & open late too, so win-win! :)", "author": "Celine L."}

The space itself is on the smaller side, grills on one side and regular tables on the other. Like places in LA they have a steady stream of current pop music playing to keep the atmosphere lively.\n\nMy family of 4 ordered a good mix of dishes and overall, thought everything was done well.\n\nWe began our meal with some banchan staples - kimchi, fish cakes, pickled radish, 2 kinds of bean sprouts, and broccoli. Next came out the complimentary gyoza (with Yelp check in). These were delivered piping hot right out the fryer and honestly were quite delicious.\n\nOur entrees came next. I thought the kimchi fried rice was one of the better ones I've had lately. Rice was still loose but had a good coating of sauce and kimchi mixed in. It was no frills and straight to the point omitting some more trendy toppings of spam or corn - I didn't mind, these often mask the kimchi flavor anyways.\n\nMoving on, the galbitang was a little smaller than I imagined but the flavor was totally on point including my favorite thinly sliced japanese yams within. The broth is also an ultimate comfort food for those cold SF nights. Have it over rice. Thank me later.\n\nNext, having read that this place is famous for its chicken, we decided to order the sweet garlic fried chicken. Pieces were crisp and had a decent sweetness to them but could have used more garlic flavor in my opinion. Some of the breast pieces were also a little dry but hopefully you go with people who are cool with double dipping....or maybe next time we'll just ask for wings.\n\nContinuing on, the dolsot bibimbap was good but the egg was a little overdone and I wasn't sure why leafy greens was included as a topping. Cooked leafy greens are not appealing in the slightest. That said, this dish was still very good. It had just the right amount of crispy rice bits to keep the dish balanced. Probably the least remarkable dish of the night was the tofu stew. I don't think it was brought over hot enough - we had a little challenge cooking our raw egg thoroughly. It looked more soft boiled at the end of the day.\n\nAll in all, it feels good to add another locale to our food selections in Noreiga. I would certainly welcome a repeat experience!", "author": "Elaine Y."}

In my opinion, the food here tasted much more authentic than some places I've checked out downtown, and the prices are pretty affordable/inexpensive for the most part.\n\nThe Crew appears like a late night munchies restaurant, I'm actually surprised this place isn't closer to where there's more action in the city especially since this place is open until 2 AM. We came here at 9 PM and seats were pretty easy to get. Some of the tables have grills for bbq. This is a great place to kick back with friends or go on a late night date. \n\nI was pretty impressed by the service here and how friendly our waiter was. There were only two people manning the restaurant the whole night and probably around 7+ tables so props to them, they handled the late night rush really well. Our waiter even noticed that our table was rocky due to a shorter table leg and secured it. I've never had that happen at any other restaurant - so much attention to detail!\n\nThe menu has typical Korean options like soft tofu stew, bbq, chicken wings, bibimbap, etc. I was told that the Kimchi Fried Rice is pretty good. We wanted something warm, soupy and filling after a long day out hiking and there were plenty of options for stews. Make sure to check in on Yelp for the free gyoza! \n\nSoft Tofu Stew - I opted for seafood as protein for this entree, and the broth itself was super addicting! My main gripe was that the tofu portions were pretty sparse and were floating around in smaller chunks so my expectations weren't quite met. It was still filling though, but I definitely wanted more of the tofu. It comes with a bowl of rice, but I think it'd be nice if it came with an egg as well.\n\nMy boyfriend got the Spicy Pork Stew and was very satisfied with it!

Seafood pancake was not only big in portions, it tasted really amazing.\n\nI would opt out on the chicken though, the Sweet and Spicy chicken was more sweet than spicy. Not in a good way. It was sweet as caramel, which is no bueno in my standards. 99 Chicken and Bonchon are much better options for chicken. I was also annoyed with the elderly waitress who kept trying to egg us on to get the expensive options. We were going to get wings, but she suggested the \"chicken pieces since portions were bigger\".\n\nWe trusted her input at first, so we ordered them. She also tried to convince us to pay $2 extra for half-half, but our decision was firm on only Sweet and Spicy. And, it turned out to be a disappointment anyway. (By her explanation, I thought they were boneless but they weren't. Disgusting. Sloppy proportions. Would've gotten wings straight off the bat if we knew)\n\nOverall, service was okay even though it could be shady as fuck. As bizarre it sounds, it's normal for Asian-owned restaurants.

We decided to get the budae jigae and the kimchee fried rice with beef.  I've never had budae jigae before so I was excited to try it!  It's basically Korean ramen with spam, sausage, and tofu in a soup like base.  It was really delicious and very filling!  The tofu was super soft.  The fried rice was just as good.  This is a hidden gem for Korean food.  I highly recommend this place!", "author": "Mikayla M."}

If there was anything as soup being too flavorful, this is the spot. The flavor was all there in the beef kimchee tofu soup that we ordered. The flavor was bold, but not overly spicy. Make sure you order extra rice to go with the soup. \n\nThe kimchee pancake was also a favorite of mine here. My first time eating it and I'm so glad my boyfriend introduced it to me because I want more! I usually order the seafood pancake, but I rather much prefer the kimchee one. It feeds about 3 to 4 people. Remember to eat it when it's fresh while its crispy and fluffy!\n \nFree gyoza with check in! \n\nExcellent service!\n\nAmerican AND k-pop music!", "author": "Amy T."}

Their fried chicken wings have the right amount of crunchy skin and chicken ratio, and it's so tasty! Their side dishes are also very tasty and fresh. I love how they include non-spicy fish cakes in their side dishes. It's not often I see Korean restaurants serve non-spicy fish cakes or fish cakes as part of their side dishes. It's one of my favorite side dishes; I can eat fish cakes all day.  \nThe dinner prices for each dish add up and is pretty pricey altogether, so I recommend going during lunch time or just ordering your favorite dishes if you want to save money! I believe for eight fried chicken wings it's $8.95 and $23.95 for their kalbi during their dinner hours. The non-spicy rice cakes (Tteokbokki) and fish cakes I also ordered are $10.95. (The pictures is of their food during dinner time)\nThe place is a bit small and tight. There's one side for Korean BBQ and the other side is for ordering cooked dishes. But if it gets busy they start to seat people on the kbbq side. The seating is a bit close to other guests to where you can hear their conversations and they can hear yours, but I didn't feel uncomfortable. \nI've ordered to go orders before and they have messed up my order, so I recommend eating in or checking your order before you leave to avoid miscommunication. \nBut besides that, their fried chicken and kalbi are the best I've ever had!", "author": "Kristin H."}

Need I say more?\n\nMy friend and I had plans to visit Tiki Haven next door but needed some food first. The bartender recommended this place so we came in and were seated right away at a small table for two.\n\nThe menu offered your standard KBBQ fare, stews, KFC, and other random appetizers (like French fries!). My friend let me do the ordering so I decided on the appetizer sampler (you can choose 3 that are priced $5.95) of French fries, gyoza, and croquettes and we decided to share the bulgogi entree.\n\nEverything was cooked well and super tasty. Bulgogi was seasoned great, the fries were super hot and crispy, and the gyoza/croquettes were accompanied with a spicy mayo-type sauce that was out of this world good. I wish there would've been more banchan but the 6 we received all tasted fresh and delicious, especially their kimchi. \n\nThe only negative was that service was kind of slow. It took 10-15 mins before our order was taken and even with ringing the bell at our table, I don't know if they couldn't hear it cuz I had to ring it multiple times. I hate doing that cuz it makes me feel like a jerk for doing so. \n\nBut aside from that, food was great and service was friendly. Total was under $45, with tax & 20% tip.

There were only two other tables seated so there was no wait. Even though there isn't a check-in offer advertised on Yelp anymore, if you show them that you checked in, they will still honor the promotion of free gyoza. Awesome! Ban chan here isn't impressive with only six options, two of which are different kinds of bean sprouts. As an appetizer we had the fried oysters, which came out piping hot and were delicious. The spicy tofu soup (with beef) was not hot enough to fully cook the egg, and too spicy (which would be more okay if it was more flavorful). The seafood pancake was done really well with plenty of seafood. I usually don't like it when the pancake is too thick because it means it's dough-y, but this pancake was thick because they had included so much seafood and veggies, which isn't something I'm complaining about! The sweet garlic wings had a good flavor, but I almost wish the sauce was on the side so that the wings don't get soggy sitting in the sauce. The tteokbokki had the right amount of spicy and sweet with a perfect chewy texture to the rice cake. Kalbi was really good - cooked and flavored well, but at a steep price of $25 for a pretty small portion. The prices of all the other items we ordered were very reasonable though. When we received the check, it came with a probiotic yogurt drink for each person!

I came back twice recently to give another chance cause I'm longing for back when I used to be excited to come here. \n\nThe quality of service has gone down and prices have gone up.\n\nSERVICE\n\nEvery time I come here, the service has been less than stellar. The first time, I was told that the kitchen was closed and that it would be a 30 minute wait. The second time, it took about 15 minutes to take our order. The food took a long time to be ready and we had to ask the waiter many times for water, napkins, and utensils because he kept forgetting. I think they only have one waiter on staff and he is also the one making the food so it takes a very long time to get served, if at all. They should pre-set their utensils and have napkin and water dispensers to remedy this. Even having their table-side buttons to push to call for a waiter is better than waiting for them to come around 5 minutes later.\n\nFOOD\n\nGYOZA - These used to come free with a Yelp check in. I guess they stopped doing this mid-2016. They were pretty yummy and I liked the sauce that it comes with. It was a good appetizer to start with because their banchan wasn't filling enough during the long waits before you actually got your food.\n\nDDEOKBOKKI JJGAE - This is very spicy. Even though the menu says it has 1 chili pepper, it has way more that that. Granted, I can't handle spicy food very well, I was with someone who liked spicy food and even he said it was too spicy. We ended up ordering rice so we could use it to tone down the spiciness.\n\nSEAFOOD PANCAKE - I actually really liked this, it has a a good crisp crunch but the pancake itself crumbled within and had lots of seafood and veggies mixed in it. The only downside was that it was very oily. I took it to go because I couldn't finish it all the oil seeped through the box and left oil stains in my car and all over my kitchen table. So if you're gonna take it to go, be aware of that! Otherwise, it was quite good, I ended up heating it up in a toaster over at 300* and it still tasted like fresh.\n\nI don't think I'll come back here anymore, it's just not the same.", "author": "Anna F."}

While the food isn't the best Korean food I've ever had, it's still a solid price to quality ratio. The prices are typical for Korean spots in the Bay Area. I appreciate that they have a nice selection of meals and snacks. Given the lack of \"wow factor\" in the food, I think the best times to eat here are lunch (cheaper prices) and late night. The environment is more dive-y and very chill. \n\nI think everything I've tried can be summed up in a sentence: no \"wow\" factor, but definitely hits the spot. I wouldn't say that it's better than the average restaurant or another, but again - the time and service make it so enjoyable. The server didn't mind refilling my banchan three times! I noticed that over half the tables were left un-bussed for the majority of my meal. Of course my meal wasn't affected by this, but it took away from the environment a little.

I will say that good Korean food in SF is slim pickings...you get much better quality/value in the South Bay. However, we decided on The Crew because we were hungry, wanted good food, and had to stay sober because birthday girl was watching Hamilton right after.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nThe kalbi and the bulgolgi were quite good -- juicy and flavorful as it should be. The half and half came on a bed of perfectly cooked, pearly onions that had really absorbed the meat marinade. We asked for the tteokbokki on the milder side, but the chewy rice cakes in the sweet and spicy sauce did not disappoint. The crispy seafood pancake came with whole jumbo shrimp and little oysters inside. I was a little turned off by the shell still on the shrimp and the dipping sauce was too mild. We ended up ladling the extra tteokbokki sauce on the pancake like heathens. The fried chicken wasn't bad -- fried to a crisp and smothered in sweet garlic sauce. I've had better but I have no complaints either. The mandu were HOT and crispy, but could have done with a little more filling. The panchan were pretty plain -- bean sprouts done two ways, kimchi, broccoli, picked daikon, and fish cakes.\n\nOverall, I thought the food was good but not amazing.  \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nI know this is pretty much the going price for Korean food in SF, but it feels a bit ludicrous to pay $12 for tteokbokki and almost $20 for seafood pancake. And why pay $25 for a plate of kalbi/bulgogi when you could pay the same amount and get KBBQ buffet somewhere else. Portion sizes are moderate. Don't forget your free mandu with Yelp check-in. You can get away with paying about $20-25 per person if you don't order any alcoholic beverages here.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nOur server was friendly and fast. She refilled our panchan without any attitude at all (Some places give you the stankeye.) I thought it was weird that they only gave us ice water, but I'm sure they would have given us tea if we requested it.\n\nNo bonus star because, as I've said in the past, I'll probably wait to satisfy my Korean food cravings until I'm back in the South Bay.\n\nTL;DR: One of the better Korean places in this area.

It has a lot of spunk to it, and is very casual and comfortable. Most of the time, we take advantage of the free gyoza at check-in which helps with deciding what to order. For the most part, we order the fried chicken in assorted pieces with both the sweet garlic and the sweet and spicy sauces, and this place makes Korean fried chicken oh so good. They also make solid KBBQ as well, love the bulgogi and the galbi. Those are just the highlights on the menu, and nearly everything we have tried have been solid choices.

The kimchee fried rice with beef was spot on; not overly oiled or too spicy--a mistake made often with this dish. But not here--the range of flavors could all be found from the spicy tart kimchee to the mildly sweet beef to the moist egg and smoky rice. \n\nThe wings were crispy and the sauce wasn't too sticky. Finally the Gamja Tang (pork and potato stew) was plentiful and delicious. Two servings is overkill--could feed 6! A single serving would give 4 a good taste, leaving room to try more dishes. It will be really good as leftovers with some cold rice though.\n\nThis may be more popular as a late night spot, but it was easy parking and getting seated and served was a breeze around 6:30.", "author": "M Lisa R."}

I wasn't blown away, but I think it's a solid choice for some Korean comfort food. We tried three dishes:\n\nDeep fried chicken wings: just as crispy as they look, which I loved, but underseasoned. I think next time I might try the garlic flavored variety - the crunch would probably be a great vehicle for sauce.\n\nSeafood pancake: good, but there's always room for more seafood! Texture was really nice though - soft inside, but nice and crispy on the edges.\n\nDolsot bibimbap: probably my favorite! Let the dish sit until the bowl stops sizzling - the rice develops a great crust that adds amazing texture. I also liked the enoki mushrooms.\n\nThe staff stayed on top of things, and refilled our banchan as needed.\n\nAll in all, I'll be back - I'd like to try some of their soups and other dishes.", "author": "Delia Z."}

Let me start by saying that since my first review, I've revisited this place several times. Color me impressed because these more recent visits have changed my mind. \n\nLast I was here, the waiter for our table was absolutely incredible. I feel terrible that I did not catch his name. I had a few questions about a few of the menu items and he answered them with complete honesty. I let him know that our table planned to share our food, so he suggested dishes based off of its shareability. \n\nFor 3 people, we ordered Jap Chae (stir fried clear noodles with vegetables), garlic fried chicken wings, kimchi fried rice, and Tonkatsu. Halfway through our meal, our waiter brought us a dish of Gyoza too because he noticed I was \"checking in\" to the restaurant. When this place gets busy, it gets hard for the waiters to juggle since there seems to only be one waiter per shift. Therefore, if you're craving late-night Korean comfort food, perhaps plan to come on a weeknight.\n\nShoutout to Stella K. for reaching out to me.

Needless to say, I was impressed by everything we ordered!\n\nSorry for lack of pictures, but I guarantee you, everything looked and tasted delicious! We ordered the garlic chicken wings, half and half (kalbi and bulgogi), bimbambap, and gyoza. \n\nThe banchans provided was perfect for our meal, because it acted like palate cleansers. My favorite one would have to be the yellow squash thingy. Fish cake was chewy and flavorful! Kimchi had a balanced amount of tang and refresh-ness. Bean sprouts were sesame-y (one of my favorite flavors). \n\nThe garlic chicken wings were crunchy and very garlic-y! Not much else to say, it was simple yet delightful. The half and half was yummy too! I liked the short ribs more because it was more moist and flavorful. The bulgogi was light in flavor because they did not drench the meat in sauce. It seems as though the flavors were infused into the meat, almost as if it was smoked with the flavor. Both went well with the purple rice :) Bimbambap was delicious as well! I don't really know how it's supposed to taste, but it was sweet and juicy and just yummy. :) The free gyoza was not impressive, but it was free! \n\nOverall our experience was great!

My main issue is that our group ordered the tofu soup with seafood. During our meal, there was a man who came quite close to look at our dishes. We thought that was odd but thought nothing of it. Later, we noticed the stew had beef in it! The waiter clearly knew because when we asked if it was beef and she said \"I know\" with no apology. She seemed to suggest we should be ok with it until my brother said \"we don't eat beef.\" She then told us she would get us a new one. We aren't eating beef right now for personal reasons. Maybe the man who came by before wanted to check our dish. Regardless, if the staff knew it was the wrong dish, they should have immediately fixed it. \n\nLater, they tacked on their mandatory 20% tip. This is fine as long as restaurants disclose it up front. However, we felt they did not deserve 20% considering the issue with our order was not corrected immediately even when they knew about it. The waiter tried to justify herself by telling us she said \"I know\" as a reaction, not that she really knew it was beef stew. I smell BS.

The cheese pancake was soooo yummy and I personally love cheese so I'm extremely biased. So yeah, that was awesome for you cheese and kimchi lovers out there. The chicken wings were alright and nothing special but still good. The chapchae was a bit on the sweeter side than most chapchae that I've had, so it was different than most chapchae dishes I've had but still pretty good. And lastly the makgeolli was pricey for the amount you get imo but I love makgeolli so I can't complain.\n\nI loved the generous side dishes and that they refilled our side dishes when we asked without skimping! Also, the kimchi here is SO good; usually Kimchi is a very unique subjective thing but everyone in our group agreed that it was delicious.\n\nTheir service was good and they kept refilling our waters. The waiters were extremely friendly and I liked how this place is spacious enough for groups of 4+ but still has a nice, cozy feel.\n\nI'm giving The Crew 3 stars simply because the food is good, but not awesome. This is a typical casual bar/dinner spot that is good for groups when you just want something to fill your stomachs while you drink, but there is nothing that comes to mind that makes this place go from good to great.

Which was a sign of slow & inattentive service IMO (-1) \nThere was only 4 different banchans offered, which I was indifferent about because I don't really eat side dishes in the first place.

Doenjanjige - This was delicious, wish it came in a bigger bowl! \n4. Deep fried garlic chicken wings - YUM. You must order this!

I'm a frequent visitor of LA's Koreatown (I've lived in West LA for the last 4.5 years) so I'd like to think I have a good sense of what good Korean food is supposed to taste like. That being said, the food here at the Crew was excellent and it definitely warrants comparison to some of most flavorful Korean food I've ever had. The side dishes were pretty standard for a Korean restaurant although there was one dish (the cole slaw I think?) that was really interesting and tasty. \nWe ordered the spicy chicken wings, the garlic wings, the Korean army stew, the short ribs, and french fries. The wings were covered in sauce and super meaty, unlike those small wings that are mostly bone that are served at many other restaurants. Though crispy on the outside, the chicken was still tender and juicy on the inside. They're extremely good. The stew was hearty and packed with flavor due to the multitude of ingredients included. It was my first time trying it and I am now a fan. The short ribs were grilled perfectly, tender, and delicious. I demolished the entire order by myself. Lastly, the french fries were piping hot, crispy, and thick. What more can you really ask for in fries? \n\n5/5 stars\n\nP.S. I think they're open until 2AM so this would be the perfect ending to a night spent bar-hopping or something like that.", "author": "Kaelan C."}

If so, come to The Crew!\n\nLocated on Noriega in the sunset district of SF is this small, charming Korean restaurant. I came here on a Saturday evening with a crew of five. It was rather quiet for a Saturday night and we were seated immediately. The service was nice as they were very patient with our multiple questions about items on the menu. They also consistently poured us tea and provided us with water which was very nice.\n\nI wouldn't say any of the dishes in particular was outstandingly amazing, but all of them were extremely solid in presentation, flavor, and taste. The soondubu was properly salted with a spiciness level that pleased everyone at the table. The seafood pancake came in a well sized portion and went well with the sauce. The bibimbop was cooked properly in the stone pot to provide a nice crisp layer of rice along the edges. The garlic chicken wings came with a nice sticky soy garlic sauce with a noticeable but not overwhelming garlic flavor. The bonchon came with a great variety of little dishes, each of which was unique.

Disappointingly, I have to knock this down a few stars until something change.\n\nBefore I dive in, I want to say that the food quality, and value continues to remain exceptional, arguably superior to many others in the city.  The service is also very attentive and courteous.\n\nMy disappointment is entirely driven by this new mandatory 20% tip on weekends, REGARDLESS of party size.   This was not advertised on their menus.  We only found out when we saw the line item on the bill.  The hilarious part is, the optional tip line is still there for you to add a little something extra for good service.\n\nI personally have never given them anything less than 18%, sometimes 20%+.  But that's because their staff is phenomenal and deserve it.\n\nHowever, this mandatory tipping is pure money grab.  Tips by default are voluntary (technically by definition, but actually by our culture of passing on wages to consumers, but I digress).  I understand you may need to impose a mandatory surcharge if the party is large and there's more work, but this is a three person party.  We literally ordered three things AND we've always tipped people well.  I have two recommendations here.\n\n1)  If you want to make more money and felt you've under priced your menu, then up the price per item.  So you and your staff gets paid more. \n2)  If this is a matter of your staff asking for more money.  Well then, fair work fair wages.  Pay them properly and don't squeeze your customers by nickle-and-diming.  \n\nEither way, the establishment is doing their customers, new and long time fans, a huge disservice.  Frankly, its quite insulting.  What, my meager 18% tip is not enough of a subsidy to their actual hourly wage?  Maybe you need to value your staff better and pay them an actual fair wage, they work their butts off.\n\nWith that said, I am sad that I may not frequent this place as much until something changes.

I still prefer San Tung's chicken, however. [$8.95 for 8 pcs here. For their special sauce it's $16.95 which is very pricey considering Santung's notable wings are only $9-11 with 12 pcs].\n-The Gal-Bi-Tang (short rib soup) -- Amazing short ribs. Delicate, juicy, and has that fatty taste that I love. The soup itself was quite rich too. My favorite dish here! Highly recommended.\n-Check-in on Yelp and get a plate of 6 free fried gyoza!\n-Not super crowded so the wait times are definitely shorter than other Korean places in the city.\n-They close at 2AM on most days. Perfect for those late night cravings!\n-Attentive servers.\n\nThe Not So Good:\n-Banchan -- Meh. Not the best I've had. (But it's unlimited).\n-Fried gyoza -- Very plain. I've had better gyoza through home cooking.\n-Kimchi Fried Rice -- This is my go-to dish at every Korean restaurant. It arrived in a unique and aesthetically pleasing plating, with the rice in a square shaped. Unfortunately the rice was really dry and lacked the flavorful sauce. There was so much rice! I'm not complaining, but I'd rather have smaller portions and better quality. Maybe there was too much rice so the sauce didn't distribute evenly? The egg yolk was barely runny and the best part of kimchi fried rice is being able to mix the liquid yolk with the rice. Also it's $10.95, which is overpriced for the quality (compared to my favorite at Manna's, which is $7.99 with a perfected egg and rice combo).", "author": "Vicki L."}

My sister and I had just finished working out at the gym, and we were looking for some food to eat at 11pm.  This place is open late til 2am!!  My sister had been here once before, but it was my first time.\n\nWe got in and were seated immediately.  There were a couple of other parties of guests eating, drinking, and chatting it up.  The TV was playing Korean MVs, which could be entertaining to watch when you're waiting for your food.  We decided on the bulgogi, soft tofu soup, and gyoza, which was free with a yelp check-in!\n\nSERVICE:\nOur server was very attentive and friendly.  Right off the bat, I felt welcome.  He gave us time to decide but also checked in when were ready.  He noticed that I had the yelp check-in offer ready and basically affirmed that he got me on the gyoza.  When the food came, he was kind to remind me to crack the egg into the tofu soup to cook.  Also, as I was getting rid of any potential wood splints, I dropped one of the chopsticks on the floor.  He was quick to bring me a new pair of chopsticks!  Service was great, at least at that time and day.\n\nFOOD:\nThere were 6 different banchans - ranging from fish cakes to seaweed to kimchi.  I always enjoy the fish cakes.  The yellow radish was good, but it tasted/smelled like fish (??).  Anyway, the kimchi was surprisingly good.  I am a bit picky about kimchi, but I liked this one!  Okay, now let me tell you about those free gyozas - they are sooooo good!!  I don't know what it was, but they tasted delicious.  They came with the sauce and were perfectly crisp.  The soft tofu soup we ordered was only available in mild spicy level, whereas at other Korean restaurants, you can choose from no spice to extra spicy.  But I thought it was fine because I didn't want it too spicy anyhow.  You do get your choice of meat (beef, seafood, pork, vegetable).  Our server gave us bowls and a ladle so we could share the tofu soup amongst each other, which was really nice.  The bulgogi was good, nothing too special but hits the spot with the flavors.\n\nCOST:\nWith bulgogi at $17.95 and soft tofu soup at $11.95, our meal came out to around the $30 range.  It's a bit pricier than average, but it was good!  Also, it's not easy to find good food late at night.  I would probably only come here late at night because there are other places with lunch special prices.\n\nOverall, we liked this place and it tips on the positive side due to the great service!", "author": "Stephanie Z."}

What can I say, my dubious mind wanders all over the place and that's the first thing that came to me when I saw the name.  \n\nIt wasn't until I recently saw Victor G.'s recent of The Crew that I wanted to give it a try. This man has nearly 7k reviews after all so he definitely has some Yelp cred with me.\n\nWhile The Crew advertises to be Korean and Japanese fusion, it's more Korean-centric as there were only takoyaki, gyoza, karaage, and grilled saba for the Japanese items on the menu. We came during lunch and they offered lunch specials including a bulgogi burger which I would love to try next time.\n\nThey don't use MSG and are very light on the seasoning so the food is a bit bland but that's fine with me since a dab of gochujang (fermented chili paste) does wonders for most Korean dishes. It's not the best Korean food in SF but it's decent and they have some definite stand-outs. Besides it's a big step up from the former craptastic Korean restaurant, Pine that The Crew took over: http://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-restaurant-san-francisco-3. \n\nWe started with the obligatory banchans which were ok: http://bit.ly/HxXc8y. Some lacked heat and tang but the eomuk (fishcakes) were solid. Then, came the Gyoza ($5.95 value) which was FREE if you check-in on Yelp: http://bit.ly/174VeCH. These were nicely crunchy with a fresh pork and cabbage filling. They didn't taste like they came from aisle 6 of Kukje Supermarket (frozen dumplings are normally packed with sodium) so they may be made in-house or bought from a local distributor? \n\nAunt Flo came a knocking over the weekend (sorry TMI) so I was in need of Korean comfort food. Needless to say, a sizzling pot of Dolsot Bibimap ($12.99): was in order for me: http://bit.ly/17Dh3z5. After letting it settle for a while to form that crunchy rice crust, I mixed up all the fresh veggies, beef, and rice, drizzled some gochujang and went to town on that bad boy. It was a bland but again, the gochujang solved that problem. My only gripe is I wish they used more sesame oil and heated the dolsot longer so more of a caramelized crust could be formed: http://bit.ly/Hu4Z71.\n\nBeing a kalbi slut, Mr. NSS went with their Kalbi Lunch Special ($12.99): http://bit.ly/174XJFa. He tried to be nice and give me a piece but I know how much he loves his kalbi so I just took a bite. It was tender with a nice char and a subtle savory sweetness. He loved it and devoured each piece like it was his last. Bare hands and all. This guy won't even eat egg rolls without wrapping it first with protection (no pun intended).  \n\nThe highlight of our meal was the Korean Fried Chicken (KFC). You can get a whole chicken for a very reasonable $14.95 but there was no way we can finish that along with our main so we ordered the Fried Chicken Wings (6 pieces - $8.95): http://bit.ly/1gpetiG. I'm not a fan of Western fried chicken (too heavy and greasy) but The Crew reminded me just how much I love KFC; the Korean kind. Piping hot, the wings were encrusted with a light and deliciously crunchy batter with a succulently juicy center (not greasy). It was also lightly seasoned so you can taste all the natural chicken goodness.  This KFC was definitely way better than nearby Shin Toe Bul Yi's KFC which is so overbattered and overrated (I must have been smoking something to give them 4 stars). \n\nWe were the only ones there during lunch time so service was very attentive. While I appreciate attentiveness, our sweet waitress was very eager to please and must of passed by at least 10 times during the hour we were there. It was awkward trying to shovel food into your mouth with one hand and holding a wing in another without looking like a sloppy heffer. Oh well, at least she didn't judge us. As we were leaving, our sweet waitress and the chef/owner thanked us which was a really nice gesture as you rarely see this at Asian restaurants. \n\nI forgot to mention, The Crew is also opened till 2 am EVERYDAY so you can get sloshed next door at Tiki Haven then faceplant into a steaming bowl of soondubu or a sizzling bowl of bibimbap. WOOT! Sounds like my kinda weeknight. Too bad this grandma KO's while watching Golden Girls (gotta love the slutty Blanche) before it's even time to leave the house. *Le sigh*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

A whole chicken fried in some special sweet and sour sauce. It was not that spicy (which I am super thrilled about because I am a big wuss and cant even handle hot cheetos).

Two yrs in the row, its reports were great, last year for some reason, it got bad report, however, all have been corrected immediately, and the owner showed me all of the approved corrections by the Health Dept., and all of them were dated as of March 2015 as well.  So, the Health Score should've been updated accordingly and in a timely matter, but unfortunately it hasn't happened until today yet, it's been almost a year.\n\nMy husband and I are regular customers, and we even went to this restaurant after the inspection, and we were always fine.  And the last time I was there, was today.  The foods are always tasty and great, the service is always good.  So, having this bad score (and of course having Yelp lists the score and warning just makes it worse), is really hurting the business.  \n\nThe owner has tried numerous times to contact the Health Dept. to update the score, but no luck.

Still, I think this place is pretty good. Way better than Manna. \n\nFood: I've only tried 3 things here - \nDolsot bibimbap: Great! This is always my go to. Getting this dish with the hot stone really does make all the difference. In my opinion, I wouldn't get a bibimbap unless I could get it in a hot stone pot. Make sure to let the rice harden on the sides so that you can get a little crunchiness. \n\nKalbitang - Great! I had this 3 times when I was sick. It's a very large dish but I ate it all. The soup is very tasty, probably filled with a lot of sodium...which it should be! The kalbi is also good and they give you a good amount of meat. You've probably never had this unless your Korean, but it's a great sick or rainy day dish. \n\nKalbi - Yum. I think it's a tinnnny bit over marinated, but I'd rather that than have it be bland. I'd definitely recommend getting it and it's always a crowd pleaser. \n\nBanchan - They gave us 4-5 different options which was great. If you order to-go, they make sure to give you a container for them as well. \n\nService - Every time I go, I have great service! Our waiter was super friendly and very accommodating, especially considering he was the only waiter working. \n\nSpace - The restaurant itself isn't anything fancy, but it's nice enough in my opinion. \n\nThe one thing I'd like to see is more of is variety on the menu.

She's a huge foodie, so I was pretty excited to try a place she suggested but this place, was much more than I expected. Although this restaurant is not as big as other Korean places I've been to, this place is definitely in my Top 5. \n\nThe soju, is quite strong. That's nice, since the soju I usually get at Tonight or Mokutanya tastes more like juice and since I was trying to get a nice buzz, this place really tickled my fancy. Plus there are more flavors to chose from. The downfall is that they don't have the cool effects that tonight has: the soju in the fruit bowl or the dry ice effect that releases from under the hollowed out fruit.\n\nThe food portions here are really good, significantly bigger than Tonight and the selection has a nicer variety of food. There was definitely something for everyone here and the portions are so big, everyone took a box home or was completely stuffed. The spices hit at the right spot, so there's no feeling of heartburn nor was anything hard to swallow.\n\nBack to the size of this place. It's not as big as most food places I've been to, but somehow, this places manages to make one feel homey so it doesn't feel cramped -at all.

One was apparently Korean japchae, and I loved it! They put thinly sliced zucchini in it and the sauce was wonderful. It was one of my favorite days! \n\nI figure, I'm in the area, take advantage of the Korean available. I yelped Korean in Inner/outer sunset area, near UCSF, and found this was the only one open in the middle of the day. It looks newer too, so that is a plus, to me, it means it will probably be cleaner. \n\nI head over, and the server guy was super friendly and approachable, and didn't make me feel like a P.I.T.A. by ordering to-go. $10 minimum for credit card. I ordered the entr\u00e9e portion of the japchae, I wasn't interested in the lunch special for a couple bucks less (from what I saw online) and some Korean spicy ramen (Hey, I was trying to kill two birds with one stone since I seem to be a ramen addict). It was total around $22 dollars I think. \n\nI know the quality was probably compromised by being to-go, but the ramen was inedible. By the time I got to my hotel room, the instant ramen noodles were mushy and had soaked up the entire bit of broth. I couldn't eat that after having real ramen. \n\nThe japchae was just okay. It was not as good as what I could get in college and no zucchini whatsoever, even though descriptions says vegetables. A lot of onions. I took out most of them and just ate the noodles and slivered carrots. I'm not for sure, but if I got an entr\u00e9e portion, it was pretty small in my opinion. It did come with the Korean sides (Banchan?), broccoli, something yellow, cucumbers and the spicy cabbage stuff. I loved the yellow pickled things and the broccoli, the cucumbers were a little lackluster for me personally, but I like Japanese style cucumber salad which is pretty strong. I'm not sure if the sides always come or not, I feel like they still gave me a lunch portion.  \n\nOverall, even though the service was great, the food didn't impress me and I won't be back, even if I lived in the neighborhood.", "author": "Tabitha E."}

Need to request for extra crispy next time. \n\nFried chicken wings - Mixture of wings and drumlettes. they offer a few different type of sauces. We went with the garlic honey? sauce and it was pretty good. Sweet n savory. Chicken wings were moist and very crispy. \n\nGyoza - Free with yelp check in. Decent. Deep fried pork dumplings. Not complaining cuz it's free. \n\nKalbi Tang - short rib soup.  pretty good. Broth was light but flavorful. In addition to the daikons it also had clear vermicelli noodles in it. Not skimpy with the meat n veggies but I wished there were more broth. \n\nPork Belly - My fav meat dish. Nice n fatty n juicy. Goes so well with the dipping sauce they give u. I think it's some kind of sesame oil mixed with black pepper. \n\nSpicy Pork - I don't care for this dish but my friends always order it. It was decent.

It was fried perfectly and not drenched with   sauce.  I liked that there was a good amount of tako and that I wasn't just eating fried batter.\n\n*Fried Chicken Wings ($8.95) - This came with a side of cole slaw and it reminded me of KFC's hot wings, but it wasn't spicy.  I wished they marinated the wings or seasoned it with salt & pepper as it was flavorless.   I actually ordered the wrong item as I initially thought this would be similar to San Tung's dried fried chicken wings.   I wouldn't recommend ordering this dish.\n\n*Kimchee Fried Rice ($10.95) - The menu doesn't  state that there is beef in the kimchee fried rice.  So if you're a non-beef eater, make sure you tell them to omit the beef and substitute it with chicken, pork, or just have it meatless.  I don't eat beef so when I ate a spoonful, I was thrown off.  I wish I knew The Crew makes their kimchee fried rice with beef because I wouldn't have ordered it or would have asked them to omit it.  The dish itself was okay.\n\n*Pork Belly ($16.95) - The dish came out on the typical iron plate and was pretty flavorless.

There is a lot of waiting between dishes. Also, it's a tad bit dark because of poor lighting. \nParking can sometimes be hard, so carpool if possible. \n\nMy cousin and I ordered the sampler appetizer: fried calamari, Chicken Karage and Takoyaki  (17), kimchi fried rice (11) and seafood pancake (14). \n\nFirst up, was tea which came out fairly quickly. Next was the complementary bowl of edamame beans. The two of us received exactly 7 string beans. It was baffling. Maybe it was because the bowls were too big? It was poor presentation. \n\nFried Calamari comes in ring shapes and they do not skimp on the calamari-batter ratio! This was delicious! I would definitely order this again. \n\n10 minutes after we finished our calamari our kimchim fried rice came. When ordering, I asked for my egg to be cooked all the way through. They caught their mistake before our order was brought out. How do I know?  I had the perfect view of the kitchen. I watched the cook pluck the egg off with their fingers and slide it back onto the cooking station. They put it back on top with a silver oval cooking spoon. The rice is not overly spicy and people who cannot tolerate spicy food, should be able to tolerate the light kick. I'm not sure if it is because kimchi fried rice was on such high demand that night, but our rice had a too \"fresh\" texture which made it a bit on the mushier side. \n\nI realized I was getting full. We were still waiting on 3 dishes! Our chicken karage and takoyaki came about 5 minutes after asking. The chicken karage is a bit sweet which my tastebuds find strange. I expecting salty and savory. It just wasn't to my liking and expectations. The takoyaki are not round. It's like a very soft and warm ball that has been smashed on one side (because it sits on a plate). The texture is pretty soft from what I am used to (too mushy for me). The inside texture felt right and you don't have to digging for your octopus. \n\nThe seafood pancake came relatively quickly after the rest of our appetizers came out. However, because we waited so long for it, we ended up just eating two pieces each and bringing the rest home. The pancake serving was large and slightly thick. I notice there was a lot of batter and not much condiments(?). \n\nI guess we may have ordered too much. I also wasn't expecting the appetizers to come out in separate dishes. If you want the samplers, do note that you only save $3. You can try and ask for them to come all at once so you can have a nice selection when you eat. \n\nOverall, this is not my kind of Korean (with Japanese touches) restaurant. However, this is not meant to be confused with I think the food is bad and not fresh because it seems to be. It's just that I didn't enjoy it all.", "author": "Jess W."}

The chicken wings were pretty yummy. They were covered in a garlic sauce that was the consistency of honey. Probably due to the look of the sauce, I expected it to be sweet. It wasn't sweet, it had a traditional Korean garlic chicken wing flavor. One note about the wing was that it was butchered differently than i expected. They left the wing tips on, but took half of the wing tip off. This obviously isn't anything negative or positive, I just thought it was funny looking. \nThe seafood pancake was pretty good. It was really thick and doughy. I know that some people would like their pancakes to be thinner and crispier, but I really didn't mind the doughiness. \nThe short ribs were good. The presentation was funny because the plate is in the shape of a cow LOL I thought that was hilarious. The grill marks on the meat were nice and gave it a good flavor. Short ribs are always pretty chewy, but I love eating it anyway. \nThe rice cakes or dukbokki were pretty good. I think that the dish was a lot of sauce and not enough sustenance. At least the texture was good and the flavor was there. \nThe pot stickers were good and a nice plus for Yelp users :D \n\nAll in all, it was good, the kind of good you say after a boring first date. There really isn't anything bad to say about it, but there's no spark. I don't see myself choosing this place as a number one choice but I wouldn't mind coming here again if someone else suggests it.", "author": "Tina Y."}

The square pieces of chicken had so much bone in it that it wasn't enjoyable to eat bc I had to keep spitting out bones. (Boyfriend said he just ate it bc he was lazy to spit it out, lol.)

This has been on my yelp bookmarks for a couple weeks now and I finally got to try it a few days ago for lunch with a friend.\n\nSince we came for lunch, there were lunch specials that were very decently priced. Bibimbap for only $8.95?? Usually i'm at least paying $10-13 haha. Even though that's only a few dollars less, but hey, i'm a broke college student lol. I was a little sad I didn't see dolsot bibimbap on the lunch menu (the one with the stone pot that makes your rice all crunchy and yummmm), but I settled for the lunch special one because i'm cheap like that. My friend and I also checked in on yelp, which earned us a free plate of gyoza! You could tell they were fresh because we could barely eat them since they were too hot when the waiter brought it to us. The outside was perfectly crispy, btu I wish they gave more sauce! Also the banchan here is not too bad! Mine and my friend's favorite was the fishcake, which was a little spicy but not too much. It was also warm which I didn't expect haha. The cucumbers, yellow daikon, and broccoli were among my favorites as well.\n\nThe bibimbap came fairly quickly and it included a sunny side up egg, bulgolgi, spinach, lettuce (never seen lettuce in bibimbap before--but it worked), bean sprouts, seawed, carrots, and cucumbers, all over a bed of rice. The waiter also brought over the red sauce that's spicy/sweet and I basically drowned my rice in that haha, it's so good. My friend and I both ordered the bibimbap and it was more than enough for both of us; we were stuffed afterwards! \n\nOther than the food, the service was really good, there was only one waiter, but then again it was lunch time and not that crowded, so he was quite attentive on asking how our food was and making sure we had enough water.\n\nI would definitely come back to try more things!", "author": "Tara A."}

The spicy tofu stew lacked flavor. \n\nBut overall, it was a good meal. \n\nThe service was horrible though. The waitresses were SLOW. It was like we weren't there half the time.

The garlic wings were interesting in that it wasn't what I was expecting because I thought the sauce was going to be more sweet instead of salty, but it was still pretty good.

We ordered Seafood Pancake, kimchi fried rice, Dol Sot Bibimbap, fried chicken, and got free gyoza from checking in. The only dish that had any flavor at all was the seafood pancake. The rest was bland and tasteless. Kimchi fried rice had no seasoning, dol sot bibimbap barely had meat, and fried chicken meat was tasteless. Seafood pancake was good but I wonder why they would leave shrimp tail shells in the pancake? They were definitely cheap on their ingredients....\n\nService was pretty bad. They forgot to give us tea and utensils. They bring bibimbap without spoons to mix with. The waitress didn't know how to serve dishes properly...her way of making room for food was to force the plate on the table even though there were other plates there already.  One time she almost pushed the ban chan off the table! At the end she tried to give us someone else's leftovers. It was so bad that it was comical. \n\nI didn't try to soju.

I've never been to a Korean restaurant that serves chop chae with no meat.  And it was quite juicy, you can literally slurp the damn noodles.  Not how it's supposed to be cooked.\nBBQ chicken - It was BBQ's alright, seasoned with salt and pepper only.  There was no Korean seasoning or sauce whatsoever.  We asked for mild thinking we'd get mild sauces, but the meat was not marinaded at all like Korean meats should have been.\nRice - They are real skimpy on the rice, whats up with that?

It's a complete turn off when you're not acknowledged for like 15 minutes, then you finally sit down and then you wait another 10 minutes for the server to give you your menu and then wait another 20 minutes to come take your order. No utensils for at least 10 minutes and no water until 10 more minutes of us just asking the server for water. Some of our food came in an hour and a half later. The server messed up on two of our tofu soup orders. So guess how many more minutes my friends had to wait? You guessed it! 20 more minutes. We were there for the whole entire Warriors game. The food was very good. The sweet and spicy chicken was as described but it was not worth an almost 2 hour wait for our food. They didn't even compensate us for the 2 soups that they messed up on in which they had to wait closest to 2 hours. It was already the end of the 3rd/beginning of the 4th quarter when they got their tofu soup. This post could have been 4 stars if the service was better but my experience became a 2. Food is no longer good to me if I have to wait an hour and a half for it. We could have gone to 2 other soju spots and eat there and come back to still no food at this spot.

Came here with some friends and ordered some appetizers before getting to the main course. Takoyaki and gyoza were \"okay\". A bit bland and taste was feeling like something was missing. Can't point out what though. The calamari on the other hand was pretty delicious. \n\nNext up was the Seafood Pancake and Budae Jjigae hotpot. It was good too. Fair amount to share with a people of five. The waitress that served us was patient and friendly as well. Funny though, how one of my friends and I were going to ask for water and before we could - we already saw her walking to our table with a few cups and a bottle of water. We didn't even need to ask! We got our fried chicken and it was about 8 pieces. We thought one plate would be good enough to share, but nope. For a bunch of gymheads around their late 20's and early 30's .. what were we thinking?? All of us tried a piece and then decided to each order a plate to ourselves. Seasoning was on-point! Meat was tender, juicy and crisp. \n\nWe came into consensus and agreed that the chicken here is the best thing on the menu. Proportions were a bit small each time we came and quite pricey (had an \"oh..\" look on our faces when the bill came out) but it's THAT great. Definitely recommend it to people or first-timers here.. it's a standard must to get their chicken wings.", "author": "David C."}

The food is pretty average for a Soju place, the kimchi fried rice, seafood pancake and fried chicken are all pretty good but not really special. They're not very generous with their side dishes (sometimes you have to ask) Soju drinks are also good price is pretty standard when compared to the other soju places in the area.

My mom and I walked down the street there last night hoping to have a great Korean food experience. Unfortunately, we were highly disappointed. I ordered the soft tofu soup with vegetables and it was extremely bland. Also, there were pretty much no vegetables in there. My mom ordered the short rib soup and was extremely confused - there were only bones in the soup, but no meat. She asked the waiter (who was actually very nice and attentive) where the meat was. He basically tried to tell her that meat is not supposed to go on short ribs. Funny, because every time she ordered short ribs or cooks with short ribs, there's always meat there. Her soup was $16.95 and it probably cost The Crew $0.50 to make... \n\nSadly, we will not be coming back and unless you want to pay a good amount of money for watered down, meatless soups - I wouldn't recommend this place.", "author": "Anastasia N."}

Nice flavor and nicely presented. \n\nSeafood Pancake - This was probably my favorite dish. It was nice and fluffy and flavorful. The slices were cut to a perfect size and is good to feed 4-6 people.\n\nDeep Fried Chicken Wings - Pretty good. I feel like chicken wings are a staple at a lot of late night korean spots. It was good. I kind of wish we got the sauce, but it was $2 extra. \n\nMozzarella stuffed Tonkatsu - Definitely did not taste like mozzarella. It wasn't bad though. When it came out, it was nice and hot. \n\nFREE Gyoza - We got these with a Yelp check in. Good tasty fried gyoza. I'd say order these if you like gyoza. \n\nOverall the food is decent.

A group of 7 before us were already waiting. I walked in to use the restroom and saw 3 tables open ... one of the servers told us to wait ten minutes. Okay...but why? Good thing it wasn't that cold outside, we would've freeze our butts off. \n\nFinally got a table but no menus were given. So all four of us sat there looking at other people's food. After we got our menus, looked through it and decided on what we wanted. We were eyeing the waitress but she didn't look our way. My bf even raised his hand and she passed but ignored him. The place is small but it was not even that busy. An \"I'll be right with you\" would've been great. At least I know you're not ignoring us! She finally came over to take our orders and that was about 10 mins later. -_-\" While taking our order, no smiles or greetings were given. What's up with that? I'm a paying customer and if you want good tips, you have to earn it! \nAnyway, we ordered a whole bunch of food. We had kalbi, jap chae, seafood pancake, deep fried whole chicken, tako yaki, beef bugolgi, and dol sot bi bim bop.  I can tell you that I didn't enjoy most of them. Every dish was overpowered by msg or something. It was so salty. The fried chicken was so dry, I asked the male server for lemon wedge to moisten it up. Didn't work. Jap chae had too much flavor but not in a good way. This was actually the saltiest dish compared to the others. Kalbi was on the tough side and I didn't like how it was marinated. The best part of the meal was the dol sot bi bim bop. Especially after I asked them to give me a raw egg that I cracked it in myself. \n\nNow about the service. The best part of this place was the service we received by the male server. He came by and checked on us and cleared plates. The female server...after she took our order, she never came back to check on us. I didn't really want to give her any tips. But this place seemed family owned, I'm pretty share the workers there share their tips. In the end, we did not tip bad and actually tipped 18% because the male server did his best to serve us, hence the extra star. I know why Yelp doesn't allow giving no stars because without that one star, you're not really rating the place. You're just writing a bad review but not rating the restaurant. So this restaurant gets two stars from me. I've bookmarked this place for a while now and finally tried it.

In addition, the jap-chae noodles were a bit under-done. However, I really liked the spicy pork. Super flavorful and not over cooked. Another thing was that my friend and I came here particularly to try the soju, but the \"bartender\" was out, so the whole soju menu (half of the drink menu) was basically off the list.

Two servers on a Sunday night, with a decent number of people waiting outside on a chilly evening. We were the next group at a party of 3, and I kid you not, we stood outside freezing our asses off staring at an empty table for ten minutes. The guy was super incompetent, he must have walked by that table at least twice and only stopped over there to take the money. It's like he refused to bus the dirty dishes and set up the table for the next group (us). It seemed like both servers were sitting behind the counter several times, either tending the register or refilling banchan. We eventually got let to another table that was empty after some time. They did apologize for the wait, and service started out friendly, but sometime during the meal it just randomly switched. On at least 3 separate occasions, we asked the guy server for a refill on the banchan dishes. After the first time, you think he either forgot or didn't hear the request, but after the third time he's just straight up ignoring your request. Whatever, let's ask the girl. She acknowledges our requests with a nod, never brings it to us. Look I get it if you don't serve refills on banchan. Some Korean restaurants don't, but express it to your customers so we're not asking 3-4 times and thinking that you're straight up ignoring us, because quite frankly that will affect your overall tip.\n\n\nFOOD:\n+ Gyoza: Free order with check-in. The dipping sauce is so mild you can't even taste it. But hey, it was free, I'm not complaining.\n+ Kimchi Fried Rice: decent portion\n+ Garlic Chicken Wings: One of their \"specialties\". It was good, not fantastic, but good.\n+ Spicy Tofu Soup (with beef): Probably my favorite of everything served, but super sad they don't serve an egg with it. Also surprised they don't give an order or rice with their soup too...\n+ BBQ Pork Belly: not a huge fan of pork belly.\n\nService was a huge downer for me. Considering there are other places to get better Korean food for the same price, I'd rather go where the service doesn't flat out ignore your requests...", "author": "Jenna H."}

Since it was lunch hours, the menu prices were very reasonable for the large portions that we received. In addition, we received the special deal of free gyoza when we checked in on Yelp. Overall, it was a very decent restaurant in terms of service.\n\nNow for the food. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't anything too special to me.

Not super amazing, but still hit the spot\nTurnaround: Good. Kind of empty actually.\nService: Good. Nothing to complain about.\n\nMy friends and I are frequent patrons to Korean restaurants because the craving for a seafood pancake or tofu soup sometimes hit us like a the pang of nostalgic memory from our homesick hearts. No, we are not Koreans, just a group of Asian girls who grew up in a pretty Asian-strong US city with plenty of good food all around (go Bay Area!). The pricing was comparable to any other Korean restaurant serving this kind of bar-like food so no complaints there. We ordered the seafood pancake, beef tofu soup, bulgolgi, and kimchi fried rice. The seafood pancake had a good variety of shrimp and tako, but came out a little mushy instead of crispy with not enough green onions so fell short on fragrance. The tofu soup was good and I could have gone with just the soup without the beef since the beef was a bit chewy and bland. The serving size for the soup was small and they did not offer a larger size, which was weird since Koreans, like any other Asian group, like to share their food. Next up, the bulgolgi was cooked to a tender and juicy consistency, but the flavor lacked the strong sweet marinated taste that I am use to with bulgolgi. The kimchi fried rice was good in its own right, but they only have us one small egg to go with the rice and the egg just was not raw enough to run all over the rice. We came early before dinnertime to an empty restaurant besides one other family so our food came rather quickly, which is good for us. The service was also fine since they had two servers and with only two tables to wait, we were offered enough attention for any water refill and clearing the tables promptly.", "author": "Jenny W."}

After pondering the menu for awhile, we ended up ordering the gal-bi tang (beef rib soup as recommended by the server) and the seafood pancake. He soon after brought us some nice hot cups of tea, a small bowl of edamame, and an assortment of banchan (pickled radish, fresh kimchi, steamed egg, brocoli and fish cake). They make the banchan in the kitchen and you can definitely tell. I normally don't care for pickled radish but the one they make here has a nice sweetness to it even though its still a bit spicy. The food came soon after. The gal-bi tang was very flavorful for being such a simple dish. It paired well with the bowls of rice and the banchan. The seafood pancake was delicious even though there could have been more seafood. The server was very attentive and made sure we liked the soup and our banchan was always refilled. \n\nNot sure who was playing the music but we were jamming to slow jams the entire time we were eating. Reminiscing about middle school/high school and singing along while we ate. \n\nThe tab came out to just under $30 before tip.

We had the mango soju, which at first tasted good (because of its sweetness) and then the after taste hit us. It had some sort of a sweetener after taste so it was clear that the mango soju was not made fresh but with some mango cordial. It was alright but I would probably try the yoghurt soju if I were to go again to avoid the \"fake\" taste. \n\nThe chicken karaage was pretty good. I like the dipping sauce that comes with it.", "author": "Felicia P."}

Both solid experiences! Service was pretty good. \n\nWhat I've tried:\n-Seafood pancake: OMG. This is so good. Perfect mix of chewiness + crispiness + super packed full of seafood goodness! I was really happy to get a good amount of shrimps, calamari, etc. \n-Garlic wings: I loved these, I think they're my favorite item so far. They're the sweet Korean glazed & fried chicken wings. The portion is really big, though, so I would share or get this when I'm very hungry.\n-Spicy ramen: VERY spicy! I only tried a little bit of this dish, I couldn't handle too much of it! \n-Pork belly: Good, nicely grilled up, and the pan was sizzling when it came out. Sauce was just right to pair with the meat. But the portion seemed a bit small compared to the price. \n-Potstickers: YUM! I got these free with Yelp check-in, LOVE it!!! They are nicely crispy and the sauce it's served with goes with it perfectly. \n-Sides: They give a good amount of them! I don't really remember them but I didn't have any complaints. \n-Rice bowl: A LOT of food, good portion for the price. I only tried a few spoonfuls of it but it was good. \n\nOverall, a nice place! It's open pretty late and has solid food.", "author": "Mary N."}

It's great in its level of spiciness, just like another place on Geary in the Outer Richmond that I had been somewhat regularly venturing to for satisfying the craving (although over there on Geary the young lady manager was cuter and more attractive :) ).  The one thing I think could improve is the lighting for the tables which have the large fume hoods above it.  Somehow the resulting darkness doesn't seem to have a good feel (at least in my opinion).", "author": "H K."}

This time we order the sweet and spicy whole chicken, kalbi, bibimbob and the spicy pork rib stew with potatoes and the free gyoza from checking in on Yelp. \nThe sweet and spicy whole chicken is just freaking yummy, and I would  order it again the next time I eat here -drools-! The kalbi was just as good but not better than the chicken. The gyoza is simple and well taste like every other gyoza I had eaten before haha but still good :d.  The hot pot.. was not as good as I thought, the soup is nice but I constantly taste the bean sprout from every sip of the soup. Maybe is because I don;t like the taste of bean sprout but it was decent~\n\nSeriously, this waiter has the best customer service..ever! He's friendly and would come by to ask us if we needed anything or if the food was up to our taste, refilling our water and tea.\n\nP.S Get the sweet and spicy whole chicken!", "author": "Jessica T."}

My favorite go-to Korean restaurant in the Sunset of San Francisco.  I usually order Spicy Ramen (with a side of lemon and Sriracha) or Sofy Tofu Soup and Kimchi Fried Rice.  Their fries are pretty awesome too (I know, I know, they're just fries but it's delish), ask for their karage sauce to go with it, you won't regret it :).  BBQ chicken is pretty good, ask for the sesame pepper dip, very good.  They usually know my order when I come it especially Jun, the lunch server.  He's great.  It's usually slow around lunch but dinner can be quite busy so be patient, the food is still great.  I'd go around 5:30-6 to avoid the busyness.  Their Kalbi and Japchae is pretty good too and of course their soju.  Not too sweet, not too strong, just perfect, try their mango.  Enjoy.", "author": "Dee L."}

The customer service here is great, very attentive and nice.  The food is pretty good, I'm waiting for it to get even better as time passes.  So far I've had the bulgogi, pork gyoza, jup chae, tofu steak salad and kimchee fried rice.  All were tasty but my favorite is the kimchee fried rice, mildly spicy with a great taste.  Their fruit soju was great as well, a little on the pricey side though.  Nice place to go when you're having a late dinner, open till 2am.  Their menu is still the soft opening one, so l'm looking forward to their permanent one.  If you were a fan of the old Pine Restaurant, you'll enjoy The Crew.", "author": "Peggy C."}
