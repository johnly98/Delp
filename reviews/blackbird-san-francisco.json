The Gang of Four song that was playing made us stop and look up (always on the lookout for a bar playing good music), and it looked inviting inside so - how about a nightcap? \n\nBartender (white or maybe Latino male, a little stocky) was really sweet and made us kick-ass drinks. \n\nThe music (deep cuts vintage new wave and punk) continued to be fabulous. Loved this place. \n\nThe only weird thing, that really has nothing to do with this bar, was that the next night it was more crowded as we passed by, some of their clientele was standing out on the sidewalk, and one young white guy loudly yelled \"guten tag, motherf***ers!\" at little ol' Irish and Italian-American us.

I honestly feel like this place is an awesome place to gather some friends and have a good ol time. \n\nIt's fairly spacious, lots of seating areas, a pool table towards the back, and bathrooms are actually pretty clean. Very intimate environment as far as lighting. Oh and how could I forget the music choice! I was dancing all night (in a chill vibe kinda way). They have a unique menu of cocktails which I was willingly to try (again I am not an avid drinker). The bartenders are fast and attentive. They were even handing out menus to the people waiting behind me. There's a huge menu on the wall so even if you didn't get a menu, it's not hard to find your drink of choice.", "author": "Trix P."}

The dim setting, swanky atmosphere with a neighborhood feel to it, makes this cocktail bar a great one. The paintings are unique, dark, but enticing. I love the large menu posted against the wall for everyone to see instead of fighting for a menu. They have a pool table and good music for others to dance & vibe to!\n\nTheir tables are cobble-stone which makes their interior decor super unique. I have to say, my favorite cocktail in SF right now is located in this bar and it's the Cold Brew Cocktail which is Verve's cold brew and a shot of bourbon I think? With a lemon peel mixed inside. It's definitely a unique cocktail with a strong punch. This cocktail is so far my favorite in the SF area!", "author": "Allister D."}

On a recent trip to San Francisco I've asked the hotel concierge where she would go for some nice cocktails on a Sunday and without hesitation, she recommended Blackbird. \n\nI went there with a friend around 10pm and it was fairly packed for a Sunday. The first 2 minutes we had to figure out if we had to sit ourselves, order to the bar or at a table (go to the bar and sit yourself). Once we figured it out, we picked a nice table close to the bar and the pool table in the back. \n\nThe bartenders were nice and were more than happy to suggest us some of their favorite drinks on the menu. They were extremely knowledgeable.\n\nIt is interesting to know that all the bartenders are making the menu together and try to pull something cohesive.

While I wasn't here on a date I can see how this would be a good first (or any) date. It's unpretentious, not too loud and has a very comfortable/cozy vibe. Plus service was really accommodating. There is also a pool table in the back if the conversation isn't flowing. \n\nI was here with a friend on a Sunday afternoon. We were here maybe an hour and in that time it went from four people in the whole room to a fully packed bar and a few people at tables. So you can tell this place is popular for good reason. While the decor and room are rather dark, being here in the middle of the day there was the perfect amount of light spilling in that I didn't feel bad about drinking at 4 on a Sunday (but let's be real I've never felt guilty about drinking on a Sunday). \n\nI ordered a beer on tap. My friend ordered the Pimm's which is pre-made and poured from a tap. We both felt it was a little overwhelming with the ginger flavor (couldn't taste much of the other flavors) so my friend asked for a little more Pimm's. The bartender let us know that since it was pre-made he wasn't sure if there was any Pimm's left. He went to check but they were out so he suggested soda water (this definitely made the difference). My friend then ordered Grand Marnier on the rocks. Despite the bar having many unique bottles of liquor, this was not a popular one so again he had to go in the back to search for the bottle. He could have easily said they were out but it was nice for him to go get it. Behind the bar is a cooler solely filled with oversized ice cubes. I really appreciate bars with giant ice cubes so your drink is never diluted. This alone would make me come back for cocktails. Plus I just really liked the names of some of the cocktails. \n\nI'm disappointed after living in the area for so long that this was my first visit. I'll definitely need to make up for lost time!", "author": "Tarah P."}

We met up on Saturday, March 5th around 4:15pm. It was pouring rain that day, so we easily found a table.\n\nHe ended up getting the Cool as ice: white whiskey, amaro nonino, vanilla, aveze ($10) and I got a Manhattan. I liked my manhattan as it wasn't too sweet. (I think they used rye? Sometimes I find bourbon a little too sweet.) Their specialty cocktail Cool as ice was different. Due to the vanilla, it reminded of ice cream. Granted, alcoholic ice cream, but my friend seemed to like it. Another friend showed up later and ordered an Old fashioned.\n\nThe space is nice. There's a long bar to your right when you walk in and tables along the wall to your left. I also saw a pool table in the back. The tables are kind of rustic. I think they were pieces of cut tree trunks, so I found placing my drink on the table a little scary. It's not a flat surface, so you've gotta be careful.

Have walked by numerous times, wondering what it was like inside, this was the perfect excuse to find out!\n\nBarrel-aged cocktails were the focus last Sunday eve. Some were so special, they had been aged for years instead of months! Boy does that add some extra flavor to your drink. Not sure if I am a mature enough drinker to handle the oak and medicine-like flavors, but it's fun learning to appreciate. If you are a Negroni or Fernet fan, Blackbird's versions will hit the spot!\n\nNot quite ready to dive into fancy cocktails that are a bit younger (like, straight from the tap), the Pilsner is quite good. And it's served in a giant mug. Can't go wrong with giant mugs ;) \n\nA little chickadee (not a Blackbird but something like it), told me that these guys are going to make some updates to the joint later this year, perhaps incorporating bar bites into the menu...

Both were fantastic drinks, and the rest of the drink menu looked tasy. We made our way to the back of the bar where the pool table resided. It was only one dollar per game, and there was no one else waiting, so we took our sweet time. \n\nWhen another group came to play, there were plenty of half booths for them to hang out at.

I came in here the other evening for a quick pop. I only had $10 in my wallet, and I knew that the bar was cash-only. Fortunately, they offer happy hour from 5pm - 8pm on weekdays. And much to my delight, one of their discounted drinks was an Old Fashioned (one of my personal favorites) for just $6. That's a steal!\n\nThere was only one bartender working the crowded room. But this guy was working his butt off. I saw him mixing two (maybe three) different cocktails at a time. With one hand he was stirring a drink, and with the other he was shaking a martini shaker. It was really quite a sight to behold - almost the equivalent of patting your head and rubbing your belly at the same time. In any event, I got my cocktail in a timely manner. It was very stiff and served with one of them trendy, overly-large ice cubes. It definitely hit the spot after a long day at the office.\n\nThe bar attracts an eclectic clientele. It's a nice mix of gay, straight, hipster, and neighborhood bar flies. There's nothing pretentious about the place. It's just a straight-up good bar.\n\nMy only complaint was that my $6 happy hour drink wound up costing me $10 because the bartender was too busy to give me change. But at the end of the day, the busy guy made me a damn fine cocktail, and it was worth every cent. \n\nLong story short - I will definitely be returning here the next time I'm in the hood.", "author": "Kevin B."}

No chit chat, no smiles. In the end I really did like my drink, but he could've been a little friendlier.\n\nShout-out to the cool dude checking IDs at the front - very chill, friendly, and I loved these awesome tattoos he had on his knees: one was the face of a lion/tiger, the other a dragon.

It's crazy the places you'll discover in San Francisco by just going out with friends!\n\nI came here for an old friends birthday. The place was packed, but by the grace of god we ended up located a cute little table by the window that fit us all. Slightly cramped, but adorable so. \n\nI ordered the spicy margarita. Well, I ordered 3 of them. They were delicious. The perfect amount of spice. They were strong to (which I love). \n\nOn top of that, the whole group took a shot of Tequila in honor of our friends 24th. The bartender gave us those shots for free. That was nice of him! \n\nPerhaps a little less than perfect because the place was a little too packed for me But, hey, you get what you get. The crowdedness of the bar didn't take away from the experience I had.", "author": "Alex G."}

They had some of the same drinks (old classics and favorites I assume) but they had a lot of new cocktails. I ordered the Silly Rabbit (vodka \"Trix\" syrup, grapefruit luxardo, licorice, soda) and my friend got the Shakedown (bourbon, pineapple, kahlua, orgeat, vanilla-orange bitters). Both were $8. Cash only.\n\nPlace was busy so the bartender was busy but he did a pretty good job at paying attention to his customers considering the rush.\n\nMy Silly Rabbit DID taste like Trix but it was strong enough for me to know it was alcohol.

You got it...\n\nTHE BEGINNING: HOW I CAME TO F*$# CAUTION AND TEST COURAGE\n\nTwo Labor Days ago, a very nerdy gay Asian male who had never been kissed made his way up north to San Francisco with one of his best friend.  If you didn't know San Francisco has a significant gay population, you should.  And that was why they went.\n\nHe told himself he wasn't going to let anything happen.  Complete lie.  He just didn't want his expectations high and be let down.  Deep down he knew if nothing happened, he would be disappointed.  \n\nIn a quaint dive bar, between the gayborhood and the rest of San Francisco, straights and gays mingled.  This place was hot.  The people were hot.  They were social.  And most importantly, they were fun.  The place was always crowded and for good reasons.  Great staff.  Unpretentious customers.  Classic drinks at affordable prices.\n\nIn this lovely bar, his friends tried to convinced him a hot barkeep was interested in him.  The barkeep was devastatingly hot and Asian boy thought himself average.  He ignored my friends because even if the barkeep was interested, he was too shy to make any move--especially with a guy way out of his league.\n\nIt was best to think Barkeep could never be interested.\n\nHowever, as they stayed longer and longer, there were subtle hints that Barkeep might have liked him.  The Barkeep was very helpful with his group.  One time as Barkeep was clearing the table,  he stole a glance and almost drop the glasses he was clearing.  After that, girl friends of Asian boy made him the \"drink order-er.\"  \"Go get me water, I'm drunk\" said his best friend.  Considering Barkeep wasn't the bartender, he went to take Asian boy's drink orders no matter where he was behind the bar.\n\nWhen his gay friends got jealous, they decided to move the group.\n\nBut his girl friends weren't going to let it go without one last attempt.  They tried to convince Asian boy to make a move.  But Asian boy got nervous and went outside and his girl friends followed.  One girl friend ordered her husband to chat up Barkeep and he did.\n\nThe husband reported back to Asian boy that the Barkeep said to go up and talk to him.  Asian boy wasn't convince this was the truth.\n\nThe confidence wasn't there.  One needs confidence, so nothing happened.\n\nI know, what a let down right?  Did you expect a gay story to end...gay?\n\nYes, if this was an opportunity, it was missed indeed.\n\nBut if one consider themselves smart, they learn.  And what one needs to learn here is to sometimes F#$@ caution and take chances.\n\nCourage is the watchword.  Without courage, they'll be plenty more missed opportunities.  Pride will heal, opportunities can't be reclaimed.\n\nI hope anyone who reads this and considers going to Blackbird, will do so--and that they will go in boldly and leave just as bold.  \n\nAnd with a guy.  \n\nOr girl.\n\nAnd a hot photo from the photobooth ($5 will give you two copies).\n\nForward two years ahead...\n\nHarmonie T and I came to Blackbird.

At the time, Blackbird wasn't very busy; only a handful of patrons were consuming libations at the bar. We took our seats and the female bartender provided us with some menus to peruse. \n\nImmediately, after looking at the menu, Blackbird ushered in memories of Noble Experiment in San Diego. It showcased similar types of unique cocktails that one can find at the forbidden Noble. You know, Noble Experiment, that rather ostentatious hole-in-wall (literally), at Neighborhood, that is overrated? To Blackbird's credit, I didn't sense an ostentatious ambience; rather, the only thing I sensed was a less-than-courteous demanor from the bartender. She seemed consumed with tending to her friend(s) that happened to be customers, and we, as I took it, ended up being nothing but distractions to her social life. \n\nNevertheless, we each had two cocktails. In all honesty, I wasn't very impressed. I remember ordering The Shakedown, a bourbon-inspired cocktail, and wasn't wowed. I moved on to the Silly Rabbit and was also underwhelmed. I don't know, perhaps ordering these types of specialized drinks are just not my cup of tea. Paying upwards of $10-12 for a cocktail should be memorable in a good way. Sadly, the drinks I had at Blackbird weren't. Maybe I should just stick to those drinks that I know will do my liver right everytime:  a vodka pineapple or margarita.", "author": "Gary R."}

Based on experience at other bars, I ask another question, \"Is it OK if I order drinks not on the menu?\" He responds, \"That's a really bizarre question. Look behind me, this is a bar. You can order whatever you want.\" [Again, what was with the attitude? We were the only 2 people there.]\n\nStrike 3: He gives us a minute, which gives me a moment to talk with my wife.

Out of all the places I tried I must say this is definitely one of the top places so far on my list. The drinks were delicious and unique. My drink had a bit of gin and cardamom which I thought was an odd mixture but turned out to be just great.

Came for the first time last night for a friend's birthday where he had a couple tables reserved. I ordered a gin and tonic which took almost 10 minutes to makes since the bartender kept taking other orders, closing out tabs and pouring other drinks in between adding each ingredient to my glass. I kept my tab open and ordered a few other drinks throughout the evening. When I went to close out, I gave my name to a different bartender and he couldn't find my card. After looking through all the cards and all over the register area they finally told me that they gave my card away to someone with the same last name. Which doesn't make sense cause if they had the same last name there should have been a card that they thought was mine...so that was a lie. They gave me a blank stare when I asked what I should do next.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-20", "description": "I suggested this as a place to meet up with a few friends, on a Monday evening, partly because I wanted to check it out, it was a central location, and the menu sounded interesting, plus they had some happy hour specials. And I scored parking right out front! But it was 6pm...on a Monday...\n\nWhat I liked about it included:\n- pretty cool space/interiors - mostly unique and fun\n- interesting and unique \"artisan\" cocktail menu\n- huge selection of craft beers\n\nWhat I did not like:\n- Cash only! I find this a dated concept, And LAME. I rarely use cash. I was lucky I even had enough on me to cover a few things. Just deal with the fees like every other business in the country. I suppose it's because they don't claim all of their sales, which I do not particularly respect. But then again, I don't really care why.\n\n- I partly selected this place because they did have some food items. When I asked a bartender about the food, she said that normally they have food, but since they were out of crackers, and pretty much everything included crackers, that there was no food being served. For reals?? She did mention it was ok to bring in outside food, but that is ridiculous that I should have to now leave to get something.\n\n- After a while, my friends were as hungry as I was, so one of them actually went to a store they knew of nearby, and we bought our own crackers. We then ordered the fava bean hummus/dip and the pimento cheese. The bean dip was ok - nothing special. I would say it needed some spices, but was a bit bland and did not have the flavors the menu professed. The pimento cheese was kind of gross. I don't like pimentos, but it seemed like barely a step above seriously processed cheese. The menu said it was a sharp cheddar. Didn't taste anything like sharp cheddar to me. On top of that, seeing as we supplied our own crackers, they refused to discount those items at all. I thought that was lame, pathetic, bad business and poor service. \n\n- Their \"artisan\" cocktail list is very interesting and unique, but to be honest, none actually sounded tempting. Obviously what people like, ranges, but every cocktail had at least 1, if not a few ingredients that I personally do not like. My friend did get one that was pretty good, but let's just say her second drink was a beer, so she didn't exactly love it.\n\n- Being Monday, starting fairly early in the evening, the music was way too loud. I could barely hear my friends. The volume was very unnecessary and irritating. *note - I'm a bit old, and the crowd was, overall, a good 10-15 years younger, but I appreciate a cool place (almost) as much as the next (much younger) person... \n\n- The wine list is minimal.\n\n- The tables are kind of cool - they look like they are cut from fossilized trees. But the surface is so textured, bumpy and uneven, I kept moving my glass around since it was tilting so much, in search of a more even area. It looked like something that should have been covered by a sheet of glass. The tabletop also tilted if you leaned on it, making it even more precarious.\n\nOverall, I cannot say I'd like to return. It's not all bad, but come on - there are a lot of options in SF that do the same thing a lot better, with much better service....", "author": "Dana L."}

Blackbird is just honest to goodness a great bar with a relaxed yet refined experience with mighty tasty drinks to boot! \n\nBut back to that whole capacity thing. I had the day off and made it to the bar around 4ish but did the rest of the folks make a beeline straight from work to the Castro, knocking aside anyone who stood in their way of getting after work libations? \n\nI wouldn't be the surprised because the bartenders take their time to make the delicious cocktails. \"My Clementine\" was a delicious citrus concoction with a subtle hint of honey that masks quite a bit of clementine vodka. Beer drinkers have no fear for they have a fantastic list of brews on tap ranging from Alaskan Amber to the ever delicious Brother Thelonius. Beers during happy hour run you between $3-5. \n\nMuch to love about Blackbird. I love the place, the people, and I definitely love the drinks. Must stop in if you're in the neighborhood.

Last night on September 27 at 7PM, it felt like the twilight zone- think more pretentious LA and lets just say more like a  northern neighborhood of SF starting with letter \"M\" than the middle of the Castro, where everyone is welcome.\n\nFirst, we sat at a mostly empty bar and the \"I am better than you because I am wearing a plaid shirt and I have tattoos\" pissed-off looking bartender (..you know the kind of guy I mean) promptly told us to move or we would be blocking the way (blocking whom, one may ask? The bar was almost empty) He then ignored us for whatever time it took for him to feel important...asked us what we wanted to drink and unceremoniously, with absolutely no eye contact, just about threw the drink at us (figuratively speaking, not literally).My friend visiting commented on how aggressive and dismissive his energy was. Maybe LA, maybe NY...but was this San Francisco?\n\nAll this could have almost been ingored were it not that a string of young scantily clad ladies and perhaps some of his \"homies\" came in shortly after for whom the rules of not sitting at a certain spot in the bar suddenly didn't apply and he was all smiles , flirts and welcoming gestures; allmost an exaggerated opposite response he had to me and my friend.  If you are looking for the kind of hyper masculine or maybe just hyper a--hole, exclusive vibe sadly invading San Francisco (and yes, even the Castro), this is the place. Having lived here for 11 years, I actually was saddened and embarassed to bring my guest here...we could have been anywere in the US, certainly not in San Francisco.\n\nI am polite, very well educated, and my momma taught me to say please and thankyou, and never to judge anyone.

I'm pretty sure we hit the best right off the bat! The bartender was amazing (man... I wish I wasn't so flighty on names...) and let us know about all the best ingredients. Gin, Campari and vermouth with a little orange zest.... simple right? Not really.... Apparently, he's a fan of the negroni, too so he filled us in on what he thinks makes the best negroni which I found to be very educational. Which led us to trying several different types of negroni to determine which we liked best... and we did find a winner.\n\nBeyond the awesome negroni and bartender, this place is really nicely decorated inside with red leather seats, white walls, and cool art on the walls. I really enjoyed being there. It was open enough (tall ceilings!) that even with a bunch of people, it didn't feel stuffy which is important if you're like me and hate crowds.\n\nOn thing I can say is that I will be back to try the Apple Cart (Applejack, rose vermouth, cassis, lemon and lavendar) because that just sounds A-MAZING but didn't sound like it went too well with the negroni feast we were having!

Once you get inside, you'll see that the place is packed and that you'll be waiting in line again for your drink. If you find something on the menu that sounds yummy, there's a definite chance that the wait will be worth it. Just be sure to watch those around you.

I was very pleasantly surprised by how friendly and helpful he was.   \n\nOf course, what people most care about when they go to a bar like this is that the cocktails are well made, the ingredients are of a high quality, and that they are served without serious attitude.  Blackbird passes all these tests and more. Fantastic drinks, friendly bartenders, nice atmosphere, and just all an around nice, mixed crowd.  This has easily become one of my favorite places for cocktails this year.", "author": "SL N."}

I do feel that I was over dressed though and will keep that in mind next time I'm thinking of dropping in but I'm not going to make this a destination location.

My two favorites are their Mint Julep, and their Rosemary's Fix (which I continuously miss-name Rosemary's Baby when I explain to friends and at the bar). Both drinks could be gone as their drink menu seems to change a bit over the year. \n\nThey have a good pooltable in the back with booths where you can relax with groups of friends. The clientele is mid-20s up to 40s, mostly well-dressed.

The cocktail I had was excellent and service was friendly and polite. However I am writing this review as I feel like I have been ignored several times during a busy night. I've done everything in the bar etiquette book in hopes of ordering a drink without being an annoyance to the bartender. I was right on the bar between two seated patrons.  I waited a solid 30 minutes without even a look while the area in front of  him was getting served like crazy.  I had already tried earlier in the night with the same bartender but I was behind someone for about 15 minutes before he gave up so I gave up too.  Yet strangely my friend who was dressed slightly nicer than me walked up and was able to order our drinks with no issues.  He didn't wave money or yell the guy just noticed him.   The bottom line was I liked this bar at one time but this second adventure put a bad taste in my mouth enough to write this review.  I was disappointed because I really wanted to try his drinks and enjoy them because I liked the care he put into everyone.  But it's just hard to enjoy anything when one feels ignored.\n\nAs a follow up I was written to and received a very sincere apology regarding my experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-12", "description": "As someone who prefers to drink at restaurant and hotel bars,  I have to say Blackbird is my favorite social spot in SF, and not just because it's a most welcome haven in greater Castro where one can get an actual cocktail (and not just a mixed drink).  The second time I came in, there were gaggles of people at the  bar, but Brent not only remembered my drink of choice (at the time it was a Blood and Sand), but what type of scotch I take.  Since then I've started roosting there 2-3 times a week, often before flying south for dinner in the Mission.\n\nWhat makes this bar unique is that it's a natural habitat for two very different species: those who want to grab a bottle of Miller High Life and shoot pool with their buddies, as well as those who prefer to discuss French symbolist poetry over a Death in the Afternoon.  In a town where birds of a feather tend to flock together, this is a refreshing change of scene.\n\nA few things you should know about the aviary before you alight upon a stool:\n\n- The crow bar is not a gay establishment.  Sure there's a fair share of coxcombs preening in the window on any given night, but it's not exactly La cage aux folles either.  The crowd is always mixed, and it's actually not a bad place to meet people.\n\n- Right now the bar is CASH ONLY but there is an ATM available.\n\n- The discerning ornithologist should know that if you don't ask for spirits by brand, they are going to pour WELL liquor, even in their specialty cocktails (and it's not the kind of place that has Bluecoat and Bulleit in their well, either).   I made that mistake my first time in the bar, then quoth this raven \"Nevermore!\"\n\n- Take a gander at the menu, and you'll notice that just about everything is on the sweet side.   Even their version of the Negroni (generally a bitter drink) borders on cloying.  This is not to fault the bartenders in any way, since the clientele seem to like their drinks that way.  However, if you prefer your cocktails on the dry side, just ask.  You won't ruffle anyone's feathers.  And nothing says you have to order from the menu.  Most of the bartenders are happy to wing it if you tell them what you like.\n\n- When it's busy, don't even think about ordering anything \"up\" unless you plan to perch at the long shelf adjacent to the front door.  Otherwise you will end up wearing most of your $10 Paloma cocktail. \n\n- After a long day of work, TIffany is a regular Florence Nightingale, both for her barside manner and her uncanny ability to concoct potent elixirs to ease your every ill.\n\nA welcome addition to the neighborhood, and a strong 4 and a half stars.  A little more variety on the menu (add one or two clean, balanced cocktails) and a better wine list (although, seriously... who comes for the wine?) would make it five.", "author": "Sven E."}

Its relatively new ('09 is when it became the blackbird post a remodel and new ownership), and ever since its stock has risen while the Castro has gone kind of toe up in reputation among the younger crowd who wants to avoid badlands-esque joints.\n\nFirst off, is Market and Church really the Castro? Blackbird goes beyond the typical Castro vibe. Its a neighborhood bar that is just that: a real bar, with real locals, and real drinks (although some are a bit too sugary for my taste). I think deep down we all wish that this 'neighborhood' was our actual lives... because the real bar is really awesome, the real locals are really hot, and the real drinks are really good.\n\nThe place feels like a dive bar that somehow caught on and became trendy and hip. The crowd is stylish and put together, but also laid back enough to have that after--venturecapitalist--work vibe.\n\nPool tables in the back are a nice touch. I love the walls plastered with SF history through newspapers, and the brown butcher drink menu done on paper rolls pulled down off the walls. Another great touch is the actual mild mix of straight guys and the dash of females that find themselves frequenting the spot of the summer. Other positives include a decently regulated door, a huge drink menu, fresh ingredients, friendly bartenders, and the occasional latenight tamale lady. \n\nDon't know where to go tonight?

In 3 words, I would say it's an more like an upscale dive bar. \n\nIn terms of their drinks, their beer selection was very impressive, and their cocktails were unique yet classic. Their prices are somewhat on the steep side as an out-of-towner, but probably pretty standard for the area. Coming from the Tucson bar scene, I was very impressed with Blackbird and will be sure to make another visit next time I'm in town.", "author": "Emily F."}

And more importantly, enjoy well-crafted cocktails and microbrew beers. \n\nMuch has been said of the specialty cocktails, and with good reason. They are really good! The hand-drawn menu recalls a time of yesteryear, as do some of the exotic ingredients. Who even knew there was such a thing as \"tobacco bitters?!\" The bartenders are all knowledgeable, friendly, and highly-skilled in the art of mixology. \n\nThe daily happy hour is amazing, and a great introduction to the Blackbird scene, though at times incredibly crowded; something to keep in mind if you're looking for a quiet place to relax after work. \n\nAnother nice touch is the revolving artwork by local artists, which usually incorporates some sort of San Francisco imagery. \n\nAttractive on multiple levels, Blackbird draws a very mixed crowd, though its proximity to the Castro generally means that the gay crowd is well-represented. But this is almost always balanced by the presence of plenty of other gay-friendly folk, all enjoying the warm, welcoming enclave that is Blackbird.", "author": "Kevin O."}

So disappointing. \n\nUpon entering, things looked promising. Lively, pretty mixed hipster-type crowd, interesting space, might be a little loud for some but good energy overall. Also looked like they offered some delicious (sounding) libations along with a good selection of beer. \n\nWhen we attempted to pony up to the bar, that's when things went south. There were throngs of customers trying to get some refreshment in a somewhat chaotic fashion. Nothing really different from many other bars that serve the same ratio of patrons with not too many problems. At Blackbird, however, I saw 3, struggling and stressed-looking bartenders trying mightily to fill out the orders as fast as they could - they were certainly working hard for their tips. But in order to make the complicated drinks Blackbird features, their system seemed to be off - waaay off! After waiting about 20 minutes in line and getting sadder and sadder looking at the poor staff being overwhelmed by their task, I was finally number 2 in line. I thought, at last, I'll get my tasty brew and all will be fine in the universe again. Wrong. Just then, the guy in front began to order about 10 of those \"fine\" drinks for himself and his friends; a task that would probably take another 10 minutes, and that's when I realized: no, this just isn't meant to be. I didn't blame the guy in front of me, he had waited the same amount of time and why not order for his party once there. But not only was I depressed about the poor souls trying as hard as they could to make their drinks, I was also not wanting to add to the drama by getting annoyed or adding any more anxiety to the situation. No, Blackbird and I just did not click, not on this evening anyway, and probably not on any other evening to come. We left to  find another watering hole that was simply less stressful! \n\nSo sad for the heroic staff there, but, really Blackbird, please tweak your system - your purpose in life is to bring some comfort to the world, not add to its anxiety.

Though I knew from its Castro location that it would not live up to the standards implied by its logo, Lady Pestlebottom and I happened to be wandering by and decided to stop in for a drink. It's not often we're in the Castro, you know. For good reason - the crushing and overwhelming modernity of it all. \n\nIt was not as terribly obnoxious as most Castro watering holes, but I found the decor uninspiring, the patrons bland and without style or character, and the overall atmosphere loud and busy, yet boring. The last time I had patronized this particular space was when it was somewhat of a sports-oriented dive (albeit a clean sort of dive). The place is completely unrecognizable now. It's terribly, horrifyingly \"hip,\" as many here have pointed out. \n\nThe beer selection consisted mostly of craft beers which I've never heard of (so hip!), so I decided to be adventurous and try the one named after moving-picture actress Tallulah Bankhead.

Lady Pestlebottom ordered some overpriced, fruity libation which she enjoyed, which she now conspires to make at home (just as I did with the delicious and even more overpriced cocktail at the even more nauseatingly hip Bourbon & Branch). \n\nThe barmaid was very nice, so that's something.

The place was well lit and clean. In terms of the customers, there was a good mix of the typical San Francisco demographics. The drink menu was written on butcher paper and taped up behind the bar. The noise level was decent - and I had no trouble hearing my friends. After taking in the sights and sounds for a moment, I headed off to order drinks. \n\nOn the plus side, the bartenders was very friendly. The wait at the bar wasn't too long. I was surprised to find they had Sudwerks beer on tap since that's more of a Davis/Sacramento thing. The dirty martini and the Manhattan I ordered was mixed relatively well. No complaints from my friends - other than they didn't serve Grey Goose. \n\nOn the down side, I was surprised that a place that wasn't trying to be a dive bar didn't take plastic. Given the prices for drinks weren't on the cheap side, you'd think they'd let you swipe. Let's face it, we all end up drinking more than we intend to but we usually only bring enough cash to pay for what we intended to drink. \n\nOne interesting feature of this bar is the newspaper \"wallpaper\" they have up.

The lighting was soft and inviting to the eye.  The petrified wood tables added a nice touch to the seemingly sailor jaunt the place could have been back in the 1800s.  The layout is long and narrow: bar on the right, seating on the left--seemingly reminiscent of similar bars in NYC.\n\nThe drinks here are good, especially taking into consideration of the fresh ingredients they have available for the drinks.  I did notice that the bartender was able to make my drinks, and if he didn't know he quickly found out from another bartender (my Kentucky mint julep for example), and learned my shot later, buffalo sweat, was bourbon and Tabasco.  I will say the bartender was rude at one point, and is part of the reason why knocking them a star.  If you start out asking me what I'm ordering, and then immediately turn to the person next to me and flirt with her before coming back and asking me what my drink is again, I'm not going to be a happy camper.\n\nThe other point I didn't really care for was when the place got packed.  It was really hard to move throughout the bar, and it took a fair amount of time to get through the crowd to actually get another drink.\n\nThe crowd here is mixed, yet is certainly well-balanced from what I could tell.  For this seemingly being a straight/gay bar, it seemed to lean slightly more towards gay scene.

Places like this need to recognize what they want to be.  They are a bar, where one can tolerate a moderate amount of noise but ultimately chose this over a club for more relaxing reasons.\n\nNevertheless, after my second beverage (3rd of the night) i was much relaxed and briefly confused my Monday for a Thursday; the night you recognize you have work the next day but increasingly care less with each drink.

We should have stayed at Blackbird! \n\nI was here in the evening the other day,  and I loved the ambiance here, especially the old newspaper on the walls. \n\n   I agree with what other people have said about the shaky small tables that have the uneven surfaces -- seems funny to put ridged tables where people want to set down their tiny, preciously mixed drinks.  The low tables and chairs also made me feel like I was at an elementary school parent-teacher conference, but it made it easy to have a good relaxing conversation with my drinking companions.  \n\nI guess I just am not sure about $6.50 for a  Dogfish IPA; seems a bit on the high side for a bar. I go out in the neighborhood all the time and feel like I don't pay more than $5 for a microbrew.  Maybe I do.

Which is absolutely fine. I don't expect that every bartender know how to make relatively obscure cocktails.

I should have known starting with a line at the door, for a bar, on Market Street, a cartwheel away from Lucky 13? REALLY? The space is realllllly dimly lit. Maybe too dimly lit I have horrible eyesight and I'm aged. Some chick was screaming multiple times about doing meth /being on meth /offering people meth.

They create drinks that I thought I liked and now love.  I had a Sidecar tonight.  I've had many (and I mean many) Sidecars previously and none have tasted quite as good/sweet/tasty as tonight's.

I am doing it because I LOVE Blackbird and I had such a fantastic experience there. It's really refreshing to see a new Castro bar with such an amazing style. The interior design of the bar is modern and industrial -- I love the ambient lighting, the newspaper wallpaper, and the gray washed wood panels. The place looks really upscale but it's not intimidating. The crowd is friendly and mixed, not sleazy at all. There are gays, straights, and everyone seems to be having a good time. The bartenders were extremely nice and talented. I was surprised to find out the special cocktails were $8 and under. I had the Aviation and it was super tasty.\n\nIt is by far my favorite bar in San Francisco. There is no way it gets less than 5 stars. I'd recommend Blackbird to anyone that is visiting or a local looking to have a great evening out.", "author": "Cathy L."}

I have nothing against the dive it was before, I love dives, but this new bar was a little lighter, a little bigger (hey must have knocked out a back room or something), and a lot less dreary.  \n\nI also find that a bartender can really make or break a place, and the guys here made it.  They were extremely nice, patient and made a mean cocktail (and reasonably priced ones at that).  And the dark wood bar against the light wall was striking.  I also liked that although it was a Saturday night, we all got a seat.  And it had a nice friendly vibe and so close to my house.  I'd definitely go back there again.", "author": "Suzanne A."}

Offers some pricy drinks considering that almost most bars around the area offer discounted drinks or 2for1 specials during happy hours. I usually stick to Coronas and they're never part of any specials or happy hours at any place.  Almost $6-8(including tip) for a Corona is not acceptable. So I guess I have to downgrade to domestic beer if I want to stick to a budget.\n\nI have been to this place a few times during Happy Hours and saw no signs advertising their Happy Hours or their specials, I didn't notice any signs but a big blackboard menu listing well & fancy drinks, although some of them very tasty; I've ordered a few of them.\n\nI would go to this place maybe a few times a year.  With $12 I can have 4 beers at Toad Hall, Badlands, or Midnight Sun and see just as many cute guys, besides, I do need the variety or would get bored if I always frequented the same place.\n\nI only found out last night that they do offer Happy Hour Specials, only by asking, otherwise it's promoted and most people don't know about it.\n\nHere's some quote:\n\n\"We do offer well cocktails with 1 liquor and 1 mixer=soda or fresh squeezed juice for $3.  We also offer for  Sours $4 made from scratch.  Tap Beers range from $3-4.50 depending on what you order.  House White $4 or Red $5.

My brother and I went there and got pretty sloshy off just two of their drinks. My brother knows how he likes his drinks and directed the bartender as such. Our bartender Nancy was amazing. She mixed it perfectly and had a great hand shake. She was patient and chill. And to be very honest, I've never enjoyed a Manhattan more than Nancy's. \n\nBlack bird was very enjoyable, because all around me, there was something cool to look at. People were doing their own thing, Tom Edison style bulbs lit the mahogany bar, a simple menu written on parchment, and warm red accents added to an overall encompassing environment. Very nicely done. \n\nDon't taint this place or I'll cut you. Only reason I am dropping down a star is because of the clientele; there were some drunk a holes. Not totally Blackbird's fault but I would have cut them off sooner.  Still, amazing.", "author": "Yvannia P."}

The decor is deliberately rustic chic, which could easily have looked like a stodgy bar my Grandfather would have gone to without the elegant touches that makes this probably the best decor of any Castro gay bar (even beating Trigger in some respects). \n\nI went once on a Monday evening, when it was pretty busy (on a Monday, no less!), and again on a Friday when it was jam packed. As other reviewers have mentioned, if you push past the knot of people in the front, there's a bit more space farther inside. It's a nice place to meet friends and visit, but also surprisingly easy to mingle despite the long bench and rows of chairs. Another excellent addition to the Castro.", "author": "Kevin G."}

Were gonna hit our neighborhood spots Martuni's or Zeitgeist, but decided to walk a few blocks and finally check out Blackbird. \nA female bartender made our drinks, and she was very eager to answer any questions about the many fascinating ingredients used in their signature cocktails. I had the Blackbird Cobbler (Tawny Port, Frangelico, OJ, Apple Butter, with an orange zest) which I proceeded to make love to. It was devilishly delicious and SO complex...the layers just kept going and going! Next I had the Bitter End, which was so beautiful we had to take a photo. The egg white froth was perfect - what a sexy looking drink. And the flavor - whoa...once again, great layers, refreshing on the front and slightly bitter and tannic on the end. So so pleasant.\nMy companion had the Northern Star which was really well balanced and layered, and something else with overproof Bourbon that he described as a \"man's drink\" - quite liquor driven but delicious.\nAtmosphere was great, not too hipster-y, but filled with 20-30 somethings drinking micro brew beers and well-made cocktails. And there's a pool table in the back if you wanna do more than just drink. \nOnly cons were we wished the lights were lower - it could be even sexier than it already is, and one of the bartenders (maybe a barback?) was absolutely hammered drunk and being kind of obnoxious...really unprofessional. Luckily his female coworker made up for it.\nNew menu comes out in April - can't wait to go back and try the new round!!", "author": "Tanya K."}

Unfortunately in our party of eight only two people said theirs were strong enough - and neither the margarita nor the long island iced tea were part of the bar's own menu.\n\nThe men's toilet is just bizarre. An unlockable door opens from the seating area into a very smart room where nevertheless the sit-down toilet is totally open to everyone else. You could literally see someone wiping their butt from your seat in the bar if you're unlucky.\n\nOne of the bartenders withheld change from our party to take her tip, which is totally not ok. We were all of course going to tip the bartenders, but the tradition is - you give us the change, we tip you, not you keep the change and spare us the bother of deciding whether you earned one.\n\nDespite all that I really want this bar to succeed as it's a smart addition to the area.

The Clementine I had was light , well balanced and made me feel I had found a true weapon of choice I could turn to over and over again .\nAlso I have found fewer and fewer bars that have a happy hour that goes on till 8 , which is a godsend and for me totally justifies the going up market from Soma- which I am sometimes too lazy to do unfortunately . \nAll in all I have to give them 5 stars because for this bar-going happy hour-man they have truly hit the high note on every level making me a fan who will be coming back with a friend or 2 and a good deal of  money to be spent on a tour of the cocktail list.\n\nCheers !\n\nB", "author": "bill h."}

Randomly went in with a friend who I was meeting at Church and Market, and was glad we did.  While it definitely has that \"brand new\" smell, they've done a great job with it, and the vibe and decor are suitably mellow and eclectic.  They have an awesome selection of beers and wines, and the crowd was full and energetic without being overwhelming (this was on a Friday night).  Highly Recommended.\n\nBy the way; about 2 hours into our visit it was mentioned to me that the bar \"might be\" a \"gay bar\".  Okay - it's near the Castro, so that's just going to be part of the crowd.  If you can't deal, don't go.

You know who you are. You favor plaid, have greasy brown hair that you wear in a wannabe Justin bieber style. You aren't that tall. Just, ugh, hipster from some sad Midwestern place who thinks he's cool now. Sorry, go home because I don't need any more idiots invading my state. So the trouble began last Friday.  We were drinking til the bartenders ring the gong announcing last call. We were sitting at a table minding our business when the beiber-haired guy swoops down and without even asking, picks up any and all glasses that my group of friends are not holding in our hands.  At 2am on the dot, I'm still finishing my drink but he says that we have to leave immediately. Ok, so I chug it. A friend heads to the bathroom to use the facilities before we head home. The rest of my party  hangs out near the door but stay inside.  It's a chilly night and a few of us in our party have some heavy bags with us as they had just arrived from the airport.  But the greasy man tells us that we need to leave, and when we say we are just waiting for our friend to finish using the bathroom he says we need to wait outside. Fine. Whatever. It's definitely a dick move, but not  the worst thing ever. Then hipster boy does the worst thing ever. He goes into the bathroom to find my (male) friend as he is using the facilities to tell him he needs to leave. Literally finds him in the bathroom and tells him it's time to go home. \n\nNow, if we were drunk or obnoxious or causing fights, I would understand. We had had about 2 or three drinks each, and her generally respectable adults in our 30's, the majority of  whom are administrators or professors at the university level, so not exactly your rowdy college aged frat boy. But apparently, the staff at blackbird thinks it is perfectly acceptable to snatch drink glasses from you as you are sitting peacefully and to seek out a patron using the facilities to kick us out of the bar at exactly 2am. \n\nThe ridiculous thing is that I've spent years waiting tables, and last call usually means you will no longer serve more drinks or food, but you still need to wait until the last customers finish up, and you certainly don't go into the bathroom to rudely tell people to get out. Staying at teh restaurant past the posted closing time is part of the job, and if you don't like it, and are going to treat customers poorly if they aren't out exactly at closing time, you may be in the wrong business. Or, maybe I was just working at the wrong kinds of restaurants. \n\nWhatever the case, following my friend into the bathroom to drag him out of it, irregardless of whether he was at a urinal or in a stall or just washing his hands, is highly inappropriate and management really needs to reprimand this unprofessional idiot. \n\nIf management is reading this, he was working the evening of Friday April 20th. But the bartender who helped me that evening was amazingly kind and gracious and skilled to boot! She rocks! She was working the end of the bar closest to the door. Definitely a keeper.

All of my friends LOVED Blackbird!  An enjoyable time was had by all, due to the FRIENDLY service, the QUALITY of the drinks,  the stylish DESIGN & good MUSIC & lighting.  We made our way down the Specialty Cocktail menu:  My personal favorite was the Grape Drink (muddled red flame grapes, tequila, peach bitters, agave syrup & sparkling wine.)  I appreciate the agave nectar and not the processed simple syrup that most bars would use for sweetners.  I also tried the Pina Colada, Sidecar & Early Bird which I enjoyed as well.  The Early Bird is very light and refreshing.  If you don't want an alcoholic drink, try a wine soda!  Yummy!  Next time I go, I'll start with the Grape Drink then an Early Bird and finish with a wine soda!  During both of my visits, I appreciated that the music was a mix of genres other than the typical \"Techno or Dance\" you find at \"other\" bars.  Also, I liked that there was a nice mix of both friendly male and female bartenders too!  Some of my friends played pool and commented that the pool table was a good one and that it must be new.  There is a photo booth in the back that I will definitely use the next time!  FYI, I didn't notice a sign in the front, so look for lots of windows & large plants on each side of the front door.

It's a nice bar, meaning well conceived design, with a bent of urbanity, but still very comfortable and friendly bar staff.  Does gay make everything better?  This could be case study number 1,000 concluding: yes!  Their bar snacks come from clean, monitored glass wear, empties are cleared promptly, the specialty drinks cross a gambit of classics re-envisioned (try the Blackbird special, like my fave, the French 75, but with a hint of elderflower), to the tried and true (a Bloody Mary with chipotle and a salad of accoutrements), and a decent wine selection to boot.

But think they're loosing their way with the drink menu. Was a true believer in their original concept of updating traditional cocktails. It's sad when I went by tonight and read a list of eight cocktails and none of the new additions were appealing. Actually tried a couple and wasn't swayed. They struck me as gimmicky. Stick to the classics and don't get caught up in the mixologist frenzy.", "author": "Chuck R."}

The interior is nicely decoroated and has a much classier look than any of the other neighboorhood bars. The drinks are great, and the crowd is typically a lot of fun as well. Not to be missed!", "author": "Ryan B."}

I don't like bars. i dont really like to drink, and even when i did, i need more stuff to do. Blackbird is a bar's bar. I went there for a couple minutes last Saturday. We were supposed to be going out dancing, which got downgraded to a random bar with music, and that got downgraded to this new bar in castro. I had no idea it existed. It is in the spot where metro used to be, after metro had moved out of the spot Lookout is in now. So, its pretty close to BOC. The door woman was nice. Inside, it's a bar. There was some very low music playing, something countryish or I don't even know... I couldn't hear it. Even though it was Saturday, there was not even a pretense of going for the music. There was a pool table or 2 I think. It's not pretentious or yucky looking, just middle. I don't know how the drinks were. If you like going to drink with friends, and just stand there and talk to your friends and drink, then just stand there and drink some more, go here. It seems very good for that.  I don't like that, so I wont. But if you do, you should. It's a very bar-ry bar.", "author": "Merredith L."}

I finally made my maiden voyage to Blackbird this weekend, and wonder why it took me so long.  This place is great...it's like Bourbon and Branch without the exclusivity.  I'm a big fan of the classic cocktails revival, so seeing drinks like The Last Word and Aviation (properly mixed with Creme de Violette!) listed on the quaint hand-written-on-butcher-paper drinks list made my evening.  I've been to many bars (including those who should know better) whose knowledge of a mixed drink starts and ends with a screwdriver that it's so nice to know someone can do cocktails right at a neighbourhood venue.  And speaking of neighbourhood, the clientele is a nice mix of gay and straight (and probably Bi and TS/G, to cover all bases) which really creates a nice atmosphere.  AND, kudos to the designer who hung those Edison bulbs over the bar.  Really cool!", "author": "Tom R."}
