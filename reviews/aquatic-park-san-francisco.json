{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-06", "description": "Aquatic Park is a great place to get in an open water swim and then grab a bite in the area afterwards.\n\nPros:\n-Protected cove w a buoy line and lots of other landmarks to use for navigation/sighting.  \n\n-Relatively clean...it IS the bay, so you're not going to get pristine waters with 70 ft visibility (go to Tahoe for that - it's totally worth it!), but the beach is pretty clean, there aren't usually visible trash or pollutants in the water and the bottom isn't full of slimy weeds in the shallow area.\n\n-Parking before 10 is easy.  Admittedly later than that, it can get challenging.  In desperation, there are parking structures very nearby.\n\n-There are several post swim options nearby in Ghiradelli Square for brunch, hot chocolate etc.\n\n-It's never all that crowded in the water, even if there is a race from Alcatraz or the like going on.\n\n-You really can't beat it on a warm sunny day--the bay looks gorgeous and Alcatraz and the Marin headlands are a great backdrop for swimming.\n\nCons:\n-When the parking is difficult, it contributes to people sharking for spots.  I'm never a huge fan of being stared at by someone waiting for my spot while I basically get naked in public.\n\n-If you're not a dolphin club member, there really aren't any facilities for you to use like at a lot of public beaches.  But, never fear, you'll get good at changing in the parking lot at your car.  \n\n-It's cold, but not bad if you're prepared.  Some brave souls swim without wetsuits, but a full wetsuit, silicone cap and goggles and you'll warm up after about 5 minutes of swimming.\n\n-Two sea lions live in the cove.  Most of the time they stick themselves and hang out on the west side; occasionally they like to join the swimmers in the buoy line. While some may view them as a pro, I like to keep my distance in the water...they seem a lot bigger and less friendly when you're face to face with them in their living room.  I'll admit, they are pretty cute--especially from shore.", "author": "Sara E."}

It's a great place for open water swimming for all levels. The water is usually calm and relaxing. There are 5 buoys parallel to the beach and what I have been told is that 3 loops equal a mile. Swimmers go either direction and mind their own business. \n\nBesides swimming, on weekends you may see groups of people exercising on the bleachers. Cyclists,  runners/walkers and tourists pass through the area frequently, as the wharf is not so far away. \n\nAcross the street is Ghirardelli square. So after a nice swim you can have instant gratification by ordering a sundae or some hot chocolate. Oh yeah! \n\nPublic bathrooms are not far since its on the other side of the museum but if your heading for some dessert, there are restrooms also located in Ghirardelli Square. Parking maybe a challenge on weekends. Van Ness street gets pretty packed quickly since its free for 4 hours or else there is metered parking for .25cents per half hour..

It has a barrier wall that keeps the big waves out .  Though, I did spot a sea lion today on my way walking there. I must say it looked very cute when I was on land watching,  however it gave me a few goose bumps when I encountered it in the water.  Often times, sea lions leave you alone. So this was my first encounter after many years of training in the bay.\n\nOther than sea lions, there's no other problem. Swimmers are nice, pleasant and courteous.  Everyone minds their own business unless you want to start a conversation with them. \n\nOne tip: use a wetsuit if you have no experience swimming in the bay. The water can be cold.  If you indeed want to swim without a wetsuit, make sure you understand that your body will need a little time to adjust to the cold temperature.  Don't stay in the water without a wetsuit for more than 20 minutes on your first swim, you will get hyperthermia.  I've seen someone get hyperthermia during my training a few years ago.

We actually found a spot or two that weren't too far from the entrance.\n\nNot sure if I should call this a dock but I feel like I want to call it that so here it goes.

Looking for a different venue for my tri training (usually train at Shadow Cliffs in Pleasanton) This was magnificent! I loved it! It's unbelievably scenic and truly exhilarating( i went on a Saturday morning about 8 AM. There was a wonderful amount of swimmers out there, and I just loved it. \n\nThere is free four hour parking at the very end of Van Ness Ave. One downside, is that before 10 AM there were no open restrooms, and I really wanted to change out of my wet stuff afterwards. I finally went behind everything up to Ghirardelli Square, followed the orange signs until I found the rest room deep in the bowels of Ghirardelli Square. \n\nThat said, the swim itself was magnificent! There were buoys you can swing back-and-forth for a sixth of a mile each way, or you can go around the perimeter I have heard it said somewhere from three quarters of a mile to a mile. The swimmers these know the deal and they're happy to tell you.\n\nIt's nice, because it is cold, ocean, saltwater, but really no waves. This is especially plus for beginning open water swimmers. It's like a step between the lake, and the ocean. I was so excited and I can't wait to go again. There are terrific scenic hiking trails and lots of great cycling there too, if you want to do some bricks.\n\nThe only concern I had was where to leave my car key. I got lucky, because there was a little tri club starting off there and they had no problem letting me leave my gear there under their watchful eyes. Other people do things like leave everything in their car, and set their key on top of the tire wheel. Actually, from this point I decided to buy a little open water swim buoy, which trails behind you, and hold your keys too. That would have made the whole thing complete.\n\nDon't neglect this excellent spot for open water swimming!

It was a great day to swim since the water was not cold at all. It felt like I could have just swum in my jammers. It was a sunny morning and the waters temperature felt like the one of local pools at Sava, Balboa, etc. I did about 2 turn arounds from one end to the last buoy  by the docks. I continued swimming until I saw something floating conspicuously in front of me. I thought to myself that it was just another swimmer, but I was curious so as I got maybe 20 feet away from it, I removed my tinted goggles and saw that it was a SEA LION!!!! I was super ecstatic! It was like seeing a bear in Yosemite! The sea lion was about my size and had pretty long whiskers. Although I was pretty stoked, I started feeling paranoid thinking that maybe a shark or maybe the sea lion might try to bite me, so I continued swimming cautiously, stayed closer to the shore and swam further to the right of it. After swimming a few yards contemplating whether I should continue swimming, I finally decided to swim back to shore, even though there were still many other swimmers there too. I was too paranoid and I wanted to make it to the Summerthing Alice Radio concert anyway haha. I love swimming here and got nothing but respect for the sea lions and their home :D \n\nThis is the best place to train oneself in getting used to the choppy and cold waters for Escape From Alcatraz (which I will one day be competing in) or Orca Alcatraz Challenge (I am attempting on August). \n\nEnjoy the beautiful area!\nJay Ray", "author": "Jray M."}

I've been wanting to try open water swimming for a long time now and today I mustered up the courage to go to Aquatic Park to swim! I almost hate to say it because I would not want to see it get crowded with swimmers but it's not that bad. It's actually kind of a neat and very exhilarating feeling you get from swimming in the cold water without a wetsuit.\n I waded in at first until the water was almost up to my waist and then dove in. My first thought was f**k it's cold!! But then after a few minutes or less, not that long really I got sort of used to it. The temperature was even easier to deal with than the mild chop that was on the water today. \n I've been practicing alternate breathing (being able to take a breath from either side) while swimming laps in the pool to get myself ready for open water but it's not the same. You have to be able to time your breathing with the waves and I was having trouble doing so. I ended up getting a lot of water in my mouth. I tried swimming mostly backstroke but since I'd seen a jellyfish (it's rare to see just one) and I didn't want to hit any I kind of did a  backstroke and turn to look ahead and then back again which I'm sure looked funny from shore to the more experienced swimmers. \n Hey, I'm new at this and I don't mind if it looks obvious. I'm out here doing it and I will be back.
