While you're waiting for your food you're thinking how the beige vinyl booths could be in a more appealing color (really now, beige?);  how the collection of mismatched white boards could be replaced by one large black board with some deft chalk drawings in the margins.  There is SO much you could do to improve the decor (which is more than dated) then again it's also clean, unlike Moulin Rouge down the street, which is why we came here in the first place.\n\nSo, the food.   It's okay, I mean it's breakfast.  Some places can make breakfast into vacation food, or, like the Claremont Hotel, into bland spa food for dainty dieting socialites.  Here it's just breakfast.  I had a cheese burger which was a good basic burger, but nothing close to the one at Belcampo.  I had country potatoes with it, which were nicely seasoned and well cooked so that the potatoes had a good mix of hot/soft/crispy with some pan crisp thrown in for extra crunch.  My friend had the Western omelette with sour dough for toast and found it quite delicious without remark.  The portions were decent, and for the two of us, with coffee, the bill came to $27. which to me, for breakfast, is more than I want to pay (being that I could make all of it at home).\n\nSo, if breakfast home wasn't an option, this is a place I'd head to instead of Moulin Rouge.  What turns me off and will keep me out more than anything else though is the fact it's cash only.  Had I known this in advance, I wouldn't be writing this review as after 24 years of walking past the place, I would have kept walking.", "author": "Paul T."}

I walked in, no sign that says seat yourself or wait to be seated. Finally just sat in a clean booth. Waited 10 mins before the waitress came over and asked me if I was thirsty. Ummm, yeah, sure.... Ordered coffee & water. Coffee tasted like it had brewed over a week ago and was just kept on the warmer. As I wait for my Denver omelet I noticed that there were at least 7 other tables around me that all had dirty dishes on them and no one was cleaning them. It was gross. I finally get my omelet, it was certainly ok but nothing crazy good. I mean maybe if you're hungover, don't care what your food tastes like, and will basically eat anything then yeah, give it a shot!

In addition, we had specifically looked forward to trying out another dive cafe (Dottie's True Blue) and upon departure from the 38, found the line snaking out the door.  Another stroke of doom on a Sunday morning.\n\nWith so much negativity, we opted to stroll downtown in order to, at the very least, take in the sunshine that was streaming between the various buildings and walls not stinking of leftover piss from the night shenanigans before.\n\nOlympic Flame Cafe shares the same corner/alley with the Irish Castle, a charming establishment paying homage to everything Irish, and I remember the cafe only because I thought the signs out on Geary were a possibility to shoot.  Otherwise, my walk takes me past this cafe, probably due to the nondescript late 70's decor and lacking of any sort of creative twinkle to catch my eye.\n\nWrong.  It was during this moment of looking over the generic menu from the generic seat in the house, that the fellow tells me he thinks Jason Segel is at the counter.\n\n\"Who?\" \n\nI don't know much about comedians but Apatow has been hitting my funny bone lately.  Seth Rogen?  What a cutie in my book.  Other than that, this Jason Segel character slips my mind.\n\n\"He was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.\"\n\nNever saw it.  The actresses in that film were not provocative enough to warrant spending money at the box office, although anything pixelated and no speech is the catalyst at my heels: Wall-E stole most of my attention that summer.  Once again, I notice that I am quite good at building disappointment and dashing male hopes prior to my first cup of coffee.  I shrug.  I'll run for a photo op if I see Clive Owen, Gerard Butler, or Monica Belluci, but in this case, I was playing the cool local indifferent to paying into the celebrity ooze.\n\nWell, I was wrong.  Apparently it was Mr. Segel, in his unabashed sense of normalcy, standing at the counter.  With a baseball cap.  Fitting, to say the very least.  I was impressed.  He was in town to perform at Cobb's, as part of the Sketchfest series.  Neil Patrick Harris had dropped out per an SF article.  The dude was right.\n\nAfter the first flush of recognition, I decided upon the special, which coincidentally was noted with a group of other specials listed neatly on the whiteboards posted above the grill.  The Chicken Sausage omelet, with green onions and mozzarella cheese.  This came with a nice scoop of their home fries and wheat toast, lightly toasted.  Add the side of mildly sedating coffee, and I finally felt that legal high that was needed to dispose of the previous disappointments.  $9.95?  The prices that go hand in hand with being situated so closely to the tourist square.  My legal high went down a notch.\n\nThe decor is reminiscent of some idiot deciding to go along with the changing times and unfortunately resulted in the typical rash decisions usually associated with mauve and burnt pinkish arrangements.  I was looking forward to the true greasy spoon dive cafe, with red vinyl seats, rupturing along the seams.  Not so here.  However, I was kept occupied with the comforting sounds of the cook's banter, the clinking of the spatula against the hot grill, and the Eastern bloc friendliness of the waitress keeping up with my empty cups of coffee.  If I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely try sitting at the counter next time.\n\nAt least I know that the stools swivel and when Gerard walks in, I'll be ready.", "author": "Miika M."}

Since it was early, we decided to go to breakfast.  We walked past Dottie's on Jones Street, but that was closed on Tuesday.  One of the locals in the area, walking a muzzled pit bull, told us to try the Olympic Flame Cafe.  He said it was the next best restaurant in the area and warned us not to walk further into the Tenderloin area.\n\nWe took his recommendation and arrived at the Olympic Flame.  The place looked clean and the prices reasonable for being on the edge of the Union Square area.  We sat in a comfortable booth and I had the country breakfast consisting of 4 pieces of link sausages, two eggs, and a couple of pancakes.  They even had sugar free syrup.  I was comfortably full after my meal.\n\nThe other order was a vegetarian omelet consisting of bell peppers, onions, tomatoes, zucchini, and cheese.  It was served with country potatoes and two pieces of toast.  It was more than one person could eat.\n\nBoth of these meals were about $8-$9 each.  It was tasty and the service was good.  The decor had pictures of Greece and it looked like a family run business. The prices aren't too bad. When you walk closer to Union Square, the prices escalate and those places probably cater to the unsuspecting tourists. In general, this place is good and homey and is not a greasy spoon as some critics have written.", "author": "Robert J."}

It literally was the worst food I've EVER been served in San Francisco.  The eggs...yuck.  I ordered them scrambled because I LOATHE runny whites, and in a new joint, you can never be too sure that one man's \"over medium\" is what I would call \"snotty albumen.\"  However, the scrambled eggs smelled off, and they tasted like they had been grilled in rancid grease.  I took one bite and left them on the plate...never in my life have I done that.  Also, the coffee is pretty rank...we're talking early 80s truck stop coffee.

But sometimes that is all I really want/need.\n\nThe prices are on par with nearly every diner (and when I say diner I mean diner, not cafe or bistro) I've ever eaten at, and I never got the sense that this place was filthy or gross. Maybe I'm not scrutinizing my surroundings close enough, but it seems perfectly clean to me. Not exactly stylishly decorated, but I'm used to places in the TL looking like this.

I ended up getting the waffles with fruit. The fruit being a banana. The waffle was soggy and slopped with butter. I asked for a refill for my coffee and it took the waitress about 10 minutes and she only filled it up half way! I definitely regretted not staying in line for Dottie's, this place blew big time.", "author": "Debbie C."}

I ordered the spinach, mushroom and cheese omelette and it was really good. In fact, my friends were pissed they didn't order that themselves. One had the corned beef hash (which was pretty good too, but there were some large chunks of potatoes which was weird) and the other had the pattie with eggs. All in all, not a bad breakfast, but service was extremely slow because there were only 2 people taking orders/serving and the place was packed! However, to give them credit, we stayed for a long time chatting and they didn't shoo us away or anything, but left us alone. That is a big plus!", "author": "Anita L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-10-17", "description": "Worst service I've ever experienced in the US. To say the waitress was rude would be a massive understatement; let's just say the service industry isn't the right career choice for her. After seeing the colourful and inviting 'BREAKFAST' sign we sat at a booth here and waited for the waitress to take our order. And waited. After about 15 minutes of reaching a higher state of hungriness, we asked the waitress if we could order and she snapped \"I'll take your order when I'M ready.\" \n\nYou think this would be enough of an indication that this is a place where you don't want to stick around, but before we had too much time to think about it she was back to actually take our order and pour some coffees. Then, my friend made the mistake of asking of we could get the table cleaned as there were chunks of meat still lying around left behind from the previous booth occupant (so it looks like someone did get breakfast here at some point). What happened next was unexpected and extremely unpleasant if somewhat amusing: the waitress freaked out. Freaked. Out. \"Why did you sit at a dirty table? It's your problem!!\" She stomped off and proceeded to badmouth us within earshot to every other table, because we'd had the audacity and downright stupidity to sit at a dirty table. Shocker, apparently we'd broken the code of greasy spoon conduct.\n\nThe experience was vaguely ok up until this point, as in I would probably still have seen it through and eaten here. But the waitress then refilled everyone other table at the diner with coffee while blanking us. Eventually her war-weary henpecked colleague came over to attempt to clean our table before asking us exasperatedly: \"How can I clean the table with you all sitting here?\" Uhm. Apparently the science of table cleaning is a highly skilled and complex field which we completely underestimated. So we left. \n\nWhich means I unfortunately can't review the food, but honestly, I really wouldn't bother unless masochism is your thing.", "author": "Kathryn C."}
