They must have changed chefs or management because the food is now bland and flavorless. Certain dishes are missing key components; like the fried rice was missing egg and green onions. Tasted very bland and seemed  almost targeting the drunk, late night crowd from Polk. The beef and broccoli also seemed to lack flavor - Worcester sauce was maybe watered down? And perhaps the broccoli was not cleaned thoroughly before being cooked. Cuts of the broccoli were consistent and same goes for beef. The chow mein just seemed like grease and noods\nPretty sad because we loved your last chef and will now need to find a new weekend lunch spot", "author": "Navila H."}

The food is quite authentic to traditional Chinese comfort food. The mapo tofu was extremely soft and delicious, with heat adjusted by request. The string beans could have been crispier, but the sauce was quite good with tiny prawns and garlic to create an umami effect. The rice was a bit overcooked (maybe a tad too much water?) but not bad. The fried calamari was a bit bland in seasoning, but crispy.\n\nThere's a large tv near the entrance in case anyone wants to watch a game. Ample seating. Affordable prices, especially for San Francisco.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

This place has been around for eons and gets crowded.  A friend made reservations for dinner here for our party of 10.  We ordered one of the set menu dinners for a group of 8 and then added one dish.  \n\nWe ordered the set menu which included seafood bean cake soup, crispy fried chicken, ginger/green onion crab (yummy and finger licking good), Peking duck which came with the buns and was pretty tasty, fried quail which I haven't had in ages (crispy and delish), black mushrooms with tender greens, steamed fish, and crystal shrimp with mixed vegetables.  Plus we added bitter melon with beef.  The food satiated our hungry group and there was not much left except for the bones after all was said and done and no leftovers to take home!  We were able to be full for $20 a person which included tax and tip (which is not calculated ahead of time).  Dessert included oranges and fortune cookies.

That in itself should tell you that their Chinese food is pretty tasty.\n\nGourmet has their variety of appetizers, soups, seafood, rice plates, e.t.c.  My co-worker & I usually opt for the broccoli beef over fried rice and the Mongolian Beef chow mein.  These two dishes have tons of flavor and will seriously leave you full.  Just a note, the Mongolian Beef chow mein is a bit on the spicy side. \n\nI have also tried their vegetable egg roles and salt/pepper spare ribs. WOAH! You definitely need to try the ribs.They are perfectly fried with a great amount of seasoning. I think they use cayenne pepper on them so that can be a but overpowering at times.\n\nGourmet is pretty reasonably priced.  Keep in mind though, meat substitutes are an extra charge.  For some odd reason they charge you almost an extra $2 to add chicken to your chow mein vs. the Mongolian, PASS! To me, that is a tad bit ridiculous when each dish is about $7-$8 as is.\n\nOverall, Gourmet is a pretty decent value of food and is perfect if your looking for a good tasting, quick meal!", "author": "Sabrina J."}

There's definitely vegetable and tofu dishes, but not a wide range and no fake meat options so be prepared for slimmer pickings than usual. On the flip side though, the food is pretty good and also pretty authentic.\n\nWe ordered a green onion pancake to start, along with the bbq pork fried rice and the vegetable lo mein. \n\nI was surprised when the pancake came out! It was puffy and raised and pretty much hollow inside, unlike the more flat dense pancakes. It was also *piping* hot, fresh from being fried. It was crunchy and delicious! The lo mein came out next and I kind of did a double take... there was easily enough vegetables and noodles piled on there for three meals! The fried rice came out not long after and again, a huge plate of rice and pork bits! We both ate until we were full and still had so much leftover, we asked for containers to go (which we almost never do since we usually don't leave enough to warrant the effort!)  \n\nWhen our check came? $17 for the whole meal! \n\nIf you're looking for decent Chinese food for a really cheap price, you really can't go wrong here.

After awkwardly conducting my half of the ordering in English the food always comes out fast and with a smile. And it's good food too, with pretty good portion sizes. I won't pretend to know the names of my family's favorites, and I'm definitely not going to attempt to spell them here, but if you have a friend who can order something other than chow mein or fried rice then definitely try it here! I've found a new-found liking for their pickled mustard greens and squid over rice, something I never thought I would try before.

I went to SF for a corporate conference and I took my friend from Montreal there.  \n\nWe started out with the pot stickers, which as somebody else posted, were awesome!  The two main dishes we ordered were Rock Cod, which I asked them to prepare simply steamed with green onion and they put some garlic and ginger.  The Rock Cod was also really good and fresh.  My friend ordered some typical spicy chicken dish that wasn't deep fried with veggies, which was actually really good too! I think Chinese is like Pizza, people order it out all of the time, but it is better to eat very hot and fresh.  We also ordered some Chinese Broccoli, which was decent, but I've had better.  Again, everything was hot and fresh, the service was fast, and the price was reasonable for all the food we ordered.", "author": "Terrence G."}

A perk of eating in is the complementary \"house soup\" for the table. The last time I went it was a scrumptious potato and cabbage soup. Each dish is full of flavor and comes out fast. The menu is packed with house specialties like Sizzling Chicken in a Clay Pot, Shredded Pork in Plum Sauce, Salt and Pepper Spareribs, and Prawns with Hot Sauce. My favorite appetizers are the Fried Egg Rolls, Fried Won Tons, Pot Stickers, Hot and Sour Soup, and Won Ton Soup. Some of the main dish highlights are the Mu-Shu Chicken, Salt and Pepper Prawns, General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, and any of the fresh vegetable side dishes.\n\nGourmet Carousel is the best deal in town.

There was so much food, we even had leftovers. \n\nThis place was known for its Bacon with Pickled veges (Mui Choy Kow Yook), a really delicious, juicy, salty, fat, oily pork dish. Not recommended for those with high cholesterol. Great for college kids.\n\nA good place for a quick dinner when you can't think of another place.

Since it was a banquet menu, everything was ordered ahead of time, so sorry, that I don't know the proper names for everything!\n\n*Scallop soup (has some chicken in it too)--good for the seafood lovers.\n*Minced squab or chicken (it varies by restaurant) w/lettuce cups--okay, I thought it tasted slightly off, but my aunt says it was just me.  \n*Peking duck with buns--missing the green onion slivers, but it was crispy, meaty & didn't have tons of fat & the buns were so hot!\n*Some kind of fish--didn't eat because I don't like fish.  Waitress filleted it in less than a minute, gotta love that about Chinese restaurants.\n*Crispy skinned chicken with shrimp chips--loved it..moist and crispy skinned (of course), the shrimp chips were crispy (sometimes they're soggy) & they weren't really greasy.\n*Shrimp with shells & eyes in tact---didn't eat because I didn't want to get my hands totally messy...& shrimp in the shells with the eyes totally freak me out!\n*Black mushrooms and cabbage--Ate some of the cabbage, but not the mushrooms because I don't like black mushrooms.\n*Beef with bok choy--The beef was pretty tender and the sauce was good and not overly salty.\n*Braised yee fu noodles--\"The Birthday Noodles.\"  Came with plenty of veggies and was nice and light.  \n\nAll of this came with the standard cut orange slices (so sweet) and fortune cookies.  The wait staff was very attentive to our party and even poured the wine that we had brought and gave us paper plates for the cake we brought.  \n\nI always get worried if I don't see any Chinese people in a Chinese restaurant, don't worry it was about half the restaurant, so this is no Panda Express like restaurant!

Won ton soup, definitely, as I am still recovering from my stomach ailment.  Then how about a couple of entrees, which we could split; sounded like a varied lunch.  Then my friend suggest a green onion pancake, so we decided that one entree would be enough.  The bowl of won ton soup was enough to feed a table of four with a cup full each; yummy.  The green onion pancake was a large, dinner place size, served with a peanut sauce; again enough for four to share, as an appetizer.  The final course was green bean and beef, served over rice.  Hot tea comes with the meal.  Half of this last entree remained, but as both of us had full afternoons, we declined to take it home.

Apparently, my four year old nephew loves the bird's nest too now!\n* Salted Fish Fried Rice - I'm not a big fan of fried rice myself, but my family loves the stuff.  They always order it here.\n* Bitter Melon and Chicken Chow Fun, wet style - I'm not a big fan of the bitter melon, but it's you can still eat the chow fun since the taste of the bitter melon didn't get into everything.\n\nNotable mentions that we didn't get this time, but have in the past:\n* Fatty Pork Meat with Pickled Veggies - oh so good, and oh so fatty!\n* Deep Fried Bean Cake  - I like mine with lots of gravy!\n* Stir Fried Veggies, whatever is in season - simple stir fry with garlic and it's yummy!\n\nWe always start our meals with soup here - whether it's house soup or what.  It's simple, refreshing and I like it.  And you always get fresh oranges and fortune cookies here too.  Believe it or not, I actually really like their fortune cookies here and I've gotten some exception fortunes out of them too!\n\nOverall, Gourmet Carousel will always be a steady repeat for my family and I.  Yes, over the years service can be good and bad.  But all in all, good Chinese food for a good price can't be beat.  And it's a telling sign when you've been in business for at least sixteen years.", "author": "Teri C."}

One of the only drawback is the difficulties with parking around the neighborhood.\n\nFor dinners, stick with their set menus.  There's always a good variety of stuff to satisfy.  Of note, their clams with black bean sauce and their fried chicken are both really good.  Their salt and pepper prawns may take some getting used to for some as they come complete with legs, head and everything in between.\n\nFor lunch, I really really really like their dry fried beef chow fun.

Then came the entre.  \n\nIts a good thing I stuffed my face with the stickers bc this entre was a pain in the ass to get to.  They, the chefs, took a giant fist of breaded shrimp, fried them up, salt, pepper, jalapenos, green onion... sounds tasty right?  Not when it takes you 35 minutes to 1. rip their heads off 2. rip their legs off 3. peel off their shells which sucks on lousy cheap shrimp 4.  then go grays anatomy on their backs and de-veins their poop shoot.  Why even apply any breading or spices if all of the shit is destined to be tossed when you clean and prep the damn shrimp?  I didnt like anatomy in high school and I still dont like it now.  The breaded heads and beedy eyes will haunt me tonight in the digestive war which is destined to go down.\n\nSo if you go, ask that they prep the shrimp propper, otherwise this place is ok and they have a flat screen tv with football on for your viewing pleasure while you wait.

Hungry Chinese food freaks please go here! \n\nI haven't been this excited about lunch since I discovered Kam's the first time. We all had rice plates (rice a la mode if you will) and the food was honestly piled on. I had the Chicken & Black Mushrooms. Lots of crisp veggies, chicken fillets, and not a whole lot of sauce. Just enough of it to coat everything and not drip off the plate. Wifey had the Sweet n Sour Pork that I didn't sample cause... it's Sweet n Sour Pork, OKAY? But it did look awesome, with huge pieces of everything it's suppose to have, and lots of it! What I really like is that you can customize your dish, like if it isn't on the menu... Just say I want beef with mustard greens with black bean sauce on rice and you got it, baby... for a couple more bucks. And... and... it gets better. This is a big lunchtime restaurant, that can turn over table after table so we were out of there in less than 40 minutes, which is great because all the daytime parking is 8 quarters per hour meters (we only had 6 quarters). There's more... yeah, it's cheap too. Geeze, if only the damn won ton soup had more won tons.\n\nBest time to go? I'd say after 1pm.

We ate here about once a week since the food was cheap and delicious. \n\nHowever, there are a few things that we hated about this place. The woman that greeted us out front which we nicknamed \"The Pitbull\" was always very rude to us on the phone and in person. My wife was actually scared to call her to put in our order since she was a bit \"hostile\".She had all the charm of a frothing wolverine yet not as cute. I understand she's trying to be efficient when speaking on the phone but perhaps she could let me put in my whole order before trying to hang up on me with a \"uh huh..ok bye...\" Perhaps if I could make just one suggestion for this place is don't put the person with the worst accent to pick up their phones and handle greeting customers (if you can even call it greeting. I think you'll have a better experience waiting in line at the airport shortly after 911 with a bottle of shampoo and a box cutter than wait here).\n\nI've had so many horrible experiences with the service yet this one stood out. On one occasion she perhaps misunderstood my order on the phone. When I ordered beef with black bean for some reason they gave me beef tripe in black bean. Now I can stomach a lot of weird food however, certain things I draw the line..(like the inside of a cows stomach). I'm sure certain people just love the stuff but when I see that greyish skin matter in a black goopy soup it just reminds me of afterbirth. \n\nAnyhoo, I digress.. \n\nI walked back to the restaurant thinking \"Well they must have misunderstood\" and you know I was fully willing to pay for the new order since the stuff was so cheap. As soon as I told her that this was not what I wanted she went absolutely crazy. She started to accuse me that that's what I ordered and that she wasn't wrong. Literally yelling at me treating me like I just murdered her grandchildren. I couldn't really take this right after a hard day at work. Even when I told her I didn't care who's fault it was and that I'll pay for the right order she still went off on me.\n\nAll in all a good place to eat as long as you don't mind people treating you like your in a third world country market buying bak choi out of a van.", "author": "James Y."}

Gourmet was my neighborhood standby.  I must have eaten here at least 3 times a week for 6 months.  I've tried almost everything on the menu.  I will agree that many items aren't spectacular, but when you find the good ones, paying $3.75 for a meal large enough to feed two people is a gift from Buddha.\n\nI will also agree that the service is a bit lacking.  The old lady at the front desk(who has been there for like ever) has an attitude that would challenge the fiercest drag queen.  She'll make you feel stupid, she'll tell you what's what.  She's awesome.  All I had to do is tip a little, and she would still give me attitude, but with an understanding that my business was appreciated.   Jesus chrsit, a little attitude is refreshing.  If I wanted a PF Chang's experience, I'd move to the Midwest.  Give me my food cheap and fast, and you can then talk back to me if you want.

You've got to love funny Chinese restaurant names. \r\n\r\nA few of the Chinese women in my office ordered lunch here yesterday and came to sit with me and my coworker in the office lunchroom. The food looked and smelled good, so we asked them where it was from. They told us about this place and that the food was good and cheap. Considering that these women eat tasty Chinese food every day, we took their word for it and went there for lunch today. \r\n\r\nMy coworker and I decided to share a won ton soup ($3.50) and a combination chow mein ($5.50). We could have shared 1 dish and still had leftovers. The portions were huge and as the Chinese women told us, everything was cheap! We weren't able to finish either dish. The food was ok though. The won ton soup was pretty good, and could have fed 4 people. But the chow mein was... well, the more I thought about all the ingredients in the combination chow mein, the more I didn't like it. It was seriously a combination of all the 10 other chow mein dishes they had on their menu. It had chicken, beef, bbq pork, scallops, squid, tripe, shrimp, bok choy, broccoli, carrots, fried soggy fish that was probably cooked yesterday... all mixed up in a mound of noodles. I think I had 1 of each item before I decided to stop eating. I just couldn't stop thinking, did they just mix up all their leftovers from yesterday?\r\n\r\nThe service was not that great. My soup spoon had crusty bits of food on it, and so I asked for a new one. The lady seemed a bit annoyed. Then we asked for ice water and chili sauce, and that made her super annoyed. \r\n\r\nShould I have the desire to return, I will most likely order take-out, and stick with something safe, like mongolian beef with rice.", "author": "Connie C."}

It is very tasty if you order the right food, and farely cheap.  For instance, the lo mein and chow mein are not so good.  And if you are looking for typical sesame chicken, they don't have it.

Definitely unique. You'll pay market price for the crab. They do come but up but you'll still have to work for your dinner.\n- Egg and Shrimp: This is a homestyle dish rarely ordered (I would argue) by Chinese because it's something mom makes at home, but it was really good. Kinda like scrambled eggs with shrimp but lighter and with scallions and flavor.\n- Salt Pepper Pork Ribs: Dry style fried pork w/ seasoning. Can't go wrong with this dish.\n- Snow Pea Shoots: Ahhh yumm. So tender, and simply prepared with garlic. Seriously, the veggie itself is terrific.\n- Sizzling Rice Soup: Just a fun clear broth soup that makes a sizzling entrance.\n- Salted Fish Fried Rice: We tried this one with a little skepticism, but were all pleasantly surprised. Preserved salted fish is stir fried and imparts flavor to a typical rice dish. It wasn't fishy unless you got a big chunk. Otherwise, tasty!\n\nAnd the meal ends with juicy slices of oranges.

I used to live about 150 feet from this place and at one point was eating their pork fried rice at least once a week (takeout -- I've never actually eaten in the restaurant).  Why? Because it was tasty and they gave you a big tub of the stuff for only $3.95.  This was like manna from heaven for a starving student.  I also frequently enjoyed the eggplant with spicy pork, and the chow fun was good, but EXTREMELY greasy.   One word of caution: when ordering takeout,  be prepared for Soup Nazi-like treatment from the lady who answers the phone, should you not be sure of what you want to order.  She has no time for your indecisiveness.", "author": "Andrew E."}

The woman had little patience with me when I ordered over the phone (had a couple questions ont he menu).  When we picked up our order, we asked for chopsticks.  The hostess gave us 1.  We asked for another pair.  She was not happy when she gave us another.  Does she expect us to share???", "author": "Mitzi C."}

It epitomizes everything an American Chinese food restaurant should be, and sterotypes it in almost every way. Coming from a Jewish decent, we love Chinese food. It is somehow in our genes to crave it. Groumet Carousel (GC) satisfies on many levels. The only reason I neglected to give it 5 starts are because it does not deliver and becaue I think some of the items could use a bit less oil. \n   Everytime I go to this place it is busy with a good assortment of people. The usuals are Asians (always a good sign) and those connoisseurs of cravingly palatable Chinese cuisine. Even though the menu is very large, I seem to be ordering the same things all the time. The dishes there have very short names, and I only order what I don't know if I am in the mood for gambling. I have no idea what I am going to get when I order blindly, which is under certain circumstances a good thing. My favorites there are the Egg Foo Young, and most of their vegetable dishes. There have some interesting dishes there as well, such as the glazed shrimp with pecans. Not very asiany, but still delicious. Always the kicker, the prices are really reasonable there. No dish is over 6-7 bucks, with a nice healthy portion. And I am really one to be pick about portions. I really hate the fru-fru, pretentious, small sized, over priced, BS meals that you get in this city. I don't know what anorexic crowd these meals are designed for, but I will not put up with it. Ariel is fully satisfied with this place and will keep going back.  I have to say that last Christmas I strolled over there for the food, and now it is my official Winter Egg Foo Young wonderland!", "author": "Ariel A."}

I have been in SF for a week and have been dying to have Sesame Chicken.  And everywhere I travel I order it as a reference point of what I'm used to.  I check out the reviews on CitySearch and find Gourmet Carousel.  The first time I attempted to go couldn't find parking and gave up.  The second time, I found parking and went in to order my desire to go.  The order is under $10 so they won't take a credit card, so I add egg rolls, also it doesn't come with rice, it's extra $.  I get my order fairly quickly and ask if there is sweet n sour sauce for the egg rolls, the lady nods yes, and then a guy chases me outside and hands me a little plastic conainer with, what I think, is SnS sauce.  I drive to Crissy Field and find a nice park bench to eat my, much awaited, meal.\nThe egg rolls are crispy, greasy and not much in them, and I'm dipping them into the sauce the guy gave me although they had their own little container of sauce in the bag.  I didn't order the rice but they gave me some.  But my shock came when I looked at the Sesame Chicken!!  It was just the chicken, batter fried, dry, nothing else!  ???  Not a sesame seed in sight!  I called the restaurant and told them what I had found and they said that it came that way.  I said where are the sesame seeds, the sauce?  I was informed that the seeds were there in the batter.  (I found maybe two).  And the sauce the guy gave me was the sesame sauce.  I guess you pour this tiny amount of sauce over the chicken and it becomes transformed?  Well, I had used that to dip my egg rolls in, still no sesame seeds.  Now I have a little container of SnS sauce and I'm dipping my greasy pieces of chicken in it.  The batter is not quite cooked through and some of the batter pieces didn't even have chicken in them.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!\nThey have a huge selection of things on their menu so I may try them again, based again on the other reviews I have read, but I will eat in next time.  The experience was the only negative in an otherwise beautiful day watching the sailboats at the marina.", "author": "Paula W."}

Everything was layered in a thick film of grease and was generally untastey. We got kung-pow chicken and mongolian beef. The chicken in the kung pow were these little overcooked pellets of meat that looked they were left over from the purina factory and I think I tasted hoof in the beef dish. \n\nAnd OH the service!!! We asked our waitress to split the check.

My recollection of the place was fond but the Yelp reviews gave me pause.  For good reason.  This was really mediocre Chinese food.  The Chicken Chow Mein was heavily laden with bean sprouts and the pieces of chicken were like contorted toothpicks sprinkled over the dish.  The potstickers had a foul, off taste.  The Kung Pao Chicken had stale tasting peanuts and too many water chestnuts.  When I went to pick up my order I was also disturbed to see they had a rating of only 90/100 on their last health department visit.  I won't be back any time soon.", "author": "J. O."}

I stopped in last night and had some excellent Cantonese cuisine.  The pot stickers, a little doughy, are excellent and crispy golden with a wonderful ground pork, ginger, and cabbage filling; perfect topped with a little vinegary and soy sauce on top.  The sweet and sour rock cod fillet is crispy and greasless with a well balanced sweet and sour sauce and fresh pineapple, bell pepper, and onion.  I loved the free small order of winter melon soup with fresh, soft winter melon (a little bidder but good,) pork, and vegetables in a savory broth.  The steamed rice is excellent; not soggy but firm.  My mother loved her chicken with green beans which I will have to try.  For $26.00, we definitely got our money's worth.  The service is friendly and efficient.  So, for excellent Cantonese cuisine at rock bottom prices with friendly service in a clean atmosphere, Gourmet Carousel cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

However, there were times where I would give them a 2 star and at other times  a 4 star.  I tried them for lunch and dinner on numerous occasions.  The quality of the food seems to vary depending upon what day of week you are there and whether you are there for lunch or dinner.  I can only guess that they probably have 2 or 3 different chef working different shifts resulting in an inconsistent quality with above average results most of the time.   As a Chinese who ate at hundreds of Chinese restaurants, I would say that their Yee Fu Wonton is better than most Chinese restaurant.  Another above average dish which many Chinese will generally like but which many Westerners may dislike is the Salted Fish and Chicken Fried Rice.", "author": "Greg L."}
