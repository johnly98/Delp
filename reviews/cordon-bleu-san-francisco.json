The Chef, server, cashier was just one woman, superwoman. Service may take a bit longer, and it may appear she's lost, but she's not. I watched her give people their bills verbally doing all the calculations in her head. In the midst of cooking, serving, answering phones for the endless to go orders, greeting people, taking orders and more she managed to stay calm and friendly not rushing any of her customers. I was impressed and I was totally distracted until I realized she was cooking my food. \nShe is methodical with her ways. \nFood was bountiful and delicious!

The portions were very pretty big for the price and it was actually very affordable. \n\nIt is a relatively a small location however can fit more people than I thought it could so about 10-15 people give or take.\n\nIt was pretty awkward trying to speak to the employees in Vietnamese only for them to tell me that they don't haha.

While it is a variation of the grilled street meats you'd typically see in Vietnamese cuisine, it lacks the strong fish mark flavored paired with the perfect smokey after taste.\n\nAll of the combos are similar to one another with minor tweaks. The prices are fair (cheap for SF) and the portions are huge. You'd definitely get your money's worth eating here if you're a meat eater.\n\nI originally wanted the Combo #1 with one cha gia, pork kabob, salad, and meat sauce on rice. They got my order wrong and gave me the combo with the two cha gias which was fine. \n\nThe cha gia is tasty and huge. I wasn't a fan of the meat sauce (this isn't Viet at all btw), or the pork (it was dry for my liking).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-27", "description": "It happens.  \n\nEvery once in a while a yelper drops into a non 5-star business and enjoys the experience so much that it causes them to think of all those places to which they've assigned 4-star ratings.  Then the brain gets to spinning:  If that other place was 4-stars and I enjoyed this place so much more, how could I give it anything but 5-stars?  \n\nSo I'm giving Cordon Bleu 5-stars and I'll say flat out right here: it is in no way a 5-star place.  \n\nCordon Bleu epitomizes the phrase \"hole in the wall\".  It's tiny, crowded, leaves a messy impression, and the first stool I sat on was so wonky that I immediately changed seats.  You don't come here for the exceptional atmosphere.  You come here for the excellent food at remarkable prices and, if you're lucky, the chance to watch and interact with the hard-working and engaging owner, Katie.  \n\nFrom my counter seat I ordered Cordon Bleu's \"Chicken Salad\" ($8.78) which is one of the best deals in town.  Katie stands at the grill, tending to the chicken pieces as workers squeeze in and out of the tight space.  Other guests at the counter had dietary restrictions which she handled with aplomb and \"what is that?\"-questions which were addressed with a sample of the item in question (\"Vietnamese spaghetti sauce\").  I observed people who'd just finished their meal get up and order 6 more meals to go, then watched Katie handle special requests from patrons at the counter.  When she asked if I liked my salad I finally got the chance to tell her:  \"It's delicious!\" then went on to admit that \"I haven't been here in years.\"\n\nA dialogue sprung up, and I admitted that I'd last dined at Cordon Bleu about 30 years ago, before she purchased it some 25 years ago.  It's been around for 40 - 50 years now and that sort of longevity doesn't just magically happen.\n\nCordon Bleu's menu is a blast from the past, with only a single offering topping $10 but flavors that feel perfect for today.  The Chicken Salad, with its expertly grilled protein and fresh flavors is a satisfying thing of joy.  I could round the corner and get a $20 salad at Blue Barn which would be only half as satisfying.    \n\nParking in this 'hood is impossible but now that we've been reintroduced, I won't be waiting another 30 years to return to Cordon Bleu.  It may not really be 5-star worthy but that day, I was feeling it.  \n\nCordon Bleu steals today's award for the tastiest, most well-priced restaurant in San Francisco.", "author": "Tracey A."}

The fire from the grill licks at the chicken and then she pours some sort of sauce? Over it.  When it's done, she serves it on the big bed of rice with a tomato-y, onion-y, another drizzle of sauce and some cabbage slaw.  The chicken is indeed tender, flavorful, and juicy and the flavor of the chicken, the gravy, and the slaw work together amazingly!

I don't mind if the chicken is a little pink, but I definitely don't like it raw and bloody.\n\nI ordered the Combo #4 which included a half chicken, country salad, meat sauce, and rice. The half chicken came in two parts - the leg and thigh were slightly undercooked - and I'm totally cool with that. It actually tasted pretty good. The breast and wing were kind of raw. Even the wing was kind of pink. The breast meat had the cool slimy texture of raw chicken and I had the taste of bloody chicken in my mouth afterwards. Gross!\n\nAlthough most of the other reviewers said that their meal was cooked to order, the chicken most certainly is not cooked to order. Anyone who has cooked chicken on the bone before knows that it takes awhile to cook it, so many restaurants just reheat the chicken on the grille before serving, and Cordon Bleu is no exception. They actually keep the pre-cooked chicken in a tray under the counter about 6 inches from the floor, which is also pretty gross.\n\nThe owner is very friendly, and nearly all the other customers were regulars who greeted to the owner by name, speaking in English or Cantonese.  It seems that the Imperial Rolls are the thing to get - but I didn't try any.", "author": "Allen T."}

My older relatives did not want to sit at the counter because it was too close to the stove and they said they couldn't breathe with all the smoke. Whole family loved the food though, and the prices were unbelievably low. Every single meat was tender and extremely well flavored with just a bit of smoke. Oh, and portions are HUGE.

The space is pretty small but that didn't bother me at all. What I didn't like was the food. The chicken is precooked so all they do is put it back on the grill to heat it up. That made the chicken pretty dry and inedible and I did not taste any five spice seasoning on the chicken ...it was pretty bland. Also the imperial roll isn't a bad side but it looked like it was also precooked and they just drop it back in the fryer to heat it up and it wasn't very crunchy. I noticed that the cook uses the same tongs to handle raw n cooked food. Additionally they use very cheap iceberg lettuce for the salad and there was a good amount of water sitting at the bottom of my noodle salad bowl even before I poured in the sauce.", "author": "Mai C."}

The person grilling was nice, but several times I saw her checking meat, seeing that it was burnt, and still putting it on the plate or the takeout box. I know a lot of people like the meat sauce over rice, but the problem is that it gets the imperial rolls all soggy really quick. And it's like they expect you to eat the imperial rolls with the meat sauce. You have to actually ask for the fish vinaigrette that comes standard with imperial rolls at every other Vietnamese restaurant. \n\nOkay, one more thing. I hate to put this out there where everyone can read it, and I wasn't sure whether or not I should put this in my review, but I did see the woman at the grill put a half-eaten slice of pepperoni pizza on the grill to warm up.

I went with option #1 which had the yummy meat sauce on top of white rice topped with pork kabab, a side of cabbage, and a deep fried spring roll, WOAH!!!!\n\nThe food is cooked right in front of you and literally grilled to perfection. Not sure what seasoning they use on the meat but it was divine. The meat sauce kind of threw me off at first but seriously it is worth trying. The flavor was so good, the perfect sauce to dip pretty much anything into. The pork was perfectly sliced thin, but it was a tad bit salty, almost too salty even. \n\nI LOVE spring rolls and egg roles so having this deep fried delight was like an added bonus.

You walk in (if you're lucky enough to find a parking spot), and sit down on the warmest seat at the bar (if you're lucky enough to find a seat). Don't be surprised that it stays as busy as it does - there's only a few seats, and one two-top in the back, the other being a four-top that is sometimes taken up as their \"bus\" station - what's there to bus, not quite sure, as the gentleman dishwasher pops out to check for more work often. The place is run by two ladies, moving about behind the bar, cutting the chicken with the one pair of scissors between them, using the one pair of tongs. You eye the half-pints of nuoc cham sauce teetering on the corner of the bar. You order the #5, with all of their meat options, rice, and their spaghetti sauce (not unlike warmed-up chef boyardee, but better), or, you feel like something lighter, so you order the vegetable eggrolls over noodles. But will there be nuc cham with it? Will there be enough eggrolls? Better order more. You're so pleased when 10 minutes later, two souffle cups that are filled with the sparkling, clear, rose-and-gold colored sauce with those floating flecks that beckon you appear on the formaica counter next to the single dollar tip left by the invisible patron that preceeded you.

Comforting, cheap and unrefined.\n\nI've dined in and picked up take outs from here.  After parading along Polk Street all night, this place is a paradise.  However, subsequent visits were less impressive.  I felt like Goldilocks, filling my tummy with the good, bad and ugly.  Some pieces of meat were a little too dry and chewy, some burnt and others were just right.  \n\nComb No 5 has a little bit of Monica, Erica and etc.  It consists of several types and preparation of meats with a large helping of rice.  The steamed rice was covered in a red meat sauce--tomato/ketchup, onion and ground meat mixture likely with some cornstarch/flour for thickness.  I thought the sauce was necessary to moisten the burnt or dried slices of pork.  It came with a tiny quarter leg of chicken that was juicy and not burnt.  The Imperial roll was very greasy but would likely be delicious after a few drinks.  The cabbage slaw was the tangy amuse bouche that kept me eating.\n\nI also tried the chicken salad.  It  was hard to navigate through the excessive mystery meat and burnt pieces.  I had to pull off the skin, cartilage, bone and pure carbon before diving back in for the kill. Skipping this one next time.  It was too much work.", "author": "Amy J."}

Vietnamese comfort food is what they serve, and girl it is hella ngon (delicious in the vernacular)!!\n\nTheir menu is one page, they got 5 specials, the most popular being #5 which is a taste of everything good in the vietnamese world - shish kabob (bbq pork), grilled chicken (you choose either a breast or wing & thigh), a huge imperial roll (most likely THEE BEST imperial roll in SF), some pickled cabbage to balance the flavors, and if that wasn't enough, all that goodness is resting on a bed of hot, white rice TOPPED with their secret meat sauce! oh the fun you'll have!\n\nIt's all fresh and cooked to order right in front of you as the grill is literally in front of the counter seating, so there can be a wait, especially if the place is full, but worth the wait.\n\nbring cash cause it's CASH ONLY no cards, checks, bitcoin, paypal, apple pay, or offers to wash the plates.\n\nHere's to the ones who dream!", "author": "Ray R."}

I was taking the California Street cable car one night expecting to enter a regular restaurant with formica tables, naugahyde chairs, surly waiters, and a sun-faded poster of the Eiffel Tower half-torn on the wall. You know, like Sam Wo's reborn. But I guess I wasn't really in the Tenderloin, and real estate is clearly at more of a premium on Nob Hill. Surely that's the explanation for the walk-in closet that is Cordon Bleu on California near Polk Street. It reminds me of any number of greasy diners in New York like Johny's Luncheonette (no second 'n' please) where the counter is pretty much your only alternative other than the large-group tables in the back.\n\nIt was pretty crowded when I entered but not fully. Because a couple of mouthy hipsters decided to hog three stools between them, I stood against the wall waiting for an opening. They were so self-absorbed that it took a five full minutes before one of them acknowledged I was perhaps wanting to use the stool to eat and only after leaving his money (cash only). Thanks dudes...hope the cable car doesn't run you over when you jaywalk across the street. The two women who run the place pay no attention to such matters... they have a grill to master and rice to scoop. I grabbed one of the few well-used, laminated menus on the counter and started to peruse.\n\nLemme see... there are five combo plate entrees, four house specials, and on the other side of the menu, four veggie options. The choices struck me as more pan-Asian than strictly Vietnamese... kinda Korean by way of Saigon with a heavy emphasis on country comfort food, in other words, pure catnip for budget-conscious slackers. I decided to order the $9 Number Five, which consisted of a Five-Spice Roast Chicken Leg, \"Shish Kebab\" (without a stick and served in thin slices Korean-style), a large Imperial Roll chopped and heavily deep-fried, a \"Country Salad\" (a.k.a. shredded lettuce with some dressing), and the mysteriously described \"Meat Sauce on Rice\" (see photo).\n\nIronically it was this latter item that turned out to be the most satisfying component if only because it sopped up the drippings from the other four items. I still couldn't tell what kind of meat I was eating, but it was sloppy-Joe-good. The shish kebab and chicken were a tad overcooked for my taste, even though that didn't stop me from devouring either one. Despite the tasty filling, the roll was just way too crunchy-greasy to eat comfortably without having nightmares of a coronary where I would have to lay down on the dirty-plate-covered counter since there would be no room for a gurney in there. OK, I'd still probably come back, give more explicit stink-eye to the entitled hipsters, and try to decode the meat sauce again.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...dinerific with a tasty-greasy meat sauce of unknown origin\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...I would describe it as claustrophobic but all those letters wouldn't fit in here\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...speedy multi-taskers, not much on smiling\nTOTAL - has anyone seen Guy Fieri in here yet?", "author": "Ed U."}

My legs were tired and my boyfriend was trudging along begrudgingly, claiming I lied to him when I told him about a small Vietnamese shop nearby that served home-made food at a higher quality than the fancy restaurants near the station. We arrived at our destination, and I could see the crestfallen look on his face as he saw the immediate surrounding area and the literal, hole-in-the-wall shop. We each took a menu, browsed through it quickly and ordered the number 5 and the noodle salad. Waiting for the food was hell. We were tired and cranky, staring blankly at a lady frying up imperial rolls, another lady in the back grabbing utensils and cups full of water for the customers. However, the wait wasn't too bad. Once the food came out, magic happened.\n\nThe imperial rolls are the best. They're so crunchy and none of that half-assed frying. This, this is what something fried should taste like. The chicken wing on my boyfriend's number 5 plate was tender and juicy, not overcooked at all. The pork may have been a little too thick and chewy for my taste, but it was good nonetheless paired with the hearty meat sauce over rice.\nThe noodle salad was delicious - like a rice noodle bowl you'd get at other restaurants, but this one already had sauce on it even before adding the fish sauce that usually comes with the order. The imperial roll was tasty as always, and the chicken pieces were also tender and juicy. It was a nice contrast to the hearty meal that my boyfriend had.\n\nAll in all, this place is amazing. Over 800 reviews - so why not pop in for a bite if you're in the area? Bring cash, and maybe a little more to buy extra imperial rolls for the way home.", "author": "Soomin S."}

Maybe they mean it's made with lots of spices which I didn't really taste either.  The green onion oil-infused rice was too mushy in my opinion but not bad taste-wise.\nThe mint and cucumber salad that comes with is is pretty refreshing.\n\nThe entree combo #5 comes with 5 spiced roast chicken, imperial roll, shish kebab, country salad, and meat sauce on rice.  The imperial roll wasn't bad. The shish kebab (or actually a few thin slices of meat) tasted similar to the pork chop.  The roast chicken wasn't as flavorful as I'd thought it would be but it wasn't bad. The meat sauce tastes similar to Spaghetti O's.\n\nThe fresh spring roll tastes like the imperial roll but not fried of course.  So it's not like your typical nem nuong or shrimp/pork filled fresh spring roll.\n\nWe made a mistake by going to this resto on a hot day. The resto is pretty small and the heat from the open kitchen keeps the place warm.", "author": "Heejin L."}

Talk about a mouth-full; no pun intended. Oh yah, there's also a pickled cabbage salad somewhere underneath that pile of food.\n\nMy favorite parts of the hodge-podge meal was 1) The hot and deliciously crisp imperial roll which was generously packed with a savory pork vermicelli mixture; and 2) The chicken (wing/breast) which was perfectly charbroiled creating an crispy blistering skin with a succulently moist center. I didn't detect much of the five-spices: fennel, cloves, cinnamon, star anise and peppercorns though but the chicken was cooked so well that it didn't matter to me. \n\nIt's not an authentic, life-changing or cohesive meal by any means but a stick to your ribs, soulful meal that's (almost) a melting pot of San Francisco all in ONE plate! \n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*Cash Only\n*Parking is horrible in the area\n*20 min wait for take-out\n*Counter seating and 2 tables for sitting\n*Don't wear your nicest attire because you will leave smelling like you've been doused with Sizzling Meat Eau De Parfum", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We took counter seating and watched the Cantonese-speaking ladies grill and fry an assortment of different meats. Honestly, the food looked very unappetizing. Also, I question their cleaning methods. They were using the same rag to wipe everything...gross. I was hoping for some good ol' pho soup, but was disappointed when I didn't see it on the menu. So much for \"authentic\" Vietnamese. \n\nI ordered #5 which came with a huge piece of roast chicken, an imperial roll, country \"salad\", meat sauce and pieces of grilled pork on rice. The boyfriend ordered mapo tofu with rice. Overall, you definitely get your money's worth. For under $10, the food we had could have fed a small family. The imperial roll was tasty, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. However, the pork was on the dry side and the mapo tasted and looked like something I could whip up in the kitchen.

I can see why, too -- the atmosphere is so warm and exotic, I felt like I'd been transported to Asia. There's bar seating surrounding the open kitchen where sizzling meats are being grilled before your eyes, a pot of \"mystery meat sauce\" (which you will discover is delicious, and dribbled all over your rice) is boiling away, and a stack of imperial rolls are being dipped repeatedly in a vat of oil.\n\nThose imperial rolls ... oh my god. The best Vietnamese spring rolls you'll ever taste in your life. They're also about 3x the size of a normal imperial roll, but hey, I'm not complaining.\n\nThe #5 (with an imperial roll, 1 piece of five-spiced roast chicken, 1 shish kebab, country salad and meat sauce on rice) appears to be the most popular dish. At almost $10, it's not cheap either. Honestly, the rice was really clumpy and overcooked, but the aforementioned meat sauce makes up for it. The chicken was super tender and the shish kebab tasted like yummy glazed jerky, but the clear winner was the imperial roll.\n\nThe wait is a bit of a downer -- my two friends and I arrived around 7:55pm, put in our orders around 8:05pm (although we were waiting at the register, you kind of have to be aggressive about getting your order in -- just like in Asia!), and didn't receive our food till 8:30pm.

The five-spice chicken (for which this place is known) is decent. I'm not sure if it's marinated with all five spices (star anise, cloves, Chinese cinnamon, fennel seeds and Szechuan pepper) but the meat is tender enough.

A little too charred for my liking, though.\n\n- The shish kebab (not really shish kebab) was probably the best thing in the box, and went well with the little plastic tub of nuoc cham.\n\n- The imperial roll was enormous and crispy, but kind of tasted of stale oil. The risks of coming in near closing time, I guess.\n\n- The country salad was a small pile of shredded cabbage. As small piles of shredded cabbage go, it was fine.\n\n- The meat sauce, I could have done without. Underseasoned and gloopy, in desperate need of a squirt of Sriracha. It might have been better if I'd eaten it there rather than taking it to go, but the restaurant doesn't have a whole lot of seating.\n\nIf I were still in college, I'd probably be a regular here.

It was $10 including tax for the five spice half chicken, 3 kebabs, 1 imperial roll, rice with meat sauce, and salad. \n\nTaste\nI was expecting the chicken breast to be dry, but it was moist inside. It had enough flavor where it wasn't bland, but I wanted more flavor. It wasn't the \"best chicken I've had outside of Vietnam\" as advertised on the menu. The kebab was the same.  The imperial roll was battered and deep fried. The rice and meat sauce was okay, and the salad had enough flavor. It came with the fish sauce/lemon juice dipping sauce. \n\nService\nThe service was fine. I don't expect 5 star service from a $ place. We arrived around 7pm when the place was empty and they let my family sit at the back table. It took about 30 minutes for the food to arrive, and the place was packed. \n\nAtmosphere\nNot much to say here. It is literally a hole in the wall. The chair cushions were ripped. There were many picture frames of fireworks, and one lamp in the back that lights up the entire place besides the stove light. \n\nConclusion\nAt first I was confused when I Yelped the place.

The flat piece of meat was rubbery and not advised. The rice with gravy was quite good. God only knows what it is, but it certainly complimented that rice really well.

It was a heaping mound of five-spice chicken on top of rice doused in some odd red sauce, with a big egg roll. And this was well under $10....believe it or not, a ton more food than I was wanting at the time. Two people could share this and be completely OK. \n\nThe five-spice chicken was pretty awesome, I'll give it that. But man, I just don't know about that red sauce the rice was doused in. With the rice, it came off as similar to a gumbo, texturally.

There is only one table, the rest is counters so don't come here with a big group. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the number five and I tried the noodle salad. All the meat is cooked up on the grill in front of you and the smell had us drooling. After ten or so minutes the food was plopped down in front of us. \n\nThe number five has chicken (he always orders the leg but I think you might be able to ask for the breast if dark meat isn't your thing), marinated pork, an imperial roll, rice and a sauce that reminded me of Heinz baked beans, but in a good way. My boy did say a word until he had finished his meal. For a chatty guy, that is saying something!\n\nThe noodle salad had a delicious dressing on it and also came with the marinated pork and an imperial roll. \n\nThe highlight is the imperial roll. Flavorful, crispy, hearty. If I could eat nothing but imperial rolls for a week, I would be a happy woman!\n\nUnfortunately we did not get the apartment but it may be blessing in disguise for my waist line. \n\nDefinitely stop in if you are in the area and get an extra imperial roll.

Small \"hole in the wall\" family-like environment where you sit in front of the cooking area -- everything is done before you.\n- food taste is out of this world, I've yet to see anyone who didn't enjoy it. Even my extremely picky-eater girlfriend really enjoyed the food. It's deceptively tasty, you will be surprised. You walk in, it's quiet, seems like an aged place, they serve you the food it looks normal, nothing amazing. Once you take the first bite you will understand the hype.\n- menu is relatively simple and they limit your options. To me, this is a +. \n- the portion sizes are respectable.\n\nWhat can be improved:\n- my largest qualm w this place is w the attitude of the owner. While this may in part contribute to the hole in the wall feel of the restaurant, she is pretty cold, unwelcoming, almost grumpy. If you ask her for something on the wrong day she will respond w attitude and make you regret asking in the first place. That being said, she's been seen w a half-smile on occasion. \n- the rest of the staff does not speak English and is damn near clueless.\n- it's very cramped inside.\n- waiting times can be extremely ridiculous.\n\nIn summary:\nFood: excellent.\nExperience: not perfect.", "author": "Temur K."}

However, the name, Imperial Roll, may be quite appropriate since the Cordon Bleu's version is the best I have ever  eaten, and I've been to quite a few boites that serve these ubiquitous rolls.  The Golden Deli in San Gabriel near Los Angeles comes close, but it too falls short of the greatness achieved in this very modest \"dive\" on California Street between Polk and Larkin.\n\nI always pay homage to this temple whenever I make my trek up north.  This cha gio is dense, packed with thin glass noodles, rough ground, spiced pork, carrots and onions and garlic.  The Vietnamese version of the \"egg roll\" is superior to the Chinese ones since the wrapper is made from a thin rice \"skin\" which frys up ever so crisp and light.  When taken immediately out of the fryer, the fried crisp skin almost shatters in between the teeth, and the breaking open of the roll releases a garlicly, black peppery, spiced aroma that, to me, is equivalent to ambrosia of the Gods.  \n\nI always do take out since I can then go around the corner to Common Sage on 1552 Polk St, San Francisco, CA 94109 (b/t California St & Sacramento St.) in Nob Hill to get some beer like Orion, Echigo Koshihikari, Ebisu, Ginga Ko-gen, etc. since the combination of these two elegantly concocted food and drink is positively mind-blowing to use an old, hoary expression from the late 1960's.\n\nSan Francisco has some really amazing restaurants.  Gary Danko comes to mind. But for the price, Cordon Bleu's Imperial Roll is beyond words.  You gotta put one in your mouth to know what I mean.\n\nPS  Phone ahead so you can grab the Imperial Rolls and make a quick get away since there will probably be no parking, and you'll need to double park on California somewhere.", "author": "Gary I."}

It's a hole in the wall out by Polk St. under a small, blue awning. Insider, it's just bare bones with maybe 10 seats at the bar and three small tables. Behind the bar is an open top grill exposed to the seating area.  \n\nThe service here was EXTREMELY SLOW. In total, we were sitting there for over an hour before our meal was slow. It also took about 20 mins for them to take our order. I tried to order from the first lady who brought out our utensils, but she didn't understand \"Two #5s\" in English. Moreover, she didn't even try to motion another wait staff to take our order. While we were waiting for our food, someone left the bathroom door open, and a putrid smell started wafting into the dining area. Some people who had already started eating looked pretty nauseated, and I'm pretty sure they lost their appetite right then. Luckily, our table hadn't started eating yet, but I know I was pretty disgusted by the smell. I also strongly urge you all to stay away from sitting in the back left corner of the restaurant!!  \n\nI ordered Combo #5, which includes their famous five spice chicken, imperial roll, shish kebab, country salad, meat sauce, and rice. I thought everything had a pretty good flavor, and there was a hefty sized portion enough to last two meals. Note that the shish kebab was not served on a kebab stick, but is just the grilled meat. The meat was a bit too charred though, in my opinion. The meat wasn't burnt, but it was just very blackened. It was as if they hadn't cleaned their grill in a while that night, and all the residual char from the previous grilling had rubbed off onto the meat. As others have mentioned, the meat sauce is reminiscent of a light spaghetti tomato meat sauce, which was unexpected, but works with the rice and meat. \n\nThe food was tasty here, so I wouldn't mind getting takeout next time. However, by all means, avoid the far left corner of the seating area if you want to keep your appetite!!", "author": "Audrey L."}

Tasty and filling, but nothing spectacular. 2star\n\nNow, the imperial roll was the best. Big, crispy, crunchy, hot, greasy, and filled with ground pork and other goodies. Add some Sriracha to their dipping sauce and it is PER-FECT. 5star\n\nAnd the service was ok.

They should wrap it in something other than wax paper though since it can stick and take off some of that delicious wrapper.  I'd go again but it's not the best Viet food.  Nice that it's cheap and gives huge portions though.", "author": "Jane N."}

I wasn't concerned about calories, grease, MSG, borderline health inspection score -- none of that -- and still, they disappoint.\n\nI got the grilled chicken with meat sauce over rice and \"salad\" (a few forkfuls of chopped cabbage). The chicken tasted good, well cooked and coated in a sweet glaze, but the breast itself was small. I guess the idea is that you get just enough meat from the chicken to justify gorging on a heaping portion of sauce-slathered rice.\n\nThe problem is that that rice is no guilty pleasure. It's soggy, overcooked white rice topped with a thin sauce. The so-called meat sauce, orange in color and water-like in consistency, tastes primarily of onion and pepper. I ate a few bites, left my money on the counter, and departed.\n\nSome friends had told me that Cordon Bleu was a gem. Some friends...", "author": "Jackson G."}

You're elbow to elbow with other customers if you take on the diner seating.  If you're lucky to get one of the two tables, you will be practically sitting in another diner's lap.  Which may or may not be a good thing.  A similar situation can be found in the bathroom.  The sink is almost hanging above the toilet bowl and you're nudging the walls with your elbows.\n\nThis is a divey joint.  I came out smelling like I bathed in five spice chicken.  Expect to shower immediately upon getting home.  This is not to say that it's not clean.  When we were seated at the table, they wiped it twice, vigorously, with a wet towel then dried it with a paper napkin.  Service was fast and friendly.  \n\nStrangely enough, the table next to us thought it would make a good date place.  Probably because they were Polk Street hobos.  Just kidding.  The couple was super lovey dovey in a we-haven't-done-the-horizontal-hokey-pokey kind of way.  I hope the guy didn't think he was going to seal the deal with this place.  Who knows, maybe five spice chicken turns her on.\n\nI wasn't impressed with the food.  The chicken was good.  The meat sauce is reminiscent of the sauce you get with HK style baked pork chops over rice.  Basically, tomatoey sauce (to solve the mystery of the \"mystery meat sauce\", this would be tomato paste, chicken broth, onion, garlic, salt, sugar).  The staff are Cantonese (probably from/lived in Vietnam, which isn't uncommon).  The best thing on the menu is the imperial roll.  \n\nI wouldn't go back and eat at the restaurant; it just wasn't comfortable, even for the price.  Takeout would be fine.", "author": "Erika C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-17", "description": "I'm really conflicted about Cordon Blue Vietnamese Restaurant. While the sheer volume of food you get for the price is impressive and the food is solid, it's not authentic Vietnamese food, nor even homestyle Vietnamese food. \n\nI ordered the #5: 1/2 roasted 5-spice chicken, kebab, imperial roll, salad, and meat sauce over white rice.  All of this was piled high into one plate!\n\nThe 1/2 roasted chicken was tender and flavorful, but I could barely taste the 5-spice marinade, unlike other Vietnamese 5-spice chicken I've had. \n\nThe \"kebab\" was not a kebab. Rather than chunks of meat on a skewer, you get 3-4 flat pieces of Vietnamese grilled pork. Again, the pork was tender and flavorful, but again, no discernible Vietnamese seasoning/flavor. \n\nThe best thing about the imperial roll was the size. It was HUGE. Otherwise, I've definitely had better fried spring rolls elsewhere. \n\nThe salad was pickled shredded cabbage. It was sweet, crunchy, and refreshing, a nice compliment to the grilled meats and rice. \n\nAnd lastly, the meat sauce over rice. LIke the imperial roll, the best thing about the meat sauce was that there was ALOT of it. It was a thick, orangey Tomato sauce, very reminiscent of Chef Boyardee pasta sauce or a sweet Bolognese sauce. I've never had this kind of sauce in a Vietnamese restaurant, and it didn't make sense to pair it with the grilled chicken, pork, and imperial roll. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is the definition of a \"hole in the wall.\"  In the back, there is 1 2-top and 1 4-top. In the front, there are 7-8 counter seats. The grilling takes place about 2-3 feet away from the counter. Be prepared to come out smelling like food.\n\nThe ladies working the front counter were very nice and the portions are SUPERSIZED. If you're in the area, it's worth a stop for solid, hearty food.

I'm sorry to say I did not get the chicken this time as the volume of food seemed pretty daunting. \n\nThe interior is limited in seating to about a dozen seats around the counter and maybe 3 small tables in back.  This is not meant for groups over 4 people.  There is an informal line system for waiting, but the smell and sight of the food makes maintaining basic social etiquette tenuous at best.  Maybe just order to go and enjoy it back at your place.", "author": "Daniel A."}

I went in for lunch and took a seat on a rickety bar stool picked up one of the menus and two people asked if this was my first time. I said yes and they both suggested the combination with the chicken and egg roll. I checked my pockets and found I was short a buck plus tip. So, I started to order just the chicken, well my fellow diners would not have this, they put down the extra and the ladies said not to worry about a tip. They said I would be back and make good. So, sweet!\n\nThe food was stick to your ribs and huge portions. I was very happy with the meal. The imperial roll has the most amazing chewiness under the crisp exterior, and highlights of black pepper in the meaty filling. The meat sauce is a surprise over rice and highly addictive. The chicken is grilled on this ancient two burner open grill, the marked skin is crispy and the umami comes through.\n\nDon't expect a fine dining experience just good peeps and good food.", "author": "Lhm M."}

There's a nasty, greasy dust which covers the surfaces which are not often used.  The level of cleanliness here is very low overall.  The service isn't very good.  The family which runs the place will not be attentive to you and will often not have your order ready on time if you call it in.  The food LOOKS bad.  It's a pile of slop looking curry, with blackened chicken or pork, an unappealing looking deep fried emperor roll, a sad looking bit of cabbage salad.\n\nThat being said -- this is a true gem in Nob hill.  The food here really is fantastic.  It's got plenty of shortcomings, but that doesn't stop it from tasting great.  Authenticity -- I'm not really sure.  I feel like maybe it's truly authentic in that it's closer to what real vietnamese people would eat, but I've never visited so it's hard to say.  The menu is fairly limited, it's all variations on the same few items.  Everything I had was fantastic, though.  \n\nThis is the kind of place Anthony Bourdain would love.  It's gritty, and has this wonderful character about it.  It's run very poorly, but that doesn't stop it from being very successful and popular, because at the end of the day -- the food is great and has it's own unique style.\n\nIt's definitely not for everyone, if you managed to read this review past the first paragraph, maybe it's your type of place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-12-03", "description": "A MUST READ TO ALL WHO INTEND TO DINE (and all who love it so much):\n\nIf I could sum up this place in one word: UNauthentic.\n\nSeriously.\n\nI've always questioned people who raved about Vietnamese restaurants in San Francisco.  Every Vietnamese/Vietnamese-American person I know who lives/has lived in SF has said that Vietnamese food is no good in the city.\n\nI was in the area, and was looking for a quick bite on the cheap.  Saw reviews for this place and I was curious, for a variety of reasons:\n\n1. the place was named, \"Cordon Bleu\" and considered a Vietnamese restaurant\n2. people were raving about a \"meat sauce\"\n3. I was hungry\n\nI thought to myself, \"meat sauce, I don't remember any Vietnamese dish having a 'meat sauce'.\"  Have I perhaps never come across such a dish with the 24 years of Vietnamese cuisine I've had from 2 grandmothers, 5 aunts, and my own mama??  So dine in I did, somewhat excited to try a place that so many people deemed, \"a great hole in the wall,\" had \"meat sauce,\" and was \"Vietnamese food.\"  \n\nThe very first thing I saw was their menu.  Strange name I thought.  Why would a Vietnamese place have such an American name?  Maybe it's a fobby way to attract Americans.  Then, right in front of me, I saw that giant pot of meat sauce everyone was talking about (and that you'll probably see in pictures).  I asked in Vietnamese, \"do la mon an gi?\" (What dish is that?)\n\nThe reply I received: \"don't speak Vietnamese.\"\n\n\nI ordered a #5, which included: a 5-spice chicken, \"kabobs,\" and an imperial roll.\nOf all the Vietnamese food I've eaten either at home or in San Jose or Orange County, I have never heard of a 5-spice chicken.  I thought maybe they were talking about key ingredients/spices used in Vietnamese cuisine like garlic, thai basil, mint, lemon grass, fish sauce...(just to name a few), no, no.  I realize that THIS is what they're referencing to, \n\nhttp://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/five-spice-chicken-banh-mi-sandwiches\n\"Lemongrass is the classic seasoning for Vietnamese-style grilled pork or chicken, but chef Charles Phan likes to use fragrant Chinese five-spice powder instead.\"\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo basically, Chinese operated (I heard them speak some dialect of Chinese) with Vietnamese-flavor influences.  \n\nOverall, BLAND FLAVORS.  Chicken was alright, cuz you can't go wrong with BBQ chicken as long as you don't overcook it.  Imperial roll is actually the closest thing to authentic there (deep fried eggroll with rice paper instead of eggroll wrap, a Vietnamese variation on Chinese eggroll).  And oh, that staple \"meat sauce;\" it's an imitation of a kind of dipping sauce used for spring rolls (which usually is orangey in color and uses ground pork throughout the sauce, ground shrimp if ya wanna get real fancy). Kabobs definitely didn't look like kabobs or have a meaty texture.  \n\n\n\n---Mystery meat sauce and mystery meat (except for the chicken).\n\nThis place DOES NOT serve Vietnamese food, \nnot even Vietnamese-ish.  \n\nMore like, Vietnamese ... REFERENCED food.  I'm actually slightly offended that this is being recognized as Vietnamese food... false-advertising.  I am however, NOT OFFENDED by the food.  It's edible.  And if the chicken and the imperial roll were $1 each, maybe occasional visits from me would be possible.  I only think that they should not call it Vietnamese food.  It passes more as Vietnamese imitation grub, that's more accurate.\n\nStill weary of trying Vietnamese food in the city.  Some restaurant from the OC should just move to SF to show the city how it's done.", "author": "August H."}

Underspiced and underseasoned, it was like warmed up jerky. The country salad was a cole slaw of some sort and it was kind of nice to have a sour kick after the meat sauce oozes everything into tasting th same. The imperial roll was mighty tasty though, and almost had that same fatty thick mouthfeel like the ones from Tu Lan. \n\nThe regulars seemed to request a separate plate for the roll, probably a good idea so it doesn't get soggy from the meat sauce.\n\nSeating is a little strange since it's all counter and then three little tables in the back.

In fact, it seems to be little more than a hole, with 4 staff members all cramming around a hot stove and grill, churning our Vietnamese plates at a rapid pace (I am filled with both pity, envy, and awe thta they manage to work with more efficiency than a German car factory).  Space is limited and there is pretty much just counter service, plus a handful of teensy tables shoved into the back.  The place is always packed, and if you eat in you do run the risk of sitting next to the overzealous foodie who will spend an hour boring you with his every culinary adventure since the age of 5. \n    Immeditaely they thrust menus at you with a minimal selection of options.  hHe portions are gargantuan, and all the plates are under $10.  In fact, you could probably just order one plate for two people and still both leave feeling so full you don't want to eat again for another 12 hours.  I went with the noodle bowl, which came with kebabs and a Vietnamese Imperial Roll, although I also had the option of upgrading the kebab to chicken for a measly $1 extra.  I discovered pretty quickly with a fast glance at the grill that the chicken wasn't really my thing (it was a huge leg or breast of meat on the bone, with far too many visible tendons and too much dark meat for my liking).  Accordingly, I did not choose the option to upgrade, and instead went with the kebab which turned out to be thin slices of grilled pork meat.\n   Waiting for the food took a lot longer than I expected, but I can't really blame them with such limited space, they actually were constantly working as it stood.  However, in the future I might just call ahead and wait the 20 minutes for takeout.  When it was pushed in front of me the bowl was stuffed with a mountain of noodles, a roll that was kind of charred and stuffed with shredded veggies and cabbage (kind of chewy and utterly addictive), about 5 slabs of the grilled pork (not what I expected from a kebab but it was so good I didn't actually care), and a light broth at the bottom that required a bit of digging.  I was pleasantly impressed with the combination, and I wolfed as much as I could manage down pretty rapidly.  My dining partner went with the 5 spice chicken, and he seemed far less happy with his choice.  He kept insisting the sauce (which doused a pile of white rice and a large hunk of chicken) tasted like a red conch chowder.  While I didn't really get that from my sample, I can say I didn't really think it was as spicy as I had expected, and I did vastly prefer my own selection that evening.  I personally thought it was more of a bland tomato sauce used for spaghetti kind of thing, but either way kind of meh.  Also, I did see someone else's tofu plate which I would be tempted to order next time.\n    I wouldn't call it fine dining by any stretch of the imagination, but it is definitely a cool spot to get your Vietnamese fix. For what you get, knowing it is a quick and inexpensive option, it is decent.  However, you can see everything being cooked in front of you, so if you're squeamish and want an immaculate kitchen this probably is not the place for you.  It is cluttered and possibly has questionable health code ethics.  Also Cordon Bleu (an odd name for Vietnamese) is cash only, so make sure to swing by an ATM on your way over.  Cheap eats, huge portions, it is definitely worth checking out that night you're feeling too lazy to cook or for when you 're craving some Asian comfort food.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

When my friend Jenn and I first entered, all we saw were happy customers, most of which were standing and waiting for their take out orders to be completed. Due to our limited time, I wish we had thought of doing that because we did not have enough time to really sit down and enjoy the food.\n\nDue to our limited time, we decided to share an order rather than each order our own plate. A lady waiting told us their chicken was a must-try and since the menu said it was world famous, we figured we had to so we got the #4. The meat sauce on the rice was hecka good and I could definitely see myself eating a whole meal of just that. The chicken was good too but don't know if I can see how it's world famous. While we were frantically eating to get to our event on time, the cook kindly gave us each a piece of the kabob so we could at least taste it. Now the Kabob was truly AMAZING. That is something I could see being world famous more so than the chicken.\n\nDespite our limited time to eat here, I really enjoyed the food and will definitely be back again. We did try to come back after the event to order the Imperial Rolls but it looked packed again so we decided to save that for another time. But someday, we will come back and take our time to sit down and enjoy the good eats.", "author": "Gajan K."}

Of course, he also made us promise to bring him some Imperial Rolls back to Chicago for him.\n\nHe warned us ahead of time that it was divey; not that it was a problem, but with a name like Cordon Bleu, one expects something a little fancier.\n\nThis was our last meal in SF and the trip definitely ended on a high note.\n\nSince we knew ahead of time it was tiny, we got there right when it opened so we wouldn't have to wait. We got two seats at the counter and watched the magic happen.\n\nChickens were grilling, egg rolls were frying, and meat sauce was simmering away on the tiny stove. The stove is so old that the knobs are no longer there and pliers were used to turn it off/on.\n\nThe owner came by and took our order and she asked us how we heard about the place and we told her about our connection in Chicago and she smiled. Cordon Bleu has been there since 1967, which I find astonishing. \n\nWe ordered the much-heralded Imperial Rolls, vegetarian rolls, a combination plate and a chicken salad.\n\nThe Imperial Rolls have earned praise for a reason. Crispy, but not greasy, bursting with meat and vegetables. Egg roll bliss. The vegetarian ones were quite tasty as well, with bean thread and mushrooms inside.\n\nThe chicken salad was indescribably delicious. A bed of cabbage, mint, basil, carrots and bean sprouts with a pile of five-spice chicken on top that the owner took off the grill seconds earlier and shredded right in front of me. It was dressed with some type of vinaigrette that accented the salad perfectly. This salad was bursting with fresh ingredients; it made me feel good eating it.\n\nMy boyfriend got the combo plate of half a grilled five-spice chicken and rice with meat sauce. He devoured it.\n\nWe talked with some of the regulars which this place has in spades and everyone proclaimed it the best Vietnamese food in the city.\n\nWe placed our order for Imperial rolls to take back with us, got the bill (seriously cheap), paid and left, knowing full well we will be back one day.\n\nCordon Bleu was our own little celebration marking the 35th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War.", "author": "Melanie S."}

Perhaps I should have ordered that instead but I needed forkable food since I was on the run so I ordered the #1 - kebabs, imperial roll, served with rice and mystery meatsauce plus a cabbage slaw. \n\nI have to admit I'm a little confused by said mystery meat sauce. It definitely doesn't feel very Vietnamese ... and definitely not French. But the kebabs were nicely grilled and had a nice sweet BBQ flavor.

This place is no frills, straight to the point, down right good food.\n\nIf you don't know where this restaurant is, you'll very well pass it. It's a hole in the wall. Upon walking through the doorway, it's almost shocking how small it is. And that's the beauty of it. This place really is only for people who get lucky and find a free seat or people who understand that the food is worth the wait.\n\nThe menu is very limited, but just about everything is delicious. The eggrolls are unlike any I've ever had. They're big and (I think) cooked twice to make them extra crispy. I have yet to find another restaurant that makes their eggrolls that look and taste like this - trust me, I'm Asian! And the meat sauce, oh, the meat sauce! It's doused over your rice. To me, it tastes more like a tomato base with bits of meat. However it's made, it's freakin' good! The portions are huge and cheap. I once came here with intense munchies and I still only ate about 2/3 of my plate and felt like I was going to burst.\n\nI think what I love most about Cordon Bleu is I feel like I'm sitting in an aunt's kitchen. The cook (who I'm assuming is the owner) is a nice and accommodating lady. She'll make conversation with you when she can - she's usually busy focusing on cooking since it seems like the restaurant is constantly brimming with diners.\n\nThis is definitely a hidden gem in San Francisco.", "author": "Napier B."}

I love them, I yearn - yes yearn - for them. But this one was a shock. \n\nFirst, let's talk cleanliness. I know hole in the walls aren't known for their hygiene but this is the first time I've felt uncomfortable eating somewhere because I'm scared of food poisoning. This is from someone who has just lived in Korea for the last 3 years, and most hole in the walls there don't understand what a health code is. But this is the first time I've experienced a place where I felt like they're deliberately being dirty. The sauces and pots and crusted over and the food is all unrefrigerated and pre-cooked with flies swarming around them. Cooked and recooked and left to cool and then cooked again. That's the best way to explain what they serve. \n\nSecond, food quality. The driest food I've had so far. Their kebobs are simply Korean style pork steak. Their \"spices\" on the chicken is undetectable. Their rolls are overpriced overly greasy on the border of rotting pieces of flour and meat. Their sauces are quick mixtures of frozen condensed sauce which for some reason doesn't even have the flavor associated with such greasy food. Their \"meat sauce\" which is really just a watery version of Asian curry was the worst I've had so far. \n\nThird, their service. Ok... so they were nice enough. I guess. But it took 30 mins to make my food when there was only one order ahead of mine. Took their sweet time to even put the meat on the grill. \n\nFourth, price. The price wasn't that cheap. It's a hole in the wall. So I expected a lot of food for a low price but the only reason that it was filling was all the white rice they give you. Not enough of their \"meat sauce\" or Asian curry as I would call it to cover the portion of rice and a very small amount of real meat. I would forgo the rolls and focus only on the chicken if I wanted my money's worth. \n\nI wouldn't go as far as to say, \"Don't ever go here\" but I would definitely not go there if there were other options available or someone else wanted it.", "author": "Dominic C."}

I was planning on doing a review update, but I guess I'll be writing my first review!\n\nI found this place when I first moved to San Francisco after seeing a movie at Lumiere.  The ambiance is not so nice, but the woman working the evening shift behind the counter is so sweet and friendly and the food is to die for. I actually prefer the laid back atmosphere. I've even been on two dates here (I recommended it of course).  \n\nI always, ALWAYS get the #4 with all white meat chicken, extra meat sauce, and an imperial roll.  This is enough food for two days (or two meals) for $10.  Pretty cheap!  It's also BYO, so feel free to bring in some beers or a bottle of wine.  Usually, everything is so well prepared.  The only not excellent meal I received was on Saturday.  Yes, I was in hangover hell and really needed my beloved chicken place to pull through, but they didn't.  My chicken arrives and I open up the box to find on one piece of chicken (they always give you two) over the usual white rice, without EXTRA meat sauce and the meat sauce was bland! I was soooo distraught, like all day. I'm serious.\n\nSo, I guess I'm going to have to give Cordon Bleu four stars instead of five, just b/c of this experience. Next time, impress me again and I'll change my rating to five. I still love you Cordon Bleu, I'm just sad.", "author": "Jenny W."}

And five-spice roasted chicken.\n\nI don't have a standard policy when it comes to tipping when getting takeout. If the service is great and/or the person helping me does something a little extra, like swapping a side or being very accommodating with my requests, I usually tip. But if it's nothing special and I've saved them the trouble of waiting on me and doing dishes and all that, I often don't. All depends.\n\nThis afternoon at Cordon Bleu, I was faced with a tipping dilemma. The lady helping me wasn't exactly friendly, more indifferent, but she was giving off a warm smile to customers she seemed to know well. Maybe you have to be a repeat visitor to get her smile. Her tip jar was full, and since I wasn't charged tax, figured why not, let's get some karma points.\n\nI'm so glad I did. Because I got home and discovered that my five-spice roasted chicken was not one but two massive pieces of outstanding goodness. Seriously enough for two meals, unless you're like me and are too tempted by the smell and taste and decide to eat some right away.

When I first visited San Francisco, my cousin (who had been there for 25 years) took me here, told me this was one of the first places he had eaten at when he moved there.  I was impressed.  Their five-spice chicken was tasty (not spicy, but definitely flavorful and not gamey like chicken can get), and I had an imperial roll that was pretty good.  You can get a meat sauce accompaniment but I never remember there being \"meat\" in it (it could just be chicken or beef based, but I don't ask, they don't tell ha ha).  OK fast forward a few years later.  This time they have \"combos\" with the chicken, rice, meat sauce, roll and shish kebab.  I have to say, I really like their shish kebab.  I'm not a kebab fan normally but it was tasty. The chicken is what I remember.  The service, eh, you get what you pay for, which is very little (my husband and I can get FOUR meals out of the two we order what we pay for around $20).  \n\nHere's the kicker though: in NYC they've started this \"grading\" initiative where local restaurants and food establishments have to hang their sanitary department grades in their window.  Needless to say, they have strict standards and if you \"failed\" you will be a) shut down until you pass and b) if you have a C chances are, you don't want to advertise that.  The last time we were there, my husband and I got a little skeeved about their sanitary practices.  Using the same scissors over and over to cut the chicken, cut the shish kebabs and cut the imperial rolls.  They don't have sinks up front to clean them at the ready.  we were amused though, because after a while, my husband said, \"Would this place last in NY?\" I said, \"No they'd be shut down in 20 seconds!\"  \n\nI'm over the Cordon Bleu, I've made it a point to go there the last few times I was in town.

Also, seems like the chicken is already cooked and is just heated up on the grill. I had dark meat, so it wasn't too dry. The \"meat sauce\" has a processed food taste and the rice gets drowned in this sauce, which I didn't like. Too soupy.

The kabab wasn't as moist and flavorful as I wanted, but still very tasty (I give it a 4).  The meat sauce over rice...well, it's good but kinda weird.

I ordered the #5 so that I could see what this place is all about. It came with Chicken (pick a breast or leg), Beef Strips (Shish Kebob) and an Imperial Roll and Rice smothered in their Meat Sauce.\n\nThe cool part is that they cook everything up right in front of you. Or, it kind of looks like they grill it up in front of you, but it was previously roasted or something. Either way, it's going to be fresh. I noticed that the cook was snipping off some of the gristle (burnt stuff) from my chicken with a pair of scissors. I love me some tasty gristle, so I was a little disappointed and wanted to ask her not to do that. It turns out she was only cutting off a few small pieces of extra black gristle, so it was okay... i guess. \n\nI opened up the massive plate when I got home and started with the chicken. It was pretty good but the chicken wasn't that big so it left me wanting more. I guess this isn't the restaurant's fault, but I really like big portions. The beef strips were tender, juicy and grilled well - pretty delicious and probably the best part of the meal. \n\nThe imperial roll.... I've never really been a huge fan of egg rolls because they're greasy and make me feel disgusting. This was no exception - it's HUGE! Hard to say, since I'm not a fan of egg rolls in general, but I took one bite and left it alone.\n\nI'm also not a huge fan of the meat sauce drowning my rice to death. I'm somewhat of a purist when it comes to my rice, but I thought I'd give it a try since it was my first time. I'd definitely ask for WAY less meat sauce next time, get it on the side or even ask for none altogether. It was nothing for me to get excited about. \n\nI got my order to go, but the service was pretty good from what I could tell. Overall, the food was good, but I still don't know how it can smell that DELICIOUS and just be \"pretty good\" food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-11", "description": "I haven't eaten at Cordon Bleu for years -- usually because it has been too crowded when I thought about eating there -- but I always remembered it as a place where you can get a really BIG and tasty meal for cheap.  Nothing has changed on that front. \n\nMy favorite Chinese restaurant on Polk St. (Sam's Cafe) was closed for a week and I was trying to figure out where else to eat.  I was hungry and in the mood for roast chicken. So, I walked down to the tiny restaurant at California and Polk next to the Lumiere movie house and took a seat at the counter.  \n\nCB is definitely a 'dive\" and almost always crowded because there are only 9 seats at the counter and only one table for 2 and another for 4 in the \"back.\"   The grill and stove are so close you could just reach over the counter and touch them if you wanted to.    \n\nAs with most popular small restaurants -- like CB & Swan's around the corner -- the best strategy for getting a seat is to go early or late.  Otherwise, you're likely to have to stand in line before you can be seated. I happened to walk in late in the afternoon after the lunch crowd had already left and there were only 2 other customers at the counter.  So, getting a seat was not a problem.  \n\nParking is another matter because it's all metered (along and w/in a block of Polk)  and most spaces are taken, but you can usually find a space on the opposite side of California St between Larkin and Polk or on Sacramento or Clay between Polk and Larkin.  If you're going for lunch and make it quick, you can also try parking for FREE in the garage below the Wells Fargo on California St near Van Ness, which has an attendant -- who's there mainly to assist cars leaving the garage and as far as I know doesn't keep tabs on how long you're parked there or whether you actually go into the bank.\n\nI briefly looked over the menu but I already knew what I wanted and ordered Combo #4 -- which really isn't a combo -- which offers half a chicken on rice w/their rough cut cole slaw for $7.95.  They precook the chicken and the waitress/cook (owner?) grabbed 2 big pieces of chicken -- breast/wing  and thigh/drumstick -- out of a container under the counter and plopped then down on the grill and when they were done laid them on top of a HUGE pile of rice laced w/their signature  tomato based \"meat\" flavored sauce that they put on everything along w/the cole slaw.\n\ni'd forgotten how generous they were w/the servings and was wondering if \"d be able to finish it all.  No problem there!.  The chicken was GREAT -- hot, tender and juicy. Didn't really taste any \"five spice\" seasoning on it -- at least no hint of anise -- but whatever the seasoning was was very tasty and I finished off the entire 1/2 bird right down to the bones.   I then cleaned my plate of all of the rice and slaw.   Yum!!\n\nI can't say I'm a \"fan\" of CB because I seldom eat here, but it's definitely A-Ok and if you're in the mood for some roast chicken -- as i was ---head straight to CB  for a cheap, tasty and filling meal!", "author": "Martin C."}

ONE.\n\nWe order two... maybe its good, I got to give these Chinese people the benefit of the doubt, maybe they're from N.Vietnam, and are really good at cooking... how do i know?\n\nSo in comes my friends, and as they sit, they begin to rave about the 5 Spice Chicken...  We order, 5 spice chicken for everyone with the \"meat sauce over rice.\"\n\nFood arrives...\n\nHIsteria Part 2 begins...\n\n1) Chicken is over cooked, CHARRED.\n2) Chicken + \"Meat Sauce\" = bland, needs salt, needs FISH SAUCE.\n3) \"Fish Sauce\" for Imperial Roll... tastes SWEET... like not FISH SAUCE.\n\nAnd so I ask for SALT, and they give me soy sauce... I ask for rice, and the woman doesn't speak english...\n\nI ask for FISH SAUCE, and they give me... dipping sauce...\n\nSo, I don't really know what everyone else is thinking or what they must be ordering.

This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to in my life.  Five spices on the chicken, true.  Four of them are carcinogens, but the other one was quite tasty.\n\nI got a seat when I walked in here and still waited 20 minutes for my food.  The main reason I waited that long is that the women working the grill was absolutely MURDERING the meat.  It was blackened and burnt to a crisp by the time it reached my plate.  It was served on a pile of rice that could feed an entire Vietnamese family, and drenched in a red sauce that had absolutely no taste except for black pepper.\n\nThe Chicken was scorched beyond reason, and needless to say was tough.  The shish kebab was also scorched and tough.  The spring rolls were ok I guess.  I watched as she deep fried them, then took them out of the oil, then deep fried them again, then took them out, then deep friend them again.\n\nBeyond that, my lord is this place dirty.  I got a good look behind the counter at the conditions they were cooking in, and it reminded me of the dirtiest street food stalls I ever encountered in Asia.

Finding some company, we ventured in - I already knew I was ordering the 5 Spices Chicken Salad and only hoped it was as yummy as I'd remembered.  It was!  (and now I'm left wondering why I'm not hitting up Cordon Bleu every week).\n\nBig plate of lettuce, cabbage & mint (and maybe basil) - and freshly bbq'd chicken (which you will wait for, because it's cooked when you order your salad), topped with chopped peanuts and a mouth-watering, sweet - yet sharp - vinaigrette of some sort.  It doesn't sound like anything fancy but it's as perfect as a salad can get.\n\nSo I mentioned the bbq.  There may have been some some thin strips of pork on the bbq, which turned out to be shishkebab, which turned out to be too enticing to not order (and at $3 for an a la carte order, why the hell wouldn't you?!)  As one might expect, this also turned out to be more than one could finish, when coupled with a giant chicken salad.  But I tried!  And I liked it.  (and I'll do it again, dammit!)  There was a mild teriyaki-ness to the marinade and it was DELISH.  I had to remind myself to use my fork and act like a lady.  Delish.\n\nThe only reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the space itself is due for some paint...and probably a little bleach.  But when you're sitting 2.5 feet from a 500 degree grill...and watching dozens upon dozens of pieces of bbq'd delicacies get shuffled around to perfection...you forget about the bleach.

You may however just bring yourself and your appetite to feast on some tasty food.\n\nThe portions are huge, and the variety of food you get on your plate can be kind of overwhelming. A combo meal will come with salad, two huge pieces of grilled chicken, an egg roll, and a bed of rice covered in their home special meat sauce--WOW I needed to take a breather just writing that. I kid you not, you cannot go home hungry when you have this much food. I think the 5 spice chicken was good, but parts of it were a little too charred for my own liking yet it wasn't overdone either. It probably has to do with the heat the chicken is cooking at.\n\nI'm assuming this place is really popular for to-go, and I can tell this restaurant has attracted loyal customers since a lot of people who came by to pick up their to-go orders made casual conversation with the cook/owner there like they were old buddies. That's usually a good  indicator of how a restaurant is.\n\nAnyways, the menu is limited but I definitely recommend the combo meals as they were fulfilling and delicious and allow you to kind of get a taste of everything.

Crowd eclectic.\n\nI was recommended this place by a colleague whose opinion I really trust because he's an absolute grinder. Fresh out of college and fresh of the east coast, I asked Tom for a rec for a cheap, solid, place to grab a bite. Tom came through.\n\nI rounded up a couple of buddies, and we went for it. We were pretty confused when we walked in--asking ourselves questions like \"why is this vietnamese place called Le Cordon Bleu?\" We sat down at the bar which encloses an open-kitchen. Place is packed. Finally, these saintly little Vietnamese women serve us, and we begin watching our food cook in front of us. Never had a more agonizing experience in my entire life. I think I was foaming at the mouth by the time we got our food (not a bad wait though). I got the #5 per Tom's rec--a ton of grilled chicken, 2 pieces of this thin steak-like meat all on top of this rice under a nice flavorful meat sauce. Oh and they go ahead and tack on this mega egg roll that's just delicious. Meggroll? Whatever. There was so much freaking food, I don't think my two friends even made it to halftime. Really shameful performance. I'm known to eat, and even I couldn't finish everything.\n\nNot only did I have amazing food for like 9 bucks, but I had a phenomenal overall experience--great food, great people, good conversation, a few laughs. Seriously, this place may have changed my life. \n\nTo the nay sayers: If you're complaining about the service or something about the ambiance you should probably consider the fact that everything on the menu is under 8.50... I think the last big mac meal I bought cost 8.50---wasn't exactly dazzled by the ambiance there either. Of course, this place was about 1000x better than Mac Does. Did I mention the service was phenomenal? Those women are going straight to heaven.", "author": "Colin F."}

You're not getting white tie service here and honestly, no one credible desire it.

If you had a horrible upbringing, I suggest  you come here for the therapeutic experience.\n\nImperial rolls here are huge and delicious; whatever you order you have to get something with it.  If you're a monster, order the #5, it has every animal split and grilled over a huge mound of meat sauce and rice.  Put some of that hot sauce on it and you're pretty damn close to some Biblical paradise that doesn't even exist, so throw those stupid ass books away and come here and eat some real food.  \n\nPS it's BYOB here, so bring your favorite alcoholic beverage!

The chicken was a bit charred but sooo tender and marinated yummily, that I had every piece of meat on the bone that wasn't charred. \n\nAdditionally, the red special sauce mixed with the rice and cole slaw was definitely an insane combination.

Practically we were the first customer. Lucky for us since this place only has a few seating. We can watch the lady cooking our meal. I was looking into the very interesting meatsauce and thought that looks like Chinese style spaghetti sauce. Someone came in an just order rice and meat sauce, and we thought Great, they like it, must be good. Came to our turn, the portion was huge. I ordered the special roast chicken and rice, and my bunny ordered the combo that came with chicken, meat and egg roll. The rice tasted al dente. I thought this was odd since rice should be fully cooked, you know, not like spaghetti. The meatsauce was the worst thing on that plate. There were some faint weird taste on that sauce. Wait...what was the taste? Oh yeah, taste like chlorine to me. I couldn't finish my meal :( The chicken as well... Not so great. The thigh part was ok but the breast was dried. Maybe not their best day? I dunno. The price was very cheap, though, especially to think that one plate can be shared for 2. The lady was nice too.", "author": "fenny g."}

People will find something to complain about, won't they?\n\nFor instance, little frowny harrumphs about Cordon Bleu not being authentically Vietnamese.  Someone came to this admittedly homely, dozen-seat hole in the wall expecting the full authentic panoply of the complex cuisine of a very large country like Vietnam?  Really?  I came for the pork chops.  \n\nOr the straight-faced, slightly furrowed-brow observation that the food is perhaps, well, Americanized.  Well, yeah.  They have to buy the chicken, the pork, the cabbage, the water, and for all I know the 5-spice powder here in, yes, America.  They're serving cheap, tasty, filling meals to--yeah, Americans, mostly.  Americans with Chinese, Vietnamese, Russian, Korean, Chinese, Polish, Italian, German, English, Samoan, Indian, Pinoy, Japanese, and Dutch surnames, and occasionally, palettes.  Have you had Chinese food in Italy?  Newsflash:  It's Italianized.  I haven't found any Vietnamese food in Italy (yet) but I am guessing it will be Italianized too.  You mean western food in China isn't, well, Chinatized?  As far as I know, western food in Vietnam is definitely Vietnamized.  That's kind of the point of Vietnamese food, isn't it?\n\nWhat the hell are we talking about here people?  A place like Cordon Bleu isn't supposed to be a laboratory to transport you through the time-space continuum to a lunch counter in Ho Chi Minh City!  Such a culinary feat only happens on rare occasions (see my review of Divino) and really, shouldn't be attempted, much less expected.\n\nThe only culinary feat that should be evaluated here is:  How was your pork chop?   What did you think of that chicken?  Wasn't that Imperial Roll good?\n\nMy pork chops, both carryout and hot on the plate, effing rocked my tastebuds.  My chicken fell off the bone and slathered my tongue with unctuous flavor and made me want to moan like a cheap porn star.  My little beef strips have me calculating my next opportunity to eat them again.\n\nThat's all that should count here, people.  That, and the fact that the hardworking staff here are sweet, funny, sassy, kind, and produce some kickass flavors.\n\nIf it's too Westernized for you, or not authentically Vietnamese enough for you, my sincere apologies.

Many things were running through my head when I first sat down, including the tiny size of the place, the one little lady cooking like crazy behind the counter and of course the mouth watering smell of the food she was grilling up. My friend turned to me at this point and said \"Dont be scared, this is really good\". To be honest, I needed a little reassurance!! This isn't exactly a fine dining establishment. But I was brave and buzzed and ready to eat whatever that delicious smell was.\nMan was he right. Some of the best food we have had in a while actually. My Husband and I shared the grilled chicken breast with \"meat sauce\" and a couple spring rolls. All of which were exploding with flavor and down-home asain cooking. The meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned with seriously delicious asain spices. The \"meat sauce\" was so unique, I guess I would describe it as an Asain gravy. The spring rolls were lightly fried and packed with veggies.The best way I can describe it would be that it was like Katie, the Cook/Owner had invited us to a backyard BBQ at her house. \nThe atmosphere was warm, inviting and friendly and the food was nothing short of awesome.

It's a ten seat counter with faux Vietnamese food served for Polk Gulch scenesters on a budget. 80% of the menu is served in \"meat sauce\". As best as I can tell, it's definitely \"meat\", but the rest of the ingredients remain a mystery to me. I'd rather not ask to be completely honest.\n\nWhat makes Cordon Bleu remarkable is the amazingly efficient staff. One woman, who happens to be the owner, cooks your meal on a stove about 2 feet from the counter. She will also take to-go orders, work the cash register, hand out menus, appease drunk diners, visit with \"regulars\", tell John T he is a nice singer. There is also another woman who preps the meat and rice in the back room, and one dishwasher guy who well...washes dishes.\n\nThe owner manages to handle all these responsibilities while operating in a work place about 50 square feet. AMAZING. She is my hero.\n\nTomorrow, when I'm writing C# code in my cubicle, I'm going to multi-task too. Maybe drink coffee AND tea in two different cups. Maybe. 4 stars.", "author": "John T."}

The food was pure deliciousness.  Flash forward to today.  The original owners gone, along with their delicious food.  The meat sauce is a bland tomatoey sauce.  There is more salt than flavor in the shish kebab.  The imperial roll may be big but that's different too.  It was lighter and crispier.  \nThe only thing that is the same is the fish sauce.

The menu is pretty basic. Meat and rice and a couple variations, but the most expensive thing I saw was $8.50. I knew immediately I'd like this place. \n\nI should however start at the beginning. We did not make reservations, I'm not sure that you can, so we showed up at about 8 p.m. Saturday night. Every seat was taken, but there wasn't a line. We went inside, expressed our desire to be seated, and were told \"just a few minutes\" and in an effort to not be rude to other customers, we went outside.  About 5 minutes later, a group of 4 occupying two of the three actual tables left and we sat ourselves down. \n\nI ordered the #5...which if memory serves included the spiced chicken, rice, meat kabob, salad, and imperial roll. My companion ordered the Pork Chop meal, and a chicken combo...he was very hungry and indecisive. In the downtime, we discuss how very quite the place is for being so small, low conversations and the grill are the only sources of noise, there's no music and no cooks shouting orders. \n\nOur canned cokes were delivered promptly, and the BF's plain salad (but the dressing was good) but wait, didn't my meal include a salad too? Maybe, i don't remember. Or maybe they're bring it, I'll just wait. \n\nA few minutes later the waitress brings a heaping plate of chicken, rice and cabbage. The BF receives a heaping plate of rice and pork chops. The lady says to the BF \"I'll be right back with one more pork chop\" a few minutes later she delivers one with her tongs fresh from the grill. Amazing. \n\nSo, everything seems to be in order, but wait, didn't ! order a meal with a roll of some sort and a kabob? And didn't the BF get some chicken too? Well either something was lost in translation or we misread the menu. But, I'm not too concerned cause the food was amazing. and I was very satisfied after eating about 1/4 of what was on my plate. \n\nThe best part: we left full with ample leftovers for a midnight snack, all for $25. \n\nWe'll definitely be back, but we'll be careful to communicate our orders more clearly. \n\nAnd bring cash, they don't' take anything else.", "author": "Lara L."}

Does it really assuage your corporate guilt or make you feel that much cooler to come here? \n\nThe food's alright if you need something cheap, substantial and fast, but it doesn't really stretch beyond that. Five spice chicken ($5.75) was two huge pieces of grilled chicken, the skin all blackened and crispy and with a slight hint of the spice flavor but nothing distinctive. Because the pieces were so big, this flavor couldn't really seep into the white meat inside which tasted fairly bland.\n\nThe shish kebab ($2.60) was more disappointing. It's not really a shish kebab - skewered chunks of meet - more thin strips of pork streaked with black lines from the grill. It had reasonably smoky flavor but again nothing all that special. \n\nIn the menu set this came with an Imperial roll which I changed to a fresh Vietnamese spring roll. This was vegetarian with some tofu inside. It didn't taste bad, but the things inside seemed a little bland and it didn't really have that crispness of fresh vegetables which the best Vietnamese spring rolls can give. It came with a thick peanut sauce akin to peanut butter.\n\nIn the sets we had (numbers 1 and 4), both these dished were plonked on a pile of white rice that had been covered in meat sauce. This sauce has hints of tomato ketchup about it and little pieces of pork. It gave the rice some flavor but really didn't do much more. The 'country salad' which accompanies is really just a small heap of shredded cabbage.  \n\nPeople will probably keep coming here for that 'mom and pop' feel. But there are definitely better places within walking distance for around the same price. If you're looking for Vietnamese then brave the crazies of the Tenderloin and head down Larkin Street. If you want kebabs, hit Myconos Greek restaurant, or De Afghanan Kabob House, which are both nearby on Polk.   \n\nWe had food to take away, calling over the phone first.

The decor is simple, the atmosphere is simple/casual and the food is simple. They only serve four things. Grilled pork, grilled chicken, imperial roll, and noodle salad. That's it! It's kinda like how In-N-Out only has burger, cheeseburger and double burger (yes, I know there are the \"secret codes,\" but I just mean on the basic menu). But with simplicity comes perfection. Everything is tasty and is ridcockulously cheap and with large proportions, and they have combos that combine the items.\n\nI've spent time considerable time in Vietnam and the noodle salad is very similar to the type of noodles you'll get from a pho stall in Ha Noi or Pho Tho.  So its very authentic. \n\nFellas, this is a great place to go on a date to show her you are hip and know all the cool hide away type places.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-17", "description": "Come Meet Katie. She'll tell you what's the word on the street!\n\nNO really. This restaurant can duo as both a social lounge and a eatery. It's a small quaint place so be ready to say \"hello\" to your next door neighbor's elbows. It's as big as an average home's kitchen but it's got a heart of gold. There's only one long counter so many people wait in line outside the restaurant to get a seat. Katie is the owner and you'll see her behind the counter almost everyday. If you can get past looking at what a real restaurant kitchen looks like, then you can really enjoy the food here. If not, then perhaps this might not be your spot.\n\nWhy is this place so charming? Because you feel at HOME in this place. It's not much when you walk in. A typical mom and pop of SF. The real charm is the mojo of this place. Katie knows her customers well and has a charisma like no other. She listens to you and boy is she funny. All of the cooking is done in front of you so you know there's no funny business. The menu is small and not super vegetarian friendly but that's okay. Tell Katie and she makes magic happen. \n\nMy coworker and I ordered the garlic tofu/veggie combo plate. One would expect the typical fare that most Asian restaurants; a small entree plate with a side of rice. Here, you have to wear your sun glasses because what you get will blow you away. Katie loads up your whole plate with rice and then drapes your entree on it like if it were velvet on your skin. She uses a whole box of tofu just for you and boy is the tofu tasty. The garlic sauce she makes (which can be made without oyster sauce) coats your tongue and although it can make you a fire breathing dragon, its soo warm and tasty. \n\nIn addition to the entree, we got the imperial roll. MAN o MAN is this a bad boy. SO bad. I kinda wanted to take this in the corner and show it how bad it was but hic! sorry this is not the right channel for that! The imperial roll is a large spring roll but it has something imperial about it. I say it has something imperial about it because I REALLY have no idea what's in it. I do know that its the BEST roll i've ever had and that says a lot. Especially since I'm vegetarian. It's got portabella mushrooms in it and the noodles are marinated in some sauce which gives it a black tinge. This alone can serve as your lunch or dinner but I bet you that this won't be it... My coworker always says that her stomach button malfunctions in here. It's like your stomach doesn't turn off. You just want to keep eating and eating. The food makes you super full and when no one is looking (which is hard in this place) you yearn to release the top button of your pants. \n\nHad enough food? Then have some tea with Katie. Tell her your problems. If you're having issues with finding someone to date, she'll suggest you some passerby's. She knows her regulars and she's a pretty good judge of character. I think the best part of this place is that if you're new to the city, you have the opportunity to make an instant friend. Everyone at the counter (whether they are naturally friendly or not) interacts with one another. I dunno what makes this happen but I suspect it's this: MAGIC. Okay, okay. Not a kid anymore BUT, it is magic to see all walks of life both young and old laugh with one another over warm, home style food. Yum.\n\nOkay, so lets do a recap. 2 garlic tofu/veggie entrees. Check. One large Imperial roll. Check. 2 small egg rolls (which Katie threw in for free because I was curious).  Double Check. 2 Jasmine Teas. Check. Total: $21 bucks. REALLY? COME ON. You can not beat that. Tip her well and show her the love she showed you.\n\nI'll tell you another thing. If you pass a homeless guy on California street and they see you holding these left overs, they ARE going to ask for it. True story and yes, they got the left overs but boy do you wanna kick yourself for being a good Samaritan. Damn you angelic conscience! \n\nThis is a gem of a place so keep your eyes peeled for it. It's easy to miss because it is a small place but if you find it, you won't be disappointed. Katie is a hard worker and you'll see all the love she puts into her food.

As it happens to be on my commute, I decided to stop by and peak in.  The area is tight and consists only of one main bar table and two (?) small tables off to the sides.  Despite the limited space, it's crowded with eager folks who've already placed their orders or those onlookers waiting for a table.  I opted to order the combo plate of 5-spice chicken, meat slices, and imperial rolls with meat sauce over rice to-go.  \nAnd when I finally opened it up back at home -- it was so very good.  The chicken was moist and the meat just fell right off the bones.  The marinade of the meat was done so well that it made me forget about having waited the extra 10 minutes for it.  The imperial roll was crispy and flavored well w/o being too salty.  And the meat sauce?  Although it seemed kinda ghetto, it was...  hearty and good.\nCordon Bleu?

The owner asked if I wanted change and I said no it's the people before us. And in disbelief she said really? and I said yes. Then she made a comment that caught me and the people next to me offguard and said \"all you people look alike\". Ofcourse I was shocked but laughed. Ofcourse if it would have been the other way around it would have been very offensive and the place would have probably shut down.\nRegardless I definitely like the place and will definitely come back.

It took me awhile to check it out myself because I'm not too into 5 spice, but when I finally tried it it was fabulous. I ended up getting the noodle salad which came with really tasty pork and delicious eggroll. By calling it noodle salad, rather than the Vietnamese Vermicelli noodles with pork, I was thinking it might taste more like a Chinese dish rather than Vietnamese dish as it states. It really was delicious and sooooo much better than the Viet version at Minh Tri's. My husband ordered the #5 and he got that meat sauce...I tried a tiny bit of it but it just didn't look appealing to me so I didn't grub off his plate as much as I thought I would. I do agree that they should use different tongs for the raw vs cooked meats, but other than that...food was great and I didn't have high expectations for ambiance so no complaints on that front. Great hole in the wall place, limited menu makes for easy ordering. Also, I think this restaurant is more Vietnamese/Chinese than Vietnamese. \n\nThere was only 1 young waitress and another woman (the cook). The waitress really cracked me up...she didn't seem to speak much English...If you order straight from the menu as-is, then she's fine with taking the order...Any special requests can get confusing for her and the customer trying to communicate with her, which may cause her to walk away and giggle with her hand covering her mouth - at which point the cook comes in to translate and take the order.

Next time somebody asks me what my favorite BBQ in the city is I get to say, \"Cordon Bleu... it's Vietnamese.\"", "author": "Trevor F."}

As far as the food, it's a GREAT bang for the buck.  I ordered the number one which consisted of a huge plate of rice with meat sauce, a salad, some awesome beef, and a crispy egg roll.  Was the quality of the food fantastic? Not particularly.  Was it a great meal for 6.55? YES!  I would definitely go back here.

I haven't lived in CA since 1989 but I still long for their food and can't wait to get myself back so I can go there again. For two young kids who barely had two nickels to rub together and lived in a residence hotel, Cordon Bleu kept us fed, well, for a long long time. Cordon Bleu got me through a nine month bout with morning sickness; it was literally the only thing I could eat during my pregnancy, and probably the reason my son has a real love of Asian cuisine.\n\nTheir Imperial rolls are the bar to which I hold all fried rolls. Their five spice chicken? Is unequaled anywhere else, from CA to Alaska, as far as I'm concerned. I've finally mastered the chicken cabbage salad, but while mine is good, it's not \"Cordon Bleu good\". Their Pho soup? Divine. (Do they still make that?)\n\nI'm dying to know what's in that meat sauce, and would love even something only vaguely resembling a recipe. I can't even describe it well enough when I go into Vietnamese restaurants for them even to hazard a guess as to what it is, or what could be in it. (Should I be afraid?)\n\nIf anyone could get me a recipe (or even an ingredients list!) I'd be most thankful!

Not quite the best place for dinner, unless it's your beer buddy or roommate whom you see all the time anyway. \n\nClosed on Mondays.", "author": "Charles J."}

My gurts and i went to cordon blue on the recommendation of a coworker and had the same reservations when we peeked inside interested in a quick meal before a night of karaoke goodness next door at Encore.  We did, however, go inside just before the rush and were pleasantly surprised at the service and yumminess of the food.  We each ordered a #1...shish kabob, rice with meat sauce, imperial roll and salad.  It was super delish!  the shish kabob meat was cooked perfectly and was super umami,   the rice was the perfect stickiness and covered in the sweet/tangy/meaty sauce, the salad was crisp and lemon-y and the imperial rolll was crispy and hearty (filled with veggies and pork) and not at all greasy.  Some guy ordered chicken but left before it was ready, so the ladies let us have that, too...sweet jumping jeebus!  It made me realize that, as good as everything else was, the chicken is soooo the business!  crispy skin, tender juicy meat, and flavorfull through out.  So if you're in the area, dont be afraid to stop by, your taste buds will be richly rewarded!!!", "author": "Rena H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-07-01", "description": "Best food ever. EVERRRRRRRRRR.  Vietnamese country-style food served up by a nice lady by the name of Katie.  Be aware that all of the entrees & specials come with hot tea included in the price (this is only indicated at the bottom of the entrees section where it says \"tea is not included with a la carte orders\") and they should give you free refills on the tea as well if you ask for more or if they notice that your cup is running low, but ask if you want more.  Highly recommended: the #5 (five-spice chicken, imperial roll, rice with meat sauce, country salad (which is a cold vinegared cabbage dish) and the shish kabob, which is less like what you would think of when you think of like a Greek kabob and more like Vietnamese bacon - $7.95), the noodle salad (rice noodles with a yummy sauce, imperial roll, shish kabob and lots of veggies- great hot weather food - $7.00) and the spicy pork chop (3 big pork chops, which are not actually spicy, but awesomely tender, over rice with green onions which comes with a not-really-worth mentioning iceberg/tomato salad - $7.95).  The chicken salad is okay, but the noodle salad is way better.  They offer vegetarian dishes, but they're not that great, and the same goes for the ma po tofu - meh.  Not recommended for germaphobes - so you people go to restaurants without open kitchens where you can't see all the gross things they do to your good (I bet this place is cleaner than many).  Tiny place, only a couple of wobbly tables, so expect to sit at the counter.  I go here with my boyfriend often and I love getting so much delicious food that I have to get a second wind halfway through eating for $20 including a generous tip.  Oh, and please don't turn off the light in the bathroom - it turns off the lights by the table as well and then an employee has to go turn it back on.", "author": "Green T."}

I get the #3 with no meat sauce (sacrilege?) and a little extra of the sweet sauce on the side topped off with some rooster. Never left hungry. Never left unsatisfied. Having to wait sometimes for a seat due to its size can suck, but you can't knock them a star for that. Only takes cash, but can't knock the hustle either.", "author": "M.F. J."}

The woman who runs this place (it's been around for 40 years!  who ate Vietnamese 40 years ago?) is really nice and gives me tea when it's cold outside (which is all the time in SF)  It's not haute cusine, it won't win awards for interior design, but it is simple food, good food in a convivial atmosphere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-09-28", "description": "Great little hole-in-the-wall dining experience with good food. The meat sauce over the rice was interesting and tasty (sort of a Chef Boyardee experience, Vietnamese style), but I think in the future I'll opt for the white rice with scallions a friend ordered with his pork chops (which he likened to jerky - in a good way). I could see the meat sauce becoming the type of thing you crave, though, like SpaghettiO's with meatballs (which I recognize are FrancoAmerican, not Chef Boyardee). The five spice roast chicken lived up to expectations. I can see why it's a favorite here. But, for me, the best items were the \"shish kebabs\" (really blackened strips of steak - no skewers) and imperial rolls. In fact, I give the prize to the imperial rolls. Crisp, bubbly wrappers overflowing with meaty filling. Another patron was shoveling in the noodles and it looked really satisfying, so maybe I'll get them next time. With imperial rolls on the side, of course.", "author": "Veronica L."}

I walked by one day (2007) while walking in my new neigborhood (Nob Hill) at the time and smelled this incredibly grilled chicken. I walked right in, asked what it was & ate half a chicken in 10 minutes. It was so flagrant, tender and succulent that I wanted more but didn't want to feel like a glutton so ate the side salad (which was also tangy & tasty) and just meditated (or marinated)...om..om...yum...yuuuum : ) And Katie, the proprietor is the most incredibly funny, smart, sweet, stylish person in the biz. So down to earth but works way too hard. The Chicken salad is also good and the veggie roles are da bomb baby.. The venue inside is like a small & cozy like Al Diner from the 70's tv show \"Alice\" but not too small where you don't feel like eveyrone knows your name (Cheers). The PERFECT date place. Thanks Katie. we love you. Michael Dorame (find me on Facebook y'all) : )", "author": "Michael D."}

I needed to go to a bank and it was right next door to a WAMU.  Since I found a sweet parking spot; hard to do in SF, I decided to hang around the area before going to my next client.  I saw the blue awning that said \"5-Spice Chicken\".  I walked in and the place reminded me of Yamo's, except a bit brighter and cleaner.  The prices on the menu is a bit more than Yamo's but I gave it a shot anyway.  I saw the 5-spice chicken and asked how long it takes to prepare, because of my upcoming appointment.  The lady with the nice smile stated that it's fast.  So I went for it.  Man, was it good!  The chicken was tender, the slaw was OK, and the rice with meat sauce was awesome.  The portion was worth the price and I couldn't believe I finished the whole thing.  The cook saw how clean my plate was and asked, with that great smile again, if it was my first time.  I said it was and it will not be my last.  I saw her prepare the deep fried egg rolls, and it looks like something to come back for.", "author": "Nino M."}

It only seats about 8 people so you might have to wait but it is worth it.  The several reasons I like this place are as follows:  For $6.55 you can get a combo plate of really good imperial rolls, meat or roasted chicken, cabbage salad and rice with a magical meat sauce on top.  I asked the owner if she would fill a jar of the meat sauce for me to take to go - it's that good.  I also like to watch my food being made and the counter seating fits that requirement.  The place is tiny and sometimes even smoky, not a problem for me, but maybe for others.  The only thing I don't like, and this knocks a 5 star rating down to 4 is that they have the chicken marinating at room temperature, in a pan of the floor.  There were some things that looked a little unsanitary in there.  I'm usually good with smaller divey mom and pops, in fact I prefer them, but having experienced the joys of salmonella ( not from here ) it scares me a little.", "author": "Soups C."}
