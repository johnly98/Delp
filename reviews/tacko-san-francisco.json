As good as food is in Holland, Spain, Morocco and Portugal, we have them all beat hands down, when it comes to Mexican food.  \n\nI've been here on numerous occasions, specifically for the Nicks' Way tacos (steak) and burritos.  The Nicks' Way tacos are unique in that they use both a soft tortilla as well as a crispy tortilla in a single taco, so I like the variation in texture.  However, it's something like $5.00 for a taco that I can consume in less than 5 minutes.  Nothing special about their burritos.  \n\nI do really like their green salsa, though, which I use in such voluminous amounts that it would probably easier for me to get it through an intravenous infusion!  It's delicious on any of their items you put it on.\n\nTheir chips have really improved recently.  Previously, they served super hard tortilla chips that were usually brown from over frying.  Or Lord forbid, they double fried day old chips.  Who knows. Instead, now, they have chips that are perfectly firm and never seem to be over fried.  However, why aren't the chips complimentary?  They're not! Come on, just give your customers a good couple of handfuls if they're purchasing an item, whether they enjoy it on the premises or as take out.  That's plain stingy for the overinflated prices they are already charging.  \n\nAlso, be ready to wait an extraordinary long time if you're getting take out when they're busy.  I've waited for 20 minutes for one burrito at noon, and nearly missed an appointment.  I had no idea the wait time for a take out burrito would be anywhere near that long.  Staff is also indifferent, and not at all friendly.   \n\nTacko is definitely a popular, but a trendy Americanized \"taqueria\".  The vibe is fun and lively, especially at the peak of lunch or in the heart of dinner.  However,  you'll pay nearly twice as much as you would at a place in the Mission, and get decent, but unauthentic Mexican food. Shouldn't be surprising.  After all, how many authentic Mexican restaurants have prints of upscale, exclusive Nantucket covering their walls? I can tell you, the answer to that is none!\n\nPersonally, for food, especially take out, I prefer the significantly less trendy, but more authentic taqueria, Los Hermanos, about a 5 minute walk away on Chestnut Street, in the Marina.  Los Hermanos also provides better value and has a rare 100 out of 100 S.F. health rating.  It's fine for what it is, but opt for somewhere else, other than Nick's, if you're in search of real authentic Mexican food, in an authentic Mexican setting.", "author": "Lori N."}

On a Friday night, our options were a little more limited unless we wanted to wait 45 minutes. We turned down a random street and found this gem! It wasn't too crowded, and the service was fairly quick for how many people were in there. We tried the San Diego and San Francisco burritos. I must first say that I LOVE that they offer a burrito with no beans and rice! That filler is not for me (hubby loves rice & beans, so he was happy too!). \nThe guacamole is great! Very fresh, creamy, maybe a hint of lime, and onions. Super yum! My burrito was a little wetter than I anticipated and fell apart. Hubby loved his, but wished for a dollop more sour cream. \n\nThe noise level was intense - we couldn't talk to each other across the table.

I'd say Mexi-Cal, but it's not, it's strongly Californian.\nI live near Nick's Crispy Taco's and have tried them  a couple of times. They're fine. I think the best part of Nick's is that they're in a bar. Full disclosure: never got taco's Nick's Way -- but I'm more of a quesadilla gal or a burrito gal. \nSo, anyway, when Caviar had a no fee delivery promotion, I decided to try Tacko. \n\nSo glad I did! I got the carne asada (Kobe beef -- yes! It rises above) and the Elote (amazingly delicious with the lime crema!) and the Skinny Guacamole (no chips, but cucumber, jicama, radish, & carrots. -- skip the carrots), I was surprised. \n\nWhy, you may ask.\n\nWell, because the quesadilla was cooked on the grill, with plenty of cheese on the tortilla, making it perfectly crispy, browned to perfection. That's how I want all my burritos to be! But I keep getting steamed ugh ugh. The amount of meat they put into the quesadilla was insane! Delicious!\n\nThe Elote was such a great corn on the cob. I've lived in Iowa and we pride ourselves on the best corn in the world -- so I know corn. This cob was sweet, easy to eat, delicious and with just the right amount of crema, cojita and cayenne to make it perfect.\n\nFinally, the Skinny Guacamole was surprising. I love all the veggies in the mix -- the only thing: the large rounds of carrots were a little less crisp than the cake, jicama & radish. Next time, I'll probably skip the carrot. And you can -- you can customize your order to what you like.\n\nAll in all, 5 stars!", "author": "Yasi S."}

Street parking can be a bit difficult to find and the line tends to get long. If you're planning to dine in, have someone order the food and the other stand in line to buy it. My cousin and her family were fortunate to be able to find a table to sit the five of us. It gets packed and busy in waves, but for the most part, it's busy and on the expensive end. I ordered 3 street tacos for $7 but they were super mini tacos. I was a little upset with the portion I received because at any other local taco spot I could get BIGGER TACOS for that price. I was left hungry and munched on the chips we ordered and I also ate my nieces chicken quesadilla. The chicken quesadilla was more expensive, but it was bigger and more filling than my order. We also had an order of elote corns. Water is self-serve, but unlike any other spot, you have an option for sparkling water. The table set up has some sauces and some utensils, but you can grab additional utensils on the side where you pick up food and get water. If you wish to take your leftovers to go you can go by the front door where you put dishes away and there are brown bags and foil that you can use to place your food in. There's only one bathroom and that's a downfall because there can be a long line for it. I would come back here to order their chicken quesadilla this time, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it as well. I would only come back here if I am already in the area. If you live near this location I would recommend you to give it a try, but be prepared to wait longer than your typical taqueria.", "author": "Danika P."}

Although prices are a little high, the quality of ingredients is equally high, from the chicken (all shredded breast meat and not dry at all) to the beef and carnitas.  \n\nAlthough some of the recipes / menu items seem suspiciously similar to La Taqueria in the Mission (my favorite  burrito / taco spot in SF), I really don't care since La Taqueria is on the other side of the city.  For those of you a little health conscious, the salad is phenomenal, and is actually filling.  \n\nThe award for most disappointing menu items goes to the lobster roll, which was not only small, but also filled with rubbery over-cooked lobster and very bland.

There's an option to get tacos Nick's Way (with cheese, beans, pico de gallo & guac), but those aren't part of $2 Taco Tuesdays and they're pretty expensive ($5.50-5.75 for one taco). Plus, their meat is poorly executed, I'm not sure extra toppings will save them.. Tough, lacking flavor. The best was the carne asada, but even that I wouldn't want again.\n\n* MEXICAN \"STREET STYLE\" TACOS (normally $7.75 for all 3, $2 each on Tues)\n[topped w/ cilantro & onions on small corn tortillas]\n- Carne Asada - 3/5 - decent flavor but overcooked and chewy\n- Carnitas - 2/5 - rather bland and disappointingly tough and dry\n- Pollo - 1/5 - dry and bland, even when drenched in the salsa in the bottles on the table", "author": "Jessie L."}

Tacko is most certainly not that, but that isn't a bad thing with respect to the service and atmosphere. Tacko has instead adopted an interestingly East Coast vibe that's even reflected on their menu with dishes like Lobster Rolls and guacamole without chips. It's different, but it's exceptionally clean and comfortable. You place your order, take your number, and wait to be served soon after. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nI'm a huge fan of authentic Mexican street style tacos, so that's what I lunged at when I saw a trifecta of street tacos on the menu for $7.50. These tacos weren't large, but at $2.50 they weren't unreasonably priced. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nSo I ordered three cream puffs:\n\nYou know what these were just okay if I'm being honest. the tortillas were good, but the meats didn't really bring the flavor in a way that I'm used to with Mexican street tacos. The chicken taco in particular needed some serious salsa to keep it from being dry and relatively flavorless, and both the carne asada and carnitas lacked that sort of moist and pungently flavorful quality that you find elsewhere. Single Star Granted.\n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nTacko is a neat concept, and I understand why it gets the attention that it does, but I can't honestly say that the tacos themselves are on par with some of the elite offerings in the city.

That's when I knew I probably wouldn't get an authentic burrito from this place. However, I was delighted to see that Tacko makes burritos in different styles. They offer it Mexican style, Mission style, San Diego Style, and California style (comes with fries). My boyfriend ordered the California burrito while I ordered the San Diego burrito, both with chicken. Too bad my worries came true. We ate the whitest tasting burritos of our lives..The chicken was dry, bland, and all breast meat. Even the sauces that were at the table didn't have much flavor or spice at all. I found myself dousing each bite with sauce just to add flavor and moisture to the burrito. Even without the addition of sauce my burrito tasted mostly of pico de gallo.

I live 2 blocks away so by the time I got over there to pick it up ~10  min later it was ready and waiting. \n\nThe staff is always so friendly here - really nice people who go out of their way to help. No different this time, the server asked if I wanted chips and salsa, I said yes and asked for additional salsa which he happily gave me. \n\nSo I get home and am eager to break into this delicious salad. But when I open it up I sadly realize there is no carne asada on it. This was a big bummer for 2 reasons: first, it's like $5 to add carne asada, and second, it's sooooo tasty. \n\nSo I call up to ask about it. The lady on the phone is immediately very apologetic. She offers to refund the purchase in whole or offers that I can come back for a side container of carne asada. I opt for the latter since I'm only two blocks away. When I get there, she again apologizes profusely and hands over a very generous portion of carne asada in a side container. On top of that, she also says she refunded my transaction! \n\nThe level of humble apology and service was totally unexpected and definitely made an initially unfortunate experience right (more than necessary, I would have been happy with just the extra meat). \n\nJust another reason to continue to frequent Tacko (on top of the delicious food!).

I called and someone put me on hold, after 10 min on hold I hung up and tried calling back but couldn't get through. \n\nAdvice # 1. Please add the \"call waiting feature\", it's pretty annoying to be sent to VM because the phone is off the hook. Which means I would have actually been on hold for 15 minutes. More like forgotten.\n\nWhen the call finally went through the man who picked up the phone sounded really sick or hungover (hopefully hungover?) But we managed to get through the order. \n\nSide note: you know when you say \"thank you, bye\" to the other person on the phone and they already hung up? Well, that happened. Which look, I've worked in busy restaurants before where I had to answer multiple phones at once. I know what busy feels like. \n\nAdvice # 2. Don't hang up before the client says thank you and good bye. Those 2 seconds you might save in that moment, will cost you a lot more later. \n\nSo I arrive to pick up my order. I was curious how busy the restaurant was going to be due to the weird phone interaction. To my surprise, not busy at all. Maybe understaffed, I don't know. \n\n***Well actually metaphorically speaking, yes, very understaffed***\n\nThe same guy I spoke with on the phone is the one at the cashier, pretty sure he's even a manager. The reason I think this is because he's the only one who was on his cellphone the entire time I was standing there, and he generally just seemed like he maybe owned the place too. You know, smug-ish. \n\nYet unlike many other restaurant owners and managers I've known, he didn't seem very proud of his workplace. Wrinkled shirt, messy hair, and all around bad attitude. \nI feel kind of bad bringing this up... but it was honestly kind of shocking how bad of a look he had.\n\nMy whole order was wrong. He didn't even order my sandwich, and the sides were wrong and he also forgot the two drinks. He still charged me for the sandwich though afterwards. Even though I had to wait for them to make it. I think I barely got an apology or a thank you. \n\nAdvice # 3. Don't do a job you hate so much, or find a way to love everything you do. You won't only affect your customers but also the other employees who work around you / for you. Be an example to follow. Smile at your customers. \n\nThis place has been good before and I'm sure once they fix their internal problems it will be good again. Maybe I'll pop my head in a few months and see what's going on. \n\nGood luck Tacko.", "author": "Briana G."}

The shell of the tacos were very weird, as if they weren't properly cooked, they had a soft top shell but a hard under shell. The carne asada was delicious but there were beans in the actual taco and it wasn't listed on the menu posted. I'm not a big fan of beans, and I never order them so I was a little irked, but I powered through. The guac on the tacos was the best part.

It's happened so many times it's now a joke between my friends - weather or not the burrito will made correctly and if it will be chicken. Sadly there actually usually is always something wrong. Other times I will make an addition on the burrito which I have yet to receive. Tonight over half my burrito was a huge chunk of meat the size of my fist.

There are a good amount of options on the menu, and I settled with the California burrito (no pico) since it's one of my favorites from back home. \n\nFood was delivered pretty quick, and aside from the two salsa options at each table, there are tons of hot sauce options. The burrito itself was just okay. The tortilla was a little too crunchy and dry, and combined with the meat and fries (which were super-seasoned homestyle potatoes) and lack of sauce - it wasn't really a pleasant texture. I had to keep adding salsa to aid in chewing all those carbs, so it probably would have been best to add guacamole or some sour cream.\n\nSince it was packed, we got stuck eating at the bar counter next to the front door. The stools are crazy uncomfortable, mostly because there is no foot rest so my feet were dangling a foot off the floor like a little kid. Luckily, someone at one of the bench tables left so we nabbed it in the middle of our meal. \n\nIf you don't mind forking over $10 for a burrito, this place will do the trick if you're in the Marina.

Ended up ordering one of each of their street tacos and a Baja fish taco. Now my rating is based on all the tacos overall if I just ordered beef it would be 5 stars. \n\nBeef taco was 5/5 it was amazing. I'm not normally a beef taco fan I prefer shrimp fish or pork but this was by far the best. Awesome. \n\nChicken taco 3/5 it was ok, nothing too special. Have had better but also have had much worse. Generally chicken are my least favorite but wanted to give theirs a shot. \n\nPork Taco 2/5 was really disappointed. Anyone who has had real Mexican street tacos knows that pork are always the best and most authentic/popular. They are also usually my favorite but these really lacked any flavor and the texture was too chunky IMO. \n\nBaja Fish (nicks way) 3.5/5 this was pretty damn good but the fish itself lacked flavor and or seasoning. It also tasted quite 'fishy' in the way fresh fish should not. It was also missing the pico that was supposed to come with the nicks way. \n\nOverall it was a great choice and I would go back for just the beef tacos and maybe try a burrito.", "author": "Matt M."}

It's made from agave wine. \n4- Like shopping for that luxury purse, don't even ask how much their lobster roll will cost (market price).  Just take out your credit card, pay the good man the toll and say Geronimo! This ride will take your first bite from Nantucket to SFO within 15 mins. Like that girl group  Fifth Harmony sang....\"baby I'm worth it!\" Every bite to the penny. That buttery lobster goodness will make you wet (in the mouth..)\n5- Guac over everything. \n6-Elote con queso: I've never been so full off $3! it's the best and cheapest lunch in the marina!! \n7- want a taco? When it's not Tuesday, ALWAYS make it Nick's way. \n8- ARE YOU HUNGOVER? get a San Diego burrito with the fries inside and Watermelon juice.  That food baby will keep you afloat working for the rest of you shift without taking your nunchucks and whacking a customer (writing from experience).\n9- Call in your order and its ready for pick up within 10/15 mins.

We were searching for food but the RIGHT food. Being that we were visitors of SF, it only made sense that while in the area, we experienced some of SF's best food options. \n\nI myself was on a self proclaimed 'Eat Pray Love' mission, so the eating part needed to be something I would not be able to get at home. We strolled around the street and found nothing to our favor. I will say this is not the area (imo) for tourists looking for a food place to peak their interest. That would be closer to Pier 39. This area seems to be better for people who are familiar with SF and know what they want. After walking up the block a little bit, we decided to double back and try our options here. GREAT CHOICE! \n\nWhen you walk in, the menu is pretty cut and dry with choices of Burritos and  Tacos and combinations, as well as Quesadillas and a few other typical options found at a Taco joint, including corn on the cob with a Mexican twist. We stared at the menu for awhile and decided to go looking for food elsewhere, but while we were here, we would get something to hold us over until we found 'the place' we wanted to be. My travel brother and I were both starving at this point. We ended up both ordering a chicken taco and I added the corn on the cob to my order. \n\nTo our surprise, ONE TACO is VERY fulfilling. Inside was a hard shell and the outside was soft. The filling was abundant & flavorful. I ate the entire deliciousness that was this chicken taco before tasting my first bite of the corn on the cob. It was delightful. Seriously, I would have ordered another if only this one didn't fill me up so greatly. They have unlimited water that is served from some sort of water device that offers spritzer-like water as well as 'spring' water. The spring water was great and this is a big deal because if you love water like I do, then you know not all sips of it are created equally. Now about this corn: It came with some sort of cheese crumbs all over the outside of it. I don't even remember the combination of outside yums that were attached to this corn, but I do remember it was incredibly great ! One bite in and I couldn't stop. I kept biting and eating away even tho my stomach told me to stop. \n\nWe both left extremely full and had to do some walking just to try to get our lives back together. My total was about 9 bucks with for both the taco and the corn on the cob. I caught a glimpse of someone's burrito and it looked LARGE and great !  \n\nMy only sadness is that I have to catch two planes just to get another taste of this food. I liked the atmosphere too. There was outside seating available and inside, pictures depicting Nantucket were all over the wall. It was clean and crispy and the guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful. Even the customers were nice and friendly! I have no complaints......- \n\n- ....well, that one about catching two planes to get there again....\nyeah, that's a complaint. :/ \n\nThey get the elusive five stars because as many tacos as I have had, some with double shells, I've yet to have one that was this good and this fulfilling.", "author": "Januarie Y."}

Recently moved up to SF after finishing school, I began to be burritosick and needed some comfort from a good ol' California burrito. I found this place from a few websites claiming \"top burritos in SF\" and luckily Tackos was just a couple blocks away from where I lived. \n\nRight off the bat, I already knew this wasn't an what it would be by reading the description: *Your choice of meat (strike 1, this should only be carne asada with an underground menu of Adobada), french fries (half strike for being thick cut), cheese (what kind of cheese was this? Did not blend well with the meat. Another half strike), and pico de gallo (strike 3). \n\nFor those who want a quick review:\nWouldn't get the California Burrito again. \n\nContinued Rant for those who are interested: \nWhere's the sour cream? The cheese? Too much cheese. Try spreading the cheese around, I bit into a chunk of it; also the cheese didn't go well with the meat. The meat had too much flavor that it was overwhelming. Also why was the burrito \"toasted\" on the bottom from the grill? To keep the burrito from opening? That's not how you keep it from opening, you use a bigger flour tortilla to help keep it closed. Also, what kind of tortilla was this? I'm expecting a floury, warm, soft tortilla. \n\nSaddened to say, I have yet to find my California Burrito twin up here in the Bay. \n\nThe search continues.", "author": "Robbie P."}

The 30min wait in line was not bad... it gives the eyes a chance to acclimate to the universe that is this strange, strange place.  The walls are white.  Everything is perfect, like a magazine.  They have a nice accessible water-station that you can hit up while in line for the ride.  At this amazing oasis of refreshment, not only do they have REAL glasses, there's also have a machine that dispenses fizzy-water(all for free).  A woman comes to the front for a pick-up order, cradling a dog in her right arm... some little exotic breed with frizzy fur.  Once edging closer to the front of the line, you will have finished your water, prepared for the visual onslaught your eyes will experience.  Behold the aguas frescas.  Wow.  So many colors.  I want them all.  But the woman behind the counter is staring at me.  I need to order, but I can't hesitate and cause a rift.  I haven't even glanced at the menu yet.  Maybe I should have spent less time staring at the huge painted map of the kingdom of Nantucket on the wall, wondering if they're ruled by a benevolent leader who is wise and brave.  \"One American wagyu kobe beef carne asada california burrito for me... and a taco vegetariano for my attorney\"  Did I read it right?  At this point, I'm reconsidering my decision to have eaten the entire cookie before coming here, but the rule of irreversibility is definitely at play in this case.  The show must go on.  The food seems to be taking an eternity, but time moves in a different fashion here.  The hot-sauce choices are so numerous that it takes up two entire shelves on the wall.  Turning to the dining room, in front of you unfolds a montage of guys with boat-shoes.... and woo-girls with dyed blonde hair.  While the well-rehearsed laughs may seem hystrionic at first, they are actually marina mating-calls.  It's important that we don't disrupt them, lest their natural predators become aware of their presence.  The burrito comes.  It is amazing.  With restraint, one can make two meals out of a it... but wait, they already thought of that too!  At the dish/utensil depository, there are foil sheets you can use to wrap up something for later.  Perfect.  \n\nReflecting upon the experience, I admit the prices are a little beyond-proletarian, especially if you indulge in their extensive selection of beverages.  I'm guessing a certain portion of the clientele pays from \"expense accounts\".  \n\nTacko is the latest and greatest venture of Nick Fasanella.

Really wanted to love this place but the disappointment of today's food will probably keep me from coming back. Got the Mexican tacos and elote. All the meat was pretty average. Chicken was the best. That doesn't say much though because the carnitas and carne asada were dry and flavorless. I didn't eat the carne asada since I didn't see the point. I filled up on chips and salsa, which were the best part of the meal. Red and green salsa are tasty. I don't like to much spice so they are my kind of salsa. Elote was fine. Probably better to eat in the restaurant though. Kinda feels like I flushed $15 down the drain. The decor of the place is lovely. I wish the food was too.", "author": "Mag L."}

Score!\n\nI'm no stranger to Nick's Crispy Tacos, and even though I was born and raised on some of the best Mexican food on the planet outside of Mexico in San Diego, I actually quite enjoy his stuff. Sure, it's not authentic Mission or Baja-style Mexican food, but it's a bit of a niche food staple that certainly pleases my palate. However, I live right next to Tortilla Heights where I can get my hands on a taco done \"Nick's Way\" as often as I please, so with this jaunt, it was all about diving into the already much-talked-about rockstar of the menu, the glorious Nantucket lobster roll.\n\nEverything on the menu at Tacko rings in under $8 or so (which is great for this part of town)... except for the lobster roll. It says \"A.Q\" on the menu, and upon inquiry, I learned that it has a price tag of $18. Sure, in comparison to the $4.50 carnitas taco, that may seem pricey, but it's lobster. I almost wouldn't trust consuming it if were any less expensive to be honest with you. A bit of a splurge, but hey -- you only live once.\n\nI can't really make a comparison to an authentic Nantucket lobster roll, but in this case, I totally enjoyed this staple of East Coast comfort. Fresh lobster made with butter, not mayonnaise like so many other places that feature lobster rolls, piled high atop a grilled Acme hot dog roll. Simple, yet absolutely delightful! I'm notorious for not finishing my entire plate of food when I dine out, as I buy into the law of diminishing returns when it comes to eating, but with this bundle of joy, it was good to the last drop. \n\nAn extra bonus to my dining experience at Tacko last night was getting to meet Nick of Nick's Crispy Tacos himself! Style-wise, he looked every bit of the kind of guy who'd be eating lobster rolls in Nantucket, and it was a pleasure getting a chance to rap with him for a hot second.

A really lively place that has a nice open space and many tables as well as bar seats. \n\n[THE FOOD]   4/5\nI bought the Mexican Street Styled Tacos for $7.25. I was pretty happy with these. A sampler of 3 different kinds of tacos including carnitas, pollo, and carne asada. There are a couple of sauces on the side of the tables as well as hot sauce readily available which was great. The tacos had tons of meat and filling inside. So much, that the corn tortillas almost didn't hold it all. Fresh taste and overall delicious. However, could have used maybe a tad bit more seasoning, to make it excellent, but I was definitely satisfied. \n\n[THE VALUE] 4/5\nYou're in a nice area. You're going to have an elevated price for the menu. Although it wasn't dirt cheap, it wasn't terrible either. I do think that I would not have been satisfied with the tacos if I was very hungry coming in, but then they have burritos and other entrees for hungry people and $7.25 is honestly fair and how much you usually purchase appetizers at restaurants so it's not a big deal for me.\n\n[THE SERVICE] 4.5/5\nAlthough this wasn't a sit in restaurant, I was pretty impressed with the service. They came to pick up our empty baskets from our table when we were still sitting at them and were really helpful and accommodating for me when I needed a box. \n\n[MISCELANEOUS COMMENTS/TIPS]\nI like that their self-serve water is it's own dispenser, offered in sparkling or still water. Water glasses are glass rather than plastic, and there is a wide variety of drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic that makes this place a great place to have a few draught beers or juices, making it a nice middle ground for family friendly/casual dinner for pre-gaming a late night out. \n\nOverall, I was quite satisfied. I'm not a huge Mexican food kind of person, but if I'm ever in the area and craving some guacamole I'll definitely remember this place!", "author": "Cara O."}

Credit where it's due, that doesn't seem to happen much anymore, but now there are more creative issues. This Saturday I splurged and ordered a side of (overpriced) guacamole to go with the handful of chips that accompany the burritos. What do I discover when I finally get back and open the bag? Guac, but no chips. It's like a cruel form of torture. I went back and discovered that their fryer was broken so they didn't have enough chips to go around. They said that they'd have to charge me for chips (which was not explained while I was at the register, of course).

But what they don't tell you is that this is only if you're eating at the restaurant, not takeout. I go up to the register and say that I'd like to get the tacos for Taco Tuesday. The owner rings me up. It comes to more than the number of tacos I ordered x $2 + tax. I ask why. He says I have to eat inside the restaurant in order for the tacos to be $2. Wouldn't you tell me this as I'm ordering? I told him that's not what is advertised and no where is there a sign that explains this. He said, \"If I had a sign for everything I wanted to say, there'd be signs all over this place.\" Hence, the side of attitude I mentioned.  I was too tired to argue so I just decided to move on with my evening and not to go to this place again. \n\nSo I'm waiting for my tacos.

I loved that the chicken was actually flavored, unlike many of the taco joints that just give you plain, shredded chicken. One taco is definitely a generous portion, so it filled me up for lunch -- keep that in mind when you order. The tacos are wrapped tightly and neatly, so despite been loaded with ingredients, they never fall apart!\n\nI loved the New England vibe! What a great place to hang out, grab a bite, and socialize.

I came here for Taco Tuesday and got their street style tacos, which includes one of each of the carne asada, carnitas and pollo topped with cilantro and onions. Pollo and carnitas were seasoned nicely. The steak was a little chewy but still tasted great. I will definitely be coming back and trying other things on the menu.

Compared to other places in the bay area, it doesn't live up to the rating.  It's definitely a more white washed version of Mexican food but that's pretty typical of the entire area.  The price is a little higher than most Mexican food but it's on par considering it's located in the Cow Hollow district.  \n\nI work in the area and frequent Tacko almost every week.  I usually get the San Francisco burrito with carne asada.  The salsa in the burrito isn't that great and sometimes the carne asada can be burnt.  Overall, they are pretty consistent.  Their red salsa is really good but I'm not a big fan of the green salsa.  \n\nThe one problem I have is with their stinginess with the salsa.  I order for a few people so we typically order 3 burritos.  I normally tell them no green salsa and only red salsa.  They usually give you one of each but if you only ask for red, they will only give you one red salsa per burrito.  It's a small container with barely enough salsa for the chips.  With an average salsa on the burrito, they could at least give me another red salsa!  I've even asked for more salsa and got one additional pack.  I had to ask the cashier twice and it was almost like I was asking for some huge favor.  I try to always place my order online and it works great.  I wish there was a note section so I could write \"MORE RED SALSA PLEASE!\"\n\nWhen you eat in, they have huge bottles of salsa at the tables.

My childhood was chicken and cheese burritos, so I know what's up. Not only do they stuff the burritos full of what they should-delicious, fresh ingredients (tons of guacamole, juicy chicken, tender steak, tender beans, rice, I could go on...)-but they expertly fold them AND grill them once they're folded. This adds a delicious, crispy exterior to the burrito unlike anything around.\n\nTheir quesadillas are basically the same exact thing as the ones over at Nick's Crispy Tacos, which makes sense because the ex-owner of Nick's (yes, Nick) is the owner of Tacko. Whatever he does for mexican food, he needs to work that magic at every other restaurant in the world. Seriously, he does it right. \n\nFriendly, helpful, hard-working staff. Although I've occasionally waited 30+ minutes for orders (both as a sit-down and for take-out), the wait always seems to be worth it. Never have I ever regretted waiting for their burritos, tacos, or quesadillas. This place is relatively new (maybe about a year) and I don't know how I survived before without it. Tacko makes my world go 'round.\n\n\nPS San Francisco-style burritos are where it's at. Get everything in your order Nick's Way, you won't regret it.

I was very disappointed first since I REALLY wanted a burrito. The guy was super nice, super friendly and ended up putting together a special burrito for me.

Just tasted like stringy meat.\n1 Pollo (chicken) taco - which, although white meat, was also dry and underseasoned.\n1 Carne Asada taco - this was the best one, hands down! The meat was flavorful and best of all, tender.\n\nAll the tacos came in two small corn tortillas that was a bit too dough-y tasting. Each taco had a sprinkle of onions and cilantro. Because the meat didn't have any sauce or flavor, eating them as is was just plain awful due to its dryness. \n\nThere are two bottles of sauce on the side - a green one that's like salsa verde that was light and refreshing, and a red one that, I'm guessing, is some kind of habanero one. But for the love of God, stay away from the red one! It tastes burnt, and is just utterly disgusting. \n\nI also got a pitcher of their white sangria, and opted to get it in their big pail! I liked the idea - it's super cute - but the drink itself was disappointing. First off, they filled the pail up with lots and lots of ice, not leaving much room for the alchy. No bueno. Second, the sangria had nooo flavor at all. I could barely taste any wine at all. I thought I was just drinking watered down...soda at best. And worst off? ALL THAT FOR $17.50. \n\nSo if you're coming here hoping to get some bomb tacos, you won't. I highly recommend El Farolito in the Mission instead! But if you must come here...just remember:\n1.

First, a heads-up about what you're getting into: This is a counter-focused, sit-down-with-a-number-and-we'll-bring-it-to-you kinda place, so don't expect tableside service and baskets of free chips n' salsa and you'll do fine.\n\nThis brings me to my next point: Order. The. Tortilla chips. These things are thick, crunchy, and delicious, able to withstand the soggifying effects of salsa and guacamole alike with impunity. They are the Omega Chip, the tortilla fragments to which all other chips aspire. Seriously, they're good. Get them with guac or salsa or whatever, but GET THEM.\n\nDinner here was great, too. I had an enormous San Francisco burrito stuffed full of beans, rice, guac, and more, then delightfully crisped on the grill. My wife had a quesadilla jam-packed with carnitas and other fillings, to the point where it was more like a semi-flat chimichanga.\n\nFinally, we had a 'Margaritaish,' which, as far as we could tell, is a really freaking strong Margarita with crushed ice. It was delicious, and for $6, you totally get your money's worth. Besides the great food, Tacko is fast, clean, and staffed by friendly people. \n\nWhat's not to like?", "author": "Matthew L."}

Couple that with the fact that once you eat your taco and walk out the door, you realize your meal was only worth half of what you paid and, within a few hours, you may need some regular maintenance.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, I think it's great that I can pay over $8 for a burrito that is the size of a twinkie or that three \"street-style\" tacos taste as if they actually made contact with Fillmore St.  The meat was dry and flavorless.  Tortilla was overcooked and chewy.  The accompanying salsa was watered down and tasted of bath water.  Perhaps adding taste was an additional $2 option.  Lastly, the drink selection, other than beer, leaves much to be desired...worst impersonation of \"sangria\" I may have ever had.    \n\nBut, hey, it's in the Marina (Cow Hollow) and it's got the current hip factor...too bad the Taco Bell a block away may be a better option.", "author": "Eric H."}

I like to think I know my way around a taco. I have seen the glory of Roberto's. I bore witness to the miracle that is King Taco. I know what a baja style taco is supposed to be.\n\nI guess I shouldn't be so down on them because Tacko does not even purport to be at all Mexican. Somehow they have decided that the world needs a New England style taco, as evidenced by the mural of Nantucket Island on the wall. Apparently what this means is that you get a taco that is aimed at the jet-setting yacht race crowd, which is to say bland, tasteless, one meat indistinguishable from the last.\n\nIs this chicken poached? Why was the carne asada chopped up before it was overcooked? Don't they know you cook the meat in larger flat pieces, *then* chop it up so it's not like eating giant sand grains?\n\nI've never had a trio of tacos so overwhelmingly mediocre. I was there at lunchtime on a Friday. I should have known better when I walked in and most of the crowd consisted of 30-something, white moms with their off-road baby carriages. That is the palate Tacko is aiming for, and they hit that nail right on the head. The red sauce on the table tasted more like the green. Very mild. Very unassuming. Safely unoffensive.\n\nTacolicious is by no means authentico, and their menu is also very, very white. But at least their tacos have taste. At least there is some heat. Their chicken is like crack. In a town with so much good, authentic Mexican food as well as pretty decent gavacho food aimed at hipsters, Tacko misses the mark by a fathom.\n\nUPDATE: BTW, cash only? Really? I can understand/expect that at a dumpy BBQ joint or food cart, but if you're attempting to be a high-class, east coast, yacht-club taco joint, you better accept the gold card. I can use a debit card to buy ice cream from a shipping crate on Octavia, I better be able to buy some high-class tacos with it.", "author": "Matt J."}

They get points for having a tasty lobster roll, but lose them for having lobster on the menu, yet being cash-only.  Leave the slummin' it theme to the places that have earned the right, not your Nantucket-cum-tacKo truck-Marina restaurant. The boats on the wall coupled with fried tacos just don't add up.  Maybe a small sign to explain? I don't even know why I care, but I am not alone in the wondering.\n\nI do not understand the line out the door, either, and then there is The Manager. I assume he is the manager because he stands at the register and greets who he wants while barking at the ONE girl running around trying to service everyone waiting at a table.  We also witnessed him being Nazi-stern to the kitchen staff who was busting ass to serve up 800 tacos to demanding Marina-ites in fancy sweats.  To be fair, I will update this if I go back and things are more pleasant.\n\nNote to you Mr. Manager:  We can hear it when you are rude to your staff and its not cool, its not winning you Yelp points, and it certainly makes your food seem less interesting.  I can go around the corner to Tacolicious and have a platter of taco-truck fun and use my checkcard.  \n\nAlso, a lesson in etiquette- if you are handing out drinks to a few customers because they look like they are tired of standing in line, it is extremely wrong to be select.  You asked the group in front of me, and then a guy behind me if they wanted a beer.  I had to question whether the outfit I had on was unnacceptable for this club-like mentality.  If you want to win loyalty you should be sincere and ask everyone who waited in that unnecessary line (then found they had to get cash from a telly) if they want a drink.  Duh.  I did not want your horchada, but it would have been nice to have been offered the nasty stuff and leave without questioning my looks.\n\nMy last question and comment is about the California burrito.  Why is it this particular burrito that gets the french fries? I am not complaining, it was mostly good but it could have used some beans to even it out.  Just like the theme here is confusing, I am curious as to why the California version is the one with fries inside.  Avacados or something may have been more appropriate- leaving credit for the \"fries inside\" to the Philly fans. \n\nTacKo is so-so.  They seem confused, much like the name.

Yay.\n\nLast night, after realizing my lovely Tacolicious was closed for a private party (shout out to T-lish woo!), we decided to try Tacko for the first time...and the rumors are true...Nick is a huge dbag. Food was alright, line was super long, and we sat at the center communal table where the barstools are very high and there are no footrests. After two buckets of beers, we were all in pain awkwardly dangling our feet off the extremely uncomfortable stools. \n\nSo when we are finishing up Nick comes up and asks: \"How is everything?\"\nMe: Good...why no footrests??\nNick: Looks like you are finishing up your food and drink...are you about to leave?\nMe: Why yes we are...if i can stand up that is, since i cannot feel my legs.\nNick: Would you be leaving if there were footrests?\nMe: Well no, we'd probably stay and order more food and drinks from your restaurant, Nick. \nNick: This is an in and out kind of place, we don't want you lounging around, if you dont like it you dont have to come here. \n\nSo for one I have never heard of inflicting pain and discomfort on your customers for a quicker turnover, but let's say the one star I give you goes to your creative business strategy there. However, let me point out to you, Nick, this is the marina, where we specialize in \"lounging\". You cannot place your business several steps from the triangle and expect people to rush in and out like its lunch hour in the financial. If you don't want people to stick around...don't serve alcohol! Especially don't serve alcohol in fun group sized neon buckets!!

We love the food and convenient location to our house. \n\nWe have also ordered catering portions for events from Tacko (as recently as three weeks ago). Suffice it to say, I feel we are good customers.\n\nThis evening we ordered by phone for pick up. We were told 15 mins. We went to pick up but the food was not ready. Not an issue. Stuff happens. However the verbal ATTITUDE we received when we commented that this was the second time in a week that our order was delayed (and completely wrong to add), was way off base. The knob jockey behind the counter was SO dismissive and rude (and did I mention walked away in mid sentence) that we decided to end our relationship with Tacko. There are too many great places in the hood with better customer service to spend your money in. I left my phone number and name for the manager to call so I could give him some candid feedback, but so far radio silence. This is a restaurant that has apparently decided since they get so much foot traffic that be damned with customer service. As any mid to long term resident in Cow Hollow will attest......they eventually flame out of business as soon as their customer service starts to slide. \n\nSuch a shame, because the food is decent.

The burrito itself actually impressed me.  I like that it is thrown on the grill once rolled to give it a charred taste.  The ingredients were well porportioned and no single ingredient overpowered the rest (in my book, the key to a successful burrito).  Its not the type of burrito you would get at a hole in the wall taqueria, but i wasnt expecting it to be, given the wierd cape cod decor.\n\nIn summary, I am happy to have found a place close to home to get a solid burrito.

We sat for about 2 hours, although the seating isn't abundant.    \nI had a taste for my friend's tortilla soup and although she thought it was on the bland side, I appreciated it - chunks of avocado, lots of tortilla strips.", "author": "Meredith K."}

Already pretty full from all the beer but deprived of food, Tacko was easily a great option since Pizza Orgasmica had its usual line out the door.  My friends and I found a table by the window inside Tacko; as it turns out we were lucky since we left the bar before it completely let out.  Anyway, I'm usually really picky when it comes to burritos, and I usually am that annoying person who starts off their order with \"no this, no this, just a little bit of this, and extra this\".  So, imagine my shock when I saw Tacko's menu board that shows the various ways you can include or exclude things in your burrito!  I ordered the San Diego burrito with carne asada, which comes with just cheese, pico de gallo, and guacamole.  And that's it.  And I ate all of it.  Normally I like shrimp tacos, but at $4.50, I saw more value in the San Diego burrito.  I will most definitely be back if I'm in the area, I certainly liked this more than Taco Bell down the street.", "author": "Lisa I."}

They are sooo close to having the first really good California burrito in San Francisco (carne asada burrito with french fries).

It really isn't a great Nantucket-style restaurant to start. The lobster roll, while buttery, was teeny tiny and only had claw meat. For nearly 20 bucks, that's ridiculous.  And it was hot. Lobster rolls are suppose to be cold, on a hot buttery toasted bun. That's important. And they got this all wrong.  I didn't even finish it.\n\nThe Mexican side of things were pretty tasty, but certainly not going to win in any head-to-head comparisons to a \"real\" taqueria anywhere nearby.

I've just started appreciating this kind of fare, unlike my fiancee who could judge a burrito contest. I know that El Farolito is bomb diggity and I know that the quesadilla at Whole Foods is crap, but I cannot really tell the difference most of the time between a quality taco and an \"eh\" taco. Except for the Tacko taco. This was gross. The cheese may as well have been a string cheese put in the microwave for 30 seconds and the taco shell was soaked with oil. Blech.\n\nNow, this was enough to make me long for Tacolicious, which Nick told my fiancee was \"not in competition, because he's trying to do something different.\" By different, I wonder if he means, \"not edible\" because the line at Tacolicious was out the door and Tacko was empty. But I digress. When I bit into my soggy pollo taco, I felt something hard against my tooth, and lo and behold, it was a bone. A BONE! When I walked up to the waitress to tell her that I hurt my tooth on said bone her response was, \"Oh....I'll tell someone.....\" Hmm...We sat there for a few more minutes and no one came out to apologize. No one thought to offer our money back, provide us with a boneless chicken taco, or make sure that I still had a tooth. Nothing. Either the waitress got confused walking to the kitchen and chewing gum at the same time or they just have awful customer service. I was so peeved that I decided to call the restaurant and speak to Nick himself. Now, I'm not in the restaurant business, but any intelligent person would think that in this economy and given that Tacko is in competition with a number of Mexican joints within walking distance, that once the manager and owner heard about what had just transpired that he'd want return business and offer some type of compensation. NOPE! When we spoke he was completely apathetic. \n\nSo, all in all, if you want a lackluster taco with a side of toothache, go to Tacko. If not, head to Tacolicious. Oh, and by the way Nick, my tooth still hurts, so if I end up heading to the dentist, you better pray that your business picked up today.", "author": "Lindsay W."}

My girlfriend raves about Taco Tuesdays here and this restaurant actually offers a California burrito (fries inside instead of traditional rice).  I ordered the Carne asada California burrito ($9.75) and she ordered 3 carne asada street tacos ($7.50).  I have not had a California burrito in almost three years and was anxiously awaiting to be taken down memory lane.  Unfortunately, the California burrito was underwhelming and tasted more like fries than anything because there was barely any carne asada present in my burrito.  I was truly disappointed and the fries weren't even good.  My girlfriend's tacos however were above average and I could definitely taste the quality of meat and the meat was seasoned to perfection.  I guess in the Marina district there aren't many eateries available but I wouldn't come here again.", "author": "Christopher C."}

A quesadilla is meant to be thin and crispy not soggy and full like a burrito.

Seriously, you're perched on this stool with your feet dangling like a 4-year-old.  Unless you're 7 feet tall, you won't be able to rest your feet on the floor while sitting on the stool.  It makes you feel completely ridiculous and physically uncomfortable - not something I'd think a restaurant owner would be going for unless he's trying to encourage customers to order take-out (in which case he's wasting money on a lot of useless square footage and a liquor license).  \n\nFortunately, there are some tables with picnic-style benches, and I moved over to a table by the wall, where I was much more comfortable.  The decor is interesting and attractive.  I loved the framed 40's \"Yachting\" magazines on the walls.  \n\nI ordered the fish taco Nick's way, and it was tasty. \n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try, but be sure to grab a picnic table if you want to eat in - especially if you're drinking!", "author": "hotdiggity d."}

The first couple of times the food was great and the service was great.   I took the time to tell friends about it and thought it was a great addition to the neighborhood.\n\nHowever, I'm giving this 1 star review based on my last three visits.  The quantity and quality was not the same and certainly not up to par.   They have gone down significantly.   I gave it two more chances after a very bad shrimp burrito.   Things got worse....\n\nThe worst part is the service.   I have never heard an owner that is so rude to it's customers AND employees.    I witnessed the owner (Nick) scream at his staff and fire someone while I was in the bathroom. Another time I asked him if I could order something on the side, and he replied with no and that if I don't like it I can go somewhere else.    No such reason what so ever for a response like that.   In a city where there are plenty of great food choices, I refuse to go to a place where an owner doesn't appreciate it's customers.     \n\nSo so so disappointing.

They have a great menu and as many hot sauces and salsas as you could possibly want. I'll normally go with a Mahi Mahi baja burrito or the one with french fries and steak, depending on how I am feeling that particular visit. The burritos are not as big as a place like Chipotle, but they are tastier in my opinion. I'm not thrilled about dropping ten bucks for a burrito every time I come in, but such is life in the Marina. The wait times can get long but I don't feel that it presents an issue.

I also had the mahi taco and it had a very generous portion of well prepared mahi.  The have a nice India pale ale on tap hurrah!  The place can become a bit of a scene evenings which I think is fun, provided that you are in the mood.  I did not try any spicy Mexican dishes because that is not my taste.", "author": "Art A."}

I recommend the carne asada and carnitas tacos. I'm still trying to figure out the pollo (chicken) taco. There is a thick gravy like sauce that does nothing other than gross me out and confuse me on what I'm eating. But all in all, ok for American- Mexican tacos.", "author": "Honest Y."}

We were inspired by good reviews, and overall it was a satisfactory experience. I had the street-style tacos. All three were on the greasy side (sizable pool of oil in the basket afterwards) and the chicken taco was kind of bland. On the up side, the staff was nice and efficient, and the place was clean. I do find the Nantucket/Taco mix a little confusing, though. (I read the history on the wall - still feels like a confused dining setting.) I might go back if I were looking for lunch in the area.", "author": "Lala K."}

I ordered a Carne asada quesadilla with suiza and chips & salsa. The quesadilla was generously-sized and delicious. The chips were a bit thick for my liking and the salsa could be better described as a mild pico de gallo. My friends had tacos and burritos and enjoyed their food as well.", "author": "Preston D."}

What I liked: the food was clean, and had familiar flavors. What I didn't like: they aren't very creative and don't allow substitutions. Also, they are cash only (at least for now). But the service was good - everyone was really smiley and helpful, so perhaps they've been reading the early reviews here and took it to heart?!", "author": "Carrie L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-29", "description": "If i had written this review the week that Tacko opened, it would most likely be one start lower since they were still working their kinks out. I decided to wait and give it another try since a lot of restaurants deal with these types of problems.\n\nInitially, I was pretty upset with the closing of Kasa since i live half a block away from the spot. When Tacko opened, we were pretty stoked. Everyone raves about the tacos, and don't get me wrong they are amazing, but i LOVE the quesadillas. I've had the carne asada one and the plain poco queso. Both times I had it done suiza style (on the side since i only like dipping it in the guac). They are a must try.\n\nLast week we went in on a Friday night. Unfortunately the line was still moving slower than i would prefer, but much faster than when they first opened. I think they need one extra person back there to bag the chips ect. While we were in line, Nick the owner started chatting with us(4 girls) and gave us a margarita pail, as well as a modelo for the one guy with us. He also then came and checked on our table while we were eating. The amazing food and service made up for a extra minutes we waited in line to order.\n\nIf you are in the area, be sure to pop in. Tacko will definitely become a staple for my friends and I here in the neighborhood.", "author": "Mona A."}

Walked up to the counter and a staff member walks up (he was in the dining room, not behind the counter) and asks if I am eating here or to go (I said here).  He tells me not to order a burrito (which I was going to order).  I ask if the burrito is bad, he says no but would only order if I was getting it to go.  I stated I wanted a burrito after which he said \"well you can order what you want but the name of the place is Tacko so I would THINK you would want to order a taco\".  After another minute of waiting for someone to take my order I left (which I was planning to do anyway).

The first time we tried, the place was closed randomly.  The second time, we tried to go on a Monday night.  I guess we missed the memo that they are closed on Mondays!  DUH!  Anyways...we loved it!  Everything from the food to the decor to the atmosphere.  Even though it's a mexican restaurant, it is decorated in a Nantucket nautical theme which is kind of interesting, but needless to say I can't resist either...nautical stuff or mexican food.  I ordered the Carne Asada Quesadillas and my, oh, my...they were DELISH!!  The way the cooks prepare the tortilla makes it flaky almost like Phyllo dough.  Daniel ordered the California Burrito which has french fries rolled inside.  He felt it was pretty good and the french fries made an interesting combo.  He did like their HUGE variety of hot sauces.  Made for interesting decor...We will definitely eat here again...just not on Mondays! :)", "author": "Tara P."}

The prices are reasonable. The decor is silly, but whatever; it has no bearing on the food. Chairs with real backs would be appreciated, rather than the picnic tables. I usually go very early in the evening, when there's no line whatsoever, and the kitchen is still slow. The music is way too loud when the place is empty.

My first impression wasn't that bad. The restaurant it's self is adorable and they have a pretty large menu however there is no way I'm going back after my last visit on Sunday night. I called in an order for pick up and when I arrived they had messed it up. I asked the girl working the counter (who had also taken the phone order) to have the order corrected. She then rolled her eyes told me it was already made and actually told me they weren't going to fix it. I was a little baffled but insisted as I had already paid for it. She then went back into the kitchen and said something rude to the cooks who seemed to have less of a problem fixing her mistake then she did. It was so uncomfortable that I ended up apologizing for 'being a pain' only to have her look at me and walk away. She acted so unprofessionally that I was almost embarrassed for her. I'm not going back because of my experience. She seemed pretty comfortable with her attitude which gave me the impression that this is an establishment where management sides with that kind of behavior in their staff. I'd rather spend my money elsewhere.", "author": "Emily A."}
