If you go on less busy days, you'll be able to find parking in its tiny little lot. From there, you can enjoy the concrete theatre right next to the parking lot or go for a short walk and enjoy what the rest of the park has to offer.\n\nMy personal favorite spot is... well maybe I shouldn't reveal my favorite location, but I enjoy reading a book there. Regardless, you can spend an hour here or meditate for 4 hours if you so desire. So while Sigmund Stern Grove can get ridiculously busy on event and free concert days, it can also get ridiculously serene and empty any other day. There's something for everyone here whether you want to attend an organized event or just find some peace and quiet.", "author": "Derek T."}

But unfortunately the tape on my glasses was flexing too much due to the above average fog and I had no choice but to turn back.  After twisting my ankle last week I have really had a tough time.   (I am considering doubling my Vitamin D regimen but you can't trust the dosage information printed on the labels so I don't know which brand to buy.)  Thanks for nothing FDA.  FYI Sucks.\n\nAnyway, when I was almost home I had a change of heart and headed to Sigmund Stern Grove.  I've got a pretty sweet glider FYI, so I figured I'd go for it.  So glad to have that park nearby.  As soon as I stepped into the park, for some strange reason I started crying. I was all, \n\"Sigmund, THANK YOU! SO MUCH!!\"  I don't know what happened FYI.   I digress, but few people are aware of Sigmund's heroic action in saving this eucalyptus park which was not easy for him at all.  \n\nYou see, Sigmund lived down the block from me.  I remember, he was just out of college living with his parents in the Sunset after graduating from SF State.  He got a degree in something or didn't graduate.  Either way getting a job was super hard and rents around are so damn high.   So he moved back in.  I mean it's tough. \n\nBut Sigmund's an above average dude FYI and given sufficient time also industrious. To better his situation, and after really thinking it over for a couple months like in that movie \"I Graduated\" by Dustin Hoffman,  Sigmund decided to become a YouTube artist.   That was a good move, I think.  He's so talented.  He could do so many things I'm sure.   For example, he could strap a camera to his chest and ride around the neighborhood on a bike and say if a hill is hard to climb or if he is tired today or another possibility would be a channel exploring personal appliances like taking apart a toaster oven.  For sure, ad dollars would start rolling in from all his new fans  \n\nBy the way, most people don't know this but Sigmund can do 15 pull ups.  Just FYI.\n\nAnyway, one time after spending most of morning planning out his YouTube channel Sigmund got bored and decided to head out to the park to unwind and think clearly and what not.  And then without any advance notice at all, near the benches in the middle of the park, a coyote walks over to near the garbage cans.  It was just like in that Westworld prequel with Kevin Costner \"How to dance with a Wolf\" where this glitching host heads out to the Land Beyond and finds this kind of unfortunate looking dog who is pretty hairy and has a big nose.  \n\nSo then, Sigmund summons the courage of Akecheta the ghost tribe dude with the blood hand imprint on his neck from Westworld, and yells at the coyote to \"get out of here\".   To this day, most likely, Sigmund checks to see if there are any coyotes lurking about and is ready to act again if need be.  On top of all that, he also used his mom's laser printer and google translate to put up a sign to warn people of the danger in like three languages.  So in thanks for keeping the park safe, it was probably named after Sigmund.  FYI.  The end.", "author": "Asper K."}

The descent down the path through the eucalyptus trees made for a perfect setting for the Halloween party. Scare Grove is definitely the best kids Halloween party in the city. The wide expanse of the park and the stone seating around the amphitheater gave us ample room to relax, eat or just enjoy the show. In accordance with custom, the kids eagerly flaunted their costumes, breaking them in for a night of partying. We give our son as many opportunities as possible to spend time in his costume before All Hallows' eve.  To be sure that he's comfortable in it before the 3 hour dark trek through our neighborhood. \n\nThe craft  tables were terrific. My son made quick crafts while I held his place in line for the other activities. His fav. activies were definitely the \"make own magic wand,\" the face painting and the scamper through the hay maze to the toddler friendly haunted house. We especially loved the carnival rides. The ride staff were extremely friendly, definitely making it a more of a celebration than a mere event. A Juggler and Characters kept the tots occupied in the lines. Older kids weren't left out either. In the clubhouse, adjacent to Pine Lake, a creepy graveyard path through the trees led you into the haunted house. The live actors dressed as ghouls appearing in front of you and some lunatics stabbing body parts provided enough excitement for terror lovers. I do regret not getting zombie face paint. I was indecisive, as I am partial to being a vampire.  \n\nThe food truck choices were also diverse and didn't break your wallet. The heat lamps in the dining section were a bonus.  Luckily, the night was warm and we were well sheltered from the wind by the trees. Thanks for another great year SF Rec & Park!", "author": "Evelyn K."}

There was actually a wedding party taking photos when I was there this last weekend and it seems they were setting up for their ceremony in the redwood grove up past the parking lot. It was all very serene and felt miles away from the hustle and bustle of 19th and Sloat.\n\nIf you walk through the grove and concert area, you will reach Pine Lake Park which in and of itself also a lot of fun, with an offleash dog area and lake with tons of birds to look at (separate review on that to come.)\n\nOverall, just another gem in SF and a reason for me to wish I lived in the city so I can take advantage of all these various wonders any day of the week!", "author": "Jennifer N."}

The dog run is incredible.  It's essentially two football fields--connected lengthwise--nestled in a valley surrounded by mature eucalyptus trees, which allows even those of us with dogs with less than perfect recall to play off leash without excessive paranoia.  My dog loves the ability to run on long stretches of grass, chase and play with the many well-behaved dogs that come on the weekends, and barnstorm through the woods surrounding the main field.  Most days, you'll find enough dogs and friendly dog lovers to make it social for you and your pup(s), without the park being overrun.  The park is also very family oriented, with people of all generations enjoying romps, and very few dog walkers.  The one concern I would note is the increasing number of sightings of and encounters with coyotes, so you may want to avoid going too close to dusk or dawn, when coyotes are more active, particularly if you have small dogs.

The first parking lot, which is located just outside the Trocadero Club house and ceremony area, only accommodates about 10 cars. The second parking lot, on the other hand, provides ample parking for your guests. Guests parking in this lot will be required to take a 5 minutes walk through the concert meadow to get to the ceremony area and clubhouse, which they will either find quite pleasant or an inconvenient chore.\n\nPROS:\n-Despite it being right on busy 19th avenue, Stern Grove is free of ALL traffic noise. It is so quite and peaceful down there.\n-It's VERY affordable.\n-The Trocadero Clubhouse is absolutely charming and is big enough for a max of 180 guests. It is better suited for a smaller party though. ---\n-The front patio is perfect for cocktail hour and general mingling.\n-The ceremony area just outside the clubhouse is lined with gorgeous Redwood trees and provides a natural, cathedral-like space for a wedding ceremony.\n-The rental of the clubhouse includes access to their huge kitchen, complete with operating stoves and sinks.\n-The rental also includes the use of their saloon-like bar. My husband loved the bar because it was, as he put it, \"old school.\"\n\n\nPlease note that since Stern Grove is a public park you have to remember that you can't expect the full service you would find at other wedding venues. Set-up and clean-up are the responsibility of the renters.\n\nBest time for a wedding her would probably be during Indian Summer... from September-November.", "author": "Ella M C."}

Walking down from the corner of 19th Ave. and Sloat, among the eucalyptus trees and nasturtium, you can't help but feel the magic of this place.  \n\nAt the bottom of the drive is the Redwood Grove.  It is dark and shady, quiet and cathedral-like.  For this reason, it has been the site of many wedding ceremonies and remains a quiet place to read or take a break from the sun.\n\nNext to the Redwood Grove is the Trocadero Clubhouse.  It used to be a hotel for the elite of San Francisco, but this use ended with Prohibition.  The Victorian structure remains in pretty good condition, and can be rented for private events, and houses the pre-concert talks for the summer concert series.  My old company held a Christmas party here and we had a grand time shaking the dance floor in the quiet of the grove.  There is a very decent bathroom right next to the clubhouse with lots of stalls for women (yay).\n\nThe grove itself is best known for the Summer Concerts, which is one of the best activities to do in San Francisco.  It is said that Mrs. Stern went around with an opera singer test various spots in the park to determine the best acoustics before setting up the location of the stage. The re-vamp by landscape architect Lawrence Halperin was a welcome change.  Additionally, \"talking posts\" for the sight-impaired have been added, as well as more paths to keep people off of the lawn as much as possible.  Right behind the stage is the largest tree in San Francisco, a towering eucalyptus with a huge trunk.  Hopefully, none of those branches will come down any time soon.  I have heard that if you spend the entire day in the park, you will leave smelling of eucalyptus.  Yum! \n\nThe hillside, which tends to erode from people sitting on it, has been cleared of many trees which were then used to create natural benches, and that are reinforced by deep stakes to keep them from moving.\n\nThe West Meadow is a sunny spot to hang out on a blanket on a clear day.  Please do not use plastic tarps, as these kill the grass and leave ugly brown spots - yuck!  Drinking fountains for humans and pets can be found here and by the Trocadero parking lot.\n\nAbove the seats in the concert grove, there are paths that allow you to wind around the trees and are perfect for dog-walking in a wooded environment.\n\nAcross the main parking lot is Pine Lake Park, which is currently being renovated to include a dog run and new, beautiful grass for our four-legged friends.  This part of the park can be also be entered at Crestlake and Vale.\n\nThe park is rarely crowded and people are responsible for picking up after their dogs.  For some reason, this park does not seem to attract the homeless or lurkers.\n\nA wonderful place to escape the wind and city stresses.  Go when you need to get your Thoreau on.", "author": "Liz S."}

Wooded groves are awesome and San Francisco should have more of them, especially ones like this where dogs can frolic off leash. I'm always amazed at how much better I feel when I'm in the proximity of greenery.\n\nThis park is fairly small, but good enough for a long walk with your 4 pawed pal. There are also a couple of open fields for frisbee tossing and tennis ball throwing. About half the park is currently fenced off for refurbishment (hence only 4 stars). \n\nWhile you can't totally lose yourself in nature as in farther away parks like Mt. Tam, Stern Grove is still a doggie friendly gem closer to home.", "author": "Jeremy S."}

Armed with the nourishment and several large blankets, we surveyed the diminishing patch of greenery and found a spot to stake our claim.\n\nThe music was not bad, although I felt it geared a bit more towards hippy folk music.  Our neighbors were cordial and I loved how everyone would mingle and dance together.  \n\nI'd come back here any day of the weekend to lounge around and listen to great music and spend time with wonderful friends.", "author": "Miika M."}

Yes, it was a Friday, but man was it a perfect night.\nIf you are thinking about having a wedding at Sigmund Stern Grove, here are some things to keep in mind.\n1) Book ahead of time for summer/fall weddings...but don't limit yourself to weekend ceremonies.  Reserve the ceremony site as well as the banquet hall.  It's a great bargain.  We decided to hold the wedding on a Friday because it was open (at night), and it was a great way to kick off a weekend!  \n2) The weather inside this forest was very calm and mild.  All week long, the fog rolled into the city.  We were afraid it would get into the Grove.  We were prepared with firewood for the fireplace...but didn't even need it.\n3) Rent extra chairs for the ceremony.  It's worth the trouble and $$ here because even though they provide chairs, the backs of them are marked \"Stern Grove\"...not so great for photo opt. \n4) Hire security from the company Parks & Recs suggest.  No need to go outside here.  At no point did we feel a need for security to push uninvited ppl away.  It was Friday...Also hire them from about 7:30-closing time.  Save you some money.\n5) Come prepared with extra decorations...they not only add color, but it gives the entire place a great feel.  (DIY the thing!)\n6) Look into alternatives for catering...we did Pizza Politana and it was a hit.  Not only did they serve great pizzas, but the addition of a kiln on site was awesome for ppl to see.\n7) No amplified sound for wedding ceremony except for wedding vows...but hire horns/violinists/acoustic instruments sound great here.\n8) Rent 15 inch speakers...Avista has some great deals.  Two speakers really knock it out the park :)\n\nOverall, I'd say that it was a great experience for everyone who came.  The site is over looked by many ppl (most don't even know where it is) and for the price, you can save $$ for a great vacation afterward.\n\nLogistically, if you are doing a night wedding, they don't allow you to jump into the site until 5pm.  We set things up in a little under 2 hours.  We ran a bit late for the start, but worth the wait.   Be mindful of this 5pm rule.  \n\nThat's it!  Enjoy your event!", "author": "felix c."}

Rec and Park practically abandoned the meadow around 2003, and while field conditions could never be described as optimal before then, due in no small part to a lack of a central irrigation system, the past few years saw Stern Grove decline into a dirt patch that alternated between a dust bowl or mud pit, depending on the weather.  Following the upgrade to the concert area, the meadow was closed in late 2006, torn up and cleared of excess Eucalyptus on the hillsides, Pine Lake dredged and cleared of plants that were clogging the lake, and a new central irrigation system installed.  In addition, an arbor now graces the central gathering area of the dog play area, and stonework, benches, and water fountains (with dog bowls -yay) are spread out over the park.  The result is a park that was already a great piece of open space for a quiet walk with or without a pooch is now a terrific park, with a beautiful green meadow, places to sit and relax, and refreshment for human and beast alike.\n\nNow about that bunny and moat:  At the west end of the park, just beside the camp building and Pine Lake, San Francisco's first Jackalope has appeared (see photos).  Perhaps a tribute to hash-house-harriers, or some other bit of symbolism that's over my head, this whimsical and slightly disturbing statue gives my dog the willies, causing him to walk around it in a wide semicircle.  The moat is a long and narrow pit that has been dug to separate the dog play area from the camp/picnic area (see photos), an attempt to end what has long been a sore spot for the camp, dog owners and dogs not reading the signs noting where the play area ends.  No word on whether trebuchets will be installed to hurl campers or dogs that stray beyond their boundaries back to their proper places.\n\nFor all the pro and anti dog sentiments in San Francisco, the renovation of Stern Grove Park should hopefully give everyone something to feel good about.", "author": "Hugh B."}

I was introduced to the \"dog run\" area of Stern Grove last weekend by a friend of mine who has been bringing her pup there regularly. It's a HUGE grassy area, about the size of a football field, where the dogs are chasing balls, frisbees, or simply sniffing each other! I have a little 6 pounder, so I was a little nervous about all the big dogs there, but I soon found out they stick to their own sized buddies or they're too busy playing fetch. All the little dogs seem to cluster around one another, so that was nice.\n\nMy little Napoleon was able to meet quite a few small dogs there and even ran around with me for a little bit. I also heard that there's a nice stroll around the lake that people can do. There's a parking lot you can pull right into, but if that's full, I would imagine that you have to park on Sloat and walk down to the dog run.\n\nGreat place for dogs!!!", "author": "Freckles H."}

I love, love, love the summer music series they have here. They have a little something for everyone. Reggae, classical, Latin I've even seen some really interesting Hawaiian musicians here. It's a great place to come with some friends and share a great bottle of wine, good food and some wonderful music. Some things to keep in mind...admission is free so come early to get a seat.

The park is large and beautiful, but not enclosed. In laymen terms Momo & no fence= me running around the park chasing them. One day I thought I would trust my beagle off leash to make new friends. Immediately after unleashing her, she darts off for the parking lot. I looked like a crazed Woman running after her. When I made it to the parking lot I spotted her jumping into this poor woman's car. I had to coax her to come out and then another random dog jumped into the same car. Apparently her car is very popular. So lesson learned only one of my beagles can be trusted to not run away. I do like this park a lot because the people are really friendly and there are always dogs there.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

We have not noticed much poop on the ground. In fact it seems pretty clean overall. There are benches to sit down while the doggie plays and a couple of stations of water fountains with some metal dog bowls lying around to use.

While not spacious enough to accomodate long runs, Stern Grove is just about perfect for tempos, hill repeats, and timed intervals.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes me most about this place is the sense of seclusion it facilitates.  It's remarkable that a park just off of SF's main North-South thoroughfare can feel so isolated.  Gorgeous trees tower overhead, creating a natural canopy and lowering the temperature by 5-10 degrees on any given day.  There are plenty of hilly trails to explore, most of which look both long-forgotten and rurally beautiful.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason, this park attracts quite a number of dog walkers, which may irritate some runners.  In my experience, however, the animals have always been well behaved.  I also wish this place were a little bigger.  But for a brief reprive from the madness of 19th Ave and some very fast-paced and inspired workouts, Stern Grove fits the bill admirably.", "author": "Karin H."}

The concert venue is beautiful and the whole park is great for dogs and general recreation.

We lost $430 since the deposit is non-refundable and there is no way I would consider having my wedding there after seeing the place in person.  The redwood grove where the ceremony is supposed to be held is really a mud-pit that never dries out, even in the summer.  The \"beautiful reflecting pond\" was dried up with a bunch of garbage at the bottom and a stench so powerful, I can still smell it in my car.  Last, but not least, the clubhouse is really the gardeners house (his room is upstairs with the dirty curtains hanging in the window).  The place is seriously run-down inside and out.  I thought it would be rustic, but dilapidated is the more appropriate term.  There were rat traps in every corner of every room, and did I mention the smell?  It's sad, because the rest of the park is so beautiful.  When you walk into the beautifully landscaped concert venue, with pretty green grass, the difference is like night and day.
