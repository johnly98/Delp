{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-18", "description": "El Beach Burrito? How about El B*tch Burrito. I would give this place ZERO STARS if possible. Between the restaurant layout, the food, and especially the service, this IS ABSOLUTELY the WORST dining experience I have ever had...\n\n1. Didn't know where to order or pay\nThe only indicator of where this restaurant's overhead menu is is Frowny McFrownster (FMcF) half waving at the confused would-be (but shouldn't-be) customers. (Is she saying 'hi' to me? Is she telling me to go away? Oh, she's telling me the menu is in the way back where she's standing!) Even then, the menu was shrouded behind cooking vents in the furthest corner of the restaurant, and had more pages than there were TV screens - a perfect example of where technology does more harm than good. (Wait... still can't find the menu. Oh! There it is! I think I want the burrito, no, the nachos, no the tacos, wait... what were my options again? I guess I'll wait for the slide show to start again...)\n\n2. Soggy flavorless food\nI ordered the nachos, because you can never mess up nachos, right?! WRONG. There were not enough (stale Costco) chips. There was but one layer of sad (not toasted) chips, struggling under the weight of the watery beans and chicken (and NO CHEESE). \nMy meal was so sadly flavorless, the food was crying, and the only thing to mop its tears were the thin layer of tortilla chips. \nI tried so hard to comfort my sad meal, my natural solution was to ask for more more chips! (Chips are usually free for dine-in Mexican places any how, right? Besides they're at the counter, with tongs, and bags, within arms reach of the customer). So I go inside for more chips and FMcF immediately snaps at me \"THEY'RE NOT FREE\". So I give my eye-rolling server the $1.10 for the small bag of chips, which contained just as many chips as my original $12 plate of sorrowful nachos did.\n\n3. Found hair in my food - correction: HAIRS\nMy boyfriend says I have a special talent for finding hairs in my food. I think he's a little embarrassed at how often I complain about it. Well... today was one of those days. Once I sat down with the new bag of chips, I dipped into my nachos and... pulled a hair out! It was buried quite deep, but was short and blonde. (FMcF had long black hair. Let's give FMcF the benefit of the doubt and not make this dining experience any worse.) So I picked out the hair and tossed the contaminated bite to the dog. When I finally mustered the strength for a second bite... I found a SECOND HAIR. A SECOND HAIR BURIED EVEN DEEPER THAN THE FIRST.  I presented my furry dish to FMcF, expressing my distaste.  She initially refused to believe me, insisting she didn't see it. Then she offered \"MAYBE IT WAS ON THE FORK\". I showed her the hair was buried, I insisted this was the second one I found in my dish, and get this, FMcF said \"YEAH I GET IT. YOU'RE TRYING TO COMPLAIN.. WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO... REMAKE IT?\" First of all, the hair was definitely embedded in the food. Second of all, why would hair growing on your forks be any better? Hair should not be floating around (or be buried) in the food you serve. \n\nIn the end, I was too upset to wait for them to remake my nachos, especially after being asked detailed questions about what I ordered (sorry, not sorry, but I was upset enough as it was and FMcF could have safely deduced my order by looking at my untouched plate). I walked away. My only regret is not asking for a refund first. Actually, my regret is not taking a hint from the lack of traffic and making the mistake of walking into El B*tch Burrito at all!\n\nIN CONCLUSION. Do not mistake this places's cleanliness for godliness. The fact this place LOOKS clean is because there's no mess to pick up! People aren't going here because they don't want  Mexican food by the beach. They aren't coming here because no one likes Mexican food that tastes more flavorless than the cafeteria lady's leftover surprise. But hey, at least the cafeteria lady wears a hairnet.", "author": "Arielle C."}

After a charge for chips and salsa were added to the total I reluctantly still tipped 3 bucks in the tip jar thinking well hey its not the workers who make the prices up so why should I sub the cost of the  chip money out of the workers tips that I'm donating, especially for something ALL Mexican places practically smother you in as a mini snack to eat before the awesome authentic taste that comes along with spices and meats such as Asada, Barbacoa, Tripas and so forth....SF Burrito Joints have to offer.   Trekking back through a 10block hike through the Sunset I finally get to chomping my eagerly awaited Asada Super Burrito.  5 bites in realize I haven't hit any meat. 6 bites in I started questioning the Burrito and if they accidentally gave me some hippi vegan burrito by mistake. No mistake as the manager Elvira explained to me... The owner enforces a strict one scoop policy on all super burritos. Enraged for not spending 30 dollars on some burritos Del Taco would give more meat attention Elvira really went above and beyond to make the matter right. She was a stellar employee who turned the situation around.  I went into the call back inquiry full well knowing that the poor workers are thinking they did something wrong but I was very impressed by Elvira diffusal of the situation.  Elvira kudos to you for keeping me as a well tipping and appreciative customer however to the Owner: Shame on you sir for being so Barato with the meat.  You run an upscale spot in a upper class area. People don't want to be nickel and dimed for free chips otherwise elsewhere but they sure as hell dont want to find out the misleading and seemingly cheatfull formula you enforce to squeeze a dollar more from each so called valued customer.  My advice for what it's worth: is give people what they pay for at the very least. And if you want to stand out- make sure that your customer takes note of how generous the portions are. Establish a Rapport with your clientele and then you establish repeat business and free marketing when they blab to their friends how amazing their fav burrito spot is.  You should lower your own pay and give your workers a raise for dealing with insightful shoppers who feel cheated, because apparently Elvira told us that unfortunately those kinds of complaints happen on the daily.   Elvira has convinced me to come again. I hope to enjoy my food their one day and save the extra hour from having to go back and make a case.  Good day sir and buena suerte.", "author": "Victor H."}

It was really bad on my most recent visit (today) and there was NO ONE there except me. \nThe wet burrito here is ok, however this place doesn't believe in serving dishes hot.. EVERYTIME I order something to-go its cold... so I eat in a couple of times and it is still cold! Warm at best, and the whole place is also freezing! On top of that you only get the most flimsy plastic eat-wear you almost just want to take it home since it is cold anyway. Taking it home also allows you to maybe add some of your own hot sauce since all their food comes out a little BLAND.\nThe price isn't worth it, $3.35 for a rice and bean burrito ONLY.. who the hell only orders that? I order it with some cheese and tomatoes (pico de gallo). I should of just made this at home because the cheese was just mixed white and yellow shredded cheese you buy at the store in a resealable bag. It also suspiciously tastes exactly the same as my finely shredded 2% mexican blend cheese by Lucerne. THEY CHARGE .65 for a little sprinkle and .70 for the pico de gallo.. my total came out to $5.11 almost $2 more than the places I go in the Castro and Mission etc. \nPaying, he asked if I had a $5 which I did not. He said just this time, there needs to be a $8 minimum... what a weird minimum! Put up a sign!

Lots of choices, especially if you don't eat very many meat products. I am mainly vegetarian but occasionally eat fish, and this place has OPTIONS!:  a veggie burrito, a grilled vegetables burrito, a beans and rice burrito, a tofu burrito, a fish burrito, a prawn burrito, and my favorite, the chile relleno burrito.\n\n2. Decent size and not horribly expensive. Yes, you pay $1.50 more for a 'super' burrito, but even the regular burritos are large. Plus they give you a decent amount of chips and you can take as much salsa as you'd like from their salsa bar.\n\n3. Friendly staff. The two guys who run the cash register have always been super nice and happy.

Sometimes the chips here are good and fresh, sometimes they seem (like some other taquerias) as if they came out of a stale Costco bag. I think they may even charge extra for chips now? Which would be worth it if the chips were actually good.  The burritos are hit or miss, have had a decent chicken burrito here but all the ones I've had are lacking a bit of flavor. Get the chicken verde or another meat with sauce if you can-- the grilled meats are ok but just underflavored. (Always find myself adding some of their free salsas to the burritos when I bring them home.)  Basically this place will do in a pinch if you live in the neighborhood, but don't expect something close to the best of the Mission. If you're really seriously jonesing for a high quality burrito or tacos, you can do better.

A couple of big \"buts\" (which I like, and I cannot lie)...\n\nI asked for no guacamole (I know this takes some of you aback. Get off my back you judgmental avocado snobs), and I got home to find a rather large dollop of it smeared strategically mid-burrito. There are like five ingredients in a burrito and I saw them write down \"no guac\" when I said it. I was literally the only person in line at the time, busyness was a non-factor. I suppose I should be congratulating them for fucking up something so difficult to fuck up. Congrats, El Beach Burrito (do they really need the \"El\" in their name?).\n\nAlso the roll of the burrito was poorly executed. Way too loose, which left the burrito with a huge lengthwise crack running down it where the two sides of the tortilla didn't meet. All the juices from the chicken/beans/salsa ran out of the crack, and the result was me trying to eat something akin to a large wet bag. A pretty tasty bag though, I will concede.

I mean you're a few blocks from a street called 'La Playa', not much of a stretch... \n\nSo the first few times either of us went there went without a hitch, but the last time I went there, which will be the last time I ever go there, was pretty bad. I went up there with my buddy and walked into an empty restaurant. There was a woman in an apron, who I later found out was the owner, sitting at the front with a friend. I saw the line cook or whatever you want to call him back at sink washing some beef. I got to counter to order. He immediately came over took of a glove to handle the pen, and started to take my order. One of the few things I can do in spanish, is order a burrito, I find it usually helps get my order right. So I ordered, minding that he still had one of his raw meat gloves on, and he proceeded to put on one new glove and then pick up my tortilla WITH THE RAW MEAT GLOVE! \n\nNow I by no means am a germaphobe, but come on, especially right in front of my, that's obscene. So, once again in spanish, I politely asked him to change his gloves. As I was doing this the owner had walked over to take my friends order. I didn't notice, partially because she didn't get my attention, but apparently she gave me a pretty bad glare. The guy making my burrito was, nice and apologetic, he offered to get me a new burrito, and apologized which is all I ask for. A simple apology and remedy. As I am in the industry, that is one of the first things your learn. So he continued to make my burrito. As I was paying, the owner came up to ring me up. After I had paid, still with no acknowledgment from her, I brought up the issue, because maybe he didn't know. But  I know damn well she knows about health code, let alone common hygiene. \n\nI simply said, \"I'm not trying to be rude, and I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble, but you need to make sure he knows' (this is where she interrupts and informs me she's the owner) 'that if he is handling raw meat, he needs to at minimum change his gloves, if not wash his hands thoroughly.\" She barely acknowledged me, no \"sorry\", no \"thank you\", no comp or discount, almost the contrary.  I mean this was an egregious health code violation, for which I would have been well within my rights to throw a fit and even call the authorities. It just shows poor ownership/management ability, which is probably why she owns a flailing spot called \"El Beach Burrito\"... her loss because, my roommie and I each eat at least one burrito a week @ about $8 a pop, your looking at a minimum of about $1000/year lost revenue. At a place like that, that could make a difference. Plus none of my friends or guests, and all the people that decide not to go because of this, probably a much greater number. But whatever, her loss, in such a fickle industry she should work on the basics.\n\nFinal note: My roomies experience consisted of him getting there at 8:40, when the close at 9, and being immediately and very rudely greeted at the door by the same woman with a \"WE'RE CLOSED!\" I recommend a business that requires less human interaction lady!", "author": "Parker H."}

I don't think anything in the Mission is a whole lot better.  I grew up in the City and have eaten plenty of burritos from various taquerias in the Mission.  I think their vegetarian super burrito is surprisingly flavorful--and always warm, unlike most other taquerias.  \n\nI can't really understand why anyone would say their burritos have no flavor.  They have chicken in a red sauce, tomatillo sauce, as well as grilled and all of them are tasty and very different from each other.  Their mojado sauce is some of the best.  It definitely tastes homemade.  My dad and both of my brothers love it.\n\nI do think the food is overpriced, but I'll pay the extra $1 to have something this close to where I live.\n\nAs for the service, they are not overly friendly, but who cares?

Combined with the curious habit that Enterprise Rent-a-Car has of upgrading my economy car to something ridiculous (the first time it was a PT Cruiser, this time it was a Dodge Ram QuadCab) I had a hankering for piling a bunch of people and firewood into the truck for a good ole beach bonfire. \n\nI also had about a million errands to run since I'd just gotten back in town that day, so I found myself looking for a burrito, not in the Mission where I was earlier, but out in the Outer Sunset. Someone along the way recommended Beach Burrito so I went to check it out. Good burrito, baaaaaaaaaaaaad service. \n\nThe woman who was taking orders was SOOOOO SLOWWWWWWW. At one point, after being the single person in line for about 5 minutes (and granted, it looked like there were a couple of burritos in the works) I caught her eye and smiled. She smiled back. And then went back to putting chips into paper bags. So I asked one of the nice, but slow, young men making the burritos (honestly this guy couldn't have been more painstaking if he was restoring a Faberge egg) \"Is this where I order?\" He said, very nicely, \"Yes, yes!\" and then went back to  gilding the burrito, or whatever the eff he was doing. Then the older man who was cleaning the tables came by and said \"I'm so sorry it's taking so long; but the burritos are worth it! They really are!\" So cute...so why was no one alerting the Senora that she had a customer? Another guy arrived, stood in line behind me for another 3 minutes, I finally said loudly as the woman walked by me AGAIN \"Can I order?\" with a giant fake smile on my face. She finally took my order, was rather rude about it, and then I waited 10 minutes for a burrito that could have been made in 2. \n\nThen when the lady rang me up, she told me the total THEN WALKED AWAY before I could give her the money. The nice old man bussing the tables saw me looking homicidal and came over, but couldn't actually ring me up, so I had to wait for the woman to finish chatting with the burrito-maker-guy and come back and finish ringing me up.\n\nThe burrito turned out to be tasty (though the carne asada really reminded me of some sauteed meat dish my mom made when I was little, and mind you, I'm Vietnamese so the spice profile is way different) and the salsa bar, though limited, was good as well. Go here if you are (a) the mellow sort who can wait for things for hours or (b) the ball-breaker kind who will snap that woman to attention.", "author": "J N."}

The grilled tofu was a nice experience, but the rice and beans were totally dry and flavorless. Even doused in salsa and lime, the burrito failed to impress. It may have been a healthy burrito, but when I'm in the mood for a burrito, I'm not in the mood for light and airy-- I'm in the mood for loads of juicy beans, greasy cheese, thick rice, and spicy jalepenos.", "author": "lizzie r."}

Ordinary atmosphere.  There's not a lot of good simple places in Outer Sunset near the beach, so this is one place you can safely go to and get good comfort mexican food.", "author": "JA F."}

The salsa bar is not great and the other burritos are okay.  A little overpriced for what it really is.  Nothing special, but if you live near there I recommend calling in your order first.", "author": "Kate S."}

Oh yes, the homies at El Burrito Beach.. they are an interesting bunch.. We go way back.. well.. to a few months ago when I moved to the City.. but it seems like we have known each other forever.. Why you ask? Well, I'll tell you why.. First of all, every time I come here, they ask me if I speak Spanish.. \"Habla espanol?\" To which I respond the same way.. every freaking time.. \"un poquito\".. apparently, there is something about the way I look that screams \"this girl is fluent in Spanish\", because next thing I know, I am hearing a story about a brothers cousin's uncle who married some bitch that nobody likes and.. damn.. I should just start saying \"no, I don't speak Spanish\".. It's not like they are going to remember.. Anyway, I find the people who work there to be, though forgetful, very friendly for the most part.. and not as slow as everyone else.. I mean, if you go in there, and there are 10 people in line in front of you, then yeah, it's gonna be a minute.. if you walk up in there, and it's just you.. and it takes 13 and a half minutes to get an order of nachos that should realistically take 2 minutes to make, maybe you should be asking yourself what it is about you that makes these people hate you, and not want you to have your food in a timely manner.. I'm just sayin'.. On to the food! It's okay.. I mean, it's not great.. I find things taste better with black beans, as opposed to pinto or refried.. they have a big menu.. one thing is as good as another.. I mean, honestly, what the fuck do you want?  It's a taqueria in the Sunset for Christs sake, not the Mission.. Bottom line.. if you are a Sunsetter like me, and you are craving a burrito, this place does the job..", "author": "Francesca L."}

Very boring, with way too much refried beans that I couldn't taste the meat.  Boo to this place, but it IS only 1 of 2 taquerias way out here.  Next time, I'll get a real burrito or have something else instead.", "author": "Christine H."}

I usually get the Super Carnitas Burrito, that's been my thing lately.  The place is clean, the staff is pleasant and quick, the salsa bar has great red and green options.  If you are looking for some dependable grubbing while out at the beach, hit this place up.", "author": "Sean S."}

I've been trying to let go of the craving for bologna and cheese sandwiches left over from too many childhood beach picnics, and this place is helping me get through.  After a couple hours walking around on the beach, I can go up here and down a super veggie burrito.  And that's all I'll ever need to order here.  I can't speak for the other items on the menu, but that's one thing that they do right.", "author": "eh k."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-21", "description": "El Beach Burrito is an overpriced burrito place with crummy service and below-par burritos. The salsa leaves a lot to be desired, and they just throw a handful of chips right into the bag with the burrito instead of giving it a separate bag. I mean, 7 dollars for that? It's not really worth it, and they don't make up for it with service, routinely confusing orders and being impolite. I wouldn't go here unless you really need a burrito.", "author": "Will R."}
