Meal was $11.99.  $1 for adding the noodles and $1 more for the meat.  So total should be $13.99.  waiter said the price was $14.99 since it's $1 for adding the first item and $2 more for adding a second item. Therefore, the waiter said the total should be $14.99. WTF.  This was clearly not mentioned in the menu.\n\nAlso, the waiter walked by our table many times without asking to take our order.  The waiters always kept their heads down so they would not have to look up and see customers waving to them to to help or take the order.  When wanted extra rice, I had to. Go to cashier to ask for that and the bill.  I practically served myself so I should just tip myself.", "author": "Sidney C."}

It seems to be a new restaurant that has a more clean, open and modern look. It's not too big and at the peak lunch hour seemed to be pretty full. I think you can walk in and take any open seat after which the server will come with water and the menu. The menu is typical of Korean restaurants and includes Kalbi, Galbi, Bulgogi, bibimbap, japchae, sundubu along with a bunch of snack type items to be had with drinks like Korean Fried Chicken, Cream Corn, kimchee pancake, steamed egg etc.\n\nI decided to get the subdubu or the soft tofu soup with beef ($11.95). Five minutes after ordering I got the banchan and then the waiting started and continued for almost 20 minutes till I got my piping hot sundubu.\n\nI got five different types of banchan each of which had a decent serving size. I didn't like the kimchi that much as I would have preferred it to be a little more fermented. The sundubu also lacked intense flavors and tasted flat. It was definitely not bad just that it lacked the zing associated with good sundubu.\n\nPrice wise it was about 20% more than 707 Sutter and 10% more than Cocobang, it's two nearest competitors. Service was slow. Getting the banchan took time, getting the sundubu took ages and finally even clearing the check seemed to happen in slow motion. I was almost relieved to be finally out when everything was done with. Taste wise also I liked the subdubu at 707 Sutter a lot better than what I got here. Zzan is another place that is A-Ok at best.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I actually had Korean dinner the night before at Foxsister so it was nice to have a comparison and price wise, this place was much better. The lunch for three people here was half the price as dinner for two at Foxsister.\n\nThe food here is actually very good but the waitress was not that friendly which would bring my four stars to a three. I was craving japchae and couldn't find it anywhere on the menu so I asked the waitress and she looked at me like I was an idiot when I asked her and looked angry when I asked if I could order it. Good lord. So unnecessary. \n\nI got the veggie bimbimbap for lunch and then the japchae which was HUGE. Good thing my cousin ended up joining and we split both dishes and we were crazy stuffed by the end of it and couldn't even finish it.

I always prefer this kind of bar slash restaurant comparing to traditional bar. It's good for two person and it's also great for a group of people hang out, drinking, having conversations.

Prior to our visit, my friend informed me that Zzan stayed true to authentic Korean food, which would be unlike other Korean places I'd visited in the past. In hindsight, I completely agree! For context, Zzan is tucked away on a side street with minimal street parking, so it can be a little tough to get there. That being said, the interior is dimly lit with LEDs and has tables scattered on both sides. We were seated after roughly 30 minutes, which appears to be the norm considering the ample customer demand. Our waitress was considerate, through a little hard to hear in the hustle-and-bustle of the restaurant. We started off by ordering vegetable tempura and fried calamari, which were quickly brought out. The tempura was light and flaky, while the calamari was large and tender. We followed-up with an order of spicy fried chicken that was both crisp and flavorful. The bill was a little higher than other places I'd been to in the past, but the food quality more than made up for it. Overall, I highly recommend visiting Zzan if you're in the area and craving authentic Korean food.", "author": "Murali V."}

It's not quite the Bermuda Triangle because these youngsters don't unfortunately disappear into the abyss but rather multiple exponentially usually by text until you find yourself waiting endlessly out on the street for your number at Cocobang. You pick up '58' and the young Asian host just said '7'. Let's just call it the Korean Triangle - the popular Cocobang on the right, 707 Sutter on the top, and to the left, the newest and youngest of the bunch, Zzan. You can tell this is where all the hyperactive whippersnappers go because all three are open until 2AM, Cocobang until 4AM.\n\nI was intending to go to Cocobang but saw the crowd outside on their smartphones and scurried away. This is actually a more spacious spot than Cocobang and also a lot darker. It was easy to get a table right away here, too easy as a matter of fact, which initially concerned me. I was seated at a large, conspicuous table next to two post-adolescent Asian girls spewing profanity to each other. They were clearly the best of friends. I was perusing the multi-page menu, and as is the usual protocol, I was handed the Banchan plates moments after I told them what I wanted. Just five of them, the usual suspects including kimchi and bean sprouts and all good munchies, along with the dipping sauces for what I ordered (photo: http://bit.ly/2mddh8o).\n\nMy first dish was the $5.95 Potato Croquettes which looked perfectly round and content sitting on a sparse gathering of shredded cabbage (photo: http://bit.ly/2mwZIDs). It came with some kind of chili sauce with a mayo-like center. It was decently crispy, nothing extraordinary when it came to flavor. My main dish was the $15.95 Jok Bal, always an ambitious undertaking since it's a dish meant for a small Korean village. It's pig trotters braised in soy sauce and garlic and sliced up on a big platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2lNK082). This one was again decent, a bit dry, and surprisingly without lettuce wraps since I assume they were not saucy enough to warrant them. Oh my, here comes an army of skinny Asian youth. Perhaps they can take photos and graze on the leftovers.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...moderately moderate Korean food for young Asians, old ones like me need not apply\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...dark, clubby with tables too close together\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...intermittent\nTOTAL - 3 stars...they give you a lot of piggy and taters for sure", "author": "Ed U."}

Ordered via UberEats, so this review is solely based on food.\n\n- Fried Chicken with Soy Garlic Sauce ($14.95 + $1 for sauce) - a pretty decent serving of 8 pieces, so good for sharing between two people plus one more dish or so.  Slightly on the expensive side vs. other Korean fried chicken (KFC) places I know.  While the sauce was thick and delicious, and the chicken meat delicious, the skin was a disappointment.  I've done take-outs with KFC before and was satisfied, but this time the skin was not crispy at all, almost on the verge of being flabby.  A shame, considering how much we liked the sauce and such.  \n\n- Japchae / pan fried clear noodle ($10.95) - good soy flavor, though a bit on the oily side for my taste.  Also would have preferred if there were more veggies and meat in it; seemed like they were being stingy on those.  \n\nAll in all, while I appreciate them being open late in case I get late-night Korean food cravings, didn't quite satisfy my cravings.

Perhaps that was why my parent were taken aback initially at this decor that was clearly targeted to youngsters - blame me for not researching too thoroughly. Thankfully, because of my ignorance and stubbornness to stay, I discovered this delicious Korean restaurant in the Union Square area!\n\nThe menu is brief but straightforward: you want bibimap, KFC, or stir-fry? Then you'll easily find it on here! Despite its futuristic decor, you can find your favorite classic Korean dishes. \n\nAlthough the price was a bit higher than I would like - about $12 per entree on average, I was surprised by the portions: the bibimap was generously sized and the KFC order came with so many large pieces! The tofu soup was disappointingly small but I was too happy with the rest of the meal to care. As impressive as the portions, the bibimap was particularly delicious and the taste even differed between a seafood bibimap and a pork bibimap! I am usually indifferent about Korean cuisine because of my frequent disappointments with other places, but few restaurants like Zzan always reminded me to give this cuisine another chance.\n\nWhile the decor was probably not geared toward family dining, it's not necessarily a hindrance. With the portion considered, the price was rather reasonable, but the deliciousness of the food certainly is worth it! If you are looking for a delicious Korean meal around Union Square, Zzan is it.\n\n---\ntl;dr version:\n1) Futuristic K-pop themed restaurant\n2) Reasonably priced, generously portioned, delicious food!", "author": "Jay Y."}

A small touch I really appreciated.\n\nEverything is cooked well, served hot, and really spicy-just the way I like it.\nIt is open super late as well, 2am on most nights. \n\nThe times I've been here, every table is filled, but the wait isn't too bad.\nThis is now one of my favorite new spots in town!", "author": "Lanie L."}

I love how they have korean and american music playing with their music videos projected on the wall.  \n\nLet's talk food though: Banchan: pretty good and they kept coming out as we were munching on them.  They also have REAL kkamppungi (korean chicken wings) rather than the cut up pieces of chicken they have at other places.  The amount of wings was ridiculous! They were perfectly seasoned and crunchy, came out piping hot!  We also got ddukbokki which was good too- little different with a little more sweetness than usual which was perfecto.  \n\nDrinks: Strawberry soju was bomb.  Yogurt soju was to me- okay.  They tend to blend their flavored sojus which is different than what I'm used to in ktown in LA, but I'm not hating on it.  Makes sure that it's extra cold. ;)  It made it harder to shoot, which I guess was a good thing or else I would've been further gone quicker.  I do like the flavored soju they do here only because it's a little less sweet than usual. This is a good thing as I don't like overly sweet. \n\nService: 100%  Andy oppa's the best. :)", "author": "Meena N."}

I like that what the restaurant didn't put into decor and fancy jibber jabber, they put into a huge-a$$ TV that played hit after hit of K-Pop. #priorities Even though I was sad that I didn't hear/see one Miss A joint while we were there, there was plenty of infectiously ridiculous music to keep me entertained and ADHD-addled. As is our tradition, my friend and I started with a carafe of soju... that turned into carafeS of soju. We can't help it.

Thing is, when you're tipping back the drAnks and paying more attention to the 2946 members of the latest K-Pop boy band on the large video screen, you over order. You might try to eat everything on the table but you will fail. At least it'll taste good as you admit defeat. Far and away, you have the get the chicken wings (obviously from mutant chickens, given the enormous size of the wings. I'm not complaining). We ordered the soy garlic wings and let me tell you this: in the 7 years we have been friends, we've never had an argument. In trying to determine who was going to eat the last wing, we almost came to blows. I decided to be a Southern gentleman and let her have it.** I don't think I would have given up so easily if it weren't for the kimchi fried rice I was killing. Oh, and what was that? Spicy noodles to slurp on their own or make a carb monster and mix them with my kimchi fried rice? Don't mind if I do both. \n\nThis meal was an embarrassment of gluttony.

Come, drink, snack, enjoy the buzz. This family-run joint serves up recognizable Korean fare at (sad to say) average SF prices. \n\nDishes had on first visit:\n- Army stew (budaejjigae): looks are deceiving. Fed 3 of us until we were stuffed. At $25.95, it's cheaper than Toyose and Playground, I believe.\n- Chicken karaage with spicy sauce (#69) $10.95. Yummy! Reminded me of a Korean version of General Tso.\n\nThey have a few beers on tap, soju cocktails, and tons of other dishes I need to try on my next visit. Banchan selection could be better (unripe kimchi gives me sadface), and averages around ~3 dishes.\n\nFast, friendly service and loud KPOP music videos being projected onto the wall.

I wasn't expecting to like this but was like ddukbokki and carbonara (bacon included) and it was both spicy and the right amount of salty. The ddukbokki (rice cakes) were cooked over more than the standard chewiness, but I actually liked it and the consistency reminded me of gnocchi.\n- Yukgaejang (\"Beef Brisket Soup\" on the menu) $12.95. It had a good, mildly spicy flavor and the beef was really tender. But it was lacking a few classic ingredients so it was only OK.\n- Pan Fried Dumping $7.95. Very tasty and beefy.

Zzan is really small and the decor is kind of confused but it doesn't take away from the typical K-bar experience. There were only two waitresses and they were super busy and backed up the whole night. When I went to the restroom, I also peeked into the kitchen and saw that there were only two cooks as well. Hats off to them for handling that large dinner/late-night munchies rush! At one point, they even ran out of dishes and had to serve on paper places. \n\nOnto the food -- between my friend and me, we got an order of the chicken wings with soy glaze, kimchi fried rice with spicy pork, soondubu jiggae with beef (mild), and a pitcher of mango soju.\n\nTheir chicken wings are really big and plump but the soy glaze costed extra and wasn't particularly tasty. Even though I ordered the soondubu jiggae mild, it came pretty spicy. I'm wondering if they forgot that I ordered it mild or if their mild is more spicy than what I'm used to with other places. Their kimchi fried rice was standard. Mango soju was very icy and towards the end, super thick and syrupy. I might stick with Yogurt soju next time. \n\nBy the way, their banchan is ON POINT!! Kimchi and radish kimchi were some of the tastiest I've had in a long, long time!", "author": "Maggi K."}

When it arrived WITH lots of mushrooms, we politely sent it back to the kitchen. Rather than making a new bowl someone just picked off the first layer of most visible mushrooms and brought it back to the table. Once my daughter started mixing up the vegetables & egg into the rice ( which is the customary way to enjoy this dish), she found more mushrooms. This time she just picked them out herself but really didn't enjoy the dish as the taste of the mushrooms spreads.  \nYes, we could have sent the dish back a second time but it gets stressful to keep doing that. \nMy husbands beef ribs were nicely marinated.\nMy \"seafood\" bibimbap had far too much hot sauce, 2 shrimps and a few tiny pencil eraser size pieces of squid.\nSide dishes were tiny and most lacking in flavour & imagination. Kimchi, bean sprouts, zucchini & seaweed. The seaweed was pretty good.", "author": "Robin M."}

There aren't many tables, and your wait will be significantly longer if a large group happens to snag up some of the precious real estate inside, but for a group of 2 our wait was only about 30 minutes at 8pm on weeknight. In case you didn't know, there is a small podium set up in the left corner hidden by a table (really?) that has a waiting list for you to put your party down on. There has got to be a better way/place for that to be... but it may just be the inefficient layout of the place. They seem a little understaffed so service was slow when we went. The kitchen seemed to be the limiting factor with efficiency and the girls were running between tables and the cashier asking a lot of questions, but they were super nice with seating and service. \n\nFood-wise, I have no complaints. We started out with an order of the chicken wings which are HUGE. Probably some of the biggest wings I've ever been served at any restaurant. Bigger than 707, and 3 or 4 times bigger than what you would get from a place like Wingstop. And they were delicious. I'm definitely coming back for those.\nWe also got the kimchi fried rice and a tofu soup bowl because we were cold and hungry and need to pack on the winter insulation. While neither stood out, both were good and satisfying. We did order the soup mild, and it came out pretty red and spicy, which I would have called medium at most other places. Maybe this was a mistake, maybe Zzan just likes to turn up the heat, but thats not a deal breaker. \n\nOh, and anther thing that I feel I need to mention - the waitress was amazing at refilling our banchan. We never even needed to ask. More tip for her just for that, since for some reason that is a big part of my Korean food experience. \n\nMango soju was pretty good. It came out a little icy at the top, which I'm not not-used to, but the bottom of the pitcher was pretty thick. I should have thinned it with water or something, but that seems like something you aren't supposed to do...\n\nSo yes, I will come here again and hopefully try some of their other dishes. Oh, and did you know that they have TUESDAY WING DAY??? 0.75 per wing ($2 on top of that) but if they are the same wings that I got from my regular order I'm DEFINITELY COMING BACK FOR THAT!", "author": "Kevin S."}

Our order took a little longer than I expected, but not so long that it was unreasonable.  Also, you get a little less selection of banchan than other places, but the quality was pretty good so better than a big plate of wilted veggie sides.  We'll definitely be back!", "author": "Michelle C."}

Try their kalbi tang, kararage, and korean sausage. Forget 707 and Cocobleh! Zzan is the real deal!", "author": "zhen t."}

Arrived on time, was still hot, and came with 2 banchan sides (that were delish) and rice. The stew had a great flavor from the pork belly they used. The real way to make it! I don't know much about the rest of the food but their kimchee soup gets 5 stars. Com som nee dah!", "author": "A W."}

Meat lovers are gonna enjoy the variety of chicken they have here. We had the bibimbap (authentically hot and crispy at the bottom) and the chicken and cheese - it's like eating elevated pizza without the crust.", "author": "Isabella D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-06", "description": "Korean food is my favorite and I lived in Korea for almost a year so I know what good Korean food is. I ordered the kalbi. The menu had a section called small plates with dukpokki on it. Thinking this was appetizer size I ordered that as well.  The kalbi was good. Typical of what you find in the US when cooked in the kitchen and not at the table. The dukpokki was amazing!! I haven't had any that good since I was in Korea. And I've had it all over from coast to coast. And it was a huge bowl, not the \"small plate\" I was expecting. I ate it and took most of my kalbi to go.  The kimchi was also very good. A little salty, but all the right flavors and actually  fermented. Kimchi is just not kimchi without that zing on your tongue. I was very pleasantly surprised as it looked like it would just be another watered down, wanna-be, trendy Korean place. I read a few reviews here afterwards and all the bad ones ordered things that are not traditional Korean dishes. I imagine they need to have those dishes for those with \"American\" palates.", "author": "Jeffrey G."}
