It actually may be the first Thai restaurant I had been to after I moved away from my parents' house for the final time. It was back in 1987, and I was a cherubic bean counter for a bank. A college friend of mine had told me his favorite restaurant was this place, so I went and have been coming back on an infrequent basis ever since. Obviously I hadn't been since 2006 because I never Yelped it before, which amazes me because I feel I know this converted Victorian spot so well. The staff is still as friendly as ever, so I took Jamie W. for his first time there. Sadly, it was as still as a tomb when we were there on a rainy Saturday afternoon.\n\nBossa nova-style covers of Michael Jackson's hits were wafting from the muzak. Some worked like \"Human Nature, others didn't like \"Beat It\". We went for three hearty dishes. First up was the $15 Sam Kasatr, one of my favorite of their specialty dishes, a combination plate of sauteed chicken, beef and pork with sliced bamboo shoots and seasoned with Thai spices (photo: http://bit.ly/28NEYPy). It went really well with their $16 Pineapple Fried Rice, quite a delectable sweet-and-savory treat served in a grilled half-pineapple with fried rice blended with yellow curry and mixed with shrimp, chicken, cashew nuts, raisin, onion and fried egg (photo: http://bit.ly/28Rmjpp).\n\nI've had variations at other Southeast Asian restaurants, and this one was up there. Our last dish was the $12 Pad Se Ew with Chicken, a Thai classic with pan-fried noodles with fried egg and broccoli in a thick soy sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/28ONY9O). All the food reminded me that Thep Phanom is like my late mom. Yeah, I'd forget to call her. Sure, I didn't come home when I told her I would so she could do my laundry. But she would make me some nice dinner anyway, even though she hated to cook beyond heating up the Toshiba rice cooker. I guess I should come back here more often, Mom. But you should work on your health score. I mean 76, c'mon. No, Mom, I'm not being critical. Love ya...\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...familiar Thai dishes better than I remembered\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...an old Victorian done up with some semi-kitschy Siamese decor\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...still friendly as ever\nTOTAL - 4 stars...sorry Mom...I mean Thep Phanom...I'll call more often", "author": "Ed U."}

They also serve brown rice for the health-conscious. \n \nF O O D \nWhen it comes to ethnic cuisine, I prefer the most authentic and exotic dishes possible, so we asked the owner's daughter to order for us.  \n\n*THEP THONG: Deep Fried Chicken & Corn Balls (HH Special-$5, Regularly $8.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=du0cRl7x3drCaOzqu5Di_A\nHot and crispy, the deep fried bags were filled with savory pieces of ground chicken and sweet tender corn. The Thai chili sauce added a nice sweet heat to the golden bags. \n\n*KOO GUT: Crispy Fried Yam & Taro w/ Peanut Sauce ($8.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=kIZA0XE_AWNcFf7qsXSLiQ\nThick slices of the yam and taro were fried to crunchy crisp. I have a taro obsession, but I preferred the yam because it had a soft, tender texture with sweetness that went well with the savory, nutty peanut sauce. \n\n*CRYING TIGER: Spicy Grilled Beef Salad ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=dla3wZb7OTh-V0WntXw5bw\nThe grilled beef was wonderfully seasoned with prominent hints of garlic and ginger. The char from the grill added a nice smokiness and the vinaigrette gave a nice acidic punch to help balance everything out. \n\n*THE DANCING LADY: Grilled Jumbo Prawns Stuffed w/ Crab & Serves w/ Spicy Sauce ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=cx7YHZWrFMGTcnuL4wsDeQ\nHuge, succulent prawns generously stuffed with tender, sweet crabmeat. It was a simple dish, but the creative presentation, the seafood duo combo, along with the tangy, spicy sauce made for an exotic dish jam-packed with flavor. \n\n*TAMARIND FISH: Tilapia in Tamarind Sauce ($16.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=LWR6aQZOrkfduyKdOCx-xw\nThe tilapia was crisp on the outside and tender, flakey on the inside. It was coated with a sticky tamarind sauce which gave a subtle sweet and sour flavor that didn't overpower the delicateness of the fish. \n\n*PED TOD: Boneless Duck w/ Plum Sauce ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=7WuTdRtg1RPxpV6YZvdOug\nSimilar to a Chinese roast duck, the skin was ultra crispy; however, it was deep-fried which crisped the duck pieces all around the edges while still maintaining a tenderness inside. The duck was salty and savory with a hint of sweetness. The plum sauce added just the right amount of sweetness with an acidic layer to help cut through some of the richness. \n\n*BIRDS OF PARADISE: Chef's Famous Quail ($14.95)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=AXddd23Uk9qIS87-D2vpfw\nPerfectly crispy on the outside, the quail still maintained a juicy, tenderness in the inside. I love that the wing was fried to a golden crunchiness which allowed me to devour the wing in it's entirety--crunchy goodness!\n\n*Homemade Cream & Espresso Creme Brulee\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mNBVE3uYArH0xwW3FM5gLA?select=2ppCU4rbOe5eh6gJiuWlZQ\nThe homemade vanilla ice cream was rich and creamy with a delicate sweetness. The silky smooth espresso cr\u00e8me brulee gave my taste buds a nice jolt with a sweet bitterness which was balanced with a crisp caramelized sugar crust.\n\nS E R V I C E\nFriendly and attentive but in a reserved manner.  Food came out relatively quickly and there wasn't much wait time between dishes. Each table was given a water bottle so you can refill your own water glasses which I prefer. \n\nA M B I A NC E / D \u00c9 CO R \nClassy, exotic, and quaint; Thep Phanom is perfect for date or a small group dinner. The customary formal Thai clothing the wait staff wears and the ambiance's royal elegance makes for a unique dining experience compared to other Thai restaurants. \n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking which is more easily found up the block on Fillmore Street. \n\nLooking for a place to tickle your taste buds? If so, Thep Phanom will provide you with that exotic, sensuous gustatory relief.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The food was a delicious adventure, as was the ambiance. The friendly and prompt service complimented the meal to make for a great dining experience. The only thing that would make it better would be if they still handed out chocolate mints with the check at the end of the meal - specifically the flat little rectangles dressed in green foil. Nevertheless, if you're looking for a great neighborhood Thai experience, I highly recommend Thep Phanom!\n\nWe ordered:\n\nTom Kha Gai (chicken in coconut soup): Warm, milky, with lemon flavor. Great appetizer & big enough serving for 2 hungry people.\n\nPed Sawan (marinated boneless duck in honey sauce): Sweet, hearty, delicious! Came with rice with the CUTEST presentation - see pic. The handle sticking out the top of the rice belongs to a oar-like paddle, for you to ladle out the tiny carb packets onto your plate. Had leftovers for a yummy lunch the next day!\n\nKaeng Karee Gai (yellow curry chicken with onion and potato): This dish made us laugh because they really didn't skimp on the potatoes! The potato in this curry came in halves or quarters, not tiny little slices. \n\ntl;dr - Friendly Service | Gorgeous Ambiance | Interesting Food with Generous Portions", "author": "Chelsea M."}

The sauce it comes with is intensely syrupy sweet and had a strange aftertaste.  Very underwhelming.\n\nThe tom yum soup with shrimp had a nice broth, but had some glaring flaws.  The prawns were absolutely butchered, sliced way too far open to remove the vein, and random bits and pieces hanging on for dear life.

There were raw pieces of galangal in the soup, which are inedible and should not be served, and then raw bell pepper and white onion.  I know some people like raw bell peppers, but the completely uncooked onion in the soup didn't make any sense and just overpowers. \n\nThe pad thai suffered the same prawn issue, being mutilated and overcooked (but not as bad).  The noodles were overcooked and all stuck together in a big lump.

I looked it up on yelp and saw 3.5 stars and we were about to turn around, but there was no way I was waiting an hour and a half when I was this starving.\n\nWe were seated right away (party of 2) and the restaurant was full, but not packed.  The decor set a good atmosphere, and the settings made the place feel upscale. I liked that the rice came in the little baskets, but also appreciated the plastic lining (I would get nervous that the basket wouldn't really ever be clean without it). Much better than bringing it in a regular bowl like every other place. The service was great - checking in enough, but not too much.  It was that seamless \"I'm there when you need me, but not disrupting your evening\" kind of manner. One star for nice ambience and one star for service.\n\nI have a food allergy, and the staff was very knowledgeable about it and was able to recommend dishes or alterations to dishes to accommodate me.  That, I love.  I get so nervous when the staff has no clue and you can tell they are guessing. When our server wasn't sure, he double-checked with the chef and was happy to do so. One star alone for just setting me at ease.\n\nThen to the food... We tried four dishes: Tofu Sate, Fresh spring rolls, Salad (I am blanking on which one, but it also had tofu) and the tofu/pumpkin curry. The spring rolls were great and had a nice twist with added mushrooms.  I didn't get to try my friends salad (it had soy sauce, part of my allergy) but she said it was good.  The curry was really tasty, and it's hard to go wrong with pumpkin.  The presentation really was great and added to the upscale feel. However, the dishes really weren't pricey (so no upscale bill!). I think our total came to ~$50.  That's a good meal - $25 per person, with so much food.  No complaints with the food - so one more star. \n\nI'm glad we took a chance even though it was only 3.5 stars on yelp, because this place is really 4 stars.  We had a very pleasant experience, good service, good food - this may be a new addition into our \"regular\" rotation.", "author": "Liz M."}

The texture and taste make this great comfort food.  The tom kom gai soup, with chicken and lemongrass, was tasty but pretty standard.  My entree of tamarind pork was tender and accompanied by a sweet tamarind sauce that was too sweet for my taste.

We asked the waiter for recommendations and he offered nothing more than quickly directing us to the two most expensive items on the menu. \n\nAppetizer offering was all fried and the soups do not offer individual portions. They also charge $2 for a bowl of rice to eat with meals that are made to be eaten with rice. How generous. \n\nAlso, I've never been to a restaurant where 18% gratuity is automatically added to a party of 4 followed by the sales tax being added last. Essentially we were charged 3% more on tip and then taxed on the full amount so the restaurant is pocketing extra tax money.  \n\nAnd never have I been charged a fee to have the bill split evenly four ways on credit card.

The second course, tom kha gai, the ubiquitous coconut soup I usually love, was sort of pedestrian.  It was so full of inedible flavoring ingredients that I had to fish out large, tough pieces of lemon grass, galangal, etc. with every bite--ironic, considering the lack of complexity in the flavor.  Folks, strain your soup.  A piece or two I don't mind, but this was much too much.  The folks at the adjoining table were having the same experience with their soup.  The pumpkin/shrimp red curry entree had four chunks of pumpkin and two prawns, and the curry was sort of an unimaginative one-note flavor.  Hot, but just not...good.\n\nHere in San Francisco it's easy to become jaded with the number of really good Thai restaurants (three excellent ones within about five blocks of my house, for example) that a mediocre one stands out more than it might elsewhere.

Ok, to be honest, they're just average looking and everyone and their mom, even my mom, has one hanging in their yard. I prefer to hang mine indoors. Why, you ask? Because the sounds of those bitches clinking together is like nails on a freaking chalkboard or the continuous sound of the tape gun in the returns department at my work, which my office just so happens to be conveniently located next to.\n\nWhatever, the point is I find the charming touristy chimes to be obscenely annoying.\n\nBoyfriend and I decided to go out for Thai in my new hood and being the lazy, haven't-walked-more-than-two-blocks-in-a-year couple that we are, we chose Thep Phanom because it was two blocks from my new digs.\n\nRight away I fell in love with the place. No, it wasn't the shiny Sinbad pants the waiters were obviously forced to wear, it wasn't the constant water refills, it wasn't the overall decor, it was the papier mache elephants that greet you when you walk in the door. I LOVE ELEPHANTS! They're my thing. I know it's rather elementary to be obsessed with an animal. For example, I was always totally freaked out by \"horse girls\" back in sixth grade. Dood! Get a life and stop braiding that Breyer Horse's tail!\n\nBut for real, elephants...did you ever know that you're my hero?\n\nBack to the wind chime reference....the ambiance of the place was set by the sounds of what seemed to be a CD of a band who plays chimes as their instruments. It was clinky, weird and not very pretty at all. \n\nWe were pretty ravenous coming into the place and were really let down by our crispy tofu with peanut sauce appetizer. The tofu was completely bland, as tofu is. But it needed more umph! And though the peanut sauce was good, it was a bit watery and needed more peanut flavor.\n\nThe Tom Kha Gai was delicious, but the servers seemed really intent on serving our food in courses. And I like my rice doused with a healthy serving of Tom Kha Gai. So we ate a bit of our soup and waited for our final dish and the rice to come. But they kept coming by and asking if we were done with the soup, or if we wanted it wrapped up. Or they would just come over and stare into our obviously unfinished bowls. I finally told them that we wanted our soup with the rest of the food.\n\nThe shrimp with chili paste and green beans was good, but nothing spectacular. \n\nI'll come back because it's ridiculously close to my apartment, but I've got to admit I wasn't overly impressed by the food. I did appreciate them being on top of the water, checking in to see that everything was ok, and promptly bringing us our bill.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-01-23", "description": "So sad.\r\n\r\nThep Phanom used to be one of our favorites when we lived in the lower Haight. Even once we moved to another part of town, we kept coming back because the food was head and shoulders above the ordinary. \r\n\r\nA few years ago, they started sliding. It seemed that the drop in quality coincided with the removal of the specials boards from above the windows. Although it paled in comparison, the food was still very good, and we kept coming back, kept recommending it as our favorite Thai place, kept ugring people to go...\r\n\r\nSo you can imagine our sadness after eating there twice in the last 6 weeks, and having two mediocre experiences. In December, we ordered a pair of our old favorites -- tom yum goong and crispy basil chicken -- plus salt-and-pepper beef, a new one for us. The soup was bland and unbalanced; the chicken, formerly blessed with a wispy crispy coating, now had a blatant battering; and the beef was interesting but not terribly Thai-flavored, and unpleasantly chewy. We chalked it up to a bad night, and didn't give it much thought.\r\n\r\nLast weekend, we went back with a couple of friends. We shared everything, so I had a chance to grasp the breadth of the problem:\r\n\r\nSom tam -- green papaya salad -- is typically blazingly hot and pungently tart. Thep Phanom's version was neither. The rather small portion was served in a cocktail glass.\r\n\r\nTom yum goong was dished out tableside into flat soup plates, rather than bowls. The broth was almost clear, not even a hint of redness from steeped shrimp shells or chiles. It tasted almost as bland as it looked: no hot, barely any sour, a paltry 4 shrimp for 4 people. \r\n\r\nLarb ped featured tasty grilled, chopped duck meat, but the rest of the dish was bizarre. There were hardly any greens --typically you eat larb by rolling up the meat and seasonings in leaves of lettuce or other leafy veggies -- and, again, the spice was almost non-existant. Larb is supposed to be HOT!\r\n\r\nBasil chicken with crispy basil (gai kprow tod) suffered from the same problems as we noted on our last visit. Very sad... this dish used to be a true standout, a modern riff on a beloved thai classic. Now it wouldn't be out of place at a cheap chinese takeout joint.\r\n\r\nPanaeng beef curry was unspicy, badly balanced (sweet flavors completely overwhelmed the salty, spicy tastes) and oversauced.\r\n\r\nThep Phanom is still OK, but it's no longer great.

Looking for food in the Lower Haight, a friend and I decided this was the place to go as the other 2 thai options on Haight just didn't cut it.  (I only order Chili Cha Cha for delivery)\n\nIt was crowded but we were promptly seated in the back and I proceeded to have an extremely pleasan dining experience.\n\nThe ambiance inside is nicer then most little thai places.  The bar in the back is cute and the place was alive with chatter and good lighting.\n\nI scanned the menu and could not decide.  This was one of those thai places that didn't have pad see ew on the menu.  Finally free of my pad see ew shackles, I was free to try something new!  Who would have thought that I could partake in a new thai delicacy!  Freedom!  \n\nThey were offering a fixed price 3 course menu for their anniversary and it seemed the smartest thing to do to get an appetizer, a soup and an entree for $17.95.\n\nMy meal started with an awesome little plate of crispy wantons filled with minced chicken and corn.  There were only 2 of them and i was grateful for that, because the diet doesn't really call for anything fried. They weren't greasy in the slightest.\n\nThis was followed by the Thom Kha Gai which was a good balance, all lime and cocunut milk (The diet doesn't call for cocunut milk either so I took it easy and left most of the broth behind).\n\nMy entree was the spicy basil salmon, which totally delivered in spicy, not too much, but just enough.  The portion, again, not gigantic, but enough.  I liked their sizes as this ensured you could have a 3 course meal without feeling like a manatee afterwards. \n\nI love that they offer brown rice.  The brown rice was fluffy and good and not crunchy and sad like when I try and make it.\n\nThe staff was great and they let my friend and I loiter at our table for 2 hours after we finished eating.  \n\nI cannot wait to go back!", "author": "Jen I."}

Then I saw that Yelpers had collectively given this place a 4-star rating. Even more letdown, for it's the first time I've really doubted the usefulness of Yelp's future recommendations. At what point does the lack of information about each wildly diverse user, plus the distortions caused by individuals with special interests, begin to flood the system with nonhelpful ratings? I would hate to see Yelp turn into Amazon.com reviews or eBay ratings, where overall numbers cease to mean much and you have to read every single rating of something to (manually) extract any sort of value.  I thought Yelp was special. I thought Yelp was different. Don't be like the others who broke my heart, Yelp.\n\nSo, back to Thep Phanom. I can't understand why anyone would put this in their \"Best Thai\" list. A list of grievances:\n\n0. Not a hole-in-the-wall. How can you expect good Asian food that's presented in such a whiteified interior and proud of its ZAGAT ratings? Nothing says \"I am a boring snob who isn't a real foodie but has money to spend and therefore like to think I am cultured, because I rely religiously on this book that all the other boring rich losers read\" more than the owning a Zagat guide. Nonetheless, this is not a dealbreaker, merely a warning sign. \n\n1. Waiters in \"The King & I\" type, bright purple genie pants. This isn't some exotic Asian show. It's a restaurant. It looks horribly demeaning. But look at the all the reviewers who think the outfits are soooo cool! Geez. Go back to Oklahoma.\n\n2. Red curry was bland. Not spicy enough, and I couldn't really taste any of the spices. The only thing carrying the curry was the coconut milk, but that's like saying, I went to French Laundry and thought the prepackaged mints I ate while waiting to be seated were tasty. \n\n3. Ginger chicken was bad. Seriously, not even good. Way too salty, especially the black mushroom fungus that accompanied it. Not spicy at all. Not much flavor. \n\n4. They didn't even bother asking what level of spiciness we wanted on anything. Do you ever go to a steakhouse and they don't ask you how you want your steak done? \n\nIt's depressing just thinking about how not good this place was, how Yelp failed as a trusty resource, and how many tastebud-less, unadventurous (how hard is it to find good thai in SF?!), un-foodies there are ruining these ratings. \n\nI need a drink.

All the dishes have catchy, yet strange names like \"Weeping Lady\" - name aside, that dish, although supposedly delicious, did not appeal to me. We did have a yummy tofu, eggplant, squash basil stir fry and a fried spicy prawn dish. I wouldn't get the prawns again - and but the tofu dish is a repeat.

This has always been a treat for us but over the last 3-4 years things have really taken a turn for the worse.  There is only one dish we order EVERY time: the crispy chicken with crispy basil.  Unintentionally, this has become our gauge.  Sad to say the consistency has always been a problem.  The portions varied drastically, and the amount of the delicious sauce fluctuated from swimming in it to merely a mist, like those annoying fragrance models at the mall are dishing it up!   The only thing that has been consistent has been the upwardly mobile prices.\n\nTonight we ordered the Crispy Chicken, Eggplant with tofu, and rice.  It came to $26, that's borderline overpriced, but when we finally got home and broke out the food, there was hardly enough to have a meal...and the chicken was almost sauceless!  \n\nIt is so sad when any business becomes arrogant and out of touch with their client base.  I'll tell them about the problems because they should have the opportunity to remedy them before they get the boot and, let's be honest, I'm selfish, I don't want to have to find another restaurant to replace this one.  \n\nPlease, I'm begging, Thep-phanom get your act together and bring back the quality and value that's been missing for the past few years and rightfully earn the Best Thai title.", "author": "Scott M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-09", "description": "The quality of the food is high; the presentation is wonderful; the space comfortable; but the flavor disappoints.  The ingredients used were excellent, but I found all entrees I've tried to be on the bland side with little punch.  I felt as if the cooks were holding back.  I sense this could be a phenomenal restaurant with real curries -- thick and bold rather than frail and hurried.  But it seems they've dumbed it down.  Everything is top-notch except the taste -- which is a real disappointment because most of the Thai restaurants in the area are bigger on flavor but short on quality ingredients (and so many of them use MSG.  I suspect Thep Phanom does not -- though I don't know that for a fact).  It's a shame when less masterful restaurants are able to produce more excitement.  The quality is certainly here; the flavor is not.\n\nI am frustrated with this review because a 3-star review of Thep Phanom doesn't fairly represent the quality and potential of this restaurant.  It would be like giving the movie Shrek four-stars and giving the movie Gandhi four-stars.  Can you really compare Shrek to Gandhi?  Can one honestly say that because their rating is the same that they are equally as good?  The countless other 3-star Thai restaurants in the Bay Area don't hold a candle to the mastery that was expressed in quality, attention to detail, and presentation.   But, once again, there was little dimension in the flavor.  Hence the depressed rating.  I sense that the brilliance is dormant -- much like a smart student who never studies.  She still gets good marks, but not the kinds of marks that she could get.  Whereas other Thai restaurants work for their 3-star ratings, Thep Phanom earns its rating in its sleep.\n\nI emphasize my qualification of this review simply because I've eaten at so many mediocre Thai restaurants in the area.  To equalize Thep Phanom to the majority of Thai establishments seems unfair.  At the same time, it really needs to step up its game.  Despite its lack, I would return.  The disappointment from Thep Phanom is that it doesn't live up to its potential.  The disappointment from the other Thai restaurants is that they are just not good.

We were really impressed with the original variations on the usual thai fare.  There's no reason that a chef shouldn't experiment with standard dishes.  Many people have an ethnic food hang-up, and expect their foods to act in just one way.\n\nWe ordered the fried yams and taro in peanut sauce, the Thaitanic Tofu, and the Panang Tofu.  We were really, really impressed by the more intricate flavors that each dish had.  We will always notice when thai food isn't spicy, and were shocked when looking back, after reading a few yelp reviews, to realize that it wasn't at all.  And we scare people with how spicy we like our food.\n\nThe yams and taro were fried perfectly, with an amazing sauce and were served standing up in two aperitif glasses, rimmed with peanuts, making them envied by the next table.

Tons of crispy basil and amazing fried chicken instead of the usual stir-fry.  The prawns in the red curry were HUGE, and well not that huge, but they were large and damn fine quality.  You get the idea.  As all the ingredients here seem to be.  Oh yeah, and the curry had a refreshingly strong lemon grass aroma.\n\nAnd any place that would give out a free glass of wine for their anniversary is just cool.  The waiters and waitresses were really nice, and move really quickly, even when they were dealing with the one downside of our meal, the huge and rude birthday party of people who were so bad that no other patrons even chimed in to sing to the birthday boy.\n\nAnyway, we still cant wait to go back and save some room for the desserts because they looked awesome at the other tables.  We found that it was a really good deal for such excellent food, with such original tastes, oh, and very pleasant decor.", "author": "Nicole and Kayvon B."}

But it's so good and there is a need to share it with other people.\n\nThe place is neat and full of a lot of Thai decorations even in the restroom.\nTheir iced tea is our drink every time.  We especially like its aluminum cup.  We tried their Tom Yum Goong and Tom Kha Pak.  I got caught once by the little green pepper in the soup and my mouth was on fire!!!  The soup would be our choice again but I just need to remember not to touch the green pepper.  We also tried their curry chicken.  It's mild and tasteful.  Pad Thai is our choice all the time since it's the best we have ever had.  The dancing lady would be a choice if you liked prawn.  The must choice is the Crispy Fried Portobello Mushroom.  And you wouldn't find it in other places.\n\nBasically everything there is good and you won't go wrong with any dish.  The only difference is spicy level.  Every time we stick with some dishes we like and experience 1 or 2 new thing.  Never get bored with their menu.\n\nWe love this place and it becomes our most favorite Thai restaurant since the first visit.", "author": "Ile F."}

The veggie fresh spring rolls are great, but only served on Friday and Saturday nights, disappointingly.\n\nBetter to go with a small group where you can share many options.  The Thaitanic Tofu is pretty good.  Servers very polite.  Do not order the Tamarind fish unless you're prepared for the full fish, head and all, to arrive on a plate!

I've always found the food to be great. One drawback is that, over the years, it seems the prices have crept upward. It's no longer the cheap and great Thai restaurant, now it's a bit spendy, I think due to its continuing popularity.

I've been to that other Thai place that's supposed to be good where you take your shoes off and the portions are minuscule.  I've been to the other thai place around the corner from Thep Phanom, I've been to 2 Osha restaurants (talk about overpriced), and I've tried at least 5 others in the city.  This is the best one by far, and their service is great.  How many restaurants nowadays actually change out your silverware after your appetizers...?\n\nMy favorites are appetizer #1 (forget the name) these fried corn and chicken dumplings...the pumpkin prawn curry...the crispy duck (warning-must like duck fat)...and last night I had the whole fish with the spicy ginger and garlic sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.\n\nAnd...I LOVE the fact that this place has DESSERT.  Ok, they may not be Thai, but I don't care.  The Kahlua Creme Brule is amazing...I get it every time.

The moment I took it out of the bag I could smell the burnt noodles, and it tasted charred as well.  We ended up throwing out both of our FULL noodle dishes (for $11 each) and going hungry- that means it had to be really bad, as we were starving by the time it was delivered. The chicken wings were good- but plain, no sauce comes with them.  I would stay away from this place- even Chili Cha Cha is better (and I don't love that place).

The curries and seafood combos are delicious and the Thep specials will not disappoint you, i suggest the 'Crying Lady'- Jumbo prawns and the Thaitanic beef.  Fried whole tilapia and the fillet with spicy sauce are great. Amongst the appetizers the boneless stuffed wings and Tod Mun are amongst my favs.  Anytime the chef has made efforts to de-bone chicken wings and re-stuff them with glass noodles and black mushrooms you know you are in for a treat.

My Brother had frequented this place in the late 80's when it was 1/3 its current size (yes, it was THAT small).  THe place had grown to be one of most prized Thai place in the City.  My brothers, sister & I decided to come out here for dinner  one evening in 2000.   I was fortunate to have been able to witness the fine cuisine I was told about so much.  \n\n  Fast forward to tonight.  Although many of their dishes are unique and delicious (and the standards are good as well) it just wasn't the same eye-popping tongue-dancing experience I remembered in 2000.  I know the owners are still the same, because the owners know my brother very well.  We were given a very friendly welcome into the restaurant and the owners even gave us a few appetizers on the house!  The ambience is the same beautiful authentically decored mini palace as it was 7 years ago.  Their beef with basil was scrumtious and I also enjoyed the duck!  However, having the expectation I had from remembering my 2000 experience took one star from my rating Thep Phanom.  I would expect a reputable establishment like this to continue serving their food consistently over time.  But being that Thep Phanom holds a special place in my heart for the occassions I've been there with my brothers & sister should definately earn them two of the four stars.  The Thai food is authentic and delicious, but don't expect to be overly blown over, unless they come back to their original recipes.\n\nDishes we were served tonight:\n\n- Lemon Grass Salad - Chicken & Shrimp with cashew nuts, lemon grass, & spicy lemon dressing. ***\n- \"The Crying Tiger\" - Grilled Beef Salad with Spicy Garlic Dressing *****\n- Panang Chicken - ****\n- Nan Kruan (\" The Weeping Lady\") - Chicken with grilled eggplant garlic, chili, and basil. ***\n- Salt & Pepper Crispy Beef Strips - with cashews and crispy basil *****\n- Ped Sawan - Boneless duck in honey sauce over spinach. *****\n\n(the \"*'s\" were my star ratings for each dish).", "author": "Gio G."}

The atmosphere in the restaurant is very cozy and the two of us felt immediately comfortable. The wait staff was attentive and our order arrived very quickly. For an appetizer we ordered the Tod Mun Plah (fried fish cake) which was good, and the cucumber salad garnish went very well with it. I'm not sure if I would order it again, though.\nOur first entree was \"The Weeping Lady\" (Sauted minced chicken with grilled eggplant , garlic , chili and basil ) and it was amazing.  The dish is extremely spicy, so caution to those who can't take a little heat.  The minced chicken and grilled eggplant go very well together, the textures complimenting eachother perfectly.\nWe also ordered the Panang Nuer.  It's pretty difficult to screw up a panang curry dish, and Thep Phanom's dish was definitely up to par, but didn't really offer anything that I haven't seen at other thai restaurants as far as this dish goes.  That's not to say it was bad - panang curry is one of my favorites and this dish certainly satisfied.\nAll in all, our dinner here was a very enjoyable experience.", "author": "Gerald V."}

The green curry was ok but nothing to write home about (but then again, when is it ever?).  As a side note, the a la carte sticky rice portions are pretty small.  The Beef Thaitanic was disappointing and tasted like something I'd get at a Chinese restaurant, not a Thai one.  I don't know why I ordered the Thaitanic and only ordered it based on the waitress's recommendation.  The mango/sticky rice was way overpriced, the portion was TINY (the amount that fits in a hollowed mango half), was overly sweet, and doused in a sweet coconut liquid.  The meal came out to about $25 a person and in my opinion, was a bit too much.  Worth a visit, but expect to pay more than you normally do.", "author": "David L."}

I was served the worst inedible rancid red curry dish here and I am scared to return. I sent it back and was treated as if the dish was fine and I didn't know any better. Sheesh, I've been eating Thai food since the 80's. I give two stars for the crispy and better-than-most fried tofu with peanut sauce, but a person cannot live on that dish alone.", "author": "Paris E."}

They put some white tablecloths out, lit some candles, and redecorated within the past decade unlike most Thai restaurants. I'm sure they're going to jack up the prices for these charming touches.\" SO not true. \n\nThe service was great, the food was plentiful and spiced just right and even had some flair in the presentation. Not every day you get that at a Thai place. I highly recommend the prawns stuffed with crab meat. The Pad Thai is good but generic. Kind of hard to put much of your own spin on it, I guess. Thep Phanom is a little out of my way geographically but I will definitely make my way back there as soon as possible.", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

In the past, I really thought their food was fresh and so tasty and creative.\nI was extremely disappointed. Nothing really tasted fresh. It just wasn't good.  I am so sorry that I wasted any money there tonight.\nThey are riding on their past reputation.  They need a new chef or something.

This has got to be the most over-hyped restaurant. I've had much better food in many other places in the city - Marnee Thai, Thai Basil, Thai Time. This is the second time I've been here (not sure why I went back after I didn't think it was great, but that was over a year ago). Went there last night and had the prix fixe menu. Eggrolls barely warm, salmon - totally gross - sort of slimey and the soup was average. Not a memorable meal. Will not be going back anytime soon.", "author": "M B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-06-14", "description": "I've never actually taken a bite from any of the dishes offered by this establishment, so you're probably wondering how I could be justified in giving such a low rating. My boyfriend and I had heard rave reviews about this joint, so we thought we'd give it a go. So we walk in, only to be given the stink eye by everyone in the place - staff and customers alike. Already a strike against the place. Then we sat in the corner and waited. And waited. No water. No service. Just a judgmental look out of the corner of the server's eye. So we thought, well, let's look at the menu. The prices were enough to let us know that we were the wrong restaurant. Sure, I like to splurge, but nothing even seemed worthy of paying that much. I felt that the vegetarian menu was pretty half-ass. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I should try the food first. But it's more than just taste - it's also about the atmosphere, and I definitely did not feel welcome from the second I walked in.", "author": "Brittany L."}

We had high expectations especially from having vacationed to Thailand and know what good Thai food is like. We were very disappointed the food was very Americanized Thai food and was not very special at all. We ordered two appetizers and three entrees to get a flavor and only one out of three were good. The fried Talapia was over cooked not moist inside, the stuffed chicken wings were not that crispy and the chicken tasted like an old hen & was a bit greasy, the food was not that great. It lacked a lot of flavors and just so so. I do not know if they had a bad night but I heard others nearby complain that the food has lost some of its quality. I even asked the waiter what place he would recommend and he told me he thought Sai Jai Tai was a lot better if I wanted more authentic Thai. The photos' looked great but the food was a big disappointment.", "author": "Jim P."}

We had a 10 min wait, which wasn't too bad since we were adequately warned. In general, the food was tasty, but not spectacular. Our \"lemongrass tofu\" didn't taste like lemongrass at all and left us wondering if they ran out of the proper ingredients for this dish. We ordered our food spicy but it turned out to be mild. The service was pretty bad too. They forgot our order, which wasn't complex at all (1 appetizer, 2 entrees, no special requests except for the spicing), and the head waitress had to ask what we wanted again. It took a very long time to get our dishes, including the appetizer. People seated after us got their food before we did and by the time our entrees came, I wasn't really hungry anymore. It's also a bit pricer than your average thai restaurant. Some things we liked were the thai iced teas (not super sweet, which was refreshing), the restaurant decor, and the food presentation. It was definitely a little more classy than most thai restaurants, but you pay the extra $$$ for it.  \n\nNot sure we'll be back since I've had better food and service at other places.", "author": "Rekha S."}

Actually the 1st time we had takeout and this was the 1st time inside the restaurant. We were seated within a few minutes of arriving. For a Monday night the place was packed. The service was really great and everyone was very friendly and patient with our group of 4 trying to decide what to have. We all had a bunch of different appz. and main entrees sharing everything. They even had several special dishes and we chose one. Everything was super good, served hot and timed well. They also had a very nice wine list. We had 3 bottles (lushes...all of us) of Chardonnay all very tasty and reasonable in price $32.00-$36.00. Most of the plates ran between $10-$14 and were a sizeable portion.  Don't go here if your looking for a quiet evening...the place is somewhat short on space and everyone is packed in (I guess you could say \"cozy\")so it can get loud in there.
