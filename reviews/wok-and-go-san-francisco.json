Not a lot of Chinese restaurants cook broccoli beef god, this one met my standards and surpassed my expectations! The beef was tender, the broccoli had the right combo of crunchy and cooked but not beat to death tender.. the salt and pepper chicken wings had a good crunch to them but not over cooked or solid as rocks like other restaurants. Five stars for me, no doubt! Fast delivery too.

Improvement. \n\nThere is something to be said about the presence of a \"Chinese\" restaurant located in the most unexpected places. However, with this in mind, Wok & Go is located in a corner that favors good foot traffic, potential for good business [if they know how to harness], and convenient to a well known county hospital, Zuckerberg San Francisco General. \n\nThe restaurant is set up for point, pack, and go dish items. Recommendation; go early when the entrees are fresh and well presented. Restaurant workers tend to get frazzled when there are more people than they can serve. Don't bother calling in orders; the last two experiences reflect that they are unreliable in mere order taking. Visuals at the restaurant works best. \n\nWould I go back? yes and no. The food choices are typical Americanized Chinese dishes; i.e. beef broccoli. Reasonable prices. But for someone who works in the area; it's okay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-11-04", "description": "I've ordered delivery from Wok & Go through Eat24 two times, both times for the porridge, since I've been suffering from a cold. At this time, there aren't very many restaurants on Eat24 that offer porridge.\n\nMy first order was on Monday for lunch, and the food was delivered within the expected window of time. I ordered only two items, just enough to fulfill the minimum for delivery. I got the Fish Porridge and the Chicken Salad. The porridge was exactly what I wanted. It was plain but flavorful enough, with nice soft chunks of fish and rice. The chicken salad was disappointing. There was way too much white, creamy dressing, rendering the salad a soggy mess. The chicken pieces were breaded (fried). I was hoping for a healthy salad, and this one was NOT that, by any means.\n\nMy second order was on Wednesday for dinner, and the food was delivered almost an hour after the expected delivery time, two hours after the order was placed. The original Eat24 delivery time estimate was 45-60 minutes. I'm not sure whether the fault lies more on Eat24 on getting the delivery time estimate wrong or with the restaurant for not delivering within the expected timeframe. When the bag of food arrived, much of the sauce for the Ma Po Tofu had spilled out into the bag. The Ma Po Tofu itself wasn't what I was hoping for. The tofu was in big, hard-ish, dry-ish blocks, and the \"spicy\" sauce was runny, consisting of red and jalepeno peppers. The Fish Porridge was the same as it had been for my previous order: satisfactory. \n\nFrom these two experiences, I'd only re-order the porridge. I'm not confident the rest of the menu will \"deliver\" the experience I want.", "author": "Jennie Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-04", "description": "TL,DR: Below average food, but reliable. Terrible service. If you have time, do yourself a favor and go to the Mission instead. \n\nIn terms of food, it's serviceable. They have a steam table out during lunch, from which you choose a base carb (fried rice, lo mein, and chow fun) and then pick 1, 2, or 3 hot sides to go with it. It's reliable in that the options don't vary much from day to day, and the food always tastes the same.\n\nI can only give two stars because of the service--the first time I went I got the buffet lunch, which is supposed to include soup. When I asked the lady for soup, she grunted, \"no soup today\" without making any eye contact. I couldn't tell her I didn't want the meal anymore at that point, so I paid the full price.\n\nI went two more times over a week and a half to test to see if there was any change--each time, the same lady told the same thing, \"no soup today\". Seriously--it wouldn't bother me HALF as much if she simply told me that they no longer serve soup. I hate being lied to by people who sell me food that will enter my body. Not to mention that the portions got consistently smaller.\n\nFurthermore, I once ate my meal inside at a table because I was hungry--the same lady got a phone call and yelled \"I GET YOU MONEY NEXT WEEK, NEXT WEEK\" loud enough for all the customers to hear. She then sat down in a table (leaving the register alone), where she pouted and barked out shrieking complaints to her cooks.\n\nAnother bone to pick--if you go through the photographs, you'll notice that user \"Daniel C.\" has some of the same pictures as those labeled as \"from business owner\", and even watermarked photos quite possibly taken fresh off the internet. I wouldn't be surprised if he's one of this lady's cronies. To top it all off, they've all been given insipid titles like \"Great choice\" and \"Love it\".\n\nI don't go to a Chinese restaurant and expect royal treatment, but I do expect the standard for a normal dining experience to be met. If you're in a pinch, grab a buffet lunch but don't expect any soup. If you've got time, head down 24th until you get to the Mission, where you can get cheaper AND tastier food given to you by much more pleasant people.", "author": "Hungry P."}

I didn't get much so I'm giving it 2 stars - one star for the rangoons I ordered that were edible and the other for making it clear that I have only tried two things on this menu so I can't write it off entirely. The rangoons I got were yummy however it would have been nice if they were still warm... The delivery took so long that the restaurant was on the verge of closing when I put my order in at 9:50pm. Almost two hours. Along with my rangoons being cold, I also ordered the crab wontons and they were extremely hard and extremely cold and extremely extremely bare. I thought I was going to crack a tooth O_O .. like I said, I can't say much about the other food on the menu, but those two things were delivered poorly. I'm sure it would have tasted better if I had them fresh. My tip for others, don't do delivery, eat there. Seems like a great place to just stop and grab something quick.", "author": "Chelsea I."}

Well for some reason, I really liked the Chinese food here.  Weird because it was definitely well seasoned, greasy, and definitely Americanized. I was definitely hungry, and the food definitely hit the spot. Grease is what you need to delay your gastric emptying and decrease bring hungry and thus snacking before dinner.  I had the chow mein, curry chicken, and broccoli beef--classic Americanized Chinese food items. Cheap and tasty.  A bit oily but good Chinese food needs oil!\n\nWok and Go is The Panda Express of the Mission. The staff are all young, speak English, and are very polite and courteous. Since they knew I was Chinese (Do I look it?) when I asked for hot sauce, they asked if I wanted chili oil (la jiao you) or chili sauce (la jiao jiang).  Props to the guy cashier who differentiated the two and offered me a choice.\n\nPlenty of SFGH patients, families, medical staff come here for lunch. It's across the streeet from Walgreens.

More like you need to Wok away from this place and Go.\n\nI was desperate for cheap Chinese food one night and decided to give Wok & Go a go. How can you go wrong with Chinese, right?\n\nWrong.\n\nI went in for take-out and it looked like the food had been sitting in the burners for god knows how long. So the girl behind the counter tried making me a deal she thought I couldn't refuse. \n\nGirl: \"I can give you 3 item for price of 2.\" \nMe: \"Um, why are you trying to sell me more food? I just want 2 items.\"\nGirl: \"It's a good deal.\"\nMe: \"Where does it say that? I can't find the sign...\"\nGirl: \"No sign, but I'll give it to you. It's good deal.\"\n\nOne thought sprung to mind: Sketchballs. \n\nI went against my better judgment and ordered anyway. I was desperate and hungry. \n\nOh and get this: So I asked her to give me half white rice and half chow mein as my side. I do this in every Panda Express style Chinese joint I go to. She said that she'd have to charge me extra for the chow mein. I'm like WHAT? You gave me a discount for 3 items and you can't even give me half and half? \n\nSo I take it home and low and behold, the food was as nasty as I thought it would be.

The woman at the register spoke practically no English, nor did she seem to be making a real effort to try and communicate with me. She had no idea what was on the menu, even though the board was right above her head. She tried to overcharge me twice, then couldn't work the credit card machine (I literally had to push the buttons for her from around the counter). \nWhile I tried to make the transaction a man complained that his fried rice was cold and hard- and it looked absolutely terrible and the woman did not care.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-12", "description": "Was disappointed. Sweet and Sour Pork was mostly just sweet with tough spots of gristle or something. Fried rice was not impressive either. It all taste like it was frozen in a bag and then thawed under a heat lamp. I've had much better within the same price range at Ken's Chinese Kitchen and you get fantastic hot/sour soup on the side; rice; and a spring roll. Not to mention its also served to you rather then counter bought..  It's on the other side of town but worth the trip.", "author": "John W."}

The place is very clean and all the workers and owner are very nice.  Excellent place to go for Chinese food.  If you don't see anything you like on display you can custom order it. What more can you ask??", "author": "Gir G."}

And I have to say that the food is pretty darn good.  The place is nice & clean and gives it a little more of a modern look than your traditional chinese restaurant.  The last good thing to say about this place is that the prices are really cheap!  $7.00 for a 3 item plate.  I will surely be back there!", "author": "Steven T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-20", "description": "I went to this new restaurant hoping that I would have a new regular place to go to get good quick food. The steam trays full of meats and veggies looked delicious so I opted for a three item combo for $7.95. I got the chicken chow mein, broccoli shrimp, kung pao chicken and lemon chicken. The nice lady who served me even threw in a free chicken egg-flower soup. \n\nI walked three blocks home and opened up the compartment tray to share my goodies with my boyfriend. I tried the chow mein first, which was average. Then I sipped the soup, which was so bland I might as well have been sipping hot water, save for the chunks of egg and chicken. The lemon flavor on the lemon chicken tasted like lemon pudding (artificial) and the kung pao was very vinegary. The broccoli shrimp was ok.\n\nBut the food was cool by the time I got home. Which makes everything taste less appealing. I've carried home food from the same general area without this problem. I wonder if the steam table is warm enough.\n\nI realize I came the second day of operation and know that there are many adjustments to be made. I may be giving this place another try in a month or so, and hopefully they've worked out the bugs in their recipes and equipment.\n\nUntil then, I'll stick to ordering delivery from Jamine Tea house when I want good Chinese food.", "author": "Megan C."}

Because they refused to allow me to use my $25 voucher that I purchased months earlier on Facebook (a tiny logo in the corner identifies this as \"KGB Deals via Facebook\"). The expiration date of December 28, 2011 was clearly printed twice on this voucher, yet the woman at the restaurant refused to accept it. She said these vouchers all expired on December 23. When I protested, saying \"how was I supposed to know that,\" she had no answer. She said the KGB person who sold them the deal won't answer their phone anymore. She then looked up the company web site and gave me two phone numbers: one in NYC and one in Bethlehem, PA. Of course, I got voicemail at both places since it was after 5pm EST. I left messages on both lines, but based on a number of online complaints I've read about KGB, I don't expect to hear back. The irony of this is that if I had been told this offer was expiring 5 days early, I could definitely have used it. After all, I've had it for months and they KNEW that I had purchased it. What a bad bad bad way to do business. Maybe this restaurant has gotten scammed by KGB, but that doesn't excuse their store personnel from offering something in exchange for my situation. Clearly, I wasn't the first person to have had this happen to. Even though I was hungry, I refused to give them any business!", "author": "Doug L."}

We liked it all, and unlike other Chinese places on 24th, the food was not greasy and it was really flavorful.  We'll go back. . .often I hope.  I do agree with other reviews that the food could be hotter.  The sesame chicken was delicious though.", "author": "Brenda B."}

My only complaint is the serving line that they serve the food from needs to be adjusted so the food is hot rather than luke warm.  The opened today (3/18/11) .  Hopefully they can get the food served hotter.", "author": "Jim H."}
