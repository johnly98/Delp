The drinks had a heavy pour(amazing!) and were delicious and given to us very prompt. For food we started with the Wings, and for the entree got burgers, Caesar salad and Asian steak salad. Be warned: The wings don't come with blue cheese. It's a blue cheese ranch mixture. The wings themselves were still very tasty. The burgers had a nice char on the edges and were cooked to perfection. The Asian salad was SO tasty and will absolutely be the reason we return here. \n\nThey have an indoor and outdoor seating. Today was warm but the outdoor seating looks like it is heated.

However, it needs to decide between being a music/dancing place and a chat with friends place. It has the set up of a place intended to grab a drink with friends but the music is insanely loud, so you have to shout to have a conversation. After being in there for an hour or two, my throat was seriously sore from talking so loud. Also, the beer selection needs to be expanded.

Instead of the traditional mozzarella, tomatoes, and basil you have ricotta, sun dried tomato, and pesto. A smart play and the flavors worked really well together. The crust was crispy but the middle couldn't hold up against the toppings but such a minor point - We just flipped the ends in and it was delicious. \n\nThe location either works for you or it doesn't.

Loved the DJ, perfect volume. Might have wanted my Jack and Diet to be even cheaper than the $8, b/c I had 3 of them and didn't feel a thing (I'm not a big guy, 150#). Cool they had food, I was hungry. Fried chicken, yes! I was anticipating dare I say, KFC style, well, fried chicken. Ok, so they were wings. There was an order, pick your sauce, with a small side, or you could get an order with each of the three sides. Guess how much the latter was. Go ahead. Ready: $20. That's before tip. I ended up paying $24 for 1/2 dozen wings, which were perfectly tasty, with a very small scoop of potato salad, and two other salads I can't remember now. Believe me, I was still hungry. $24. Was I going to make ANOTHER order of wings?? WTF. Beyond disappointed. So some really really good (it was tasty), just no other food options and my friends were already there).

We went ahead and sat outside in the patio, which had an ample amount of tables to occupy; my friend and I wilingly sat at the table next to this really pretty waterfall. Although the patio was superb, the service and food was OK.\n\nService was fine...they did their jobs and took our orders, but that was it. They weren't that friendly, no smile, no hospitality. Though, they did their job. That was it. We also wanted to ask for salsa to go with our chips, but they just swooped right passed us a couple of times. It wasn't even that crowded to be honest...and I've seen both crowded venues and great customer service and attention. Finally got a waiters attention but by raising my voice a notch. I shouldn't have to do that, since it's rude. But what goes around comes around. \n\nThe pork tacos were pretty tasty and good, but the chips had no salsa to go with it what so ever. Who gives chips without salsa??? Seriously? This is what lead to that tiny waiter fiasco. Secondly, Happy Hour tacos (on a taco Tuesday) for $2 each? That seems a bit pricey for me. I've had better tacos for $1 each in other places. Plus, free chips with salsa. Man, really? \n\nThe place also got more cold and windy, they didn't turn on the heaters. What's the point? Anyway, it was an OK venue, but what I really liked about my time here was catching up with my friend and trying something new. Inside the bar seems pretty cool, so I wouldn't mind staying there next time and trying their Happy Hour on Wednesdays, which is $5 cheese pizza.", "author": "Michelle S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-01", "description": "I've been to Mars Bar in two contexts: post-work socializing, and jury duty lunch hour. For the former, I'd give it a definite four and possibly five stars; for the latter, more like 3ish. It's been awhile since I took math, but I think four overall sounds reasonable?\n\nThis is great place for happy hour. They can easily accommodate large groups either outside on the patio or indoors, and have a decent lineup of beers as well as house cocktails. I vaguely remember a $2 Tecate special at some point, if you're able to choke down that stuff. They also have plenty of food to nibble on, though I cannot for the life of me remember what I've eaten. Maybe this means they pour the cocktails strong? \n\nRegarding lunch - I've been here twice now during my prolonged stint in jury duty. I ordered the pasta special one day (ravioli marinara), and found it quite yummy; a sandwich the other time was so-so. The quality of service is a bit capricious, and varies even during the same visit with the same server, for no apparent reason. On one visit I felt alternately like the waitress was super-friendly and attentive, or cranky and hard to track down. Weird, but whatever... I can deal. Said visits were roughly around the December \"holidays\" when many people are on vacation, so there's a fair chance that my experience was atypical (e.g. fewer waitstaff available/scheduled, fewer patrons than usual, etc). \n\nIn short, Mars Bar is a decent bet. Come for drinks, come for food. If you come during jury duty be aware that you may longingly stare at the wall of liquor, wishing you could have a beer to take the edge off the more tedious witnesses. Be strong!

Cody makes a great Manhattan, and introduced me to his Smokey Manhattan (with a 1/2 oz of Laphroaig). Definitely going to do that one again. My party all ordered burgers and everyone was thrilled with the flavor and quality. After the kitchen closed I had an opportunity to met Alfredo, the cook. I let him know that the burger was definitely one of my top 10 burgers in the city. \n\nIf you are in the neighborhood, swing by and you'll see what I'm talking about. And I think all of the bad reviews were written by angry tech-workers who want everything done at warp speeds...speaking of that, the service was fantastic and friendly, even though they were quite busy upon our arrival.", "author": "Jimbowicz J."}

Thanks to a trial run of Bert's Bees SPF 15, every single member of our outing got a rather severe sunburn.  It was a great game, with good folks, in good seats, on a beautiful day.\n\nAfterwards, we went to Mars Bar, primarily because my friend intended to celebrate Sonic's 20th birthday with others who were similarly invested in Sonic's once-and-future success.  In our small group of 20 or so hard core geeks, I managed to bump into no fewer than 2 former Wyomingites, so we got to commiserate about the very best decision we ever made in our entire lives (maybe I'm projecting....).\n\nThe service was decent, the prices were awesome, the bar didn't care that we imported enough food to provision an expeditionary force (including cupcakes with Sonic's face on them).

The place was full so we grabbed three stools at the bar, pretty much dead center in the middle of it.\n\nWe ordered our drinks and then asked for a kitchen menu. After we had figured out what we wanted (and closed our menus) it took about twenty minutes before the bartender even took our order. People kept asking to borrow our menus and somehow were able to order before us.\n\nThe drinks were pretty good. I had a few margaritas, they were 6$ (that may be a special as it was a Saturday) for a full beer glass full of margarita. I wouldn't say it was special but it was definitely a good standard and I enjoyed drinking them. \n\nThey clearly weren't equipped to handle the traffic from the craft fair, as we waited over an hour and a half for our food. At that point, the three of us each had had at least two drinks, so we were drunk on an empty stomach which only made it worse. Our bartender took our order and from what we could gather, never put a ticket in to the kitchen.(She never admitted it, though; just said that the kitchen was \"slammed.\" When our order came out, it was all wrong - we got a salad instead of a sandwich and my quesadilla was lacking the meat I ordered in it, which all leads me to believe she forgot to put it in and then was too embarrassed to ask us to repeat it after realizing.) Another one of the bartenders responded to our complaint and checked on the order and it was still another 1/2 hour before we got our food. (She was nice enough to equip us with some bar snacks. Appreciated.) When the manager found out, he comped us our food and apologized, which we all also appreciated. \n\nThe food was slightly above average bar food - I had a quesadilla and the side of pico that came with it was salty and had a nice amount of heat to it. We had wings that were okay, and the nachos with carnitas were also just okay. My friend's salad was topped with steak (she had ordered the steak sandwich) that was really tasty and cooked to a nice medium rare. Overall, nothing special, but definitely not greasy bar food like you would expect - nice.\n\nI liked the music and despite all their errors I was still cheering this place on. Bartenders and management were friendly - and also to his tribute, we saw the manager jump in to the kitchen to try to help the chef out once he figured what was going on. I appreciate that he was willing to get his hands dirty to help the situation and make his customers happy.\n\nI'd be back if there isn't anything going on at the convention center and they aren't swamped. Seems like it would normally be a nice chill place for a Saturday afternoon. Also liked that they had the doors open so you got some sunshine.\n\nI think this place would normally be 3 stars - just ok - but due to the service problems I really can't give them that rating.", "author": "Rachel B."}

The place was slightly busy, but not packed.  We sat down and the waitress came over and asked us if we wanted drinks.  We ordered drinks and she returned with them in a few minutes.  However, when she delivered the drinks, she told us that she would come back in a few minutes to take our order.  STRIKE ONE- she didn't ask us if we were ready to order.  After a few minutes passed, I looked for the waitress and noticed that she was delivering food to other tables, taking orders, talking to other customers, and spoke on the phone for a few minutes.  STRIKE TWO - She didn't acknowledge the extra long wait.  A simply \"sorry about the wait\" would have gone a long way.  We received our food in a fairly decent time, and when the food arrived it was pretty tasty.  As we ate, she didn't check on the table to see if we needed anything until we were almost finished with our meal.  When she did arrive, she asked the only male at the table if he wanted a refill even though all of us were in need of a refill.  STRIKE THREE - I know that some waitress try and appeal to males to get bigger tips, and this waitress is one of them.  With her bottle hair color, she is there to cater to the males, but do not ignore the women at the table.  After we finished our meal, we had to go out of our way to flag her down for the bill and it took even longer for her to return and charge the card for our meal.  STRIKE FOUR - it shouldn't take that much work for us to get the bill and pay.  \n\nI gave 1 star for the food.  The service was some of the worst I ever received. This is the first time that I refused to leave my customary 20% tip.  Maybe the waitress will learn that women are customers too.  \n\nI will not be coming back and next time I will go to a bar where a female customer can get a refill.", "author": "Gabrielle W."}

Now, I'm not saying you'll write home about the food, but really - who does that anyway?  \n\nIs this place considered divey? I don't think so, but maybe...? I would suggest that it's on the distant fringe of divey, but then again my divey expectations are based on Philly standards.  \n\nIt's definitely worth checking out Mars Bar out if you're in the neighborhood and looking for somewhere to eat/drink outside and not spend a ton of money.", "author": "Stephanie F."}

My fav is their ceasar salad (light on dressing) with beef or grilled chicken. You can also get it with Ahi Tuna and a couple of other kinds of meat. My other favorite is their Chicken Fiesta Salad. It's a big crazy in there with all the ingredients, but they all go really well together. \n\nOh and also - don't order the salads togo with dressing on the side.

The third is an outside area with tables for people to get some fresh air. Both times I didn't pay cover because I was either on a guest list or it was a weekday.

It's a nice joint for those looking to get out of the house, sit back and have a drink.\n\nMars Bar feels like a retrofitted house. I don't think they even have a sign. Keep a look out for solid red circles and metal doors. The floor plan is similar to a capital \"U.\" The first leg is the bar area the entire bar area with seating. The second leg is the small dance floor. Adjacent to the second leg is an outdoor area with tables and outdoor heaters. The outdoor area is fairly large and can seat about sixty people if you really pack it. There's no music here so you can actually have a conversation.\n\nI couldn't drink that night so I really can't comment. I hear the drinks aren't bad. The dj for the night wasn't good.

I love this place. The barstaff and owner are efficient and friendly and awfully good looking. Drinks are generous and high-octane. There are three, count 'em, THREE bars, meaning you're bound to get a drink regardless of how packed the place is. \n\nThere is a front room with a large bar, booths, and tables for dancing on (says me). There is a room next door with a pool table and a bar. If you dance on the pool table, the owner may buy you a shot. There is also a big, huge patio with 180 horsepower heat lamps (you will NOT be cold and you may break a sweat), lots of greenery, and an adorable outdoor bar. This is the ideal place to sip (pound) your cocktails and stare at your love with stars (broken blood vessels) in your eyes. If you're single, this could also be a great place to pick up a cute-ish drunk boy. There are a lot of them and there was a hell of a lot of eyefucking going on both times I was there.\n \nMars is a great place to hang out and imbibe.

Great cozy space, with 3 areas to hang out in: a bar/restaurant, a dance floor, and an open air patio. I loved that the patio had huge heat lamps overhead that kept us warm during the chilly night and allowed us to cool off when the dance floor got too stuffy. The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and the bartenders kept the drinks fairly priced and flowing (a little too much for this lightweight). At 9pm, the kitchen closed, but they were cool enough to let some friends bring in outside food.

Once again, dragging me away from my dive bar safety net. When I walked in through the solid-looking metal doors (which reminded me of the Endup, sending a quiver of fear down my spine as I anticipated the scene unfolding in front of me) - I was a little surprised. It's a bar. It's not upmarket, it's not dive, it, well, hovers between the two. \n\nBar measures were reasonable and not too killer - but there seemed to be only one barman serving - on a Saturday night... which swiftly became busy. It became a mission of plan ahead - get halfway down and buy another drink - 20mins later, and the rest of your drink gone, your frequent flier miles have gone up and the unlucky person who went to the bar has a 50/50 chance of actually making it back with a fresh order. \n\nI do have to clap my hands in congratulation to the Mars Bar for having the best outdoor patio in town. Not only is it decorated in multicoloured lighting (for a drunk person, great! So many things to focus on), there is an outdoor bar and the fattest overhead heater I have ever seen. It looked like some industrial battery farm heater with a heating coil as thick as a soda can. Looked like it was solid - and the heat emanating from it was fantastic. Even better - for a blustery cold night, the patio was completely protected on 3 sides, so you barely noticed a thing. \n\nThere was plenty of seating last night - oddly - the majority of people preferred to stand in the middle between the bar and the seating area - which is fine by me, just seemed strange - like they knew something we didn't. And one last gripe - the music, which was at a reasonable level when we came in went sky-high halfway into the night - so much so it was turned down (I guess we were not the only ones deafened). Seeing as this wasn't a bar with a dance area, it did seem a little incongruous to have such loud music in a bar clearly made for chilling, talking and drinking. Saying that, it did resort us to falling back to the good old 'Name That Tune'  game, which I guess is something.", "author": "Catriona C."}

Or me. The door guy and the bartenders are all pretty cool. The music early in the evenings is usually an eclectic mix spiced up with mid-70's funk. \n\nAfter eleven things pick up - people start pouring in and usually a DJ will start livening things up with some tasty house music. \n\nI really like the vibe here -- it's easy to talk to people, the drinks are strong, and hell, any place in this town with a half-decent outdoor area gets good marks from me . .", "author": "Karsten P."}

There's a lot of laid back beer drinkers so that inevitably means talking with the women and flirting with them(compliments attention etc) to get them to buy drinks.\n\nSurprisingly Mar's is not a bad place for this type of promo, which makes me think underneath all girl need a little socializing from another supposedly hot female, or perhaps it says something about mars' popularity among bisexual females, or maybe it's just SF in general, I really don't know enough to say for sure.\n\nA guy let me take a few sip of his mojitos. Being an afaciando of latin drinks I give thumb's up for the mojitos at mar's.  The bartenders do make solid drinks, although it's funny cuz sometimes we have really funky drink specials and we have to hold the signs to make sure bartenders know what we are asking them to make.\n\npeople who gather at bars tend to be more social about talking to strangers, while people in the back patio(very nice by the way!) keep to themselves.  Food is very good there, surprisingly esp since I don't expect good food in bars at all.\n\nbeautiful lemon drops as well.  I bartend private parties so I pay attention to drinks when I go out. They serve it in a martini glass with a solid bottom that's round, which probably makes it harder to knock over.  Do NOT try to order a martini or anything that needs to be shaked on the backup bar, I beg you.  The more complicated stuff it's always a good idea to ask at the main bar.\n\nMojitos are pretty and the crowd at Mar's are to, in my experience the patrons tend to congregate around the 30's crowd.  The happy hours are very happening given the time of day.  easy parking, what can I say?  Part of living in SF taught me the joy of appreciating seemingly mundane things like finding parking spot, something my SJ friends fail to grasp.\n\nwe end up giving the red feather boa we used for the promo to an older gentleman, who wore it with pride.  welcome to SF, it's not mar's but you won't know when you are in Mar's bar.", "author": "Jamie L."}

But yesterday I was actually meeting with a volunteer marketing committee to drink lots of wine, no I mean to plan a fund raising dinner for HRC, whatever. \n\n Well I was stuck downtown with an hour to kill. I walked from the Mall (YUCK) to the concourse exhibition center.  I thought about going into Annie's for a beer, I thought about going into Folsom Gulch for some slurp and jerk, but I decided to just keep going.  Then I saw Catalyst and no that wasn't right either.   \n\nFinally I saw Mars.  It looked clean.  It had windows.  There was a decent crowd inside for 6:30pm and I went for it.  After sitting at the bar I noticed there is another room with tables and beyond that a sunny, crowded patio.  It was pretty chill and comfortable.  The bartenders were all cute, the boys and the girls, and friendly.  A Newcastle it is!\n\nThen the guys next to me start talking to some guy Keith who looks crazy familiar.  I know I know him from somewhere.  Well he was busy with work stuff and I had a beer so I just started texting ravers from my past.  No one could come up with the Keith that I think I know but we remembered tons of crazy Keiths.  Then some freestyle beats come on followed up by quite a few good house tracks.  Then it hits me.  I used to see this dude at parties back in the day.  Don't know if I ever actually knew him.  \n\nMoral of the story is - I really liked sitting across from the venue that I spent many crazy nights in the mid 90s in dropping pills, smoking weed and dancing to some of the best house music ever (do you remember The Gathering, Organic and the others?) - in a chill bar with cool peeps around passing time til my next philanthropic endeavor.", "author": "Ian M."}

The inside bar atmosphere is everything you would want in a chill bar with out being a dive or dirty, the outside patio is great on a nice day or relaxing at night with heaters that over hang and cover the entire patio instead of just small sections, so no need to huddle together to stay warm in the lovely SF weather. They also add a second patio in the summer where the side parking lot is by encasing the drive way off with planter boxes, it makes for more space and more sun when everyone wants to be outside. The staff is lively, entertaining and personable, Amber by for is one of the funniest bartenders I have met, but everyone of the crew is just as great. The food is awesome for bar food, they change their menu for time to time and also add daily specials, vegetarian options are decent and your not afraid to dive in when sitting at the bar.

I felt this was a good opportunity to really study the place, instead of spending my time fighting to get a drink at the bar and weaving through an inebriated crowd.\n\nThe decor is simple and somewhat industrial.  The place is relatively small with a cozy vibe.  It could easily be a \"neighborhood bar\" if it weren't attempting to go for the whole trendy nightlife scene.  The outdoor patio area is a nice touch.  The bartender, Christopher, makes a mean mojito, and certainly wins my personal Dave Grohl impersonation contest that everyone unwittingly enters.\n\nOverall, good drinks, good music, good times.  The place was dead last Friday night, but I'm all about having the whole bar to myself, so mark that as a big plus in my book.  I'll definitely be back, all things considered.", "author": "Rajiv B."}

People were pleasant, a nice mix of moms, dudes, techies and us!  Good selection of beers and bourbons, well stocked bar.  I like a place that has pear cider on tap!  We ordered roast beef sandwich, portobello burger, fries and the new england clam chowder.  Everything was tasty, clam chowder was excellent with lots of fresh clams and carefully chopped bits of potatoes, ham, and carrots, could've had a quart of that with some sourdough and been happy for days.

I had driven by it at least 1000 times but I never felt like actually going into the seemingly non descript bar on the corner of 7th and Brannan. I had heard of people talk about this place a couple of years ago before I lived in SOMA. \n\n\nWell if you live in the city and you ave experienced the last few days of unseasonably warm and fantastic weather well then you probably like I have been in a desperate attempt to find killer outdoor patios that let the sun in but shield the wind. Mars' outdoor patio performs. As I was sitting outside I noticed that there is also a VERY LARGE heater above you so that it probably performs as a fantastic patio eve in the evening. The bar is a bar and all bars are the same, booze and beer, the bar food is above average for bar fare here in the city. I would put it on par with other fantastic bar grub that I have been tasting lately, reviews to follow. All this would usually lead to 4 stars. I reserve 5 stars for joints that really outperform the competition or if I have A LOT of fun at a place. I had a lot of fun yesterday... \n\n\nNewcastle was doing a promotion there and Newcastle was 3 bucks a pint which is a good deal, and they were giving away glasses, not the kind you wear but the kind that you drink beer from. That is awesome. I love free shit. I ordered Newcastle and the wife ordered Newcastle and we chatted and were having a real good time. But that wasn't what made it fun, something else made it a lot more fun than it should have been. \n\n\nI've lived here for a while and and there is always some beer or booze company doing something somewhere, like when the Camel Cigarette girls would walk around and give away free cigarettes. Man I wish they still did that. Well you know how these girls are they are semi good looking dressed a little bit more proactively than they would usually dress they walk around give away free shit smile and I guess that is their job... Pretty good gig if you can get it I guess. \nThey gave us free glasses and they also gave us $1 coupons for future purchases of Newcastle. Score. So we were drinking our Newcastles and we were done and we were waiting for our check and the Newcastle Girl comes back and says \"OK we'll be taking your $1 coupons now the promotion is over\" \n\n\nUnbeknownst to her I had read the \"coupon\" and it wasn't a coupon at all. Instead it was a $1 dollar check to \"ANY RETAILER THAT SELLS NEWCASTLE\" redeemable until 12/3/2010. Knowing this I knew tat this check was invaluable so I wanted to keep it. I like Newcastle, and if I can get $1 off well then that's nothing short of fantastic. She briefly tried to argue with me until she found that I am an obstinate son of a bitch and she wasn't taking my coupon back. \n\n\nAnd that is why my experience at Mars was so good. I deal with idiots all day everyday at wok and I'm sure that many of you reading this do as well. Many times you are not in a position in a place of business to actually point out someones idiocracy to their face, although that would would make everyday at work 5 stars for me, it is not beneficial usually to your continued employment. But this woman who I would assume has gotten by on her limited attractiveness her whole life, found herself defeated by a relatively fat and unattractive dude that was just a little bit smarter than her. was thinking that maybe she gets paid for every coupon she gives out and then gets double paid if she gets them back... I don't know... However I will say that it was one of the best human exchanges I have had in a while. \n\n\nI had a teacher that one time told me that studying and doing well on an exam is one of life's simple pleasures. I didn't do that well in school and wasn't interested in what they were selling, however I will say that pointing out idiocracy to a person who is in fact a bona-fide idiot is one of life's simple pleasures and one that I enjoy, maybe a little too much.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

The bartenders were polite and attentive, and they weren't shy with sharing their alcohol.  The crowd that night was pretty ecclectic - but when I got there after midnight, only 5 people were dancing.  It picked up (the booty shaking), then it got all meat market-y.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-06-21", "description": "this used to be a hidden gem in SOMA with plenty of parking, tv screens playing 'adult films', an outdoor patio with heatlamps, and a pool table. the best part was the root beer float - a pint size glass of bailey's, root beer, and vanilla stoli. delicious.\n\nbut this place has sucked the past few times - once they were playing some sort of trance/electronica music and the bartender didn't know how to make the root beer float (even though it was on the menu!). and the second time they were still playing the bad music, and this time we had to pay a $5 cover charge - when we protested that we had never had to pay before, they said \"we provide you with a dj playing great music,\" by which i have to assume he meant the trance/electronica. \n\nbut i had such a great time the first few times i went, i will still give them four stars.", "author": "Lisa M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-20", "description": "OK, I am totally biased because I practically live here at Mars and have for years. Over the last 8 years I've seen this place go through so many changes and it still manages to be a great place to hang out. While location (1 block from work) allows me the convenience to frequent the bar as often as I like, its the bartenders, staff, and atmosphere that keeps me coming back. They have a knack for hiring the right kind of people and it really makes this place special.  The outdoor patio and Godzilla sized heat lamp make this a very cozy place. It can get quite crowded, so its best to get there earlier rather than later. If I see you there, and you were there first, I apologize in advance for stealing your chair ;)", "author": "Tony D."}

It could apply to this Mars bar place too (albeit any bar).  Their long happy hours all week long would definitely help make my work week seem shorter.  The food is decent and people are friendly enough.  However, the jukebox is dysfunctional and expect service to be SLOW.", "author": "Naomi N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-08-08", "description": "Like Lisa M., I stumbled on this place while it was still in its hidden gem, pre-dot.com years phase. I have fond memories (as well as great recent experiences) of its drinks, the mixed crowd, the fries, the clams and other eats...and that irresistable but oh-so rare-now-in-SF combo of no attitude folks out to have fun. That's right, fun, actual fun! Had a few CD/CD-ROM release parties here too...\n\nBut the cover charge... say it isn't so... cover charges are the first step on the road hell and no fun so let's hope that they go away... and frankly, no offense to their profession, I personally don't think that DJs ADD to the vibe of a cool little place. I much prefer cool mixes from the barkeep/waitstaff and loyal habitues. (If I wanted a 'DJ experience,' I'd go to DNA or whatever. (Okay: I'll be honest here: I almost NEVER want a DJ experience, except at a private party when the DJ is a friend...) \n\nSo I'm minusing one star 'cause of the DJ.", "author": "caitlin c."}

Laid-back crowd and it's a lot bigger than it appears from the outside.  2 rooms plus an outdoor patio with heat lamps to keep patrons warm and also where you can smoke while having a few drinks!  went there for happy hour and ordered dinner entrees too.  will go back again and again!", "author": "Mich C."}
