Lucky for us, there was no wait, and we were immediately seated at the counter seats by the window.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the masantol and ulsan. The masantol (filipino style spicy sizzling tofu) was tasty and had a nice kick to it. The ulsan (pajeon/korean pancake) was soft and eggy. I prefer pajeon to be thicker and crispier, so the ulsan was just okay for me. I probably wouldn't order these side trips again.\n\nAs for mains, we ordered the lanzhou, havana and san marino. The lanzhou (egg noodles topped with ahi tuna) was very flavorful. The noodles were perfectly soft and chewy, but the ahi tuna had a bit too much pepper for our taste. The havana (Cuban fried rice) had a perfect blend of spices and was very enjoyable. The san marino risotto was also delicious, with the bacon and sweet gorgonzola providing a lot of rich flavor. I didn't care for the panko-crusted chicken on top though.\n\nI'll definitely be back soon to try more of their menu.\n\nQuick tips:\n- The menu is seasonal!\n- Don't come with a large group. There are only 3 tables for 2 and about 10 counter seats.\n- Takeout is a popular option here!", "author": "Leanne C."}

It was a large portion, but I wound up finishing it all. \n\nThe only negative is how small the place was. I sat right near the exit and it felt very cramped.

I shared two dishes with a girlfriend, the lanzhou and koh samui. They are willing to split dishes here for an extra $1 per dish, but it's totally worth it as it was more than enough food for the both of us; I almost felt they gave us our own personal sized dish or that their portions are big enough for two meals! The Lanzhou has probably been my all-time favorite here; egg noodles fried in ginger, scallion and garlic topped with peppered ahi tuna! It's one of the more expensive dishes but it's soo worth trying. The koh samui is a coconut curry with chicken, eggplant, squash, served with jasmine rice which was super tasty. I'd recommend these two dishes if you have a palette for thai flavors, otherwise they offer other dishes with other southeast asian twists (filipino, malaysian) or non-asian (italian, cuban)\n\nI've never seen a wait here but the restaurant is tiny; there are very cozy bar/window seating and a couple of two-seater settings.

I wasn't sure what to expect but I decided to stop and check out the menu in the window. \n\nThe menu selection is small but that did not defer me away from coming here. I walked on in and immediately found myself right in the middle of this place. The other reviews are not lying when they say that this place is TINY! There are a FEW tables, window seating, and a counter seating area. Limited seating makes for close encounter for lunch if this place gets packed. I would estimate maximum capacity is maybe 20 - 25, I'm being generous!\n\nI had hoped that there was a lunch menu that differed from the window menu but it is the same. Once I was seated I glanced over the menu one more time and then made a decision, I was really hungry. I ordered the manila dinner.\n\nWhen the food finally arrived I went to town on this food. I was more excited for the Chinese sausage that comes in this meal. The pancit was very good. The chicken was cooked really well but there was not a lot of shrimp in this meal, that was unfortunate. The overall meal was not what a good reflection of the price or portion of the meal. I felt like I was missing a side salad or soup to go along with my meal. I think that would've made a HUGE difference for me in coming here. A side salad or soup INCLUDED would've been great. I was not going to pay an additional fee for either, just to be clear.\n\nThe cost of the meal was $12.50 if this helps in anyway, be advised. \n\nI honestly feel like this place has so much potential but it needs to expand more. Th expansion of the menu and the incorporation of a lunch menu could do wonders for this place, especially with the prime location.\n\nParking around this area is EXTREMELY terrible so expect to circle for awhile or take public transit.\n\nMy midday chow down could've been better, oh well.", "author": "Robert F."}

That says a lot for two ladies who absolutely love dining out in San Francisco. \n\nMy favorite part about this place was not the food, the atmosphere or being able to watch every single dish freshly prepared and cooked. All of those things were amazing, but not why I'm giving this place a huge 5 star review (can I give it 10?!). My favorite part was Nelson, the part owner of this amazing place. As soon as my mom and I walked in, Nelson greeted us with a huge smile and sat us at the bar area (where we were able to watch the amazing chef in action). During our entire dining experience, Nelson would come by to our table and make sure we were doing okay. After our meal, he gave my mom a huge hug, which made my mom even more happier and inclined to come back. She literally can't wait. A huge thank you to Nelson, we will see you soon!!\n\nNow, lets critique the food. I am an extremely picky eater (sorry to everyone that has to eat out with me) and I can manage to eat more than half of this menu. It's extremely veggie and seafood friendly. It's also one of the most eclectic menu's that I've seen in San Francisco. Food varies from Thai, to Mexican, to Philippino, to Japanese to American to.... I can go on and on. My mom and I shared the special of the day (fresh wild snapper with spinach, wild mushrooms and barley) and the soba noodles with tofu. We also ordered the bread (which my mom begged not to) but then was so happy that we did because she used every last piece to soak up the yummy sauces from our plates. We literally devoured each and every bite and if we could lick the plate, we would (if only that was appropriate...)! \n\nMy other favorite part about this place was watching the chef prepare and cook all of the meals. You can just tell how much passion he has for cooking. There was something so relaxing about it too. My mom sipped her wine and I could tell just how relaxed she was, which made me so happy. If you come here, get a table at the bar - you won't regret it!\n\nTip: Get their homemade hot sauce - absolutely amazing. \n\nAll in all, this place deserves more than 5 stars.

First impression: this place is SMALL! Maybe 8 seated around the counter overlooking the cooking/prep are (very Benihana-styled, intentionally or not), and then 12 or so available seats at tables. Felt cramped, but I guess that's not uncommon for some smaller restaurants in San Francisco. \n\nPomelo is located very close to UCSF, with only street parking available. We were fortunate to have arrived before the lunch rush, as we found parking across the street, and pretty much all other open tables were taken by the time we were midway through our lunch.\n\nThe server was very kind and extremely professional. The chefs were efficient and quick. It was actually very enjoyable to watch them do their thing and prepare the dishes.\n\nThe 'gist' of Pomelo is almost like asking you \"WHERE do you want to eat today?\" Their appetizers and main plates are based off locales, such as the Koh Samui (Thai-based chicken dish) or Manila (essentially Filipino noodles known as \"Pancit\"). It didn't feel like a typical \"let's try and cover every genre\" restaurant: it felt more like they perfected specific dishes from different regions and made that their offering. When I say perfected, I mean it. Our group each ordered different dishes, and they were all outstanding. A personal surprising favorite of mine was the Polenta cakes appetizer, which when mixed with the included sauce, made your eyes pop and go \"whoah.\" It was a great combination of both textures and flavors that I would definitely love to experience again. \n\nI would absolutely recommend Pomelo to everyone.

For the appetizer, we ordered the grilled fish taco, which was topped with a good amount of shredded cabbage and served with a mango relish and pickled jalapenos. While I've had better tacos, the tastiest part of the dish was the grilled fish, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We then split two items for our main course. The Lanzhou, the stir-fried noodles with ahi tuna, was very, very garlicky; the egg noodles were a little bit heavy for my taste, but the ahi tuna was perfectly seared and so tasty and peppery--this was some of the most flavorful tuna I've had! We also split the Havana, a Cuban fried rice, with the skirt steak on top. I was very impressed with the skirt steak, which was still pink on the inside and surprisingly tender (not typical for this kind of steak!).

Restaurant is pretty small as it fits less than 20 people, but during lunch, it's a great place to get in and get out quickly.\n\nOriginally, I was going to order Asian food, but then at the last minute, I decided to order the Cabo San Lucas, which were 2 grilled fish tacos.  It was off their side menu, but for me, it was an entree.  It came with shredded cabbage, mango salsa, some spicy sauce, and pickled jalape\u00f1os which were pretty spicy as well.  Simple food, but real intense flavors.\n\nMy husband had the Nan which was their Thai-style congee and that was delicious too!  I would have been happy with that dish as well.

I've lived just down the block for almost 35 years and have passed this place a lot yet never stopped in, it always looked so tiny but today my friend met me for lunch here.  First, the place is small as others have said but, hey, I can pick up delicious food and go home, take off my shoes and eat.  All the staff we met were friendly and courteous, not overly attentive, just right.  Food was good.  I had the Manila, which reminded me slightly of pancit, but enhanced!  Enough fresh, lovely vegs, had shrimp, had slices of sausage (not really necessary but there anyway), in a sauce I can't figure out or I'd start making this for ourselves all the time.  I couldn't finish it all so they boxed it and I've got it in the frig for tomorrow lunch.  My friend had the dish with fried tofu and soba noodles.  She doesn't eat hoofed animals, and I don't eat wheat but we found enough on the menu to have to  go \"gee, which should I choose??? They all sound so good!\"  I didn't even notice there was dessert, but I don't eat dessert either so I didn't look.  They let us sit and talk too, hogging our table (If we'd seen lots of people lining up to get in, we would have removed ourselves).  I'll be back so I can order all the other things on the various menus.  They choose their vegetables wisely, everything is so fresh (crunchy snow peas in winter), flavors are not overpowering yet significantly there, combinations seem to work.

This location only had lunch and dinner and quite different hours. \n\nI had the Lanzhou, which was Ahi tuna seared with garlic noodles. There was some ginger and other spices as well. The tuna was seasoned quite well and had nice texture and seared almost perfectly. The noodles were also cooked well and not overly salty. My only complaint would be the food was piping hot temperature wise. I also tried a bit of the coconut curry and it was quite creamy, but still had good Southeast Asian flavors. I think this dish did burn my tongue. \n\nBesides the food being too hot (and the restaurant being warm inside too), this place has a nice variety of dishes from vegetarian to meat and features a lot of cool flavor mixes from around the world.

I enjoyed it and it reminds me a little of Singapore curry noodles. \n\nThere is no AC and the seating is limited.

A minute later, a gentleman runs up and unlocks the door and holds it open for us. He is very soft spoken and apologizes for being slightly late. \n\nThis is a very tiny place, but very cozy and intimate. It was well lit. We were given menus and water. \n\nWe ordered:\n+ Lanzhou - $16 - fresh egg noodles stir fried with ginger, scallion and garlic, with peppered ahi tuna, seared rare and topped with a miso-sesame drizzle. \n++ This dish was very delicious. The flavours came together well, it was nice and garlicky. The scallions and ginger really brightened this dish up in terms of flavour. The ahi tuna was a huge chunk sear rare. Very delicious.\n\n+ aosta - $8.5 - baked polenta and gourmet mushroom rag\u00f9 with madeira and cream. \n++ This dish was very cream heavy. Due to the heaviness, it can essentially be a meal on its own as you'll feel quite bloated after. Overall, it was a decent dish. Pretty much fried cornmeal with a heavy gravy sauce. Not my favourite.\n\nWe were not rushed at all, water was a bit slow to be refilled, but it was eventually without asking. This is a cute little place with fairly large entrees. The food was definitely good, and since we sat at the bar, we watched other foods get made. Definitely want to try more of their menu!\n\nBy the end of our meal, the whole restaurant was filled up and we were having a hard time hearing each other.

Perhaps there was a pomelo tree that previously grew in the plot of land the restaurant sits on.\n\nWait, do pomelos even grow on trees?\n\nMy Cal-to-UCSF friend and I visited on a Sunday evening. We were fortunate that at 6:30 PM, the small 16-seat restaurant was not that crowded, but it definitely picked up around 7 PM.\n\nPomelo's menu is comprised of an Asian fusion dish from pretty much every single imaginable Asian cuisine, which doesn't make selection easy. Fortunately, my friend's dietary preferences narrowed us down to our two dishes that we shared.\n\nWe ordered the OTSU, which is a cold buckwheat noodle salad with cucumber, scallion, cilantro, and a spicy soy/ginger/sesame dressing, topped with pan saut\u00e9ed tofu, $11 (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W_vy9nARtzE3rGnDkp6keA/l.jpg). This was my friend's preferred dish, as the tofu is filling and the cucumber is fresh and generous. The cold buckwheat noodles are topped with cilantro and sesame seeds, which is a pleasing combo, but I found the noodles to be too sesame oily.\n\nMy preferred dish was the LANZHOU, which is fresh egg noodles stir fried with ginger, scallion and garlic, with peppered ahi tuna, seared rare and topped with a miso-sesame drizzle, $16 (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Y2EZW_j5BgZJYl5MqEdhlw/l.jpg). Egg noodles are so comforting, and that miso-sesame drizzle is addictive. The mellow, textured ahi tuna is a perfect complement to the tanginess of the sauce. And the best part? The fried lotus root slices. The best crunchy topping ever :)\n\nThe total was $17 per person, which was fitting for the enjoyable meal we had. I later found out that the waitress mixed up our receipts when billing our credit cards, but after contacting the people-in-charge, it seems like it's not a common practice :)\n\nAnd yes, pomelos do grow on trees.

I had never had Asian fusion cuisine quite like what is offered at Pomelo on Judah Street. \n\nIt is just a little place yet the food and the service is five-star all the way. If you like Asian style food and an eclectic mix of flavors, then Pomelo is for you. \n\nEven the beverages have a fused flavor. I had the fresh ginger and lemongrass iced tea. Wow, that was yummy! I also had in addition to my entr\u00e9e, a bowl of the most outstanding miso soup. It was of course a fusion of more than just the traditional miso, that to me was a meal in itself. Very delicious! \n\nIt is important to note that patrons should ask about the dishes before ordering. I say this because as I read some of the yelp comments before going to Pamelo for the very first time, several people were not as pleased as they had anticipated. \n\nWhat I surmised about that was the type of fusion and the way the chef prepares it. For example, if you want the beef cooked a bit more, then just ask for it to be cooked a bit longer. And, if your palate does not like certain mixes of foods like shrimp and chicken, then try something else. I think, that might have been why there were some critical reviews on the list. \n\nYet as for me, the food was outstanding! It is a very small place and seating is limited. Chairs are not that comfortable. Next time, I will order take out. It is a little pricey, but for the type of high quality and unique flavors, it is worth it. Also, service is outstanding.

He bumped my husband's empty beer bottle against the glass light fixture hanging above our table, breaking the fixture.\n\nGlass shattered and went everywhere - onto the table, onto the floor, inside my (not yet empty) wine glass, and onto my lap. The server apologized, asked if we were alright, and promptly whisked away the bill and came back with a wet towel to begin cleaning up the glass shards.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-16", "description": "I'm really confused about how to rate Pomelo because I typically give out stars based on how often I would come back. 3 stars means I would go here if I were in the area, whereas 4 stars warrants about a half hour drive/wait.\n\nI've only been to Pomelo twice in the past 1.5 years and I live a block away (granted, Pomelo is on the hill nowhere near the UCSF parking building's elevators that I take to get to Irving, and I hate walking up and down hills). Both times were takeout and the food was truly tasty. I am a fan of their noodle dishes the most, especially the Manila, which is a wondrously fragrant Filipino-style pancit sauteed with prawns, chicken, sweet Chinese sausage, and vegetables. Another favorite is the Lanzhou, with its thick hand-pulled egg noodles, stir-fried with loads of garlic and oil. The non-vegetarian option comes with grilled ahi, which I found to be not fresh; I'd recommend sticking with veggies and tofu for this dish. As for an appetizer, we always get the Ulsan (seafood Korean pancakes), which comes with embedded jalapenos and is tongue-numbingly spicy. The pancakes are perfectly eggy, with soft centers and crispy sides, but I do wish the seafood would be less fishy. I have a feeling that fish/seafood may not be Pomelo's forte.\n. \nI'm not a fan of the prices here but I can understand paying this much for fusion cuisine. However, the main reason why I can't in good conscience give Pomelo 4 stars is because I find the food wayyyy too salty. As in I need to continually guzzle down water/tea for the next 4 hours after my meal kind of salty. My husband felt the same way and he's much less sensitive to salt than I am. Still, if you're in the area and craving some Asian noodles with a twist, Pomelo is a great choice if you don't mind the extra sodium!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

I had the curry chicken, which was sweet instead of spicy but still quite delicious. My wife had the beet salad, which we agreed didn't quite come together - good idea but incomplete. It may have been better with grilled chicken but I doubt it. The real star was the appetizer, a Korean pancake with shellfish, which was incredible. Highly recommended! \n\nThe ambience was okay when we got there, but after some other parties showed up and the kitchen got busy, it was too loud for us to talk comfortably, so we just eavesdropped on the locals and enjoyed our food. Not bad but I liked it more when it was quiet. \n\nThe penalty is because they charged for water. This is bad enough in itself, but they didn't mention it and charged quite a lot for it - we ended up paying nice dollars for our water, which is almost as much as an entree! This is a pretty serious issue in my opinion! But yours may vary.", "author": "Richard R."}

CAme here on a Tuesday night and it wasn't extremely busy. My friend and I got a seat at the bar overlooking the chef cook our dishes. \n\nTried: Havana, This polenta appetizer and  this noodle dish. All three were delicious! My favorite was probably the polenta appetizer it was grilled and tasted so good when it was drenched in the cream sauce with mushrooms its a winning combination. Then for Havana my friend thought the plantains were on the side but they were part of the fried rice. It was a unique fried rice but she enjoyed it for the most part except for the plantains. The noodle dish I had, had thick noodles with seared tuna. It was so flavorful and tasty I loved every bit of it!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-29", "description": "Pomelo on Judah serves very interesting fusion food, where the name of the dish is related to where the food originates. The menu changes seasonally, so there's a bit of rotation and variety. The restaurant opens for both lunch and dinner (but only dinner on weekends), and when available, lunch options are about $1-2 cheaper than dinner options. Located on Judah St rather than Irving St (where most restaurants are located), Pomelo isn't very crowded. The restaurant is small, but has a casual-intimate feel to it.\n\nKoh Samui --\nA dish that truly feels like comfort food. It comes with spicy curry, chicken, beans, eggplants, squash, and mushrooms served with very fragrant jasmine rice. The entree was portioned fairly, with the bowl being half rice and half curry. The coconut milk-based curry was very thick, rich, creamy, and filling. The white chicken meat was a little tough and chewy, and the beans had an unappealing, rubbery texture. However, the squash and mushrooms were really good and the curry itself was overall very flavorful.\n\nLanzhou -- \nA popular item that was truly disappointing for me! This dish consists of two main ingredients: seared ahi tuna and egg noodles. The noodles were cooked with plenty of fresh garlic and ginger, but I could only taste the ginger. The tuna was coated with freshly ground black pepper and seared nicely, but there weren't a lot of pieces. The entree was topped with a miso sesame dressing, that I hardly tasted as well. This dish doesn't have many components, so I got tired of it very quickly. It was a forgettable dish and I wouldn't order it again.\n\nThe teeny tiny restaurant seats less than 20 people. There's counter seating in front of the open kitchen, counter seating by the window, and two regular tables along the wall. Service is friendly and food arrives at your table fairly quickly. Try to get the bar seating, so you can face the open-kitchen. Prices range $10-20 for dinner entrees, but portions are kind of small and not really worth the amount paid.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

The food was so amazing. The amount of flavor they were able to pack in the dish was so thoughtful and truly left my mouth begging for more. We all cleaned our plates. However, the service (again it is a TINY place) really killed the mood.\n\nTwo of us ordered Iced Tea, and we got some refills but it did take a while. The other just had water. She had to ask for a refill and even then it took 5 minutes to get her refill. I know, I know; California is in a drought, but you should be able to get more water after you ask for it right? Then the bill came, here is where I got embarrassed. We each threw our credit cards in so happy and carefree and then he looked at us like we were complete idiots and was like, \"It is a two credit card maximum\" dropped the payment sleeve and walked away. Oops! We didn't know that. None of us had cash. We apologized to him and asked if he could split the check 3 ways because we didn't know about the credit card rule. He was obviously annoyed and gave us a lecture my grandmother would be proud of, and returned with 3 separate checks.\n\nGreat! Now we all throw in our cards with the correct check and go back to chatting... WRONG. He comes over, visibly annoyed and states, \"Didn't I already tell you there is a two credit card maximum. What don't you understand about maximum?\" We all looked at each other puzzled, and apologized, \"Sorry, none of us have cash\". I am cowering in the corner; why did I convince these people to come here for lunch. One of my coworkers is ready to leave and starting to complain and wants to refuse a tip (we all tipped in the end). He rolls his eyes and again gives us the lecture that this is against the policy but he will make the exception for us but next time... Sorry buddy, there definitely will not be a next time! Ok well maybe but only because the food was SO stinkin' amazing.

They were cooked to pure excellence. They were flavorful and cooked with apple and bacon. I don't really eat bacon, so I picked out the bits, but I loved how beautifully all of the flavors melded together. \n\nFor the main dish I got the fish dish, which came with two quinoa cakes, with ancho chiles, served with roasted sweet pepper coulis, tangy onions, avocado and yam chips. The avocado paired nicely with the tangy sauce and the quinoa cakes complimented the fish with a refreshing new texture. I finished. Every. Bite. On. My.

It is a cute little restaurant with limited seating, so don't try going here with you momma and her 5 friends. A large pomelo model marks this restaurant's place, so it's hard to miss. \n\nThere's a few tables and bar seating so you can watch the chef at work, and window seating as well. Simple wood decor and the yellow paint on the walls give it a homey, cozy feel. I was greeted by the owner who was able to seat me pretty quickly, even during the lunch time craze. \n\nTheir food is all different Asian dishes but with a mild twist. I was surprised to see some Filipino dishes-usually not found in this area, which is great for me. I decided to go with the Thai curry- I've been on a curry trip for the past month or so.\n\nThe food came out in a pretty large bowl- with your choice of brown or white rice. Usually, traditional curry is deep in color depending on if you get yellow or red or green- this was a white- with hints of red and yellow. The dish comes with chicken, beans, bamboo shoots, other veggies, lime leaves, and eggplant. I and not too fond of eggplant so they were able to take it out of the curry for me. Thank you!\n\nIt had the sweet, creamy, spiciness that you are used to in Thai curry, but there was strong citrus flavor from the lime leaves that I wasn't used to. Maybe that's the fusion part? Regardless, still a good plate to have. \n\nThe service was fast and really polite! Definitely gave the place a more personal touch.\n\nI would go here again. I'm curious to try the Filipino dishes :)", "author": "Kristine T."}

The phrase usually leaves me with a sad impression, like Asian food that's not good enough to be authentic. So I was a bit apprehensive about trying Pomelo, even though the sign in sort of cute and I have a bias towards one-word restaurants. Anyway, I had always passed by on the N so I decided to give it a try one day with some friends.\n\nFirst of all, the restaurant is super tiny, and I'm sure it's packed during weekday lunches. I came for early dinner on a random weekday so the crowd was pretty light until the middle of the night, when more people started coming in.\n\nI love sisig, so I was a bit apprehensive trying the tofu sisig appetizer. I wasn't disappointed at all though. The dish is a twist on the tradtional sisig pork, but the flavorings are spot on and the end result is very very appetizing.\n\nThe Muravera is absolutely delicious! It's a whole cornucopia of items: toasted sardinian couscous with fennel, spring onion, fava beans, english peas, pancetta, saffron and fresh herbs. There's a lot going on but it works together and the result is wonderful deliciousness\n\nService is excellent, very attentive, but not in your face.

This spot is absolutely perfect for a date.\n\nWhen you come, do yourself a favor and order the polenta appetizer. It has polenta cakes that feature a rich dairy flavor to them, and are topped with a mushroom ragu that somehow introduces a maple flavor while being firmly in the savory category. The dish got a lot of going on in terms of its flavor profile, but the end result is something that both my date and I agreed was breathtakingly good, like something you take a bite of, your eyes lose focus, and you think that perhaps, just maybe, this is the sort of thing that has been missing from your life.

D:\n\nCame in with pretty high expectations. I do like Asian fusion. I think its a great way to either a) bring out some really cool aspects of Asian cuisine by using Western food/techniques, or b) bring out some really cool aspects of Western cuisine by using Asian food/techniques. Asian and Western food can compliment each other very well. \n\nUnfortunately, I did not feel this way about Pomelo. :(\n\nWe had an appetizer, the \"masantol\". The dish was REALLY REALLY flavorful and quite salty.  And super lemoney. I think it would have been better over rice or something. It was just a little too much. \n\nI got the Manila, and my partner got the Langzhou. The Manila was a poor choice on my part- I don't like thin noodles, and these noodles were the vermicelli thin tiny little noodles. Ick, it felt like worms going down my throat @_@;; but noodle thickness is just a weird personal preference of mine. As far as flavor was concerned, it wasn't bad. I liked the Chinese sausage (Chinese sausage ROCKS). But the chicken had a flavor that really sits in your mouth... I didn't like it :(\n\nMy partner found out that he didn't like seared ahi tuna, so we swapped plates. I liked his noodles (they were pretty garlickey and tasty), but they weren't anything out of the ordinary. \n\nWhen I go out to eat Asian fusion, I expect the combination to be something new, innovative, and most importantly, the East and West have to compliment each other. .When I ate these noodles, I felt like it was just a fancy Western take on Eastern cuisine without actually understanding what goes into making Asian noodles. \n\nPrices weren't worth it.

It was quiet, comfortable, and just what I wanted for our night ^_^\n\nThe open kitchen was a nice sight to see and observing that other customers were definitely enjoying their food. The waiter was amiable and he kinda figured that we were new so he gave us extra time to figure out what to order.\n\nThe food came out surprisingly quick compared to restaurants like this. (thumbs up!) For appetizers we ordered the Cabo San Lucas which is basically Fish Taco's with mango salsa. To be honest this is the first time i've ever had fish taco's and it tasted amazing!  the salsa went paired up with the fish so well and, oh man, we devoured that plate til there was just jalapeno's left on the dish haha. \n\nJonathan had the Madiun and I had the Manila. Both were noodle dishes which were both unique and delicious. I thought that these dishes were priced very appropriately and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We had lemonade and an iced ginger lemongrass to quench our taste buds for some relief. There was a lot of food to go around so we did not complain at all. Jonathan had finished everything seeing that the bowl was only half full whereas he would have liked it to be filled to the rim :P \n\nI'm coming back here again :) YuM!!!!", "author": "Marie G."}

(http://www.yelp.com/biz/uZybAaC88oLnqR1FEUamGQ)\n\nFOOD:  I tried dinner at Pomelo for the first time at Judah location.  Compared to their brunch, dinner menu is noodle heavy.  Almost every item is noodle base - which keeps the prices reasonable around $10-15/dish.  I must say that I enjoyed their brunch more than their noodle dishes.  The problem of a restaurant offering a vast variety of cultural food is that they don't know how to make all dishes authentic.  For example, their 'Sapporo' ($9) Ramen was a disaster.  They did not use the right type of ramen noodles; instead used some soggy noodles that is NEVER used in ramen.  Soup was slightly better than the noodle, but not authentic.  On the other hand, their soba dish 'otsu' ($9) was pretty tasty.  It sure wasn't authentic, but it was made in an interesting california style that made the dish work.  Their ahi tuna dish 'lanzhou' ($14.5) was pretty good.  \n\nAll in all, a pretty cool restaurant, as long as you don't go here to seek authentic dishes.

We arrived about one o'clock in the afternoon on a weekday and waited about ten minutes before claiming two seats at the counter. Watching the chefs work (and maneuver around one another) is pretty amazing considering that the kitchen space they've got isn't much more than that of  your average city apartment. A large tray of water is kept boiling on the side into which they dunk individual portions of noodles. From what I observed, it appears that everything is cooked to order. If you're a fan of watching your food being prepared, I'd get a seat at the counter.\n\nFor lunch I ordered the \"garfagnana\" which is an organic faro salad tossed with roasted corn, cherry tomatoes, scallions and an aromatic herbed vinaigrette, topped with grilled skirt steak. The steak was very tender and the dish was full of flavor. It held up to my ultimate test of tasting good the next day (since I rarely finish a dish in one sitting, this holds weight with me). My dining companion had the \"lanzhou\" - fresh egg noodles stir fried with ginger, scallion and garlic, with peppered ahi tuna, seared rare and topped with a miso-sesame drizzle.

We were lucky though as everyone after us had to wait for seating or ended up getting carry out.\n\nI chose the \"Manila - pancit bihon, Filipno style stir fried rice noodles with sauteed prawns and chicken, chinese sausage and vegetables, with scallions and lemon wedge\" ($10).  The chinese sausage was cooked separately to blacken them up a bit.  The noodles and chicken were very tasty and I was impressed. I was a bit disappointed with only two shrimps though.  (The cook made two orders of Manila together, and I think most of my shrimp ended up in the other take out order as I watched.)  \n\nMenu changes seasonally, which is always nice.  There weren't many choices on this menu that particularly struck my fancy though.  \n\nAtmosphere is nice and this is definitely a 'local' eatery.

There is only a team of 3 in the restaurant - 1 head chef, 1 helper who also cleans dishes, and 1 waiter. The waiter is a little slow, but you kinda have to take that as part of the atmosphere.\n\nFood was good.  I picked out some of the recommendations Yelpers listed here.  \n\n1.  Otsu - Japanese buckwheat noodles, served cold with stir-fried tofu, with a hint of lemon and hot sauce.   This is listed as an entree but we split it as an appetitizer.  (What I liked was that when we told the waiter that we are splitting this, the dish actually came out on 2 small plates already separated.)  \n2.   Manila - vermicelli stir-fried with a combo of veggies, shrimp, and chicken.  I thought it was really good because the vermicelli came out not dry at all!!  This dish didn't have any sauce with it, so it was amazing that the vermicelli was still tasty and moist.\n3.  Bandung - thick Shanghai-type noodle with baby bok choy and shrimp.  This is a spicy dish.  I did not particularly think it was all that great.  It was OK.  Definitely not my favorite.\n\nThe only dessert they have is gelato/sorbet.

The seating is limited so there's a good chance you'll be at the bar right by the kitchen. \n\nIt seems to always be full when I'm there, yet I've never waited for a table either. Win. The owner and cooks are so attentive and friendly. \n\nBut anyway, the food is what I really care about and it's so yummy and interesting!  I have a slightly compulsive need to constantly be trying new dishes/restaurants, but what brings me back to Pomelo is their extensive menu that changes ever so slightly (different ingredients depending on what's seasonal, etc. to modify more or less the same dish, rather than removing items from the menu altogether, which seems so brilliant). \n\nSo far I've had their tacos and the korean scallion/scallops/prawns pancakes. These are considered the smaller plates and are $8 to $9, but I think are enough for a small meal for a person. Definitely a steal for the quality of food you're getting compared to many other restaurants.\n\nI've also had a taste of one of the noodle dishes before and it was great.

That said, it was cozy and added charm. I didn't even mind that it was sparsely decorated. Love the open kitchen, as it was impressive to see the one cook and maybe one sous chef working their magic. And magic it was!! \n\nThe menu is pretty eclectic--pan Asian fusion with some Mexican/Latin dishes. All appetizers are called Side Trips, and entrees, Destinations and Upgrades.  Adored it!!  I was ecstatic to see a dish called \"Masantol\" as it's the name of the town my father grew up in the Philippines. The dish is a sizzling spicy tofu sisig which was way different as sisig typically is prepared with pork. Loved the dish! Tofu was so flavorful and mimicked the traditional dish very well.  All ingredients listed were very present in the dish (eg chili peppers, garlic, soy sauce, lemon, red onion). My dining companion's pick was the \"Cabo San Lucas,\" two soft snapper tacos. Fish tacos were done right, and while I enjoyed them, it wasn't anything to sing home about. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the \"Koh Samui,\" and substituted the jasmine rice for the fresh egg noodles offered in another dish. I'm a fan of coconut curry, and the vegetables included in the dish: oriental long beans eggplant, and squash reminds me of a dish my mother cooks. Very flavorful, nice kick. I should have left the order alone and had with with the rice. Probably would have enjoyed it more.  (My bad.) \n\nService was timely and friendly.

With the help of my dear boyfriend and text Google, we found out we parked just down the street from the restaurant.\n\nFood- I love the freshness and the bursting herbs/flavors.  I got the Semarang and Mmmm.  My friend got the Havana  and MmMmm.  Gelato was yum, good ending for our dinner.  \n\nPlace-  The place is located away from the busy 9th and Irving area so I think you can find better parking.  When I saw that Pomelo fruit, I knew I had arrived.  I love the intimacy of the place.  It's like walking to someone's kitchen, ask you what you wanna eat then they cook... you can even see them cook!  I'm undecided whether it'd be good for romantic date... it's a small place and the ambiance is nice so that's good, but if you wanna whisper sweet nothings to your date... maybe not the place.  \n\nService- Waiter was great, made sure everything is good, but not intrusive which was nice.  \n\nOverall, I love it!  I would go back again and try their different dishes.  I guess they don't totally change their menus coz a lot of the dishes were still there from the firs time I came there.  As we were leaving, we said our goodbyes to the waiter and I felt like saying bye to everyone as if it was rude to leave a family party without saying bye to everybody.  hahah", "author": "Claire J."}

That being said, going to the usual places can be a little dull at times and I look forward to finding hidden gems to spice things up. Pomelo is my latest find and is a great example of a cozy restaurant. It looks as if it can accommodate about 20 people. The decor is modern with an Asian Fusion flare to it. \n\nFOOD: I ordered the Koh Sumai, which consisted of chicken coconut curry over jasmine rice. String beans, thai eggplants, squash, mushrooms, and lime leaves are also infused into the curry sauce. Initially, I didn't care for the sour taste from the lime but as I continued eating, I grew to appreciate it's flavor more and more. It provided an interesting contrast to the subtle sweetness from the rest of the sauce. My only gripe is that they don't offer a brown rice option.\n\nHelpful tip: I ordered the dish to go, which was a smart move. They include a lot of curry and put it in a separate container from the rice. Thus, I was able to save the sauce for a second meal. For $11.50, it's a pretty pricey item, so making the most bang for your buck is a good idea.\n\nSERVICE: The waiter is very nice. I just finished a run at Kezar and while I waiting for my food, he offered me some water, seeing how tired I must have looked. \n\nPRICE: Food is not cheap even for lunch hours. Expect to spend at least $10 before tax/tip.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you want to spend a little more and try some nice Asian Fusion, this isn't a bad choice. Potentially a great place for a date and if you want to have more intimate conversation.\n\n4 stars.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

I went there for dinner, not lunch, so my opinion of the price may be skewed, but the most expensive \"destination\" is $16 (depending on the market price of fish) and for San Francisco that is pretty good. I was in a group of three and, including my two glasses of wine (for some reason the other people in my party were not drinking), the entire meal was around $60, not bad in my opinion.\n\nThe food we ordered was really good! It wasn't overly amazing or original, but it was a very satisfying meal with robust flavors and fresh ingredients. It is a great mixture of worldly cuisine with a familiar homestyle feeling. Even my boyfriend who decided to eat a burrito before dinner was amazed at my choice in restaurant and was regretting his pre-dinner. (sidenote: I usually pick pretentious restaurants with small portions in his opinion)\n\nMy only complaint is that the service was a bit slow.\n\nI think it is a perfect place to get take-out from or enjoy a calm, midweek dinner amongst friends.

Well, a very clean dining room in a crumby old building. \n\nExcellent cooking of a surprisingly varied menu, though the slant is definitely Asian. Vibrant flavors, good plate presentation.  I had the Koh Samui rice bowl with spicy creamy coconut curry, chicken, yam, mushrooms, long beans.  Big portion, cheap price. Tasty!  Bambie had the Philippine pancit, I tasted it - I liked the Koh Samui better.  My pal, Robert, had the Soba noodles with barely grilled fresh tuna steak coated in sesame seeds.  That was truly excellent.  \n\nIt is amazing how good the food is from an open kitchen that's 30 square feet which has a 4 burner stove.

The Inner Sunset is a goldmine for numerous under-appreciated dining options and Pomelo is no exception. \n\nYou hear about small places and this spot is smaaaaaalllll. There are 3 tables, 4 seats at a counter against the window, and about 6 seats at the counter around the kitchen. We arrived on a Friday night at 8pm and got sat at a table immediately. By the time we left, the \"lobby\" was crowded with folks. And by \"crowded\" I mean there were 4 people at our backs. Yeah, it's that small. \n\nWe ordered the Gilroy for an appetizer which is bok choy seasoned in olive oil, garlic and peppercini flakes. It was deeeelish, fostering high expectations for the meal. For dinner, I ordered the Ayacucho which, according to the menu, is \"grilled fish of the day and quinoa cakes with ancho chili, served with roasted sweet pepper coulis, tangy onions and avocado\" (Pomelo website, 2009). The fish was some kind of white fish (v. yum) and the quinoa cakes were awwwwwesome. The tangy onions were not my thing so it was the only item left on the plate by the end of the meal.\n\nMy friend ordered the Havana which was cuban influenced rice, beans, plantains and grilled skirt steak. Do yourself a favor and order this. It's served on giant banana leaves and I was tempted to steal his plate, pick up the leaves and funnel the entire meal down my mouth. Yeah, it's that good. \n\nMy advice: either come here early or at an off-hour. Beat the rush. Or order take-out. It seemed to be a popular option for all the UCSF students that came in throughout the meal. \n\nHowever you do it, just get those plantains down your throat soon.", "author": "Jared S."}

If your going to have an open kitchen, then hire a chef who smiles. This guy sucked. I decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. Bad start. \n\nI ordered the Avingon (daube proven\u00e7al) and my girlfriend ordered the cold soba noodle with pan fried tofu. The waiter was semi-attentive and polite enough, although he was slightly rude to the people next to us. He was expaining how the menu was carefully calibrated to appeal to different palates. Really?\n\nI spent more time watching the chef who was over-grilling a skirt steak that he pulled out of a bucket. Uh oh. Then I watched him cook our order. The Avignon came out of a bucket too! I was psyched (heavy sarcasm). The soba was any easy one, I figured they couldn't fk that one up. They did. \n\nWhen the food came it looked ok, so I dug in. I should have ran. \n\nAvingon. This essencially a stew. The meat should fall apart right? Nope. Well, a couple pieces did. But with a stew it should be cooked for a long time so everything is cooked equally. Traditionally Daube Proven\u00e7al is a 3 day endeavor 1 day marinate, 1 day to cook, one day in fridge to mature flavor. The flavor. What flavor? There was one singular flavor, no balance, no contrast, nothing. Where's the bay leaf? The bouquet garni? The bacon? BLAND. The gnocchi was doughy, over parsleyed, and just plain bad. The haricort vert was limp and flavorless. To top it off they put bread in the plate. Why? Isn't the gnocchi enough starch?\n\nSoba. Giant pieces of pan fried tofu on top that totally overpowered\nthe noodles. It wasn't even cooked through. The noodles were rubber and the dressing was singular. No flavor. Just plain bad. My girl ate about a tenth of it. \n\nButternut squash soup. SAGE. SAGE. SAGE. WAY TOO MUCH SAGE. it's all I tasted. It completely dominated the buttery sweetness of the squash. Once again. No balance, no contrast, just plain bad. \n\nBread and butter. 1$. What? Are you serious? Store bought bread with COLD BUTTER PACKETS that destroys the bread when you spread it. Nice. \n\nOverall, for a restaurant that charges $10+ a plate it falls short. Not that I was expecting a michelen star quality meal, but in that price range, in this city especially, I expect to walk out with a smile. \n\nOn paper the menu is creative. In reality it was poorly executed. \n\nI will not go back. \n\n*****EDITED SO IT DOESNT GET REMOVED AGAIN******", "author": "Don't A."}

I had the polenta with mushroom ragu.  It was good, but the polenta was dried out and the plate luke warm (I don't think it had been siting in a window, but more like it was prepared hours prior and just reheated).  The buckwheat noodles and tofu were good, but the flavors and plating a little sloppy.  Tofu was definitely dried out.  Cucumbers had gotten soft from probably sitting in a brine for too long.  And noodles overdressed.\n\nSign.  It really breaks your heart when your mouth waters over a dish you dreamed out for years but then doesn't deliver.  For the price, not sure if I'll go back.

So I had the Aosta instead and it was not tasty and not filling. Next time I'll stick to the Masantol or Otsu. I also had the Suwa which was good. The strasbourg is a little hard, as artisan bread should be but then the butter is cold. Another customer and her friend sat at the counter and got the chef's attention while the waiter was out of sight and he immediately tells her \"the waiter will be with you shortly\". There was only 2 parties of 2 people in the restaurant, it's not like he was busy and in terms of customer service why pass on the buck to the middle man when you can do it yourself. The other issue I had with the chef was that his other customer asked for more vegetables in her Manila dish he was \"hesitant to add them because that's not how the dish is made\".

Went there a couple of days back with a good book (In Defense of Food of all things!), sat at the counter for the first time and quite enjoyed, with much amazement, seeing the chef cook my meal in front of me on a very simple gas range! WOW! P.S. I almost wanted to take my note pad out and take notes on how he was cooking.\n\na.

The richness of the wine and the garlic flakes were well balanced with the simplicity, juiciness and natural flavor of the bok choy.\n\nb. Dinner was simple with the Havana which is the cuban style fried rice with plantains, chipotles, served with grilled skirt steak, saut\u00e9ed onions and cuban avocado salad. Avocado salad was a perfect blend of good texture and a somewhat tart flavor but refreshing. This was balanced with the rice which was rich in spices and the skirt steak was moist, thinly cut and easy to eat.\n\nc. Desert was a simple mochi ice cream with a wafer\n\n2. In the past me and my friends have had the surin, hania, cabo san luca, suwa and tripoli appetizers, the gorgonzola, sonoma, solo, the hu\u00e9, manila, avignon, koh samui, guangzhou and san marino dinner and no complaints. \n\n3.

Of those seats, many are bar seats either facing outdoors or looking into the microscopic kitchen. I'm consistently amazed by what they can produce in such a small space!\n\nMy favorite things I've ever had there are the Cuban fried rice, Chicken curry, and Filipino noodles (I think called \"the Manilla\").

I hyped myself up for the FOOD, it was as if I'd read the profile, perused the pics, exchanged great emails, and set a time and date for \"coffee\" - and then felt absolutely no connection. \n\nMy first lunch here, right before Spanksgiving was tasty. I mean, it was as delicious as a $14.50 lunch entree gets! I forget the cutesie globally inclined name that described the duck ragout over flat noodles of unknown provenance that made me not care that I was two days away from the biggest eating holiday of the year. \n\nThe portion was gigantic, and I put aside all pretense of being dainty and demure - I worked that predictable Asian Fusion serving bowl like a trough... and grinned as I asked for a to-go box. \n\nSo, last week, my gal pal from Shanghai was in the 'hood and I chose Pomelo because it was 11:30 and I wanted to beat the lunch crowd. This restaurant IS intimate, if that's a charming euphemism for \"tiny and crowded\". \n\nWe both asked for hot tea... and got a weird basket full of eclectic teas, ranging from Darjeeling Breakfast to Chamomile. Is it too much to ask for the standard Japanese Green Tea at an Asian Fusion joint? As I recall, I ended up with some sort of Ginger-Lemon-Heartburn infusion, so 40 mgs of Prilosec is what I had for dessert, if you really want to know. \n\nGal Pal ordered the Lanzhou, which she hated, but was too polite to say so. I used deductive reasoning and simple observation: she only ate 1/8 of her entree and picked at the noodles, which can only be described as flaccid. And that's NEVER a complimentary adjective. \n\nDid I mention that Gal Pal is the same height and weight as yours truly, but can eat three times as much as I can in a single sitting? \n\nCringe-worthy. \n\nI chose the Manila, which was a leap of faith, because I really don't eat Filipino food... but the description was written in such a titillating manner that I really couldn't refuse the chance to sample their interpretation of this dish. \n\n* Eater Beware - the menu reads: manila \npancit bihon - Filipino style stir fried rice noodles tossed with \nsaut\u00e9ed prawns, chicken, Chinese sausage & vegetables, with \nscallion and lemon 11 \n\nHowever... they don't use rice noodles; they were the standard bean thread, glassy noodles, and while I anticipated finer, more delicate cuts of the aforementioned Chinese Sausage, giant pieces that were overwhelming to the palate showed up in the dish. \n\nI wanted to fall in love with a tasty lunch and look my entree in the [figurative] eye and say, \"You're fantastic. I'm going to take you home with me!\" But it just didn't happen. \n\nThe Asian Fusion descriptor is also a bit confusing for me, since the menu is so muddled. Is it really fusion if you're working multiple continents and ingredients that aren't even vaguely Asian at all? And that's tasting on the curve, accounting for the \"fusion\". \n\nhttp://www.pomelosf.com/judah%20late%20winter%202009%20lunch.pdf \n\nDishes named: Strasbourg, Merida, Moscow, Ayacucho, Biloxi, Havana, Le Puy, Cuneo, Aosta, Gilroy, Vigo, Puerto Princesa, and... Cabo San Lucas...? \n\nPlease! Don't insult me - there's no Asian in those locations, names or the INGREDIENTS listed! \n\nPomelo... it's not me, IT'S YOU! Clearly... you're going through some sort of transition and is global, to be sure... but just because you offer a side of sauteed tofu doesn't mean you're Asian Fusion. Make up your mind and commit, already! \n\nThen we can enjoy the symphony, red wine, and romantic walks on the beach... just like every other normal couple that met through an online dating service, but will always say we met in the travel section of a bookstore! \n\nCall me when you get your act together, okay?", "author": "Kim D."}

Sometimes certain things can be really overpowering in curry dishes, but that wasn't the case here. The lanzhou was also a good dish. The noodles were cooked to the right consistency and paired nicely with the ahi tuna. I think my bf liked the dish, but not enough to order it again next time.

He's been raving about this place ever since I asked him for restaurant recommendations on my first day at work. This place is small, but quaint. It eludes a homey feeling not only because of the atmosphere but also because the staff is very friendly (not to mention prompt). Never had a problem with seating. This place, however, may not be as appealing to those with unadventurous taste buds. This place serves fusion dishes, which means that they take a piece of a country's culture and place it on their menu with an added twist of their own. For people who don't like to venture outside of their comfort zone when it comes to food, I would say this place is not ideal for you. I've seen a lot of reviews about how the food could have been more flavorful, place was too small, etc. but honestly, the two dishes that I've tasted on their menu were prety spot on.\n\nI had the \"Havana,\" which had cuban style fried rice with black beans, plantains, chipotles, ginger and cilantro, served with grilled skirt steak, saut\u00e9ed onions and cuban avocado salad. By far the best thing I've eaten near my workplace. It is very flavorful, and you know me and my favorite herb Mr. Cilantro. Put cilantro in my dish and I'm sold. You can't go wrong with the avocado salad either. The dish is very well put together and it gives me a little taste of Cuba (kinda want to go there now). It is my favorite dish there so far. I also tried the \"Manila\" which is a classic twist of the \"pancit bihon.\" It is a filipino style stir fried rice noodles tossed with sauteed prawns, chicken, chinese sausage & vegetables, scallion and lemon. Tastes close to how we make it at home. Also took my best friend here and had their fish special which was delicious. \n\nIf you look at Pomelo's menu, there's a wide variety of dishes to choose from, stemming from different parts of the world.

Honestly, like Lily C., I am against Asian fusion in most cases, but if I have to eat it and it tastes good, who am I to judge them for being creative? Went with coworkers who have been wanting to try this place and, this was not a case of creativity, but rather a lack thereof. \n\nCame with a group from work for lunch. Had a tough time deciding what to get because several things sounded good. Went with the Koh Samui ($12.50) at the recommendation of the waiter. It was advertised as a Thai red chicken curry with long beans, mushrooms, and squash, and I subbed in brown rice. It seemed like one of the least fusion-y things on the menu, so probably a safe bet right? The portion was very large, so at least they earned the obligatory one star that I have given them. I do not know how this is considered a curry. There was basically no curry flavor to it at all. More like a coconut milk broth. And what was Thai about it? No chilies, or at least no heat whatsoever. No detectable fish sauce. And contrary to other reviews, I tasted no kaffir lime leaves. I could have dealt with the somewhat dry pieces of chicken if the curry had at least been flavorful, but it was so bland. I cannot figure out how they managed to extract all of the flavor from this dish. And to top it all off, the rice was hard and undercooked. I understand that it is short grained organic brown rice, but it should not be hard. This dish was a complete train wreck overall and waaaaayyyy overpriced, especially considering the quality-price ratio expected in this city, let alone this area. \n\nPerhaps I ordered incorrectly? I must say that the Manila, which is a take on Pancit, looked amazing, but my coworker did not finish more than half of it or take the rest with her despite saying that she liked it. They burned something in the open kitchen while we were eating, which stunk the tiny place up something fierce. One of my coworkers did not get her soup until we were almost finished eating.

On the one hand Pomelo is excellent, and exactly the type of place that deserves good reviews.  On the other hand, now you will all know about this place that's not as much of a place as a wonderfully-kept secret.\n\nOkay, it has enough reviews that it really can't qualify as a secret.  But when you're in Pomelo it really feels like your restaurant, and no one else's.  One would think that's mostly owing to the fact that there's only room for about a dozen people.  But it's more than that.  The lights are low, you can see your food being prepared, and while you realize you're effectively stuffed like a sardine into a setting that's probably best compared to a diner, you don't really care.  I just haven't experienced that type of intimacy from any other restaurant, and it makes it my go-to place when my boyfriend and I want a date night.  But heck, you could even go by yourself!  It's small enough that the stigma of dining alone is no longer applicable.\n\nWhat's more, I like the food even better than I like the ambiance.  It's a noodle house, only all growed up.  For those of us who like some starch with our starch and a side of rice, this premise is really rather ingenious.  It's listed as Asian fusion, but I think of it more as a multi-cultural noodle adventure.  Mexican, Italian, French, and Asian flavors mingle quite amicably on Pomelo's menu.  And while they're each saying \"Pick me, pick me!\" they assemble more in harmony than in competition.  Because the ingredients are fresh and local, the menu tends to vary.  But the most recent thing I've loved is the cold soba salad.  I'm a sucker for cold soba despite its lack of authenticity, and Pomelo really delivers.  The dressing is nuanced and not too salty, and it was the most refreshing thing I've put in my body in quite a while.  I also had a pasta featuring shrimp, goat cheese, and a vinaigrette, and it was delicious.  It's seasonal, so you'll want to keep an eye out for it if you're a fan of goat cheese.  My boyfriend, however, would be woeful if I did not mention the fish and quinoa cakes.  It seems to be a staple, and with good reason.  They cook their fish to perfection, and the quinoa cakes are wonderfully moist and pop in that way that only quinoa can do.\n\nI know I mentioned the fresh ingredients, but Pomelo is also to be lauded for their portion sizes.  They're smaller, and I really love that - but not so small you feel like you're being cheated.  Only small enough that you feel care was put into your individual dish.  What I may like best about Pomelo is that you get food that (to me) feels very upscale for prices that are just a teensy bit upscale.  You get the fresh and healthy food without any snobbery, and you get a truly intimate (almost underground) ambiance without any intimidation.  What's not to love?  Yeah, that's what I thought.", "author": "Becca S."}

They have a nice wine list and an intimate yet casual atmosphere.  That said, this quaint little spot is not necessarily a place I would come to if I lived out of the neighborhood.   \n\nGenerally, I am satisfied with my food there, but not overjoyed.  There are a few great dishes at this place, including the Gilroy (garlicky bok choy), the Korean pancakes (packed with multiple flavors), and the buckwheat noodle salad ( refreshing if you want a simple, tasty cold dish.)   However, I find that a few of their signature dishes, such as the Havana and the Lanzou noodle dish, quite frankly, taste very similar.  It's  as though they take the garlicky oil used for the Gilroy bok choy and used it to toss the beans and rice in the Havana, and then used a similar 'sauce' for the Lanzou noodle dish.  The result tends to be plates that lack dimension and are heavy-handed with oil.  I may be too particular, but I dont think the savory, rosemary/thyme  chicken on the beet salad should be the same chicken served on the Havana, a cuban inspired dish.  And no, I don't think it is the sake of 'fusion' - if it is, they should note that \"grilled rosemary herb chicken\" will be added on top.\n\nIf you like garlic and arent too finicky about sophisticated flavor in your food, I think you will enjoy it.  The dishes are well over satisfactory and they fill you up - definitely a result of the great quantities of rice or noodles and not due to the amount of protein (meat lovers should dine elsewhere, as they will be disappointed by the disproportionate amount of meat to carbs on their plate).\n\nIt would be great to see them fine tune their sauces and use of fresh herbs, and work out their ratios of protein/veg/carb to make more multi-dimensional food.  Until then, we will probably still be going!  It's close by and we support our local businesses.", "author": "Ki W."}

The place seats less than 20, and more than half of those are counter seats.  This is not a place for the claustrophobic.\n\nThe menu at Pomelo is imaginative, featuring fresh and economical fusion food that is endearing to both palate and wallet.  Most entrees are served over a grain-based foundation (e.g. udon, rice noodles, quinoa), and are clever if not revolutionary combinations of fresh and largely organic ingredients.  My recent meal there included the Pomelo salad, which is your basic field greens and goat cheese salad, but had a delightful accent of fresh, sweet peach.  The Sonoma entree was a good representation of the larger selection, bucatini pasta tossed with heirloom tomatoes that had been sauteed with balsamic vinegar, and topped with basil and tiger prawns.  Everything was terrific.\n\nIf you're going to dine in a restaurant as small as Pomelo, you might as well take a counter seat overlooking the kitchen.  There you'll see every step of your meal's preparation, and the cook in return will get to hear every word of your conversation.  That's kind of the fun of Pomelo -- the intimacy between staff and patrons, and if you're OK with that,  you'll do just fine.", "author": "Hugh B."}

This dish did not disappoint in the least, I highly recommend it! The \"lanzhou\" was, much to my dismay, a bit disappointing. It is an egg noodle dish topped with seared ahi - the noodles were sooooo good, but the ahi was remarkably bland. Maybe it was just a bad fish, but I think it was actually just a little over-seared... it somehow lost it's usual flavor, and the texture was a little too rough. Plus, there was a sauce on top of it that was just plain weak. I was sad =(\n\nAt any rate, overall I was pretty satisfied. The place is *beyond* small - but if you come here on a week night this makes for a really neat experience. The dining area is practically IN the kitchen - you can watch your food being made.

Could I really write a restaurant review without addressing the food? No. Honestly--and sadly, because I desperately want to LOVE this place--the two dishes I've had were just a bit off. Not in a \"rotten\" way or anything. More like flavor/texture issues. Dish one was the soba noodle salad. Textures were good, but the flavor was just not right: tart & spicy. Nothing else. Not savory and/or sweet at all, and you really need one of those (if not both) to offset the sourness and spiciness of the dish. Dish two was the ahi tuna with udon noodles (lazhou, I think). Flavors were very tasty--heavy on the ginger and garlic, but I like that. However, the buttery texture of the very deliciously fresh tuna just didn't meld well with the thick chewiness of the noodles. I had to eat them separately. I might try it again if I can substitute steak or tofu.\n\nSo am I really going to stick to 4-stars? Shit yes, I am! Did you not listen to (er, read) my wine rant? POM-EL-O bitches. Yum.

This was with someone special.\n\nWe started with the Pomelo salad: lettuces, raspberries, hazelnuts, goat cheese, perfectly dressed with a light vinaigrette. Easily enough for two. Cabo San Lucas fish tacos followed this: snapper, corn tortillas, mango salsa and picked peppers. Two to share. Generous helpings for an appetizer. For our main, we split the Ayacucho. Quinoa cakes (who can pronounce this correctly??) with a nice size piece of fish. An ancho chili and roasted red pepper sauce was everywhere with onions and avocado.\n\nGluttony got the better of me and we ordered the Aosta: baked polenta with mushrooms and a cream sauce. It's a delicious dish but too much for us to finish.\n\nLingering for a couple of hours in this tiny place (seats for 18?) didn't bother the staff of three: waiter, chef, bus. Sitting at the counter we watched the performance art of cooking as the wave of happy diners ebbed and flowed.\n\nHaving been before, I knew what to expect from the food. I just didn't know what to expect from the meal. A great place to begin a wonderful night.", "author": "Dave B."}

The dishes are healthy, tasty, and elegant - they look like a work of art (eating is destroying).  The prices are incredibly low for the quality - they could easily double them and nobody would bat an eye.\n\nThe Inner Sunset location is very small - seats about 15 people.  They don't take reservations, but I've been pretty lucky.  Forget about large parties though.\n\nIt's worth waiting a few minutes to sit at the bar, so you can watch the cook working his magic.  If they're busy and you don't want to wait, there are several other great places to eat a couple blocks away on 9th Ave.\n\nThe Noe Valley location is more spacious and the food was just as good, but it lacks the intimate feel of the Inner Sunset location (props for maintaining quality as they expand - too many restaurants lose their touch as they get bigger).\n\nI almost didn't write a review because I don't want this place to get too popular, but these guys deserve all the success they can get - they've done everything right.

But what really does it for us are the side of plantains and the Cuban avocado salad. The avocado salad is so tangy and refreshing that we've been known to phone in a side order for take out just to have it with a home cooked meal. And besides, when is avocado ever bad?\n\nIn terms of space, Pomelo self-describes itself as \"intimate, simple and undeniably global\" and they definitely know what they're talking about when it comes to intimacy. The Judah location is small, sometimes to a fault, and if all three 2-person tables are occupied in addition to the six or so bar seats it can really heat up.

The restaurant fits maybe 16 people, and we sat at the ledge which overlooks the kitchen. I think this might be the only restaurant in San Francisco where the chef can - and does - take your order and serve your food. It's a very quaint place, sort of like eating at home in your own kitchen, though their kitchen is probably smaller than yours.\n\nAll the food was prepared directly in front of us and appears very fresh. I think I picked up a few cooking techniques! Everything we ate was quite tasty, flavorful and felt \"healthy.\" \n\nWe had the pomelo arugula salad and nagasaki breaded chicken/vegetables for appetizers. The latter was especially tasty. For dinner we had the annot lamb ragout, and the lanzhou noodles and seared tuna. I loved the lamb ragout. The lanzhou had a lot of garlic but it was not overpowering. The tuna was really good, but wasn't the best match with the noodles.\n\nFor a neighborhood restaurant, this is a new favorite. The wine list, though not huge, has some really nice and unusual wines.  It was very surprising to find such a wonderful place in a hole-in-the-wall setting across the street from UCSF.", "author": "Rebekah T."}

Like others, Asian Fusion has always been kind of a joke cuisine to me.  As a fan of pure Asian flavors, most of the fusion food I have tried often seems to try too hard to be innovative rather than focusing on satisfying taste buds.  Pomelo, however, does an excellent job of this.  Despite a seemingly pretentious looking menu, my Koh Samui came out looking tasty and straightforward: a simple bowl topped w/ chicken, mushrooms, squash, eggplant, and string beans.  One bite in and it was packed full of flavor.  My boss went with the Ayacucho which also came out good.  Pretty much the only knock on this place is their size but it's amazing what they've been able to do with it.  No bigger than surrounding apartments, they managed to stuff a full kitchen, a few tables, and a bar area.  So waiting for a spot is common but well worth it.

I said ok not really knowing what to expect. \n\nWe walked into a cheerful and casual space that sits 20 at most and sat at a long bar-type table infront of the windows, viewing the ugly 1970s apartment building across the street. We briefly laughed at the lifesize Obama cutout standing at the half-open window of one of the units, the wind banging its cardboard head against the pane. Then we dug into the menu. \n\nThe cuisine is best described as Global Fusion, each entree combining an intresting mix of global ingredients yet none of them sticking to traditional style. I had the Havana, which was a tender and delicious strip steak served over fried rice with black beans and plantains. It was quite delicious and fresh even though I could have done without the citrus flavor. My friend had the weekend special, which was a yummy white fish of some sort. Cooked to perfection for sure, served over a risotto of some sort. We sampled each others picks and decided that we chose well. \n\nEven though we only had one glass of wine each (she had a Reisling and I had a Pinot Noir), we decided they had a fantastic wine list. One thing that even dive bars in San Francisco manage to do well. Guess that's a perk when you live an hour from wine country. \n\nAnyway, I'm picky about giving away four and five stars, so I decided to give this one a three.

As it's been stated many times on here, this place is tiny - you have to get here before the lunch rush hour to get some seats.  My friend and others had told me that this place is expensive for lunch and in general, and it certainly is - it's about $10-16 average for person, depending on what you get.  I tried the Solo (Indonesian style soup w/noodles, chicken and veggies) and thought it was okay - it wasn't bad, but it failed to leave a lasting impression on me.  For the $10 it costs here, I think the Singapore noodles over at Lime Tree is much better, in my opinion.  That dish on the other hand still to this day, a few years later, still makes me want to return there.  I tried the Manila and thought that was better than the Solo, but that is essentially just a gourmet type of Pancit - it shouldn't be more than $10.  The Havana sounded good and I would have ordered that, but spending $15 on lunch?  Are you kidding me, I don't get paid well to be eating like that.", "author": "Kahanalei M."}

It maxes out at like 12 patrons and if you sit at the counter you can watch the chef prepare your food in a kitchen the size of a broom closet.  The food is creative, delicious and very fresh tasting.  The ambiance is quiet and intimate.  Overall a great place for two friends to catch up, two lovers to quietly enjoy an evening or two strangers to get to know each other before heading home for \"just one cup of coffee.\"  You can add a third person, but they're probably going to have to have their appetizer on the curb and thus unlikely to join in on the \"cup of coffee.\"", "author": "Jason S."}

If you know what you're getting into (tiny, minimal decor, non-\"authentic\" Asian) you can't do much better. My sister lives down in China Basin and she always asks if she can come to my neighborhood when we have dinner, and by \"my neighborhood\" she means Pomelo. What's the appeal? Not the least of it is that Pomelo always has something for every nearly every freaky diet San Francisco can throw at it, executed pretty well. I'm a vegetarian: no problem. For several months my sister was following the Paleo diet: no problem. My mom eats almost nothing but meat and starches: no problem. My husband's coworker is vegan: no problem. Every once in a while you'll hit a dud (once I tried a tomato soup that tasted exactly like pizza sauce), but come back next month and they'll have a new menu. I like the aggressive attention to local and seasonal ingredients, and I love how pleasant they make it to pack in several servings of vegetables in a meal. Portion sizes are reasonable, prices are reasonable, the wine list is good, service is attentive but unobtrusive (although it slips a little when they get very busy, but that's true anywhere). The small scale of the place makes it very intimate even though decor-wise, it's basically a shed. Pomelo doesn't complete with white tablecloth restaurants, but it pretty much owns its niche. It reminds me of neighborhood restaurants in Paris, where the ambition isn't to become a destination but to make it easy for people who live and work nearby to eat well.

My friend ordered the ramen noodles, which came out soggy, swimming in a bowl of tasteless undersalted soup with what was supposed to be sliced pork on top but was really mostly sliced fat. My dish was a japanese yaki soba type stir fry  which proved to be a disasterous cornucopia of mismatched flavors topped with bonito, this fish food like substance that didn't make any sense whatsoever.
