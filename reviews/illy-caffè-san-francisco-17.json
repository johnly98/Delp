Many people spoke about their almond rose latte and so I gave it a try. \n\nI went around 3pm on a Monday afternoon and it was pretty busy; it took more than 5 minutes for them to make my drink. The coffee itself is very light, with hint of rose and subtle sweetness. \n\nAs I mentioned above, I was there to work. The wifi wasn't great and disconnected every 10 minutes. The seating area is pretty cozy, so this location would make a better social than study spot.", "author": "Alice L."}

Lots of indoor seating so you can have a business chat with real glass/ceramic instead of paper cups.  Though I still prefer the Battery Street location a tad more because of the outdoor seating.\n\nMini \u00c9claires (Chocolate, Vanilla, Caramel, Raspberry): About two bites each, if you want to savor them, though they could be easily dispatched in one bite.  Perfect if you want to taste a bunch of flavors.  A little pricey if you want to replicate the weight of a regular \u00c9clair, which I'm guessing is about 5-6 of these.  The chocolate was the tastiest.  The vanilla felt the most traditional, though I missed having a chocolate ganache on top.  The caramel was odd because it wasn't filled with actual caramel, but more like some quasi-caramel flavored cream.  The raspberry was just ok too, more creamy than jam-y.\n\nBomboloni: Very disappointing.  Only a tiny dab of jam.  And the doughnut part tasted stale.  A simple munchkin would have tasted better (and been a lot cheaper).\n\nTiramisu Mignon: More like a tiny creme cup with a cocoa dusting on top.  Didn't taste much like tiramisu at all.\n\nChocolate Layer Cake MIgnon: Kinda stale tasting.  The big chocolate cake slice looked a lot fresher.\n\nCaramel Tempesta: Like a Starbucks frappuccino, but not as sweet and a lot more coffee tasting.  Only came in one size, which was a medium glass, though that is perfect for a caffeine pick me up without being greedy. \n\nLuce: It was my consolation prize since they were out of the blended tiramisu espresso (though they didn't tell me until after I paid).  The cold foam on top really did have a nutella-like taste.  Helped sweetened the bitter coffee below when you sipped it from the cup.  That concept totally didn't work through a straw though.", "author": "Adam B."}

When did an Illy Cafe open up on the block? I've only been gone from home a few years and my old work stomping grounds (Montgomery) street got a face lift. I hate store bought Illy beans but I love Illy beans freshly grind at their cafes. \n\nLATTE - I'd say its not my favorite latte but it is one that I could consume daily as I had done when I lived here. Their beans are good, in my opinion they are bold with light acidity. Although I like the light and rounded beans, I can still take in this bold bean without complaint. That's a good thing!\n\nThe ambiance was clean and spacious and comfortable, the kind where you can sit for hours surfing the net, or having conversation, or working, or studying, or people watching. I love cafes like where I can be a cafe dweller. The cafe dweller in me wanted to take a moment from my busy schedule, order a latte, and post up at the window counter and observe the city streets. I got nostalgic, missing my city life. Thinking about what I had and didn't have, the empty heart and fancy life with the high pressure job that made me run away from this beautiful city and turned me into a beach bum. Then as you know it, your taking the last sips from the tiny Illy espresso cup they serve the espresso and you snap back to reality and go about your business.\n\nUntil the next review...", "author": "Jane A."}

I've been passing this location for the past couple of months as it was being fitted so when it finally opened this week, I stopped by to give it a try.\n\nilly Caff\u00e8 is on a block with two other specialty coffee shops jostling for business - Blue Bottle which is just down the road and Coffee Cultures which is across the road. One block down you have Peet's, Starbucks & Phils so you are literally spoilt for choice around here.\n\nilly Caff\u00e8 is positioned along the lines of an European Caffe so there is a lot of seating inside unlike other coffee shops which are more grab and go. I feel this will be a big draw for crowds especially during the day. Its lineup is also relatively simple - espresso, lattes, cappuccino, mocha all using the house blend. If you are looking for something more fancy (drip, pour over etc.) you are better off going to Blue Bottle a few steps down. It also has your typical baked goods counter but I'd prefer to get something from Specialty's Caf\u00e9 & Bakery down the road which specializes in baked goods. I guess at some point we should also see salads and sandwiches like other illy Caff\u00e8 locations.\n\nAs they have just opened there was hardly any line when I stopped by on my way to work. I'm sure this will change very soon as word gets out and lines here will be comparable to other coffee shops and that would be the time to see if they can keep turnaround times under 10 minutes. \n\nI got a small Jasmin Vanilla Latte ($4.25 + SF Health Mandate). The latte art could use a little improvement but the barista was very friendly (enjoy this till he gets drowned in orders). I felt that the Jasmine flavor was very mild and the Vanilla overpowered everything. Still it was pretty good. Price wise it was in line with what you would pay for a cup of coffee in the area (around the $5 mark). I can definitely see myself returning regularly to sip on their expresso as I live close by.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Run by a few of the wonderful familiar faces (Joe & friends) from the Castro location!\n\nVery large space, well laid out, bright and cheery with beautiful art pieces throughout.

The mint lifted the heaviness of the floral aroma and created a cool, crisp sensational on the lips. It was light for a latte and easy to drink through whether it be by itself or with a small pastry. \n\nI also decided to order the lemon tart which was a great contrast of flavors compared to the warmth of the lavender. The lemon tart had a quick impact on the first bite; the zest and lemon juice were easy to locate and the consistency of the filling balanced well with the thickness of crust. It definitely would have tasted more satisfying if the tart was slightly warm at least on the outside of the tart. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere was enjoyable for a midday business meeting or afternoon conversation. The decor was modern and spacious with a large variety of seating whether it'd be bar, stool, or booth seating.

Nice and cold (like they should be) and filled with some very good berry filling. The drinks took a bit of time to get. The place was absolutely busy at 2:00pm and I understood. It took about 10 minutes to get my drink, but boy was it worth the wait! The ice cream inside the espresso was perfect and my pictures don't do it justice. Some small gripes are definitely that the place is a bit pricey. This all came out to about $10 bucks and at first it seems like you're not getting a lot, but man is this stuff quality!

When i received my capp it was mostly milk, not dry at all and basically a small latte. I was so upset i almost put it back on the counter and left. When i checked what was written on the cup it said \"small capp\". Not breve, Not dry, nothing but small capp. If you love cappuccinos as much as i do, then you will understand how horrible it was to sip on this monstrosity. After realizing that they used regular milk instead of breve i had to throw it away a block from my work.
