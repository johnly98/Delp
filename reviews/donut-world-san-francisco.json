It's the only decent donut shop in the area open at this time.\n\nCASH ONLY, so I tried to get cash from THEIR machine, and it did NOT dispense the cash that was charged to my card. (It already shows in my online banking system.)\n\nI spoke with the ladies there and they insisted that they are only workers, they can't help me, and to call the number listed. (Trying to get a number from them was a whole thing.)\n\nI walked out. I was nearly home when I realized that when I call my bank, it'll be a game of who said what.\n\nI walked back and asked for their names. They made such a fuss. Finally, Lilah gave up her name. I see her all the time because I'm happy to support a local business. I also told her she was not nice when she was trying to brush me off without really helping me. She then admitted that this happened often! (Just woww...)\n\nI tried to order something, and she insisted that they were closing. I asked if she wanted me to shut the door, and she said yes, because they were closing.\n\nOk--here's the crazy part--call it whatever you want--but I live across the street, right...\n\nNo more than two minutes was the door wide open, lights still on as fuhh, and well, I'm too blind rn to see the rest. \n\nI called them like a psycho mofo, asked for the manager, and guessssss wtf what? Lilah said that she's the manager! I asked who the owner was and she said the shop is in her late bro-in-law's name. I persisted, and she insisted that she's in charge of the shop.\n\nI confessed who I was, and she insisted that she was busy baking. Yoooo. I KNOW when sweet goodness is baking, and I know it doesn't happen here til at least 3am. I can't stand liars, and I'm so disappointed it's the manager of the biz of who I've supported for so long!\n\nI walked out, asked for a hug to make sure things are ok (yah, I'm a hugger, don't judge), and she declined--cuz she \"don't like me anyway.\"\n\nAll I could say was, \"Ok, I see how it is, I'll remember that.\"\n\nLong story short--don't try to play me in a game of bs.\n\nI'll let y'all know if I ever get my money back. So glad I didn't ask for the max from that damn machine, or I'd be out at least $200, and the manager wouldn't give a fuhh.", "author": "jolie L."}

You can see the quality of the jelly they use to help you feel out overall quality. Here the jelly and the custard was fine.\n\nThey went down quick - but keep in mind I like sugar.

So, on my way back home from the dentist's office, I stopped by Donut World.\n\nIt's your traditional, unpretentious, old-school donut shop.  Regular donuts are 75 cents each ($7 for a dozen), fancy donuts are $1.25-$1.50 apiece.  Donut holes are $1.50 a dozen.  Large coffee is $1.60.  Pretty standard prices.\n\nSo, I walk in around 9:30 am, grab a coffee pot and pour myself a large cup of Columbian coffee.  Finally, a small Filipino woman emerges from the back room.  Excited, I rattle off my standard donut shop order, like I have done more times than I care to admit: \"one jelly donut and a sesame seed bagel, lightly toasted, with a little bit of light cream cheese.\"  She listens to me very attentively, and then politely says, \"umm, sir, we don't sell bagels.\"  \n\nI wasn't prepared for that kind of a response.  What do I do now?  What do I do NOW???  Before I let myself have a panic attack on the corner on Judah St and 9th Ave, I took a deep breath and ordered a plain croissant instead.\n\nThe coffee was good, the donut was average.  The croissant was fresh, but too doughy and slightly under-baked (Is that a word?)

You could spend less than $3 and leave feeling very satisfied.  The donuts are not overly sweet and are very fresh. I finished two of the 5' and one 3' in a flash. (I'm still feeling guilty about having eaten too much and blame it on the Donut World!)  Definitely a place to bring friends from out of town to try their donuts as they taste much better than those at the chain stores.", "author": "Elle W."}

But, you know, sometimes I just have to have a donut and I have so few vices left.  They have a pretty fair variety to choose from here and the price is pretty good too although they're cheaper by the dozen (which is not a good thing).  I might have once gotten a hot dog here too many many many many years ago (might have been called something else but still was and maybe always has been a donut shop).  French crullers!  And plain old fashions without any glazing or frosting.  For some reason it takes me back to my childhood when we'd visit my grandparents in Los Angeles--we little kids would always wake up real early but had to remain quiet so our parents didn't wake up; grandma would pile us into her car and take us to this BIG donut place, in our pjs.  This way back before seat belts.  I don't remember eating the donuts she got but I do remember that big donut and the early morning runs in our pjs to go there.  It's just nice to have a donut shop in the neighborhood.", "author": "Kai T."}

Now I live in Sacramento, so I can't get my fix at 2am anymore. Nothing is open at 2am here! So, when I had to pick my sister up at SFO at 11pm one night, I stopped at Donut World and made up for lost opportunities and... ate an entire dozen! No, I'm kidding, but really I could go for some donuts right now. It's 10:30 and I know for a fact that I can't get a donut  right now anywhere in Sacramento!", "author": "Michael R."}

Sure it is not Rolling Pin Donuts in San Bruno which is superior in so many ways to the outside interlopers like Krispy Kreme. But a close second is Donut World, one of the few places to make a crumb donut that is great and is beyond NOT SUCKING, and has a maple series that is soooo good. Best of all coffee is cheap and good and it is open 24 hours. And, if they actually have it in stock, you should try their ham and cheese croissant. They are not super cheap but they are better than most of the stuff that's out there.", "author": "Greg D."}

I was hungry...  it was open.... Then I got my old favorite: The Chocolate Old Fashioned.  It was so damn good.  So soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the out and so sweet.  And I had to wash it down with milk and I never drink milk!   \nThen I got addicted.  And ate them once a week.  Tried to make a rationale reason to have one like, \"i'm getting my calcium intake from  drinking the milk.\"  Now I try to avoid this place, but it's so close to my apt!  The donuts here are irresistible- watch out.", "author": "A M."}

Before a 4 am snow trip, we stopped by here for some morning snacks...not only do they have a great selection of donuts/fritters/baked goods, they have Raspberry Peach Snapple to boot! (the BEST flavor of Snapple, imo). They've also got some single-serving size milk cartons also, which goes great with the donuts. I love the glazed twists and I tried the cinnamon roll/bun today. It was glazed with a hint of cinnamon and donut goodness baked right in.", "author": "erica w."}

I've tried the cinnamon crumb, rasberry jelly, and donut holes. The rasberry jelly is alright, a little too much jelly for my taste. I didn't like the donut holes much, way too sweet, but I never really liked donut holes anywhere. The cinnamon crumb is the best thing I've tried. The cinnamon crumbiness is so good! I've gotten cinnamon crumb the last 4 times I've came here. I want to try the apple fritter next time I come here, if I'm not enchanted by the cinnamon crumb once again!", "author": "Ale x."}

Must only be the night time ones that are way bad, or maybe I just hit a single bad night.  The old fashioned sprinkled were great.  The chocolate eclair-looking ones with custard were the only ones that were not so great since the custard tasted chemical-y.  Otherwise, good and inexpensive.", "author": "Quince P."}
