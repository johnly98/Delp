The prices are farily priced as well. I'm almost always here for breakfast and I'm super basic so I always get the morning special. It's a croissant with sausage, cheese and egg. The overall saltiness isn't offensive. They cook it on the spot so don't expect soggy croissant and a mush of egg, cheese, and sausage. I'm not here so much during lunch but I've gotten their stone bibimbop and I always want more! The crunchy, burnt pieces of rice at the bottom make the dish! You can't have bibimbop without it. \n\nService here is always great. I have yet to have an unpleasant experience. They've been nothing but warm and friendly, even when it's busy. \n\nAll in all, this isn't a restaurant so please don't come here expecting kiss-ass service and Michelin star food. To me, this place is comforting. It's a place that can be considered a part of your daily routine, or a \"usual\" place. The staff are all friendly and the food is fairly priced and delicious. If you come here expecting high end service from a place that serves home-y, comforting food, then I'm gonna bet you think the water is spicy too *hinthint looool. It's the perfect spot to stop for a quick meal to refuel.\n\nSuper a locally owned family business :)", "author": "Alex D."}

Rounding up from 2.5 stars because I respect family-run businesses, especially in a city with rent prices as high as SF.\n\nThe staff means well, but even during a less-than-busy hour, they all came off as impatient and unwilling to answer any questions. I felt rushed, and was surprised when the amount of the meal was much higher than what I'd expected based on the menu prices. I was also scoffed at by one of the chefs, which isn't exactly a great way to welcome a new customer. Half of the meal was inedible, as the salad and macaroni sides of the bento box were both drenched in mayonnaise-based sauces, which would have been nice to know via the menu, or when ordering.\n\nThe beef and rice were pretty well-cooked but warm instead of hot. Not a ton of flavor before calling in my old trusty friend, Mr. Sriracha.\n\nIf you just want quick service and a cafeteria style meal without any atmosphere, it's a decent spot. But I doubt I'd ever return based on this less-than-pleasant experience.", "author": "Andy L."}

I always get the combination bento box, with kalbi (short rib) and either chicken or bulgogi (beef), which comes with rice, salad, and macaroni salad. The kalbi is my favorite: the meat is tender while the tendon around the bone is chewier, and it's so flavorful. Normally I'd always choose beef over chicken, but honestly they grill the chicken so well that I could eat it all the time. I also really like the macaroni salad which is a little sweet and very refreshing - balances out the stronger flavors of the meat. I usually only finish 2/3 of the box, so $10 for 1.5 meals is a pretty good deal to me. \n\nThis family owned business has a very efficient turnover rate, even during busy lunch hours (and especially now that there is a construction site across the street), but they're so friendly and welcoming to their customers that you'd never know they were under pressure to put out all those orders. Whenever I come by myself, they always ask how my parents are doing, and I've heard them strike up conversations with other regulars as well.

This is the place to get that oomph. \n\nThe food is fast and you get plenty for what you pay.

I've had other items, but, in my opinion, their veggie burger is outstanding! The place doesn't have atmosphere. The prices are low. The quality is high. These owners want you to like their food so you'll come back. They are personable, and they really try to find a menu item that you'll like. I really appreciate their genuine care. The veggie burger is not random mix of items. To tell you the truth, I don't know all the flavors that they combine. I LOVE the taste. There is an ample amount of avocado, but the combination, to my palate, is just great! Sorry to be picky, but I abhor sandwiches that fall apart or that have an abundance of one substance in this corner, and another food item prevalent someplace else. I especially don't like it if \"the sauce\" is squeezed inconsiderately in globs. There is none of that mindless preparation in this burger! This sandwich is carefully made so that you get the same consistent tastes - a positive blend of tastes - with every bite . . . and the sandwich stays together. I don't get veggie burgers of this (consistent) fresh, delicious quality in other places. It means something to me that the owner cares that I think his veggie burger is outstanding! It's like they try harder the next time so that I'm not disappointed. They care! You don't need an expensive place, if you're going for a daily lunch, especially when the staff try hard to please you, like these kind people do. This is a favorite lunch place with friends of ours who are local. I have never been disappointed in anything I've eaten here, but I love their veggie burgers (better than I personally have eaten any place else). Considerate staff must attract considerate customers, because even though the seating is a little tight, it's a relaxed, restful atmosphere. (Reflects the smiling people behind the counter?!) Everything is clean, because they work at it! Even the windows are clean. The beautiful people - not just looks, but heart - make the experience all the better!", "author": "Ed R."}

No kimchee or tea comes with it. :( Perhaps they're served during dinner. I do appreciate that they trimmed off the fatty parts.

Everything I've purchased has been a generous portion and very very tasty.  Their menu is all over the place with chef salad to udon to korean bbq to salmon on fridays.  They have great soups too.  My co-worker lives for the chicken jambalaya.  Highly highly recommend this place for lunch.", "author": "Emily G."}

I was aimlessly walking around, looking for somewhere to eat lunch because I didn't want to be in the office and wanted to find somewhere new to eat.\n\nI've been back here almost every day since.\n\nThe Beef Rice bowl is the awesomeness.  Sandwiches are just ok.  I can't recommend straying from the rice bowls.", "author": "Robert L."}

This is a cute little mom and pop cafe that's been around for more than 10 years! I know this because I've been a patron for that long. I would highly recommend the BBQ chicken salad with the house dressing. All the ingredients are fresh and the chicken is hot off the grill. The tuna melt and the BBQ bowls are also great. I would also recommend their chocolate chip cookies. Ohhh the buttery goodness!", "author": "Minie J."}

How many times have you bought what looked to be a decadent brownie only to have it create  that icky paste in your mouth?  You know what I'm talking about....the cake-like dried out biscuit masquerading as a luscious, moist square of deliciousness.  Well these brownies are the perfect combination of chewy chocolate brownie with amazing frosting that isn't two sweet or cloying...my god.  \n\nI am going to get one now.  And thanks to the yelper who suggested using a container of both the house dressing and ranch for the grilled chicken salad...awesome.", "author": "Amber B."}

The staff is extremely friendly and while I've only been there a handful of times, recognizes me and also ensure that I \"have a good day\" when I leave. I HIGHLY recommend the Vegetable rice bowl. Call ahead and it's ready and waiting when you arrive. It has great tofu and generous vegetables. I used to be afraid of the hot sauce but now realize it's Sri Racha and delicious.

I really missed the great lunches I used to have there when I worked around the corner. When I drove by and saw a parking space yesterday, I grabbed it.  Steve and his wife were behind the counter as always and I was so glad I stopped. Can you believe they remembered me from 2006?  What a wonderful lunch! I eat out every day at work and sometimes find it hard to get a decent sandwich, much less something that is beautifully made and tastes wonderful. The club sandwich filled the bill. Also got a bowl of soup and a ham/pasta salad for dinner. Spent $15 (including tip) and ate well all day. Boy, do I miss this great cafe! I'm going to make it part of the week to stop in and get properly fed. Thanks, Pacific Plaza Cafe!", "author": "Linda B."}

I just wish they used better bread! I asked for sourdough, but the bread resembled Wonder Bread more than anything.

It's only $5.50!  so simple, but perfect for me (almost) everyday that I work nearby....which is about how often I eat it.

The Korean BBQ is also very good.
