The mayor only described the location of where to meet him and they assumed it was the hip and popular brunch place that just opened. While they're waiting in a really, really long line to eat pancakes, they find out that the mayor wanted to meet them at some unhip cafe next door that served the same pancakes with no line or people in it.\n\nComing to this place reminded me of that episode. I was walking down Valencia and bypassed going to Ritual Coffee Roasters for the very reason that there was a very line out the door a block away from Javalencia versus one person hanging out on his laptop here, soon to be two. This place serves the good spicy chai it always has, similar to Ritual, and I get a entire window seat and table overlooking Valencia. Try that at Ritual and you'll have people pecking their beaks at you. \n\nThis place has been around forever and I remember my lack of appreciation to plain distain for it because it was so oldschool that it didn't offer wifi at the time. If I would have reviewed this place when I first joined Yelp in 2007, I probably would given it 2 stars. But now that I am 33 instead of 22, this place makes me feel like I time-traveled because most of the pictures are still left unhanged, and what I thought was griminess at 22 is just the collective scuffs from years of wear and lack of a paint job. So now I appreciate a facade that is as faded as it was in 2004, which tells me there was never any selling out. Someone did add wifi over the tides of time though.", "author": "Chris G."}

When I questioned the price increase, the staff told me it was $3.25 and they couldn't change it on the CHALK board but somehow they could on their register. \nAfter buying our drinks, I went to use the restroom and found out it was \"out of service.\" They had no signs indicating that and it was most of the reason we went to the coffee shop. Staff offered no alternatives and I felt cheated out of $7. I had to go back into the rain holding a coffee cup and searching frantically for another place.

A new person (woman with glasses) helped me last time and she was very unfriendly. First, she just ignored me even though she was 2 feet away from me on the other side of the counter and I was clearly standing at the register to order. After I asked for her to help me, she seemed annoyed and then completely overwhelmed that I asked for no lettuce, sprouts or onions on my sandwich. She wanted me to list what I did want on it, so I referred her to their own menu bigger than life on the wall behind her and said I want the other ingredients for this sandwich. She asked me again what I didn't want and appeared to be writing it down this time. As she was typing my order into the register I asked for a receipt. She totally ignored this request and walked away. I asked again and she seemed very bothered and I got a receipt for just my sandwich but not my drink. I gave up. Then, as I was in the middle of meeting with my client there in a deep conversation she yelled from the counter to ask what I didn't want on my sandwich.

The art on the walls (for sale) makes for a good atmosphere. What else do you need?", "author": "Ivo P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-09", "description": "Unlike some of the other reviewers, I don't have much to say about the ambiance; I only get to-go stuff for lunch. But for $5.00, it's hard to beat the sandwiches. I usually get a baked ham and swiss cheese sandwich, and there's so much, I eat half and take the other half home and use the ham and cheese in an omelette the next morning. For an extra fifty cents, you can get avocado, but if you're not a fan of sprouts, make sure you tell them \"hold the sprouts,\" or they'll pile them like they do everything else. Javalencia is just next to Dogeared Books, and it's nice to browse the discount book stalls on the sidewalk while my sandwich is being made. Altogether basic, consistent, and good.", "author": "J M."}

My soy latte tasted like vanilla chalk without a hint of espresso, but I could have seen that coming since there was only one other person in there. At least the Vitamin Water I got along with it was good. Always count on pre-packaged items.", "author": "Alex C."}

Coffee was priced right, cookies were good, big and nicely priced.  I will definitely be back. ps.  My 1yr old spent the whole time pushing her stroller in a circle and everyone found this to be very entertaining.", "author": "Sheila K."}
