Once you walk in, you'll see that it's a big banquet hall with some old school colorful lighting. Weekends can get pretty packed, but we were able to get seated pretty quickly (less than 5 minutes). Once seated, the dim sum carts all seem to rush over and offer various dim sum. It is a bit difficult to find the prices for each dish (I think there may be a menu of most of the items on some tables?), but I thought our overall bill was very reasonable. Expect to pay around $10-20/ person after tax and tip and they even take credit cards.\n\nIt's nice to get to eat inside and avoid some of the hustle and bustle on pacific in Chinatown, and don't be afraid to say no to the offerings as the plates can add up fast. \n\nMy favorite dim sum here was the jin deui (sesame ball) and char siu (roast pork). Wasn't able to try any of the noddle or soup items, but from I did try, the dim sum can be hit or miss as some dishes may have just been made or sitting on the carts for a bit. They also served hot Jasmine tea with actual tea leaves, not bagged, which is always great.\n\nI have to say it is pretty convenient to come in here, get served almost immediately, and gaze at all the appetizing food as it passes you by, and pick out food to share with your table mates.", "author": "Kenny L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-06", "description": "New Asia is my gold standard for dim sum restaurants.  And, no, I'm not referring to the value of precious metals; I'm talking about the glitzy, gaudy decor - gold pillars, crystal chandeliers, multi-color LED lights - that seems to characterize these culinary relics of a bygone era.  That shiny veneer belies expensive, mediocre food.  Even so, it's a popular stop for locals and tourists alike.\n\nAt New Asia, you're likely paying more for experience - large banquet hall filled with people speaking Cantonese and middle-aged ladies pushing dim sum carts - than quality food.  Prices are high compared to places I've grown accustomed to in SGV and HK, and you should expect to pay $5+ per dish. If you order noodle dishes off the regular menu, you're looking at $14-20 per plate.  Food tends to be inconsistent: it can be perfectly cooked or disgustingly greasy depending on the day and time.  Stick to your favorites, and you'll likely make it out without a stomachache or headache.  Whatever you do, don't look in the kitchen!  On our most recent visit, we ordered five dishes ($40 incl. tax and tip).  The winning dish was undoubtedly the Peking duck - worth the high price for a nice mix of savory and sweet.\n\nThe downside to coming to a restaurant with dim sum carts is that they may run out of your chosen item before the dim sum ladies finish their rounds.  Exhibit B: my steamed char siu bao was the bun that got away.  Most staff speak at least some English, but don't be surprised if your request for water goes ignored by busboys.  You can pay with cash or card, but you'll need to flag down a waiter to get your bill totaled and processed.  Observation: the lady manning the register / cash box has been there for ages!\n\nI'm not sure why my family has continued to visit New Asia for the past three decades even as quality has declined and value has decreased.

The dim sum was just not up to par. As a chinese person that grew up eating at hole-in-the-wall places and don't exactly have the highest standards to begin with, even this was disappointing. The flavors and textures I've grown to love in dim sum was just lacking from the overall meal. They also kept pushing food that no body wants and was all getting cold.

Other dim sums I've been to usually give me jasmine as a default. I think my experience here was a little less than below average.

Wow - a SF institution that is still going strong... observed at least from my Dim Sum visit on a Tuesday.  \n\nThe Dim Sum quality varies from plate to plate, some greasy, some pristine, some that have been on a cart too long, and others just right out of the kitchen.  Ladies push carts around and hawk plates of:\n- Har Guow (hope you're not allergic to Shrimp), \n- Siu Mai, Pai Guet (Tasty Steamed Black Bean Garlic Pork Riblets),\n- Char Siu Bau (Surprisingly good Baked Pork Bun), \n- Don Tot (I like Portuguese Egg Tarts more than these Egg Tarts), \n- Siu Long Bau (Stick to a Mandarin Restaurant to get these), \n- Fong Jow (Chicken Feet falls apart in your mouth like it should!),\n\nWhile others carry around bigger and more expensive dishes of:\n- Long Ha Geen Mein (Lobster Noodle was $20 and luke warm),\n- Chow Mein,\n- Sill Gee Yook (Roast Pork Belly),\n- Ho Yo Gai Lan (Need Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce to clear the palette)\n  \nThe dishes are tasty, a bit expensive compared to other smaller Dim Sum joints in Chinatown.  They also charge for tea.  But hey, this place is like China or Hong Kong - lots and lots of middle to older age Chinese diners gossiping, meeting friends, reading the paper, sipping tea - thus gotta charge for tea as they're taking up a spot.

By the time the first plate arrived (2 loooong hours after the start of the ceremony), the whole restaurant was literally famished...I've never heard a Chinese restaurant be quite so quiet - haha.\n\nI digress, back to the food.\n\nAppetizer - an assortment dish of steamed chicken, peking duck, bbq pork, jellyfish, and seaweed salad. It was a nice upgrade from the regular cold sliced meats, jellyfish, and random maraschino cherries.\n\nSoup - water/cornstarch/white pepper thickened \"broth\" but was generously filled with crab claw meat, bay scallops, and fish maw. We pretty much just scooped out the contents.\n\nFried Fish Balls - juicy with a nice crunch. They were also pretty large, about the size of a child's fist. If you are not a fan of preserved fruit peels though, it does have a bit of that flavor which can be a little offputting. \n\nFried Shrimp - probably my favorite dish of the night. The prawns were large and fully deveined (unheared of in a Chinese restaurant) then tossed in a delicious sesame/ginger/soy reduction.\n\nBlack Pepper Lamb Chops - the lamb was very fresh and tender. Didn't have much of a gamey taste (my table thought it was beef until I said otherwise). The steamed vegetables still had a good crunch to them which was impressive given the volume they had to cook.\n\nCrispy Skin Chicken - chicken was done perfectly. Super juicy on the inside and a nice thin crispy skin on the outside. My grandmother did complain about the size (given the cost of the banquet dinner).\n\nGoose Feet and Sea Cucumber over Napa - probably one of the least impressive dishes of the night. The goose feet weren't fried first so it had a really weird smooth texture that couldn't even hold onto the sauce. The sea cucumber was also overdone - mushy to the point of no return. The napa was decent, but you could tell they didn't really bother to pick out leaves that were aged (many pieces were covered in black dots or were bitter).\n\nSea Bass - usually the best dish every time this event rolls around, but it was overcooked this time. Luckily it's steamed so it doesn't dry out, but it's also not great when it's borderline mushy/soggy. \n\nAlmond Cookies/Lotus Mochi with Coconut Flakes - the mochi was uneven. Some pieces were all pounded rice while others were way too heavy on lotus paste. But the almond cookies were good and chewy.\n\nGiven they had to accommodate over 75 tables with the same set meal, the quality was really impressive this time.

We could choose several types of tea. I do not remember what the options were.\n\nThe table was not too clean. I noticed little black smudges on my tea cup and chopsticks.\n\nMy boyfriend said that it was interesting how  one waitress addressed us as \"handsome young man\" and \"beautiful lady\" in Mandarin.\n\nI ended up ordering the Steamed Bean Curd with Oyster Sauce ($4.40) and Steamed Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf ($5.20). My boyfriend got the Steamed Spare Ribs in Black Bean Sauce ($4.40). \n\nThe waitresses told me that the bean curd and sticky rice dish both had only chicken in it. For meat, I typically just stick with eating chicken. When I cut the sticky rice dish in half, I saw Chinese pork sausages in it. The bean curd also had pork along with a mixture of other ingredients inside. I feel like the waitresses had no clue what is in some of the dishes they were serving. This place is not great if you have dietary restrictions or if you are vegetarian. \n\nIt took a long time to flag down the waitresses. When we were about to pay, one of them asked if we could pay with cash instead of credit card. She then said that we could give her a smaller tip if we pay by cash. It was really confusing. Our total meal added to $17.90 and at first we gave her a 20 dollar bill. She then quickly said we didn't have to pay her anymore and told us we could go and not to worry about it even though we ended up undertipping. \n\n$17.90 does seem like a lot for three small dishes and tea/\"sitting down\" fee.

Thankfully, we didn't eat the whole thing or else.. Then we just kept eating the rest of the other dishes. The food was just okay some was under-seasoned. I would have been okay with coming again but because I got served something that was raw, I was very displeased. It could have been that we came around closing time but still does not justify this.

And it will definitely be my last. This was probably one of the worst, if not the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. The food might be barely acceptable, but the service and attitude of the staff was horrid. Usually, when a customer finds an insect in there food or beverage the staff should be cordial and respectful as possible, while they remedy the situation. But instead of this approach, the manager was abrasive and blunt and kept on asking in Chinese \"Well what do you want to do about it?\", putting aside the fact that after I discovered the cockroach in my tea and had already vomited twice, his tone disgusted me enough to want to vomit a third time. His attitude made it seem like the patron was wrong for finding the cockroach! And that I should have just swallowed it and accepted the gift. In the end they very reluctantly offered to cover the expenses of the meal, but my friend and I turned them down and  paid anyways because my friend and I couldn't stomach their generosity.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-10-15", "description": "Zero Stars\n\nA legacy location.  Built by the legendary Robert Yick, this was once the infamous Asia Garden.  Two levels of banquet space.  Premier cuisine for the most discriminating palate.  Truly, a palace for a royal feast.  Once designed to compete for Wedding Banquets where no cost was spared.  Chinatown was once the hub of the Chinese community banquet business, where extended family and friends number into the hundreds.  \n\nDim sum carts are still being used.  Food kept hot on carts equipped with burners, steamers, and miniature griddles to fry & crisp dishes at tableside.  You don't have to speak the language, or even know what you're getting.  If it looks good, accept it.  One could easily communicate with motions and gestures.  \n\nDim sum cart service is becoming a thing of the past.  Dim sum carts require the kitchen to make food before it's even ordered.  Then the food is presented, in hopes that it will sell.  The restaurant has to have good food, in order to keep a steady stream of customers coming in, to consume the product, and keep everything fresh.  You also need space for these carts to turn and move.  By eliminating the carts, you get more seating in your dining room, food is made to order and waste is minimized.    \n\nToday, it's faded grandeur.  Badly in need of everything.\n\nThe food is bad.  Everywhere you look in Chinatown, there are take-out dim sum joints for the same steamed dumplings and buns.  All are lackluster at best.  In order to get good dim sum, you have to leave Chinatown.  Sad.  \n\nInstead of stepping up their game, and serving food that is fresh, they ave stooped to cost cutting measures in order to compete with the discount market.  Yank Sing has nothing to worry about.\n\nApparently, even the banquet business has taken a downturn.  To make up for the loss, evenings are now a ballroom dance session for seniors.  \n\nDid I mention how bad the food was? Xiao Long Bao in a tin foil cup was obviously frozen from a supplier; wrapper was hardened, appearance was deflated, wrappers stuck to tin foil, and stuffing was greasy and devoid of broth and flavor.  Har gow wrappers were mushy, stuck to each other, stuck to wax paper liner in basket, fell apart as I tried to pick it up with chopsticks, and the stuffing had fishy odor of bad seafood.  Siu mai had the look, texture, and taste of something from a freezer bag.  \n\nThe service is even worse than the food.  Dim sum cart pushers wander by, gazing into space, mumbling, and completely ignore the guest seated at the tables.  You have to waive, yell, and flag them down to get one to stop to serve you.  Sesame rolls were stacked sideways on a cart to minimize space, with plates wrapped in cling plastic, and the server simply put the plate on our table and walked off without removing the plastic film.  What kind of restaurant serves food in Saran Wrap?  Nobody checks on the tables.  Dirty dishes are not bussed, tea is not refilled, water is not offered, and they will not give you extra napkins or clean plates.  \n\nThe floor in the entire restaurant is covered in a film of grease.  I'm wearing rubber soled shoes, and slipping.  Is it better to have a greasy floor, as opposed to a sticky floor?  Why not clean the floors?  Especially the stairs that you have to go up & down to get to the 2nd floor bathrooms.  The bathrooms stink.  As I was using the urinal, a woman came in with a household broom, which she used to push around a was of dirty paper towel sheets, and actually hit my foot with it as I was peeing.  Where did she get those from?  Since paper towels are not offered in the bathroom for the customers.  \n\nNever mind that if you don't speak Chinese here, you are out of luck.  Knowing the local dialect doesn't help.  Forget that the wallpaper is peeling, and a quick look into the prep area and kitchen as you're going to the bathroom reveals that cleanliness, health, and food safety are not a priority.  So what, if nobody cares about the customers because their personal conversations trump the scope of their job duties?  \n\nAsk for the check.  The person bringing to you will tell you that you have to tip.  Different person picks up the check, looks at the check, looks at the currency, then tells you that you have to tip.  Another person brings your change, and reiterates that they want you to tip.\n\nWhat the F*ck is that?  I have never been anywhere that the workers tell you to tip.  What the Fuc* am I tipping for?  The bad service?  No.  There was no service.  Am I tipping because they are rude enough to demand a tip?  F*ck You!  Go up to the front. The old lady at the cashier station who collects all the money, suddenly doesn't speak English.\n\nA tip is optional.  Tipping is for good service.  I tip very generously where the service is good.  Funny, in a good establishment, the servers never have to tell anyone to tip.  Tipping is not required by law.  \n\nDid I mention that Yank Sing has nothing to worry about here?", "author": "Barry M."}

I'm Chinese so I think I know a thing or two about dimsum and Chinese cuisine.\n\nNew Asia has awesome dimsum! This is my favorite dimsum restaurant in San Francisco. The best part of the dining experience is that they have push cart dimsum service (side note: a lot of places in SF doesn't have push cart service). Not only do they have dimsum from their push carts, you can order specialty dishes like fried noodles, fried rice, roast duck, etc. from any of the servers. The staff here speaks Chinese so you can order in Chinese which is great but for those who don't speak Chinese, they speak English as well. Everyone here is quick and operate as a very efficient team. \n\nWhen you first enter the restaurant, you'll notice that they have two floors and that all the tables are full. Immediately to your side is a large waiting area with chairs. Make sure to get a number before waiting for a table! Once you have it, you'll be sitting among others anxiously waiting to be called. Great time to think about all the wonderful dishes you're about to devour. If you look to the side, you'll notice they have roast duck, char siu and other meats hanging. Behind that is a butcher working hard to fill the specialty meat orders. Try their roast duck if you have a chance, it's very good. \n\nThis is a great spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. I enjoy coming here and actually crave their dimsum every time I'm in Chinatown SF. You will need to find street parking or you can garage park around the area. Make sure to read all the street signs before parking! Some signs are very confusing. Ask if you are uncertain! Better safe than sorry. If you go up Pacific, you can park in a garage on the right just before the restaurant. Overall, this is the spot to check out if you want Chinese food in Chinatown SF!", "author": "Daniel C."}

My parents (the OG dim sum eaters) told me to give this place a try, and wow I wasn't disappointed. It has taken me a lot longer than it should to get into New Asia though -- I've tried on countless random nights to eat there, only to be detained by the fact that the entire restaurant was booked out, or I came too late, etc. But the SO and I finally made it in around 1pm this past Saturday.\n\nFirst thing you notice -- this restaurant is HUGE relative to most places in Chinatown. It might be as large as some of the major establishments, but it's laid out almost as a giant rectangle, so the largeness of the place is super evident. Anyways, we were seated pretty much instantly, which I love because a) I hate waiting in dim sum lines and b) it is literally impossible to get good dim sum in this city during prime lunch time without a line. So that was one major surprise for me.\n\nSecond thing, New Asia does dim sum the in my opinion, right way -- with the carts! A lot of Chinatown dim sum eateries also make you do the checking off a menu thing (presumably for space restrictions), but it's just so much more satisfying to see your food roll by rather than just checking it off a piece of paper and not realizing what you want until you see it. Once you get seated, it doesn't take more than a minute for a cart with some yummy dim sum to roll by.\n\nFood wise, there were definitely some hit and miss dishes in the typical dim sum cannon. \nHits: \nPi dan sou rou zhou (my pin ying is not great, but hopefully this makes sense) aka preserved egg and meat congee -- like WOW. This is some of the best form of this congee I've had in the city. Honestly I'd come back just for this because it's a pretty staple dish for me in dim sum\nSiu mai -- how can you not get this? Large and tasty.\n\nMisses:\nSpare ribs in black bean sauce -- sad. This is a pretty classic dish, and this just didn't taste very good at all. It lacked flavor.\nBeef noodle rolls - meh, I didn't love these. Will try out the shrimp ones next time I'm back. \n\nThe place is definitely pricey, but it's SF so I guess it's normal. Each dish we got was about $5, but given the quality, I was pretty happy. Plus, \"pricey\" in Chinatown standards is still a $30 lunch for 2 which is great by SF standards. \n\ntldr; probably one of my top dim sum places in Chinatown... would def get the preserved egg and pork congee", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Visiting SF from DC, we were really excited to be walking around a real Chinatown. For those who don't know, DC's Chinatown is completely westernized with maybe ONE half decent Chinese restaurant. SF's Chinatown was a blast for us craving some authentic sights and smells. We wandered the streets for a bit and checked out a few other restaurants and bakeries, but eventually we were suckered by the crowd and overall vibe of New Asia. When we showed up, the hostess was handing out numbers to people in line and aggressively yelling in a microphone. The crowd was primarily Chinese people, and the general vibe made me nostalgic of the time I've spent in China/HK. We were seated pretty quickly for noon on a Saturday. Ladies came around in carts and were surprisingly polite was we chose our food. Maybe it was because we spoke mandarin to them.

I felt bad for the staff running around sweating.  The food on carts came around pretty frequently.  But after a few rounds, it's the same stuff circulating around.  We ordered a few favourites shortly after seated such as har gow and rice roll with beef.  The har gow was good with lots of plump shrimp in it but the other food wasn't as impressive.\n\nAlthough the staff are running around, they aren't consistent with the service as we asked for water and needed refills and we could barely get anyone to stop at our table.  For 4 people, our bill was just over $50 but there were no prices on the card they stamp. \n\nThe washroom looked like it hadn't been serviced since my last visit 8 years ago.  They are upstairs but there's one wheelchair accessible one downstairs (the door was so dirty and black, I wouldn't want to see the inside).  Upstairs washroom was dirty, small, and barely any soap.  \n\nDefinitely needs an update, maybe when I return in 8 years, it might look better.  Then again, maybe not.", "author": "Violet P."}

I have no idea how it compares to some of the other authentic places in the city but to me it's always delicious. \n\nI never expect good service because I am clearly the minority so it doesn't bother me that no one asks me what I want to drink. Plus I like the green tea! \n\nYou order things as they are flying off of the dozens of carts throughout the restaurant. This time they had a menu on the table and we were able to point to specific items we were looking for and although they didn't confirm understanding a few minutes later the dishes would arrive straight from the kitchen! \n\nYou have to be adventurous and willing to try different dishes to truly enjoy this spot. We ate what felt like a millions dishes between us three girls and still spent under $50! \n\nThe bill will not be in English, there's not any pricing so just trust in them and relax! \n\nAre there better places in San Fran?

My cousins were parking, and they were so shocked that I had gotten a table that quickly.\n\nFood was DELICIOUS. This place is spacious and packed like crazy (as to be expected of a dim sum establishment), and there's always servers walking around pushing their carts of food. Even though the staff seems to mainly speak Cantonese, you should be able to communicate if you speak Mandarin, and their English was decent.

The place is huge with wall to wall tables in the main dining room and plenty of tables upstairs as well. We arrived around 11am on a Sunday and were seated right away for our party of 5 upstairs. First impression is your typical dim sum joint in SF Chinatown. Loud, busy as hell and could use a little bit... well, actually a whole lot of cleaning. \n\nThe har gow was ok but it was sticking to the paper in the bamboo container. That tells me that the dumpling encasing it was undercooked. Not cool. The siu mai was good. I liked it. The taro cake was good. The short ribs in black bean sauce was good. The lobster chow mein was good but really rich. The char siu bao was good. I was bummed I didnt see any bbq pork buns, foil-wrapped chicken and crab claws. There were other things on carts we passed on like the jook and egg rolls.\n\nService wasnt bad. It was hurried but that's normal. They need to clean the place up.

There were probably 200 customers and maybe all but a dozen were born in Asia.  It looks like a restaurant in China.  I wonder if the fire marshal and health department have inspected recently.  We expected authentic Chinese dim sum.  \n\nPortions are very generous, but flavor is barely OK.  Many of us were nauseated a after eating there.  Don't know if the stuffiness of the restaurant contributed to our malaise or if it was the food.  The management hung multiple fans along the rear wall with exposed electrical cords attached to the walls.\n\nSix of us had dim sum for $80 including tax and tip but we did not eat a lot.  I had little appetite for the food\n\nThe restaurant is packed with people and very noisy.  \nServers kept pushing us to order more.  When we said we were full, three different ones tried to push us to get food to go.\n\nIt's really packed with Chinese speaking customers, so I think many people like their food.  \n\nIf you want to experience China without the hassles of international travel, this might be a good choice.  The streets outside are packed with people, including many smokers.  The one big difference is the air does not have the damp musty smell of Asia.", "author": "Joanna S."}

They produce the check and we gave them our visa they quickly came back with two or three people I can't remember telling us that their visa machine was down, we had no idea what to do or what they wanted from us. None of them had a very qualified English speaking skills but they continuously directed us to the ATM outside telling us cash only cash only. No one had mentioned this was a cash only business when we got there or else we would've made sure to have grab cash first. I went up to the front desk to see if I could talk to someone who is reasonable because the three at the table seem confused and unclear as how to handle a situation as well. I went up to the front desk to be greeted by an equally as grumpy and equally poor English skills and all she could manage to say to us was just repeating over and over cash ATM outside visa is not working. At the time there was over 150 people in the restaurant and I could not understand how they expected everyone in there to have only cash on them, ( was it only us?) ( we were the only Caucasian people in there) (racism??)it did not make sense to me and things started to feel wrong with the whole situation. My husband and I started to walk towards the door to go to the ATM to get them their money as we had repeatedly told them OK OK we will go get money from ATM like they continued to tell us and point to the door ,as soon as we started to walk towards the door a giant man stood in front of my husband attempting to block him from leaving, because apparently they had had some idea that they were going to hold one of us hostage while the other person was sent to the ATM again this all felt very staged and planned. We were in this establishment for length of at least 45 minutes to an hour and we did not see one person escorted out of the restaurant to get cash for this business ( racism??) who is claiming that their visa machine had suddenly \"broke down\" then as attitudes began to escalate very quickly because we have never been treated in such away by strangers let alone upper management of a highly populated tourism spot in Chinatown. This giant Asian man proceeded to follow us all the way to our ATM walking through Chinatown yelling And cursing at us in his language while he was followed around by another short little Asian man wearing a long black trenchcoat he was a very frightening person as well (mafia??$) as the tall Asian gentleman followed us through Chinatown arguing with us he had told us that this just happened the moment he went to use our card, but then a few minutes later during argument told us that he had been following people to the ATM all day to get their money from them (??? So which one was it ???) ( SCAM )( SCAMMING THE GOVERNMENT??) ( TAX EVASION??)

When I went a few years ago for dim sum, I got the bill and paid cash (cash only). Anyways, I picked up the change and I was getting ready to put a tip down and before I could put any money down the waitress yelled at me for taking money off the table. Wow. So I put a ten percent tip down cause they really didn't do anything. It's all push carts. When I put ten percent down she yelled at me again and told me how much more of a tip to put down. Because of this I swore I would never come here again. Don't like it when people yell at me for tips. Not cool at all. \n\nAnyways, I had to come here again for my father-in-laws 90's birthday. Four tables on a Saturday night. They had a wedding banquet and another party at the same time. Food was at best the worst Chinese food I've ever ate in SF Chinatown. I'm thinking the Panda Express is better. Soup was terrible. Not sure what kind but my wife didn't even eat it. This was a first for her. Also, scallops were sour which means they were spoiled and the lobster wasn't firm which meant it was under cooked. Even with a banquet with four tables, they required cash only. Terrible. \n\nI really don't like this place. Food wasn't very good. Service wasn't good. Someone told me the Chinese waiters were cussing at each other while serving the food (I don't speak Chinese so i don't know). Cash only. I will never go back unless forced again. There is too many good places to eat so no more chances for this place. Good luck if you go here.", "author": "Doug T."}

Just keep your head down, point to what you want, and eat. For you picky, special needs eaters, you won't last 5 min here so don't even think about it.\n- Chicken feet.

I was disappointed to see the food safety warning on Yelp that this place scored in the bottom 5% of San Francisco restaurants (and Uber loves to brag about how well they take care of their drivers) but I'm a sucker for a good deal and free is free.  Yelp said vegetarian options were available so I figured with Chinese food a vegan like me would be able to make do. Unfortunately they had a set menu with nothing vegan, or vegetarian on it.  So when the food started coming out I asked a server if there was anything vegan/vegetarian and I could tell he didn't really understand but he indicated that he would ask someone else. A few minutes later I saw him motion towards me to another server who looked but then just carried on with what she was doing. Several minutes later I was able to get her attention as she was walking by and asked her the same question, she seemed to understand after a couple rounds and headed back towards the kitchen.  After about 20 to 30 more minutes watching them carry plates of food to all the other tables I got up and asked her again and she waved me off and walked away a few feet and made some sort of indication that made it seem like I should talk to this other guy next to her, who told me no and all that was available was what was on the set menu. I was pretty upset at this point and as she tried to avoid listening to me I complained I had been waiting for half an hour and she could have just told me no in the first place. The other guy could understand why I was upset and ready to leave and tried to assure me that they had plenty of vegetarian menu items but after he talked to the manager it was again a NO but finally at least with an apology. \nSad. \nWith their health department record though, perhaps I lucked out.", "author": "Paul P."}

Some reviews say that New Asia is the BEST in terms of dim sum in this neighborhood. BUT they also fail to mention that most of the near by restaurants have been closed down for business. New Asia is probably the ONLY big restaurant that's still open. So if BEST is equivalent to ONLY or best out of a very limited list, then I guess. \n\nI'll commend New Asia for still serving their dim sum by ladies pushing carts, they're one of the very few restaurants who still employ this old fashion method. With that said, in order for this method to be efficient, dim sum has to circulate around the WHOLE restaurant, not just around the entrance of the kitchen or down the center aisle.\n\nThis is where New Asia completely failed. My family was UNFORTUNATE enough to be seated along the side of the wall. For 25 minutes, the same ladies pushing the cart of buns walked past us at least 5 times while everything else that came out of the kitchen never even went by us. When we requested for specific dishes, we were just told  that they would be out shortly. The problem was that when it came out, it was served directly to the tables sitting by the entrance of the kitchen. So while all the center tables had tons of dishes, the other side of the restaurant either had none or sparse dishes. \n\nFast forward to after we voice our complaints to several bus boys and waiters, they start having ONE person serve from our side of the restaurant rather than just the center. Since all the tables around us were pretty much neglected, EVERYONE called dibs on everything and anything in that one cart. It's a rather peculiar (humorous)  feeling to witness all these grown adults yelling at the dim sum lady to ensure they get food...\n\nSome of the dishes were cold (I think STEAMED anything should be at LEAST warm), service was very lacking to say the least, dishes & overall cleanliness of the place was very questionable, inefficient dissemination of food, extremely pricey for the quality of food, the list can go on.\n\nIn summary, this place was a total waste of time & money.", "author": "Ada C."}

The carts, the tea, the hot Asian waiter who wants to personally feed me some Xiao Long Bao...\n\nFinally, almost about to give up, we found \"New Asia Chinese Restaurant.\" I was dazzled by the ceiling chandlers, so my family and I got our number (71) and played the waiting game. The lady told us \"20 minutes\" but we only waited for 10 at most~it was very busy, which I assume is normal for them. \n\nWe were sat in the far back by two very kind, very loud, very annoying families. There is no leg room here for sure, they certainly tried to utilize EVERY inch of this place. What's funny is that there is a whole second floor that they don't use~they have tables up there and everything. I guess they just never thought of a good way to get carts up and down their stairs?  \n\nFood: Their Xiao Long Bao (or soup dumplings) were meh. I personally feel that their dough was too thin because the soup kept spilling out when you picked it up. Even when I picked it up all Asian like (by pulling it by the tip and catching it with the spoon). Every other dish was pretty meh also. Some things (like their shrimp balls) tasted like they came out of a box~which they probably did. \n\nService: I didn't get the hot waiter who wanted to feed me, but we did get an attitudinal Asian guy who couldn't wait to throw us in the corner and leave. What really bugs me about dim sum places are that they charge you for tea. Back in China, dim sum places are sometimes called \"tea houses\" where you go to drink really nice tea and eat small dishes (like dim sum). Here in the states they charge you for a 6 dollar box of tea that they got from the shop down the street from them because they can market off the tourists/off the fact that this isn't China. \n\nThis is honestly as good as it gets in SF Chinatown. \n\nOur family of 6 spent 72 dollars after tax.", "author": "Cindy M."}

You may have a wait, but don't give up your meal will be worth it and the staff moves quickly. They are a well oiled machine. The dining room reminded me of my elementary school lunchroom times 5.\n\nSeated in a giant open hall with at least 50 round tables of diners you'll need to keep your eyes peeled so that your favorite dish doesn't pass you by. \n\nTry everything and come hungry!", "author": "Sarah Rachael W."}

My sister had her wedding banquet her way back... and we used to go here for dim sum twice a month growing up.Twenty years or so later, my family and I were in SF and decided to do a little dim sum and decided to come here. \n\nUnlike many of the dim sum restaurants which now have an ordering sheet at the table (you pick out what you want and they bring it to you), New Asia is more traditional. They have dim sum in carts that come around, and you pick out what you want, and then they stamp the little piece of paper on your table. Depending on the size of the dish you ordered, as well as the price of the item, the stamp goes on a different place on the sheet. For example, there is a section for small dishes, medium size dishes, large dishes, specialty dishes, etc. Then when they ring you up, they count the number of stamps on each section to get to the final bill.\n\nA note about this place - if you want the check - you need to flag down one of the guys in black vests. They will not always know that you want the bill, so it is better to be proactive and flag them down. If you are not Chinese, this may be considered rude behavior, but this is par for the course in a Chinese restaurant.\n\nA second tip - if you need more water for your tea, simple open the lid of the tea pot. Someone will see that and they will come by and grab your teapot and bring it back refilled with water. This is just standard practice in a large dim sum place where they are so busy running around it might be hard to flag them down all the time.\n\nThis place is huge, and packed. Best bets if you don't want to wait in line is to go closer to 1 pm. If you go between 11:30 and 1, it's going to be crowded and you may have to wait in line.\n\nOverall, the dim sum as you expected - some were fantastic.. others were a little greasy, but overall tasty and fresh. the steamed items were our favorites (like har gow, siu mai, flat noodles, etc.). The fried items weren't as greasy as I had expected, and were quite tasty. The BBQ pork buns can be hit or miss, and it really depends on how long they have been sitting there. In general, you can't really screw it up.\n\nIn addition to the usual dim sum items, there are a couple of carts of stuff you don't always see - one is a cart of noodles (lobster lo mein, and other fried noodles). These are more specialty dishes and are more expensive. You could probably feed 4 to 5 off one of these dishes. A second item is a porridge on a cart that comes around. Recommended if you like rice soup.\n\nA word about service - this is a large tea house. So you can't expect top notch attentive service. If you want service, you need to flag down the carts (especially if they are going to skip your table), or the guys in the black vests for things like water, tea, your bill, etc. As long as you know to do that, service is ok.\n\nSomeone else mentioned bathrooms - first - restrooms in Chinese restaurants are usually dirty. If the restaurant is any good, they're too busy cooking and not enough time cleaning bathrooms. There is a large bathroom upstairs at the top of the stairs  for men and women. It's relatively clean by Chinese restaurant standards. There is a second uni-sex bathroom on the first floor as well, ideal for people who have trouble climbing stairs. This is a smaller one and you may have to wait to use it.\n\nWhile I am at - might as well say something about parking.. first, there are a couple of garages I would park at - the Portsmouth Square garage on Kearney (between Clay and Washington) is a good choice and usually you can get a spot. The other garage I would recommend is the St Mary's Garage (on California between Kearney and Grant). There are two closer garages (the one on Pacific/Broadway between Grant and Stockton), and the one by the police station on Vallejo Street (between Mason and Stockton). I generally do not recommend because based on experience, those are usually filled up very quickly.", "author": "Benson C."}

I have been frequenting this place for the past 2 decades, and am still delighted with their menu selection. Over the last couple of years, New Asia have had added a contemporary twist to their dim sum offerings, like durian pastry puffs, baked taro buns, and deep-fried lobster noodles. \n\nHow do you tell when a dim sum joint is good? I do so by judging the patrons. If there are oodles of elder Chinese grandmas and grandpas at the dim sum joint, then the food must be good. Yes, the ones who push and yell loudly at the youngsters on the MUNI and on the street. But the reality is, they are the most picky and hard to please people in the world. They are almost never satisfied! And if Obama gets groped by a senile elder woman in a certain dim sum joint that is not New Asia, it does not mean it is good! Obama is not the taste test standard. Moreover, if the dim sum joint is filled with clueless tourists and is featured on a 7x7 article, then it may not be actually good. I hope you get my drift, because I am trying to be demure.   \n\nHere, New Asia is filled with the rude elder Chinese grandmas and grandpas. So, by some crazy transitive property, New Asia is the best dim sum restaurant in SF Chinatown. Since all of their food is amazing, I highly recommend the whole lobster with ee mein noodles (aka first deep-fried, then pan-fried noodles in sauce) for $16. And then devouring the durian pastry puffs, taro puffs, shrimp puffs, beef balls, and pan-fried daikon cakes. \n\nMy only complaint is that their building has aged throughout the years and that they are due to be remodeled. Oh, and last, but not least, don't expect to find any teeny-bopper dim sum girls at this place. See youtube. This place has dim sum ladies filled with sass towards their own kind, but super nice to the occasional tourists.", "author": "Mabel Y."}

That being said, I would actually come back here to get some Chinese grub.\n\nI was a little frustrated going in on a Monday afternoon to find it packed despite this restaurant being huge and having many tables. We had to get a number and wait to be called. Fortunately, people waiting were called in fast and we didn't have to wait long to be seated. This place is so packed that everything can seem disorderly and rushed. We even asked for a fork during our meal and the waiter must have forgotten to get back to us in all the semi-chaos. This place is pretty loud and since it is crowded you might be sitting in the midst (warning to any claustrophobic people) of many Asians chattering about loudly. And we never got our fork(s). Oh well.\n\nAnyways, I do love me some dim sum, and boy, this is the place for dim sum. I really like the style of this restaurant, everything is brought around in carts and you can choose what you want rather than ordering off a menu (or the mix of both ordering from a menu and a dim sum cart going around). I'm a little iffy when it comes to steamed/sauteed Chinese broccoli since most Chinese restaurants don't steam/cook it enough to make it not as hard. The Chinese broccoli here was cooked very well. Not hard at all. There's definitely still somewhat of a crunch but it's not like you're chewing rocks or something. The dim sum here was just near-perfectly done. I could actually go for some more right now. I'm not going to go into detail of each kind of dim sum I had since it'll probably be tedious for both me and you. It's good.

Standard cart ladies making their rounds pushing each of their fares on you. If you haven't been to dim sum don't feel bad about sternly saying NO to things.

No one will take it personally if you say no and you should otherwise they will throw lots of stuff at you and I guarantee some of it you won't like. On that note don't hesitate to explore some new flavors and again don't feel bad if you take one bite and leave the rest. \n\nAs others have said the staff doesnt speak much english so basic hand signs and pointing works well enough.

My friend and I had Chicken Spring Rolls, Steamed Pork Buns, Chow Mein, Roasted Half Duck, Honey BBQ Pork, Wontons with Sweet Sour Soup, and Potstickers. Everything we ate had great flavor and the only thing not hot at our table was the Potstickers. Definite perk of being by the kitchen exit was having first pick of whatever just came out most of the time. \nDishes that were definitely highlights were the Honey BBQ Pork, Wontons, and Chow Mein. I think the Chow Mein was some of the best I've had! \nThe Spring Rolls were the only thing I didn't care too much for. They were a lot of wrapper, not too much filling. Great crunch, just would have liked more filling. \nThe service was okay. They were quick with trays. It did take us a little bit to get water and spicy mustard. A waiter also came up to us towards the end and made us feel like he was rushing us out. \nOverall, a good place for our lunch and we left stuffed!", "author": "Kristin F."}

I was hoping that it was well worth the walk but unfortunately, it didn't.\n\nAlthough the Crispy Shrimp Balls were huge, the \"crispy\" part was stale.  Both the Shumai and Soup Dumplings fell apart easily and tasted bland. The egg pastry was more egg than pastry so the taste wasn't quite right to me.  The only thing I liked was the Eggrolls until we got a 2nd order.  The same lady that served and cut our eggrolls was the same lady that was cleaning the dirty dishes... EWWW!!!  Plus the service was lousy, more so than others.  I asked for my Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf, they nodded and said \"okay\" but they never came back with it.  The place was practically empty but they took forever on getting us food and water.  They also give you tea which I assumed was complimentary since I didn't ask for it, but they charged us $1/person.  Lastly, they hovered over me when they gave me the receipt to sign.  Awkward much?\n\nI would like to give them the benefit of doubt when it comes to the quality of food since we did come in at 2pm (almost the end of dim sum) and that all dim sum places were like that, but I like to think that a good/great restaurant makes the same quality of food no matter what time it is (opening or closing).  Maybe that's just wishful thinking.  I was about to give them 2 stars because I wouldn't mind coming back to give them another chance until I got my 2nd order of eggrolls.  I was keeping an eye on that lady since I saw she was wiping the dirty dishes and she would serve other customers without washing her hands!  I'm definitely not keen on coming back for a 2nd visit, no thank you.", "author": "Deana M."}

Unless you're tone-deaf. Or deaf. Just don't come. \n\nIt started with a family meal (plus the boyfriend) visiting my grandmother for dinner. Our usual place seemed closed, so we came here per her request. We've come here for the dim sum before, so we know it's not terrible.\n\nThank goodness the boyfriend reads(+speaks) Chinese, since they had a sign in Chinese that said something along the lines of dancing from 7pm to 10pm, Tues-Thurs. We figured no big deal, it was 5pm and we figured we'd be out by 6:30 at the latest since it was literally empty. We asked, and they said they would serve us, so we sat down.\n\nAnd then it started...25 minutes later. Next thing you know the projector on the wall is showing oldschool chinese songs, KARAOKE style. Can you just imagine trying to enjoy a family dinner with TONE-DEAF SENIORS belting out with no care in the world. My Chinese-American (aka we-only-know-English-regrettably) family cringed at the bad singing, but my poor boyfriend, had to endure both the bad singing and butchering of songs he knew. And this started WAY before the advertised 7pm-10pm \"Dance\".\n\nOh yeah and the food was decent. Same-o, Same-o. Honestly I can't remember the food, but the experience was unforgettable.\n\n But if you have grandparents that like to dance, this place opens their dance floor and the seniors get down with the waltzing.", "author": "Jenna H."}

The waiter seated us on the side aisle at a table for four but can only fit two because the placement of the other tables were so close together. I asked for a high chair and he came back with a 1940s high with no security strap. Best of all, the tray table was taped together with duck tape. I understand duck tapes are very strong but I didnt need my son to start peeling the germs off of it so I decided not to use it and just sat him in a regular chair.\n\nWe waited for the dim sum cart to come by and they just kept going up and down the center aisle or they would finally get close to us but turn back. We weren't even seated in the corner so I didnt understand how they can miss us. \nFinally one cart came by and we ordered two things off that cart. Considering my son only has eight teeth, I'm limited to what I can order. Him and I started eating the Siu Mai dumpling, and while he was eating it, I kept my eye out for another cart. Again, they never turn to get to our aisle. When he was done with his dumpling, he started getting fussy. I tried to wave down those carts but no one seem to care to pay enough attention. Finally a grandma asked why am I not ordering my son any food. Well geee, I am trying here. So she helped me wave someone down. Fortunately for me, the only cart that would come by was the same cart we originally ordered from. So off the ten carts I saw wheeling by, only one came to us. I packed my bags and my son and paid. Before I can even get my son strapped on me, the bus boy had already clean my table. I am Asian and I know the culture but that was very rude. I almost left without putting down a tip. \n\nI can't even rate and focus on the quality of food because I didn't have any.

He demanded that we take a smaller table. My mother insisted that the lady downstairs said that we could sit anywhere but he did not care. \n\nWe moved to a smaller table and the same yelling waiter had to serve us.

I told the waiter and he was extremly indifferent and didn't replace the soy sauce.  So I lived without soy sauce.\n\nFood was no better.  Too much MSG, too much sauce, too much crap.

It thought their Dim Sum was delicious although they're missing some things that I like such as stuffed eggplant and tau foo far with the lovely syrup.  And I've always loved their roast duck (very crispy) and char siu (not sweet and sticky).  However, after having moved here and been a few times during week days and weekends I've been able to discern some quality concerns about this place.\n\nFirst of all, it's safe to say that their seafood is not the freshest (i.e. the har gao and shumai) and it's definitely worse during the weekends.  The last time I went there for lunch back in the summer, my tummy was not happy about it.\n\nI was seated at a table by the stairs with a pile of dirty dishes and feeling icked out by the look of the floors.  And when I asked the waiter for a plate of roast duck, one nodded and never brought it.  Another said, \"We're out..\" - dude really? It's 2PM and you're out of roast duck? You should close your shop at this point.\n\nAnd when I paid the lady at the register snapped, \"no tip?\" I said I left it at the table then she does that forced insincere smile, \"oh thank you thank you\".

The difference is that Poh Tat is more creamy than the customary egg tart that everyone normally eats. It has a less dense texture for the cream and it is sometimes runny, which I think is really good. It is kind of like the difference between the Lai Wong Bao and the Lau Sah Bao. (Steamed egg custard buns). If you are chinese then you know what I'm talking about... and if you are not... well too bad =]\n\nThe rest of their dim sum is pretty good also, but maybe a bit more pricey than other places, but it is worth it.

Let's meet at New Asia! \n\n I've been told that this place is a bit touristy but I disagree. What sets it apart from most other chinese restaurants that you may find in the area, is that it is HUGE and still fairly clean! It was designed for banquet sized events such as weddings.   This place has TWO levels. When they have tons of people they open up the second floor for customers to sit at and eat.  \n\n The food is absolutely delicious! The size of each item is oversized! You know you are getting your money's worth when you come here.   \n\nThe little old chinese ladies are super friendly when they come by on their carts asking what you want to eat. If you speak canto, they are pretty fun to talk with while they are grabbing a steamer of food for you and stamping your card.   \n\nThe only unfortunate part of this huge place, is the second floor. If you get there too late and get the boot the second floor, you are in a world of loneliness. They have to turn on the kitchen on the second floor, and re-organize the staff to accommodate both floors. So sometimes, the second floor gets ignored a bit. They won't necessarily pre-make all the stuff already prepared for the first floor. So you'll have to flag someone down to get what you want if you can't find it on the carts.", "author": "Jess G."}

Instead, we waited about 5 minutes until a waiter came back and took it away, and another 5 minutes until we finally got tea. The workers pushing the carts around also had a tendency to leave them sitting around. I could have taken some free plates of dim sum. An abandoned cart with hot dim sum also started rolling and almost hit my mom. \n\nWhen the bill came, it was ridiculously expensive. About $70 (with tip) for about a dozen small plates?! You can get more dim sum for $30 in NY. I wonder how they would handle a full restaurant in the mornings, though with such expensive prices and lack of good service I wouldn't come back.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

New Asia was a good place to go to years back but it has deteriorated down to the pits! Place is not the once neat venue for lunch. The almost empty place at the peak of lunchtime should have been a warning, but A grumbling tummy forced me to give this place a second try. Prices were ridiculous - $5 for an order of pork siumai, marginal tasting, if not bland. Would have tried other cart foods, but they look scary old, noodles & vegetables look desiccated. Opted to order basic Beef Stew Noodle Soup (Ngow Lam Mein) from the kitchen and it took 15 minutes to reach my table. I was wondering whether the waiter who took my order had forgotten since he seemed to ignore my waving. A second waiter finally came to the rescue and had my bowl after 5 minutes. The soup smells in, yellow noodles were the cheap imitation kind and priced at $12. No, YOU ARE NOT Yank Sing. Tally/Paytime wrapped up the overall horrible lunch. My pitiful noodle soup with my siumai totaled $19.80...What? $12 + $5 = $17. The waiter says they charge for tea! Really? Now fuming, I handed him two $20 bills. He came back with his tip tray and $19.20 change.  $40 - $19.80 = $20.20. I couldn't contain myself any longer but I had to leave that place. I told the waiter how bad everything was on top of the \"inaccuracy\" of charge. This was highway robbery in broad daylight!  I know my ranting at the waiter was futile and pitied another unsuspecting guest that may visit the place and fall prey. BTW, the waiter thanked me for the stolen dollar.

Since I ate near the end of the dim sum hour, I might not be as lucky as I hoped. Eating dim sum at a large restaurant can be a bit if a gamble.\n\nThe majority of people here still speak Cantonese here so if you only speak Mandarin then you might be out if luck.

We asked for pork shumai and we were told 4 minutes...10 minutes go by and we asked again...well wouldn't you know it we were told 4 minutes....guess what, asked again and guess what...4 minutes! We never got any pork. We asked for soy sauce three times...never got it. We asked at 7 minutes to 3:00 for noodles with chicken. Our obvious mistake was asking the rolling cart gals (which they wear purple and the waitress wears pink...who knew!) which they did not tell our waitress and 5 after 3:00 our waitress finally came around and we said we would like noodles...well, apparently they stop serving at 3:00.

We stopped by here for lunch today, and it was the worst experience, both food and service.  Of course, one expects bad service in a Chinese restaurant, but this was beyond bad.  \n\nWe got there around noon and there was no wait (yay!).  The lady said to walk in and then a greeter meets you half way to show you your table.  We got the \"let's not use this table unless we have to\" table.  It was in the middle of the restaurant, so all the carts same by, BUT...  It was a square table for 4, but they only had 3 chairs (and there were only 2 of us).  There was no chair in one aisle side because the ladies use it as their parking space, so if I turned to my right, there was a cart up against my face.  The third chair was not used, so during the 45 minutes we were there, it got knocked from its original spot to the space next to me and then finally to the middle of the aisle until about 15 minutes later when someone moved it back to our table.  :D\n\nRight after we got shown to our table and before we even sat down, a waiter asked us what tea we wanted.  Tea is $1/pp and we ordered jasmine.  Unless you are a kid or maybe if you order a soda, you will be charged a tea fee.  I don't think you can actually say I don't want tea and have them not charge you.  \n\nThen came the food.  My husband ordered the baked pork buns.  They were filled with pork and thick salty sauce.  A lady carted some daikon cake and said it was hot, so we ordered.  It was room temperature at best (don't believe them!).  We each had 1/2 piece and brought the other two home so that we could pan fried them later.  Then we got the shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, and shrimp noodle rolls.  Shrimp dumplings were pretty good.  Skin was transparent and yummy but shrimp were the small type.  The pork dumplings were a little dry.  The shrimp noodle rolls were good but only room temperature.  By this time, I had asked two separate person for iced water because I was thirsty.  I waited and waited.  And finally asked a third time before it was brought to us.  This was during a span of about 20 minutes.  \n\nWe sat for about 15 minutes without ordering anything less.  Now let's review the five plates we got:  daikon cake, shrimp dumpling, pork dumpling, shrimp noodle roll, and pork buns.  We got charged for 1 small plate, 1 medium plate, 1 large plate, and 2 specialty plates.  The 2 specialty plates were $4.50 each!  Our bill came to almost $23!  Our waiter claimed that the dumplings were specialty plates.  In what dim sum restaurant are dumplings a specialty plate that cost $4.50?!\n\nThat was the final straw!  We quickly paid and left and will never return.  It's sad because in Chinatown, there are very limited dim sum restaurants, and they are probably the only one with carts.

I think it has changed quite a bit since the time I came here with my parents when I was younger. Today, my bf and I ordered the following:\n\nSiu Mai (stamped as medium because they add shrimp): YUM! I always seem to like siu mai with bits of shrimp in it. The mixture of the pork and shrimp makes the best combination and the siu mai itself at this place is pretty big.\n\nChicken Feet: This is where I had to dock stars. The chicken feet isn't the best I have had and to tell you the truth, I would rank it as one of the worse I have ever had. The texture is there and is good, but the marinade... it just isn't good.\n\nShrimp dumplings (stamped as large): You won't be jipped with shrimp in this dish. Some dimsum places give your one small shrimp and then cover it up with fake shrimp paste to make you think you get your monies worth. Not here, you get a hardy portion of shrimp in each dumpings.\n\nDan Ta (egg tart) (stamped as special): hrm... usually in other dim sum places, it gets stamped as small because it doesn't take much to make these delicious buttery eggy tarts! This was really warm and yummy. I love egg tarts!\n\nHam Sui Gok (deep fried meat dumplings): I love this dish when I was growing up (until I realized this is not good for you.. so I don't eat this dish often LOL). I would have to say the stuffing in this dish was very disappointing. You get so little stuffing and so much gooey skin... it wasn't worth getting. I have had better and it had triple the amount of meat stuffing than what we got at New Asia.\n\nOverall. dimsum carts came by often. Opt out on getting crappy seats, there is so many tables there that it won't hurt to wait a min longer to get a better table (I wouldn't recommend sitting upstairs for dimsum). I think it is CASH ONLY during lunch hours. Service is good, they clean and refill your tea pretty fast.\n\nTotal bill was $19 something for 5 dishes (two people).", "author": "Erica T."}

If you see the egg tarts, get at least 3 orders worth! You won't regret it! :)\n\nNext time I'm here I'm ONLY ordering\n+ shu mai\n+ EGG TARTS (LOVED!!! they run out quick!)\n+ bbq pork pastry stuff\n\nDim sum \"no no\"s\n- shiao long bao (expensive and NASTY, doughy and meat tasted uncooked)\n- har gow (funny shrimp after taste)\n\nDepending on where you sit in that restaurant, eating dim sum can be a good or bad experience!

We took over the entire first floor with 4 generations.\n\nWhen I arrived at the doors, I had an instant flash-back of several crazy, insane, \"Wait, I didn't want that dish and where's my chow-fun?\" dim-sum lunches. It's a typical Chinatown joint: tile floors that weren't sticky for a change, a sea of tables, stage, big screen TV, wait staff in a constant flurry of slowness (how is that even possible?), and a little lacking in its dated ambiance. I realize that I could almost be describing anywhere, but you get my point. \n\n8 good, but not great dishes (gotta throw in a lucky eight in there!) including Seafood Lettuce Wraps, Steamed Pork with Egg, Duck and a soup that tasted fishy but not in an especially good way.  We ordered way too much, but no one seemed to be taking it home except for me, cuz who doesn't like free leftovers? It was probably a 2.5 Star sign...\n\nI've got 20 more Chinese Banquets to chow down at in the future, I hope! However, not sure I'll be spinning the dishes 'round this one.

However, I do expect GOOD food!\n\nAlthough New Asia Gardens has never been my favorite dim sum haunt, this had to be the worse experience ever!  \n\nBrought relatives visiting from the East Coast for a a visit.  Suggested they try dim sum from SF and compare their experience to LA.\n\nWe arrived at New Asia Gardens on a Saturday around 10:30A.  There was a short wait.  When our number was called, we were directed to a table.  When we found our designated table, there were people sitting there.  I went back to the hostess and told her there were people sitting at the table.  She said I told you table #4.  I said yes there are people sitting at table #4.  She got on her walkie talkie and started yelling at the guy setting up the table.\n\nFinally things got straightened out and we were seated.  Next a server brings out a pot of tea.  (Aren't they suppose to ask what kind of tea you would like?)  I told the guy I wanted Jasmine, he said okay, it's coming.  Never saw him again.  Oh! I also asked the server setting up our table for 2 forks.  He said let me set up your table first.  He never came back.  I asked another guy for a fork and he said okay, but never saw him again.  Tried a third time and finally gave up.\n\nWhen we ran out of tea, I opened the lid to signal to the waiter we needed hot water.  Lid must have been opened for at least 10 minutes before I could get someone's attention. \n\nSo much for customer service.\n\nNow on to the review of the  food.  Custard tarts were burnt, maybe they were suppose to be Macau style?!?  At least they were warm.  Ribs were fatty and gristly.  The wrapper on the shrimp dumplings were mushy.  If you tried to pick one up with your chopsticks, the wrapper would disintegrate before your very eyes.  The Shu Mai was edible.  The bean curd rolls were bland and pretty tasteless. We added soy and chili sauces to give it some flavor.  The Char Siu Baos were probably the best part of the meal except they were cold.  I could go on, but I think you get the picture.\n\nWe were finally able to flag someone to come over and calculate the bill.  I told my husband he should ding them for the lousy service.  Hubby decided to stiff them instead.  When the waiter brought back our change,  he had the nerve to point out that we forgot to leave a tip.  Hubby told him the service sucked and tips were for customer service.  \n\nI guarantee we will not be back!

He did pretty well at this onslaught, we chose a few dishes, the women went along their way, and we began eating.\n\n(I'm still not sure why they rushed us like that.  Maybe our table just happened to be on a collision course?)\n\nWe had some kind of shrimp chive dumpling that had something extra in it (not crack, but with the same effect) that made it sooo savory and good.  Shrimp-stuffed eggplant followed, and the eggplant was nicely seared and still soft in the middle.  \n\nAt this point another lady came over with her cart.

She kept insisting, 'it's good!  it's good!\"  We kept being indifferent.\n\nAnd then... she set them down, stamped our receipt, and rushed away so fast that we were left gaping!

I can understand you want to ram in the masses and put tables wherever possible but that means carts cannot get around and if you are unlucky enough to be in a far corner or worse in the middle of a bunch of tables, it means not being able to see the carts. \n\nOverall a shame really.", "author": "Nick L."}

More than half of the banquets that I've attended were held at this disgusting restaurant in the heart of Chinatown.\r\n\r\nMy long-time friend Wilson and his wife had their banquet here. The recent banquet at this restaurant,that my family and I attended, conditionally has never changed. The atmosphere was filled with filth and has aged dramatically, which means it is time for a remodel. The floors including the bathroom,were dirty and sticky as a adhesive sticker. The stereo/ entertainment system were old,and have no capable wires or adapters to the laptop or IPods. The only positive addition to the restaurant was acquiring 10 flat-screen tv's,installed to the walls,for those people who sits far away and can watch the MC's and/or center-stage through the TV. They also do Karaoke during the weeknights. I'm also optimistic of the selection in music they play during the week.\r\n\r\nThe combination set-dinner portions served at the restaurant,by the request of the newlyweds, were horrible in many ways. The peking duck was oily. The fried-rice was dried and crunchy. It was probable leftovers that was left behind from a previous wedding the week before. The only good thing about the banquet was the long-awaited dessert of the wedding-cake,which came from Schubert's. An \"excellent\" choice in dessert and worth the wait.\r\n\r\nEventhough the aging condition of this restaurant has flaws,it is still the most popular restaurant for banquets and daily brunches. They have banquets every weekends,and with the constant busy schedule,remodeling this place seems unlikely and tough to plan. I'm very fortunate that our wedding-banquet was not held here,and my strong-advice to you single Yelp-member,who plans to get marry in the future,don't do your banquet dinner at New Asia.

The restaurant setting seems like a banquet hall, and a place that looks like events are held there. The table had a pot of tea, and you assume it's complimentary. We were seated, and we waited over ten minutes and no one came to greet us or start us off. We had to flag people down, we basically did throughout our entire time there. We had to stop someone to take an order, and no one cared to come to the table. I ordered a chicken fried rice & it was decent. My boyfriend ordered a pan fried noodle and that was delicious! But after our meal, we had to flag someone down for a check again. And we get charged three tea's and only two of my friends ordered that. I explained that to the server and he tried to convince me that they charge that per person when I didn't even have a cup of tea. It took them 5 minutes to finally just take off a tea that was $1.75 and overall the service was just horrible. That was the worst experience I had in all of San Fransisco. My friend didn't want to tip because he didn't feel like his or any of our experience were good in any way. I work at a restaurant myself and I've always understood the importance of not just tip, but the importance of service. People tip because they feel like they were served well, they don't need to feel forced to. My friend signed the bill and she stopped him and said tip!!! You forgot tip! And he personally didn't want to. She goes ahead and says \"you have to tip $5\" forcing my friend to leave a tip! What kind of disaster!!!

The locals we have encountered introduced us to New Asia Restaurant. First impressions are always  what sets in the mood for things. \nWhen we first arrived here, it was PACKED. Saturday morning, ok no biggie. We've experienced worse back in New York. It took us roughly 15 mins to get seated (seat 41). It was seat 18 when we got there. \nTo judge a dim sum place, i judge them on their food. Portions, Freshness and taste.We ordered chicken feet(2), short ribs(pai gwut), chueng fun(beef), har gau, siu mai, and white tripe. We tried to order the regular tripe in brown sauce.. and flagged many carts for it but couldnt find it.\n\nChicken feet: Too hard, not tender enough. I guess cause it wasnt cooked long enough. Had to actually chew on it till it broke apart. Compared to the ones in New York, it had the \"melt in your mouth\" feeling. 2.5/5\n\nShort ribs: OK, wasn't that bad. 3/5\n\nCheung Fun(beef): ..... The beef inside had no flavor at all, tasted more like regular cheung fun with nothing inside.1/5\n\nHar Gau: The shrimp inside was alright. I had a big problem with the glutinous wrapping it came with. It was WAY to chewy for a har gau. 1/5\n\nSiu Mai: Im not sure if this is the standard they make siu mai now, but the plate that we got tasted old. The wonton skin that they wrap around it was dry and hard. It had a brownish color on it which i dont believe should be the color of siu mai. It should be a bright yellow color. 2/5\n\nWhite Tripe: This tripe was actually a little decent. It wasnt to the point where chewing on it made it an olympic sport but was desirable for seconds. It just lacked a bit of spicy kick to it. 3/5\n\nService: There are so many things they can improve on the service. Besides cleaning up after the tables and putting new settings, perhaps they can actually serve their patrons? I had to flag the same waiter down 3 times just to get 3 glasses of water. In the end.. i just stood up and tapped another waiter on his back for some water.\n\nI'm not sure if New York has set the standard for good dim sum for me, but the dim sum at this place wasn't good enough to come back every other weekend to have dim sum with family or friends.", "author": "Steven B."}

I can't just pick out the best places on Yelp and say, \"This is where we're going.\"  I have to take distance, parking, where some random woman on the street told my dad we should eat, and a variety of other factors into account.  In other words, choosing a restaurant is not all about ME and my own \"research\" methods.  I hate it when that happens.\n\nBut in the case of New Asia, it worked out just fine.  Even though my dad decided singlehandedly that we should eat here based on the recommendation of aforementioned random woman on the street, it was some of the best dim sum I've ever had.  I was hella nervous because of course as soon as he pronounced our destination I looked up the Yelp reviews on my Treo and they were none too glowing.  But either we were here on the right day or my scale for great Asian food is skewed by my residence in Texas, because I loved it.\n\nWe arrived at New Asia before it opened on a Saturday.  By the time the doors were unlocked, there was a substantial crowd waiting.  One person told us that New Asia had new owners as of a couple of months ago, so that gave me some hope despite the mediocre Yelp reviews.  And once we got inside, I was delighted to see that the very spacious interior filled up very quickly, and maybe 95% of the clientele was Asian.  A good sign.\n\nThe carts started coming, and we started eating.  And eating.  And eating.  It was awesome.  The shu mai were fantastic - plump, flavorful, and with a little bit of crab roe sprinkled on top.  We also tried a number of things that I'd had before elsewhere and hadn't loved previously, and all were great (unfortunately, I'm not real clear on what any of them were, so I can't list them here).  The only minor beefs I had were that the har gau weren't that good (we had some much better ones at Gourmet Market later in our trip), the spareribs were a little sparse, and I wished they had some pan fried dumplings (I didn't see any at all - only steamed).  Also, while the custard tarts (dan ta) were seriously delicious and super buttery, they didn't taste at all like the traditional dan ta - the filling wasn't \"eggy\" enough.\n\nDecor is \"Chinatown fancy\" - in other words, it was probably nice-ish by Chinatown terms at one time, but it's kind of outdated and a little worse for the wear at this point.  And I would not recommend using the restrooms here unless it is an emergency.\n\nStill, for great dim sum, I'll overlook much.

Definitely request a table along the pathway of the dim sum carts; otherwise, you'll never be able to get anything to eat. \n\nSome of the dim sum/entree items I tried were:\n- Shrimp dumplings- Lots of shrimp with very little shrimp paste. Pretty good!\n- Chicken feet- Meaty, but not spicy\n- BBQ pork buns- okay\n- Chives dumpling- had cashews in the filling, which gave it a nice crunch\n- House Fried Seafood noodles- The noodles were very odd. The cooks probably didn't use the regular egg noodles, since the color didn't look right.\n- Beef Chow Fun- Oily, but the flavor was good.\n\nI think this place is overrated with the dim sum. Service is lacking since we asked for cold water several times. \n\nBANQUET REVIEW:\nJust a couple hours ago, we were eating lunch at New Asia.

At a typical Chinese banquet, the guests would wait over an hour to be served.\n\nOverall, the food was pretty good. It's 10x better than banquet food at Empress of China. The menu was typical, but some entrees stood out better than others.\n\n1) Special Combination plate of chicken, duck, pork, jelly fish- The meat had mostly bones.\n\n2) Shrimp in crab claw- The shrimp was hot! I burned the roof of my mouth since I was greedy to eat it. The shrimp ball was a good size! Nice and plump.\n\n3) Scallops and prawns- Everything was sauteed and with veggies. Nothing too special.\n\n4) Shark fin soup with crab meat! Yay!\n\n5) Abalone with mushrooms and bitter choy- The abalone wasn't overcooked! \n\n6) Crispy chicken- Aww.. there weren't any shrimp chips. The skin wasn't that crispy, but the chicken was moist.\n\n7) Lobster - very meaty!\n\n8) Smoked \"cod\" - This was Chilean Sea Bass!!! YUMMY! I devoured my smooth and fatty pieces. Best dish of the night!\n\n9) Red bean dessert- Someone burned the red bean :( You can taste it! Yuck.", "author": "Jackie S."}

Let's start with the dim sum.\n\nDim Sum:\nOverall, it's pretty good. The prices are reasonable (unlike Koi Palace in Daly City which is kind of pricey) and the food is decent. It's not the best dim sum I've ever had nor is it the worst. It's just three-stars-a-ok. This place is almost always busy, like most dim sum places in the city, but it was pretty easy to get a table since the space is pretty large. I think the fact that it's mainly filled with Chinese people authenticates the decency of the food! Don't be surprised if they sit you at a table with strangers - this isn't a Chinese thing, it's a restaurant thing. There are two levels (the bathroom is on the second level). \n\nDinner:\nOh man. Have you ever walked into a Chinese restaurant expecting a normal Chinese dinner and then walked into a scene straight out of a bad-Chinese-food-induced-Saturday-Night-Fever-nightmare? New Asia on Thursday nights, my friends. \n\nSo I don't know if it's every Thursday night, but I'm guessing it is. We parked in our usual parking lot (the one on Pacific a few doors down from the restaurant) and walked up to the front doors. For a few seconds, we thought there was a private party going on because the middle of the restaurant had been converted into a dance floor, a matchstick-jeans-clad Chinese man in sunglasses was sashaying on the raised platform singing into a mic and a mini rotating disco ball was flashing from the ceiling. Oh, did I forget to mention the 20 or so couples who were ballroom dancing and otherwise boogie-ing on the dance floor?\n\nBut no, it's just Special Dancing Night! Seriously! That's what the menu said! We walked in and were seated at one of the tables around the dance floor. It turned out to be really entertaining. Who knew that middle-aged and old Chinese folks like to cha-cha-cha and waltz?\n\nAnyway, the food (which is the main point) was decent. They have a Special Dancing Night menu which we glanced over but didn't order from. It took us a while to flag down a waiter who finally brought us an English menu. I think we ended up getting the salt and pepper pork, a fried shrimp dish, some flat rice noodles, pork fried rice and steamed whole fish (you have to ask for it). Since I'm not Chinese, I don't have the specific names for these things, sorry. \n\nThe manager came over a few times to check on us and encouraged us to dance. We think it's because they might add a Special Dancing Night tax to the meal, but if they did, it's nothing too steep. Also, watching the folks dance with such serious expressions is pretty fun. The singer, who was wearing Bono sunglasses, and his partner, who was wearing a fur vest, switched between soulful Chinese music and songs like \"Get This Party Started\" and \"Bad Romance\" and \"Happy Birthday.\" No joke.\n\nIf you're looking for a good time on Thursday night, go to New Asia!", "author": "Christine P."}

We had to ask like 5 times to 5 different wait staff before they brought it out and they kept passing the buck.  Then a waitress came over when we were just starting to eat to ask if we wanted something else because they were closing up for the lunchtime hours.  We said no...but we felt super rushed since we just started eating and it wasn't near 3 pm yet, their closing time.

My husband tells her we're still eating and she says \"please pay now we are closing you can continue eating\" and then she leaves.

I wasn't sure what to expect but was hoping to have some fun.  I just love how you can go a few blocks north of  Union Square and end up in a totally different world.  Chinatown is awesome.  Walking a few blocks and visiting a few shops ( I bought a lucky cat with the swinging arm and a hand fan for my mom ); my wife and I find ourselves in front of the New Asia Restaurant.  Going inside the place is one huge hall with round tables everywhere.  Being early afternoon the place was packed with many of the patrons being of asian desent.  It was cool to see where ever you looked families were sharing a meal.\nMy wife recommended this place having come here before on vacation with her girlfriends.  So I wanted to give it a try.  To get seated you have to get a number from a person behind a counter.  When they are ready to seat you they call out your number on a intercomm system.  The funny thing is that at the time it was a older chinese woman who would literally scream out the numbers in a thick oriental accent.  It was like something out of a Sienfeld episode.  Hilarious.\nOnce our number was called we are escorted to a table right next to the kitchen.  At first I was thinking that they seated us at the worst table in the whole place.  Later I felt it was the best table because that is where all the carts of food came out from.  Let me explain.  The way the place worked was the ladies would come around with carts of food.  If you saw something you liked they would put it on your table.  You get charged for the number of plates of food on your table.  So if you have a problem like me with liking everything you see you will have a table full of food like we did.  We had so much food our fridge in our hotel room was bursting with chinese food.\nAs for the food, I found it to be pretty good.  Not the best chinese food I have ever ate but good.  The prices aren't that bad either.  What I found out is that Chinatown all together is pretty cheap.  From the shops to the restaurants, your money goes a long way.  I thought the service was pretty good too.  The cart ladies treated us both well.  The place all around was a fun experience.  If you can find it.  You should try it for yourself.", "author": "Paul S."}

I thought it completely endearing the way he ordered us items from the carts in his hesitant Cantonese, and sweet how he related to me that as a kid his parents used to drive the family into the city from the East Bay just to eat dim sum at this place.\n\nA few days later, he was asking me my plans three months into the future to see if I could accompany him on a weekend camping trip. Needless to say, my relationship with the guy was quickly terminated. My relationship with New Asia, on the other hand, continues to thrive!\n\nTrue, it may not have the best dim sum in the city. And yes, their version of \"cleaning up\" the last customers' mess is to simply cover up the soiled tablecloth with a few paper placemats (who KNOWS when was the last time they did their laundry...). The wait on a weekend can be horrendously long (make sure you take a number), and I swear that just because I'm not Chinese the bill always seems a little higher than it should. Oh, and the waitresses will serve you water and tea... hopefully after you've asked them for the 5th time. \n\nDespite all this, I can still honestly say that I'm a fan of this place if for no other reason than the fact that it straight up, full on CHINATOWN. From the host calling your number three times in at least three different languages over a mic like a Chinese racetrack announcer, to the immensity of the space itself with easily over a hundred occupied tables and gaudy chandeliers and widescreen tvs (just in case you were interested in what the people on the other side of the restaurant look like while they're gnawing and chattering away), to the carts upon carts of steaming wrapped goodies pushed around by loud ladies (who seem angry and rude but are actually pretty nice and helpful... the Chinese culture lacks tact), New Asia is an experience. I've loved it enough to bring my own family there (twice) as well as my more adventurous friends (btw I hope that guy doesn't read this, though I guess I do give him all the credit...).\n\nIf culture is what you seek, New Asia is your place.

And each cart has a number of different options that aren't readily identifiable. I can see how coming here without a \"guide\" would quickly become hectic and overwhelming. Thankfully, I was in good hands, and I was able to sit back while my friend's uncle skillfully quarterbacked our meal. If you can stomach Chinese food and dumplings in the morning, then this is definitely a place to try. Our table was full of steamed baskets of dumplings that I really didn't bother to learn the names of (not that I would want to - definitely not coming here without help) that tasted awesome and were surprisingly filling.

You always have to inspect the plates and glasses and wipe them down with your dinner napkin to make sure that things are as clean as they can be.  Otherwise, you may end up with some unappeitizing food stains on your plate.  Despite the somewhat unsanitary look of the place, the food is quite good, especially considering the fact that they are serving 25+ tables at once.  Though service can be a bit slow, you'll usually end up with what you ask for (extra napkins, hot sauce, forks, steamed rice, etc.)\n\nThe meal that we had was a late Chinese New Year banquet held by a Chinatown association.  After the requisite firecrackers, lion/dragon dances, and the speeches by important dignitaries, the meal was on.  The best part of the banquet was the deep-fried shrimp balls, the whole crispy chicken, the sliced steak and onions, and the deep-fried fish fillet.  All of those dishes were surprisingly good and tasty and it really helped that the restaurant serves very good steamed rice to go along with them.  The steak and onions in particular are good.  You don't really expect the steak to be as tender as it was, nor do you expect the onions to be sweet as they were.  It came stir-fried in a lovely sauce that begged to be eaten with rice.  We debated for a while to see if we could figure out what was in that sauce so that we might replicate it at home.  \n\nThe whole crispy chicken was also surprisingly moist, with a delicious, well-seasoned crisp skin.  My table ate the entire chicken, which is pretty rare for us seasoned banquet eaters.  The deep fried shrimp balls and fish fillet were great because they were yummy (like all deep-fried things) without being oily.  They were HOT though, likely coming straight out of the fryer and onto 25+ platters.\n\nThe other dishes - the cold appetizer platter, chicken/squid with broccoli, seafood egg drop soup, and winter melon slices with pork and mushroom- were still good, but not spectacular.\n\nOverall, its very likely that I will be back at New Asia in the future for more CNY banquets (the association has held them here for years now).  The food seems to have gotten better over the years, though the furnishings have remained the same.  New Asia would benefit quite a bit from some new floors, updated restrooms, and new decor overall - something where the room matched the quality of food.

She's Chinese and promised me a safe first time dim sum experience, sans chicken feet or anything crazy.  I definitely love trying new things and was happy to check it out.\n\nI thought it was cool how people just push around carts full of steamers and different dishes.  My bride's parents kind of took over (which I was thankful for because I had no idea,) and asked what I liked so they knew what to grab off each of the trays.  We had shrimp balls (is there a more eloquent term for that?) chow mein, Chinese brocolli, egg rolls, some kind of noodle dish with lobster, and some baked custard dessert.  The shrimp balls were really good, although it was kind of annoying that there was so much wrapper and it kept falling apart as I was trying to eat it.  The chow mein and lobster noodle dish were both really good, although I'm not surprised because those were definitely our \"safe\" items.  I love brocollini so I was pretty happy to have some green stuff on the plate.  We started jokingly calling the egg rolls \"fried egg wrappers\" because there wasn't much in them and it was pretty much all wrapper.  The custard was really good but I was completely full by the time I got to it so I didn't get to enjoy much.\n\nJust like other people have said, and I wasn't really expecting, the service definitely isn't a 5 star standard. But I'm pretty sure you don't come to dim sum for that.  The women pushing the carts around were all friendly and there was always someone around.  It was super loud but I figure if the place is packed it must be good.  My bride's parents took care of the bill so I'm not sure how much it was, but I'm pretty sure it was really reasonable.

The restrooms were filthy.  When I commented on the problems to the lady taking our money, she shrugged with indifference.  Goodby old favorite. We will never eat there again.", "author": "Kathleen P."}

She beholds the right to offering you your table amongst the dim sum crowd. The dim sum fare was pretty average in terms of selection. I enjoyed the carts that were being pushed around. I hate how dim sum in Chicago is starting to turn more into ordering off a list instead of the carts. Everything was pretty delish except for the chicken feet. It didn't seem like it was cooked all the way and the gelatinous saucy/fat was still....gelatiny. A nice surprise was the siu long bao.

We all left stuffed, with leftovers, and paying about $12 each.\n\nThe building is kind of an experience in itself - it looks like an old ballroom, kind of tacky, with goldish chrome on everything, disco balls and presentation screens hanging from the ceiling and walls, clearly a multi-use area. The entrance is supremely crowded and noisy, with the hostess calling out numbers in english and cantonese with a wonderful sort of rhythm. Unused chairs and broken furniture are unceremoniously stacked next to the waiting area. For me, this all added to the charm, the sense that this restaurant wastes not and wants not, the sense that this is truly a Chinese restaurant.\n\nI can't compare this to other SF dim sum restaurants, but this beat the stuffing out of dim sum in San Diego and Chicago.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

In fact I was so homesick for good dim sum that I insisted my sisters and I go straight to get Dim Sum when we landed at SFO.\n\nNew Asia was filled with Asian people speaking Chinese to each other. It has a massive dining room. The ladies roll out the dim sum carrts in front of you and you point (if you can't speak Chinese) and they place the item on the table.\n\nWe ordered the standards, har gau, siu mai, shrimp pouch (tasty and not greasy, don't bother with the mayo sauce), and baked char siu bao. The baked char siu bao was delicious, and just the right size (4 to an order). The taro gok was so lovely. It had a smooth and silky texture and the outside was crispy and delightful.\n\nOur favorite dish was the gai lan, the broccoli.  It surprised me at first because it was cold, but it was cooked just right to preserve the beautiful green color. The addition of the oyster sauce to dip the broccoli in was a nice touch.\n\nI did not try the lobster noodle, although it was quite popular and ordered all around us.  Maybe next time...the dim sum is what this place is known for.\n\nAbout the bathrooms...if you have been to any restaurant in Chinatown you experience as my nephew puts it, \"going into a third world country.'  Well we decided before we go up to Jackson Market we needed to go to the powder room before we left.  The bathrooms were clean and decent, what a relief.  I know it might be tacky to discuss the bathroom facilities of a restaurant, but I am telling you this is of utmost important.

By far the best and most expensive is Yank Sing...mortage the house before you go.  Second Tong Kiang on Geary Blvd. then New Asia.  That being said.. I went there with out of town guests and wanted something in China Town.  I loved the fact that it was big and bustling felt like i was in Hong Kong.  I completely agree   that  some of the cart people were rude but that may be part of the atmosphere.  We went late 1:45 so the choices were limited but what we had was quite good, but no buns with the duck, and no  bbq pork.  The Ha Gow (shrimp dumplings) were the best,, big filled with whole shrimp.  Small baked pork buns good too .  If you want chow mein (kid is not fond of Dim Sum) you have to order it of the menu the cart ladies do not bring it around.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-22", "description": "Chinese restaurants are difficult to rate. Some people like to eat \"American\" style chow mein, fried rice and sweet and sour pork and will downgrade restaurants that have anything that vaguely tastes authentic. Some people like it loaded with grease and sauces that will put you in a hospital. Others like it bland. You can find all kinds in Chinatown. If you like Chinese food, look at the clientele. If the place is largely patronized by white middle Americans raving about the food, I would recommend staying away as the food is guaranteed to be bland and lousy. If the place is patronized largely by Asians, then you might assume that the place is pretty authentic. The key is to be patient and develop the skill sets needed to ordering and be a customer. Ordering and being served in a Chinese restaurant take talents and many people go away angry because they don't have a clue on how to handle themselves. What has this got to do with New Asia? Everything if you're going there for Dim Sum. I didn't go there for Dim Sum (although I hope to someday). However I have gone there for banquets with at least 1,000 other people and that's what I'm going to rate. Do Chinese people eat here? You bet they do!! The events I've been to have been organized by the Six Companies and you can't get anymore authentic than that. Was the service good? You bet it was. Nine courses were served at regular intervals and at no time were the tables cluttered up with uneaten food. Was the food good? It was outstanding. Nothing was greasy or loaded up with putrid hoisan sauce. It was all hot (or cold if it was supposed to be cold) and was fresh and tasty. What particularly impressed me was the way they were able to serve over a 1000 people and get it right. The Chinese community establishment likes it and I Ike it. I'll be back for Dim Sum one of these days so stay tuned. \nP.S. There wasn't any sweet sour concoction, fried rice, chow mein or other traditional \"American\" concoctions in the food. However, the variety was sufficient to suit any palate.", "author": "Robert H."}

First of all, it was Friday, the place was packed, and there were only two dim sum carts going around. Throughout the whole time, they kept coming by, and there were not new selections added to any of them.\n\nThe dim sum options are not only scarce, they are not so great:\n1. The platters contained minimum of 4 HUGE pieces (but frequently 6 or 8) of whatever dim sum you might be interested in. Having only 2 people at the table, that meant that we would get too full too soon to try out different versions and enjoy the variety. The fried noodles looked delicious, but I was sure that the huge size meant that we won't be able to try out anything else afterwards. \n2. The selection was poor, really, so no worries about not enjoying the variety. There were dim sums with only two types of fillings available: (A) multiple types of dim sum with pork and (B) two types of dim sum with shrimp. NOTHING else! Nothing with chicken. Nothing with beef. Nothing with fish. Green sprouts, but nothing else with veggies, even veggies inside dim sums mixed up with any meat.\n3. Quality and taste was so-so. I know better dim sum places in SF, such as the Good Luck Dim Sum on Clement st., and the New Asia just does not compare in taste. The tea was not hot enough, and that's bad when you're having a fatty food. The shrimp inside the wrapper was disgustingly slimy. When I opened one of them, I discovered that it was surrounded with huge pieces of plain pork fat. It is frequently added to shrimp dim sums, but here it was done in a way to make the shrimp swim and squish in liquid pork fat. The pork dim sums were a-Okay, but I just wish they were not so huge. \n\nThe service is so-so. While the host was trying to seat us at our table, the 1st lady with a cart arrived and scolded our host (or said to him something that sounded like rude scolding) and forced him to move out of her way from our table. Then, she moved into the space on the floor that he vacated, and started vigorously pushing her dim sums on us. I was not even seated yet, and since I was in the process of hanging my jacket and my purse, her very loud talking was really annoying and disorienting, given that I wanted to sit, take a breath after my long walk through the city, and maybe start with going to the restroom and washing my hands first. Also, whenever I asked either her or another lady about the contents, she would answer and, at the same time, push the platter onto my table and try to put a stamp into our order list, without waiting for me to tell her that I really want the platter. I even had to call a manager and tell him that I have gotten a dish that I did not ask for, though he removed it very quickly, apologized, and deleted the stamp from our list.", "author": "kira m."}

The food is good, the price is very affordable for the amount of food and service, and the atmosphere fun.  Be aware Chinese service means there are a horde of people walking around, and you have to flag someone down to be helped.  Once you do they are very fast.  There is not one server that will check in on you or anything.  Also you want to get there early in the day, because the best steamed dishes will run out during the afternoon.\nThe restaurant is huge and ladies in purple vests walk around with their specialty carts trying to get you to buy their items.  Some were very aggressive even plopping down dishes on our table with out us asking for it.  \n\nThe Shu mai and the shrimp dumplings are very tasty.   I prefer the traditional steamed cha xio bao but several in my party also like the baked variety with honey glaze on top.  Fresh tasty Chinese broccolli.  The shrimp and beef  He Fen (Long noodles) were bland and flavorless.  Excellent Dan Ta (Egg custard tartlett.)  Overall the food was average, they didn't have as much variety as you can get in San Gabriel (SoCal) so my favorites weren't there.  Too many deep fired variety and not enough steamed in my opinion.   \n\nA fun experience and my first timer friends really enjoyed it.  we went with a group of 8 and got away with $12 per person and we were all stuffed", "author": "Maya C."}

For a much more pleasant eating experience, you must go upstairs. Second, in order to get a table without having to wait for an eternity you have to either go a bit before 11 or a little after 1. The time in between is  packed and you're lucky if your chair doesn't get rammed into by one of the dim sum carts. Having said that, I have quickly figured out that this place excels with non-traditional items. Eggrolls, eh, ok. Siu mai, alright, but a little meaty. The BBQ pork buns are good though, even the baked ones, which I am less of a fan of. If you want delicious, though, try their take on the taro. Typically filled with some sort of meat sauce and then fried, New Asia's version puts it in a bun. Or the fried shrimp with chilies and five spice. Salty with a little bit of bite. Yum. They also have a large variety of dumplings and chicken feet (although, I stay away from that, but have heard that they are good). Their desserts are quite delicate and not too sweet.

This place used to be run and owned by Bob Yick (best restaurant designer in SF in my opinion).  After he passed away his family kept it going for a while.  Bob was a stickler for quality so it was always the best.  If you got a chance to go during the 80's you would know that Koi Palace couldn't even hold a candle to this place.  I mean he actually brought over two great chefs from HK and then found out their personalities didn't mesh.  So what did he do, he opened up Hong Kong Villa up the street for one of them to run the kitchen.
