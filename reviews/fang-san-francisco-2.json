A second and subsequent visits if you like it.  I believe I'll come again.\n\nOne thing:  the serving plates are too big and the tables are too small.  We ordered a few things and they wound up having to push two tables together.  No, we're not gobs or gluttons.\n\nWe started out with vegetarian dumplings in a garlic soy vinegar.  Excellent.  I should have saved the empty plate so I could sop up the sauce with my rice.  This an old fashioned trick of the Chinese elders!\n\nThe honey apple prawns were delicious but was too heavy in the mayonnaise.\n\nDry panfried greenbeans are an all time favorite and are excellent here.\n\nThe honey chili short rib with bok choy was okay.  To my taste, the bok choy seemed undercooked.  In retrospect, short rib is not something I would equate with Chinese cuisine, but who knows - my ancestry is from the south.\n\nThe fried rice was shaped into a form like a takeout carton and placed on a hot iron plate, egg then drizzled on it, and stir fried in front of you on the spot.  That was impressive.  The diners around us decided they wanted that too.\n\nThe staff was polite and efficient.  Everything arrived at the same time and I think the dishes should have been timed better.\n\nThe visit was on 9/29.  We'll becoming back to try the other treats!", "author": "Kevin L."}

I was easily able to get a reservation via OpenTable and they had a table all set up for us downstairs. The chef asked us about our dietary preferences and said he would decide what we are going to eat! I had seen some mixed reviews about how that goes on Yelp but for us, it went fantastic. \n\nThere was a steady stream of food for every dietary preference - the crispy chicken, prawns with apples, fish, buns, fried rice and everything else were all excellent. They came out at a good interval and gave us the time to enjoy each dish before we move on. The quantity was also perfect and we finished almost everything.\n\nWe got some sesame ball dessert which was fluffy and hot and just the right amount of sweet.\n\nI highly recommend this place when trying to get a meal for a large group- I think everyone will be pleased :)", "author": "Anju J."}

To evaluate a restaurant you can't just stick to your preferences but also have to look at what others rave about. This review started low but then I tried one of the popular dishes... \n\nI started out and ordered the salt pepper shrimp and mushroom... The dish felt disjointed... But I must admit I went in expecting something similar to Cantonese salt and pepper crispy shrimp... This dish is very different.  Is white button mushrooms with caramelized onions and shrimp seasoned with what reminds me of 5 spice.  Texture wise it was too much of the same... The mushrooms and the shrimp were too similar in texture... Maybe the crispy Cantonese version could be tested here.  But I also had issues with the flavor of the mushrooms and the shrimp... They just didn't seem to work together... Perhaps something with a little sweetness to compliment the sweetness of the shrimp. \n\nThen I ordered the crispy chili short ribs. Wow. Like other short ribs from other cuisines the meat was super tender and rich... But they added a crispy shell to these cubes of meaty goodness. The shell had a hint of a flavor that reminds me of pork floss... Slightly sweet... Then to balance the richness is drizzled with a chili vinegar soy sauce... Bok Choy accompanied these tasty morsels but couldn't stretch far enough to appreciate the raw or slightly blanched Bok Choy... I think it's more an issue with me that if it works as a dish.  I wanted to ask if we could come the veggies for me but felt like that would be an insult to the chef... So I left it alone.  If you try anything you must try this dish.\n\nAlso tried the salted pork belly with Japanese melon... it was deep fried... Mixed in with some onions and preserved veggies swimming in a light sauce.  It's was really good... Any alternate way to prepare could be to stew the pork belly until it's melt in your mouth. I'd order this again.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm left a little confused but satisfied... Will come back to try some other crowd favorites.", "author": "William L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-30", "description": "I came to Fang with some coworkers for lunch today, and I was definitely not impressed. We were seated almost immediately because we had a reservation, and they were accommodating despite the fact that 3 out of the 8 were not there yet. We ordered some food- xiaolongbao, shortribs, braised string beans, sesame chicken, and another fried chicken type dish that I can't remember the name of. The food was alright, the string beans were definitely the highlight of the meal. Those were a 10/10- if you come here, I would highly recommend trying those. Everything else tasted overly sweet-  perhaps we made a mistake in our ordering and only ordered sweet dishes, but even the sauce that the xiaolongbao came with was too sweet. The food came out in varying orders- first came out the string beans and the shortribs, and then we had to ask four or five times before the rice we had ordered was brought out so we could start eating. \n\nThis brings me to the service- extremely subpar. I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, but when I asked for our rice (mind you, this was the fourth time I was asking and our food was getting cold!), the waitress gave me a dirty look and stormed off to get it. When we tried to order steamed rice the first time, the server insisted on us getting fried rice, which none of us wanted. We had to firmly say we just wanted plain steamed rice. The place seems very disorganized for the lunch crowd- we didn't have any specific server and just had to ask random people who were milling around and it felt very disorganized. \n\nOverall, underwhelming experience. You can get better food and even better service (or at least food that comes out at the same time!) elsewhere.", "author": "Ayushi A."}

We wanted to sample the menu, and we happened to be seated by the owner Peter, who gladly took our menus away and said he would take care of us. Boy did he!! He brought us table-portioned (enough for 6 people to have a bite or two of each) plates of 11 different entrees!! This is definitely the most fun way to try a new restaurant! I would highly recommend letting then just walk you through their menu if you have a big group!! This was such a fun night! The service was excellent, and everything was so delicious that I forgot to take pictures of everything, but I will gladly fill you in on what you're missing!! These are in order of how they were served, but I've also ranked them #1-11.\n\nPortobello mushrooms: (#3) these were so delicious! Saut\u00e9ed with ponzu sauce and tossed with green onion and cilantro. SOOOOO GOOD \n\nSteamed fried chicken bun: (#4) This one was so great! It was a bite of fried chicken tossed in a sauce similar to orange chicken, then sandwiched on a steamed bun with some cilantro.\n\nShrimp dumpling: (#5) these were absolutely amazing!! The texture on the outside was insane! Excellent crunch without being greasy, and the filling was soft and juicy! \n\nPork dumping: (#8) these were also great!! These were a steamed dumpling style. Soft yummy dough smothered in some kind of brown soy/ponzu/something sauce with a plump serving of pork inside! \n\nSteamed white fish: (#6) this was probably the most surprising of the night; simple, and very tasty!! \n\nApple prawn: (#7) these were so good but I didn't really care for the large chunks of Apple in the dish. Maybe if they had been cut smaller? But the flavor if the Apple was excellent with the battered and fried shrimp. This dish was reminiscent of honey walnut prawns. The sauce was creamy, sweet, and Salty. Super yummy!\n\nClams & duck noodle: (#11) this was the least favorite at the table, but still delicious. Only Because everything else was just.... Better! Haha! The pieces of duck that were in this though - omg so juicy, so delicious\n\nGreen beans - (#2) THIS was a favorite of the table, interestingly enough! These green beans were tossed in a sauce made of heaven!! I'm not sure what it was but it was outrageous! \n\nSpare ribs - (#1) this was the #1 dish out of everything we had. They were crispy on the outside and soft and juicy in the middle. By far the favorite - we ended up ordering a second plate of them!!!\n\nMeat balls with onions - (#9) these pork meatballs were super yummy, but by the time they came to our table everyone was getting full... Definitely worth ordering, but there are LOTS of other more exciting dishes in the menu! \n\nFried chicken with sweet potato - (#10) this one was also a situation where it was really good, definitely worth ordering, but we were all just kind of full when it came out.\n\nYou really can't go wrong ordering any if these dishes, this place is so great!

They have a new presentation.  The server comes to the table with a sizzling hot plate, in the middle of which is a tower of the fried rice.  The server then takes a container that has eggs that are mixed to make scrambled eggs.  She pours the mixture around the circumference of the plate.  She then cooks the eggs and then folds the scrambled eggs into the fried rice.  All I have to say is SENSATIONAL.\n\nThe only down mark I am giving to this restaurant is the prices.

In such a crucial decision of what wonderful place to highlight, some may asks themselves, \"Why would you choose a 3.5 star restaurant as your first?\" And the reason falls within the question... at 3.5 stars, this meal really blew my socks off!\n\nThe only reason this place was on my radar is because one co-worker highly suggested it. Another co-worker said it wasn't close to the best. And the reviews were mixed. So we went in with tempered expectations that were then absolutely launched out of the water.\n\nWe showed up and there was about a 30 minute wait. For a Saturday night in downtown SF, I didn't think it was that bad. So I went to the bar to get a beverage only to find out we could sit there and be served. Boom! Waitlist eliminated. +1 for Fang right off the bat. In the reviews I read to let the restaurant choose your journey. Something I would be game for, but my wife is little more hesitant on. So we decided to ask for recommendations, but still make our own choice.\n\nWe took a few recommendations for entrees, but for starters we went with the Peking Buns and the Wonton Soup (they were out of the sizzling rice soup). This was BY FAR the best Wonton Soup I have ever had. This is not your local Chinese wonton soup with weak broth and gummy noodles. This was a thick, creamy deliciousness with wontons that tasted like they were made right before the soup was served. The buns were equally as delicious and incredibly fresh. The meat filling was so flavorful and was a perfect compliment to the soft, delicious buns.\n\nFor the entree (again under recommendation) we went with the shortribs and the white fish. The short ribs were nothing less of incredible. The bok choy that was in it was perfectly cooked and the ribs were bursting with flavor. The were cooked so uniquely with a very crispy exterior and mouth melting tenderness inside. Highly recommended. The white fish might have played 2 fiddle to the ribs... but that should only speak to the greatness of the ribs and not downplay the fish. The fish was served in a sauce (get some rice to soak this up) and was so flaky, flavorful, and fabulous... the three f's of great fish dishes. All in all an A+ meal and I can't wait to go back.

Also this place is overpriced, would've been ok if there was decent service. Do not go here, mc Donald's is close by.", "author": "Robert L."}

We ordered fried pork potstickers, pork egg rolls, veggie fried rice, short rib house special, and hot & sour soup.  Short rib entree was amazing.  My husband loves hot & sour soup and orders it every time we get Chinese food. He says this was by far the best soup he's ever had.  \n\nThe negative: service was awful. Downright rude and gross.  We went on a Sunday early evening, and the hostess was also the waitress.  She barely took us to our table, instead she casually gestured to a large seating area and left us confused at which table we should be sitting at.  Then, in the middle of taking our order, the phone rang and she interrupted us, mid-order, to go answer the phone and then came back to us and never apologized.  Then, she started sneezing and rubbing her nose and never washed her hands before touching our plates and food!! Disgusting!  Lastly, as good as the soup was, the order that they brought the food out to us was very strange- the soup was brought out last.  \n\nIf you're considering this restaurant you might want to consider take-out to avoid the poor service / rude staff.", "author": "A M F."}

Well that was then and this is now.   Terrible disappointment.   From the rude disapproving looks we got from the girl who seated us and sort of cleaned the table to the over priced unimpressive food we got. \n\n1). Peking bums with duck.   Greasy dry duck with Cilantro in a steamed bun.  Absolutely dry and boring.   Had to order some Hoisin and chili sauce to perk them up so they were edible.   \n\n2.). Pork belly with pumpkin.  A mass of over cooked pumpkin with charred pieces of pork belly.  No defining flavor.  Certainly nothing Chinese Asian or Fusion about them.  Just a mashed up mass of food thrown on the plate with some onions.  Mostly pumpkin.  Unappealing to look at and bland to taste except for the usual taste of pumpkin.   \n\n3.). Short ribs.   Their \"signature\" dish.   Dry pieces (cubes) of short ribs coated in something (hard to know what this sweet Wierd taste was actually) but as you chewed the meat the flavor never identified itself other than it was not pleasant at all.  There was clearly a lot of MSG floating around as I started getting a headache right away.   Didn't know that anyone in San Francisco used that stuff anymore. \n\nAll in all VERY disappointing meal and VERY expensive.  I don't mind spending much more as long as it is good.  Yang Sing is an example.   Dim Sum that is out of this world.  Expensive but worth every dollar.  Avoid this money sink.  Food not worth it.  Restaurant not clean.  Run down.  And at least service we encountered - not acceptable.   But reading the YELP reviews clearly we are not alone.   Management writes the same type of response to each reviewer and clearly it hasn't changed so I don't think we will be back here as she isn't listening to what her public is saying.

Having looked through the menu, my bf and I were about to order when the chef comes by and asks if it's our first time. We said yes, and he promptly took our menus, asked if we don't eat anything, and said he'll take care of us. My bf and I stared at each other because the chef didn't tell us what we were getting, what price we were paying etc. We heard the chef do the same to the two tables next to us. One table asked what dishes he was putting together and he replied with \"do you not trust me? i'm the chef!\"\n\nSo here goes, the chef's recs and my thoughts:\n\n-Mushrooms with barley (4 pieces for $15): Mushrooms tasted ok, nothing special, but come on, let's talk about this price. I was so shocked when the check came and our mushrooms were the same price as our next dish...\n-Crispy honey chili short ribs with RAW bok choy and RAW onions: I wasn't a fan of how the short ribs looked (cubes of beef that were fried...tbh felt like it was leftover unused meat that they took and tossed into our dish). And the vegetables were all RAW...WHAT?!\n-4 shrimp: $28 so $7/shrimp...mediocre price for shrimp that didn't taste very fresh and felt like it was undercooked.\n\nI literally had nothing to eat because I didn't like any of it so we opted to order an additional hot and sour soup. The soup tasted okay but the ingredients they added in were beyond weird (cucumber, peas, chicken, egg), very untraditional.\n\nAnd guess how much the bill came out to be...we spent $90 on this incredibly horrible meal.

Before you jump to thinking \"oh another visitor complaining about restaurant prices in SF\", it has nothing to do with that, at all. So hear me out!\n\nMy boyfriend and I were looking for a quick dinner spot before a movie for date night. We were on our way to Thirsty Bear when we noticed Fang across the street. We had just seen the episode of Kathy Fang on Chopped and on a whim, crossed the street. We always feel proud when we see Asian representation on TV and wanted to support. We walked in and were nervous and kept going back and forth on whether we should stay or not. Feeling adventurous, we stayed when we really should have left right then.\n\nWe had to wait for a table to be cleaned and when we sat down, there were stains all over the wall and the table was really sticky. The menus were really beat up and had white-out prices written all over. We each went to the bathroom and were appalled at how dirty they were. We would be okay with this 'hole-in-the-wall' vibe if we didn't have expectations of this restaurant from what we saw on Chopped.\n\nWe kept feeling uneasy but against our gut feeling, we stayed and looked through the menu. The food prices looked reasonable and we were tired and hungry after work. While looking at the menu, the owner (Kathy's dad?) came and asked if we were first timers and commented on me being Korean. Then took our menus off the table!!! Definitely a red flag! But being in this weird adventure mood, we fell for his charm and he kept insisting that he would take care of it.\n\nThe first dish came out and when we took a bite, we thought we had eaten some exotic animal. The meat chunks tasted like they'd been rubbed with cocoa powder or something then deep fried, served on top of raw bok choy? Then he brought out this super lemon grass soup with tofu skin and maybe a bone broth? Neither of us really liked either dishes but still appreciated a new experience. The owner came by and asked \"the soup is delicious right?\" How are you supposed to even answer that question besides awkwardly nodding your head? This was plenty of food for us already and filled our entire tiny table. When we thought we were finished with our food, an entire fish with tofu sauce came out... are you kidding? We're two people, why would you send us that much food to the point where the waitress had to pull over another table so that all the dishes would fit.\n\nAt this point I was already annoyed. Then we asked for the check and the waiter never came back. So my boyfriend just gave another waitress his credit card and the receipt came out to $98.00!!! Are you serious?! Is this how you expect your customers to come back?? If I wanted to spend $98.00 for dinner tonight, why would we have been on the way to ThIrsty Bear? The other dishes on the menu were affordable and we really didn't need 3 different dishes.\n\nHonestly, we have no one to blame but ourselves. We ignored all the red flags and had to pay for it in the end. I'm just heart broken that in the future, if a chef truly wanted to offer an \"intimate culinary experience\", I would reject it due to my experience here.\n\nFang has left me with my trust broken and my wallet empty.", "author": "Angie S."}

We originally wanted to go to Koi Palace or Dragon Beaux, but due to time, we decided to go somewhere close where my boyfriend lived. Asked for a seat for 4 people and the host said oh please wait I need to check for seats even though clearly there was no one in there. Anyways, we got seated in a crammed area in the corner and can barely move. OK bad start already.\n\nThen we started looking at the menu and then I guess the owner came and rudely asked what we wanted. He heard my boyfriend's parents spoke in mandarin and assumed they are from overseas and said oh let me chose for you and took all our menus away, like wtf. First of all, my boyfriend's parent are from America and have lived in SF for many years, just because they are speaking in another language does not mean they are tourists. My boyfriend went over to the owner and was basically asking him what he was doing and that we were still deciding. Apparently he was trying to order all these expensive dishes for us like fish soup and so forth. Just wow. Oh and he tricked us ordering this big pot of tea which was $15. We originally wanted water, but he said oh drink tea. Usually at Chinese restaurants, tea is free, but not here, so don't get scammed. \n\nAnyways, we got our freaking menus back and then he came over again after like minutes (what a pleasant surprise) and asked us what we wanted to ordered. We got baos, shanghai dumplings, walnut shrimp, shrimp noodle dish and their nanking chicken. Oh let me tell you, when my boyfriend said he wanted to get the nanking chicken the owner said that's what white people eat. I'm sorry, what do you mean that's only what white people eat? So Chinese people can't eat it, like will we get sick or die or something? I mean I don't understand, you just don't say sh*t like that. So please, be careful with your language, cause you can easily offend everyone and their moms. \n\nFood came. Let me tell you, not good at all. Everything was overly salty or overly sweet. I am not saying this because the owner already gave us a bad experience, but this is the truth. It was bad enough that I didn't even bother taking much pics.

I work close by (Capital One) and I found out that one of our MVPs (Managing Vice President) has a relationship with the owner so extra points there. (I thought, awesome! Maybe we can get a corporate discount. Ha!) I have to say, I've been coming here for lunch when I can with my coworkers and the food experience has always been pleasant and relaxed. The 1st time I went, there were about 12 of us. We got seated right away and of the girls knew exactly what to get. The host (I forgot his name but he was nice to us) greeted us and basically just had 1 question. \"Any food allergies in the group\"? When we said no, he walked away and then food just started to come! Apparently, Jess our Office Manager frequents there and the guy knows him pretty well so he took great care of us and made sure the food were all yummy - and they all were! We had about 8-10 dishes (no joke) and each of them has an exquisite, delicious taste. Few items I really enjoyed were: The Duck buns (4.5 stars), The Honey Walnut Prawns (4 stars, the apples with it really sold me), Crispy Short rib (4.5 stars), Eggplant in Chili Garlic Sauce (4 stars, chili and garlic -\nMy 2 favorite words), Mongolian Beef Tower (my favorite Chinese dish at all time so I had to try; pretty legit, 4 stars). Their yummy rose tea is also very tasty! I don't think I'll ever get tired of eating here. The staff, the food, the overall experience is always consistent. I just got engaged and I'm looking for this place to do a post wedding lunch reception since they have a private room upstairs. (Kathy, if you're reading this - I've asked Jimena to ask Caleb for me. Nice to meet you! You're doing a great job at Fangs. I'm a Fan! I'm definitely honing to bring my fianc\u00e9 and mom here! Keep it up!)", "author": "Anna Y."}

Both the host and my not-cyclopean friend raved about Fang and we were able to go online and get a reservation.\n\nWe walked up and cool looking place. We didn't even sit on the top floor but got seated at the bottom floor which had communal seating at long tables (this fact will come back to us). In a rare twist, I didn't actually get to decide on anything - the veterans ordered everything for us and the food was definitely solid. Worth getting to go.\n\nFang's Peking Buns: We got an order each of duck, chicken, pork, and tofu. I got to try the pork and it was solid. The duck sounded really good but it didn't even make a full rotation through the table.\n-Sauteed Garlic Baby Peashoots: I've been enjoying peashoots lately, but this was the only disappointing item. The ones at Burma Superstar are so much better.\n-Honey Apple Prawns: If you love shrimp, you'll love these. Sweet, the apples add to the flavor. These went fast.\n-Fang's Crispy Honey Chili Shortrib: THE MUST ORDER ITEM. My friend raved about how melt in your mouth they are and they were. delicious bite-sized pieces of short rib with a delicious glaze. We got two orders and they were completely devoured. \n-Xiao Long Bao: These came late, and because the meal was slightly ruined when they arrived, so were these.\n-Rice: We didn't actually get this.\n\nOn to the event at hand: so at the other end of the communal table was a group celebrating something. And they had a bottle of champagne. The waiter decides to unscrew the wire hood but not remove it when he pops the cork, which then shoots into not exactly her eye, but the face around it. She's hurt, shocked, and it put a damper on the so far great evening. He gives a half-assed \"I was distracted, sorry.\" and we ask to speak to the manager who also gives a half-assed apology. She did get a nice bottle of wine, but nothing was comped, so we left without tipping.\n\nSo what started off as a great meal ended poorly, but at least my friend didn't lose an eye.", "author": "Michael C."}

I came here with a friend on 07/15/2018 and got there right around 4pm when they open for dinner. The staff were attentive and friendly. I was immediately handed a stack of menus (food and drink). However, the menus were really sticky. The first menu I touched had some kind of sticky sauce that I had to wipe off of my hand with a napkin. And our waiter appeared to be sick. She was constantly hacking up phlegm (loudly), coughing, and sneezing (everywhere!). I understand that people get sick and still need to work, but what was really off-putting was the fact that I never saw her wash her hands, particularly after rubbing her nose with her hand. She did this several times.... and sneezing without covering her mouth (not even with her shirt, sleeve, something!) and continued to handle plates, utensils, and serve people their plates of food and drinks. The couple sitting beside us noticed this too and we were all in shock. I was too grossed out to stay longer than needed. \n\nThe drinks we had (pomegranate margarita and grasshopper mojito) were yummy. I ordered the house noodles and the country rice chowder and they were just okay.

I've enjoyed my two experiences here. The food is heavy in oil, but it's really tasty. It's not exactly authentic Chinese food (compared to others in San Francisco) because it is tapered to a more American palate, but its slightly more authentic than your average Chinese restaurant in the rest of the US I guess. \n\nI suggest going in a large group. That way you can sample alot more of their dishes, and won't even remember the so-so ones. I recommend doing this family style, so everyone can taste and doesn't leave anyone waiting for their dishes. \n\nBased on other reviews, I think the best way to enjoy your experience here is to keep service expectations low, which I know is not right because you're paying good money. That said, sub stellar service really isn't that unusual for any Chinese restaurant. Your food isn't going to arrive in order (appetizers came in between entrees), it's going to arrive in batches, and just eat as you go and focus on the food! When we sat down, we did all agree that based on previous experience, the service here was not that great, although the owner is friendly and eager to teach you how to eat the Shanghai soup dumplings. \n\nDish recommendations:\n- Peking buns with duck \n- crispy shortrib\n- sauteed porkbelly\n- nanking sesame chicken\n\nThose are my favorites. All really flavorful (and very sweet), but so, so delicious. Some of the others that are pretty good is cold meifun noodles, honey apple prawns, Shanghai soup dumplings were pretty decent.", "author": "Ke C."}

The hosts put our party in the basement by ourselves and served a set menu. It was an enjoyable meal, I don't remember much of it other than the walnut shrimp was excellent.\n\nLast night I went to Fang again with a small group. While my friend and I were hemming and hawing about what to order, trying to decipher the handwritten Chinese menu, Mr Fang himself came by and told us he'd help us order. When the rest of our group showed up, Mr Fang took away the menus and said he'd take care of it! Everything he ordered for us was delicious. It's quite a few more vegetable dishes (broad beans, pea shoots, portobello mushrooms with shrimp) than what I would have normally ordered, but I'm so glad he did so I tried things I normally wouldn't have. The standout dish is a clam and egg custard, and these baby bok choy that came on the side of a beef rib dish (crisp but not raw what black magic is this). \n\nSo happy to have such a great Chinese restaurant right in the center of the city, I'll be back soon!", "author": "Sylvia W."}

The fried roll had a good flavor, but the mustard sauce that came with it was bad. Chinese mustard and American mustard are different and I will let you guess which one they used.\n\nThe sizzling rice soup was to me day old rice that was fried and the soup was just some chicken broth with frozen peas and chopped up zucchini.

I got here before my friend did. They seated me in this awkward-ass nook like right behind the check-in counter/host stand or whatever when there is plenty of seating in the center of the restaurant. I'm like lmao ok, that's cool. It's just a seat. (I honestly was just like 'lol', because my friend couldn't find me after she came in, even after I was calling her name. The nook is *that* awkward.) \n\nI got the Crispy Egg Noodles with Chicken because a lot of the things on the menu were overpriced for me, but this is also San Francisco, so okay whatever it's fine. The food came. It was ok, nothing special. Chinese food re-styled for mainstream American tastes. Same old, same old. (I honestly enjoyed it still, I'm Panda Express Fan #1 lmao)\n\nBut here's the kicker. I didn't finish my food. There was just a bit left; not enough for a whole meal, but idk, I paid money for this, so I wanted to take it home. And so the manager or whoever in charge comes over and gives my friend a box, because she had a significantly larger portion left than I did, and didn't give me one. At this point, it's okay I mean - fair assumption that I wouldn't want it.\n\nBut I wanted it, so I ask for a box. And this lady hella gives me this hella judgmental look and seems super reluctant to give me a box but I insist I want one and she brings one over.\n\nAnd so I'm honestly like WHAT. Are ur boxes made of freaking Tang Dynasty gold? Idgaf if I had one freaking noodle left, I paid for this and if I wanna take it home, I don't deserve dirty looks from you of ANY SORT. Unless your boxes are made of Tang Dynasty gold, which ok. BUT THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE JUST YOUR REGULAR FREAKING CHINESE TAKE OUT BOXES. Bye. Tired of people that judge others for wanting to eat everything they pay for.

Plus the food was all over cooked with tons of soy sauce, it reduced the veggies to an unexplainable mysterious sauce that all of our dishes had.

The peking buns were very underwhelming, dry, and nothing special. The dumplings were just okay, they too had too much dough and the sauce accompanying them was the only slightly pleasant flavor tasted this whole experience and it was just soy sauce and chili.

I was expecting mostly mediocre Chinese food but ended up enjoying most of the dishes we got. We asked the chef for a few specific dishes (Nanking chicken, potstickers, xiao long Bao) and requested them to pick the rest of the dishes for us, which really made ordering a lot easier! I was slightly skeptical of what they would bring out but I must say I was mostly impressed (my expectations were set a little low tho haha). There were a few misses - I wasn't fond of the fish clay pot or the weird dumplings filled with peas. I think I probably enjoyed everything else (besides the tofu dish which I didn't try because I don't like tofu). We got a pretty interesting noodle dish with different but good flavor (I wish I knew what these dishes were but unfortunately since they were chef's choices we don't really get to see the dish names :p). Nanking chicken was of course delicious. Xiao long baos are just okay here but I wouldn't have expected excellent xlbs as it's generally hard to find amazing ones. There was also a pretty good beef dish that also had some interesting atypical flavors (not fond of the raw bok choy tho, I don't think I've ever eaten that raw lol). The (walnut-less) prawns were good and came with.. sweet potato? Not sure but it was pretty good and also one of us had a walnut allergy so it ended up working out lol. Overall I think the restaurant plays around with typical Chinese flavors and dishes but most of them paid off. I will say that if you're expecting your usual Chinese dishes you may not quite get what you were expecting since the flavors here aren't super typical. I mostly enjoyed their take on the dishes and it was fun to see what the chef picked out for us. Definitely easier than poring over the menu and trying to get everybody to agree to some dishes! The price also came out pretty reasonable for the experience we got and the fancier atmosphere - around $30 per person.

The 5 of us sat down and wee handed menus. We were looking it over and discussing things we normally like and usually get. We had decided on what to get and were ready to order. An older gentleman cane over to the table and introduced himself, he was Peter, owner of the restaurant and asked if it was our first time. He then proceeded to take our menus, give us a wink and said, he'll take good care of us. He asked if we had any allergies and within a few minutes, food started appearing at our table. Here is what we received:\n\nSaut\u00e9ed Fava beans - it looks like they are off menu. It was yummy, I love the fragrant onions topped on them. \nPickled cucumber - also, off menu and were a hit! They had a great crunch to them but you could taste the vinegar and sesame oil, it was SUPER YUMMY! \nSteamed baos - our protein was chicken, it was good but I was hoping for duck! \nFive spice whitefish - delicate and delicious it was on the sweeter side\nFang's crispy honey short ribs - these were my ALL TIME FAVORITE! They were melt in your mouth delicious! Paired with the pickled bok Choi and onions, it was a perfect pairing, so much so, we had to order a second dish! \nDuck and clam noodle dish - it looks like it was not on the menu but it was sooo dang delish. The noodles looked hand pulled. It was SOOOOO YUMMY! \nHoney apple prawns - similar to your usual honey walnut prawn, but such a strange pairing that works so well together that the tanginess of the apple cuts the richness of the mayo. He nailed it!\n\nIronically enough, most of the items that showed up ended up being everything we wanted to order that we thought he had hidden mics in the menu! \n\nThis was honestly such a great experience, I love that the owner was there that took care of us, I love that it had an element of surprise.

It's not immediately obvious from just peering in through the door, but they have a large downstairs seating area where they can seat multiple groups of 15-20. If you're bringing that many people, the best way to go is to have them bring you the set menu, along with a hot tea. They'll ask you if your group has any dietary restrictions, and they do a good job of bringing proportional amounts of food based on who can eat what (e.g. having one vegetarian in the group doesn't mean that everyone is eating vegetarian, but the vegetarian will still have plenty of food that is compatible). That's when the fun starts: they'll bring seemingly endless courses to the table for you to divvy up as you see fit. I *think* it's possible to influence what shows up, but I don't know why you'd want to. If you let them take care of it, you'll have a good time.\n\nThe traditional small-group experience is good, too.

About an hour after eating here, I started feeling really sick from the oil taste in my mouth. I actually love watching Chopped and clearly remember the episode where the Chef here went on and won. I'm all for inspiring and baller Asian women as role models, but was really disappointed with my experience at Fang. The lady at the front of the restaurant made me stand in the windy doorway for 35 minutes because the rest of my party was stuck in the Giants game traffic. I asked her if i could sit, and she said to wait. I kept waiting, making eye contact, and when my parents finally showed up at 12:30, the hostess still avoided my eye contact and proceeded to seat several other parties around me. At this point, I had lost my patience and demanded to sit down. She made me wait another five minutes before letting my sit. To top it off, the seat I was about to sit in had sauce all over it too. \n\n[Food]\nI saw in some previous reviews that the chef likes to order food for you. They also gave us a Chinese menu where my very Chinese mother was very confused by the unreadable words. No english menu was given to us. Echoing some sentiment here, I think it's kind of rude to just assume a Chinese family walking in the door doesn't need an English menu. My dad is very indecisive so we just went ahead and let the chef order some food for us. We had this bone soup that tasted extremely lukewarm, curry fish, vegetables, eggplant and tofu, and roast pork. I really was not a fan of any of the dishes and I was not a fan of the atmosphere - the open kitchen really didn't work here because it was dingy and the air felt extremely stuffy as the oil sizzled in the kitchen and let out loud sounds and puffs of smoke. I know that the health score here improved, but I did not feel like the restaurant was clean. There were cobwebs hanging over the kitchen stove and dust and hair on a lot of the furniture at the front. Not a good setting to walk into before you're going to eat.  \n\n[Decor]\nThe spacing of the tables was awkward. We were seated very close to the stairs leading to the lower floor, and one of the moms at my table kept having to scoot in every time someone passed. Also, the tables are very close to each other. Decor wise, it is a bit much. I appreciate the references to Chinese culture, but it's worth dusting off the furniture once in a while to make it look less scarily antique. \n\n[Mealpal]\nI've had the sizzling rice soup and the duck buns here on Mealpal for lunch. The duck buns were actually pretty good, even though the lunch was pretty tiny. I had also liked the sizzling rice soup.\n\nI'm sorry Ms. Fang. I really can't recommend your restaurant to my friends right now. It's been about an hour since I finished eating and my stomach does not feel very good at all.", "author": "Alice Z."}

I was unsettled (especially knowing that in my group of six I was the lone vegetarian). So, I checked the menu to make sure there were herbivore options so that I could just order something while my friends played gastronomical Russian Roulette.\n\nHowever, when we were sat down someone asked the father of the lovely chef if they could do their food trust fall with a vegetarian. He looked over at me, winked, and pointed like we were in the know of some super secret special club. I found this insanely charming; my icy exterior melted and I allowed myself to be part of the chef's choice game. \n\nI tried a wonderful array of things:\n+ Large, meaty mushrooms braised in shitake broth\n+ A perfectly seasoned snow pea salad\n+ A refreshing edamame and noodle salad\n+ And Peking Buns with fried zucchini, plum sauce, and scallions that were finger-licking good\n\nMy friends continued eating when a chicken dish, a shrimp dish, a beef dish, and a scallop dish were all brought out. That second half of the meal is when it became both awkward and boring for me... it's always weird to listen to your dining companions go on and on about how delicious their food is and how absolutely full they are when you're picking away at a salad. It would have rocked if Fang had brought me out some more of those divine vegetarian Peking Buns while they were dining on their mains.\n\nWas it good? Yes. Did I leave super satisfied and satiated like my meat-eating dining friends? Not at all. As I assumed - playing the \"I trust you\" game as an herbivore with omnivore friends just isn't as fun or appealing as I think it was for them.

In fact, the food is pretty well done and the dishes aren't bad at all. But when you're competing with some of the best dining options in the nation and maybe even the world, this falls short.\n\nThe owner is very congenial. He will come to your table and try to get to know your tastes. As other reviews might mention, he will even ask \"Do you trust me?\" and he'll figure out something for you hoping to match your tastes.\n\nFor some this might work. For us, it was not the right choice. I shouldn't have trusted him - lol. The bill also became much more than I felt was worth paying, but oh well it was my fault.\n\nThe food ended up being a little too salty for our taste but I have to say, he was enthusastic and seemed to enjoy what he's doing.\n\nDR;TL: decent comfort food.

Our booking appeared not to be found, we were put into a table in the far corner where other guests had to get out of their chairs so we could squeeze in!! After that it became laughable - our order was taken finally (drinks, starters and main course) 5 minutes later my main course was passed over the heads of the table next to us by a surly waitress but no drinks or starters. When we could finally get a waiter they removed it with bad grace and as predicted by us it was just left on the side to go cold and given back to me 20 minutes later once my drink and starter had been served (didn't even bother to warm it, let alone cook a fresh one!). It felt like they couldn't get rid of us fast enough as the other main course were plonked on the table whilst starters were still being eaten, no more drinks were offered, and they seemed surprised when we said we weren't paying for my main course!!

This is a fairly decent place with a get the food on the table at all costs mentality. Very little attention to service but overall efficient.  Don't expect a nice leisurely dinner as the pace is fast and meant to be eaten family style so most of the food comes out around the same time.  The food is flavorful but not overly spicy as one might expect especially for some of the Szechuan dishes. I really enjoyed the Szechuan prawns (with added chili), handmade noodles with beef and the pork dumplings in sauce. The spa ribs were way too sweet.

True rating closer to 3.5.\n\nI came here with a party of 4 for dinner. The restaurant is clean and service was fast. The 4 of us ordered 5 dishes, which turned out to be too much food and we had a lot of leftovers to take home. We ordered:\n\nPork bone soup with vegetables and noodles ($20 for large): this soup was delicious. The broth had been simmered for days and had a real complexity of flavor. There were a lot of ingredients like pork meatballs, noodles, and tofu-like bean curd. A large is definitely more than enough for 6 people. We couldn't finish it.\nBBQ pork spareribs with bok choy ($17.95): my favorite dish of the night. The spareribs were tender and crispy on the outside, and we're both savory and sweet. The meat paired very well with the freshness of the bok choy. My only complaint is for the size of the dish, the price is too expensive.\nSalted pork belly with pumpkin ($17.95): pork belly was tender and melt-in-your-mouth, although on the fatty side. I felt that pairing with pumpkin was an odd choice. I've never had those flavors combined together in Chinese cuisine and the pairing threw me off a little. \nPanfried flounder with yellow curry sauce and chili oil (market price): the fish was so tender and flavorful! I really enjoyed this dish. \nSaut\u00e9ed pea shoots in garlic ($9.95): solid vegetarian accompaniment to the meal.\n\nOverall the meal was solid, but for $30 per person after tax and tip, I didn't think the value was that great.", "author": "Amy C."}

Mediocre is definitely how would describe it, with terrible service. As some other reviews here have pointed out, the place was a little dirty, and if things are dirty in the dining room, I'd be worried to see the kitchen.\n\nShortly after being seated someone who I assume was the owner (he was in what I can best describe as a jogging suit) took our orders. After finishing, he pressed us if we wanted some tea to go with it instead of water. This was our first mistake, as we should have assumed it would be a pricey drink, though I didn't expect them to be $8 a pop. That was our fault for letting ourselves get conned, but doesn't make me any happier with the service. At least it was decent tea.\n\nI ordered the sesame chicken. I've had better in cheap Chinese takeout places that have the standard menus. It had far too much spice to it, to the point of overwhelming the other flavors. I'm not a weenie when it comes to spice either. I found the sweet potatoes to be a bit thick with it, and they were unevenly sliced and cooked very differently as a result. My friend had one of the noodle dishes, which tasted primarily of black pepper. I also placed a small order of white rice with it, which I had to ask for again to make sure it came out. This may have been a mistake, as we ended up having an extra bowl of rice charged to us (despite only getting the one). When we asked them to take it off the bill, they changed it to a smaller bowl of rice, and by that point we were ready to leave and just paid the dollar, as we had been sitting for some time waiting on the check.\n\nAll in all, by far the most disappointing $25 I've spent on a meal.

There wasn't anyone to greet us at the door and noticed that there were only 2 other people in the restaurant finishing up their tea.  There were 6 employees sitting at a table by the kitchen area eating.  I asked if they were closed between lunch and dinner, and the staff said \"No, we are open.\"\n\nWe sat at a table and felt that we were just disturbing the staff's lunch.  The waiter gave us the menus then came back after 15mins to take our order.  Considering that we were now the only 2 patrons in the restaurant, the food took exceptionally long to arrive (21 minutes).  The waiter only came by one time... to give us the check.  Horrible customer service; maybe they really were closed but didn't want to turn us away - at least provide great customer service to the ONLY 2 people there!\n\nThe food is good and it is reasonably priced.  I ordered the Nanking Chicken (as I always do from House of Nanking), the Fried Onion Cake, and the Panfried Shrimp Dumplings.  The Nanking Chicken is always good but could have had a little more sauce.  The Fried Onion Cake was a little dry and the shrimp in the dumplings was cooked very well.  I recommend coming here for their lunch menu; same food, smaller portion for one (as opposed to the dinner menu that is more family-style), and cheaper.  Maybe visit when they are actually \"open\" for good service.", "author": "Tina W."}

The waitress brought us the first dish, fried flounder, and she asked, \"who has the shrimp allergy?\" I pointed to my son, and she said to him, \"The fish is fried in shrimp oil, so you don't eat it,\" & then she walked away. I got angry and yelled, \"Wait a minute. You can't do that. You asked about food allergies. We ordered the fish for him. You cant just tell him not to eat it.\" So she took the flounder back and brought another one 15 minutes later. \n\n2 of the 4 dishes had way too much vinegar, but eggplant & saut\u00e9ed calamari were good.

So it was all tough-stuff-to-eat and no thrills.\n\nBut the greens that came with the shrimp?\n\nOMG etc etc .....\n\nI happily traded shrimp for greens - which almost never happens in real life.\n\nThey bring you your beverages late in the meal unless you absolutely insist on getting them earlier.\n\nThis turns out to be exactly the right move.\n\nThe drinks would have distracted from the business at hand ...\n\nbut their house teas are very very good and deserving of their own attention as a closing act.\n\nWe had a berry infused tea that was served in german-like steins at the end of the meal, that was the perfect final touch.\n\nIt washed down the meal, it digested, it filled all the little empty places.\n\nWe left very happy.\n\nIf you want traditional Chinese, or regional Chinese, this is not your place.\n\nThis is \"cook messing around in the kitchen making creative dishes\" Chinese.\n\nThis cook can mess around as much as he or she likes as far as I am concerned.", "author": "Samuel C."}

As previous posters have mentioned, the restaurant has its own secret menu where they take traditional dishes and put an awesome spin to them to make them even tastier than they were before. The inventiveness is extremely noteworthy and I've never seen a Chinese restaurant do it as well as they have. Definitely a must try and it keeps me coming back.\n\nOn top of this, the prices are unbelievably affordable for the quality of food you're getting and relative to SF prices. For example, one time we went we ordered 2 apps (delicious cucumber salad, seasoned beef cubes), 2 very generously portioned entrees (brown rice/chicken stir-fry in a clay pot, hot pot fish fillet dish), and a complimentary dessert (red bean sesame balls) and this totaled to ($50-60) aka a total steal.\n\nAmbiance is also pretty good and the bathrooms are super nice and clean.\n\nLastly the staff are incredibly friendly.

He was like \"no, I got you, I got you.\"  And we were like... oh man, we must be special or something. #thought \n\nTurns out the owner is fairly well known for doing this for patrons. \n\nWell, we enjoyed the meal.  But at the end of the day, we were like, we wanted to try a few dishes and while it was nice, we wish we made our own choices... you know like... what you do at a restaurant when you go there. But it was a one of kind experience, and we all remembered it fondly.  \n\nSo, this second time when I went with five of my coworkers, I was aware that this might happen.  So, I made sure to take a look at the menu and choose a few things to start off our order before the owner came over and possibly took the wheel of the ship away from us. \n\nAnd like clock work, he came over and told us that he was gonna treat us, and was FAIRLY INSISTENT. But... I really wanted to try a few dishes, so I was like... \n\n\"Ok that's fine... but I really want to get the Xiao Long Bao\" saying the listed \"Soup Dumplings\" by their proper Chinese name *so he knows I'm there to do business.  He seemingly writes it down. \n\n\"Also, can we get an order of the mei fun ( noodles with spicy chiles- like my favorite thing ever), and also some steamed bao, and some of the postickers\" \n\nHe seemingly writes this down... and then brings us 7-8 dishes. 1 of which is what I asked for.  He brought the potstickers.................. \n\nWe didn't get any Xiao Long Bao, or Mei Fun................... \n\nWe got bao taco things... which were GOOD, but I wanted steamed buns with the filling in the middle.\n\nWe ended up with one of their signature shrimp dishes that is buried in a heavy sweet sauce with apples (not what I would have ordered, but it was good).  \n\nWe also ended up with these like pea shoot like things sauteed in garlic, which were good.  \n\nWe had some fish, which I wouldn't order again, I think it was bland. \n\nWe ended up with some chicken dish- pretty much all dishes dropped on the table were not named... so it was pretty much a guessing game. \n\nSo... did I enjoy my meal. Yeah... you know what, I enjoyed about half of the dishes he brought out, but they definitely wouldn't have been what I would have ordered. \n\nThe biggest problem about this whole predicament, was that he kept bringing out dishes without accounting for the cost of anything. He didn't ask our budget, he didn't ask if we wanted to stop after a certain number of dishes...  we ended up spending much more than we intended. \n\nCause that's also one of those things you take into account in the ordering process... \n\nI don't think I'll be back again -\u00a0I'm way too much of a control freak to do this again.", "author": "Mike B."}

Evidently having the owner hand-pick your meal items for you is a common practice here at Fang, and I'm oh-so-glad that we let him do his thang. I'll get to his picks in a moment, but first up are the appies that we ordered while waiting at the bar for our table.\n\nWe started with the duck buns, which were fluffy baos filled with super crispy duck (you can also get beef, chicken, or tofu, I think), and extraspecialdelicious. I can see why they are one of the most recommended items at Fang! We also got the scallion pancake, which was very different than we were expecting (like a double layered crispy scallion crepe, almost!) but still tasty. I do prefer the traditional, softer scallion pancake though, I think.\n\nFor our main meal, the owner served up honey shrimp with apples, which were lightly fried shrimp in a sweet honey sauce, and grilled apples. I LOVED this dish, thought it was sosososo good, though my dining companions found it a little too sweet for their taste.\n\nWe also got a five-spice beef, which was thinly sliced beef in a delicious sauce. It was fall apart tender and really delicious.\n\nAnd lastly, we were served up some delightful steamed fish in a soy-type sauce. We were so full at this point we didn't get to eat as much of the fish as we liked, but I can attest it was still great!\n\nI really enjoyed my meal at Fang, which felt both modern and authentic at the same time. Waitstaff was great, as was the owner. My only complaint, and it's small, is that the owner didn't do too much prodding before whisking away to put in his order for us. You know, didn't ask if anyone had any dietary restrictions, did or didn't like spicy food, etc. It didn't matter because Mike B, Kimberly S, and I are all equal-food opportunists and literally nothing is off the table for us, but had we been dining with someone who did have preferences or requirements, it would have probably been good of him to make sure we all were gonna eat what he brought us.\n\nAny way you go about it though, I would totally come back to Fang in a heartbeat (which is a good thing, considering it's a mere hop, skip, and throw away from Yelp's new HQ!), and look forward to getting to try even more of their delicious items in the future!", "author": "Gretchen F."}

ALSO, it's lent and I gave up a lot like rice, meat, fried chicken etc... Bartender guy accommodated to my request of \"something not to heavy and I can't eat ...(gives list)...

Generous serving. The bak Choy itself wasn't boiled down, it was nearly in its raw form mixed with onions, garlic, basil, and olive oil. Nice crunch, served like a \"salad\" in away. And the bak Choy is clean.. No dirt between the stems and no holes on the leaves. I can't stand beat up vegetables. I enjoyed it!\n\nFANG'S PEKING BUMS ($5?) - happy hour menu. It usually comes with 4 buns but with my accommodations he did a half order (2 buns) just for me!!! I'm picky about wasting food and I don't eat that much and I'd hate to waste any leftovers. The buns were very filling. Fluffy, soft and semi-sweet buns, just the way I liked them. I ordered it with chicken and it's mixed with some sliced greens and cilantro. The cilantro was a great twist to it, made it much tastier. I'm a sucker for cilantro so it hit the spot for me. The marinade on the chicken wasn't too saucy, great balance with chicken to sauce ratio. I enjoyed this dish and highly recommend it. \n\nSUNRISE \"SOMETHING\" - I forgot the name of my cocktail. I asked the bartender for something light, sweet, and refreshing like a Mojito but not a Mojito and he made this drink. It was nice.. Light hints of blue berry and orange with the kick if mint like a Mojito but not. Didn't give me a buzz so the drinks are weak. But great HH prices!!\n\nWill I be back? Yup.

The owner (an elderly guy with short white hair) took the time to chat with me about which dishes I felt like having that night and the wait staff was very attentive as well. \n\nMy group of 4 ate about 6 dishes ranging from stir fried veggies to beef short ribs to noodles with clam and fillets of white fish in a dark sauce. We were stuffed and walked away very happy. Yes, the price is a bit higher than what you'd find in Chinatown but the quality was well worth it. \n\nIt surprised me that this restaurant had negative reviews, but it didn't shock me having read into what other people ordered.

Then on Yelp, everyone was suggesting the same so I figured it's a good plan.\n\nI wasn't sure how that whole thing worked though... did we need to be selected by the chef for such an honor? was there a secret password that I needed to earn Indiana Jones style? should I just say \"I'll have what Fang's having?\" Uncertainty was running a muck.\n\nFortunately, we let the waitress know that this was our rodeo and she suggested letting them order for us. She asked if we had any dietary restrictions or preferences towards veggie, meat, or seafood and she was off. The plates started coming shortly after and they just kept coming. We started with 3 people and had a 4th join late. They accommodated and upped the portions for the following dishes.

The salted pork belly was hard, rough, and way too salty.  There was no pork taste.  At $19, the quantity was also lacking.  The eggplant in garlic sauce was also extremely salty.  Furthermore, the eggplant was not cooked properly - the skin was hard and leathery.  Overall, I would not come back.", "author": "Simon G."}

I think 3 different people came over to take our order and they were not very friendly or personable.  They were robotic and basic at best. We started with the onion fried bread appetizer and that was very good.  You must try it!  That was my favorite thing I ordered.  Then we got the veggie lettuce wraps, which were pretty tasty--nothing spectacular though. The veggies could have been cooked a little longer and I would have like a little more flavor.  In fact, I ordered more of the peanut sauce that came with bread because it was tasty.  Then I had the tofu bun. I 've had better tofu, but over all the food was decent and I would go back.  Hopefully, they can work on their hospitality and personable skills.  Pretty good ambiance too, but a little noisy.  It's worth checking out though.", "author": "Megan M."}

He ordered onion cake and veggie dumplings for us which came out to me delicious. Fang became my favorite Chinese restaurant in SF!\n\n2nd time: After an amazing experience with this place we decided to go here on valentine's day (2016). Service wasn't as welcoming as first time but food was still good (not as great as last time). I gave my 2nd experience a benefit of doubt and still thought Fang is my favorite Chinese place.\n\n3rd time: I decided to take a very important person (who was visiting SF) here on a Monday evening, we had our reservation for 8 pm, it still took about 20 mins to get us seated (which is fine in SF). Chef came in to take our order, he was so rude and seemed not at all interested! He just stopped responding in the middle while writing our order and moved to the next table! Then he comes back and continues his rude gesture! He suggested me a soup which BTW they forgot to bring in. After waiting for a looooooong time, I asked them about it and the soup came in about 20 mins after that. Chef said it was their specialty soup, honestly it was just warm milk with rice crispy in it and may be some sauce.\n\nI was almost embarrassed to bring in a guest at this place and have made my mind not to go here ever again. \nIf you read yelp reviews before going here, consider yourself lucky.

The fish order we had was my favorite along with the house noodles! Super filling before the noodle even came out. Also liked the pork dumplings because it had an interesting tiny sweetness to it. Everything else was decent and I liked the decor. However, the only disappointment were the vegetarian dishes - they were super bland as if they weren't adding spices to them. The tofu with sweet potatoes were bland unless you drenched the tofu with sauce. The curry tofu dish was also very tasteless and not spicy.

Do t fall for the upscale lighting, this place is a not worth the price . We were walking in the neighborhood looking for a good restaurant when we saw FANG. The exterior looked nice and the backlit bar (red) was a nice touch and we thought we'd stumbled on a gem. Sadly NOT the case....some specifics: the menus are dirty and prices have been whited out and increased, not classy. Waiters are harried and \"no frills\". We ordered an appetizer, two entrees and a noodle dish. One entree arrived and was slammed down on our table....followed a few minutes later by the second entree and THEN the appetizer...finally the noodles arrived as we were just about finished with the entrees....there was nothing special about the entrees or appetizer, I've had better from a hole in the wall take out place. Gummy sauces and tough chicken, the shrimp gyoza was greasy but the noodles and veg dish was the worst. A mountain of over cooked veggies with some dry noodles buried in the middle. Totally overlooked and flavorless. We ordered tea and were served \"blossoming jasmine tea\" which I though was a nice touch, however when the ball bloomed, the flavor quickly got too strong and bitter and we were charged $3.50 each, a premium for tea unless you get a tea menu and choose an exotic flavoFor the prices they charge per dish, I was expecting something special but left angry at spending so much money for a very mediocre meal...never again.", "author": "Brent O."}

We usually come on a Saturday afternoon when we might be the only patrons in the place. Even on those occasions the service was not that great but I figure we are not in a hurry and they must be prepping for the evening time when they do get busy. \n\nI came to Fang for lunch 12/28 and it was pretty busy. My observations:\n*  as other reviewers have mentioned the place not that clean. \n*  service is disorganized and they don't communicate with each other\n\nCleanliness/presentation...\nWhile I was waiting I did notice how dirty the restaurant dining area was. It was as if when they do clean they just mop around the furniture. Kind of gross. Other things I observed is they need to upholsterer all of their chairs and benches... they are torn, stained, etc.  Lastly, I find this a bit tacky... when they increase prices on their menu items they put tape over it and write in the new price.  Just print new menus!!\n\nLet me elaborate on the service ...\nTwo of us arrive and stand at the entry way while two employees don't acknowledge us for about 5 minutes. The female looks up asks how many?  I say 3. She says wait. Then the guy looks up a few minutes later and asks the same thing and says wait. I was wondering if they were waiting for our third person to show... who knows. Anyway, we were finally sat at a table and then the staff proceeded to ignore us for another 10-15 minutes or so. I was annoyed.\n\nSo, finally a older gentleman comes and takes our order... we all say what we want and he heads off.  Our drinks take FOREVER to come.  After a little while another younger server comes and asks to take our order which we told him that the older gentleman took our order and he said something to the effect of \"He probably forgot...\"  I was suspicious because I didn't want duplicate dishes coming out but he remained staring at us so we placed our order again with the young man.  I should have listened to myself because the moment he walked away our dishes started to come out.  We quickly had to flag down the second server so that we wouldn't get duplicated dishes.  \nWe were never checked upon again... I wanted another glass of wine but I could tell they were never coming back to our table unless I made a scene to get their attention so I decided not to give them any more of my money.  Don't they know that alcohol sales is where you make your money??\n\nAnyway, that is my two cents ... the food is good.  If you are going for a dining experience you might be disappointed.", "author": "Halley S."}

Shortly after I was seated they seated a table of bratty kids next to me, strike one. I had a server come and take my order followed by a second server asking if my order had been taken followed by a third server asking what did you order  again? I ordered the Mongolian beef and steamed rice with green tea. The server hit me in the head with his ass three times when taking the order of the table next to me. Not even any reason for him to back into me, the place isn't that small. The beef came out fast, followed by the rice about 13 minutes later! Strike two.  The beef was bland and the rice was warmed over. Strike three . And for the price of $27, It truly was not worth it. I sat through my entire meal staring at the \"thirsty bear\" grill across the street and wishing I had gone there instead.

We agreed, told him we were all vegetarians. I was a bit apprehensive that he would order some of the more expensive dishes, but figured the vegetarian dishes were all somewhat reasonable (as compared to the meat dishes). The couple at the table next to ours assured us they always had him choose for them.\n- the food he selected and sent out was very delicious and just perfect in quantity for us, and thankfully not too expensive . We got the buns with some filling, crispy dumplings, a vegetable curry and the house noodles. \n- we had some unfortunate stuff show up in one of the dishes and when we told them, they replaced the dish, no questions asked.

The dishes we had ranged from mediocre to great. \n\nSteamed Shanghai Soup Dumplings - 2/5 - Really thick skin and barely any broth inside these sad dumplings.\n\nPork Steamed Bun - 5/5 - So freaking awesome! The bread was like a cloud: soft, airy, and delicious. Some of the meat inside was chewy, while other pieces were crispy. This was definitely my favorite dish. \n\nFried Shrimp Potstickers - 1/5 - Very sad excuse for potstickers. The skin was super thin and was already falling apart as the dish was brought to our table. The shrimp inside was uninspiring and didn't do this dish any favors.\n\nFried Shishito Peppers - 2/5 - The peppers were too damn salty!\n\nHoney Apple Shrimp - 3/5 - Like Honey Walnut Shrimp sans walnut plus fried apple pieces: fried shrimp and apple lathered in a decadent mayo sauce.

I really don't understand the fusion aspect of their cuisine; I grew up eating Cantonese food and a lot of the flavors and textures don't make a lot of sense to me.\n\nWhat I do appreciate about this restaurant is how well they can quickly spin up a menu for a large group without much decision making from the guest themselves. This has been great for my mix of vegetarian and meat eating colleagues and we've been able to feed the team this way. \n\nSome staples of the large group menu are the shrimp with apple, chicken with sweet potatoes, this deep fried beef with raw baby bok choy, and little baos. The bao dish (I can't remember the name, but it's like Cantonese Peking duck with the mantou/bread with meat inside) is actually my favorite thing to eat here because there's an appropriate combination of crunchy textures and meat and does come in a vegetarian variety. However, the other dishes kind of fall short when it comes to textures and flavors -- my biggest gripe is with the beef and baby bok choy dish because the bok choy is still raw and the bitterness distracts from the beef. It would be better if they just, I dunno, cooked it completely. \n\nI know this restaurant defends itself very staunchly on its menu items, so the biggest piece of feedback I have is regarding the service. My large group of 12 people were being watched like eagles by the wait staff and hovered over us as we ate. A server at one point reached over and scooped me a healthy serving of the mushroom sticky rice while I'm eating something else, reassuring me that it's \"very good\". This was very uncomfortable because (1) I'm full and (2) I didn't want to offend the server by refusing to eat.

RUDE STAFF/OWNER and BURNT FOOD.\n\nI've been a fan of Fang after having a 5 star experience earlier this year. However, this time around, I not only found the staff and owner extremely rude, I was shocked to see how much the quality of food has deteriorated.\n\n1-STAR OPERATIONS: Earlier this evening, we visited the restaurant for dinner. After being told that there was going to be a few minutes wait, we decided to stay. The waitress told us repeatedly that our table would be ready in minutes. However, we ended up standing and waiting for 45 minutes before we got seated. I understand the restaurant was busy but I'd appreciate being told in advance that there was no availability instead of being hung up like that. \n\n1-STAR SERVICE: After I expressed my discontent about the wait, things went downhill from there. After we got seated, it was impossible to get the attention from the waiting staff. The owner eventually came by but brushed my complaints off and just flat out walked away as I was speaking to him; this had never happened to me in a restaurant. You would think that the owner would care about customer complaints but he obviously did not. I then got a sense that they were really just trying to get our dishes out so they could get rid off us. \n\n2-STAR FOOD: The food was drastically different from how I remembered it to be. We ordered 2 dishes from the Chinese menu and 1 from the English menu. The egg plant tasted burnt and very mediocre. The peppered fried tofu was heavily breaded, overly fried/burnt and covered in nasty bread crumbs (as if they didn't use fresh oil to prepare the tofu). I didn't even bother to complain this time because I was so done with this place, knowing that the owner didn't even care about his customers. \n\nBefore we even finished the dinner and asked for the check, the server rushed over to put our check on the table as a sign of protest. \n\nUnsurprisingly, everyone at our dinner table agreed that we will NOT be coming back to this place.", "author": "Chris G."}

Despite our large group and the busy lunchtime crowd, our service was great.\n\nI ordered hot tea. It came in a giant glass mug with a bundle that eventually opened up and bloomed into a flower. The flavor was just okay. I was more amazed watching the action unfold inside the mug.\n\nLet's talk food:\n\nFried egg rolls: Amazing. I would say this is the must get app. I probably could've taken down two orders by myself.\n\nSteamed soup dumplings: My first time having these. Surprisingly full of flavor for such a small package. Very good. \n\nSalt & pepper shrimp and mushrooms: Great combination with the red onions. I ordered a side of fried rice to go with it. The fried rice alone wasn't packed with a lot of flavor, but was great paired with the different entrees.\n\nSesame chicken: This was unlike any sesame chicken I have ever had. The squash and sweet potatoes take the dish to a whole new level. \n\nCrispy honey steak: Wow this was good. I think this wins out of the three lunch plates we had. (Don't get me wrong, I would order all three again)\n\nFantastic lunch here. I recommend going with a group so you can order several menu items and share, but maybe get an extra order of egg rolls for yourself.... \n\nSeriously, they were that yummy.", "author": "Nikki W."}

Not that I don't like Chinese food, heck, I love the stuff, just about any Asian food will entice and satisfy me. But I went a tad overboard during the last, ohh, 8 months, so I've been on sabbatical.\n\nFor my homie's birthday, we had a plethora of fun things to get into on Saturday night, all venues were across the street or next door to each other in the outskirts of the FiDi. The night started with dinner at Fang, which I thought most of the food was aright, but the rest of my party was not that enthused, and come to think of it, the service was pretty horrible considering how few parties were in the restaurant. The amount of attitude... I'll just stop there, as it seems that other people have accepted the poor service.\n\nThe ambiance had a lot of potential, but we were seated in the front at the long booth style table where a lamp glared into our eyes from the entranceway. Dim that shizz! Eveything else about the space was cool: dark wood, comfy seating, cool Samarai warrior gear as art, and near the restrooms was a floor to ceiling wood wine rack.\n\nFor drinks, since it was my pals birthday, we all got either shots and beers or others got cocktails. Everything took a long time, and one person in my party never got his cocktail. Not to mention we gave our drink orders to one waiter, another came back 10 minutes later and demanded we give our order again. Ok, guy, calm down on the aggression. \n\nOur order was taken by a waitress, who seemed to hate each of us individually, and possibly her job / life in general. Anyhow, we ordered several items starting off with two medium Hot and Sour soups w/ chicken ($8 each) to go around. A waiter came to serve it, pushing aside my friend (though there was room at the end of the table) spooning searing hot soup right past his face into bowls, no excuse me, no common courtesy.\n\nOk, that's enough b*tching, as I enjoyed most of the rest of the dishes, like the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken ($12), Fang's Crispy Honey Chili Shortrib ($18), and the Salted Pork Belly with Japanese Pumpkin ($16). Pork belly is always a favorite of mine, though it can be done wrong at places, the dish at Fang's was perfection.\n\nOverall, portions could have been bigger for the total price and service could use some major improvement. If you're immune to those things, knock yourself out at Fang.", "author": "Crystal C."}

The cuisine is somewhat-upscale Chinese cuisine. I've sampled probably half the menu over the last few years and my favorites include the Nanking Sesame Chicken and the soups and the fried onion cake. \n\nService tends to be about average for a Chinese restaurant, which is to say, moderately efficient and slightly distracted. I often eat by myself here and get seated at the bar, and 90% of the time, I have to ask them to wipe the counter. The kitchen works pretty fast though. I would recommend this place for lunch because of the speedy kitchen and because the prices are less expensive at lunch.", "author": "Jimmy H."}

I hardly write reviews but this experience forced me to write one . \n\nThe service was extremely slow. More importantly , the server was not nice and slapped the menus on the table. \n\nGetting to the main point , the chef/owner came and declared that he's going to put the order for the whole group and decide on the dishes . What's worse is that he didn't bother to ask dietary restrictions . I'm allergic to beef and the first appetizer that came first was beef . What made it worse was that the server didn't bother telling about  the dish . \n\nWe decided to place our individual orders following that .However , the server didn't bother listening to us . My bf had to literally walk up to the kitchen And call out the chef .Our individual orders were placed after that . \n\nIt took them 45 mins to bring the food after it was ordered . The food that came was extremely salty to say the least . And it took so much time to come over .\n\nWhat's interesting is that the other patrons have had the same complaints in the past and the owners have refused to address it . The owners claim this is one of the ways they take care of big groups aka fleecing people to make money . Do they realize that there might be vegetarian people at the table considering all their dishes were meat based . And they DID NOT even bother asking about it . \n\nI'm so so disappointed .

Great food this was not.\n\nWe ordered the grasshopper mojitos but they didn't arrive until 3/4 into the meal and they weren't drinkable.  It was as though the rum had been sitting in the bottle for years and needed a Bar Rescue and the pineapple was canned and had been sitting on the shelf since 1982!  After four people came to take our drink order, we couldn't find someone willing to take our food order. However, 15 minutes later, we ordered the potstickers, which were okay and at least edible.  But nothing to write home about.  I ordered the basil chicken, which was supposed to be chicken breast but it was not.  It was covered in oil and left an unpleasant taste on the tongue, not to mention a residue.  We also ordered the sesame chicken, without the sweet potato and that request seemed to piss off the owner. The sauce was watery and not flavorful.\n\nWe waited another ten minutes for the bill. We did wrap the food to go and figured we'd give it to someone hungry on the street. Three times we tried and failed. \"That's from Fang? Then no thanks.

For those of you considering dining here after a shopping trip, Fang is about a 10-15 minute walk from Union Square and right by Moscone Center.\n\nCame in on a Monday afternoon at about 2pm and there was no wait to get seated for a party of three. I kinda thought since this Chinese restaurant seemed more above a hole-in-the-wall kind of place that there would at least some kind of customer service, but nope. Don't expect that here. It wasn't terrible, but they literally just take your order, drop off the food, give you the bill. No checking on you or anything, but they weren't rude and were able to speak English.\n\nMy party and I shared the following items off the lunch menu:\n\nFangs Peking Buns (Duck): We ordered 2 orders, 8 pieces total. Tasty and would definitely recommend everyone to try, but ask for a side of the sauce to come with it. Without it, it's pretty dry but the sauce helps bring it back to life.\n\nHot & Sour Soup (Tofu): Probably the best quality tasting hot and sour soup I've tasted in my life. The flavors were very vibrant and loved the soft zucchinis tossed in. Great to share.\n\nHouse Made Egg Noodle (Chicken): Really good! The noodles were chewy and did not feel too greasy, but perfectly shared amongst 3 people (if you have a party of 3+, I would recommend two orders... it was small portions shared). You can really tell the noodles are fresh and house made. The flavoring tastes like chow mein.\n\nBraised Shortrib: Okay, by the time this order came out, we were all stuffed and we definitely could have gone without this. I thought this was packed with nice flavor, and with a crisp, but my sister didn't like how it wasn't moist or soft. This also comes with an order of white rice which I found necessary to balance out the flavor. For $9, I think this is something that could be of great value to be eaten by one person alone for a lunch meal. But again, also great to share, but we wish we didn't order this because we could barely finish it since we were so full!\n\nOverall, we split the bill and paid about $20 each. I was satisfied with my meal and what I had paid, and there's definitely more I would want to try on the menu. It seems there are a lot of \"healthier\" options (whatever that means in Chinese cuisine...) offered, and this Fang is definitely about to pull it off.\n\nBonus: They seem to play a lot of Justin Bieber here.", "author": "Cris-ann L."}

It's kinda hard to find but once you find foreign characters sticking out from the wall that's when you know that you've stepped into the right place.\nWe got here pretty early around 11-12 and it wasn't too packed. I could tell this place gets packed though easily by the food that they serve. We ordered 3 entrees but I can't remember what they're called. It's either the crispy honey steak, marinated pork ribs, and some garlic chicken basil plate. Also we got some fried rice because we like to order with our eyes. I personally enjoyed the steak very much. The outside was delicately crispy and the inside was savory and chewy. They have a lot of red onions on their plate though. I like red onions but I felt maybe it was kinda overkill on that aspect. Or maybe it's because my friend kept putting red onions on my plate and I just kept eating lol.\nAnother thing, I remember that the server asked if we had any food allergies and that was very kind of him to ask. We didn't have any allergies to anything but it was the first time I had someone ask that at a restaurant. Pleasant surprise =)\nThe food is definitely amazing. It's prepped fresh and it's not like the mystery meat that you get from Chinese fast food places.\n\nAlso they play EDM here. So that was random but I enjoyed it. Since I hear that at work.

We kept asking staff members that would walk past us how we could order, and we were told that somebody would come over. We actually sat at a table in the corner of the restaurant for more than half an hour and were never waited on!

They brought out lots of large serving plates and we each helped ourselves and passed it around the table. It was exciting trying it this way because I got to try several dishes I wouldn't have ordered on their own that were quite good. I have no idea what the names of the dishes we tried were, but the service and food were both pretty good.\n\nI loved some cubes of steak that came with a bit of pepper on them, and I also loved some vegetable dish that looked like slices of green apple but totally wasn't, though no one in my group knew what vegetable it could be. I didn't care for the duck on steamed buns, but everything else we were served was pretty tasty. Definitely a good choice for lunch for a large group of not-picky eaters. We did have one person in our group who was eating gluten free, and the chef accommodated that by sending out some dishes that were gluten free and others that weren't.", "author": "Sarah V."}

When we all agreed to give him full trust, he took the menu off our hands and ordered us delicious food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-30", "description": "So, a quick thing about banquet style food. Not the buffet style where you line up and grab a plate. Instead, I'm talking about the format where you sit at a circular table, and get pummeled with the best food the kitchen can crank out in healthy scale. \n\nThere's usually one or more of the following:\n- A lazy suzan (lazy steve?)\n- Someone encouraging you to eat more\n- Some random animal part you didn't know could be cooked that way with those things still attached\n- Something completely unidentifiable that you can't stop eating (usually derived from pork or fish) \n- Something I try to eat with chopsticks that eventually defeats my dexterity and requires me to use an elbow or nose to lift it to my mouth. It's a form of juggling, I tell myself. \n\nFang nails that idea in many ways, while feeling upscale and disorientingly pleasant. It seriously took me ten minutes to focus on the menu because I kept getting distracted by the decor and the flower in my green tea, which eventually blossomed and shot to the top of my glass in a \"ooops now I'm drinking a terrarium\" sort of way. It made everything delicious, no accidental goldfish appeared. \n\nThe staff was attentive, and got our order down while my friend and I talked about things unrelated to food. It was the first time in a while that the app/salad service order was correct at a restaurant, so that made me happy. The Apple Cabbage salad was a lovely, balanced blend of apples, red and white cabbage, and the tofu I added fit perfectly. The dressing was a little vinegar-heavy, but still addictive. Portion size was just enough for two to enjoy, but my friend was not that salad oriented for lunch, and I was all about that cabbage and apple. The plate was emptied. \n\nThis is the one star off point: the order-to-salad timing was perfect. The salad to main course timing was maybe 5-10 minutes slower than one might expect. We ordered before the table next to us, and the seafood noodle pot and the brown rice with edamame, fish, and green onion were both decent serving sizes (the brown rice is a guaranteed split plate, the noodles could serve one but can work with two in a multi-dish situation) they somehow came out after everything was served to the table next to us. An entire fish appeared on the table next to us and our plates weren't out yet. That made me simultaneously impressed (the fish looked fantastic) and dismayed. \n\nI'll chalk that up to lunch rush, which is typical around the SoMa where we were, and the only thing possibly keeping Fang from getting overwhelmed is that people got distracted by the cheering coming from Gold Club and were lured in. \n\nOur dishes were perfect in many ways, presentation, just the right amount of hearty sauces, which for the style and presentation were perfect to me. If I want family serving style Chinese food, I want a touch of oil that sticks with me, a sense of fresh vinegar cutting through, as those are the things you come to expect if you stir fry anything regularly. Without it you're worried that they were breaking in a new wok in the back and it absorbed everything.\n\nThe presentation rode the line right between \"have a pile of food\" and \"this is so pretentious I can't eat it because I'm instagramming it and eating my phone instead\" and the flavors fit that bill too. Would I suggest this to someone on a diet? Depends on what kind of diet. My co-conspirator for this meal and I both avoid wheat (because reasons) and mainly just eat vegetarian protein and fish, so the menu supported that diet just fine. If you're super sensitive to just about anything, the menu's pretty flexible in certain areas, and those areas come with the healthiest portions. Can't speak to things like my mother's allergy to soybeans, or my dad's sensitivity to ... most of the things my mother can eat.\n\nIf you've ever eaten in a format banquet environment, you'll feel off kilter for a moment when you walk in, but the menu will bring you up to speed. The tab was solid too, we did two teas, one salad, and two main dishes, and came away with a split bill of $24 each before tip. I'd say for the volume and quality, it was worth it. \n\nI'm wondering what people were ordering if they were coming away with a tab so high they balked, but then again, it's amazing how certain items on menus can nail your tab into a higher tax bracket. I tend to keep my eyes open for the value items on the menu, or the unique experiences. If I know I'm pulling up on something distinctive, I either expect it to be jaw dropping if the price is double everything else on the menu, or I expect the portion size and quality to make me stop and ponder if I'm really giving the best value of my time to my friends because this restaurant just gave me a new definition for healthy. For my experiences in the city, Fang definitely did the latter, and it was great.", "author": "David C."}

I had specified I am vegetarian and I had asked for sizzling rice soup made vegetarian. When it was served, I tasted the soup (it was bland) and saw some piece of meat which I pointed out to the server. He called the manager and she just asked \"Oh you are vegetarian? I will take soup off the bill.\" That's it. No apologies that this shouldn't have happened in the first place. This is not a good attitude for people with dietary restrictions.  No matter how good the food is, I probably will not come back because of how this incident was treated. \nAs far as food is concerned; the house noodles were good. We had asked for sesame tofu and i asked for spicy if possible . I was told that sesame tofu is very sweet and they will prepare another tofu dish. We were served tofu curry which was not spicy and not we wanted. I tried to tell this to the server but they didn't listen and just got us hot sauce. The said hot sauce was awesome and the saving grace of the curry dish.

You might have heard or will hear the recommendation to \"Let Mr. Fang or his staff order for you.\" DO ITTTTT\n\nWe walked past this restaurant AT LEAST a million and a half times, on the way from The W Hotel to Yelp HQ. But when someone said go to Fang, it's super close to the hotel, I still had no idea where it was, until I Yelped it. I guess I didn't notice it, because it was right next to a ton of construction. If the construction was non-existent and that space was sucked up into a black hole, Fang would be TOUCHING The W Hotel.  Gosh, I don't pay very good attention, do I?\n\nSo, I love Chinese food. Having said that, I should also add that I almost always get chicken and broccoli no matter where I'm ordering from. I'm not THE most cultured person you've ever met.  However, I will try anything at least once (no, seriously, one time on a cruise I had escargot...).  \n\nAnyway we had been told that if Mr. Fang came over, to let him do whatever. So when a younger female waitress began helping our table of four, I perused the menu looking for something chickeny-and-broccoli-y to order. But WAIT!  She asked! She said, \"do you want us to put something together for you?\" \n\nYES PLEASE.\n\nShe asked if there was anything we could not eat or did not like.. I think someone said just nothing too spicy, and I agreed because I'm a super wuss. \n\nWe ended up getting 5-6 plates of awesomeness.. they each came out at different-but-perfect-times. I'm unfortunately not 100% sure what we ate, but it was all very good: there were some whitefish, spare ribs, asparagus, beef(?), chicken.. and something else that, after checking out my lunch-mate's notes, sounds like it may have been \"fried shrimppackets\" - Whatever this was.. was my favorite part.  (I've posted a photo collage as well.)\n\nWe finished the meal and were all full and satisfied - what's even better?  Split 4 ways, the bill was only about $22 per person. Really reasonable for the quality AND quantity of food you get.\n\nIf you've got the chance to go, do it.. it won't take a long time.. they'll bring dishes out as they're done being prepared, and you'll be so glad you stopped in.", "author": "Heidi P."}

When my group asked about Chinese food for lunch, I wasn't exactly thrilled.

However, Fang was fresh and surprisingly light for Chinese food. \n\nA gentleman came over and asked if we had eaten there before. When we informed him that it was our first visit he suggested he order for us. We're an adventurous bunch so said sure, with one request, that he bring us fresh items. \n\nThe first dish was salt and pepper mushrooms. Huge pieces of portabello mushrooms came out in a light broth and were so flavorful. Next was Fang's Peking buns filled with crispy beef. Ok, so maybe these weren't the 'lightest' item on the menu but they were crunchy, sweet and sour. Loved them. \n\nEntrees were just as wonderful. We shared a white fish, prawns, and chicken.

Three days into my work trip to San Francisco I was majorly fiending for the food of my people. Thank God, Gretchen H and (Honorary Asian) Mike B were feeling the same way and Fang was a hop, skip and a jump away from our hotel.\n\nThe most memorable part of our night was when our server (who I now know is Peter, the owner, from reading other Yelp reviews) stopped by our table to take our orders. He smiled ominously at us and said: \"No worries...I got you,\" and took our menus away.\n\nAt that point I was wondering if I was on a hidden camera show. What was happening?! Was he going to order us a grilled dodo with a phoenix tear dipping sauce? How much was this entire meal going to cost me? What about dietary restrictions? \n\nI needed a Xanax with all of the options that were being presented to me, but I should have trusted the business owner. Peter Fang knows his stuff.\n\nWe were presented each course, one right after another so it was a long, extended dinner (in a good way). He ended up treating us to a feast of:\n\n+ Braised Shot Ribs cut capaccio style - So tender and decadent!  \n+Five spice white fish which came out in a giant heated silver fish plate. Impressive presentation! \n+Honey walnut shrimp with fried apples - If you like sweets and fried things this is the dish for you! I prefer my food on the savory side but my dining partners died for this dish. \n\nTo quote The Lego Movie: \"Everything was awesome!!!!!\"\n\nAdditionally our table had ordered some appetizers to share: green onion pancake, soup dumplings and the peking duck buns. Out of these, the most memorable were the peking duck buns which were deep fried duck in a down comforter of sweet, fluffy bao and a smidge of hoison and green onion. \n\nOur total bill, plus cocktails? $115 which was pretty reasonable considering we were right in the middle of the Financial District.

It's almost like they read my mind: I want to sample multiple things, but I don't want to order them.\n\nA couple of co-workers had just sat down when they told me they were at Fang, and that they had a seat for me.

This was possibly the largest plate that came out.\n\nChicken - I'm not usually a fan of chicken but this was delicious! In a peanut sauce (?) the chunks of chicken were delicious. I loved the tiny pieces that had been sitting in the sauce the whole time. Dumped a few of those and some sauce into my white rice - amazing.\n\nFried Shrimpackets (?) - really good. I got the name off the menu, so not sure these were it, but it was 6 or so little round pockets filled with shrimp and fried. They were really good.\n\nI am sure I am forgetting something else?

At a time of day when they were not that busy--about 5:30pm in the afternoon--the service and food took a long time--also, I would say that the establishment is not really that clean-it has sort of a damp smell when you walk in--and the tables and furniture look pretty basic.  It was disappointing for asian food in San Francisco.  I would definitely not recommend this to other conference attendees, nor would I come back myself.  \n\nI thought the wonton soup was strange to say the least.

It was thinly sliced and extremely tender.\n\n-Speaking of tender, we had some melt-in-your-mouth-beef!\n\n-A fried shrimp and sauteed apple dish. I kid you not, this is probably one of the best Chinese dishes I have ever had. Apples and shrimp? Who would have thought this was a match made in heaven. They also offered up a more savory apple-based dish that was superb. \n\nThe service was top notch and we didn't have to wait at all thanks to Open Table!", "author": "Aaron B."}

I thought these yelpers had a rare experience but to my surprise it was quite common. My wife and I were looking through the menu as Chef Fang came to the table and asked if this was our first time. He introduced himself and then asked if we had any food restrictions/allergies. We politely answered no as he proceeded to take the menus from our hands and said to trust him. My advice... TRUST HIM! \n\nWe were a bit apprehensive at first because we didn't want to eat something we didn't like and then have to pay for it. And we certainly didn't want an outrageously high bill at the end and when it comes to food, I know what I want and how I want it cooked. I looked around the restaurant and saw him doing the same thing to every new costumer that came in! \n\nWe started with a snow pea and onion salad. It was delicious! I'm not usually one for a vegetable appetizer, but this dish was fantastic. Then they brought out two Chinese buns filled with duck, hoisin sauce and some pickled vegetables...also very delicious. I would recommend ordering it. Then came two entrees with a side of rice. The first was a shrimp with apples in a sauce that was by far the best Chinese food I have ever had, and I have had a lot! The second entree was a crusted short rib served over bok choi which we also ate with a side of rice. The whole meal was culinary perfection and the bill came out to about $70 which isn't bad for a high end restaurant. \n\nI would definitely go back and let Chef Fang order for me again if all his food is this good.

The server asked us if we had a reservation and then were seated immediately in a corner table. \n\nThe interior decor is very nice and very new age Chinese. There is an inside hallway that you pass on your way to the bathroom with walls totally lined with wine bottles. Pretty cool!\n\nThe menu was a lot to take in at first. I was really hungry so I just wanted to order everything. This place was very similar to PF Changs in regards to the type of food offered on the menu. \n\nBoyfriend and I ordered:\n\nShrimp dumplings - delicious. Majorly delicious. \n\nSizzling rice soup - OMG so gooood. This soup is pretty spicy so I loved it. It might be too spicy for people who aren't good with that stuff though. \n\nFried rice - amazing. No other words. \n\nLettuce wraps with scallops - this was my least favorite dish. The wraps were good but the filling consisted of crispy noodles. I am not a big fan of this texture in food. I ordered these because I thought they would be similar to PF Chang lettuce wraps but I was wrong.

After being used to Chef Chu's in Silicon Valley, one of the top Chinese restaurants in the country, I was a bit skeptical, but gave in to peer pressure to give it a try. \n\nWe were quickly seated at a table in the back, which was large and comfortable (we went pretty early so it was fairly empty). The decor was really nice, and that's about where it ended for me.\n\nAfter waiting quite some time for someone to take our order, Chef Fang appeared and we ordered steamed dumplings, salt and pepper mushrooms, onion cake, sesame chicken, vegetable lo mein, and a $6 side of sweet potato. The Chef, however, immediately pointed out that the sesame chicken also had sweet potato in it, so he would make something special for us instead of the $6 side dish. I wish I had read the other reviews on here, and been wary of what came next...\n\nThe food came out in a strange manner; some dishes came almost immediately while others took quite a bit longer. Everything was completely doused in something; be it a syrupy sweet sauce, heaping amounts of garlic, sloshes of oil, or a snow-melting amount of salt. I completely agree with the other 1-star reviews of the food. The waiter tossed the dishes onto the table in front of us instead of presenting it carefully and respectfully. I didn't eat much of anything because it was so full of thick sauce, breading, oil, or salt that I knew I would get sick later.\n\nFinally, the substitute for the side order arrived that Fang ordered for us - a heaping plate of honey apple shrimp, slathered in sauce. They forgot to bring out the sesame chicken too, and I had to remind the waiter of it - it took 30 minutes to bring our final dish out.\n\nWhen the check came, I saw that he honey shrimp was $20!!! So, instead of substituting another small side dish for $6, he gave us one of the most expensive entrees on the menu. Who does that?? I was totally floored by the whole experience, and I will never be back here. Like, ever.\n\nOf course, as I predicted, I was sick later that night and into the next day. \n\nADD: I just looked at their menu, and the honey shrimp is priced at $18, but on our bill they charged us $20...

We were in the middle of these two categories - Koreans who were craving for really good spicy food but not brave enough to try authentic Chinese dishes that might be new to us. \n\nWhen we were juggling between the two menus, the owner of this restaurant (we haven't had a chance to ask his name, but he was a 50+-year old man with some grey hair) approached to our table. \"Are you guys Koreans?\" \"Yeah, it's our first time to be here, and we are looking for really good spicy foods.\" Suddenly, he took the menus from us and said \"No worries, I will take care of your table.\" This situation was somewhat interesting, and we decided to lean on his recommendations for our dinner.\n\nIt was definitely more than our expectations. He served three main dishes for us - (i) marinated beef in soy & garlic sauce with slices of rice cakes (which was really similar to tteokbokki, a Korean dish) (ii) broth with spicy oil, seafood and noodles (similar to spicy seoleongtang) (iii) grilled giant fish with vegetables We were not even sure whether these main dishes are actually listed on Fang's dinner menu, but no matter what, our dinner was sooo good. We highly appreciated for his recommendation and consideration for us. \n\nOn that day, I was staying in SF one night as part of my business travel and picked this place for a weekday dinner with friends just because Fang was just across the hotel that I was staying. After the trip, I thanked to my admin for making a reservation at that hotel, which ultimately led us to Fang.

Fang serves the food in family style. Since Fang have long rectangular tables (my table had 13 people) without a lazy susan that allows us to rotate the dishes, we had to pass a large dish around the table so that we can serve ourselves. I did not like that. If they have long rectangular tables, then serve individual dishes vs eating in family style. If you want to keep family style, then use circular tables with lazy susans.\n- Food isn't that good, average at best.\n- The stairs going up to the private party floor is poorly or not lighted at all. That is dangerous! My eyes can't adjust from light to dark that quick!

They were like little soup-filled surprises. \n+ crispy honey steak: I wish I had ordered this as my main dish. I luckily had a bite. There's something about perfectly spiced sweet meat that makes me want more.\n+ cooling shrimp lettuce wraps: This was my main dish and included lettuce with a shrimp filling. I cleaned the plate. \n\nA meal at Fang left me happy for the rest of the day, and I hope a group of us gets to go back so we can fill the table with dishes once again, making our way through the rest of Fang's menu.", "author": "Emily H."}

However, despite that and some disorder/confused with waiting to be seated (the hosts/hostesses didn't have a system in place to keep track of who came into the restaurant first and were a bit confused), I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food.

I've had deep fried wonton, beef, meat balls, squash and a lot of other things I can't remember here, all of them are overly sweet. \n\nThe good thing about Fang is that they are very accommodating to large parties, and their special \"tell me what you don't like and I'll make the rest for you\" family style ordering saves a lot of time and energy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-11", "description": "It was my first time here today and ended up here post meeting at moscone. So let's see...where do I begin? \n\nMy co-worker told me that this place is owned by the same owner as House of Nan-King. I haven't been there in a while but I remember not being too fond of it because it was tight inside and hot. Plus that dude is mean from what I recall. It was good food though.\n\nSo I didn't know what to think of this place initially. I did know that after the meeting and all the walking this morning I was starving. So by the time we were headed here I was ready to chow. This place is adjacent to Moscone so it is really convenient if you have a meeting there or you end up there for some sort of show or function. \n\nIt is directly across from Thirsty Bear so if you are familiar with the area then you know what's next door. For some that might be a plus. For others that may be the breaking point. I can say if you came here to grub then you will enjoy. The building on the other side is under construction so it's easy to miss Fang.\n\nIf you drive in, I would just park at 5th and Mission and walk over. If you can, just avoid driving. Take a cab or a lyft car instead.\n\nOutside it's not much to awe about. When you get in they have an old world meets modern Chinese type motif. You walk right into the host station and it opens up to the main dining room. Apparently there are private rooms upstairs and I'm not too sure what is downstairs. I was told this place gets busy and sometimes reservations are tough. We were 15 minutes late for our reservation but they held out table. Yay!!!\n\nFrom the dining room is a view of the main kitchen. I like places like this. But rare for Chinese Restaurants. This isn't your normal mom and pop call ahead for take out Chinese joint. It's tricky. It just looks like a place where you should be paying more. But when I looked at the menu everything was ultra reasonable. It's not cheap because again it's not a mom and pop. But it is very reasonable. I read a few bad reviews and I swear they must have reviewed the wrong place.\n\nThe client we were with introduced us to the owner's daughter. I guess she frequents this spot. We then had the daughter order for us and told her one person in our party was a vegetarian. I thought this was scary for two reasons... 1) I was expecting not to like anything she ordered for us 2) if she is ordering for us how pricy is this going to be.\n\nWe had no clue what was going to be delivered to our table. Within a few minutes one waiter came with the first course. It was a mushroom appetizer with barley or what we dubbed as \"wheat berry\". First course was a score. It was reminiscent of the skewers at E&O. This tasted like beef, also like E&O but it was a portabella mushroom. But then I started thinking, crap we mentioned there was a vegetarian and we are only getting veggie dishes. \n\nThen second course came out and I was really thinking crap, we are only getting veggie dishes because the second plate was braised tofu with thin slices of sweet potato. Man, this was killer delicious. I have never had sweet potato at a Chinese restaurant before and this was yet another score. The the 3rd course came and this was a fish dish with spinach. This was delicate and yet tasty, simple, yet a hit. Wow, 3 for 3? It can't be?\n\nThe 4th plate came and it was spare ribs. I read this on the menu and wished and hoped we would get it. If you wish it in your head bad enough I guess it comes true. This was the honey spare rib. This, I must say was perfect. There were only 5 pieces so the vegetarian wasn't teased by a lone remaining rib on the plate but if there was a 6th piece I would have jumped at it. This was my fave fish of the day.\n\nNumber 5 was some sort of pea shoot or pea sprout salad. Threw me off to be served fifth but oh well. This too was a hit. It was also just at the right time because as tasty as it was, it was also a palate cleanser. Now we were 5 for 5. Then the last course came and it was chicken with bell pepper. This was the only dish that didn't jump at me and attack my taste buds but it was also good. Not great, but still darn good.\n\nWhen the final bill came I was in amazement. It came to an average of $20 per person. Come on now! That's insane for this area of the city to have this many great dishes and come out just a little above a century. Best part is this was a work lunch so it wasn't on my tab. Double yay!!!\n\nIn conclusion... I loved it. I will go back. I would like to take the wifey on a date here or some friends or the wifey and some friends. It's great food and a great experience. Heck, I might just let them order for us too.", "author": "Ryan C."}

Whereas most servers at other places are just brusque and stoic, here they actually roll their eyes at you, snap impatiently when you ask questions and make disgusted grunts, sighs and other noises for no apparent reason. Speaking to them in Chinese makes no difference. They have nothing but contempt for you.\n\nMy friend and I came here to take advantage of their happy hour menu, which looked great online. We needn't have bothered. They refused to honor their HH prices even though our orders were placed before 5:30pm. So we ended up paying full price for all but my friend's first cocktail (which she ordered about 10 min before I arrived). \n\nFor food, we got the Marinated Bok Choy appetizer and the Soup Dumplings. I don't know how you screw up something as simple as bok choy stir-fry, but the dish was greasy and cold. I can handle greasy Chinese food but this dish could have been the poster child for Crisco. The xiao long baos barely qualified, as they were made up of some weird-tasting filling that probably was once meat but was now its zombie cousin.

I looked at their menu on Yelp, read the highlights, saw that the sesame chicken was the most discussed dish at the restaurant and decided to order it. I ordered it online and eventually go pick it up. When I arrived at the establishment, the host at the front said that my food had been sitting out for a little bit and gotten cold, so he offered to have another one made. I did appreciate them doing this. Eventually my order came out, and I went back to my office to eat it. \n\nAt the office, as I was eating my sesame chicken, I noticed a few things that were a bit odd with it. The spicy vegetables (cabbage) that came with the meal definitely tasted like they'd been soaked in msg for a long period of time. It was a bit of an odd taste, but I still edible. It was the sesame chicken itself however that proved to be the most problematic. There were numerous burned particles and even bits of grit in the sauce that covered the chicken. Every bite of the chicken and the sweet potatoes seemed to have an odd grit and texture to them, and eventually I found both burned black particles and clear, sand-like grit, in my meal. Basically at this point it was no longer edible and I had to throw it out. \n\nAgain, I'm really disappointed that I had to write this review and really wish that I'd be able to share a pleasant experience.", "author": "Laurent C."}

In a city of overindulged, pampered people (feel free to ask a local about  their quinoa diet or which $800 juicer to buy), it's kind of refreshing. The staff here don't need to speak in soft, low tones or stroke your NoCal ego since the food speaks for itself.\n\nCase and point: Tu Lan, Shanghai Dumpling, House of Nanking and their sister restaurant, Fang. \n\nGranted, it is nice to be greeted and to order food within 10-15 minutes of sitting down, but  don't go here if you're in a hurry or are easily flustered by apathy. And it's probably not the *best* for groups over 4-5 people.\n\nThat being said, the food is pretty delicious. Their \"famous sesame chicken\" (their menu words, not mine) is served with a mouthwatering sauce and sweet potatoes, a sophisticated take on a very traditional (sometimes overdone) dish. And one of my dining companions got a salad that looked enviable... and I generally don't go for a salad when eating out!\n\nIt's true that even the worst Chinese food is still good... There's rice, salt, and sauce, right? This is coming from a regular Panda Express customer.

Incredible stuff.\n\nAs others mention, don't expect much in the way of service. At lunchtime, my main concern is getting in, getting fed and getting out. But one of my lunchmates had an allergy to soy and I don't think the servers really handled it well at all (even with a man in charge who came out to try and help, but seemed a bit disturbed or annoyed by the request). They prepared her a dish that he promised had no soy sauce, but when he served it to her, he announced that it was cooked in soy oil. Uhhhhh. Wha? OK. She couldn't eat it but didn't press the issue and left it there, almost a full plate. No one asked what was wrong. Also, the check was placed on the table before clearing away dishes or asking if we needed anything else.

This restaurant has probably one of the craziest, and most diverse ratings you can find in San Francisco. People who love it give it 4+ stars, people who complain and b*tch about service gives it a lower rating. What should I say? Well, first... you might not be as lucky as me. \n\nI share my experience today with a party of 10 people. We sat downstairs in a secluded room with our own party. There was literally no other table downstairs and we had our own server. I went with a party of crazy canto foodies who eat out most of their lives. These cats and dogs are all in the forties and praise this place like a gem. \n\nMr Fang, known by my groupie to be the Chef of \"No menu,\" chinese omakase style, serve what the chef thinks is best. We were served the following (to my memory): \n\n-Portobello Mushroom glazed with garlic\n-Fish Soup (hint of spiciness) \n-Diced Beef Cubes\n-Chicken Gua Bao (bun wraps)\n-Thin sliced pork belly w/ pumpkin\n-Lobster glazed with apple sauce\n-Some other this and that! \n\nHighlights? Definitely 3 things; the pork belly with pumpkin, fish soup, and lobster w/ apple. \n\nFish soup was right after the appetizer was bomb. I'm not too sure the top of fish that they used, but it was probably a cod of some kind. There was zero fishy (ocean) taste, but more of a flavorful sweetness + a hint of spicy oil on top. I wanted my refill, but the other parties (guest) were older so I had to pass up my chance! DAMN! \n\nThin sliced pork belly was awesome as well. 3 layers of fatty pork cut into paper thin slices. The pumpkin glazed gave it a nice after flavor which you dont' get in most dishes. \n\nLobster w/ Apple was another best. Tasted like Cashew Shrimp/Walnut Shrimp. Sweet and flavorful. Not enough lobster meat, but plenty of apples! I had apples after apples! \n\nSo what's the big fuss? We had the service we wanted. Mr Fang came to visit a couple dozen times to make sure food was good. The difference? Well maybe Mr Fang saw majority of the people to be Chinese and traditional, he knew it wasn't a table to pass up on service. He probably wanted to cater the \"traditional chinese\" rather than the Americanized fusion people. Now you can argue this is America and etc etc. But hell, I've had a good experience and I have nothing to complain about. \n\nMy only question was, how much was our bill? I didn't get to see the bill since there wasn't a menu and we didn't pay for the bill. The other problem is, how the hell would I order if I walked in myself? I'd probably be like, \"Let Mr Fang prep everything for us; surprise me!\"\n\nNOTE~ There's definitely 2 different menus. One menu in Chinese \"for the traditional people.\" Another menu for the \"American's (fried rice, egg rolls, etc)\". Then the \"No menu!

I was on my way to their other restaurant House of Nan King, which is an all time favorite when Mike said to give Fang a try. I'm happy to proclaim I am now a fan of Fang as well! \nPeter (the owner) saddled up to our table to wait on us. Upon hearing that we are fans of Nan King, he smiled and quickly grabbed the menus from us. How do you turn down being personally waited on by Peter the Great? Especially after he announced he \"would take care of us\". Such a nice man, obviously very proud of his restaurant, as he should be! \nThe dishes started arriving, perfectly timed. We sampled some fabu dishes including a duck bun, crispy shrimp with apple, mushroom fried rice and a sauteed fish and greens. Don't ask me what the names were as most of the items weren't on the menu and rang up as misc items. All i can say is if you are in the area DEFINITELY head to Fang or House of Nan King. You wont be disappointed! If you are lucky Peter may wait on you as well!", "author": "Elayne L."}

The food was good, although a few pieces of the potato were not done (crunchy) and the breading on the chicken was over cooked and REALLY crispy.

Fang is still open. \n\nFood was good, although it's more modern rather than \"traditional\" Chinese food. Went here with a group around lunchtime - was very loud and it was hard to hear people across the table. On the plus side, the fact that it's busy probably means it's good and popular. Service was okay. They were busy, so didn't see the server much - and she skipped me when she was taking drink orders, which was annoying. Portions are big. I had the sesame chicken which was yummy and comes with sweet potatoes, a combination which I hadn't seen before but which I liked. There was also soup (I'm not sure what kind), though I didn't like it much.

For my Mom's 60th Birthday, we decided to take her to SF for the  weekend. We didn't know where to go for her special night, specially with 7 kids, and 7 adults, we knew we had to plan this one very well. I found Fang on Open-table and called to make reservations. I was nervous at first, because the food portions seemed small but we decided to go with it.. We were seated downstairs, in an very private, large table that fit all of us perfectly. As we were going through the menus, the waiter said his boss would come and help us take our order. Again, we were nervous at the pricey dishes, because some only had 4 pcs in, so we thought TRIPLE orders were gonna be a must. It was THEN, the big boss, Mr. Fang came down and said to \"Not to worry, put down the menu and I will take care of everything.\" Were so impressed, and sure enough, we did what he said. We trusted him to make us some great dishes, family style,kid friendly and pleasing to the adults as well. He sure did as he promised. Our only next concern was the price! ...well lets worry about that later..\n\nWe couldn't wait to see what surprise dish was coming out next- it was actually so fun to guess, but every time From at-least 8- different entrees including appetizers- Duck buns, Spicy Dumpling Soup, Shrimp with Apples, Sesame Chicken, Noodles,2 different types of seasoned fish - both were tasty - Pork Spare ribs was amazingly crunchy and meat fell off the bone-- all  portions were large, each dish was so flavorful so fresh, and filling. Nothing was greasy, too heavy, or salty, or sweet. Flavors were light, and well portioned.  We all left so happy, and most of all my mom was pleasantly happy as well. Fang was able to help finish off our evening with a light dessert and candle for us to sing to her. \n\nAnd finally, as we were expecting to pay a large bill for all the fancy dishes, it turned out the bill was under less than what we would ever pay for a high end restaurant that exceeded our expectations, we were all thrilled and felt the restaurant did their best to help plan and make all of us feel AT HOME for such a special occasion. I would highly recommend Fang, and would definitely go back!! We couldn't thank Mr. Fang enough, by the looks of our stuffed faces, he knew we were all so happy.", "author": "Vanny L."}

Mind you I am Chinese and my fiance's family is white and we are both used to gourmet cuisine as we are Bay Area foodies. Our first time here was on Aug 3, 2016.\n\nI can't rave enough about the food and the service we received that night from Mr. Fang and his service team.  Mr. Fang came to introduce himself once everyone was seated.  Once he learned that we were getting married, he grab our menus and in an no nonsense way, told us, don't worry, he will take care of us.  We simply ordered our drinks and what followed was a parade of gourmet Chinese food that was so unique and tasty that we had to ask Mr. Fang what region of China does he classify his cooking because we couldn't place it. He spoke Cantonese with us but it didn't taste Cantonese.  He said he was from Shanghai but it didn't taste like that either.  He told us its from his own creation.\n\nAll I can tell you is my sister and I were SO impressed with the tastiness and the authenticity of the Chinese dishes...from the milky soup with 2 different types of noodles to the beef cubes with crispy boy choy.  Each were original with unique flavoring unlike anything we had before. My fiance's family and friends were equally impressed even though they are novice to Chinese food.  The whole experience of Mr. Fang taking care of the menu and the excitement with anticipation of what is coming up next added to the whole experience of one memorable night.\n\nWe will definitely be back.

They were very flavorful, and held a good quantity of shrimp. The cilantro and scallion sprinkled on top really brought out the freshness of the dish.

They came back with $3.95 x 2 flower teas!  Normally tea is free or at most $1 per person at Chinese restaurants.\n\nAt least the rice was reasonable, $1 per bowl.\n\nToo bad.

I would rate this place 5 stars if not for the service. The hostess and some of the wait staff seem to be disinterested or distracted. The first time I was there I placed my order before anyone else seated in the same area but I got my food last, after one reminder. The second time I was there the hostess walked up and I wasn't even sure she was a hostess because she wasn't smiling or seem like she was ready to welcome a customer.

The food here is fine, but the service is so incredibly awful, it's borderline comical.\n\nWe made a reservation for 2 at 9pm. When we arrived and told the hostess we had a reservation, she just pointed to a table by the bar and we just had to guess which one she was pointing to - I imagine the job of the hostess is to actually seat the guests they are hosting. After 10 minutes of sitting at our table, someone came by to give us a menu, we ordered, and got our food pretty quick (probably the only redeeming factor of the night). Sadly, the sesame chicken wasn't all that great and neither was the lo mein. Average, at best.\n\nMy incredible disappointment came when only TEN MINUTES into eating, the check was placed on our table. I flagged the waitress and said, \"we just got our food and are still interested in dessert and another drink\" She said the kitchen is closing in 20 minutes so we would need to decide on dessert. Hm. Ok. Kind of annoying, but that's fine. The waitress never returned to take our dessert order. In fact, not a single waitress came to check on us and whether we were enjoying the meal or if we needed anything else.\n\nOverall, we were rushed through dinner and made to feel uncomfortable by the waitresses, who were attempting to close up for the night and made it clear that we weren't welcomed (e.g. stacking chairs on top of tables, turning on the house lights, not returning for our dessert order). \n\nWhen I finally confronted the waitress about our poor dining experience, she didn't offer an apology nor made any gesture to rectify the situation. She simply just stood there, confused, and then left. We ended up not finishing our meal because of our discomfort and when we weren't offered to go boxes (I'm sorry, is that not Running a Restaurant 101?!?), we quickly rushed out.", "author": "Roshni N."}

We sat in the down stairs dinning area, I thought the ambiance was quite nice. There were a lot of Chinese art and antiques on the wall. There were 10 of us and Mr. Fang himself was there to great us and to suggest our order. I thought that was really cool. He suggest that we get the family style I forget how many courses. I thought the food was amazing and the presentation was as well. The dish that stood out to me the most was the white fish meat. It was so juicy. flavorful, and melted in your mouth. I also had the pineapple mojito, that was also good, the pineapples themselves were very bitter though, I don't know if they were meant to be eaten or not. anyways. \n\nWe had to get additional orders to feed all ten people, but the our waitress did a great job of that. I felt really welcome, but it started getting late and the place was closing down. The employees started coming down and preparing to leave while we were still there. Then they all sat there a few tables behind us just talking and looking. I started feeling kind of offended by that. We started to feel like we were getting rushed or getting kicked out. and by the time we left everyone didn't seem as friendly as in the beginning. I too work in the service industry and a luxury one at that. I don't know where Fangs want to place themselve, but I viewed that as bad service. It was definitely not consistent. I understand that it was late and everyone wants to go home. but for the amount of people and what we paid I was expecting to be blown away by the service. \n\nI would come here again, but not in a big group, which is a shame because I really enjoyed the family style courses.

And the food sucked compared to the first time i was there. All dishes cooked in the same sauce.  They got 2 of our orders wrong.  When my colleague called the server over, he made eye contact, said \"yes\" and then walked right by him and started working at the counter.  completely ignored him.  We had to ask him to come back to point out that his order was wrong. \n\nFor me, I ordered crispy egg noodles with the chicken.  Never got it!  they put a plate infront of me with a serving of rice, some chicken over crispy rice noodles.  When I told them that that's not what i ordered, the server points to the noodles and says \"see, that's crispy\"!  WTF!  not what I ordered.  Another server brings the dish back and says that his boss made that for me and i could have that while he makes me what I ordered.  By this time, everyone is half way done with their plates and we have to head back to the office.  I had the plate they gave me.  They didn't charge for it.  Food was terrible.  The noodles were stale....rock hard. everyone's meal at the table had the same sauce. \n\nI loved this place the first time i went.  Will not ever return here again.  i felt we were treated badly.  i don't want to pull the race card, buy my colleague and I are both Indian.  Maybe they thought we wouldn't know any different.

We decided to give it a try as we were feeling a bit adventurous. We let them know that we liked sweet and spicy and could eat any type of meat. With this info, they let us know that they would bring out 3 entrees and an appetizer.\n\nFor our appetizer, they brought out a meatball dish that was pretty good. It was not the best dish I've ever tasted but had good flavors and was easy to split between the three of us.\n\nFor our entrees they brought out a grilled pork and onions bun which was actually my least favorite dish that they brought out. Still tasty but onions weren't as carmelized as I would have liked.\n\nWe also had a crispy beef dish that I really enjoyed as it had a great texture to go along with a sweet but spicy flavor profile.\n\nAs our starch they brought out a fried rice which was really good as well. Not too heavy and loaded with chicken and vegetables. It was probably my friends's favorite part of the meal.\n\nOverall, we thought that the concept of this restaurant is cool because they basically just pick what food you should eat based on your preferences. This is a really good idea if you have a group of over 5 people and you can't decide what everyone should split. Just make sure you voice your preferences or you might be left with something you aren't so fond of.\n\nFinally, even with all that food, I think it came out to less than $20 per person which is extremely reasonable in SF, so it is a good value as well.", "author": "Ryan R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-11", "description": "Fang, you took a bite out of my heart. \n\nI rarely eat Chinese, and it's even more rare to find me sitting in a Chinese restaurant since I have such a to-go mentality with Chinese food. Enter Fang **stubby teeth bared**...\n\nThe first time we ate here, there must've been at least 16 of us and we sat downstairs in a room that made me feel just a baby bit claustrophobic but also very exclusive and cool. I focused heavily on the exclusive and cool part. When the waitress came to take our order, I think she was not entirely pleased that we all wanted to order our own dishes and almost all of us ordered something different. She warned us that it might take a while. Ten minutes later we were being served our apps and steaming lunch plates. If 10 minutes means it'll take a while, then a while it should take!\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my hefty plate of Fang's Crispy Honey Steak with marinated bok choy. I spiced it up a little with their home spicy sauce that we probably polished off 3 or so bowls of this secret sauce. The crunchy freshness of the bok choy paired perfectly with the bite sizes of crispy only slightly sweet honey steak. I nearly licked my plate. \n\nSecond trip to San Fran. Fang ended up being a quick back-up plan with room for our 5 top in the main dining room near the window, exclusive but still able to people/cook watch! Might I suggest the Grasshopper Mojito with crushed pineapple, mint, lime juice, Ron Castillo Rum, splash of pineapple vodka, and soda. Incredibly refreshing.\n\nAs you can see in the past couple of reviews, this occasion our table wasn't totally sold on what we wanted to order, and Mr. Fang could sense our distress so he took our menus and began the onslaught of deliciousness.  \n\nWe did know that we wanted Hot & Sour soup and an order of the Fang's Crispy Honey Chicken and said this in the beginning when he confiscated our menus. I think though it's either the \"Fang\" way or the menu-way, not both. We weren't crazy adamant about those menu items, so if you ABSOLUTELY want to put in an order and still go Fang way, stress that to the server. \n\nAaron B. was with me so you can take a lot of what we got from his review, but I could've eaten a DOZEN of Fang's Beef Peking Buns...THEY'RE SO FLUFFY! I did get  a soup, but wasn't sure if it was a Hot & Sour because it wasn't that spicy hot but was still really good on this rainy night. What I believe to be the dish titled Salt & Pepper Mushrooms needs to have it's titled changed to \"Saut\u00e9ed Deliciousness That'll Melt In Your Mouth Mushrooms.\" If I ever had to go vegan, this would be my faux-meaty dish of choice. Living in New Orleans, I'm spoiled by the amount of fish I get to eat, so though presented beautifully, so the fish dish wasn't my favorite. We had other various dishes but at that point I think the food coma was setting in. My only gripe was that Chinese food makes me hella' thirsty, and due to the conveyor belt of food coming and going from our table, our waitress didn't bring us water till we received the check despite multiple requests. \n\nI would totally go the \"Fang Feeds You\" route if you can with a big group without food allergies or very specific tastes because we were able to try such a wide range of what Fang has to offer at $50/person and that includes tip already. \n\nI will absolutely be back to Fangs, ask for a pitcher of water, and the \"Fang-Feeds-You\" way next time I'm in San Fran!", "author": "Morgan F."}

We were glad we had a bigger group because we got to taste a huge variety of inventive and beautifully prepared dishes. Every dish has something unique about it - it was obvious extra care and thought was put into the flavor combinations and preparation. We had a cold appetizer of garlicky pea pods, a portobello mushroom dish, potstickers, a beef dish, chicken buns with the perfect combo of textures, steamed fish, honey prawns with apples. Even though we were stuffed, we decided to try one more dish. Even though we weren't sure what we wanted, the server and chef were - they prepared green beans with little crispy tender potato cubes. And then when we couldn't eat another bite, they brought out a crispy chicken dish with thin slices of Chinese sweet potatoes \"on the house.\" We somehow managed to eat another bite! I don't know the official names of anything because we didn't look at a menu - we just trusted - which I encourage you to do as well. The flower tea was served in big glass mugs and was like a beautiful garden blooming right in front of you. I don't know the cost of anything, but our total cost was $33/person with tip.

Everyone that worked there was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. Even after I left, I felt anxious and on edge all day from being in this place. I don't know if they're short staffed or what, but it even took ~15 mins for someone to come over to our tables to give us menus or anything after we sat down, and even then we had to flag someone down. After we ate, it took another ~15 mins to get our check (after the waitress cleared our table in such a rush that food was spilled), which is strange for a place that is so hectic and seems so eager to turn tables...\n\nThe food was actually great (we shared the Fried Potstickers and I had the Salt & Pepper Shrimp and Mushroom).

It's not a regular Chinese restaurant, which might throw you off if that's what you were expecting based on the name. Rather, it's Chinese food fusion, modified in such an artistic way that it actually blows your mind. It's the opposite of bastardization. If Panda Express is 1/5, P.F. Chang's is 3/5, and authentic Chinese food is 4/5, Fang is 4.5/5. \n\nIn fact don't even come here if your goal is to eat familiar authentic Chinese food. It is a new type of food that is artistic and unique. The portion size is neither small nor immense, but this restaurant is clearly focusing on art instead of calories per dollar, and they are effective at what they do.

Everyone who works there is Chinese, but I don't think there was a single Asian table on the first floor of the restaurant?  we had a big group, so they brought us down to a semi private area downstairs. \n\nThe menu has no Chinese characters on it, but they have the standard stuff and some more unique dishes. It's actually a smaller menu than I expected.\n\n- Pork confit egg rolls: lots of pork goodness, probably one of my favorite things of the night\n- Duck and beef buns (like the Peking duck buns but already stuffed for you)\n- House fried rice: could have used more salt, better with house chili sauce\n- Green beans: pretty greasy, but good flavor\n- Snow pea shoots: tender\n- Eggplant, mushroom, and fried tofu: also very greasy (as most eggplant dishes are), good flavor with the black bean sauce\n- Apple prawns: their take on walnut prawns, less sweet and less mayo, which I liked\n- Sesame chicken with sweet potato: I think I preferred the sweet potato to the chicken (standard fried sesame chicken)\n- Pork belly with pumpkin: mostly pumpkin, but since it was cooked in pork fat, it was pretty good\n- Short rib: fried cubes with bok choy.. I don't think most of us realized we were eating short rib?\n\nAll the dishes were pretty greasy and heavy, and everything had MSG.  We asked them to do things without MSG, but all the sauces already had them, so they just said they wouldn't add any extra MSG. I didn't end up super thirsty/sleepy, which is my usual post MSG reaction, but still - I thought MSG would be out of style in SF by now. \n\nWe did everything family style, and they served things in giant dishes, which were a little hard to transfer down a long table (no big round table with a lazy susan).\n\nThey do have a full bar, but all the cocktails are very sweet (maybe you're better off with Tsing Tao).  To their credit, prices were pretty reasonable ($33 per person including tax/tip and a drink).", "author": "Marilyn T."}

A little pricey for what it is, but that's the area I suppose - $34/head after tip, though we did get quite a bit of food (2 entrees, a small salad, and 2 small vegetable dishes). Seemed a little more on the trendy/modern side rather than traditional fare, but that's okay. Service was pretty good up until the point we got our last dish, at which it pretty much stopped. We were getting our carafe of water for the table replaced extremely quickly prior to that, and very little after that. They were much busier at that point though too.\n\nWe got:\n- 8 treasure salad - tasty salad with a nice variety of veggies, and a really fantastic dressing. pretty decent size for it being a small too\n- pea shoots - definitely the low point of the meal, but not bad. would not get it again. relatively small compared to the other 'small' dishes. not terribly remarkable or flavorful.\n- eggplant with garlic sauce - I'm an eggplant fanatic, and get it a lot of places, and this was probably my favorite Chinese eggplant I've had, wow. perfectly done, well-seasoned, oh wow. I would return just for this practically. also a very good size for it being a small. \n- szechuan prawns - delicious, and the shrimp was absolutely perfectly cooked. very often overdone, but quickly stir-frying in the wok seems to have done it perfectly. served with some cucumber which was alright. not that big for the price ($15), maybe 10 shrimp or so. was hoping it'd be spicy, with it being \"szechuan\", but no luck.\n- crispy shortrib - I'm not usually that much for beef, but damn this was incredible. shocked on my first bite. absolutely melts in your mouth, with a lightly crispy outside, and incredibly tender inside, very flavorful, a touch sweet. fantastic. served with (baby?) bok choy. would strongly consider getting this again.", "author": "Kris K."}

We've been craving Chinese food for a while so we decided to give Fang a try. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor: \n\nThe restaurant is pretty nice.When you walk into the restaurant you will notice stairs leading up. I'm assuming this was for private dining or large groups. I also saw stairs leading down when I went to use the restroom. I'm not sure what the downstairs consisted of. I like the color contrast inside of the restaurant. There were plenty of tables to sit at. There were these big light fixtures in the shape of a circle that were hanging from the ceiling.The light color that the fixture gave off was kind of red/orange/pink. I thought these big colorful light fixtures heightened the visual element of the restaurant. There was a huge samurai uniform hanging on the wall which looked pretty cool. There's an open kitchen where you can actually see the two female chefs cooking. Fang has a pretty decent sized bar. Fang has a lot of authentic yet modern decor spread out through the restaurant. \n\nFood: \n\nWe ordered the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken (crispy chicken, sweet potatoes, choy gwau), Mongolian Beef Tower (scallions, onions, chili, baby corn, crispy rice noodle), House Chow Mein (soy sauce, garlic, seasonal veggies, onions) and a large bowl of white rice. The Sesame Chicken was delicious! The crispy batter tasted really good and the chicken was tender. This dish was loaded with tons of flavor. I wish the sweet potatoes were cooked a little longer. They weren't hard but they weren't soft. They tasted okay. The dish would of been much better if the sweet potatoes were soft. The Mongolian Beef Tower was excellent! There was a generous amount of beef. The beef was very flavorful and tender with minimal fat. I actually didn't see or taste any fat. There was a lot of garlic which even added more flavor to the dish. The House Chow Mein was very good. This chow mein was different compared to other chow mein I've eaten at various Chinese restaurants. But it was different in a good way. The soy sauce and garlic added a strong tasty flavor to the chow mein. There were plenty of saute onions. The onions were really good and cooked perfectly. The white rice was fresh and it tasted good especially when you mix in the Mongolian Beef and Sesame Chicken. My girlfriend loved every dish! She definitely wants to come back and try different dishes! \n\nService: \n\nOur waiter was really nice. The first thing he asked us was if we have any food allergies. I told him I'm allergic to shellfish. I was very pleased and impressed that he took the time to find out if we had any food allergies. I think it's very important to ask a question like that especially when cross contamination of various foods is highly likely in a Chinese restaurant. He put in our orders right away. Our food came out really quick. I never had to ask for a refill or more water. He brought us the bill right after we were done eating. He was very efficient. \n\nOverall: \n\nI really liked Fang. Every dish was really good. I felt very clean and light after I ate a ton of food. Sometimes Chinese food makes me feel very heavy and bloated. I didn't feel that way at all after eating at Fang. The dishes seemed very authentic and were loaded with strong tasty flavors. If you want some really good Chinese food that is easy on the wallet and delicious, hit up Fang.", "author": "David R."}

It's got a subtle sweet taste, with the fish cooked perfectly. You can taste the various seasoning that adds a layer to your taste buds.\n\nBeef buns - I asked the waitress on the phone whether duck was more popular (which is raved by many of the Yelp reviews) or other meat.  She said there is no doubt beef is more popular.  While it's fairly expensive (+$12), they came in 4 large ones, plenty for 4 people to share (though I'd eat at least 2 myself).  \n\nOverall Fang's prices are high, though if you don't mind paying tourist-area prices for great Chinese food, Fang is a good pick that's near by the convention (moscone) center.", "author": "Sam L."}

Two problems here - 1. he ordered shrimp dumplings for use, which two members of our group can't eat. 2.

For a group that large they have a prix fixe menu, which worked out fine since it divyed up to approximately $20 per person, more if you order drinks and tips. \n\nFood was good, six courses (two plates each) were passed around on either side of the table. We were downstairs in the back, so it was private. I was surprised there was enough for everyone to eat their fill. \n\nIt's definitely a modern-Chinese cuisine. Though the plates were slightly on the small side. I've been to large, legitimate Chinese banquets, and these places usually don't skimp. But the food here at Fang was good, clean, and I didn't get any hint of MSG. Which is rare in Chinese restaurants.\n\nThe drinks were good. I had some kind of Pear Citron Tea Martini thing. It was sweet, with just a hint of alcohol right at the end. Seriously I could drink three of those, but it would probaby knock me out. A few others had the blooming teas, which came in a huge glass mug with the tea blossom at the bottom. Very pretty. \n\nOverall it was a good experience.

The food is okay if not completely authentic. Look elsewhere if you want traditional Chinese dishes, Fang offers more of a twist from traditional plates with a modern kick.\n\n7 of our party of 9 arrived ahead of the reservation at 8:15 pm but the table was not ready. When I arrived, I was shocked that the hostess, who was busy dealing with walk-in diners, didn't even know about our party. I had the feeling that she was reluctant to seat us until everyone in the party arrived.\n\nService was very slow. We were finally seated in a private area in the basement. It's like a conference room with a glass partition so we had an insulation from the din of the rest of the restaurant.\n\nWaitress set two big glass jars of water with no glasses. (How are we supposed to drink it?) Had to ask 3 or 4 times for they to bring water glasses. After two requests, they finally brought the champagne glasses but they only had 8. Another server had to go frantically search for 1 more.\n\nIt was agreed upon that we will order family style. But no menus were distributed and allegedly, Mr Fang, the owner, showed up and asked if anyone had food allergy of any kind. (I deemed it irrelevant to disclose my gluten-free status.) So he ordered for us??? WTF?\n\n-Wonton soup:  wonton is decent but the soup is loaded with MSG\n-Peking duck in bun:  a big chunk of duck instead of thin slice of duck with the crispy skin, and it doesn't taste like duck at all.\n-Sesame chicken with sweet potatoes:  this is actually decent, except the gravy is a bit thick. I don't think you can go wrong with this \"signature\" dish.\n- Prawns with fried apples:  a welcoming variation from the honey glazed prawns with candied walnut. \n- Five spice whitefish:  Fish is not fresh. \n- BBQ ribs with pineapple and crispy rice sticks. My favorite dish of the meal.\n\nThey charged $10 corkage per bottle. Reasonable. Without corkage it came to $35 per person and that is not cheap for Chinese food.

Brown sauce, loud tourists, brown sauce, rude waiters ....did I mention the brown sauce? Sauce just shouldn't be the shade of cow dung, I don't think. \n\nBack from a Yelping break (...I was out of the country so sue me!), I tried to keep an open mind about their new sister restaurant, a FiDi-focused place called, rather unappetizingly, Fang. I was hoping that the waiters would be dressed like Dracula and the Wolf Man but no. They went the more predictable route for this neighborhood, a trendy look heavy on the dark wood and orange lighting. I just kind of felt like I was at a Hong Kong franchise of Lyon's. \n\nThe analogy is not that far off. The prices are pretty reasonable by FiDi standards, and the portions are pretty hefty. It's as if you mixed Max's Diner with Yank Sing in a blender, I think Fang would be the result. For all that analysis, the food is just a couple of inches north of adequate. Jamie W. and I first tried the $5.95 Fried Onioncake which was covered in a sesame sauce that was - yes, you guessed it - brown (see photo). It was decent, but it does pale in comparison to the same concoction to be found at Henry's Hunan right on the next block. \n\nWe had better luck with the $13.95 Cooling Lettuce Wraps with chicken - but they don't give you enough lettuce to scoop up the filling (see photo). I also wish they would mince the poultry rather than dice it into chunks. I felt like I was eating a Hungry Man Special in a chuck wagon. The brown sauce came back in the $10.95 House Lo-mein with chicken, garlic, peashoots - but it didn't seem as overwhelming this time (see photo). The $6.95 Dry-Braised Green Beans were standard issue though nicely crisp (see photo). I welcome those anytime for dinner. \n\nI would likely come back to Fang for a business lunch since I'm just down the block, but it really doesn't feel like a dining destination to me despite the trendy touches. I'd likely go back to Henry's since I am a creature of habit. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...ok...Max's meets Yank Sing, and this is their bastard offspring \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...I hope you find orange lighting flattering to your skin tone \nSERVICE - 3 stars...a bit on the disorganized side, but they seem to come back for confirmation a lot \nTOTAL - 3 stars...I guess I'm just not that much of a Fang fan", "author": "Ed U."}

This is the new standard by which I will give out 5 stars. Here's what happened. Our party of 6 showed up on an evening when the place was crowded but, some way some how, we were seated within a couple of minutes. An older Asian gentlemen soon came to the table and asked if anyone had food allergies to which we responded \"No - just one of us is vegetarian\" to which he said \"I'm the chef\" and \"Do you trust me to take care of you?\". We were caught a little off guard but replied \"Sure\", and I suggest that you reply the same way. It was cold outside so he started us off with big mugs of hot tea with some sort of herbal flowers floating within. Then came delicious dishes to share: pea pods with red onions, green beans (both with unidentifiable seasoning or sauces that were lovely), chicken in a sort of dough \"sandwich\" (also very tasty and delicious - and one was a vegetarian option), some spicy noodles, a pork and bok choy dish, a shrimp in creamy sauce dish, and roasted yellow peppers.

We read the menu online and had some idea of what we wanted. When we arrived, the owner asked if we had been there before. When we said no, he told us to give him the menus and he'd take care of us. HOWEVER: If you're going to do this, give us some idea of what you're going to bring. \nJust as we decided to let him know we would instead prefer to order, the first dish arrived, and 5 more followed. \n\nMy favorite was the first, the snow pea \"salad\" (not sure why it's called a salad). Like all the dishes, it was heavy on spice like basil, ginger, pepper, maybe onion and sesame. \nFish, \"short rib\" (meat balls), mushroom, mysterious crunchy dish, and chicken dishes followed---all good, with the chicken and green peppers being the most ordinary.\n\nThe restaurant is tightly packed. Interior is elegant. Modern music plays, adding to the high noise level. \n\n6 dishes, 2 beers, 1 tea came to $159 before tip. \nI'm thinking they used the dinner menu, not the lunch menu, to calculate the tab at 2pm.\nPortions are not generous but were just fine. \n\nI get that this is an effort to update Americanized Chinese restaurant offerings, reducing starchy sauces and adding zestier pan-Asian flavor. They do that well. Unfortunately, I feel that their business model is based on pushing 7 dishes on diners then presenting the check. \n\nI'd return for lunch but only if I can order from the menu for some predictability of food and price. \nNext year, we'll go to Chinatown for dim sum as we had originally planned this year.", "author": "Carol S."}

When the owner found out that it was our 1st visit, he removed our menus and said that he would take care of us. The food just kept in coming, to the tune of about $350' including a bottle of wine.

Although most of the food was good, we couldn't figure out which dish was which. \nTonight I checked the menu on-line and decided to order on-line vs the phone. The menus didn't match so I called to see if I could get a couple of missing dishes, I couldn't understand the woman other than a response that my order wasn't ready (I hadn't ordered yet). I got to Fang about 5 minutes after it was scheduled to be done - I was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. 35 minutes later I was told that my vege dumplings were not available so I asked for my money back for that Item and they refused. I changed my order; 10 minutes later I was told THAT wasn't available either.  Finally, they agreed to give me my money back for the 1 item.  The food wasn't bad, given it was to go, but surely this is the last time I will visit Fang. I can't figure out why people rave about this place.

Several times, waiters or waitresses came up to our table wanting to take our order. I could appreciate they were attentive, but each time they just stood there, staring at us and literally not saying anything - let along something like \"are you ready to order?\" or maybe \"did you have any questions about the menu?\" It was truly odd. \n\nFinally we ordered a few appetizers and main dishes to share. We ordered the pork confit eggrolls, the fried onioncake with peanut sauce to start and the basil chicken and  Crispy Honey Steak w/marinated bok choy plus brown rice. A few minutes after we ordered they brought over the chicken dish. then a minute later came the beef dish. It took at least another 5-10 minutes to get our appetizers, several requests for the brown rice (both before and after them bringing us white rice) and several requests to get the peanut sauce for the onion cake. Everything was cold before we ate it - except the egg rolls. One of my pet peeves is when restaurants do things like bring different people's dishes at different times, or bringing appetizers after the main courses (?!) \n\nThe egg rolls were good but tiny - 6 1-inch pieces.  No sauce other than a little oil on the plate. The onioncake was ok, but the peanut sauce was more like a bit of peanut sauce mixed with something else - maybe rice vinegar? It was good, but I thought it was filled with scallions that were pretty much raw. I would have preferred it to be more cooked through, and true peanut sauce. They should call the sauce something else - like a peanut vinaigrette. The basil chicken was ok - but it was a bit dry and on the bland side. The beef was very tender and the best of the 4 dishes, but I have no idea what the bok choy was marinated in.

Some interesting mushroom dishes, dumplings, and some good meat dishes as well - from what I was told (I'm an herbivore!).\n\nAnyhow, the 2 stars were knocked off for slow and lackluster service along with unanswered questions. Ours was a multi-ethnic table of friends including Chinese, Indian, super Caucasian, and a few other fun ethnicities mixed in. Honestly, having our Chinese friend there made a world of difference.\n\nSo, food was good, service was okay, ambience is \"meh\".

I was with 3 friends and we all ordered drinks, 4 entrees, and an appetizer. The food came very quickly, within 15 minutes, which was the first red flag. Any Chinese food prepared that quickly was obviously not freshly cooked. The drinks took longer to come than the food.\n\nI took a bite as well and could instantly tell the item I was given was not the chicken dish I ordered. I am allergic to certain types of fish which we informed the waiter of. Rather than apologizing, he brought over the manager who started yelling at us because we indicated we thought the dish was fish. What kind of manager yells at 2 girls?! We hadn't even complained, simply asked if the plate served to us was fish. After speaking with 3 other employees trying to find someone to blame, he came back to us (dish still IN HAND) to again argue. At that point we could have cared less about the actual taste and just wanted something else to eat. Rather than offering a different entree, he brought our bill.\n\nNeedless to say, I will NEVER go back and have ensure the Concierge has taken it off of their list as well.

I guess nothing sticks out compared to the Gold Club with the huge bouncer standing in front.  Ha ha!\n\nThis restaurant is fun, but in my opinion, it's only mediocre.  The staff is super attentive and will serve you right away.  In fact, sometimes they come to your table TOO FAST!  I mean, once you sit down, you're already having someone asking you if you're ready to order.  Once you tell them you need a few minutes, they take a while to come back.\n\nWe ended up ordering the Pot Stickers and the Pork Dumplings as appetizers.

No matter...just thought I'd mention it. It was filled with mostly executives going out for a work lunch.\n\nThe inside was really cool - super modern and clean. The service, while quick and efficient, was very impersonal and felt rushed. I suppose that's usually the case at a Chinese restaurant. \n\nWe had hot and sour soup to start...it was really good! I loved the giant chunks of tofu and you could also opt to order it with chicken.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered really, really badly. I had one of the steamed dishes with braised beef over rice in a soy sauce. I really didn't like the flavor of the beef. It was sweeter than I had anticipated and tasted like a microwave dinner. \n\nMy husband ordered much better - he had the handmade egg noodles with shrimp. The noodles themselves were AWESOME and I'd recommend ordering this dish in particular.\n\nLunch was around $30-ish which wasn't too bad.

In a city with great restaurants on every corner this Chinese joint stood out to me due to its proximity to the W and it's relationship with Nanking, so I gave it shot on a busy Saturday evening.\n\nIt was busy and I had no reservation, but they seated me immediately at the bar.  It's clear that this pace caters more to an American palate than many of the places in Chinatown, so if you are looking for totally authentic you might look elsewhere.  If you are just looking for some really good Chinese with a more authentic flair than the usual tourist traps, then definitely come to Fang.\n\nI was in the mood for something really spicy, not their specialty, but my waiter was very helpful in picking something and tailoring it to my taste.  Usually when a restaurant says they can make anything spicy it just means they dump a ton of chili paste into the dish, and everything comes out tasting like chili paste. Not here, Fang was able to kick up my sesame chicken in some magical way that did not destroy the unique flavor but still gave me the heat I was looking for.\n\nThe sizzling rice soup was fantastic, with a delicately flavored broth, vegetables that had been carefully diced, and little hints of garlic that made this soup stand out ahead of the usual sizzling rice you get from the neighborhood takeout.\n\nIf you're in San Francisco and looking for a great Chinese meal with some authentic flavor, but you're not quite ready for chicken claws or water boiled fish, eat at Fang.  The service was good, the prices reasonable, and the decor was nice.  I didn't blow my mind, so no 5 stars, but I would return without hesitation.", "author": "Al B."}

Both times I was here with my work mates for lunch.  We were a larger group, first time 12+ second 7.  Its great that there's a restaurant that can cater for the mix group we have, vegetarians and meat-eaters,  and able to take bookings on the day too.  It's been many of our office's favorites. \n\nBeing the sister restaurant of the famous House of Nanking, you are advised to book ahead, even if you are a smaller table.  \n\nThe food here is great, so great.  Highlights are: \n\n- Basil Chicken\n- Fangs Peking Buns - These come in the Beef, duck, chicken or tofu variety \n- Steamed Dumplings - These come in the Pork, chicken or vegetables variety (veggie is really really good)\n\nHell, everything here is pretty good, just try one of each.  Though you are warned, take at least a pack of gum with you.  These dishes are all packed up with garlic and spices.  Some of these dishes, might also not specify they are spicy, but they are, so make sure you ask if they are.  If you are not a fan of garlic or spicy food, this place might not be for you.  \n\nThe service is very patchy.  There seems to be only 1 waitress that takes orders from all the tables, while there's 3-4 table runners who do their best to avoid eye contact so they don't have to talk with you.  Stand firm! Be like a true Chinese and wave them down, seems to be the only way to do it here. Plating times are also very off from each other.   Food will be bought to the table when they are ready, from the first dishes that arrives on the table, depending on what else was ordered, you could be waiting 15-20 mins for the other dishes to all get there. \n\ni do love the food, so I may come back.

Pretty busy for a Wednesday night, but we got seated quickly.\n\nSeems like right after a waiter took my drink order of water, he disappeared without asking my friend what drink he wants. Lucky for us, he came back and I stopped him before he could get away from us. But I think that's when getting the attention of a server started to go downhill.\n\nReviewing the menu and using the logic of going out to get family-style at Chinese restaurants (choose a protein and a veggie dish, in proportion of how many people are at the table), we decided on the Fragrant Sauteed Chicken and the regular portion of Eggplant in Chili Garlic Sauce. \n\nWe probably waited for 5 minutes, until I just decided to whip out my hole-in-the-wall-getting-the-server's-attention attitude, or to put it in simple term, I just raised my hand, like a schoolboy asking a question. Less than 10 seconds, a man, who was not in uniform came to our table, took down our order in Chinese and turned to the table next to us. I overheard their conversation and found out that man was the owner of the restaurant.\n\nFood came out quickly, and I was quite surprised, portion-wise. The chicken was pretty fragrant and crispy. To take what my friend said, he was quite surprised for a chicken that was sauteed to have a nice exterior texture. The vegetable that came along with the dish weren't too bad, just enough flavor to coat but not losing its natural flavor.\n\nHowever, the eggplant kind of disappointed me. I really thought that when the description said \"chili garlic sauce\" that both chili and garlic would be present. Not in this case. The eggplant was cooked to perfection, not too hard, not too soft, and not too grey, but the sauce kind of lacked it for me.\n\nThe loss of stars was because of customer service (my theory is the fact that we were sitting behind a pillar and behind the front counter). Especially with a place that seems a bit on the higher end of Chinese food, I would expect better customer service.", "author": "Tom T."}

I don't typically have an issue finding something at a restaurant to eat (even at a vegan restaurant), but this place was not accommodating in the least bit. In fact, I think they were quite insulted that I came to their restaurant in the first place. Upon explaining that I had an allergy to soy when I attempted to order a dish without soy sauce, the waitress kind of motioned just a minute and left. It took awhile, but a man then came to my table to suggest I don't order that particular dish and that they make me rice and vegetables. Perfect! But, when he brought the dish to me it had chicken in it and very few vegetables and he told me they cooked it in soybean oil. Huh? Either we had a huge communication breakdown somewhere, or this place was trying to send me to the hospital. Needless to say I gave up trying to order and didn't want to be a bummer with my group of dining partners, and I settled for water.

Thank god for Smartphones with Navigation else you are very likely to miss the place as the signage is not very distinct and you would least expect to find this place to be 10 steps from a Gentleman's club :) \n\nNow for the culinary experience : Mind you Mr. Fang ( who is known to make recommendations )himself took our order and gave us an approving nod ; I being the first timer here was supremely satisfied :)\n\nAppetizers :  Fried Onion Cake , Fangs Peking Buns ( Chicken) and Pork Dumplings. \nJust WOW. Though the appetizers were good; the Peking Buns were the clear winner here. I thought there is nothing better than the Chairman food truck buns and Fang proved me wrong. Pair these buns withe the House special Hot Sauce and it is a true party in your mouth. \n\nEntrees: Five Spice Whitefish,  Sesame Chicken , Fried Rice and House Noodles \nSesame Chicken with Sweet Potatoes is a winner. I guarantee you that you will come back again and again just for this dish. The Fish was a perfect accompaniment with the Noodles.  A special mention for the Fried Rice - though it has the standard ingredients Veggies, Egg, and Rice ; it was phenomenal.\n\nTeas: We sipped on Hot Teas (They have an amazing selection) - Blossoming Flower tea and Citron Honey tea. They are perfect to sip on with your food and act as palette cleansers as you are gorging on the variety of dishes you will be ordering while you are here. \n\nOne word of CAUTION : Do Not make the rookie mistake of trying to stage a Walk-In. DOES NOT work unless you are ok to wait 1+ hr at any given time of the evening. Even after having reservations our party had to wait for 15mins after arriving at the restaurant.\n\nFang for me is the best tasting Chinese food I have had in San Francisco !! This place truly deserves all the positive comments here on Yelp. For sure I will be making a visit sometime soon to try out the other items on their menu.", "author": "Abhishek R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-02-10", "description": "I went here yesterday hoping to get a good chinese new year eve dinner and my god, it is--by far-- the WORST, WORST restaurant (I can't even categorize this strictly under the worst chinese) I have ever been to.  I just recently became a Yelp member, and I am so glad I did so that I can share all the good and bad experiences with others.\n\nArrival: we arrived at the restaurant for our reservation last night and there were a bunch of people standing around waiting for a hostess/host.; we ended up waiting for roughly 15 minutes before another guest had to flag a waiter down.  The waiter asked us for the time of our reservation and yet, proceeded to seat another two guests prior to us (though their reservations were past ours).  \n\nOrdering/Food quality:  We ordered an iced green tea and sprite and it took us having to ask the waiter twice for the status on our drink orders before they brought over incorrect drinks.  AND this is AFTER we got our first food.  As I proceeded to give our waiter (the owner) the orders, he persuaded us to \"trust him\" to order for us.  He assured me that it will be traditional chinese new year food.  \n\nFirst food: mushroom with UNDERCOOKED oats and chunks of garlic (just checked on the menu for exact name of the dish but it is not even on their menu).   The waitress (apparently was in a crazy hurry) -- rushed to put the dish down without even explaining anything and didn't even bother apologizing when the spoon on the dish fell into the dish.  \n\nSecond food:  OVERCOOKED (LITERALLY BLACKENED ON THE SIDES) shredded pork eggrolls.  At that point, we were done with the food and restaurant.  Not only was the food NOT the custom chinese new year eve dinner you normally eat (fish, noodles), but the fact the owner SOMEHOW CONVINCED ME TO TRUST HIM THAT HE WOULD GET ME TRADITIONAL CHINESE NEW YEAR FOOD (AND I TOLD HIM I AM CHINESE) is RIDICULOUS!!!\n\nAsking for check: We decided we much rather go somewhere else with better service and quality --- gave them our credit card.  THEY, of course, had no idea where they left our credit card and it took about 10 minutes of us asking various waiters and them looking around in order to get our bill and credit card.  The bill, itself, was billed incorrectly.  They OVERCHARGED us for an additional beef plate dish that we never had.\n\nFYI -- it wasn't just us, the table next to us were also getting the same type of treatment -- people were just shocked by the service that night.\n\nOverall, as a first time diner to this restaurant, I have to say I WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER GO BACK TO THIS place.  House of Nanking is a good rest., I am not sure where they went wrong with this one.  I am surprised that other viewers had given this rest. a five-star review.  \n\nIF I COULD GIVE A NO STAR, I WOULD!", "author": "Amy J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-10-24", "description": "Last Thursday, I went to Fang with two friends and had what is quite possibly the worst dining experience I've had in all of the years that I've lived in the Bay Area. It's too bad, because some of these reviews make it seem like I could have had a great meal there! But, not only will I not go there, I've warned friends to avoid it also. IF YOU HAVE ANY FOOD ALLERGIES, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO.\n\nThe first person to come over to us was an older man that said hello then asked if there were any food allergies. One of my friends does have one, and so I smiled, said hello back, and then explained that there was one and we had a few dishes we wondered if we could have. He then proceeded to scold me, going on long enough that people on both sides of us were shifting uncomfortably in their seats. Some key things he said: \"don't order for everyone\", \"do you even know what allergies are? do you?\", \"if she is allergic then I pick what she gets\", \"why do you think you know what you can order\". and \"maybe you don't really know about allergies\". Keep in mind that I had BARELY spoken, was being friendly, and was berated before I could even order a drink. I wondered if there was a language barrier, or a cultural disconnect but the repetition of \"do you even know what allergies are? do you?\" sure made it seemed like he understood me. \n\nI completely stopped talking and waited until he walked away, which wasn't until he scolded me further and then walked away. We hadn't ordered drinks or food even though we were ready for both. Actually, I almost left because he had such a problem with me that I thought my friends would have a better dinner if I was gone. At that point, a younger man came over. We repeated that one of our friends had a food allergy, and we had a few dishes we wondered if we could get without the offending item. He said he had to ask the chef, and then took drink orders. My friends ordered drinks but I was still feeling on edge after being talked to so rudely so I skipped it for them.\n\nTHEN, the chef came over-- who was apparently the very rude man who had yelled at me. He told my friend with the allergies that he would make her a shrimp dish. (Never mind that at no point did he ask what she DID want to eat, only what her allergy was to. She actually was hoping for beef or pork but didn't want to make him angry, so it was just easier to agree with what he picked out). Then he asked what my other friend wanted. She named an appetizer and a main dish, and then the chef went on  a monologue about allergies and liabilities and how he was trying to be careful etc etc etc. I think maybe he was trying to play nice by then, but it came off as patronizing and weird. Our neighbors on both sides continued to shift awkwardly and whisper and stare.\n\nThe younger guy came over with drinks for my friends, and I ordered wine. My portion when it came was poured half as large as my friends; maybe coincidence, but the difference was striking, not slight. The dumplings were okay, and the ribs were decent, but my experience was horrible and I have no desire to go back. \n\nIn my experience, when eating out with friends that have allergies, you can suggest dishes you're interested in. A restaurant will either let you know that they can or can not accommodate. Never have I ever been so rudely spoken to and for that long- and never have I seen a chef insist that he would pick the dish someone can have without even asking if she was interested in anything else. I won't be going here again.", "author": "Nurse N."}

Today we had an errand in SF and decided to go by for lunch-the website said they were open all day thru the dinner service.  We arrived 1:45PM after driving across town and searching for the rare parking spot. We ended up parking at Moscone Center and walked a couple of blocks to give Fang a try. From the moment we walked in, the young man who came to seat us seemed really put out that we came in.  He dropped the menus on the table and left the dirty dishes on the table next to us throughout our meal. He came to table and just stood there without speaking and my husband asked if everything was ok. He response was, 'what, you want me to smile or something\" and continued to stand there silently .It was very awkward. We almost left then but instead placed our order with the unpleasant waiter.  We tried to be friendly and told the guy we came because of the Food Network show. We ordered 2 appetizers, steamed pork dumpling and shrimp dumplings which were the best of the 4 dishes we ordered but still no yremarkable., a shrimp & mushroom dish and the 'signature dish' of short ribs.  The food arrived in a timely manner, the cook had to get up from the employee lunch to cook it so we felt we were an inconvenience by just being there.  The food fell short of what we'd hoped , not a lot of flavor in the shrimp and mushroom dish, cold rice and the ribs dish was nothing you couldn't find in any neighborhood Chinese restaurant. We had a cocktail and a1 beer and our check was $96.00 (plus parking).

The menu was kind of sparse, but we realized as soon as our waiter told us that most people don't order from the menu, but instead allow the chef to make whatever they want. Sure, we were game, but I'd just gone vegan so that meant both of us were ordering vegan (it's served \"family-style\").\n\nThe first course, dumplings of some sort, were good not great. They had flavor, but were pretty oily. The meal would go downhill from here. There were about 3 or 4 courses that all seemed a bit bland, mushy and oily.\n\nPerhaps it was the vegetarian options.

What was distasteful to us was that after being told that there was a guy's hair in our fish curry, we were given a new one, but Mr. Fang did not apologized and allowed the waitress to handle the situation. We were not looking for a refund, but a simple customers service apology. \n\nAt the end the group agreed that we should have ordered from the menu, because we noticed that everyone else order the special \"not on the menu items\" and the portions were very small for these dishes.

But when the receipt came, it showed that dish was \"soy sauce fish\" and the price was $2 more than the one we ordered. We asked the waiter again and he still didn't acknowledge they had served us the wrong dish, but only waived the $2 difference. Another weird thing was we only ordered 1 bowl of rice, but they brought us a large bowl of it. When we reminded him we only needed a small bowl, he said large bowl and small bowl were priced same.

When the first of what we ordered finally arrived at the table, the sesame chicken, it was missing the sweet potatoes that were one of the main ingredients besides the chicken.  Our neighboring table ordered the same dish and their's clearly included them.  The person who delivered the dish asked us if we wanted some white rice.  We had ordered vegetarian brown rice with green beans and mushrooms.  He seemed to be unaware that it had been ordered.   Some  minutes later our second calamari dish arrived (seemed to be complete) and later the brown rice with edamame instead of the green beans.  All dishes were cold and all were very greasy to the point of almost being inedible, even the rice.  We picked through the food and then tried to get our check.  By the way, later we did spot our server on occasion on the other side of the room or behind the bar.  She never came  anywhere near our table nor  did anyone  in that capacity ... only those employed to deliver various items.  The food was terrible, the service was awful and basically we were just ignored.  We only complained to each other and now here as we never saw anyone to whom it would make sense to share our concerns and certainly we were never asked about our meal or thanked for coming into the restaurant.", "author": "Debra E."}

I have eaten at some of the cheapest grimiest Chinese restaurants around the world, as well as Michelin starred Chinese restaurants and this place certainly had the worst Chinese food I have tasted.  It wasn't so much that the food tasted actually bad, it was just that it tasted of nothing, it had no flavor.  \n\nPositives for the place were the service and decor. The waitress was nice (took the food back after we couldn't eat some of the dishes and removed it from the cheque) and the place looked reasonably well designed.\n\nMy advice is avoid at all costs. It's annoying as I was visiting San Fran from NY and have heard the Chinese food is really good, so it was a real shame to have ended up at this place, eating such mediocre tasting food.", "author": "Ian J."}

They had lunch specials going on, which was really a very good deal, about $9 a plate and it comes with a huge serving of rice. We took the waiter's dish suggestions: Five Spice Whitefish and the Sesame Chicken. This restaurant has great quality ingredients. \n\nI liked the Five Spice Whitefish more than the Sesame Chicken. I liked the greens it came with and the fish was super delicious and flavored nicely. I liked the sauce of the Sesame Chicken and the sweet potatoes, but I wanted the chicken to be crunchier. It's like it wasn't fried long enough to get the good crunch on the exterior, but the flavors were still great. This was more than enough food for two people and we took a sizable portion home as leftovers.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I did get a message from the chef saying next time I should request my sesame chicken extra crispy!

It was surprising to just find out the connection now because Fang has apparently been open for over five years. I guess I'm just not in the know.  \n\nI went for lunch the first time and had take-out.  I found out that Fang Restaurant is owned and run by the daughter of the Chef and owner of House of Nan King, and that she is a Chef in her own right.  I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered just like I have done every time at House of Nan-King which in Japanese is called \"omakase\", which basically means \"I'll leave it to you (the chef).\"I don't know what it's called in Chinese.  The owner/chef/manager, Kathy, asked me what I like and came up with a menu for me.  I really like the anticipation and mystery of tasting what an expert of the restaurant has prepared just for me. It's way better than just ordering off of the menu.  \n\nI loved it! I got a super tender and tasty beef over a bed of perfectly cooked bok choy, a wonderfully subtle white fish in a succulent sauce with \"Chinese spinach\" (That's what I call it anyway), and dumplings in a spicy reddish sauce.  It's kind of funny that I don't know any of the dish names, but that really doesn't matter to me. I enjoyed it all and would order it all again, but those dumplings man...I'm going specifically order those every time I go back! \n\nAs someone who gets take out a lot, I also loved the fact that they used quality take out containers that didn't leak.  That probably doesn't mean much to most people, but I dig stuff like that.  They're good enough to clean and reuse too. \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is intimate and inviting and features an open kitchen. It felt very comfortable.

The past 4 or 5 times I've gone here (over a 8 month period) the (once good) food and (always) lack-a-daisical service has gone from bad to worse. The final straw happened today when I bit into one of their duck buns to the taste of moldy lettuce. I opened the sandwich for closer look and saw an obvious piece of blotchy, slimy lettuce. I know better than to complain to the staff (who never respond to anything,) paid my bill and left knowing I won't be back.\n\nDo yourself a favor and avoid this place like the plague.

It was totally bizarre. We had read a bunch of yelp reviews before we got here saying there was this option where Mr. Fang (the owner) will come up to you and give us the most 'amazing' meal of our lives. Since we were visiting SF, we were hoping for that! After not even getting an opportunity for that, we looked around for Mr. Fang but didn't spot him so we just ordered off the menu. The food was not bad, it wasn't amazing. Yummy and flavorful. To me, it seem like just a upgraded version of Chinese take-out with good presentation. \n\nSo what really ticked me of was: We see Mr. Fang come out greeting tables and what not - and comes up to the table next to us and asks them a bunch of questions, smiling uncontrollably saying they will get the best meal of their lives. Then he proceeded to the table next to them and did the same thing. On top of that, he walked past our table 20 times or so, and didn't even acknowledge us or asked how we were doing? As a restaurant owner, please be mindful of your other customers even if weren't \"chosen\" to have their meals picked by you, Mr Fang.

Yes, it felt a little new, but that will be remedied in due time.\n\nWe began with the cabbage and apple salad. It was huuuge! Christine and I both said \"wow\" as it arrived. Yes, no need to worry, you get your money's worth.  Albeit a touch oily, it was pretty good. The combination proved savory, sweet and refreshing at the same time. I would order it again.\n\nNext, the highly recommended calamari. Christine thought is was the best she has ever had. I wouldn't go that far, but I really enjoyed it. Somehow Fang made thick breaded calamari, light and airy... Impressive.\n\nWe got the side of sweet potatoes because, well, you don't go to House of Nanking without getting them so you should follow suit at its sister restaurant. Also, we assumed that calamari and a salad would never fill us up properly.

At first when my co-worker suggested it, I'll admit I was a bit apprehensive. Fang? What kind of name is that? Is this going to be some weird dirty hole? But I was pleasantly surprised by the modern decor. How San Francisco! What I enjoyed most about Fang is how close it was to our office on Mission Street. It was only a block away and my tired feet in three inch high heels were so grateful! \n\nI looked through my quick tips on my Yelp app and 50 reviews talked about some great guy named Peter. I immediately knew who Peter was because he was the only one smiling and genuinely engaging customers. This guy had to be the owner! (Bells dinging) I was correct! Peter graciously took our order and we shared a number of different entrees. You can eat for $10 a person if you get their lunch entrees which are served with rice. Your food comes out lightning fast but not at the same time. I don't think we had initially planned on sharing our dishes family style but the servers immediately started scooping portions onto each person's plate before we could awkwardly intervene. My co-worker ordered the mongolian beef tower, which when it came out was really more of a one story unit. My peking buns with chicken were a-okay but I would have enjoyed it more if the chicken was not deep fried. One of the girls in our party is vegetarian and she was stoked that she had lots of options to choose from. \n\nOverall it's an easy and affordable place to grab lunch if you're in the area. Portions are sizable on most dishes but the service leaves much to be desired as everyone, except for Peter of course, is short on patience and seems to be annoyed that you've decided to dine there. In Honolulu this is the norm when it comes to Chinese restaurants so I don't know why I expected it to be any different in San Francisco.\n\nYelp 365 Challenge: #189/365 (The Guy Named Peter)", "author": "Emi H."}

When we got there on time, we had to wait 20 minutes before being seated.  What's the point of offering reservations if there's no intention on the part of the restaurant to plan around it?  Since this was part of the work day, some of our party were short on time to eat given we had post-lunch meetings.\n\nAfter being seated, we had to wait some more.  Some of the wait staff stood around but didn't come to take our order.  When we finally caught the attention of one of them, she then motioned to one woman -- apparently, she's the only one who can take the orders and the others only removed dirty plates or served the food.\n\nThe waitress comes over and asks if we'd like her to put together the dishes for us.  Again, since we were short on time we declined.  Her displeasure was very apparent.  Most of us were health conscious, so ordered the brown rice delight.  After about the fourth order, the waitress mutters \"is everyone ordering the same thing?\"  I guess she was annoyed that our table was not going to rack up a big bill as she had hoped.  \n\nIt's too bad the service is so poor, b/c the food is decent.

I thought a menu should showcase the restaurant, not make it a chore to read if you have somewhat poor vision...I did have my contacts on.\n\nVery  limited menu...as I look around, I noticed that the dishes were served likes lunch specials.  Long rectangle plate with one bowl scoop of rice and a small entree portion.  I asked if there was a dish I didn't see on the menu and the waitress had to get the owner...wuz up with that (either yes or no).  Really....not much to talk about with the menu.  As I interact with the service staff more, I began to feel I was in Chinatown.  They were rude and crude.  Only a nice uniform on Chinatown service staff.  Don't expect tea because it's not provided. They charged for tea....only water is provided.  Good way to bump the check total.\n\nDon't be fooled by the decor....it's just a fancy \"hole-in-the-wall.  Believe me....I know good Chinese cooking.\n\nHere's the million dollar question....would I go back?  Noop!!!!!!!", "author": "MickYee M."}

(This was before Hawaii was a state, and before San Pablo Avenue, it's original location, got run over by hookers, and Caucasians lived throughout Oakland rather than just in Piedmont and Montclair). \n\nTurns out, a lot of the \"Hawaiian\" food was simply Chinese styled dishes that were a little sweeter and served with Mai Tais. Triple the prices in a nice decor with cute Chinese waitresses, Chinese chefs barbequing sweet meats on a little stick, and serve it to drink happy suburban soccer Moms, before there were much suburbs or soccer. \n\nBuild on that profitable formula with places like Tommy Toy's, Crustacean's, Slanted Door, Tamarine (Palo Alto) and many others. Even the large corporate chains realized there is money to be made serving Asian food at high prices with fancy decor, like PF Chang's, a corporate food empire based in Scottsdale, Arizona, with all of its (not) Chinese tradition and heritage. \n\nSo enter the popular House of Nanking. This place has been packing them in with cheap diner food for non-Chinese for decades from the edge of Chinatown. The owners finally realized that instead of expanding and spoiling the exclusiveness of waiting to get a seat, why not open an upscale restaurant in a killer downtown location and make more money? \n\nNow they can have working local professionals, conventioneers from Moscone wanting a taste of SF, upscale suburban artsy fartsies from SFMOMA, and businessmen from the W and Marriott hotels, willing to pay more for Chinese food if the decor is nice.\n\nI ordered Mai fu (thin vermicelli noodles) $8.95 + $2 for tofu. Take away the decor/location and this is $5.95 \"Chinese\" food for Caucasians", "author": "Wanugee N."}

I ordered for my meal the hot and sour soup and chicken satay. Both arrived in good order allowing me plenty of time to savor the spices fuming in the bowl as well as the rich spivey chicken along with a cunning bowl of brown rice.

I was pretty sure, but figured I'd ask to make sure that there was gluten in this.  Sure enough, there was and the person dropping it of said I \"probably don't want that\" then and left.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-12-25", "description": "I don't know where to start. My experience at Fang was good and bad, confusing and amusing. A whole lotta contradictions.\n\nA friend and I had a dinner reso a couple of weeks ago. We get led to the back corner of the restaurant where there were 2 super crammed seatings. The kind of crammed seating that you have to bend your knee and walk like a crab to scoot inside the table. Hmm okay, kinda a tight fit I guess. We thought.\n\nThen, like mentioned in the other reviews, a friendly man hurriedly approached our table and asked if we had dined there before. \"No?\" he exclaimed, then closed the menus before us and said that he would take care of us. Oh goody! We thought.\n\nShortly after, while we waited for the 'surprise' dishes to arrive, a party of 4 were getting seated in the table tucked behind us, further into the crammed corner. I watched in slow motion as one of the guys, while trying to crouch down, brushed against my friend's water glass, spilling water all over her leg and seat. A mini chaos ensued as 2 waitresses ran back and fro with napkins, repeated apologies, and a loud request by the other party to be seated elsewhere more \"spacious.\" Their request was immediately granted and they carefully scooted past us (while we held onto our drink glasses) to a table in the main dining space. Boy, that was interesting, THIS is off to a fun start. We thought.\n\nA short time after, a smokey, slightly coconutty fish soup with a bunch of things in it arrived. We were served by the waiter and it tasted pretty good. I couldn't put my finger on the genre of Chinese food given it was smokey, slightly sweet, and milky. Not like any Chinese food I've had in recent days. I thought.\n\nDish number 2 was this portebella mushroom veggie dish that had some soy sauce based glaze drizzled on top. The waiter set down the dish, and then proceeded to serve us the mushrooms by helping to cut them into pieces and then transferring onto our plates. I for one, am not used to being served dishes aside from soups. So I found it a little strange to have the poor guy stand there and awkwardly cut into the droopy mushrooms, and then trying to scoop them up without dropping, onto our plates. Good service I suppose, just unexpected and slightly weird. I thought.\n\nOur dish number 3 (and last) must have been their signature pork belly and pumpkin dish. Now this tasted pretty damn excellent. We both liked the flavor of the pork belly nicely balanced with smooth fragrant pumpkin pieces. Yum! What a difference! I finally thought.\n\nWe quickly stuffed ourselves and our meal at Fang ended soon after that. I don't know, maybe it was just the series of events that unfolded, the unpredictability, the wacky circumstances, the unusual tasting food. It all was a bit too much for me. If you're looking for a cooky and spontaneous dining experience, Fang'll do it for you I bet!", "author": "Jing D."}

We started looking over the menus and after 5 minutes, Mr. Fang came over and started saying \"Ready to or--\" then cut off and wandered away to help one of the waiters. He never came back. Another 5 minutes pass and a different waiter comes over and starts to take away our drink menu without saying anything. We stop him and tell him we haven't ordered yet and he hastily takes our drink order then continues taking the drink menu away (the restaurant was not even half full at the time - do you really not have enough drink menus?). Another 5 minutes pass and a third waiter comes and finally takes our order. During our meal, we got to witness the continued disorganization of the restaurant and wait staff. It seemed like none of the wait staff had specific tables and paid no particular attention to anyone until they were flagged down. *sigh* Here's a rundown of what we ordered, which did at least come out in a timely fashion:\n\nHot green tea with goji berries: Came out in a huge 16 oz. mug. The goji berries were a really nice touch and added something special to the tea.\n\nSteamed vegetable dumplings (because they ran out of chicken dumplings... early on a Saturday night...): Very good, very fresh, chewy wrapper, and cooked perfectly. Served with cilantro giving them something extra. $8.95 for 6 dumplings seemed a little much to me though.\n\nFang's Peking Buns with chicken: A very generous portion with wonderfully made mantao. The chicken was crispy (I do wish it hadn't been fried but still good nonetheless) and flavorful. These buns were open-faced, which I'm not used to, but really good.\n\nCrispy Honey Tofu (because they were out of their vegetarian rice cake... early on a Saturday night...): Crispy exterior with a very creamy interior. The honey sauce was delicious. The bok choy it was served with was not fully cooked and was cold.\n\nA side of brown rice: Never brought it out, which worked out anyway because we didn't end up needing it. Tried to charge us for it and we had to tell them they never brought it out.\n\nHousemade noodles with chicken: Very good, chewy noodles with a decently flavorful sauce and vegetables. The chicken it came with was odd though - breaded but had absolutely no flavor. It was clear they just threw some chicken onto the noodles and did not cook the chicken with the dish. \n\nDry braised spicy green beans: Very good but could have been cooked a little longer. \n\nThis place was OK. Service was awful and for that, I won't be returning. I might ask my husband to order their vegetarian rice cakes to go since he works nearby though... I love rice cakes and it's impossible to find them vegetarian.", "author": "Allison F."}

Now I'll actually share my disappointments.\n\n1. We were seated much later than our reservation. Like 30-40 minutes late when they had the ENTIRE downstairs empty and only offered to seat us there after 30-40 minutes. When I asked them why this was, they simply said people don't usually like sitting down here so we were trying to find something upstairs. You should have at least given me the option...\n2. The staff is just outright rude. There are some cultural differences sure, but they really need to work on customer service. I dropped my chopsticks and went and found a waitress to ask for a new pair. She just told me to sit down and did not address my request at all. I went and found a pair myself behind the counter.\n3. The vegetarian food we had was a little sub par. Good soup and bun sandwiches but the mains were unexciting and not super tasty.\n\n\nI give them 2 stars instead of 1 because Mr. Fang did personally come and tend to our table since it was obvious that I wasn't happy. The meat eaters were happier than us vegetarians but they did a good job of trying to accommodate us and gave us pretty perfect portions. Usually restaurants that offer to bring food to sample the menu end up bringing way too much just to sell plates. They didn't do this so that's a plus.", "author": "Raina B."}

I don't blame them for it.  After all, people go bonkers for lettuce cups with chicken.\n\nFirst, the space is clean and updated.  It's nice to have restaurants near work where you can get a semi-fancy sit down lunch for under $15.  The food itself is exactly what you'd expect: thick, sweetened sauces which you can't help but enjoy even though you know the chef is just taking advantage of you by coating your tastebuds with soy sauce and sugar.  Some dishes shine as a result, like the sesame chicken and lo mein w/ beef.  Others fail, like the gravitationally-challenged Mongolian beef tower.  Dumplings were mediocre, and the won ton soup was acceptable.\n\nService is a bit of a mess, despite the presence of Mr. House of Nanking himself, a seasoned restauranteur... not really sure how the servers lose focus so easily, but the place has now been open long enough for them to iron out the kinks.\n\nWord to the wise: there are a couple of tables tucked in a nook along the window away from the door.

Ok, we had a strange experience but the food made up for it.\n\nAttending the giant conference (no names mentioned) this week of Oct in the SF that basically takes over the entire city so lunch was going to be a difficult proposition. After trying several places within walking distance from Moscone Center, we gave Fang a shot and we lucked out as they were able to accommodate the 7 of us. Owner Peter Fang was on hand to  lead us down the stairs to the \"VIP\" room that actually sits more like 10-12. Here's the weird part. After we sit, he says \"I'll take care of you\" and leaves without giving us the menu to order. Ordinarily, if I were paying the $, I'd be sweating bullets wondering if he'll be bringing oysters, lobsters, Kobe beef, etc., i.e. the big $ food. But since this was on company dime, bring it on! My boss will probably beg to differ but that's his problem!\n\nSoon enough, the food starts showing up. Since we had no menu, I have zero clue what we had exactly but here's the run down of what I recall:\n- Sliced portobello mushroom. The mushrooms were meaty and delicately flavored.\n- Beef with green beans. Beef was lightly crisp on the outside and tender inside. Very well seasoned. Green beans were fresh, nice and crisp as well. This was so good, we ordered another.\n- Bao with roasted pork. Kind of reminds me of Chairman Truck baos. Those are better but these aren't bad either. Sweet roasted pork with crunch of veges inside.\n- Sliced fish with veges. Nicely marinated fish and cooked to tenderness (as opposed to overcooked and stinky).\n- Chicken stir fried with veges. Hints of General Tso's chicken but infinitely superior as this had none of that awful thick batter and sugary sweetness (think Panda Express). Chicken was marinated for flavorful bite with slight spiciness. \n\nFortunately for my boss, the bill wasn't all that bad at about $30/person before tip. Other than the strange service, the food itself is tasty but don't expect your usual Chinese fare like what they serve in Chinatown.", "author": "Norman S."}

I don't know if it was because of the conference going on around the corner or what, but I've been to other restaurants that were crazy busy, yet still managed to be on the ball. Here at Fang, they dropped the ball.\n\nI could write paragraphs and long diatribes, but I'll summarize: we waited way too long to actually place our order; we asked two separate servers about getting water, yet no one actually delivered it to us until midway through our meal; my \"starter\" soup seemed to have been forgotten and it wasn't until we said something that it came out, while I was in the middle of my entree; a tea one of my friends ordered never arrived; my entree was supposed to come with rice, yet it was never brought out; and finally (and the worst part), two entrees came out, then there was 15 minutes until the other two came out, leaving two of my friends sitting there waiting while two of us ate. The last two plates came out only because someone noticed us sitting there with half our meal missing and asked us if there was a problem, then seemed to put in a rush order to get the last two out.\n\nThis makes me all a bit sad because the food we actually got was pretty good (although I will say that I've had better hot and sour soup elsewhere, theirs isn't that great). Between the four of us, we tried the onioncake (delicious), tofu in black bean sauce (yum), sesame chicken (DELISH), honey steak (meh, wasn't what was expected, but one person said it was amazing) and brown rice delight (with tofu and mushrooms, was healthy and good, but definitely not the taste explosion you're looking for). Their blossom tea was good too, and the budding flower in it definitely is a sight to see.\n\nI'm sad that the service was so terrible though. I'm not sure I'd be back, despite the food being so good. I'd love to try it again, there were definitely a few things that grabbed my attention, but between the horrendous wait time (could be blamed on the conference) and the overall dissatisfaction with the service, I'm not sure I'd be up for trying again.

First a huge security concern: the register is at the hostess station and the waiters leave customers' credit cards of top of the  hostess counter where they're visible to anyone standing in the lobby and can be easily taken.  I saw them lay four customers' cards on the counter and I could have easily walked off with them.\n\nThe service: you don't feel welcomed.  No one greets you when you come in.  Staff practically throws your food and plates on the table.  Peter Fang took our order.  He didn't say hello, he didn't greet us.  Just stood silently at our table with a pen and pad of paper.  When a waitress brought out my dish, she called it by a different name than in the menu which led to my thinking that she got the order wrong.  The serving dishes are way too large for the tiny tables, leaving you no room for your own plate.  \n\nCleanliness: there was leftover food on our table.  My plate was dirty.  I asked Mr. Fang for another plate.  He took away the dirty one, but never brought me a clean one.  Old food stuck on the walls.  The floor could use a good steam clean.  The entire restaurant needs to be decluttered; the hostess station has a bunch of unnecessary junk behind it.  There was a mop sitting out next to the hostess station.  It's like they don't care how they look.  \n\nThe food: the Mongolian beef was very good.  My egg rolls came sliced with an overly salty sauce poured over them.  The duck steamed buns tasted soggy.

Our friends are originally from Japan but drove up to SF from Orange County, so after a day of SF touring (Fisherman's Wharf, GG Bridge, Painted Ladies), we arranged to have dinner near where they parked their car in SOMA.  We ended up at Fang since the birthday girl wanted some Chinese food and Fang was the closest/best option we had given our needs.\n\nThe owner came over and we asked for the soup dumpings and 8 Treasure Salad.  When we ordered a wonton soup, he said he'd make us \"a better one\" and then we gave him permission to bring us the dishes that he recommends.\n\nThe soup dumpings were tasty and the salad was awesome. It was crisp and a bit tangy but still had a nice roundness to it with some sesame oil. I'd eat this again.\n\nFor other dishes that we shared family style, we ended up with:\n- Wonton plus whole fish soup: just ok; a little bland and a touch disappointing\n- Lobster with apple: tasty and unique, though perhaps a touch too much mayo on the lobster (it was walnut prawn style just with lobster and apples instead)\n- chicken with bell pepper: tasted fine but nothing particularly remarkable\n- calamari: yummy! not small mostly battered pieces of calamari, but nice big meaty pieces that I rather enjoyed\n- portobello mushrooms with barley topping: pretty unique and really tasty!  I thought the basil would overwhelm the dish but it was done really well. I kind of want to recreate this at home\n\nI was worried that with all the dishes and one really fancy one (lobster) that the price would skyrocket without our knowing it. However, when the bill came it was simply listed as \"open table\" and our total bill, including some teas and beer, came out to about $30 per person including tax and tip.

Red Asian lanterns hang from the ceiling, gold statues on the wall, lots of seating and even a full bar on side with additional seating for us booze hounds to suck down cocktails.\n\nThe lunch menu consisted of various potstickers for apps, so we started with the pork dumplings ($8.95) and fried Shrimpackets ($5.95). Large in size and portion, we had a few bites leftover. \n\nWe each selected an entree that comes with white rice (or your choice of brown for a dollar more), but after the first two plates came out, we canceled the last because there was simply too much food. I opted for brown rice, but they informed me that they hadn't made it yet, which I could have opted to wait, but we were crunched for time. \n\nThe Mongolian Beef ($13.95) is piled high above fried shrimp noodles, scallions, onions and covered in a tangy and super spicy sauce. Not for the weak. The Nanking sesame chicken ($10.95) is another great choice which is served with sweet potato slices and star fruit.\n\nFor two apps, two entrees, a green tea and Diet Coke, this filling meal was under 50 bucks.

Soon after our waiter delivered our menus, Mr. Fang stopped by our table and told us that he would \"take care of us\". Within two minutes, we had a plate of deliciously cooked portabella mushrooms on our table to share. Mr. Fang brought us plate after plate of Chinese delicacies. As I mentioned at the top of my review, this was some of the best Chinese food I have ever had. Each plate was designed to complement and balance the others. Even with a couple of vegetarians in our party, everyone was satisfied.\n\nMy only complaint was the price. Thirty seconds with the menu gave me the impression that I would end up paying ~$20 for my meal, including tip. It ended up being nearly $40 per person--not outrageously expensive, but definitely more than I expected.\n\nIf you order off the menu, you should have no issues with cost.

Located right next to Gold Club off Howard street, the place fit in snugly in the district. The ambiance is a nice setting, with wooden couture and Asian History hanging on the walls. Nice flow and feng shui.\nI used to recommend Fang to our guests and friends and family out of town all the time. My cousin was pleased and so were my guests. But I was very disappointed when I came here myself. \nThey seated us in a window seat. The restaurant was decently packed. We had made a reservation and my girlfriend had said her name, but they just said yes, and gave us a window seat. Yes, the Chef came out to make our order. \nWe ordered a plain Won Ton Soup, presentation was nice. Individual Chinese ceramic bowls .... it was good. Spicy, full of seasons and hearty. Then I saw a strand of hair in my cup!  I told the waitress and she said sorry, she'd bring me another one. Uhhhmmm.... I don't want another one after I knew there was hair in the cup? Don't you think? Come on. You're 5 stars right?\nThen we ordered the Eggplant Rice cakes. They were out but the Chef substituted for the tofu one, which was delicious. Our Salted Pork Belly saut\u00e9ed with pumpkin and sweet potato was good as well. The Blossom Flower Tea was good. Could have been in a nicer glass. It was put in a beer glass? Ehhhh? \nSo 2/3 plates were delicious, but the hair ruined it. It happens though right? Now get this, next to us was a four top. No one sitting there. But behind me was a Bar. So the back seat of our 2 top and the bar were touching. No one could get to that 4 top. Why would you seat someone there? But they did. What's weird is, the restaurant was DECENT sized packed, but not fully. So I must have gotten out of my chair 10 times (not exaggerating) to let the 3 person party in and out and the waitress in and out. When the guest said, why don't we move here, the waitress condescendingly said, \"oh so do you want me to move you now?\" No apology from the waitress, just hitting my chair. Not the party's fault. They were here to bring a friend from out of town who had heard of the place too. \nRude customer service. After they realized how mistreated we were with the hair in the soup and the inconsideration of the other table parties, no apology was done or to fix it. They didn't even give us the check in time. We had to ask for it 2x! Then they made us go up to the counter to pay. \nNo, will not tell my guests or friends and family to come here ever again.

We had a reservation and upon arrival were seated promptly. After a few minutes someone came by and without introduction asked if we wanted drinks. Those were brought fairly quickly but after that no one even looked our way for at least twenty minutes. We didn't even know who our waiter was so we didn't know who's attention to try and get. After another few minutes an extremely rude man came over to take our order. He was very impatient made no suggestions and again didn't greet us or speak to us other than to impatiently take our order as if we were bothering him. I was shocked to find out this is apparently the owner of the establishment! I was shocked and disappointing but was hoping still that the food would wow us and the nonexistent service would be forgiven. Alas that was not the case our spareribs were very greasy and unevenly cooked, the buns were extremely bland and the same with the noodles. In fact we left a lot of food on the table but no one asked if we enjoyed our dinner or if anything was wrong with our food.

I was in for a suprise indeed.\nI walked into a packed restaurent that was packed and asked for a table and was asked to wait few minutes. I saw the various pictures and awards mr. Peter Fang had recieved.\n\nI was next quicked assigned a table and sat down, the ambiance was nice and even more I like the smell of nice aroma in the air, they have an open style kitchen where one can see what is being prepared, always a plus once can watch them work and they have nothing to hide.\n\nMy wife ordered a Thai ice tea and I needed to keep my tongue clean to get an accurate reading of the food here so I opted for water without ice. After few minutes Mr. Peter Fang showed up and asked us what we wanted to eat. I said \" HEY you are Peter Fang\" I saw you in the picture up front, much younger and less grey hair... he said YES. I said you have more grey hair now and I hope the your food had matured with your hair and its better now... and he laughed.\n\nI said I have only one requirment i.e. We are all eating 100% vegetarian. I have a sore throat and would prefer a small soup & I will let you decide my Menu, so suprise me!. He wrote some things down and handed it to an assistant and was gone and I waited for the food.\n\nFirst to arrive was the asparagus salad, excellent, fresh, cooked al dante, spicy and eveything seems right in this dish, I really wanted to gobble it all up however had to share it with my wife. The next dish was Zuccini fried fritters in a open face pao bun, this was a nice combnation of the soft open face bun with the crispy breaded zuccini, the second home run.\n\nThe third was an eggplant dish that was like a schzwan style eggplant that was cooked right and not sweet like some of the Amrican chineese version, I did not have to over spice this at all as its a compliment to the chef.\n\nThe fourth dish was a saucy Vegetable and Tofu curry which resembled a Malaysican curry with a very nice flavour that was done right with the correct amount of cocunut milk. I was also served a small bowl of vegatable soup with cripy fried rice whihc I polished off quickly.\n\nI polished every disk clean and could not imagine we had nothing to pack amongst two of us, as you baby just ate rice.\n\nThis is the most satisfying Chineese meal I have had in a very, very long time. There are very few meals that I have had around the world that have been memorable and I can recollect in flash \"Sala Rim Na - Bangkok\", \"Victoria - Le marais, paris\", \"Park Hyaat - Goa\" to name a few.

Beef lo-mein had really unappealing potroast-style beef pieces on top of bland noodles; adding hot sauce make it at least flavorful.  Sesame chicken was probably the best, but consisted of highly-breaded pieces of chicken buried under sliced yams, so it didn't end up being that much actual food.\n\nThe tea, however, was excellent.

After being seated the chef-owner Peter Fang came over and asked if we had dined there before.  We told him it was our first experience, to which he replied, \"Would you trust me to order for you?\"  We enthusiastically agreed and away he went to the kitchen.   Every dish was simply amazing--hard to pick a favorite, but the crispy honey steak with bok choy and the 5-spice white fish were spectacular; I wish I had taken pictures!  Best of all, none of the dishes were oily or over-cooked - they were perfect; a well balance between traditional Chinese with a slight modern emphasis.  I'm a huge fan of Fang!", "author": "Adam S."}

This restaurant came highly recommended to us by our local San Francisco friends, who only had amazing things to say about the food and service at Fang. I only wish that we had the same experience.\nLet the story begin:\nFour of us, all New Yorkers, arrived at Fang on a Sunday night around 8:45pm. The owner of the restaurant, greeted us at the table and was very friendly. He presented us with menus and asked  where we were visiting from. After a brief conversation, he inquired about any possible food allergies that the chef should be aware of. After we told him our restrictions, he told us to give him the menus back, (we never even had the chance to open them!). He told us he would be doing all of the ordering for us and sent a waitress over to take our drink order.\nThis is where the fun begins.....\n   I told the waitress that I wanted a decaf  Chinese tea. She brought me out an iced coffee. When I asked her if there was caffeine in it she said \"no\". It was obvious that this drink was coffee, so my friend informed her that I was pregnant and that I was advised  not drink caffeinated drinks...she then admits that it has caffeine in it and brings me back an herbal tea, with dried fruit and herbs floating on the top (which got stuck to my lip gloss every time I took a sip...so annoying)!!! Really!!! All I wasted was some Chinese tea!\n     Now for the food... First  the appetizers, dumplings with peanut sauce..not bad but nothing to rave about. Next, green peppers tempura...again, average. After that, he brought out a portobello mushroom, sliced in four, that had some grains and scallions.. that was good, but 2 out of 4 of us don't like mushrooms, so that was a waste. Then there was a pumpkin soup with baby shrimp, interesting and good, but nothing that we really wanted to order.\n   The main dishes were served family style. Fried shrimp in a light sauce with apples tempura... dish was very heavy for 9pm ...but the apples were yummy. Then a beef that was served with two half-cooked pieces of bok choy..the meat was tender but it seemed like it was deep fried and very oily. Last were spare ribs. They were also deep fried and very heavy. The whole time, we had wished that we were able to select our own dinner...but the owner was adamant about placing the order for us.\n     So here is the pinnacle of the story... We realize that we are the second to last table  left in the dining room and all of the lights in the restaurant suddenly dimmed. We knew we were finishing up, but dimming the lights made us feel like they were waiting for us to get out so they could close. Then suddenly, I see a look of horror across my wife's face. I hear her say to our friend, \"Oh my God, it's a roach and its crawling up the wall. My other friend now realizes that mama roach is accompanied by a family of baby roaches and instinctively, we all drop our forks. \n      The owner of the restaurant, notices that we have spotted the critters, and instructs his waitress not to kill it but rather to ignore that it was even there! Two of us got up and walked out because they were grossed out, while I stayed back and asked for the check with a friend. When the check came, not only did the owner NOT apologize after we confronted him, but he charged us $175.00 for a dinner that was not only cut short, but certainly not worth almost 200 bucks! \n     When we got back to our hotel, we went to the website and added up the prices of our items. The total was $116.00 with the drinks included. WE TOTALLY GOT ROBBED! The next morning we went back to Fang to talk to the manager. The owner was not in yet, but she was very kind and understanding. She said she was unable to give us an itemized bill from the night before because the computer system could not access it. However, she promised to email the receipt once the owner arrived because he had access to the system... A week later, and we are still waiting for the Email to arrive!\n     Honestly, we are not snobby diners and coming from NYC, we know roaches are everywhere...BUT they should not be visible to diners with the dimming of a light, nor should the owner not compensate diners for spotting roaches in between bites. We were very disappointed in the costumer service and the lack of followup. There are so many AMAZING places to eat in San Fran...Fang is definitely not one of them.", "author": "Deana F."}

I asked him several times to tell us what he suggests and that we're particular with food...he kept on saying, \"trust me...I'm a chef...trust me\".

I told Mr. Fang to cancel anything else he ordered for us and I ordered what I actually wanted.\n\nThe food wasn't bad and some dishes were pretty tasty.

Forgot the names, but they said the drink was a bit too strong and the soup was plain bad. We ordered chicken sesame, some shrimp dish (shrimps covered in batter, deep fried and served with some creamy sauce over it), and was recommended a third dish, which was a mix of cilantro, beef, apples slices, a few more ingredients, and something that tastes very much like rice crispies. \n- Shrimp dish: Not bad, not a big wow either. We wanted something else that one of us had here before and tried to describe the dish to them, but it wasn't the right one. \n- The beef salad-ish dish: I personally actually like it- the rice crispies added a nice texture to the dish, but all 3 of my friends didn't like it. They said it's a bit too \"interesting\". \n- The sesame chicken: probably the best dish of the night. Flavor is right, could have been better if we weren't so disappointed with the service. Which brings me to my next point.\n\nService: Sucks. The waitress came. We asked about the shrimp dish that we had before, she wasn't quite sure what it was. We asked for suggestion, and she kept trying to get us to order some soup, and also appeared to be in such a rush. We weren't happy, so we talked to the owner about the shrimp dish, he thought it was dish A, but when it was out... it wasn't what we want. We didn't like what he recommended either. Worst yet, we had to ask FOUR TIMES for rice, and TWICE for water. \n\nI wouldn't complain if it was a cheap Chinese restaurant down the street.

When we arrived there was a note on the door that said they were closed for private event but a lady was standing outside with the clipboard and took us in through the back of the restaurant. The restaurant was quite full and when we were seated at our table the server asked for our drink order. I had not even had a chance to look at the menu or take off my coat. They came back a little while later and got our drink order: a diet coke and a coctail.  The soda came first but unfortunately was regular coke and we asked the server to switch it. He yelled at someone to get a diet coke... But that beverage never came. Luckily, there was a pitcher of water on the table so my friend drank it instead. The same server took our dinner order: 3 main dishes and rice for two.  The food came pretty quickly, but no rice. I attempted many times to flag down another server to alert them of the mistake. I couldn't get anyone's attention. Two larger parties had arrived so our two top table was now less important. No one ever came back to our table to check on us, offer a refill... Nothing. We ended up eating our Chinese dinner with no rice. We were about halfway through our riceless dinner and a different server breezed by and slides our check on the table without stopping. Again, no concern regarding our experience, no offer of takeout boxes for leftovers... Nothing. It was obvious the goal of FANG that evening was to churn out as many tables as possible. We were in the place for a grand total of 45 minutes. I'm definitely not high maintenance and I worked as a server in college, so I know things can get crazy when you have large parties and therefore the service might be slower.

Very light and fresh but flavorful Chinese food (surprisingly low on grease especially for American Chinese food). Everyone loved their dishes and we shared the green onion cake and steamed pork pot stickers both of which were perfectly seasoned and had great sauces. All of the portions were more than generous as well.\n\nI will say that the service was a bit lacking...not the most friendly or attentive but not a total turnoff. All the dishes came out quickly and one after another so I cannot complain.\n\nHowever I would like to address all the people complaining about the food having too much MSG. Can we get with modern times please?? Scientists have long debunked the myth that MSG is super bad for you. Like salt and butter its not the best for you health in the long run but its not at all bad even to eat every day. It does not cause headaches (unless you are allergic, which is a very small minority of the population) or sleepiness (thats because you ate too much duh). Stop and think about it, an entire continent eats it on a daily basis and they are amongst the most productive and longest living people on the planet. Quit buying into the placebo...MSG itself has very little flavor and it just enhances the flavor of what its put in (trust me I have a bottle of it in my pantry and Ive tasted it plain) so those claiming they can taste it are just trying to find something to pick on.\n\nAnywho, rant done and over. \n\nBottom line, Fang isn't your cheap bottom barrel Chinese food. Its higher class with some unique and healthy twists.

(House of Nanking is their sister restaurant) Again, the food is tasty (also because they use $#itload of MSG), but their food presentation is quite nice, actually. \n\nAnyway, their fried beef dish is surprisingly good (I've never had fried beef until Fang's) and the bakchoy is really crispy - not sure how they make it so crispy, but it's good.  We asked for a chef special - give us whatever you got for 2 people -  and they brought out a ginormous bowl of soup (that looked like it would feed 10 people) and one fried beef dish.  In the past (when they first opened, that is), Peter was much nicer and paid more attention to what was served, IMO.  For instance, if I asked for \"whatever you would recommend for 2 people\", then he'd serve: \n1. a small bowl of soup for 2\n2. one appetizer dish for 2 (instead of a dish that might come with 4 buns to feed 4 people) \n3. smaller sized main dish - probably two different kinds. \n\nThis time, we seriously got one HUGE soup bowl + one dish - the guys next to us asked, wow what is that.  Is that the White Russian (?) soup?  The lady goes, yes.  Then the guys go - wth? We tried to order that and they said they didn't have it.  Clearly, they were like WTH?  Maybe I wasn't the only one speaking an Alien language! Yes! \n\nBottom line is that this place is good, but omg, it's superloaded with MSG.  I wonder if it's even possible to make their dish w/o MSG.  I think that if I ever go back there, I'll ask if they can make my food w/o any MSG - although, I\"m not sure they will understand my request. \n\nWe both walked out, feeling that weird MSGness you get.... numbness (my arms still feel really heavy right now), fatigue, headache, etc... if you don't know what side effects you can get with MSG, look it up: MSG SIDE EFFECTS.  Then go eat at Fang's - after you've enjoyed your delicious meal that was super-enhanced by MSG, you'll be in MSG lalaland in no time.  We felt it even before we left the restaurant.  Good luck.", "author": "Catherine H."}

As soon as you walk in, you're greeted to a modern, swanky area with touches of traditional Chinese decoration. The hostesses and waiters are attentive, helpful, and friendly. Whenever my family and I go here we always ask for the chef to have free reign over whatever he gives us. Essentially, we get about 8 dishes, with around 3 or 4 being appetizers. Usually we ask for a mix of vegetarian and chicken dishes, and each dish is always absolutely incredible. The flavors are unique, work well together, and always delicious. Your service is fast and you will relish every bite of the food and the layers of flavor that it has. It has consistently impressed me with their prowess in wonderful Asian Fusion cuisine and I can't wait to come back for more!", "author": "Arushi D."}

The owner approached the table took the lunch menu from us and said no, no, I take good care of you. We went along with it feeling it would be an adventure. So we got a surprise lunch. First marinated snow peas. Excellent!\nSecond course a crispy deep fried rice pocket. It was excellent except we prefer not to eat deep fried food. Next course a spicy fish soup. It looked like it had some coconut milk in it, noodles, basil, lemon grass and some other spice that I can't name. We were told to be careful as the fish has bones. It was very good. The main course was some beef that seemed to have been marinated, then got a thin coating with spices in it and was deep fried and placed over Bock joy. The beef was very tender and tasty. Again we prefer not to eat much deep fried food but it was good. The tab was higher than what we would have spent if we had ordered what we had already picked. On the high side, including taxes about $50. It was definitely a culinary adventure. I would want to try some of their food on the menu next time I am in SF and I will go back.

The waitress took a poll of the people at the table (vegetarian/pescatarian/carnivore) and brought out delicious, well-prepared food that pleased everyone. The only issue I had was with the cocktail I ordered - I think it was called the Green Dragon? It was incredibly syrupy and tasted like alcohol-infused candy. And not in a good way.

I want to say up front I'm a big fan of Kathy Fang and her cooking blog. I love the recipes she posts. That being said tho having been to Fang four times over the last year I am incredibly disappointed in the way the restaurant is run. All four times the service has been horrible. The way it goes is I'm seated in a near empty restaurant, and ignored for 15 minutes before some one comes over and asks if I want to order yet. Then I never see that server again. Eventually Peter or some one else will come over and ask the same thing and then things get started. Don't run out of beer or other drinks because in all four trips I couldn't get ANYONE to refill my glass or even order another beer for me. Then again maybe I was in the wrong place because two of the four times all the kids who work there were running around in \"House of Nanking\" tees.

My Dad worked very hard in his career and on the weekends we were always in San Francisco sampling the new tastes of Asia. At the time, I didn't know why we would wait an hour for a bowl of noodles, but I definitely sure do now. Sometimes it doesn't matter how much money you make, it's what you put in your body that counts the most.\n\nChef de Cuisine Kathy Fang is pioneering traditional Chinese fare with a modern twist on dishes we love to eat. Unlike most Chinese restaurants that skimp on service and presentation, Fang restaurant exudes elegance, charm, and cleanliness. The crowd is vibrant with an electric crowd of educated young professionals.\n\nPeter Fang seems to have a big hand in the development as well. As a restaurateur with 22+ years of experience you can tell he loves what he does. You can see him in the restaurant taking care of patrons to this day. The logistics of the establishment is built for private small groups, large corporate parties, and even late night DJ parties if they choose to go that route. The vision you see in the architecture and the openness of the kitchen show that they are very in tune with what is in vogue.\n\nNow to experience the food:\n\nFang's Peking Dumplings - Meat inside a bun, need I say more. It's perfect exploitation of savory, sweet, and spice. The Umami of tacos, Kat Fang has created a marvel of appetizing delicacy that cannot be missed.\n\n8 Treasure Salad - Fresh, Crisp, Spicy, with a hint of Crunch. This truly is a hidden treasure of flavor and splendor.\n\nCrispy Short Rib - Crispity Crunchity and oh so Giggity. You cannot go to a Chinese restaurant and not try their short ribs. It is a delicacy of fine Chinese cuisine that spans form Canton to Shanghai and ends in Taipei, you have to try it.\n\nMei Fun with Beef - Chili, Basil, Garlic, Ginger, and Rice Noodles: The combination tantalizes the five senses with exploratory journey of spice, sensibility and comfort.\n\nYou must respect business owners that show up to work everyday. It doesn't matter what you do, but have passion for what you do.", "author": "Justin N."}

But this place is superb!! It's on the fancy side, but it's also authentic (I hate \"fusion\") and I think the attempt at being trendy actually works here. Really like the sweet and sour soup, owner also just whipped up some fish soup once and that was yummy, eggplants and other veggies tried were good. Oh, had ribs once and it was too fatty, no thanks on that. Tofu was great. Even though it's \"fancy\" i didn't feel like it was over priced.", "author": "Kayan H."}

He was super friendly and told us he would choose our dishes for us.  All through the night, he was checking on various parties in the restaurant.\n\nWe had the peking duck and White River soup.  The peking duck was not your traditional dish - it was more meat than crispy skin.  Fortunately, that's the way I prefer to eat my duck.  The meat was really flavorful and juicy!  The whitefish soup was awesome!  The soup was similar to your traditional white hotpot spicy broth but milder.  The fish was a small fried whitefish, and there were wontons and peanuts in the soup.  Wontons were really yummy, but the fish had little meat and some scales that weren't removed.  I would have preferred the fish steamed, but that's just me.\n\nThe waiters forgot to ask us if we wanted dessert, and I was kinda eyeing the glutinous rice balls with sesame (one of my favorite Chinese desserts).  \n\nNevertheless, I overall liked this place a lot and will be back!", "author": "Melissa W."}

I would be hard-pressed to say I can go back comfortably. \n\nWhen my husband and I discovered it, we were so excited that there was another place just like Nan King, but in a more convenient location. I have even taken my parents there when they are visiting, and it has been enjoyable.\n\nWhich brings us to last night -- the husband and I had tickets to a movie at the metreon, so of course we head to Fang for a tasty dinner beforehand. \n\nAfter wading through throngs of people leaving the Moscone Center, we were pleased to see that Fang had a fair number of tables open. We were seated in the corner, on a four-top table which they adjusted for us. We ordered a drink and a salad, which came quickly, and we mentioned that we would be ordering our entrees soon enough. \n\nBefore we could do so, the hostess came over and sort-of-asked-but-mostly-directed us to move to a smaller two-top table, as they had a party of five to seat. Slightly annoying but nothing that I can't handle. \n\nHowever, after we moved, they proceeded to basically ignore us, seemingly  because we were not among the big groups of conference attendees who began to stream in. We had to flag someone down to order our food, and one of the many people who would seem to be waiters said we had to wait to place our order with the owner. And, here's the deal, by this point, they were bringing plate after plate of food to the table literally 6 inches away from us (who had been seated after we were). During all those visits to our general vicinity, they took no time to ask us how our food was, see if we wanted more drinks, and never brought us the soup that we had asked for. \n\nI can be pretty tolerant with a number of situtations, as can my husband, but we were both pretty offended by the end of the meal. To top it all off, I had to stand up and put my coat on for them to actually notice that we were ready to go. At that point, the owner came over and basically tossed the bill at us. It was like they couldn't wait for us to leave. \n\nOnce again, let me stress, I have had great experiences here before, which is why this is so disappointing.", "author": "Fred L."}

The dish I liked the least was a fish soup - chunks of white seafood with the skin still attached simmering in a light broth.  Aside from that, the traditional beef and chicken wok dishes, noodles, and salads were delicious and generously plated.  The wine selection was decent as well.\n\nI probably won't go back next time I'm in the area, as there are so many other options to try, but Fang isn't bad for a chinese option near the Moscone Center if you're in the area for a convention.", "author": "Emily R."}

She is a fellow foodie so she likes to try out new restaurants with me when she's in town.  She suggested we try this place and when I walked passed it, I noticed it was a relatively new spot in the downtown area.  The decor was very contemporary Asian, much like the food.  When we glanced at the menu, I recognized some dishes and realized that this was a new sister restaurant of the House of Nanking, which is near where I live.  I like some of the dishes at the House of Nanking so I thought I would order a familiar dish called the fragrant basil chicken.  My client ordered the Nanking sesame chicken.  I love the fact that both the House of Nanking and this restaurant serve brown rice.\n\nMy client and I had to review some documents while waiting for our meals and we didn't get too far into our discussion when our dishes arrived.  Very prompt service!  We ordered a spinach salad to share which was very tasty.  My basil chicken, however, had a tough texture, and came with hardly any basil, unlike the one they serve at the House of Nanking.  My client liked her sesame chicken.\n\nOne extra star for prompt service, which is helpful, especially during a business Iunch.  I probably will return here to try the other dishes and have their spinach salad again.  I do hope they work on making their basil chicken more tender, and with more basil (better yet, just ask the other cook at their sister restaurant, House of Nanking, to make it).", "author": "V B."}

We were getting ready to order when he asked if we had any food allergies. We said no and he asked - \"if you trust me, I'll serve you.\" He was so welcoming of course we said yes.\n\nThe waitresses then proceeded to serve us 6 amazing courses that completed the best Chinese dinner I think I've ever had. It started with a shrimp, tomato, mushroom and cilantro salad drenched in sesame oil. Next, they brought out Chinese steamed beef buns with braised shortrib, pickled veggies and scalion ginger. As the entree, a mix of BBQ pork spareribs with pineapple honey garlic glaze, five spice whitefish with jade spinach, and the Nanking sesame chicken with sweet potatoes. We rounded it off sharing the sesame apple crisp stuffed and black sesame rice ball soup.\n\nIt was a great evening spent with friends and we'll definitely be back for more - next time the steamed Shanghai soup dumplings! 5 stars for sure and we'll also be visiting his second restaurant, the House of Nanking, in Chinatown soon.", "author": "Erin C."}

The \"MSG\" chicken was good as well, with nice chunks of meat and bell peppers.  Mayonnaise beef is a little bit strange, but I think some people will enjoy this dish.

First off I am Chinese and have lived and eaten REAL chinese food my whole life. I have avoided House of Nanking for this very reason, and laugh at all of the tourist that line up for FAKE overpriced Chinese food! So anyway, I went to a party at this new place FANG and only then noticed the waiters wearing House of Nanking tee shirts, so I asked if it was the same owner, and they responded yes, much to my dismay! \n1. We first started with a Lobster soup with 1 wonton. As any self respecting Chinese knows, you never serve just 1 wonton, its not proper and is considered bad luck. I give the soup 2 stars..\n2. Steamed bun with BBQ pork. About as pedestrian as you can get. 1 Stars.\n3. Pot Sticker, vegetarian, but only with diakon radish filling. I guess they were running out of meat in the kitchen, again 1 Pot sticker, bad luck!  Plus it was greasy. 1 Star. \n4.  Deep fried beef cubes with apple slices. Weird, texture to the beef, no sauce the apple slices just didn't add anything to the dish. 1 star.\n5. Pork Spareribs on top under cooked bok choy. Typical sweet ribs, like you would get from the frozen section at Safeway, plus rawish bok choy, unless your a rabbit maybe. 1 stars\n6. Stir fried String beans. This was the most authentic dish of the night. I guess its pretty hard to mess this dish up. 3 stars.\n7. Deep fried shrimp with apples (again)! They must have gotten a deal on Apples. This dish was the worst. The shrimp were tiny, and mushy, probably not fresh. The apples were cubed and breaded and also deep fried, which made them mushy. So mushy shrimp along with mushy apples probably equates to many hours on the toilet, I avoided this dish for my own health. Negative -10 stars.\n8 Pea sprouts leaves with peas. If my grandmother was alive and on the farm, this is the dish I would expect to see on my dinner plate. Uninspiring poor village food.\nUpscale - only if you measure things by what they charge\nService - I got better service standing in the Panda Express Line.\nWould I return - if I woke up one day and found out every chinese restaurant in the world was closed down my answer would be: NO!\nLast bit of humor, as I was leaving I noticed the owner standing at the exit shaking everyones hand as they left. \nHe stopped me as asked, \" Are you from San Francisco?\" \nResponse \" Yes\"\nOwner, \"Have you eaten at my other restaurant House of Nanking\" \nResponse \"No\"\nOwner, \"Did you enjoy your meal tonight?'\nResponse, \"No\"\nOwner,\"Oh!!

We didn't know what to expect but the first dish that my friend had ordered wasn't great, so we thought why not. The chef and owner must know what's good, right?\n\n-Fried square of veggie: this my friend ordered and it was just like a big fried wonton skin. Please avoid.\n-Peking Duck Buns: tasty but the buns got a little soggy.\n-Noodles w/ seafood: we were served individual portions of some sort of noodle soup dish which had some shrimp, clams, and veggies. I didn't particularly like all the flavor in it but the presentation in the square bowls was really pretty.\n-Fried pork ribs w/ green beans: Probably my favorite dish, the pork ribs were tender, and slightly sweet, with nice garlic sauteed green beans. Never seen it in that combo. Quite tasty.\n-Fried whole fish w/ green onion: We were presented with an entire fish that had been lightly fried first for nice firm texture and then was cooked with some green onion and hot oil sauce. A classic preparation style. Really good, nice and light, and authentic.\n\nFor dessert, Peter came and gave us some complimentary plum wine and cute little almond shortbread cookies. In total our meal with a few bottles of Sapporo came out to $35 each with tax and tip. Not bad.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the ambiance and Peter's personal attention.

I didn't know pouring water is such a complicated task that you can't even take orders at the same time?  \n\nBy the way, the place wasn't very clean.  There was some noodles on my seat.  So this other guy came to take our order.  But the owner came, and took over.  I ordered the fang honey steak.  When it came, I thought they got my order wrong.  My \"steak\" was cut into cubes, with some sort of dry rub on it, and it was so dry it tasked more like beef jerky.  The bok choy that came with it was still raw, with pepper flakes on it, and some other spice.  When you bite into it, you can feel the grainy texture, so it feels like you're eating a bunch of dirt.  \n\nI was not impressed by this restaurant at all, and will never return.", "author": "Qui F."}

I'm pretty generous when it comes to Chinese food, and I do have a thing for Panda Express! I was here the other night and ordered the Mongolian Beef. I've had various styles of Mongolian beef, but this one was below par. Being a $15 dish, I expected more. You could taste the baking powder or whatever they used to tenderize the beef. They also had this hard noodle under the main entree which almost seemed like they used as a filler for the dish itself. The only reason I didn't give it only 1 star is because this is the only dish I tried at this restaurant. I might go back to try something else, but definitely not the weirdly tenderized Mongolian beef.", "author": "Mark C."}

Being in San Francisco, I was looking forward to some good Chinese, there doesn't seem to be a solid place in San Diego. Granted I had my heart set on either something super traditional and exotic or a good old fashion really good, mediocre place that litters almost every town in New England. The decor of the place was OK, I was with a coworker so it was fine. Theme he was just a bit weird,no real standards or really anything that jumped out saying I NEED TO TRY THIS. We ordered some egg rolls that tasted weird, some beef lo mien that had no beef, a Mongolian tower that really wasn't a tower but was just OK, on recommendation from the waitress, I ordered the spare ribs, which we didn't finish, it tasted like it had some sort of sesame skin and one other thing that I simply can't remember. It was hard to get the waitress' attention to get another drink and it wasn't that busy.

We had hot 'n sour soup and it was more peppery than spicy. \nI was looking forward to the Shanghai dumplings and they were ok - the skin was a little thick. The other entrees that we ordered were: Steamed seafood pot (variety of seafood was good but noodles were more straw noodle then glass noodle), eggplant tofu mushroom, and Fang's crispy honey steak (steak was tender with a hit of sweetness). Overall, the food was average and oily. Since I was treated to lunch I can't complain about the price - but on my own I probably can't afford to eat Chinese here. \n\nI like the decor - the wall of warrior pictures with Chinese characters was very interesting.

I can say though, that Fangs is some of the best Chinese food I've had in SF.\n\nWe didn't have a reservation for dinner but were promptly seated.

He asked if it was our first time and I told him it was. He then said, \"I'll take care of you\" and I'm like... wow cool. I'm adventurous with food and having the owner pick the dishes is something I enjoy, although it probably isn't for everyone.\n\nWhat came next was a taste sensation. We had a salad that didn't look that impressive but was so yummy (salad in Chinese cuisine is weird to me), wonton soup with a clam (yes a single clam, but to its credit, it was an awesome tasting clam), a wrap with beef, a fish dish and something akin to spare ribs with its meat practically falling off the bone. It was the perfect amount of food with very appealing flavors and outstanding presentation.\n\nAtmosphere is definitely upscale and what I like to call \"cozy\", meaning a little dark.\n\nService is maybe not the most prompt or organized (thinking back, we ordered drinks twice from 2 different waitresses), but they were friendly and I've had worse service in the past.\n\nIn short, I will be back to Fangs soon!", "author": "Sue T."}

We were about 2 hours overdue for dinner, and when we passed this place, we all decided that our journey had finally come to an end. We knew nothing about this place, aside from the fact that it was a modern (almost fusion-esque) Chinese restaurant.\n\nWe were seated and our waitress suggested ordering for the table (seriously, what else would you do at a Chinese restaurant???). She also asked if we'd be all right with her ordering for us. I kind of sensed this would be a mistake (all I could think was that we would end up with the 7 most expensive things on the menu for three people), but we were just tired and hungry enough to agree.\n\nThe food started coming and I have to say that it was all quite good. We ended up with two appetizers: pork dumplings and a beef sandwich (she called them beef buns, but they clearly were not). The beef was tender and flavorful and my only complaint was that the hoisin sauce was laid on just a little to thick.\n\nWe ended up with three main dishes (very surprisingly, they turned out to be among the cheapest options on the menu!): sesame chicken, chow mein, and five spice whitefish. In the end, it was all very tasty. There were a couple of missteps here and there, but nothing that detracted too much from the overall experience. For example, I thought that the sesame chicken could have used a little more sauce; the chow mein noodles were a bit too thick; and the fish they used was a little bland. Even despite these, we all enjoyed our dishes.\n\nOverall, is this a particularly authentic Chinese restaurant? Not even close. But, I can't really judge this place based on that because I don't get the sense that they are trying to be. It's a modern take on some classical dishes that we all enjoyed.", "author": "Jeff L."}

So we know our Chinese cuisine. First, when we asked for the menu, the waitress was reluctant to give it to us. She kept saying that the boss will order everything. After insisting, she gave us the menu. Then, the boss came down and asked us what we like. We told him we eat everything and we would like to have some spicy dishes. He then just took all the menu and said he will handle it. He did not tell us what we were going to get, how much it would cost, or how many dishes. A total of 5 dishes came, which was lesser than what we expected. One of the waiter even threw the dish down. It was so loud that the boss, standing at another table, turned to look.The food was alright. Looking around, EVERYONE in the restaurant had the SAME DISHES that arrived in the SAME ORDER. This was a little alarming. This made me feel like I am in a school cafeteria. None of our opinions counted. We decided to order more. The waiter would not order anything. He had to call the boss again. The boss came down and talked us out of ordering what we wanted. There is no table management at all. Table sitting was disorganized.

He looked upset when we questioned the seafood noodle soup with ONLY two pieces of shrimps in it.\n-Waiter came back with a bowl of noodle covered by crabs and mussels in shell, sea scallops we tasted it sour like some bad seafood), and threw it on the table yelling \" Here is your SEAFOOD noodle soup!\" sounding like he is protesting about us troubling him.\n-After we mentioned that to the owner/Peter, who did not investigate the issue at all, but went straight to yell at guests that \"Sometimes bad customer service is not the waiter's problem, but the guests!\" - This is the most ridiculous words I have heard from anyone who is in the Hospitality industry. As a hotelier, I have to say this guy is such an idiot who is going to loose some good reputation and returning guests.\n -After he found out my friends understand Chinese, so do I, he started to yell in Chinese(with his Shanghainese style, loud and fast, like gun shooting, according to my Chinese friend) and said \" Here we serve food to white people, ok.. We are not some trashy low class Chinese restaurant in Chinatown! If you can not afford it, I will pay for you. Don't make trouble here!\", only because my friend was surprised that he wanted to charge $17 for that dumpster looking seafood noodle soup, which was not exactly what she wanted. How insulting...As a Chinese himself, who also owed House of Nanking in Chinatown, he seemed to look down upon his own people. Even that, I don't think he worship the \"white people\" in his words, but money...how sad!\n\nAfter all this yelling and bad service, we just wanted to pay ( of course the noodle soup is not free) and leave. Even worse, my friend who had the seafood noodle soup actually had food poison later that night. She was joking that they might have spit into her noodle soup to revenge cos we \"troubled\" them...How awful!!\n\nWe will never return to this sad place of course, and just think one step deeper, this owner/Peter might have some moral issue. People who does not respect his own kind, does not respect anything else including himself.

Fang's crispy honey steak with bok choy - super moist yummy barbecue-isque ribs. \n3. Famous nanking sesame chicken - big succulent pieces of chicken that are not too saucy. Best part is the fried sweet potatoes as it is a good unexpected twist. \n4. 8 treasure salad with beef - LOVE the beef, crispy rice noodles, and tangy light taste. This does not even resemble your typical American leafy salads at all.\n5. Fried potstickers with peanut sauce - This wet-fried potsticker wrapper is moist and is one of the better potstickers that I ever had. The peanut sauce was the best part and absolutely delish. This is an excellent alternative to the plain ole boring dry-fried potstickers.\n6. Shanghai fried red bean pancakes - slight sweet and a very traditional pan-fried dessert dish. \n7. Brown rice delight with edamame and king oyster mushrooms - An healthy alternative to fried rice, that I really enjoyed. I may prefer this over fried rice. This is more like saucy moist medley of rice, however, it works as brown rice grains are naturally not that sticky. \n8. Mongolian beef tower - Can't remember how it taste like. So, I'm Switzerland in regards to this dish - it's not a bad thing, but it didn't stand out enough for me to remember it. \n9. Five spice whitefish - not my favorite type of fish, but the sauce is light and tangy. \n10. Eggplant, tofu and mushrooms - it's okay. I hate tofu.\n11. White rice with soy sauce - it's jasmine rice, but my \"white on rice\" loves adored \n\nDrink\nExcellent pricing and taste for the wine. $4 for a glass or $16 for a bottle. It's the exact same stuff that sells for $38/ bottle in Little Italy. Most importantly, it went down smoothly. \n\nService\nThe owner and the wait-staff is super duper accommodating. Made excellent food suggestions, and helped my 100 tipsy guests who wandered all over the place. And they gave me my Chinese take-out boxes, plastic utensils, and soy sauce instantly after I requested them. \n\nDecor\nThis place be fancy. They have legit old style Chinese furniture, and dim lighting for that romantic feel. So, it's perfect for a romantic double date or a long table banquet for 100 of your closest acquaintances. \n\nPrice \nA-okay. It may be a $1 more expensive than Chinese joints in ctown. But Fang-tastic pricing for everything else around. Please be realistic though, we're in SOMA and this place looks 10x better than a hole-in-the-wall. For my little double date, we ordered 4 dishes and a bottle of red wine, it came out to be about $60.", "author": "Mabel Y."}

My gf has been wanting to go to House of Nanking for a while, but every time we walked by, I couldn't let myself do it - too many \"Guey Lo\". So today, my gf and a friend of hers visited from OC and she indicated she doesn't want anything except to eat at Nanking. However, my gf's mom recommended us to go to Fang instead since it is where the owner is at now. So we walked from Nanking to Fang and again almost all tables were occupied by \"Guey Lo\". I gave in and went in. The atmosphere was very pleasing - not overdone, just right. We didn't even look at the menu since we were told to let Chef Fang order for us. He ordered 6 courses which included a soup and two appetizers. Then Chef Fang came by to ask if we had enough. We decided on one more dish. Actually, Chef Fang decided on our behalf.\n\nWe had a light creamy fish soup, stewed-like beef, some kind of tofu thousand year old egg for appetizers. For the main courses we had steamed egg with mussels, beef tenderloin with fried apples, chicken with dried ollves (a play on chicken black bean sauce), and an additional green beans beef with salty fish which Chef Fang cooked himself. For the five of us, the food was more than enough.\n\nTo my surprise, the food was great and authentic as can be. I wouldn't call it fusion as the food and style of cooking is very much Chinese. It has a subtle twist but not too much where you lose the \"homey\" feeling. You know...the type where you go to an asian fusion restaurant that doesn't hit the spot. The sort of place where you spend like $100 bucks, but you still had to go to home to finish off with instant noodles. Well, this place is not like any of those places. I was satisfied and felt complete. And at the same time, I have a new perception that Chinese cooking can maintain its integrity with non-traditional ingredients. Our bill came to $140 with 2 glasses of wine for five people. For comparison, I would come here instead of R&G (which is a typical Chinese place) or Slanted Doors.", "author": "urasso u."}

We have been going to the the related House of Nanking for 20 years and have alway been fans (especially after the meat cleaver/hot wok fight incident - contained to the kitchen so no worries- of the mid 90s - a true \"Tale of the City\" or the time I sat on an upended case of Tsingtao Beer because they ran out of chairs).  Somehow Fang has raised the bar on the food (very hard to do) and on the service (not as hard to do).  First of all a tip for those before they try the food at either place and try to give it a bad rating.  If you order your favorite dish of the same name from another restaurant it's NOT going to taste like what you expect and that is what makes this place special.  The egg drop soup we had was not what your Jewish mother made reservations for on Sunday (tons of ginger and a lemon slice?) but it was fantastic.  Honey beef was crazy good. Oh and you wouldn't normally be expecting peanut sauce on you potstickers.   \n\nOn their service my only complaint about House of Nanking (and it became a running joke that actually became part of the fun of going) was you could never get water.  At Fang they had water on the table and frequently replenished it so 5+ stars for proving it could be done ;-).   Otherwise the dishes came fast but naysayers don't expect them to come in order but again that only conveys freshness and adventure to me.  Fang is about taking your view of the conventional and upending it like that case of Tsingtao Beer and doing it with flair (YES, lemons in egg drop soup).", "author": "Marc I."}

The waitress didn't ever come back to ask, \"How is everything!\" That's alright though.  She is cute and the two young guys next to me were holding her hostage in flirty conversation.

I'm not a huge pork fan so I have to say I didn't try those, but the family polished them off with no problems. The curry was good - I've never tried a curry dish in a Chinese restaurant before and I was pleasantly surprised.  The beef dish was also amazing!!!!!\n\nDessert was good, a pasty with sesame paste, apple and peanut. It was delish. Not at all overwhelming or sweet. Loved it!!!", "author": "Kym P."}

Beautiful decor.\n\nOne observation: When I first tried Fang, the owner offered to order for our group, and we are happy to let him. We were blown-away by what we received -- see the other 5-star reviews to get a sense of it. However, on my second visit, my group ordered from the menu and chose very conventional, tame dishes. Result? We had a rather conventional, ho-hum meal -- better than average, but not toe-curling. \n\nThe moral of the story is to let the staff order your dishes, or, at least, try to walk on the wilder side of the menu if you pick for yourself.", "author": "Todd H."}

We live in SOMA so it's great to have the same great food in our own backyard now. It's especially nice to have it in a roomy environment that is more comfortable than Nanking (though I do miss the quirkiness of the latter!).\n\nWe've been back 3 times, and I can't think of any better Chinese cuisine in San Francisco. I should note that that itself is not much of a compliment, because it's almost like saying \"She's the prettiest girl in Wal-Mart\". I find the dearth of great Chinese food in SF to be completely puzzling, and for years said there was only one great venue in the city for Chinese food (Nanking). Now I can say there is two.\n\nHint: feel free to order off the menu, but don't feel restricted to it. The sesame chicken and the mongolian beef tower are fantastic, as are the hot and sour soup and the melt-in-your-mouth dumpling appetizers. But if Peter is there (and I think he always is), you can always tell him two or three things that you're in the mood for (\"I like noodles, pork and some vegetables\"), and he'll run off and have something unique and wonderful whipped up for you. That's class.", "author": "Robert S."}

Since we had the whole bottom floor to ourselves, I can't speak to the atmosphere or the ambiance or even the service. I can only comment on the food; it's superb.\n\nBelieve you me, real, authentic Chinese food CAN be creative.  The food here is indeed creative. The source of creation here is authentically Chinese; five-spice, ginger-garlic, spicy Siu-Mei sauce. Therefore, the taste is unmistakably Chinese, despite the nouveau mumble jumble garnishing and presentation. \n\nShould you decide to try it out, I recommend that you focus on the taste; break it down.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-14", "description": "I was introduced to Fang when my bosses decided to take everyone in our relatively tiny company out for lunch.  I snuck a peek at the menu online before we left, and I knew I was in for a treat - I have not yet been to House of Nanking, so I was giddy at the opportunity to eat at a restaurant owned by the same chef - totally stoked, in the parlance of our times.\n\nI was certainly not disappointed.  Both times I have been there Peter simply selected our dishes, and we all got a veritable cornucopia of things to share.  What I've found is that they really excel at appetizers.  The first time at Fang we were served their beef Peking buns, which were absolutely amazing - sweet and salty and chewy all in the right ways.  I have since had their fried potstickers in peanut sauce, which are a close second.  Their soups are pretty kickin', too - the broth is very creamy without being too overwhelming, and the dumplings inside are nice and tender.\n\nI have to say that Peter's selections were a little meat-centric for my taste, but every bite of beef, fish, pork, and chicken I had there was really quite tasty.  I liked the Nanking sesame chicken in particular - the sauce had a really rich flavor and the chicken was both crunchy and moist.  Plus, it was served with sweet potato and (I think) winter melon, and I pretty much would have been happy with a bowl of those in that tasty, tasty sauce.  I would also highly recommend the brown rice delight to all of you veggiesaruses - the sweetness of the onions partners well with the pulpiness of the mushrooms, and it definitely feel substantial for a vegetarian dish.\n\nDefinitely no complaints with the service - I know we were a larger group and probably garnered a lot more attention than most just by our sheer size, but both Peter and the servers were on the ball and we never had to wait long for plate upon plate of mouthwatering food.  I snuck a peek at the bill too, and while it was a bit steep for lunch, you can't feed almost 20 people for a better price!  This is particularly notable because we just let them bring us whatever they liked - they had an opportunity to pick more expensive dishes but chose not to, and that gives them some serious points from me.\n\nAll in all, really delicious food and a good overall experience.  I'm planning to go back on my own sometime so I can try some of their lighter fare - but probably not until I recover from the happy food coma induced this time around!", "author": "Becca S."}

I work close by, so I always pass it, curiously peering in through the large windows to take in the modern decor, but I hadn't actually been inside until this past Monday.\n\nHe suggested we dine there, which I quickly agreed to because I trust his culinary judgement.  Shortly after being seated, we were handed menus, though we didn't use them.  The server recited some of that night's specials, and asked if we had an idea of what we wanted to order, or if we trusted her to select the best off the menu based on our like's & dislike's.  Our eyes locked over the table, we both shrugged, and unanimously agreed that we preferred her to order for us.\n\nThey must do some magic back there in the kitchen, because I swear they brought our food out in less than 10 minutes.  However, we were busily catching up after a few months of not seeing each other, so it may have taken longer than that.\n\nFirst to come to the table was the crispy beef with bok choy.  The thin slices of tender beef were battered and fried, and slathered with a thin layer of creamy sauce, much like walnut shrimp.  I was surprised when I bit into the bok choy because it was still crisp.  It had been quickly stir-fried so it retained much of it's rawness, which was actually a nice contrast to the sauteed red onion and basil.\n\nThe other dish was equally tasty, albeit greasy.  King trumpet mushroom with prawns, bits of chopped green bean that were still crisp, and brown rice.  I loved mushrooms, and the prawns were fresh tasting and soft.  What I didn't care for so much was that there was a pool of oil collecting at the bottom of the serving dish.  Other than that, we both enjoyed the dish.\n\nI liked the dining experience, and it definitely makes me want to try House of Nanking, but I think R&G Lounge is still at the top of my list for Chinese food!", "author": "Janet L."}

Took them a few more minutes to get my drink order...which was water! \n\nTen minutes later we finally got someone's attention so we could order food. Peter fang took our order and had trouble understanding what we wanted even though it was on the menu. We waited about ten minutes and got our first order (seasame chicken). It was doused in soy sauce, but decent. \n\nFew more minutes, our second order of noodles came. It was the wrong order as we order beef noodles and they gave us vegetarian. Took a few minutes to hail a waitress down to fix our order. She gladly fixed it and brought it back to us a few moments later. We still had not received our white rice or our last order. \n\nThe last order came and it was again, the wrong order. We called the waitress again knowing she is pissed off at us by now... but this time she seemed confused. She called over Peter Fang and he spoke to me in Chinese and explained that we should just eat what we got because it is delicious. However, it wasn't what we ordered so I asked him to fix it. He seemed pretty ticked off. I mean, for the time we spent waiting....getting the wrong orders...and more waiting, this place did not seem worth the time and price of $60. I still gave a generous tip, but will probably never come here again. \n\nWhen we finally got our last order, it was undercooked, the garlic was raw and all of us got sick that night. \n\nIt is not typical Chinese food.

Peter Fang, the owner and chef, was very helpful with our drink order when I said I wanted to try one of their cocktails, but didn't want a sweet one.  He had the bartender alter one of their existing cocktails to make it just to my liking.  It was good but not great, but hey, kudos for trying!  My mom tried the Pomegranate Margarita, which was fantastic.\n\nThen when we explained that it was our first time here and wanted some recommendations, he asked what we liked...chicken, beef, seafood etc.  When we told him we liked everything, he said \"I will take care of you\".  And that he did.  The food was delicious and it was great being surprised with each course.  He even asked how hungry we were to gage how much food to bring out.  He nailed it all.  Great food and just the right amount.\n\nI liked Fang so much, that I am having my husband's birthday party there next week!\n\nI highly recommend Fang to anyone, especially those living near Potrero Hill who are now missing Eliza's who have closed their doors in our hood.", "author": "liesl l."}

I ordered a medium sized wonton soup with noodles because I caught the flu bug and wanted something soothing to the throat. let me tell you, it was nothing close to soothing whatsoever--not only was it spicy, but it was creamy as well. Sounds delicious but it was below average at best. The noodles were the instant kind you buy at grocery stores and the wontons were questionable regarding its \"homemade\" quality. All in all,  I was quite disappointed with the food and frankly, felt ripped off since this $10 meal cost no more than a $1 to make. They are certainly doing a fantastic job convincing non-Asians that their food is somehow better than the more authentic ones in SF.\n\nService:\n\nThe check came with the meal...and it made me feel very rushed. Presumably this is a more upscale Chinese restaurant and would expect them to operate like one and not a fast food restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-07", "description": "I've been here twice since it opened a couple weeks ago. I still remember randomly walking past the W Hotel, across from Thirsty Bear, and coming across this inviting place with large windows and huge orange-red lantern lights hanging from the ceiling.\n\nThat is until I found out it was the sister restaurant of the notorious \"House of Nanking\". There was a slight moment when my face was still frozen in a smile, while my mind was urging me to excuse myself and run out the door.\n\nBut the key is talking to the head chef who personally oversees parts of the kitchen and makes attempts to greet each guest, make recommendations, and ask how the food tastes. There's an earnestness and passion that he has that's astounding. He explained how he wanted to give his patrons a good dining experience, affordable and approachable chinese food, and huge portions that are easily shared. Something that was hard to do when everyone was squished all up against each other at the original location. \n\nI remember the first time I went,  a separate family was celebrating an engagement with the daughter even coming in wearing a \"House of Nanking\" t-shirt, raving how they'd been fans for years. He gave them a personal tour of the restaurant and even gave them some freebies on the house. \n\nFor the food, it's a mixed bag. I would not recommend the steamed dumplings because the wrappers for the dumplings are store-bought and approx. $9 for six. This is simply because you can get a dozen handmade ones for cheaper around Clement street. The curry chicken is a sort-of Chinese take on the dish (meaning just seasoned with general curry powder) and the chicken texture was a little odd to me because it was tenderized. However the apples and black sesame cabbage was surprisingly tasty with it. The fish was delicious, the pieces quick-fried, lightly spicy, served upon a bed of spinach. Green onion pancakes yummy crispy on outside if not still a bit soggy in the middle. I've had other dishes here but nothing else sticks out.\n\nAs for service, a family next to me was a bit rowdy about the spiciness of the fried rice (?) and how the restaurant should have automatically known to lessen the spiciness of their food because they had children with them. The head chef's response was courteous and quick to defuse the situation. He immediately talked to them and cancelled the dish from their bill, making sure his staff were extra careful not to include any ingredients that could be possibly spicy for the rest of the dishes on the way. But I notice the service is still awkward if he's not the one handling it. Probably because the business is still quite new. \n\nThis place may not be cutting edge or top of the shelf in San Francisco or the Bay Area, but he makes an effort to extend to those that may have only believed Chinese food to be oily sweet and sour pork and lemon chicken, a glimpse of what really is a very, very broad cuisine that I have enjoyed my whole life. \n\nIt is with that in mind, along with his personal enthusiasm and passion, that I give this place 4 stars.", "author": "ChiYan T."}

It isn't often that I crave Chinese food, but the other day, I got a hankering.  After reading a few good reviews, my co-worker and I walked over for a quick lunch.

This was a perfect dish, a little spicy but not so much to prevent me from enjoying the flavor.  \n\n2) My co worker had the Nanking chicken - which while fried was not greasy and had great flavors.  \n\n3) My girlfriend had the hot tea, which was the gorgeous blooming tea ball.  She said it tasted wonderful.\n\n4) Price was incredibly reasonable.  We each paid ~$12 each for a terrific lunch.\n\n5) Most importantly, the place looked and felt clean.

But hey, it's SOMA. And the full bar would be the best sauce for any mediocre menu.\n\nAfter throwing out some ideas, an authoritative gent came by and pared down our choices. We were pleased with the fried calamari, lightly battered dipped in vinegar. But were less enthused about the clamshell beef buns which were grisly and tough. The chicken noodles were greasy and heavy on the black pepper, but super flavorful. While the pea green shoot salad with sweet potato and apple was a unique mix of flavors and definitely a win. \n\nService was attentive, and the eats tasty enough to warrant another lunch hour visit but I would certainly not drop by for dinner unless I was in close proximity.

The first thought before you walk in is why the place is called Fang? I think I'd feel more comfortable if the place were called Fang's or even Peter Fang if that's the idea.\n\nWe were greeted promptly at the door and overall I thought the service was friendly and attentive. We had the Lettuce Wraps, Mongolian Beef, and Sesame Chicken. The portions were huge, especially considering the reasonable prices.  The Mongolian Beef arrived atop 4 inches of fried noodles that seemed like it might have made for an interesting presentation in theory, but it was a bit of a mess in practice.  The Lettuce Wraps were good and included a lot of unusual ingredients including peas, tomatoes, and basil.  And finally, the Sesame Chicken was probably the best dish we had and came with some sweet potatoes and fruit slices.  If I go back, I'd probably order something like the steamed dumplings to balance out all the sweetness in the other dishes.", "author": "Vivek P."}

On a friday night my friends and I were down in SOMA and wanted to get some food.  Roland C. suggested fang because he came by here once and enjoyed it.  We walked in with no reservation and the place looked packed.  Luckily they had a downstairs which was pretty spacious.  The decor downstairs was definitely not a nice and trendy as the upstairs.  It was simple and looked like any chinese restaurant compared to the darkly lit upstairs with fancy lights and loungy atmosphere.\n\nThe owner came down and greeted us.  He asked us in chinese if we understood him and then which dialect we speak.  After a little convo, he told us he's a chef and if we trust him, he'll put together some things for us.  Why not right?  While waiting for the food, we started out with some drinks.  They were strong, but pretty tiny.  Considering they weren't too pricey, I guess it made sense, just a bit surprised tho.\n\nFirst dish to come out was a scallop appetizer.  Yum.  Then came a squid dish that was interestingly tangy, but I couldn't stop myself from eating it.  Then some peking duck came out.  In the bun and ready to eat.  We had some sesame chicken which was good but probably the least favorite dish on the table.  We had a spicy beef dish and a noodle dish with shrimp still in the shell.  There was something else but I can't remember it for the lfe of it.  Everything about the food was stuff we've eaten before but it all had a slightly different twist on the taste.  \n\nService was sporadic with many people coming around to help, but they took care of everything we needed.  The cost was not bad for the amount of food we got, but a bit more expensive than a typical chinese restaurant.  Overall, the experience was good and the owner definitely knew what would make us happy.\n\nI'll be back.", "author": "Tom Y."}

You definitely won't be disappointed with your experience here...the decor is classy and yet preserves an ancient Chinese charm with a twist. The background music is also carefully selected. At least from the time I was there, they had old Chinese classics mixed with a modern beat. Totally goes with the food. \n\nI was dining there with 3 other girlfriends one night. Peter came up to us and went through the routine of asking us how hungry we were and if we had any food allergies. Don't go off the menu here. If you're somewhat adventurous, definitely trust the chefs to surprise you. \n\nOur appetizers were these FATTY scallops seasoned with sweet soy sauce and green onions. It was THE biggest scallop I've ever seen in my life. Later on, Peter told us that he had hand selected these scallops from a special place. (I don't remember the details, so let's just call it \"special\") There were 3-4 more courses that were brought to our table throughout the night. Everything was amazing. \n\nOne interesting observation we made was that this is the first Chinese restaurant that I've been to where they bring the dishes out one by one. It's all family style, but they don't bring out the next until you're almost through with what you're having. I don't particularly mind it, although it doesn't allow for my variation during your courses. We were stuff by the time our last course was brought to us. But it was delicious, so we stuff ourselves silly. \n\nDefinitely highly recommend this place.

I don't know what it is, but there's just a lot of very small things that bring the overall rating to maybe like a 4.4, for which I have to round down.\n\nIf you come here, expect to possibly be greeted by the owner Peter Fang (chances get higher if you bring a big group) himself whereupon he will possibly take it upon himself to order food for your table. Of course, you could always refuse but he's very nice to see him take a personal touch with his customers! On the slower nights, he may even sit with your group and talk with your table, although as word gets out about this place, those slower nights get harder and harder to find.\n\nWhen most people think Chinese in SF, they think Chinatown. Definitely good eats (at most places) but not much in the style department. Fang has them all outclassed with its stylish interior. This is a place you do not need to be embarrassed about bringing a date to.\n\nAs for the food, there are so many great dishes here I don't know where to start. I definitely recommend the noodle dishes, I don't think I've had any more flavorful noodles anywhere else. Definitely grab an order of the squid and sesame chicken dishes as well. I think the main strength at Fang is that everything is not what you would expect from a Chinese place. It's all fancy twists on classic Chinese favorites.\n\nService is attendant and friendly, so no issues there. Why the -1 star? I think the drink I was served did not justify the price (not nearly enough) and sadly, I think the prices could be a *little* bit better.

I know it's a Chinese place so I wasn't expecting French Laundry service but we had to wait 10 minutes to get water and another 10 to get our cocktails.  Finally when everyone was done eating, we had to wait almost 15 minutes to flag down the waitress (who walked by multiple times but averted her eyes) to get the check.\n\nDecor: nicer than the average Chinese place but nothing special.\n\nOverall, a lackluster experience.  May try it again if someone drags me here or maybe I'll just get some hot and sour soup to go.", "author": "Maxine S."}

I've been to House of Nanking a number of times, which has the same owner, and I've almost always been really pleased by the food.\n\nFrom what I saw on Fang website the restaurant was more upscale than House of Nanking.  I expected the food to be as good, if not better than Nanking, and great service.\n\nThe owner came by to take our order and when we said we weren't ready he told us to take our time. He later came back and took our order. He was a very nice gentleman, but that was the last we saw of him.\n\nWhen the food came out everything looked great; taste was not so great. We had ordered Wonton Soup, Shanghai Dumpling, House Chow Mein, Spicy Eggplant, and Seasme Chicken.\n\nWonton soup taste like a cross between Vietnamese congee and something else. The traditional wonton soup flavor was not there.\n\nShanghai dumplings themselves were ok, bu I've had better. The accompanying dipping sauce was on the sweet side. I like how they went with the black sauce rather than the red vinegar shortcut.\n\nThe eggplant, chicken, and chow mein were all too salty. They all tasted like the contained the same \"base\" sauce and then modified.\n\nThe eggplant had too much black bean sauce making it the saltiest of the dishes. Chow mein gets a plus for the noodles being homemade, but that too was salty. The crispy seasme chicken is a popular dish at House of Nanking and is amazing there, but at Fang it did not compare.\n\nSERVICE\nAfter the owner took our order there was virtually no more service.  I asked a waitress if i could get more water (my glass was completely empty) and she said \"sure\".  She walked away and started doing something else, so I asked someone else for water and got it.\n\nI later asked the same waitress for togo boxes. She said \"sure\", proceeded to the kitchen, came back and started cleaning another table (there were few patrons at the time). I ended up asking someone else for the boxes.\n\nAs soon as a credit card got pulled out, the waitress was back in a flash to get it and returned it to us in record time. What a turn off! Ignore all our previous requests and as soon as we get ready to pay you're going to be fast?!", "author": "Dennis Z."}

Which took me by surprise because this is the sister restaurant of House Of Nanking (which it does not mean anything, since I heard not very good stories about this other place either). But, Fang looked such a beautiful place (at least the website makes it look nice) that my friends and I decided to try it. Upon arrival we could see that the Chef/owner Peter Fang was there taking the orders from each and every table that came in to the restaurant, and then he had his food runners delivering and serving the food. We thought what can go wrong? But, boy we all were wrong. \n\nTo start you get paper napkins not real cloth napkins (huge turn off). Now beginning with service, which by the way all staff seemed very confused and not knowing what was going on. It took literally more than 15 minutes to get the attention of the staff to place a drink order... not to mention the food order which we had to wait another twenty minutes or so, finally the owner came by the table; as we were about to let him know about our the order (By this time we were really hungry) He turned away to attend another employee's needs and left us for a few more seconds (what on earth?) then, I guess, he went and post the order to the kitchen. A few minutes later he came back asked us if we wanted to move to another table; and I should admit a much comfortable table (that was nice!) This whole ordeal was so odd. Finally the food started to arrive at the table. \n\n\n-Fried Potstickers, sesame sauce \n-Steamed Pork Dumplings, chili blackbean \n-Hot and Sour Soup chicken or tofu \n-5 Five Spice Whitefish, jade spinach and caramelized red peppers \n-Fang's BBQ pork spareribs, marinated in garlic and honey \n-Cooling Lettuce Wrap, served w/ diced zucchini, peas, pineapple, tomatoes, onions, crispy rice noodle (pork) \n-White Rice, large bowl \n+_ one other item that I can't even recall \n\nIn short, the food is average and expensive (for the amount of food you get) nothing really to remember about this place. Plus the absence of service is a bad business combination. By the way, there is another long wait to get your check. We are definitely never returning to this place.", "author": "Ernesto C."}

The food was all \"interesting\" and seemed to try to combine together tastes in unusual ways.  In the end, I don't think it quite worked for us, so we left pretty disappointed.\n\nWe started with fried potstickers in peanut sauce plus hot and sour soup.  The potstickers were OK, but sort of an odd combination of tastes.  The hot and sour soup was a good combination of sour and spicy, but again with an unusual collection of ingredients (zucchini and chick peas among them). \n\nFor the main course we had the mongolian beef tower and the five spice white fish.  Again, these dishes seemed to be made to explore unusual combinations of tastes.  I found the mongolian beef to be a bit sweet and I didn't think it went that well with the cabbage and crispy rice noodles.  The five spice fish really did taste strange to me - spinach, balsamic vinaigrette, steamed fish and at least two other \"flavors\".\n\nAfter leaving, we decided that what we had really been looking for was a good Chinese restaurant that served Chinese-style Chinese food.

As we feared there was quite a line, with a 20 -40 minute wait. And we were hungry. So we took note of the sign in the window advertising their \"Sister Restaurant\" Fang on Howard . A quick call there for directions and an assessment of wait time helped us decide it was worth the walk .\n\nWhat a FANTASTIC decision that was !\n\nLike several other reviewers, we were greeted by Peter Fang, who described himself as the chef, not the owner . Always nice to see pride in one's work. He listened to our story just a bit and then took our menus saying he would take care of us. Mission Accomplished . Creative and delicious food, a great assortment, and enough to leave us pleasantly full  with some to take home. Price was less than I expected as well.\n\nMr Fang also came by several times during the meal to check on us, to chat, to tell us a couple of funny stories. And on hearing the bathrooms were a bit unkempt, headed off himself to rectify the situation.\n\nPeter Fang, thank you for providing a warm.gracious, and delicious alternative to our initial selection. Thank you for making our meal memorable with your choices and personal attention.\n\nFang is in easy walking distance of Moscone , Metreon , Financial District   I will be taking my crew there for lunch and will look into the availability for our Christmas Party .

We had a reservation for 5 on Saturday night, which seemed like a good thing when we arrived as it was pretty packed. As others have commented, we were asked if we were ok allowing them to choose our food for us, which we were. They noted any allergy issues or preferences such as meat vs seafood.\n\nWe were served a shrimp salad, which none of us would had ever ordered on our own......it was heavy on garlic, but delicious nonetheless. Next up what could only be described as an open-face steamed bun. I've seen them served with bbq pork at dim sum places, but ours had sliced beef and veg.....again, delicious. We also had sesame chicken, beef chow mein and bbq pork ribs. All excellent. There was one dud plate at the end. Some kind of beef cubes fried in flour so it had a kind of crispy outside. Definitely the least favorite plate of the night, but not inedible!\n\nOur check listed \"Open Food\" for 5 people @ $140 plus our assorted beverages. Not as cheap as Nanking, but definitely a more upscale environment. Worth going back to!", "author": "Sean O."}

We did not have a conventional menu. The owner asked if it was our first time there and asked if there was food that we could not eat.

They said chinese, and I guess I have not encountered may up scale chinese places.  I guess I'm more used to a dim sum or bbq duck in the window type of place.  Ambience was great.  The decor is nice to look at while waiting for food or just to chat about.  The wait staff was very attentive- they noticed when somebody was done with their beer and asked if they wanted more, they put down jars of water with mint (though we didn't know if they were table centerpieces or for drinking at first), and they asked if the kids needed something different.  Only thing is the seating was a bit on the cramp cozy side and we were all moving around, but I was with large family, so not that big of a deal.\n\nSo apparently, the family members that invited everybody, just came in and said we're hungry, some people are vegetarian, and then let the chef/kitchen choose what it wanted to serve to us.  Cool concept.  They chef, a white haired chinese man, was visible and active throughout the whole experience. Apparently he's the same guy that started Nanking (that's what i was told).  I was just going with the flow, but here's what we had (not proper names of dishes, but I just recorded what I thought it was):\n\nGarlic seafood rice\ngreen pea wonton and bbq duck steamed bun\nfried salt and perpper calamari in a vinegar-milk sauce\nbraised sweet pork ribs\nfish w/ mix greens\nhoney apple beef (kinda like walnut prawns)\nsasame chicken w/ sweet potato\nchicken lettuce wraps\n\nand then for dessert we had:\npears in a sweet red wine or sesame pearl in a ginger broth\ncookie (kinda short breadish, kinda polvoron-ish)\n\nI might have missed something cause it was a ton load of food.  Like a chinese wedding with hella courses.  But we all definitely got our fill, though some didn't get to taste the later courses because they filled up on the earlier dishes.

While in San Francisco on vacation we asked the concierge at our hotel where to go for chinese food.  Instead of sending us to Chinatown, he sent us to Fang. It was a short Uber ride from the hotel.  When we got there it was in a neighborhood with not much going on, most likely busier during the day.  All the tables were taken and the wait was about 20-30 minutes.  That was fine for us.  The staff kept apologizing for the wait, not necessary.  Fang's also has an open kitchen concept which we love, nothing to hide. When we sat down we ordered drinks and began looking at the menu.  A few minutes later an older gentleman came over, Mr. Fang. He asked if we had been before. When we told him we have not, he immediately took our menus and said I will order for you.  Now that could be dangerous and risky, but not at Fang. One by one the family style dishes came out. Braised pork belly in a steamed dough pita type pocket, ribs, none of which Mr. Fang would tell us the marinade!  Delicous.  Then a shrimp and sesame chicken dish, but cooked with crispy apples, something we've never seen but incredible.  Over all I would have to say one of the best.

The waiter suggested a dish they did not have on the menu and it was excellent.\n\nI was with a vegan eater and both her and I (devout carnivore) had quite a selection that we could choose from. I ordered the Hot and Sour Soup which was good, and had a touch of lemon to it so it was brighter than most versions of the soup I have had. I also had the fried pot-stickers that came with a peanut sauce drizzled on them they were excellent and I would have happily made an entire meal out them. For my entree I had the non-menu item of tempura shrimp and apples. Yes apples deep fried with the shrimp in a nice sauce that did not over power the tastes of either of ingredients, it was awesome and I recommend it to anyone going there. I also had hot tea, which you might think is natural but this was termed flower in a glass which is what it was, when the water had steeped the proper amount of time the tea \"puck\" was a beautiful flower with other herbs in the clear glass, tasted great and looked great.\n\nI know there are a million Asian restaurants in the bay area and I will not pretend to know even a fraction of them but if like me you are usually near the convention center in a town and looking for great meal then head on over to Fang, I think you will be very happy with that choice.", "author": "kevin g."}

My aunt, uncle and I were ushered slowly into the basement dining room despite our reservation.  It seemed as if there were more reservations than tables available.  Once we were seated, we were generally ignored and our food tended to be flung at our table.  This is billed as a more high-class Chinese establishment and not the local lunch special dive, so please treat us as such.  As for the food, I was pleased with a few dishes but underwhelmed by most.  The bao was almost more sandwich than bun and along with some sweet shrimp and fried apple dish were the best componets of the meal.  There were spare ribs, but the meat was overly greasy, and chicken potstickers, but those were tasteless.  A plate of fried calamari also appeared on our table, but the batter was loose and tasted like the dish was reheated.  Luckily, I didn't pay, but my uncle was shocked at the bill compared to both the quality and quantity of food we were served.  Not making a return visit.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

I was overwhelmed with the numerous huge slices of sweet potato. For a moment, I thought they forgot to put in my sesame chicken! It turns out, the \"chicken\" was at the bottom.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-10", "description": "Well check this place out. Apparently the higher-end Chinese place is becoming a new trend in SF dining, and why not? Fang certainly is a welcome addition to the downtown dining scene, and I look forward to seeing how it matures. The food was quite good all around and the prices were very reasonable for the setting.\n\nWhen dining there on a Tuesday night, my friend and I were greeted with a fairly empty restaurant and, who'da guessed, but Mr. Fang himself. He was very welcoming and congenial, asking if we'd been to his famous House of Nanking before. He offered some helpful (albeit unsolicited, but we were the better for them) suggestions on what to order. \n\nWe tried two of the speciality cocktails... My Nanking Sunrise was refreshing and tasty. My friend ordered a martini with honey and dates that was far too sticky-sweet to really enjoy. \n\nFor appetizers, we had the fried pot stickers and onion cake. The pot stickers were perfectly cooked and delish. The onion cake was, whoa, definitely an onion cake. Like, wow... there be ONIONS in there. But it was pretty good nonetheless. \n\nOn Mr. Fang's recommendation we tried the five-spice whitefish, which was actually quite good. It came perfectly cooked and lightly breaded, with a light flavor and a peppery punch at the end. The Mongolian beef tower (which didn't seem like much of a \"tower\" in presentation, so I was a bit lost there) was delicious as well, wish a rich, complex flavor I've rarely experienced in other Mongolian beef dishes. \n\nAside from the hit-or-miss cocktails, where Fang really fell flat was in the service. Granted the place has just recently opened, but it was a bit of a trial trying to get someone to help us (or our bill) when needed. In fact, it was never really clear who our server was as several lost-looking staff members seemed to just wander around. I hope this would gets worked out as time goes on, because the food is certainly worth coming back for. \n\nI'd imagine Fang's obvious competition is Heaven's Dog, which is not too far away. While Heaven's Dog does offer a more solid cocktail pedigree, Fang is where I'll be coming back when I want some tasty, more \"upscale\" Chinese cuisine.", "author": "Aaron L."}

The place was full of happy looking diners and we were excited that maybe we've finally found a great Chinese food place in SF.  Boy were we wrong...\n\nFood: we ordered the beef Peking bun and duck Peking bun, wonton soup, brown rice,  sesame chicken, salt and pepper shrimp (which we found out later was actually Szechuan shrimp), and peashoots. The Peking buns were okay. The beef tasted greasy and was overwhelmingly seasoned and the duck was on the fattier side and didn't seem to have enough seasoning. If you've had Chairman buns, these aren't at all good in comparison. The wonton soup was forgettable and served as a way to wash down the buns. The sesame chicken was overly and weirdly tangy and made me wince with my first bite-too sweet and too sour. The Szechuan shrimp is a really odd dish. The shrimp had very little shrimp flavor and was quite bland. I thought it was weird that parts of the shrimp were warm while others were cold and then I realized the cooked shrimp was sitting on a bed of very cold cucumber slices which made the dish inconsistently lukewarm. The pea shoots were my favorite, but I had to stop eating it towards the end of my meal because it overwhelmingly garlicky. The dish is typically made with lightly wok fried garlic, but tasted almost raw in this dish. My bf and I couldn't wait to get home to brush our teeth and even then I went back and brushed my tongue multiple times to get rid of the garlic taste.\n\nService: the staff was friendly, although young and inexperienced. My server read me back my order to confirm, but we somehow ended up with Szechuan shrimp instead of the salt and pepper shrimp we ordered. We didn't know we got the wrong thing until our bill came because the dish was just dropped off at the table without an explanation.\n\nAmbiance: We were seated by the wall and squeezed in between a couple of diners (the tables were really close together). Typical of SF restaurants but with all the minuses, it just adds to the negatives about this place. The pacing of the food was really odd. We got the buns really fast and the soup came before our second bite of the buns. The peashoots and brown rice came a few minutes later, but the sesame chicken and shrimp didn't come until 15 minutes later when the rice and peashoots were already cold. I'm sure they would've re-warmed our food if we wanted them to, but really it shouldn't have happened in the first place.\n\nOverall, the food is really the driving factor for the two star review and \"Eh, I've had better\" is about right.", "author": "Trinh N."}

I saw this place a few weeks ago walking to happy hour. It looked so cute and adorable and a welcome addition to the neighborhood that really hasn't seen too many new restaurants lately. I work a few blocks away so I'm always craving new places to go. \n\nI went with two business colleagues. When we got there the hostess greeted us nicely, but then there was all this confusion between her, another elderly woman and elderly man who all worked there trying to figure out where we should go. We finally got to our table in a disheveled shuffle amongst us and the staff. \n\nOnce seated, a woman came to take our drink order. The drinks are very unique and a nice change from your normal teas. Then some old man; I think he said he was the owner. At least that's what we got through the broken English. He said \"You share?\" We said yes and then he said \"I take of you. Don't worry. I'm a chef.\" and walks away! LOL. I'm adventurous and am always up for letting the chef choose course, especially when sharing. But don't just tell us you're gonna do that and not ask us. \n\nThe dishes themselves were just.. off. The soup was unbalanced. The shrimp was OK, nothing special. The beef over fried rice noodles was in this gloppy gravy type sauce that made me want to gag. Then this dish that we all thought was chicken (turned out to be fish) was bland and boring. Then within 5 minutes after eating, my stomach started turning and I had to get up and go to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up. I was seconds from vomiting but was able to pull myself together, sprinkle some water on my face, and make it back to the table. Let's walk back to the office! \n\nOh, did I mention that not once did anyone ask if we wanted more drinks when we were sitting there with empty glasses like idiots! I don't know about this place.

This place has it all!\n\nIts also one of the few places around SOMA that are good for groups. It is reasonably close to the office area and is a very popular lunch spot. The guy who owns it is the same guy who owns 'House of Nanking' another awesome chinese place in North Beach. Although Fang is better in terms of ambiance and service and is also not as cramped as its sister branch\n\nOk now to the food - my favorite here is the white fish! Its just mouthwatering! Not spicy and it just melts in your mouth like butter. Another favorite is the good old Sesame chicken. Onion cakes for appetizer and wonton soup and you will go home as one happy person :) \nAlso, if its your first time, feel free to ask your server to help you out. They are generally really nice and almost accurate interms of how much you need to order. Same goes for big groups. You can just tell them what your group likes and what they don't - the management will figure out what you should order and in how much quantities.\n\nI deducted one star because they don't have a lot of options. The menu is limited. Although I am not really complaining :)\n\nHave fun there! I promise you will go back! :)", "author": "Chitra G."}

The food was good.  In fact, two out of our three dishes were really lovely.  So was the service, though I felt a little rushed, almost as if they were anxious to close the kitchen at 8:30 pm.  Fang's interior resonated as an organized business lunch spot, so that may be part of the reason, lunch being perhaps the emphasis.  I chose it as a first date spot:  a hot girl requiring a hint of hip, an amp of ambiance, and enough decor to say I was interested but not desparate.  Fang got it done for me.  I'd go for lunch anytime, first dates with Asian girls probably.

You would think I'd give it 5 stars but here's my story.  I ordered take out on Saturday night and loved it so much I went back with my family on Sunday for lunch.  Food was again great!  I even went up to the front counter of the restaurant and grapped a couple of biz cards so I can give to friends.  My 7 and 5 year old girls weren't crazy about it so they asked me to order them some Chow Mein.  It took some time to find an available server to take our order so I just got up and asked the hostess if  I could order a dish and she asked me to order it from a Waiter.  I sat back down and waited and about a few minutes later a waiter did take my order.  \"I think\"\nI asked if I could order some Chow Mein and he looked at me and walked away.  Not sure if he was going to order it for me I watched him go back to the kitchen.  Again, not sure if he's ordering it for me.  The hostess approached me later and asked if I ordered my Chow Mein.  I said to her \"Yes, I think.\"  She asked, \"who did you order it from?\"  I said, \"I think I ordered it from him.\"  So I asked the waiter, \"Excuse me sir, did you order my Chow Mein?\"  He gives me a dirty look and said, \"Yeah.\"\nI said thanks.  The hostess left and that was it.  So I thought.  A few seconds later the waiter yells at me and says, \"Believe me!!!\"  Meaning I should have trusted him that he took my order.   What the f*&# is that all about?  Since when does the wait staff yell at customers?  I asked my wife to take the girls and leave so I could take care of the situation.  At this point I'm going to cancel my order and just pay for my bill and get the hell out.  Lost my appetite...lost my respect for this place.  I approached the owner if I could just cancel my order and as I was asking him my noodles came out of the kitchen.  I said can you just wrap this up because I'm getting out of here.  He asked why and I just told him his waiter is rude and a ass.  He asked which waiter and I pointed to the guy.  The owner just said he's probably just having a bad day.  He said most people think he's nice.  What the F%$K?  That's going to be his answer to me?  He's probably just having a bad day?  I'm out!

It was the perfect beginning to dinner.

The Five Spice white fish is exactly as described- tender, moist, melt in your mouth fish with a sauce that's not overpowering and really nice with the jade spinach.

Or perhaps the hotel staff just has a list of relatively palette- neutral restaurant choices that are flexible enough to appeal to the largest pool of out-of-town guests.  I say this because, in a city full of ethnic diversity and gastronomical experimentation, this is nothing more than a slightly-above-par Chinese restaurant, and will not \"wow\" even a modestly curious eater.\n\nAbsolutely everything is doused in oil, which you can see on the food but becomes glaringly obvious when you get to the bottom of the clean, white dish and find a puddle of shiny orange oil.\n\nMy date got the Mongolian beef tower, which was more veggies and crunchy rice crackers than actual beef.  It did, however, have a nice spice kick to it.\n\nI ordered the lettuce wraps, and these were admittedly the least-greasy offering of the evening.  Four iceberg leaves were provided to accompany a minced pile of chicken, veggies, pineapple, and other filler-items.  The chicken filling was a bit greasy as well, but less so than my date's belt-busting dish. \n\nThe waitstaff is cool, disconnected, and rushed.  As expected, we were shuffled in, hurried to order, and rushed out to turn the table in the small dining room crowded with a few too many two-tops to be a comfortable experience.

Come on guys, hop to.\n\nAlright, now for my thoughts on the place itself:\nAmbiance - High end, well decorated. Definitely not the hole in the wall image House of Nanking is known for.\nFood - Good stuff. Ordered the green beans (4.5 stars), whitefish (5 stars), hot & sour soup (4 stars), eggplant (3.5 stars) and lettuce wraps (4.3..that's right I said 3, stars). Overall, solid flavors, enjoyable meal. \nService - Very fast. Only quirk would be the owner who takes it upon himself to order what he thinks is best. Not good for a group of 4 OCD girls and also not good when you haven't asked them enough questions to see what they like. That said, I respect his confidence, clearly it's been well earned from Nanking and to be honest I would have trusted him in knowing what we liked simply from his 25 years of experience. \nCost - Granted we didn't order alcohol (rough weekend..and by rough I mean awesome) but the bill came out to $20/each for 4 people. Pretty good deal given the quality of food, ambiance and service. \n\nDefinitely check this place out. Fellas, good first date option since you won't have to drop a pretty penny and will still get props for a great find.  Give this place a go. It'll be worth the trip.", "author": "Shreya C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-20", "description": "The Cantonese fusion at Fang had several of us saying WOW at the first bite and savoring each subsequent one.  I went with a group of 11 globe-trotting foodie friends and most of us were highly impressed with the cooking.  Decor is upscale, hip and pretty.  We went fairly early on a weeknight so got good attention.  We let  chef/owner Peter Fang order for us, just as we had done at his other restaurant House of Nanking just outside of Chinatown.  BTW House of Nanking is very good, but with a somewhat different fusion style.\n\nRegarding cooking style, this is not purely traditional Chinese, and it's not Americanized Chinese.  It's mostly Cantonese fusion with a California cuisine influence in lighter, subtler flavors and very fresh ingredients.  Anyone who is expecting to be blasted with seasonings or frankly doesn't have a somewhat sophisticated and sensitive palate may not \"get it\".  Properly done, Chinese food has always been about combining a variety of subtle flavors into a balanced whole.  Usually this is done by extracting spice and sauce flavors in a very hot wok, converting and combining them through heat, and infusing them into the main ingredients during the main cooking.  All this is done in a very few minutes per dish.  At Fang this was achieved with excellent execution, tasteful style choices, and a superb overall result.\n\n(BTW, it's much harder to blend sublime flavors and get the tenderness and texture perfect than it is to over-season and over-cook the familiarly bad Chinese food so unfortunately prevalent in much of America that doesn't have a large, sophisticated, demanding Chinese audience.   I'm frankly surprised and a bit saddened that some of the other reviewers did not enjoy the fine work at Fang as much as we did.  I hate to sound condescending in saying that they may not know any better.  Fang has taken Chinese cuisine in a fresh, new and delicious direction.)\n\nWe had maybe 7 or 8 courses.  Most memorable dishes included an incredibly tender and perfectly seasoned calamari with a milk and hot oil dipping sauce, battered Mongolian steak filet cubes that were perfectly tender and subtly spiced, an excellent whitefish with spinach and roasted red bell peppers that had an unusual and subtly flavored (fruit reduction?) sauce, a good shiu loong bao, and an OK Beijing duck and wonton appetizer.\n \nThe tab per person was well under $40 including some beers, which was almost half the price of an excellent but vastly less creative steak house the night before.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-20", "description": "Here's your chance to try probably the best Chinese food in San Francisco.  I believe I can speak with some authority here. My fianc\u00e9e' is Chinese and we have crisscrossed the bay trying virtually every Chinese restaurant of note within 75 miles. But way too much about us...Peter Fang, the owner of Fang, also started House of Nanking.  If you've been there or heard about it, forget everything you know about it when you consider Fang.  Personally, I really like House of Nanking, but it is a specific experience.  The brusque waiters, the strong flavors, and the heavy handed suggestions probably based on what is cooking at the time are all part of the fun.  The food is very tasty if not classically Asian.  My Cantonese fianc\u00e9e' didn't enjoy House of Nanking as she felt the flavors we just too bold, but the lines of Caucasian customers and tourists from around the world prove that Mr. Fang nailed the formula for this San Francisco institution on the edge of Chinatown even if it doesn't pack in people from the closest neighborhood.\n\nFang is another story all together.  The staff is very helpful in guiding you through this unique culinary experience. This is Peter Fang's crowning achievement, and it is just getting started. Tonight I brought a group of tough customers there, my fianc\u00e9e's extended family, and they loved it.  True to the Cantonese palate, they thought some of the dishes were a little bit too salty, but every dish left the table empty so this default response may not be quite accurate. Having been there multiple times recently, I had a chance to talk with the owner.  His goal is to bring together flavors from all over China into what could really be called Chinese Fusion.  Mr. Fang would bristle at the term \"Fusion,\" but I mean this is the best sense of the term.\n\nIn general, Americans have a very limited understanding of the breadth of Chinese cuisine.  Food in China is amazingly diverse and the fringes are fantastic to explore.  To have an equivalently diverse meal in China, be prepared to board several flights and travel at least 3000 miles by the time you get to desert.  Add to this subtle western concepts that take this menu to a whole new level of WOW.\n\nStarting at the start, a visit here is not complete without trying the mouth watering calamari. This is unlike any calamari I have ever had anywhere - lightly breaded, slightly spicy, tender, and very meaty without a hint of fishiness.  Also available are xiao long bao known to some Americans as soup dumplings.  Most restaurants achieve the \"soup\" by packing the shell with greasy pork. The \"soup\" is actually melted fat from the meat. Not so here. Inside the xiao long bao is lean pork and vegetables and carefully inserted delicious soup broth. This starter is indicative of the attention to detail in every dish.\n\nNext up - raw bok choy salad.  Fang uses fresh and tender baby bok choy with an amazing dressing that is tangy and spicy.  It was fun to watch the assembled group tonight try to figure this one out.  Dismissing this initially a \"gui lo\" salad (salad for white people), the large plate was quickly vacuumed clean.\n\nWe next had scallops the size of a silver dollar served in individual bowls served in a marinade of soy, green onion, ginger, and secret spices. Personally, I am not a fan of scallops. I find that they are often bland and overcooked. These are refreshingly light, and perfectly seasoned and sliced in a way that takes scallops to a completely new level. I am pretty sure all scallops I will ever eat will be compared to these.\n\nI realize I am waxing on here, so I am going to give you a quick tour of some of the other amazing dishes at Fang.  Soup here is break though.  Savor the broth that takes at least 5 hours to make.  The flavor is complex and rich while still offering the lightness that even the most demanding Cantonese diner will appreciate. \n \nFantastic mains include the sesame chicken this is perhaps the only dish borrowed from the House of Nanking, but taken to a whole new level of refinement.  The whole fish with crispy garlic is melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  I am not generally fond of game birds, but the quail here is crispy, meaty, and so delicately flavored.  Whole steamed shrimp with rice rolls showcases great subtle Cantonese cooking.  Finally, the noodles at Fang have the consistency of fresh made pasta and are served with unique toppings and sauces that will make you question just what it is that you've been eating elsewhere.\n\nI should also compliment the great service here.  Empty dishes magically vanish and used plates are replaced between courses, water and tea are seamlessly replenished, and the food arrives just when you would expect it should.\n\nIt's hard to sum up such a great find, but I'll give it a try.  If you don't have the time to tour all over China composing the best of Chinese cooking into a meal, I suggest you start you culinary tour at Fang.  I guarantee you'll be a frequent flyer.", "author": "Ken P."}

Considering the high quality of the food I would say the price point is pretty good value.", "author": "Julia G."}

The tofu with eggplant and mushrooms in black bean sauce is absolutely delicious.  The green tea with gogi berries was a revelation:  those floating, red berries soften up nicely in the tea and are pleasant and tasty to chew.  The lettuce wraps, served in the form of stir-fry surrounded by iceberg lettuce leaves, are less successful, because the lettuce is too stiff to wrap around the filling.  All in all, the food was tasty but a bit greasy.  Fang's biggest drawback is dirt:  every  water glass was spotted and greasy, the votive candle holders looked disgusting, and I found a hair in my food.", "author": "Diana B."}

We had an early reservation: 6:30 and so were graced by the gentleman who I believe is Mr Fang .. very fit with snow white hair.  I knew that the best dining experience at Fang was to give him full rein .. so we said, whatever you recommend is fine with us.  He asked about food allergies etc. and then the food began arriving.  Wonderful pumpkin soup with a surprise succulent meatball at the bottom.  Honeyed shrimp with apple bits as a garnish.  Peking beef buns like sliders married dim sum.  Another beef dish that I didn't catch the name of but ground cubed beef with gentle spicing similar to five spice then deep fried so crisp but not fatty with tender bok choy.  Slim white fish like a cod in wonderful sauce and something like delicate large spinach leaf garnish (by this time I'm no longer paying any attention to the names .. it's all about the food.)\n\nBottom line: the best Chinese influenced meal I've ever had.  Great service and timing of the arrivals of each dish.  Mr Fang would float by with a questioning look and we would give him big grins and literally thumbs up.  It is modern Chinese .. no rice, minimalist and great ingredients and treatment.  This is now my goto place for special treats for friends.  I think arriving early before the crowd hurly burly may be a key.  I will remember Mr. Fang and his wonderful restaurant and hope he remembers me for my next meal there.", "author": "lynn s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-27", "description": "As you can tell from the pictures of Fang, this is no \"hole-in-the-wall\" traditional Chinese restaurant.  It's very chic and 'upscale' place with the cook stations visible to the diners.  This place is very dimly lit and can be loud with the background music.  Anyway, this is a typical pan-Asian Fusion restaurant catered to folks who want the non-authentic, but clean and sterile Chinese restaurant experience.  You will not see any of the older Chinese family crowd here that you would in the more homely Chinatown restaurants.\n\nWe went on a Wednesday evening (with reservation for 5) at around 7pm and were promptly seated.  Before we had the chance to go through the menu, Peter Fang cam to the table and asked us what we would like. After telling him that this was our first time and we had no idea yet, he immediately took the menus away from us and proclaimed that he would order for us and we should just sit back and wait for the feast.  Unfortunately, I cannot recall all the dished he brought out, but they were good.  Overly salted to accommodate the tastebuds of folks who are into the Americanized Chinese food rather than the traditional authentic cuisine.  One amazing thing that they did was that they took it upon themselves to prepare a vegetarian appetizer for one of us AFTER they had brought out and served everyone else with the meat appetizer.  No special request was made, they just did it willingly.  That's was a big plus in terms of service. \n\nJust note that - don't come here with the expectations of eating Chinese food with rice.  No rice is served.  Think tapas or dim sum dining (i.e. they bring the 'entrees' out and you just grab it as a table to share).  The prices are ok (about $130 for a table of 5 and 7 dishes), but you're really paying more for style than quantity.\n\nAs someone who is more in tune with eating traditional authentic Chinese cuisines at low prices in 'hole-in-the-wall' places, I probably would just stick to Chinatown.", "author": "Melvin B."}

This place was just plain terrible.\nI had ordered Mongolian Beef for lunch and it was served with tattered meat - not sure how else to describe this. The green onions were not fresh and chopped badly and came out gummy. Worse than the average Chinese place. The fried ball of noodles served alongside to add crunch only served as a bed for the already small amount of meat in the dish. \nHad asked for hot tea, something that every chinese restaurant serves a pot of, gratis, well, not here. You have to pay $3 for a cup of lukewarm water with a fancy ball of tea. I usually drink several tiny cups of tea during and after my meal. Helps with tempering the heat of the food. Not here.\nThe service was just okay - several servers asked us about what we wanted to drink, not sure if tables are supposed to be divided between servers.\nAt the end of this meal, they brought out the check - hand written on a slip of paper. My lunch companion needed a receipt for expenses and clearly the tax-man would laugh at this one. When we asked at the front for a real receipt, we were told that the \"Internet\" was down and won't be up for another three days. huh, (yes, several comebacks popped up in my head too) she offered to fax it to us later.

The \"Chinese\" food is terrible, which is what you expect honestly from a place that caters to just non Chinese, and the decor is a shameless and offensive stereotype.  All of the noodles are very oily which indicates a lack of skill and technique, and the prices are outrageous for what you get.\n\nWhat I also found to be really amusing was that the original menu was in English only, and possibly because the restaurant realized this might be a bad signal to potential patrons, a bunch of Chinese characters was recently scrawled on next to the English.  As if this is going to really give them street cred.  \n\nBut alas, a lot of people in the bay area just don't know what the real deal is, so that's why restaurants like Fang and House of Nanking continue to thrive despite its non existent reputation amongst the Chinese community.  This is the same business model undertaken by places like Yank Sing, and the irony at the end of the day is that the cooks who were at these places also find it funny that they can get away serving this kind of food at such outrageous prices, and when they themselves go out to eat, they do not come to these places!", "author": "P B."}

The Schezwan style prawns, $17 come on, I can get bigger prawns at Costco and cook them up myself, but I will add the flavors were intensely delish.

And the \"cake\" was like a pan fried flour and water mixture.  Would not recommend.  \n\nThen had their spicy dumpling soup, which was not spicy.  The broth tasted like your typical beef noodle soup that you would get at a Chinese restaurant.  The dumplings were handmade, but the 'skin' was a little too thick for soup and the meat was not flavorful and tasted a little too processed.\n\nSesame chicken and a white fish dish were both really salty. (And I loove salt.)  Sesame chicken was a step up from your typical take out food plus a couple tablespoons of salt.  The fish dish was interesting with a layer of arugula and balsalmic vinegar.  It would have made a good fish salad...except for the salt.  \n\nThe service was fun too watch.  They certainly were not very organized.

A quick hint: If each person orders separately, you can get by for about $10-15/each.

I've eaten at House of Nanking before and know the drill.\n\nHere's the drill:  basically they give you a printed menu like any other restaurant, but you really are supposed to just defer to the excellent taste of the owner without asking many questions.  Which we did.  To our delight.\n\nHe asked if there were any foods we couldn't eat, then quickly disappeared.  In about 5 minutes we had our first course - a delicious oyster mushroom and brown rice dish.  When we were halfway through that course we got a side dish with a deep fried shrimp pocket and a fantastic duck slider.  Lastly he brought out an amazing fish dish as the entree.\n\nThe whole meal was served quickly and elegantly and was reasonably inexpensive.  We were also extremely impressed that we could be seated late on the night of the parade with no reservation and very little warning.  The ambiance is lovely and we will definitely be back!", "author": "Sara L."}

After some protest he finally lets us order.  Then while ordering off the menu he starts changing our order based on what he thinks we would like!  After correcting him 5 times and forcing the issue he finally gets our order correct and then disappears never to be seen again for the rest of the meal.  The whole awkward scenario left everyone feeling really uncomfortable the rest of the meal.  All in all the food was oily and had WAY too much garlic (garlic can't be the only flavor in the dish).

My initial impression was favorable as the owner made a good recommendation that I try the White River Noodles.  Once I was done, I felt like I could eat a little more so I asked for the menu.  As I was perusing the menu again, one of the waitstaff came over and wanted to give me the check.  Uh...hello?  I'm perusing the menu.  Doesn't that tell you anything?  He didn't bother asking if I wanted anything else, seemed very disappointed that he couldn't give me the check yet and that I wanted to order the Peking Buns with Duck.  WTF?  Most other restaurants would be thrilled that I wanted to stuff my face with their food but while the food's good here, the waitstaff wanted to get me out as fast as possible.  This at 8:30pm when the restaurant was mostly empty except for myself and another two tables, leaving at least ten to fifteen tables empty.  I've been to low-end dives in Chinatown with brusque waiters who were happier to indulge me in stuffing my face and increasing the total on the check.  The ambiance is nice and it's pretty quiet but it might be destined to remain that way all the way until it nosedives into the ground if the waitstaff doesn't improve their attitude.  I've never felt so unwelcome in any establishment in life and I've run the gamut from high to low end restaurants!  The only saving grace is the food and that's what got them their 3 stars.

The fish was delectable, perfect texture with a sweet, light sauce & fresh spinach. The chicken was spicy, with green bell pepper. It also had a nice flavor.

Unless of course you have no idea what you want to eat and cost and value is inconsequential. Still, charging $20 for a single portabello mushroom is a bit much, even if it tastes sublime. It wasn't bad - very simple preparation but $6 would have been a fair price. The other dish was a soupy curry concoction with a small piece of fried fish - mostly bones - and a few strands of rice noodle. A little too rich with all that coconut milk and not much flavor otherwise. Not what I was expecting and not the sort of dishes I like or consider to be this restaurant's strengths. I appreciate that the owner is trying to introduce his guests to new dishes, etc. but he is doing it in a heavy-handed way. Unfortunately, he only gets one shot with this customer.

Usually I'm in step with the overall rating but definitely not this time. \n\nSince I've walked by the restaurant a couple of times while attending a conference at the Convention Center, I was looking forward to finally eating here. A friend and I had lunch and ordered the Special Chicken and the Lo Mein. We added shrimp to the Lo Mein for additional protein. \n\nBoth dishes were disappointing. C'mon, Chinese food in San Francisco? It should be top-notch! The Special Chicken reminded me of sweet and sour. It was battered and deep fried. OK, it was sweet but not greasy so I'll give it 3 stars. Although, to be honest, I am not a fan of sweet and sour so I'm being very generous with this rating. \n\nThe LoMein was nicely presented in a bowl instead of a platter, with the additional veggies and ingredients atop the noodles so you mix it together with the sauce in the bottom of the bowl. And the noodles were thinner (like ramen?) instead of the usual round/spaghetti type. (3 stars for all of this). Unfortunately, the extra shrimp we ordered were tasteless and small-sized. Reminded me of the cooked shrimp you buy at the seafood counter of your local grocery store. The shrimp (I think we got 6 for the $3 extra) was placed atop the noodles and seemed like an afterthought. No spiciness or additional flavor. Very, very boring and bland (-2 stars for this). \n\nOur server did not bring out rice with the meal so we had to ask for the rice. (What???)  And we did not order drinks. The total lunch bill, for the 2 dishes, with tax and tip came to $30. $15 for a Chinese dish in San Francisco?

Finally we were able to order and our server took our drink order but that's the last we ever saw of her. Our food was delicious but we couldn't finish our dishes because we were dangerously dehydrated! Catching a servers attention is next to impossible so you better come prepared with your own drink cooler or a camel pack strapped to your back as you'll never EVER get a refill on your drinks again. Also we found out that the reason the owner seemed a bit angry with us was because we did not let him order for us.

I don't have much to add to the one and two star reviews with which I agree completely. Dinner at Fang was probably the worst dining experiences of my life. I've eaten bad food before, but never with such high expectations. The numerous high reviews, attitude of the owner and presentation raised the expectations of my dining companions and me. On every level (presentation, quality of ingredients, flavors, preparation), the meal was a complete failure. Odd flavor pairings, liberal use of grease and stale ingredients conspired to terribly disappoint each of us. Don't eat here.", "author": "John S."}

My dinner companion and I were in food heaven the entire time- I will be going back.  They had a sweet soy sauce (I believe it had honey in it) that was wonderful, and the tofu dish we had was cooked perfectly (and the bok choy was seasoned very well).  And my god, have I mentioned how fantastic their rice was?\n\nService: Ridiculously, comically bad.  There was only one other table in the restaurant when we sat down, and it still took her several minutes to come take our drink order.   She was wondering around, wiping down a random table, talking to the kitchen staff, etc. all the while totally ignoring us.  She finally showed up- and by then we had decided on our full meal as well as drinks.  I asked for more water- which came about ten minutes later.  I had to eventually get up and remind her to bring our cocktails- and she made the wrong ones.  (For time perspective- our food arrived about three minutes after she finally got our cocktails to us)  After that we went without water for most of the meal, and she never once checked up to see how the meal was going.  We finally had to flag her down to get the check- keep in mind at this point there are a whopping three tables in the restaurant.   If I saw her working again, I'd probably just come back another day honestly.  I worked in food service for years as a server and manager- I know what it looks like when a server is swamped and when a server is just doing a piss poor job- she was the latter.", "author": "Jesse E."}

The portions are not exactly generous (except for the fried onion cake, which is a meal unto itself) but the flavors are great and the dishes well executed overall. Now onto the problem areas: 1) they have no idea what a reservation means. We showed up for our reservation only to find that there were 4 other parties waiting already, all with opentable reservations, and we were all told we had to wait. All the hostess could offer by way of explanation was \"the tables are full, have to wait\" Waiting 45 mins for your table sort of defeats the purpose of a reservation. Numerous other parties showed up while we were waiting, with no reservations honoured. Worst of all, they were totally unapologetic about their failure to manage the floor and honour reservations. 2) Service is awful; It takes ages to get anyone to wait on you, bring you water/food/bill etc. Even accounting for the cultural tendency to yell and appear stressed/angry, this open kitchen and service area is overtly stressful. 3) Cocktails are tiny and somehow miss the mark altogether. 4) They pack WAY too many tables in for the floorspace. I don't mind cosy but we might as well have been at the same table as the couples on either side of us. \n\nOverall, this place is a little sad, only because the food alone could make this place incredible, but the atmosphere, service, management, and almost every other aspect of the place drag it way down. Too bad....", "author": "Cameron C."}

The menu is not extensive nor does it offer the normal inexpensive fare.  My date and I ordered the hot and sour soup, chicken dumplings, and the tower beef entree with noodles, which was \"upgraded\" by the owner, I presume.  He told us he would bring out something better than our selection.  The dumplings were delicious and well soaked in soy sauce, while the hot and sour soup was just right.  The disappointment was the entree that had flavors like beef jerky to me (some sweetness), though it was nicely tender.  It was accompanied by sauteed onions and cabbage, and all ingredients were served in a wrap.  I think I would have liked our original selection better although the beef might have had the same taste, but I do prefer noodles over wraps.  Overall, lovely layout and furnishings; however, the ambience could have been more calm and less like your typical fast Chinese restaurant, since the prices weren't typical.  I will give it another try, but will be adamant with my choice of entree next time.", "author": "Linda P."}

I heard Fang was really good so of course we were all excited . There where 5 of us in the party and we spent the usual 15 minutes or so reading the menu until we decided on what to have. Eventually the server came (who said she was the owner ) and stated we could have the chef make up dishes to suit our own taste. Since we spent a lot of time figuring out what to have we went for our choices from the menu. (I think I know why she was trying to steer us away from the printed menu) The food was horrible. Most of the dishes were coated in cornstarch, fried and were mucky sweet (we sampled many) Also they seemed to have an odd metallic after taste (yuck) It may appeal to the tourist pallet who has a sweet tooth and likes a lot of deep fried stuff. I never received the tea I ordered (ok that happens) Some of our appetizers came after our entrees and one 55 minutes into our meal. What a train wreck this place is. Save some money and go to one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants out in the avenues.", "author": "Joe W."}

My feelings are mixed.  It's a pretty space and the food was good.  I do have one suggestion for the owners:  hire non-Chinese servers.  We ordered a number of dishes, all of which arrived at exactly the same time about 10 minutes later.  It's just like the cheapest Chinese restaurant in town.  But this isn't the cheapest place in town, and it's trying to create a different type of ambiance.  To do that I think you need servers who have a sense of pacing.  So either train the people you have to pace the delivery of food, or hire people who weren't otherwise trained in other Chinese restaurants. Otherwise, Dear Owner, you are missing the experience you seem to be trying to deliver.", "author": "Snave D."}

Normally very VERY particular about where I get my Chinese food in this town. But I had seen the newish, mod style restaurant a few times on my way to and from work and thought, \"What the hell?\" BIG MISTAKE. While Mr. Fang, owner and chef personally assisted us in ordering, a nice touch, the food was god-awful. Started out with steamed vegetable dumplings. Flavorless dough things filled with still cold tofu and frozen veggie particles covered in bleech brown sauce. (Costco has better dumplings.) Next, a snow peas and garlic noodles app that was tasty but only because it was over garlic'd. Otherwise, very limp, overcooked. Entrees #1 Sesame Chicken, which is always a dicey gamble at most places anyway,  came covered in so much brown glop sauce we had to dig and scrape away the stuff to uncover the grossly overfried chicken and separate the pieces out from the leathery sliced yams. Yuck. Entree #2 was a salt and pepper shrimp dish with overcooked lightly battered little shrimps and giant hot HOT chunks of fried mushrooms. Very odd. Stomach cramps ensued.

It turned out that he just placed the order for us without even asking whether we wanted the specials! It might be his good intension to give us a surprise, but of course we wanted to know what we \"ordered\" and what the prices are. How if we have food allergy or are vegetarians? Maybe we were supposed to understand that \"I'll take care of you\" didn't mean he would bring a chinese menu, but a little bit more explanation would allow us to make choices and have better dinning experience.

The menu was a little short on selection..... appetizers a little unappealing..... had the 'sizzling rice soup with lemon broth and scallions ' (maybe should have been lemongrass?)- flavorful, but was served in a normal single serving sized soup bowl which you would normally get at your mom and pop places. Man and I were still thirsty (we like soup! esp with noodles, but thats another story)\n\nSpeaking of thirst- they had a good -but again, small- cocktail selection. Prob will try another time as havent got the whole alcohol with chinese food thing down yet. Beer maybe to cut the grease, but anything else.. hmmm not sure yet \n\nthere was an older guy walking around talking to people- maybe he was the owner?... he offered to have the kitchen cook anything off the menu - he seemed like he wanted a challenge before we even had decided what to order!  we declined as didnt want to bite more than I could chew, Maybe it was because we were the only chinese diners in the restaurant that evening? after spending a while deciding, it took us a while to flag down someone to take our order- service was pretty inconsistent- you get the owner hovering around, then noone to take the order or do their thing.......\n\nWe ordered the Tofu and eggplant with black bean along with the spicy white fish which I could see a lot of other yelpers were ordering. Whitefish dish was good (thanks guys!!) flavorful; the spinach it came with on top, was lightly dressed with a hot citrusy dressing which a nice refresehing surprise. The Tofu and Eggplant and black bean came without the eggplant and no one noticed.... even the owner didnt think anything out of the ordinary- we had to grab the menu and show him what we ordered. he thought I had just asked for just 'tofu and blackbean'... wow, maybe he really was looking for a challenge- if he wanted me to order off the menu I am pretty sure it wouldnt be something that resembles a dish already on the menu!.. oh dear.... fortunately they took back the dish with good humor and just slapped on some eggplant on top which was heavy on the garlic (i am a fan, but the man almost gagged) \n\nWater came in funky tall jars with full branch of mint and dodgy looking lemon slice on the bottom, no ice. It didnt do the water any favors or flavor.....\n\nThe interior is nice, clean colors and modern, spacious and relaxing place and offers a good alternative to Osha around the corner, however the menus need a few more dishes and more cocktails to get me excited enough to come back and linger after hours with my co-workers..... I'll keep an eye out...", "author": "Sushi Y."}

We entered the restaurant probably 10 minutes before 6 pm.\n\nThe food is all right, not so impressed though. With the restaurant in this level of decoration and layout, I thought the food should be more delicate with nice presentation.  Instead, it was just so-so. Especially, we had side order of white rice.  The rice was not warm and all clumped and dry, indicating that it was not fresh and probably was left overnight. We ordered some curry chicken and some white fish plate. None of them is memorable.  Just usual strong, heavy taste.\n\nThey offered plum wine and warm cockies after dinner.  That was very sweet idea! \n\nI think there are something they can improve, just some sincere opinions - \n1. clean up takeout boxes, papers, bags, telephone books at the end of the bar area where the cashier computer is.  They reminded me of restaurants in China Town, messy with stuff placed all over\n2. talk gentally to each other.  Although we didn't understand the language, several waitress were talking out loud over the open kitchen counter, seemed like they were having arguments all the time\n3. remove plates and balls piling up in front of the open kitchen. Also the dressing stuff.  They were kind of messy with sauce and seasoning dripping over the counter area.  If it was designed to have an open kitchen, it should be kept clean and organized.\n4. handel food with care.

Let the chef arrange your dishes and you will enjoy your meal even more.  Some favorites include the fish soup with lobster tidbits (New Year's treat), tender calamari with a vinegary dipping sauce, Peking bun with seasoned pork instead of duck, seared scallops, tomato salad crispy rice with basil and shrimp or beef, nutty king mushrooms in brown rice, sesame chicken with yams, and fried beef short ribs (this dish is pretty dense).  We usually go in large groups to celebrate birthdays or other occasions and eat downstairs where there is much more room.  The service has been excellent, with servers presenting dishes on individual plates banquet style.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-27", "description": "Since I live only a few blocks away, we decided to give this place a try. It looks cool both inside and out. We were seated promptly, however the service to come was lackluster at best. A server came by our table about 15 minutes after being seated to take drink orders.  One of us ordered wine, which came within 10 minutes or so, however, they sent a Chardonnay rather than a Cabernet. They were happy to fix it. It took an additional 15 minutes for the rest of the table to receive their drinks. I ordered the Jujubini (Which  was described as honey glazed fig, cinnamon, vodka). It tasted like honey sweetened iced tea. I doubt there was even any vodka in it. For any form of martini, you SHOULD be able to taste the alcohol, be it gin or vodka. After receiving our drinks, it took another 10 minutes for them to take our food order. We had a different server each time. When this server took our order he just came by with a pen and paper, and did NOT say one word to us the entire time. He just jotted everything down and walked away.  Once we finally received our food it was average. Nothing special, but better than the Americanized crap that you can sometimes find at other places (aka deep-fried and over sauced). This is probably the only reason for two stars rather than one. After finishing our meals we had to make several attempts at flagging someone down to get boxes and our bill. After that feat was made, it took them about 30 minutes to come back with the bill. I have to say we were tempted to walk out, since we had been there almost two hours. I will most likely never go back.", "author": "Kari N."}
