{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-10-13", "description": "Worst Persian food I've ever had - not sure this place can call what they serve as Persian since they can't even make a decent kabob! Ridiculously overpriced, gross bathrooms, haphazard service. \n\nMy table mates and I all hated the food we were served and we each ordered something different. My kabob was the least bad of everything we ordered. The bench seating was hard as rock, I couldn't sit on it, the chairs were not any more comfortable. \n\nThis is a sad excuse for a restaurant in any city, much less SF, where there is so much competition between the many restaurants. Just a horrible, dilapidated restaurant that needs to be torn down and start everything over from scratch - including the menu.", "author": "Mahsa T."}

The atmosphere is first class, the service is too. And, for me, (as I am not an expert on Persian Cuisine) the food was delicious! \n\nYet, keep in mind fellow Persian food fans, Maykadeh is pricey! \n\nI was hesitant to go in because it was only me and no one else. Persian food is something to be shared and so it is best having it with family and friends. Yet, I was so hungry and I had a few hours before I was to meet up with friends at Davies for the SF Symphony performance. \n\nTo be honest, I had intended to eat very inexpensive. My aim was Golden Boy Pizza, which is nearby. But the line was all the way around the block. \n\nMost of the eateries in and around North Beach are expensive and they are for tourists. I am a local and did not want to get caught up in that. I figured if I am going to spend even a little bit of money, I might as well spend it on a place that is local and truly established. And, somewhere I could sit and enjoy my meal, not have to stand. I also wanted to be somewhere that was going out to a special place. But at the same time was a bit like home. \n\nMaykakeh has been in North Beach for years and it is one of the spots Persians and Persian-Americans go to have dinner and be with family. Whenever I go into North Beach I am often stuck with a bit of sadness because all of the family style Italian-American restaurants I remember as a little kid are gone. Caesar's, New Pizza, Capps Corner, the places I remember as family-style, they are all gone. All from another era. \n\nI watched as various groups arrived at Maykadeh; some dressed up and others more causal. \n\nBits of Farsi could be heard amid the conversations and as one elegantly dressed older couple drove up. They asked the parking attendant outside the door to park their car. I watched them and I wondered, \"are these expatriates? Would these be some of the people who escaped the turmoil that emerged in Iran in the late 1970s?\" \n\nThey looked distinguished, so glamorous, finely dressed. Persians are unique in their standards of dress and hospitality, compared to us Americans. For them it is important to always make guests feel like they are welcomed and honored. And, to dress up is a sign of respect as well as celebration.\n\nEven most of the causally dressed people had at least one or two pieces of clothing that were stylish and chic. In a way, their gathering reminded me of those old Italian-American restaurants I recall. It was when families gathered for a Sunday dinner.\n\nThe aroma of the saffron rice and the roasted lamb was alluring, if not beckoning. \n\nFortunately, the parking attendant was very persistent that I go in anyway and that yes, there is room for someone to dine alone. I sat at the little bar which is near the front door. Good thing I did because staff was making a \"Persian Martini.\" It looked scrumptious. \n\nStill, mindful that I would be going off to the Symphony later on, I figured I best stay with a reliable standard, a glass of Syrah. \n\nI had the kabob appetizer. Wow! The staff was so gracious they provided me with fresh baked bread,warm right out of the oven.  And, they gave me fresh a green salad with basil to go with my lamb/beef kabob. On the plate was also a fresh stewed tomato and onions. Oh so delicious! \n\nI should have ordered some rice to go with it, so to soak up the gravy on the plate. \n\nI had been to Maykedeh once before and enjoyed it. I had forgotten that it is a hub of happy gatherings and savory meals.\n\nI have been a Persian food fan for some time. Yes, even long before Anthony Bourdain's show (God Bless him, may his soul be at peace). \n\nSome years back, my nephew was dating a Persian-American girl from Sunnyvale. She introduced us to Persian food and all the Persian restaurants in the City. Albourz, Maykekeh and Lavash out in the Sunset, she took us to them all. We (my family and I, were instantly won over and have been fans ever since). \n\nPersian food is a delight for the senses and a taste sensation like no other. Well, yeah, there's Indian and Thai food. But Persian is made with that something special that sets it apart from all others. \n\nAnyway, back to my visit on Saturday night. I concluded my meal with Persian style Baklava and some Persian tea. Oh, so scrumptious! I wanted more. \n\nService was excellent as everyone there aims to please. Yes, I will go back. I have to go back to try that \"Persian Martini.\" But I will make sure I bring friends and family too. It is much more fun that way to share a meal so wonderful.", "author": "Jonathan F."}

We had reservations, but the place wasn't completely full at 7 PM.\n\nThe ambiance is nice, with roses at each table. The tables are not too close together, and we could hear each other speak quite easily.\n\nWe decided to share a few things and ordered the fancy salad to start, and the koobideh kebab and fesenjun with chicken as our mains. We also asked for tadigh, but they did not bring any. :(\n\nThey bring out warm bread to start, with a plate of butter, onion and sabzi.  Don't be shy, they'll bring out more if you finish!\n\nThe fancy salad was great. I loved the poached pears and it was a great start to the meal.\n\nNo complaints on our mains either. The koobideh was juicy and flavorful, and the fesenjun sauce was thick like a gravy, just how I like it. Both plates were served with generous portions of soft, buttery rice.\n\nAfter we received our meals, my sister asked for a side of yogurt and the waitress brought out a huge dish of it. We were also charged $7 for this, so just beware.\n\nFinally, we ordered the fallodeh for dessert. My sister chose this one, and I wasn't particularly looking forward to it. I wanted the bastani. Anyway, it was fine but it didn't quite hit the spot for me--- we ended up at baked bear later.\n\nOverall, a very nice dining experience. It's a little on the pricey side for entrees, but if you go with a group and split some things, it may be more economical.", "author": "Roya B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-03-03", "description": "For authentic Persian food from the perspective of a Persian gal, Maykadeh is heavy on pricing and not so heavy on portions or flavor. \n \nAlthough I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, it lacked the Persian flavors I expected and hoped for to brag about to the people I brought here that had never had Iranian food before. Their chicken kabobs were rather small, and resembled kabobs of simple Mediterranean food restaurants, so no bold Persian spices and tastes stood out to me. Also, their stews (we tried both Fesenjan and Ghormeh Sabzi) were decent, but rather watery. I do know this place is infamous for their lamb tongue/brain, so perhaps if you're brave enough for that, it is the only time I'd suggest making the trip in SF traffic with the not so plentiful parking to Maykadeh. \n\nI am forever grateful for the endless pita bread though....", "author": "Sayeh Z."}

Maybe they should've just clarify with the guest about the order instead?

The prices are more than most are used to pay for Iranian food, especially if you lived in LA and got three times the portions for half the price.  However, an area of improvement is their delivery.  They are consistently late.  For example, if they say it will taken45-60 minutes, plan on 2hours, at least.

So I scrambled and improvised until I found Maykadeh! With stellar reviews and a solid reputation, we called our Uber to get here.\n\nWhen we walked in, I was a little nervous to see it so empty around 645 PM. But then again, it was a Monday. We were immediately sat at a table by the entrance. The interior is beautifully decorated with a fresh red rose on each table.\n\nNow let's get to the important part - the food! Oh my lord, the hummus and Baba Ganoush are impeccable! Such flavor and to be honest, my only mistake was eating too much. For our entrees, we got both a chicken and a lamb kebab and I still dream about that chicken. I know right ? I talked about the chicken over the lamb. Believe me when I say there was so much flavor and moisture captured in the meat that you cannot forget it. Mixed with the rice, pita and hummus, our dinner became unforgettable. \n\nThe only improvement I could see is that my girl friend and I were looking to have a wine paired with our dinner; however, the waitress seemed a little confused.

Most recent was last week. The service and food is consistent. Friendly staff, warm atmosphere and great service. \n\nI believe this is the closest experience you can have to an actual Iranian Restaurant, outside Iran.\n\nStarted with the usual Feta Cheese, Basil, Reddish and Naan. Can't really go wrong there. (Maybe adding few pieces of walnuts could improve that?)\n\nKashk-e-Badmjan (eggplant starter) was tasty. could use a little bit more Kashk but that's just a preference thing I guess. And I'm pretty sure you can just ask the staff to bring you more.\n\nWe ordered Soltani and Shish Kabob plus a side of Ghorme Sabzi since I was with a non Iranian friend and wanted her to try something other than Kabob dishes. (I personally never order stews at an Iranian restaurant, feels like waste of opportunity not getting more kabobs!)\n\nThe Ghorme Sabzi dish was alright IMO, can't complain for $12. But I still prefer my sister's Ghorme Sabzi better!\n\nMy favorite was the Barg portion of the Soltani. Shish Kabob was my friend's favorite. All pretty good and left me satisfied for a Persian cuisine experience outside of Iran. (Finished every food obviously!)\n\nThe Persian music is a nice touch and I like the ambiance of the whole place. (Not many changes there since my first visit)\n\nDidn't like the Dough. I will probably just stick to water next time. \n\nBefore I left, I over heard another customer ordering Aab Anaar (pomegranate juice). I've had to try it after I saw the actual thing! It was perfect with a touch of salt and Golpar ( Persian Hogweed?)\n\nWe finished with some Persian Tea and Baklava.\n\nAll and all I'm pretty picky with my Persian restaurants in the US, to the point I rather not even going to a Persian Restaurant since they are mostly too inferior compare to the actual deal. But I would definitely go back to Meykadeh anytime I happen to be in SF and feel a little bit extra Persian.", "author": "Amir S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-28", "description": "Come here to explore Persian cuisine and left genuinely satisfied. The food was seasoned well and had excellent flavor all around. Service was a bit off, but otherwise it was a great experience.\n\nWe began our meal with the Feta Cheese Spread, composed of oven roasted tomatoes, basil, and olive oil mixed with feta cheese. This spread went really well with the pita bread provided. However, the portion size was pretty large so we really only got through half, trying to save room for our entrees....wrong move. About 30-40 minutes after we stopped picking at our appetizer, we noticed the waitstaff making more frequent visits to our table to \"check in\" - refilling water, rearranging the utensils, taking away plates....but never to update us on whether or not our entrees would (if ever) arrive. That's when we came to the conclusion that we probably were supposed to finish all the cheese first...\n\nI understand not wanting to \"rush\" patrons, but observation should have shown that we were pretty ready for our entrees...a simple question would have sufficed rather than constant checks. Eventually, we did receive our entrees (and we didn't even have to finish the cheese!) and what we ordered was really good!\n\nThe Shishlik was our runaway favorite! Done medium-rare, these lamb chops were impossibly tender with amazing flavor and just enough char. The order is delivered with 6 bone in chops - a great value too! Second favorite was the Khoresht Fesenjoon. Made of pomegranate and walnuts, you can really pick up on the fruity and nutty undertones in this \"sweet and sour\" sauce. The chicken was also fork tender. The Ghorme Sabzee was pretty good. The kidney beans mixed in with the onion, leeks, herbs, and lime was a nice touch...perfect accompaniment for the basmati rice in my opinion. The lamb shank was also fall of the the bone tender. The only dish I was a bit unsatisfied with was the Koobideh. It was definitely juicy, but there just wasn't much pizzazz compared to our other dishes.\n\nAll in all, delicious meal...albeit taking a lot longer than we had expected due to a tiny snafu.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

We loved doogh here and there was fight at our table over it. \nI didn't try any other food, cause kobideh is the only think that i easy in a persian restaurant.

Last year, me and my friend went there and got the worst customer service. They weren't busy and only there was two or three tables and they kept ignoring us even by passing our table to go the only other table without checking on us. We were so disrespected by their worst customer service. I don't know why I forgot to write a review then!! Maybe I just wanted to forget the experience. \nYesterday we went there again for my cousin's bday. Her husband invited us there and I always like to give places a second or third chance. This time it wasn't as horrible as the last but somehow they don't like to check on their customers. I think this is how they run the business but I don't think it is right. Because we had to wait for them to come around or ask the waiter. Again, they weren't busy and there were many servers working too. The food was just ok comparing to other Persian restaurants. The chicken kobedah was awful and chewy. It seemed that it was pre cooked and then over cooked in microwave. The beef kobedah was juicy but no flavor at all. I don't add salt in my food but this time I had too. The salad was very fresh and good. The fesonjoon was very delicious to be honest. \nThe waiter didn't come to ask us about the meal and we had to wait until he came to the next table to tell him about the bad chicken. The chicken breast was very good and we ordered another one of that instead. \nI don't know if I want to go back to this place for the price you pay not only for the food but for the parking too. \nHope they can fix these issues and check on their customers to see everything is ok.", "author": "Dee O."}

I ordered the Maykadeh Solanti. Upon opening the box the fragrant aroma of the perfectly cooked basmati rice mixed with the savory smells of the meat captivated my senses. It was also a very large portion and for a petite person like myself I easily made this into two meals which makes the initial pricier cost less so. \n\nThe rice was cooked well, but slightly under seasoned which was fine because the juices of the meats marinated the rice adding more savory flavor that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The solanti (filet mignon) itself was juicy, full of flavor and married well with the rice. The koobideh, though well seasoned, wasn't as tasty as the solanti nor did the meat melt in my mouth as did the solanti did. Probably because of the type of meat it was. Overall, a great dish, though next time I would just order the Maykadeh kebab (barg) because the filet mignon was the way better of the two meats, that way I'll save the extra $4 and put it towards the Persian ice cream :)", "author": "Melissa N."}

True that they are beautiful in the eyes of many, but there is a lot more to Persian culture than the carpets; Persian Cuisine being an example. At Maykadeh Restaurant they do an excellent job of providing proof of my argument.\n\nMost who have dined in a Persian restaurant would agree that the Kebabs and the rice are delicious, but more adventurous diners, may wish to try some of the other dishes. For example if you like eggplants, try the Kashke Bademjan for appetizer. If not an eggplant fan, try Mast-o-Khiar which is homemade yogurt mixed with cucumbers and mint.\n\nFor main course, you can't go wrong with the kebabs of course, but you may also wish to try Khoresht Ghaymeh, an stew that is made with Pieces of lamb, yellow split peas, saffron, tomato, sun dried lime and served with Basmati rice. In cold weather Khoresht Fesenjoon may be a good choice. It is a stew made with dry roasted walnuts, pomegranate juice, and chicken thighs and/or breast. It has a sweet and sour taste and is served with Basmati rice.\n\nWhat is the meaning of Khoresht you might wonder? As you may have guessed by now, \"khoresht\" is a generic term for stew dishes in Persian cuisine that are usually served with rice.\n\nFor appetizer you may want to try a cup of Persian tea with homemade Baklava.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-01", "description": "I visited this restaurant with my boyfriend and his family last night. Even though all of us are quite aware of the shortage of good quality, authentic Persian cuisine in the Bay Area, we were craving kabob and thought we would give Maykadeh a chance. We are Persian and we have a palate that understands what kabob is supposed to taste like and don't mess around. To our dismay, the kabob here is meant for people who don't know where Iran is on a map or claim they're cultured, yet they can't even pronounce Iran correctly. That's the only reason why the place is crowded. People just don't know what authentic Persian food is supposed to taste like otherwise they wouldn't be frequenting Maykadeh. Let me explain the food to you. We all ordered Barg and Koobideh kabobs and had a gheyme tadig appetizer and masto-mosier. The Barg tasted like bacon and it was sooooooo rubbery....and it was purple in tint. And did you know it's $37? We had soltanis so it was $43 for a small skewer of mediocre, off-tasting Barg and a skewer of koobideh that was forgettable. All in all, the kabob is literally double the price of all big city Persian restaurants I've been to, yet you are getting a smaller quantity and an average kabob that lacks freshness, juiciness, and taste. Maykadeh isn't fancy and it's not in Beverly Hills so why it charges double anywhere else baffles me. What are you going to charge next? $50? Oh and their chicken kabob which we had to send back has a whole host of random herbs in it that is clearly not found in Persian cuisine. Please don't come here if you are an actual Iranian, although I don't blame you for coming since there isn't much else in the Bay Area to choose from unfortunately. Before I end, I will say the gheyme tadig was pretty tasty!", "author": "Shirin K."}

I ordered the lamb chops, which came with rice, and some hummus on the side. \n\nThe menu could use some clarification. For example, the hummus is $9 (!) and I surmised this must be either the most amazing hummus ever, or a large portion, or include something else-- but the menu didn't specify. I ordered it anyway, and also a side of pita for $3. \n\nAs suspected, a decent sized portion of hummus arrived, in addition to a full bag of pita (containing 4 rounds) and a smaller tray of sliced pita (equal to 2 rounds-- what we ended up eating). Not sure what part came with what, but we obviously overordered on the pita. We also received a small box containing one quarter of a raw onion and some basil leaves-- perhaps meant to be a salad, or maybe a garnish? \n\nAll in all, I bought one entree (the lamb chops, which are 3 chops on top of rice) and one appetizer (the hummus/pita) to share with my husband: it was filling and the chops were seasoned well, but expensive for a weeknight one-entree/appetizer takeout meal. And the hummus was okay, but not $9 amazing.\n\nI might come to the restaurant for a special occasion, but I'll probably skip takeout.", "author": "Krista L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-10", "description": "This is by far the worst Persian restaurant I have ever been too! 1) The service was awful- our waitress didn't attend to us for over 15 mins after we sat down, forgot our drinks until a minute before our meal came even though we reminded her of it, and ignored our requests for butter with our bread at the beginning of the meal. 2) I have never had more disappointing \"Persian\" food and for such a ridiculously expensive price!! We ordered a joojeh kabob which is just chicken thighs and the chicken was not fully cooked, had little to no flavor, and was full of uncooked fat that made trying to chew any salvageable pieces impossible. We told our waitress who grabbed the manager. After we told him of the issue with the chicken he told us \"with that many pieces of meat (no more than 8-10 mind you) some of them might not cook all the way\" WTF. Raw chicken can cause salmonella, it's not like meat where you can have it medium rare! He wanted to make us new ones which at that point we were already so disappointed and sadden by our meal experience did not want to have to wait for a new one and asked what else could be done (ie hoping they would refund the chicken as it was inedible leaving us hungry and upset) and he dismissed any opportunity to rectify the situation further. We also ordered doogh or a yogurt based drink that genuinely tasted like it was blended with acetone. We are all Persian at the table and have grew up with this drink- never had one taste as funky as this. Our go to Persian place (Lavash) is closed and had heard great things about this place and were so so so frustrated by this experience- it's not worth it and I hope someone in higher management has the opportunity to see this and hopefully adjust the quality of food and service at this restaurant. We paid an inordinate amount of money for food we didn't get to eat and service that was lacking- will never be coming back or recommending this place to anyone.\n\nI will say, perhaps there other menu items are better and though we didn't get to try them it was ultimately the poor attitude of the service that will stop us from giving it another chance though others seem to enjoy this place.", "author": "Jessie R."}

Our usual go to dishes are mast-o-museer (yogurt with elephant garlic) as a dip, tahdig with fessenjoon and ghormeh sabzi and the chicken koobideh and beef koobideh kababs. It appears that all the yogurt dishes are homemade as a lot of Persian restaurants opt for premade from vendors like Abali. I will say the only thing that bums me out is that they do not have carbonated doogh. The staff is super friendly and the host is very gracious.

Since I don't live in the city, it would have to be a special occasion for me to make the drive. I always order the lamb tongue and the soltani (filet mignon and koobideh). I also love the ghormez sabze because it taste just like my Persian friend mom's home cooking.\n\nThe hands down favorite is the tongue. I've never had anything like it.  I'm going to have to elaborate on this order because I found the best way to eat it.  It's tender, tart and creamy but not the milky creamy taste. More yogurt creaminess. It's an appetizer but I always ask for it to be served with my meal. It goes so well with rice, the red tart stuff, and raw onions. YES, the raw onion adds a sweet kick to the tart flavor. You'll thank me on the onion suggestion but not your significant other.\n\nThe only downside to this place is how pricey the soltani has gotten over the years. It was in the high teens back in the early 90s but it's over $30 now.  I don't mind paying for good meat, and it is supposedly filet mignon. However, I would rather eat filet mignon at a steakhouse.  Their koobideh is nearly just as good. For $19, you get a generous portion. Also, they used to provide complimentary feta cheese with the bread and sabze, but it's now extra charge for the cheese.\n\nI would give 5 stars if the prices are more reasonable or maybe if they brought back the feta cheese (lol, I know it's just cheese but I hate it when something is taken away). Also, I love how this place retain their employees. I've seen some of the same people from the 90s!", "author": "Victor L."}

There's not a lot of good Persian food in Seattle, and I know SoCal has plenty, so I figured this would be great too... boy, I was so wrong!  I cook Persian food at home and I get as much of it as I can when I'm down in the OC, so I've had my fair share of good and bad Persian food.\n\nI ordered the Maykadeh Soltani which consists of rice, grilled tomato, koobideh kebab, and barg kebab.  It looked and smelled great when it came out.  I dug in immediately and even forgot to put on sumac the first few bites.  The meat was kind of tough and the flavor was off... I'm not sure what it was, but it's not what I'm used to having.  The koobideh was a little bit better, but it still wasn't hitting the spot.  It seemed as if it was missing something, or the mixture of onions, herbs, and spices were off.  The tomato was also undercooked and wasn't quite ripe. I usually finish this before I run out of meat and rice, but this time I just left it on the side after about 3 bites.  Hopefully I went on an off night, but I doubt i'd go back  again for the $30 price tag.  \n\nAlso they only take Visa and MC, no AMEX for you business travelers...\n\nThe place itself was pretty and had an upscale feel, but overall, I am very disappointed.  :-(  Maybe next time I'll find something better in SF.", "author": "Diana C."}

Grasshoppers, wax moth larvae, ox penis, pig snout, chicken testicles, fish eyeballs, I've eaten these all and I'm always looking for the next adventurous food item to devour.\n\nI adore offal and Maykadeh's menu sold me with their offal delicacies like lamb tongue, lamb head, brains and feet (halal menu also available). However, I have not been having the best of luck with new restaurants lately and Maykadeh is sadly one of them.\n\nI only ate a packaged ramen that day so I was anxiously anticipating dinner at Michelin recommended (not to be confused with Michelin starred) Maykadeh only to sorely regret it (literally) later on.\n\nMake no mistake, I love Persian food and what we had at Maykadeh for the most part was delicious. We started dinner with complimentary pita bread which was nice and toasty but we had no idea what to do with the accouterments of raw onion, radish, basil, and butter: http://bit.ly/11ULXib. I think they forgot the feta cheese? *Sigh* \n\nA must order, the Lamb Tongue ($15) was incredibly soft and was swimming in a divinely creamy sauce of sour cream, saffron and lime: http://bit.ly/Xt1Vs7. The lamb tongue is one of the top three tongues I've tasted; aside from Mr. NSS' of course. The intensely rich, liver-like Brain ($15) would have been more manageable to eat and enjoyable had it been chopped down before cooking. I felt like I was on an episode of Fear Factor tearing into a hunk of mystery meat: http://bit.ly/WTS5Dr. Not sexy. I would skip this. The much raved about Koobideh ($14.75) of ground Angus and lamb was tender and well-spiced though I favor Lavash's more because it's more flavorful and the char marks giving it a smoky nuance: http://bit.ly/12z5kx7. I loved the aromatic basmati rice which was a perfect canvas for the koobideh. Don't forget to order a side of the tangy Cucumber and Yogurt Sauce ($6) for a refreshing accompaniment to your meal: http://bit.ly/TUFAYg.\n\nService was just as pleasant as the professional and cordial staff. The crisp white linen tables, shiny gold striped chairs and banquettes, and warm pink decor was classy and romantic (albeit circa 1990s). The availability of valet ($10) makes parking a breeze in this otherwise parking nightmare part of SF.\n\nAs we left Maykadeh, I had every intention of giving them 4 solid stars.\n\nSeveral hours pass...\n\nSevere stomach cramping ensues and the next thing I know, I was hugging the porcelain throne with my ass cheeks. For 36 hours (and counting), I never thought I could do so many butt exercises sitting down but I did.\n\nLesson learned.\n\nFrom now on, all my adventurous endeavors will take place behind closed doors...in the bedroom. \n\nThe End.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We came with an authentic Iranian friend of ours who recommended this as the best in the area.  He said that while its not like his mom made (is it ever?), it came very close.  Which I think is the greatest compliment someone can give to a meal.  This is a Persian restaurant that specializes in kabobs and stews.  \n\nI got ghorme sabze (a lamb stew) and my wife got the chicken koobideh (a kebab).  My dish was basically a lamb shank that was cooked in this dark stew of different spices and vegetables.  The lamb literally fell off the bone - it was perfectly tender and not at all tough.  The dish came with rice as well.  This isn't the forgettable cheap kind you get at asian restaurants - this was rice cooked up well and the rice on its own tasted yummy!  I mixed up the stew into the rice and went to town - happy camper here.  \n\nMy wife's kebab also came with rice and 2 large skewers of the meat.  The portion I tried was very tender, juicy, and delicately seasoned.  Another winner.  \n\nThe prices here are a little more than I am used to - for 2 skewers and the rice (my wife's entree) cost 20 bucks.  That seemed a little on the high side to me but you could tell they put more care into their food than the regular middle eastern restaurants.  \n\nIts not pretentious or anything but it seemed much classier than your typical kebab/gyro place.  Cutlery, silverware, napkins, etc all were classy.  Not to say you need to get dressed up to come here - but a lot of people were.  \n\nI think this place is the real deal as my Iranian friend attested to its authenticity.

Unfortunately I realized that it was under cooked after eating a whole piece. I write this to you all pre-illness, I'm hoping nothing comes of this, but eating RAW UNDERCOOKED CHICKEN IS ACTUALLY TERRIBLE FOR YOU AND THE ODDS ARE NOT IN MY FAVOR. Oh, and when I called the place to complain about this egregious mistake, they offered me EAT24 credits....WHAT?!?

I don't understand what kind of establishment they are running here but if you have a death wish order the chicken from this disgusting place.\n\nProbably a moot point by now but just to top things off, their bread and hummus was awful.

It is by far one of the best. \n\nI highly recommend their mast-o- musir garlic yoghurt it is alot of yoghurt to be served as a starter, more like a side dish. Their sabzee is really good (very similar to a spinach stew) and has the most delicious soft lamb shank. I have also had the fasanjoon here, it is a thick brown sweet and sour sauce not to everyones taste. Speaking of that maybe refrain from pacha too; a lightly spiced boil up of lamb bones (hooves included). I personally like it and think they do it to prefection, but it has a leather like after taste if it is your first time. Their grills and kabobs are fantastic if you are not feeling like being an Anthony Bourdain. A must try is their ice cream quite sweet but a perfect end to a great meal. \n\nWhy not 5 stars uhmmm their waiting staff are not quite there which is a shame because their managers are wonderful.", "author": "Nora B."}

(And I served all through college) \nOne guy was serving the whole restaurant he was good till he got busy then he was running around like a chicken with no head...he was a one man show and his service suffered towards the end...took us about 25 min before we got our check (he passed the check books out to about 6 tables) he carried them around with him till he was ready to pass them all out at the same time! \nNow the food...the ground beef was delicious but the filet was just ok not any different (not juicier or especially tender) than the rest of the restaurants I have been to... I got it medium/medium rare too by the way cause I don't destroy my meat like most Iranians and cook it to death lol  \nMy friend got the chicken and she wasn't too crazy about it either...I tasted it and it was ok nothing special \nAnyway this was my experience \nOverpriced by A LOT! \nmediocre service \nOk food \nI would definitely go to Alborz next time I am in the city for Persian food!", "author": "Patty H."}

The owner and his wife are proud of their Maykadeh and we are excited each and every time we enter our Persian home away from home, albeit neither of us are of Persian descent or from anywhere in the region of the former great Persian Empire...\n\nThe food is always fresh, perfectly prepared, beautifully served, generous in portion and the menu choices richly represent the heritage of one of the world's most important cuisines.\n\nYou must not miss the Saffron and Lime Lamb Tongue Appetizer, the Roasted Elephant Garlic Yogurt 'Mast-o-Musir', the Bottom Rice Dish 'Tah-dig', the Beef and Lamb Grilled Kebab 'Chelo Kebab Koobideh' (Be certain to order an egg yolk for your rice), any of the lamb shank dishes as all are extraordinary, especially the 'Ghormeh Sabzi' (Fresh Green Herbs and Kidney Beans) and the 'Khoresht Bademjan' (Eggplant and Tomato), the Dill, Lima Bean and Chicken Dish 'Baghali Polow', the Yogurt and Dried Mint Drink 'Doogh', the Rose and Pistachio Ice Cream 'Bastani', and just about everything else on the menu.

Throughout the time we spent there, the service was lacking and the staff was unfriendly and had a \"don't give a shit\" attitude. I believe you cannot have a good culinary experience when the staff is never smiling.\n\nWe were seated after 30 minutes and given food menus. We waited patiently for the wine list for 15 minutes before one of us lost patience and asked for it. We were hungry and decided on our appetizer order while waiting for the wine list, but they were too busy to take our first order for the next few minutes. So, 30 minutes into the escapade and all we had was free pita (no appetizers or drinks). The appetizers were out fairly quickly once we ordered and were decent.\n\nWe were ready to order the main course and one of our friends wanted to substitute plain rice for Bagadi Pollo and the waitress wanted to charge $5 extra, which my friend was ok with. I expect that a \"fine-dining\" place to do better when we are bound to spend $250+ All our entrees were decent, but we've all had better before!\n\nAt the end of this, they charged us 18-20% gratuity for a party of 5. Maybe, they had a clause somewhere which said that, but we felt that they knew their service sucked and didn't want to lose out on tips.\n\nWe won't go back and would recommend our friends to avoid it as well.", "author": "Selma A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-27", "description": "Being Persian and loving Persian food we decided that we had to go to the Persian restaurant that we have been hearing about. We didn't make reservations as we were going for lunch. We got there and were greeted by the gentleman in the front and seated immediately. \n\nOnce we sat down they brought over pita bread and sabzi (veggies). \n\nOur complete order was:\n\nDrinks:\n1 corona\n4 diet cokes \n\nAppetizers:\nMast-o-musir\nTahdig w/ ghameh. \n\nEntree:\nBeef soltani w/ rice\nChicken kabob (breast) w/ rice\n\nLet me start off my saying again that I am Persian. I have tried all Persian restaurants in LA and OC. Not to mention my mom is the best Persian cool ever. Walking in I thought maybe the place could use a little make over. I was hoping that all the good reviews weren't just a thing of the past and the food quality had changed but NO. \n\nFor those of you who don't know what mast is.. It's yogurt and this particular one has garlic and shallots. I typically love this dish but this one I feel like was sheep or lamb yogurt and I didn't love it. The tahdig appetizer is always no matter what- what you order when you go to any Persian restaurant. When ordering tahdig you order a stew with it. We got the ghameh. It had chunks of lamb which I really don't love but was still good. \n\nThey brought our main dish. We had the meats on one plate and our own plate of rice. I was skeptical of trying the koobideh because as I mentioned before I don't like lamb and the meat they use is a mixture of lamb and beef. I tried a piece first. Ummm. WOW. Not gammy at all. Juicy. FULL of flavor. The barg. WOW just as good. Barg kabob is really hard to make and to make juicy?? Never even knew it could be made so perfectly! Tender, juicy and flavorful. Of course I had a side of onions. I couldn't eat my kabob any other way. Yes. Raw onions with every bite. So delicious. The chicken was good too. Not seasoned like your typical Persian chicken kabob but that's what made it so good. Tender and juicy. You could really taste the basil and it was a fresh element to it. I should mention that the rice was also really good. Typically Persian restaurants lack on the quality of the rice but not here. You can tell the quality of everything is impeccable  \n\nOverall: I am thoroughly satisfied. Our total bill was $88 for two people. Not super cheap but for the best of Persian food. Worth it. Considering you go to a steakhouse or any other restaurant and pay just that much if not more for one person. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and I definitely hope to have the opportunity to go back!", "author": "Ida A."}

Ghormeh, a style of Persian cooking, was actually something I hadn't seen on a menu before, and so I asked our waiter about it.

It was really a fun an fascinating conversation.\n\nThe service was very quick on a very busy Thursday night, the food was quite outstanding -- hot pita with a roasted-garlic-laced hummus for appetizer, followed by a not-quite-too-sweet pomegranate chicken and a lamb shank in a slightly spicy spinach curry-like sauce. My partner was thrilled with her wine selection, and boy oh boy did they make me a tasty Old Fashioned.\n\nHaving just moved down from Portland, OR -- I'll note that we were probably just a little too happy with the upper-scale ambiance and white linens (not that it doesn't exist in Portland, it's just harder to find).

I don't remember the last time I had such good long grain rice. Not to mention the lamb stew.\nThe quantity of food is really good, too.\nService can be sloppy at times.\nThe part that made me give 2 stars instead of 4, they sent two sides (a salad and a yoghurt bowl) which we never ordered. We consumed them innocently thinking they were complimentary like the bread. \nWhen we pointed it out, the owner went back to speak with the server. \nHere is the interesting part. The one who took away our dishes, seemed to confirm that we had consumed those dishes, which is ridiculous, if you realize what she was trying to insinuate. We DID eat that stuff but we never ordered for it specially under the impression that it is complimentary. Then, the one who took our order too confirmed that we had ACTUALLY ordered those. All of this drama where we could see them exchanging words and disapproving looks as if we were lying. \nThe saving grace was that the owner took off the extra charges. I made it a point to ask him a rhetorical question, \"why would we lie?\" and to tell him that the food was really good.\nThe least you expect from a pricey place is good food and common courtesy. If you don't want to admit your mistake, fine, but don't make it seem like the customer is a thief!\nOf note is the fact that when I checked a lot of \"not recommended\" reviews here on Yelp, they all said similar things, more or less.

The 1st thing that I noticed was how high the prices were. Kubideh kabab for $16 !!! I really like the stews that have a whole lamb shank in them.  Typically it is made using beef stewing meat at homes. I ordered Ghormeh-sabzi stew. We also ordered Kubideh kabab, chicken kabab and chicken breast kabab. My stew was really good. Very tasty and well prepared. Make sure you separate the fat from the lamb shank before you dig in. I also tried a piece of chicken kabab which was very moist and tasty. The ambiance was very average. I was curious as how the prices differ from Alborz Persian cuisine on Van Ness, so I looked at their menu on Yelp and their website. In average, Meykadeh is $3-$4 more expensive per meal than Alborz. Their barg and soltani kababs are $10 more than Alborz and their mast-o-moosir is almost twice the price !\nI would categorize Meykadeh as a bit pricey, but the location might be the reason.", "author": "Sam N."}

However, the lighting was pretty bright and the clientele seemed to be dressed very casual.  Yelp says it is \"romantic\" and \"classy\", but I would definitely categorize Maykadeh as casual, despite it's desperate attempt to be a \"romantic\" fine dining restaurant.  \n\nFood: \n         For appetizers, we ordered the Greek salad (average) and the Baba Ghanoush (excellent!).  The Baba Ghanoush was definitely the highlight. \n         As my entree, I tried the Chelo-kebab Koobideh, which is 2 skewers of a beef/lamb mixture and a very large portion of rice.  The rice could have used some flavor, but the meat was tender and the spices were yummy! \n         For dessert, I tried both the creme caramel and the poached pears with ice cream.  I would recommend the creme caramel (unless you have had my grandfather's, which is hard to beat).  The poached pears with ice cream was definitely different, which I liked, but it didn't really stand out.  \n\n\nConclusion:\n      Maykadeh won't make-ya-day or break-ya-day.", "author": "Juliana K."}

I love Mediterranean food and I can't say I'm a good critic of it but I know what I like and this place knows what they are doing. \n\nFirst of all there is the plate of hot pita served with mint and feta are fantastic. For the amount of food you are about to ingest, the mint really helps with digestion.\n\nFor starters we went with Hummus and Baba Ghanoush which were perfect, really well done. We also added a new favorite of Kashke Bademjan, with just the right amount of kick, its eggplant prepared like you've never tasted before. I highly recommend trying this.   \n\nMy entry was Khoresht Bademjan which I was not too thrilled with because of the lime. This dish is not for every pallet and when they say there is lime in it, you can really taste that fact. If you are a fan of the savory and sour in a very Mediterranean way then go for it, otherwise I'd go with something else. Trust me there is plenty to choose from. \n\nAlso I was super excited for the baby eggplant since that is one of my favorite vegetables, but it had been stewed in this lime sauce that I couldn't quite get a taste for which was a bit disappointing I must admit.

We have eaten there several times and enjoyed it - so we wanted to figure out if we loved persian food or we just loved Lavash.\n\nTHE SERVICE:\nValet parking ($10) at Maykadeh was very helpful given the neighborhood and its lack of parking.  We walked into the (empty) restaurant and were greeted politely and taken to 4-person table, made from two 2-top tables.  They set both our menus in front of me and then proceeded to take apart the extra table.   I wish they had just put us a a two person table to begin with and the extra 3-seconds to nicely set the menu out in front of both of us would have been appreciated.  I always feel like I'm in a diner when they bring a stack of menus and set them in front of one person.\n\nAbout 10-minutes after sitting waiting (remember, restaurant is empty) we were approached and asked if we wanted anything to drink.  I requested some water (surprised it took so long) and my wife a chardonnay. \n\nJumping to the end of the meal, we ordered a bahklava (sp?) and the check and never got the check.  We had to flag them down and ask for it again and then they never came to pick it up.  I finally got up and walked it to the front so we could pay our bill and leave.\n\nSo-  Service rating:  2 stars.\n\nTHE FOOD:\nWe had the ground meat kebab and the joojeh saltani (sp?).  The ground meat was was really nice.  I wish they had the lavash bread a bit thinner (these were more pita bread) and also if they had it underneath the dish so it could soak up the delicious juices.   \n\nAll in the all, the food was 3.5 to 4-stars.  Great flavoring.  Big portions.\n\nOnly thing I would rate 2-stars was the Bahklava.  It was really not great and when we had 1 bite of it nobody bothered to ask if it was okay or suggest they remove it from the bill.

Even the wine list is nice.

So, if you're vegetarian you might be forced to order off of the appetizer menu. \n\nThe location might force you to do some parallel parking, but it's worth it.

I was very disappointed to see that there were very few vegetarian options - several of the appetizers were vegetarian, but only two of the entrees could even be modified to be vegetarian. One of those two was just the dish cooked as usual, with the lamb shank, then the lamb is taken out just before serving! So it still has the animal broth and fats in, just no physical meat. As we do eat shellfish, we got the giant prawns entree, which was delicious. \n\nService was so-so. I think we were being served by the bartender or a manager. We weren't generally offered things; we had to ask for them, like water, despite the table clearly being set with water glasses. Two of us got drinks (which were very nice,  especially the Persian Martini), but were never offered another. The fallodeh tasted lovely, but, as another reviewer said, was completely hard frozen and difficult to eat.", "author": "Rebecca M."}

The cheese is incredible on its own, but mixed with fresh basil and Persian style flat bread it is truly amazing. \n\nLamb tongue (served with lime juice and a saffron sauce - $15): This was a big hit at our table, everyone loved the rich and flavorful saffron sauce. \n\nLamb brain (served with lime juice and saffron sauce - $15) This is more of an acquired taste. It has the consistency of an egg omelet when you cut it with a knife, yet it acts more like an oyster inside your mouth. I actually preferred the brain to the tongue, but everyone else seem to favor the tongue. \n\nCehlo-Kebab Koobideh (skewer mixture of ground beef and lamb with Persian spices and served with basmati rice - $14.75): Some of the best koobideh I've ever had.

It has warm atmosphere and extremely friendly staff, but also incredibly delicious food.\n    This restaurant has a big variety of good quality Persian food. I love  their appetizers as \"Lamb tongue\", \"Brain\" and of course \"Rocky mountain oysters\". Try one of this dishes and you will not regret it! Talking about entrees you should definitely try the dish calls \"Khorest Fesenjoon\", which is chicken with sweet and sour pomegranate sauce. It has reach pomegranate taste with a little touch of walnuts and spices. All the ingredients together create perfect combination. For dessert order \"Bastani\" (Persian ice-cream). This ice-cream has whole pistachios and rose water. The flavor is something really unique and extremely good, it is hard to describe it. This is something to die for! \n    Honestly all the dishes ( I've tried them all) have nice combinations of flavors, which will transfer you to the Middle Eastern culture.\n    One more tip about this place, it has valet parking, which is really convenient and it is only $10. \n    Definitely will be back to Maykadeh, again and strongly recommend to everyone who is open to experience new flavors.", "author": "Julia T."}

In short this place wasn't worth it especially for the prices that they charge. Upon arrival their valet costs 10 dollars. Which is ridiculous because most places are free, and they literally just reverse back and parked the car right in front of their restaurant. So you basically throw away 10 dollars on that plus some tip. The environment was basic, it was tight inside and the design of the place was mediocre and looked old. We got seated and the menu was given to us (there was 5 of us). You would think that they would ask us quickly what we wanted to drink, but after awhile, nothing. Finally after 10 minutes the waiter asked us what wanted to drink, and good thing we were ready to order too. The food took 35 minutes to get to us which seemed fine since there was 5 of us, however at least three other families that went in after us got their food quickly. After getting the food the staff wouldn't ask how the food was, in fact we were ignored. Not only that we would see the waiter go around talking to the other people who came in. It makes the customer feel awkward because you don't know why they won't come up to us. Now, onto their food. It was really disappointing. My family enjoyed the lamb tongue, however my girlfriend and I didn't like the joojeh kabob (chicken thighs). It was bland, not well seasoned, and it was dry. My dad ordered the lamb (shishlik), and he said it was unseasoned, while the outside was burned and dry, and inside was completely raw. Their kabob koobideh was dry and burned, and it seemed like there was a lot of fillers in it and not enough meat. I've eaten a lot of kabob and this was one of the worst.

In recent years, a number of Persian friends mentioned their favorite Persian restaurant in North Beach, so I finally scoped it out. Although I'm not Persian, I lived in Tehran as a child, so I have strong childhood attachment to certain authentic flavors and dishes. \n\nI can say that on first tasting the Gormeh Sabsi and the Tadig (rice cooked 'til crispy in the bottom of the pan), I was immediately transported back to my youth. There were also platters of roasted, skewered meats--tender and aromatic--and perfectly cooked lamb chops, a cucumber salad with briny feta and honeyed desserts to die for. I wish I could be more specific about each dish we ordered, but I was with a larger party and the platters just kept coming. Despite eating my fill in the first few courses, I couldn't stop tasting, it was that delectable. \n\nAlso, the service was warm and friendly, including a bartender who happily obliged my request for a cold season hot toddy, despite it not being part of his standard repertoire. All in all, Maykadeh was a wonderful experience, and one I can't wait to repeat. Plus, there's valet parking, which makes all the difference when deciding whether to brave the North Beach crowds or not. Two thumbs up!", "author": "Jamie J."}

I have been here many times and tried many things on the menu. \n\nMy go to at any Persian place is the koobideh kabob. It is the standard kabob made from ground beef. Maykadeh makes the best koobideh around. It is perfectly cooked every time, moist, and extremely flavorful. I have never been disappointed with this dish. The saffron rice it comes with is always perfect too. And with a generous helping of two skewers (the standard) you will be sure to not go hungry. \n\nThe sturgeon (seasonal) is utterly amazing here. It is a fish not often seen in cuisine but it is executed exquisitely here. The spices and sauces they use create a burst of flavor in every bite. A dish you must try. \n\nNow lets get a bit more...adventurous. The lamb tongue in saffron sauce was a great dish. The texture of the tongue is a bit odd but once you get passed that the actual flavor is amazing. In a party of 6 nearly everyone absolutely loved the tongue. (one girl apparently didn't get the memo of what it was before trying it and was less than amused when she found out later on during the meal)\n\nLamb brain has to be the most interesting and hard to describe foods I have ever had. When I started eating it the texture was somewhat like an omelette. Then when I tried to describe the taste I was tongue tied. I knew it tasted like something but could not decipher what it was. My friend had the same issue. After a brief discussion he said it tastes like oysters. To this day I think there is a closer flavor that can be used to describe it but I have no clue what it is. So you be the judge, try this delicious meal and tell me what you think it tastes like. \n\nThe service here is excellent. All the waiters are very nice and accommodating. We even added two to our reservation and they didn't just added a table without another word. \n\nThe bar is also chalk full of great drinks and has an extensive menu. \n\nThis place is a definite must.", "author": "Eli Y."}

The tongue was so tender and flavorful.  It was not gamey at all.\n\nSkewered mixture of Certified Angus Beef and leg of lamb, ground daily, onion, Persian spices, Basmati rice - $14.75 - huge oval plate of basmati rice with a grilled tomato and 2 long skewers of tasty meat with juices oozing out.  Hubby liked it a lot and had half of the dish even though it was mine!\n\nLamb shank, baby eggplant braised with tomato, saffron, sun dried lime, Basmati rice - $16 - the meat falls off the bone.  It was tender and very flavorful.\n\nI added a glass of syrah with dinner.

The Filet Mignon is also amazing.  It is of course one of the softest meats and they broil it and add an excellent stroganoff sauce to it that just makes it mouth watery!  \n\nThe atmosphere is very classy looking, but you roll in casual.  The seating is a bit close together, but it's not a huge place so it's understandable.

So last night, we tried Maykadeh.  When we found them on Eat24, we were very excited to try their food, especially since my partner enjoyed Persian food very much but has not had them for a while.  We ordered their lamb tongue appetizer, their chicken kebab (Joojeh) and their lamb shank (Ghorrme Sabzee).  The tongue was the best of the lot!  They were utterly tender and have so much flavor.  The sauce that they came with were also perfect for soaking up either the enormous amount of pita bread or the equally generous amount of basmati rice the orders came with.  The kebabs were our next favorite, with big, moist hunks of chicken and grilled vegetables included.  The lamb shank was not as sought after because the green sauce (we thought it was spinach but there was no mention of that ingredient on their online menu) was too 'grassy' tasting.  My partner, however, was optimistic that it will be more to our liking the next day, when the dish spent a night in the fridge.  Well, she was right of course.  We shared it for lunch today and the dish was better integrated and was thoroughly enjoyable.  \n\nThe delivery service was quite excellent.  Eat24 gave us a delivery estimate of 45-60 mins. and they arrived in about 40 minutes.  The portions were quite large with the aforementioned carbs.  Yes, we liked!", "author": "Yvette F."}

Portion size: When you order kabob koobideh at other restaurants, you have no hope of finishing what's on your plate. At Maykadeh, you pay more and get less on your plate. The quality is no better than that of any other Persian restaurant in Sacramento or Los Angeles.\n\n2. Refills: Soda is overpriced here, and refills cost full price. If you're big on beverages, like me, this is a sore spot.\n\n3. Parking: A $10 valet service doesn't put me in the mood to eat. I understand parking is scare in the big city, but that's why you invest in a lot and make your customers feel welcome with free parking. Other restaurants do it.\n\nThe restaurant does show great customer service in its packaging of to-go orders. Mine had separate containers for the khoresht and rice.

At first glance, the website and catering pictures were beautiful.  I am persian, and so we wanted to have persian food- in particular- we wanted the persian presentation of food.  Sahsa met with us, promised that he would be able to cater our wedding.  He said that he would come up with a menu and let us know by July 5th.  We exchanged e-mail and phone numbers.\n\nTwo weeks went by,  no word.  I had written him on July 5th- just a friendly \"we can't wait to see the menu\".  We called,  he said he had sent the menu - but would resend it in 45 minutes.  I checked our spam folders, junk mail, no menu.  no message.  We called his restaurant for over a week- and still NO RESPONSE.  He never called the second time to see if we had gotten his e-mail he claimed to be sending.\n\nIt seems like something else came up - or he had another plan/ event.  Either that or he is just VERY DISORGANIZED.  \n\nAll in all, it turned out to be everything we feared in going with Persian food for our wedding - lots of empty promises and no follow through.  I mean,  It has now been a month, and we haven't heard a thing from him despite all our messages.  Isn't the polite thing to do - to write an e-mail to say \" sorry, something else came up\"?  or give some explanation.\n\nIt's sad - because we are persian and would love to have delicious persian food at our wedding.  But, why are we as a people so UNRELIABLE?  Why can't we get with the program and do what we say?  Is it too much to ask to be able to rely on having your culture's food at your wedding?\n\nInstead we have found a great caterer, elsewhere.

Let's start with the staple, basmati rice.  The rice was slightly overcooked and didn't have the wonderful, rich flavoring that many other Persian restaurants in California bring to the table, but the portions were hearty.  \n\nThe fesenjan was simply delicious.  The tartness of the pomegranate distinguished the Maykadeh recipe, though I would have liked to have some more bite from the walnuts.  The chicken was cooked to perfection.  Still on the bone, it fell off easily and nearly melted in my mouth.  \n\nThe ash was tasty.  It had a wonderful texture that wasn't too runny or too saturated with beans.  As ashes go, it was mild and bland but a perfect complement to the meal.\n\nI ordered gorme sabzi as well, but that will be my lunch at work tomorrow!  \n\nFinally, the doogh.  Not bad for home-made doogh.  As a personal preference, I like doogh with carbonation (call it my Americo-centric, cabonation-happy existence) but the mint, spices and yogurt more than made up for the lack and provided just the right amount of bitterness to make it drinkable.  \n\nAll in all, a fine job.  \n\nThe price....well, let's leave that for another day!", "author": "cashburton A."}

My knowledge of Persian food consisted of home-cooked meals at friends' houses in high school (so their food was  legit, but my knowledge of it was certainly still quite rudimentary), but Maykadeh impressed me because it felt like I was eating a home-cooked meal.  Is it cheesy to say that the atmosphere (though table-clothed and sophisticated) made it feel like a family affair?\n\nFirst of all they bring out a plate with fresh basil, feta cheese, raw onion and bread.  Being completely unsure of what to do, I pretty much just went for it.  A little cheese and basil on the bread.  Then a little onion with the cheese on the bread.  endless combos.  Funny though, being on a date, I had to think twice about digging into the raw onion, but i figured if we were both eating it then our onion breath would cancel out.  \n\nwe got some eggplant based appetizer which I thought was incredibly delicious.  I then got the ground beef and lamb kebab which was also very flavorful.  I wish I had been hungrier to begin the meal because I couldn't finish my dinner, but it was all so good.  \n\nI really should go back and educate myself more on Persian cuisine. In terms of the food, ambiance, and service, it was a lovely experience.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

We ordered the Breast Kabob (chicken), Chelo-Kabob Koobideh (ground lamb and beef), Shirazi Salad. When the food arrived I was stunned how great the preparation was and really felt like Maykadeh took pride in the product they sent out for deivery. The best part of it all was the servings were so large that we now have lunch for the following day. I will definitely check this place out again soon.", "author": "Deepak K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-11-08", "description": "Honestly, I think this place gets way more credit than is due. I'm pretty sure most of that credit is because it's the only 'real' Persian restaurant in San Francisco. \n\nSure there are places in Berkeley and even farther east, but we all know Persians love to get dressed up in head-to-toe black leather, drenched in Chanel No 5, hop into their black Mercedes' (not before donning their Chanel sunglasses, no matter what time of day or night) and drive to The City, only to arrive en masse, to dinner at 11:45pm (which happens to be precisely 3 hours past the time agreed on by all participating parties). Plus, nobody will be impressed if you went to dinner in Danville.\n\nAnyways, the food here is decent - not great, not bad, just decent. Add to the equation that the dishes are grossly overpriced, and it brings it down to just 'okay' for me.\n\nAnd yes, the waiters talk smack about the customers in front of them, but we're Persians here - that's normal. In fact, if you're NOT being talked about, then you should worry.\n\nAs Jason R. says, befriend a Persian and try some real food. Who decided that kabob was the national food of Iran anyways??? I nominate tahdig. If you don't like it, wash off your Drakkar Noir and get thee to a post office to have your 'Persian' card revoked.\n\n3 stars. If you are desperate for Persian food and have no Persian friends, go to Saks and hang out in the Gucci section for a while and make some new Irooni friends, or give up!\n\nNote: Beware of the bathroom - it's all black porcelain, which makes it seem like you might fall in at any moment and get flushed away into an abyss....", "author": "Ahu S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-29", "description": "My love affair with Persian food started when I lived in Long Beach many years ago. There's quite a Persian population down south, so finding a Persian restaurant wasn't too hard. So my experience with the cuisine encompasses a number of establishments. \n\nI've dined at Maykadeh quite a few times over the years, and it's on par with what I like in Persian cuisine. My mom's not Persian (surprise!)  so I have no idea what is truly authentic. But my Persian friends say this place is one of best...I have to say, I like it better than Alborz (on Van Ness) and Darya (Costa Mesa), both of which have a loyal following. \n\nMost notable differences between this place and others is that their meats are tender, flavorful and moist. Many places tend to overcook the chicken and the ground meats are a bit on the dry side. The koobideh (ground meat) is excellent whether you choose lamb or beef. The lamb dishes are definitely recommended and are not gamey. Filet Mignon proved tasty and tender. And the rice had the right texture, flavored with the usual saffron. One of my favorites is their little baby chicken...I don't know if it's really a baby chicken, but that's what I call it. It's served whole and is definitely worth having.\n\nI did have dessert tonight, which I usually skip, because I'm usually stuffed from the sizeable dishes offered here. Both the flan and rosewater poached pears and ice cream proved themselves worth the calories. \n\nMaykadeh's atmosphere invites a bit of lingering after dinner. Modern Persian music plays in the background, and as the sun goes down, the lights strewn around the trees outside cast a nice ambiant light into the comfortable dining area....nice place for our girls night out, the birthday party next to us, and the kissy kissy couple in the corner.", "author": "Virg Y."}

It's a shame to see that in the persian community. Iranians don't take criticisms very well that's why so many persians don't say anything but tell everyone they know not to go back to a place and that will be the end of that business.

It took us a while to find where Maykadeh was tucked away in the North Beach area -- luckily we were saved from another 30 minutes of wandering about by a very handsome French-speaking gentleman... ^_^\n\nMaykadeh is well appointed and its clientele were hip (the young man at the next table had the new iPhone) and well dressed.  The wait staff was attentive -- our water glasses were kept filled -- and our silverware and plates replaced after each course.  Our waiter caught our eye on the first attempt, so every need was met promptly and efficiently.\n\nWe started with pita bread onto which we spread feta cheese and butter, and inserted basil leaves and sweet onion.  Now, if you told K, here, eat this basil leaf and a slice of raw onion, she would have slugged you.  But the atmosphere must have tamed her because she ate the pita wraps, and she liked it enough to go for thirds.  We sampled Kashke Bademjan, a warm spread made out of eggplant, and Ghorme sabzee, lamb cooked in onions, chives and lentils, over crispy rice.\n\nWe were so full after our Breast Kebab, Sirloin Kebabs and Ground meat Kebabs -- which were well seasoned with a hint of citrus -- that we didn't have room for dessert.

Even better and more moist was the Joojeh Kebab (boneless chicken thighs marinated in saffron, onion and lime juice).

Truthfully, I tend to associate North Beach with Italian restaurants, strip clubs, and pubs - and not much else (except maybe Citizen Thai and the Monkey).  However, now, much to my surprise, I've learned there is an excellent Persian restaurant in the hood too. \n\nSo here is all you really need to know about the place: \n\nThe interior is posh looking.  You'll look around and start to worry that maybe entrees will run you $30+ a pop - but you'd be wrong.  From my memory all the entrees here ranged between $13 for a delicious meat/lamb combo to $27 for an excellent steak.  From my perspective, these are reasonable prices for a \"nice\" meal out.  \n\nSpeaking of the food - it is excellent.  I tried the lamb/combo dish that I previously mentioned, and it was delicious.  I also had a little of the chicken skewers, and can tell you that they were also great.  Additionally, though I can't say I've tried it myself, I've been told that the baby chicken receives the highest recommendations.  \n\nAnother reason to check this place out for dinner is because they serve you a basket full of delicious pita bread with onion, feta, and basil with your dinner.  \n\nFinally, the staff here was super friendly.  Not only was the wait staff attentive, but the host (who may have been a manager or owner actually - and I believe his name was John) was very, very friendly and checked with us from time to tim to see how we were doing.  \n\nSummary: high end (but casual) ambiance, moderate prices, excellent staff together makes this a great place to bring your family when they visit or a nice place to impress a date.", "author": "Matthew H."}

FYI now parsi just means persian) \r\n\r\nBeautiful photographs on the walls of Iran and its people.

Walked in the restaurant and I saw the waiter taking sips of wine behind the counter.  We were seated to our table and when I looked back I saw another waiter sipping wine behind the counter.  They looked like lushes, that was a turn off.  This is the first time I have encountered that  at a restaurant and I must say that it is very unprofessional.  \n\nWe ordered the chicken breast and lamb and both dishes were okay, I've had better persian food.  I would probably not come back to this restaurant again because of the difficult parking and the lush waiters.", "author": "Amanda N."}

Valet service is available and you should take the offer as North Beach Parking can be a nightmare.  I was a rookie to Persian cuisine at the time and knew nothing about it.  I would have gave it 3 stars but the table didn't think it was that great compared to the normal restaurants in  Tehrangeles or Orange County.  If this was the best SF had to offer than it was mediocre at best because it didn't live up to the hype.   We ordered shish Kebab, Joojeh Kebab, Khoresht Fesenjoon, and dough.

Everything, from service to ambiance to the food is a ten.  I have dined at many Persian restaurants and this is the absolute best and most authentic.  My mouth is watering now, just thinking about their food.  It is a great date venue.  You would not be out of place dining in black tie or in processional casual attire.  It is one of the few restaurants I frequent that is just as good a place for lunch as it is for dinner.  It is a real destination place, not just a place to grab a meal before doing something else.

After having tried it out, I would rate it as one of the 2 best places in the Bay Area for braised lamb shank (the other being Silk Road @ Walnut Creek). $16 is a fairly reasonable price to pay for a good lamb shank, but what made it really worth it is the quality of the dish and the complimentary plate of basil leaves with some very good goat cheese. It really made my day!

However, this place offers Valet Parking for $8, which is worth every penny to me, especially when the car was out front when we were done!\r\n\r\nWe arrived with no reservation around 8:30-9:00 and were immediately seated at a table that featured a corner booth covered in Persian pillows. We were then brought some pita bread with Feta Cheese, a Half Onion and Basil. Now this may seem strange, but trust me, making little sandwiches with these ingredients was fantastic, and really could be considered an appetizer!\r\n\r\nWe started out with a bottle of wine that was brought promptly and my glass never got empty. In fact, the waiter paced the meal perfectly so the wine ended when the meal ended, a feat not so easily done, and usually never even attempted at most places. We only noticed because larger parties were coming in after us and getting their food before us, so the waiter came over and told us that he was pacing us. Very Cool.\r\n\r\nWe started out with the Kashke Bademjan - Eggplant with mint garlic sauce - $6.50. It was an average appetizer that I would not get again. We wish we had gotten then Mat-o-Khiar - Homemade Yogurt and Cucumber.\r\n\r\nFor dinner I got the Shish - Kebab - Fillet of Lamb marinated in lime juice, saffron, onion, olive oil, vegetables and Basmati rice. - $21.00. While it was good, it was not spectacular.\r\n\r\nI liked the restaurant, I like the service, and the food was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-10-09", "description": "Let me preface this review that most of the star deduction is based on service rather than food quality and I will address each.\n\nSERVICE:  My girlfriend was running late and they were actually okay with me just sitting down and waiting as the place wasn't that busy.  As soon as I sat down, the waiter was in my face asking for a drink order.  After I told him that water would be fine and I would like to look at the wine list, he appeared snobbish and left.  After I actually had time to _look_ at the wine list, I ordered my glass of wine.  After my date arrived, she then ordered a glass of wine and never got it.  Luckily, they do pour their glasses fairly full so we were able to share.  The food came out so quickly I was wondering if it was pre-made.  After we ate, we waited patiently (about 30 minutes) for the waiter to get back to us.  He was in and out of the restaurant talking to a cab driver.  I didn't understand that at all, but it wasn't just that.  He was serving other tables just fine, just not ours.  We were patient and didn't speak up.  I thought he may be busy, which is fine...but oh wait.  There he goes again, outside to speak to a cab driver.   I didn't know this restaurant did drive-thru.  I gave him a 15% tip.  I'm WAY too nice sometimes.\n\nFOOD:  Granted, I've never had Persian/Iranian food before, but my Fillet Mignon was WAY too dry.  There was no sauce.  The description said it was to be cut in thin slices.  It looked as thought the chef quickly ran his knife, dull edge down, along the top of the well done (I asked for medium) piece of meat.  Fairly unacceptable for $24.  My date's lamb shank with eggplant was very tender, and the sauce was wonderful.  If it weren't for that, this review would have been one star.\n\nCONCLUSION:  I rarely give bad reviews.  You REALLY have to screw up.  I just felt as though I was ignored, served leftovers, and pushed aside for priority service to a drive-thru.  If that were the case, I guess I could have gone to In-N-Out Burger.  I might have gotten a better piece of beef.", "author": "Chris M."}

Even the supervisor did his share of work, including serving ice cream, instead of just delegating work to his employees.  \nAppetizsers I tried were the Salad Shirazi, Salad Olovieh, Kashk-e-bademjoon, lamb with pepper, chicken kubideh, and mast-o-khiar.  They even made a few dishes that weren't persian, but were good.....like a korean noodle salad. \nMain Courses that I tried were Shirin Polo w/ Chicken, gheymeh, bademjoon, kubideh, and two types of chicken kabab.  The things that stood out for me were the koobideh, green salad (w/ feta cheese), and a salmon dish that I hadn't had before, but it was salmon, spinach, and cheese in a pastry bread.....at least i think it was....but i was drunk by the time the meal was served.  I didn't try the ghorme-sabzi because of the dangerous aftersmell the chambalileh leaves in your pores.  \nOnly thing that I thing is that they didn't have cream for the coffee they served.  I'm not a coffee drinker, but my gf  had to settle for coffee w/o cream, she did say their coffee served was very good though.  \nAs far as the desert goes, i'm not big on sweets, especially persian sweets, so I left the faludeh, bastani, and pastries alone. \nBest persian wedding catering I've seen so far, and I've been to a lot of weddings.", "author": "Ocee D."}

The restaurant is located in residential/ commercial neighborhood so parking is a hassle. I drove around with hope of finding a parking but that effort was futile. Eventually i ended up using their valet service which costs $10. \nthe restaurant had nice decor and great sitting arrangements. The host was friendly and seated us right away. Must say reservation is really not necessary there. The menu has tons of lamb, chicken and beef entrees initially making my carnivorous stomach very happy. \nBeing clueless as to what lamb entree to eat, i asked the server for recommendation and landed with Shishlek (lamp chops) \nThey serve a house appetizer which includes raw onion, mint leave and Feta cheese with bread. I have never eaten raw onion and mint leaves in appetizer but i am not a Persian either. The food was avg. The lamb was mildly spiced, tender and juicy. It was definitely cooked to perfection as it is really easy to over cook lamb. I enjoyed eating the lamb but I didn't eat much of the sides ( veges and rice) as they weren't too flavorful or appealing. Veges had the soogy overcooked look. \nThe server forgot about the table after serving food. No follow up on how the food was or if we need any thign else until we were and i had to pay the bill on my way out. Actually the funny thing is they would have let me walk out for free If i hadn't ask for the bill. Yes, the staff really lost it in the end. \nAll in all, I found the restaurant pricey.", "author": "Hasham Y."}

The first time I ordered the Ghorme Sabzee (Lamb shank cooked in finely chopped onion,leek, scallions, chives & herbs, dried lime, Basmati rice) - and the lamb was nice, tender, and did not at all land in your stomach like a rock. And we all know that lamb can be a hit or miss meat. The second time I ordered the Poussin \n(Baby chicken with all the bones marinated in onion, saffron,\nlime juice, vegetables and Basmati rice). The lime juice helps keep the chicken moist and tender - so you are not chewing on tough meat. I topped it off with a nice cup of hot Persian tea.

I finally flagged the waiter down to get his attention that we can't start till everyone got their food.  It is unfortunate since 4 other people in our party that  got chicken had similar experience.  Two people in our party ordered ground beef kabob that were burned ( pitched black) and when we complained instead of simple apology the manager claimed that specific kabob has to be like that otherwise it will be uncooked.

The appetizer itself - fresh pita, mint, leaves, onion - is filling and tasty.   Ambience is excellent. Service is generally good.  The safron flavored koobideh kabob is great.  Prices are quite reasonable.  great formula for success.", "author": "Marco P."}

Main course was brought quickly and dropped on table well before appetizer had been finished. As a result table was way crowded and we had to hurry in order to finish appetizer so that main course would not become cold. Check was dropped off with out asking if we were interested in dessert/coffee etc...We felt they just wanted to turn the table. Baklava was extremely dry and I would pass on this. Additionally, in attempting to pay, we were informed the restaurant does not accept AMEX cards. No where was this disclosed up front. What would happen if we had no other form of payment?", "author": "Denis B."}

I remembered the food as being fantastic, a real treat in north beach since I've only had a few meals there that I actually enjoyed (too many tourist traps if you ask me).\n\nThe most recent time we went, the food definitely lived up to our expectations. I had a chicken kabob that was well cooked (not dry at all) with some really great vegetables on the side. I also had a cup of great coffee which stood in for one of their deserts (I will say they looked fantastic).\n\nThis place is definitely worth a visit!", "author": "Avid E."}

The fesenjoon (which is supposed to be a little sweet and a little sour) was plain bitter.  The kashk-bademjahn (whey and eggplant) was not bad, but was so small I felt like I needed another one.  I think the food was prepared days before it was served.  \n\nThe waitstaff was lackluster and at times, rude.  \n\nIf you want Persian food, try Alborz, or, if you want to travel outside of the city, Shalizar.", "author": "d v."}

Ordered koobideh kabob, which I thought was below average.\nAsked the waiter if I could change it to some other dish. The owner came over and gave me hell with his eyes and words for not liking his koobideh. Might I say, he was very rude. 16 years of dinning in bay area have not seen such rude treatment.\n\nInterestingly,  I visited their SJ location for dinner last month; it was closed! the window sign said: \" closed for remodeling,  see you soon\".  Later I found out it is closed for good due to lack of customer service. Dooh!\n\nIn any event, we won't be going back anytime soon, as don't want our evening to be ruined again.", "author": "P L."}

Unfortunately, the dinners (beef filet kabob and chicken kabob) were overpriced.  The chicken was dry and overcooked.  The black delivery boxes were filled primarily with white rice, then one broiled tomato, part of a broiled onion and a reasonable portion of each protein.  The eggplant/feta cheese appetizer was the only semi-acceptable part of the meal.  It is the first and last time that we will be visiting or ordering from this restaurant in our neighborhood.", "author": "Marlene W."}

My shattered memory tells me that we had a good meal and an enjoyable time.  How disappointed I was on my return!  The atmosphere is still lovely, but the food (compared to other Persian and Middle Eastern restaurants in the Bay Area) is mediocre and the service is atrocious.  We had two servers, both Chinese, whose English was almost unintelligible and one of whom, when asked how to approach the appetizer of onion/feta/basil/radish, said \"Eat it.\"  When we asked the other about ordering the Feta Spread appetizer (thinking it was something spreadable), she said, \"it' same as what you have but also tomato.\"  We ordered a hummus appetizer which was truly unpalatable.  Our entrees, a lamb dish and a chicken dish, were not remarkable although the rice was superb.  It was funny when the server brought out the entrees before the appetizer plates were cleared; she stood staring at the tiny, cluttered table before asking us to hold the entree dishes!  I will try Alborz next and give this a pass in the future.", "author": "Barbara C."}

Too bad they thought they wouldn't be able to make more because they were running out of mint. okay food, inconsistent service, more mint please.", "author": "eve e."}

I guess we are used to our Los Angeles Persian Restaurants with the big plates and reasonable prices.  We definitely have had better and tastier Persian kabob's before.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-29", "description": "We've been customers for almost 20 years now. Walked in yesterday and were seated next to a large party of Russians who brought a few small children with them. Never mind the noise every other patron had to endure from this crowd, their children were given free reign of our corner (by the window) and were more than a nuisance and eventually their balloons ended up in my wife's face. She yet again reminded the kids to stick close to their parents and yet again asked the mother to keep  better watch of her brood. I then chimed in to tell the mother she needs to either take much better care of her kids or simply leave them at home at which he got offended I had the balls to even suggest such a thing. Her husband then got into the the act after 2 of his friends bleeted something in my direction, physical threats were made (not that I was scared in any way, I've seen their ilk plenty before), and as anyone can imagine our family dinner was more than ruined. What is more upsetting than that is that the 2 owners and their wait staff made a quick disappearing act in the kitchen while all of this took place instead of stepping in and doing what's right. In the end, we were presented with a bill and not even an apology of any sort save, ll this while the entire dinner experience was more than bad (save for food, which was good as usual). Can't even give them a one star at this point and can't recommend this place to anyone any longer, this after almost 2 decades of patronizing the place and bringing them lots of new customers and business. Never mind their head waiter was his usual self, filling just my beer glass while not doing the same for my daughter, not placing a small appetizer plate for her, taking my plate as I was still consuming my main course, etc, etc, etc. While I used to overlook such transgressions in years past this last visit coupled with the waiter's disappearing act when he was supposed to be there first and foremost to control things was something that cannot be overlooked. The only reason the place didn't end up looking like a Wild West Saloon is due to me deciding not to escalate things past the point of no return, and no other reason at all, we were there for a family outing. Should we have called the cops and empty out the place? In hind sight, absolutely! No paying patron deserves less service than others and safety is the key importance to anyone, IMO.", "author": "Greg P."}
