Although we had a reservation for the later evening, the restaurant remained crowded until past 9PM. I appreciated the ambiance, but I felt like it was a little too loud inside (though that may have just been the result of a large group seated near us). \n\nWe were pleased to find that there was a separate selection of vegetarian options, and I was also impressed to see the general variety offered; the menu had everything from classics like chicken and pork to rarities like alligator and rabbit. For appetizers, we ordered the egg rolls and the house green salad. The former was average, but I really enjoyed the salad; it had fried tofu and a slightly nutty dressing that were both great additions to the salad. Then, we ordered the spicy tofu, pad kee mow, and yellow curry (since the red and green curries both had fish sauce, which is not vegetarian). The spicy tofu was soft but could have been more flavorful -- didn't seem like it had been marinated. I liked the pad kee mow as well, but I wasn't a big fan of the yellow curry because of its slightly sweet aftertaste. \n\nPros: very fast service, fairly large quantities (especially of white rice)\nCons: loud restaurant, slightly expensive, food of average quality \n\nWould visit again if I was in the area, but would not go out of my way to revisit.", "author": "Kamu P."}

I liked it, but there were people who were falling over themselves over it. The exceedingly boring Andrew Zimmern was raving about it on one of his food travel shows. It was definitely better than most by-the-numbers Thai spots, and I remember clearly how well they prepared pork belly in a couple of their winning dishes. Well, I found myself on 16th Street looking for lunch but not exactly sure what. When I saw the signage for Lers Ros Thai, I knew it would probably be good if memory served me correctly, but it wasn't the culinary nirvana that I was hoping for.\n\nThe magic was discernibly missing from my experience. First things first, I entered waiting for someone to serve me. After about five minutes, a cheerful server led me to the table next to the front window since the lunch rush had already passed through. After another couple of minutes, a more senior server interrogated me about why I was at such a prime table to which I quivered and told her that her colleague led me there. She left without apology and let the first server take care of me. Not a great start. The clear deal to get was the $12.95 Combo Lunch Special where you have your choice from a list of sixteen items.\n\nI decided on the Kai Yang (BBQ Marinated Chicken) and the Green Curry. A house salad came with the special, and it was a refreshing start (photo: http://bit.ly/2MYhJs4). My main plate arrived soon after, and I saw the Kai Yang, but I didn't get the Green Curry. I got the Pad Pak Ruam Mit, a small bowl filled with stir-fried mixed vegetables and tofu in bean sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2wjjHtA). I pointed out the lapse to the server who appeared fearful to take the plate back to the kitchen. I relented and told her I'll keep the Pad Pak, which was fine if somewhat bland. So all in all, the price was good as were the flavors and the portions. But man, where was the love...and respect?\n\nFOOD - 3.5 stars...good if somewhat bland flavors but it would have been better if they got my order right\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...it was a nice table but it would have been nice to feel like I deserved it\nSERVICE - 2 stars...a series of miscommunications \nTOTAL - 3 stars...yep, definitely not my previously fond memory of Lers Ros Thai\n\nRELATED - Looking for other dining options in the Mission?

I have never had to wait to be seated, unlike some other local places, and the food comes relatively fast. Their coconut curry is one of my favorites to have alongside their fried chicken over rice. \nWhile dining it has felt a little chaotic due to a lot of food service pickups (like postmates) running back and forth from the front of the restaurant to the back.

There was the added pressure of my mom being in town and we wanted her to explore something new. After some deliberation we landed on thai, and of course lers ros was our first choice. It is centrally located in the lively mission a few blocks away from the hustle and bustle of valencia street. \n\nWe started off with a chicken soup. It really prepped us for the main course as it was very warm and creamy. It had different notes that were very reminiscent of ginger. It was both soulful and refreshing. Our selected protein was chicken. \n\nWe then proceeded to our entrees. It was my mom's first time, so she made a safe choice and picked the chicken in peanut sauce. I picked the venison. And the other party picked the alligator. The venison and the alligator had the same base of condiments with the exception that the venison had coconut milk. This made it simmer a little better and the gamy taste of venison was muted with tropical notes. What I didn't like was that both the alligator and the venison were a little chewy/rubbery, so I wouldn't order that plate again. However,  the flavors were on point. The chicken was cooked to perfection. \n\nI would described the ambience of this place as rustic luxe. It feels very high class and like a lounge. However, the dark tones, wood accents, and exceptional staff make it warm and welcoming. If you are ever in the mood for thai, consider lers ors! Next time I come i will order the green curry, it sounded like it would be my favorite thing. Let me know if you order it first.", "author": "Emmanuel T."}

This restaurant is located in the Mission, and there is a stylish yet minimalist vibe to the place.  I went there for a weekday lunch, and it looked like I entered before a busy crowd could develop.  My waiter was friendly and quickly took my order.\n\nThey have an extensive lunch menu that includes rice plates, and I decided to try their Kha Na Moo Krob.  The pork was had a perfectly crispy exterior while maintaining the tender and juicy pork interior, and I enjoyed the crunch of the saut\u00e9ed Chinese broccoli.  The dish came with a house salad that had a tangy dressing; it was light but ultimately, the salad did not leave much of an impact during the meal.  Overall, my visit reminded me of how much Lers Ros serves delectable Thai food in San Francisco, and I would happily visit any of their three locations again.", "author": "Keith H."}

Came here on a Monday evening around 645pm and there was no wait and a good amount of empty tables. It did get busier about 30 minutes later.  \n\nMy friend and I ordered the pad ka prow(crispy pork belly with Thai basil), the barbeque chicken with sweet and sour sauce, and their tom yum noodles which was on their special menu.\n\nMost of the dishes were pretty lack luster.  The noodles were alright. The pad ka prow was doused in sauce and ended up super salty when eating it on its own; it might have been better if you had a bowl of rice to soak up some of the flavor and saltiness.  The crispiness of the pork skin also was lost because of the overdose of sauce which was pretty disheartening too since that is the best part.\n\n The worst dish we got was the chicken. It came with 2 breast and 2 drumsticks.  The chicken looked visually appealing but was dry and flavorless. The sauce it came with could not save it. It just was not good.\n\nMaybe it was the dishes we ordered, but there wasn't anything impressive about this place.

On a few separate occasions, the pork and beef were a really poor cut with a lot of fat and tendons. For the price and upscale-ish vibe, it's pretty disappointing. \n\nHowever, the Tom Kha Kai (coconut soup with chicken) is delicious. It comes to the table simmering over a flame and has nice oyster mushrooms in it, so we really only come here anymore for this one dish. \n\nThe servers have always been very nice, but they do a kind of group system where one person takes your order, someone else brings the food, and yet another person might check in on you later. It's not necessarily bad, but kind of awkward to not know who's covering our table or who to ask for the check.", "author": "Lara K."}

I picked Thai and we landed on Lers Ros. I liked the food at the Tenderloin location, so we decided to try the Mission location. It was Sunday, March 20th and we ordered delivery through Caviar. Placed the order at 7:26pm and it arrived at 9:05pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\nPrices below are what I paid using Caviar. Compared to the online menu on their site, the sides of rice were priced the same. Everything else was priced higher by only $0.05 per item.\n\n*Tom Yum - Hot and Sour Soup: Traditional spicy and sour soup ($12), Shrimp (+$3)\n*Papaya Salad: Shredded green papaya salad with chili, tomatoes, and lime based salad dressing, Extra spicy ($10), with Raw crab (+$1)\n*Larb Pork, Chicken, Duck or Tofu: Chili powder and lime based salad dressing ($9), Duck: A chunk of roasted duck mixed with rice powder (+$3)\n*Green Curry: Medium spicy green curry with Thai eggplant, bamboo shoot, red bell peppers, and kaffir lime leaves, Does not include rice, Extra spicy ($12), Chicken (+$1)\n*Pad Thai: Traditional Thai style pan-fried rice noodles, No crushed peanut ($10), add Chicken (+$1)\n*Lek Tom Yum Haeng - Dry Tom Yum Noodle: Steamed skinny rice noodle with ground pork, slice fish cake, plain crispy pork belly serving with an idea of dry tom yum noodle ($11)\n*Brown Rice ($2)\n*Jasmine White Rice ($1.50)\n\nI just ordered the papaya salad and duck larb. The salad was good, but it could have been a bit spicier, saltier and fisher. I love papaya salad with a strong contrast in flavors. It was actually better the next day because the flavors developed. I enjoyed the larb, but I found it too salty. I added a bunch of sambal to try and balance it out. The roommate knows I love a nice spicy green curry so he ordered that. It was creamy with lots of chicken, bamboo, mushrooms, etc. For being extra spicy, I wanted more of a kick, but it had great flavors. Went well with my brown rice. The soup had coconut milk in it which made it a little more mellow than I'd like. It cut into the heat which I didn't necessarily want. The pad thai looked bland, but surprisingly had great flavor. The noodles also had a nice chew. I didn't try dry tom yum, but the roommate seemed to enjoy it.\n\nI was tempted to order the fish dish I love, but I refrained as it's huge. I also adore their pork shoulder. Even though I remember the dishes at the TL location being bolder in flavors, this Lers Ros location still served some solid dishes.", "author": "Elena N."}

We had a bunch of drinks at ABV across the street and needed some carbs...\n\nWe went with some of our go-to dishes:\n1. Neur yang: grilled beef - really intense flavor with a nice char (without being dry.) The dressing on the side is really good, too \n2. Pad Thai with chicken: this hit the spot. It's a bit on the sweet side, though \n3. Tom yum soup: with shrimp; we asked for it without coconut milk. This was super fragrant, served in a heated pot, very umami (I want to salivate thinking about the flavor)\n4.

Ended up with the following:\n+ Pork shoulder appetizer. So moist and flavorful. That side sauce was great too.\n+ Shrimp paste fried rice w/ salted egg. Holy crap was this good. This had a kick to it thanks to the peppers. It was so much food that we couldn't finish and took it home.\n+ Lek tom yum haeng (the dry tom yum noodles). The photos made it look small, but it's actually a decent portion...it's just served in a bigass bowl. Definitely a must-order if it's available - it's a really unique, sweet & savory dish.\n\nThe servers were all so nice and helpful.

Just like the other locations, the Lers Ros on 16th St has elegant and modern decor, and most importantly, authentic and clean Thai flavors.\n\nI came here for dinner with a group of four and our tastebuds were in for quite a treat! We started our with two appetizers--the grilled pork shoulder, which was perfectly spiced and served with a savory dark sauce that rounded out the flavors perfectly, and the som tum papaya salad with raw crab. The papaya salad was one of the spiciest (and tastiest) I've ever had--it was cooled down by the tomato and green beans, as well as the raw cabbage leaves on the side. The raw crab was also amazing and had the perfect amount of funky flavor to it!\n\nAnd then came our main courses--we had the Lek Tom Yum Haeng, a rice noodle dish that came in a spicy sauce and was served along pork belly, pork slices, ground pork, and fish cake. Though this dish seems very simple, the combination of flavors is unbelievable, and even the texture of the noodles is worth writing home about! We also had the green curry with chicken, which was perfect in every way--the white meat chicken was amazingly tender, and the vegetables and curry had such great flavor. The curry did not have a muddled taste (as some curries that are overcooked do)--each of the elements were distinct, but they each came together to make a single delicious dish. Third, we had the prawn and asparagus stir-fry; while this was a fairly typical Thai stir-fry and not a particularly creative dish, it was executed absolutely perfectly--the vegetables were all fresh and cooked just the right amount, while the stir-fry sauce was not overpoweringly salty.\n\nThe last main course dish we had was the star of the show--the steamed black bass. It was a whole fish served in a hot pot (which was in the shape of a fish!) with a flame underneath to keep it warm. The bass was tender and juicy, but the real stand out element of this dish was the citrusy, lemony broth the fish was cooked in. I don't know what it was about it that paired so well with the fish, but it was absolutely irresistible and definitely my favorite dish of the night. \n\nOverall, Lers Ros was an absolutely fantastic Thai restaurant with super authentic dishes that were all perfectly executed and had very clean flavors. I will definitely be coming back in the future to sample more of their huge selection!", "author": "David K."}

I first tried it at the San Francisco Street Food Festival. Khao mun gai is one of the most basic Thai street foods, and it was so good, so nostalgic, that I had to go to the restaurant. \n\nThe place was empty on a Friday night. So empty that the servers were borderline too attentive. This doesn't really mean anything to me, though, because delivery boys were running in and out with take out all night (which sounds like the pretty standard Netflix and chill Friday night to me). \n\nWe tried the Lek Tom Yum Haeng (dry rice noodles with pork and chicken) and the duck red curry. The noodles were weird initially... and then after a few more bites they immediately became one of the top 3 foods I would take to a deserted island. Delicious. Highly recommended.\n\nThe duck curry- good. Thai curry is pretty much always good. Not to much to say about this one. \n\nChicken satay- also good, pretty standard. Even though the chicken was cut pretty thinly, I felt like it was lacking a little bit of flavor from the marinate.

Do it.  You won't regret it.\n\nI am a green papaya salad super fan.  Here, I preferred Som Tom with shrimp to the version with raw crab.  You might feel differently.  The very small crabs were hard to deal with unless one used fingers and got super sticky.  Then, the amount of flavor added didn't seem worth the mess plus effort.  One can eat the soft-ish shells.  I did that  a bit.  Probably increased my calcium that meal.  Talk about crunch!!\n\nMedium spicy hit the spot for us.  We like pretty damn spicy, so, unless you're actually accustomed to the insane levels of heat in Thailand itself, I recommend staying away from \"hot\".   For others who crave that pain-so-good feeling chili provides, give medium a try with an appetizer and adjust your ordering of main courses as you feel right right.\nNote:  If you're palate is up to twice as spice-friendly as the average American, stick with mild.  \n\nLers Ros' green curry never disappoints.  Neither do other colors of curry, but there's something about that mix of sweet, salt, and spice in this green version that tickles my taste receptors just right.\n\nVegetable dishes: try them all.   Every single one is full of fantastic flavors.\n\nNote: actual vegans and vegetarians beware fish sauce that is likely hard to avoid.  I'm not sure that you can trust any statements about any dishes lacking this ingredient; perhaps Lers Ros, as a pretty darn sophisticated outfit, does get the needs of those who avoid all fish and other animal products, but you had better take some extra steps to ensure you can order dishes that are truly 100% vegan/vegetarian before coming here and finding disappointment.\n\nPlenty of beer [ none on tap :-(  ] and delicious wines available.\n\nNot a cheap Thai joint -- but you get at least as much as you pay for.

Definitely skip the usual pad thai and pad see ew and go with raved about favs like the duck larb, stir fried pork belly, and/or grilled pork shoulder. They do use MSG but will leave it out upon request which we did.\n\nI always order Keh Moo Yang: Grilled Pork Shoulder ($9.95) when I visit Lers Ros so just had to order it here: http://bit.ly/1lW0yEB. The pork shoulder was rich and tender but lacking in execution compared to their TL location. It was missing a good sear and the slight crispy exterior. If you never tried the original, it would suffice though.\n\nFor our entrees, we decided to go with dishes exclusive to their Mission location. The Beef Pad Prik: Stir-fried beef w/ Thai black pepper & onions ($13.95) had really good flavor and peppery kick but the mandingo sized beef slices could barely fit in my mouth: http://bit.ly/NtvM6U (it's hard to tell in the pic but trust me, these slices were not mouth-friendly). We had to share a knife to cut the beef into 3-4 smaller more manageable pieces. Another dish exclusive to this location was the Pad Phed Venison ($21.95) which was also my fav of the night: http://bit.ly/1iGcq8S. The venison was lean and tender and the sauce had an intense depth of flavor from the red curry, chilies and galanga. I loved the addition of coconut milk for a creamy finish. The brown rice really soaked up all that yummy sauce.\n\nAgainst Mr. NSS wishes, I ordered the Durian dessert w/ sticky coconut rice ($5.50). Even before the dish arrived, I could smell the cringe-inducing, intoxicating scent of durian fill the room and see the stank eyes on our table when it was delivered to us. I usually love this disgustingly delicious custardy fruit but this dessert was just awful: http://bit.ly/1eNARk2. The fragrant coconut sticky rice was fine but the durian was gross because it was served hot. That's like serving cheesecake hot. Who does that?\n\nService was typical of an Asian restaurant. Some of the waitresses were passive because of the language barrier but are accommodating as long as you get their attention.\n\nOne of my biggest gripes were their plates. Not only were they huge, clunky and took up a lot of room on the table, they made the presentation of the food look sloppy. For some of the dishes, the food seemed to be just thrown on top of the plate like in the last 3 seconds of a Chopped round. When you're paying $80 for Thai food for two (pre-tip), presentation should at least be clean. That's just me being nit-picky though. \n\nLers Ros' original TL location is still the best but the Mission location at least has the basic fundamental of bold, fiery Thai flavors down unlike their yuppified Hayes Valley location. They just need to work on their execution. Considering we went on their second day of opening, a generous 4 stars in hopes they work out their kinks.\n\nWe had every intent of walking over to Good Vibes after dinner. That's until the revolting smell of durian came a knocking on the back door. Opppsie. Definitely stay away from durian when on a date...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I live in a small town outside Santa Barbara, CA so it's not so easy to find ingredients without a jaunt to LA. I'd worked through all my green curry paste I made in the cooking class, so that was my craving. \n\nThe environment was friendly, contemporary, and comfortable. We started with a green papaya salad at medium heat. I love spicy food, but I have stomach issues as well. This level of heat was great for me. The flavors were pretty darn good, but I was not a fan of the way the crab meat was still shelled. No worries my friend was happy to eat all that crab. \n\nI had the green curry. I was pleasantly surprised to see actual thai eggplant being used. The flavors were very reminiscent of my experiences in Thailand. Complex blend of thai chili, cardamon, lemon grass, peppercorn, and thai basil. I think what was missing was the other thai eggplant that looks like a pea. I was having trouble placing that element in the taste. However, it was a magnificent green curry. My friend had a ginger chicken, which was good but not a flavor I tasted while in Thailand. \n\nWe opted to not have dessert here since they only served wine and we were hankering for a gin and tonic.

For my entree, I ordered the sliced (bone-in) catfish in a house made chili paste broth off the original Thai style menu.  I was warned the dish would be spicy and thought I could handle it, but boy was I wrong!  The heat was so intense the food was not enjoyable for me.  I also got frustrated picking out the bones and did not enjoy the slimy texture of the catfish skin.  All that said, I recognize that the spiciness and preparation of the fish is actually very authentic and applaud the chef and restaurant for serving such a dish in the US.  My friend's alligator in the same chili paste was also insanely spicy.  \n\nOverall I learned that my American palate can't handle the house made chili paste.

Ahem!\n\nThis review is based upon my most recent visit, which included an out-of-town guest. We all shared the following, family style:\n\n-Koh Moo Yang: Smoky and Tasty! Grilled slices of pork shoulder, with chili and rice powder sauce\n-Koong Chae Nam Pla: Fresh raw prawns with chili and lemon grass with lime based salad dressing, served with sliced garlic and mint leaves\n-Koong Pad Phed: Full taste of House Made Chili Paste, Kaffir lime leaves, young pepper corn and galingale stir-fried with sliced Prawns\n-Thai Herb Sausage: Roasted Thai Northern style herb sausage, served with peanut, cut ginger, sliced red onion, sliced lemon and chili\n-Pad Ped Moo Pah: Boar stir-fried with a house made chili paste and galingale\n-Sapporro Beer\n\nHands down, my favorite were the fresh raw prawns. The chili flavors upon them were standout and delish. I also did like the Thai herb sausage, which I was glad at least one item on our table didn't extend beyond my palatable spicy intake zone. (Actually, everything this dining session could fit into that category!)\n\nNow, there is an ongoing debate I have with some about whether or not to eat certain portions of food; one of them is gristle. I am not a fan, but others refer to it as collagen and say, \"It's good for you.\" Good for them! Our boar dish had a bit, as did the pork shoulder, although it was easier to intake on the pork shoulder slices because it was simpler to bite into. I can evolve over time...\n\nThe actual meat on the boar was quite flavorful -- I was even impressed by the sliced prawns with chili paste for the same reason. Tickling the taste buds is my ultimate goal, and most dishes here tend to do that. Eating family style, we definitely served up seconds and even thirds for certain dishes (can you guess which?).\n\nOverall, the service was quick, the meal ordered directly in Thai, and this one's closest to home. We will surely be back to continue trying more items from their house- and daily- specials menu. Alligator was a first at Lers Ros for me that way!", "author": "Garett T."}

A slew of issues followed after two of us ordered the pad thai and our other friend ordered the pad see ew.  \n\nFirst--problems with serving time. The pad see ew came a solid 10 min after the pad thais, so late that the pad thais were only passably warm when we started to eat.  Seriously, 10 minutes when nobody else is around?\n\nSecond--inconsistency in serving size.  My friend's pad thai was probably ~30% larger than mine, and both were still pretty darn small (esp. for a dinner price).\n\nThird--meh taste and measly portions.  My plate was half bean sprouts next to a small lump of orange noodles.  There was too much oily sauce, and after I finished there was still a significant amount of grease pooling at the bottom of my plate.

This is easily Top Five Thai Restaurants of all-time for me, towards the top to number one, and Thai food is the one cuisine I cannot live without. I recently got Yelp compliments for reminding someone about this wonderful place. She said, \"You got me drooling. I remember that PORK SHOULDER.\" I said, yeah, it's on my radar of how popular it's been and I actually haven't gotten to it yet. Still haven't. It's a next-time thing or time after that knowing that I'll have plenty of opportunities ahead of me. My goal is to eat here at \"Ler Ros Thai\" once a month for the remainder of my life, even with the 70-minute drive handicapping me. Realistically, if I get here half the amount of times planned it will have been a good life.\n\nAnyway, this is my second \"Lers Ros\" location, and it's in the less hectic location of the Mission District. Favorite item is the off-the-menu item LEK TOM YUM HAENG -- Steamed skinny rice noodles with ground pork, sliced fish cake, crispy pork belly, and dry tom yum noodle, crushed peanuts, burnt crushed chili. Love noodle squishiness, love torrid pork flavors, love the scorched skin and crunchy bites. It's killer good. If you love crispy pork I also recommend the CRISPY PORK BELLY & BASIL, but there's enough crispy pork in the first dish I mentioned that perhaps you can go with something else. GARLIC QUAIL and STEAMED SEABASS WITH LEMONGRASS is on the menu, and I assure you they know what they're doing. The chefs are artists.

These days, I prefer to experience a restaurant first-hand & then go back & read what my favorites had to say (way to do things backwards!) \n\nFollowing dinner at Lers Ros, I read over some of my yelp homies' reviews & found a barrage of 4-star reviews. To this, I say two things: I'm envious of your nom-able experience, & did we eat at the same restaurant?! We ordered: \n\n-- Thai iced teas & sides of sticky rice -- the usual \n-- tom yum koong which had a lovely presentation served out of an iron hot pot, but unfortunately i believe we were served tom kah kai. We intentionally didn't order this coconut milk-based soup. Was sufficiently spicy, had plenty of lime, but wasn't the flavor we anticipated. \n-- kai pad khing: sliced chicken stir fried w/ ginger, onions, & mushrooms. I found the preparation extremely odd. I like my protein dishes to either be dry or have a full-bodied sauce I can spoon over rice/noodles; this one had a watery, flavorless liquid that barely covered the bottom of the plate. \n-- we ordered a fish dish off of the specials menu, but were informed 20 minutes later that they didn't have the ingredients but that they'd make us another dish, cod with black bean sauce. We were so over the whole experience that we just agreed & thought, well, let's see what they come up with. Was the most expensive dish we ordered, as well as the most unmemorable. \n\nEither because of my own poor choosing skills or Lers Ros' inability to deliver what we originally ordered, we didn't get anything we wanted out of a restaurant that night.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

There were plenty of seats available inside the spacious restaurant. It didn't feel too crowded, even after the restaurant started filling in. Also, this location seems good for groups (presumably with a reservation).\n\nI ordered the Rad Nah (flat noodle with gravy), the Kang Phed Yang (red curry with duck), and the crab roll cake as an appetizer. The noodles and the curry had great flavors, but the meats (both pork and duck) were too fatty, and the overall portions were smaller than I expected. The crab roll cakes were fantastic as an appetizer.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the service. They were too eager to clear plates out of the way. For instance, I took the last crab roll cake from the serving dish and before I could dip it in the sauce, it was taken away!

Way too many carrots, barely a trace of onions, and nothing else. No red or green pepper, no celery, no nothing. Boring, and bland. And the service was ridiculously slow, especially given that there were three of us and just two other full tables, a two-top and a four top. The four top cashed out just after we ordered, so you'd think the staff would have it easy, but they vanished without a trace until the end of the meal, and only came when we flagged them down.

I was craving some spicy green curry and wanted to branch out from the go-to spot. Let me just say that SIMPLY ORDERING was a huge headache, and here's why, folks:\n\n1) Called the number listed on their website, it was busy the first 5 times I called, then it turns out this location is on Larkin, and being in the Mission, I was too far for delivery, so the employee advised me to call the 16th St location and gave the other number listed on their site.\n\n2) Called the second number, busy the first few calls, then the woman says we need to call the Mission location (??); um, we just did?\n\n3) A new number is given so quickly and then the phone disconnects, call back: BUSY!\n\n4) FINALLY get ahold of someone at the Mission location, give the woman my address, spelling it out three times before angrily handing the phone to my more patient better-half. He gives the address slowly, along with cross street (Caesar Chavez), to which the lady tries to read back, and gets wrong, doesn't seem to know what Caesar Chavez is... okay they just opened this location 2 weeks ago, so I guess it's understandable.\n\n5) He begins to order off the menu on their website, which is numbered, so he orders the #66 (Tom Yum w/ pork and noodles), she says they don't use numbers at the restaurant to order, so he reads off the name Kuay Tiew Tom Yum Moo, she asks him to spell it out, so he does, and she doesn't know what it is and asks if he wants hot and sour soup? He's not sure at this point if it could be a h&s soup, so he asks for the soup by name and again spells it out, and then, click! She knows just what he's talking about! \n\nOrdering the rest of the food was about as much trouble, but taking his credit card number was a breeze! Then, not 5 mintues after hanging up, the woman calls back and asks him to spell out the address again! Just silliness, IMPLEMENT ONLINE ORDERING!!\n\nThe food arrived quickly and his soup and Yum Woon Sen were good, my green curry was very spicy and gave me heartburn (my own fault, but definitely added to my distaste for this place).

After all, as Kobe told us, we \"can't just stand by and watch crime happen\".\n\nI've eaten at all 3 SF Lers Ros locations many times but I'll never order from the 16th location again. I ordered food for delivery on a Friday night, delivery time was fine, driver was polite so no problems there. The problems started when I closed the front door and opened the pad see ew in an enclosed area (my house), it was at this time I found out that Lers Ros had Trojan horsed me. The smell of rancid garlic filled my house like an unwelcome friend crashing on the couch eating sauerkraut. I opened the sliced pork shoulder to find that it was not sliced. It was not sliced because it was so over cooked and fatty that the chef was not able to cut through it, only at it. I won't bore you with the rest, the food was bad and ruined my appetite so obviously I didn't eat it.\n\nI called back the next day (which I hate to do) and experienced the dreadful customer service you'd expect. From the moment I began talking to the person who was supposed to be the manager (Bil) she treated me as if I was Bernie Madoff trying to use free pad see ew to fuel my ponsi scheme. After telling her my phone number twice, she reviewed my order twice, and then asked me to tell her what was wrong with each dish...twice. The next step of course was to say hold on, make me wait for 5 minutes and then come back to say that she was not the manager, she is just a \"worker\", and couldn't do anything for me. She told me to email lersros at hotmail, seriously. I said ok and hung up the phone. It was at this time I realized I had a responsibility as a human to save others from this fate. I called her back and told her I wasn't going to tell my story over email again so it could go unanswered, instead of be taking my talents to yelp. My statement was met with a complete change of attitude and  it turned out she could do anything I wanted after all. She told me she'd give me 50% off another order.

Bathrooms were clean, too!\n\nFood was fantastic. It really had a lot of flavor and a certain sophistication that you don't always find at a Thai restaurant. We were a party of three on a GNO in the Mission and one of them heard of this place on the plane from NY.\n\nWhat we ordered**:\n\nRockfish with Thai eggplant (size of Tomatillos, green skin, soft pale yellow flesh--not purple), various vegetables and garnished with fresh peppercorns. This is a good dish if you like fish and want a dish that is not spicy. The fish had a firmness to it and held up in the dish. The Thai eggplant has a bit of a crunch to it. A cross between an eggplant and a zucchini.\n\nVegetarian Red Curry (Kang Deng) - We had this curry with Thai eggplant and Tofu.\nIt really needed to feature the eggplant and Tofu more since it was vegetarian. But the curry was excellent with a little kick to it so be prepared. We had ours with brown rice. Our hostess explained that the Red Curries were medium spicy.\n\nPad Thai - Some dishes you just expect to be good because it's a standard. This is one of them. Theirs is really good. It was light, not heavy. I could eat this every day of the week. However, ours needed more shrimp. \n\n**No drinks or dessert but there's always another time, right?

I've been here twice so far.. and the first time, I was a little iffy about coming back... but the second time-- which took place yesterday, was great. The problem with the first time was that I was only able to enjoy two dishes with a couple of appetizers.. which didn't really go well together. The second time, I went with more people and got to try more things together. So, I think that if you want the most out of the Lers Ros experience, you have to order family style (three or more dishes)-- which is the way Thai food should be eaten.\n\nI love the papaya salad-- which is not done in the usual mixed way. It comes with a side of cabbage and the papaya (mixed in that amazing spicy fish sauce). I've had this both times-- once with prawn, and the other with raw crab-- definitely go with the raw crab. Another great dish was the shrimp paste fried rice, which was one of the specials of the day-- but it should go on the main menu because it is so good! It was definitely my favorite dish of the night.\n\nIn general, everything is on the pricier side of things-- because you're sort of paying for the ambiance (and a very nice ambiance at that)... as well as the quality of the food. You should definitely look this place up if you've got a couple of friends for dinner (because you get to try a couple more dishes, creating a more complete meal).

Well, when we got there around 8:05 pm, and were told that the previous party was just paying and leaving. And well, we waited until 8:30 pm without any indication on whether we'd be seated soon. Sure, the waitstaff can't control when the party leaves, but we would have liked to have been asked whether we wanted some drinks while we were waiting. When we were seated, we were understandably incredibly hungry. But for some reason, our waitress did not come to take our order for the next ten minutes (...because we needed more time to decide on what we wanted after 30 minutes of looking at the menu?). \n\nOn food (4 stars): \nHouse special - boar: I am not a big fan of boar because of its distinct texture. The seasoning was pretty spicy and nice, but the meat wasn't high quality. There were big chunks of rubbery fat, and there really wasn't much meat to start with because 80% of the dish was covered with spices and not very appetizing-looking vegetables.      \n\nPad see ew with beef: The noodles were cooked well and seasoned thoroughly. The quality of meat wasn't the best, but it wasn't expected to be great any way. This had a very mild spicy kick to it, which was definitely different from most Americanized Thai restaurants that make this dish soy-sauce-sweet.   \n\nRed curry with duck: I wish that the portion size were bigger. There weren't much duck meat in the curry but the vegetables were crunchy and nice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-10", "description": "Ate here for dinner last night and it was quite possibly the worst meal I've had yet in San Francisco. We were seated right away, though it was quite full since it was a Saturday evening at prime time. I can't fathom why so many people were there, and even more, looking happy!\n\n_ decor kind of sucks. It looks like they tried, but were unsuccessful - uncomfortable Bertoia/Eames-inspired wire mesh chairs, seats and tables that aren't appropriately scaled to each other, weird ceiling mesh, orange wall paint, terrible acoustics, etc.\n_ the noise! Holy crap I have a sore throat from the yelling I had to do just to converse with my single dining partner. Not sure how you could come here with a group of people and ever be heard.\n_ the food was not good, at all. We started with the papaya salad with salted egg and it was so salty we couldn't even finish the dish (and we have *very* high tolerances for both salt and egg). Followed that with pad thai that was simultaneously too acidic and syrupy sweet and, again, not finishable. The pad kee mao was also too sweet and the tofu tasted like the pre-packed kind that is fried in industrial vats of oil, not like something they are actually cooking themselves.\n_ the service was not good. They forgot one of our dishes and we had to flag down a server to ask where it was, then watch her go through the motions of discovering that it somehow got lost in the shuffle. We had already eaten an appetizer and split the nasty Pad Thai at that point, and instead of owning up to the mistake and asking if we still wanted the dish, they squeezed it into the kitchen line up and brought out a dish that was too hot to eat a few minutes later.\n_ the tables are set very strangely - with both a placemat and a \"charger\" that are present throughout the meal. They bring a smaller plate for the appetizer and place that over the \"charger,\" which of course guarantees that the charger gets sauce and bits of food on it. The server additionally spilled food all over my boyfriend's \"charger\" as he took away the appetizer, which led to another server a few minutes later trying to take away my \"charger,\" before realizing we haven't had our food yet. In short, the \"charger\" is actually a dinner plate, but by the time I get to eat off of it, it has food, saucer, and fingerprints all over it. Fantastic.\n_ Finishing touches: no apology for the food mix up, resulting in a $20+ dinner/person that was grossly not worth that; a restaurant that seemed fully staffed and yet we were waiting significant amounts of time between each course; so much chaos! Again, I don't understand why someone would subject themselves to that much chaotic energy in one restaurant. Dining should be enjoyable, not a shit show.", "author": "Megan S."}

And the 16th & Guerrero location is a vast improvement on their Tenderloin location. The inside is inviting and nicely laid out. We had the fried vegetable rolls to start. I had the Kang Kareem, a yellow curry that I asked for chicken. The other main was Pad Thai. The flavors were closer to those of Bangkok than any other place I've been to in San Fran. Only caveat is ask for mild unless you truly can take VERY hot food. Mild was ok for me, mediums was a bit too hot for either of us and my dining partner has an asbestos mouth. The service was fast and efficient. We arrived at 9:45 on a Thursday (July 3rd nite) 15 minutes before closing but were served before 10. Want to go back and try more from the extensive menu.

Parking was horrible, as always, but that didn't stop up from trying, which now I know should have...\nDecor is trendy and staff seems friendly, and that's all I can say about this place. \nWe've ordered two of their special dishes, cod and alligator, two glasses of wine and brown rice, all on the menu. One thing we've asked to be made off the menu was green beans with garlic sauce, instead of their spicy-as-hell red sauce, for which we were charged 10.95 and beans were old as hell, but that wasn't the worst. The fish and alligator were so gawd-damn-salty, it was just impossible to eat. At some point my wife made a comment \"honey, would you like some food with your salt?\" I mean holly shit, salt and red spicy sauce were the main dishes and had some fish and alligator on a side. And now I know why...fast forward 3 hours, and I've got the shits! I was singing and praying to Lord to help pass that food out of my body in non-violent matter as much as possible, and thanking my lucky stars that it happened at home. In order to mask the \"freshness\" of their ingredients, they use the salt and pepper very generously. \nBecause of those effers, I had to have milanta and emmodium for desert, instead of \"sexy-time\" with my wife. Screw you bustards! I'm never coming back to your place! and I'm going back to work on Monday to find my co-worker and beating the crap out of him for recommending this place...\nTWO stars is me being generous, and a rating for a decor and staff, food rating is...crap!", "author": "Abe L."}

The dish would be more aptly named: \"Pork and Onions\". \n\nThe description on the menu did not indicate onions nor carrots however those vegetables dominated the dish. And salt. The onion taste was over-powering. The pork was sparse and pathetic little pieces and overly salty; some with gristle varying from not pleasant to inedible. I did not bother counting the black mushrooms because it was hard not to notice the two pieces; who counts to two? There must have been at least $1.17 worth of food product in my $11 entree. \n\nIf a salty taste equates to flavor, then the dish provided an overly flavorful experience dominated with fresh white onion vapor in my sinuses. \n\nSpecial thanks to Lers Ros management for giving me that totally ripped off feeling.", "author": "Keith U."}

This review is really intended to give the Lers Ros mgmt some feedback on the dining experience that may be of benefit. My wife, youngest son (11) and I had dinner at Lers Ros last night in the Mission. The food was excellent and the service was great! So...why only two stars? The noise level was deafening and overwhelming and literally ruined our dinner. We did not have this same experience when we dined at the Tenderloin location back in October 2013. We enjoy a lively, happening atmosphere as much as the next person, but the noise was so bad from the surrounding tables, it literally impacted the enjoyment of our meal, and we all agreed that it wouldn't be a place we'd go again (unless improvements were made). The space is smaller than the Tenderloin location so perhaps that contributed to it? Noise acoustics are something that the ownership/mgmt can do something about, so I am writing this review in that spirit. You can still have a great ambience, but put in some acoustic elements to bring down the oppressive sound. Hope to see Lers Ros make these changes as it would be bummer to have to strike some of the best Thai food in the City as an option.", "author": "Lawson C."}
