I opted for creamy but not sweet and received an iced coffee with some foam. It was creamy, had ice cubes and a sprig of mint leaves. So pretty and delicious \n\nI'm not a fan of artificial sweeteners or flavors and so I was a big fan of this drink! It was lightly minty and very creamy.

Phil Jaber started throwing fresh green mint leaves on top of coffee cups in 2003 at his grocery store on 24th St in the Mission District. 14 years later, 41 Philz coffee branches have spread all over reaching El-Lay, Sacramento and Washington DC. And they're growing. Their signature drink and by far their best drink is the MINT MOJTIO. All the rest of the beverages and pastries are just OK..\n\nThis branch on 17th St is awesome! It's cute, cozy, clean, elegant, nicely lit, and most importantly it was a place for a wonderful gathering. It was suggested by our friends Ann and Stan where we spent a fantastic morning sipping mint mojito. Yelp friends are amazing because I can take photos of the drinks/food without getting punished for doing so. \n\nNot all branches of Philz coffee make mint mojito right. Out of 41 Philz branches, I have tried about 15 (mainly in SF area and Santa Monica). So far, only 3 or 4 branches made the mint mojito right.  This 17th St branch and China Basin one are on the top of the good ones. The other locations make it bitter or weird or just not right.. Ask to make it sweet (by their default) at this location.

In SF o.O \nIt can't go wrong from here.\n\nPhilz has their usual selection of delicious coffee on a simple and well-organized menu. $3.50 small/$4.50 large, with specialty drinks (mint, gingersnap, or mocha) +$1. The food offerings are similar to their other locations and includes pastries (including bougier choices like kouign aman), toasts, and breakfast burritos. \n\nBesides the ample street parking in the neighborhood, what I love most about this Philz is their natural lighting and tall ceiling, which imparts a chic industrial look. The space itself is quite small though; there are 3 large tables, 4 bar seats by the windows, one large sofa, and some benches. Baristas are friendly as always.\n\nWhy the minus 1 star? There are no 2-person tables, so I would recommend against coming here by yourself to get work done. You'll likely have to share a table with people who are chatting right next to you, which can get distracting. I also don't like the automatically flushing toilet, because the manual button doesn't seem to work. There's a sign instructing you to push the button harder if it's not flushing, but it was to no avail. \n\nSo essentially, everything about this Philz is great, except I don't come here to study and I try to avoid using the bathroom.\n\nOtherwise, the mint mojito is sooo gooood, and the parking makes me sooo ecstatic.", "author": "Edna C."}

Relieved that I made it to Philz without spilling paperwork everywhere, I immediately looked for a table to put everything down.   All of the tables are taken but another patron kindly let me put down my belongings at her table.  \n\nThe place is small and I've never been to this location before.  I did not want to walk too far from my bags and saw a narrow hallway to my left. Maybe it leads to an upstairs seating area or something?  So I ask the barista if there is additional seating and she recommends I sit outside.   I glance out the window at all the soaked but empty tables and chairs sitting in the rain.  Not a good suggestion.  I say nothing and figure I'll just move to a table inside once one opens.  I'm early and am meeting a friend and figure I'll secure a spot before he gets there.  \n\nDespite all of the tables being taken, the place is NOT busy and only one other person ordered as I slowly looked over the menu.  The 3 baristas stand clustered together.  I'm really feeling a strong vibe from the 3 baristas that I'm doing something wrong but I'm not sure what.  All 3 are standing close to each other, quietly talking to one another from the sides of their mouths as they watch me.  The lady who suggested I sit in the rain is apparently a supervisor or a manager.   I hear her discussing when another employee can take a break but can't hear much else.   Maybe the unwelcomed vibe is due to me being in the wrong place?   I scan the shop from where I'm standing, looking for a cash register to order at.  \n\nThe gentleman at the cash register is warm and friendly, unlike the baristas.   He points to a smiling face sign and tells me that I should wait there until I'm called by a barista, place my order with the barista, then come back and pay at the register.   Doy!   Silly me!   I was so busy looking for a place to set my bags that I walked right past it.\n\nOne person gets in front of me and after she's done ordering, I remain standing by the smiling face,  watching the baristas while waiting to be called.  I'm really feeling a strong vibe from the 3 baristas now that none of them want to service me.  Not long later, one barista yells out \"What's up?\" but doesn't make eye contact. \n\n\"Oh!  Are you referring to me?\" I ask since I honestly couldn't tell if he was referring to me or another barista.  I swear, at that moment, I saw the baristas exchange glances at each other like I was the biggest idiot.   \n\nThe coffee here might be good but the service is not.  I wasn't rude nor did I even think of being rude to these baristas despite having an off day myself.  There was no reason for them to be rude to me.   \n\n\"Nevermind\" I say, as I walk back to my bags and text a quick note to my friend, asking him to meet me at a nearby cafe instead.  The saint at the cash register sees me packing up my stuff to leave.  \"You didn't order?\" he asks.  Him and the coffee is the only redeeming thing about this place.  \n\n\"No.  I decided to go elsewhere.\" I say, as I walk out the door.   I've never felt so uninvited as I did in this place.

I knew it was probably worth the wait because Philz does have a reputation for producing wonderful drinks. This is a fairly small location and there is usually always an officer ordering a drink whenever I am there. Nothing wrong with that though.\n\n2) Wait time\nThe line went by fairly fast, but sometimes there would be pauses. Since you essentially line up for a personal barista, not all of them will be available to take your order at some point. It's not really a problem at all because it shows their quality of direct customer service.\n\n3) The Food\nMy absolute favorite would be the Mint Mojito Iced Coffee! \nI've never tasted anything like it and I could positively say that it is one of the best coffee drinks I've had. The coffee itself is not completely washed out, yet there is a strong hint of mint with every sip. Highly recommended!\n\n4) Service\nThe baristas are all very kind and I'm sure their customer service is the reason for Philz' high reviews. Each barista always asks you to try the drink before leaving to make sure it is made right to perfection. The cashier even complimented my shirt!\n \n\n*Final Verdict*\nIf you're looking for a nice coffee shop to go to and you're in the area, make sure to check out this Philz!

I stopped in to cool off and tried the most interesting sounding (to me) cold drink, which was the Minty Mojito Iced Coffee, and it was so yummy! Nice and frothy with a good punch of caffeine and taste. Great presentation with the mint leaves on top, too. \n\nI like their set-up of order, go away to pay, come back for your drink, but could see orders getting mixed up at a busier time. Maybe they take names in that busier scenario?\n\nI chilled out for a little over an hour (literally - it was pretty chilly in there....maybe a User Experience trick to make you feel the need to warm up with a cup of coffee ) and wished I could've had a flat-top table, but sat at a bar area as those were all taken. \n\nThank you, come again? Yeah! I'll be back to try their regular brewed coffee on a colder day!", "author": "Amanda W."}
