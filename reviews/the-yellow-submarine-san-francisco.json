I was in the Sunset this weekend around lunch time and  was finally able to visit this sandwich shop.\n\nThe Reuben I ordered today was just ok.  I would have preferred a more traditional Reuben with grilled rye bread and lots of meat.  Their version was more like a hot sub and I wished it wasn't.  I really missed the Thousand Island dressing which got drowned out with all of the extras that come standard on all of their subs.  More meat would have been good too.\nAll Sandwiches Include: Mayonnaise, Mustard, Tomato, Lettuce, Pickles, Oil, Vinegar, Hot Sauce, And Your Choice Of Cheese: American, Swiss Or Provolone.\n\nThere was a lot of toasted bread that made up the sub.  Even though I asked for a medium, I was uncomfortably full from the carbs alone.\nThe potato salad I ordered as a side was just ok too.  Creamy but not very flavorful.\n\nThe place is a little rough looking on the inside.", "author": "Thomas D."}

If for some reason you don't scarf down the whole sammie in one sitting (I know I did), heating it up the next day is a treat.

I love me a juicy philly cheese steak sandwich anytime on any day, so when I found out that a well known, Family-owned sandwich spot was literally walking distance from my workplace, I knew I had no excuse not to try it. Rewind to yesterday, as I turn in my badge and parking permit, I met up with a friend of mine to finally try Yellow Submarine! \n\nTo save us some time, my homie called in our order-yet we ate it inside and sat among one of the few tables that are inside the spot. As my excitement built, seeing my sandwich for the first time was it. Wrapped in a white paper, I was so surprised at the \"medium\" sized sandwich looking at me. I couldn't believe how big this was. Meaning it could easily be shared between two hungry people. Needless to say I had leftovers for dinner.\n\nSo I ordered the traditional cheese steak sandwich which included within; American Cheese, delicious this Slices of steak, lettuce, tomato, in-house hot sauce, mayonnaise, mustard and pickles. In the future, I will order my sandwich WITHOUT: mayonnaise, mustard and pickles. I feel like these flavors are overpowering, therefore you aren't able to really enjoy the juices from the sandwich. Don't get me wrong, the sammie was still yummy, but I think without those additions it would make the sammie, perfect!", "author": "Lene N."}

Easily the best sandwich spot closest to UCSF/Parnassus without breaking the bank.\nOrders can be placed by phone, and I think they partner with a few delivery services. \nIt's a family-run business and everybody's very friendly, it's simple, and yet very authentic and it tastes delicious. There is a good selection of sandwiches, and they are always made-to-order, and you can get them in two different sizes. For my appetite, the large is too much, but I order it anyway and keep the other half for later :)\n\nIf you would like to dine in, there is a separate room with natural light and many tables, as well as a bench outside. Or you can take your order and walk down two blocks to Golden Gate Park. \n\nPretty sure it's a cash-only operation which is my only complaint.\n\nNote sometimes the door is closed and can be a little sticky to open, but you should persist!\n\nParking can be a little tricky sometimes because of the ongoing construction (can't hear a thing though) but it's not too bad.

I took a class nearby and needed to warm up from the Inner Sunset cold so I decided to stop by for a sandwich.  It's a bustling place and there was a large party that took over the majority of seating in the room next door (large parties, please be conscious of this as this limits seating for the rest of us and taking an extra long lunch together is not optimal in a busy place like this, especially on a Saturday at lunch time - c'mon peeps!).  \n\nMy hot pastrami sandwich with everything on it hit the spot and warmed me up - it was flavorful and fresh and toasty warm!  Luckily, I was able to snag a small table in the bag after finagling a chair from another table - it's a small place so you've got to work it a little bit.  The guy behind the cash register had a bit of an attitude (you still need to pick your cheese as there are 3 choices, and it is not clear on the menu that provolone is on every sandwich - a little more patience on your part would have been nice), which really wasn't appreciated, as I was cold, hungry and had never been there before.  \n\nI also brought home a corned beef sandwich for later - it wasn't quite as good as the pastrami but it was a-ok.

This space is a bit small, but cozy. I looked at the menu, and then looked at Yelp to figure out what's good here. While browsing yelp, I saw that it was cash only and quickly scoured my wallet to see if I had enough money. I had enough for a Medium sandwich. \n\nPastrami with \"The Works\" & Provolone - Med 7.40ish after tax - Overall, this sandwich seem fairly large upon opening it up. However, it was not as filled up as I had hoped. The layer of meat was less than I expected, and it could definitely use just a little bit more veggies.\n\nThe specifics:\n- The bread was perfectly toasted. There was a nice fluffiness to the inside, while being crispy on the outside. You need to eat this sandwich immediately or else it will get soggy.\n- The veggies were a bit under par. Couldn't really tell how fresh everything was, but the tomato flavour didn't really pop, and the lettuce was very neutral. \n- The meat was good, just could have added a bit more at this price point.\n- See pictures for sizing. The Med was about 8.5 inches long, and 2.6ish inches tall. \n\n- Asking for Extra Hot Sauce - When I was waiting for my sandwich to be made, I realized that \"Extra Hot Sauce\" could have either meant the sauce is extra hot, or I wanted twice the amount of hot sauce. I'm not exactly sure how they took it, but they ended up asking me if I wanted the mild sauce or the spicy one. I asked for the spicy one.\n-- The hot sauce is subtle. You don't really notice it until you stop eating for a second. It's not super spicy, but you can probably taste the tang.\n\nI think this place is worth giving another shot. It was flavourful and definitely pretty yummy. I want to try the steak and cheese and fries next time. Seems A-OK.

They are GREAT.\n\nLast, but not least, is that my friend and I split a large STEAK & CHEESE sandwich with provolone (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-yellow-submarine-san-francisco?select=Ka-cdG4TYJUnVjtShVCAgA#af9eCmNlfLud7bDsGny3Pw) for $8.95. It's a LOT of food (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-yellow-submarine-san-francisco?select=Ka-cdG4TYJUnVjtShVCAgA#1bc5Pfy1HaDKtQzzuOoqtg), but tastily so. The steak is fairly salty, but the salt is tempered by the sandwich fillings and the chewy bread. And let's not forget how amazing melted provolone is.\n\nConclusion: filling and affordable.

I could tell it was popular because of the line and packed dining area, but I think that got my expectations up too much as a result.\n\nTo start, it's cash only. There's an ATM right outside connected to the store...but of course it charges you a service fee. To add, the owner/man at the counter was not happy to take our orders. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt that he was maybe just having an bad day, but nonetheless he condescendingly told my friend he was waiting for him to pick what cheese he wanted when it was pretty clear my friend didn't even know that he had to do that. Moreover, no \"welcome's, please's, thank you's, enjoy's, good bye's, etc.\" were exchanged, even after I thanked him and bid him farewell. I encourage the management here to try and take an interest in the customers - food only gets you so far in my opinion...and there are a lot of sandwich shops in the city.\n\nOf course, though food only goes so far, it is the reason we came here in the first place. That being said, I will first say that my sandwich definitely tasted good. I got the Italian Steak Sandwich. It was stacked with meat, the cheese melted all throughout, and the bread stayed warm and soft. You get a savory taste of all the flavors as a result of whatever they used to pepper their steak - felt nice on the taste buds. I got the medium sized sandwich and it was honestly large enough for me to split into two meals. Overall though, the sandwich was grand, but didn't blow my mind. There are plenty of sandwich spots in Sunset, I wouldn't particularly say that this one stands above the rest based off of taste alone. \n\nI will be back to try another sandwich and either validate or invalidate whether the man who took my order was just having a bad day or not. However, I feel like it will be my last trip if the benefit of the doubt I'm giving him is invalidated. If we were only allowed to use five words in our reviews to describe our experience, I think I would say: Tasty potential, but needs work.", "author": "Shayan S."}

I have just been to sandwich places that offered more meat, with amazing special sauce, and were HUGE (specifically thinking little luccas). The person taking my order just seemed bored and not very welcoming. Maybe he was having a off-day?

Yellow submarine seems to stick with the basics and has been doing them good for years now\n\nThere are certain factors that i like about YS: one, they toast and heat their meet. Something so simple like this can change a sandwich entirely and still today not a lot of places do it. Two, they  keep it simple. They do go for fancy garlic spreads or special cheeses, just the normal works with a splash of hot sauce. \n\nI wasn't excited about their high prices, i ordered a salami sandwich with cheese and the works (lettuce,tomatoes,pickles,lettuce, mayo/mustard and hot sauce) and it was $10. Sandwich was about 12\" long - pretty big sub, but $10 is probably one of the more expensive sandwiches. Even ike's place doesn't charge that much and they cram hella crap into their sandwiches. \n\nI did enjoy their sandwiches, because i can appreciate the simplicity of it. I love sandwiches and i can't believe that some places can't taste better than a turkey and cheese sandwich that you make at home for free. Its hard to justify coming back because i make this sandwich at home as well since its not overly complex. \n\nSo here is my overall rating \n\nWould I recommend this place? Yes! \nDoes the sandwiches taste good? Yes! \nIs it worth $10? Questionable \n\n\nIts like going to the movies and paying $10 vs staying home and pirating it lol jk.", "author": "Ryan R."}

They did not have enough avocado, so they wanted to \"save\" it for people that ordered vegetarian sandwiches... even though there is a market where they could've bought extra avocados if they run out just a few blocks away.

I grew up in the neighborhood and would always see the mother making sandwhiches. I rarely see her now that they hired a new cook. He does a equally good job as the mother and sons\n\nTheres two cute hunky brothers that work the register. (had a crush on the younger one since 6th grade) hahaha. I remember YEARSS ago, when i was in  elemantary school I didnt have enough money for my sandwhich I ordered. I said I would go home, a couple blocks away, and be right back. One of the bro's, I forgot his name, said it was fine...even though i still owed like 6 dollars!!! My family were regulars and Im sure he recognized my face. I never forgot this friendly neighborhood gesture, and always leave a tip in the tip jar.  \n\nfor the past 15 years, ive always ordered the pepper steak with 2 orders of fries. I LOVE the fries, more like thick chips perfectly crunchy. Make sure you eat the fries at the shop. They get super soggy if you order takeout. The sandwhich too!! Theres so much juice pouring out the sandwhich that it usually soaks through the paper to-go bag.\n\nThe sandwhiches are consistantly good and satisfy my sub cravings. I wish they added more meat in the sandwhich though. Theres ALOT of bread, which isint really a bad thing since its crunchy and delicious...but it wouldnt hurt to have a little more meat. Being a carnivore i always appreciate lots of meat in a sub,\n\nFor always being friendly neighborhood faces, i give 5 stars to The Yellow Submarine.", "author": "Andrew V."}

You'd think I tried everything on the menu, but I've only tried about less than half, which include the steak & cheese, Italian steak, pepper steak, avocado, turkey, dry Italian salami, and hot pastrami. You can't go wrong with their Italian steak or pepper steak. Those two are similar, but definitely my favorites! They toast your sandwiches, so the bread is slightly burnt at the edges, making it very crispy and crunchy. They also pack your sandwiches here with fresh ingredients: shredded lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and pickles. You can choose between a medium or a large, both of which are HUGE! If I'm really hungry, I can definitely finish a medium all by myself.\n\nEvery time I come here, I've gotten quick, friendly service. It's often crowded here during weekend lunch times.

No wonder the Yellow Sub is a beloved staple that you'll constantly hear good things about.\n\nThe sandwiches are delicious, especially coming from me because I've always had a meh attitude about sandwiches.  I got the Italian sandwich, which had the perfect flavor from the peppery Italian meats, a thin layer of melted provolone, a bed of lettuce to balance everything, and the crispy bread.  Mmm, toasty.  I suggest sharing because it's pretty big, and by the time you get to the second half, it's not warm and toasty anymore.  Oh first world problems...\n\nI also tried the fries, which are cross sections of fried potato.  It's very interesting unlike any other fries I've ever seen, and it'd make a great Instagram (wayy too many In-N-Out grams out there), but in terms of taste I don't think it was anything too amazing.  \n\nIt's a little over $7 for a medium size, which is not that cheap of a lunch.  \n\nWhat worried me the most is the 66/100 health score...

I have lost count how many times I have been there, but I am in love with their chicken and steak sandwiches. When I am in need of a sandwich this is a popular spot for me. They are close to UCSF (walking distance). Family run. Small shop, but I generally pick up my sandwiches and eat them at home or library. The prices are fair and they give you a good amount. I am moving in 6 months, but that means I will be venturing out to Yellow Sub another 30 times before I leave. \n\nFYI: they put hot sauce on most of their sandwiches which is fine, but I am a pansy so I ask for not no hot sauce (granted its not that hot, but I feel it detracts from the sandwiches flavor).", "author": "Soroosh A."}

I asked what the most popular sandwich is and she said the Peppersteak, so the pepper steak it is! They have the option of either medium or large. Medium is already huge (big enough to share) so unless you're starving and haven't eaten in days, I suggest getting the medium. If you're sharing, get the large.  Also ordered the French fries and a bag of chips.\n\nPeppersteak sandwich was really good. The meat was very flavorful and the bread they use has the perfect crunch to go along with each bite. The fries were cut and fried like potato chips. Not as crunchy as I would want them but it had some what of a crunch outside and very soft inside! Pretty much like a French fry but it's potato chip fry (great concept.)\n\nAll in all, I would definitely go back here. I love hot sandwiches and on top of that I love fries.

I took my kids to the park near by and they wanted to eat sandwiches so I looked to Yelp to find a place near by with good ratings so this was the chosen one. I get there and it's like a little \"hole in the wall\" kinda place I ordered 7 large sandwiches, 11 drinks, and 10 chips our bill was about $120. I've seen other pictures on here with large sandwiches with \"Everything\" stating $8 and some change. I think the guy over charged us because he knew we where first timers  While waiting for the food I asked the guy who took our order for the restroom he said he doesn't have one. I said we don't need to use it we just need to wash our hands and he points at a hand sanitizer mounted on the wall  I said NO we just came from the park we need water and soap he said I can bring a warm towel  wth I said no thanks we will be back. Now eating time the place does look like it needs some T.L.C. and an inspection but the sandwiches wasn't all that and one of them my niece found a hair in her's and gave it to the guy and they made a whole new one HINT: wear some dame gloves and hairnets #Smh won't be going back", "author": "Princess V."}

I don't really get out to the Inner Sunset too often, so when I found myself just a few paces away, I had to finally head in for a taste.\n\nThey make their sandwiches hot, so if I had to guess, I'd assume that that lends a small hand to the \"Boston style\" in which they propose. I often wonder why all sandwich spots don't choose to heat up their cold cuts and stone ground wheat, because just about all of my favorite joints have that in common (Ike's, Fillmore Street Cafe, just to name a couple). They saut\u00e9 their meats and peppers much like a Philly Cheese Steak, so perhaps that's another example of what makes a Bean Town special. \n\nTheir most popular sandwich is the steak and onion (if memory serves me correctly), but since I don't eat moo cow, I went with their second most popular; the chicken. Upon suggestion from the owner, I lathered it with the house made hot sauce... and I'm glad I did! I almost want to ask homeboy if I can just buy an entire bottle to keep in my fridge, because this stuff gives Tapatio a run for its money!\n\nOverall, I was very impressed by my inaugural visit, and if I lived in the 'hood, I could see this as a regular stop in no time.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

Nevertheless, I yelp. \n\nGood sandwich place. I can tell that a lot of locals come here. The dining area was ok. \n\nI got the pepper steak and enjoyed it. I felt that there wasn't enough hot sauce and when I asked for more, they just put some sauce on a paper in the basket. Advice for patrons who preferred extra spices- just ask for extra in the beginning when you order. \n\nI would have liked more meat in my sandwich. The bread was very thick and bready; maybe that is why I felt that there should be more meat. \n\nBecause they have a great grill- I would say that you should order a sandwich that is anything grilled like pepper steak or grilled something. \n\nThe potato fries are amazing. I never had fresh fried potato chips like that and appreciate how they recognize the simplicity of fried potatoes. In my opinion, a potato is good on its own if you cook it properly. It really doesn't need a whole lot of seasoning- but then again- that is just my opinion.

I ordered a medium Avocado without the vinegar and onions. \n\nSecond: price. I don't understand how a $6.45 medium sub cost me $8.03. I'm new to SF so I still don't know the taxes here but that was a lot on top of the cost of the sub, unless I was charged for extra avocado, which I better not have been. Read my next point.\n\nThird, the size was decent but the amount of fillings weren't. There wasn't a lot of avocado. And in my big fat opinion, if you advertise a sub as having avocado, and it's the ONLY vegetarian option, I think it should have a decent amount of that ingredient in it. \n\nFourth, I didn't think the customer service was that great. I walked in and asked if there were any other veggie options. The guy was hasty in explaining that avocado was the only option. So I ordered that.

The head staff there was very distracted and slow. I was ready to order and stood at the counter for a good 5 minutes. Waited for him to walk around, fill some change in the register,picked up a phone call and placed an order before he acknowledge I was ready to order the whole time. I ordered the avacado sandwich because sometimes flavors are truly put to the test with the simple form of things. The sandwich was toasted to the point where the rim of the bread was burnt, but I didn't mind it too much since it was a minor mistake. I wish I was about to detect the vinegar and hot sauce more. I barely noticed it in my sandwich nor it helped to bring out the flavors in other ingredients. Turns out you have the option of asking for a spicier hot sauce which is homemade, but that option is only available if you ask during your order, its not on the menu.\n\nOverall, its decent for a typical sandwich.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-15", "description": "My Mom and I came here with the thought that we were going to appease our sandwich craving. Unfortunately, it was just the opposite. When we had approached the entrance, the guy at the front counter said that he could tell that this was probably our first time. My mom had never been here after many years of working in the area, but I, on the other hand, was part of youth group back in the days and Father H. used to take us here whenever possible. I loved it back then. Unfortunately, can't say the same today. \n\n   I consider myself a foodie since I love food and try new places even when I've not previewed a restaurant before going there, but this really disappointed us being that it has been around for a while, and we thought that this would be a \"for sure\" fulfilling choice.\n\n     So the guy didn't even give us a chance to just deliberate and decide what we wanted, and he told us which ones were the best. I do not like being rushed into ordering. And when my Mom is under pressure, she orders hastily without thought. Nobody should be rushed to make a hasty decision when it comes to food.  I usually order a  roast beef sandwich: light on the mayo, lettuce, tomato, onions( carmelized if offered,) and either swiss or provolone. Simple. That is an order that can hardly be messed up. I like to taste the essence of what I'm eating.\n\n        So I had the roast beef sandwich. I liked that the bread was toasted, but not only did they skimp on the roast beef and it was tasteless, they tried to use lettuce  to fill in where they skimped on the meat, yet still not filling in between  the bread !!!!! WHERE'S THE BEEF??????????\n\n      I guess my idea of a sandwich is one that is filled with not only the lettuce, tomato, and cheese, but stacked with what meat it proclaims to have. If you are not going to offer proper sandwiches, then you should offer a decent size that has a substantial amount of meat asides from the extras that should compliment the meat inside.  Make it  a righteous, good, and tasty meal like a sandwich should be. Thank goodness I only ordered the small sandwich, who knows if they'd have enough roast beef to put into it. \n\n     So, my mom had the pastrami sandwich and regretfully to say, she noticed that her sandwich too was skimped on and that it was equally tasteless. How is that? Pastrami usually adds more flavoring to a sandwich than roast beef, doesn't it? Well, so much for the suggestion that was forced upon my Mom. \n     \n      With that being said, we also ordered the french fries which looked like thick-sliced potatoes. They were good and made up a little for our rather less than mediocre sandwiches. \n\n      I hate  paying for food that leaves my Mom and I  a feeling of dissatisfaction. Times are tough and we should be happy with the food that we choose to go out for.", "author": "Granolia G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-20", "description": "Yellow sub is my favorite oven toasted subs in the bay area -with Sub Center in West Portal a close second. What sets them apart is that they cook the meat only after you order, (which makes it just a bit fresher), then they toast the meat with the bread in the oven. They also make great  'fries\", although they aren't really french fries. They are thick slices of potatoes deep fried, which makes them a little crunchy and a little soft on the inside, just the way I like them. If you like ultra crispy fries, these aren't for you, unless you remember to ask them to make them extra crunchy.\n\nI've tried the turkey, veggie and all the other permutations, but nothing taste like the steak and cheese so I would advise you stick with that.\n\nOne final tip - the old lady can be surly. My advice is just step up to the counter (near the oven/stove, not near the cash register) and wait. Don't order right away. I repeat, don't order right away. In a moment, when she is ready, she will ask you what you want. If you order before she is ready, she doesn't like it. If her boys ask for your order, then go ahead as usual.\n\nFinal note: Sandwiches are huge. I recommend two people sharing one large sandwich and one order of fries. Grab extra napkins.

Nothing outstanding but for $5.50, it was good value especially when you couple it with a $1.35 styrofoam cup of homemade potato salad.\n\nThe challenge here is the lengthy wait. The staff gets a bit flustered when the place gets crowded, and you may want to secure your table in the adjoining room where you can study on the wall a primitive cartoon menu circa 1977 (with the Carter-era prices whited out, of course). But it's right off the N-Judah, a convenient spot if you're heading out to Ocean Beach or Golden Gate Park.\n\nSo take a downer and chill, man...the Sixties will be back, man. Where's Jerry Garcia when you need him?\n\nFOOD - 3.5 stars...a solid sandwich\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a compact place for compact people\nSERVICE - 3 stars...nice guys, attentive when you order...but ah, the wait\nTOTAL - 3 stars...worth the stop if you're coming down from a head trip, man...stop the war!...impeach Nixon!", "author": "Ed U."}

That plus some of the biggest, most delicious hot sandwiches await you at the Yellow Submarine.  This sandwich shop is small in size and very popular on weekends so you can almost always expect to wait as a line often goes out the front door and onto the sidewalk.  The sandwiches are made to order so expect to wait again once you've put in your order.  There are tons of sandwich options written big on one wall and you can choose between a medium sandwich and a large sandwich.  Either choice is quite inexpensive considering the portions you get.  If you're a big eater the large (really large!) is the way to go; for about two dollars more you get almost double everything on the medium.\n\nThey'll apply a mountain of hot-off-the-grill meat and cheese (American, Swiss or Provolone) if you desire onto a fresh sandwich roll and bake it in their huge pizza oven.  So far I've tried the Steak and Cheese, the Roast Beef and the Pepper Steak and Cheese and all of them have been fabulous.  You can have your sandwich with The Works, shredded lettuce, sliced ripe Roma tomatoes, onion, pickles, mayonnaise, mustard, hot sauce, vinegar and oil or any combination of those items.\n\nThe sandwich comes out super toasty.  The bread is hot and crumbly on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside.  The meat and cheese are hot and the fresh vegetables give your sandwich crispness.  If you are especially hungry order up a basket of their homemade french fries.  These are circular similar to potato chips, sliced not-too-thin and fried up to a crispy brown.  There is a large assortment of cold drinks available for purchase.  Eat in or take out, as there is a small seating area where you can sit down and enjoy your sandwich.  Friendly staff too!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

The fries here are actually round chips.  They are absoluetly great!  Make sure to order them well done or crispy, unless you prefer them soggy.  We ordered them well done, but they were not cooked well done.  That was fine because the sandos were huge and amazing.  We got a large pastrami and a large cheese steak.  We split each and quickly finished the pastrami.  They make a huge sandwich here the same way they have been for at least thirty years.  This is a must visit sandwich landmark of San Francisco.

They did not have a visible restroom, so I didn't have a place to wash my hands. \n\nThe cashier recommended the hot pastrami sandwich and fresh cut potato fries.\n\nThe regular sandwich was $7-$8 and the large sandwich was $2 more.  I shared a large and was not able to finish my half of the sandwich.  I liked how the sandwich had grilled onions, but wish they had more meat in it.  I  take small bites, so it took forever to taste the inside of the sandwich cause the bread was too thick. The highlight of the sandwich was that it came out warm. \n\nMy favorite was the fresh cut potato fries, when you separate them and let it cool down, it turns crispy on its own; just like potatoe chips. I also asked for a side of the special hot sauce that every one was yelping about.  The hot sauce just tasted like taco bell hot sauce, not good nor bad.  \n\nI didn't notice anything special about this sandwich place for me to come back again.

There's never that stale old bread texture when you bite into the bread, rather, it's always that just-baked and fresh-out-of-the-oven deliciousness!\n\nMeat: doesn't matter what kind of meat you choose, they give you a LOT of meat for your sandwich. Hot gooey cheese (of your choice) melted on (or cooked into the meat) the juicy deli meat makes a perfect combination\n\nVeggie: they pile on lots of shredded lettuce and tomatoes which gives the sub a refreshing taste and lifts up some of that heaviness from your meat and cheese.\n\nCondiments: besides the regular mustard and mayo, you really should try their homemade \"hot\" hot sauce if you're into spicy food. It definitely wakes up your palette with a \"heeellllooo\" knock on the door!\n\nSo far I've tried their steak and cheese, pepper steak, and turkey subs, all of them have been excellent and tasty.

They use fresh tomatoes and clean lettuce, a hard thing to find these days. The place has lots of options in hot sandwiches, my favorite being the pepper steak, a sandwich with grilled green peppers and lean steak. Another good option is the Reuben. These people do it the right way, with lots of good meat and topping it with Thousand Island dressing. They always ask if you want the works and don't charge extra for anything basic. The sandwiches come on fresh rolls and you have a choice of medium-sized and larger sized sandwiches, which are good for about two meals for some people.\n\nThis place seems family-owned and the workers are nice.

I put the sandwich down and opened it up to find that the sub was filled with mostly shredded lettuce, a couple of pickles, three small, roughly cut chucks (not slices) of tomatoes and sauces.  The small 1/2 inch cut pieces of meat that was there was mixed with mostly grilled onions.  \n\nTo pay $10 for Reuben and then get what looked and tasted more like a veggie sandwich was disappointing and ruined the game.

There's never more than three people working there and at lunch time it can get crowded but the people working there are very friendly and try their best to get your food to you as quickly as possible. \n\nIf you're in a huge rush I might not suggest it but for those trying to get a good bite to eat in the Sunset this is a wonderful place to do it. The portions are big (sizes are medium and large) and there's always room to sit inside. Just make sure you bring your appetite with you. \n\nLast but not least I suggest the reuben.

This place has been here for a while because i remember as a kid i used to always pass by this place on my way to elementary school. Since its been here that long, they must have been doing something right. \n\nI have been looking for a place to get a quick bite before i hit the library at UCSF and I would say i did not make a bad decision. I've tried the hot pastrami and pepper steak, both were delicious, but i found the pepper steak to be more tasty because the meat was more heartier. \n\nIf your going to compare this place to Little Lucca's in South San Francisco, then i would definitely pick Little Lucca's. Why? Well i like lots of meat in my sandwiches and Little Lucca's gives me that (boy do they). I'm not saying yellow submarine is cheap on the meat, because they give you a good portion, but i just would prefer more :). \n\nOn the positive note, yellow submarine is very flavorful, with a mouthful of flavor with every bite. The bread is awesome. Its soft and perfectly toasted. I've never had bread like this from any other sandwich shop and its just perfect. I remember trying there fries a long time ago and i did not like it. They were not crunchy, but were just sliced potatoes (like potato chips) that tasted like they were cooked in oil. Like i said, its been a while so maybe a lot has changed and its crispy now.\n\nParking is an issue in this part of the sunset. I always end up circling the block a few times before finding parking.\n\nThe service is great. Employees always have a positive attitude and do there best to get your order as soon as possible. There is something i've been wondering after the few times i've been going and that is, are they twin brothers behind the counter? hehe. I swear the guy that takes the order and the guy that cooks, looks exactly alike. Eh, whatever :/.\n\nOverall great sandwich spot.

I used to sit in bed on boring nights and read people's reviews as a cheap source of entertainment - entertainment meaning laughing at people who actually think others really want to read their restaurant reviews. But here I am, writing a review, and it's because I would be doing the food gods a disservice to not give The Yellow Submarine 5 stars after eating there. Come along on an adventure with me.\n\nI just moved into my new place in San Francisco a week ago and needed a quick bite to eat. I asked my roommates for some good places and they suggested TYS (is it ok to call it that?). So I went and got the hot pastrami sandwich with everything on it. I heart hot pastrami subs. So when I got mine, I was clearly ecstatic. Only one thing; I forgot to ask for the sandwich to come without mustard. I despise mustard. It was honestly my biggest fear for years. My friends threatened me with mustard to get me to do things. And it worked. Normally, I'd take the sandwich back and kindly ask for a new one, or, at the very least, a new bun. But I didn't want my first encounter with the lovely folks at TYS to end with them labeling me as a \"no sandwich for you\" guy, so I decided to stick it out and put my brave kid hat on. I took a bite, expecting the worst... But it was the complete opposite. All the flavors - the pastrami, the crisp lettuce, the fantastically grilled onions, the hot sauce (!!!), and the mustard (???) - blended perfectly to bring me the closest I've ever gotten to a food-induced schwing!!! moment. (A quick note on the hot sauce. Purely brilliant. Not crazy spicy but adds a fantastic kick to an already delicious sub.) Now, the next day I got a sandwich for lunch at work - not from TYS. And I specifically asked for mustard on it. \n\nI'll sum it up for you. Not only did TYS delivery a completely delicious sandwich that far exceeded the great expectations I had from the rave reviews from my roommates, but it completely changed my views on my most hated food in the world.

It used to be I looked forward to heading to Togo's for my regular pastrami fix, but no longer. \n\nWhat makes the sandwiches here so great is the combination of grilling the meat and onions, toasting both on the bread, and then adding top quality toppings, especially their awesome home made hot sauce. Add in the killer hand cut potatoes that are fried while you wait and the result is phenomenal. A recipe for a heart attack for sure, but I may as well enjoy life while I can. \n\nThe other sandwich I eat regularly is the pepper steak, which is great for all the same reasons as the pastrami. \n\nTo add on top of the great sandwiches, I have to agree with the other yelp'ers that the service is super friendly and the prices are pretty darn good. \n\nMy one suggestion would be to call in your order ahead of time as it does take 10 or more minutes for them to make your sandwich when they're busy at lunch time.", "author": "Chris S."}

Even though I try to make them at home, it's just never the same. \n\nSo Eugy and I came here and got some sandwiches to take with us to sneak into the Sundance Kabuki. I opted for the meatball sub with extra cheese and onions. Eugy had the hot pastrami with everything on it and the extra spicy sauce. \n\nMy meatball sub was mediocre at best. The sauce had NO FLAVOR at all and was in desperate need of salt. The meatballs were ok, but nothing to get excited over. Eugy said his pastrami was ok, but again, nothing to get really excited over. \n\nPop's Sandwich shop still has the best meatball grinder in my opinion. And Sub Center has the best subs. Especially the turkey. Yum!", "author": "Jen D."}

I haven't tried anything else except the steak and cheese because seriously, that sandwich is literally made to perfection. *drools* I usually order a medium because that is enough for my stomach. The large is HUGE! I always split the large amount of fries, which are greasy slices of potatoes, with someone. Definitely one of my favorite spots to go to!\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it five stars is because they need to expand the dining area! There are only a handful of tables and the room is literally the size of my living room. The last time I was there, I felt like I had to whisper to my boyfriend.

I used to pass by this place often but never ate here until maybe college.  Since then, it's been one of my closeby lunch options when I wake up late and there's no food at home.\n\nI've come to realize that the only sandwich I really like here is the pastrami.  The last couple of times here I tried the pepper steak and the roast beef.  They were both okay.  I think there's a little too much bread and not enough meat compared to other sandwich places.  But really, you can't go wrong with pastrami.  I just think with a little more meat the sandwiches would be better (more meat does not always mean better).  Even though the bread can be too thick, they're nicely toasted most of the time.  I haven't tried the other options, so maybe there's something else on the menu I would like as well.  \n\nI seem to always get the 'fries'.  Really.  Almost always.  I go in there thinking,\"Okay, I'm just going to get a sandwich.  No fries\"\n...\n\"Hi, what would you like?\"\n\"I'll have a regular pastrami, everything but onions.\"\n\"Okay...would you like fries with that?\n\"Yes, and an Orangina/Orange n' Cream, please.\"\n\nArgh no willpower whatsoever.  Not even a pause.\n\nThey're not actually fries, but more like fried thick potato slices.  But the people there call it fries.  I like them, but one order to me is too much for just myself.  There are well over 15 large slices in an order.  By the time I'm halfway through, it's kind of a chore to finish.  I think sharing it with another would be perfect though.\n\nIf I'm craving for a sandwich during a lunch break, this is the place for me.  And I will be there with my pastrami sandwich, drink, and an order of fries.", "author": "Oliver C."}

I ordered a medium steak and cheese with fries on the side.  What came out of their kitchen was what seemed like an everest of meat and cheese all over toasted french bread stuffed with \"the works\", all of their default add-ons, and on the side was a heaping basket of fried potato slices.  Long story short:  the food was really good.  The quality and serving size seemed more than reasonable for the ~$9 I spent.

No thank you. \n\nMedium (aka \"regular\") is a filling size for a girl. The large is a super filling size for a man. \n\nThe works has all kinds of man things on it, like mustard and peppercinis and pickles and hot sauce and oil and vinegar. \n\nTheir fries are actually homemade chips. They are good but sometimes too soggy. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend calling ahead and then just picking up. They have a full menu online and be ready to spit out your order quick and with the proper lingo. (i.e. I'd like a regular turkey with lettuce, tomato, cheese ONLY, a large italian with the works, and 2 orders of fries.)\n\nSomehow asking for a large Italian with the works, is fun. \n\nps- There is only one kind of bread. \npps- If I was a man, this would be a 5 star review.

Sadly, I have yet to complete my search, but this place does come very close.\nThis is a very old sandwich place in the Inner Sunset, which has very good sandwiches.  Anytime I go a place that has great reviews, I either get the Reuben or the Cheesesteak.  The Reuben here was very, very good.  Probably the best I have had in the City.  The turkey is also well made and they don't put so much mayo and mustard on it you lose the taste of turkey.  I like that.\nI have not ordered the Cheesesteak because I hate eating them when they are not properly made.  People think I am weird, but you can't have any cheese other than Cheese-Whiz on them; it's just wrong.  Unfortunately, no one here on the West Coast follows that ideology.  Hopefully, I can begin to convert others to follow the true way and have an actual Philly Cheesesteak.\nIn the meantime, I will be more than happy to \"settle\" for this place's fantastic Reubens.

But a couple of people ahead of me ordered the pepper steak, so I went with that.\n\nYou can tell them to make it the works and they'll throw everything into those bad boys.  You get a choice from one of the three cheeses; cheddar, swiss and provolone. And to top it off, you can have them put hot sauce.  I wasn't feeling the hot sauce at the time, so I decided not to go with that.  Hmm, a mistake?  Man, these are some solid, good tasting subs.\n\nThe pepper steak was pretty tasty. It had a good amount of meat, but I was hoping for a little more flavor.  Maybe I should of went with the hot sauce!\n\nThe pastrami on the other hand was delicous.  Yes, the pastrami is shredded just the way I like it.  It's heavy on black pepper which was nice.  My only gripe was that they didn't throw more pastrami into my sub.  So, this pastrami sammy is just a notch below Submarine Center's sub.\n\nThe best part of Yellow Submarine's sandwiches is that they gave me an option to include sauteed onions with my subs.

Once i arrived I found the place on the corner and was kind of surprised how small it was overall. Ordering was easy since the line was never too long and very straight forward as they made everything fresh.\n\nNow I've experienced places like Gene's on Taraval and the Sub Center at West Portal and can say that this place compares with the other places. I ordered a Pastrami sandwich and it was solid. The bread was crisp and the ingredients were very fresh. The only thing that I could say that I wish was improved on was the taste of the pastrami. After trying so many places in my life I felt that the meat could have been a little more tasty to say the least. But if your on a budget it's nice to know that they offer different sizes to fit your wallet so that's never a bad thing. Solid place to come to if your looking for a good lunch.", "author": "Jason Y."}

And the menu has remained the same from day one. They must be doing something right. \n\nI'm crazy about Philly cheese steak. It is the only thing I order from Safeway's deli counter. So, I decided to try their steak and cheese sub. It's supposed to be the most popular item on the menu. \n\nThe bread was just the right size and perfectly toasted. The steak was tender and delicately flavored, with a hint of spice from the homemade hot sauce they added to my sandwich. The veggies were fresh and crisp. Overall, I was happy with my choice. For $5.85, it's a great deal.\n\nI guess after being in business for three decades, they've mastered the art of making a perfect subway sandwich. The portions are just enough for each ingredient that your tongue may end up dancing to the tune of the famous 60's Beattles song once the flavors of the ingredients settle in. \n\nIt's a good old fashioned sandwich shop that's reliable, consistent and fast at an affordable price.", "author": "Carol G."}

I tried Sub Center on a friend's suggestion and the difference in the taste is really hard to believe.  I'd almost prefer a Yellow Sub bread sandwich (just the bread) to anything at Sub Center.

Nothing could be farther from the truth.\n\nAfter placing our to-go order of 1 large sandwich we retired out front to make room for the over 1/2 dozen other folks who came in minutes behind us. To our horror, the cooks make 8-12 sandwiches, all out of order from when we placed our order. It seems that \"sandwiches made to order\" is not high on their list of customer service philosophies. My best guess is they make all the sandwiches with the most orders placed, which put our order dead last, as many we're steak&cheese or Phillys.\nAt least eight people were served before us, which was 30 minutes after we arrived to an empty restaurant, first in line. Service is horrible, and that's being kind.\n\nOn to the \"Boston Style\" Italian sub sandwich. There we're a total of 6 thin slices of meat inside, 4 slices of poor grade mortadella, and 2 small slices of what looked like pepperoni. None of the meats we're classic Italian, and we're basic cold cuts. The \"Works\" ended up being lettuce, 2 thin tomatoes, 1 single pickle, no peppers, no onions, no oil, no vinegar, no pepper, no salt, and no hot sauce. These ingredients are listed for every sandwich on the wall menu, but not to be seen in the actual sandwich.\nAt last, it was toasted, which in itself is not a bad thing, but being a Boston native, I never saw a toasted submarine sandwich in the entire Tri-State area of New England.\n\nDon't waste your time, this place is the pits, a waste of money, and time.

I'm a sucker for anything grilled but onions especially and had to peek inside. \n\nOK, the sandwiches at this place are HUGE. Come hungry. I first thought they were toasting baguettes in their oven but no, those are just the large sandwiches. I decided to go for the medium because I already had to poop and didn't want to think about what a sandwich the size of my forearm would do to my already taxed digestive track. Thanks but I don't need my shit to have corners.\n\nMmm, I couldn't wait for those onions on my sandwich. I got the steak and cheese because it seemed appropriate at a sub shop. My friend got a pastrami and we split a basket of fries which I will get to a bit later. The service itself is so-so. It takes a while to grill the onions with the meat, toast the bread and put the fixin's on. I wouldn't stop in if you're in a rush or need to catch the Muni which stops right outside. \n\nOnce your meat is in the bread, you get a choice of a bunch of fixin's. This place gets extra props for offering hot sauce on their sandwiches which I capitalized on. The fries themselves are not your average thin sticks of greasy goodness. You get huge freakin slices of a potato cut in half! I'd never seen fries like it and man were they good.

The sandwiches are unbelievably good. I'm usually your straight laced, turkey on wheat bread, no steak, no salami , no ham, no pastrami kinda girl. But at the Yellow Submarine, it's the pepper steak sandwich all the way for me. Imagine a Philly cheesesteak sandwich but with lettuce and tomatoes. Delicious. The splash of hot vinegar gives it a extra little kick too. Also if you like things spicy, go with the homemade hot sauce, my male classmates go crazy over it. And remember always always order a side of 'fries', not your typical freedom fries but more so of a thick cut potato chip. It's crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.

Fortunately, the bread was good and maintained structural integrity. The pastrami itself was alright, though I faintly was reminded of philly cheesesteak for some reason. Although the extra toppings were bland and characterless, it was all and all a decent sandwich.\n\nService tho polite, was a tad perfunctory, but hey they keep the line moving and my sub came out pretty quick and  smartly wrapped so no complaints\n\nI work nearby so I can see myself going again, probably to check out the fries. But otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way to find the place when there are other delis that are on par elsewhere.", "author": "R L."}

I also heard that their sandwiches were paired with great fries so it was a must for me to visit. \nI ordered a Italian special and it was goood. I ate the medium size sandwich which was BIG, I could of ate only half and been good to go...but I didn't and just ate the whole thing cause it was damn good.  I don't even know what kind of people could eat a large size, it is definitely a sandwich that would need to be shared. The fries came out in \"chip\" or flat style, and they were really good. I immediately had to take a picture so I could show my friends later. A couple of these fries were about the same size as my Coke can! Some of the chips were crunchy and others were crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. I didn't mind because I like the change up. But when I go in next time, I will probably ask for the fries well done, or crispy. I just hope it doesn't dry them out. \nThis was my first time there, but I will definitely go back. I will leave them with 4 stars for now and hopefully be able to bring my rating to excellent after a couple more visits. I would definitely recommend the Yellow Submarine. \n\nEDIT: I have been there 6 times now, and I have figured out that I love the Italian combo, and really don't care to try anything else.

Being from the east coast, I was encouraged by seeing \"Boston Style\" on the signage outside.  We had to get there early, my friend said, before the lunch rush, so it was about 11:30.  We got there just before the line started forming. Though the true east coast test for me, a New Jersey native, would be to order an Italian \"submarine\" sandwich (ham, capicola, salami, provolone, with shredded lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar), I wanted something HOT since I had skipped breakfast.   I ordered the medium meatball sandwich.   The question I got from the man behind the counter made me seriously doubt the east coast authenticity:  \"Do you want everything on that?\"  Inwardly I cringed.   This has happened to me at several other old time supposedly east coast style sandwich shops in California up and down the west coast.    Listen west coast people,  a hot sandwich--whether it is meatball, or chicken parmesan, or Italian sausage and pepper--should NOT be covered with cold lettuce, tomatoes, mayo mustard and unmelted cheese.  Kind of defeats the purpose of ordering hot food when you have cold food piled on top.   Don't get that? Then you must be from CA, but that's O.K.   Not to worry.  I just declined the long \"everything\" list to limit my order to be a hot meatball sandwich (no cold mustard salad on top). The order took a little longer than I expected, but when it arrived...!!!\nThe bread was lightly toasted to perfection, soft and warm, with a generous portion of meat filling.   This was the best meatball sandwich I have ever had on the west coast.  I will come back, for sure, and if their cold cuts impress me as much as this hot item did, then I will  add another star.        Bravo!

This is one of the best, if not the best (hu)man-made creation. The bread soaks up some of the marinara, and the breaded veal with the parmesan. I can barely organize coherent thoughts thinking about this.\n\nI'll go through the ritual: I've been sitting at my computer for the day, doing inane internet work, and this epiphany dawns on me \"Yellow submarine, Veal parm...NOW\" so I put on whatever clothing I can find, a dapper ensemble consisting of stained pants and a faded shirt, accompanied by holy(!) socks and one of 9 pairs of black chucks. I sprint to my poorly designed, soon to be ignored American vehicle, and start on the 15 minute drive to get there. I calculate the creation time and call when I'm at 19th and Holloway. Phone answers \"Yellow submarine.\" Me: \"Large veal parm with everything\" \"You got it\", \"I'll be there in ten\". DONE. I find a suspicious parking spot just a few inches shorter than my car and I sprint in. I drop a ten-spot with the biggest grin on my face since the Red Flyer days of my youth, see he agrees with my sentiment and hear \"That's a helluva sandwich\" and I respond with a hearty \"Damn right!\" and I sprint to my car. \n\nTo make a long story short it goes like this: speed home, sit, remove excess clothing that inhibits arm and mandible movement, open the paper, consume the sandwich stem to stern and basically spend 20 minutes in a haze of splendor, whose magnitude I can barely put into words. \n\nGo there. Eat. Sit in a wobbly chair. Read the wall 23 times. Cry at the fact that you can't always be eating a large veal parm with everything, and then sleep outside so you can go back for dinner.\n\nOh yea, everything else there is amazing too.

The \"meatballs\" were waiting in a pan with sauce sitting on the grill top staying warm, and the medium was much smaller than i expected, in fact, i was still really hungry afterward. \n\nThe sandwich was OK at best, but what really turned me off was that I was certain that i tasted ketchup in the sauce, and to me that is just a COMPLETE TURN-OFF! I DO NOT like it when a company goes cheap and uses ketchup instead of tomato sauce.\n\nNeedless to say, while I may return to try some of the other selections(and that big selection is what gives it three stars), i was not really pleased as the place did NOT live up to the rep it had been given.", "author": "Ruben S."}

I'm guessing that it is family owned since I always see the familiar faces of an old lady and her son every time I stop by. They are very friendly and will make your sandwich to your exact specifications. I also try to eat here whenever I visit home. Their subs are amazingly good and are made to order. You can never go wrong with steak and cheese with the works (minus the mayo for me). The pepper steak and cheese is also very good. They give you plenty of meat and the size of the sandwich is bigger than it looks. Go for a medium and you will be pretty full. Opt for the large as I always do and you're probably overdoing it. The most unique thing about this place? I think it's their potato fries/chips. They are not your usual steak fries or shoestring fries. They are round cut and are the perfect thickness. They are lightly salted and a perfect side to go with your delicious sandwich. They have little squeeze bottles of ketchup and if you look around you, you will see people dressing their fries in many different ways. Since they have such a fat cut, you will see kids drawing happy faces on them and ketchup lovers building a mountain before eating them. For me, I swirl my ketchup on my fry.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-09", "description": "Inner Sunset's version of the famous Submarine Center in West Portal, my favorite sandwich shop in the area.  They make the same kind of toasted bread, hot sub sandwiches with great toppings.  Even the menu board looks like the same font, perhaps done by the same person generations ago.\n\nA few notable differences:  \n- Larger seating area.  It has all of the charm of a church rec-room (no frills), but at least it's not crowded.  When I went, it was occupied by men in their late 30's/early 40's only.  Like the mafia-esque Men's Clubs that are all over Hoboken NJ (think Sopranos)\n- Two sizes of sandwiches, instead of 3.  Medium and Large.  Large is HUGE.  For $7.25 for a large, enough to feed two people, that's quite a bargain.\n- No jalapenos.  I panicked as my husband must have these on his cheese steak, and it's my job to make sure they're on there.  No worries!  They have a great home-made hot sauce  which is delicious and offers a very satisfying kick.\n- More chewy less crusty bread.  I actually liked the bread better than at the Submarine Shop, because the toasty bits didn't threaten to rip up my mouth at all.\n- They offer a Reuben, but without Thousand Island dressing.  To me, this means, they DON'T offer a Reuben.  A corned beef or pastrami sandwich?  Sure.\n- Fries.  I've read that they are good.  The fryer wasn't on (it was 4pm, so only me and the sandwich junkies were out getting sandwiches anyway).  I'll try these next time, and if they're good, I'll consider rounding up to 5 stars.\n- ATM at the entrance, right by the front door.  If you are like me and constantly cash-less, this is a very nice convenience.\n\nI highly recommend:  Cheese Steak with everything + hot sauce, Italian Combo with everything.\n\nI do not recommend: the Veal Parmesan.  Blah.  Stick to the sliced meat sandwiches.\n\nService was East-Coast-style friendly.  Meaning, it was factual and to the point while we negotiated what they had vs. what I wanted.  Then, when business was concluded, we had a nice chat.  They greeted some customers by name, which I liked a lot.  \n\nThere is a big public parking lot up the street on 6th, which is extremely convenient as I've left this neighborhood more than once for lack of parking.\n\nNothing tastes better on a rainy and cold day than a warm, well-made, sandwich, esp when you are a bit *ahem* hung over from a fabulous party the night before (or so I HEAR ;) ).  Yellow Submarine will definitely be on my list for sought-after comfort foods on such days, and I am sure many others.", "author": "Liz S."}

Not that they're deformed or insanely huge, but since I'm almost always wearing flip-flops they tend to get quite calloused and dirty.  Luckily I bathe everyday.  So when Bam-Bam and I decided to have a picnic in the park today, we stopped by the Yellow Submarine for some goodies.  Our sandwiches were quickly made by friendly people, a couple of drinks and some of the really-greasy-yet-really-good fried potatoes, and we were out the door and on our way to the Botanical Gardens in GG Park.  What does this have to do with my feet?\nWell, when we sat down and started devouring our sandwiches, Bam-Bam almost had a piece of salami shoot out her nose because of how disgusted she was with my feet.  What's a boy to do?  We'd been walking through the park on dusty trails for almost two hours...no amount of explaining could get me off the hook.  Luckily for her I tucked my feet under me in an Indian sit, and luckily for me she was WAY too into her sandwich to really care all that much.  \nYellow Submarine...not the best sandwiches in the world, but for a decent enough picnic lunch in the park, it's ok.  I still would rather have a sandwich from Say Cheese...mmm...now THOSE are good!", "author": "Zev K."}

I usually order the turkey or the avocado sandwiches. They definitely don't disappoint. Sometimes it does take a while for the sandwiches to come out, but this usually happens when they are busy. Their sandwiches are nice, but sometimes they pack on a lot of vegetable opposed to the \"star\" of the sandwich, such as the turkey and avocados. Their round-cut potato slices do fall short in my opinion. They are surely freshly-cut, but they aren't really crispy and are just kind of round-sliced potatoes that have been fried. Sometimes they aren't crispy. But then again, it is a sandwich place.", "author": "Vivian L."}

The one caveat is that in my humble opinon, you really have to get the works (everything) on the sandwich in order to capture the essence of what it is that makes it good.

Sure enough once I finally made it there this was exactly the case.  The sandwiches are delicious.  I normally get a salami one since the toasting really brings out the flavor of the salami, but in my opinion every sandwich is better toasted.  The sandwiches are big as well. Best I have had in San Francisco.", "author": "Eric M."}

You can get huge sandwiches that are essentially two normal sized sandwiches in one. I recommend the Italian combo. The circular home-style fries are delicious as well. The only thing holding back the yellow submarine from a five star rating is the slowness with which they make sandwiches. I expect to wait ten minutes even when there's only a few customers. The cash register is just a few feet from the entrance of the restaurant so if there are more than three or four people in line, you will stand outside. The move here is calling ahead to order, and then picking up the sandwiches to nullify the wait. The staff is friendly too which is a little added bonus.", "author": "Jack D."}

I eventually got my meal. I ate the fries first; they were bigger and earthier than any fries that I have ever had. Still, they tasted good. The sandwich was amazing. For a $5.60 sandwich, it was LOADED. I didn't get a chance to eat it until later that night, but it was worth it in the end. It tasted delicious. And the people were so friendly and nice, even amid all the activity. I even mentioned the \"Check Please\" review and they were happy. Would I rush back? No. But will I go back? Yes.", "author": "Alex S."}

(wait I do lie, because I've also tried the not so memorable homemade potato chips but they were a bit too greasy for me so good effort).  I absolutely adore this hole in the wall.  The service is always fast and friendly, definitely not the fake type of nice.  Prices might be a dollar or two above your average subway or quiznos but you definitely get your money's worth because the sandwich is HUMUNGOUS.  A medium (or normal) sized sub is big enough to be split between two, and the large sized sub will definitely satisfy two hungry people.  They are more than generous with their toppings: lettuce, onions, bell pepper, fresh tomatoes galore, cheese, dressing, and to top it all off they toast the sandwich to perfection.  Basically, I highly recommend this place if you are craving a good sandwich for lunch.", "author": "Megan L."}

I was going to get a large, but upon seeing the large sandwich being handed to the person before me, I decided on a medium. I thought the medium was fairly large, great for the price. I think I would have liked the sandwich more if it had just a little more vinegar and hot sauce, but that is all just preference.  My bf decided on a hot pastrami sandwich and he enjoyed it. We decided to order the meal, which came with a drink and cole slaw or potato salad for like 3 dollars more. The bottle of water was a larger size, but the cole slaw that we ordered( which he ended up giving us potato salad by mistake) was actually a really small serving. We also ordered a side of fresh cut potatoes, which were cut like potato chips. The potatoes were soggy, but still tasty. They definitely would have been a whole lot better if they were deep fried fresh, I think they were sitting around for a bit or they did not fry them long enough, not sure which. I would come here again, if I were in the area and try another sandwich. Service is awesome! Be warned, there is no restroom here to wash your hands if you dine in.", "author": "carebear l."}

Ordered the large (I was starving) pastrami sub with everything on it and a side of fries, my friend has a regular peppersteak with side of fries as well and we both had beverages, $22 and change. The order of fries is large and we could have shared. They are fried sliced potatoes basically, not crunchy but on the soft side. My pastrami was good although it coulda used a bit more meat. Good place but unimpressed, the both of us. BUT I will come by again and try something else soon as I love subs...So far I think AK subs rocks this place.", "author": "Steve K."}

This lead to wilted veggies, and goopy cheese. Yet, this is exactly what the Yellow Submarine chose to do. On top of this, the french fries were a variety of \"tasty chips\". They were simply round sliced potatoes that were deep fried for a bit in oil. The end result were round, soggy bits of potato. Very few had crunch, and the majority were just drenched in oil.", "author": "Kelli T."}

I came in with exactly $8 in my wallet, and came out with a gigantic steak and cheese AND a free limonata.   The guy that made the sandwich was friendly and chatty, he told the guy behind me that he has worked there for 6 years.  That seems like some serious commitment for a sandwich artist.  They might want to get rid of the AIDS bike ride donation form from 2004 on the wall in the dining room, but whatever.  The sandwich was so delicious that I almost ate the entire thing before realizing how ridiculously full I was and that meant I got delicious yummy fantastic food for lunch the next day.  So if you want a good giant sized sandwich, head on over to The Yellow Submarine, you can't miss it with it being right in front of the N stops...  Oh but the only reason I deducted a star was for the cash only policy, I accept it in bars but not restaurants, its an thing of mine that really makes no sense.  But I will say that they have an ATM machine that currently only charges $1.95 to take money from it.", "author": "Meredith N."}

I always get the turkey with swiss and grilled onions.  If i'm not terribly ravenous, half of the medium keeps pretty well for a satisfying lunch the next day.  The sandwiches really are huge.  I liked this place more before the most recent price hike.  It used to be the best deal in town.  Now it's a good deal but not the best.  Plus, the crazy old ladies (aka \"The Sandwich Nazis) are no longer cute to me.  The past couple of times I've been in there they were downright rude.  I was there to pick up and order that was called in.  I said I was there to pick up an order and was told it wasn't ready.  No problem.  I'd just wait.  She proceeded to ask  if she could help me 3 more times, each time sounding more annoyed than the last.  Each time I told her I was waiting for a pick up.  And each time she told me it wasn't ready yet.  Maybe she's just losing it.  Either way I'll keep going here because the sandwiches are good and I live a couple blocks away.", "author": "M M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-03-29", "description": "The Yellow Submarine has the third best sandwich that I have had so far in San Francisco.  They have a basic menu and they make a basic toasted sandwich which turns out pretty good.  I've tried pretty much everything they have and I still like the turkey and cheese the best.  They also have a hot sauce that they put on sandwiches if you ask which is a huge plus for anyone who likes a little kick.  Their fries are also pretty good.   On the downside the service isn't that good, there is no where to park, and the place hasn't been changed in it looks like 30 years.   The way you order your sandwich is unconventional, confusing, and inefficient and the older lady who usually is making the sandwiches gets annoyed by you for everything you order.  I like the sandwiches but I have found myself seeking alternative sandwich places unless I am in the immediate area.", "author": "Chris H."}
