She invited me to watch the live performances on Sunday and I had a great time. I believe she told me the chef isn't from Egypt but learned to cook there (don't quote me on that). Food isn't out of this world but tastes like a decent homemade versus a friendly restaurant. Plus it's buffet style which is nice. Service was friendly though we weren't checked up on much (though it's possibly due to our awkward location).\n\nMy friend and I were seated at the table closest to the door so I did have a slightly awkward angle but on the bright side that also meant I wasn't approached by the dancers who were gorgeous and talented but I'm an awkward potato and don't want to interact with strangers.\n\nParking in the area is a bit difficult. Even on a Sunday we had to go up and down every block looking for a spot until we finally found one a few blocks away. I was a little worried because the restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived. A few tables were filled but otherwise there were a few musicians, an open buffet, and only a few guests. However over time the night picked up. At no point was there a flood of people out the door but between the employees, dancers, musicians, and guests there was a festive and fun atmosphere that I really enjoyed. However, I would have felt very awkward coming here alone or with people that aren't already familiar with the business because it felt like a very intimate atmosphere.\n\nAs for the food, I'm speaking as someone with limited knowledge about Egyptian food. My friend has some knowledge and approves but I don't always see eye to eye with her. From my limited knowledge I felt like the food was fine. It tasted like homemade food. Like someone's mom really wanted to give it her all at the school potluck. Some items were overcooked but at least they weren't shy with the seasoning.\n\n-Hummus was decent though the pita was a bit tough\n-Musa'ah Bil Lahma (Eggplant w/ ground beef, tomato, raisins, & nuts): Pretty tasty. Something that I feel like you can easily recreate at home but it's still a spiced and rather balanced dish that works well together\n-Al Masri Salad: Light acidic salad. Nice light item to go with the other items.\n-Vermicelli Rice Pilaf: I quite enjoyed this take on rice pilaf. The noodles add some interesting textures and as a whole it was almost buttery.\n-The main downfall items were the proteins. One of the chicken dishes was fairly juicy (I believe it was the Taggen Firakh) but the other chicken and fish dishes I got were very dry.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my experience here. The food was perfect but it was decent, the experience lasted more than a few hours, I left very full, and had a generally great time. Would love to come again.", "author": "Vivian C."}

It makes you forget that you are in the outer richmond district. There are very few Egyptian restaurants in San Francisco. If you want to try Egyptian food, this is a good place to go to.  Customer service is very good and friendly.\n\nBased on my previous visits,  the Sunday All You Can Eat Buffet is a good deal.  They do have belly dance performances after 7:30 pm.

This would be unheard of anywhere else in SF. I already had a feeling that this place was going to be a disappointment. \n\nWe sat down and were greeted by who I'm guessing is the owner who commented that the server was running late (who apparently was supposed to also be the dancer...we didn't stay long enough to see what that was going to be like). Being the only people there we were able to order quickly. 2 other parties came in after us and they waited probably a good 5 minutes before anyone came back out from the kitchen to seat them or greet them (they all just took their seats anyway). \n\nGot our food and it was pretty decent. Not the best Middle Eastern food I've had...but definitely not worth the $30/person AFTER using a $25 off coupon. For that much money I expect better quality, better service and a happily stuffed belly. I'm guessing we paid extra for the belly dancing that never started while we were there for an hour. This is kind of like those restaurants you see on TV where you wonder how they're surviving because they're probably not making the rent and is in need of some new juju.

Even stranger is waiting 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge your presence.  Turns out that was a sign of things to come, as we spent the majority of our evening at Al Masri waiting--waiting for water, waiting for drinks, waiting for food, waiting for the bill.  Our meal took an hour and 45 minutes from start to finish, and for most of that time we were the only customers in the entire restaurant.  No one ever came to refill our waters, no one came to ask if we were enjoying our meal.  The only bright spot was the belly dancer, although it was a little awkward since there was only an audience of two.  \n\nThe food we ate ranged from good to forgettable.  The hummus and baba ghannug were yummy, though I didn't care for the oily fried pita that came with them.  My husband really enjoyed his baked fish dish, but my falafel (which I was excited to try, since it is made with fava beans rather than chickpeas) was bone dry.

I also loved the belly dancing they provide on the hour!\n\nWe ordered the Maza for two, which had a little bit of all their appetizers, including hummus, Baba Ghannuug, Zabadi Bil Toom (garlic yogurt and cucumbers), dolmas, 2 pieces of feta cheese, 2 falafel.  This dish was really good!  I would recommend this to everyone who goes!  You could tell all the items were homemade.  \n\nWe also ordered the Kushari.  This was one dish I was really excited about (especially after hearing about it first on No Reservations -  Egypt episode).

Also the \"hot sauce\" was not even that hot.  This dish was a disappointment and it lacked flavor.  It was just a blend of the lentils, macaroni pasta, and white rice, with onion rings on top, nothing special.  I felt like I could have made this at home.\n\nWe also ordered the Cornish Game Hen, which was a special of the day.  The hen was good, but again, I felt like I could just bake on at  home too.

The boxes there are just dixie paper bowl that are then covered with aluminum foil. So we asked our waitress for a bag (since we would have to carry these bowls on the bus), and she kept telling us that they don't have bags there.

It came with rice, which was really plain and tasteless. It felt like a gallon of canola oil was poured into the soup.\nNote to cheff: you want to equalize a flavorful soup with a neutral rice, but, how can I put it, in this case, soup and rice were both missing a chromosome?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-19", "description": "I have to admit I'm quite surprised that this place has an average three star rating. The only reason I didn't give this place a five star rating (\"As good as it gets!\") is that I have never tried any other Egyptian restaurant, nor have I been to Egypt, so I cannot make a fair comparison on whether what I ate was authentic and as good as it gets. What I DO know is that everything was DELICIOUS. With that said...\n\nMy friend and I arrived at 5:45PM on a Thursday evening (admittedly an early dinner), with a $40 off coupon I had bought on Amazon Local. At 5:45PM we were the first ones in the place, and the only ones there until about 6:30PM, and our server was most attentive and sweet. It's a very small place, somewhat dimly lit but with fun, interesting Egyptian-esque decor. The place felt very warm and inviting - I think it's a family run establishment, and it felt very personal to be there. On the exterior, despite the bright blue sign, the restaurant is easy to miss, sort of stuffed between two dull residential buildings, and without windows you almost question what exactly is going on in there...\n\nWe started with two appetizers: the Hummus Bil Tahina and the Zabadi Bil Toom. Entrees ordered were the chicken kebab, Kebab Firakh (my friend's) and the layered eggplant with ground beef, Musa'ah Bil Lahma (mine). My entree in particular was HUGE and as much as I wanted to, I could not finish it and had to bring it home. This did not stop me from ordering dessert, however. Desserts vary each day but last night's order was of a honey cake and a plate of coconut covered, doughnut hole looking things (\"fingers\" they were called), that were both wonderful. \n\nAs we arrived at 5:45PM and had a leisurely dinner, we got to enjoy the short belly dancing show that began at 7:30PM. Per the restaurant, the shows are at 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30PM. It was a fun way to savor our dessert and enjoy a little entertainment. \n\nI took a quick look at the complaints people made (you can't please everyone!) and some of them are a bit ridiculous. Overpriced? With three glasses of wine between us, the bill after sales tax came to about $94. Apps average about $5-8, entrees $20-25, desserts $4-5. This is SAN FRANCISCO and this is NORMAL. The menu not having much variety? It's a small establishment, probably seats about 50 total, and I feel like the lack of variety is overshadowed by the quality of the food. Yes there are only 9 entree options on the menu (and maybe one daily special) - if you can't make a choice among 10 items, maybe you're better off going to TGI Fridays!\n\nOverall, a great experience and I highly recommend the place to anyone looking to try something a little different.", "author": "Jen D."}

Although at $40+ per person and way over in outer Richmond, you have much better options.\n\nAs for the small selection of real Egyptian food, I sampled both the kushari and mulukheya, and my disappointment was immense. The chef needs to understand that serving kushari without tomato sauce is closely analogous to mac 'n cheese with no cheese, and is therefor, unless specifically requested by the customer for some weird reason, nothing short of a crime. When I complained, I was given a tiny saucer of hot sauce, which is *not* the same thing. The mulukheya, although properly prepared and served, was mushy, bland, and absolutely without flavor, a far cry from anything resembling the classic delicacy. If you have never had either of these classic dishes, *please* do not let this be your first exposure.\n\nI will not even start on the overdone, kitsch, and period-ignorant decor. Stock photos of the pyramids on the back of the toilet seat? Seriously?\n\nOn the plus side, the falafel served at Al Masri is made the Egyptian way from fava rather than garbanzo beans, and although it would compare terribly to the sizzling, crispy stuff sold on every Cairo street corner, it may provide for an interesting experience as the only such falafel available (to my knowledge) in the Bay Area.", "author": "Abdel H."}

If you've been to La Mediteranee and the like, you're sort of familiar with many of the food options, like the appetizer assortment platter that 2 of us shared, but I assure you at Al-Masri the standards taste way fresher, lighter and just perfect.\n\nThe musa'ah, which we shared for an entree (layered eggplant with taro root fries, zucchini & tomato, was seriously one of the best things I have ever eaten.

With its questionable reviews and location,  it started off on shot in the dark adventure.  We found ourselves in Alexandria.  \n\nThe food tastes of exotic Nile deltas.  Mediterranean dishes that are familiar get transformed by a deft application of a strong cultural culinary tradition.  The samplers had me eagerly awaiting the tamarind main course and the baklava deserved its own hieroglyphic.  An Ibis gorging itself on cake and really strong coffee. \n\nThen,  there was the dancer.

Or at least in San Francisco.\n\nFortunately that meant attentive and friendly service. Plus some really good hummus made with tahina. Couldn't quit the toasted pita bread on the site.\n\nLoved the grilled fish with caramelized onions, pinenuts and garlic sauce too. Okra and rice pilaf on the side. Did not love the unexpected $4 surcharge for salmon.\n\nClose to four stars for the meal if the price hadn't been so high. Hummus was fair at $6. Seafood was expensive at $27.\n\nOf course you can't really put a price on an Egyptian theme that extends to the toilet seat lids.

Food was overpriced, bland, and just not that special, nothing worth remembering.  Not terrible, just OK -- but costing what something great should.  Service was very slow.  A couple elderly patrons had an argument with the service -- really the kind of dispute not needed, with neither side backing down, and ruined any ambiance.  Seemed rather run down for a place to charge what they do.  You need to have something special -- some select foods (that makes up for the bad) or a special setting.  This had neither.  Maybe coupons are the only way they bring in more costumers, but doubt most will come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-13", "description": "My husband treated me to a dinner at Al Masri through an offer he saw on Groupon.  We had previously strolled past this restaurant in the past during the day and had made a promise that we would eventually have dinner there.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised when I walked into Al Masri.  It was warmly lit and gave the feeling of a little nightclub in Cairo.  Although a few people have referred to them as kitsch, I really loved the little gold statuettes of goddesses, figurines of Horus and Set, papyrus scrolls on the walls, replica chairs found in King Tut's tomb, the street sign for Mohammed Ali Street, which is an entertainment district in Cairo.  Fun.  They appeared to have a full bar, although beer was the only alcohol offered on the menu.\n\nOur servers were low-key, but had gentle, soft-spoken personalities.  Astonishingly, we were the only other couple in the restaurant on a Friday night.  The only reason we could think of was because of how difficult it can be to find parking in the residential neighborhood.  Difficult, but not impossible.  That might be a deterrent.\n\nTheir menu is relatively small, but nice.  They offer three different dishes, each, of lamb, chicken and fish, respectively.  We ordered the appetizer plate for two, which I thought was so delicious, and it was artfully presented.  I had Cornish game hen stuffed with wheat and currents.  The flavor and moist texture of the chicken was amazing.  My husband had lamb kebabs and really enjoyed them.  Each plate was served with a garnished rice dish formed into the shape of a pyramid, along with a small bowl of okra stew.  All very good.\n\nThe belly dancer the evening we were at Al Masri was delightful and danced in the authentic, Classic Egyptian style, without veils or finger cymbals.  The music is classic Egyptian, as well.  I could have stayed there all night.  We plan to go again in the future.\n\nThe price seemed a little expensive.  I imagine it's been tough going for this restaurant, and they need to pay their bills.   Still, it could be a deterrent, even if you use Groupon.\n\nFinally, I just wanted to mention that the single-star reviewers of this restaurant seem to have an angry personal vendetta toward this establishment and I can't understand why.  It's a good thing I didn't read their reviews on Yelp before going to dinner.", "author": "Maryanne R."}

Highly childish!  I have to question why you're on groupon and have a completely empty restaurant at 7:30 on a Friday night? Il let others decide what this says about your business / food. \nThe reason it took 15 minutes to return to the kitchen was because the server (who I don't want to be negative about but you leave me no choice) didn't come NEAR ME once to ask was everything ok...until I had to finally beckon him over and show him I wasn't eating the food as it was Extremely cold & to be honest tasted disgusting!!! \nAs for your department store comments...this is so childish...the customer has the right to send back food if it is not to their standard or liking and especially if it is cold..nothing to do with buying a dress and changing ones mind. I think it's pathetic that a business owner tried to save a mesely $20 and didn't just refund the price of the fish. It would have saved all this negative publicity on Yelp and quite frankly I feel you've let yourself down even further with your response. \nI actually received a private Yelp compliment from another customer who witnessed this and they said your whole attitude towards me was awful and very unprofessional so no need for the lies saying you came out and asked politely was everything ok...your exact opening words were \"so I hear you think the fish is cold....bla bla bla\" \nYour customer service is disgusting especially as your meant to be the owner of this business.

I went with my girl on a last minute groupon deal for our anniversary. \n\nI give the folks there an \"A\" for effort. I found the server very attentive and the atmosphere was really nice. (I do love a place that wants you to enjoy the atmosphere.) The chef is the owner, and she seemed to really love what she does - which does account for something in this world. \n\nI would call the cuisine we had  \"Egyptian inspired\" but not authentic. I can't say I would recommend the buffet, as there was only about 4 items, and none were veggie (they will however make veggie for you if you ask.)   If you are a foodie - you will not be impressed with the buffet, so I would skip it (as sadly, we most likely will.) I might call Sunday's a \"fixed menu\" night instead of buffet. \n\nWe ate the buffet / veggie dishes and felt a little a queasy afterwards. I then ate the leftovers, and yet again felt queasy. (I suppose I am a candidate for the Darwin awards for having done that! ;)  $25/person is just too much to experience that again. It might be worth a try some other night, though. \n\nAll in all, it's a really nice atmosphere and the chef and the dancers all have a BUNCH of heart and seem really kind. They just need to work at the recipes a little, maybe bolster the buffet a bit more than rice, salad, and a few other items. \n\nTo anyone tempted into writing another cruel review about the dancers (the reviewers in question mostly my fellow MEN mind you): Get a life! You can review without being mean-spirited. I challenge YOU to get up in front of a bunch of strangers with your Buddah beer bellies and express yourself, instead of opening your mouth to spew your boring brain and bad attitude. If you are frustrated because you didn't get any, take it out in the Tenderloin, NOT on the dancers.

With a portion of said star's light shining on the authentically uber kitch decor.  The other four stars that died out light years ago are for the food, the service, the dancing, and the price. \nMy visit there was a test of endurance.  My friends had arrived around 6ish and had had to wait about 30 minutes for the buffet to be served.  By the time I got there, around 7ish, most of the food was gone, especially the vegetarian stuff.  So I served myself some lukewarm white rice, salad and moussaka, and asked if there would be more vegetarian dishes later. \nThe bartender said there \"it's coming\".  So, patiently, I waited.  \nAnd waited.\nAnd waited. \nI checked the buffet table a few times to see if the food was there yet.  Nope.  So I asked again.  Nope.  \"It's coming\".  That's what he said. \nBy then, the music was about to start and I didn't want to be walking in front of the musicians to keep checking the table, so I asked the waitress to tell me when the food was served so that I could go help myself without walking in fr...and I was about to finish my explanation but she waved me off and muttered ok.  Like whatevah. \nAbout 10 minutes later she brings me this gorgeous 9\" cake of moussaka that I hadn't ordered.  I inform her of this and she takes it back, looking pissed.  \nI'm going to interrupt myself here and write a little letter: \nDear Al Masri, \nBeing a vegetarian doesn't mean we eat copious amounts of vegetables and salad.  We need carbs, fats, proteins, a variety of flavors, and if it's late at night, a tomato-eggplant dish is a little hard on the digestion.  If the buffet says, \"All you can enjoy,\" your customers, even the vegetarians, who are paying the same as the omnivores (what you call \"carnivores\" on your website) to enjoy, also need substantial food.  Please take this into account when planning your menu. \nThank You, \nMe\nOk, I'm back.  So I go to the bartender and try to clarify.  He practically yells at me about having sent my order back - you know, the one that I DIDN'T ORDER because he had said that more buffet food was on its way?  My ears turned bright red.  Really dude?  Did you just raise your voice at me for asking what you meant when you said the buffet food was on its way?  \nBut yeah, about an hour after he'd first said the food was coming, around the time the pissy waitress was clearing our plates and the other lady was doling out single servings of baklava (very yummy, BTW), ONE vegetarian dish came out.  Finally, I ate more salad and a some spinach pastry. \nAt that time, the dancers also emerged.  The majority were wiggly and some jiggly and having great fun...at the customer's (literal) expense.  Student recital, with some notably more skilled dancers emerging around 9:30.  I sat there thinking, \"Did I really just drive out to the boonies of SF to wait for lukewarm food, get flack from pissy servers, and pay $25 to watch a bunch of slightly coordinated women (and one that might've been a man) trying to embrace their femininity by publicly shakin' it up?\"  \nWhy yes, I did.  \nI felt duped.  \nBut I smiled politely because those dancers are wonderful people and their feelings matter.  I don't want them to go home feeling like crap.\nOn that note, Al Masri customers are also, by and large, great people whose feelings matter, and who shouldn't go home feeling like crap.  \nSo another letter: \nDear Al Masri, \nIf you want to send your customers home happy so that they will write nice reviews and return to your restaurant, I suggest the following: \n1) Calculate how many reservations you have and make enough food well beforehand for buffet-sized portions.  Keep food hot by having a staff member close the lids of the food and keeping a little sterno underneath the serving dishes.  But keep the salad cold, and dry the lettuce well so that the salad stays crisp. Refill food dishes often until dancing begins and/or baklava is served, not after. Also, remember that omnivores also eat vegetarian food, but vegetarians don't eat meaty foods, so keep plenty of vegetable dishes on hand for everyone.\n2) Be courteous to the customers. That means listening to what they're asking for without interrupting/ignoring them, and NOT raising your voice at them.  Kinda basic, but apparently still needs mentioning.\n3) Screen dancers who want to perform there.  Less is more, as long as it's better.  We're ok with students as long as they're upper intermediate and above.  If you're going to have beginners, don't subject paying customers to the experiment.\n4) Keep those musicians!  And the experienced dancers!\nIf you can iron out those areas of opportunity, $25 might not be too much to charge.

Not bad, just not typical of my dining experiences in San Francisco.  For one thing, the place was nearly deserted on a Saturday night, which is atypical.  We were worried that they were going to give away our table because we arrived super late due to traffic.  But most of the tables were free when we got there.\n\nWe were seated right away, and the waitress explained the specials.  The mint tea they use for the iced tea is great!  We started with the hummus and the fried eggplant salad.  The eggplant salad was to die for and I will be back just to get more of that.  The hummus was just okay, I thought.  I like it a little smoother in consistency.  They serve it with fried pita, which is okay, I guess, but a little greasy.  One of the pieces they gave us was badly burnt, but once we pointed it out, they brought us some new pieces.  It still shouldn't have left the kitchen, though. \n\nFor mains, I ordered the cilantro chicken and BF got the tomato-garlic chicken. \n\nThe cilantro chicken was pretty good, if you like cilantro.  I would have liked some extra texture on the skin, but it was well-cooked, and fell off the bone.  It was served with rice pilaf that was a little overcooked, but had a good flavor, and a tomato-based okra dish that wasn't anything special.  BF liked his dish, but I thought it was a little bland.  \n\nFor dessert, they only had baklava, so we passed.  I like baklava, but can get that almost anywhere.\n\nWe received very attentive service, but at another table, they never received their starters, which is a little strange.  \n\nI really like the music and the cheesy Egyptian decor; you really do feel like you've gotten away to the Middle East.  The dancers are talented, if a little past their prime.  The highlight of the night was the overall atmosphere and the fried eggplant salad, which was really remarkable.  If not for that salad and the fun experience, I probably would not go back.", "author": "Shanthi G."}

On a whim I bought a Groupon for this place, excited to see a Middle Eastern spot near my hood.  My girlfriend and I walked in during the middle of a belly dance \"performance\" - it felt more like an outtake from \"Borat\" (at least that would have been entertaining!).  The servers were clueless and inattentive, and it took forever to flag one down to place an order.  We remained optimistic - after all, sometimes the atmosphere and service sucks but the food is redeeming.  Not so at Al-Masri!  The food was actually the worst part (and that's saying a lot).  Here's what we found:\n\n- The falafels were tasteless, dry hockey pucks.  And when I say tasteless, I mean, they didn't even put salt in it.  And I hate overly salty food.\n\n- The salads were also tasteless and drenched in oil... are you getting the theme here?  I begrudgingly asked for salt and pepper (didn't help much).\n\n- Moussaka was... you guessed it... tasteless and drenched in oil!  It was clearly made from tomato paste out of a can.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-17", "description": "Ok food, tacky decor (like someone was trying to decorate a room Egyptian style from a dollar store), ok service (though the manager had a bit of a 'tude), & the dancers were alright.\n\nWe had a reservation but when we walked in, there was no checking the book, just a \"help yourself, sit down anywhere!\". Although the restaurant never filled up, I really don't like it when we take the time to make a reservation but it just doesn't mean a thing when we walk in. \n\nOn the Sunday night buffet:\nNote - They have a really awkward set up. None of the lids have a little hole for where the serving spoon can go. So you either put the serving spoon entirely in the container, where (as it's all metal without any plastic handle) it gets really hot & ends up falling entirely in the food, or you put it awkward on the table (there was no spoon rest). Also several of the dishes were one in front of the other under a single lid - you can open the front half of the lid, but then you awkwardly reach under the back half to get the second dish. I felt especially bad as my friend is pescetarian & I was afraid of accidentally dropping something from a meat dish onto a veggie or seafood dish! This was definitely not a veggie-friendly setup.\nVeggie plate - HOWEVER (continuing from above) when my friend asked about veggie options, the chef immediately said she should've mentioned this (she had, on the phone). The chef said she meant when my friend came in (a little bit of attitude there). Pretty soon a veggie platter came out - it was really delicious! A plate with a giant slice of eggplant topped with tomato sauce - underneath was sweet potato, peppers, & other veggies. This was surrounded by rice & crispy fried onions. \nRice - pretty good, with pieces of vermicelli noodles. Rice grains not very sticky.\nShrimp - had a very strange, bitter taste. It was overcooked to the point that it was just mushy, no crunch at all. \nFish - also overcooked (I recognize the texture - likely frozen & thawed), Plus it was sitting in a lot of water & became completely soaked through & mushy.\nChicken - There were legs with a green pest-like sauce & breasts with different sauce. While the meat was very tender & moist, it was all very flavorless. \nMussels - decent but like the shrimp had a slightly bitter aftertaste. Didn't exactly taste fresh, also likely thawed. \nBeef/eggplant - I LOVED this dish! It was absolutely delicious. Soft eggplant in a tangy tomato sauce & ground beef for added texture. Wonderful.\nLentils - good texture, but lacking in flavor.\nPhyllo dough/beef - the phyllo was little dry & crispy so didn't stick together well in squares & didn't cut apart easily once on your plate. The container with this dish became a big mess of random phyllo & ground beef. \nDessert - bread soaked in (I think) rose water with pistachio crumbles on top. Good flavors, but the bread was pretty hard & dry, even though it was soaked through! It seemed soaked more in something oily or greasy. I've had a homemade version of this & know that the bread can have a much softer & cake-like texture. This was like stale corn bread. \n\nOn the service:\nBesides the slight attitude from the chef above, we also got a bit of a 'tude from the manager. We'd gotten a Groupon that expired back in June - I'd called in June trying to reserve a spot before it expired & when I mentioned that, the manager basically waved it aside & said that there were so many people trying to use the Groupon that they were going to ignore the expiration date. Great! I double checked by asking - so I can use the Groupon after it expires? Yes, was the solid answer. Ok, so it took us a good 6 months to use the Groupon, but they said there was no expiration date. Once there, we mentioned the Groupon, & the manager sat down with me & explained that there's apparently some sort of \"code phrase\" she uses when she allows customers to use Groupons after they expire. Otherwise, apparently, how would she know whether I actually called the restaurant & talked to her? What if I called this other restaurant that has a Groupon & sounds really similar to Al-Masri? Of course, not that she doubts my word or anything, but she's managing a restaurant in a struggling economy & barely staying open. Etc, etc, etc. She was just a little pushy & rude - maybe when I talked to her in June she just meant we'd be able to use the original purchase amount but not the discount after the expiration, but that was NOT clear to me at all. She really could have been much nicer about it.\n\nOn the dancers:\nNot exactly professional dancers like I imagined. These women were all students (though many who'd been studying for 10, 20 years) of this one teacher, likely doing this as a side hobby outside of their full-time jobs. While I give them (many of them much older!) TOTAL props for being confident & sexy at any age & having beautiful hand made dresses, it was kind of like watching a recital.

I was hesitant to eat here but a friend was belly-dancing that night and so joined the party of pals who were going to cheer her on.\n\nFirst of all, the service was annoying. The older waitress was irritated at such a big party (um...shouldn't she have been grateful that there were so many customers?) and was flustered and couldn't seem to get anything right. Several people in our party had to wait for nearly 20 minutes for a drink. Not mixed cocktails, but beer and wine. \n\nAlso, a couple of people in our party were told to wait outside for nearly half an hour to be seated even though there were more than two spots at our table. Then they waited half an hour for their food. \n\nThe food was mediocre. The hummus was okay. The falafel-y things were okay. The chicken was okay, and the rice was bland. The wine was pretty bad. Overpriced for what I had.\n\nThe decor was definitely Egyptian themed - kind of like one of those love motels with theme rooms - even the toilet seats had Egyptian motifs! It was fun, verging on a little tacky, but then I'm more about the less-is-more decorating esthetic. \n\nHOWEVER, I enjoyed the belly-dancing. Not just because my pal was dancing, but it's kind of fun to watch. If you don't like belly-dancing, loud music, or just general revelry, this is *not* the place for you (it kind of reminds me of Greek themed restaurants where everyone gets drunk and smashes plates on the floors and dance in circles). \n\nNo doubt the owner will probably post a counter-review - remember, it is my First Amendment right to voice an opinion, by the way - but try it if you are interested...it definitely appeals to some people and not to others.

We've never had Egyptian food before, so this gave us an opportunity to try it, at an affordable price.  \n\nColorful and fun - We walked into the place and was greeted by cheeky Egyptian decorations, paint, furniture, and lighting.  The music was loud enough for the belly dancer to boogie to.  We were seated quickly, given our water, flatbread and olive oil.  Everything was smooth sailing.  People started to fill-up the place which was good because it felt awkward with the dancer only dancing for 6 people.  \n\nWait was long - Our server apologized for the wait, even saying they were unusually slammed for a Thursday night.

Girlfriend got the salmon kabobs with   rice pilaf and side of okra and tomatoes.  I got the chicken kabobs with of rice pilaf and side of taro root and swiss chard.

After we demolished our food, I was anxious to get our check and go home since our dinner took longer than I had anticipated.\n\n18% tip  - Uh oh.  Even though the server was pleasant, the dancer was stellar and the food was great, we still had to wait.  I am a believer in a minimum of 15% tips, before voucher price.

So the fact that we were obliged to tip high on such slow service didn't jive well with me.  I paid the tip, and promptly left.  Normally I would say something but it was a long day and I just wanted to go home.\n\nSuggestion - talk to the server or owner if you have issues.

Of course, Al Masri will be one of my first reviews since I had an unforgettable dining experience here.\n\nCame here with a party of 6 sometime back in April 2012.  We had a voucher and were so excited to try a different cuisine.  We were seated immediately when we arrived.  Place was dark, cozy, and calm with a touch of \"Aladdin\" feel.   At that time, the place was half-filled.  Hostess/server (same person, and one and only) was nice.  With a big group, we decided to do family style and ordered many dishes:\n\n2 orders of Maza for 2 (appetizer)\nBaba Ghannuug (eggplant appetizer)\nRiasch Mashwiya (rack of lamb)\nMusa-ah (Vegetarian eggplant dish)\nSamak Mashwi (grilled fish)\n\nLong story short, the food took f-o-r-e-v-e-r to come.  Each dish was served one at a time with more than 20 minutes apart.  When the food came, I literally just had a bite of each dish because I wasn't fond of the taste.  Maybe it was the spice that made the dish so inedible.  Again, this is my first time trying Egyptian food, I wasn't sure what to expect.  On top of the slow service, they had a student belly dancer perform for about 10 minutes and it wasn't the most fun and entertaining to watch. They stopped all servicing during the performance (which makes sense), BUT our dinner was 2-3 hours long - I felt miserable....and drained.", "author": "sandy h."}

I went here with a few friends for the usual reason cited in other reviews - someone had bought a Groupon which was expiring so we figured we should use it. The hummus was dry and almost had a stale flavor. The veggie special was terrible (mousaka and falafel - the only thing common with other mousaka I have had is that this had eggplant and some kind of tomato sauce). It seemed that the chicken entrees in the buffet were OK per my friends who tried that.  It didn't matter that the place was empty and we were seated right away - the food is really bad (at least for Sunday buffet). We asked whether the vegetarians could order from the full menu since the buffet had nothing for them, but were told there was only 1 thing they could order (the above-mentioned mousaka + falafel) \"to make it easier for the chef\".\n\nI came home hungry and still paid $25 per person + tax + tip.

I really hate writing bad reviews... but this place honestly deserves one.\n\nCame here for my Aunt's 50th Birthday and thought we would have a night of celebration, laughter, good food, entertainment and memories.  We did make memories... ones that we  would like to not remember.  \n\nThe ambiance of the place was nice, and the Egyptian decor added a nice touch to the theme.. but that was probably the only thing likable. We had a party of 10 so most of our party sat at a long table, while a couple of us sat at a neighboring one next to the main table.  Immediately after being seated we were given pita and hummus for appetizers. They actually didn't give us enough for our entire party, and getting some more just seemed to take forever. \n\nOur party opted for their $25 dinner which included the appetizer, our buffet dinner, entertainment and dessert.\n\nDinner was supposed to be served up at 6pm, but it was a little late... and totally not worth waiting for.  When dinner was finally served, only about half the restaurant was able get their food while the rest waited for the buffet to be refilled.  My cousin, who had originally set up the reservation did some research, checked the menu online and even confirmed with one of the ladies that worked at the restaurant that we would have a pretty vast array of foods to choose from.  If you take a look at their menu, they have so many dishes that sound wonderful... so why were we ONLY served, Chicken, rice, salad and fish for the buffet?  4 items!  A four item buffet... is that even a buffet? unheard of.  I know we should have taken one look at the buffet and made a U-turn to leave... but after waiting for what seemed an hour to eat, the party was starving and we knew it would be difficult to get a reservation elsewhere for a party as big as ours.  \n\nNext was the entertainment.  Entertaining is the wrong word to describe what we witnessed.  I would post pix up of our belly dancers, but that would just be mean.  I don't even have the heart to describe what they considered entertainment.  I'll just put it this way... it was almost impossible to keep the meager buffet dinner down.  When you hear belly dancers, you imagine (Google images - 'belly dancers'). What we saw was more of a freak show.  More than watching our entertainment for the night, I found the expressions held on other customers' faces a lot more amusing. \n\nThe party wasn't thrilled with the food or the entertainment and decided to hit the road before the show was even over. I felt bad that my aunt had hopes to have an enjoyable 50th birthday, but instead brought in the year at this place. \n\nI say, save your $25 + tip & tax and go elsewhere... ANYWHERE but here. \n\nI also must add, this place needs some pest control. The abundance of insects and moths flying around the entrance is a hazard.", "author": "Shamina K."}

I couldn't resist as I love Egyptian themes and wanted to try the food. When we got out there (and it's WAY out there, unless you live out there but we live in the Mission), the facade was cute and colorful with, you know, Anubis and some other god painted on the doors. We walk in and it's loud and there's a belly dancer performing for about 6 people. That's great! Didn't expect that. My boyfriend wasn't so keen on putting the dollar in her \"bra-strap\", however. \nThe decor was pretty cool, but the best was the ancient egyptian hieroglyphed toilet seat! They have every single Egyptian tschotchke ever made in that restaurant. They even have a reproduction of Tut's chair. The staff was a sight. What an interesting bunch. Straight out of a movie. \nAnyway, the waitress tells us first thing \"We have a buffet tonight.\" and I say, \"Well, we're vegan.\" and she says \"Oh.\" and goes to get menus. She comes back and says \"We do have some salad in the buffet....\" and we say we'll consider. We decide on two $16  items on the menu and receive pita with hummous. The food comes and they are both large dishes. We thought they were alright, but didn't have much spice. Even the hummous was a little bland. The eggplant seemed like it just had tomato sauce and salt and the pasta, rice, lentil dish was interesting but lacked a little oomph as well, spice-wise. We asked for olives because olives rock this kind of food. \nSo we get the check and see that we were charged $24 each instead of the $16 each and I ask why. The waitress tells me THEN that it's \"BUFFET NIGHT\" and it's a fixed price of $24 each. Well, we didn't know that, especially by how she presented the buffet to us in the beginning. So the owner, I guess, showed up and we had to argue with her about the bill which TOTALLY ruined the whole thing. I would have rated this restaurant 3 stars and deemed it worthy to go if I wanted somewhere unusual to go with a small group of friends, for a birthday or something ONLY if someone had a car! But we will never go there again because the owner wouldn't give us the original price without ARGUING about it and then adding on the pita, hummous (which we didn't ask for) and the olives. The menu with the $16 menu items is easily changed for the special \"buffet night\" as it's only a paper menu. Give people the buffet menu on Sundays and you won't have this problem! I see that others have complained about the expensive buffet night. Who charges $24 for a BUFFET anyway?! It was a long camel ride, my friends, and we don't like the old \"bait and switch\" approach to ordering and paying.  They can keep their knick knacks and belly dancers. We are used to the BEST food, so cheap, friendly, free pita, olives, side dishes, etc right when you sit down at Old Jerusalem in our own hood, which I'll ululate, I mean Yelp next. \nI can't wait to read the LONG reply that Sausan will surely post refuting everything!", "author": "Josie L."}

Not to mention how incredibly slow and dishonest our waitress was. The husband and I were there with 2 other couples and we were the the only people in the entire place. Everything seemed to be going ok during the actual dinner itself. The belly dancer even performed twice while we there. Probably because we were there a total of 2.5 hours, that's how slow service was. It was when the checks finally came that things started to go awry. First, I noticed that they initially charged us  the full $20 for our appetizer (all 3 couples wanted the same sampler appetizer; it was $20 for 2 people, but only an extra $5 for every extra person...6 people = $40). I looked at the other couples' checks and they did the same thing on their checks too. However, we noticed that the $20 appetizers were eventually scratched out and each couple was charged $13.33 (total of $40) for the appetizers. Okay, thanks for correcting the mistake, but why did you guys try to cheat us in the first place? Secondly, we noticed that we were all charged for dessert when no one ordered dessert. The waitress had come out 15 minutes prior with a tray of tiny little cakes and said, \"Here's some dessert for you all! Who'd like some?\" Thinking it was free, some of us took a plate. So when we got the bill, imagine our surprise and disgust when we see that we are charged $4 per dessert. And these things were tiny. About 1 inch wide, 2 inches long, 0.5 inch thick and cold. How tacky is that to offer food and not tell you that it's not free? The final straw was that it took half an hour for our already very slow waitress  to recalculate our 3 bills and all she had to do was take away the dessert charges. I don't know how the other couples feel since we were all in such a hurry to get home after spending so much time there, but the husband and I will not be returning.", "author": "Cristianne K."}

If you were forced to pay a 20% tip \"because it's in the fine print\", contact the company (Groupon included).\n\nI would need to be paid to go back to Al Masri.\n\nAll told, it took over 90 minutes to go in and out, which might not seem bad, except that the restaurant was deserted and my dining partner and I had studied the menu online and knew exactly what we wanted. Thankfully I didn't have time-sensitive plans that night, but really I have better things to do with my time than sit in a restaurant full of decor so tacky I thought I was in the Luxor casino.\n\nOur time was divided as follows:\n15 minutes-waiting for menus\n15 minutes-waiting for our order to be taken\n25 minutes-waiting for food\n15 minutes-eating and watching belly dancing\n10 minutes-waiting for the bill\n10 minutes-waiting for our food to be boxed\n\nFor those of you keeping track at home, 16% of our time was spent doing something that was NOT waiting. And 84% of our time was spent waiting for various things.\n\nAt the start, there were three other tables occupied. I didn't realize it at first, but each of those tables had been finished for a while, and was simply waiting on the bill. In each of those cases, the bill had to be recalculated, I'm assuming because of mathematical difficulties. By the time I got my water and order taken, one other table was occupied. Only one employee was waiting on customers, which shouldn't have been a problem but somehow was.\n\nThe food itself was fine. Unimpressive, but fine. My impression is that Egyptian food is identical to Greek and other Middle Eastern foods. It may not be, but based on the menu and my order, I can only assume this is the case. The food was a bit pricey, especially considering the outrageously slow service.\n\nThe belly dancing was fine, although the creepy old guys at the next table sneaking leering glances while their wives pretended not to notice was a bit off-putting.\n\nMy main problem came with the bill. My AmazonLocal/LivingSocial certificate was counted correctly, but a 20% tip was added. I tend to tip generously, but not when service is that catastrophically slow. As suggested by every deal website ever, I tip based on the full amount, not just the excess beyond the certificate.\n\nThankfully I saw other folks' Yelp! reviews and knew this might be coming. I asked the server, and she mumbled something about being part of the coupon. I asked for clarification, as I regularly use deal certificates, and nowhere in them or the menu was anything about a mandatory tip mentioned. She then claimed it was part of the fine print. During my 90 minutes at the restaurant, I had plenty of time to read and re-read this particular certificate. Nowhere on AmazonLocal, or LivingSocial, or the certificate itself, did it say anything of the sort. Rather than cause a scene, I paid the amount stated. I verified later, and as evidenced by the refund and investigation by both companies, the woman lied to me.\n\nEven more absurdly, the woman said that the mandatory tip was necessary because the workers make minimum wage. That, I should point out, is not my fault, but management's. I assume that she must be management, as I can't imagine such a slow, surly server being any type of employee, at least not for long. Certainly food service employees depend upon tips, and I tend to tip generously. But lying to my face and extorting additional money is not the way to go. If the restaurant doesn't want to abide by deal sites' certificates, they probably shouldn't sign up for them.", "author": "David K."}

But surprisingly we saw on the other tables that they actually pour a full glass (note that the glass is not large either).  Btw, their house wine is Yellowtail.\nOur two entrees arrived lukewarm.  \n(1) $22 Gambari Mashwi - Grilled prawns with a butter-garlic sauce, with 'Ul 'As - Taro Root, Swiss chard - both the prawns and side was good with a pyramid shaped pile of rice pilaf.\n(2) $23 Lahma Mahshiya - Stuffed tenderloin with cheese and parsley, and topped\nwith a garlic, onion, nutmeg, lemon sauce, with Mulu'khia - Jute plant - Do not order this entree.  The presentation was basically beef balls with cheese in the middle and too much cheese.  The side of Jute plant tasted like super slimy spinach.  It also came with with a pyramid shaped pile of rice pilaf.\n\nCleanliness:\nThe table had a dark decorative table cloth, but it was had bread crumbs and little pieces of rice here and there.  One of the forks had a piece of veggie stuck on it.  Maybe because the place is dark and they can't see this too well?  Nevertheless not acceptable.  Bathrooms upstairs were decorated very nicely and clean.\n\nEntertainment.\nI guess every evening they have dancers come out to perform.  For this evening, a dancer came out to dance in the middle of restaurant for about 10minutes or so and in the process corralled a couple of customers to go up.  What cheapen the entire experience for us was that towards the end she was making her way around the table for tips!!  That means you're not better than a stripper.  I felt for a moment I was at a strip joint.  Very tasteless.  Oh btw, when they give you the bill, there another little envelope soliciting tips for the dancer again.  \n\nOther Notes:\n1) Towards the end of the meal, the restaurant was just covered with smoke.  I don't know what the kitchen was cooking up or whether their ventilation system suddenly broke down.\n2) Don't think it is worth it to celebrate a birthday here because of the hefty per head cake fee.  Website says $2.50 per head.  The menu says $1.50 per head.", "author": "Sandra L."}

Finally, when she did grace us with her presence, she was already out of breathe. Mind you, the restaurant is only about 4 x 4. She was a sweet lady, but couldn't even remember to bring us waters for another 15 minutes. \n\nEven with the rocky start, we were still optimistic having seen the menu and being entertained by the belly dancer. Our optimism soon died down when the starvation set in, 40 minutes later, our appetizer still was not ready.\n\nIt was like seeing a mirage in the desert when our food finally arrived. \nMind you, I am 100% Egyptian and been to hundreds of Arabic restaurants all around the world, and this is by far the WORST one.   \n\nThe hummus was atrocious, I would have been better off going to safeway because the quality and flavor would have been far superior  and a hell of a lot faster. The pita was less than appetizing - probably store bought.\n\n30 minutes later, and a nap, Our main course finally arrived. I had the Kufta which seemed like it was seasoned with water.

The vegetable that came with the dish was out of a can and the rice pilaf tasted like rice-a-roni. \n\nThis was quite a disappointment being that me and my girlfriend were very excited to finally find an Egyptian restaurant in the bay area.

My $20 lamb kabob plate came out 1 hour and 40 minutes later, but it was COLD, OVER COOKED, and DRY, and the accompanying rice was equally cold and the pickles tasted awful.

The waitress doubled as the belly dancer and she was not only out of shape (which in itself could be fine), but her moves were repetitious and mundane.  The service was HORRIBLE...the waiter increased my total check by $20 instead of decreasing it by that amount!  When I called him on it, he said he was having a very bad day and that he doesn't care.  The waiter did not even offer so little as an apology.\n\nMy date and I missed our movie and we left hungry.  I also noticed other people complaining about the food and sending their dishes back.  I overheard dishes being overcooked or too cold, and one patron even got in a fight with another waiter.  \n\nDO NOT EAT HERE.  It's OVERPRICED and the food, service and belly dancing is a TOTAL JOKE.  It's an ABSOLUTE EMBARRASSMENT.  Not sure how the the YELP reviews here could lean so favorably to this joke.

This very drink is one of the things that impressed me about the place. \n\nIf I remember correctly, it is called zabib (much different from Hindi zabib!) and it's a proprietary drink-- the owner's family makes in back in Egypt. Sit down and talk to the guy for a minute... he's friendly and he's a fountain of information. He'll be glad to tell you anything you'd like to know. He even offered to hook me up with a small distribution order of this liquor (which is stronger than Sambuca AND higher proof, by the way). What a guy!\n\nP.S. the Greeks make a version of this, too (ouzo!). Egypt is part of the Mediterranean, too...\n\nAlso, you might find this to be a detail, but I will stand by the superiority of Egyptian feta to Greek feta any day. I was really quite amazed. The relish platter also included tomatoes, fresh olives, hummus (made with fava beans instead of garbanzo) and Egyptian baba ganoush (it's smoked-- delicious!). \n\nI would have been impressed with that alone, but then came the Egyptian falafel, chicken kebab, lamb and duck. Maybe this was the liquor talking, but I could swear we had an amazing grilled shrimp kebab, too. \n\nI have not had a meal even close to this kick-ass since visiting this restaurant. OK, maybe close, but this was one of the single greatest dining experiences of my life. Everything was juicy and cooked to perfection. (UPDATE -- I have now had better, but that place had a Michelin star, to be fair.)\n\nThe selection of signature cocktails played a wide range, and the three fruit-based ones I tried were all incredible, too. Balanced, inventive, not too cloying. I believe the Orange Blossom was my favorite.\n\nWe were also lucky enough to witness the dancer.\n\nAnd yes, the decor is a bit cheezy, but the place itself makes up for that. I love the layout... the upstairs lounge on the balcony is a nice touch, as is the tall ceiling that is open all the way to the floor seating. It made for a nice show, and a relaxing time afterward. The plush couches and mirrored walls make the upstairs feel a bit like you've stumbled into a club lounge.\n\nThe only thing I can't speak about is the bill. I was here on an employee appreciation trip (best evar!), so I didn't have to pay. However, I was around when my boss got the bill... and despite getting some food on the house, I believe it was about $2500 for a party of 23 people. Granted, we did it up like CRAZY. And we're a pretty rowdy crew, so the tab included a TON of drinks. I think we may have gotten a full bottle of that anisette, too.\n\nAnyhow, this is not the palce to go for cheap eats.

It's yummy and it wasn't that expensive for a real restaurant and not a falafel cart (see above American Med comment).  I suppose it all depends what you are used to, it's not a $5 bowl of pho, but if you've never had Egyptian it's worth a visit.\n\nThe waiter was very attentive to our table (alright so we were the only people in the restaurant).  The owner was friendly, but not overbearing considering there weren't other customers.  The waiter asked us if we were interested in the bellydance show that they provide every night Thurs-Sun I think he said.  We were and the dancer was adorable.  Again, if you are expecting a strip show, you will be disappointed.  These are belly dancers, not strippers, so don't complain if they don't look like whores.  Fayrouz should off some good moves and read the music well.  Speaking of music, the whole time there was great Arab music, including Hakim- who I'm a huge fan of.\n\nThe decorations were so perfectly Egyptian, a little tacky, but that's what makes it authentic! Blue and gold everywhere, not classy for an American, but we both loved it.", "author": "Cara J."}

Why would it matter, because it was not hopping with people. The food was decent, but the music played during the belly dancer's routine was way too loud! and again it was not busy in there so I would have rather liked to eat the food with some music at a reasonable level of volume. They definitely tried to be nice, so I am sure there seems to be some communication confusion going on about the repeated asking of the reservations. It was not malicious, just really annoying! Room for improvement for sure. Overall it did have an advantage for not being so busy - it was kind of relaxing to be in a place that felt a little more laid back, but please turn the volume down on the music- we are not deaf :)", "author": "Clementine O."}

I love the decor, the Egyptian art, and the owner, Sausan, has a lifelong commitment to promoting Egyptian dance and culture. Our event had a dinner buffet, so I was able to sample several dishes. Their servers did a good job of making sure everyone had what they needed.\n\nThe food was very tasty and delicious, especially the ground lamb kufta. I could have crammed the entire tray into my pockets to take home. The chicken was equally tender and tasty. The spices were very fresh and the food was not over-salted. Just right! There was plenty to go around, too. Their honey cake was delicious.\n\nVery unique place, a labor of love I'd say. It's amazing that it's stayed open as long as it has, when so many other Middle Eastern restaurants are  take-out kebab places with no ambiance. There are very few places now that really promote high-quality Egyptian bellydance as an art form, and showcase it in a family-friendly setting that is respectful to the dancer and the audience alike.", "author": "Red R."}

The coowner/chef Hatem welcomed us with open arms and chatted us up with info on the restaurant and the dancers and all things under the sun.  He's a strong promoter for the restaurant and the dancers, but can you blame him?  He's absolutely right!\n\nWe had the Tamiya (delicious, nutty, great texture), hummus (always yummy), and garlic yogurt (this was outstanding) for appetizers.  We pretty much almost filled ourselves silly with just the starters.  My friend had the swordfish (I had a taste but now I have to go back so I can get my own, it was so yummy) and I had the feta-stuffed filet mignon on a bed of, I think, mashed tarot root which was all that was tender and scrumptious.\n\nRyan provided great service and made the best pomegranate martini and key lime martinis!  The zabeeb was incredibly strong but had a fantastic flavor.\n\nThe restaurant's exterior isn't the only great looking part either.  The interior decor is all very Egyptian and the murals on the walls are well done.  Very clean and comfortable.  \n\nWe went on a Thursday so there were no performances but we'll be sure to go again when there will be.  For that crass reviewer that waved around $1 bills, the ladies give a performance, not a crude lap dance.

My friends and I waited for two hours before we got our food, from the time we put our name on the list to be seated to the time the food arrived. I could see they were busy, but not to the point where it merited that long of a wait. And no apologies or anything. Inexcusable. Once we did get service, our waitress was completely clueless about the menu. Given that it was my first time at an Egyptian restaurant, I had questions about the dishes on the menu and she couldn't answer even the basic ones. Also, if you keep a halal diet, don't trust this place. The menu indicates that some of their items are made with halal meat while others aren't. But when I asked the waitress to confirm, she couldn't verify and flip-flopped on her answer even. The food itself wasn't bad but nothing to rave about. Finally, they had a belly dancer and entertainment show, which was lame and too close to our table to enjoy. I've seen much, much better. The whole experience was pathetic and leaving with each person having paid $50 (no alcohol AND we used a Groupon deal -_-) further left a sour taste in our mouths.

This woman must have been the owner or the owner's family, I cannot think of any other reason she could possibly keep her job. \n\nWe walked in at 7:45 on Sunday night; there were THREE diners there at one table. Do you have a reservation? WTF!?!? Half of the restaurant was reserved for the \"15 dancers\". She magically found room for us in to one of the 12 empty tables. \n\nHer attitude the whole time was \"Sigh-I must wait on you\". I will get my tip, so I do not have to provide good service. She was borderline rude, and freaking clueless, and slow. There was a woman who kept our water glasses full, and a very tall kind gentleman who helped our waitress, as well. \n\nThe food was OK; the baba ghannug was NOT the best I have had, but smoky.  My date's Fuul Midimas was SCALDING hot, after 10 minutes of cooling and much stirring, still uncomfortably hot, it was OK, but NOT worth the interminable wait to be able to eat it. The owner says it comes off the stove at that temperature, I doubt it highly, it came out of the MICROWAVE at that temperature, and the cook screwed up. I sincerely doubt the Department of Public Health demands it be served hot enough to burn your mouth. My Gambari Mashwi was good, a dozen prawns and a mountain of mushy rice, and a spicy sweet pea dish for $22.00. \n\nThe dancers were good, had nice stage presence, all two of them. \n\nThe bill finally came after asking not one, not two, but THREE times. During the 23 minute wait for the check the party of three left, one diner was being served dinner, and three dancers-drinkers in the whole place. Not the brightest time to make a diner wait, with the place virtually empty, and a staff of three servers. I always tip generously; I usually get good or excellent service. This time I was willing to leave only 10-15%, I wanted to send a message. She actually added the tip for herself!! On the menu it says 18% will be added to parties of 5, another place it says parties of 6!! However were a party of TWO! She added it in, and ran it on the credit card without my consent. I usually leave CASH, which most servers prefer, but I understand why she added it without our consent, she knew she ignored us, and given super-sub par service!  We were not about to contest it, we did not want to deal with her anymore - get me out of here! Never again! Now we understand why the place was empty.

I was jealous that I didn't order it, but at least my boyfriend shared his.  Also the rice and vegetables were rich in spices.  And try a honey cake with  black tea for dessert.  \n\nPeople in tune with their happiness will love this place.  We had the misfortune of sitting next to a miserable couple who were up complaining about slow service when they weren't texting.  \n\nThe love and commitment the owner and staff put in comes out in the food and atmosphere.", "author": "Marria E."}

My Client owns many restaurants in California but asked me to meet him and his two Partners for dinner. We have known each other for years and had met while traveling in Europe. We both enjoy all types of different foods from around the world and he felt that the Al-Masri Egyptian Restaurant would be the perfect spot. For me going out to eat is an escape from the stress of having a business and a growing family. Our culture here in the United States has programmed us that we are supposed to eat fast and be out in an hour. That is to stressful and I do not like one course right after another. In the case of Al Masri you also have the entertainment to relax and enjoy. I have traveled around the world twice and traditional food that would be served in ones home is always my favorite. Al Masri delivered on all of my needs and more. We were seated and immediately I felt like I was in Egypt and all of the stress in my head was gone. We talked for a few minutes and our starters arrived. The  Imported Egyptian beef pastrami was amazing. The Yogurt cheese and garlic served with sliced cucumber was a great combination that was refreshing but not overpowering. Our last item the Egyptian fried \"felafel\" that was such an unique item we all enjoyed. I ordered my favorite food, the Grilled rack of lamb with a butter-garlic sauce. The temperature was perfect.  In the big box chain steak houses I have paid twice what Al Masri charged and did not have the distinct flavor profile and tenderness. Some people want the cookie cutter chain restaurant feel and frozen food experience. If your looking for an authentic Egyptian traditional look and feel without the cost of flying half way around the world you can find it at Al Masri. Great food, great value and a chance to leave the fast pace world we live in for a few hours. This is now a must have experience whenever I am in town.", "author": "Kevin V."}

I went with 4 because I do not want people to be put off by this restaurant.  I read the reviews on yelp and worried about going here to use my voucher ($20 for $40 worth of food).  I wanted to share our experience to put others at ease.  Of course every night is different, but we had a nice experience.  To be honest, the service is a tad slow, but I noticed the server tell each table, \"I will be right with you\" or \"thank you for waiting\".  It was as if they read the reviews, and were conscious of folks feeling service was slow.  The appetizers were 3 stars, we loved the babganoush, but preferred not to have deep fried pita for dipping, this is a personal preference only.  We both ordered different fish dishes, with the sole.  They were both cooked perfectly.  The rice and okra that came with it was lovely.  We did not have dessert so cannot comment on that.  If you are in the area, and want to try here, do so, you may really enjoy it!  also, when the check came, the server went over the bill with me and explained everything clearly.  Gratuity was NOT added, and we tipped accordingly (20% on the original price before voucher).  Yes, there was a tip envelope included for the belly dancer, but we didn't find that offensive, the lady is trying to make a living like the rest of us.", "author": "Lauraine E."}

Rack of lamb seasoned in garlic and butter was perfection; salads and huge appetizer sampler platter we shared was scrumptious.   Even the falafel was special, nice and fluffy inside and seasoned just right.  There are also lots of seafood and vegetarian choices as well and Chef Sausan prepares every single one with the same attention to detail and presentation.

I was truly impressed by the whole experience. You know like when you go to a restaurant and find yourself daydreaming about it the next day at work? This restaurant has that effect on you.\r\nI came with my younger sis and since I don't really see the point of owning a car in the city, we took muni (a one hour trip, by the way). We stepped outside and were met by some fierce fog, and the moment we set foot in the restaurant it was like we were transported to another world. I was so busy admiring the lanterns which are amazing by the way, and the art that I didn't even bother looking at the menu. You just start to feel as if maybe you are in Egypt.\r\nBetween the two of us we ordered:\r\n-Soup of the day, perfect for warming up. The soup was a combination of watercress, potatoes, and lime. Really good!\r\n-basterma, a cured spicy beef\r\n-salatet betingen, fried eggplant over a salad of cilantro. Also very good.\r\nentrees (I recommend either one): \r\nkufta mashwiya: lamb patties served with sauce and rice\r\nlahma mashiya: filet mignon stuffed with feta cheese & served w/rice\r\nSo I went crazy and ordered two drinks, one that was a mix of henessy and creme de cacao, and fresh nutmeg, and the other was an anise-flavored liquor (wow!! that perked me up). We also had this great dessert I forget the name, it was kind of like a custard with orange blossom water. The food overall was great. So the damage with 3 appetizers, 2 entrees, 3 cocktails, and two desserts came to about $60 per person. I recommend going with a group of four or more since the prix fixed is about $40 pp.\r\nThe service was really great, casual, and unpretentious. But I have to say the highlights were the live Egyptian jazz band (a special event for the night) and Samar the Egyptian dancer.  I lack the right words to describe it, but her dancing was amazing.\r\nI also loved the bathroom, it was really something special. More art, gold-colored trim, and the mirrors were generously sized. Oh and on a table you will find a platter with a selection of lotions, and scents.\r\nThe restaurant has an intoxicating effect on you that just kind of lingers long after your visit. This is the kind of place you go to relax and get lost. If you come here and expect the food to be served within minutes, then this isn't your type of restaurant. Everything here is slower paced, so you really get to unwind and enjoy.", "author": "X marks the spot .."}

As for the food, the yogurt appetizer was very tasty as was our bottle of wine ($8 bottle that cost us $32.) We also received a gift from the kitchen for being the first patrons in the restaurant which was some tasty falafel. Very tasty! However, the entrees were rather expensive and when we received the food all the portions were rather small. One of the members of my party asked for the meat to be cooked rare and when it arrived it was well done, a $23 piece of beef not cooked correctly. And as if that wasnt discouraging enough I ordered lamb which I was rather excited about but it turned out to be super chewy. A total bummer. I also got the chicken tenders which were delightful, and melted in my mouth.\n\nThe belly dancing was delightful!

Daniel came over to the table a few minutes later with a homemade non-alcoholic wine type drink for sober roomie and we were much impressed. I ordered the stuffed cornish game hen, stuffed with rice raisins onions and pine nuts. A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. And just when we looked at each other and said we were making this our new hot spot, the belly bancer came out and gave us a private show...and this girl was smokin hot. I mean, it's a Sunday night, the place is dead quiet, and they treated us like royalty. Also very impressive was the fact that chef, the dancer, and the manager all sat down with us individually and shot the s*&% with us. Very refreshing. After the dancer did her second dance (complete with costume change), Daniel brought us out a complimentary dessert of Baklavah. It was incredible, flakey yet sticky on the inside. Im tellin ya, if you're looking for a menu that you'll be drooling over and a staff that treats you like family, this is the place. And when you get there, ask Daniel about the secret menu. Loves it.", "author": "Catharine C."}

I even arranged a party for my son's school an everyone raved about it.  The food is excellent....love the prawns and my husband swears my the filet mignon that wrapped in cheese and my 2 boys loves the chicken dish.  Gabriela and the whole family is wonderful and very friendly.  The atmosphere is amazing.  Parking is easy considering the area is pretty busy.  Thank you for the wonderful experience and good dining.  Hope to see you soon.  Hi Gabriela.", "author": "Rosalie E."}

I can't believe this meal happened.\n\nWe walked in and nodded appreciatively to each other, as if to say \"ooh, classy joint! Damn classy!\"  The colors on the walls  were vibrant, there was a golden chair in a spotlight, and a simplified map of egypt rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise to allow the Nile to run along a horizontal wall.  The map included \"Temple of Ramses II\" in two different places.  At the beginning of our culinary tour of Egypt, our waiter was dressed perfectly normally in slacks and a well-pressed shirt.  Imagine our surprise when, ten minutes after we got there, he comes at us in a NOVELTY PHARAOH COSTUME!!  He never acknowledged the change.  But he did talk to us about the 49ers quarterback woes at length from inside his headdress. \nWhen the belly dancer came on, we were treated to a full 15 minute routine full of awkward eye contact and avoiding looking at her boobies.  During this time, there was no restaurant service until Glaucia, a graduate of the affiliate belly dancing academy, finished dancing.  Then she came on for a repeat performance at the end of the meal, when we were the only ones left in the restaurant.  Whoo!  I still can't believe he was wearing that costume!  \n\nOn a separate note, the rice tasted like it had been microwaved in a pouch.  Weird, right?  But he did bring us complementary hummus and babaganouj so that was classy of him.  Damn classy.", "author": "Mary C."}

Am a little confused because I guess it's been through at least one name change.  Seems to suffer from \"revolving\" management and employees.  I'm not sure what they're trying to transmit to the public.  Are they trying to serve food?  Are they hooked up with some bellydance venue?  What's the story?  It seems to have gone from an odd cast of characters (fat-a**ed owner and homely dancers) to a pompous middle-eastern \"front-man\" and his obnoxious loudmouthed pipsqueaky daughter, to no-talent dancers and some \"school\"(?) and overpriced cuisine.  Who is the chef? Who is the owner?  Who are these dancers and why should any of us care?  Bad management, mediocre food, rude dancer and badly organized.  Every time I went it was because someone else wanted to go and the third time was definitely NOT the charm.", "author": "v c."}

After talking to Samar and Hatem during dinner, I had such a better appreciation for the experience and respect for the culture.  It was nothing that I had expected...the hummus was the best I've ever had I'll tell you that...it's not thin or generic like the ones I've tried.  The hummus I tried last night tasted so fresh and more fluffy? creamy? I'm not sure how to describe it.  I had the filet mignon and my friend had the pacific sole...we loved it!  You can tell (taste) that the meals were prepared with fine, quality ingredients.  Samar and Hatem, who were very knowledgeable and proud of their culture,  shared with us so much interesting information and history related to the food and the difference between their food and imitations of Egyptian food.   The decor was beautiful...it adds to the whole experience.  This place is no joke...come here if you're open-minded and willing to experience something new and to be educated. Oh and if you order Arabic coffee...have Samar tell you your fortune!", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

It was our 15 yr old daughter's birthday and we were looking for more of an experience than just a meal.  We were not disappointed.   First, the food was outstanding.  We ordered the grilled fish (moist and flavorful), the chicken kebab (very flavorful), the rack of lamb (melt-in-your-mouth tender and tasty) and the beef tenderloin stuffed with feta and herbs (perfectly cooked and delicious).  The prices are moderate and the amount of food is substantial.  Now for the service.  There was only one other table of customers when we arrived on a Sunday at 6:30 so it was as though we had our own personal attendant.  Our server, Daniel, was very attentive and a lot of fun.  He told the girls stories about Egyptian mythical characters and was extremely knowledgeable about Egyptian history and food.  To make our daughter's birthday more festive, he changed into a King Tut costume midway through the meal ... no kidding!  At 7:30, the belly-dancing began, and although this was the dancer's debut appearance, she was excellent.   Very pretty, poised, and talented.   The evening ended with a complementary birthday dessert, with Happy Birthday spelled out in chocolate hieroglyphics.  All in all, a great time and delicious food.", "author": "Deborah S."}
