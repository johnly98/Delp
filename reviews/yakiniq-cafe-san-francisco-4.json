This aesthetic continues when you walk in: there's a bunch of comfy seating but there's bad lighting and it just looks old. \n\nThere was only one person working there when I walked in around 9:45am on a Tuesday morning, but lots of people were at tables and seats reading or working, so it must be a pretty good place to work. Because there was only one person taking orders at the cash register and making drinks and preparing dishes and there was a line, there was a bit of a wait for my drink. I also worked there for about 15 minutes while I finished my drink and dish.\n\nI ordered the Yuzu Honey Tea and Lemon Meringue. I just wanted the tea, but there is a $6 credit card minimum so I added a baked good to my drink order and BAM by total went up from roughly $4.50 to $12. Well okay then. \n\nThe Lemon Meringue was crisp and crunchy (from the meringue), with good but not great flavor that wasn't very strong or lemony. The Yuzu Honey Tea was pricey for what you get but refreshing and flavorful. \n\nThe service could've been much friendlier, but I did feel bad she was working alone and must have felt stress to work faster because there was a line of people. I will be back to try other drinks, but I'll do so with cash on me!!", "author": "Lizzie S."}

This is the spiritual opposite of that place where young Asians epoxy themselves at tables to stare intensely at their laptop screens. There was no conversation, no music, just the not-so-hushed tones of fingers clicking on keyboards. There were desserts in the display case, but I was interested in getting something warm to drink. Although I was intrigued by the sweet potato latte, I went with the more predictable $4.25 Ginger & Honey Tea (photo: http://bit.ly/2MmEhP2).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-10", "description": "I debated whether or not I should write this review, and it hinged on whether it would be useful to other customers. In the end, I do think my experience can be a useful caution. \n\nTwo key insights: \n\n1. The cafe does not necessarily open at 9 am despite what the sign outside says or what's on the website/yelp. It opens whenever the person setting up is done setting up. So if you're outside waiting and it's 9 am, and you can clearly see someone inside that can let you in, just keep waiting and try to do something useful with your time. Otherwise, if like me you are looking for a good workday cafe - don't plan on coming as they open. \n\n2. As a confrontational but reasonable person, I prefer to give feedback in person and not on Yelp. If you are like me and if you have any reasonable feedback to give, do NOT give it in person at this place. Instead, do it on Yelp as it'll save you an unpleasant situation. Today I made the mistake of voicing my feedback on the opening hour. I had gotten to the cafe about 10 minutes early, so just waited outside after seeing the sign outside that says \"opens at 9 am...\". At 9 am, I could see that the person setting up (the owner I later found out) was almost done but she shot me an annoyed look and just kept bustling around. 9:05 came and she finally opened the door and again gave me annoyed look. I'm not sure what I did to deserve this hostility from the getgo, so I said \"Your sign outside says the cafe opens at 9 am, so I was hoping you would let me in at that time.\" At this point, the owner began a tirade of verbal abuse and things escalated before I knew what was going on. She said things like \"You don't have to come here! Why are you even here?\" and \"Are you that much in a rush??\" with an increasingly loud voice, to which I responded \"well, I value my time.\" The response to that was \"I open the cafe WHEN I WANT TO OPEN the cafe\". After a few minutes of this, to calm things down, I said \"Look, I'm sorry. I get your policy now and next time I'll come later.\" She responded \"You should be sorry!\" and then I said \"well, can I order my latte and sit down to work now?\". Her response was \"Leave! I am not serving you today.\" And so I left, still not understanding what had happened. Perhaps she was having a bad day even before I arrived, but I don't understand how anything I said could trigger someone to have that irrationally big of a reaction. \n\nI did not expect her to apologize or even to change the policy. Maybe I should've just waited indefinitely. But as a customer, I should be able to voice feedback especially if there is a discrepancy between the store's actions and what was communicated to me as store policy, from the door and website. The response could have just been an explanation that that's how things are done there, and I would have been fine with it. However, it is not okay to respond to feedback so uncivilly by blowing up in my face and refusing me service, even as I repeatedly tried to de-escalate the situation. \n\nFrom a number of other reviews, it seems others have had similar negative experiences with the owner. Needless to say, I will not be going back there again. And yes, taking to Yelp is probably the best way to voice critique, sadly.", "author": "Crystal H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-08-27", "description": "PSA to all who reads this review: THERE IS PEANUT BUTTER IN THE CHICKEN, IN THE BANH MI AND THE CAESAR SALAD. \n\nI pass along this warning because yes, I meekly sat at allergy tables growing up in elementary school (and met my first crush at one, so let's not downplay these exclusionary experiences). I'm Asian, and I typically know my ingredients in foods/sauces. And maybe I've been far removed from Chicago's JJ Street Thai Food days and this is separation anxiety at its finest (worst). \n\nYakini IQ did not put that these items contain nuts on the menu. It said: Thai satay sauce, spring mix, carrots, cucumber, something like that. But if you're ALLERGIC TO NUTS, a sprinkle of nut on a salad makes it a NUT SALAD. A single walnut in the middle of a fruity parfait renders it a WALNUT PARFAIT. To everyone, a grain of nut in a food dish is just a dish that happens to have a nut in it. For people allergic to nuts, nuts are alpha. They're like the quarterbacks of the football team. They get all the attention, not because they have some special God-given right, they get the attention due to the way they operate. Whatever has a nut in it becomes a nut dish. Therefore, every dish that has nuts needs to come with a nut warning. QED. \n\nSo, after a mild allergic reaction, I pointed out to the woman behind the counter that they should really put that the banh mi and the caesar salad contains nuts on the menu. Her reply was, \"if you have allergies, you should've asked\". I couldn't believe it. You listed cucumber and dijon mustard, pretty inconsequential food items, but not nuts?\n\nI said, \"would you mind getting me another dish without nuts in it?\" Her response: \"we don't really do this, because you should have asked. But we'll do it this time\". \n\nNot warning people out there that there are potential deathly allergens is one thing. An uppity, rude, sassy response, without any sort of apology, or empathy that I just suffered through an allergy is another. I felt extremely disrespected. Maybe I was a dumbass to not check, but that's the thing: I always do. There has not been a single menu in an establishment that I've visited that doesn't points out nuts. It's a pretty catch-all situation in the food and bev industry. \n\nI said, \"you guys should put it on the menu anyway. What's the harm in that? Err on the side of caution.\" Her response: \"if you have this allergy, you should check. We've never had this problem before.\" It's not like I thought to myself, \"what wheel of chance shall I spin today with my horrific allergy? How.... sexy and... dangerous!\" It's sooo much work to mention that there's nuts in lieu of people dying, right? What a low quality response. The \"we've never had this problem before\" response follows the logic of \"just because it never happened means it never will\". \n\nSo if you guys are reading this, yes, I should have checked. But restaurants don't operate on a \"you should ask policy\". That is completely unacceptable. Write it on the board! Takes 20 seconds.", "author": "Celena C."}

Coming and looking inside this lovely caf\u00e9 makes me feel like this was now my second home to settle down and read a newspaper.  Even though there are several houseflies flying in its vicinity, no fly would ever bother me while sitting in any table.  On the left wall was the cabinet filled with tin cans of Harney & Sons.  My aim to purchase in YakiniQ was to try none other than the tea flower.\n\nWhat makes this tea flower interesting is its lengthy steeping.  How long will it steep to picture perfection?  Depends.  The water in the clear glass mug was very hot, making the tea flower ball expand as quick as possible.  Viola!  After the tea flower sank to the bottom of the glass cup to complete its transformation, its tea color got darker, more bitter, and lukewarm.  Still tasted good; what mattered most was the tea flower transformation.  If I was patient long enough, the tea flower would look more beautiful.\n\nI'm sure there are other caf\u00e9s out there that are good for tea flower steeping.  YakiniQ was the first.  Customer service turned out good and pleasant with nice working women.  Next time I come here, I be willing to have the same cup and see what happens if I go for seconds.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

However, when I was trying to place my order for my latte, the cashier was too pre-occupied with the couple leaving their empty cups and told them that there was a bin near the cash wrap that they NEED to place their finished dinnerwear. Note, no apology was made for this minor distraction.\n\nI placed my order, asked for a to-go cup, got my drink and left. At first sip, I was hoping to get a wave of sweet potato with a dash of sugar, instead, I just got a milky substance with random chunks of questionable root vegetables. No flavor to the drink, and doubted my past experiences with YakiniQ. Maybe I was thinking of a different place that served a delicious sweet potato latte? Couldn't be, because I would be hitting up K-Town every damn winter weekend, getting this drink, instead of yearning for this while I'm in San Francisco.\n\nFrom my first review until now, a lot has changed in my personal life, but YakiniQ had remained constant, until this year.

I don't know her name but she is a white female with an accent. I had arrived and sat down to set up\nMy station to work before going to get a coffee. Before I could even connect to the WiFi she felt so inclined to walk over to be and ask if I was going to purchase something. I told Her I would but I wanted to set up first. She rolled her eyes and rudely walked away. I was completely annoyed by her and I didn't want her bothering me any further so I went to the front to order my usual coffee and I asked her if she asks everyone if they are going to order something. She said only if they are here for more than 20 minutes, I had just sat down so I was there for less than 5. She proceeded to tell me I had be here for more than 20 which is why she came over. The cafe is not full and I am the only African American woman here.  I hadn't even connected to WiFi yet so here claim of me being here over 20 minutes is false and baseless.  Her prejudice was not appreciated. As I type this I see other people walking in and not ordering immediately and she isn't harassing them.

What type of person stares you blank in the face and fails to respond when you say \"Hi\" or \"Thanks\" to them? Well, happened to me twice at YakiniQ Cafe - the cashiers would rather ignore me and speak amongst themselves in Russian. They didn't even bother announcing when my order was ready. I guess I'm supposed to check their counter every few minutes? At least treatment was equal - they weren't very friendly to other patrons either. \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nI'm giving two stars for the ambiance, since it seems like a nice place to work - a good number of people were on their laptops. It looked like they were intensely studying. There were also a few couches to hang out on. If I lived nearby and needed a place to work, I'd consider it.\n\nThe food, however, was pretty disappointing. I had the sweet potato latte - which was good - but nothing unique if you've had the Korean latte drink mixes before (Woori Market is around the corner - highly recommended). I wonder if they just used a drink mix and added some foam on top. I also had a slice of yuzu pound cake, which was very dry. The yuzu syrup on top was fragrant with a strong citrus punch - such a shame it didn't permeate the entire cake! Certainly a work in progress. It's too bad I tried it, since I would've actually given YakiniQ Cafe 3 stars without it.\n\nIt's not a bad place if you'd like to get some work in Japantown - just don't expect friendly service and stay away from the pound cake!", "author": "Larissa M."}

When I bright the teas back, the clerk said it was just made yesterday so should be good.

Saturday morning and there was only one person working - althought there were only 2 people ahead of us, one of them was ordering 4 coffee drinks. So there was a bit of a wait...but it was fine. Everyone was chill and it's a lovely environment.\n\nI couldn't decide between the sweet potato latte and the lavender latte. Since I'd never had sweet potato, I decided to go with that. Hubby ordered a cappuccino. It is a little pricey. If you want espresso shots in your sweet potato latte, they cost .95 cents each. So for one, that's affordable. But for 2-3, it's not. Think about it - 2-3 shots is what you really need to get that caffeine in you. Anyway, it tasted pretty darn good...but it was pretty darn filling. I think I'd definitely do with lavender next time, if I'm going to order a frou frou coffee drink. Hubby got his cappuccino and a chocolate croissant.\n\nConversely, their macarons are priced right. If you buy the 6 macaron deal, they come out to about exactly the same as Chantal Guillon pricing, which I find about as affordable a macaron as is out there. Waaaaay better pricing than Bottega Louie (I know - that's LA - but those who are interested in macarons will be interested in this piece of info). Got two Earl Grey, two Pumpkin, and two Kona Coffee and the teen girl said they were amazing (and she's the Bottega Louie fan). \n\nThe lovely woman working all alone was super friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-02-06", "description": "I love this coffee shop in the heart of Japantown! \n\nI always thought that Yakiniku was just the Japanese way to say Korean BBQ (it is, Yaki meaning grilled, and Niku meaning Beef). And that YakiniQ was simply a Japanese/Korean BBQ place. I never realized that next door (actually, downstairs) was this great, spacious coffee shop, YakniQ Cafe! (The two are owned by the same family). \n\nFirst, it is spacious! This not one of those cramped chain shops, like the Mermaid or the \"PT\" place that taught the Mermaid, or the \"PHZ\" place that likes baristas to mix coffee like Tom Cruise in a movie about bartenders. \n\nNo, it is a quiet, relaxing place, to meet, study, and do your thing. No hard charging, caffeine addicted, wanabees, or hipsters talking loud and trying to cast airs. Nope, a totally different vibe, sort of a quiet humility to it. In that way, it seems very Japanese in energy.   \n\nThe decor helps the vibe. Beautiful hardwood floors, antique wood furniture, Japanese paper lantern light fixtures, and walls covered with individual art collections, that rotate periodically with local artists. As you enter, the Left side tables for 4, are for groups to meet and talk, and the right side tables for 2, are set for those laptop geeks, because the only outlets that work are on the right side. In the middle, is a large couch, sort of a lounge area, and behind, a large community table. The back wall is populated with estate sale nick-nacks and tchotchkes to make things interesting, as well as some board games for public sharing. \n\nThe counter is in the front right. They have a bevy of home-made cookies and baked goods, made by the owner herself, Christy. They also have a dozen or so casual food dishes, like sandwiches or salads. They also have ice cream. Of course they have Espresso and other coffee drinks, as well as many types of teas (mostly in bag form), and other refrigerated drinks. \n\nThe staff is friendly, they will bring your food order table side to you, or call out your drink when it is ready. So they are just like the vibe, pretty low key and unobtrusive. It isn't like you will hear them shouting to each other their personal life over the loud music playing, like at some of those Green Mermaid locations I have been. \n\nI come here and work on my computer, or meet clients for meetings. I have tried many of their food items, and they are delicious, given the lack of a real full kitchen. \n\nBut don't come here! I want this place to have seats or tables when I do! Or if you do, buy something and leave. Don't be a table hog and sit 6 hours on your laptop, nursing 1 drink. C'mon, enjoy the vibe, but share!", "author": "Wanugee N."}

It's a great place to study - there are a ton of tables, the layout is open and spacious, and there are outlets all along one side. Additionally, the options for drinks are pretty good - I'm a fan of the Yuzu Honey Tea and the Sweet Potato Latte. Their Bingsoo is delicious, and their riceballs are huge (although they don't have too many options for savory food, so I advise you eat a real meal before you get here!)\n\nThe only caveat is that they don't have air conditioning, and so it can get a little hot and stuffy. Also, the wifi is slow as balls. But it's always quiet, people are always studying and respectful of their noise volume -- I haven't found anywhere better to get some work done than YakiniQ.", "author": "Jessie Y."}

I don't like warm drinks and she said if you don't like it I'll remake it.

When I searched on Yelp, I was confused to see the name YakiniQ Cafe, since that implies meat. Turns out it is just next door to an actual BBQ place, and I assume it is owned by the same people.\n\nThe cafe is actually a really nice and large space, and there were lots of people already there getting some work done. It was really nice and quiet and I ended up being quite productive there. The only slight downside is that the lighting can be pretty dim depending on where you are seated, because they don't have large overhead lights, but depend on smaller lights scattered throughout. It isn't so dark that it bothered me, but it might not be the best for your eyes.\n\nI ended up ordering:\n+Lavender Latte: at first glance, they clearly don't put as much effort into the artwork, but taste is what really matters. I enjoy that floral \"soap\" taste of lavender but it might not be for everyone. I'm also not a coffee expert, so I can't confirm the quality.\n+3 Macarons (Matcha, Strawberry Champagne, Rose): I feel like similar with the latte, these were not the prettiest and were slightly sloppy, but they were yummy. They had a good texture and chew. I would say the Matcha was the least impressive though.\n\nI was kind of shocked by the prices, but I am also not used to SF prices, so I'm just going to assume this is normal. The prices were not clearly labeled, but I ended up paying $12+ for all of it, so I assumed around $6 for the latte and $2 per macaron.\n\nThis cafe ended up being perfect for my needs. It was quite pricey, especially since the presentation was lacking, even a little sloppy. However taste-wise it was good.", "author": "Helen W."}

Luckily, one of my friends came here a bit earlier to snag a spot at a table. One side of the cafe has tables that can seat 4 people comfortably, while the other side is more for those that have a party of 1 or two. There are couches in the middle of the cafe, and when I got there, the place was pretty crowded, and if my friend didn't come earlier to get a table, we wouldn't have anywhere to sit. The ambiance is very cafe-esque and quaint. There is music playing in the background so the cafe isn't too quiet, but it is quiet enough that we can have conversations without having to yell. I found out that the credit card minimum is $6 so keep that in mind if you wanted just a coffee or just a pastry. I decided to try the lavender latte, and it was delicious!! They do some little latte art on it, and even add a sprinkle of dried lavender on top. I appreciated the dried lavender because it did make the drink smell good, but when I was drinking the latte, some got stuck in my throat and that was unpleasant. Also, I wish the latte was a little hotter, because it was lukewarm when I got it, and it cooled off pretty quickly. I like to drink my hot drinks slowly, but by the time I finished my drink, it was cold.

I would rather spend money on some Chantal Guillon macarons for $2.25 each in Hayes Valley.\n\n\nWhat I love:\n- The interior is spacious, and I get a lot of work done. There are many seats available, and there's a good number of outlets at the right side.\n- There's two Japanese grocery stores nearby where I can grab some prepared food and sneakily consume them for dinner at the cafe.\n- IT CLOSES AT 10 PM.

They have a nice room with enough seating and enough space to make pounding out some work conceivable.\n\nBut those prices! Dear Lord. I've never seen such a pile of mediocre, mass-produced garbage coffee game, and yet here it's presented as though the gods who invented Blue Bottle and Sightglass had a baby who personally gilded these beverages in gold leaf. $4.75 for a freaking chai latte? That consists of some instant powder and some steamed milk? That's less work than an actual latte. Want almond milk rather than moo juice? Add another dollar, and with tax now you're above 6 bucks for a drink that is resolutely, almost proudly, nothing special. So let's say you want to economize. How about just some plain tea? They have that! It's $3.50, which could almost be reasonable if we were talking about an actual pot of loose leaf tea, enough to keep you going for a while. But wait! This fine recipe calls for a paper cup containing a pre-made industrial tea bag you could buy at any grocery store, filled with hot water! A true revelation. Food prices won't treat you any better.\n\nIn all, this is an agreeable enough space, but one pays so much for the privilege that it seems little wonder it's mostly empty except on weekends.

However, drinks are mediocre at best. \n\nSweet Potato Latte- delicious! Right amount of sweetness and milky-ness. Definitely can tell the sweet potato flavor in the drink, not overpowered by the sweetness. \n\nYuzu tea- Too sweet! And it tasted like something you can make at home from concentrate. \n\nIced Matcha Latte- Quite disappointed, the drink is pretty bland. The staff did tell me that the drink is unsweetened, and you will have to add either syrup, honey or brown sugar, which is great because you can adjust your own sweetness level (don't be surprised by how much syrup you have to add). However, the drink is just not 'matcha' enough. It mostly tasted like milk with a little bit of matcha flavor. \n\nPrice is steep for their drinks, about $5 each. It is a great place to sit comfortably and catch up with friends though. I would pass for their drinks here next time, but try their desserts!", "author": "Karen C."}

I think it was well made--it had the right consistency and amount of milk, and the latte base flavor balanced well with the sweet potato flavor, neither being too overwhelming. But I found it to be a pretty weird combination. I can see why people would go for it, but I couldn't wrap my head around the starchy and grainy taste. I do recommend the strawberry yuzu tea though--light, refreshing, and great for warm days.\n\nI also got some macarons--pandan, sesame, honey lavender, and green tea yuzu. All were amazing! This isn't the only place for high quality macarons in the city, but I really liked the variety of flavors, especially the more Asian ones.

After the sign outside,\nrave reviews from Yelp, they ended up not being super reminiscent of sweet potato and had a strange grainy texture (which, yes, I realize came from sweet potato. It could have been forgiven if the latte actually tasted like sweet potato). My latte literally just tasted like coffee, my friend's had more of a sweet potato flavor due to the lack of coffee, but it was disappointing overall. \n\nSo, final verdict. Would I go back?

As a former restaurant staff, I would be definitely surprised, or shocked if I found mold on customer's food. I wonder they might had the same situation many times already, and that's why they weren't surprised at all.\n\nOf course, my husband asked for a refund, but the manager refused it at the first time. She accepted to make refund at the end, but her attitude was very rude all the time till I got the refund (just for the moldy cake). When she took my credit card to make the refund, she made me wait 10+ minutes because she was taking new customers' orders under this situation. She also told me \"I refunded you just for the cake because other food were good\". I almost got paralyzed by hearing what she said. I just couldn't believe she said that after she served a customer a moldy food. I couldn't stop myself asking her whether she understands what she did, and she said \"yes\".....\n\nAs I say, she never apologized me throughout the conversation. \nI gave my contact information, and asked the owner (she said the owner had the responsibility) to call me, but no call yet after 2 days so far.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-03", "description": "Came here for some dessert after my boyfriend's not very successful birthday dinner. Located in Japan Town, YakiniQ is a very cute and modern little cafe shop located next to the YakiniQ dining restaurant. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the sweet potato latte, which many other Yelpers have recommended, while his sister ordered the green tea latte. Also ordered a few macarons, a cheesecake, and a coffee crumb cake. Everything came out fairly quickly. Lots of small tables for people to sit and study or chat. Music is playing in the background, and it's just a very nice place to sit and chill. \n\nThe sweet potato latte was indeed unique, but it's not for everybody. I like sweet potato, but I wasn't a fan of it in the blended drink form. I could smell the sweet potato and it really tasted legit, but ... just too different than what I am used to. My boyfriend's sister said the green tea latte was good, but nothing special. I believe the cheesecake and coffee crumb cake were also good, but I didn't try them. The macarons were pretty delicious. They're $2.25 each, which is quite pricey as they're a lot smaller than the macarons at 'Lette or Bottega in LA. But they are definitely good and tasty. The outside is soft and crumbly, and the filling is a melt in your mouth tastiness. I read from another review that they are from Phillipe's. I wonder if that's true and if all their desserts are from someplace else. \n\nI tried the rose, champagne and the passion fruit. All very good. The rose and champagne tasted very similar, except the rose flavor was more prominent than in the champagne one (the champagne macaron tasted like rose basically). The passion fruit was decent and tasted like passion fruit, but I prefer my macarons of a sweeter variety. I like that they have games and cards on the shelves that you can take and borrow. \n\nIt's a very nice place to sit and catch up and eat dessert. It's a little pricey for my taste, but worth the money. I'm not too big of a fan of latte or coffee or tea without the boba, but I believe the drinks are decent. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area or if you need a place to sit and catch up!", "author": "Tiffany C."}

I know it's unfair but that's what I use as my standard.\n\nIt appears it's a great place to study since there are enough tables and outlets, and they do have free wifi that is password protected. It's a great place to hang out with friends too to grab a cup of coffee and a bite to eat if you are in the area, and want a place that's pretty laid back.\n\nThe reason I think it's more 3.5 stars rather than 4 stars was I wasn't impressed with the coffee and desserts here. I got their popular sweet potato latte and my fiance just got a regular latte. The regular latte was alright...nothing special. We actually were not a fan of the sweet potato latte. It really was a liquified sweet potato. I think I was expecting something smoother and creamier with a hint of sweet potato taste. But I felt like I was just taking a bite into a sweet potato. Also got two macarons and they were fairly good but thought the price of $2.25 each was overpriced. Alot of their desserts I think were overpriced actually....", "author": "Kristina L."}

I say novelty because that's exactly what they are. I could enjoy a couple good sips at most. The sweet potato latte doesn't actually have any coffee. I'm pretty sure it was just a combination of pur\u00e9ed sweet potato with steamed milk. Another new option was the pumpkin latte, which I'm guessing isn't anything close to the pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks. I also tried the nutella latte, another specialty drink served in a bowl with a long spoon. I think the spoon was for scrapping the nutella stuck to the bottom of the bowl. The drinks were more attention-grabbing than impressive. \n\nThere were about eight or so different flavors of macarons, which included: hazelnut, espresso, green tea yuzu, earl grey, rose, pistachio, chocolate, and passion fruit. I tried the green tea yuzu and earl grey. Interesting flavors, but not the best macarons by any stretch. They were very sweet and too chewy. \n\nThe one thing that I really liked about YakiniQ was the atmosphere and interior design. It felt very homey, a cross between someone's really nicely decorated, Ikea-furnished living room and a library. It felt like a good place to study or pump out that thesis paper. The space is large with multiple tables, which makes it great for groups. They also have a number of board games on the back wall to entertain customers.

I'm not even sure why that's their bestseller. If that's the best thing they have, I am not even going to waste my money on the others. People probably only get this because it's unique. Well...go ahead, take your candied yams from Thanksgiving, throw it in a blender, and add milk. There, you just saved yourself ~$4 and won't feel as bad if you have to throw it away because you don't like the idea of drinking liquid candied yam. That's basically what it is.\n\nMacarons? DOUBLE AVOID. Those of you who think this is the best macaron in the city are grossly misguided. Do a search for macarons on Yelp and you will find the true good places. Also, charging $2.25 for crappy macarons is too expensive. It's like...on par with Berkeley Bowl's macarons (that's pretty bad too), but at least Berkeley Bowl's are only $1 each. The macarons here were chewy instead of light and airy (that high quality French feeling in your mouth), and were ridiculously sweet. True French macarons are not like this. However, props to them for the unique flavors: green tea yuzu and pumpkin are two I had. I also had passionfruit and hazelnut.  I wish I didn't order so many...if I had known they were not high quality, I would not have.\n\nThe only good thing about this place is the d\u00e9cor and ambiance. Even at that, the place is rather small, and the bathroom is a bit ghetto. I know it's SF and real estate and cleanliness are hard to come by...but the pictures on Yelp make it look much nicer than it actually is.\n\nI'd be willing to try YakiniQ BBQ, but do not ever need to come to this caf\u00e9 again.

I want to give this place a higher review since i come so often, but a couple of things prevent me from doing so:\n\n1. Super few outlets. I know they're trying to cut back from using too much energy, but the square feet ratio to the number of outlets is abysmal. Only one side of the cafe has any outlets, and the tables with outlets are super small. It's hard to spread out and get work done with a table that I can barely keep my elbows on. That side is also kind of dark, so unless you're working on just your computer, I wouldn't sit there. All of the larger tables do not have outlets, so bring your laptop charged or don't bring it at all. \n\n2. The prices are a bit higher than regular cafes...and I wouldn't mind if their food and drinks weren't so hit or miss or not worth it because you don't get as much product as you would at other places. Their coffees and espressos aren't too bad. I actually quite like their yuzu drinks and I'm a fan of their sweet potato drinks (though they're not for everyone). But $6+ for a slice of cake is kind of ridiculous especially when they're not super special. The macarons are good though, and those are expensive no matter where you go so that's okay.\n\nThose are my two biggest gripes to be honest. Otherwise this is a solid #3 on my list of cafes to work at since they're so far and few in San Francisco that really remind me of an Korean style cafe.", "author": "Alison M."}

I was led to this place and ordered the Matcha (spelled \"Macha\") latte which was devoid of any hint or taste of green tea matcha (although the only indication that it was matcha was the green color). Simply put, it tasted like glorified hot milk with the semblance of green food coloring. The latte was also pricier than the far better and authentic matcha latte's I have had in SF.  This place just falls short of being a hype. To add salt to the wound, as there were no seats available in the cafe, I sat near the waiting area near the cash register in hopes of scoring a seat later on.  But, alas, the stern cashier lady asked me to leave as I was not allowed to \"camp\" in the seats near the door after paying for the expensive \"Macha\" latte (where was I supposed to sit and do my work?).

There's seating enough for 35ish people inside without being too crowded.\n\nThe minus is mostly for the price of the  sweet potato latte, $4.10?, which i think is super expensive for what it looks like it's made from. Another minus star for the cashier guy who was rushing me - let me order at my pace whether that takes 2 or 6minutes of looking at the menu jeez. \n\nBut if i'm ever back in the area, i'll give it another go.", "author": "Sarah K."}

The prep time for the food items is pretty slow (10+ minutes for a salad). The decor is great and it's clean and cute inside, but it's overpriced for what you get.\n\nThe sign says they close at 9, but at 8pm the same male employee went into full on mean teacher mode and began flickering the lights on and off and then yelling to the whole cafe that they are closing early, and we had 10 minutes to close our laptops and get out.

Tonight, I found the time to walk-in. To my surprise, the place is huge and roomie and so cute inside. They have free Wi-Fi and sell lots of cakes and pastries. So cute. And the seating is comfortable and cute. Lots of mismatched chairs, but it certainly works well for the place. And lots of artwork related to LATTE.\n\nWe grabbed a cup of the Sweet Potato Latte (no caffeine) and a cup of the Yuzu Honey Tea (no caffeine). If I wasn't overly full, I would have went and tried their other snacks such as their macaroons and matcha shortbread. That will be for my next trip.\n\nSweet Potato Latte was very foamy and very light. You can tell it was light because the large cup weighed like air. I think they may have put Sweet Potato puree in the milk. It was a bit sweet for my taste. But definitely very creative and for Sweet Potato Lovers, would be a definitely big hit. But I am not Sweet Potato lover, so this was only a so-so for me.\n\nYuzu Honey Tea was very fragrantly. I could smell the citrus fruit Yuzu when I opened the lid. The Yuzu was tasty, but the honey was too much for me.\n\nOverall, the drinks were only so-so for me. But I really like the ambience and the vibe and the cuteness of this place. If I am looking for a relaxing coffee place to write my papers or quiet time, I wouldn't hesitate to come back and hang out at this place for peace and quiet.", "author": "Janice T."}

Can you imagine anything more comforting and cozy on a cold SF evening than that? Well, I couldn't, so I walked right in, and ordered one straight away. I couldn't resist ordering a couple of their macarons as well, though all of their dessert selections looked so incredible it was hard not to order everything!\n\nThe interior of the place is really quiet because it looks to be mostly a study/working cafe. I love places like this, where the customers are encouraged to make themselves comfortable and stay for a long time. The one thing I thought was kind of lame were the people who brought in their own drinks and food. I understand the whole starving student thing but if you're going to take up a whole table (and there aren't very many of them), you could at least buy a little something from the business that's providing it for you. \n\nOther than that, I was completely charmed by the funky, eclectic decor and the young, friendly staff.

A nice, cozy place to share coffee and dessert with a friend or two.", "author": "Vincent L."}

For a Saturday night, it was busy, but not so busy we couldn't get a seat. It has a nice atmosphere and felt very homey. Perfect for a post-dinner coffee with your friends or if you're on a date!\n\nThe table we sat at had crayons and guestbooks with blank pages. A quick glance through some of the older ones revealed that most people are pretty bad at drawing. And that a lot of people like drawing boobs on other peoples' drawings. It was actually kind of funny to leaf through all of what everyone else drew.\n\nThe drinks were really good as you'd expect from a place like this. I had a ginger honey tea, which I really liked because it wasn't so gingery as to be off-putting. Others in my group thought it was too sweet, though, and that's a common thing I've heard about all of their drinks.\n\nStill, this is a pretty nice place within walking distance from Japantown.

There was a festival or something going on and I barely found parking. I thought it would be noisy in the cafe or crowded in there. \n\nWalked in and it was mellow and relaxing. People are usually studying or reading in here and its a very refreshing ambiance. People do talk though, but it's more like a chatter rather than a full on conversation. \n\nThe female server was very nice and friendly and laughed at me when I couldn't find the password for the WIFI when it was right in front of my face when I was asking for it. Very kind and very friendly. The male server was less friendly, but still okay for the most part. \n\nFOOD. I ordered the famous Sweet Potato Latte Hot Drink and some Macarons. The latte was alright, I could taste the Sweet Potato but I just wish it was sweeter for my taste. Still a very delightful treat. THE MACARONS ARE DELICIOUS. I ordered the Pistachio and Hazelnut ones. A lot better tasting than the ones you can get at CAKO. \n\nPRICE. $6 Minimum for Cards if you don't have any cash. I spent a total of $14 with 4 Macarons and a Sweet Potato Latte. It is a little pricey, but you do get free wifi and a quiet study place. \n\nLove coming here when I just want a chill ambiance to study or relax at. Wish there were more sofa's.

It's a perfect place to hang out, feeling happy and getting things done. The ambient just can't be beat. Most people come here to study, play chess, or just have a small talk, hence it's never too loud or too annoying. The staffs are always smiling and super polite. \n\nThe bad thing about this cafe increasing popularity is that unlike a few months ago, the cafe now gets crowded really fast. On weekend morning, all of the tables may have already been occupied by 12 PM. \n\nSo far I have tried Yuzu honey tea, white mocha, mocha, and matcha latte. I must say they are all made of quality ingredients. They serve the mocha in a bowl which is really unique--made me think of the cafe in K-drama. The matcha latte is 1000x better than the sugar loaded green tea latte at Starbucks. \n\nStreet parkings in the residential area are free and unlimited on the weekend.

When I'm not studying here, I enjoy coming with a few girlfriends to chat and hang out. It's a very lovely place, homey and cute. I also really enjoy the music they play there. It's pretty spacious in the cafe. However, during finals and midterms time, the cafe can get quite busy and tables can become difficult to come by. I go to school at UOP Dental School and I find a lot of my schoolmates here around test times. And as this place becomes more popular, it gets more crowded. Also, recently, they blocked off the outlets on one side of the cafe. \nI've tried a lot of their menu items. My go to drink is the Iced Yuzu Honey Tea or the Yuzu Palmer. Their shaved ice is also delicious and their baked goods in the window are just as good as they look. Most of their items are reasonably priced in my opinion. $3-4 for coffee and tea and around $7 for the deserts. I'm also a big fan of their onigiri. \nTheir staff is incredibly welcoming and genuinely nice. Their service is excellent. They also really try to get to know their customers and connect with them which I find very charming.\nThey do take credit cards, but they have a 10$ minimum charge.

The pastries are dainty looking and I can enjoy them while using their free wi-fi.\n\nThey deserve a star for carrying Tara's Organic Ice Cream (6 flavors: http://media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/DIUfRZ5zH6oc2nm0IDLxaQ/l), the best ice cream in the Bay Area. \n\n* Earl grey macaron: thick, chewy, cake-like cookies with crunchy edges, thick layer of filling, nice hints of sweet lemon and tea, fabulous\n* Green tea cupcake with red bean filling sesame frosting: moist cake with a few red beans inside, creamy frosting with black sesame, sesame seeds on top, loved the flavors and textures\n* Latte ($3.50): served in a cute bowl with too airy foam, just okay, coffee isn't their strong suit\n\nIt's a wonderful place to bring your laptop - serene music, adorable chairs, art on the walls, free wi-fi (secure), plenty of outlets and tables, and charming hanging paper lanterns. I saw some ladies in kimonos having tea here. Their cupcake calendar is so cute. \n\n$10 minimum for credit cards.\n\nYou know you love me. X0 X0, laptop camper.", "author": "Lolia S."}

I've worked at Noah's Bagel and Peets Coffee and now in hospitality. I have stopped by this cafe because i work across the street and it is pretty convenient. The few times i have visited has been an average wait for a beverage and food. The other times has been wayyyyy too long, i mean come on... 20 minute wait??? and the communication with the staff is very minimal. I wanted a bagel with cream cheese and the nice lady told me it would be a 30 min wait for it to be toasted after i paid.. another time (asked for it to be toasted) a different nice lady told me there was plain and sesame available, i choose sesame. After waiting 10 mins she hands me a cold bagel and said there was no more sesame.... well geez..... thanks for telling me!! =( at that moment i only had about 5 mins til i had to work. I've came in many times (only because it is convenient)  but i will not spend my money here anymore. it's just not worth it.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

The layout, the decorations, the feel. I knew this was a place I would be spending a lot of my free time. It was love at first sight! \n\nWhile I work and still go to school, I find time to come here at least once a week. The staff are friendly and welcoming, the drinks are delicious and they have a variety of snacks and food. While it might be on the pricey side, the ambiance of the cafe wonderful. I come here to do homework all the time, and I occasionally bring a friend just to sit and chat over drinks. On any given weekend, the cafe is usually packed, and it is a little louder than usual, so if you're going to do work, remember to bring headphones. \n\n Located next to Japantown mall, parking is a little difficult at times. Metered spots are everywhere, but a block up and on the opposite side of the street on Geary there is 2hour parking (free). \n\nRestrooms are located in the back, where you can also find a staircase leading up to YakiniQ AYCE korean BBQ. They have free wifi and a $10 minimum for credit cards. Outlets are only located on the right hand side of the cafe where there is a row of single tables. The supermarket next door is under construction thus the outlets are unavailable on the other side. \n\nMy usual drink is a hot caramel milk tea, and if I'm hungry for a snack, a warm slice of apple pie never fails me. The turkey cranberry sandwich is light and filling while spam musubi is just the little snack to have while studying, but be careful, there is a dab of wasabi in the musubi!", "author": "Stephanie C."}

Only the smalls tables on the right hand side of the place have outlets. The ones on the other side are all taped up.

It wasn't too sweet and the flavor combination was excellent. And, the shaved ice was quite big; therefore, it was well worth the reasonable price.\n\nIf I lived closer to Japantown I would probably stop by again.

Dunno what happened but this time around instead of two Japanese girls helping me, there were two hipsters who appeared to not be doing anything.  Cashier was some tall white boy who gave me an attitude when I paid him the total.  He didn't even mention the total plus tax, but when I handed him the total without tax all he said was \"There's tax.\"  And i was like \"what's the new total?\"  And he seemed pissed.  I dont' know how they found this loser, or how he ended up getting a job here.  Unfortunately he also made our drinks, and like his cashiering skills, the drinks were totally half assed.

To whoever worked on 11/15 around noon behind the counter, here is a clue: you better get your sh*t straight.  Even if you are the owner, there is no need to show your sh*t face to the customers.  You can take your Macaroons and shove them up to where the sun don't shine.  I will make sure that no one i know ever go to your store.  You are welcome", "author": "Ed Q."}

It wasn't until the GF and I were walking around on a rainy day, did we stumble upon such a glorious cafe!\n\nIt's actually a bigger cafe that it looks, with ample seating, a quiet atmosphere for studying, and loads of goodies to choose from on their menu. It's pretty cool how their menu spans from coffee and lattes, to macaroons and other desserts, to onigiri and banh mi.\n\nAfter spending a good 5-10mins starring at the menu, we opted for the sweet potato latte (iced) and a couple of their macaroons (passion fruit and matcha green tea).\n\nTheir sweet potato latte was amazing! Very smooth, with lots of bits of sweet potato. Glad they didn't just use a powder and create a mundane smoothie-like drink. I bet it tastes even better warm, but I guess I was just in a chilly mood that day. :)\n\nTheir macaroons are ok. I'd say that their matcha green tea flavor was a lot better than the passion fruit. It was a bit more concentrated than the passion fruit.\n\nOverall, this is an amazing place in the heart of SF Japantown.

There are a good selection of food, sweets and drinks.\n\nI was actually trying to find somewhere to eat lunch when I zoned in on the sweet potato latte. My thoughts \"I have to try it.\"  This drink is very interesting and it's exactly like eating sweet potato in liquid form. It tasted more like a sweet potato soup, but it was light and airy in texture. It's very comforting and definitely something I want to drink on a cold rainy day.\n\nIce cream was good.

You think that if I stumble downstairs from your bbq sister next door looking for shelter to while away my hour-long wait, you can lure me with a sweet potato latte, which speaks to the heart of every Korean, and then if I sit in your shop ooh-ing and aah-ing at all of the cute until my name is called, I will not notice until it's too late that I can't fully assault the meatmeatmeat privileges of AYCE because I have a rich beverage holding court inside my tummy, pursing its lips, crossing its arms and giving me a \"you got played\" side-eye.\n\nI know this is your schtick, cafe, and damn if I don't fall for it every time.\n\nI don't really know why I like YakiniQ Cafe so much-- can we all agree that it's completely overpriced (read: it's priced as if it were a cafe in Seoul, which, for all of its cheap and wonderful eats, charges disproportionately high prices for non-alcoholic beverages) and, honestly, that its offerings are not particularly over-the-top tasty? But I still love this cafe so much; maybe because not many places yet offer sweet potato lattes year-round in the Bay Area, or because it's such a brightly-lit, cheerful, quiet-but-still-upbeat oasis from the general gloom that lingers over that area of the city, or maybe because one night, while sequestered here in queue for a particularly late barbecue jaunt, the manager and the barista announced closing time with a harmonica and a rhyme and a little bit of my heart melted into my sweet potato latte.\n\nYeah, I can't really put a finger on what it is that attracts me to this place. It's a host of contradictions, quietly but assertively Asian in a ^ ^ way, intimate but open, convivial but private. Walk into YakiniQ Cafe at any given time and literally every customer looks happy. It may not be the cheapest or even the best, but this rabbit-hole has me entertaining a different curiosity each time, and that alone is worth something.", "author": "Nuri K."}

A subtle lemon icing which had a nice balance between sweet and tart topped it off nicely.  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered their hot apple cider and a slice of apple pie.  I sampled both items, and boy, it was apple goodness!  The cider is delicious and the crust on the apple pie was buttery and baked to the right texture and crispness.  \n\nEverything else also looked so tempting, so I'm planning on coming back again and again!

It's decently quiet, has a variety of drinks and food, plenty of outlets, and free wifi.\n\nThere are lots of places to sit with many different types of tables and chairs.

There are also board games if you want to sit and hang out with friends.\n\nThe pastries are okay. Normal cafe stuff, I'm assuming made elsewhere. I also got their famous sweet potato latte. It was just OK, I would have preferred it to be a little smoother, didn't like the little nubs of potato floating around. Also could've used some spice or sweetness or something.

I assumed so many people have heard of this cafe since every seats and tables were occupied. Anyway, there were a wide array of pastries, cookies, and pies at the table; french macaroons, princess cakes, and tiramisus in the display fridge; and a whole wall menu full of drinks and other snacks for us to order.

If you plan to sit in the cafe, they'll serve your lattes in a bowl-like cup without a handle. I drank my latte as if I was drinking soup from a bowl without spoons.\n\nBoth my friend and I enjoyed the iced jujube tea. The cashier recommended us to order it iced since it was more refreshing that way. It's a bit too sweet, but with the ice in the drink, you could possibly let it melt a bit to blend in with the drink itself.\n\nFinally, we did get a couch/sofa/loveseat to ourselves. They had a table where people placed down their business cards. A scrapbook was there for us customers to draw/doodle/write anything in our minds.

There's also free wifi at this place, which makes it the ideal studying spot for me, with the exception of... \n\nPricing:  The pricing is a bit much for what they offer. For a slice of cake it's $7.50-$8 bucks and for drinks this really ranges.  The cakes that I've had thus far have been delicious though, but I just feel like its a little much for a SLICE of cake? Oh wells, its worth it for the ambiance.\n\nOutlets: This is the main reason why I need to drop a star.  The last two times that I've been here there have been no seats available on the right side where there are outlets.  There are also outlets on the left side with the bigger tables, however, the cafe blocked them ALL out. Why would they do this? I don't know, but I don't like it and I find it a bit inconvienent that they have available seating that can be filled with customers, but they are not because they blocked out all the outlets.  \n\nThis was perhaps really frustrating after driving out to the city to try and do some work and looking for parking.  Thank goodness I didn't order food before checking the availability of outlets first.\n\nOverall, I love this place, it's cute and the cakes are good too, but I wish that there were more outlets :( I'll come again crossing my fingers outlets will be opened up.\n\n\nPS.  they are suppose to be home of the sweet potate latte, I got this, but it was terrible :( stick with something more normal!", "author": "Suzie B."}

The first sip tasted very, very sweet, but it also tasted just like jujube. It reminded me a bit of drinking sweet syrup, but after awhile we grew accustomed to it (or maybe the ice just melted and diluted the taste a bit).\n\nDidn't get a chance to try any of the desserts as most of them seemed a bit expensive (around $7 to $10 for a small cake) for our budget.

A huge welcome when you're stuck in the Starbucks routine.\n\nWhen you walk inside, one of the first things you'll notice are the unique accents, like a small tree or mismatched chairs or a branch (tastefully placed, of course). Koreans seem to have a real knack for designing pretty places. \n\nIt's easy to spend a few hours in here getting lost in a good book or likewise, in the world of Facebook and Gmail. The nice part is you can get a perfectly crusty quiche lorraine or a frothy sweet potato latte to accompany you in whatever task you're taking on.\n\nI found the owner and her employees to be extremely hospitable and friendly. They also let us use the space for one of the SF Int'l Asian American Film Fest workshops, which meant we completely uprooted the feng shui of their furniture layout for a few hours. No matter. They were gracious about and helped us rearrange everything afterwards.\n\nRemember to bring cash when you visit, unless you plan on spending more than $10! Free wifi too.", "author": "liz c."}

You can even have a study group of 6 or 8 go there because behind the couch they have a rectangular dinner table for larger parties or as I said, study groups.'\n\nThey have a decent variety of drinks, deserts, baked pastries and etc. I especially like their Chai latte iced or hot.

All of their pastries are on display and look tasty, and just slightly more expensive than you'd hope, but it's fun to hang out for a while so it's worth the price. \n\nThe only thing we ordered was the green tea shave ice. It is a pile of shaved ice with simple syrup that you can't really taste, a scoop of green tea ice cream, azuki beans, and canned fruit salad. The ice was relatively coarse, not fine and fluffy, so by the time you're halfway through eating it, it has melted to form larger lumps and resembles crushed ice rather than shaved ice. The green tea ice cream is great. The beans are also decent. The fruit salad is weird but seems to be a common feature in Asian shave ice. When I ordered, I asked if they could leave the fruit off and the cashier looked at me funny, so I decided to try it. Not terrible but it would be better without the fruit.", "author": "Kelly B."}

They work to keep the place clean and to bring out your orders promptly. Some people might say that there is nothing special about this place and that they do not have their own specialties in coffee, or bakeries, so they do not deserve any special remarks. That might be true in some sense, but think again, they do everything that a cafe should do and does it better.

It took almost 15 minutes for us to get our drinks and food (food was cake/cookies, so it's not like they had to bake anything before it got to us - they pulled it out of the case and then waited til our drinks were ready to serve it). \n\nWhen the drinks were done, we had to go BEHIND the counter to pick them up, which struck me as really weird/not so hygenic. I'm a former barista (over 4 years), and I found that to be a turn off.\n\nThe seating situation here sucked - all of the large, four person tables were taken up by students who had ALL of their stuff all over the tables. As a group of 3, we had to wait like vultures to grab a seat at the large couch in the middle of the cafe. This may have been because the Cherry Blossom festival was that day - so I can't accurately tell if this is par for the course or not. \n\nThe people who sat there before us did not bus their own table, nor did anyone else we saw while we were there. The staff didn't seem to notice, or care - they were not very busy behind the bar. I notice this stuff as it used to be a major job task when I was a coffee girl. \n\nThe food and drinks were pretty pricey - I don't know if that's typical for cafes in San Francisco or not, so I can't really award or take away points for that. I liked my strawberry italian soda, my compatriots didn't like their green tea lattes very much. The tiramisu was too heavy and was soaked in way too much rum (I guess that's not a complaint for some people? hehe).\n\nOn the upside, their iced drinks are served in GIANT glasses - very cute. They don't serve royal milk tea here, which seems bizarre for an Asian cafe. \n\nThe cafe shares a bathroom with a Korean bbq restaurant, and it was kind of dingy. Also no paper towels, so we had to raid the men's bathroom for some.

We've been here a few times where a full cafe had to be kicked out at closing time.\nI'm not a macaron expert but theirs are not overly sweet with good chewiness, also their tiramisu is pretty rich and delicious. I thought their pastries and desserts were quite good quality.\nIt is annoying when singles with their laptops take over a full table for hours, and I can understand from the business owner's perspective how that turns away other customers on busy nights. Maybe they could have a rule that the big table in the middle is for laptop users, so it would force these lonely hearts to have chance encounters with eachother, instead of sitting by themselves at a table each?

Latte implies coffee or espresso served with steamed milk. This is why I was surprised to find the sweet potato latte without a taste of coffee, espresso, or caffeine. Tasty drink for a coffee alternative. There was definite taste of sweet potato. I did see the barista scoop in chunks of real sweet potato into the drink. This is not sweet like syrup or sugar. Nice, but I still prefer coffee latte.", "author": "Jenny F."}

I love all the interesting and different chairs. However, the bakery or dessert selection is lacking. While we were enjoying our drinks, a group of 5 people came in and looked at the desserts and simply left without ordering anything. I feel if they actually had some desserts that were special than it would really help their business.\n\nOur iced caramel latte was really good served in a nice tall glass...which was about 3 stars. However, my friend said their hot soy latte was about 2 stars because she couldn't taste the soy or espresso. \n\nSo although the environment is really good, due to the poor dessert selection, the not so good soy latte, and the okay iced latte I would probably rank this place an overall 3 stars.", "author": "Jerod Y."}

I was probably influenced with my current obsession with kdramas, but nonetheless, the space is modern, pleasing, comfortable and clean. There are large tables for work and couches for lounging. \n\nI love how our drinks and desserts were served to us at our table. I had an Americano served in a HUGE cup I could barely wrap my palms around ($2.75). My friends ordered the sweet potato latte, mocha, tiramisu and macrons which I also tried a taste.\n\ntiramisu - I love how the cake is really soaked in espresso. Becareful of the cocoa powder getting onto your papers/laptop if you're multitasking.\n\nmacrons - Maybe I'm used to Paulette's so I thought the macrons here were amateurish. The caps weren't smooth and the flavors aren't intensely developed.\n\nI can't wait to stroll over to this cafe on the weekends and lounge!! I also love the random music selection which plays korean, japanese, american songs.\n\nside note - I was sitting towards the back of the cafe which leads to the restroom in a separated area in the far back. It turns out the restroom area is connected to the restaurant upstairs. Being it was a Friday night, the  upstairs crowd was so noisy that you're able to hear the from inside the cafe.", "author": "Mindy C."}

I was a little disappointed by this fact but not really, since the macarons at Patisserie Phillipe are my favorite in the city.

I went on a Tuesday night and the two girls working there were really friendly and suggested that if I wanted the sweet potato latte with two extra shots then adding a bit of extra simple syrup would make it really good. I loved it so much I went back on Saturday. For some reason, the person working made it and it just didn't taste the same. It tasted burnt and I could hardly taste the sweet potato this time. I'll probably try again, but I can't promise that I'll get it again if it's a fail again. I hope though, that it's good because the first one I had was really good.

Not cool.  3.5 stars.**\n\nPeaceful ambiance, delicious desserts, spacious, kind service, and free wifi--great establishment I will continue to support.\n\nMy friend and I came here on a Saturday afternoon to hit the books.  There were definitely periods where the noise level became higher than ideal, but it is open to the public and was a Saturday.  Nonetheless, I am proud to say I completed a good chunk of work that day and the food we ordered kept me adequately energized.  We had regular hot tea, coffee, Banh Mee, and 4 macaroons (mango, passion fruit, coconut, and blackberry).  The first two kinds of macaroons were good, not great.  The latter two, very tasty without being too sweet.  The Banh Mee contained Thai chicken satay, coleslaw, Dijon, and mayo with a side salad.  It was good, but certainly not $9 and change good...could've gotten 2.5 Saigon sandwiches, but I was hungry and didn't want to leave yet.  The \"coleslaw\" was just fresh cabbage and the chicken was not as flavorful as I'd expected, seeing as Thai food has lots of spices and any satay has a smokey flavor.\n\nThat leads me to my next point--bang for your buck.  Unfortunately, for the more substantial food items, there was no bang to be found.  Maybe a \"pew-pew,\" but don't expect to be blown away.  My friend and I conjectured that their high prices probably make up for the myriad of chair styles they have.

Only complaint that the texture wasn't too smooth.\n\nAlso had cute desserts, too many to choose from! \n\nMake sure to bring cash, as you can only use your card if you spend over $10. I would definitely plan on going regularly if I lived close enough \n\nOne awkward moment: they called me from my table to pick up the glass tea pot and two tea cups (which normally is fine with me, although it was a little difficult without a platter), but the couple next to us got it served to them.....guess I didn't tip enough?", "author": "Maiyer V."}

Seriously found this on yelp and I go to japantown a lot.  Usually filled with people but not overly crowded. Great to sit with your laptop or I've seen college kids doing group work or people hanging out. Oh and their macaroons are pretty good esp the earl grey although I keep getting my favorite passion fruit. I like that they usually have open tables also.", "author": "SF Diner A."}

I haven't tried their food, but everything behind display looks really good. The coffee is not too strong, but looks great in its proper cup and setting. The music in the background sometimes repeats but that's because I've been sitting there for a while. Nobody hurries you to leave. It's not too crowded, but you won't be there by yourself because there is a constant revolving foot traffic. \n\nOverall, the cafe is really cute. Everyone should go and vist at least once! Try the Sweet Potato Latte. Pretty interesting!", "author": "Soy Sugar Y."}

They had 45 minutes before closing and the cashier said, they don't make it so close to closing. Really? So I said forget it but the two people w/ me wanted to try their apple pie. It was ok. But after 10 minutes of sitting there waiting for them to warm up the pie, the cashier said if I still wanted the shaved ice, the owner said ok but he'll put it in a togo cup. Ok, half an hour before closing and you don't think I can finish a container of shaved ice. Having experienced another place that did a to go shaved ice where they didn't give me a lot of ice cause they had to fit it in a coffee cup, I declined. Then they tried to convince me to do it. I refused. Never coming back here again. I came here specifically for their shaved ice because it was after dinner and I was craving it. I yelped it, saw the good reviews but after they way I was treated, I'm never coming back.", "author": "Lizzie B."}

The 2 people up front were kind and down-to-earth. It felt local, chill, and relaxing. The only gripe, which is not their fault, is the parking.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-29", "description": "This is absolutely my favorite place in the city to come for a coffee or a tea to relax, do some work or read. It's a very spacious coffee shop that offers a wide range of goodies and espresso drinks. Im mainly a tea drinker and they offer a wide range. Its not a tea house like Samovar, so don't  expect fancy teas. Nonetheless, the choices they offer are good. The deserts are also quite something...visually impressive and mouth watering. The staff is also very friendly and remember you by name. There are also board games to play with your friends or books that you can choose from in the back wall. One of the delights is the eclectic music that plays in the background. One minute you can be listening to old music from the 40s and then suddenly be surprised with cool chill trance. Overall, the ambience and vibe is quite energetic and stimulating, yet mellow. And it's in the heart of Japantown  where you can then do a bit of shopping or go eat at one of the many yummy restaurants or watch a film at the Kabuki theater or the cool and trendy Film Society.", "author": "Hope C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-14", "description": "I've tried their overpriced tiny desserts, and since I'm picky about good stuff, I tend to stick to coffee when I'm there, as in regular coffee. If the stuff there made your eyes close, and made your heart skip a beat, then I'd give a list of stuff that you had to try, but I don't have a list. The last fancy drink I tried, was their root beer float which I had to stop midway. They should probably stick to A & W, and not be so fancy. I'm not sure what there deal is with sweet potato, but it's not a hot commodity like chicken feet to sell, and I don't dig finding anything gritty in my lattes.  It's a cool place to chill and unwind from a long day of hanging out in Japan Town, or a great meeting spot to try to figure out what else to do. While others may choose this spot to study, or surf the net, I like to pick up and play their Scrabble and Jenga games, occasionally bringing my own deck of UNO cards. I give it three stars because it's quite cozy, and there's a lot of places to sit and hangout, occasionally I'll give in to their desserts, sometimes it rocks.", "author": "Bonene G."}

The nice tables and comfortable looking couch seating looked very inviting, and immediately I felt glad to be inside.  I attended a birthday party here, and we tried out some of the nice choice of cafe drinks that matched well with the the terrific assortment of quality desserts.  In addition to the miniature fruit tarts,  napoleon type cakes, cookies, and great french style Laduree macaroons, this cafe also had an some interesting Asian style desserts too like paat bing soo (fruit, with sweet red beans, ice cream and shaved ice). Even the shaved ice was very high quality in that the shaving was very fine and made eating this dessert great toppings very enjoyable.  I also noticed that they had a great sound system for light music, and I'd definitely think of this place to take a break from all the hectic activity in SF and have a nice refreshing drink.  I appreciated that there was thought put into this cafe to include free Wi-Fi and would definitely hang out here again with my iphone.", "author": "Jean S."}
