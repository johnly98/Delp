The cashew chicken had plenty of broccoli, zucchini, and other vegetables scattered throughout. The mongolian beef was probably my least favorite - the beef was flavored all right with pepper, but the meat itself was not the best quality. The mu shu pork was quite nice with a good mix of julienned vegetables. The vegetable eggrolls arrived still surprisingly crisp, and the crab rangoon was more flavorful than I would have expected due to chives in the mix.

So, basically, all this time I've been ordering once from here, once from there, etc. If only Hunan Homes delivered...that would have solved my problem a long time ago.\n\nBut, recently, my BFF started raving about Yum Yum Hunan. I checked out my fellow Yelpers' reviews and Friday evening I placed an order for:\n\nOrange beef\nWalnut prawns\nCream cheese crab wontons\nRice for two (to fool the delivery guy into thinking that all this food wasn't just for ME, which, of course, it was)\n\nSurprise, surprise! When you order two entrees, you get a free FULL-SIZED order of fried rice or chow mein. Nice! Barbecued pork chow mein for me, please.\n\nThe food arrived, nice and hot, in about 30 minutes. The wontons blew me away...they were simply amazing. Cream cheese, scallions and real crab enveloped in a crispy fried wonton skin.\n\nThe chow mein was simple and satisfying.\n\nThe orange beef wasn't as good as Hunan Homes', but I liked that the breading wasn't too thick and that the chiles were ground up and distributed throughout the dish rather than thrown in whole.\n\nThe walnut prawns, again, weren't as good as Hunan Homes', but I would order them again. They give you a baker's dozen, by the way.\n\nI expected the prawns to come on the usual bed of shredded lettuce, but the beef was served that way as well, which I don't care for because it reheats horribly. Next time I'll ask them to leave out the lettuce on everything so that I don't have to pick it off.\n\nSo, all told, for about $30 including tip, I got almost 5 meals. Yum Yum, indeed, and economical! Friendly service too.\n\nYum Yum is going on the speed-dial for sure!\n\nP.S. I swear I didn't eat all 5 of those meals in one night.", "author": "Valeria R."}

However, that last forty minutes or so (which I'll get to) I was here definitely rubbed me the wrong way, and as a result I certainly won't dine in at Yum Yum again. \n\nLike I said, the food at this place is good. I came here for dinner with two other people on a Sunday & the place was pretty empty. We started with the combination platter which included veggie egg rolls, pork pot stickers, crab rag-goon, and fried shrimp (two pieces of each). Everything was good, but a little greasy. For the main course I got the sizzling basil beef, which was very good (my dining companions had general Tsao's chicken & meatless kung pao, which I didn't taste). \n\nThe service was a little spotty, but nothing major to complain about (well, for now...keep reading the review though) & the prices were fine. I don't live too far from this place and they're always leaving delivery menus on my door. I noticed when I was eating here a big chunk of there business seems to be delivery/take-out. \n\nSooo...here's where we had an issue: \n\nWhen our bill came one of our dining companion's ordered a bowl of won-ton soup to-go, to take to her boyfriend. Now the three of us were in a chipper mood, not necessarily in any kind of hurry, and enjoying playing catch-up, but after twenty minutes with no soup we figured something was up. My friend who ordered the soup got up and said something to our waitress. She then heard the waitress arguing with a chef, turn to my friend and said it will just be a couple more minutes (remember we're talking SOUP here...I think from the time we sat down looked over our menu, ordered, ate our appetizer, and then had main courses brought to our table was only about 20-25 min.) \n\nOver about ANOTHER twenty minute period of time, our waitress came by our table a couple of times to say our order will be right up and that they were very busy, pointing to the number of delivery orders that were being loaded into a car outside. \n\nFinally, a woman came into the restaurant holding a bag with a bowl of soup in it and we overheard her saying that this wasn't her order. We just laughed and figured she probably got our order. Sure enough, the waitress brought the soup right over to us and said our order was ready (I don't think she even realized that we witnessed the woman returning the soup). \n\nWe could have made a fuss, but we just wanted to get out of there at this point. The girl who ordered the soup dropped me and our other friend off at home, and ten minutes later we get a phone call form her saying they had given her the wrong order (the gave her hot and sour soup instead of won-ton).  \n\nI hate to give negative reviews, especially when I actually LIKED the food here and would consider doing delivery from this place (although the mixed up order even makes me skeptical of that), but the combination of a 40+ minute wait for the soup, getting the wrong order, and just giving us an order to-go that someone else had returned is just too much to overlook...", "author": "George A."}

Had a pile of take out menus and finally decided on Chinese... then narrowed it down to Yum Yum Hunan.  I'm so happy with my choice!!\n\nI ordered Pork Chow Fun and it was so good!!! Barbecued pork was amazingggg, but it was SLIGHTLY dry.  But it was still SOOO goodddd.  Ahhh. Not greasy at all!! =DD\n\nThe mongolian beef there is spicy for me, but it was still very good.  Usually my boyfriend picks out all of the meat and leaves all the veggies, but he actually started EATING the veggies cause of the sauce! It was amazing.  Then we had the brilliant idea of mixing the sauce with my chow fun to give it a little bit more flavor and I was so happy!!! Yummmmm.  Now I just need to find the suitable replacement in San DIego.... SO hard to find one that's reasonable in price and wonderful in taste =(.\n\nThe only thing that sucked was that it took like an hour to get it delivered, but I'm not sure what standard delivery time, so that was the only downside.\n\nBut it was SO worth the wait. I want more!!!", "author": "Bella C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-12", "description": "I really love Divisadero; the atmosphere, the stores, the people... everything about it and around it reads \"anti-big money, mom and pop neighborhood.\" I'm not hinting that there's an air of class about this neighborhood, but it is definitely more unique and delightful than most, thus you can imagine my surprise when I found out there was a Chinese restaurant on this block.\n\nWhen you think of Chinese restaurants in America you usually think of places that serve up a quick fix of left-over-for-the-next-meal-bound pan-asian cuisine, but Yum Yum Hunan (despite their hilariously cheesy sounding name,) like the street and neighborhood in which it's situated, is more unique and delightful than most.\n\nNow from past experience, there are only two types of Chinese restaurants that I usually find in semi-gentrified areas: those that are sort of shabby looking inside, serve horribly americanized chinese food for bargain prices; and those that are really well-decorated inside, serve horribly americanized \"fusion\" chinese food for ridiculous prices. Well guess what? YYH is neither of these.\n\nMy roommate and I came here for a late dinner and looking at the interior from the outside we immediately thought this place was the latter of the aforementioned \"chinese restaurant stereotypes,\" but since we were pretty hungry we decided to sit down anyway. We were misinformed, probably due to lack of research, and thought that ordering any two entrees would entitle us to free fried rice or chow mein--this option is apparently only available when you order delivery/take out.\n\nAfter about five minutes of scanning the menu we ordered General Tsao's Chicken and Spicy Garlic Eggplant. The General Tsao's Chicken was pretty standard, despite the fact that the chicken wasn't as spicy we'd hoped it'd be despite asking the waitress to make it extra spicy. But the real surprise/treat of the night was the Spicy Garlic Eggplant; usually when you order this dish at a Chinese restaurant it's usually bland and you don't really taste \"garlic\" or \"spicy,\" but YYH's was full of flavor and the best part: their spicy garlic eggplant comes with shrimp, calamari and other assorted SEAFOOD! The best I've ever gotten with my spicy garlic eggplant in the past was maybe some shredded pork, but YYH serves theirs with a delicious mix of assorted seafood, and they even top it off with some basil for an extra depth of flavor.\n\nOur bill for two entrees and rice came out to about 21 dollars which I thought was very sensibly priced for the amount/quality of food we were given--next time I will definitely order by phone and get my chow mein.", "author": "Scott S."}

The dishes - particularly the garlic pork, were chock full of fresh veggies, while still having plentiful amounts of meat,  +1. And the last +1 goes to the taste and overall quality. The Hong Kong noodles were slightly crispy, with a bit of sauce getting them to just the right consistency. Everything tasted great, and the quantities were large enough to stock up the fridge for some lunch time action tomorrow. \n\nYum Yum Hunan is my new go-to for delivery in the Western Addition.

All in all the food is pretty tasty. \n\nOnly complaint: One night, my aunt and I decided to place our order for pick up since they were 15 mins away from closing. My great aunt walked in ahead of me and told them how much she loved their food and how she's been coming for years and they completely ignored her comment and asked how they could help me since I walked in a little after her. I waited a minute to see if he would comment back to her but he didn't he just asked how he could help me. I told him I had an order for pick-up and as he turns to get it, my aunt asked for a cup of water (she was pretty winded by the walk there) and he glances at her then completely ignores her again. It wasn't until I asked again for her that he got the water for her... From the sink, at that!

Tonight, we placed an order at 9:10pm, the restaurant closes at 10pm. We received the order confirmation, meaning they got it. We were quoted an arrival time 10:02pm. Well, 10:35 rolls around and I try calling the restaurant to see where our order is, but they're closed. So, I call Grubhub and they contact the owner who gives them the driver's #. They then call the driver, but he won't answer. I absolutely hope nothing bad happened to him on his way, but if that's the case, I would gladly retract this review. If he however just decided to head home or wherever instead of making his final delivery, then they've lost a loyal customer. It's now 11:10pm, no food, and we just ordered pizza instead.", "author": "Shawn K."}

The phone service is the best that I have ever called when ordering delivery of any kind of food, he answered my questions nicely and didn't put me on hold or rush me. I even had a short conversation with him about how they recently moved from Valencia St. It was so obvious he had a smile in his voice. Because I have never been there before he said he will put a menu in my bag. Their new divisadero location was the home to my old Chinese delivery place. \n\nAfter I ordered our dinner he asked if I wanted free fried rice because we ordered 2 entrees. I was so surprised because usually when you are able to get something free you have to ask them for it by saying you have a coupon or tell them you see it on the menu. \n\nI placed my order at 6:48pm and it arrived at 7:00pm. Can you believe that, 12 minutes! I am not even lying because I knew that I would be giving them a yelp review while I was talking on the phone with him because he was so nice. I wanted my review to have all the information that mattered so I wrote down the times. Mind you, I live 7 blocks from this place so I can't guarantee you that you will be getting your order that fast. It could have also been that their delivery guy was there at the exact time my food was ready. However, I will say that the Chinese restaurant that used to be at this location never delivered my food this fast. \n\nEven though I am one fourth Chinese, my pallet for Chinese delivery food is pretty poor; so I have to say that the food quality is as good as any Chinese delivery I have ever had; possibly better because their Mongolian beef actually has lots of beef, unlike some places I have ordered from where there is more onion than anything else.

Portions are great for the price and quality, I often have enough to take home and make another meal from it. I've always gotten a fair ratio of meat to veggies in the entrees I've ordered. The rice has always been soft and just the right amount of moist, never undercooked nor too dry. The veggies in the dishes have always been perfectly stir fried it or however they do it back there in the kitchen. Nice and crisp, but piping hot and tender. I am partial to their prawn/shrimp dishes, they do them very well. Their hot and sour soup has tons of sea and land veggies, tofu, egg? and has a good flavor, nothing fighting too much to overpower anything else, rather balanced. The seaweed tastes great. \n\nTakeout is always fast, hot. \nI haven't experienced their delivery as I live so close. \nWhen I order takeout they invite me to sit. They don't offer tea or soup unless you eat in because takeout doesn't take that long! They are very fast. \nWhen eating in you are brought tea and soup. The tea is nice and feels very relaxing, but maybe that's just the atmosphere. Although sometimes the teenagers or younger adults that work their are loud, they are just talking and laughing amongst themselves, and seem to be happy....I don't mind chatter while I'm eating. \nThey've forgotten to bring water a few times but when I went to the counter and asked it was no problem at all for the girl to give me two glasses. She was very nice. \nI love this place.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

For the past month and a half, I have ordered from this Chinese restaurant every Sunday at exactly 11AM (when they start delivery). And no, I'm not some fat, greasy slob. I am young, I am fit, and I like to think that I know good food.\n\nMy gf and I always share General Tsao's Chicken, 1 brown rice, and 1 veggie potstickers. Once we also ordered Orange Fake Meat Chicken (or whatever more appealing name they have for it) and got a free fried rice, and they were good enough to stuff our faces with until we thought we were going to explode, but it was way way way too much food for the two of us.\n\nSo let's break it down.\nGeneral Tsao's: Arrives hot, doesn't leave grease marks on the packaging. Broccoli has been well cooked every time, except once when it was a bit overdone, but still pretty good. Also, tasty.\nBrown rice: Too often restaurant undercook brown rice thinking it cooks like white rice. Yum Yum gets it right. Simply steamed.\nVeggie Potstickers: Like the others, comes hot, tastes fresh. Good by themselves, without any extra sauce. Although I do like to rub the last one in the General Tsao's sauce once the take-out thing is empty.\nSpeed: 20-40 minutes. Again, I order when they just start delivery, so there's no back-up from a bunch of other people ordering unless they're just like me.\nService: Always nice on the phone, never had to be on hold. The delivery guy is always nice, and always has change.\nPrice: With tip, I think we pay $19 for this meal for two. Not bad, eh?\n\nDon't listen to the haters: this place is definitely worth the cash you just found in that coat you haven't worn for months.", "author": "Shaina 'Occasionally Rahn' K."}

The guy who answers the phone is what I would want my grandfather to be like if I had a Chinese grandpa.  He's extremely helpful and tries his best to accommodate your every whim.  Eg: One day I really wanted Jasmine tea with my food and I was ballsy enough to ask if they would deliver tea.  He apologized that they didn't have a takeout tea container so he packed me a (free) bag full of amazing Jasmine tea bags so that I could make my own.  How sweet - and totally NOT neccessary!  Most Chinese restaurants would just say \"no\" but he made an attempt to make his customer happy.  That's the way to do business people... Outstanding.\n\n2.  Delivery is fast.  Ok sometimes it really is 30-45 minutes like they say, but I've gotten used to hearing that and suddenly having the Yum Yum guy at my door 15 minutes later.  How does he DO that?!!\n\n3.  FREE Chicken Chow Mein with every order of two entrees.  Ok so I totally don't need the third entree, and I'm probably fatter because of this deal, but show me the person who can say no to free Yum Yum Chicken Chow Mein and I'll show you a person with no soul.\n\nOk so maybe I've eaten enough Yum Yum that I'm starting to resemble an over-stuffed egg roll, but I don't care.

The delivery time was standard, about 40 minutes. The food came warm which is always a plus in my book.\n\nFOOD:\nGreen onion pancake: SKIP! This dish is definitely not worth the caloric intake nor is it worth your money. They only put the tasty green onion mixture in the middle of the pancake and it only covered approximately 25% of the pancake innards. Therefore, when they fry it up and serve it to you, you eat mostly fried batter without the yummy insides.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken Wings: Not bad. I am a huge chicken wing enthusiast, especially salt and pepper wings, so I may be a bit critical when it comes to this dish. I've definitely had much tastier salt and pepper wings, but it isn't the worst I've had. It's fairly average and I would order it again if ordering from this place.\n\nChicken Chow Fun: Meh. Honestly, I don't think there was enough soy or sauce on it because the noodles were not brown but a tan color, which is an indication that there isn't enough soy. When tasting, it was a bit bland for what the dish could have been. I would skip this dish or maybe try the beef chow fun next time.\n\nBok Choy and Shiitake mushrooms: It's hard to ruin this dish so this dish gets my thumbs up especially if you're trying to eat healthy.\n\nWor Won Ton Soup: The broth was a bit plain and everything in it was just meh. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. \n\n\nIn conclusion: just a \"meh\" restaurant. If I am craving Chinese, I might order from here again but I'd probably be more inclined to trying another place just because their food is just average. I'm not really sure why they have such a high rating. Is it the neighborhood they are in?

We got the salt & pepper shrimp, veggie delight, salt & pepper pork chops, walnut shrimp, and the free veggie chow mein. \n\nI really had high hopes for this place especially since it was a good deal ($40 for all the food) and it seems like everyone else has had a good experience. However, the food we received was sub-par. The salt & pepper shrimp was terrible--actually nothing like I've ever had before; same with the salt and pepper pork. Maybe it's because we got delivery or maybe because a lot of bai ren partake in this place so they think they can skimp on the quality, but either way it was unsatisfying.\n\nThe service was nice, but I don't know if I would try this place again :(", "author": "Angela L."}

High quality chicken and beef, amazing flavors and no soggy veggies! And get this...they give a FREE side of chow main or fried rice with two entrees, and the side is the size of a whole dish, and its delicious. \n\nThey even have \"meatless\" options for your lovely vegan and veggie freinds. Yay! \n\nWe were so pleased and now Yum Yum's menu is on the fridge and all the MILLION others that get put on our front door handle with a rubber band are goin in the T-R-A-S-H.

Then he said he was craving chinese food for some reason, so we looked on yelp and made our way to Yum Yum. Upon entering, there was only one other lady eating there and I got a little worried. However, the place was clean and more spacious than it seemed from the numerous times I've passed by. \n\nWe sat down and spotted a section with lunch deals on the menu, ranging from $6-8 each. We ordered a sesame chicken and a eggplant, shrimp and garlic dish. Both were great deals, but the eggplant, shrimp and garlic dish was definitely better. I was surprised at how authentic it was. Before the dishes come out, they give you a cup of soup which is good too. Also, did I mention how much rice they give you??? I love rice and was still having a hard time finishing all of it. On each plate, they also give you a few salty chips on the side. All in all, Yum Yum's lunch deals were cheap and satisfying.", "author": "Angela S."}

This happens to me every time I eat here, this place is my crack. I would rather put their General Tsao's meatless chicken in a glass pipe and smoke it til I third degree burn myself like I'm Richard Pryor in the 80s than eat at any other middle of the road Chinese place in the city. Most people don't have such a boner for this place as I do but that's because they probably aren't vegetarians who love meatless meat like I do. This brings their probably 4.5 to a 5 in my book, and everyone should try the meatless meat because eating dead animal carcasses makes you an asshole! JK dudes, before someone gets the idea that all vegetarians are militant pro-PETA types, we are so fuck you!\n\nThis place is never packed, possibly due to the fact that this place has quick delivery of large quantities of food almost custom made for secret-eating fatty binges. Seriously, get take out from here and they will immediately deliver your fix to you and even hook up a soy sauce IV drip to your arm!* You can find a table as soon as you walk in and sit wherever you'd like, preferably near the small tv they have hooked up near the ceiling so you have something to pretend to be interested in in case you come with someone you absolutely hate, or someone you are simply using as a cover so you don't have to eat alone in public like a loser. The waitresses are nice and greet you with a free pot of tea and say \"Hi enjoy tea please.\" To me that just screams authentic Chinese restaurant. They take your order and within 5 minutes bring you plate fulls of fresh vegetables and awesome food that I want to eat right now! The waitresses rarely bug you, like they'll never ask you how the food is when your mouth is full because they don't give a shit and that's the way I like it! They are, however, easy to flag down in case you have a problem or need something they didn't bring (but you won't, it's impossible to be an asshole customer here, even for you!). You will then get a fortune cookie that almost always is not funnier by adding \"in bed!\" to the end.\n\n*No they won't, calm down Fatty (aka me).", "author": "Joe T."}

Chicken was rubbery chunks of dark meat - my fault for not specifying/asking if i could get white meat in my starving rage when ordering.

I clicked \"Find Reviewes\" to identify any restaurant that would deliver me a bowl of soup at 11:12 in the morning. \n\nYum Yum Hunan, that is. They, together with Yelp's sophisticated search functions, saved my life this Saturday. Within half an hour, 20lbs of warm Chinese food was delivered to my apartment before noon. ----Priceless. \n\nI almost wept sucking down the warm seaweed soup. Seriously. As for the food quality - I mean, this is your typical delivery Chinese food, and it tasted like one. If I were to rate this place solely based on the food quality, it would have gotten a lower rating. But the point here is, they accomodate your very desperate and selfish needs for a very reasonable price. For those who place more importance on quantity over quality, this place will deliver. They gave me a free Chow Main. As I said earlier, the bag weighted almost 20 lbs...that's a lot of food for about $30. The service is courteous and efficient. \n\nBookmark now.

Always liberal on available seating, I hope their deliveries are enough to support this restaurant; it would be a foul shame on us as residents to let it wither.\n\nAnyway, the food is what counts, and after 4 visits, I have never left hungry, disappointed, nor broke. So many selections offer meatless versions of traditionally meat-centric dishes that carnivores and herbivores can be fed in about equal measure.

It has some lovely things that I would never have ordered were it not for the reviews on this site, and then it had some things that I craved which were also mentioned on this site.  Let's start off with the good news, shall we?\n\nCrab Rangoon - 5 stars, delicious, star shaped generous filling.  I would never have order this except one of the reviews here talked about it and I am very very glad I did.  It's a good execution of Crab Rangoon even if it may be crab-less.\n\nSalt and Pepper Chicken Wings Entree - 5 Stars.  Came on a bed of shredded lettuce with jalapeno, peppers, some other stuff.  Batter was tasty and seasoned.  A bit heavy, but that's like saying the cone shape of carrots detracts from the taste.  \n\nMa Po ToFu - 3 stars.  Ths sauce was not undelicious, and the flavor was not offensive.  My preferance is for it to be made with soft tofu whereas this was made with medium or firm.\n\nBuddha's Delight Vegetable Clay Pot - 3 stars.  The taste was rather fresh.  I enjoyed the thin glass noodles at the bottom and the pleasing array of veg, wood ear mushroom, and tofu.  Again, I would have like soft tofu, not medium or firm.  \n\nPork Chow Mein - 5 stars because it was FREE!!  I ordered so much food that my tummy is groaning right now.  Maybe tomorrow after the laxative eat works its magic, I'll have some.  But for now, Chinese food:1, Christina:0.\n\nLet's talk about the lovely young man who delivered it.  He was so considerate and concerned that my apartment door would close and lock me out (it does and did), he voiced his concern.  Ah.  What a nice young man.\n\nFinal thoughts: I've come to the conclusion that ordering chinese food as a chinese person who does not live in NYC is like eating at a cafeteria (maybe even a public school cafeteria) after having grown up on home cooking, on the farm, grandmother makes her own bread, cooks her own jellies.  I'm not disappointed because that would be like being disappointed that watermelons are not poisonous.  I am merely...enlightened.

In fact, every time I try a new Chinese Food place, I go straight for \"the General\" only to be served soggy lumps of disappointment. Fu Wah deserves mentioning because the General's chicken always came out crispy, with a tangy, spicy sauce that couldn't be beat. The closest I've had is the spicy chicken at San Tungs, but my other favorite is Yum Yum. Here, it comes in the form of Sesame Chicken, but that's just fine. The sauce isn't the same (it's good), but the chicken is crispy, and that seems to be the challenge.

The non-seafood stuff averages $8. Lunch specials are $6, not a bad hook.\n\nDinner order:\nWor Won Ton soup - won tons were so-so, lots of veggies, could use more meat & shrimp, broth was awesome!\n\nSauteed veggies with salmon - salmon cut into small hunks, wked with various veggies, onions, celery, zucchini, snow peas. Sauce was basically black bean, very flavorful, but just enough to coat the veggies & fish... leaving your helping of rice on its own.\n\nSeafood Mix with Veggies: Scallops & Shrimp, sauteed with water chestnuts, black mushrooms, snow peas, others, in a sparse, bland, translucent sauce. Pass the soy sauce & hot oil.\n\nSalted Spicey Spareribs: Thinly sliced pork chop pieces lightly coated with flour & fried. Served with sliced hot peppers and salted. Tasted excellent, but just not very generous.\n\nThe food is very good. The service is very good and friendly, that's a big plus. You can't mess with $6 lunch specials. They deliver in the morning.

I live nearby and had been curious to try this restaurant for a while. \n\nI was seated during the lunch rush. I ordered the lunch special of garlic scallops and broccoli. I was very disappointed by the food. I was almost immediately served some hot and sour soup and a pot of tea. The soup was lukewarm and bland. As for the entree, the portion size was very satisfying: a hearty serving of steamed or fried rice with a small bit of iceberg lettuce salad, a spring roll, and a large portion of the scallops and broccoli. While I felt there was a good amount of scallop in my dish, it was saturated in a cloyingly sweet, heavy sauce and was not garlicky. The spring roll was good but the salad was kind of pointless and dressed in a very sweet dressing that tasted similar to the scallop dish sauce. I wanted lunch not dessert!\n\nThe restaurant was really busy so the server took some time to clear my soup bowl, bring me my entree, and get me the check. \n\nGiven the generally positive reviews for Yum Yum, I feel like I should give this place another chance.

I just don't like the hot & sour soup they serve, it is tasteless!!! it seems they just added water, soy sauce and vinegar!", "author": "Steve S."}

I couldn't finish the dishes that I ordered because they were slimy, hardly edible concoctions.  I will admit that the food was to go, but I live close enough that the time from pan to fork could not possibly explain away the quality of the food.  This was also a few month ago, so I guess they could have since turned it around, but I doubt it.\n\nThe restaurant is nearly always empty and the smells that permeate the store front never beckon me in to give it another try.  I couldn't even tell you what I ordered off the menu even though I can vividly remember the dish in front of me.  The place is either a front or they rely almost entirely on take-out and delivery business.\n\nOverall, you're better off saving yourself some money and disappointment by going home and having a PB&J instead of eating here.  The restaurant itself is a nice and simple decor, if they could get the food to at least that quality they might get me back, but for not it's a no-go.", "author": "Thomas J."}

I have to say, I was very pleased. First off, this place is clean, bright and friendly. Service was real quick and the staff had a cup of Hot and Sour soup, fresh tea w/pot and water in front of me within a minute of seating. I went for the lunch special which was a great value at $5.50. I decided on the staple of Kung Pao Chicken and w/ fried rice, but you do have a choice of steamed and even brown rice (which is great)! \n\nThe food plate arrived piping hot and extremely quick. Yes, they weren't that busy now at 2:30, but still, very impressive. It was a generous lunch portion and even came with a nice side salad with a light sweet dressing and a free egg roll. Now we are talking. The dish was pleasantly spiced, great sauce (NO MSG) and everything was extremely fresh and the veggies were all properly cooked and retained their natural flavor. I was getting full about 1/2 to 3/4's of the way through the dish and that generally never happens with Chinese lunch specials. However, I couldn't put down the fork. It definitely hit the spot. \n\nI will be going here again for dinner with friends to order more of my favorites and continue to sample the menu. Btw - even the bathroom was extremely clean, well decorated, stocked and nice hand soap :) That is a good sign of the overall attention to detail and cleanliness of a restaurant.", "author": "Eric R."}

The spring roll that was part of my dish was mediocre, pretty much the typical crunch. As for the lunch entree I ordered, thinking this place was SO PACKED during lunch hour I must try it, it was DISGUSTING. The salad is definitely from the large packages from Costco, nothing original and not fresh because it was brown. The brown rice was decent but the Hunan Beef was plastic-tasting, couldn't even cut the large pieces so I chewed and chewed and chewed to get through the piece of beef. After I did that twice, I stopped eating. They start off with a lemon-y tofu soup which is extremely tart and distasteful. Then they are anxious to get your order like 1 minute after they put down the HOT soup. The server did not even bother to place the lunch entree in front of me but semi-half off the table, which was extremely rude for a sit down restaurant where you have to wait in line to be seated.

She came into work yesterday with this box that was just oozing this wonderful aroma.  She opened her box and the food practically exploded onto her desk, like it was trying to escape the box.  Wide-eyed, I wheeled my chair over to her and never making eye contact w/ her but molesting her food w/ my eyes, asked her where she got her food from.  She told me about this place and I was even more impressed that they had brown rice.  She ordered off of their lunch menu and I was really amazed at the amount of food she had for a relatively decent price ($7).  A sweet and sour wonton like soup w/ tofu is included with every lunch.  She gave the soup to me because she knew she wouldn't be able to eat everything.  This soup was so so so good.  I don't even like tofu.  Usually tastes like marinated sponge, but this was really good.  I proceeded to eat her leftovers because I'm a pig like that, and lo and behold, more tofu!  Apparently she got the veggie combo.  Again, the tofu was really really good.  Everything was really well seasoned.  I found myself even drooling over their fried wonton crisps.  I decided to go there today since I was craving it.  I probably only waited 5 minutes for my food to come out.  I ordered the garlic chicken w/ brown rice lunch combo and a side of egg rolls.  Silly me, I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all in one sitting.  I did.  Oh!  I DID bring the soup home....which I promptly inhaled in 2 minutes.

And it made me feel even more uncomfortable when they didn't bring it because by then I wanted some sweet/sour sauce and mustard with my egg roll and I wanted some more chili pepper to add spice to my Mongolian beef which was really good except for a bit to much black pepper. I settled for the sugar and sweet/sour sauce because I didn't want to be a bother but I really wish they would have asked if I needed anything else. I started feeling like I was on some conveyor belt.", "author": "Kalifornia S."}

So, the order was taken and their ferocious wok skills dished out our take out in 5 minutes!  Amazing!

(I've done the research) I was so happy they moved here. Their old location was on Valencia. Unlike Eliza's, they even serve their cheap lunches on weekends! My favorite is the sauteed string beans. Any of their shrimp dishes are tasty too.", "author": "Lisa F."}

I ordered the veggie deluxe which came with broccoli, mushroom, snow peas, and baby corn that were still crispy and fresh, which is a huge surprise considering other take out places.  Also had the crispy deep fried chicken wings, which were amazingly tender.  Best part was the batter was still crispy.  And thank you fellow yelper for posting about the free chow mein with a 2 entree order.  I asked the guy on the phone (who was super friendly) if they still offered this special and he said yes without any hesitation.  The chicken chow mein was so good, I couldn't stop talking about how good it was while I was eating it.  Oh, and the craziest part was the food got to me in 15 minutes!  I had to check my call log to make sure that was right.  I felt like the guy was at my door the second I hung up.  I'm so deliriously happy right now, I wanted to call them up and tell them how good the food was and that they made my night.  So excited I found this place, I'm always wary of chinese delivery, but I'm happy to say I've found my go to chinese spot.  Woot!", "author": "Sophie P."}
