The place itself is small and unassuming; it's full of wall-to-wall plants, a bit dingy, and have a few tables for eat-in customers.  The menu isn't too big but that's probably why the sandwiches are so good.\n\nI stopped by this past weekend for a quick bite; opened the front door and there were already three customers ahead of me.  The interior could use a face-lift and some remodeling.\n\nTo my surprise, there's only one person working there on a Friday evening.  He took the customers' order, rang them up, and made the sandwiches all by himself with an oven no bigger than an Easy Bake oven. \n\nI order the turkey sandwich which includes all the fixings (it comes with lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, etc., unless you specify).  He made the sandwich and place it into this small oven for approximately 2 minutes.  Out pops the sandwich all warm with the French bread crisped to perfection.  I ordered my sandwich to go as I walked towards Embarcadero but my sandwich never made it; it was so good that I couldn't stop eating it!  I couldn't believe my taste buds.\n\nThe sandwich cost $7.95 plus tax.  In my opinion, the sandwich was much tastier than the big chain sub shops.", "author": "Vvn W."}

Yes, the decor is outdated; yes, the interior needs a facelift; but I'm going there for the sandwich and nothing else.

When I looked at the prices, I was shocked, but expected the San Fransisco prices.  \n\nGot their famous Viking Sub, and my god, it was great: salami, pastrami, ham, cheese and there was this seasoning, I think it was just seasoning salt, but it pushed it over the top after they toasted it.\n\nI did NOT expect it to be good, and when I looked at the Yelp ratings I instantly knew this place was a gem that people typically walk past.  It's sad how many tourists probably walk past this place to pay for expensive sub par food elsewhere.  \n\nI can imagine regulars line up here since when I went it was raining and after 2.\n\nAdvice:  keep those sandwiches UNCHANGED.  Maybe swap out the decorations and replace the furniture.  But really, that's not even needed.  Why spend the money on those extras when people most likely just grab and go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "I readily admit that 4 stars may be too high a rating for the actual subway sandwich, but Vikings pulled a supremely effective shock-and-awe attack on my taste buds. And so relative to expectations (even those heightened by the consistently high yelp reviews), this rating is completely justified.\n\nVikings is a small hole-in-the-wall place that has none of the antiseptic average-ness of the big subway chains, nor the pretentious hip-ness of a more niche local one. You enter Vikings and it's no frills: 2 person operation, small seating area, quick counter service, focused menu. So when we ordered the tuna sub and the crab salad sub, I was expecting just to satiate my hunger. Vikings did that and more because the subs were fantastic!\n- Portions were big: a small sub will leave your belly exploding, a large one will be enough to satisfy 2 people).\n- Fillings were generous: Lots of garnishes/veggies are expected given they're good fillers; Vikings made sure to load up on the tuna and crab meat as well.\n- The bread: This was undoubtedly the star of the show, and not in a bad way. When the bread is what you praise about a sandwich, that's usually a back-handed complement and an extremely bad sign. Vikings though uses the bread to differentiate its subs and take them to another level. The bread was toasted perfectly - crispy on the edges with just the right amount of toastiness to not get weighed down and soggy with the sauce/garnishes.\n\nVikings subway sandwiches as a culinary delight - who knew?!", "author": "David Y."}

Simply put, that was one of the best subs I've had in a long time! No doubt I felt like a Viking eating here.\n\nUpon walking into this little shop that sits on the corner of Van Ness and Lombard, I instantly went on a time trip back to the 90's (Adam- who wrote a review as well) said it best. The place is simplistic- you have your basic table setup that you can find at typical delis, San Francisco decor on the walls, and my personal favorite: business cards! You know this place is old school when you have old business cards hung up for advertisement. These are all things that I love because it's not what's mainstream anymore these days. \n\nOn to the food!\n\nIt's simplistic yet delicious. The pastrami is tasty as can be, the vegetables are all fresh, and the size of the sub is awesome! Though everything here may seem like an average place to get an average sub, it's really not. This thing is incredibly yummy. The use of the sesame bun is great, and it's toasted to perfection. Everything really melts in your mouth.\n\nService here is fantastic too. There seem to be two main people who make all the subs (my best guess is husband and wife) and they are friendly. Today was a more packed day for them and they still were putting out subs every few minutes and the line was never held up. \n\nFinal verdict: if you love old school vibes that take you back in time, good service and amazing subs, this place is for you. Plus, you really do feel like a Viking eating here- if you want to be a Viking, make your way over here now!", "author": "Alex B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-02", "description": "Alright, maybe it's because I am an actual Viking that I love this place so much.  (Scandinavian on both sides of the family, and raised in Minnesota - which is basically the 6th Scandinavian Country)  Maybe it's because I have a soft spot for places that remind me of growing up in the 80's and 90's - this place hasn't seen a remodel anytime recently, and I hope it doesn't any time soon.  Or, maybe, they just have good subs.\n\nI won't claim that they are reinventing the wheel.  Nor would I say this is a destination spot.  You've got fairly straight-forward toasted subs.  They've got all the standards:  Ham, Turkey, Roast Beef, Pastrami, Salami, Tuna, Meatball.  Then they have some of their own special varieties:  Teriyaki Beef or Chicken, Crab Salad (definitely surimi, which is fine in this Viking's book), BBQ Beef, and the \"Mighty Viking\" which is made with Ham, Salami and Pastrami.  All of the sandwiches come standard with Lettuce, Tomato, Onion, Dressing and Mayo.  Choice of American, Provolone or Swiss.  It comes on a toasted Sesame Roll. which is both flavorful, light and has a good crispness to it, even when you get take-out.  All the subs come in small (about 8\", generally $6.75 or $8.50 depending on the sandwich) and large (about 12\" and $9.75 or $11.50).  A small is plenty for lunch.  The large is a good amount of food, and you can do half for lunch and save the other half even if you're a hungry Viking.\n\nOverall the quality is solid.  All of the meat and fixins are good.  The service is very friendly and quick - I may be wrong, but it's always the same two people working and it seems like they may be the owners.  In addition to the subs, they also have a few deli items and deserts, and do sell beer by the bottle.  There are a few tables inside, and like I said, this place has that late 80's/early 90's vibe.  You could imagine this place next door to an old-style video rental shop.  I love it.\n\n(Now Just a Funny Experience as a Bonus)  I've frequently seen High School/slightly post-High School age kids come in around lunch since Galileo High School is pretty close.  I came in one workday afternoon and skater bro was with his friend and was trying to do an on the spot Yelp review about how much he loved Viking's Giant Subs.  The following is my recreation:  \"Bro, this s*** is so f***ing dank.  I f***ing love it bro.  You're getting the meatball sub? That s*** is hella-dank.  F*** bro.

It's been since FOREVER. I remember coming here when I was still back in middle and high school. It used to be a big spot to eat at for everyone who went to Galileo High School but then again, it's been about or almost over a decade since back then! Anyways, this is my absolute FAVORITE place to get a CRAB SALAD SANDWICH! No other places that makes sandwiches makes it as good as Vikings. They have another Vikings over on Ocean St near City College but that doesn't even COMPARE to Vikings on Lombard.\n \nIf you guys like subs as much as I do, this is THE PLACE TO BE! The only thing that sucks about this place is that there is no parking AT ALL. There's a little 1 car spot in front of the shop but it's only for like 10-15 minutes of parking. Definitely not enough for you to eat there. Everything here is made fresh to order and their bread is toasted hot for you to eat. This time me and Mona had their homemade macaroni salad, pastrami sandwich, and their ever popular crab salad sandwich. \n \nHonestly I thought the macaroni salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bgoSfVaZFXDthHLbWxyeQw?select=2SBehLqyyYnz7-Y-Qy0eBg was a little on the tangy/sour side. Mona had the hot pastrami sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bgoSfVaZFXDthHLbWxyeQw?select=qXX1QabUAmZO9bQfoDsGuA which I have to say was pretty damn good as well. Normally the pastrami elsewhere is a little on the dry side but this one was quite juicy. As for mine, the crab salad sandwich http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bgoSfVaZFXDthHLbWxyeQw?select=IpU2eX-mEIa-tEoZvE-9dA, that one is ALWAYS a favorite. It was so good, I had to have a large sub for myself haha. There's really no service here because the store is so small (3-4 small tables) so everything is self serve unless you consider them bring the food to your table service heh.\n\n[M] The subs were delicious theres no denying that, but they were a little on the pricer side. Sizes comes in Small (around $6.95) and a Large (around $9.95) size. So it is definitely worth it to upgrade your sandwich to a large for $3 more. \n \n[W] If you don't mind picking up or live around the area, try them out! If you like crab salad, don't miss out on their sandwich and if you love pastrami don't miss out on that neither! As for the macaroni salad.......yea.....haha.", "author": "Mona C."}

If it's a good sandwich, which it usually it, just eat it. If you wanna save money, you could make sandwiches at home.

But this place is an affront to sub sandwiches and lovers of said sandwiches. I was so disappointed that it compelled me to write my very first Yelp review. \n\nI went in on a Saturday for lunch and ordered a 6\" meatball sub for $6.99. The lady behind the counter basically took out 1 huge meatball from the tray, cut it in half and kind of spread the two halves across the bread leaving lots of empty, lonely bread on both ends,  threw some provolone on it and stuck it in the toaster oven briefly. Upon retrieving it from the oven, she immdiately started to wrap it up. Whoa, whoa, whoa! No offer for shredded lettuce, tomato, onion or even peperoncinis??? You've got a whole tray of that stuff ready to go! So when I asked her if she could just put on some lettuce, tomato and a little dressing, she looked at me as if she had never in all her time behind a deli counter heard of such a thing. Reluctantly, she haphazardly threw some of the requested items in. All this build up to bite into a bland sandwich with 2 giant meatball halves still half cold from the refrigerator. \n\nI honestly don't know how this place has received any more than 2 stars from reviewers.Now maybe it was just a bad day?

I was really looking forward to being different and giving this place three stars. But OMFG. So good.

Im glad I had checked yelp, because this sandwich was soooo good. Wow. some sort of dark meat chicken, cooked in this sauces that was kind of bbq-y with a bit of a ginger bite.  really tasty.  once the chicken had cooked a bit in the special oven, the sandwich was assembled and placed back in the oven with all of the fixins, including the cheese.  I think I saw something about BBQ chicken, which I may have to try next time.\nReading some other reviews, I noticed that a lot of people seemed to be bothered by the lack of options. and i think that is exactly why i like this place.  in a world of starbucks, subway, and burger king, I will gladly accept the simplicity of this great sandwich shop.\n**The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it was a bit pricey...about $10 for a small sandwich and an iced tea.

I find it to be an OK sub place. The food is decent, but nothing to write home about. In short, it is a step above Subway, but probably not worth the extra cost.", "author": "Jonathan M."}

This would be a great place to grab a snack before heading over the Golden Gate bridge to Sonoma and beyond. My only gripe...9 bucks...but it was good, and you can park right in front, they have a \"green zone\" (10 minutes)", "author": "James S."}

And the dressing dolloped on at the end.  a little oily, but darn tasty.\n\nFor 15 bones, i'd prefer a tri tip sandwich for a steak joint.", "author": "Kevin F."}

But Viking doesn't.  I've had the simple turkey sub with lettuce, tomato, cheese and mayo a few times and haven't been disappointed yet.  I even tried to re-create it at home, but somehow managed to not even come close.  I swear they do something magical to make something so simple so good.  Next time I'll try the Turkey Avocado like the other reviewers mentioned.", "author": "Mrsdubyah W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-04", "description": "This place is truly a hidden gem, in that you will likely not walk past it since it sits on a fairly low walking traffic corner.  The subs are delicous and made to order.  Not a place for those counting calories, you might want to keep walking up to Subway.  The Turkey sub is excellent.  The place is cash only, so bring a Hamilton.", "author": "Aashish T."}

Once you munch on the sandwich, you'll be begging for more. Something about the toasted bread and sauce, I think they use crack sauce lol.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-04-18", "description": "I'm not a big fan of eating sandwiches at restaurants, but I'll always give a sandwich that's \"hot and toasted\" a try.  I was truly surprised by how good my sandwich was.  My boyfriend ordered A BLT during the week and commented that it probably THE best BLT he's ever had and I was like yeah right, whatever.  So I stopped by the next week and ordered a pastrami and ham with swiss cheese and WOW, great stuff.  He has this oven that heats the bread to a crispy covering on the outside, but warm and soft on the inside, and the oven really mixes all of the ingredients on the sandwich really well.  I don't how to describe it.  Let's just say it was magic!  Ha! I'd give this place 5 stars, but I went back for the same sandwich and the owner guy put too many onions on there, which turned me off.  I'll definitely go back, but something has to be said for consistency.  I've got to be able to count on the sandwich in my time of hunger and need....The only other thing is don't order the small if you're really hungry.  It fills me up, but the men-folk would probably want a bit more.", "author": "LaSha G."}

[ed. note: genova delicatessen at 51st and Telegraph in Oakland does]), and truly med for a shwarma (i know, not exactly a sandwich, but close enough and damn tasty).  anyway, viking's on lombard: the same guy is still there after all these years (like arthur dent), rocking the toasted sesame roll with turkey and avocado. i never get anything else, so i can't say what else is good, but apparently the BLT comes recommended.  basically, all you want in a sandwich shop: good ingredients, no fancy complications, and a sandwich maker that quietly puts the care into it that makes it perfect.  only problem?  closest newspaper is a block away.", "author": "Plug N."}
