They really took care of us.\n\nMy company recently took all of us (125 people) on a trip to Napa Valley. We needed lunch on the bus from SFO to St. Helena, so I was researching gourmet sandwich-makers in the SF area  and came across Canyon Market as highly-rated in the deli department.\n\nCompared to Dean & Deluca, the lunch package Marina offered to us was of a greater value and not as costly as the standard D&D lunch box. Marina worked with me to ensure that every member of my company had the sandwich and wine of their choice (even modifying for our gluten-free people).\n\nOur company is a luxury interior design firm so everyone is used to having the best of the best, and when we finally enjoyed our carefully coordinated lunches (had to split orders over three buses worth of people!), everyone commented on how tasty and healthy the food was and how great the cans of wine Marina recommended were (easiest way to drink wine on the go--excellent suggestion!). Everything was organized and packaged like perfect little gift bags. It was a coordinator's dream.\n\nThank you, Marina, and everyone at Canyon Market for your patient customer service and attention to detail! Considering Canyon Market is still just a small business, it was quite a feat to pull this catering job off (required coordinating with our luxury bus company, drivers, etc.). You really helped us kick our trip off on a high. Cannot recommend more highly for quality, service, and care! Thanks again!", "author": "Amie S."}

I super love shopping for produce, because of all of the beautiful colors and choices, and CM does not disappoint.  It offers a high quality selection of seasonal produce to compliment, or feature, in any meal.  I scored some interesting purple yams last week that were both awesome-looking and unique-tasting.  The price of the produce is comparable to Whole Foods (read: a little high), but well worth it.  And I note that it is impossible to open CM's green plastic bags designated for produce--seriously, not easy.  I tried to buy some jalapenos and struggled for around five minutes to get the bag open.  I could feel my face burning red with embarrassment when I took a look around and saw that my co-shoppers were likewise struggling to get those bags open.  It was like a Seinfeld episode.  Finally we were told that there was something wrong with the bags and they just did not open by one of the store clerks.  Whew!  But other than that, divine produce.  \n\nI also love the seafood counter.  Those king scallops ($30/lb-yikes!) are phenomenal.  I would like to eat those every day, please.  And the fellas working the counter are as nice as can be. \n\nI really like the nut bins as well.  Deez nuts are delicious and fresh.  \n\nMy favorite thing about the CM, however, is how nice everyone is.  It's not the typical ass-to-ankles rudeness you experience at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.  This is a small, neighborhood joint, so everyone's on a first name basis.  Folks are into the niceties, saying please, thank you, excuse me, and sorry. People are even smiling! It's positively refreshing.\n\nCons: Parking. Good god, good luck.Just take BART-CM is  a block away from Glen Park Bart Station. Then have someone pick you up if you have a lot of loot.  Just walk a block down to Bello Coffee and have a hot peach black tea (YUM) while you wait for your ride. In addition, the space is pretty small, so it can get pretty packed at times. But even when it's packed, people seem to be pretty nice. \n\nOverall I love shopping at CM, because sometimes you wanna go where everybody knows your name.", "author": "Sunny S."}

Since its opening, this market has remained disconnected with San Francisco and its myriad of denizens. \n\nToday, I purchased a salad and tried to find some tape to hold the box closed while I continued to shop. Whole Foods, Andronico's, Mollie Stone, and Rainbow all have tape next to their containers so that purchased items won't come open while shopping and to enhance food safety. I mean, how much does a roll of tape cost in the grand seem of things? Bringing my items to checkout with spilled couscous and red beets in the basket, I asked the store why there's no tape and was told, \"We couldn't possibly do that! You can't imagine what 'people' would do with that tape. We've seen it all.\" Really?

They have a variety of prepared food that is delicious and convenient on those days when you don't have time/energy to cook. They also carry pretty good foodstuffs on a regular basis. The staff is typically great; they get to know all the locals and greet you with a smile.\n\nThe major downside is the price. This place is about 15-20% more expensive than Whole Foods on average. That said, there is zero competition in Glen Park for groceries. There are no alternatives unless you want to get in the car and drive to WF in Noe or head over to the decrepit Safeway on Monterey (one of the more depressing grocery stores in the city).", "author": "Randy N."}

And I find the owner (lady) absolutely delightful and helpful - ask her about the cheese...  But sadly some of the prices are seriously ridiculous.  Like today, $7 for a head of califlower!  A similar size was $4 at Whole Foods and less than that at the Farmer's Market around the corner.   This is not unusual.  Prices can be whacky whacky whacky - no rhyme or reason which makes their gouge-like pricing very, very suspect.  There's a couple of good deals there but not many.  \n\nGlen Park is still a diverse neighborhood and I'd love to see Canyon Market serve the whole community a bit better than than just the the new rich that have moved into the neighborhood and can afford that super special cauliflower.  Molly Stones is only about a mile and a half away and, though pricey as well, it is cheaper as well as more consistent and stable.\n\nFinally, the worker kids are getting better, much better.  There was a long stretch from the start where this place hired young people ruder than the team at Rainbow... and that's rude.  But they really have grown up a bit and had some additional training...  Good job on that.", "author": "William T."}

Previously, these were hand-written, but the last time I ordered, they were pre-printed and included all of the ingredients on them! This is incredibly helpful when you have a group of people with numerous food allergies.

Local flavor, healthy eats, small neighborhood market.  \n\nThis grocery store certainly has character, but if you aren't careful, you will wind up spending a LOT of money.\n\nTHE GOOD STUFF:\n\nIf you come here once, get THE DELI SANDWICHES. Heaven on earth I'm telling ya.  I cannot resist the #6 chicken breast and gruyere sandwich. Let me dissect this for you:\n\n- Hot and toasty focaccia bread with a perfectly soft bite\n- Expertly layered sauteed red onions.  The caramelization is wonderful.\n- Gooey gruyere\n- Tender chicken breast\n- Crispy pancetta(!!!)\n\nThe textures and flavors at play in this sandwich make me drool as I write this review. \n\nI would like to say that this is the *best* sandwich to get based on my sampling of the other sandwiches, but I am afraid that I am too hooked on #6 that I have not tried the others!  If I have, they are not quite as memorable.  That is my recommendation for you.\n\nIf you come here occasionally, the baked goods, cheese, wine, and dips are superb and all gourmet.  Worth the splurge.  If you're lucky, they put out cheese and dip samples for customers to graze as they shop - Costco style. ;) \n\nI'LL PASS...\n\nDinner in?  There are plenty of take-out places in the city and Canyon Market... unfortunately, you do not top my list.  A dinner for two set me back quite a bit: crabcakes (rather huge!), cochinita pivil (pork shoulder), and prawns were some of the top recommended choices.  The meal was of excellent quality, don't get me wrong, but I probably could have gone to a restaurant to order these dishes and paid about the same with less work to heat everything up.\n\nProduce and non-perishables are simply not worth it for me.  The produce looks polished to perfection, but really...I'll pass on the pricey tomato and settle for one at the Mission grocery stories.\n\nIn conclusion, pick your battles wisely at Canyon.

There are copious low priced markets in San Francisco, which is not what Canyon Market is, nor what it aspires to be. This is a high-end market for people who expect quality and are happy to pay for it. I live in the Mission, where I can get discounted groceries every day. (And don't get me wrong - I most certainly relish being able to buy all of my product for a week for $15 on 24th street). However, I recently found Canyon Market on a trip to visit a Glen Park resident, and it is my new love. I will gladly drive to Canyon Market to pick up my fresh fish, pork and beef, and will feel better about the choices I'm making, regardless of the dent in my pocketbook. \n\nPlus, have you tried their egg salad with olive tapenade and prosciutto sandwich? I mean, give me a f*cking break. That thing is ridiculous. I would never have thought to put those three ingredients together, and now I'm craving it as I write this. \n\nSo come on, people. If you want discount groceries, go to a discount grocery store. If you want to give all of your hard-earned money to a massive corporation, go to Whole Foods. But if you, like me, appreciate a Mom/Pop store with a great selection, hand-picked proteins, bulk items and freshly-made sandwiches, then embrace the fact that we are lucky enough to have a market like Canyon.

The latter remains true but something happened to the former.  \n\nI've noticed some teenage/young adult employees lately.  Some pose no issues and are quite nice.  Others are mirroring the careless, rowdiness found at chain groceries.  One time at checkout, I was done paying and asked for a bag.  Unfortunately, the cashier completely tuned out as soon as he put my money in the register as he hopped over the wall and pranced toward the exit, leaving me high and dry.  His co-worker was nice enough to hand me the requested bag while chasing down his comrade to inform him of his idiocy.  \n\nIn another instance, I was looking for a particular beauty item they didn't seem to carry.  I asked if they could order it, a request that was happily met by their jotting down the name in their books.  Afterward, I was told I could expect it in about 2 weeks.  2 weeks later, it still wasn't there.  I flagged down a staff member to investigate.  The result showed my request wasn't even in the books despite the enthused pen to paper action weeks prior.  I was then offered to have my request taken again.  I didn't bother.  I didn't want to be mislead and sent on another roller coaster ride of anticipation. \n\nThese issues aside, their house-made products are pretty good.

This review is mostly for their sandwiches, although the market in general would also get 2.5 stars.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and upscale, erratic, tight aisles, yummy samples. Lacks variety. Definitely not a place for bargains, but has organics and boutique items. Pleasant staff. \n\nWhen I first came in the meat/fish guy behind the counter boasted that they have better sandwiches than BiRite Market--Um, Nooooo. That's not true: I had two sandwiches today and aside from the yummy fresh baguette and focaccia, the ingredients and the execution of the sandwich was very lackluster. Does not make me want to pay $7 and $10 for sandwiches there again. \n\nA great sandwich you can taste all of the ingredients in harmony and the star of the show is the filling/protein whether it be meat, fish, cheese or veggies. The two I had today were not great. My criticisms:\n\n- Crab Cakes Sandwich: Mostly disappointing. Crab Cakes aren't very crabby and tasted like filler. Too many red onion and on top of that the red onions were cooked well or right. They slices were too big and there were tough leathery and flavorless pieces of onion. The onion was everywhere--they was the second biggest component after the crab cakes. The spread was good but not much of it. They served the sandwich on sourdough baguette which is a little bit of an odd choice because the crabcakes are soft and end up shooting out of the sandwich when you bite into the chewy baguette. DISAPPOINTING.\n\n- Veg and Havarti: I was excited to try this because it has sundried tomato spread on it. I used to adore the sundried tomato pesto on the brie sando at Big Sherm's in the Lower Haight back in the day. However, this sundried tomato spread was blah. First of all it was ice cold on my sandwich. And, instead of having an olive oil base in the spread it was somewhat watery which made it taste like marinara. No bueno. So, imagine cold, marinara on lettuce and cucumbers and fresh mealy tomatoes--that was in the sandwich! That sounds unappetizing, doesn't it? The thinnest slice of havarti on the planet is in there, too. That cheese looked like paper. Aside from the wonderfully fresh focaccia bread this sandwich was a FAILURE.\n\nMaybe, I'll try another sandwich, hopefully, something other reviewers are raving about, but I'm not rushing back here for a sandwich. It's a cute market, the people seem friendly enough and there are definitely a lot of tempting looking items like specialty desserts and prepacked cheese spreads and dips. If you like upscale chocolate like Rechiutti they have it.\n\nBy the way, Canyon Market is NOT BiRite Market. BiRite Market is amazing and has much better sandwiches.

Canyon Market is a great place -- a neat hybrid of small and big. The prepared foods are generally very good, and the soups are super tasty. But I must relate a negative experience that, for better or for worse, caused us to stop shopping there for a few months.\n\nWe had bought two bunches of organic curly kale to use in our Kale and White Bean Soup. I am quite fastidious when washing leafy vegetables, and as I was washing the kale one leaf at a time, I discovered a slug. And then another. And another. And another. And another. I called my husband over and said that I had found not one, but FIVE slugs in the kale. He picked up a leaf and said, \"Oh my god, don't look!\" and this made me want to look, and I wish I hadn't, because it was a full-sized black beetle.\n\nSo we composted the kale and ordered pizza.\n\nFast forward to the next time we were at Canyon Market. We were unloading several items at the checkstand and I remembered the slugs and the beetle. So I mentioned this to the cashier, and he said, \"Well, that's how you know it's organic.\" Really? My husband and I have been buying and cooking with organic vegetables for years, and we are not under the impression that \"organic\" and \"pest-ridden\" are the same thing. Organic doesn't mean that pests aren't controlled -- it mandates the ways in which pests are controlled.\n\nAnyway, an occasional bug is not a big deal, and if I'd only found one slug in the kale, I would have removed it and moved on. But five slugs and a beetle -- that's over the top. A market, no matter what its size, should unhesitatingly stand behind the items it sells. If he had simply thanked us for the feedback and offered us a credit or something, we wouldn't have thought twice about it. But his response (not the slugs and the beetle!) caused us to stop shopping at Canyon Market for about three months, costing them many hundreds of dollars in lost sales, and for what? So they could save a dollar? \n\nWe do most of our shopping at Whole Foods in Noe Valley. Say what you will about the big-boxiness of Whole Foods, but they stand behind their products 110%. They would never imply that you should expect to find five slugs and a beetle in your kale because it's organic. On the rare occasions when we've had a problem with something we've bought there, they have refunded or replaced it without hesitation. We do occasionally shop at Canyon Market now, but not as much as we used to.", "author": "Jessica L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-30", "description": "This place is great. If you're like one of the many reviewers who think buying conventional produce and food full of high fructose corn syrup is a 'good deal' just because it costs less money, but then gives you diabetes and raises everyone else's healthcare costs, then this probably isn't going to be the store for you. There's a Safeway on Monterey Boulevard and another one up the hill off of Clipper across from Twin Peaks for all of your diabetes-inducing requirements. If you don't especially like cooking your own food and eat Chipotle 3 times a week and think it's the best burrito you've ever had, probably also not your kind of place.\n\nAdmittedly, the food here costs more than Safeway, but it doesn't cost any more than Whole Foods, and unlike Whole Foods it isn't a giant chain store; it's local to the neighborhood. In fact the only thing here that is actually a bit too expensive is the produce, but it's honestly very good produce and produce is still cheaper as a category than anything else, so it's not a big deal. If you really need cheap produce but don't want crap, I would go to the Alemany farmer's market down the road on the weekends.\n\nMore to the point, everything here is organic/fair trade/grass fed/hormone free/etc. etc. I agree that we shouldn't have to pay more for vegetables grown without nasty cancer-causing pesticides sprayed on them, meat that is humanely raised and slaughtered, and snacks that aren't full of diabetes-inducing high fructose corn syrup. What we call 'organic' today was just the way food was harvested 50 years ago; it wasn't a special category. Then again, food in this country is only as artificially cheap as it is because of Earl Butz' corn revolution in the 70's and the rise of agrobiz. So the 'extra' we pay for 'organic' food is actually just how much good ingredients probably should cost in the first place.\n\nI personally like to cook my own food quite a lot, and I care very much about the quality of the things that go inside my body. Some people call me a 'foodie'; to me it's just normal. I don't mind investing extra money and time in meals that I and guests at my dinner table will remember for life. But that's just me. For a lot of Americans food is just a thing you cram in your mouth for a few minutes between doing other things. For me it's a way of living the good life without having to be a millionaire. The Italians call it 'la dolce vita'.\n\nAt this store I know I can meet all my grocery needs and not have to worry about buying anything cheap, bad for me, unethical or the like. Beer selection: one of the best in the city for a grocery store, although I do have to give first prize to the Noe Whole Foods. If I really want the best, I go to Healthy Spirits anyway. Canyon has Labyrinth regularly, which is not easy to find anywhere else, Old Rasputin, Einstok, 21st Amendment, Unibroue and an assortment of other craft beers. If you're really craving a Budweiser maybe go to the dive bar across the street instead; or one of the two liquor stores within half a block of the store. As far as other beverages, they have all of my favorites: Q soda drinks and Boylan, Stumptown iced coffee, Blue Bottle iced coffee. They have a decent assortment of wines, but I'm not a huge wine aficianado. I mostly buy cheap whites for cooking kick-ass meals. They have Straus everything, a wide variety of Bob's Red Mill products, Guittard baking chocolate in all varieties (even bulk), Casa Sanchez Totopos, house made merguez sausage, great bulk goods, decent coffee that I think is actually much better than Bello up the street, PG Tips, Oscar Wilde Cheddar, L'Amourette, Taza and many other fine chocolates (which you're supposed to suck on like hard candy a piece at a time, not hork down like 'muricans do), and one of the best BBQ chicken sandwiches I've ever had (which you are supposed to hork down). Also they have probably the best cheese section for a grocery store in the city. They also have fantastic breakfast sandwiches. If I worked downtown and had to take GP Bart to work I'd be in there every morning all like wut wut, where my toasted gruyere egg and cheese bagel, bia.. ma'am? They even sell the flaxseed oil I use to season my skillets and other iron cookware.\n\nThe staff is sometimes a little slow to help you just because, for a small store, they get a ton of business, and are usually pretty busy. However, they're some of the nicest, most dedicated grocery staff in town and I've never had anything but pleasant, helpful interactions with any of them. If you are a regular like I am, you will notice that some of the same people who were there when I moved into the neighborhood 4 years ago are still there, and still cheerful, which tells you something.\n\nFor the limited space they have, the selection is outstanding. And frankly, I like going to Avedano's, Mollie Stone's, Rainbow, Healthy Spirits, Nijiya and ordering the occasional thing online.", "author": "Steve S."}

This isn't where the cupcakes are. The cupcakes are on the left side of the kitchen area near the house baked breads.  They're sold individually and also in 4 packs.  Flavors rotate.  On the day I visited, I saw three flavors (chocolate, vanilla, red velvet).  The cupcakes are a little smaller than usual as they don't have the height of most other bakeries.\n\n* Vanilla cupcake with lemon buttercream and a fresh blueberry: Excellent cake: moist with visible vanilla bean specks.  The frosting was creamy, lemony, bright, and not too sweet.  It was colder and a little harder than I prefer but still very good.  \n\n* Chocolate cupcake with chocolate ganache: Dense, high quality chocolate flavor.  The cake was a little too dense in my opinion, making it more like a brownie.  The frosting was rich, creamy, and not too sweet.\n\nThe salad bar is $6.99/lb, cheaper than Whole Foods and Harvest.

I then asked for a handful of sliced red onion and a few pieces of lettuce to make sandwiches at home.  Rather than simply saying \"I have to charge you for that\", which would only have been mildly offensive, they undertook an elaborate explanation about being \"short\" of onions and lettuce at the sandwich station, but they were available at the salad bar, and they proceeded to put sliced onions in a container that could be weighed and priced.  The extra charge was $1.57.  I'm sure the cost was about 25 cents.\n\nAs a regular customer I spend about $50-$75 a week at the store buying prepared foods.  They are expensive, even over-priced, but I always figured that was a trade I was willing to make for convenience.  Also, on one occasion I bought 4 sandwiches that made all of us sick within 3 hours, but not for a minute did I think of asking for my money back.  On another, I bought $57 worth of filet mignon that, when I got it home, was clearly on its last leg.  Again, I didn't think of returning it.  It's all part of the give and take of the neighborhood retail experience.\n\nThe charade of being \"short\" on onions and lettuce at the sandwich station, but having more than enough 20 feet away, tore it for me.  Thinking like any small business owner, they were consumed with anything going out the door for free, and instead needed to squeeze the last nickel out of me (or any other patron).  It was offensive, especially given that I am a frequent customer.\n\nSo I hope they enjoyed that $1.57.  They could have bought enormous good will by just giving me a few onion slices.  Instead, I will no longer shop at the store on a regular basis.  More than likely I will buy the few things that I really want on occasion, but the regular sales won't recur.  I figure that to be about $3,000 a year.  Multiply that by the number of other patrons who have no doubt been similarly offended and they are talking real lost business.  They already have a reputation for being over-priced.

Somehow, I don't know how, but they managed to screw it up too. I think it may be because they were trying to be too 'gourmet' about it and screwed up something so simple. The tomato-base sauce they used was far too overpowering so all I really got from the sandwich was tomato sauce and some turkey and not much of anything else. If I didn't know any better, there wasn't even bacon in it.\n\nI did hear good things about their soups though but the one time I did check, there wasn't any soups that sounded interesting to me so I ended up not getting any.

I should have realized this because they do bake their own breads, but it didn't hit me until I took my first bite into this sandwich. The ciabatta was so light and airy, not densed like most ciabatta breads. I couldn't believe how amazing the bread was! The combination of salami, coppa, peperoncini with the balsamic dressing was good, but the fresh-ness of the ciabatta bread definitely made the sandwich!\n\nI'm definitely returning to try their other sandwiches!", "author": "Liz C."}

OMFG-I mean, I have to freaking make a list:\n1. The Baked goods-made in house such as whole wheat batard, a HUGE crumb-topped marionberry pie for $14.95 and the best part-a pound cake that you'd swear was really shortbread with a dusting of lovely sugar crystals.-$5.95! \n(This being the age of $27.00 cakes in markets, these prices were refreshing).\n2. QUALITY meats-I found Spanish chorizo here! For those of you who make European recipes as I do, this was a godsend. Check out \"Olive\" magazine from the UK-you'll thank me later.\nNiman Ranch pork chops that were\na. Thick, bone-in, juicy cuts.\nb. affordable.\n\nYes, some of their meat is $$$$-but, I guess I know where to go when I must have freshly cut buffalo skirt steak. This is NOT Safeway-but quality costs moulah, not to mention avoidance of those pesky factory farms.\n\nBTW-We were so psyched to find the aforementioned buffalo being cut by the super-sweet Tuffy-famous for her Liver pate and supreme reign as a chef at Delassio's in Falleti's Market in the Haight.  \n3. A selection of organic veggies that matches Rainbow's quality (while not as big as theirs).\n4.

I have always been treated well by the staff. They have even walked out heavy loads like firewood to the car.  They have a great presentation and organic healthy produce.  \n\nUnfortunately, I have found their food safety practices questionable. \nFor the last 18 months I have complained to the staff about the lack of the sneeze guard at the pastry counter.    The pastries are sitting out on a counter right at the nose level of a child.   (I know because I have kids).   Well they finally got a sneeze guard, but the pastries are sticking out 6 inches past the sneeze guard.  Not effective at all.   The thing that actually prompted me to write this review is the fruit bread pudding I brought home yesterday.  I cut it up to feed my kids and it was fuzzy with mold.   I had picked this up at the pastry counter.  It didn't have a made on date so who knows how long this had been sitting out unrefrigerated.  On another recent visit, I saw a bottle of 409 cleaner sitting in the middle of a cheese display, assumable forgotten by a staff member. \n\nI am sure there is no problem with the groceries and the produce.  But it's best to be cautious when purchasing the in-house prepared food.   Definitely look for a made on date before buying.", "author": "Dana P."}

Last spring, I bought a couple bags of groceries, including some soft fruit (early-season plums, I think), and when I got home I discovered that they were crushed because the checker put them near the bottom of the bag. I just chalked it up to occasional human error and didn't say anything.\n\nBut when the same thing happened -- with the same checker -- 2 months later, I called and spoke to the manager. I didn't want anything except for them to train the checker in question that peaches, plums, etc. shouldn't go into the bottom of the bag. She apologized profusely and promised to talk to the checker, and -- without any prompting -- offered to bring some replacement fruit to my home. She offered to do this before even asking if I lived close by. She came by and delivered the fruit that afternoon, and threw in a few heirloom tomatoes as a way of making up for the inconvenience. \n\nThis is not an isolated experience.

When I am able to shop there, the last thing I want is to feel like I'm being duped - specifically when buying meats. I like the idea  of a \"butcher\" but I don't believe that it's actually a group of trained butchers - at the counter or in the back trimming the meats. While they usually can't answer questions about the cuts, what's really frustrating is that for the third time (yes, I know, shame on me), I've bought a cut of meat and didn't remember to say to the butcher \"turn it over\" - which I really don't think you should have to ask. I don't know how they are trained on trimming cuts of meat, but a 4 year old could do a better job. It's presented as a beautiful cut, and then you turn it over to find an awful cut that is virtually all fat and nasty - something you would never consider buying. Take heed and be sure to inspect your purchase - because it certainly isn't bargain priced and you certainly don't get what you paid for.", "author": "LC C."}

Who wants to eat something that people have put their fingers in right?! Manners people! Anyways, the salad bar here is usually very clean and they provide lots of different pasta salads and gourmet olives along with your regular salad toppings such as corn, pickles, croutons, fruit, etc. \n\nTheir soup bar always has three different types varying everyday. Sometimes I see chili, homemade clam chowder (yum!), chicken noodle, split pea, etc and etc. The list goes on and on! \n\nTheir already made products are also amaze balls! They have at least 20 different options from veggies to seafood to roast chicken to pasta and etc. I always get their calamari salad which is mixed with red bell peppers, capers, olives, red onions and parsley at about $13 a pound. Sounds expensive but if you ask for a scoop full it comes out to be less than $3! :) They also have a long list of sandwiches they can make for you which i haven't had yet, but my mom says they're pretty amazing! \n\nThis market also has its own little coffee shop to the side once you walk in the doors! I haven't had their coffee or tea yet, but I do like their pastries especially the coffee cake with walnuts (yum!). The only thing I don't like is that their pastries are all put out in the open where flies can fly around and bugs and what not. \n\nThe only downside to this market is that parking sucks!

The prices also reflect the fact that Canyon has a tiny, cramped loading dock on a residential street and very limited space to store merchandise.  \n\nEach weekday morning, I walk past pallets of food on the curb waiting to be unloaded.  Rather than pallets of single items, like cereal or milk, each pallet is loaded with small quantities of dozens of different foods, obviously packed by a distributor.  The fact that they can maintain a supermarket selection of food in a neighborhood market space is a miracle.  \n\nAnd in this small space is a full-service deli, a salad bar, a flower shop, a wine bar, a bulk food section, a coffee shop and a bakery.

If I would, I'd be broke.  What I love is the quality of their products, especially the soups, salad bar, and items behind the deli counter.  The breads at the front are delicious and fresh baked.  Their guacamole dip is one of the best I've had.  Sesame noodle behind the counter is yummy.   Can't go wrong with the choices in their salad bar.  It's consistently the same albeit a few minor changes every other day (i.e., squid instead of chicken).  It is a bit more expensive than Whole Foods (i.e., Tcho chocolate is $2 more than what's being sold at Wholefoods, Tejava tea (if not on sale) is also higher).  Bottomline, if you're coming in to get a bite to eat and a couple of small items, then this is a great spot.  For all your other kitchen yumminess, probably not.  I'm still a fan of this place and am grateful they exist.

Like others have said, my first time in I thought it was way too small, not much in there and WAY expensive.  A few weeks later I realized they were not fully stocked or set up yet and that I should have given them a chance.\n\nSo glad the hub and I went back.  I LOVE the homemade soups!  My faves are the Chicken Tortilla and Chicken Veggie with different pastas.  Sometimes rizzoto, sometimes elbow, etc. My dad LOVED the 7 Seas Fish soup.  I mentioned to him that it sounded gross to me and he said his grandma used to make fish soup and asked me to get him some next time they had a pot.  Again, he LOVED it.  I did taste it, and it was good.  BIG chunks of salmon!   And their fresh baked rolls to got with it?  Yummy.\n\nThe hub and I are now regulars Saturday and Sunday morning at their little coffee corner.  Having been a fan of Martha's for years on Cortland, we still are but the LINE was becoming such a pain and pretty much a bad way to start a day.  (can we say GROUCH inducing?)  So we decided to try Canyon one morning months ago, and still are never in line behind more than two people...if any.  And their pastry?  Omg!  Most is made there, a few things I saw a little sign of what bakery it's from.  I have had to stay away from that little glass case.  Too many of their chocolate croissants have ended up on my ass.\n\nYes, it's a little expensive, but I like the things I like so I pay.  I agree I wouldn't do my shopping there.  It's kind of like a \"gourmet\" or \"need a couple things and don't want to go to Safeway\" store.\n\nAs far as the meat/butcher?  Never bought anything because to be honest?  Some of the meat?  Looks like it's been there way too long.  I am really picky about my meat, poultry and fish, and so far have seen nothing appetizing in their cases.

My major problem with it is this: I just came from there, and while shopping  I was amazed to see a woman also shopping with a large poodle on a leash. The dog was pulling away and she was trying to rope the animal  toward her. When I got to the cashier I asked if dogs, other than seeing eye dogs or other special needs trained dogs,  were legal in grocery stores in SF. She told me \"yes, all dogs are allowed, unless they piss at your feet.\" I just called The SF Dept of Health who told me otherwise. It is illegal  for non special needs trained dogs to be inside grocery stores (and restaurants, etc).\nWhen I Googled this further, I read how dog owners just have to say (if questioned at all) that their dog is a service dog. No license or paper work required; it's not like a handicapped person showing a special license to park in a handicapped parking spot. Hello?\nI like dogs,  but am beginning to lose it with all the dog fanatics in this city ( it was insane enough when the dog owners tried to take over the baseball field in GG Park where my son's team from Lowell was trying to practice; they thought it more important for their dogs to be off lease on the field).\nThe long and short of it is that I will think twice before entering Canyon Market again, now that I know they welcome dogs in the aisles.

In my point of view, for the good (even if it is an effect of the infamous gentrification). One result of this change, has been Canyon Market.\n\nIt is a really cute, organic, corner store and coffee bar. Now, it doesn't have everything (does any corner store?) you need but I like to consider it a little mini Rainbow grocery (with meat). They have amazing sandwiches and other fresh deli stuff. The service is also amazing! You won't stand by the deli for less than a minute without being asked if you have been helped, and they don't glare at you crazy when you ask for a bagillion samples!\n\nThe downfall? EXPENSIVE! However, as most corner stores, you pay for the convenience. And it is nice to have a little store so close to your house!\n\nOn a more unimportant note, the uniforms are horrible!

I've never frequented the salad bar, so can't speak to that.  Sure does take up a lot of inventory in the store, though.\n\nVeggies and fruits always have good selection.  The staff that work in this area are helpful.  I always find flowers or a blooming plant that is fresh and reasonably priced.  \n\nI never see anyone at the coffee counter - so I get my java a few doors down.\n\nThe prepared foods (go for the Chicken Enchilada Mole!) are quite good.  Good cheese offerings (but lacks smoked mozzarella after asking several times), and some wine specials that are good too.  Small, but excellent selection in the meat department (prices are steep).  Fresh breads and bakery offerings are excellent.  The organic, non-gluten, vegan options are excellent.\n\nI do agree with some of the other comments about staff.  As a rule, they are not service oriented.  It is curious that I come here every week - for over 2 years - yet always treated as a stranger.  I can walk into Tower/Molly Stone and I will be greeted - \"Hi, there, neighbor!\"  At Canyon, I've never been treated rudely - but far from neighborly.  As such, noone ever makes recommendations.  At Tower, if I pick up a bottle of wine to look - the wine guy will comment on it and recommend other offerings depending on what I'm looking for.  And before I know it ... I've selected 3 bottles!  \n\nAt Canyon - if I ask, I get an answer.  It seems they have plenty of staff - but they seem to prefer to speak to each other.  Not help their customers.\n\nI think this is one area that would help build customer loyalty.  And allow customers a method to request special items.  Please ... smoked mozzarella?  More goat cheese offerings?  Maybe have small notepads at the checkout to ask \"Is there a product you wish we carried?\"\n\nSome customer service training ... practice making eye contact, smiling and greeting might be easy fix for the current aloof atmosphere.  \n\nThis aside, I obviously keep coming back.

Where else can you buy a pound of pancetta, a box of egg replacement, a bottle of Campari, biodegradable compost bags and a few yummy coconut macaroons?  That's right, almost nowhere.  While some products tend toward the pricier side, it is nothing like the crazy sticker shock at Whole Foods.  Also, I'm really grateful for the little signs they put up letting you know why the limes are expensive, or why the onions look kind of funky.  \n\nWhile I've read mixed reviews on Yelp about the Canyon, the best I advice I can offer is that you drop by and see if it fits with you, if it's your type of food and your type of peoples.  Oh, but don't drive.  Please, don't drive.  There is one tiny lot nearby that's supposed to be for BART parking, and other than that there is little to be had street parking.

(Granted, you can't get a lot of these things at Safeway, and when you can, like Amy's Frozen Meals, they're usually overpriced too.) But at least Safeway has stuff on sale.  Even small things like sesame noodle salad, which is tasty enough but not that much to it, is really pricey. \n- Fairly small pasta selection (and again, it's overpriced). \n- Would be nice to have a few more pre-made sandwiches\n- Less important but it would be nice if they had a few more non-food gift items, like cards, candles, that sort of thing t hat you can find in variety at Rainbow.

Although the cake was a little on the drier side, the frosting was absolutely perfect and delectable! It had a nice balanced cream cheese flavor, not too sugary but sweet enough, and very creamy. It was also topped off with cute little red sprinkles.", "author": "Geneva X."}

I said maybe they are in cahoots with Calvert Jang & Associates (insert cheesey smile)  I even broke out an old Ginzu knife, you know, the one that can cut through a nail and still slice tomatoes paper thin.

There's no parking lot, but in Glen Park you can usually find some sort of street parking nearby. \n\nHere you'll find organic produce, a limited, but respectable wine selection, meat and sea food counter (I noticed they had goat! I need to try that sometime - note to self), salad bar, olive bar, soups, good selection of cheeses, and other gourmet food items.\n\nThis isn't a place you'd do all your shopping (at least not the ideal place), nor is it a place to get great bargains, or necessarily a place you'll find obscure things, and there's likely not much point going out of your way to get here.\n\nHowever, if you are entertaining, or bringing things to a dinner party, and nearby, Canyon Market is a convenient place to pick up quality goods.\n\nI was going to a party, and needing to bring some last minute items (wine, snacks, tea, etc.). It was easy to find the stuff I needed, and checkout was fast and friendly.  And, yeah, it was pricey, but going to Trader Joe's is not always an option. (and to be fair, Trader Joe's may have a larger selection of wines at better prices, but things like produce and meats are far superior at Canyon Market)", "author": "Boris C."}

My initial complaint was due to some pretty shoddy customer service (isn't that the issue whenever a retail business gets it wrong?), and while it's a way off perfect, they're making the right moves. Kids don't listen to their iPod on the checkout anymore, although you still have to jump around naked to get the attention of the people who 'work' behind the meat counter.\n\nThe quality of food is good and the selection is improving.

(See a price comparison chart in the most recent Glen Park News for more details on how this spot compares with other markets.)\n\nI'm not usually a sandwich person, but their sizable sandwiches are excellent -- I'm a fan of the roast turkey with pesto. The staff is always receptive to requests (they'll sell you a half sandwich, for example, even though the option isn't posted). And their sugar snap pea salad is very tasty. \n\nWhat's more, the management seems incredibly receptive to neighborhood feedback -- I've seen how the selection has changed in response to requests. \n\nI live close to Canyon Market and love to cook. Being able to run out of the house five minutes before a dinner party starts because I need more strawberries (which, by the way, cost less than at Whole Foods) is a gift.

I'd rate Higher Grounds 2 and this market 5 after my adventure... why? \nThe food at Higher Grounds is filled with oil. That was the predominate flavor for me. Did it taste good? Yeah, but not as good as a few hundred extra calories worth of corn oil should make fried potatoes. Did I feel good after? Not at all. I love friendly neighborhood places, and if you're looking for a good cup of coffee and character, by all means, go there. Otherwise, you may want to be a bit weary of all the other glowing yelp reviews. \n\nThe real gem of my afternoon exploration was Canyon Market. I'd driven past and always wondered how it was. For those that were disappointed, you have to go in with realistic expectations. This is not a place to do weekly shopping (unless you don't care about price and  limited variety). However, it is an amazing mecca of high-quality, healthy and gourmet items and is now officially my favorite gourmet market in SF. They have lots of hard to find items that are an absolute delight. I got: seasonal pumpkin spice soy milk (going to be my night cap through the holidays... to die for, and at 5% fat, a lot healthier than most things I could have), a fresh salad from their salad bar, bakery items (chocolate cookies and chocolate pudding... can we say \"craving\"?), pasta shop butternut squash ravioli, smoked chicken apple sausage, prepared red pepper broccollini and fresh bread. \n\nLast night I threw together the easiest, best dinner I've made in ages. We had the ravioli with just a bit of butter and fried sage leaves, along with the chicken sausage sauteed with onions and apples in white wine and I just reheated the broccollini. Now I'm sitting here eatting the salad I made for lunch.  All of their dressings are homemade, and I chose lemon parmesan. The salad bar's not as big as Whole Foods, but I'd go to this one any day and it's better than most any other I've seen in the city. \n\nFor anyone who wants a beautiful neighborhood market that will inspire great meals, and isn't just out to fill an entire basket at value prices, go, go, go. I will be back many times. If you see someone lusting after the pine nut macaroons, and tasting olives, or trying to decide between the lemon parmesan and shallot dressings, it's me.", "author": "Shoshana D."}

Sprinkles, who?! \n\nCanyon Market is noticeably different from the rest of the neighborhood, you won't miss it. If it helps, it's a block away from the Glen Park Station. Right next to the cash registers, tempting healthy shoppers, holds the cupcakes in a box of 4 for $7.95. I ended up buying Red Velvet with Cream Cheese Frosting and Pumpkin with Cream Cheese Frosting. There was also a strawberry one and a chocolate one, but I don't remember the frostings. \n\nThe cupcakes were meant for dessert after dinner,  but we were too full to eat them. We ended up hiding them in a purse and carrying them into the movies. By this time, the cupcakes were toppled over, with much of the frosting on the box and not on the cake. Not that it bothered me though. I really liked the Pumpkin and had a bite of the Red Velvet. They were both yummy, moist, and not too sweet. But the frosting was  ehhh. . . It was VERY soft, like gooey, and tasted too much like straight up whipped cream cheese. \n\nI definitely want to try this place out again, like when I want to get my calories on.

I noticed the salad and soup bar of course but have to be very cautious due to food allergies(celiac disease). At the time nothing was labeled to indicate ingredients, and the soups required asking if anyone knew ingredients. I thought the market cute and continued to visit and shop. I looked at the website which provided an e-mail address and inquired about the prospect of clearly labeling the food bar selections but no reply. On a later visit I asked for the business card of the owners who I was told were not available, and as the card gave both of their e-mail addresses, i sent a message quite congenially inquiring about the issue of the labeling, and complimentary about the store. I never received a reply. Today i went in hoping I might be able to get something safe to eat, and happened to inquire of none other than the owner. She suggested that the executive chef would come out to assist. He did so, and was a kind gent who then went thru the numerous selections, and as we spoke pulled various signs that were incorrect. Some indicated gluten where he was confident there was none, others not indicating there was in instances where he knew they wasHe pulled the written recipes for each. As I selected several things on his assurance, he offered two additional soups that were not out yet. He suggested vegetable minestrone, but when I queried him he realized, yes, it had pasta, but he assured me the turkey and rice  soup would be perfect.I ordered a pint and decided to eat at their small seating area inside. As I ate the soup, i realized with my fourth spoonful that the soup was full of white pasta, not rice.I was shocked, and returned to the deli counter and sought him out, he was confused by it....I asked him to have the owner come out as I appreciated his sincerity but it was clear she needed to know the depth of the problem there. I was told she wass busy. I asked for someone who could take the unconsumed food and refund my money. A shift supervisor came out who began to understand the problem the second or third time I explained it. He expressed regrets several times,,,I requested he ask the owner whom I had met earlier to phone me, he simply took my # and said 'someone' would be in touch. Bottom line, celiac disease is not a food preference, it's a serious G.I. allergy......the consequences of consuming gluten for celiacs is serious. I did not appreciate the chaotic way my needs were  falsely addressed. I normally shop at Real Foods, a larger family owned business, where the owner returns her customer's e-mails and phone calls!

Perhaps it was the many,  items I couldn't pass up, like guac, salsa and thick tortilla chips, the \"Sandwich of the Day\", the 70% cocoa chocolate bar, etc, etc, etc...\n\nThis little market is a gauntlet of not-to-pass-up goodies.  If you're an impulse buyer, like me, be careful stepping foot into this little Glen Park pit of temptation.  \n\nWhy?  Because they stock high-priced and from what I've experienced so far, very boutique and high quality food and goods that are difficult not to try.  You have to fight the impulse to grab this or that  as you make your way towards  the friendly cashier staff.\n\nMy brother and sister-in-law, both Berliner Germans, who went to Canyon Market  (DAILY...for 6days straight) to buy whatever, really loved it.  They were extremely  impressed with the organic fruits and vegetables.  The huge seasonal bins of impressive and varied organic heirloom tomatoes nearly brought them to their knees.  Caprese Salad, for days, anyone? \n\nBeyond that, Canyon Market has a very impressive salad bar, a small but nice selection of high-end liquors and a very good selection of wines and import beers.  The meats always look tasty and the seafood looks to be fresh, and ,whenever possible, local.  Their cheese section is small,  but that may be a nod to the local nearby cheese shop. (Perhaps Canyon is being a good neighbor to other established nearby businesses?)  The prepared food section looks pretty darn amazing although I haven't sampled any yet.  The in-house bakery does well also, seeminly going so far as not overlapping baked goods featured at the nearby Destination Bakery.\n\nIf you're a frequent Safeway or Lucky's shopper you'll probably run screaming because of the prices.

Then someone walked over to me, continued past me and started cleaning the coffee machine and wiping down the counters as I clearly stood right there waiting to order. When I said excuse me she turned around and acted as though I was causing her a problem. I told them I'd like to order two bagels toasted with cream cheese. I told her I was going to go get a juice and asked if I could pay for everything together and she said no! I then went and got my juice, bought it at the regular cash register area, went back over to the coffee area and payed for my bagels seperately. The woman ringing me up didn't ever ask if I wanted cash back, when I told her I did want cash back she mumbled something letting me know it was too late. Needless to say, I was a little frusterated. I was giving them service and everything seemed to be a problem to this woman who was \"helping\" me.

But in truth, that's my one star off, because I'd love to be able to walk or bike to this healthy, organic-y, green-thinking, family owned neighborhood grocer's for all my groceries and never hit Safeway again in my life. Alas.\n\nWhat I do want to comment on are the staff members who go out of their way to remember your coffee order (Sharon), your sandwich order (Barrett) and pretty much everything else about you (Kirsten). The owners, Richard and Janet, will also go quite out of their way for you, have ordered anything I've ever asked about, and were kind enough to gather my phoned in grocery order for me the other day when I had a sick dog with me.  Good old fashioned neighborhood service, right?\n\nBut it goes even beyond that - this morning I arrived at the coffee bar just in time to realize that I'd forgotten my coffee cup, which I'm religious about bringing so as not to use the paper ones. Sharon jokingly asked where my mug was and I must have made a grumpy face because as I went to pay I realized she had charged me the bring-your-own discount price even though I was without my trusty mug. That was awfully nice, but then I went to pay and noticed my car key was missing from my bag. I must have looked a little panicked because she came out from behind the counter and helped me look through my bag.  Literally held my books and phone and etc, while encouraging me to take everything out of the bag, while she looked around the counter and floor. No key. So Sharon took down my phone # in case anyone turned in the key. \n\nThe key turned up later at the Glen Park BART station and when I called to tell them, they were all very relieved. Sometimes I don't get this much attention from my friends!\n\nThis is just a hands down ridiculously great neighborly way of being, and it makes this shop a real boon to Glen Park.", "author": "Elyse N."}

I heard through the grapevine that the owner has noted this complaint and lowered some of the prices.  I think that at least the staples are now more comparable to other stores. Still, I cannot afford any of their ready made food. Too bad  - it looks really yummy. But, I go almost daily to pick up a little something for my family of 4 since it is on my route to and from home. I usually get the very basics... milk, eggs, bread, yogurt, vegetables, fruit, tortillas, a can of black beans, etc. A bag of the simplest groceries costs me about $30. All organic and fresh.  If I throw a few items in...like specialty pickles or maybe something from their deli like their yummy smoked chicken spread...or gather up ingredients for a more complicated meal....each grocery bag becomes about $50. For us, that's a lot. \n\nIn sum, the prepared foods behind the glass are typically expensive. But, their salad bar and soup bar is very reasonable.", "author": "Jennifer F."}

When I unwrapped the fucking thing on my lunch break it was like 2 million Hitler's flipping me off and pissing on my face while chuckling.  My Op Supervisor wanted to take a camera photo of it: cheddar cheese between two pieces of SLICED wheat bread = $5.25 with out even fucking mustard.  FUCK!!!!!!!

My usual purchase includes some produce (always fresh and tasty), bottle of wine (or 3), fresh meat or fish. All the stuff at the deli counter is really good. Soups are good. I've had people feed me with cheese and information while wandering around there. The spreads section on the left when you head toward the check out line, has all kinds of good stuff. Spicy hummus, pico de gallo, cheese spread, mole, bring it.", "author": "Sean S."}

Great wines.\nThe neighborhood went to great lengths to stop the market and some of the resentment is still visible, but this market with fresh, mostly organic, carefully picked produce and products costs what any business which pays fair wages and takes pains has to charge to meet a bottom line.\nAll of the bread and pastries are house made, the deli and cheese selections are exceptional and the salad bar offers delicious house made soups (I found myself in a fight with a man who wanted the last of the tortilla soup one night). The wines, the oils and the various delicacies are hand selected by the owner, whose wife, a pastry chef, is responsible for the great selection of fresh bread and some of the pastries. \nThe take grab and go items at the counter are reasonable and delicious. I often pick a few things up when I visit friends in places like Stockton, so I don't have to eat in the local restaurants. The market offers a number of vegetarian and vegan items, all of which are more than acceptable to omnivores. \nFor those who find it too expensive, there's Safeway's mediocre but cheap food on Monterey or up the hill and a couple of by the book corner groceries in the neighborhood. \nYou can have cheap, and you can have good, but they rarely go together. Canyon is a terrific resource. \nBy the way, the owner does smile. He's just really, really serious and earnest about food.", "author": "Otto S."}

But when they refuse to sell the Mission YMCA Bart tickets, I will NEVER buy anything from them ever again!!! My brother's son goes to the Y Camp, and they we going to an art museum in Oakland, and Bart didn't accept their card. So Bart told them that they can go to the Canyon Market and that they should be able to sell them to her. Well when the director walked over there to buy them, the manager himself refused to sell her them. He stated that he was saving them for his \"community\", when the YMCA severs children in the Glen Park area which is his community! My nephew child lives in Glen Park!!! Due to his cold heartedness the staff was forced to change their trip to the art museum (which they were charged $40 for canceling lost minute) and they had to take the children to the park. I can't believe this man, and that he can say no to such a good spirit group of people who help keep children off the streets for the summer. A group of parents at the Y are boycotting this store and I would like you all to do the same.", "author": "Vincent H."}

Although it looks nice, I was disappointed to find that the prices were so HIGH. I mean, I spent about $60 on different things--I would have come far ahead had I driven to Rainbow Grocery. I felt like I had walked into this alternate universe where everything was about 20-30% more expensive than the norm at other comparable stores in the city. I did not even leave the store with a full bag or even 2 meals. They would be better off to offer people some \"special offers\" and/or lowering their prices (like Rainbow Grocery). I had one of the prepared foods from the deli and it was really dry and had no flavor. Maybe the people in Glen Park have the income to pay so much for a few groceries, but for the rest of us, a good value vs. good price balance could be better reached.  I know it must be expensive to run such a store, but just seems like they could do a much better business for more people if their products were not so out of reach for most people.", "author": "Don P."}

I love it because they have three (fresh) great soups each and every day, including Vegetable Minestrone, Clam Chowder, Sausage and Bean, Meatball and Rice, Turkey Pasta, Chicken Tortilla, Broccoli cheddar, 7 seas fish, butternut squash. I could go on an on. A sweet little roll --(whole wheat sesame or sour dough) right next to go with. OR A salad bar filled with delectable choices, all of the regular stuff but including red/golden beets, various housemade  salads  including potato, roasted vegetables, couscous, rice blends, roasted corn and tomatoes, plus  great homemade dressings topped off with  a diverse olive bar . A well staffed deli section with delectable (might take a few minutes) custom sandwiches, and at least 20 different salads/and other deli choices ( ALL of which all that I have tried are delectable --love Pad Thai)  A great meat section where  you can buy a full roasted chicken or  walk down  (as we do) and pick out a great cut of something for a Saturday night BBQ.  Check out the on site (often warm when you buy it) made bread, sour and baguettes and everything in between, as well as cupcakes or cheese cake (even vegan varieties) or rare chocolate all up in front. Also the produce section is filled with in season fruits and vegetables with choices galore! PLUS Canyon Market has seasonal flowers and plants, a coffee bar and an eclectic wine department. Prices are reasonable for what you get. A truly great neighborhood market that makes Glen Park proud!", "author": "Lewiston S."}

Today was the ultimate last time! I enter go to buy some produce and meat...hmmm only 1 cabbage that isn't even fresh looking - fine let me just get the meat at this point - I go up to the butcher counter andask the lady for some help - she's fixing the scale turns around and starts gossiping with another female employee and doesn't even acknowledge me event though I'm right in her face. I ask the other lady for help - all I want is some dame lamb chili grinded - she tells me she needs to ask the butcher if he can do it that is if he has the time - I say fine and wait about 10 minutes to get my answer - she comes back helps another customer and then comes to me with an answer - the butcher says you need to buy at least 2 pounds - I say fine - she sighs and I ask her to please tell him I still want it - then this punk kid comes out from the back (this is the butcher) and starts telling me about how he would have to turn on the grinder and how its such an inconvenience and how I need to buy 2 punds before he would actually do it but he would only be able to give me 1.5 pounds b/c the grinder looses half a pound when you actually grind meat. After his bullshit attitude I decided to leave the basket I had filled with less than mediocre produce in the middle of the store and walk out. So to Canyon Market I say : FUCK YOU AND ALL THE BITCHES WHO WORK THERE! I live right up the street and I am never going back - today I decided I will continue to give Mollie Stones my business because you don't deserve it. If I could give no stars I would but this website won't let me. This place is an embarassment to Glen Park and the people who run it and work there have no damn clue what they are doing - go get some experience before you decide to run a wannabe Whole Foods!", "author": "SF Gal .."}
