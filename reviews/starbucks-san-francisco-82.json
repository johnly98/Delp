Evidently, he had developed quite the pallet for McCafe drinks, and had only come into this Starbucks in desperation for caffeine.  I shared that I had seen a storefront McDonalds a couple of blocks away on Market St. while walking earlier, but like me, he had already ordered and was waiting for the team of delightfully-Millenial barista-folk with an extra side of Tenderloin-ilk to get around to preparing it.\n\nDid I mention it was a ten minute conversation?  That's largely due to the ten minute wait for my Red-eye with coconut milk... there was no real line to speak of, and it isn't like I ordered Kopi Lewak served in a Peruvian Paracas skull with a bendy straw... no, they were just kinda on errant Thursday morning time I guess.\n\nThe usual gang of puffer jackets and overpriced flannels were sitting in their usual seats designing the usual beta tests and writing the usual screenplays.  Or was that the Toluca Lake Starbucks I was in last week?  I dunno, it's all a blur.\n\nAnyway, the drink was fine, and I suppose the anticipatory wait made me like it more.  Lousy caffeine addiction...  oh, and parking for this Starbucks is $1,200/hr (probably).", "author": "Ben A."}

I hadn't eaten anything since lunch, which was about 6.5 hours ago. I was also thirsty. Okay, where to? Leaving from Post Street and heading to the Powell Street BART Station, I needed to get something quick to eat and drink. No time to sit, just a grab and go. Yelp search of Starbucks brought me to this location. Besides, I also needed to earn my 175 bonus stars for visiting Starbucks 5 days in a row. (That's enough stars to earn a free item.)\n\nIt was a little crowded, but the baristas were able to get the line to move quickly. I looked down at one of their refrigerated cases and I did not see my favorite panini - tomato mozzarella. Oh, bummer! I went ahead and ordered a tall shaken passion iced tea with no sugar. I asked the barista if there were any tomato and mozzarella sandwich left because I didn't see any. Response: yes. I looked behind me and lo and behold, there was a line of several people behind me. I could not get to the other refrigerated case to retrieve the panini.\n\nThe barista serving me was kind enough to leave his station to retrieve the panini for me. He even had the panini heated up, so I could enjoy it with my iced tea. For that, I am appreciative that he certainly knew how to keep a customer happy.\n\nToo bad that not all Starbucks are the same in pleasing customers.

Second of all, there're only 4 drinks that I get (coconut milk macchiato in spring, cold brew in the summer, green tea frap with soy in the fall, and cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e latte around Christmas). Only drinking 4 different things gave me the expertise to compare and critique them.\n\nNever never have I received a watered down coffee. Seriously! I asked for less ice so you add half cup of tap water? I ordered the venti sweet cream cold brew with very very light ice and extra sweet cream. Since I didn't do mobile order I was able to watch the barista make my drink? He added lots of ice and splash of tap water to fill my drink to the top. Really? Add tap water to fill the ice coffee? I saw him do that, and when he passed me the drink he already know there were way too much ice, so he took it back, dumped the whole thing out and made my second cold brew with half cup of water. He gave me the same amount of coffee in the cup, instead of adding ice, he just filled it up with water. I felt like I wasn't drinking coffee, I was drinking coffee flavored water... I waited again to tell him about the drink and was ignored so I left the drink on the counter and left.\n\nPicked up the same drink at another location today, saw them make it, no water were added in my coffee.

The server stayed she would need to make it again seeming frustrated at her fellow employee instead of being remorseful. She then placed another drink on the counter and mistakenly knocked the previous drink over causing it to spill all over the floor and onto that customer waiting for her drink. Instead of apologizing, the server proceeded to say \"leave it\" to the customer who went to get a napkin to clean herself. Not once did I hear this server apologize or offer to comp her drink for this inconvenience. Knowing the importance of customer service at Starbucks, I feel that this situation was handled poorly.

It seemed like there was an error in charging the young lady's credit card, and instead of politely asking to run her card again, she stood at the register barking orders like a drill sergeant while this poor young lady tried to squeeze her way back to the register through the crowd. After finally getting the register, completing the transaction, and getting more attitude from the cashier, the barista had completed her order and was then yelling her name over and over again as she frantically tried to squeeze her way back to the pickup counter. \n\nI know it gets busy in there, but being busy is never an excuse for poor customer service.", "author": "Brian B."}

I do not like this quasi-cold.  Cold with snow that I don't have to shovel- good.  Windy cold- bad.\n\nSo I go in and consider my options.\n\nDo I want the Pumpkin Spice Latte, with it's orange syrup and nutmeg sprinkles which sink to the bottom and I choke on at the end, making me curse all the calories I've consumed?\n\nOr do I want my usual nonfat no-foam latte?\n\nAs I am dress shopping and feeling guilty about it, I go for the latter.\n\nSo I go in, and there are a bunch of people are milling about.  Most of them have their coffee and aren't in line, so I figure that I'll be in and out.  After all, it's a Starbucks, in the city, in a busy neighborhood, so they are bound to be quick.\n\nBOY WAS I WRONG.  There were 3 people ahead of me, all one group, who didn't know their head from hole in the ground.  Seriously, these people should go back to whatever anti-mensa meeting they came from and play with their blocks and sparkly things, and GET OUT OF MY WAY (this is a common theme).\n\nI finally get up, order, and have no idea what to do next.  The woman who I ordered from, who is standing behind a register, touching it, says someone else has to ring me up.  I am not in the mood for disorganization.  All I have is my Starbucks card and a $20 bill.  I have very little balance left on my card, so the remainder is 95 cents.  I hand her the 20.  She asks me if I have 95 cents.  If I had 95 cents, I would have given it to her.  If she had any sense, she wouldn't have asked.

MINUS THE COFFEE. and for the record, when you are on a long train ride and clearly need caffeine to stay awake, warm, sweetened milk is the exact OPPOSITE of what you want to drink. \n\ni understand that all the starbucks near union square are bound to be teeming with tourists, and their barristas, therefore, a bit slammed. no, i don't expect them to be able to swirl a capital K into my foam with the espresso, the way the peet's in my old (suburban) neighborhood would. however, i do expect that when i pay $4.15 for coffee, i actually get coffee! and i imagine that since most of their customers are tourists, they'd be happy about, and quick to serve someone like me, who makes an efficient and decisive order and actually says please. clearly this is not the case. there are three morning barristas i've seen who are friendly and efficient: short guy with brown hair and electric blue eyes, tall girl with blondish-brownish hair and glasses, and slightly older asian gentleman with glasses. sadly, those three can't make up for the apathy of the rest of the staff. and i say apathy with confidence, because how much do you actually have to care to put COFFEE in my COFFEE? apparently more than most of these barristas. \n\ndear yelpers: if you're in this area and in need of coffee, i HIGHLY recommend that you visit the starbucks at 442 geary. even though the amazing eddie no longer works there, it's the only starbucks in union square that i've been to that seems to care about customer service. don't believe me? check out my (fuzzy) cellphone pic of me dumping my starbucks coffee into an empty peets cup (where i ultimately found caffeine/salvation). and by coffee, i mean steamed milk and caramel.", "author": "Kris G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-30", "description": "What people don't understand about a busy store is that it is very hard to keep it clean and move as fast as a neighborhood store.  The Starbucks on 201 Powell is bombarded by tourists who don't speak the English well, so they have a hard time ordering when they don't even understand what the names for the drinks even are.  The line slows down that way and the Barista's try their best to expedite the line by taking orders before you get to the register, so they can get started on your drink faster.  A line of drinks also take time to make, since there are ingredients that go into them.  There is the syrup, espresso, and steamed milk that go into a more complicated hot drink and frappucinos are the most complicated for the cold drinks.  The condiment bars and bathrooms get trashed every ten minutes because the store is so busy.  A barista is not able to clean all that thouroughly constantly when its there is a crowd of people standing over the mess.  The milk is changed out about every ten minutes because so many people pour that milk into their cups.  You should tell Starbucks to have 10 people working at one time if you want a perfectly clean and fast running store, but they would probably go broke and so would every other food business.  You can not expect the best from downtown.  People have the wrong idea of getting the best from a city.  I believe smaller cities can give you better service.  But then again, if you put a person trained in the big city into a smaller one, that would probably be the best.  \n\nNow, for the bathroom there is usually a long line and that makes it hard to clean.  Imagine if you worked for that store and you had to ask the people in line if it was ok for them to wait longer so you could clean it.  Most people are ok with it, but you do get some rude people who would rather knock you down and make you cry before they let you go in BEFORE they do.  It is even hard for the workers to use the bathroom that they have to go to another store to use one.  Just be happy that there is even a bathroom to use because you wouldn't want to pee on the street would you.\n\nOn another note, baristas try hard to serve the customers, but when the day has been too long and too full of nonsensical customers you get fed up sometimes.  You need to talk with your co-workers unless you want a boring life and never ever talk with the people you work with and stress out all day about the dumb people on the otherside of the counter that you sometimes have to deal with.  Imagine yourself working at a busy retail environment.  What would you really do?  Concentrate on the customer and only the customer your whole 8 hour shift and not communicate with the other workers at all? Seriously?  Give me a break.  I bet all those people that give this place bad reviews are people who have never had a job or never had a lower paying job.  They are just high and mighty people spoiled by their parents or rather a high paying job that they may or may not have worked hard for, but you should you really think about the position of the store and its workers before making a judgment.  That goes for any other judgments you might make as well.", "author": "Linda L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-08-13", "description": "There was a horrid time in San Francisco when we had no 24 hour Starbucks locations. After moving back from SoCal, this was a stark reality I just had to accept. Then angels sang and the clouds parted and God granted us this craphole. (Then later making up for his mistake by giving us the lesser evil of the Laurel Heights 24 hr Starbucks.)\n\nDue to this Starbucks' location, it almost ALWAYS has a long line scooting close to the door. I've come here at night and odd hours of the morning, and the line is still bad. And since this place is almost always busy, they run out of drink-making materials constantly. After visiting the place five times in a row and not getting any of my normal drinks (nor good suggestions of alternatives from the baristas), I gave up on this place. There are half a dozen Starbucks locations within four blocks of this place and it's just not worth suffering through the poor service.\n\nSince this Starbucks is the most prominent for tourists, they tend to stuff up the line with their slowness. If you just want a coffee like I often do, you'll have to stand there for twenty minutes as the group of ten decides who is getting what, who is paying for what, and why the heck Starbucks calls small sizes \"tall.\"\n\nGiven that this place is a closet, there is hardly any seating. There's probably a total of six tables based solely on the fact that is all they can cram inside. I suppose it doesn't matter since Union Square is a block away, but whatever. And yes, their bathroom is as hideous as you think. Hold your pee and go down two blocks to Nordstrom in the SF Shopping Centre if it's still open. If not, I don't suggest peeing in an alley nearby as cops frequent this Starbucks all hours of the day and night.\n\nIf you're going shopping and walking around to begin with, skip over this place as there are better Starbucks stores to go to. No matter what direction you're heading, there's going to be better service. But this place is adequate during late night, just hope all the drunk club-hoppers don't get in line before you. Though not surprising at all, more of them head to the other 24 hour Starbucks than this place.", "author": "Grace-Monday B."}

I must mention that many of the employees have gone out of their way to make conversation with me or recommend the best pastries. Considering how busy they are, this kind of customer service really sticks out. Yeah, there's been a couple times when I've had to wait light years, which is my reasoning behind the four stars... but this is understandable. My favorite things to order are the pumpkin cheese muffin (seasonal), cheese danish, or the vanilla bean frap with caramel drizzle. God, I love you, Starbucks.", "author": "April S."}

And now that they know me, it's just an added bonus that by the time I get to the register, they've already started steaming soy milk.

All thee time I would go in there and I hated the vibe off top until I met this beautiful girl who some what actually had a personality. Shes the only reason why I went 30 times a day but this place sucks so much she even cut turf smmmhhhh. So I go in there and this girl her name is LIZ drops my f-in sandwhich and puts in the bag.  Are u serious u crazy lady tell me u didnt do that, all she said was \" my hands are clean and the floor was mopped\". WHAT THE HELL U DUMB IDIOT U JUST DROPPED MY EFFIN sandwhich on the floor. She made me another one and still charged me. Another time my total was 8.60 and I said \"jesus christ what the hell thats the most expensive coffee ive ever had\". The chick replied \" its starbucks what do u expect duuh\". Ok screw u ! Now i go to the bart station on Powell and they are so nice one time i spilled coffee all over the floor right during closing the girl was soo nice she made me a new cup and didnt charge after she already started cleaing.

It is completely run down, paint chipping, corners dented, and slow, annoyed service.  You need a code to get into the bathroom, and not just any employee will tell you what it is.  You have to ask the busy guy at the register.  The barista girl yelling out the order had the snobbiest tone of voice and was not cheerful.

Came here, ordered a frappacino with a floating shot...double check with the guy doing my order that it would be floating since he seemed to be paying more attention to his casual chat with the other workers.  He confirms...i get my drink and there's no floating top.  I tell the worker, and he starts argueing with me, telling me that he blended it in(not what i asked for, I like the way the floating shot smooths out the ice chunks) and seems just completely unable to grasp the concept that I wanted it floating not blended in and that it isnt the same thing.  Won't be going back here...getting the drink wrong is one thing, argueing with me about fixing it when i just paid $5 for my drink is not acceptable.  Go to another one...i think they just dont care here because of all the tourists.", "author": "Brett T."}
